40|$|This article {{explores the}} trust {{relations}} between managing directors (MDs) and non-executive directors (NEDs) within small- and medium-sized enterprises. Complex mechanisms are revealed within repeated cycles {{of social interaction}} that result in the NED changing from an effective agent <b>acting</b> rationally <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> <b>of</b> the company to an ineffective agent <b>acting</b> subjectively <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> <b>of</b> the MD. Inherent tensions exist during this change of role and trust relations that threaten the self-esteem of both parties.

5|$|The Fourteenth Amendment, {{particularly}} {{its first}} section, {{is one of}} the most litigated parts of the Constitution, forming the basis for landmark decisions such as Brown v.

5|$|A {{number of}} press reports came {{out during the}} Ethics Committee's work that purported to reveal aspects of the {{investigations}}. Chair Heflin was upset by the leaks and two investigations into them were held, one by the General Accounting Office <b>acting</b> <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> <b>of</b> the committee and one by the Senate's Temporary Special Independent Counsel. Neither report reached a conclusive finding or directly implicated anyone in the leaks. The special counsel report, released in 1992, ascribed partisanship as the motive for the leaks {{and said they were}} intended to hurt DeConcini, Riegle, and Cranston; it also gave an inference that McCain and his staff were responsible for key leaks.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century, the primary legal test used in the United States to {{determine}} if speech could be criminalized was the bad tendency test. Rooted in English common law, the test permitted speech to be outlawed if it {{had a tendency to}} harm public welfare. One of the earliest cases in which the Supreme Court addressed punishment after material was published was Patterson v. Colorado (1907) in which the Court used the bad tendency test to uphold contempt charges against a newspaper publisher who accused Colorado judges of <b>acting</b> <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> <b>of</b> local utility companies.|$|E
50|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} of the first human settlement in Hiiumaa dates to the 4th century BC. The first documented record of the island of Dageida was made by contemporary chroniclers in 1228, when Hiiumaa {{and the rest of}} Estonia were conquered by Germanic crusaders. In 1254, Hiiumaa was divided between the Bishopric of Ösel-Wiek and the Livonian branch of the Teutonic Order, <b>acting</b> partly <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> <b>of</b> the Hanseatic League.|$|R
50|$|In 1635, {{during the}} {{planning}} for the aborted Plantation of Connacht, the estate was bought by Sir Phillip Perceval <b>acting</b> secretly <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> <b>of</b> the Lord Deputy Wentworth and Sir George Radcliffe. Subsequent allegations claimed that Perceval tricked O'Connor into selling by claiming that it belonged to the Crown and {{would be subject to}} Plantation without any recompense to O'Connor. The hostility created by this was instrumental in the Sligo gentries taking part in the 1641 rebellion.|$|R

5|$|On August 9, 1898, American {{troops that}} were {{pursuing}} units retreating from Coamo encountered heavy resistance in Aibonito and retreated after six of their soldiers were injured. They returned three days later, reinforced with artillery units and attempted a surprise attack. In the subsequent crossfire, confused soldiers reported seeing Spanish reinforcements nearby and five American officers were gravely injured, which prompted a retreat order. All military actions in Puerto Rico were suspended on August 13, after U.S. President William McKinley and French Ambassador Jules Cambon, <b>acting</b> <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> <b>of</b> the Spanish government, signed an armistice whereby Spain relinquished its sovereignty over the territories of Puerto Rico, Cuba, the Philippines and Guam.|$|E
5|$|The Rudd Concession, {{a written}} {{concession}} for exclusive mining rights in Matabeleland, Mashonaland and other adjoining territories {{in what is}} today Zimbabwe, was granted by King Lobengula of Matabeleland to Charles Rudd, James Rochfort Maguire and Francis Thompson, three agents <b>acting</b> <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> <b>of</b> the South African-based politician and businessman Cecil Rhodes, on 30 October 1888. Despite Lobengula's retrospective attempts to disavow it, it proved {{the foundation for the}} royal charter granted by the United Kingdom to Rhodes's British South Africa Company in October 1889, and thereafter for the Pioneer Column's occupation of Mashonaland in 1890, which marked the beginning of white settlement, administration and development in the country that eventually became Rhodesia, named after Rhodes, in 1895.|$|E
5|$|The emperor's role as supreme judge {{could be}} {{temporarily}} duplicated by any official he designated {{in times of}} emergency or in distant borderlands where central government had little influence. This entailed a symbolic conferral of power, which was embodied in the Staff of Authority (Jiezhang 節杖). Roughly 2m (6ft) in height and decorated with ribbons, the Staff of Authority was often granted to an official with a specific errand, such as <b>acting</b> <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> <b>of</b> the emperor as ambassador to a foreign country, appointing civilians to office, or immediately promoting a deserving military officer {{on the field of}} battle. Moreover, it granted its bearer the authority to sentence criminals and political rebels with execution without notifying the court first.|$|E

5|$|On May 3, men {{claiming}} to be <b>acting</b> <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> <b>of</b> Baxter supporters hijacked a train from Memphis, Tennessee, and arrested federal Court Justices John E. Bennett and E.J. Earle, thinking that the Court {{would be unable to}} rule without a quorum of Judges. Baxter denied that they were acting under his direction. The Judges were taken to Benton, Arkansas. For several days, their whereabouts were unknown to the public and federal officials began a search for the Justices. Justice Bennett was able to send a letter to Captain Rose demanding to know why they were being held by the Governor of Arkansas. Upon receipt of the letter, troops were sent to Benton to retrieve the two Justices, but they had escaped by May 6 and made their way to Little Rock.|$|E
5|$|Opposition {{seems to}} have {{continued}} even after the coronation. According to William of Malmesbury, an otherwise unknown nobleman called Alfred plotted to blind Æthelstan {{on account of his}} supposed illegitimacy, although it is unknown whether he aimed to make himself king or was <b>acting</b> <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> <b>of</b> Edwin, Ælfweard's younger brother. Blinding would have been a sufficient disability to render Æthelstan ineligible for kingship without incurring the odium attached to murder. Tensions between Æthelstan and Winchester seem to have continued for some years. The Bishop of Winchester, Frithestan, did not attend the coronation or witness any of Æthelstan's known charters until 928. After that he witnessed fairly regularly until his resignation in 931, but was listed in a lower position than entitled by his seniority.|$|E
5|$|Britain and Australia {{had both}} sent forces to {{participate}} in the Second Boer War of 1899 to 1902, which spurred an increased focus on war memorials. The Boer War had involved 200,000 British volunteers alone, and attracted considerable press coverage. Numerous war memorials were erected on their return, either by local community leaders or by the local Lord Lieutenant, <b>acting</b> <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> <b>of</b> the county regiments; these were often situated in quiet locations to allow for peaceful reflection by visitors. Australia had honoured its volunteers by placing individual plaques inside buildings, creating outdoor memorial tablets and erecting obelisks in public places. Although the Boer War encouraged a shift away from memorials portraying heroic commanding officers, as had been popular earlier in the 19th century, towards depicting ordinary soldiers, annual ceremonies surrounding the memorials were not common and no official memorial day emerged. Boer War memorials in both countries were widely felt to lack a suitable quality of design and execution, echoing contemporary concerns in the US about the statues erected to commemorate the American Civil War.|$|E

60|$|Apprehension {{hung like}} a {{thundercloud}} {{over the city}} of Seville {{in those early days}} of the year 1481.
