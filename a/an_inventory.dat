5|$|The game {{incorporates}} <b>an</b> <b>inventory</b> {{system for}} items that Sam picks {{up during the}} course of the game. Items can be used on other entities in the game world, or can often be combined with other inventory items to provide a new object necessary for solving a puzzle. Although Max's character will walk around the game's areas by his own will, Sam can also use Max at various points by using <b>an</b> <b>inventory</b> icon of Max's head on game objects—usually on characters where the solution to a problem involves violence. Sam and Max travel to different locations in the game using their black and white 1960 DeSoto Adventurer, which when clicked on in-game will present a map of the United States with all the available locations the pair can travel to shown. As the game progresses, the number of locations on the map increases.|$|E
5|$|Altogether, around fifty Christian {{artifacts}} {{were found}} in Hasekura's estate in 1640, such as crosses, rosaries, religious gowns and religious paintings. The artifacts were seized and stored by the Date fief. <b>An</b> <b>inventory</b> was made again in 1840 describing the items as belonging to Hasekura Tsunenaga. Nineteen books were also mentioned in the inventory, {{but they have been}} lost since. The artifacts are today preserved in the Sendai City Museum and other museums in Sendai.|$|E
40|$|The Department’s 2007 Greenhouse Gas <b>Inventory</b> is <b>a</b> {{refinement}} of previous statewide <b>inventories.</b> It is <b>a</b> bottom-up <b>inventory</b> of two sectors – fossil fuel combustion at federally-recognized {{major sources of}} air pollution and fossil fuel combustion and ethanol fermentation at dry mill ethanol plants. This is the first bottomup greenhouse gas inventory conducted for Iowa and the first bottom-up greenhouse gas inventory of ethanol plants in the nation that the Department is aware of. In <b>a</b> bottom-up <b>inventory,</b> facility-specific activity data {{is used to calculate}} emissions. In <b>a</b> top-down <b>inventory,</b> aggregate activity data is used to calculate emissions. For example, this bottom-up inventory calculates greenhouse gas emissions from the fossil fuel combustion at each individual facility instead of using the total amount of fossil fuel combusted state-wide, which would be <b>a</b> top-down <b>inventory</b> method. The advantage to <b>a</b> bottom-up <b>inventory</b> is that the calculations are more accurate than <b>a</b> top-down <b>inventory.</b> However, because the two methods differ, the results from <b>a</b> bottom-up <b>inventory</b> are not directly comparable to <b>a</b> top-down <b>inventory...</b>|$|R
50|$|BOVM's varied habitat {{makes it}} a prime {{location}} for research programs. Current on-going projects include <b>a</b> wildflower <b>inventory,</b> <b>a</b> breeding bird survey, bird species point counts (joint project with Green Mountain Audubon Center), an annual butterfly count, and <b>a</b> mammal <b>inventory.</b>|$|R

5|$|Characters can equip weapons, armor, rings, and amulets, {{which provide}} attack or defense points, or give bonuses {{to some other}} statistic. There are also usable items such as potions to restore a character's health or mana. Weapons, armor, and other items are found by killing enemies, {{breaking}} containers, or by purchase from vendors. Each character has <b>an</b> <b>inventory,</b> represented as a fixed grid, with each item depicted by a shape taking up spaces on the grid. One character type, the mule, cannot use weapons or magic, but has a much larger inventory.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, after Rick Wurpel re-opened his {{production}} business, he realised that {{neither he nor}} TTS had the master tapes in their inventory and feared {{that they had been}} lost. He discovered the Denver City Council possessed the tapes among <b>an</b> <b>inventory</b> of 164 recordings. A former employee of Wurpel had been storing the tapes and intended to dispose of them unless the city was interested. The city had paid her $3,000 for the storage costs and took possession of the tapes. Legal proceedings subsequently ensued to return the tapes to Wurpel and U2.|$|E
5|$|The game {{does not}} feature <b>an</b> <b>inventory,</b> and neither health packs nor ammo can be stockpiled. Health packs are used {{immediately}} upon collection, {{and no more}} ammo can be collected than {{the capacity of the}} specific weapon. Players can find ammo and health packs distributed throughout the game at certain predetermined locations and also by looting the bodies of fallen enemies.|$|E
50|$|Each element, a through m, was {{originally}} {{intended to be a}} single decimal digit. <b>As</b> <b>inventories</b> grew in complexity, element g became alphanumeric, beginning with capital A for certain newly added items. By 2000, uppercase C was in use.|$|R
50|$|The {{painting}} was probably commissioned by Pedro de Salazar y Mendoza. It appeared on <b>an</b> <b>inventories</b> of goods of El Greco in 1614, and Jorge Manuel in 1621. It entered {{the collection of}} the Museo del Greco in 1910.|$|R
5000|$|Inventory: A key {{responsibility}} of collection managers is performing <b>a</b> detailed <b>inventory</b> of all items in their collection. Depending on the institution's collection management policy, <b>a</b> complete <b>inventory</b> {{can be taken}} every 5-10 years, with spot inventories performed annually.|$|R
5|$|The game {{is filled}} {{with a variety of}} puzzles that must be solved to advance the story. These include memory games and mazes. Others involve {{competing}} against a computer-controlled opponent, completing a sequence in a limited number of moves, operating mechanisms, or using <b>an</b> <b>inventory</b> item. Puzzles do not all have to be completed in a precise order; there is some flexibility in terms of being able to move through game areas and work on different challenges.|$|E
5|$|A typical {{cemetery}} {{is surrounded}} by a low wall or hedge and with a wrought-iron gate entrance. For cemeteries in France and Belgium, a land tablet near the entrance or along a wall identifies the cemetery grounds as having been provided by the French or Belgian governments. All but the smallest cemeteries contain a register with <b>an</b> <b>inventory</b> of the burials, a plan of the plots and rows, and a basic history of the cemetery. The register is located within a metal cupboard that is marked with a cross located in either the wall near the cemetery entrance or in a shelter within the cemetery. More recently, in larger sites, a stainless steel notice gives details of the respective military campaign. The headstones within the cemetery are of a uniform size and design and mark plots of equal size.|$|E
5|$|After the {{accidental}} release, another radiological survey was performed, {{and the state}} government concluded that PermaGrain needed to be relocated. The DCNR made the policy decision that Quehanna Wild Area would be closed to industrial uses. After looking at multiple sites with Clearfield County development authorities, a new site for PermaGrain Products was purchased, and the company submitted its {{plans for a new}} building and license to the NRC in October 2001. In order to approve the move to the new site, the NRC required PermaGrain to provide <b>an</b> <b>inventory</b> of all their cobalt-60 sources, dispose of a damaged source, and dispose of any other sources not mechanically certified. However in late December 2002, PermaGrain filed for bankruptcy under Chapter Seven. PermaGrain had employed 135 people in 1988 and 80 in 1995.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> content <b>inventory</b> is {{the process}} and the result of {{cataloging}} the entire contents of a website. An allied practice—a content audit—{{is the process}} of evaluating that content. <b>A</b> content <b>inventory</b> and <b>a</b> content audit are closely related concepts, and they are often conducted in tandem.|$|R

5|$|<b>An</b> <b>inventory</b> {{drawn up}} at the Hôtel de la Reine after Catherine's death shows her {{to have been a}} keen collector. Listed works of art {{included}} tapestries, hand-drawn maps, sculptures, rich fabrics, ebony furniture inlaid with ivory, sets of china, and Limoges pottery. There were also hundreds of portraits, for which a vogue had developed during Catherine's lifetime. Many portraits in her collection were by Jean Clouet (1480–1541) and his son François Clouet (1572). François Clouet drew and painted portraits of all Catherine's family and of many members of the court. After Catherine's death, a decline in the quality of French portraiture set in. By 1610, the school patronised by the late Valois court and brought to its pinnacle by François Clouet had all but died out.|$|E
5|$|<b>An</b> <b>inventory</b> {{taken in}} 1634 after Zouche's death listed the library as having 250 {{books and a}} {{collection}} of mathematical instruments, and revealed that the maids' chamber was of a very high standard. James Zouch, grandson of Edward la Zouche, sold the property to the Earl of Antrim in 1637, at which time the house's furniture was valued at £2,762. During the reign of Charles I, the house was partly destroyed by a fire. On 25 June 1640, Lord Antrim sold Bramshill for £9,500 to Sir Robert Henley. In 1673 it was the property of his son, Sir Andrew Henley, 1st Baronet.|$|E
5|$|Bacher {{and fellow}} {{commissioner}} Sumner Pike {{began with an}} inspection of Los Alamos and the Hanford Site, and conducted <b>an</b> <b>inventory</b> of the fissionable material at Los Alamos with Norris Bradbury, who had succeeded Oppenheimer as its director. He found that only nine atomic bombs had been built in 1946; only four would be in 1947, primarily due to production problems with the reactors at Hanford. These problems {{were on their way}} to resolution when Bacher observed the Operation Sandstone nuclear tests at Enewetak Atoll in 1948 as the Atomic Energy Commission's representative. Bacher's original two-year term would have expired on January 1, 1949, but President Harry Truman convinced him to stay on. Bacher resigned in May 1949, and this time the President was unable to dissuade him.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>inventory</b> {{of known}} Henry Peter Bosse {{photographic}} views and print variants was first assembled by Bob Wiederanders of the Fred W. Woodward Riverboat Museum, Dubuque, IA. Kenton Spading, P.E., U.S Army Corps of Engineers, St. Paul District, with the capable assistance of Roberta (Bobbie) Peterson, expanded the inventory.|$|R
50|$|Deseret Book began {{publishing}} LDS fiction for {{the first}} time in 1979. In 1986 it purchased Mormon Handicraft-a handmade crafts store-from the Relief Society. <b>As</b> <b>inventory</b> and distribution was centralized in 1984, Deseret Book expanded its lines to include items such as CTR rings and more popular music.|$|R
40|$|Recent floristic and phytosociological survey-techniques {{used in the}} Netherlands are {{reviewed}} by the authors. The particular combination of techniques, used {{in the investigation of}} the province of Utrecht, is discussed. <b>A</b> floristic <b>inventory</b> is made of separate habitats in everyone of the kilometer squares; these separate lists are then combined to give <b>a</b> total <b>inventory</b> of 1 kilometer square comparable to the method of MENNEMA (1973). The frequency of each species in the various habitats is also given. Also <b>a</b> phytosociological <b>inventory</b> is made and a new system of mapping the vegetation-units is introduced...|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} 18th century Henry Hare, 3rd Baron Coleraine (1694–1749) oversaw a remodelling {{of the north}} of the house, that added a range of rooms to the north and the Coleraine coat of arms to the {{pediment}} of the north facade. In the late 18th century, under the ownership of James Townsend, the narrow east facade of the house was remodelled into an entrance front, and given the appearance of a typical Georgian house. At the same time, the south front's gabled attics were removed, giving the house's southern elevation its current appearance. <b>An</b> <b>inventory</b> of the house made in 1789 in preparation for its sale listed a hall, saloon, drawing room, dining room and breakfast parlour on the ground floor, with a library and billiard room on the first floor.|$|E
5|$|Resident Evil is a {{survival}} horror game where the player controls the on-screen character from a third-person perspective {{to interact with}} the environment. To advance through the game, the player must explore a mansion and its surrounding areas while avoiding, outsmarting and defeating monsters like zombies, undead dogs, and giant spiders. The player can open doors, push certain objects, climb obstacles, and pick up items. When an item is collected, it is stored in <b>an</b> <b>inventory</b> that the player can access at any time. Items in the inventory can be used, examined, and combined to solve puzzles and gain access to areas that were previously inaccessible. The inventory is limited to a certain number of slots, and the player must often move items from the inventory to storage boxes located in certain areas to manage space.|$|E
5|$|The {{back wall}} of the room, which is in shadow, is hung with rows of paintings, {{including}} {{one of a series of}} scenes from Ovid's Metamorphoses by Peter Paul Rubens, and copies, by Velázquez's son-in-law and principal assistant Juan del Mazo, of works by Jacob Jordaens. The paintings are shown in the exact positions recorded in <b>an</b> <b>inventory</b> taken around this time. The wall to the right is hung with a grid of eight smaller paintings, visible mainly as frames owing to their angle from the viewer. They can be identified from the inventory as more Mazo copies of paintings from the Rubens Ovid series, though only two of the subjects can be seen.|$|E

5|$|The game {{features}} nonlinear gameplay, allowing multiple {{different ways}} to achieve objectives. This includes travelling between different areas in an open world and making choices that determine the dialogues and order of events as well as alternative endings depending on who the player identifies as the culprit. However, {{only one of the}} characters is the true culprit, while the others are red herrings; if the player closes the case with the wrong culprit, then the player will face criticism from the police chief and need to re-open the case. The game includes a phone {{that could be used to}} manually dial any number, which is needed to contact several non-player characters. The game also features <b>an</b> <b>inventory</b> system requiring the examination and collection of items, which could be used as evidence later in the game.|$|E
5|$|The game {{implements}} <b>an</b> <b>inventory</b> {{system to}} allow Sam to store any items that the player picks {{up during the}} course of the game. The player may select any of the items in the inventory and can then attempt to use them on objects in the game world or give them to other characters simply by clicking on the desired target. Unlike Save the Worlds predecessor, Sam & Max Hit the Road, inventory items are context specific, and cannot be used together or combined to create new items. Typically, Sam carries a gun that may be used to solve several puzzles.|$|E
5|$|The {{survival}} horror genre is {{also known}} for other non-combat challenges, such as solving puzzles at certain locations in the game world, and collecting and managing <b>an</b> <b>inventory</b> of items. Areas of the game world will be off limits until the player gains certain items. Occasionally, levels are designed with alternative routes. Levels also challenge players with maze-like environments, which test the player's navigational skills. Levels are often designed as dark and claustrophobic (often making use of dim or shadowy light conditions and camera angles and sightlines which restrict visibility) to challenge the player and provide suspense, although games in the genre also make use of enormous spatial environments.|$|E
