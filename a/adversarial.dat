5|$|Carol J. Clover, {{the author}} of , is {{featured}} providing facts about horror filmmaking. Clover {{is a professor of}} rhetoric, film, and Scandinavian history. Her books include The People's Plot: Film, Narrative, and the <b>Adversarial</b> Imagination, Old Norse-Icelandic Literature: A Critical Guide, and The Medieval Saga.|$|E
5|$|A snap {{election}} was called, with Bruce taking {{his case to}} the people that dramatic action on industrial relations was needed. Opposition Leader Scullin forcefully attacked the government, blaming the Prime Minister for an industrial environment that was <b>adversarial</b> and punitive, stressing that Commonwealth arbitration had safeguarded many rights of workers and was completely workable with conciliation and proper consultation. Scullin also criticised the government for the growing debt problem and economic malaise, which for some years he had predicted would lead to a major economic crisis.|$|E
5|$|Michael Farrar {{underwent}} surgery in December 1995 to treat an abscess {{in his brain}} caused by the poisoning. Fearful that Farrar would not survive the proceedings, and knowing that his testimony was key to their case, prosecutors videotaped his testimony beforehand. The surgery was successful, and Farrar testified in person and recounted Green's problems with alcohol and the break-up of their marriage. Under cross-examination by Green's counsel, he admitted that both he and Green had contributed to {{the problems in the}} couple's marriage and that his relationship with his son had been so <b>adversarial</b> that they had sometimes come to blows.|$|E
5|$|Subject matter. First, the {{justiciability}} of {{an issue}} depends on the subject matter at hand and not the source of decision-making power. This was the principle stated in GCHQ and reiterated in Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. Where the executive has the best access to available materials, its views should be decisive or at least highly persuasive. It was acknowledged in Singapore Airlines {{that there may be}} matters of fact not in the public domain which may be known only to the executive. Where sensitive facts are concerned, Singapore's <b>adversarial</b> system is undesirable as parties must adduce evidence at a trial. Furthermore, not all pertinent facts might be presented before the court.|$|E
5|$|After {{his time}} on the Kentucky Court of Appeals, Hines {{returned}} to practicing law in Frankfort, Kentucky. In 1886, Hines began writing a series of four articles discussing the Northwest Conspiracy for Basil W. Duke's Southern Bivouac magazine. The magazine was dedicated {{to the memory of}} the Lost Cause of the Confederacy, but was less <b>adversarial</b> than similar Southern magazines, gaining a larger Northern readership than similar journals. The first of the articles was printed in the December 1886 issue. However, after consulting with former Confederate president Jefferson Davis at Davis' home in Mississippi, Hines did not name anybody on the Northern side who assisted in the conspiracy. After writing the first article, Hines was attacked for not being more forthcoming regarding all the participants from both newspapers' reviewers (particularly from the Louisville Times) and Southern readers, which discouraged Hines from publishing any more accounts of the Northwest Conspiracy.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 17th century, Maryland's economy was {{suffering}} {{from the effects of}} price fluctuations on the world market of its main cash crop, tobacco. Often in those years, the price on world markets was barely above the cost of production, leaving planters with little to show for their efforts. This affected small Protestant planters disproportionately, as many of the larger Catholic landowners had diversified economically. This growing socioeconomic inequality exacerbated underlying religious tensions. Furthermore, the new Governor, William Joseph, who arrived in the colony just before Carroll, immediately entered into an <b>adversarial</b> relationship with the Protestant-dominated lower house of the assembly. Into this powder keg came the news that England's Glorious Revolution had taken place; the Catholic King James II had been deposed and replaced with the Protestant William of Orange. In an attempt to maintain control in the colony, Governor Joseph quickly canceled the session of the colonial assembly scheduled for April 1689.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary jury {{consultants}} {{are often}} sociologists, people {{with experience in}} communications and marketing, or attorneys themselves, but they are most frequently psychologists and specialize in legal psychology. Although most of the practice's roots are in criminal trials, modern jury consultants are more often involved in torts (civil litigation), particularly where wealthy corporate defendants fear an enormous monetary judgment for the plaintiff, or where plaintiffs’ attorneys have invested {{large sums of money}} in an important lawsuit. Since the 1980s, large jury consulting and trial consulting firms have sprouted up with multi-million dollar incomes, mostly from such high-stakes civil litigation. The simultaneous shift from ad-hoc groups of academics to a business model has sparked the criticism that SJS magnifies the distorting effect money has on trials, since only the wealthy can afford it. Jury consultants argue that they operate in an <b>adversarial</b> process the same way lawyers do; by pursuing their clients' interests in a rule-bound framework. Jeffrey Abramson, who has written extensively about juries, argues that even if SJS is ethical or has zero effect, the mere myth of powerful, effective jury manipulators shakes public confidence in the jury system.|$|E
5|$|The San Francisco {{regulators}} {{finished their}} report in May 1987 and recommended that Lincoln be {{seized by the}} government due to unsound lending practices. Gray, whose time as chair was about to expire, deferred action on the report, saying that his <b>adversarial</b> relationship with Keating would make any action he took seem vindictive, and that instead the incoming chair should take over the decision. Meanwhile, Keating {{filed a lawsuit against}} the FHLBB, saying it had leaked confidential information about Lincoln. The new FHLBB chair was M. Danny Wall, who was more sympathetic to Keating and took no action on the report, saying its evidence was insufficient. In September 1987, the Lincoln investigation was removed from the San Francisco group and in May 1988, the FHLBB signed an agreement with Lincoln that included not going ahead with a criminal referral to the Department of Justice. In July 1988, a new audit of both Lincoln and American Continental began in Washington.|$|E
5|$|The direct {{participation}} of the royal and viceroyal figures in areas of governance is limited. In practice, {{their use of the}} executive powers is directed by the Cabinet, a committee of ministers of the Crown responsible to the elected House of Commons and chosen and headed by the Prime Minister of Canada (at present Justin Trudeau), the head of government. The governor general or monarch may, though, in certain crisis situations exercise their power without ministerial advice. To ensure the stability of government, the governor general will usually appoint as prime minister the person who is the current leader of the political party that can obtain the confidence of a plurality in the House of Commons. The Prime Minister's Office (PMO) is thus {{one of the most powerful}} institutions in government, initiating most legislation for parliamentary approval and selecting for appointment by the Crown, besides the aforementioned, the governor general, lieutenant governors, senators, federal court judges, and heads of Crown corporations and government agencies. The leader of the party with the second-most seats usually becomes the Leader of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition and is part of an <b>adversarial</b> parliamentary system intended to keep the government in check.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{begins in}} an {{abandoned}} warehouse, where Dean (Ackles) is attacked by the djinn that he is hunting. He suddenly finds himself {{in a world in}} which his mother (Smith) was not killed by the demon Azazel. He and his brother Sam (Jared Padalecki) were not raised to be hunters of supernatural creatures, but are no longer close, as Dean is irresponsible, disloyal, and drinks too much in this alternate reality; when a confused Dean calls him for help, Sam thinks that he is drunk. In the new reality, Dean is dating the beautiful Carmen (Michelle Borth), and Sam is at law school and engaged to Jessica (Palicki)another victim of Azazel. Although Dean enjoys his new life, a ghostly young woman seems to be haunting him and he is confronted by an image of corpses in his closet. He realizes that all the people that he and Sam had saved as hunters are now dead, that he and Sam have a distant and somewhat <b>adversarial</b> relationship. After visiting the grave of his father John, who died the previous year of a stroke, Dean decides that he must give up his new-found happiness to save them.|$|E
5|$|The novel {{has eight}} chapters, narrated {{by each of}} the three main {{characters}} in turn. Davidson narrates chapters 1, 4, and 7; Selver narrates chapters 2, 6, and 8; and Lyubov narrates chapters 3 and 5. This alternation emphasizes both the differences between the characters and their isolation within their societies. Lyubov and Davidson's chapters are narrated from a limited omniscient point of view, making their chapters seem like internal monologues. Davidson's belief in the inferiority of the Athsheans and his <b>adversarial</b> attitude towards the planet are directly presented to the reader, along with Lyubov's struggle to do his job dispassionately while following his personal morality. In contrast, Selver's chapters are written from a truly omniscient point of view, allowing Le Guin to give the reader information about the planet and its people. Selver has no extensive monologues; instead, several other Athsheans also feature prominently in his chapters.|$|E
25|$|During the Industrial Revolution, large {{corporations}} became increasingly {{opposed to this}} policy. They argued that too many valuable business relationships were being destroyed through years of expensive <b>adversarial</b> litigation, in courts whose rules differed significantly from the informal norms and conventions of businesspeople (the private law of commerce, or jus merchant). Arbitration was promoted as being faster, less <b>adversarial,</b> and cheaper.|$|E
25|$|Despite this <b>adversarial</b> relationship, Groth later {{published}} {{an issue of}} the Journal featuring a critical roundtable on the series.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationships}} with content companies were not completely <b>adversarial.</b> Some companies contacted Feingold to add their content to Plex, including music streaming service Spotify.|$|E
25|$|The Center {{provides}} {{services for}} public disputes at the state, regional, and local levels, ranging from conflicts between agencies to multi-party disputes on major policies. Its methods are mediation, negotiation, and consensus-building. It tries to reach solutions satisfying everyone while avoiding traditional <b>adversarial</b> processes.|$|E
25|$|The {{determination}} of the production and admissibility of documents under the Jencks Act is not <b>adversarial</b> in nature, but only a proceeding to discharge the responsibility to enforce the Act. It is not {{the responsibility of the}} defense to prove that the document should be produced.|$|E
25|$|Relations {{became more}} <b>adversarial</b> {{in the early}} modern and modern periods, {{although}} recent {{attempts have been made}} at rapprochement. In terms of comparative religion, there are interesting similarities especially with the Sunni, while Catholics are often noted for similarities with Shi'ites, as well as differences, in both religious approaches.|$|E
25|$|Eliminate slogans, exhortations, and {{targets for}} the work force asking for zero defects and new levels of {{productivity}}. Such exhortations only create <b>adversarial</b> relationships, as {{the bulk of the}} causes of low quality and low productivity belong to the system and thus lie beyond the power of the work force.|$|E
25|$|The embargo {{encouraged}} new venues {{for energy}} exploration including Alaska, the North Sea, the Caspian Sea, and the Caucasus. Exploration in the Caspian Basin and Siberia became profitable. Cooperation {{changed into a}} far more <b>adversarial</b> relationship as the USSR increased its production. By 1980 the Soviet Union had become the world's largest producer.|$|E
25|$|Bullying in {{the legal}} {{profession}} {{is believed to be}} more common than in some other professions. It is believed that its <b>adversarial,</b> hierarchical tradition contributes towards this. Women, trainees and solicitors who have been qualified for five years or less are more impacted, as are ethnic minority lawyers and lesbian, gay and bisexual lawyers.|$|E
25|$|Chile's {{judiciary}} {{is independent}} {{and includes a}} court of appeal, a system of military courts, a constitutional tribunal, and the Supreme Court of Chile. In June 2005, Chile completed a nationwide overhaul of its criminal justice system. The reform has replaced inquisitorial proceedings with an <b>adversarial</b> system more {{similar to that of}} the United States.|$|E
25|$|Common law courts usually use an <b>adversarial</b> system, {{in which}} two sides present their cases to a neutral judge. In contrast, civil law systems usually use an inquisitorial system in which an {{examining}} magistrate serves two roles by developing the evidence and arguments for one side {{and then the other}} during the investigation phase.|$|E
25|$|The Catholic Church {{developed}} the inquisitorial {{system in the}} Middle Ages. This judicial system features collegiate panels of judges and an investigative form of proceeding, in contradistinction to the <b>adversarial</b> system found in the common law of England and many of her former colonies, which utilises concepts such as juries and single judges.|$|E
25|$|In 1966 Kerina {{broke with}} the Herero Chiefs' Council (and by extension, NUDO) again. That same year he {{established}} the South West Africa National United Front (SWANUF) {{in an attempt}} to unite SWANU and NUDO. The attempt was unsuccessful; the two parties remained partly <b>adversarial.</b> SWANUF ceased its activities {{at the end of the}} 1970s.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that it is somewhat more sympathetic to rights-owner interests rather than user interests; for instance, by ruling to increase royalty rates under the Part VB Educational Statutory licence without a submission to this effect from either party in c.2003. This would normally be considered unusual in a common-law <b>adversarial</b> system.|$|E
25|$|Legal psychologists {{may hold}} {{advisory}} roles in court systems. They may advise legal decision makers, particularly judges, on psychological findings pertaining to {{issues in a}} case. The psychologist who acts as a court adviser provides similar input to one acting as an expert witness, but acts out of the domain of an <b>adversarial</b> system.|$|E
25|$|Sides was {{promoted}} to rear admiral in 1952 {{as director of the}} guided-missile division {{in the office of the}} chief of naval operations. In that role, he directed the Navy's entire guided-missile program for almost four years, and played an influential and initially <b>adversarial</b> role in the development of the Polaris fleet ballistic missile (FBM).|$|E
25|$|First {{instance}} {{in cases of}} absence of acknowledgment of responsibility: The section would take cognizance of the charges laid by the Investigation and Prosecution Unit, proceed with an <b>adversarial</b> trial for those cases where responsibility has not been acknowledged and, when appropriate, render judgment and imposing alternative or ordinary sanctions when necessary.|$|E
25|$|The party's {{original}} {{support base}} consisted of voters alienated by perceived unproductive <b>adversarial</b> {{conflict between the}} two mainstream parties and an emerging new constituency of people {{with a desire to}} participate more effectively in government and to promote concerns for environmental protection and social justice. The party aimed to combine liberal social policies with centrist, particularly neo-Keynesian economics and a progressive environmental platform.|$|E
25|$|The Broken Compass: How British Politics Lost its Way is {{the fourth}} book by British traditionalist {{conservative}} writer Peter Hitchens, published in May 2009. Polemical and partly autobiographical, the book contends that the British political right and left no longer hold firm, <b>adversarial</b> beliefs, but vie for position in the centre, {{while at the same}} time overseeing a general decline in British society.|$|E
25|$|Original scriptures of the Ājīvika {{school of}} {{philosophy}} once existed, {{but these are}} unavailable and probably lost. Their theories are extracted from mentions of Ājīvikas in the secondary sources of ancient Indian literature. Scholars question whether Ājīvika philosophy has been fairly and completely summarized in these secondary sources, written by ancient Buddhist and Jaina scholars, who represented competing and <b>adversarial</b> philosophies to Ājīvikas.|$|E
25|$|The Sixth Amendment {{guarantees}} {{a defendant}} {{a right to}} counsel in all criminal prosecutions. The purposes of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel are to protect a defendant’s right {{to a fair trial}} and to assure that our <b>adversarial</b> system of justice functions properly by providing competent counsel as an advocate for the defendant in his contest against the “prosecutorial forces” of the state.|$|E
25|$|The {{process is}} not {{intended}} to be entirely negative, with States able to highlight in their reports progress which has been made examples of good practices. The process also allows for evaluation of internal structures of implementation and identification of further assistance the state may require. The mechanism provides an opportunity for constructive dialogue {{between the state and the}} committee rather than acting as <b>adversarial</b> proceedings.|$|E
25|$|Union leaders saw {{nationalisation}} as a {{means to}} pursue a more advantageous position within a framework of continued conflict, rather than as an opportunity to replace the old <b>adversarial</b> form of industrial relations. Moreover, most workers in nationalised industries exhibited an essentially instrumentalist attitude, favouring public ownership because it secured job security and improved wages rather than because it promised {{the creation of a new}} set of socialists relationships in the workplace.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} the tit-for-tat strategy, which is largely {{cooperative}} despite that its name emphasizes an <b>adversarial</b> nature, took many by surprise. Arrayed against strategies produced by various teams it won in two competitions. After the first competition, new strategies formulated specifically to combat tit-for-tat failed due to their negative interactions with each other; a successful strategy other than tit-for-tat {{would have had to}} be formulated with both tit-for-tat and itself in mind.|$|E
25|$|The Faculty of Law {{focuses on}} Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) {{as opposed to}} a more <b>adversarial</b> approach. As well as {{offering}} graduates their Bachelor of Laws (LLB), if students elect to take Commercial Transactions as well as Mediation: Laws, Principles and Practice, they may also apply for Associate status with the Arbitrators and Mediators Institute of New Zealand (AMINZ). This gives them professional status when conducting these activities and is globally recognised.|$|E
