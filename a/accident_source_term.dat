These <b>source</b> <b>terms</b> have been derived using nonparametric order statistics to develop distributions for the timing of radionuclide release during four accident phases and for release fractions of nine chemical classes of radionuclides as calculated with the MELCOR 1. 8. 5 accident analysis computer code. The accident phases are those defined in the NUREG- 1465 <b>Source</b> <b>Term</b> - gap release, in-vessel release, ex-vessel release, and late in-vessel release.

Heat losses from the degrading reactor core prolong the process of in-vessel release of radionuclides. Improved understanding of the chemistries of tellurium and cesium under reactor accidents changes the predicted behavior characteristics of these radioactive elements relative to what was assumed in the derivation of the NUREG- 1465 <b>Source</b> <b>Term.</b> An additional radionuclide chemical class has been defined to account for release of cesium as cesium molybdate which enhances molybdenum release relative to other metallic fission products...|$|R

40|$|The risks {{associated}} with the transport of spent nuclear fuel by truck and rail have been reexamined and compared to results published in NUREG-O 170 and the Modal Study. The full reexamination considered transport of PWR and BWR spent fuel by truck and rail in four generic Type B spent fuel casks. Because they are typical, this paper presents results only for transport of PWR spent fuel in steel-lead steel casks. Cask and spent fuel response to collision impacts and fires were evaluated by performing three-dimensional finite element and one-dimensional heat transport calculations. Accident release fractions were developed by critical review of literature data. Accident severity fractions were developed from Modal Study truck and rail accident event trees, modified to reflect the frequency of occurrence of hard and soft rock wayside route surfaces as determined by analysis of geographic data. Incident-free population doses and the population dose {{risks associated}} with the accidents that might occur during transport were calculated using the RADTRAN 5 transportation risk code. The calculated incident-free doses were compared to those published in NUREG-O 170. The calculated accident dose risks were compared to dose risks calculated using NUREG- 0170 and Modal Study <b>accident</b> <b>source</b> <b>terms.</b> The comparisons demonstrated that both of these studies {{made a number of}} very conservative assumptions about spent fuel and cask response to accident conditions, which caused their estimates of <b>accident</b> <b>source</b> <b>terms,</b> <b>accident</b> frequencies, and accident consequences to also be very conservative.

Two methods were used to collect particulate with the goal of preserving the particle size distribution and physical characteristics of the particulate. Choice of collection technique is important because the sampling method used can bias the particle size distribution collected. Vacuum collection on substrates and adhesion removal with metallurgical replicating tape were chosen as non-intrusive sampling methods.

Towards quantifying the aerosol deposition under varying flow conditions and thermal gradients, as may be encountered in the heat transport systems, experiments were performed to investigate the dry deposition behavior of metal oxide aerosols in a 3. 6 m long stainless steel piping test assembly. This assembly consisted of divergent and convergent sections, horizontal and vertical sections and right angle bends. Tin oxide aerosols, generated by a plasma torch aerosol generator, were transported into the test assembly using argon carrier gas. Temperature sensors coupled to data loggers were used to record the pipe inner wall and carrier gas temperatures. The experimental deposition results {{were found to be}} within 8 % of those estimated by the SOPHAEROS module of the accident analysis code ASTEC (<b>Accident</b> <b>Source</b> <b>Term</b> Evaluation Code). Code results for experimental input parameters showed that for sections at higher temperature gradients the dominant deposition mechanism was thermophoresis, while in sections for low thermal gradients, gravitational settling dominated. The micrographs obtained using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) showed that the deposited Tin oxide particles were mostly spherical and bimodal in nature.

Its current uses include the estimation of severe <b>accident</b> <b>source</b> <b>terms</b> and their sensitivities and uncertainties {{in a variety of}} applications. Independent assessment efforts have been successfully completed by the US and international MELCOR user communities. Most of these independent assessment efforts have been conducted to support the needs and fulfill the requirements of the individual user organizations. The resources required to perform an extensive set of model and integral code assessments are large. A prudent approach to fostering code development and maturation is to coordinate the individual assessment efforts of the MELCOR user community. While retaining individual control over assessment resources, each organization using the MELCOR code could work with the other users to broaden assessment coverage and minimize duplication. In recognition of these considerations, the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (US NRC) has initiated the MELCOR Cooperative Assessment Program (MCAP), a vehicle for coordinating and standardizing the assessment practices of the various MELCOR users.

Single-point energy calculations are performed with the highly correlated ab initio coupled cluster method {{in the space of}} single, double, and triple (pertubatively) electron excitations CCSD(T) using the cc-pVTZ, cc-pVQZ, 6 - 311 +G(3 df, 2 p), and 6 - 311 ++G(3 df, 3 pd) basis sets. Reaction enthalpies at 0 K were calculated at the CCSD(T) /cc-pVnZ//MP 2 /cc-pVTZ (n = T and Q), CCSD(T) / 6 - 311 +G(3 df, 2 p) //MP 2 / 6 - 311 G(d,p), and CCSD(T) / 6 - 311 ++G(3 df, 3 pd) //MP 2 / 6 - 311 G(d,p) levels of theory and compared to the experimental values taken from the literature. Canonical transition-state theory with an Eckart tunneling correction is used to predict the rate constants as a function of temperature. The computational procedure has been used to predict rate constants for H-abstraction elementary reactions because there are actually no literature data to which the calculated rate constants can be directly compared. The final objective is to implement kinetics of gaseous reactions in the ASTEC (<b>accident</b> <b>source</b> <b>term</b> evaluation code) program to improve speciation of fission products, which can be transported along the reactor coolant system (RCS) of a pressurized water reactor (PWR) {{in the case of a}} severe accident. © 2011 American Chemical Society...|$|E
40|$|The {{reconstruction}} of the Chernobyl <b>accident</b> <b>source</b> <b>term</b> has been previously carried out using core inventories, but also back and forth confrontations between model simulations and activity concentration or deposited activity measurements. The approach {{presented in this paper}} is based on inverse modelling techniques. It relies both on the activity concentration measurements and on the adjoint of a chemistry-transport model. The location of the release is assumed to be known, and one is looking for a source term available for long-range transport that depends both on time and altitude. The method relies on the maximum entropy on the mean principle and exploits source positivity. The inversion results are mainly sensitive to two tuning parameters, a mass scale and the scale of the prior errors in the inversion. To overcome this hardship, we resort to the statistical L-curve method to estimate balanced values for these two parameters. Once this is done, many of the retrieved features of the source are robust within a reasonable range of parameter values. Our results favour the acknowledged three-step scenario, with a strong initial release (26 to 27 April), followed by a weak emission period of four days (28 April&ndash; 1 May) and again a release, longer but less intense than the initial one (2 May&ndash; 6 May). The retrieved quantities of iodine- 131, caesium- 134 and caesium- 137 that have been released are in good agreement with the latest reported estimations. Yet, a stronger apportionment of the total released activity is ascribed to the first period and less to the third one. Finer chronological details are obtained, such as a sequence of eruptive episodes in the first two days, likely related to the modulation of the boundary layer diurnal cycle. In addition, the first two-day release surges are found to have effectively reached an altitude {{up to the top of}} the domain (5000 m) ...|$|E
40|$|Accidental {{analyses}} {{are essential for}} the safety assessment of future fusion nuclear plants. These analyses rely {{on the availability of}} validated numerical codes able to provide robust and credible results for the main safety issues relevant for the plant licensing such as the accidents that may lead to the loss of containment integrity and to their potential consequences. Fusion plants differ from fission ones mainly from the ultra-high vacuum operating conditions of the first containment barrier (the plasma chamber), and for the high amount and volatility of tritium. In nuclear fission and fusion context, the Enel Code for Analysis of Radionuclide Transport (ECART) has been employed in several safety analyses and validated by means of “ad hoc” experimental data [1]. The same occurs for the <b>Accident</b> <b>Source</b> <b>Term</b> Evaluation Code (ASTEC) currently developed by the Institut de Radioprotection et de Sûreté Nucléaire (IRSN), but mainly applied in nuclear fission plants safety analysis. Compared to ECART, ASTEC benefited to limited validation efforts on fusion reactor accident analyses. As a consequence, the confidence on ASTEC simulation may gain from benchmarking activities against other codes, and notably to ECART. The goal of the present analysis is to compare the results of the two mentioned codes referring to a specific accidental sequence, previously investigated in detail by ECART during the design phases that followed the ITER Generic Site Safety Report (GSSR). The considered Postulated Initiating Event (PIE) is an in-vessel LOCA initiated by a double break in the divertor cooling loop. Then, the consequent dusts and tritium gas transport from the Vacuum Vessel (VV) to the Neutral Beam Injector (NBI) box, contaminating the NBI internal volume. The focus of this code-to-code comparison is to analyze the similarities and the differences between ASTEC and ECART on the prediction of the pressurization of the VV and the connected relief volumes, and on the transport of dusts (Tungsten (W), Beryllium (Be)) and tritium gas eventually mobilized towards the NBI-BOX...|$|E
