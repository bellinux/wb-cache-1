40|$|AbstractBackground and purpose: Von Willebrand Disease (VWD) type 1, is {{the most}} common {{inherited}} bleeding disorder caused by defect in Von Willebrand Factor (VWF) gene with 178000 nucleotide length. Different methods are available to detect unknown mutations in a genetic study. The fluorescent conformation sensitive gel electrophoresis (F-CSGE) was designed for the VWF gene by using fluorescent dyes in this study and two methods of CSGE (manual and fluorescent) were compared to detect VWF gene mutations. Materials and methods : The VWF gene in 7 index cases with type 1 VWD and one normal control were amplified using 52 exons, exon-intron boundaries and 3 ’ region of the gene using 56 different PCR. The PCR fragments were analyzed using both manual and fluorescent CSGE and the fragments with bandshifts were sequenced. Results : In total, there were 125 PCR fragments with bandshift using F-CSGE and 101 fragments with bandshift using M-CSGE. Five different mutations were identified using both techniques including three new mutations, glycine 19 to <b>argenine</b> (G 19 R) in exon 2, <b>Argenine</b> 1315 to histidine (R 1315 H) in exon 28, cystin 2304 to lysine(C 2304 Y) in exon 40 and two known mutations,prolin 1266 to Lysine (P 1266 L) and Serine 1285 to Prolin (S 1285 P) in exon 28. In addition, 45 different polymorphisms were detected using F-CSGE and 39 were detected using M-CSGE. Also 192 different PCR fragments were analyzed in each run using F-CSGE and maximum 40 samples were analyzed using M-CSGE. Conclusion: Although F-CSGE is more time consuming and more expensive than M-CSGE, but it is a rapid, more sensitive and high-throughput method to identify unknown mutations in VWF gene compared with M-CSGE...|$|E

It is morphologically {{very similar to}} Carabdytes upin upin Balke et al., 1992, known from eastern Indonesian Papua eastward to the western limits of the Papuan Peninsula of Papua New Guinea. For 726 bp at the 3 ’ end of the mitochondrial cox 1 gene, the subspecies differ by 8. 1 – 9. 2 % uncorrected p-distance. However, we also document considerable cox 1 divergence within Carabdytes upin upin. We find few diagnostic positions in the nuclear genes <b>argenine</b> kinase as well as elongation factor 1 alpha that suggest there are indeed two isolated groups of Carabdytes, but evidence in elongation factor 1 alpha is not unambiguous. We decided to highlight this phenomenon of ambiguous evidence for ongoing/just attained speciation by describing a subspecies. We argue that such cases are actually common once mitochondrial sequence data are routinely added to the taxonomist’s toolkit, and sometimes simply adding data from few nuclear genes will not suffice the solve taxonomic riddles.

40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} direct effects of NO modulation on protective electrophysiological properties of atrioventricular node (AV node) in the experimental model of AF in rabbit. Methods: Isolated perfused rabbit AV nodal preparations were used in two groups. In the first group (N= 7), LNAME (50 μM) was applied. In the second group (N= 12), different concentrations of L - <b>argenine</b> (250 μM - 5000 μM) were added to the solution. Programmed stimulation protocols were used to quantify AV nodal conduction time, refractoriness and zone of concealment. AF protocol was executed by software with coupling intervals (ranging from 75 – 125 msec). Results: L-NAME had depressive effects on basic AV nodal properties. L-Arginine (250 μM) had direct inhibitory effects on nodal conduction time, Wenckebach and refractoriness. Significant increases in the number of concealed beats were induced by L-Arginine (500 μM). Number of concealed beats were increased from 700. 7 ± 33. 7 to 763 ± 21 msec (P< 0. 05). Trend of zone of concealment prolongation in a frequency-dependent model was abrogated by Larginine (250, 5000 μM). Conclusion: NO at low concentration (in the presence of L-NAME) had facilitatory role on AV nodal properties, but at high concentration (in the presence of L-arginine) enhanced protective role of AV node during AF. Biphasic modulatory role of NO may affect protective behavior of AV node during AF. © 2011, Iranian Society of Physiology and Pharmacology. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Somatostatin is a 14 {{amino acid}} peptide that {{inhibits}} pancreatic exocrine and endocrine secretion. Its clinical application {{has been limited}} by its very short half life, necessitating continuous intravenous infusion. Octreotide is an 8 amino acid synthetic analogue of somatostatin that possesses similar pharmacological effects. It has a much longer duration of action, however, and can be given subcutaneously. Both the intravenous and subcutaneous routes of injection of octreotide are well tolerated. Peak serum concentrations occur within 30 minutes after subcutaneous administration and within four minutes of a three minute intravenous infusion. Serum concentration increases linearly with dose. Octreotide is distributed rapidly, mainly in the plasma, where it is 65 % protein bound. The elimination half life is about 1. 5 hours and about 32 % of a subcutaneous dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged octreotide. Octreotide inhibits gastroenteropancreatic secretion, especially of insulin, glucagon, pancreatic polypeptide, gastric inhibitory polypeptide, and gastrin. It also inhibits both release of thyroid stimulating hormone and growth hormone secretion in response to exercise, insulin induced hypoglycaemia, and <b>argenine</b> stimulation. Octreotide reduces splanchnic blood flow in healthy volunteers and hepatic venous pressure in cirrhotic patients. It can accelerate or delay gastric emptying, prolong transit time at moderate to high doses, stimulate motility at low doses, and inhibit gall bladder emptying. Octreotide considerably inhibits pentagastrin stimulated gastric acid secretion and significantly diminishes exocrine pancreatic function (amylase, trypsin, lipase). Octreotide increases intestinal transit time and decreases endogenous fluid secretion in the jejunum and ileum, thus increasing the absorption of water and electrolytes.

40|$|AbstractDe-oiled {{groundnut}} oil cake (GOC) was bio-processed through solid state fermentation (SSF) for 15 days at 34 ± 1 °C by a tannase producing yeast, Pichia kudriavzevii (GU 939629) {{isolated from the}} gut of a freshwater carp, Cirrhinus cirrhosus. SSF of GOC was effective in significantly (P< 0. 05) reducing crude fibre content and antinutritional factors (e. g., tannin, phytic acid and trypsin inhibitor), whereas enhancing crude protein, lipid, ash, total free amino acids and fatty acids. Bio-processing revealed {{significant increase in the}} levels of <b>argenine,</b> histidine, isoleusine, lysine, methyonine and threonine in the GOC. Eight isonitrogenous (37. 5 %) and isocaloric (18. 8 kJg− 1) experimental diets were prepared incorporating raw (R 1 –R 4) and fermented (F 1 –F 4) GOC at 20 %, 30 %, 40 % and 50 % levels by weight replacing fishmeal and other feed ingredients into a fishmeal-based reference diet (RD) and fed to rohu, Labeo rohita, fingerlings (initial weight 3. 24 ± 0. 11 g) for 80 days. In general, diets with SSF-processed GOC produced significantly better performance than the raw GOC in terms of growth, feed utilization, nutrient digestibility, carcass composition and digestive enzyme activity. Rohu fingerlings fed the diet F 3 containing 40 % fermented GOC resulted in best performance in terms of weight gain (final weight 7. 08 ± 0. 06 g), specific growth rate (% day− 1), protein efficiency ratio and apparent net protein utilization. Highest protein (14. 93 ± 0. 51 %) and lipid deposition in the carcass were also recorded in the group of fish reared on diet F 3. In comparison to the FM based reference diet, the present study explored the possibility of replacing 45 – 55 % of FM through incorporation of 40 – 50 % (w/w) SSF-processed GOC in the diets for rohu fingerlings...|$|E
40|$|Magnetic {{tweezers}} {{have been}} designed, constructed, calibrated and 'applied, {{for the first}} time, {{to the study of}} the mechanical properties of fibrin clots. Three-dimensional control over magnetic particle position was achieved with forces of '' 100 pN in X,Y and ''IOpN in Z, generated with 4. 5 JLm Ã‚Â·particles. Software was custom written to control both the operation of the electromagnets and data analysis of the-captured images. The performance of the magnetic tweezers was initially evaluated using model viscous and viscoelastic materials such as polyacrylamide, and was used to demonstrate that the viscosity of complex fluids such as protein solutions could be measured. The calibrated magnetic tweezers were then applied {{to the study of the}} viscoelastic properties of fibrin clot formation using recombinant and purified fibrinogen in collaboration with colleagues in the Leeds General Infirmary. The behaviour of wild type fibrinogen was compared with three variants, each of which had particular physiological releyance. Initial results revealed a Hookean response of the fibrin clots at low forces, strain hardening at higher forces, and an increase to a maximum value of G' over time. Des-B,BI- 42, which is created by the enzymatic action of rattlesnake venom, showed a marked reduction in mechanical strength compared with wild type fibrin, and this was related to thinner fibrin fibres by atomic force microscopy studies and turbidity measurements. The polymorphism. B,BArg 448 Lys, a relatively common variant with a frequency of 10 - 15 % in Caucasians, possesses an <b>argenine</b> to lysine substitution in the,B-chain region, 13 amino acids away from the carboxyl-terminal. A marked increase in clot stiffness was observed for the 448 Lys variant compared to the 448 Arg type, in agreement with known links between,B-chain polymorphisms and coronary heart disease. Addition of the crosslinker factor XIII increased clot stiffness in both fibrin types, with increases in Lys 448 clot stiffness continuing after several hours. Fibrinogen samples from patients with type 1 diabetes taken before and after treatment were studied to investigate possible links between the patient's blood sugar control and clotting functions. A k~y symptom of dia betes is an increased level of clot stiffness, increasing the risk of myocardial infarction. Results reveal~ a positive correlation between improvements in sugar control and reductions in clot stiffness. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|The {{metalloenzyme}} Escherichia coli (E. coli) Alkaline Phosphatase (AP) has a homo-dimeric quaternary structure, {{which is}} essential for the enzyme to achieve its catalytic activity, the acceleration of phos- phoester hydrolysis. Employing computational approaches, at differ- ent levels of complexity and sophistication, this thesis aims at under- standing the interplay of structure, dynamics and function of this im- portant enzyme, that is responsible for the supply of vital inorganic phosphate. At low resolution, coarse grained models of the enzyme are con- structed, using an Elastic Network Model (ENM), to explain the in- fluence of the global dynamics, defined by the quaternary structure of the enzyme, on its functionality. Comparative analysis of the col- lective motions, of individual subunits within a homo-dimer of apo and holo enzymes, allows us to interpret the experimental proposal of negative cooperativity. The intrinsic asymmetry of the subunits within the dimer, is already encoded in the enzymes three-dimensional structure, as becomes apparent from the normal mode analysis of the low resolution ENMs, with alternate opening and closing motions present in only one subunit at a time. These results, in conjunction with the analysis of Molecular Dynam- ics (MD) simulations of the atomistic models, at the nanosecond time scale, suggest a mechanical coupling between the correlated motions of individual subunits and their active sites, via the dimer interface. The negative cooperativity of the subunits is further explained by the analysis of multiple, independent MD simulations that reveals subtle differences in the hydrogen bonding network of the subunits and dy- namics of their active site residues, demonstrating a distinct asymmet- ric behaviour, with increased flexibility of one subunit versus rigidity of a second one. Information about structural changes is transmitted between the subunits via the hydrogen bonding network across the in- terface. At least two such communication pathways can be proposed, based on the analysis of MD simulations, both via the interfacial alpha- helix containing residues T 559 and T 555 that are hydrogen bonded to the residue N 416, which is in turn, connected to the residues in the active site. Analysis of the MD simulations confirms that, while the active site of one subunit retains the inorganic phosphate product, as demon- strated by the small changes in the distances between the active site residues, another subunit is "letting the product go" {{in order to make the}} active site available for another turnover of substrate binding. ￼vii Analyses of the MD simulations further suggest that correlated mo- tions of the monomeric subunits of the dimer, as well as the dynamics, and hence the architecture of the active sites, play an important role in the functionality of Alkaline Phosphatase. Although each subunit of the enzyme is equipped with its own catalytic sites, a monomeric AP does not exist in nature and the engineered mutants have significantly reduced activity. Due to the absence of a crystal structure, a model of a monomeric form of the enzyme is constructed based on the crys- tal structure of the apo dimer. In addition, a T 59 R mutant is built, where interface residues T 59 and T 559 are substituted by a bulky and charged <b>Argenine</b> residues. Experimental evidence suggests that such a substitution destabilizes the dimeric interface, resulting in a separation into isolated monomers, with reduced structural stability and catalytic activity. Our MD simulation results confirm that the over- all dynamic behaviour of the monomer is different from that of the corresponding dimer and resembles more that of the T 59 R mutant. Furthermore, comparative analysis based on MD simulations of di- meric and monomeric forms of AP reveals important structural and dynamic features enabling the native dimer to be catalytically func- tional. The stabilisation provided by the interface of the two subunits in the dimeric form of AP is found to be essential for a catalytically competent structure of the active sites. Breaking of the hydrogen bond between residues Y 402 and D 330, that are located near the active site, as observed in the MD simulations of the monomer, results in the incorrect positioning of the catalytically important, divalent, zinc ion. Understanding the nature of the correlated motions of the subunits within the dimer, and their connection to the enzyme’s activity is an important step in completing our knowledge on structure-dynamics- function relationship of E. coli Alkaline Phosphatase and related en- zymes. Our findings confirm that the structural stability of dimeric AP, provided by the hydrogen bonding network across the interface, {{is essential for}} the enzymatic activity. By a combination of different computational approaches, we gained an in-depth understanding of the relationship between the enzymes’ dimeric quaternary structure and its functionality...|$|E
