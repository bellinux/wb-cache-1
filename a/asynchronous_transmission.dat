The medium access control (MAC) provides a HARQ protocol where the source node, upon a decoding failure at the destination node, transmits additional coded bits for the same data packet. If a neighbor node is able to decode the first transmission, it cooperates with the source by sending additional coded bits.

50|$|The USART's {{synchronous}} capabilities {{were primarily}} intended to support synchronous protocols like IBM's Synchronous transmit-receive (STR), Binary Synchronous Communications (BSC), Synchronous Data Link Control (SDLC), and the ISO-standard High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC) synchronous link-layer protocols, which were used with synchronous voice-frequency modems. These protocols {{were designed to}} make the best use of bandwidth when modems were analog devices. In those times, the fastest asynchronous voice-band modem could achieve at most speeds of 300 bit/s using frequency-shift keying modulation, while synchronous modems could run at speeds up to 9600 bit/s using phase-shift keying. Synchronous transmission used only slightly over 80% of the bandwidth of the now more-familiar <b>asynchronous</b> <b>transmission,</b> since start and stop bits were unnecessary. Those modems are obsolete, having been replaced by modems which convert asynchronous data to synchronous forms, but similar synchronous telecommunications protocols survive in numerous block-oriented technologies such as the widely used IEEE 802.2 (Ethernet) link-level protocol. USARTs are still sometimes integrated with MCUs.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{differential}} Space-Time Coding (STC) scheme designed for asynchronous cooperative networks, where neither channel estimation nor symbol-level synchronization is required at the cooperating nodes. More specifically, our system employs differential encoding during the broadcast phase and a Space-Time Spreading (STS) -based amplify-and-forward scheme during the cooperative phase {{in conjunction with}} interference rejection Direct Sequence (DS) spreading codes, namely Loosely Synchronized (LS) codes. The LS codes exhibit a so-called Interference Free Window (IFW), where both the auto-correlation and cross-correlation values of the codes become zero. The IFW allows us to eliminate both the Multi-User Interference (MUI) {{as well as the}} potential dispersion-induced orthogonality degradation of the cooperative space-time codeword and the interference imposed by the <b>asynchronous</b> <b>transmissions</b> of the relay nodes.
