5|$|Cannon {{were first}} used abroad by the English during the Hundred Years War, when {{primitive}} artillery was {{used at the}} Battle of Crécy. With the Age of Discovery {{and the establishment of}} the Thirteen Colonies, cannon saw use in British armies in North <b>America,</b> <b>first</b> against the rival colony of New France, and later during the American Revolutionary War. From the 18th century to the present day, the Royal Regiment of Artillery has formed the artillery of the British Army. The Royal Navy developed the carronade in the 18th century, although they disappeared from use in the 1850s. As with other western cannon of the period, cannon used by the British Army and the Royal Navy became longer ranged and more destructive in the 19th and 20th centuries.|$|E

5|$|Chronic wasting disease, {{transmitted}} by a misfolded protein {{known as a}} prion, affects the brain tissue in elk, and has been detected throughout their range in North <b>America.</b> <b>First</b> documented in the late 1960s in mule deer, the disease has affected elk on game farms and in the wild {{in a number of}} regions. Elk that have contracted the disease begin to show weight loss, increased watering needs, disorientation and listlessness, and at an advanced stage the disease leads to death. The disease is similar to but not the same as mad cow disease, and no risks to humans have been documented, nor has the disease been demonstrated to pose a threat to domesticated cattle. In 2002, South Korea banned the importation of elk antler velvet due to concerns about chronic wasting disease.|$|E
5|$|Moore {{along with}} <b>America</b> <b>First</b> {{chairman}} Jonathan M. Hill appeared on Al Jazeera English, discussing strategic development plans for third {{parties in the}} United States. The broadcast was viewed by over 100 million viewers worldwide. He also made two appearances on Fox News, first on the TV special The Rescue Rumble and later on Your World, both shows were hosted by Neil Cavuto. He later appeared as a guest on the Comedy Central TV series The Colbert Report, a news satire show about modern American politics. According to Moore, the decision to have him on the show came from Stephen Colbert, the current host for the TV series. A spokeswoman from Comedy Central {{would not comment on}} the motives behind the selection. Moore also wrote several articles in The Nation, The New Republic and National Journal, and the newspapers The St. Petersburg Times, The Los Angeles Times and the Chicago Tribune. The {{question of whether or not}} Barack Obama was a socialist, led to an increased interest in Moore during the election. The Left Party, a Swedish democratic socialist political party, officially endorsed Moore for president during a televised debate in Sweden.|$|E
5|$|The Lost Levels {{was first}} {{released}} in Japan for the Famicom Disk System as Super Mario Bros. 2 on June 3, 1986, following {{the success of}} its predecessor. It was developed by Nintendo R—the team led by Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto—and designed for players who had mastered the original. Nintendo of America deemed the title too difficult for its North American audience and instead chose another game as the region's Super Mario Bros. 2: a retrofitted version of the Japanese Doki Doki Panic. North <b>America</b> <b>first</b> experienced The Lost Levels, as the Japanese sequel became known, in the 1993 Super Nintendo Entertainment System compilation Super Mario All-Stars. It was later ported to the Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, and Virtual Console (Wii, Nintendo 3DS, and Wii U).|$|E

25|$|In April 1939, the Lindberghs {{returned}} to the United States.

25|$|By 1940, {{only a small}} {{committed}} core {{remained in}} the Socialist Party, including a considerable percentage of militant pacifists. The SP continued to oppose Franklin D.

In 1940 Norman Thomas was the only presidential candidate who failed to support rearmament military support of Great Britain and China. The pacifist Thomas also served as an active spokesman for the isolationist <b>America</b> <b>First</b> Committee during 1941.|$|E

25|$|Many conservatives, {{especially}} in the Midwest, in 1939–41 favored isolationism and opposed American entry into World War II—and so did some liberals. (see <b>America</b> <b>First</b> Committee). Conservatives in the East and South were generally interventionist, as typified by Henry Stimson. However, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in Dec. 1941 united all Americans behind the war effort, with conservatives in Congress taking the opportunity to close down many New Deal agencies, such as the bête noire WPA.|$|E

25|$|The Pearl Harbor advance-knowledge {{conspiracy}} theory {{is the argument}} that U.S. Government officials had advance knowledge of Japan's December 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor. Ever since the Japanese attack there has been debate as to {{how and why the}} United States had been caught off guard, and how much and when American officials knew of Japanese plans for an attack. In September 1944, John T. Flynn, a co-founder of the non-interventionist <b>America</b> <b>First</b> Committee, launched Pearl Harbor revisionism when he published a forty-six page booklet entitled The Truth about Pearl Harbor.|$|E
