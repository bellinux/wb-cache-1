The absurdity of <b>a</b> crying <b>iron</b> is only the first layer of meaning, the second relating to a woman trapped under the weight of household duties.|$|R

5|$|By the 5thcentury, the Romans had {{withdrawn}} from Britain, and the Angles and the Saxons settled. A heptarchy of new kingdoms began to emerge. One {{of the methods}} used by regional kings to solidify their authority over their territories {{was the use of}} ceremony and insignia. The tomb of an unknown king– evidence suggests it may be Rædwald of East Anglia– at Sutton Hoo provides insight into the regalia of a pre-Christian Anglo-Saxon king. Inside the early 7th-century tomb discovered in 1939 was found the ornate Sutton Hoo helmet, comprising <b>an</b> <b>iron</b> cap, a neck guard, and a face mask, decorated with images of animals and warriors in copper-alloy and set with garnets. He was also buried with a heavy whetstone sceptre, on top of which is <b>an</b> <b>iron</b> ring surmounted by the figure of a stag; a decorated sword; and a ceremonial shield.|$|E

5|$|Epiacum {{was built}} {{early in the}} 2nd century. It was at least partly {{demolished}} and rebuilt around 200; the destruction coincides with an uprising of the northern tribes in 196.

5|$|For a few limited {{purposes}} {{when it is}} needed, {{pure iron}} is produced in the laboratory in small quantities by reducing the pure oxide or hydroxide with hydrogen, or forming iron pentacarbonyl and heating it to 250°C so that it decomposes to form pure iron powder.
