500|$|Despite its {{otherwise}} enthusiastic reception by critics, Game of Thrones {{has been}} criticized for the amount of female nudity, violence, and sexual violence (especially against women) it depicts, and for {{the manner in which it}} depicts these themes. The Atlantic called the series' [...] "tendency to ramp up the sex, violence, and—especially—sexual violence" [...] of the source material [...] "the defining weakness" [...] of the adaptation. George R. R. Martin responded that he feels obliged to be truthful about history and human nature, and that rape and sexual violence are common in war; and that omitting them from the narrative would have rung false and undermined one of his novels' themes, its historical realism. HBO said that they [...] "fully support the vision and artistry of Dan and David’s exceptional work <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> this work speaks for itself." ...|$|E

The game was directed by Toshio Akiyama and produced by Takashi Tokita. [...] Character designs were provided by Akira Oguro while the in-game 2D dot versions were created by Kazuko Shibuya. Takashi Tokita explained the game was meant to transcend the expectations of RPGs in cellphones. The team set the theme of a scenario of creating another game for the SNES. The team also added several references to previous games such as Sarah and Matoya being references to the original Final Fantasy game and Dusk and Alba being reminiscent of Palom and Porom from Final Fantasy IV. When asked about the high pricing for the game, the team explained their reasons stating, [...] "This title offers about 50 hours of gameplay, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> that our community can enjoy the contents of this game as much as they would a console title. Also, we have set the price where it is because this title was developed specifically for the mobile platform, as opposed to just being a port of an older console or handheld game." [...] When developing the smartphone version, Takashi Tokita changed the structure of selling a group of episodes rather than individually.|$|E

2500|$|Supporters {{of the ban}} {{state that}} boxing is the only sport where hurting the other athlete is the goal.

[...] Opponents respond that such a position is misguided opinion, stating that amateur boxing is scored solely according to total connecting blows with no award for [...] "injury". They observe that many skilled professional boxers have had rewarding careers without inflicting injury on opponents by accumulating scoring blows and avoiding punches winning rounds scored 10-9 by the 10-point must system, and they note that there are many other sports where concussions are much more prevalent.|$|E

2500|$|The A-League has two trophies {{which are}} competed for during the season: the Premier's Plate and the A-League Trophy. The Premier's Plate is {{awarded to the}} A-League Premiers, the regular season winners, and the A-League Trophy is awarded to the A-League Champions, {{the winner of the}} Grand Final. Both pieces of {{silverware}} were designed by Sydney design company D3 Design. The A-League Trophy is nicknamed the [...] "Toilet Seat" [...] due to its shape. Where as the Premier's Plate follows a traditional trophy design, the A-League Trophy differs. In 2005, John O'Neill, FFA CEO commented during the unveiling of the A-League Trophy, [...] "We have a new national league <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> it is important to re-define the conventional view of a trophy to reflect this". Clive Solari of D3 Design explained the trophy's design, saying [...] "We wanted our trophy concept to embody the historical significance of sport in a contemporary design. So we looked to history to see how great achievements have been rewarded across all types of games for thousands of years. The winners of the world's original sporting competition, the Olympic Games, were presented with a laurel wreath on their heads. We used this model as a basis for a unique, cutting-edge design – our trophy is a modern and versatile translation of the wreath.

[...] Frontman Brad Simpson also referred to McFly when asked about influences, stating [...] "Their debut album was a first in all of our collections". The band credited their support slot as providing an opportunity to observe the band's skills for their own development. Simpson said [...] "How to provide more energy to our performance and move around the stage was a massive one...McFly have been doing it for years and the little things we picked up have really improved our live performance." [...] McVey also referred to the band's influence on performances by the Vamps, stating [...] "Before I had seen them in concert, I would never have performed as we do now." [...] The Vamps have covered several songs by McFly in a series of YouTube videos including Love Is Easy, performed alongside Fletcher's sister Carrie Hope Fletcher, [...] "That Girl", filmed as a recreation of the music video including appearances from Poynter, and finally [...] "Five Colours in Her Hair", which featured on the digital EP for their second single [...] "Wild Heart". Their debut album, Meet the Vamps featured the song [...] "High Hopes" [...] which was co-written by Fletcher, Jones and Poynter and produced by Jones.

2500|$|In {{the chapter}} [...] "Analytic of the Beautiful" [...] of the Critique of Judgment, Kant states that beauty {{is not a}} {{property}} of an artwork or natural phenomenon, but is instead a consciousness of the pleasure that attends the 'free play' of the imagination and the understanding. Even though it appears that we are using reason to decide what is beautiful, the judgment is not a cognitive judgment, [...] "and is consequently not logical, but aesthetical" [...] (§ 1). A pure judgement of taste is in fact subjective insofar as {{it refers to the}} emotional response of the subject and is based upon nothing but esteem for an object itself: it is a disinterested pleasure, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> that pure judgements of taste, i.e. judgements of beauty, lay claim to universal validity (§§20–22). It {{is important to note that}} this universal validity is not derived from a determinate concept of beauty but from common sense (§40). Kant also believed that a judgement of taste shares characteristics engaged in a moral judgement: both are disinterested, and we hold them to be universal. In the chapter [...] "Analytic of the Sublime" [...] Kant identifies the sublime as an aesthetic quality that, like beauty, is subjective, but unlike beauty refers to an indeterminate relationship between the faculties of the imagination and of reason, and shares the character of moral judgments in the use of reason. The feeling of the sublime, itself officially divided into two distinct modes (the mathematical and the dynamical sublime), describes two subjective moments, both of which concern the relationship of the faculty of the imagination to reason. Some commentators, however, argue that Kant's critical philosophy contains a third kind of the sublime, the moral sublime, which is the aesthetic response to the moral law or a representation thereof, and a development of the [...] "noble" [...] sublime in Kant's theory of 1764. The mathematical sublime is situated in the failure of the imagination to comprehend natural objects that appear boundless and formless, or appear [...] "absolutely great" [...] (§ 23–25). This imaginative failure is then recuperated through the pleasure taken in reason's assertion of the concept of infinity. In this move the faculty of reason proves itself superior to our fallible sensible self (§§ 25–26). In the dynamical sublime there is the sense of annihilation of the sensible self as the imagination tries to comprehend a vast might. This power of nature threatens us but through the resistance of reason to such sensible annihilation, the subject feels a pleasure and a sense of the human moral vocation. This appreciation of moral feeling through exposure to the sublime helps to develop moral character.|$|E
