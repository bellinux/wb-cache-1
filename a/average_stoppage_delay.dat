After a brief look into the institutional and quantitative development of STC in Germany, this paper tries to answer the question whether STC prevents Schumpeterian creative destruction and structural change in economic downturns. With the help of a VAR-Model we can analyze interdependencies between the business cycle, STC and unemployment, finding evidence for a bridging function of STC.

40|$|Cash flow {{forecasting}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} essential tools toward assessing the distribution of expenditure and revenues of construction projects with respect to the time of the project. The work presented in this paper aims to find out the minimum fund required for cash outflow in case of delay in payments and to identify contractual implications and consequences due to failure of meeting planned cash flow on both the owner and the contractor. Data from record files of 25 villas, in Muscat, Oman, with different sizes was analysed to identify the minimum fund required with the contractor to maintain the progress of work in-case of delay of interim payments. The analysis also included identification of consequences of delay of interim payments. It was found that the minimum fund required is 8. 5 per cent of the contract value for maximum interim payment delay of four weeks. The value of required minimum fund increases as the period of delay increases. In most cases the percentage of the required minimum fund increases with the increase of the contract value. Work <b>stoppage,</b> <b>delay</b> in completion, penalties and incompletion of projects are major consequences of delay on interim payments...|$|R

Background: A 4 -year study regarding client requirement representation and use on National Health Service construction projects in the United Kingdom provided empirical evidence of infection control requirement communication and understanding through design and construction work interactions. Methods: An analysis of construction project resources (e. g., infection control regulations and room data sheets) was combined with semi-structured interviews with hospital client employees and design and construction professionals to provide valuable insights into the management of infection control issues. Results: Infection control requirements are representationally indistinct but also omnipresent through all phases of the construction project life cycle: Failure to recognize their nature, relevance, and significance can result in <b>delays,</b> <b>stoppages,</b> and redesign work. Construction project resources (e. g., regulatory guidance and room data sheets) can mask or obscure the meaning of infection control issues.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{electromagnetic}} compatibility (EMC) problems of distributed electrical networks, especially that caused by lightning to electrified railway. Lightning transients were found to damage important devices that control train movements, causing traffic <b>stoppage</b> and <b>delays.</b> This thesis attempts to develop computational models for identification of parameters influencing the coupling phenomena between those devices and lightning. Some supporting experimental investigations are also carried out. This thesis forms the groundwork {{on the subject of}} lightning interaction with the electrified railway networks. Lightning induces transient overvoltages in railway conductor systems such as tracks, overhead wires, and underground cables, either due to direct lightning strike to the system or due to the coupling of electromagnetic fields from remote strikes. Models based on multiconductor transmission line theory were developed for calculating the induced voltages and currents. A transmission line return stroke model, that can predict the remote electromagnetic fields comparable to experimental observations, is also developed. Earlier works on modeling earth return impedances for transient studies in power distribution systems are not readily applicable for railways for lightning transients, in cases of low earth conductivities found in Sweden and for large variation in conductor heights. For the wires above ground, the ground impedance models were modified for wide range of frequencies, soil conductivities and wide spread of conductor heights. Influences of pole insulator flashovers, pole-footing soil ionizations and interconnections between the conductors on the lightning surge propagation are studied. Wave propagation in buried shielded and unshielded cables with ground return is studied. Simplified, valid and computationally efficient ground impedance expressions for buried and on-ground wires are proposed. A model for the coupling phenomena (transfer impedance) through multiple cable shields with multiconductor core is also proposed. Besides, experimental studies on lightning induced transients entering a railway technical house, failure modes of relay and rectifier units used in the train position/signaling applications for lightning transients are performed. A high frequency circuit model for the booster transformer for lightning interaction studies is developed. The simulation models are being converted to user-friendly software for the practicing engineers of the railway industry...|$|R
40|$|In {{the early}} {{electrified}} railway systems, {{the design of}} signal and control networks were not always made {{in accordance with the}} strict rules of Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC). This created problems due to Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) when old electro-mechanical signalling, control and communication systems were replaced by modern sensitive electronic circuits. Modern developments in the railway systems have made the system more vulnerable to lightning transients, a natural source of EMI, because the overall network is not designed to reduce the lightning surges to the low levels tolerable to the electronic systems widely being introduced in the railway system. Railway networks are extensive and modernization of signal/control/communication systems are carried out in stages at different times, it is not unusual to find transient related problems in a section of the network on account of inadequate lightning protection design or EMC design of the existing network in which a new module (equipment or system) is introduced. These problems may act as a brake on the upgrading plans of the railways. Also the new railway systems which incorporate advanced signal/control/communication systems sometimes suffers from the effects of lightning transients because many of the standards and guidelines used in the design dates back to the age of electromechanical devices and hence do not include robust transient protection design. There have been many attempts to address EMC issues in railways, but usually these attempts were confined to solving immediate problems of EMI due to introduction of new locomotive drives and EMI due to sparks at the pantograph. A comprehensive review of railway system from the angle of lightning protection and EMC is not yet fully carried out. The Swedish National Rail Administration (Banverket) reported a delay of about 900 - 1000 hours in the years 2001 - 02. Lightning transients were found to damage important devices that control train movements, causing traffic <b>stoppage</b> and <b>delays.</b> This work therefore discusses the EMC problems of large distributed systems, with particular reference to lightning interaction with Swedish rail networks [1]. Lightning induces transient overvoltages in railway conductor systems such as tracks, overhead wires, and underground cables, either due to direct lightning strike to the system or due to the coupling of electromagnetic fields from remote strikes. Models based on multiconductor transmission line theory were developed for calculating the induced voltages and currents [1 - 3]. Some experiments have also been carried out to better understand {{the way in which the}} lighting transients’ couple into the systems and also to verify the models used for analysis [4]. From experiments high frequency behavior of different types of transformers used within the railway systems were also derived [1, 6].   Besides, experimental studies on lightning induced transients entering railway systems, failure modes of relay and rectifier units used in the train position/signaling applications for lightning transients are performed. The simulation models are being converted to user friendly software for the practicing engineers of the railway industry [1]. Presented at the EuroEM Conference 2008, Lausanne, Switzerlan...|$|R
40|$|Many {{production}} machines need {{high energy}} utilization {{due to high}} number of electrical devices (especially motors) used like tools, fans, pumps, actuators etc. Moreover in several industrial sectors, production phases are not continue but intermittent, with a repetition of working times and idle times. During idle times the switch off of such devices is not always possible due to technical limitations, {{and when it is}} possible, the starting phase of electrical equipments can bring, especially if very frequent, to higher unnecessary energy consumption due to peak current at the start up of the electrical motors. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to introduce the possibility to manage intermittent productions through the inverter technology. Inverters allow power control by modulate electric frequency and voltage to motors.

40|$|Energy is {{essential}} to economic prosperity and quality of life. However it can have {{detrimental effects on the}} environment if not used properly. Moreover, if energy resources are scarce in a given country, then its use will impose economic and financial burdens on the national economy. The cement industry is energy-intensive, which adds a micro dimension to the macro issues mentioned above. Reducing energy consumption without due consideration to production requirements is not an optimal situation. What is needed is to arrive at a situation whereby energy is used rationally. The concept of rational use of energy has two embedded principles. The first is increased energy-use efficiency and the second is environmental protection. Jordan Cement Factories (JCF), located in a developing country where energy resources are not indigenously available and, therefore, costly energy requirements are imported, have realised the importance of addressing the energy management and conservation issues. This thesis describes the efforts initiated and conducted by the author, to address the research problem of improving energy usage through the application of effective management techniques aimed at reducing energy consumption per unit of cement produced. This present research has been concerned with energy management and efficient use of energy. The Jordan Cement Factories were used as a vehicle to demonstrate the proposed research methodology that aimed at improving energy consumption and thus operational efficiency. The methodology is based on establishing statistically significant relationships between interacting problem factors, and assessing the economic impact of improving these factors. Economic evaluation entailed the development of economic models and an application methodology combined with illustrative case studies. Consequently, the problem of energy management has been presented in a wider perspective that addressed the whole management system at the organisation. Towards that end, it was first necessary to show the significance of energy cost with respect to the overall manufacturing costs. The analysis of production costs, which demonstrated the significance of energy costs, was followed by the investigation and examination of the basic management factors that have direct impact on energy consumption at the JCF. Among these factors are, for instance, production line availability, production rate, <b>average</b> number of <b>stoppages,</b> and <b>average</b> duration of <b>stoppages.</b> These factors were determined using preliminary data analysis and the experience and technical knowledge of the researcher. The statistical analysis proved the existence of strong relationships between energy consumption and management factors. Several models were developed for a set of selected production lines, in the JFC at Fuhais and Rashadiya plants. These statistical models were generated using actual data for electrical energy and fuel consumption. The derived models have demonstrated the existence of strong relationships between energy consumption and management control factors; for instance, the values of R 2 range from 60 % to 90 %. This implies that an equivalent percentage of the variations in energy consumption {{can be attributed to the}} selected management factors. The economic model developed in this research is concerned with demonstrating that effective management practices associated with proper maintenance and housekeeping can result in highly significant savings in energy usage. Although a simplistic methodology was used to evaluate the economic impact of any improvement programme, the economic treatment showed that the cost of improvement is actually negligible compared to the realisable savings in energy usage. The research has dealt with the details of developing a coherent energy management model whose objective is to establish transformational management processes of certain high-level management factors into daily operations and controls. The high-level management. factors are the same factors used as independent variables in the statistical and economic models, which statistically proved to be the major factors affecting the energy consumption at JCF. The research has also presented a detailed analysis of the organisational and procedural aspects of energy management with concentration on management functions, especially planning, controlling, executing, organising, and auditing. A detailed mapping and analysis of these functions as the main components of an Energy Management System (EMS) resulted in establishing job descriptions, organisational charts, work instructions and procedures for all-important functions of the EMS. The type of work described in this thesis could be extrapolated for application in other industries, particularly energy-intensive ones, to arrive at the objective of rational use of energy at the national and international levels. Comprehensive studies would need to be carried out for each type of industry prior to implementation. The cost benefit analysis presented in this research proved, beyond any doubt, the importance of implementing the EMS in JCF. As a result of this implementation it is demonstrated that huge annual savings were realised. Finally, as a result of improving energy control factors, introducing energy conservation measures and employing management techniques at JCF to guarantee the effectiveness of all such activities, resulted in an annual savings amount to about USS 3. 5 million. Therefore, if the same or similar actions are undertaken by all cement, or other highly energy intensive industries then the savings could reach billions of dollars...|$|R
