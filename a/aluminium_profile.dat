The main focus lies on a comparative crash analysis of an aluminium beam profile which the company Sapa technology has used during their crash analysis. The <b>aluminium</b> <b>profile</b> has the characteristic of having different thickness over span ratios within the profile. This characteristic provided the opportunity to conduct a performance investigation of shell and solid elements with finite element analysis. Numerical comparisons were made between shell and solid elements where measurable parameters such as internal energy, simulation times, buckling patterns and material failures were compared to physical tests conducted prior to this thesis by Sapa technology. The performance investigation of shell and solid elements was initiated by creating models of the <b>aluminium</b> <b>profile</b> for general visualization and to facilitate the meshing of surfaces. The meshing procedure {{was considered to be}} an important factor of the analysis. The mesh quality and element orientations were carefully monitored in order to achieve acceptable results when the models were compared to physical tests. Preliminary simulations were further conducted in order to obtain a clear understanding of software parameters when performing crash simulations in LS-Dyna and Impetus AFEA. The investigated parameters were element formulations and material models. A general parameter understanding facilitated in the selection of parameters for actual simulations, where material failure and damage models were used. In conclusion, LS-Dyna was observed to provide a bigger internal energy absorption during the crushing of the beam with longer simulation times for solid elements when compared to shell elements. Impetus AFEA did on the other hand provide results close to physical test data with acceptable simulation times when compared to physical tests. The result difference obtained from the FE-software's in relation to physical crash experiments were considered to be varied but did indicate that shell elements were efficient enough for the specific profile during simulations with LS-Dyna.

40|$|Abstract. A {{detailed}} analysis of metal flow through a porthole die to produce a rectangular hollow <b>aluminium</b> <b>profile</b> was performed by means of three-dimensional FE simulation using DEFORM 3 D. It was aimed at revealing the flow patterns of a medium-strength aluminium alloy 7020 through a porthole die and gaining an insight into the formation of longitudinal weld seams inside the welding chamber during extrusion. In the case of extruding a rectangular hollow profile through a porthole die with four ports, two neighbouring ports were different from each other. Using an FE model including these two ports, different flow patterns of two individual metal streams were revealed. The 3 D FE simulation also showed how two unequal metal streams contacted each other and became bonded in the welding chamber under a certain hydrostatic pressure and at a certain temperature, before the metal flew through the die bearing. The difference in velocity between the metal streams led to uneven flow at the die bearing and thus a wavy extrusion nose...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} semiconductors, AlGaAs, is always fabricated using one of several different growth techniques. This thesis reports the successful synthesis of AlGaAs by ion implantation. A detailed study {{of the quality of the}} material using Rutherford Backscattering (RBS), Photoluminescence (PL), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy (SIMS), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and X-Ray Microprobe analysis is presented. The values of the implantation energy chosen were 400 keV and 135 keV for the As+ and A 1 + respectively so that their maximum concentration is at the same depth. The implantation doses were 1 x 1015 - 1 x 10 17 /cm 2. After implantation the samples were rapid thermal annealed (RTA) at a temperature of 650 °C- 1000 °C for 25 seconds. Before annealing the samples were capped with Si 3 N 4 /AlN encapsulants and where appropriate their quality was checked with SEM. Implantations were made both at room temperature and at 230 °C. The AlGaAs layer was identified by its clear PL signal and by the RBS spectra, which fitted computer simulation. TEM diffraction patterns from these layers were that of a single crystal and SIMS chemical analysis showed the <b>aluminium</b> <b>profile</b> extended to a depth of 0. 3 mum in agreement with the theoretical projected range. The observed reduction in the implantation damage with increasing annealing temperature was investigated using RBS and TEM. The RBS channelling spectra showed a decrease in the damage and that regrowth was taking place. TEM showed the disappearance of all the precipitates at increased temperatures. The layer thickness was measured using SIMS, SEM, and RBS. X-Ray Microprobe together with RBS and SIMS was used to calculate the aluminium mole fraction value, x, to a good degree of accuracy. The ion beam mixing and damage enhanced methods for synthesis were also used to synthesize AlGaAs.

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} the Finite Element model for simulation of thin <b>aluminium</b> <b>profile</b> extrusion of both solid and hollow shapes. The analysis has shown that the material flow in simulation is very dependent on the friction model. Experimental and theoretical studies show that friction traction on the interface between the tool and the deformed material can be represented as a combination of adhesive friction force and the force that is required to deform surface asperities. In aluminium extrusion we can clearly distinguish two different areas with respect to friction conditions such as sticking and sliding and transient zones between them. The lengths of these zones are also dependent on variation of the choke angle and actual thickness of the profile. To get these values the material flow problem is to be coupled with the simulation of the tools deformation. A series of experiments with specially designed tools have been done to investigate how the bearing length and choke angle may influence the extension of different friction zones and by these means vary the material flow pattern. The friction models have also been tested with industrial profiles of complex shapes and have shown good correspondence to reality...|$|E

40|$|Thermal comfort, which depends {{mainly on}} {{temperature}} and airflow velocity distributions, {{is an important}} factor to consider when designing modern building energy systems. Up until today, the transient behavior of air flow structures has only been marginally investigated. The goal of this work is to study these structures in more detail, particularly the phenomena linked to the occurrence of free and forced convection. To this purpose an experimental test facility was built to provide new data about the transient behavior of large-scale flow structures in ventilated rooms. The test facility, called the Aachen model room, is 3 ~m high, 4 ~m wide and 5 ~m long. Four heat sources stretching over the whole length on the room are located inside. Each heat source is 5 ~m long, 0. 4 ~m wide and 0. 6 ~m high. The total internal load in the test facility can be varied between 0 ~kW and 6 ~kW by using adjustable power supply units. The room facing side of the walls is covered in aluminium foil. The effect of radiation can thus be neglected. Directly below the ceiling, on both sides, slot diffusers are installed over the whole length of the room. Each of the air inlets is one meter long and 20 ~mm high. The supply air can be brought inside either on both or just one side of the test facility. Exhaust air openings are located on floor level on both sides, over the whole length of the room, with the possibility of using just the openings at the back half of the room. The air flow velocity in the room is measured with twelve omnidirectional anemometers in a rectangular grid. The sensors measure the speed of the local velocity vector. The air temperature is measured with twelve platinum resistance thermometers. Each of the twelve temperature and velocity sensors is arranged on a horizontal <b>aluminium</b> <b>profile</b> at a distance of 0. 33 m from each other. The <b>aluminium</b> <b>profile</b> is fixed onto a traversing device. At isothermal boundary conditions {{and in the case of}} mixed convections with dominating forced convection the air flow structure is almost two-dimensional and stable over the whole length of the test facility. If the supply air is brought inside through both inlets two large and stable eddies occur. If the supply air is brought inside the model room on one side only one large and stable eddy is formed. The air flow structure is nearly two-dimensional over the length of the model room. If neither the free convection nor the forced convection dominates, an unstable room air flow structure occurs. The flow structure in the upper part of the model room is dominated by the forced convection from the supply air. The part directly above the heating sources is dominated by free convection. The whole room air flow structure is thus three-dimensional. The turbulence models applied in air flow simulations are based on the assumption of fully turbulent flows. However, it cannot be ruled out that there are areas within an air flow structure in a room which depend on the Reynolds number at the supply air inlet. This experimental setup was also used to provide information on such areas with low air velocities. The minimal supply air velocity required for the assumption that the room air flow structure is independent of the supply air velocity depends on the supply air inlet and the supply air momentum flow. In this study a connection between these factors was observed for the given geometries. The effect of the boundary conditions on the room air flow structure was studied by applying different supply air velocities and different internal loads. Low velocities and high internals loads lead to an unstable room air flow structure. By increasing the supply air velocity, the structure becomes more stable and can be considered two-dimensional over the whole length of the model room. The point where an unstable air flow structure becomes stable is observed at the same Archimedes number for different inlet velocities and internal loads, as long as the supply air and the heating loads are activated over the whole length of the test facility. In the case of a stable room air flow structure, the position of the exhaust opening has no further influence on the structure. Room air flow structures where no domination of forced convection is present do show an influence of the position of the exhaust opening. The room air flow structures are changing by varying the position of the exhaust opening. If only the opening at the back of the room are used, the two previously discussed stable eddies occur only in the back part of the model room, whereas the front part is characterised by a disordered flow structure...|$|E
40|$|Aluminium {{extrusion}} is {{an industrial}} forming {{process that is}} used to produce long profiles of a constant cross-section. This cross-section is shaped by the opening in a steel tool known as the die. The understanding of the mechanics of the aluminium extrusion process is still limited. The flow of aluminium within the die is governed by tribomechanical and rate- and temperature-dependent effects that have not yet been fully mathematically modelled. As a result, it is difficult to design the die geometry {{in such a way that}} the <b>aluminium</b> <b>profile</b> complies with high customer demands regarding dimensional accuracy and surface quality. Die design has to a large extent been empirically based. This, along with a low level of automation, causes a large variation in the performance of dies. This often necessitates corrections to the die and results in a high percentage of scrap production. This dissertation is a continuation of a research project that has existed since 1991. In cooperation with the aluminium extrusion company Boalgroup, researchers at the University of Twente have worked to gain more insight into the extrusion process. With the help of finite element simulations this has led to the formulation of design rules and approaches that are based on a more fundamental understanding of the process than the existing empirical knowledge. A design method was devised that balances the exit velocity of flat dies by using a combination of variable sink-in and bearing geometry. This leads to die designs that exhibit a more stable and predictable flow balancing behaviour than traditional designs based on length variations of parallel bearings alone. In addition, a formula is given that estimates the pressure acting on the die, so that the calculation time of finite element analysis of the die deflection is drastically reduced. Along with making a contribution to the developments mentioned above, the work presented in this thesis focuses on the implementation of these design rules and approaches into CAD tools. The provided automation of these design tasks significantly accelerates the design process and increases the consistency of the results, without removing the control of the human designer. By taking constraints of the manufacturing process into account while generating the geometry, the risk that the die manufacturer has to make unexpected changes to the die design is reduced. The reduction of design time that was achieved has enabled Boalgroup to greatly increase the number of in-house die designs. Since the majority of these new designs is showing a significant performance increase, the company’s overall productivity has increased steadily, helping them to deal with the ever rising labour and energy costs...|$|E

The production at this {{department is}} achieved through the usage of five extrusion machines (EP 1 -EP 5) that run continuously throughout a working shift. The continuous running of these machines is what Wispeco would like to maintain as any stoppage of the machines results in financial losses for the company, an estimated loss of R 25248 per hour per machine was highlighted. This figure was calculated using the average production quantity per machine (789 kg/hr.) multiplied by the price per kilogram (R 32 /kg) of aluminium. The only reason that causes the machines to be stopped from running is when {{there is a shortage of}} skips within this department. A skip is a material handling component that needs to be readily available next to the extrusion machines after the production of the <b>aluminium</b> <b>profiles</b> by the machines. The problem for this project was to ensure that there is always an availability of skips next to each extrusion machine and therefore the continuous running of the machines can be maintained, of which a total number of 2720 skips is available within the company and is shared by four departments including the Profiling department. The other three departments are Powder coating, Anodizing and Gauteng Stockists (warehouse). To get a clear understanding of the problem, a time study for a single shift (6 am- 6 pm) was performed with the results thereof used as input data to a simulation model using Simio software. The results of the simulation model gave an indication of the instantaneous production quantities for every machine and hence gave an indication of the number of skips needed per machine per production batch. The remaining number of skips was allocated to the remaining three departments based on the average number of skips needed per department, this number was achieved using the daily skip counts performed at each department.
