5|$|Philosopher Taede Smedes {{argued that}} {{religious}} language is symbolic. Denying any conflict {{between science and}} religion, he proposes that 'to believe' means to accept a conviction (that God exists, {{in the context of}} Christianity), which is different from 'knowing', which only occurs once something is proven. Thus, according to Smedes, we believe things that we do not know for sure. Smedes argues that, rather than being part of the world, God is so far beyond the world {{that there can be no}} common standard to which both God and the world can be compared. He argues that people can still believe in God, even though he cannot be compared to <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> because belief in God is just an alternative way of viewing that world (he likens this to two people viewing a painting differently). Smedes claims that there should be no reason to look for a meaning behind our metaphors and symbols of God because the metaphors are all we have of God. He suggests that we can only talk of God pro nobis (for us) and not in se (as such) or sine nobis (without us). The point, he argues, is not that our concept of God should correspond with reality, but that we can only conceive of God through metaphors.|$|E

In May 2012, he purchased the [...] $2.5 million former house of Heath Ledger in Laurel Canyon in the Hollywood Hills, a small ranch built in 1951. He professes that his fame {{has not changed}} him as a person, stating, [...] "I love my job more than <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> and I could never imagine doing anything else. So {{this whole thing is}} a very small price to pay compared to someone who has to go to an office to work." ...|$|E

500|$|Following their {{successful}} partnership on All Things Must Pass in 1970, Harrison and co-producer Phil Spector {{turned their}} attention to resurrecting the career of Spector's wife Ronnie, formerly lead singer of the Ronettes. Since the break-up of the Ronettes in 1967, Ronnie Spector's only musical release had been [...] "You Came, You Saw, You Conquered", a 1969 single on A Records. Her signing to the Beatles' Apple record label was a condition of Phil Spector's deal with the company, one that Harrison and Lennon, as avowed fans of the Ronettes, were happy to honour. The plan was to produce a comeback album, with Harrison providing many of the songs, and issue it on Apple Records. In his book Phil Spector: Out of His Head, Williams quotes music publisher Paul Case as having said during this period: [...] "Phil wants a hit record with Ronnie again more than <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> I think he'd give up all his worldly possessions for that." ...|$|E
500|$|The Giants {{controlled}} the 49ers throughout the game, and with four minutes {{left in the}} third quarter held a 38–14 lead, which would have been even larger had not Shockey dropped a touchdown pass in the third quarter. The 49ers rallied however, scoring a field goal and three touchdowns—two on Jeff Garcia touchdown passes, one on a Garcia 14-yard touchdown run, and two two-point conversions made by Terrell Owens—which gave the 49ers a 39–38 lead with a minute to go. Collins then drove the Giants down to the 49ers 23-yard line with six seconds to play, setting up a 41-yard potential game-winning field goal attempt by Matt Bryant. However, Bryant never got an opportunity to make the kick. 40-year-old long snapper Trey Junkin—who had been signed out of retirement for this playoff game—snapped the ball low and punter Matt Allen could not spot the ball for the attempt. With no other options, Allen threw it downfield to offensive lineman Rich Seubert. The Giants were penalized for an illegal man downfield (Seubert), and the game was over. However, after the game, the NFL recognized that San Francisco should have been penalized on that play as well for pass interference. This would have created offsetting penalties and given New York a chance to kick again. After the game a devastated Junkin said [...] "I cost 58 guys a chance to go to the Super Bowl. I'd give <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> except my family at this point, right now to still be retired." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hermann Cohen {{rejected}} Spinoza's {{idea that}} God {{can be found}} in nature, but agreed that God was not a personal being. Rather, he saw God as an ideal, an archetype of morality. Not only can God not be identified with nature, but God is also incomparable to <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> This is because God is “One,” unique and unlike anything else. One loves and worships God through living ethically and obeying His moral law: “love of God is love of morality.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Billy Corgan {{has said}} that he was {{inspired}} to write a story based 'the Fool's Journey' from the Tarot. [...] Corgan has explained his interpretation of this view: [...] "There's childlike innocence when you just don't really know <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> and it all seems sort of big and magical...the teen, aware but not really liking what's going on...the third person that's cynical, where you get kind of bitter because you feel so small and there's all these things that are sort of happening and there's not much you can do about it...the fourth stage out of that would be finding a sort of spiritual place within yourself where you can live in reality, you can see it for what it is, but maybe you can find a deeper source of inspiration and peace." [...] In other words, the album finds Corgan [...] "looking past, present and future {{all at the same time}} and trying to have that perspective".|$|E

Other events included a {{program at the}} New York Public Library in April, called [...] "Literary Journalism: A Discussion", focusing on the editorial process at the Review and a reception in November at the Frick Collection. During the year, Martin Scorsese filmed a documentary about the history and influence of the Review, and the debates that it has spawned, titled The 50 Year Argument, which premiered in June 2014 at the Sheffield Doc/Fest. It was later seen at various film festivals, on BBC television and on HBO in the US. Asked how he maintained his [...] "level of meticulousness and determination" [...] after 50 years, Silvers said that the Review [...] "was and is a unique opportunity ... to do what one wants on <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> Now, that is given to hardly any editor, anywhere, anytime.
