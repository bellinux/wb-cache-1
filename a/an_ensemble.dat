40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the role of}} local force balance in the transition from <b>a</b> microcanonical <b>ensemble</b> of static granular packings, characterized by an invariant stress, to <b>a</b> canonical <b>ensemble.</b> Packings in two dimensions admit a reciprocal tiling, and a collective effect of force balance is that the area of this tiling is also invariant in <b>a</b> microcanonical <b>ensemble.</b> We present analytical relations between stress, tiling area and tiling area fluctuations, and show that <b>a</b> canonical <b>ensemble</b> can be characterized by an intensive thermodynamic parameter conjugate to one or the other. We test the equivalence of different ensembles through the first canonical simulations of the force network <b>ensemble,</b> <b>a</b> model system.
