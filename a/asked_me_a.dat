2500|$|Following the (then) record low of {{the arctic}} sea ice extend in 2007, Mark Serreze, the {{director}} of US National Snow and Ice Data Center, stated [...] "If you <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> {{couple of years ago}} when the Arctic could lose all of its ice then I would have said 2100, or 2070 maybe. But now I think that 2030 is a reasonable estimate." ...|$|E

[...] But I don't think it contributes much." [...] Gehringer also had a sense of humor about his reputation. [...] At a civic banquet in his honor, Gehringer's entire speech consisted of the following: [...] "I'm known around baseball as saying very little, and I'm not going to spoil my reputation." [...] When asked why he signed his name [...] "Chas. Gehringer", he responded: [...] "Why use seven letters when four will do?" [...] On another occasion, when asked about his closed-lip reputation, he responded: [...] "Not true; if somebody <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> question, I would answer them. If they said, 'Pass the salt,' I would pass the salt." ...|$|E
60|$|The agent <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> {{good many}} questions, being {{particularly}} anxious {{to know what}} rent had been agreed upon.|$|E
60|$|Hip. You <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>an</b> hard question: I can die For you; perhaps I cannot woo so well.|$|R
60|$|I WAITED {{in silence}} for the {{disclosure}} that was now to come. Naomi began by <b>asking</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> question.|$|R
3000|$|Celeste: “My brain stops. [If the instructor] <b>asks</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> question, I have no {{idea what}} the answer is. If you were <b>asking</b> <b>me</b> in <b>a</b> small group, yes I'll tell you the answer and get it. If in a large group, my brain just stops. I {{have no idea}} why.” [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let {{me ask you}} the {{question}} you <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> few minutes ago," [...] her companion begged. [...] "Were you born in America--or England?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Undoubtedly--but {{we are not}} {{now under}} indictment. You <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> question--I am {{answering}} it." [...] This silenced Sanborn effectually. Mason refilled his pipe and then resumed: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing," [...] Jeanne answered, [...] "only you <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> question, and I felt {{an irresistible}} desire to answer you truthfully. It {{would have come}} sooner or later." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{voice from}} the trumpet interposed. [...] "Don't <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> word about {{conditions}} over here--it's no use. I can't tell you a thing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! my dear, you are <b>asking</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> riddle? Well, then--Society, men of birth, men of {{recognised}} position, men above eccentricity, in a word, of reputation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot sit {{and hear}} it. And what am I {{to say when}} he <b>asks</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> {{question}} as he did just now? He said that you had confessed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> {{question}} at dinner-time," [...] she said, [...] "winch I {{did not answer}} at the time. You asked me why I disliked James Miller so much." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing very much; mamma <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> {{question}} or two this morning, and I said I was coming here. Had {{she asked me}} why, I should have told her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... --The {{question}} you <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> moment ago {{seems to me}} more interesting. What is that beauty which the artist struggles to express from lumps of earth, said Stephen coldly.|$|E
6000|$|... "If you'd <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>an</b> hour ago," [...] he said, [...] "I {{should have}} told you to try Iris Villa, Acacia Road, Hampstead. I have just come from there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> question," [...] I said, [...] "which, {{after five}} {{thousand}} years, is yet undecided. On that account alone, it {{is a question}} not to be trifled with." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Several," [...] replied Tommy. [...] "Look here, you've been <b>asking</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> lot of questions. Let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> you {{one for a}} change. Why didn't {{you kill}} me off at once before I regained consciousness?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir, {{there was}} no {{difficulty}} about it. Mr. Villiers <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> few questions as to {{the situation on the}} frontier, and at once said that I should have £5,000 to take him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When you <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> {{little while}} ago whether I had left the Church, I let you think I had. I am still {{connected}} with St. John's, but I {{do not know how}} long I shall continue to be." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He said Flint was an {{intimate}} friend of his. Then he <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> whole raft {{of questions about}} fellows in the neighbourhood I didn't know he'd ever heard of. Say, {{he wants to go}} from Leith to the Legislature." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You have {{something}} in {{your mind when you}} <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> question like this!" [...] she said. [...] "What should I know about it at all? What makes you ask me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do not <b>ask</b> <b>me.</b> <b>A</b> {{good and}} honorable man; one who loves me well, and would devote {{his life to}} me; one whom once {{it would have been}} {{happiness}} to marry, but now--" ...|$|R
60|$|She {{said she}} would have asked Mrs. Shutterfield to come with her and {{introduce}} her, but that lady was away from home, and so she had come by herself to <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> very great favor.|$|R
60|$|She {{was unusually}} silent, and {{once or twice}} I caught her glancing curiously at me, {{as though she had}} {{something}} which it was in her mind to say, but needed encouragement. As we neared my cottage she <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> question.|$|E
60|$|In {{ten minutes}} three men {{stood on the}} deck of the Sparhawk. Some one had hailed me in English to lower something. I had lowered nothing; but here they were on deck. They <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> lot of questions, but I {{answered}} none of them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you for nothing," [...] said Bernard, smiling. [...] "You have <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> {{great many}} questions; {{there is one}} that in turn I {{have a right to}} ask you. What do you propose to do in {{consequence}} of what I have told you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>an</b> {{embarrassing}} question," [...] he whispered, {{looking around}} to make sure that no one overheard. [...] "Although I pose as one of the nobility, I am, as a matter of fact, a great fraud!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Where all {{are worthy}} it is {{difficult}} to decide which most deserves the hand of the Princess. Therefore I propose to test your wit. The one who shall <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> riddle I cannot guess, can marry my daughter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She cry half 'e time, sah--den {{she look}} up bold, and resolute, just like ole Massar, sah, when he tell he rijjement 'charge baggonet,' and {{seem as if}} she want to go right into T'ousandacres' huts. Lor' bless me, sah, Masser Mordaunt--if she <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> one {{question}} about you to-day, she <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> hundred!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, my dear lady!' {{said the}} Bishop, 'he {{has become a}} great man; he is our star. I assure you there is nobody in London talked of but Lord Cadurcis. He <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> great deal after you and Cherbury. He will be delighted to see you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Am I {{weary of}} life? Well, Augusta, {{on the whole}} I think I am. It {{seems to me that}} death and after it may {{interest}} us more. For the rest, you <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> question, and, after the fashion of my people, I answered it as truthfully as I could." ...|$|E
60|$|One night--at Cheraw, I {{think it}} was--he sent {{for me to}} talk to him. I found him lying on a bed of Spanish moss they had made for him. He <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> great many {{questions}} about St. Louis, and praised Mr. Brinsmade, especially his management of the Sanitary Commission.|$|E
6000|$|It {{seemed to}} me that he was <b>asking</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> good deal more than he was telling me, and I said to him: [...] "That is what I want to find out. What is the family home of the Dorkminsters?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But he did <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> {{long time}} ago, you know, papa," [...] Elma put in demurely. [...] "And at that time, you remember, you {{objected to the}} match; so of course, as in duty bound, I at once refused him." ...|$|R
60|$|Presently {{the old man}} roused {{himself again}} and began talking eagerly, <b>asking</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> hundred wild questions, to which I was {{compelled}} to reply, still {{trying to keep up}} the character of the long-lost son just returned victorious from the wars.|$|R
