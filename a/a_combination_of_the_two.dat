5|$|Johnson was {{not born}} blind, though he was {{impaired}} with the disability at an early age. It is uncertain how he lost his sight, but it is generally agreed by most biographers of Johnson that he was blinded by his stepmother when he was seven years old, a claim that was first made by Johnson's purported widow Angeline Johnson. In her recollection, Willie's father had violently confronted his stepmother about her infidelity, and during the argument she splashed Willie with a caustic solution of lye water, permanently blinding him. Other theories have also been developed to explain Johnson's visual impairment, including that he wore the wrong spectacles, that he viewed a partial solar eclipse that was observable over Texas in 1905, or <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> conjectures.|$|E
5|$|On microscopy, {{the tumor}} cells are {{typically}} described as small, round and blue, and rosette patterns (Homer Wright rosettes) may be seen. Homer Wright rosettes are tumor cells around the neuropil, {{not to be}} confused with pseudorosettes, which are tumor cells around a blood vessel. They are also distinct from the pseudorosettes of an ependymoma which consist of tumor cells with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)–positive processes tapering off toward a blood vessel (thus <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>two).</b> A variety of immunohistochemical stains are used by pathologists to distinguish neuroblastomas from histological mimics, such as rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, lymphoma and Wilms' tumor.|$|E
5|$|Plasmapheresis and {{intravenous}} immunoglobulins (IVIG) are the {{two main}} immunotherapy treatments for GBS. Plasmapheresis attempts to reduce the body's attack on the nervous system by filtering antibodies out of the bloodstream. Similarly, administration of IVIG neutralizes harmful antibodies and inflammation. These two treatments are equally effective, but <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> is not significantly better than either alone. Plasmapheresis speeds recovery when used within four weeks of the onset of symptoms. IVIG works as well as plasmapheresis when started within {{two weeks of the}} onset of symptoms, and has fewer complications. IVIG is usually used first because of its ease of administration and safety. Its use is not without risk; occasionally it causes liver inflammation, or in rare cases, kidney failure. Glucocorticoids alone have not been found to be effective in speeding recovery and could potentially delay recovery.|$|E

Our system {{is based on a}} plain text in-dex extracted from Tweets crawled from twitter. com. This index has been used to retrieve candidate Tweets for the given topics. The result-ing Tweets were post-processed and then analyzed using three different approaches: (i) a burst detection approach, (ii) a hashtag analysis, and (iii) a Retweet analysis. Our experiments consisted of four runs: Firstly, <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lucene ranking with the burst detection, and sec-ondly, <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lucene ranking, the burst detection, and the hashtag analysis. Thirdly, <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lucene ranking, the burst detection, the hashtag analysis, and the Retweet analysis, and fourthly, again <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lucene ranking with the burst detection but in this case with more sophisticated query language and post-processing.

5|$|Swaying {{behaviour}} is practised by highly cryptic {{animals such as}} {{the leafy}} sea dragon and the stick insect Extatosoma tiaratum. These animals resemble vegetation with their coloration, strikingly disruptive body outlines with leaflike appendages, {{and the ability to}} sway effectively like the plants that they mimic. E. tiaratum actively sways back and forth or side to side when disturbed or when there is a gust of wind, with a frequency distribution like foliage rustling in the wind. This behaviour may represent motion crypsis, preventing detection by predators, or motion masquerade, promoting misclassification (as something other than prey), or <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>two,</b> and has accordingly also been described as a form of motion camouflage.|$|E

5|$|The {{woolly mammoth}} coexisted with early humans, who used its bones and tusks for making art, tools, and dwellings, and the species was also hunted for food.

5|$|West of the Oder–Neisse line, the German {{states were}} reorganised {{along the lines}} of the zones of occupation, and new state governments were established. Within the American zone, the {{northern}} halves of the former states of Württemberg and Baden were merged to form Württemberg-Baden in 1946. As its flag, Württemberg-Baden adopted the black-red-gold tricolour. The choice of these colours was not based on the historical use of the tricolour, but the simple addition of gold to Württemberg's colours of red and black. Coincidentally, Baden's colours were red and yellow, so the colour choice could be mistaken for <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> flags. In 1952, Württemberg-Baden became part of the modern German state of Baden-Württemberg, whose flag is black and gold.|$|E
5|$|In {{a letter}} to Biologist in June 2001, British teacher and Chartered Biologist Paul Spiring speculated that Merrick might have {{suffered}} from <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> syndromes. This hypothesis was reported by Robert Matthews, a correspondent for The Sunday Telegraph. The possibility that Merrick had both conditions {{formed the basis for}} a 2003 documentary film entitled The Curse of The Elephant Man that was produced for the Discovery Health Channel by Natural History New Zealand. During 2002, genealogical research for the film led to a BBC appeal to trace Merrick's maternal family line. In response to the appeal, a Leicester resident named Pat Selby was discovered to be the granddaughter of Merrick's uncle George Potterton. A research team took DNA samples from Selby in an unsuccessful attempt to diagnose Merrick's condition. During 2003, the filmmakers commissioned further diagnostic tests using DNA that was extracted from Merrick's hair and bone. However, the results of these tests proved inconclusive; therefore, the precise cause of Merrick's medical condition remains uncertain.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, it was {{discovered}} that medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) produce more ketone bodies per unit of energy than normal dietary fats (which are mostly long-chain triglycerides). MCTs are more efficiently absorbed and are rapidly transported to the liver via the hepatic portal system rather than the lymphatic system. The severe carbohydrate restrictions of the classic ketogenic diet made it difficult for parents to produce palatable meals that their children would tolerate. In 1971, Peter Huttenlocher devised a ketogenic diet where about 60% of the calories came from the MCT oil, and this allowed more protein and up to three times as much carbohydrate as the classic ketogenic diet. The oil was mixed with at least twice its volume of skimmed milk, chilled, and sipped during the meal or incorporated into food. He tested it on twelve children and adolescents with intractable seizures. Most children improved in both seizure control and alertness, results that were similar to the classic ketogenic diet. Gastrointestinal upset was a problem, which led one patient to abandon the diet, but meals were easier to prepare and better accepted by the children. The MCT diet replaced the classic ketogenic diet in many hospitals, though some devised diets that were <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>two.</b>|$|E

5|$|Most {{woolly mammoth}} populations {{disappeared}} {{during the late}} Pleistocene and early Holocene, alongside most of the Pleistocene megafauna (including the Columbian mammoth). This extinction formed part of the Quaternary extinction event, which began 40,000 years ago and peaked between 14,000 and 11,500 years ago. Scientists are divided over whether hunting or climate change, {{which led to the}} shrinkage of its habitat, was the main factor that contributed to the extinction of the woolly mammoth, or whether it was due to <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>two.</b> Whatever the cause, large mammals are generally more vulnerable than smaller ones due to their smaller population size and low reproduction rates. Different woolly mammoth populations did not die out simultaneously across their range, but gradually became extinct over time. Most populations disappeared between 14,000 and 10,000 years ago. The last mainland population existed in the Kyttyk Peninsula of Siberia 9,650 years ago. A small population of woolly mammoths survived on St. Paul Island, Alaska, well into the Holocene with the most recently published date of extinction being 5,600 years B.P. The last known population remained on Wrangel Island in the Arctic Ocean until 4,000 years ago, well into the start of human civilization and concurrent with the construction of the Great Pyramid of ancient Egypt.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{are divided}} over whether climate change, hunting, or <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>two,</b> drove the {{extinction}} of the Columbian mammoths. According to the climate change hypothesis, warmer weather led to the shrinking of suitable habitat for Columbian mammoths, which turned from parkland to forest, grassland and semi-desert, with less diverse vegetation. The overkill hypothesis, on the other hand, attributes the extinction to hunting by humans. This idea was first proposed by Paul S. Martin in 1967; more recent research on this subject have varied in their conclusions. A 2002 study concluded that the archaeological record {{did not support the}} overkill hypothesis, given that only 14 Clovis sites (12 with mammoth remains and two with mastodon remains) out of 76 examined provided strong evidence of hunting. In contrast, a 2007 study found that the Clovis record indicated the highest frequency of prehistoric exploitation of proboscideans for subsistence in the world, and supported the overkill hypothesis. Whatever the actual cause of extinction, large mammals are generally more vulnerable than smaller ones due to their smaller population size and low reproduction rates.|$|E
5|$|Movement {{catches the}} eye of prey animals {{on the lookout for}} predators, and of predators hunting for prey. Most methods of crypsis {{therefore}} also require suitable cryptic behaviour, such as lying down and keeping still to avoid being detected, {{or in the case of}} stalking predators such as the tiger, moving with extreme stealth, both slowly and quietly, watching its prey for any sign they are aware of its presence. As an example of the combination of behaviours and other methods of crypsis involved, young giraffes seek cover, lie down, and keep still, often for hours until their mothers return; their skin pattern blends with the pattern of the vegetation, while the chosen cover and lying position together hide the animals' shadows. The flat-tail horned lizard similarly relies on a combination of methods: it is adapted to lie flat in the open desert, relying on stillness, its cryptic coloration, and concealment of its shadow to avoid being noticed by predators. In the ocean, the leafy sea dragon sways mimetically, like the seaweeds amongst which it rests, as if rippled by wind or water currents. Swaying is seen also in some insects, like Macleay's Spectre stick insect, Extatosoma tiaratum. The behaviour may be motion crypsis, preventing detection, or motion masquerade, promoting misclassification (as something other than prey), or <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>two.</b>|$|E
