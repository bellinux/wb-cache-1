40|$|This article {{analyzes}} {{the costs and}} benefits of job rotation as a mechanism with which the firm can learn about the employees' productivities and the profitability of different jobs or <b>activities.</b> <b>I</b> compare job rotation to an assignment policy where employees specialize in one job along their career. The gains from adopting a job rotation policy are larger when there is more prior uncertainty about employees and <b>activities.</b> <b>I</b> argue that this firm learning theory fits the existing evidence on rotation better than alternative explanations based on employee motivation and employee learning. ...|$|R

60|$|In this {{exercise}} he spent another hour, {{at the end}} of which we met with far less interruption from passengers than at first.

The present Catherine has no other likeness to her, except a breadth of forehead, and a certain arch of the nostril that makes her appear rather haughty, whether she will or not. With Hareton the resemblance is carried farther: it is singular at all times, then it was particularly striking; because his senses were alert, and his mental faculties wakened to unwonted <b>activity.</b> <b>I</b> suppose this resemblance disarmed Mr. Heathcliff: {{he walked to the}} hearth in evident agitation; but it quickly subsided as he looked at the young man: or, I should say, altered its character; for it was there yet. He took the book from his hand, and glanced at the open page, then returned it without any observation; merely signing Catherine away: her companion lingered very little behind her, and I was about to depart also, but he bid me sit still.|$|E
