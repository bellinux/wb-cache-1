In 1936, he cofounded the American Labor Party, a pro-union political party active in New York, along with David Dubinsky and Sidney Hillman, partly as a vehicle to organize support for the re-election that year of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and mayor Fiorello La Guardia among socialists in the union movement.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} settlement, Augustus was also granted {{the power of}} a tribune (tribunicia potestas) for life, though not the {{official}} title of tribune. For some years, Augustus had been awarded tribunicia sacrosanctitas, the immunity given to a Tribune of the Plebs. Now he decided to assume the full powers of the magistracy, renewed annually, in perpetuity. Legally, it was closed to patricians, a status that Augustus had acquired some years earlier when adopted by Julius Caesar. This power allowed him to convene the Senate and people at will and lay business before them, to veto the actions of either the Assembly or the Senate, to preside over elections, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> first at any meeting. Also included in Augustus' tribunician authority were powers usually reserved for the Roman censor; these included the right to supervise public morals and scrutinize laws to ensure that they were in the public interest, as well as the ability to hold a census and determine the membership of the Senate.|$|E

25|$|Anthony {{worked with}} the WWA to form all-female labor unions, but with little success. She {{accomplished}} more in her work with the joint campaign by the WWA and The Revolution to win a pardon for Hester Vaughn, a domestic worker who had been found guilty of infanticide and sentenced to death. Charging that the social and legal systems treated women unfairly, the WWA petitioned, organized a mass meeting at which Anthony {{was one of the}} speakers, and sent delegations to visit Vaughn in prison <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> with the governor. Vaughn was eventually pardoned.|$|E
25|$|To {{commemorate the}} centenary of International Women's Day in 2011 the National Federation of Women's Institutes - Wales (NFWI-Wales) {{organised}} 3 events. One each in in Cardiff, Llangollen and Carmarthen. Contributors at each event {{were asked to}} select {{a woman who had}} been inspirational <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> about her. Professor Donna Mead, who spoke in Carmarthen selected Betsi Cadwaladr. Following the event, The NFWI-Wales produced a booklet containing the presentations from across Wales. It transpired that Betsi Cadwaladr had been selected by Gretta Cartwright who spoke in Llangollen. So Betsi had two entries in that publication.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} {{ruled that}} the Freedom of the Press clause of the First Amendment protects associations of individuals in addition to individual speakers, and further that the First Amendment does not allow prohibitions of speech based on {{the identity of the}} speaker. Corporations, as associations of individuals therefore, have free speech rights under the First Amendment. Because spending money is essential to disseminating speech, as established in Buckley v. Valeo, limiting a corporation's ability to spend money is unconstitutional because it limits the ability of its members to associate effectively <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> on political issues.|$|E
25|$|Our true {{academic}} mission — to liberally educate {{each and}} every student — is a timeless reminder of the lives we change here at Wabash College, one young man at a time. For while the problems facing higher education and the world are complex, the solutions need not be. Amidst the jostle and the fray and the haranguing static and noise that often surround our academic endeavor, stands our foundation: the simple gifts of the liberal arts. These profound gifts — the ability to act, to see, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> — are the bedrock that underpin teaching and learning at Wabash College.|$|E
25|$|Salvation {{is deemed}} to require {{self-sacrifice}} in following the example and commandments of Jesus and suffering is revered. Members {{are encouraged to}} attend meetings <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> at them. Although the church has roots in the Holiness movement and has inherited some of its features, charismatic elements are suppressed. Other standards include modest dress, not wearing jewelry, long hair for women and short hair for men, not getting piercings, not dying hair, not getting a tattoo, and avoiding activities deemed to be worldly or frivolous (such as smoking, drinking alcohol, watching television, and viewing motion pictures). Standards and practices vary geographically: for example, in some areas fermented wine is used in Sunday meetings, in other areas grape juice is used; in some areas people who have divorced and remarried {{are not allowed to}} participate in meetings, in others they may. The use of television and other mass media is discouraged in some areas, based on the stance of the local workers and overseers. Some requirements have been loosened in recent years in response to criticisms aired on the Internet.|$|E

25|$|The Franks who {{expanded}} {{south into}} Gaul settled there and eventually adopted the Vulgar Latin {{of the local}} population. However, a Germanic language was spoken as a second tongue by public officials in western Austrasia and Neustria {{as late as the}} 850s. It completely disappeared as a spoken language from these regions during the 10th century. During this expansion to the south, many Frankish people remained in the north (i.e. southern Netherlands, Flanders and a small part of northern France). A widening cultural divide grew between the Franks remaining in the north and the rulers far to the south in what is now France. Salian Franks continued to reside in their original homeland and the area directly to the south <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> their original language, Old Frankish, which by the 9th century had evolved into Old Dutch. A Dutch-French language boundary came into existence (but this was originally south of where it is today). In the Maas and Rhine areas of the Netherlands, the Franks had political and trading centres, especially at Nijmegen and Maastricht. These Franks remained in contact with the Frisians to the north, especially in places like Dorestad and Utrecht.|$|E

The story followed two young planes, Happy Wings and Speedy, and a 1938 reprint included a foreword from Earhart, who embarked on her last flight three days after writing the piece; she disappeared while flying in 1937. Kalep later said of Earhart's disappearance: [...] "I miss her very much. When I heard that Amelia had disappeared, well, I fell apart."

Stone's immediate focus was on state referenda under consideration in New York and Nebraska. Stone presented a speech she had prepared entitled [...] "The Progress of Fifty Years" [...] wherein she described the milestones of change, and said [...] "I think, with never-ending gratitude, that the young women of today do not and can never know at what price their {{right to free speech}} <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> at all in public has been earned."
