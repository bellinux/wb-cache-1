50|$|Extremely intense {{solar proton}} flares capable of {{producing}} energetic protons with energies in excess of 100 MeV can increase neutron count rates <b>at</b> <b>ground</b> <b>levels</b> through secondary radiation effects. These rare events are known as <b>Ground</b> <b>Level</b> Enhancements(or GLEs).

5|$|Because {{scratches}} {{dominate the}} microwear {{texture of the}} teeth, Williams et al. suggested Edmontosaurus was a grazer instead of a browser, which would be predicted to have fewer scratches due to eating less abrasive materials. Candidates for ingested abrasives include silica-rich plants like horsetails and soil that was accidentally ingested due to feeding <b>at</b> <b>ground</b> <b>level.</b> The tooth structure indicates combined slicing and grinding capabilities.|$|E

5|$|As {{an active}} civil airfield, {{operations}} at Duxford are {{regulated by the}} Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). In 2002 a privately operated Aero L-39 Albatros suffered a braking failure on landing, overran the runway and {{came to rest on}} the M11 motorway, a student pilot being killed after ejecting <b>at</b> <b>ground</b> <b>level.</b> An Air Accidents Investigation Branch inquiry recommended a review of arrangements for aircraft taking off or landing towards the M11. As a result, the CAA and Duxford agreed to a reduction in the runway's 1500m declared length, from 1350m to 1200m, in order to provide a greater margin of error.|$|E
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>ground</b> <b>level</b> {{and inside}} the lobby, bas-reliefs depict {{the origins of the}} Price company. During the 1920s John M. Lyle, an {{influential}} architect of the Beaux-arts school, was developing a uniquely Canadian fusion of French and English colonial styles, and his ideas were applied by designers Ross and Macdonald to the construction of the Price Building. Each floor is symmetrically divided in two by a hallway, and a projection {{at the end of the}} building references the bow of a ship.|$|E
5|$|Broadwater Farm in Tottenham, in the Borough of Haringey, north London (N17), {{emerged from}} the British government's policy from the 1930s onwards of slum clearance, in which poorly {{maintained}} terraced houses were bulldozed {{to make way for}} high-rise social housing. Built between 1967 and 1973, the Farm consists of 1,063 flats (apartments) in 12 blocks raised on stilts, linked by first-floor outdoor connecting walkways; no homes or shops were built <b>at</b> <b>ground</b> <b>level</b> for fear of flooding from the nearby River Moselle. At the time of Blakelock's death, the estate housed 3,400 people, 49% white, 43% African Caribbean.|$|E
40|$|Seasonal {{occurrence}} of aphids and aphidophagous insects was monitored {{for six years}} (2006 – 2011) from full leaf expansion in May to leaf fall in October in “Desirable” variety pecan trees that were not treated with insecticides. Aphid outbreaks occurred two times per season, once {{in the spring and}} again in the late summer. Yellow pecan and blackmargined aphids exceeded the recommended treatment thresholds one time and black pecan aphids exceeded the recommended treatment levels three times over the six seasons. Increases in aphidophagous insect abundance coincided with aphid outbreaks in five of the six seasons. Among aphidophagous insects Harmonia axyridis and Olla v-nigrum were frequently collected in both the tree canopy and <b>at</b> the <b>ground</b> <b>level,</b> whereas, Coccinella septempunctata, Hippodamia convergens were rarely found in the tree canopy and commonly found <b>at</b> the <b>ground</b> <b>level.</b> Green lacewing abundance was higher in the <b>ground</b> <b>level</b> than in the tree canopy. Brown lacewings were more abundant in the tree canopy than <b>at</b> the <b>ground</b> <b>level.</b> Dolichopodid and syrphid fly abundance, <b>at</b> the <b>ground</b> <b>level</b> increased during peak aphid abundance in the tree canopy. Application of an aqueous solution of fermenting molasses to the pecan foliage during an aphid outbreak significantly increased the abundance of ladybeetles and lacewings and significantly reduced the abundance of yellow pecan, blackmargined and black pecan aphids...|$|R
40|$|Proof Search According to [12], {{abstract}} proof {{search is}} a process by which, starting from a representation of a problem <b>at</b> a so-called <b>ground</b> <b>level,</b> we construct a new and simpler representation at a so-called abstract level {{and use it to}} solve the original problem. That is, we abstract the given goal, prove its abstracted version and then use the information about the resulting abstract proof as an outline to construct the proof <b>at</b> the <b>ground</b> <b>level.</b> Dierent techniques to abstract from details have been studied in the literature. The problem is to nd out which details should be abstracted away. On one hand, if we abstract too much information then we often obtain abstract solutions that cannot be transferred to the <b>ground</b> <b>level.</b> Then, planning <b>at</b> the abstract level is even more dicult than planning <b>at</b> the <b>ground</b> <b>level</b> because the abstraction removes necessary control information, or we obtain only little information from the abstract proof how to guide the proof <b>at</b> the <b>ground</b> leve [...] ...|$|R

5|$|In a {{visit to}} Los Alamos in September 1944, von Neumann showed that the {{pressure}} increase from explosion shock wave reflection from solid objects was greater than previously believed if the angle of incidence of the shock wave was between 90° and some limiting angle. As a result, {{it was determined that}} the effectiveness of an atomic bomb would be enhanced with detonation some kilometers above the target, rather than <b>at</b> <b>ground</b> <b>level.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the centre}} of the castle is the keep, which has an {{external}} diameter of , an octagonal lower storey and circular walls on the upper levels. Originally this held accommodation for the captain and the garrison, but it was heavily redeveloped in the 19th and 20th centuries. Its exterior walls have eight recesses <b>at</b> <b>ground</b> <b>level,</b> originally used to store ammunition for the castle's guns. The basement of the keep was redesigned in the 1890s, when electrical generators were installed, protected by a new, thicker, concrete ceiling. It may originally have been vaulted in stone in a similar style to nearby Hurst Castle.|$|E
5|$|Located {{above the}} railway station, but {{nonetheless}} underground, is a metro station, which serves all six {{lines of the}} Oslo Metro. The next west-bound station is Majorstuen (formerly Valkyrie plass, but that station exists no more), while the next east-bound station is Stortinget. <b>At</b> <b>ground</b> <b>level,</b> there is transfer to lines 13 and 19 of the Oslo Tramway. The station {{is located on the}} Briskeby Line and serves westbound trains heading along the Briskeby and Lilleaker Lines, and eastbound station, via Jernbanetorget, along the Ekeberg Line and the Grünerløkka–Torshov Line. The station also serves Ruter buses 30, 31, 32, 70, 82 and 83.|$|E

5|$|The {{extent of}} the damage meant it was not {{possible}} to determine the exact source of ignition, but possibilities include an emergency generator and the depot's fire pump system.
