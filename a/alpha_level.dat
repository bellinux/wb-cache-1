40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the serum <b>levels</b> of interferon <b>alpha</b> in childhood-onset {{systemic lupus erythematosus}} patients, their first-degree relatives and healthy controls and to evaluate the associations between serum interferon alpha and disease activity, laboratory findings and treatment features. METHODS: We screened consecutive childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus patients in a longitudinal cohort at the pediatric rheumatology unit of the State University of Campinas between 2009 and 2010. All patients demonstrated disease onset {{before the age of}} 16. Disease status was assessed according to the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) and Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Damage Index (SDI). Interferon <b>alpha</b> <b>levels</b> were measured using an enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay. RESULTS: We included 57 childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus patients (mean age 17. 33 +/- 4. 50), 64 first-degree relatives (mean age 39. 95 +/- 5. 66), and 57 healthy (mean age 19. 30 +/- 4. 97) controls. Serum interferon <b>alpha</b> <b>levels</b> were significantly increased in childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus patients compared to their first-degree relatives and healthy controls. Interferon <b>alpha</b> <b>levels</b> were significantly increased in patients with positive dsDNA antibodies, patients with cutaneous vasculitis, patients with new malar rash and patients who were not receiving medication. Interferon <b>alpha</b> <b>levels</b> correlated with C 3 levels and systemic lupus erythematosus Disease Activity Index scores. In addition, we observed an inverse correlation between patient age and interferon <b>alpha</b> <b>levels.</b> CONCLUSION: Interferon <b>alpha</b> {{may play a role in}} the pathogenesis of childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus, especially in cutaneous manifestations and dsDNA antibody formation. The observation that interferon <b>alpha</b> <b>levels</b> are increased in patients who are not taking medication should be investigated in longitudinal studies to determine whether elevated interferon <b>alpha</b> <b>levels</b> may predict systemic lupus erythematosus flares...|$|R

In 41 cases of carcinoma and 10 cases of fibroadenoma, histologically non-malignant tissue was also obtained from the same breast. PGF 2 <b>alpha</b> <b>levels</b> were significantly elevated in breast cancer {{when compared with the}} normal tissues and benign diseases (P less than 0. 005 for each group). High PGF 2 <b>alpha</b> <b>levels</b> were positively correlated with differentiation, positive oestrogen and progestagen receptor status, and low mitotic index. Tumours with good prognosis (less than 20 mm, negative lymph nodes, some degree of differentiation) showed significantly higher PGF 2 <b>alpha</b> <b>levels</b> than tumours with a bad prognosis (greater than 20 mm, positive nodes and undifferentiated). A tendency for elevated PGF 2 <b>alpha</b> <b>levels</b> was observed with negative lymphatic permeation, postmenopausal status, low grade of nuclear and cellular polymorphism and high degree of elastosis and fibrosis. No correlation was observed between PGF 2 <b>alpha</b> <b>levels</b> and host-cell reaction. Plasma levels of 15 -keto- 13, 14 -dihydro-PGF 2 alpha were not elevated in cancer patients when compared with the SCD-group. The present study demonstrates that PGF 2 <b>alpha</b> <b>levels</b> are high in tumours with good prognosis. However, since other authors have suggested that a high PGE 2 production is a bad prognostic index, it is possible that conversion of PGE 2 to PGF 2 alpha by 9 -keto-reductase explains this relationship. Nevertheless, the presented results question the unrestricted use of prostaglandin-synthesis-inhibitors in the treatment of breast cancer...|$|R

40|$|Within 2 min {{following}} the intravenous injection of sheep erythrocytes (sRBC) there occurs 20 to 80 -fold increase in prostaglandin (PG) F 2 alpha in the spleen. This burst of synthesis {{is followed by}} a slow decline to control levels over the next 1 - 4 hr. No increase in splenic PGF 2 <b>alpha</b> <b>levels</b> is observed between 24 and 72 hr after injection. Injection of colloidal carbon results in a small increase, approximately 20 % of the increase in PGF 2 alpha observed with sRBC. The early increase in splenic PGF 2 <b>alpha</b> <b>levels</b> stimulated by sRBC is also dependent upon thymus-derived (T) cells, since the increase is small or nonexistent in athymic mice and NZB mice. Also, the elevation of splenic PGF 2 <b>alpha</b> <b>levels</b> is blocked by the administration of indomethacin or Ro 20 - 5720, both of which block the synthesis of prostglandin. A small increase (2 -fold) in PGF 2 <b>alpha</b> <b>levels</b> occurs in the thymus. A soluble antigen, bovine gamma globulin, stimulated a bimodal increase in splenic PGF 2 <b>alpha</b> <b>levels,</b> the early peak occurring at 2 hr and the later increase occurring at 48 hr. Using inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis, it is possible to enhance the appearance of cells forming 19 S antibody against sRBC, both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis enhances DNA synthesis induced in a two-way mixed-lymphocyte reaction only in whole spleen cell cultures and not in cultures of spleen cells purified by passage over glass wool. Based on this evidence, it is proposed that the prostaglandins represent a major soluble mediator in the control of T cell-T cell interactions and also play an important part in T-B (bone-marrow derived) cell interactions...|$|R

From the fact that TNF alpha was neutralized quantitatively by antibodies to human TNF alpha in feline monocyte supernatants and in feline sera, {{it was concluded that}} feline TNF alpha immunologically cross-reacts with human TNF alpha and that the human TNF alpha ELISA can be used to quantitate feline TNF alpha. During the first 6 months after experimental feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infection no differences in serum TNF alpha values were observed between infected and non-infected cats. TNF <b>alpha</b> <b>levels</b> increased significantly after primary vaccination with a feline leukemia virus (FeLV) vaccine in FIV infected cats over those in the non-infected controls.

50|$|When {{researchers}} repeatedly analyze data as more {{observations are}} added, {{the probability of}} a Type 1 error increases. Therefore, it is important to adjust the <b>alpha</b> <b>level</b> at each interim analysis, such that the overall Type 1 error rate remains at the desired level.

Transfection of estrogen receptor alpha into the estrogen receptor alpha negative cell line, MDA-MB- 231 decreased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor a mRNA and conversely inhibition of estrogen receptor alpha by ICI- 182 780 in estrogen receptor a positive, MCF- 7 cells increased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor a mRNA <b>levels.</b> Estrogen receptor <b>alpha</b> <b>levels</b> can be modulated by histone deacetylase inhibitors and such agents are in clinical trials for cancer treatment.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor a modulation was independent of estrogen receptor alpha, as a similar increase was observed in the estrogen receptor a negative MDA-MB- 231 cells. To further investigate the relationship between sodium butyrate and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha expression, we created an MCF- 7 cell line that conditionally over-expresses human peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha. Over-expression of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor protected MCF- 7 cells from sodium butyrate-mediated inhibition of proliferation and attenuated sodium butyrate-mediated induction of histone deacetylase 3 mRNA, indicating that elevated levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha may reduce the sensitivity of cells to histone deacetylase inhibitors.
