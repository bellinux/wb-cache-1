5|$|The abdomen is {{the section}} behind the metathorax, {{made up of}} a series of rings, each with a hole for {{breathing}} and respiration, called a spiracle, composing three different segmented sclerites: the tergum, pleura, and the sternum. The tergum in almost all species is membranous, or usually soft and concealed by the wings and elytra when not in flight. The pleura are usually small or hidden in some species, with each pleuron having a single spiracle. The sternum is the most widely visible part of the abdomen, being <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>or</b> <b>less</b> sclerotized segment. The abdomen itself does not have any appendages, but some (for example, Mordellidae) have articulating sternal lobes.|$|E

5|$|The {{back was}} also reconstructed in <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>or</b> <b>less</b> {{horizontal}} orientation by Borsuk-Białynicka, which {{was followed by}} most subsequent depictions. In a 2007 study, Daniela Schwarz and colleagues suggested that the back dipped towards the rear. According to these researchers, the shoulder blade would have been inclined at a horizontal angle of 55–65°, much steeper than previously thought, resulting in an elevated shoulder region. With the vertebral column of the trunk and neck held in a relatively straight line, this would result in an elevated position of the head.|$|E
5|$|After {{the initial}} {{transfer}} of forces in March 1901, further progress was slow as administrative and legislative instruments {{took time to}} develop. Indeed, {{it was not until}} 1 March 1904 that the Defence Act 1903 was proclaimed, providing the Commonwealth Military Forces a statutory framework within which they could operate. Amidst a background of political manoeuvring and personal agendas, the military forces were eventually reorganised into <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>or</b> <b>less</b> unified command structure. As a part of this, state-based mounted units were reformed into light horse regiments, supplemented by the transfer of men from a number of superfluous infantry units, while the remaining infantry were organised into battalions of the Australian Infantry Regiment and engineers and artillery were organised into field companies and garrison artillery batteries. Due to the provisions of the Defence Act which did not provide {{for the establishment of a}} regular infantry force, the notion that the Commonwealth Military Forces would be largely based on a part-time militia was set out in legislation.|$|E
5|$|De Lucía {{was widely}} {{considered}} to be the world's premier flamenco guitarist and by many to be Spain's greatest musical export. He had a revolutionary influence on flamenco music both as a composer and otherwise. His influence on flamenco guitar has been compared with that of Andrés Segovia's on classical guitar. His album Fuente y Caudal (Fountain and Flow) has been cited by many to have changed the world of flamenco guitar beyond traditional flamenco culture. Along with Enrique Morente and Camarón de la Isla, de Lucía was the first artist to break away from traditional flamenco and form what is now known as nuevo flamenco. As a composer, de Lucía was the first Spanish artist to mix jazz with Andalusian music in <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>or</b> <b>less</b> systematic way. This includes, but is not limited to, his collaborations with Di Meola, McLaughlin, and Pedro Iturralde.|$|E

5|$|The Holderness {{landscape}} {{is dominated by}} deposits of till, boulder clays and glacial lake clays. These were deposited during the Devensian glaciation. The glacial deposits form <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>or</b> <b>less</b> continuous lowland plain which has some peat filled depressions (known locally as meres) which mark the presence of former lake beds. There are other glacial landscape features such as drumlin mounds, ridges and kettle holes scattered throughout the area. The well drained glacial deposits provide fertile soils that can support intensive arable cultivation. Fields are generally large and bounded by drainage ditches. There is very little woodland {{in the area and}} this leads to a landscape that is essentially rural but very flat and exposed.|$|E
5|$|The {{presumption}} that carnivorous dinosaurs, like Megalosaurus, were quadrupeds was first {{challenged by the}} find of Compsognathus in 1859. That, however, was a very small animal, the significance of which for gigantic forms could be denied. In 1870, near Oxford, the type specimen of Eustreptospondylus was discovered - the first reasonably intact skeleton of a large theropod. It was clearly bipedal. Shortly afterwards, John Phillips created the first public display of a theropod skeleton in Oxford, arranging the known Megalosaurus bones, held by recesses in cardboard sheets, in <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>or</b> <b>less</b> natural position. During the 1870s, North American discoveries of large theropods, like Allosaurus, confirmed that they were bipedal. The Oxford University Museum of Natural History display contains most of the specimens from the original description by Buckland.|$|E
5|$|The sparsely-spotted {{stingray}} has <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>or</b> <b>less</b> diamond-shaped {{pectoral fin}} disc wider than long, with rounded outer corners. The anterior {{margins of the}} disc are nearly straight and converge at an obtuse angle on the fleshy snout, the tip of which barely protrudes from the disc. The small eyes are immediately followed by comma-shaped spiracles with angular or rounded posterior rims. The outer rim of each nostril is enlarged into a knob towards the back. Between the nostrils is a bell-shaped curtain of skin with a finely fringed trailing margin; only the Kapala stingaree (U.kapalensis) has a similarly shaped nasal curtain. The small mouth contains five or six papillae (nipple-like structures) on the floor, most of which have forked tips. Additional small papillae are present {{on the outside of}} the lower jaw. The teeth in both jaws are small with roughly oval bases, and are arranged in a quincunx pattern. The five pairs of gill slits are short. The pelvic fins are small and rounded.|$|E

From there and until the Gate of Rhegion the wall follows <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>or</b> <b>less</b> {{straight}} line to the north, climbing the city's Seventh Hill. From there the wall turns sharply to the northeast, climbing up to the Gate of St. Romanus, located near {{the peak of the}} Seventh Hill at some 68m above sea level. From there the wall descends into the valley of the river Lycus, where it reaches its lowest point at 35m above sea level. Climbing the slope of the Sixth Hill, the wall then rises up to the Gate of Charisius or Gate of Adrianople, at some 76m height. From the Gate of Adrianople to the Blachernae, the walls fall to a level of some 60 m. From there the later walls of Blachernae project sharply to the west, reaching the coastal plain at the Golden Horn near the so-called Prisons of Anemas.|$|E
5|$|In {{its early}} days tourism was a {{relatively}} new concept, but grew slowly before exploding {{with the advent of}} air travel around 1959, the year Hawaii became a state. Today tourism is driven by the island's exotic tropical locations, and Kīlauea, being one of the few volcanoes in the world in <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>or</b> <b>less</b> constant state of moderate eruption, is {{a major part of the}} island's tourist draw. Today, Kīlauea is visited by roughly 2.6 million people annually, most of whom proceed up the volcano from the recently revamped Kilauea Visitor Center near the park entrance. The Thomas A. Jaggar Museum is also a popular tourist stop; located at the edge of Kīlauea caldera, the museum's observation deck offers the best sheltered view on the volcano of the activity at Halemaumau Crater. The Volcano House still provides the nearest lodging, and the nearby Volcano Village the most numerous; visitors associated with the military can find lodging at the Kilauea Military Camp. A number of hiking trails, points of interest, and guided ranger programs exist, and the Chain of Craters Road, Hilina Pali Road, and Crater Rim Drive provide access. In 2008, Lava Viewing Area was opened for tourists in Kalapana on the southeastern side of the National Park, accessible only from State Route 130.|$|E
5|$|The {{cerebrum}} {{is connected}} by the brainstem to the spinal cord. The brainstem {{consists of the}} midbrain, the pons, and the medulla oblongata. The cerebellum {{is connected to the}} brainstem by pairs of tracts. Within the cerebrum is the ventricular system, consisting of four interconnected ventricles in which cerebrospinal fluid is produced and circulated. Underneath the cerebral cortex are several important structures, including the thalamus, the epithalamus, the pineal gland, the hypothalamus, the pituitary gland, and the subthalamus; the limbic structures, including the amygdala and the hippocampus; the claustrum, the various nuclei of the basal ganglia; the basal forebrain structures, and the three circumventricular organs. The cells of the brain include neurons and supportive glial cells. There are more than 86 billion neurons in the brain, and <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>or</b> <b>less</b> equal number of other cells. Brain activity is made possible by the interconnections of neurons and their release of neurotransmitters in response to nerve impulses. Neurons form elaborate neural networks of neural pathways and circuits. The whole circuitry is driven by the process of neurotransmission.|$|E

5|$|The lichen has a {{distinct}} prothallus—fibers of whitish fungal hyphae at the edge that lack photobiont, and which project beyond the thallus onto the growing surface. The prothallus is red to whitish in the inner part, red the in outer part. The surface of the thallus {{does not have a}} well-defined cortex, an outer layer of well-packed hyphae. The medulla (a loosely arranged layer of hyphae below the cortex and photobiont zone) is whitish but the lower part is red. It has few to many calcium oxalate crystals that are 3–8μm diameter. The hyphae of the medulla have many such crystals on the walls, that are 1–2μm in diameter. The algal photobiont (technically a phycobiont, as it is a green algal photosynthetic partner) is from the genus Trentepohlia. Normally, the algae is long and filamentous; when in the lichen state, it is divided into shorter filaments. The alga has a large chloroplast that contains droplets of beta-carotene. The lichen is heteromerous, meaning that the mycobiont and photobiont components are in well-defined layers, with the photobiont in <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>or</b> <b>less</b> distinct zone between the upper cortex and the medulla. Cells are single or a few cells aggregated, with dimensions of about 8–15 by 5–11μm.|$|E
5|$|Though the {{majority}} of specimens are almost or even totally black, (with the exception of head and facial markings), the color pattern may consist of a brown, gray, tan, yellowish-olive, or blackish ground color, which is overlaid {{with a series of}} 10–17 dark brown to almost black crossbands. These crossbands, which usually have black edges, are sometimes broken along the dorsal midline to form a series of staggered halfbands {{on either side of the}} body. These crossbands are visibly lighter in the center, almost matching the ground color, often contain irregular dark markings, and extend well down onto the ventral scales. The dorsal banding pattern fades with age, so older individuals are an almost uniform olive-brown, grayish-brown, or black. The belly is white, yellowish-white, or tan, marked with dark spots, and becomes darker posteriorly. The amount of dark pigment on the belly varies from virtually none to almost completely black. The head is <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>or</b> <b>less</b> uniform brown color, especially in A. p. piscivorus. Subadult specimens may exhibit the same kind of dark, parietal spots characteristic of A. contortrix, but sometimes these are still visible in adults. Eastern populations have a broad, dark, postocular stripe, bordered with pale pigment above and below, that is faint or absent in western populations. The underside of the head is generally whitish, cream, or tan.|$|E
5|$|Whatever {{the true}} impact of Marwan's campaigns, warfare between the Khazars and the Arabs ceased {{for more than}} two decades after 737. Arab {{military}} activity in the Caucasus continued until 741, with Marwan launching repeated expeditions against the various princes of the northern Caucasus, most notably Tuman Shah. Nevertheless, these campaigns, according to Blankinship, seem to have been closer to raids, designed to seize plunder and extract tribute to pay for the upkeep of the Arab army, rather than attempts at permanent conquest. Despite the Umayyad success at establishing <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>or</b> <b>less</b> stable frontier anchored at Derbent, Blankinship is also critical of the long-term results of the Second Arab–Khazar War: Arab control was in reality limited to the lowlands and coast, and the land itself was too poor to recompense the expenses sustained during the wars. Furthermore, the need to maintain the large garrison at Derbent further depleted the already overstretched Syro-Jaziran army, the main pillar of the Umayyad regime. Eventually, this weakening of the Syrian army would be the major factor in the fall of the Umayyad dynasty during the Muslim civil wars of the 740s and the Abbasid Revolution that followed them.|$|E
