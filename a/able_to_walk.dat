5|$|Like other hadrosaurids, it was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> {{on either}} two legs or four. It {{probably}} preferred to forage for food on four legs, but ran on two. The neural spines of the vertebrae were tall, as was common in lambeosaurines; tallest over the hips, they increased {{the height of}} the back. Skin impressions are known for P. walkeri, showing uniform tubercle-like scales but no larger structures.|$|E
5|$|A row {{of fifty}} Norway spruce trees lines the main {{driveway}} {{leading to the}} farm. These trees represent the fifty U.S. states, and were given to Eisenhower as birthday presents {{from each of the}} state Republican Party chairmen in 1955. The furthest one from the house was the tree representing Texas, and it was seen as a mark of Eisenhower's recovery that he was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> that far after his heart attack.|$|E

One of the children from the program is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> show his parents that he has learned <b>to</b> <b>walk.</b> First, he is can simply move his legs, then after a regimen of walking exercises, he stands and finally takes his first unaided steps, <b>able</b> <b>to</b> eventually <b>walk</b> alone down a crowded city street.|$|R
5|$|Businesses in Chinatown {{attempted}} to raise $200,000 {{to build an}} 11-story bell tower pagoda {{at the south end}} of the park. The tower was planned to be constructed of brick and stone with a hollow interior. While visitors would not have been able to climb the structure, they would have been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> through an entrance at its base. Chicago Sun-Times writer Lee Bey believed the bell tower to be the park's most important feature. Despite the Taiwanese government making an early commitment to help finance the tower, it was never constructed.|$|E
5|$|Joseph Meegar (Ebon Moss-Bachrach), a shy {{delivery}} boy {{who lives}} with his mother (Marylouise Burke), arrives late for work and delivers a package to an office building where he comes across Bethany (Diane Davis), a receptionist with whom he's infatuated. Afterward, while in an elevator, Bethany notices Meegar has pictures of her on his cell phone. Meegar's angst then apparently causes the elevator to fall to the underground parking lot levels, killing all but Meegar. He is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> away unharmed, but is then startled as all the car alarms go off around him.|$|E
5|$|Morton was {{partially}} crippled by a paralytic stroke in October 1865 which incapacitated {{him for a}} time. For treatment, Morton traveled to Europe where he sought the assistance of several specialists, but none were able to help his paralysis. During his recovery, Lieutenant Governor Conrad Baker served as acting governor. With the war ending, Baker oversaw the demobilization {{of most of the}} state's forces. Morton returned to the governorship in March 1866, but he was never again <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> without assistance.|$|E

5|$|Although {{partially}} blind from glaucoma {{by the age}} of 109 {{and completely}} blind from cataracts by 111, he nevertheless retained his memory and good health until his final days; his medical history showed no signs of high blood pressure, heart or kidney trouble or diabetes. He was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> without a cane or walker, preferring not to use one, and was able to feed himself, including Cheerios for breakfast, his favorite vanilla ice cream with his other meals and a daily can of Ensure for energy. While he enjoyed recounting tales from his military experience, he never complained about the segregated nature of his unit, preferring instead to focus on his own exploits on the job.|$|E

50|$|During her {{recovery}} in Adelaide she {{was introduced to}} basketball, which she enjoyed. She gained some feeling in her legs and she was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> learn <b>to</b> <b>walk,</b> sit and stand. When she returned to Darwin she started a double degree in art and law. She also took up basketball competitively where she made the Northern Territory state team with Nadya Romeo. She was selected for the Australian Women's wheelchair basketball team and she joined them at the Paralympics in Sydney in 2000. The team included her previous team mate Nadya Romeo and Melanie Hall and they came second and were awarded silver medals.|$|R
5|$|At a Jewish synagogue, where Grace and Leo's {{wedding is}} to take place, Grace learns from her mother, Bobbi (Debbie Reynolds), that her father will not be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> her down the aisle. Grace panics, but Karen {{suggests}} that Will should walk with her instead. She agrees and calls upon him.

5|$|By 1604, when Charles {{was three}} and a half, he was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> {{the length of the}} great hall at Dunfermline Palace without assistance, and it was decided that he was strong enough to make the journey to England to be reunited with his family. In mid-July 1604, Charles left Dunfermline for England where he was to spend {{most of the rest of}} his life. In England, Charles was placed under the charge of Elizabeth, Lady Carey, the wife of courtier Sir Robert Carey, who put him in boots made of Spanish leather and brass to help {{strengthen}} his weak ankles. His speech development was also slow, and he retained a stammer, or hesitant speech, for the rest of his life.|$|E
5|$|In 1869, John and Agnes Macdonald had a daughter, Mary. It {{soon became}} {{apparent}} that Mary had ongoing developmental issues. She was never <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk,</b> nor did she ever fully develop mentally. Hewitt Bernard, Deputy Minister of Justice and Macdonald's former secretary, also lived in the Macdonald house in Ottawa, together with Bernard's widowed mother. In May 1870, John Macdonald fell ill with gallstones; coupled with his frequent drinking, he may have developed a severe case of acute pancreatitis. In July, he moved to Prince Edward Island to convalesce, most likely conducting discussions aimed at drawing the island into Confederation {{at a time when}} some there supported joining the United States. The island joined Confederation in 1873.|$|E
50|$|Female zebras mature {{earlier than}} the males, and a mare may have her first foal {{by the age of}} three. Males are not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> breed until the age of five or six. Mares may give birth to one foal every twelve months. She nurses the foal for up to a year. Like horses, zebras are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> stand, <b>walk</b> and suckle shortly after they are born. A zebra foal is brown and white instead of black and white at birth.|$|R

50|$|The Kid Who Batted 1.000 is {{the name}} of two {{separate}} books, both juvenile baseball novels. The key plot device - the advent of a young batsman who is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> achieve a <b>walk</b> (base on balls) at every plate appearance - is identical in both novels.|$|R
5|$|In {{the second}} season, she forms {{a bond with}} {{newcomer}} Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet), and later romances her first boyfriend Finn, reigniting her animosity with club co-captain Rachel Berry (Lea Michele). In the third season, Quinn intends to get full custody of her daughter, Beth, and her attempts to prove Shelby Corcoran (Idina Menzel)—the adoptive mother of Beth—an unfit mother fail; eventually, she realizes that Shelby is Beth's true mother. Quinn subsequently receives a college acceptance letter from Yale, and while driving to Finn and Rachel's wedding, her car is struck by a truck and she suffers a spinal injury that requires her to use a wheelchair for many weeks. She is eventually <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> again.|$|E
5|$|Nicholas Edmund Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 12th Earl of Shaftesbury (born 3 June 1979), {{a former}} DJ and house music {{promoter}} in New York and Privilege in Ibiza, Spain. A short time following his brother's death, Nicholas relocated {{to the family}} seat at Wimborne St Giles, returned to business school {{for a couple of}} years, and assumed the responsibilities of the earldom. He has shown an interest in supporting charitable organisations, primarily those addressing the needs of children with disabilities. In December 2009, Nicholas suffered serious spinal injuries in a horse riding accident. He crushed his vertebrae in the fall. While he experienced initial paralysis necessitating the use of a wheelchair, physical therapy has helped restore his health {{to the point where he}} is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk,</b> with limitations. With continued rehabilitation, doctors expect a full recovery.|$|E
5|$|The {{dangers of}} ski flying {{were still on}} full display at the 1992 Ski Flying World Championships in Harrachov, where Andreas Goldberger {{suffered}} a similar crash to the ones which occurred in Kulm in 1986.

He was taken by helicopter to a hospital, having sustained a broken arm and collarbone. František Jež also crashed, but was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> away with some help.|$|E
50|$|London's lack of {{bridges and}} rolling marshy {{landscape}} {{to the south}} and east were perfect for access by boat and the Thames was the main thoroughfare for all kinds of traffic. In the 15th and 16th centuries the narrow spans of the Old London Bridge restricted the flow of the slow moving and meandering river Thames allowing it to freeze during the winter months complete with frost fair so that Londoners were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> simply <b>walk</b> across the frozen river.|$|R

50|$|In the park, {{residents}} are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> fish, <b>walk,</b> bike, and {{swim in the}} public pool. A gazebo provides {{a view of the}} pond's drop off into the falls. In the summer, the Newington Extravaganza allows patrons to ride boats around the pond and past the falls. A well maintained landscape and small garden close to the falls make it a very popular location for weddings and other ceremonies. During the Christmas season, the bridge and observation area are decorated with Christmas lights and other decorations.|$|R
5|$|They are {{alerted to}} {{eyewitness}} accounts {{of a woman}} who, after jumping with another man from a high roof and crashing onto a taxi parked below, simply walked away. As the Fringe team investigates, they are approached by another FBI agent, Lincoln Lee (Seth Gabel), who identifies the woman as Dana Gray (Paula Malcomson). Dana, who had been struck by lightning twice, was killed eighteen months earlier along with her family during a robbery of their home, but she apparently was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> away from the morgue. Since then, she has appeared to commit suicide with several others, but always managing to walk away. Walter (John Noble) and Bell, in studying Dana's blood samples, find that her body may have been altered by several past lightning strikes, making her incapable of dying.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the race, Rosberg got off the line well and overtook {{teammate}} Hamilton for the lead going into turn one. Coming out of the following turn, Kimi Räikkönen was caught out by heavy wheelspin on his harder tyre compound going side by side and swept to the outside of the track, crashing into Fernando Alonso's McLaren, who was lifted on top of the Ferrari. Both drivers were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> away unharmed from the incident. The collision brought out the safety car. At the end of the lap, Daniil Kvyat made a pit stop to replace a damaged front wing, while Will Stevens retired from the race with an oil leak. When the safety car came back into the pit lane on the end of lap six, Rosberg was able to defend his lead against Hamilton and quickly built a gap, leading him by 2.3 seconds by lap eleven. Lap twelve saw the second McLaren of Jenson Button retiring with an intake system sensor failure.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{retirement}} on 30 November 1976 {{he continued to}} work, both at the Museum and at the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew, where his home at 17 High Park Road, Kew Gardens, Richmond (see image), gave him access to the herbarium and library, a short bicycle trip away. Indeed, 35% of his total publications appeared in the quarter century of {{his retirement}}. He was commissioned to write {{a history of the}} Museum for its centenary (1981), although he did so with some difficulty, due to deadlines and budget constraints. The task, which took three years, was made more difficult for him by the Museum's decision to censor his critical comments. He continued his association with the Lindley Library all his life, being an active committee member and regularly attended RHS flower shows even after he was barely <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Webster {{ruling is}} a test case in {{association}} football law involving Andy Webster, a defender formerly with Heart of Midlothian football club in Edinburgh, Scotland.

Although the long-term effects of the decision remain unclear, it has been compared to the landmark Bosman ruling of 1995 in its potential significance.|$|R
