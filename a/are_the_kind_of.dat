5|$|The {{way that}} leads to the abyss for the German people has now come. The party patriots {{continue}} ever to believe and hope. Also, there are still those who do not want to see, and they expect a miracle from the Führer. Those <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> people who do not give up hope even {{at the edge of the}} grave. In all other respects, the number of peace seekers grows from hour to hour. The coming generations, and the foreign countries, will want to understand why the German people themselves did not turn against the party tyranny and stop the Nazi Party leaders by force in order to terminate this horrible war. For this, something should be said to clear up the question.|$|E
500|$|David Fricke of the Rolling Stone in {{a review}} of ¡Uno! {{compared}} the theme of the song with [...] "Stay the Night", another song on the album, stating; [...] "'Stay the Night' and 'Let Yourself Go' <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> pop-smart here's-my-fucking-problem miniatures Armstrong was writing like second nature when he, Dirnt and Cool were too young to drink (legally) where they gigged. But Armstrong is 40 now, married and a dad, and a lot of this ruckus sounds designed to drown out the time bombs ticking in his head and the maddening static outside".|$|E
500|$|Eno {{has also}} said the album is about [...] "paint {{a picture of the}} human trying to survive in an {{increasingly}} digital world;" [...] themes that are explored in this song. [...] "Strange Overtones" [...] has been described as [...] "a song about writing a song"—the subject of the song struggles to write innovative music, but is overheard by a neighbor using beats that are [...] "twenty years old." [...] In terms of the genre of music, both Byrne and Eno have called it [...] "electronic Gospel"—the backing tracks <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> electronic music for which Eno is known, paired with hopeful and inspiring lyrics from Byrne— this song in particular features an uptempo backing track. Eno had been thinking about Gospel for several years, but couldn't write lyrics to hopeful songs.|$|E

500|$|When Goebel's son, Paul G. Goebel, Jr., ran for Ford's Congressional seat in 1974, then President Ford {{returned}} to Grand Rapids {{to campaign for}} Goebel's son. Ford delivered a speech at Calvin College in Grand Rapids {{the week before the}} election in which he said: [...] "Paul Goebel I have known since he was just a lad. His dad knew me when I was back at South High—an inspired if not very competent football player. But I have known the Goebel family a long time, and they are strong and they are tall, and they <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> people who are dedicated to public service. Paul, Jr.'s, father was; Paul, Jr., himself is. And I have seen nothing but the finest in that family, and young Paul, he epitomizes all the great characteristics of that family." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite the Mayo Foundation's {{arguments}} otherwise, the Court {{ruled that}} [...] "student" [...] was a sufficiently ambiguous term {{to state that}} Congress has specifically addressed the issue. The Court also noted that Congress in the past had specifically singled out medical residents when making exemptions available, which in the Court's eyes made the Mayo Foundation's arguments about unambiguity unreasonable. Therefore, according to Chevron, {{the role of the}} courts should solely be to determine whether the Treasury Department made a reasonable decision—and the Court concluded that the Treasury did just that. In writing for the Court, Roberts stated that [...] "The [...] department certainly did not act irrationally in concluding that these doctors – 'who work long hours, serve as high [...] skilled professionals, and typically share {{some or all of the}} terms of employment of career employees' – <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> workers that Congress intended to both contribute and benefit from the Social Security system".|$|E
500|$|Production lasted six months. The {{production}} crew {{considered the most}} challenging part of creating the OVA to be making [...] "Nomura's drawings move on screen." [...] Because Last Order was hand-drawn, the crew faced difficulties creating uniform lines. Another issue was the overall feel of each scene; original drawings were done by several artists, resulting in various scenes having different styles. Producer Akio Ofuji explained that they [...] "wanted {{to make sure the}} final product was of very high quality, so [...] worked with the production company day and night, straight through to the deadline." [...] Nomura and Ofuji agreed that many scenes showing important events and feelings in Final Fantasy VII had been fragmented and disjointed, and so they had decided that those scenes would be the subject of Last Order, giving the audience of Advent Children (the film Last Order was released with) a [...] "more enjoyable understanding." [...] They used the film as an opportunity to portray Zack [...] "properly" [...] as a [...] "handsome, light-hearted man [...] was in everyone's memory". Last Order also details Tseng's growth and his feelings towards his both job and events depicted, wherein he attempts to [...] "get his own ideas of justice heard" [...] but later abandons his moral values [...] "in order to carry out a cruel mission." [...] Ofuji commented that [...] "those <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> scenes we wanted people to be more aware of." ...|$|E

500|$|Paramount CEO Sherry Lansing revived studio {{interest}} in 1998. Schroeder, who shepherded Tim Burton's Edward Scissorhands as a studio executive at 20th Century Fox in 1990, suggested that Burton direct the film. Francis Ford Coppola's minimal production duties came from American Zoetrope; Burton only {{became aware of}} Coppola's involvement during the editing process when he was sent a copy of Sleepy Hollows trailer and saw Coppola's name on it. Burton, coming off the troubled production of Superman Lives, was hired to direct in June 1998. [...] "I had never really done something that {{was more of a}} horror film," [...] he explained, [...] "and it's funny, because those <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> movies that I like probably more than any other genre." [...] His {{interest in}} directing a horror film influenced by his love for Hammer Film Productions and Black Sunday—particularly the supernatural feel they evoked as a result of being filmed primarily on sound stages. As a result, Sleepy Hollow is a homage to various Hammer Film Productions, including Dr. Jekyll and Sister Hyde, and other films such as Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein, various Roger Corman horror films, Jason and the Argonauts, and Scream Blacula Scream. The image of the Headless Horseman had fascinated Burton during his apprenticeship as a Disney animator at CalArts in the early 1980s. [...] "One of my teachers had worked on the Disney version as one of the layout artists on the chase, and he brought in some layouts from it, so that was exciting. It {{was one of the things}} that maybe shaped what I like to do." [...] Burton worked with Walker on rewrites, but Rudin suggested that Tom Stoppard rewrite the script to add to the comical aspects of Ichabod's bumbling mannerisms, and emphasize the character's romance with Katrina. His work went uncredited through the WGA screenwriting credit system.|$|E

Another cover the band played at these sessions was The Wailer's [...] "Dancing Shoes". [...] "Garageland" [...] was written in response to Charles Shaar Murray's damning review of the Clash's early appearance at the Sex Pistols Screen on the Green concert – [...] "The Clash <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> garage band who should be returned to the garage immediately, preferably with the engine running". It was the final track recorded for the album.|$|E

Feeling that he had been misunderstood as an artist, he returned to a folk rock sound, more comparable to what had been present on his independent albums. Many people were surprised to hear him release music in this style and drew comparisons to Mumford & Sons, but DeWyze responded, [...] "anyone can go back and listen to what I was doing when I was sixteen or seventeen years old, those <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> records that I was making then. I just wasn't able to put them out there like I am now." ...|$|E
