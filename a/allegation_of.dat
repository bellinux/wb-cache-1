5|$|Both the {{defendant}} and the State Attorney may appeal the decision; the appeal would {{be heard by}} a panel of the Prague High Court, consisting of three professional judges.

The petition may be based on <b>allegation</b> <b>of</b> violation of rights under the Czech Constitution and Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms.|$|E
5|$|Kenyatta's {{academic}} progress was unremarkable, and in July 1912 {{he became an}} apprentice to the carpenter at the mission. At Easter 1912, he professed his dedication to Christianity and began undergoing catechism. In 1913, he underwent the Kikuyu circumcision ritual; the missionaries generally disapproved of this custom, {{but it was an}} important aspect of Kikuyu tradition, allowing Kenyatta to be recognised as an adult. Asked to take a Christian name, he chose both John and Peter after the eponymous Apostles in the New Testament. The missionaries however insisted that he select only one, and so he chose Johnstone, the -stone being selected because it was a Biblical reference to Peter. Accordingly, he was baptised as Johnstone Kamau in August 1914. After his baptism, Kenyatta moved out of the mission dormitory and lived with friends. Having completed his apprenticeship to a carpenter, Kenyatta requested that the mission allow him to be an apprentice stonemason, but they refused. Kenyatta then requested that he be recommended for employment, but the head missionary refused because of an <b>allegation</b> <b>of</b> minor dishonesty.|$|E

On January 7th, 2016, Tran was again denied bail, and another preliminary hearing was set for February 26th, 2016. At the February 26th hearing, Sacramento County Deputy District Attorney Anthony Ortiz informed Superior Court Judge Geoffrey Goodman that his department plans to amend the original criminal charges against Tran, to include gang involvement in the assault. A gang involvement charge in California provides for additional penalties if the defendant is found guilty.

5|$|Jardine {{threatened}} to withdraw his {{team from the}} Fourth and Fifth Tests unless the Australian Board retracted the accusation of unsporting behaviour. The MCC responded angrily to the accusations of unsporting conduct, played down the Australian claims {{about the danger of}} Bodyline and {{threatened to}} call off the tour. The series had become a major diplomatic incident by this stage, and many people saw Bodyline as damaging to an international relationship that needed to remain strong. The public in both England and Australia reacted with outrage towards the other nation. Alexander Hore-Ruthven, the Governor of South Australia, who was in England at the time, expressed his concern to J. H. Thomas, the British Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs that this would cause a significant impact on trade between the nations. The standoff was settled only when Australian Prime Minister Joseph Lyons met members of the Australian Board and outlined to them the severe economic hardships that could be caused in Australia if the British public boycotted Australian trade. Given this understanding, the Board withdrew the <b>allegation</b> <b>of</b> unsportsmanlike behaviour two days before the fourth Test, thus saving the tour. However, correspondence continued for almost a year. Fingleton was dropped after scoring a pair in the third Test, and England won the final two matches to win the series 4–1.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims to {{contribute}} to and clarify the debate around false <b>allegations</b> <b>of</b> sexual assault by providing a summary of recent literature, including consideration of the classifications and methods of defining a false allegation, {{whether there is a}} prevailing scepticism around <b>allegations</b> <b>of</b> sexual assault, and the motivations for falsifying reports. Key messages:There is ongoing speculation about the prevalence <b>of</b> false <b>allegations</b> <b>of</b> sexual assault, however, without consistency in definition and classification of what actually is a false <b>allegation,</b> accurate measurement <b>of</b> prevalence is difficult. Assumptions are made about the truth <b>of</b> <b>allegations</b> <b>of</b> sexual assault at various decision-making points in the justice response. These assumptions are based on individual and societal beliefs about gender roles and sexual assault that may not accord with the actual experiences of sexual assault. The perception that false <b>allegations</b> <b>of</b> sexual assault are common has negative consequences for victims of sexual assault and society more generally by perpetuating victims’ fear of being disbelieved or being blamed for the assault. This reduces the likelihood of reporting. A more useful approach to considering false <b>allegations</b> <b>of</b> sexual assault is to undertake more contextual analysis of the factors that play into a label <b>of</b> false <b>allegations...</b>|$|R
