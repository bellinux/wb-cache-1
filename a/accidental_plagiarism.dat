50|$|Cryptomnesia {{occurs when}} an {{individual}} is certain that a certain word, idea, song, etc. is their own original thought when in actuality, someone else has already thought of it, resulting in <b>accidental</b> <b>plagiarism.</b> In order to prevent this, it would require mental scanning to avoid replicating the thought as one's own. However, this slows down the quick retrieval of memory needed in daily life, such as in conversation. This has seen {{to occur in the}} music industry and has the implication of copyright infringement over songs, {{as well as in the}} formation of scientific research ideas.|$|E
40|$|With {{the rise}} of {{accessibility}} to the internet, {{it is easier for}} students to commit plagiarism. But which {{students are more likely to}} do so?  Even more important is the extent to which students commit plagiarism on purpose. The aim of this literature review is to answer these questions. It appears that international students who are young, internal (meaning that they are attending their 'own' university) and more experienced  (meaning higher years of enrollment) are more likely to commit plagiarism than other students. In addition, students who frequently procrastinate are also more likely to commit plagiarism. Furthermore, intended plagiarism seems to be quite rare, while <b>accidental</b> <b>plagiarism</b> is quite common. The most commonly heard explanation for <b>accidental</b> <b>plagiarism</b> is that students lack knowledge about how to avoid plagiarism. In the discussion section, some suggestions for making students aware of plagiarism are proposed. An increase in awareness and knowledge should lead to a drop in the prevalence of plagiarism...|$|E
40|$|This {{is a study}} {{about the}} act of {{plagiarism}} in scientific writing. Based on the previous research, {{the researchers found that}} the writings analysed contain plagiarism, both deliberate and <b>accidental</b> <b>plagiarism.</b> Their Writers are accused to do the plagiarism because they cited the refrences without putting the source; they wrote the sources of reference incompletely; they did drect quotatins in the forms of pharaphrase; and they made close paraphrase...|$|E
30|$|<b>Accidental</b> or unintentional <b>plagiarism</b> {{may occur}} when authors are largely unaware of {{citation}} and documentation rules guiding scientific practice.

40|$|For a song {{to attract}} {{copyright}} it must be original. Songwriters therefore need to avoid plagiarism whilst working within the established constraints of song form. Any song that is too similar to another will breach its copyright; one that deviates too far from established norms may not survive the marketplace. Copyright law protects songwriters from <b>accidental</b> or flagrant <b>plagiarism,</b> but it can only protect musical elements that can be codified. Demers argues that {{this has led to}} a privileging of melody, lyric and harmony, offering these elements more protection than auditory artefacts such as timbre, production or arrangement. Industrially, ‘song’ and ‘track’ are economically separated but in creative practice - and in the ear of the listener - the distinction is not so easy to make. This paper will explore the difference between song originality as enshrined in case law and will contrast these with examples of homage/copying that have not been shown to infringe copyright. Drawing on the presenter’s own experience as an expert witness musicologist in copyright disputes, it will discuss the moral and legal ambiguity of the dividing line between ‘song’ and ‘track’ and what this means for songwriting’s creative development in the future...|$|R
40|$|This trial {{concerns}} <b>accidental</b> <b>plagiarism</b> on {{an assignment}} {{in a second}} year [Arcade Games] class. The violation was unusual because the assignment was not what is typically discussed when considering plagiarism. Furthermore, the two other students in that section of the class had violated the code on the same assignment, and the professor had confronted them as a group for what ended up being separate violations. The jury focused heavily on the intent and extent of the violation, {{and whether or not}} the professor was partially to blame for not making expectations clear. The trial resulted in a zero on the project, several resolutions aimed at personal and community education, and several suggestions for improvements to community resources and programs...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} plagiarism origins, and {{the ethical}} solutions to prevent it. It also reviews some unethical approaches, {{which may be}} used to decrease the plagiarism rate in academic writings. We propose eight ethical techniques to avoid unconscious and <b>accidental</b> <b>plagiarism</b> in manuscripts without using online systems such as Turnitin and/or iThenticate for cross checking and plagiarism detection. The efficiency of the proposed techniques is evaluated on five different texts using students individually. After application of the techniques on the texts, they were checked by Turnitin to produce the plagiarism and similarity report. At the end, the "effective factor" of each method has been compared with each other; and the best result went to a hybrid combination of all techniques to avoid plagiarism. The hybrid of ethical methods decreased the plagiarism rate reported by Turnitin from nearly 100 to the average of 8. 4 on 5 manuscripts...|$|E
40|$|Although {{academic}} dishonesty {{has received}} considerable attention in recent years, {{there is little}} research on how non-serious cheating issues in a discipline such as biology or chemistry can become highly serious offenses {{in the context of}} instruction in the modern languages (MLs). One of these grey areas is (unauthorized) editing by a tutor and/or a native speaker: Given that a substantial part (if not all) of the grade in a ML assignment is language usage (be it grammar, vocabulary, spelling, or organization), any assistance received that improves linguistic form (and as a consequence the student’s grade) should be considered as an act of punishable academic dishonesty. Still, and even if it seems obvious, {{it is not uncommon for}} language instructors to come across assignments that contain advanced linguistic forms or colloquialisms that do not belong to the linguistic repertoire of the student who wrote it (Correa, 2011). In this paper I address the following questions: Is the use of a tutor/native speaker <b>accidental</b> <b>plagiarism</b> (Beasley, 2004), pseudepigraphy (Walker & Townley, 2012), or contract cheating (Clarke & Lancaster, 2006) ? Who is at fault? How can it be prevented or minimized? Should students be allowed to have tutors at all? Is there a double standard when it comes to graduate students and faculty...|$|E
40|$|In this video, Richard Galletly (Academic English {{lecturer}} at Aston University) presents {{a guide to}} avoiding plagiarism in your writing, and introduces some ideas to help with your referencing. This guide is intended for students at UK universities in undergraduate and postgraduate courses. The ideas found here are a synthesis of the current research into plagiarism and how to avoid it, including ideas from East (2009), Ellery (2008) and Hyland (2010). The concept of using summarising and parpaphrasing to avoid <b>accidental</b> <b>plagiarism</b> is questioned here, {{and the use of}} effective reflection, discussion, critical evaluation and commentary on sources is encouraged.

40|$|In {{the face}} of {{increasing}} evidence of plagiarism in higher education the maintenance of educational integrity relies on the capacity of universities to strengthen their systems for consistent detection of and penalties for deliberate plagiarism, cheating and other fraudulent practices.

The focus of this paper is on international students for whom English is an additional language (EAL) and whose plagiarism is most easily recognised, as many set out on their degree courses with no experience in a Western academic environment, an unsteady command of English grammar and a relatively limited range of vocabulary.

40|$|Abstract: Premeditated or accidental? This {{has to be}} the {{question}} every academic asks themselves when faced with a case of suspected plagiarism. Studies show, however, that premeditated plagiarism is rare. Misunderstandings about how to handle information and panics about deadlines are the causes most frequently cited by students. Teaching students about plagiarism is more than teaching them the difference about right and wrong, between collusion and collaboration or between cheating and good academic practice. A really effective anti-plagiarism programme needs to address the main cause of plagiarism by teaching students about information management. Including anti-plagiarism teaching as a key element in a linear information literacy (IL) teaching programme and embedding it within an academic course empowers students to become independent learners. It encourages them to consider the value of information, the quality of resources, the effectiveness of their search and the importance of good citation practice throughout the production of a piece of work. Acquiring the skills to weave secondary research into the student’s own hypothesis has to be designed into the course. Although {{it could be argued that}} the explosion in the amount of information available to students has led to an increase in plagiarism, effective teaching can illustrate how new technologies can be used to help students avoid <b>accidental</b> <b>plagiarism,</b> and to enhance their work. Who then is best placed to deliver IL teaching? The answer is Information professionals. Ask your Librarian! The aim of this paper is to present an overview of how we have achieved fusion of IL and subject teaching on a first year Civil Engineering course at Imperial College London...|$|E

40|$|Alarming numbers {{published}} in academia {{and in the}} media produce the perception that plagiarism is a widespread and urgent problem (e. g., Briggs, 2009). This project explores the potential extent of <b>accidental</b> <b>plagiarism</b> by assessing Canadian distance education students’ knowledge of the concept. Four pieces of evidence are analyzed: (1) students’ attempts to select plagiarised passages {{from a number of}} choices; (2) paraphrases these students produced; (3) results from a simple exercise aiming to improve plagiarism understanding; (4) the types of errors made in identifying and writing paraphrases. Two different groups of university students were asked to recognize plagiarised work in which wording from the original had been changed in various ways. Students from the online Psychology course received feedback on their recognition attempts and then were asked to paraphrase a passage. The prediction is that with feedback and practice, this group should improve over time. A second group of more diverse students was tested to see if the results generalize. For the second group, undergraduate and graduate students were selected from throughout the university rather than from a single course. All four multiple choice scenarios included a proper citation. This study found that almost half of the students in a third-year psychology course did not recognize plagiarised material consistently. The evidence does not support the prediction that student scores would improve over time given feedback and practice, as more students got the first question correct than the fourth question. Furthermore, the majority of these students did not correctly paraphrase a passage they were asked to write in their own words, even after they had received feedback on their recognition quizzes. This suggests more extensive instruction is needed. Undergraduate and graduate students from throughout the university also failed to recognize many plagiarised passages that included word strings, reversals, substitutions, additions, and deletions. The poor ability of students to identify plagiarised passages may imply poor understanding of the concept (Hochstein et al., 2008). Therefore, when these students write their course essays, {{they may not be able}} to recognize their own tendency toward plagiarism and thus engage in it accidentally. Rather than perceiving plagiarism as a type of cheating, it may be more appropriate to identify it, particularly poor paraphrasing, as a weakness in skills. The remedy for committing plagiarism should be sending students to tutorials or other methods of learning to read, write, and reference at the level required for the discipline (Briggs, 2009). References available from author. Earlier research found only about half of 423 university psychology students correctly answered four questions involving recognizing plagiarism, and only a minority was able to rephrase a passage without producing plagiarized content. A more representative study of 125 undergraduates and 103 graduate students reported similar difficulties. The most common mistakes involved the presence of citations and word reversals. Results suggest many cases of plagiarism are inadvertent, so skill development rather than punishment may be appropriate...|$|E
