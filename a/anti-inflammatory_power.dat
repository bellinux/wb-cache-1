40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to make a brief compilation of the physiology of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in order to understandthe role of the exogenous corticoids as therapeutic tools in innumerable pathologies, but when used inappropriately, it can produce important deleterious effects. The history of the corticoids began 164 years ago in 1843 when Thomas Addison described the symptoms of the adrenal gland insufficiency. On September 21 st 1948, almost one hundred years after, Dr. Hench injected cortisone for the first time in a patient with arthritis. In 1950 Hench, Kendall and Reichsteinreceived the Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology. In the cortex of the adrenal glands, three different hormones are synthesized from cholesterol, and these hormones produce diverseeffects on the homeostasis of the body. The synthetic glucocorticoids are classified by their <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>power,</b> half life, and mineralocorticoideffect; they operate in almost every cell through genomic and non genomic mechanismsof action producing different responses. This is the reason of their wide therapeutic effect in respiratory diseases like asthma and COPD,multiple sclerosis, rejection of transplants, among others...|$|E
40|$|A reestenose ainda é o {{principal}} problema da angioplastia coronária, como ficou evidente nas revisões angiográficas dos primeiros procedimentos feitos por Gruntzig. Desde então se procura a solução. Várias drogas administradas por via sistêmica foram testadas, mas com nenhuma se obteve êxito. Aterectomia, angioplastia com raios laser e braquiterapia foram introduzidas com a expectativa de solução, mas o percentual de reestenose pouco foi alterado, e a braquiterapia − que mostrara resultados melhores − veio adicionar outras complicações, entre elas a estenose de bordos (reestenose em “papel de bala”) e trombose aguda. Os stents introduzidos nesse arsenal terapêutico reduziram acentuadamente o processo reestenótico mas não o extinguiram. Recentemente embebidos com as drogas sirolimus e paclitaxel, vem apresentando excelentes resultados quando comparados com as próteses comuns. Stents com essas características representam o mais recente e eficiente avanço na terapêutica da reestenose intra-stent. O objetivo desta pesquisa foi testar uma droga com grande potencial antiinflamatório, portanto com mecanismo de ação diferente, e verificar sua ação bloqueadora na formação da hiperplasia neo-intimal, fator esse responsável pela reestenose intra-stent. Fez-se uma pesquisa duplo-cega randomizada, para a qual se selecionou uma amostra com 133 indivíduos distribuídos em dois grupos, num dos quais 49 indivíduos receberam Stent Biodivysio DD PC Stent impregnado com dexametasona, enquanto 51 receberam o mesmo tipo de stent, porém embebido com soro fisiológico. Antes e depois dos implantes os indivíduos foram examinados com ultra-som intracoronário. Em um período de tempo que variou de 6 a 18 meses, os pacientes foram reestudados com angiografia e ultra-som, para comparação das variáveis ultra-sonográficas de interesse, principalmente o volume de hiperplasia neo-intimal e a percentagem de obstrução do stent nos dois grupos. Os pacientes que receberam stent embebido com dexametasona mostraram grau de hiperplasia neo-intimal menor do que aqueles que receberam stent sem a droga (23, 78 ± 23, 48 mediana 15, 20 versus 35, 12 ± 30, 50 mediana 27, 75) (p= 0, 068); o grau de obstrução intra-stent também foi menor no grupo da dexametasona (15, 91 ± 13, 46 mediana 13, 02 versus 22, 13 ± 14, 62 mediana 19, 64) (p= 0, 024). Contudo esses dados foram maiores do que os que vêm sendo obtidos com o sirolimus e paclitaxel, o que permite concluir que o stent Biodivysio DD PC embebido com dexametasona não diminui a formação de hiperplasia neointimal; diminui a porcentagem de volume de obstrução e não diminuiu a taxa de reestenose intra-stent. Restenosis {{is still}} the main problem concerning coronary angioplasty, as evidenced in the reviews of the first procedures made by Gruntzig. Since that, a solution has been searched. Several drugs systemically administrated were tested {{but none of them}} produced any successful results. Atherectomy, angioplasty using laser beams and brachytherapy were introduced expecting to succeed but the restenosis rates were insignificantly changed. Brachytherapy, which showed better results, added other complications – among them the candy wrapper effect (edge effect) and acute thrombosis. The use of stents in this process as part of therapeutic arsenal reduced significantly the restenosis process but they did not finish it. The use of stents coated in Sirolimus and paclitaxel has been showing excellent results when compared to ordinary prostheses. Stents presenting these characteristics represent the latest and most efficient advance in intra-stent restenosis therapeutics. The aims of this research is testing a drug with great <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>power,</b> therefore with a different action mechanism, and verify its blocking action in neo-intimal hyperplasia formation, which is responsible for intra-stent restenosis. A double-blinded randomized research was conducted. A sample of 133 individuals was divided into two groups. One of these groups containing 49 patients received Biodivysio DD PC Stents coated in dexamethasone whereas the other 51 patients received the stents coated in physiological saline solution. The patients were examined before and after the interventions with the use of intra-coronary ultrasound. After a period varying between 6 to 18 months, the same patients were reexamined through angiography and ultrasound to compare ultrasonographic variables, especially neo-intimal hyperplasia and the rate of stent blocking in both groups. The patients who received stents coated in dexamethasone presented a lower level of neo-intimal hyperplasia compared to those who received the stents only coated in physiological saline solution (23. 78 ± 23. 48 median 15. 20 versus 35. 12 ± 30. 50 median 27. 75 from the control group) (p= 0. 068); the level of intra-stent blocking was also lower than the dexamethasone group (15. 91 ± 13. 46 median 13. 02 versus 22. 13 ± 14. 62 median 19. 64 from the control group) (p= 0. 024). However these figures were bigger than those collected from Sirolimus and paclitaxel coated stents, which permits us to draw a conclusion that Biodivysio DD PC stents coated in dexamethasone do not lower the formation of neo-intimal hyperplasia; it lowers the rate in blocking volume and do not lower intra-stent restenosis rate...|$|E

40|$|Silymarin is the extract of Silybum marianum, or milk thistle, and {{its major}} active {{compound}} is silybin, {{which has a}} remarkable biological effect. It is used in different liver disorders, particularly chronic liver diseases, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, because of its antioxidant, <b>anti-inflammatory</b> and antifibrotic <b>power.</b> Indeed, the anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effect of silymarin is oriented towards the reduction of virus-related liver damages through inflammatory cascade softening and immune system modulation. It also has a direct antiviral effect associated with its intravenous administration in hepatitis C virus infection. With respect to alcohol abuse, silymarin is able to increase cellular vitality and to reduce both lipid peroxidation and cellular necrosis. Furthermore, silymarin/silybin use has important biological effects in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. These substances antagonize the progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, by intervening in various therapeutic targets: oxidative stress, insulin resistance, liver fat accumulation and mitochondrial dysfunction. Silymarin is also used in liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma that represent common end stages of different hepatopathies by modulating different molecular patterns. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} review is to examine scientific studies concerning the effects derived from silymarin/silybin use in chronic liver diseases, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma...|$|R
40|$|Background Diabetes causes {{cognitive}} impairment. Medicinal plants due {{to different}} mechanisms, such as antioxidant activities may improve diabetes and relieve its symptoms. Commiphora mukul (Burseraceae) {{has a significant}} antioxidant activity. Objectives This study aimed to {{examine the effect of}} hydro- alcoholic extract of C. mukul on passive-avoidance learning and memory in streptozotocin (STZ) induced diabetic male rats. Materials and Methods Thirty-two adult male Wistar rats were randomly allocated to four groups: normal, diabetic, normal + extract of C. mukul and diabetic + extract of C. mukul groups with free access to regular rat diet. Diabetes was induced in male rats by single interaperitoneal injection of 60 mg/kg STZ. After the confirmation of diabetes, 300 mg/kg C. mukul extract was orally administered to the extract-treated groups. Control groups received normal saline at the same time. Passive-avoidance memory was tested eight weeks after the STZ treatment, and blood glucose and body weight were measured in all groups {{at the beginning and end}} of the experiment. Results In the present study, diabetes decreased learning and memory. Although the administration of C. mukul extract did not affect the step-through latency (STLa) and the number of trials of the diabetic groups during the first acquisition trial, a significant decrease was observed in STLr and also a significant increase in time spent in the dark compartment (TDC) and number of crossing (NOC) in the retention test (after 24 and 48 hours). Although no significant difference was observed in body weight of diabetic + extract of C. mukul (DE) and diabetic control (DC) groups, the plasma glucose of DE group was significantly lower in comparison to DC group. Conclusions Commiphora mukul extract can improve passive-avoidance learning and memory impairments in the STZ-induced diabetic rats. This improvement may be due to the antioxidant, acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity, <b>anti-inflammatory</b> or <b>power</b> to reduce hyperglycemia and lowering cholesterol and triglyceride properties of this extract. The result of this study is a promising point for new therapeutic alternatives in alleviating cognitive impairments caused by diabetes...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{attempted}} to identify the possible antinociceptive actions of n-butanolic phase, chloroformic phase, ethyl acetate phase and crude methanolic extract obtained from Caulerpa racemosa. This seaweed is cosmopolitan in world, mainly in tropical regions. The n-butanolic, chloroformic, ethyl acetate phases and crude methanolic extract, all administered orally in the concentration of 100 mg/kg, reduced the nociception produced by acetic acid by 47. 39 %, 70. 51 %, 76. 11 % and 72. 24 %, respectively. In the hotplate test the chloroformic and ethyl acetate phase were activite in this models. In the neurogenic phase on formalin test, were observed that crude methanolic extract (51. 77 %), n-butanolic phase (35. 12 %), chloroformic phase (32. 70 %) and indomethacin (32. 06 %) were effective in inhibit the nociceptive response. In the inflammatory phase, only the ethyl acetate phase (75. 43 %) and indomethacin (47. 83 %) inhibited significantly the nociceptive response. Based on these data, we can infer that the ethyl acetate phase shows a significant <b>anti-inflammatory</b> profile, whose <b>power</b> {{has not yet been}} determined.

Neste estudo, tentamos identificar a atividade antinociceptiva do extrato metanólico bruto e das fases n-butanólica, clorofórmica e acetato de etila provenientes da alga Caulerpa racemosa. Esta alga é cosmopolita no mundo, principalmente em regiões tropicais. O extrato metanólico bruto e as fases n-butanólica, clorofórmica e acetato de etila foram administrados por via oral, na concentração de 100 mg/kg. Estes foram capazes de reduzir a nocicepção produzida pelo ácido acético, sendo 47, 39 %, 70, 51 %, 76, 11 % e 72, 24 %, respectivamente. No ensaio da placa quente as fases clorofórmica e acetato de etila foram ativas neste modelo. Na fase neurogênica do teste de formalina, foi observado que o extrato metanólico bruto (51, 77 %), fase n-butanólica (35, 12 %), fase clorofórmica (32, 70 %) e indometacina (32, 06 %) foram eficazes em inibir a resposta nociceptiva. Na fase inflamatória, apenas a fase acetato de etila (75, 43 %) e indometacina (47, 83 %) foram capazes de inibir significativamente a resposta nociceptiva. Com base nestes dados, podemos sugerir que o a fase acetato de etila apresenta um significativo efeito anti-inflamatório, cuja potência ainda não foi determinada. No entanto, estudos farmacológicos e químicos serão necessários, a fim de caracterizar o mecanismo responsável pela ação antinociceptiva e também para identificar outros princípios ativos presentes na alga Caulerpa racemosa...|$|R
