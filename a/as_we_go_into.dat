2500|$|Three weeks later, on 30 April 1864, {{the measure}} of devotion to the Hauhau {{movement}} displayed itself in the reckless march by 200 warriors on the Sentry Hill redoubt, 9km north-east of New Plymouth, in a one-sided battle that cost the lives of possibly {{a fifth of the}} Māori force. The redoubt had been built in late 1863 by Captain W. B. Messenger and 120 men of the Military Settlers on the crown of a hill that was the site of an ancient pā, and garrisoned by a detachment of 75 men from the 57th Regiment under Captain Shortt, with two Coehorn mortars. The construction of the outpost was regarded by the Atiawa as a challenge, being built close to the Māori position at Manutahi and on their land. In April 1864 a war party was formed of the best fighting men from the west coast iwi that had joined the rapidly spreading Hauhau movement.

40|$|Draft – {{please do}} not quote without {{permission}} from the authors; comments are most welcome The question which industry structure is most conducive to innovation has drawn much attention from both scholars as well as policy makers. Schumpeter {{was one of the}} first to draw attention to this question, and has famously provided two answers. His first answer was that an industry where small firms thrive will see more innovation. “New combinations are, as a rule, embodied, as it were, in new firms which generally do not arise out of the old ones but start producing beside them; in general it is not the owner of stage-coaches who build new railways. ” (Schumpeter 1934, p.)

40|$|Molecular motors {{are known}} to have the high {{efficiency}} of energy transformation in the presence of thermal fluctuation. Motivated by the surprising fact, recent studies of thermal ratchet models are showing how and when work should be extracted from non-equilibrium fluctuations. One of the important finding was brought by Magnasco where he studied the temperature dependence on the fluctuation-induced current in a ratchet (multistable) system and showed that the current can generically be maximized in a finite temperature. The interesting finding has been interpreted that thermal fluctuation is not harmful for the fluctuation-induced work and even facilitates its efficiency. We show, however, this interpretation turns out to be incorrect as soon <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> the realm of the energetics [Sekimoto,J. Phys. Soc.

The maximum efficiency is realized in the absence of thermal fluctuation. The result presents an open problem whether thermal fluctuation could facilitate the efficiency of energetic transformation from force-fluctuation into work. Comment: 3 pages, 4 sets of figure...|$|E
40|$|The {{turbine rotor}} {{of a gas}} turbine engine is {{subjected}} to temperature variations in {{short periods of time}} due to the start and stop cycles of the engine. This causes sudden changes in the temperature with transient thermal stresses being induced into the turbine rotor. The transient effects are due to tile changes in the material properties like- Density, Specific heat and Youngs Modulus. The estimate OF the thermal stresses induced in the tut-bine rotor due to change in temperature is important in determining the type of an aeroengine [...] In this study an effort has been made to estimate the effects of the transient thermal in the turbine rotor using Finite Element Analysis. A typical turbine rotor {{in the form of a}} Bladed Disk called blisk is considered for transient thermal analysis using the Numerically integrated structural Analysis (NISA) package. The blisk material is considered as MAR M 247 and the properties of the material are updated to the model. The appropriate boundary conditions depicting the actual environment in which the turbine rotor works in an aeroengine are also updated. The results show that the maximum temperature occurs at the tip of the blade and decreases <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> the disk. The Transient Thermal Analysis was successfully completed and the results obtained. The thermal stresses due to large temperature gradients are higher than the steady state stresses.

50|$|Coloration in {{invertebrates}} varies {{based on}} the depth, water temperature, food source, currents, geographic location, light exposure, and sedimentation. For example, the amount of carotenoid a certain sea anemone decreases <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> deeper <b>into</b> the ocean. Thus, the marine life that resides on deeper waters is less brilliant than the organisms that live in well-lit areas due to the reduction of pigments. In the colonies of the colonial ascidian-cyanophyte symbiosis Trididemnum solidum, their colors are different depending on the light regime in which they live. The colonies that are exposed to full sunlight are heavily calcified, thicker, and are white. In contrast the colonies that live in shaded areas have more phycoerythrin (pigment that absorbs green) in comparison to phycocyanin (pigment that absorbs red), thinner, and are purple. The purple color in the shaded colonies are mainly due to the phycobilin pigment of the algae, meaning the variation of exposure in light changes the colors of these colonies.|$|R
