25|$|The Garratt <b>articulated</b> <b>locomotive</b> was {{developed}} by Herbert William Garratt, a British locomotive engineer who, after a career with British colonial railways, was the New South Wales Railways' Inspecting Engineer in London. Garratt first approached Kitson & Co, but his idea was rejected, perhaps because that company were already committed to the Kitson-Meyer. He then approached Beyer, Peacock and Company, who were only marginally more interested.|$|E

25|$|A duplex {{locomotive}} is a {{steam locomotive}} that divides {{the driving force}} on its wheels by using two pairs of cylinders rigidly mounted to a single locomotive frame; {{it is not an}} <b>articulated</b> <b>locomotive.</b> The concept was first used in France in 1863, but was particularly developed in the early 1930s by the Baldwin Locomotive Works, the largest commercial builder of steam locomotives in North America, under the supervision of its then chief engineer, Ralph P. Johnson.|$|E
25|$|Garratts {{enjoy an}} {{advantage}} over the Mallet system, because of the geometry of the design. When swinging around curves the boiler and cab unit move inward like a bowstring in the bow of a curve and this reduces the centrifugal force that would overturn a normal locomotive and which in turn permits faster running. The Mallet's forward articulated unit tends to throw out as the loco rounds curves. While most Garratts were designed for freight or mixed traffic, there were several passenger Garratt classes. A Garratt holds the world speed record for an <b>articulated</b> <b>locomotive.</b>|$|E
25|$|Upon introduction, the two steeple-cab {{locomotives}} {{proved the}} superiority of electric traction. They were able to operate together with multiple-unit train control, allowing a single crew to control both as an <b>articulated</b> <b>locomotive</b> with greater tractive effort than the Victorian Railways C class heavy goods locomotive, the most powerful locomotive on the VR at the time. Based on their success, suburban goods sidings were rapidly electrified and most suburban goods traffic utilised electric traction. With the electrification of the Gippsland line as far as Traralgon in the 1950s, {{the range of the}} E class locomotives was similarly extended and they could be found shunting or hauling services along the line.|$|E

2500|$|L14A/B - Two of {{the flat}} fronted 1935 stock {{prototype}} cars were rebuilt to create this locomotive. The donor cars, numbers 10011 and 11011, had been displaced from the Epping - Ongar shuttle in 1966. They were transferred to Acton Works for articulation experiments, thought being given {{at the time to}} the articulation of trains on the Northern line. The trailing ends of the two motor cars were cut back so there was only one window behind the rear double doors, and both were mounted on a single steel bogie. The outer bogies were replaced with new lightweight ones, constructed of aluminium, and the unit was ready for testing to begin in August 1970. After a year of trials, engineers had collected sufficient data, and as it was never intended for the vehicle to enter passenger service, it was transferred to Acton Works as a shunting locomotive, where it was particularly useful, as the shoes spanned [...] The experimental lightweight aluminium motor bogies were removed in 1975, and fitted to 1972 MkII car No3363, so that long-term testing of the design could be carried out. This ended the life of LT's only <b>articulated</b> <b>locomotive,</b> which was scrapped at Acton later that year.|$|E

50|$|<b>Articulated</b> <b>locomotives</b> were handled {{through two}} {{different}} methods. On many railroads each wheel arrangement was assigned {{its own unique}} letter, due to {{the limited number of}} arrangements that had to be represented. On other railroads this was insufficient, and commonly <b>articulated</b> <b>locomotives</b> were represented with a two letter code, one letter for the arrangement of each half. Therefore, the Pennsylvania Railroad GG1 (UIC 2Co+Co2) is represented as if it were two ten-wheelers (4-6-0) coupled tail-to-tail.|$|R

50|$|An <b>articulated</b> <b>locomotive</b> with no fixed wheels (i.e. {{excluding}} the Mallet locomotive but including other articulated steam locomotives, {{as well as}} most diesel and electric locomotives) may have a separate frame beneath the superstructure, or the bodywork's internal structure may be load-bearing.
