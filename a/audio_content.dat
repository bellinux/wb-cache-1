5|$|Mini Metro was {{developed}} by Dinosaur Polo Club, a two-man independent video game development studio based in New Zealand. It is the first game from the studio, {{which was founded in}} 2013 by brothers Peter and Robert Curry. They had previously worked at video game developer Sidhe, but left in 2006 to pursue a career in developing indie games. Following a series of abandoned projects, Peter Curry recognised {{that he would have to}} restrict the scope of his projects in order to complete them, and with hopes of releasing a finished product, the brothers set a number of constraints while proposing ideas for a prototype game. Minimising the amount of production art was a necessary restriction, as they had little experience in creating art assets. Likewise, they did not want the game's concept to rely on <b>audio</b> <b>content,</b> due to lack of skills in producing music. They also did not want to hand-build each level in the game. Imposing these constraints meant that they could discard most of their potential game ideas immediately, and led to them concentrating on concepts that involved procedurally generated levels and abstract visual styles.|$|E

50|$|Among the {{available}} data for describing music, there are textual representations, such as liner notes, reviews and criticisms that describe the <b>audio</b> <b>contents</b> in words. In other cases human reactions such as emotional judgements or psycho-physiological measurements might provide an insight into the contents and structure of audio. Computer Audition tries to find relation between these different representations {{in order to provide}} this additional understanding of the <b>audio</b> <b>contents.</b>|$|R

25|$|Three {{signals from}} three {{different}} sources (satellite, satellite, and terrestrial) are therefore combined in the receiver as radio signals, (not as audio signals). The three signals need to be combined constructively (avoiding situations where bad signals pollute good signals) in the receiver before being decoded. Heavy error correction {{is applied to the}} signals. All three signals contain the same <b>audio</b> <b>content</b> on all the channels that the receiver can receive, {{with the exception of one}} audio program waveform being transmitted ahead of the other two by approximately four seconds. With this time skew, the signals, once realigned, need to see an 8-second obstruction of overpass fade in order to lose <b>audio</b> <b>content.</b> This increases the robustness of the signal delivery in most driving conditions.|$|E

A novel approach is presented in this paper, based on the standardized variogram. This tool, inherited from Geostatistics, is applied to MFCCs matrices to reduce their size and compute compact representations of the <b>audio</b> <b>contents</b> (song signatures), aimed to evaluate audio similarity. The performance of the proposed approach is analyzed in comparison with other alternative methods and on the base of human responses. 1...|$|R

25|$|The XM {{radio signal}} was {{broadcast}} on 6 separate radio carriers within the 12.5MHz allocation. The entire {{content of the}} radio service, including both data and <b>audio</b> <b>content,</b> was represented by only two carriers. The other 4 carriers carried duplicates of the same content to achieve redundancy through signal diversity. The data on each carrier is encoded using time-delayed and error-correction schemes to enhance availability. Effectively the total radio spectrum used for content is a little over 4MHz.|$|E
50|$|Since {{audio signals}} usually {{comprise}} multiple sound sources, then unlike speech signals {{that can be}} efficiently {{described in terms of}} specific models (such as source-filter model), it is hard to devise a parametric representation for general audio. Parametric audio representations usually use filter banks or sinusoidal models to capture multiple sound parameters, sometimes increasing the representation size in order to capture internal structure in the signal. Additional types of data that are relevant for computer audition are textual descriptions of <b>audio</b> <b>contents,</b> such as annotations, reviews, and visual information in the case of audio-visual recordings.|$|R

Aside from metadata pertaining to the <b>audio</b> <b>content,</b> tags may also be used for DRM. ReplayGain is a standard for measuring and storing the loudness of an MP3 file (audio normalization) in its metadata tag, enabling a ReplayGain-compliant player to automatically adjust the overall playback volume for each file. MP3Gain may be used to reversibly modify files based on ReplayGain measurements so that adjusted playback can be achieved on players without ReplayGain capability.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} recover {{meaningful}} signal and error free audio from a signal impaired by interference and fading, the receiver uses concatenated Reed-Solomon block coding and Forward Error Correction encoding and decoding (codec). This technique was proven {{in the early}} days of satellite modems in the late 1970s. Linkabit, then run by Irwin Jacobs prior to his involvement with Qualcomm, offered such a codec for rack mounting in satellite earth stations. The Sirius signal uses more robust error correction on control channels than on the <b>audio</b> <b>content,</b> trading off error correction and bandwidth differently for separate categories of bits in the signal waveform.|$|E

25|$|The {{shielding}} material used – wire gauze, fabric or foam – {{is designed}} {{to have a significant}} acoustic impedance. The relatively low particle-velocity air pressure changes that constitute sound waves can pass through with minimal attenuation, but higher particle-velocity wind is impeded to a far greater extent. Increasing the thickness of the material improves wind attenuation but also begins to compromise high frequency <b>audio</b> <b>content.</b> This limits the practical size of simple foam screens. While foams and wire meshes can be partly or wholly self-supporting, soft fabrics and gauzes require stretching on frames, or laminating with coarser structural elements.|$|E
25|$|The {{terrestrial}} carrier is an OFDM QPSK signal, {{cousin to}} WiMax and LTE, with {{the particular feature}} {{that more than one}} transmitter operates on the same frequency, forming a single frequency network. A number of transmitters can be placed around a city to create coverage that is less subject to fading than if a single transmitter were used. The satellite signal is QPSK. Both satellite and terrestrial signals have hierarchical modulation superposed on the original signal, a measure created to add bandwidth at a small expense in the satellite link budget for decoding the core <b>audio</b> <b>content.</b>|$|E
