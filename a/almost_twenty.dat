5|$|Although he {{had been}} {{painting}} for <b>almost</b> <b>twenty</b> years, Bacon steadfastly insisted that Three Studies was the fons et origo of his career.

The early publications of John Russell and David Sylvester open with the 1944 triptych, and Bacon insisted to his death that no retrospective should feature paintings pre-dating 1944.|$|E

He sought to bolster his regime and support his religious policies by military success against the Abbasid Caliphate, the Empire's major antagonist.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 18th century the Luttrells and Dunster Castle faced many {{financial}} challenges. Francis's son Alexander, inherited the castle when he came of age in 1704, but it was still mostly empty and carried large debts with it. Alexander died young in 1711 and his widow, Dorothy, spent <b>almost</b> <b>twenty</b> years paying off the debts. Dorothy built a new chapel, designed by Sir James Thornhill in white Portland stone, on the rear of the mansion at a cost of £1,300 (£178,000 at 2009 prices); few records of this remain, but the interior probably resembled that of the chapel at Wimpole Hall. A safer, if less grand, approach road to the castle was created, called the New Way, and the remains of the Upper Ward on top of the motte were flattened {{to be used as a}} bowling green, complete with an octagonal summer house. Dorothy's son, Alexander Luttrell, took over the castle in 1726 but ran up new debts, and the castle was handed over into the control of a receiver.|$|E
