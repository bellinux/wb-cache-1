5|$|More {{problematic}} {{are those}} {{cases where the}} movement of the Sun at different times and seasons causes light and shadow interactions with petroglyphs. A widely known example is the Sun Dagger of Fajada Butte at which <b>a</b> <b>glint</b> of sunlight passes over a spiral petroglyph. The location of a dagger of light on the petroglyph varies throughout the year. At the summer solstice a dagger can be seen through the heart of the spiral; at the winter solstice two daggers appear to either side of it. It is proposed that this petroglyph was created to mark these events. Recent studies have identified many similar sites in the US Southwest and Northwestern Mexico. It has been argued that the number of solstitial markers at these sites provides statistical evidence that they were intended to mark the solstices. The Sun Dagger site on Fajada Butte in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico, stands out for its explicit light markings that record all the key events of both the solar and lunar cycles: summer solstice, winter solstice, equinox, and the major and minor lunar standstills of the moon’s 18.6 year cycle. In addition at two other sites on Fajada Butte, there are five light markings on petroglyphs recording the summer and winter solstices, equinox and solar noon. Numerous buildings and interbuilding alignments of the great houses of Chaco Canyon and outlying areas are oriented to the same solar and lunar directions that are marked at the Sun Dagger site.|$|E
25|$|On 20 June 1946, while {{searching for}} another {{aircraft}} {{that had been}} reported as missing between Rockcliffe and Roberval, Quebec, the crew of a military search aircraft, piloted by Lt. B.D. Inrig, noticed <b>a</b> <b>glint</b> of sunshine coming from a metallic object and on closer investigation saw the characteristic twin fins of a Liberator {{near the top of}} the mountain. All records pointed to it being the lost aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Pike {{make use}} of the lateral line system to follow the {{vortices}} produced by the perceived prey, and the whirling movement of the spinner is probably a good way to imitate or exaggerate these. Jerkbaits are also effective and can produce spectacular bites with pike attacking these erratic-moving lures at full speed. For trolling, big plugs or softbaits can be used. Spoons with mirror finishes are very effective when the sun is at a sharp angle to the water in the mornings or evenings because they generate the vibrations previously discussed and cause <b>a</b> <b>glint</b> of reflective sunlight that mimics the flash of white-bellied prey. Most fishermen tend to use small lures, but often that is not advisable because pike have a preference for large prey. When fishing in shallow water for smaller pike, lighter and smaller lures are frequently used. The humble 'woolly bugger' fly is a favourite lure among keen fly fisherman of the southern hemisphere.|$|E

500|$|The {{opening scene}} {{features}} a family observing Shabbat. Spielberg said that [...] "to start the film with the candles being lit... {{would be a}} rich bookend, to start the film with a normal Shabbat service before the juggernaut against the Jews begins." [...] When the color fades out in the film's opening moments, it gives way to {{a world in which}} smoke comes to symbolize bodies being burnt at Auschwitz. Only at the end, when Schindler allows his workers to hold Shabbat services, do the images of candle fire regain their warmth. For Spielberg, they represent [...] "just <b>a</b> <b>glint</b> of color, and a glimmer of hope." [...] Sara Horowitz, director of the Koschitzky Centre for Jewish Studies at York University, sees the candles as a symbol for the Jews of Europe, killed and then burned in the crematoria. The two scenes bracket the Nazi era, marking its beginning and end. She points out that normally the woman of the house lights the Sabbath candles. In the film it is men who perform this ritual, demonstrating not only the subservient role of women, but also the subservient position of Jewish men in relation to Aryan men, especially Göth and Schindler.|$|E
500|$|Chris Cottingham of NME {{gave the}} album {{six out of}} ten, saying that [...] "Tinie is most {{definitely}} a star, second only to Dizzee Rascal on the UK scene, perhaps even above him following Dizzee's dismal ‘The Fifth’ album. So perhaps it's no surprise Tinie's brimming with confidence on record number two." [...] However, Cottingham dismissed the quality of some lyrics as [...] "all great fun for him, no doubt, {{but in the past}} he didn’t trade in this lowest common denominator stuff." [...] Robert Copsey of Digital Spy gave the album three out of five stars, describing the album as [...] "inoffensive grime-pop for the masses that makes all the right moves, but lacks any serious bite." [...] Larry Day of musicOMH gave the album two and half out of five stars, commenting [...] "this is a massive collaborative project. That's probably the reason it's such a chaotic, unwieldy mess." [...] On the other hand, he praised the promotional single [...] "Don't Sell Out", saying [...] "crunchy handclaps and jerky hooks work a kiss of life on the record, and Tempah's lyrics are fascinating to listen to – he compares himself to Othello and nods to everything from the Queen to Celebrity Juice – if utterly misogynistic." [...] Day concluded the review with [...] "Tempah has gone from rapping with a knowing wink or <b>a</b> <b>glint</b> in his eye to unloading a lewd spiel sans wit." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{a review}} of Shane Harris' book The Watchers: The Rise of America's Surveillance State, New York Times {{reporter}} Eric Lichtblau described The Puzzle Palace as [...] "the benchmark study of the N.S.A.

Michael Duffy, reviewing Bamford's 2004 book Pretext for War, wrote in Time magazine that The Puzzle Palace [...] "is still considered the classic account of the mysterious National Security Agency." ...|$|E

2500|$|Billington {{directed}} {{the growth of}} the Library of Congress' digital outreach and analog collections during the period 1992 through 2014 when the Library also experienced a 30 percent decrease in its staff largely due to legislative appropriations cutbacks. Every three years, the Librarian reviews the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). In 2010, Billington's decision to open new DCMA loopholes resulted in his being described as [...] "the most important person you never heard of, having headed the library since well before the Web was spun or the DMCA was even <b>a</b> <b>glint</b> in the Recording Industry Association of America's eye [...] [...] [...] It was probably Billington's unassailable reputation for integrity and probity that won the LOC this power under the DMCA.|$|E
2500|$|Mel's exit storyline {{was linked}} to Steve's death, and Outhwaite claimed that viewers would be gripped by the storyline right up until her own exit {{a few months after}} Steve's. She commented, [...] "Mel is devastated by Steve's death. She thinks that Phil caused it and rushes into the Vic and goes for him. Mel acts brave, but inside she is breaking. She is given a {{necklace}} of black pearls on the day Steve dies and it breaks her heart. She knows Phil was involved in the death but can't prove it. He has been nothing but trouble for her and she won't try to build bridges now [...] Mel looks brave on the outside but inside she's cracking up." [...] In the on-screen events, Mel's anger turns to devastation when Phil informs her that Steve had been having sex with his sister Sam Mitchell. After being arrested over Steve's money laundering and discovering she was pregnant with Steve's baby, Mel confronted everyone who had wronged her before leaving Walford. At the time, Outhwaite stated that her final scenes were the hardest that she'd ever filmed. Tony Stewart, critic for The Mirror suggested that Mel's exit in April 2002 was thrilling and described it as [...] "a devastating story of betrayal and her ultimate revenge [...] one by one her friends desert her." [...] Stewart praised Mel's final scene with the following description: [...] "When she faces her last exit at Victoria Coach Station, there is <b>a</b> <b>glint</b> in her eye as Mel looks at the destination board and speaks on her mobile. 'Pick a number for me,' she says. 'One to 20. Great. Thank you.' And with that she is gone... but never forgotten." ...|$|E
