2500|$|Agriculture, as {{implemented}} {{through the}} method of farming, imposes external costs upon society through pesticides, nutrient runoff, excessive water usage, loss of natural environment and assorted other problems. A 2000 assessment of agriculture in the UK determined total external costs for 1996 of £2,343 million, or £208 per hectare. A 2005 analysis of these costs in the USA concluded that cropland imposes approximately $5 to 16 billion ($30 to $96 per hectare), while livestock production imposes $714 million. Both studies, which focused solely on the fiscal impacts, concluded that more {{should be done to}} internalize external costs. Neither included subsidies in their analysis, but they noted that subsidies also influence the cost of agriculture to society. In 2010, the International Resource Panel of the United Nations Environment Programme published a report assessing the environmental impacts of consumption and production. The study found that agriculture and food consumption are two of the most important drivers of environmental pressures, particularly habitat change, climate change, water use and toxic emissions. The 2011 UNEP Green Economy report states that [...] "gricultural operations, excluding land use changes, produce approximately 13 per cent of anthropogenic global GHG emissions. This includes GHGs emitted by the use of inorganic fertilisers <b>agro-chemical</b> pesticides and herbicides; (GHG emissions resulting from production of these inputs are included in industrial emissions); and fossil fuel-energy inputs. [...] "On average we find that the total amount of fresh residues from agricultural and forestry production for second- generation biofuel production amounts to 3.8 billion tonnes per year between 2011 and 2050 (with an average annual growth rate of 11 per cent throughout the period analysed, accounting for higher growth during early years, 48 per cent for 2011–2020 and an average 2 per cent annual expansion after 2020)." ...|$|E

40|$|This {{reports on}} a study on {{handling}} and use of <b>agro-chemicals</b> in Magu District, Mwanza Region, Tanzania. It {{has been found that}} there is misuse and improper handling of the chemicals. Farmers lack enough knowledge of the dangers associated with improper handling and use of <b>agro-chemicals.</b> Sixty percent of the interviewed farmers apply manure in their fields but not at the recommended rates due to either ignorance or lack of transport facilities. Farmers also apply <b>agro-chemicals</b> in horticultural farms at rates that are, in most cases, higher than those recommended. The recommended safety intervals between applications of pesticides and crop harvesting are not observed and farmers do not use protective gears during handling and use of pesticides. Empty pesticide containers are either kept for domestic uses or are disposed of haphazardly. The reasons for this misuse and improper handling are lack of knowledge by farmers, poverty, and inadequate extension services. It is recommended that appropriate measures to ensure safe handling and use of <b>agro-chemicals</b> must be taken to avoid adverse effects on the environment and public health. Training of farmers, extension staff and input stockists should be enhanced to foster proper handling and use of <b>agro-chemicals</b> thus reduce/eradicate the rate of misuse incidents...|$|R

Ninety five (95) respondents were selected using multi-stage, purposive and random sampling techniques. The data collected were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The result shows {{the distribution of respondents}} according to their age, 12. 63 % are less than 20 years, 13. 68 % are within the age of 21 to 30 years, 14. 738 % 31 to 40, years, 16. 84 % 41 to 50 years, 21. 05 % ranging between 51 - 60 years while 21. 0 % of them are 60 year and above. It shows {{that the majority of the}} farmers fall within the age of 51 to 60 years. The gender distribution of the farmers shows that 68. 42 % of the respondents were male while 31. 78 % are female. 48. 4 % of the respondents have 6 - 10 members of family in a household. Based on educational level of the respondents, majority of the respondents (36. 84 %) had Tertiary education while 31. 58 % had secondary school education. Majority of the respondents (35. 8 %) had farming experience of over 30 years. According to the distribution of farm size, majority of the respondent (52. 6 %) had less than 1 hectare (< 1 ha), 27. 4 % had between 1 and 5 hectares and 20. 0 % between 6 and 10 hectares.

40|$|The {{sustainability}} of conventional agriculture in Bangladesh is under {{threat from the}} continuous degradation of land and water resources, and from declining yields due to indiscriminate use of <b>agro-chemicals.</b> Government is pursuing efforts to promote sustainable agriculture with emphasis on better use of on-farm resources and the reduction of external inputs. This paper presents four dimensions of agricultural sustainability as productivity, environmental stability, economical profitability, and social and economic equity. Six characters were selected to evaluate sustainability. Significant {{differences were found between}} the two systems (conventional and sustainable agriculture) in crop diversification, soil fertility management, pests and diseases management, use of <b>agro-chemicals</b> and environmental issues. However, no significant variations were found in other indicators such as land-use pattern, crop yield and stability, risk and uncertainties, and food security. Although crop yield and financial return were found to be slightly higher in the conventional system, the economic return and value addition per unit of land did not show any difference. It can be suggested that sustainable agriculture has a tendency towards becoming environmental, economically and socially more sound than conventional agriculture, as it requires considerably less <b>agro-chemicals,</b> adds more organic matter to the soil, provides balanced food, and requires higher local inputs without markedly compromising output and financial benefits. Broad-policy measures, including the creation of mass awareness of adverse health effects of agrochemical-based products, are outlined for the promotion of sustainable agriculture...|$|R
