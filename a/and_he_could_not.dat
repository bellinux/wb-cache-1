5|$|Beginning around 1890, Rimsky-Korsakov {{suffered}} from angina. While this ailment initially wore him down gradually, the stresses concurrent with the 1905 Revolution {{and its aftermath}} greatly accelerated its progress. After December 1907, his illness became severe, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> work. In 1908 he died at his Lubensk estate near Luga (modern day Plyussky District of Pskov Oblast), and was interred in Tikhvin Cemetery at the Alexander Nevsky Monastery in Saint Petersburg, next to Borodin, Glinka, Mussorgsky and Stasov.|$|E
5|$|Following his January 1860 {{resignation}} from Parliament, Ollivier spearheaded a requisition, broadly {{supported by}} influential people, to have Brittan make himself {{available for the}} resulting by-election in the Christchurch Country electorate. Brittan declined the requisition, mostly because he was opposed to the rail tunnel scheme which had overwhelming support by the population, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> see himself being their representative if he disagreed with this popular public opinion. Isaac Thomas Cookson, who had earlier supported the Brittan requisition, was elected.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi's London {{lifestyle}} {{incorporated the}} values {{he has grown}} up with. When he returned to India in 1891, his outlook was parochial <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> make {{a living as a}} lawyer. This challenged his belief that practicality and morality necessarily coincided. By moving in 1893 to South Africa he found a solution to this problem and developed the central concepts of his mature philosophy.|$|E
60|$|Kit {{coloured}} and got up. After all, <b>he</b> {{was human}} <b>and</b> knew <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> hold out long. <b>He</b> thrilled <b>and</b> his hands shook {{as he turned}} his soft hat. Mrs. Austin trusted him, <b>and</b> since <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> see another plan, he must run away.|$|R

5|$|He {{assumed the}} worst in people and he brought out {{the worst in}} them... He clung {{to the idea of}} being 'tough'. He thought that was what had brought him to the edge of greatness. But that was what betrayed him. He could not open himself to other men <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> open himself to greatness.|$|E
5|$|He {{began to}} feel pain in his lower back shortly {{after the end of}} his junior season. In May 2011, while {{attending}} a basketball camp at the Deron Williams Academy in Chicago, Arcidiacono complained of poor mobility and soreness. He was diagnosed with a herniated disk in his back, forcing him to miss his senior season. Arcidiacono had surgery to repair the disk on December 21, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> leave his house for two weeks thereafter. Arcidiacono finished his career at Neshaminy High School as the program's all-time leading scorer. He tallied 1,498 points, 449 rebounds, 378 assists, 178 steals, and 160 three-pointers. Despite missing the season, ESPNU ranked him among the top 50 seniors in the country.|$|E
5|$|After much persuasion, he overcame {{his fear}} and {{eventually}} made three trips to Singapore to restore his murals in December 1963, July 1982 and May 1988. The 1982 restoration was more intensive and the invaluable assistance given to Warren by {{the officers and}} boys of the SAF Boys' School enabled {{the bulk of the}} work to be completed. Of the original five murals, only one was not fully restored; the mural of St Luke in Prison. Stanley's original tracing of the drawing was missing, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> remember the details of the missing portion. In 1985, Stanley's original drawing was discovered in the memorabilia of Wally Hammond who had been a fellow prisoner with Stanley. These original sketches were subsequently donated to the National Archives of Singapore. From the original, Stanley painted a small picture, which was placed below the remaining piece of the mural in 1988. He was, by then, not fit enough to restore the actual mural.|$|E

5|$|Based on {{a decree}} by Emperor Francis II inflicting punishments on German {{subjects}} who {{collaborated with the}} French revolutionary government, Forster was declared an outlaw and placed under the Imperial ban; a prize of 100 ducats was set on his head <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> return to Germany. Devoid of all means {{of making a living}} and without his wife, who had stayed in Mainz with their children and her later husband Ludwig Ferdinand Huber, he remained in Paris. At this point the revolution in Paris had entered the Reign of Terror introduced by the Committee of Public Safety under the rule of Maximilien Robespierre. Forster had the opportunity to experience the difference between the promises of the revolution of happiness for all and its cruel practice. In contrast to many other German supporters of the revolution, like for instance Friedrich Schiller, Forster did not turn back from his revolutionary ideals under the pressure of the terror. He viewed the events in France as a force of nature that could not be slowed and that had to release its own energies to avoid being even more destructive.|$|E
5|$|By his return, he was {{critical}} of the Bible as history, and wondered why all religions should not be equally valid. In the next few years, while intensively speculating on geology and the transmutation of species, he gave much thought to religion and openly discussed this with his wife Emma, whose beliefs also came from intensive study and questioning. The theodicy of Paley and Thomas Malthus vindicated evils such as starvation {{as a result of}} a benevolent creator's laws, which had an overall good effect. To Darwin, natural selection produced the good of adaptation but removed the need for design, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> see the work of an omnipotent deity in all the pain and suffering, such as the ichneumon wasp paralysing caterpillars as live food for its eggs. He still viewed organisms as perfectly adapted, and On the Origin of Species reflects theological views. Though he thought of religion as a tribal survival strategy, Darwin was reluctant to give up the idea of God as an ultimate lawgiver. He was increasingly troubled by the problem of evil.|$|E
5|$|Nolan {{then became}} a staff officer, joining the staff of General George Berkeley, {{commander-in-chief}} in Madras, as an aide-de-camp in January 1849. He quickly became close friends with Berkeley's two sons, Charles and George, who were also enthusiastic about horse-racing. In 1850 Nolan accompanied Berkeley {{on a tour of}} the region, conducting horse trials to evaluate the use of geldings as cavalry mounts rather than stallions, and was also promoted, purchasing a Captaincy on 8 March. Despite these successes, Nolan recognised that his prospects were far more limited in India than in England, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> afford the increased costs of serving in the colonies. At the same time, service in India was not taken seriously by many of the officers in high command, and would not be sufficient on its own to advance him. Accordingly, he obtained two years sick leave on 16 January 1851 and returned to England, intending to tour Europe and write a book on cavalry theory.|$|E

5|$|The {{main problem}} confronting Guderian and his Sedan method was {{inadequate}} artillery support. Several batteries {{were stuck in}} traffic in the Ardennes <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> rely on the artillery batteries of his Panzer Divisions only. Everything depended on {{the support of the}} Luftwaffe. General der Flieger Hugo Sperrle, commander of Luftflotte 3, had planned a conventional method of a brief bombardment before the ground forces moved in. After preparatory raids, the medium and dive-bombers were to smash the French defences in a concentrated blow lasting 20 minutes. The raid was planned for 16:00 before the infantry crossed the Meuse. In collaboration, Bruno Loerzer's II. Fliegerkorps had developed the concept of the rolling raid with Guderian. The idea of a single massed strike was abandoned, and the German air units were to attack in small formations but constantly, through the day. It was deemed the effect would be threefold; the French artillery would be eliminated, the effect of continuous raids would damage enemy morale, and smaller formations would be more systematic and accurate against targets such as bunkers.|$|E
25|$|Because of the draw, Jack Johnson {{kept his}} championship. After the fight, he {{explained}} that his left arm was injured {{in the third round}} <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> use it.|$|E
25|$|After the Confederate {{garrison}} at Norfolk was evacuated, Commodore Josiah Tattnall {{knew that}} CSS Virginia had no home port <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> navigate her deep draft through the shallow {{stretches of the}} James River toward Richmond, so she was scuttled on May 11 off Craney Island to prevent her capture. This opened the James River at Hampton Roads to Federal gunboats.|$|E

25|$|As {{he had no}} army to maintain, and as he {{suppressed}} the small naval force kept up by the Medici, the whole of his revenue was left free {{for the improvement of}} his state. Leopold was never popular with his Italian subjects. His disposition was cold and retiring. His habits were simple to the verge of sordidness, though he could display splendour on occasion, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> help offending those of his subjects who had profited by the abuses of the Medicean régime.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of Meton, axial {{precession}} {{had not yet been}} discovered, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> distinguish between sidereal years (currently: 365.256363 days) and tropical years (currently: 365.242190 days). Most calendars, like the commonly used Gregorian calendar, are based on the tropical year and maintain the seasons at the same calendar times each year. Nineteen tropical years are about two hours shorter than 235 synodic months. The Metonic cycle's error is, therefore, one full day every 219 years, or 12.4 parts per million.|$|E
25|$|Patrese {{began to}} charge, passing Berger on lap 7. As Mansell was having {{difficulty}} {{finding a way}} around Senna, he put {{out his hand and}} waved Patrese ahead of him. He then attacked Senna and took the lead on lap 26. However, on the next lap, Patrese spun <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> select full gears then. He went to the pits and retired. At the same time, Prost passed Berger to take third. Mansell now began to hound Senna and went all directions to get ahead.|$|E

25|$|The Liberal Party, with a leadership—Harcourt in the Commons and Rosebery in the Lords—who detested each other, {{once again}} {{suffered}} factional divisions. Rosebery resigned in October 1896 and Harcourt followed him in December 1898. Asquith came under strong pressure {{to accept the}} nomination to take over as Liberal leader, but the post of Leader of the Opposition, though full-time, was then unpaid, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> afford {{to give up his}} income as a barrister. He and others prevailed on the former Secretary of State for War, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman to accept the post.|$|E
25|$|Paul Zorner {{was born}} on 31 March 1920 in Roben, Leobschütz, Upper Silesia. He was a son of head {{teachers}} and one of eight children. Zorner {{expressed an interest in}} Glider flying in his early years but the size of the family strained his parent's financial resources <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> take up the hobby. In the spring, 1938 aged 18, Zorner passed his Abitur, school leaving certificate. Zorner desired a military flying career and he applied to join the Luftwaffe and was accepted as a Fahnenjunker (officer candidate) in October 1938.|$|E
25|$|After the 1892 season had ended, {{a dreadful}} shock came {{when it was}} {{announced}} that Lohmann had contracted tuberculosis. In an effort to improve his health, Lohmann sailed during the 1892/1893 winter to Cape Town. Although at first it was hoped that he might return even when the 1893 season began, for two years Lohmann's health did not at first improve <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> play at all for Surrey in 1893 or 1894. In fact, Lohmann was not well enough to play any cricket until the 1894/1895 Currie Cup final where he turned out for Western Province.|$|E
60|$|Lemuel {{began to}} {{understand}} better how such nice young ladies could go with Berry.
