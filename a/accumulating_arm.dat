50|$|The {{transfer}} to Soviet Army control was resisted by locals. In December 1939, Father Szumowski and Father Cudnik formed a secret partisan network involving Biebrza villages from Rutkowskie {{in the south}} to Radzilow in the north. The task of the group was to <b>accumulate</b> <b>arms</b> for an anti-Soviet uprising and to carry out death sentences on collaborators. Probably as a result of betrayal, on the morning of June 23, 1940, the Soviet Army and the NKVD surrounded the conspiracy's headquarters. Nine guerrillas were killed and seven were captured. One of the consequences of breaking up the network were mass arrests. Waves of arrests, expulsions and prison executions continued until June 20-21, 1941 when the Germans invaded the Soviet Union.|$|R

60|$|The {{arrival of}} the fleet from England brought news of what had taken place since Captain Wilson's company had marched from Boston, a short time after the battle of Bunker's Hill. Immediately after the battle the colonists had sent two deputies, Penn and Lee, with a {{petition}} to Parliament {{for the restoration of}} peace. This petition was supported by a strong body in Parliament. The majority, however, argued that, from the conduct of the Americans, it was clear that they aimed at unconditional, unqualified, and total independence. In all their proceedings they had behaved as if entirely separated from Great Britain. Their professions and petition breathed peace and moderation; their actions and preparations denoted war and defiance; every attempt that could be made to soften their hostility had been in vain; their obstinacy was inflexible; and the more England had given in to their wishes, the more insolent and overbearing had their demands become. The stamp tax had been repealed, but their ill will had grown rather than abated. The taxations on imports had been entirely taken off save on one small item; but, rather than pay this, they had <b>accumulated</b> <b>arms</b> and ammunition, seized cannon belonging to the king, and everywhere prepared for armed resistance. Only two alternatives remained for the British nation to adopt--either to coerce the colonists to submission or to grant them their entire independence.|$|R
60|$|In {{modern times}} {{it is the}} {{practice}} of powerful nations to <b>accumulate</b> <b>arms</b> and munitions of war on storage in arsenals and naval depôts, so that the necessary supplies for very extended operations, whether of attack or defense, can be procured {{in a very short}} period of time. In respect to funds, too, modern nations have a great advantage over those of former days, in case of any sudden emergency arising to call for great and unusual expenditures. In consequence of the vast accumulation of capital in the hands of private individuals, and the confidence which is felt in the mercantile honor and good faith of most established governments at the present day, these governments can procure indefinite supplies of gold and silver at any time, by promising to pay an annual interest in lieu of the principal borrowed. It is true that, in these cases, a stipulation is made, by which the government may, at a certain specified period, pay back the principal, and so extinguish the annuity; but in respect to a vast portion of the amount so borrowed, it is not expected that this repayment will ever be made. The creditors, in fact, do not desire that it should be, as owners of property always prefer a safe annual income from it to the custody of the principal; and thus governments in good credit have sometimes induced their creditors to abate the rate of interest which they were receiving, by threatening otherwise to pay the debt in full.|$|R

The key for achieving a quick response is the Arm/Gripper Coupling Mechanism (AGCM), where the potential energy initially <b>accumulated</b> in the <b>arm</b> is transferred to the kinetic energy of the arm and, continuously, to the kinetic energy for closing the gripper at the capturing point without any time lag. The experimental results showthe maximum acceleration of 91 G, and the total capturing time of 0. 03 sec. Capturing a dropping ball is {{the highlight of the}} experiments. ...|$|R

Participants join in multifarious sensing tasks and share their data. The sensing result can be obtained in light of shared data.

40|$|Graduation date: 1984 Three {{approaches}} for evaluating mode I interlaminar strain energy release rates in graphite/epoxy composites were compared using experimental data from double cantilever beam specimens. Expressions for evaluating strain energy release rates were arrived at based on assumptions regarding specimen geometry and material behavior. The calculations included the direct method of the J integral approach, a compliance calibrated approach and an analytical equation derived from small deflection, linear beam bending theory. The J integral approach accounts for both linear and nonlinear material response, whereas the compliance calibrated and linear beam bending methods assume linear material behavior. Experimental observations of several material systems indicated a nonlinear elastic material response. Interlaminar strain energy release rates {{were found to}} be overestimated by methods assuming linear material behavior. Permanent deflection was seen to <b>accumulate</b> in the <b>arms</b> of the double cantilever beam specimen as the crack surface area increased.

To interfere with assembly {{of a proposed}} bound iron-sulphur cluster, site-directed mutants were constructed by introducing cDNA with altered codons for two adjacent cysteines, Cys- 101 and Cys- 102. The mutant complexes were purified and their enzymic activities and EPR and UV/visible spectra were analysed. Either of the mutations abolishes assembly of iron-sulphur cluster N 2, showing that this redox group is bound to the 19. 3 kDa protein. We also observed an interference with the reduction of redox group X, suggesting that cluster N 2 is the electron donor to this high-potential redox group...|$|R

A search for cells with 1 or more (chromosome(s) possessing a subterminal secondary constriction, as has been suggested {{to be associated with}} the presence of EBV, revealed 1 EBV-negative 1 M line and 2 EBV-positive 1 M lines having low incidences of cells with the (chromosome marker, 1 % in 2 lines and 4 % in the third.

Analysis of the obtained mutant nuo 21. 3 c revealed that complex I fails to assemble. The peripheral {{arm of the}} enzyme is disrupted while its membrane <b>arm</b> <b>accumulates.</b> Furthermore, mutated 21. 3 c-kD proteins, in which selected cysteine residues were substituted with alanines or serines, were expressed in mutant nuo 21. 3 c.

Homozygous crosses of nuo 21. 3 c strain, and of other complex I mutants, are unable to complete sexual development. The crosses are blocked at an early developmental stage, before fusion of the nuclei of opposite mating types. This phenotype can be rescued only by transformation with the intact gene. Our results suggest that this might be due to the compromised capacity of complex I-defective strains in energy production...|$|R
5000|$|Most robot {{applications}} require rigidity. Serial robots may {{achieve this}} by using high-quality rotary joints that permit movement in one axis but are rigid against movement outside this. Any joint permitting movement {{must also have}} this movement under deliberate control by an actuator. A movement requiring several axes thus requires a number of such joints. Unwanted flexibility or sloppiness in one joint causes a similar sloppiness in the arm, which may be amplified by {{the distance between the}} joint and the end-effectuor: there is no opportunity to brace one joint's movement against another. Their inevitable hysteresis and off-axis flexibility <b>accumulates</b> along the <b>arm's</b> kinematic chain; a precision serial manipulator is a compromise between precision, complexity, mass (of the manipulator and of the manipulated objects) and cost. On the other hand, with parallel manipulators, a high rigidity may be obtained with a small mass of the manipulator (relatively to the charge being manipulated). This allows high precision and high speed of movements, and motivates the use of parallel manipulators in flight simulators (high speed with rather large masses) and electrostatic or magnetic lenses in particle accelerators (very high precision in positioning large masses).|$|R
6000|$|The {{next step}} was to call a general council of all the chieftains and nobles of the land, and also the notables, as they were called, or {{principal}} officers and municipal authorities of the towns. The main point of interest for the consideration of this assembly was, whether the country would submit to the necessary taxation for raising the necessary funds. William had ample power, as duke, to decide upon the invasion and to undertake it. He could also, without much difficulty, raise the necessary number of men; for every baron in his realm was bound, by the feudal conditions on which he held his land, to furnish his quota of men for any military enterprise in which his sovereign might see fit to engage. But for so distant and vast an undertaking as this, William needed a much larger supply of funds than were usually required in the wars of those days. For raising such large supplies, the political institutions of the Middle Ages had not made any adequate provision. Governments then had no power of taxation, like that so freely exercised in modern times; and even now, taxes in France and England take the form of grants from the people to the kings. And as to the contrivance, so exceedingly ingenious, by which inexhaustible resources are opened to governments at the present day--that is, the plan of borrowing the money, and leaving posterity to pay or repudiate the debt, as they please, no minister of finance had, in William's day, been brilliant enough to discover it. Thus each ruler had to rely, then, mainly on the rents and income from his own lands, and other private resources, for the comparatively small amount of money that he needed in his brief campaigns. But now William perceived that ships must be built and equipped, and great stores of provisions <b>accumulated,</b> and <b>arms</b> and munitions of war provided, all which would require a considerable outlay; and how was this money to be obtained? ...|$|R

40|$|We have {{isolated}} and characterized the nuclear genes encoding the 12. 3 -kD subunit of the membrane {{arm and the}} 29. 9 -kD subunit of the peripheral arm of complex I from Neurospora crassa. The former gene {{was known to be}} located in linkage group I and the latter is now assigned to linkage group IV of the fungal genome. The genes were separately transformed into different N. crassa strains and transformants with duplicated DNA sequences were isolated. Selected transformants were then mated with other strains to generate repeat-induced point mutations in both copies of the genes present in the nucleus of the parental transformant. From the progeny of the crosses, we were then able to recover two individual mutants lacking the 12. 3 - and 29. 9 -kD proteins in their mitochondria, mutants nuo 12. 3 and nuo 29. 9, respectively. Several other subunits of complex I are present in the mutant organelles, although with altered stoichiometries as compared with those in the wild-type strain. Based on the analysis of Triton-solubilized mitochondrial complexes in sucrose gradients, neither mutant is able to fully assemble complex I. Our results indicate that mutant nuo 12. 3 separately assembles the peripheral arm and most of the membrane arm of the enzyme. Mutant nuo 29. 9 seems to <b>accumulate</b> the membrane <b>arm</b> of complex I and being devoid of the peripheral part.
