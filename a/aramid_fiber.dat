Depending on the music or style that the drumline plays, different brands and types of heads may be used. For maximum volume and stick articulation, a head made of woven Kevlar fibers is used and usually tuned to a very high tension. If the player desires a slightly [...] "softer" [...] feel, then an <b>aramid</b> <b>fiber</b> head (such as Remo's Black Max) is a good choice. Finally, if more overtones and the softest head-feel are desired, the player {{may want to consider}} a heavy clear head with a center reinforcement dot (such as a Remo Powerstroke 77). This type of head is rarely used today among competitive drumlines, mostly owing to its lack of outdoor projection in comparison with Kevlar, but nonetheless it may still be used if a unique timbre is desired. One of the most famous marching bands utilizing this head is the Ohio State University Marching Band.

Some of the properties of PBT grade CRASTIN 6130 NC 010 ®. The tested materials they were obtained by molding at ICEFS Savinesti Romania. The <b>aramid</b> <b>fibers</b> added into PBT were supplied by Teijin, and have an average length of 125 µm. Tests were done {{with the help of}} a block-on-ring tribotester. The tests parameters were: three normal forces (F = 5 N, F = 15 N and F = 30 N), three values of sliding speed (v = 0. 25 m/s, v = 0. 50 m/s and v = 0. 75 m/s) and a sliding distance of L = 5000 m, in dry regime, each test characterized by (F, v, L) being done twice. The conclusion of this research was that adding short <b>aramid</b> <b>fibers</b> in PBT improves the wear resistance, but slightly increases the friction coefficient.

The short <b>aramid</b> <b>fibers</b> (Teijin) were approximately 200 [...] . 250 µm in length and 10 µm in diameter, with expended extremities due to manufacturing process. Tests were done on block-on-ring tribotester on a BRUKER-CETR®. UTM 2 system. The test parameters were: sliding speed (0. 25, 0. 50 and 0. 75 m/s), the load (5, 10, 15 and 30 N) and the sliding distance of 5, 000 m. There were analyzed the dependence of friction coefficient, temperature on the contact edge and wear of the polymeric materials. SEM images help identify wear mechanisms and pointed out the different behavior of the two matrixes. Adding <b>aramid</b> <b>fibers</b> into a matrix of either PA or PBT makes the resulting blends have better tribological characteristics: the wear is much lower, the friction coefficient slightly increases, but remaining in an acceptable range for actual applications as compared with the neat polymers.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{environmental}} conditioning on tensile properties of high performance <b>aramid</b> <b>fibers</b> at near-ambient temperatures A. Abu Obaid 1, J. M. Deitzel 1, J. W. Gillespie Jr 1 – 3 and J. Q. Zheng 4 Aramid and <b>aramid</b> copolymer <b>fibers</b> {{are used in}} a wide variety of military and civilian applications; however, the long-term effects of environmental exposure on tensile properties are still not well understood. The current effort investi-gates the effect of hygrothermal conditioning on the tensile properties of Kevlar KM 2, Twaron, and the newly available Russian copolymer, Armos high performance fibers. Moisture uptake studies show that at room temperature, water diffuses more slowly into the copolymer Armos (D = 8. 7 1013 cm 2 /s) compared to the Kevlar KM 2 and Twaron homopolymers (D = 2. 16 1012 cm 2 /s and D = 1. 8 1012 cm 2 /s, respectively). Tensile properties have been measured for these <b>aramid</b> <b>fibers</b> that have been conditioned in water at 40 C, 60 C, 80 C, and 100 C for periods of 17 and 34 days. For both aramid and <b>aramid</b> copolymer <b>fibers,</b> hygrothermal conditioning did not significantly change fiber tensile properties below 80 C. At the most extreme condition of 100 C, 34 days, <b>aramid</b> <b>fibers</b> showed significant loss of tensile strength (58 % for KM 2 and 34 % for Twaron), while a reduction in tensile strength of 13 % (Armos) was observed for <b>aramid</b> copolymer (Armos) <b>fibers.</b> Conditioned fibers exhibited no significant change in mass as a result of the conditioning procedure and FTIR spectroscopy results did not indicate signs of chemical or thermo-oxidative change due to hygrothermal conditioning. These results suggest that in <b>aramid</b> <b>fibers,</b> the primary mechanism of degradation at temperatures between 80 C and 100 C is due to the ingress and egress of moisture in the highly ordered core structure of the fiber. The presence of water in the intercrystalline regions of the fiber core enable segmental chain motion that can relax tie molecules, alter crystal orientation, and change apparent crystallite size. Because of differences in molecular architecture and phase morphology, the aramid copolymer, Armos, is less susceptible to degradation of tensile prop-erties under these conditions...|$|R
