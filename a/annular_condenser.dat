40|$|A {{new design}} AMTEC {{converter}} model was developed, and its effectiveness as a design tool was evaluated. To develop the model, {{requirements of the}} model were defined, several new design models were successively developed, and finally an optimal new design model was developed. The model was created within Sinda/Fluint, with its graphical interface, Thermal Desktop, a software package {{that can be used}} to conduct complex thermal and fluid analyses. Performance predictions were then correlated and compared with actual performance data from the Road Runner II AMTEC converter. Predicted performance results were within 10 % of actual performance data for all operating conditions analyzed. This accuracy tended to increase within operating ranges that would be more likely encountered in AMTEC applications. Performance predictions and parametric design studies were then performed on a proposed new design converter model with a variety of <b>annular</b> <b>condenser</b> heights and with potassium as a working fluid to evaluate the effects of various design modifications. Results clearly indicated the effects of the converter design modifications on the converter's power and efficiency, thus simplifying the design optimization process. With the close correlation to actual data and the design information obtained from parametric studies, it was determined that the model could serve as an effective tool for the design of AMTEC converters...|$|E
40|$|Human {{polymorphonuclear}} leucocytes, PMN, {{are highly}} motile cells with average 12 - 15 µm diameters and prominent, loboid nuclei. They are {{produced in the}} bone marrow, are essential for host defense, and are the most populous of white blood cell types. PMN also participate in acute and chronic inflammatory processes, in the regulation of the immune response, in angiogenesis, and interact with tumors. To accommodate these varied functions, their behavior is adaptive, but still definable {{in terms of a}} set of behavioral states. PMN morphodynamics have generally involved a non-equilibrium stationary, spheroid Idling state that transitions to an activated, ellipsoid translocating state in response to chemical signals. These two behavioral shape-states, spheroid and ellipsoid, are generally recognized as making up the vocabulary of a healthy PMN. A third, "random" state has occasionally been reported as associated with disease states. I have observed this third, Treadmilling state, in PMN from healthy subjects, the cells demonstrating metastable dynamical behaviors known to anticipate phase transitions in mathematical, physical, and biological systems. For this study, human PMN were microscopically imaged and analyzed as single living cells. I used a microscope with a novel high aperture, cardioid <b>annular</b> <b>condenser</b> with better than 100 nanometer resolution of simultaneous, mixed dark field and intrinsic fluorescent images to record shape changes in 189 living PMNs. Relative radial roundness, R(t), served as a computable order parameter. Comparison of R(t) series of 10 cells in the Idling and 10 in the Treadmilling state reveals the robustness of the "random" appearing Treadmilling state, and the emergence of behaviors observed in the neighborhood of global state transitions, including increased correlation length and variance (divergence), sudden jumps, mixed phases, bimodality, power spectral scaling and temporal slowing. Wavelet transformation of an R(t) series of an Idling to Treadmilling state change, demonstrated behaviors concomitant with the observed transition...|$|E

To achieve this, using the new modified three-fluid model and Stevanovic et al. ’s correlation for the steam–liquid film interfacial friction coefficient, pressure drop is calculated in two new inlet pressures (i. e.,  1. 5 and 2. 5 (MPa)), {{for which there is}} no available experimental data of pressure drop.

40|$|A {{description}} of the condensation heat transfer process in microgravity is given. A {{review of the literature}} is also reported. The most essential element of condensation heat transfer in microgravity is the condensate removal mechanism. Two mechanisms for condensate removal are analyzed by looking into two problems. The first problem is concerned with film condensation on a flat porous plate with the condensate being removed by suction at the wall. The second problem is an analytical prediction of the heat transfer coefficient for <b>condensing</b> <b>annular</b> flows with the condensate film driven by the vapor shear. It is concluded that both suction and vapor shear can effectively drain the condensate to ensure continuous operation of the condensers operated under a microgravity environment. It is recommended that zero-g flight experiments be carried out to verify the prediction made in the present report. The results contained in this report should also aid in the design of future space condensers...|$|R
40|$|Experiments are {{performed}} to investigate condensation of FC- 72 along parallel, square micro-channels with a hydraulic diameter of 1 mm and {{a length of}} 29. 9 cm, which are formed in the top surface of a solid copper plate. The condensation is achieved by rejecting heat to a counter flow of water through channels brazed to {{the underside of the}} copper plate. Using high-speed video imaging and photomicrographic techniques, five distinct flow regimes are identified: smooth-annular, wavy-annular, transition, slug, and bubbly, with the smooth-annular and wavy-annular regimes being most prevalent. A new heat transfer coefficient correlation is proposed for annular condensation in mini/micro-channels. It shows excellent predictive capability based on both the present experimental data and the database for mini/micro-channel flows amassed from eight previous sources. ^ A theoretical control-volume-based model for <b>annular</b> <b>condensing</b> flow is proposed where mass and momentum conservations are applied to control volumes encompassing the liquid film and the vapor core separately. The model accounts for interfacial suppression of turbulent eddies due to surface tension {{with the aid of a}} new eddy diffusivity model specifically tailored to shear-driven turbulent films. The new model accurately captures the present pressure drop and heat transfer coefficient data in both magnitude and trend. ^ This study also explored heat diffusion effects in micro-channel heat sinks. Detailed analytical models are constructed for heat sinks having micro-channels with rectangular, inverse trapezoidal, triangular, trapezoidal, and diamond-shaped cross sections. For a circular micro-channel, an alternative analytical power series solution technique is presented due to a singularity point in the governing heat diffusion equation. The analytical results are compared to one-dimensional and two-dimensional numerical simulations for different micro-channel diameters, aspect ratios, fin spacings, and Biot numbers. This study proves the analytical models are very effective tools for the design and thermal resistance prediction of micro-channel heat sinks. ^ Universal approaches to predicting the two-phase frictional pressure drop and the heat transfer coefficient in condensing and boiling mini/micro-channel flows are proposed that are capable of tackling many fluids with drastically different thermophysical properties and very broad ranges of all geometrical and flow parameters of practical interest. For the frictional pressure drop in condensing and adiabatic flows, a universal approach is proposed by incorporating appropriate dimensionless relations in a separated flow model to account for both small channel size and different combinations of liquid and vapor states. For the heat transfer coefficient in mini/micro-channel condensing flows, two new correlations are proposed, one for predominantly annular flows, and the second for slug and bubbly flows. For the frictional pressure gradient in boiling mini/micro-channel flows, the separated flow technique developed for non-boiling (condensing and adiabatic) mini/micro-channel flows is modified to account for the differences in frictional pressure gradient predictions between non-boiling versus boiling mini/micro-channel flows. For the boiling heat transfer in mini/micro-channel flows, a correlation for the dryout incident quality is first proposed to exclude the partial dryout data. Two new correlations for saturated boiling mini/micro-channel flows are then proposed, one for nucleate boiling dominant regime, and the other for convective boiling dominant regime. These new approaches are shown to provide excellent predictions of the consolidated database. It is shown this accuracy is fairly even for different working fluids, and over broad ranges of hydraulic diameter, mass velocity, quality and pressure, and for both single and multiple mini/micro-channels. ...|$|R
