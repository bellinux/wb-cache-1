5|$|In {{between the}} time Scott {{released}} Alien in 1979 {{and returned to the}} franchise with Prometheus in 2012, he directed another notable science fiction film concerning artificial intelligence, Blade Runner, in 1982. Contrary to the white-blooded androids of Alien that emulate emotions and recognize a disconnect with humanity, Blade Runner features the replicants- enhanced biorobotic humanoids that may only be identified by their lacking emotions. In order to maintain control, the replicants' human creators install false memories that detail entire lives that give them <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>identity.</b> Blade Runner, a largely influential film, has prompted a slew of philosophical questions concerning artificial intelligence and whether or not an android could truly be considered alive. The film specifically questions whether thoughts, <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>identity,</b> emotions and consciousness in general, may be something genuine when applied to artificial intelligence. Due to David identifying himself as a living entity - similar to the replicants - film critics in 2012 would come not to only question if Prometheus was a direct prequel to Alien, but if the film had a relation to Blade Runner.|$|E
5|$|Kraków {{is divided}} into 18 {{administrative}} districts (dzielnica) or boroughs, each {{with a degree of}} autonomy within its own municipal government. Prior to March 1991, the city had been divided into four quarters which still give <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>identity</b> to Kraków – the towns of Podgórze, Nowa Huta, and Krowodrza which were amalgamated into the city of Kraków as it expanded, and the ancient town centre of Kraków itself.|$|E

25|$|Evidence {{about the}} {{development}} of adoptees can be supported in newer studies. It can be said that adoptees, in some respect, tend to develop differently from the general population. This can be seen in many aspects of life, but usually can be found as a greater risk around the time of adolescence. For example, it has been found that many adoptees experience difficulty in establishing <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>identity.</b>|$|E
25|$|Evidence of Sabaean {{influence}} {{is found in}} northern Ethiopia, where the South Arabian alphabet, religion and pantheon, and the South Arabian style of art and architecture were introduced.

25|$|As {{children}} {{transition from}} early childhood to middle childhood, their motivation to participate changes. In both the Indigenous communities of Quechua people and Rioja in Peru, children often experience a transition {{in which they}} become more included into their family's and community's endeavors. This changes their position and role in their families to more responsible ones and leads {{to an increase in}} their eagerness to participate and belong. As children go through this transition, they often develop <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>identity</b> within their family and community.|$|E
25|$|The narrative/identity account {{suggests}} that the reminiscence bump occurs because <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>identity</b> develops during adolescence and early adulthood. Research {{suggests that}} memories that have more influence and significance to one's self are more frequently rehearsed in defining one's identity, and are therefore better remembered later in life (Ece & Gulgoz, 2014). Identity formation provides added motivation for using cognitive processes to ensure recall of these memories. The events from this period {{are more likely to}} be organized into a story or view of oneself, and benefits from the advantage of schematic organization in memory.|$|E
25|$|From within Naples' Poggioreale prison Cutolo {{built a new}} organisation: the Nuova Camorra Organizzata (NCO). He {{began by}} befriending young inmates {{unfamiliar}} with jail, giving them <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>identity</b> and worth, {{so much so that}} when they were released they would send Cutolo ‘flowers’ (i.e. money), which enabled him to increase his network. He helped poorer prisoners by buying food for them from the jail store, or arranging for food to be sent in from outside. In such ways Cutolo created many ‘debts’ or ‘rain cheques’ which he would cash at the opportune moment. As his following grew, he also began to exercise a monopoly of violence within a number of prisons, thus increasing his power. By the early seventies, Cutolo had become so powerful {{that he was able to}} decide which of his followers would be moved to which jails, use a prison governor's telephone to make calls anywhere in the world, and allegedly even slap the prison governor on one occasion for daring to search his cell. Another key bond Cutolo created was regular payments to the families of NCO members sent to prison, thereby guaranteeing the allegiance of both prisoners and their families.|$|E

500|$|The {{style of}} the album {{combined}} progressive metal and space rock with influences and elements from new wave and electronica, utilizing programming and synthesizers. According to Jared Leto, the band wanted to create [...] "something that had cohesiveness and kind of an atmospheric musical story to it". He identified groups that had <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>identity</b> and atmosphere as being influential on the album's songwriting. He cited classic stoner rock artists, to which {{he and his brother}} Shannon had listened while growing up. Eventually, they gravitated toward more conceptual work like Pink Floyd, David Bowie and The Cure. Thirty Seconds to Mars also drew influences from acts such as Björk, Rush, and Depeche Mode; according to Shannon Leto, the inspirations derived from [...] "mostly big conceptional bands; bands that had depth; bands that were dynamic".|$|E

2500|$|It is {{here also}} that Bakhtin {{introduces}} an [...] "architectonic" [...] or schematic {{model of the}} human psyche which consists of three components: [...] "I-for-myself", [...] "I-for-the-other", and [...] "other-for-me". The I-for-myself is an unreliable source of identity, and Bakhtin argues {{that it is the}} I-for-the-other through which human beings develop <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>identity</b> because it serves as an amalgamation {{of the way in which}} others view me. Conversely, other-for-me describes the way in which others incorporate my perceptions of them into their own identities.

However, emotions such as senses of identity, self-worth and dignity are felt in the breast of the employee, are highly subjective and would, necessarily, be felt to differing extents by different employees within the same working environment.

2500|$|With {{the advent}} of {{education}} reform {{there is a greater}} emphasis on group projects, open-ended assignments on top of traditional homework. The current workload of a primary student in Hong Kong includes approximately two hours of schoolwork nightly. Along with extra-curricular activities, Hong Kong's education has become synonymous for leaning towards quantity. As early as March 1987, education advisory inspectors became concerned with the excessive amounts of [...] "mechanical work and meaningless homework". In particular, history education has been recognised as ineffective, with critics claiming that the curriculum is not capable of delivering <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>identity.</b> Not only that, students have to memorise the whole history texts, thereby indicating that rote-learning has greater priority than absorbing and understanding material.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are many}} ways in which the concept of {{identity}} can be defined. It is true in all cases that identity construction is an ongoing process of development, change and maintenance of identifying with the self. Research has shown that adolescence is a time of identity progression rather than regression. One's identity tends to lack stability in the beginning years of life but gains a more stable sense in later periods of childhood and adolescence. Typically associated with a time of experimentation, there are endless factors that go into the construction of one's identity. As well as being many factors, there are many types of identities one can associate with. Some categories of identity include gender, sexuality, class, racial and religious, etc. For transracial and international adoptees, tension is generally found in the categories of racial, ethnic and national identification. Because of this, the strength and functionality of family relationships play a huge role in its development and outcome of identity construction. Transracial and transnational adoptees tend to develop feelings of a lack of acceptance because of such racial, ethnic, and cultural differences. Therefore, exposing transracial and transnational adoptees to their [...] "cultures of origin" [...] is important in order to better develop <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>identity</b> and appreciation for cultural diversity. Identity construction and reconstruction for transnational adoptees the instant they are adopted. For example, based upon specific laws and regulations of the United States, the Child Citizen Act of 2000 makes sure to grant immediate U.S. citizenship to adoptees. Although this act is specific to particular laws created by the United States, it can be understood that such a notion reconstructs <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>identity</b> for adoptees as a United States citizen. Transnational adoptees also have to evaluate their racial, ethnic and cultural differences that are incognizant with their adoption family. Therefore, these factors may explain how tension is created with transracial and transnational adoptees.|$|E
