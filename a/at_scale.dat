Henrik Stiesdal, former Chief Technical Officer at Siemens Wind Power, has stated that by 2025 energy from offshore wind {{will be one of the}} cheapest, scalable solutions in the UK, compared to other renewables and fossil fuel energy sources, if the true cost to society is factored into the cost of energy equation. He calculates the cost at that time to be 43 EUR/MWh for onshore, and 72 EUR/MWh for offshore wind.|$|E

25|$|The {{queen snake}} {{is similar in}} {{appearance}} to a garter snake, genus Thamnophis, so is often confused with that group. The queen snake is olive to gray or dark brown in overall coloration, with peach or yellow stripes that run down its length at the first scale row. There are also four prominent ventral stripes of a darker colour, and as no other similar species has stripes running {{down the length of}} its belly, this is an important feature in identifying this snake. In the young and juvenile snakes there are three extra stripes: one stripe that runs along the vertebral dorsal scales, and two stripes (one on each side) that run {{down the length of the}} body <b>at</b> <b>scale</b> rows five and six. These extra stripes tend to fade as the snake matures, but when young the snake will have a total of seven stripes, three on the back and four on the belly, which gives cause for its taxonomical reference name, Regina (queen) septemvittata (seven-striped). The belly of the snake is a cream to yellow colour.|$|E

40|$|Scenario {{planning}} is increasingly {{recognized as a}} useful tool for exploring change in social-ecological systems on decadal to centennial time horizons. In environmental decision making, scenario development tends to include participatory methods for engaging stakeholders and is conducted <b>at</b> multiple <b>scales.</b> This paper presents insights from participatory scenario development in two separate multiscale environmental assessments. We find that, to engage stakeholders <b>at</b> multiple <b>scales,</b> {{it is important that the}} issues explored <b>at</b> each <b>scale</b> be relevant and credible to stakeholders <b>at</b> that <b>scale.</b> An important trade-off exists between maintaining relevance to stakeholders <b>at</b> different <b>scales</b> and maintaining consistency across scales to allow for comparison of scenarios. Where downscaling methods are used to ensure consistency, there can be important consequences for (1) the diversity of scenario outcomes, (2) temporal mismatches in the storylines <b>at</b> different <b>scales,</b> and (3) power relationships among stakeholders <b>at</b> different <b>scales.</b> We suggest that development of participatory scenarios <b>at</b> multiple <b>scales</b> has a strong potential to contribute to environmental decision making, but it requires a substantial investment of time and resources to realize its full potential...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} interplay of {{clumping}} <b>at</b> small <b>scales</b> with the collapse and relaxation of perturbations <b>at</b> larger <b>scales</b> using N-Body simulations. We quantify the effect of collapsed haloes on perturbations <b>at</b> larger <b>scales</b> using two point correlation function, moments of counts in cells and mass function. The {{purpose of the study}} is twofold and the primary aim is to quantify the role played by collapsed low mass haloes in the evolution of perturbations <b>at</b> large <b>scales,</b> this is in view of the strong effect seen when the large scale perturbation is highly symmetric. Another reason for this study is to ask whether features or a cutoff in the initial power spectrum can be detected using measures of clustering <b>at</b> <b>scales</b> that are already non-linear. The final aim is to understand the effect of ignoring perturbations <b>at</b> <b>scales</b> smaller than the resolution of N-Body simulations. We find that these effects are ignorable if the scale of non-linearity is larger than the average inter-particle separation in simulations. Features in in the initial power spectrum can be detected easily if the scale of these features is in the linear regime, detecting such features becomes difficult as the relevant scales become non-linear. We find no effect of features in initial power spectra <b>at</b> small <b>scales</b> on the evolved power spectra <b>at</b> large <b>scales.</b> We may conclude that in general, the effect on evolution of perturbations <b>at</b> large <b>scales</b> of clumping on small scales is very small and may be ignored in most situations.

Our analysis attempts to draw conclusions on the integration of regional and local conservation assessments, specifically, {{with regard to the}} acquisition of fine-scale data to complement the regional assessment. This study undertaken in Réunion Island (Indian Ocean) assessed how biodiversity surrogates targeted <b>at</b> a regional <b>scale</b> represented other biodiversity surrogates <b>at</b> a local <b>scale.</b> Biodiversity surrogates <b>at</b> both <b>scales</b> consisted of species, habitats and processes. Habitats and processes <b>at</b> regional <b>scale</b> were defined using a coarser scale of thematic resolution than <b>at</b> local <b>scale.</b> The surrogacy was tested in terms of incidental representation of local-scale features in the regional assessments, and correlation of irreplaceability values between scales. Near-minimum sets and irreplaceability values were generated using MARXAN software. Our results revealed that conservation targets for processes <b>at</b> local <b>scale</b> were never met incidentally, while threatened species and fragmented habitats were also usually under-represented. More specifically, requiring only 12 % of the local planning domain, the application of species as surrogates <b>at</b> regional <b>scale</b> was the least effective option at representing biodiversity features <b>at</b> local <b>scale.</b> In contrast, habitats <b>at</b> a coarse <b>scale</b> of thematic resolution achieved a significant proportion of conservation targets incidentally (67 %) and their irreplaceability values were well correlated with the irreplaceability values of surrogates <b>at</b> local <b>scale.</b> The results highlighted that all three types of biodiversity surrogates are complementary for assessing overall biodiversity. Because of the cost of data acquisition, we recommended that the most efficient strategy to develop nested regional/local conservation plans is to apply habitats and processes <b>at</b> a coarse <b>scale</b> of thematic resolution <b>at</b> regional <b>scale,</b> and threatened species and degraded habitats <b>at</b> local <b>scale,</b> with their fine-scale mapping limited to highly transformed areas...|$|R
