The risk is highest <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>to</b> five years after chemotherapy.

5|$|Cats {{are ready}} to go to new homes at about 12 weeks of age, when they {{are ready to}} leave their mother. They can be surgically sterilized (spayed or castrated) as early as 7 weeks to limit {{unwanted}} reproduction. This surgery also prevents undesirable sex-related behavior, such as aggression, territory marking (spraying urine) in males and yowling (calling) in females. Traditionally, this surgery was performed at around six to nine months of age, but it is increasingly being performed prior to puberty, at <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>to</b> six months. In the US, about 80% of household cats are neutered.|$|E

5|$|Coyotes {{are often}} {{attracted}} to dog food and {{animals that are}} small enough to appear as prey. Items such as garbage, pet food, and sometimes feeding stations for birds and squirrels attract coyotes into backyards. <b>About</b> <b>three</b> <b>to</b> five pets attacked by coyotes are brought into the Animal Urgent Care hospital of South Orange County (California) each week, the majority of which are dogs, since cats typically do not survive the attacks. Scat analysis collected near Claremont, California, revealed that coyotes relied heavily on pets as a food source in winter and spring. At one location in Southern California, coyotes began relying on a colony of feral cats as a food source. Over time, the coyotes killed most of the cats, and then continued to eat the cat food placed daily at the colony site by people who were maintaining the cat colony.|$|E
5|$|Further {{analysis}} shows that several processes were in {{progress in the}} late Cretaceous seas and partially overlapped in time, then ended with the abrupt mass extinction. The diversity of marine life decreased when the climate near the K-T boundary increased in temperature. The temperature increased <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>to</b> four degrees very rapidly between 65.4 and 65.2 million years ago, which is {{around the time of}} the extinction event. Not only did the climate temperature increase, but the water temperature decreased causing a drastic decrease in marine diversity.|$|E
5|$|Influenza spreads {{around the}} world in a yearly outbreak, {{resulting}} in <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>to</b> five million cases of severe illness and about 250,000 to 500,000 deaths. In the Northern and Southern parts of the world, outbreaks occur mainly in winter while in areas around the equator outbreaks may occur at any time of the year. Death occurs mostly in the young, the old and those with other health problems. Larger outbreaks known as pandemics are less frequent. In the 20th century, three influenza pandemics occurred: Spanish influenza in 1918 (~50 million deaths), Asian influenza in 1957 (two million deaths), and Hong Kong influenza in 1968 (one million deaths). The World Health Organization declared an outbreak of a new type of influenza A/H1N1 to be a pandemic in June 2009. Influenza may also affect other animals, including pigs, horses and birds.|$|E

5|$|It is {{estimated}} {{that there were two}} billion cases of gastroenteritis that resulted in 1.3million deaths globally in 2015. Children and those in the developing world are most commonly affected. As of 2011, in those less than five, there were about 1.7billion cases resulting in 0.7million deaths, with most of these occurring in the world's poorest nations. More than 450,000 of these fatalities are due to rotavirus in children under 5years of age. Cholera causes <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>to</b> five million cases of disease and kills approximately 100,000 people yearly. In the developing world, children less than two years of age frequently get six or more infections a year that result in significant gastroenteritis. It is less common in adults, partly due to the development of acquired immunity.|$|E
5|$|Thorium is weakly radioactive: {{all of its}} known {{isotopes}} are unstable. The {{most stable}} isotope of thorium, 232Th, has a half-life of 14.05billionyears, or {{about the age of}} the universe; it decays very slowly via alpha decay, starting a decay chain named the thorium series that ends at stable 208Pb. Thorium and uranium are the only two radioactive elements that still occur naturally in large quantities as primordial elements. It is estimated to be <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>to</b> four times more abundant than uranium in the Earth's crust, and is chiefly refined from monazite sands as a by-product of extracting rare-earth metals.|$|E
5|$|Staff at the Smithsonian National Zoological Park in Washington, D.C., {{reported}} {{that some of}} the animals in the park appeared to show behavior suggesting that they anticipated the earthquake from seconds to minutes before it was felt in the area. The earthquake was felt at the great ape exhibits during afternoon feeding time. <b>About</b> <b>three</b> <b>to</b> ten seconds before the quake, many of the apes abandoned their food and {{climbed to the top of}} a tree-like structure in the exhibit. The red ruffed lemurs sounded an alarm call about 15 minutes before the quake, and the flock of 64 flamingos rushed about and grouped themselves together just before the quake. During the quake, some animals vocalized, some ran or dove for cover, and some stood up and stared at the walls of their enclosures. Some of the animals remained agitated for the rest of the day, while others calmed quickly. The Zoo's giant pandas did not appear to respond to the quake.|$|E
