25|$|The 2007 {{parliamentary}} elections have shown {{an improvement in}} the scores of the Reform Party, gaining 12 seats and reaching 31 MPs; the Centre Party held, while the unified right-conservative Union of Pro Patria and Res Publica lost 16.

The new configuration of the Estonian Parliament shows a prevalence of centre-left parties. The Centre Party, led by the mayor of Tallinn Edgar Savisaar, has been increasingly excluded from collaboration, since his open collaboration with Putin's United Russia party, real estate scandals in Tallinn, and the Bronze Soldier controversy, considered as a deliberate attempt of splitting the Estonian society by provoking the Russian minority. The lack of a concrete possibility for government <b>alternance</b> in Estonia has been quoted as a concern.|$|E

2500|$|The {{unofficial}} Liberal Party {{tradition was}} to alternate between francophone and anglophone leaders, a tradition informally known as <b>alternance.</b> This tradition would be broken if any candidate other than Stéphane Dion were to win. However, the <b>alternance</b> principle was not widely {{cited as a}} specific campaign issue. In fact, throughout the campaign, Dion was considered an [...] "underdog" [...] candidate among the [...] "top tier" [...] (with Rae & Ignatieff at the very top). Although polls consistently showed him as a popular second choice of delegates committed to other candidates, Dion's status as a Quebecer was widely considered a handicap, with conventional wisdom suggesting that the party was unlikely to turn to its third consecutive leader from Quebec. However Dion's chances, {{along with those of}} Brison, Dryden and Volpe, appeared bolstered by another informal party tradition: Since Mackenzie King succeeded Wilfrid Laurier in 1919, every Liberal leader had served in the previous leader's Cabinet. At that point in time, aside from incumbent Liberal leader Alexander MacKenzie, Edward Blake and Mackenzie King were the only Liberal leaders that had never served in the Cabinet of a previous Liberal leader.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} the development under metamorphic conditions of banded skarns and oscillatory precipitation by metasomatism. Two types of banded skarns are described at Rio Marina (Elba, Italy), {{the first one}} is composed of light pyroxene (hedenbergite) bands and dark ilvaite bands, and another one is composed of light quartz bands and dark ilvaite bands. The directions of the bands are parallel to the zoning of the skarns or to the contact between the skarn and the limestone. The geochemical studies indicate that the banded skarns and the ordinary skarns are formed upon the same massive and homogeneous limestones and that the formation of the skarns require important gains of Si and Fe and losses of Ca and CO 2. The same fluid is responsible for the formation of the ordinary and the banded skarns. The comparison of the banded skarns of Rio Marina with other examples of banded skarns allow us to state the following rules: (1) The banded skarns can occur as alternating strata or as orbicular structures. (2) The width of the bands varies from 0. 2 to 6 mm; the widths of the light bands and the dark bands are the same in most cases. (3) In banded skarns {{there is at least one}} mineral constituted not only of an element, such as Ca or Mg, derived from the dissolution of the carbonates, but also of an element, such as Si or Fe, derived from the fluid. The formation of banded skarns requires the coupling between the precipitation of the minerals in the bands and the dissolution of the carbonates. The second mineral is composed essentially of the elements derived from the fluid, such as Si and Fe. Based on the previous observations and on the analysis of the conditions for the coupling between the different processes operating in the formation of banded skarns, the qualitative models have been set forth to discuss the possible mechanism for the appearance of banding. The main mechanism is the dissolution-precipitation loop where coupling operates thanks to the aqueous species liberated or consumed by the dissolution and precipitation reactions. This is a positive feedback loop and an indirect auto-catalytic reaction; it creates a delay between the reaction and the transport, that gives rise to the pause of the activity of the loop, then its starting again when the transport fills the delay. The banded skarns are the result of the repetitive appearance of the loop due to the coupling between the reaction and transport. The stability analysis on a quantified model indicates that one necessary condition for the formation of the banded skarns is a high concentration of Si or Fe and a low concentration of Ca in the original fluid. Cette thèse se propose de discuter la formation des <b>alternances</b> récurrentes dans les skarns et la précipitation oscillante par métasomatose en contexte métamorphique. On commence par discuter deux types d'alternances de Rio Marina (Ile d'Elbe, Italie). Les directions des bandes sont parallèles à la zonation des skarns ou au contact entre le skarn et le calcaire. Les études géochimiques montrent que les skarns à <b>alternances</b> et les skarns ordinaires sont formés sur des calcaires massifs et homogènes et que la formation des skarns nécessite des apports importants de silice et de fer et de lessivages de calcium et de gaz carbonique. La comparaison des <b>alternances</b> de Rio Marina avec d'autres exemples d'alternances a permis d'énoncer les règles suivantes: (1). Les <b>alternances</b> apparaissent généralement sous 2 formes: des strates alternantes ou des structures orbiculaires. (2) Les épaisseurs des bandes varient de 0, 2 mm a 6 mm; les épaisseurs des bandes claires et des bandes sombres sont les mêmes dans la plupart des cas. (3) Dans les <b>alternances,</b> il y a au moins un minéral qui est constitué non seulement d'un élément provenant de la dissolution des carbonates comme Ca et Mg mais aussi d'un élément provenant du fluide comme Si et Fe. le deuxième minéral dans les <b>alternances</b> est compose essentiellement d'éléments provenant du fluide comme Si et Fe. La formation des bandes requiert le couplage de la précipitation des minéraux en <b>alternances</b> et de la dissolution de la roche carbonatée. Des modèles qualitatifs sont établis pour discuter le mécanisme possible d'apparition de ce type de structure spatiale...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a rare occurrence {{of a rich}} and diverse palynological assemblage from a controversial stratigraphic unit in well EW 8 in northwestern Saudi Arabia. The composition of this assemblage strongly suggests a Pridoli age and therefore it is referred here to the Tawil Formation. The assemblage encountered contains very characteristic chitinozoans, acritarchs, tasmanities, scolecodontsm, eurypterid cuticle and common land-derived miospores and hilate cryptospores. Chitinozoans such as Margachitina elegans, Ancyrochitina fragilis brevis, Ancyrochitina fragilis, Sphaerochitina sphaerocephala, Urnochitina urna, Pseudochlathrochitina carmenchui and Lagenochitina brevicollis confer the Pridoli age assignment. This assemblage of chitinozoans correlates very well with Assemblage D from the <b>Alternances</b> Gréso-Argileuses Formation of the A 1 - 61 well in northwestern Libya. Among the acritarchs present are: Cymbosphaeridium pilar, Leoniella carminae,Diexallophasis spp., Tunisphaeridium cf caudatum, Leiofusa estrecha and Eupoikilofusa striatifera. Furthermore, the join occurrence of U. urna, P. carmenchui and M. elegans is clearly indicative of the middle part of the Pridoli as in the Libyan well A 1 - 61, and in many wells in Algeria.

40|$|A new stratigraphic unit (named LM unit) {{located at}} the base of the Pliocene marine {{succession}} in the eastern sector of the Malaga Basin has been distinguished. This unit is composed of two fining-upward sequences bounded by a discontinuity related to synsedimentary tectonic activity. Both sequences are made up of basal alluvial deposits overlain by subaquatic deposits. The lower sequence contains rich mollusc faunas characterized by bivalves Lymnocardiinae and Dreissenidae of Paratethyan origin, and non-marine gastropods, typical of oligo-low mesohaline shallow waters, and low diversified ostracod faunas of Paratethyan origin (Loxocorniculina djafarovi, Tyrrhenocythere pontica, Euxinocythere (Maeotocythere) praebaquana and Amnicythere propinqua) typical of low mesohaline waters. <b>Alternances</b> of monospecific ostracod assemblages made of Cyprideis agrigentina or oligotypic assemblages made of C agrigentina and Loxoconcha spp. and richer assemblages made of L djafarovi accompanied by several Amnicythere spp. and Camptocypria sp. 1 characterize the upper sequence, pointing to more unstable environment affected by salinity and depth changes. Some samples collected from this upper sequence yielded rare, planktonic and benthic foraminifera, which could suggest the sporadic establishment of quasi-normal marine conditions in the westernmost Mediterranean during the deposition of this sequence. The palaeontological data and the palaeomagnetic results obtained in both the LM unit and the overlying Pliocene marine sediments restrict the age of the former to the post-evaporitic late Messinian. The age and the environmental conditions correlate these deposits with the Lago-Mare event occurring throughout the Mediterranean before the quick and widespread marine flooding of the Mediterranean at the beginning of the Pliocene.
