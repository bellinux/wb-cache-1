50|$|Meclizine is an {{antagonist}} at H1 receptors. It possesses anticholinergic, {{central nervous}} system depressant, and local anesthetic effects. Its antiemetic and <b>antivertigo</b> effects are not fully understood, but its central anticholinergic properties are partially responsible. The drug depresses labyrinth excitability and vestibular stimulation, and it may affect the medullary chemoreceptor trigger zone. Meclizine also is a dopamine antagonist at D1-like and D2-like receptors, but does not cause catalepsy in mice, perhaps because of its anticholinergic activity.|$|E
5000|$|Diphenidol is a muscarinic {{antagonist}} {{employed as}} an antiemetic {{and as an}} <b>antivertigo</b> agent. It is not marketed in the United States or Canada.- Although the mechanism of action of Diphenidol on the vestibular system {{has not yet been}} elucidated, it exerts an anticholinergic effect due to interactions with mACh receptors, particularly M1, M2, M3 and M4. Hence, its actions may take place at the vestibular nuclei, where a significant excitatory input is mediated by ACh receptors, and also at the vestibular periphery where mACh receptors are expressed at efferent synapses. Recently, a series of selective mACh-receptor antagonists based on the Diphenidol molecule has been synthesized, but they have not yet been the subject of clinical trials* [...]|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{aim of this}} double-blind, randomized, multicenter {{study was}} to compare the {{efficacy}} of betahistine dihydrochloride (BH) and flunarizine (FL) using the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI), a validated self-assessment questionnaire that has not previously been used in a clinical trial to evaluate <b>antivertigo</b> drugs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients with recurrent vertigo of peripheral vestibular origin and who were severely handicapped by vertigo were randomized to an 8 -week course of treatment with oral BH 48 mg daily or oral FL 10 mg daily. The efficacy endpoints were the total DHI score and the physical, functional and emotional subscores. RESULTS: Fifty-two patients completed the study. After 8 weeks of treatment the mean total DHI score and the physical subscore were significantly lower in the BH group compared to the FL group (7. 5 and 3. 6 points, respectively). The mean total DHI score {{as well as the}} three subscores decreased significantly after 4 and 8 weeks in both treatment groups. CONCLUSION: This study showed that at 8 weeks BH is significantly more effective than FL in terms of improving the total DHI score and the physical subscore. It was also established that the DHI is a useful and reliable method for evaluating the efficacy of <b>antivertigo</b> drug...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Dizziness can be {{characterized}} as a balance disorder that causes discomfort, leading to several functional limitations. Currently, vestibular rehabilitation has been highlighted as a possible treatment. Objective Analyze the effects of completing a vestibular rehabilitation treatment protocol on quality of life and postural balance in patients with vestibular complaints, as well as to compare these effects between the patients taking or not taking <b>antivertigo</b> drugs. Methods A nonrandomized controlled trial was performed with 20 patients previously diagnosed with vestibular diseases. Information regarding vertigo symptoms, quality of life as assessed through the Dizziness Handicap Inventory, visual analog scale of dizziness, and stabilometry using force platform was collected. Patients were treated for 12 weeks by a custom protocol. The sample was divided into two groups according to the use (medicated group, n[*]=[*] 9) or not (control group, n[*]=[*] 11) of <b>antivertigo</b> drugs. Results There was improvement in quality of life (p[*]<[*] 0. 001) and intensity of dizziness (p[*]=[*] 0. 003) with the intervention. An improvement of postural balance was observed through functional tests. However, no statistically significant difference was noted in stabilometry. When both groups were compared, no statistically significant differences between the variations of the variables analyzed were found in the re-evaluation session. Conclusion Quality of life and postural balance are improved with intervention. However, this improvement is not associated with pharmacologic treatment...|$|E
40|$|Many {{patients}} {{come with}} vertigo as their presenting symptom. They {{have been to}} physicians/neurologists/ENT specialists and have been fully investigated and treated symptomatically without any positive findings or relief. On detailed probing, these patients {{are found to be}} cases of depression-mostly of retarded variety. There is no specific age, sex, domicile or socioeconomic distribution of such cases The vertigo is of the classical rotational type and different from unsteadiness or dizziness. I put these cases on an antidepressant (usually imipramine), in addition to an <b>antivertigo</b> drug (meclizine or dimenhydrinate or cinnarizine). In fact, most of the patients are already on these drugs without having derived any benefit. With the addition of the antidepressant, there is a rapid and definite improvement in vertigo as well as depression. The <b>antivertigo</b> drug is gradually withdrawn and the antidepressant is continued. There is no recurrence of vertigo. In several cases, vertigo came back on stopping imipramine. All these strongly suggest that vertigo, in these cases, {{is a part of the}} overall symptomatology of depression. Although patients of vertigo (of organic origin) have been found to have a strong psycholo. gical component, along with an element of secondary gain (Kaplan etal., 1994), I could not find any mention of vertigo as a symptom of depression or of any primary psychiatric iilness for that matter. However, Srivastava (1998) has recently reported a case where deafness (of organic origin) and depression both responded to imipramine. These associations certainly deserve and need to be studied and reported upon...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Pharm. (Pharmacy Practice)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. One of {{the aims}} {{included}} in the United Nations Millennium Development Goals is to decrease {{the number of the}} world’s population without access to sanitation and water that is safe, by half by the year 2015. The use of water that is not safe for consumption leads to water–related diseases. For {{the purpose of this study}} gastro–intestinal disease was redefined as diseases of the gastro–intestinal tract caused by pathogens that spread via contaminated drinking water, poor sanitation and inadequate hygiene. Information obtained regarding the use of gastro–intestinal disease medication, may provide information about the prevalence of gastro–intestinal disease in South Africa. The general objective of this study was to determine the prescribing patterns of gastro–intestinal medication in different geographical areas in the private health care sector of South Africa. A retrospective drug utilisation review was conducted on data obtained from a medicine claims database of a pharmacy benefit management company for 2007 and 2008. A pharmacoepidemiological approach was followed in order to determine the prevalence of gastro–intestinal disease as well as the use of gastro–intestinal medication in South Africa as well as the different provinces of South Africa. The impact of water quality and sanitation on the prevalence of gastro–intestinal disease was also investigated. Gastro–intestinal medication (used in the treatment of gastro–intestinal disease) included the following pharmacological groups according to the MIMS®–classification: <b>antivertigo</b> and anti–emetic agents (group 1. 8), antispasmodics (group 12. 3), antidiarrhoeals (group 12. 7), minerals and electrolytes (group 20. 4, selected according to specified NAPPI–codes) and antimicrobials (group 18). Antimicrobials had to be prescribed in combination with one of the specified gastro–intestinal medication groups in order to be classified as a gastro–intestinal medication. In 2007 and 2008 respectively, 428864 and 340921 gastro–intestinal medication items were prescribed. The most frequently prescribed gastro–intestinal medication pharmacological groups in 2007 and 2008 were beta–lactam antimicrobials (with proportion percentages of 22. 77 % and 20. 85 % in 2007 and 2008 respectively), <b>antivertigo</b> and anti–emetic agents, antispasmodics, antidiarrhoeals and quinolone antimicrobials. Minerals and electrolytes represented only a small proportion (2. 99 % and 2. 56 % in 2007 and 2008 respectively) of the prescribed gastro–intestinal medication in South Africa. In the Free State and Western Cape <b>antivertigo</b> and anti–emetic agents were the most frequently prescribed gastro–intestinal medication items, while in other provinces beta–lactam antimicrobials ranked the highest. In all provinces except the Western Cape and the Northern Cape, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was the most frequently prescribed gastro–intestinal medication active ingredient. In the Western Cape loperamide was the most frequently prescribed active ingredient, while ciprofloxacin ranked highest as active ingredient in the Northern Cape in 2008. Based on the prescribing patterns of gastro–intestinal disease medications the treatment of gastro–intestinal disease in this section of the private health care sector of South Africa, does not fully comply with the Standard Treatment Guidelines with regard to the use of antimicrobials and electrolyte replacement therapy.

40|$|Abstract Background Histamine-related {{drugs are}} {{commonly}} used {{in the treatment of}} vertigo and related vestibular disorders. The site of action of these drugs however has not been elucidated yet. Recent works on amphibians showed that histamine H 3 receptor antagonists, e. g. betahistine, inhibit the afferent discharge recorded from the vestibular nerve. To assess the expression of H 3 histamine receptors in vestibular neurons, we performed mRNA RT-PCR and immunofluorescence experiments in mouse Scarpa's ganglia. Results RT-PCR analysis showed the presence of H 3 receptor mRNA in mouse ganglia tissue. H 3 protein expression was found in vestibular neurons characterized by large and roundish soma, which labeled for calretinin and calbindin. Conclusion The present results are consistent with calyx and dimorphic, but not bouton, afferent vestibular neurons expressing H 3 receptors. This study provides a molecular substrate for the effects of histamine-related <b>antivertigo</b> drugs acting on (or binding to) H 3 receptors, and suggest a potential target for the treatment of vestibular disorders of peripheral origin. </p...|$|E
40|$|Altogether, 78 mollusc {{species were}} {{recorded}} in the Hemže-Mýtkov Nature Reserve (East Bohemia, Czech Republic) during 2005 – 06. This locality harbours 32 % of the total mollusc fauna of the Czech Republic at only 29 ha. This fairly high species richness corresponds to a high habitat diversity and species pool of the region that consists of a mixture of Alpine and Carpathian elements. Of prime conservation importance is a high share of rare and endangered species and species mostly having an isolated population there from the main distribution range. These species are East-Alpine Aegopis verticillus, Cochlodina commutata and Itala ornata, and the East-Alpine-Carpathian Bythinella austriaca. Carpathian species represents Faustina faustina. Except mentioned species {{there are several other}} rare and sensitive species such as Daudebardia brevipes, Perpolita petronella, Platyla polita, Pupilla sterri, Vertigo alpestris, and Vertigo <b>antivertigo.</b> Although, forest species prevailed, there were also representatives of other ecological groups such as synanthropic, steppe, water, and wetland species...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{research of the}} floodplain mollusc communities of the Ploučnice River (Elbe tributary, North Bohemia, Czech Republic). Altogether, 66 mollusc species (65 species of gastropods, one species of bivalve) were recorded in the 35 floodplain forest sites during the research between 2007 and 2011, representing 27 % of the total Czech malacofauna. More than a half of all species represents the common forest species (52 % of all recorded species) with some rare woodland species as Aegopinella nitidula, Daudebardia rufa, Macrogastra ventricosa, Oxychilus depressus, O. glaber and two endangered species Clausilia bidentata and Daudebardia brevipes. Rare wetland species protected by the NATURA system Vertigo angustior and vulnerable V. <b>antivertigo</b> were also found.

40|$|Results of the {{faunistic}} {{survey on}} molluscs {{in the vicinity}} of the town of Blatná (south-western Bohemia, Czech Republic) are presented. This research was carried out in 2004 – 2007 at 28 sites complemented by other older unpublished records. Altogether 87 species (76 gastropods, 11 bivalves) have been recorded that the freshwater molluscs represented the most abundant ecological group in this region (about 40 % of all species recorded). However, the rare species (e. g. Aplexa hypnorum, Physa fontinalis, Pisidium obtusale) have been found usually in small water bodies while the majority of common freshwater molluscs was recorded predominantly in large and mid-sized ponds. The snail Gyraulus acronicus is the rarest freshwater species found only at one locality. Important proportion of investigated malacofauna consisted of wetland and floodplain species with rare elements such as Vertigo <b>antivertigo,</b> V. substriata, Euconulus praticola or even V. angustior, the former being protected in the whole Europe. Occurrence of this endangered species in the studied region represents one of the most important clusters of its populations in Bohemia.

40|$|The Bachureň Mts. are {{the least}} known {{orographic}} unit of Slovakia from the malacological point of view, therefore {{it was important to}} fill this gap in the faunistic research of malacofauna in Slovakia. In order to achieve the maximum mollusc diversity of the Bachureň Mts., various habitat types were the subject of interest. Field work was conducted in the years 2009 – 2011 at 78 sites. Altogether 108 mollusc species were recorded. In total, nearly 20 000 specimens were collected and identified. Half of all recorded species were representatives of woodland species s. l. From zoogeographical point of view, species with cosmopolitan, Euro-Siberian and Central European distribution made up the highest proportion. Carpathian species were numerous as well. Across the whole mountain, West Carpathian species (Petasina unidentata, Plicuteria lubomirskii and Trochulus villosulus) encountered the species with centre in eastern part of the Carpathians (Perforatella dibothrion, Pseudalinda stabilis, Oxychilus orientalis and Vestia gulo). On the basis of spatial distribution of sensitive species indicating undisturbance of habitats, the most valuable biotopes showed to be springs, wetlands and riparian vegetation along the upper parts of the streams with Acicula parcelineata, Bulgarica cana, Macrogastra latestriata, Vertigo angustior, V. <b>antivertigo,</b> V. substriata, and Cochlicopa nitens.

40|$|The Polabi lowland {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} agricultural areas in Central Europe. Since the Neolithic Age, agriculture has prevented full expansion of the mixed deciduous forest. We studied the succession of molluscan assemblages and/or fossil pollen in this area to answer the question as to how long the canopy forest could survive ongoing human impact. Environments suitable for the fossilization of these two fossil types differ, and the joint occurrence of both is rare. However, the 0. 75 m deep profile of alluvial loams and clays situated in the irregularly inundated floodplain area of the Dubanka stream yielded material rich in both mollusc shells and pollen. Very rich molluscan assemblages occur only in a 45 cm thick layer, which was dated using the AMS radiocarbon method to the Bronze Age (1796 - 1258 BC). The molluscan assemblages consist of continuously occurring rare deciduous woodland species (such as Discus perspectivus, Platyla polita, Cochlodina orthostoma, Ruthenica filograna) and species of relict wetlands (e. g. Perpolita petronella, Vertigo angustior, V. <b>antivertigo,</b> Vallonia enniensis). Pollen analyses also suggest the presence of wetland assemblages, with a huge proportion of alder in the central part of the succession followed by willow. The deciduous forests consist of elm (Ulmus), oak (Quercus), lime tree (Tilia), maple (Acer) and hazel (Corylus). Pollen grains of spruce (Picea), white fir (Abies) and beech (Fagus) confirm the late Holocene age of the profile. These results provide evidence of a woodland and wetland mosaic which still covered this landscape during the Bronze Age, in contrast with the present-day monotonous open lowland...|$|E
40|$|In a {{companion}} paper (Serafin et al. 1992) we have demonstrated in vitro that histamine depolarizes three previously described medial vestibular nucleus neuron (MVNn) types (Serafin et al. 1991 a, b). It {{has also been}} shown that this effect was exclusively mediated through postsynaptic H 2 receptors. All the same, the eventual contribution of presynaptic H 3 receptors to the physiological response of the MVNn to histamine remained an open question since, during the slicing procedure, any histaminergic axons projecting to the vestibular nuclei would have been interrupted. This rendered our study of H 3 -mediated effects of histamine difficult. Hence, in the present in vivo study our aim was three-fold: (1) to investigate the presence of H 3 receptors at the vestibular nuclei level; (2) to evaluate the functional importance of MVNn H 2 receptors; and (3) to explore whether H 3 ligands, when injected intraperitoneally (i. p.), could modulate dynamic vestibular functions. In order to address the first two questions, we investigated postural changes induced by perfusion of the guinea-pig's vestibular nuclear complex with specific ligands of the H 2 and H 3 receptors. Our data extend the conclusions of our in vitro study and suggest that lateral vestibular nuclei neurons and the MVNn are endowed with both H 2 and H 3 receptors. Our results indicate furthermore that histamine can modulate, quite effectively, static vestibular reflexes. Finally, the present study demonstrates that i. p. injection of thioperamide, an H 3 antagonist, induces a significant decrease in the horizontal vestibular-ocular reflex gain and, by contrast to most of the clinically used antihistaminics, has no detrimental effect on the alertness level. Our results may thus lead to clinical testing and use of H 3 antagonists as <b>antivertigo</b> or anti motion-sickness drugs...|$|E
40|$|Based {{on almost}} 80, 000 records for Ireland, 150 native species of non-marine mollusc are {{evaluated}} for their conservation status using International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) criteria (IUCN, 2001, 2003). Two {{are considered to}} be regionally extinct, five critically endangered, fourteen endangered, twenty-six vulnerable, six near threatened, and the rest of least concern, or data deficient. Ireland’s non-marine molluscan fauna is of international importance. Ten species have populations of significant international worth, having large proportions of their global population in Ireland. Ashfordia granulata and Leisotyla anglica are two examples of such species; both are near endemics to Britain and Ireland, with Ireland having at least a fifth of their global populations. Seven species have been listed on the global IUCN red list, for example Myxas glutinosa and Quickella arenaria, both of which are endangered species in Ireland. Six species are legally protected under European legislation. Of these legally protected species, only the Kerry slug, Geomalacus maculosus, is not considered threatened in Ireland. However, the Irish population of this species is of particular international importance as the species is restricted to south-west Ireland and northern Iberia, and the Iberian populations are severely threatened. Some species are rare in Ireland as they are at the edge of their range or climatic tolerances (e. g. Pomatias elegans). For species that are declining in Ireland there are multiple drivers of population loss. Species declines are primarily driven by habitat loss (e. g. loss of marginal agricultural wetlands through drainage impacting species such as Vertigo <b>antivertigo),</b> habitat change (e. g. reduced water quality impacting species such as Pisidium pseudosphaerium and Margaritifera margaritifera) and habitat management (e. g. woodland management practices impacting species such as Spermodea lamellata). To a lesser extent species may be declining due to climate change (e. g. Pisidium conventus, a cold, deep water, montane species) and the impact of invasive species (Anodonta cygnea and A. anatina, the swan and duck mussels, are being severely impacted by the invasive species Dreissena polymorpha, the zebra mussel). The importance of water quality and the reduction of habitat loss and change across a spectrum of habitats are identified as important components in conserving the non-marine molluscan fauna on the island of Ireland...|$|E
40|$|In 2013, {{the second}} year of the “Slak-in-Du” (Snails-in-Dunes) project, the Eastern part of the Belgian coast (UTM 10 x 10 km 2 squares ES 18, ES 28 and ES 29, and mainly the UTM square ES 28), has been further investigated. Apart from this also two other locations, named Schuddebeurze (at Middelkerke, in {{the central part of the}} Belgian coast, UTM square DS 86) and Calmeynbos (at De Panne, West Coast, UTM square DS 76) were investigated. The already quite {{interesting}} list of species observed at each of these two locations, will undoubtedly be further extended when they will be investigated in more detail in the coming years. At present a total of 81 different species of molluscs have already been observed within the project. The results obtained for the Belgian East Coast, which has been investigated quite intensively in 2012 and 2013, are very positive. A total of 80 different species of molluscs were observed, 40 of which were added in 2013. Noteworthy are the terrestrial snails Truncatellina cylindrica, Vertigo <b>antivertigo</b> and Vertigo pusilla, as well as the freshwater snail Aplexa hypnorum. Further, two very important species of brackish water molluscs have been observed, i. e. Auriculinella bidentata (in “Zwin Noord”) and Cerastoderma lamarcki (in the “Dievegat”). The observation of the brackish water cockle Cerastoderma lamarcki in the Dievegat, one of the very few locations where this in Belgium very threatened species still occurs, is of great importance. This certainly adds to the arguments against the planned disappearance of the Dievegat, a unique brackish water biotope and very important piece of nature. We therefore strongly suggest the Dievegat be maintained in its present state when the nature reserve “Het Zwin” will be extended in the coming years. The efficiency of {{the second year}} of the “Slak-in-Du” project was significantly higher than in 2012. This is due to the larger number of field trips and participants, the increased experience of the participants (training effect), de greater attention that was paid to slugs and freshwater molluscs, and the fact that this year soil samples were taken at all visited locations thereby assuring that the smallest species were not overlooked anymore. Even after two years of field work and study, seven species of land snails that have not been reported anymore at the Belgian East Coast since 1950, have also in this second year of the project not yet been observed. These are: Abida secale, Cecilioides acicula, Balea perversa, Monacha cartusiana, Helix itala itala, Candidula unifasciata and Arianta arbustorum. Further, Cernuella aginnica, a species that has frequently not been observed at the Belgian coast during the last about twenty years and may become endangered, has not been observed in 2013 (although in 2012 a single empty shell was found). All this requires for further detailed investigations. Finally, also the slugs, which have received already significantly more attention in 2013 in comparison to the previous year, still deserve to be searched for more actively during the field work. Nevertheless, after two years the “Slak-in-Du” project has been very successful and expectations have been entirely met already for the Belgian East Coast which has been the focus of the project till now. Indeed, in 2012 en 2013 a total of 32 species have been reported for the first time for one or more of the three UTM squares at the East Coast, nine of which are even reported for the very time for the entire East Coast. In addition, another 10 species have been reported for the first time since 1950. In 2014 and 2015 the project will concentrate mainly on the central part of the Belgian coast line...|$|E
