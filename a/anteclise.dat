40|$|Important {{executive}} {{decisions on}} {{oil and gas}} production stimulation in Eastern Siberia have been recently taken. There are unique and large fields of oil, gas, and gas-condensate in Eastern Siberia. The Talakan, Koyumbinskoye, Yurubcheno-Tahomskoye, Kovykta, Chayadinskoye fields are supposed to be developed first. It will result in an abrupt increase in environmental load on the nature of Eastern Siberia. In Eastern Siberia, the introduction of ecological imperatives in hydrocarbon production is still realistic. Underground water movement is the {{one of the most important}} factors of the ecosystems condition management. Oil and gas production is associated with the forced displacement of huge water masses, mixing waters of different composition, and origin that determines the extent of anthropogenic impact on water drive systems and their protective reaction. An extensive hydrogeological system of the depression type is identified in the pre-salt deposits here. Pressure relieve here is steady up to the basement. The decrease of the hydrodynamic potential towards the basement with such a gradient resulted in reformation of the fields in process of historical (geological) development of the Nepsko-Botuobinskaya <b>anteclise.</b> The depression hydrodynamic systems are characterized by extremely high isolation and can only exist under such closed conditions. A steady nature of water movement due to a strictly negative gradient of reservoir pressure makes it quite possible to use environmentally-harmful liquid substances instead of water. Disposal of the most hazardous wastes is the most expedient in the deposits of the crystalline basement in certain structures distant from oil and gas fields. The time period for storage of environmentally-harmful liquid substances may be calculated by means of the geological time scales ensuring their complete prevention from releasing into environment or air even during strong earthquakes. Disposal of wastes of chemical and nuclear industries is a matter of special consideration. The existing methods of storage and disposal of wastes are very expensive. The methods applied at the moment for storage of nuclear wastes at the depth of several meters, even in the most durable containers, constitute a potential danger. The enormous size of the depression system of the Nepsko-Botuobinskaya <b>anteclise</b> makes it possible to easily identify such objects at the depth below 1500 m where nuclear wastes will be stored indefinitely without any environmental impact. Thus, the water drive system of the Nepsko-Botuobinskaya <b>anteclise</b> is the ideal object for large-volume injection of environmentally harmful liquid substances even if there are large oil and gas accumulations in the subsurface. Specific geological and hydrodynamic conditions of the system allow the production of hydrocarbons from the subsurface simultaneously with the disposal of industrial wastes of oil and gas, mining, chemical, and nuclear industries without any environmental impact...|$|E

40|$|Lithuanian’s {{territory}} {{with regard}} to its geology and tectonics belongs to {{the western edge of}} the Precambrian East European platform. The sedimentary formations (from Vendian upto Quaternary) lie ontop of the Precambrian basement rocks. According to the depth of basement three large tectonic structures are determined in the territory of Lithuania: the Baltic Syneclise (Craton) and its slope, the Mosurian-Belarusian <b>Anteclise,</b> and the Latvian Saddle. Research of geothermal energy started in 1988. First of all (since year 1994) the shallow geothermal resources have been used in developing individual heating systems with heat pumps. The geothermal resources up to 100 meters depth are very attractive. It is very easy to use: they are spread everywhere and are renewable. The main deep-hydrothermal resources are related to aquifers of regional Cambrian and Devonian. Usage of geothermal resources from Devonian for the centralize heating started at 2000. The first geothermal demonstration plant in Lithuania was built in Klaipeda. The total capacity is 41 MW. Two production and two injection wells were drilled. The geothermal water (38 oC and salinity ~ 98 g/litre) is pumped from 1100 m depth. Petrothermal resources are related to the Hot Dry Rocks (the temperature is 150 - 180 oC at the depth 4 - 5 km).

40|$|Energy {{security}} {{is provided by}} the minimum required ratio of domestic and imported energy resources. Therefore, in the energy sector energy efficiency should be increased through the use of its own energy resources. Over the last hundred years of development of geological science a preferential distribution of oil and gas fields to areas (blocks) of geological faults, many of which reach the surface of the foundation of our planet, has been determined. The complex process of oil and gas formation is predetermined by geological, geochemical, hydrogeological and other factors. The concepts of organic and inorganic origin of oil and gas are also relevant in the context under consideration.  The formation of sufficient oil and gas fields is possible in the presence of highly porous and fractured rocks (for oil) or so-called gas traps. Promising for the discovery of sufficient oil and gas fields are the central and southern areas of the Pripyat trough and the areas on the borders Mikashevichsi-Zhitkovichi ledge. The geological conditions of the areas in the Southern part of the Podlaska-Brest and the North-Eastern part of the Orsha troughs require most thorough investigations. In the area of the Belarusian <b>anteclise,</b> especially near the Baltic syneclise, at great depths in porous rocks the presence of oil and gas deposits of inorganic origin is possible. The use of plasma-pulse impact (that is a very effective one) on the oil and gas underground reservoirs requires a study of the feasibility of their use in new and existing waste deposits. In the exploration of minerals such “exotic” methods, as the assessment of the discharge of helium, radon, radioactive analysis, etc. should also be applied. It is necessary to detect a possible fault zones and prospective search of hydrocarbon energy resources. To ensure energy security of Belarus, the evaluation of the possibility of using associated gas to supply with it {{a significant part of the}} country should be fulfilled. The reputed natural deposits of hydrocarbons in the near future will allow us to achieve energy security of the Republic of Belarus in the near future. </p...|$|E
40|$|The Kursk Magnetic Anomaly (KMA) of Russia (51 deg north, 37 deg east) {{has long}} been {{recognized}} as one of the largest magnetic anomalies on Earth. It is associated with the massive iron-ore formations of this region, however, model studies have revealed that the relationship between the two is not obvious. In an early effort to demonstrate the validity of Magsat data for crustal research a detailed study of the KMA, at an average altitude of 350 km and the surrounding region was made. They recorded a 27 nT high and a - 9 nT low giving a 37 nT peak-to-trough anomaly over the immediate area of the KMA. Despite the much higher altitude of Orsted (620 to 850 km) we revisited the KMA to determine if this mission would also be able to record an associated anomalous crustal signature. The Orsted profiles we selected were from April to August 1999. From these data we chose those with an altitude range of 644 to 700 km and they were subsequently gridded, by least-squares collocation, to a mean elevation of 660 km. Both ascending and descending data were examined and signals common to both were extracted and averaged. A correlation coefficient between these two orbit orientations of 0. 82 was computed. The quadrant-swapping method of Kim et al. was applied. Removal of the main geomagnetic field was accomplished with a polynomial fitting procedure. A positive anomaly of > 2. 5 nT with ari associated negative of 3 nT peak-to-trough range were computed. These Magsat and Orsted results are consistent with the decay of a dipole field over the studied altitude range. Significant differences between these two anomaly fields are due to the greater number of orbit profiles and therefore greater number of intersecting orbits (ascending and descending) available in the Orsted compilation. Of the four largest amplitude anomalies in the Orsted field three are present in the Magsat map. The fourth (> 2. 5 nT), however, is associated with the Belorussian-Lithuanian <b>anteclise.</b> This sugaests that additional geologic information may be apparent in the new Orsted field...|$|E
40|$|Tyt. z nagłówka. Bibliogr. s. 502. Correlation and {{comparison}} of the Jurassic deposits of Republic of Belarus, Republic of Lithuania and Kaliningrad region of the Russian Federation transboundary region is an important time milepost in studying of a paleogeographical situation of {{the western part of}} the East European Platform. The geologist Ullman began to study Jurassic deposits of the Republic of Lithuania in 1830 s (Grigyalis 1958). He investigated river Venta in the town of Papilany. For the first time, geologist A. E. Gedroyts conducted research of the Jurassic deposits in the territory of Belarus. He found erratic boulders in the Białowieża forest at the beginning 1880 s (Mityanina 1982). Correlations of the Jurassic deposits were repeatedly undertaken in this region. In 1922, N. F. Bliodukho discussed the similarity between "Western" and "Russian" Jurassic on basis of the mollusk analogies. The second attempt was made within the project of UNESCO No. 86 of the International program of geological correlation The East European Platform (southwest region) only in 1985. Correlations were carried out within the project "Peritetis". The newest research of the Jurassic deposits of Belarus revealed the series of paleogeographical and sedimentological features (Makhnach 2011). This research revealed, a glacial exaration of the Jurassic deposits from Grodno (Republic of Belarus), Druskininkay and Premay (Republic of Lithuania) as a distinctive feature of the Lithuanian-Polish Monocline. The considered transboundary region includes (from the North to the South) following tectonic structures: Baltic Syneclise, western slope of the Latvian Saddle, Mazursko-Belorusskaja <b>Anteclise</b> and Podlyassko-Brestsky Hollow. Desrciptions and paleontological material from stratigraphic wells, which encountered Jurassic deposits were used as a research material. Data from following wells were used: stratigraphic wells Gvardeyskaja- 57 and Bely Yar- 1 for the Kaliningrad region, Yoty's stratigraphic well for the Republic of Lithuania, stratigraphic wells Vysokoe- 77 and Brest- 52 for the territory of Belarus. The correlation of regional data {{and comparison}} of paleogeographical events showed that the most complete section of the Jurassic deposits for this area is located in the territory of the Kaliningrad region - a stratigraphic well Gvardeyskaja 57. For the territory of Belarus, the most complete section of Oxfordian is presented in the stratigraphic well Vysokoe- 77, and Callovian deposits are best represented in the stratigraphic well Brest- 52. Paleogeographical reconstruction shows that the sea was absent in the territory of Belarus, but the plentiful river network drained the Polesye Saddle through the Svislochsky snap in Early Callovian. Lowland with wetlands existed in Early Callovian during the beginning of transgression in the transboundary region of Lithuania, Belarus and the Kaliningrad region. The maximum transgression from the Polish Sea occurred during the Kosmo-ceras jason time (Middle Callovian). At this time, connection through the Pripyat Passage and through the southern passage systems with the Central Russian Sea was established. The second maximum transgression in this region happened during the Quenstedtoceras maria time (Early Oxfordian), and the communication with the Central Russian Sea was reestablished in the period of Cardioceras cordatum (Early Oxfordian). Completeness of Middle and Upper Oxfordian cuts from the territory of Belarus isn't clear and requires further paleontological research. Lithological differences and time of sediment accumulation reveal different sedimentation conditions. This fact indicates various movement directions of tectonic structures. It should be noted that unidirectional movements (immersion) effected all tectonic structures during the maximum sea transgressions. Differences in regions, where Jurassic sediments were deposited, were also studied. In the second half of Late Callovian, the Podlyassko-Brestsky Hollow underwent immersion and a flexure towards the Stryysky Deflection while Mazursko-Belorussky <b>Anteclise</b> was under conditions of tectonic rest. During Cardioceras cordatum time (Early Oxfordian), the submerging of Pripyat passage northern part was amplified. Most likely, the Polish Sea started to recede from the major part of the territory of Belarus during Middle Oxfordian, marking a new land stage of the territory. The buckling of the Latvian Saddle towards the Baltic Syneclise was observed within the territory of Lithuania. Paleontological data are also interesting. Existence of coral reeves in the territory of Lithuania (Grigyalis 1958) testifies the prevalence of northwest currents from Peritetis areas, and also does not reject the hypothesis about the Northern (Baltiyskii) Passage connecting the Polish and Central Russian seas. Biota features indicate the existence of benthonic currents in Late Callovian and difficult fauna exchange between Lithuanian and Belarusian regions. Dostępny również w formie drukowanej.

40|$|This PhD study aims {{to exploit}} the rich archive {{provided}} by the Miocene mollusc fauna of the Pebas Formation and other inland Miocene Amazonian formations to reconstruct landscape evolution and biotic development in lowland Amazonia during the Neogene. Over 160 samples from more than 70 Pebas Formation outcrops mostly collected by the author were processed for this study. Additional samples were collected in Andean areas of Colombia and Venezuela and further material from other northwestern South American basins was studied in museums. Pebas Formation samples and well log data made available by Occidental Peru from three wells in the Marañon Basin in Peru were also investigated. During this study four genera and 74 species from the Pebas Formation have been described and a further 13 species have been introduced in open nomenclature, and several species were reported for the first time. The number of mollusc species attributed to the Pebas fauna has increased from around 50 to 156. The Pebas fauna is characterised as aquatic, endemic and extinct, and is a typical representative of a long-lived lake fauna. Fluvial taxa are not common, (marginal) marine taxa are rare. An additional molluscan fauna from the Miocene Solimões Formation of Brazil, containing 13 fresh water species was also described. The newly documented fauna was used to improve biostratigraphic framework of Miocene Amazonian deposits. Twelve mollusc zones were introduced, the upper eleven of which cover a time interval of approximately seven million years covered previously by only three pollen zones. An age model calculated for the borehole data indicates that the Pebas Formation was deposited between c. 24 and 11 Ma. The areal distribution of the outcropping mollusc zones uncovered a broad dome structure, termed here the Iquitos-Araracuara <b>anteclise</b> in the study area. The structure appears to have influenced river courses and also contributed to edaphic heterogeneity {{that may have been}} in part responsible for the current high biodiversity in the study area. The Pebas system was a huge system (> one million km 2) dominated by relatively shallow lakes, but also containing swamps and rivers. The system was fed by rivers draining the emergent Andes in the west and lowlands and cratons to the east. The Pebas system was located at sea level and was open to marine settings through a northern portal running through the Llanos Basin and East Venezuela Basin towards the Caribbean. Cyclical baselevel changes possibly related to Mylankhovitch cycles, have been documented in depositional sequences of the Pebas Formation. The composition of the Pebasian mollusc fauna implies that the system was mostly a fresh water system. Such an interpretation is matched by strontium isotope ratios as well as very negative d 18 O ratios found in the shells, but is at odds with oligohaline and mesohaline ichnofacies found in the same strata. The mollusc fauna of the Pebas Formation diversified through most of the existence of the lake system. The diversification was mostly the result of in-situ cladogenesis. The success of some of the Pebasian endemic clades is explained by adaptation to fresh water, low oxygen, common unconsolidated lake bottoms (soup grounds) as well as high predation intensity. Maximum diversity was reached {{at the base of the}} late Middle to early Late Miocene Grimsdalea pollen zone, some 13 Ma. At the time some 85 species co-occurred, 67 of which are considered as Pebasian endemics. A subsequent drop in species richness coincides with indications of elevated salinities, although a causal relation still needs to be established. Apparently the Pebas fauna went (almost) entirely extinct with the replacement of the lake system into a fluvio-tidal system during the Early Late Miocene, some 11 Ma...|$|E
