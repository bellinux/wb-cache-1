50|$|The games {{depict the}} history of the fictional fantasy world of Tyria; each {{campaign}} focuses on events in disjointed sections of the world at roughly the same time. A player creates an avatar to play through the cooperative storyline of a campaign, taking on the role of a hero who must save Tyria from episode-specific antagonists. Players can group with other players and non-player characters, known as henchmen and heroes, to perform missions and quests found throughout the game-world. PvP combat is consensual, team based, and limited to areas designed for such combat. Players are allowed to create characters <b>at</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>level</b> and with the best equipment specifically for PvP play, which is unusual for MMORPGs.

Play past the level cap usually provides rewards in the form of tokens and specific in game currencies that contribute to rarer and often visually superior cosmetic items for player avatars compared to the most easily acquired sets. The focus in these late game areas is therefore usually aimed at effective teamwork and how the players approach a problem as opposed to the degree of statistics acquired by playtime.|$|E

The round ends once the ball {{at the opposite end of}} the Newton's cradle stops passing through a red laser line. There are four categories, and each member must play one category each.

5000|$|For example, {{alignment}} {{level is}} commonly 0 dBu (Equal to 0.775 Volts RMS) in broadcast chains and in professional audio what is {{commonly known as}} [...] "0VU", which is +4dBu (Equal to 1.227 Volts RMS) in places where the signal exists as analogue voltage. Under normal situations the [...] "0VU" [...] reference allowed for a headroom of 18dB or more above the reference level without significant distortion. This is largely due to the use of slow responding VU meters in almost all analog professional audio equipment which, by their design, and by specification responded to an average level, not peak levels. It most commonly is at −18 dB FS (18 dB below full scale digital) on digital recordings for programme exchange, in accordance with EBU recommendations. Digital equipment must use peak reading metering systems to avoid severe digital distortion caused by the signal going beyond 'full scale' or maximum digital levels. 24-bit original or master recordings commonly have alignment level at −24 dB FS to allow extra headroom, which can then be reduced to match the available headroom of the final medium by audio level compression. FM broadcasts usually have only 9 dB of headroom as recommended by the EBU, but digital broadcasts, which could operate with 18dB of headroom, given their low noise floor even in difficult reception areas, currently operate in a state of confusion, with some transmitting <b>at</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>level</b> while others operate at much lower level even though they carry material that has been compressed for compatibility with the lower dynamic range of FM transmissions.|$|E

The article notes that Mystra is a manifestation of the Cosmic Balance, [...] "the natural workings of the multiverse ... a “Great Mystery” ... or a known higher force", and states that as such she [...] "appears to right great inequalities or goings-awry in the magical balance of things.

Mystra was made lawful neutral on the premise that magic is inherently neutral, and exhibits internal order and laws. Many mages believe that Mystra determines success in the creation of new spells, potions, and magic items." [...] Mystras role in the cosmology of the Forgotten Realms is detailed: [...] "Azuth serves Mystra.

Objective: 1) To examine the distribution of behavioural hearing thresholds in a group of children who had shown no click-evoked auditory brain stem response (ABR) <b>at</b> <b>maximum</b> presentation <b>levels.</b> 2) To describe the relationship between the 90 Hz steady-state evoked potential (SSEP) and behavioural thresholds in these subjects. Design: A retrospective study based on clinical findings obtained from 108 infants and young children. Each of these children had shown no recordable ABR to clicks presented <b>at</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>levels</b> (100 dB nHL). SSEP audiograms were obtained using AM/FM tones at the octave frequencies 250 to 4000 Hz. The results of these evoked potential assessments were compared with hearing thresholds established behaviourally. Results: Click-ABR assessment could not differentiate between the subjects in our sample with total hearing losses and those with useful residual hearing. Although some of the ears were anacusic, more than a quarter showed residual hearing ate each of the audiometric frequencies. Furthermore, at least 10 % of the behavioural thresholds at each frequency fell within the moderate/severe hearing loss range. A far closer relationship was observed between SSEP and hearing thresholds. On occasions where the SSEP was absent <b>at</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>levels,</b> 99. 5 % of the ears showed either a total loss or a behavioural threshold within 10 dB of that level. When an SSEP was obtained, the hearing threshold was typically within 5 dB of the SSEP threshold. Conclusion: The results suggested that in our group of selected subjects, the SSEP technique was able to assess ears with only minimal amounts of residual hearing. Where the brevity of the acoustic click limits both its frequency specificity and its presentation level, the modulated tones used for SSEP testing allow accurate, frequency-specific assessment at high presentation levels.
