5|$|Game Revolution {{said the}} {{multiplayer}} feature {{was a revelation}} <b>and</b> <b>worth</b> {{the cost of the}} game alone. Computer Games said it was innovative and may serve as an inspiration for future games. PC Gamer said the multiplayer mode was the redeeming factor of the game, though it was still marred by bugs. Others noted that aspects of the multiplayer interface were insufficient, such as the inability to store custom dialog, requiring the Storyteller to type text in real time during gameplay.|$|E

5|$|A {{monument}} to Ion Heliade Rădulescu, sculpted by the Italian artist Ettore Ferrari, {{stands in front}} of the University building in central Bucharest. In addition to naming a lecture room after him, the Romanian Academy has instituted the Ion Heliade Rădulescu Award—in 1880, it was awarded to Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu, for his Cuvinte den bătrâni, <b>and</b> <b>worth</b> 5,000 gold lei. Ten years after, the prize was the center of a scandal, involving on one side the dramatist Ion Luca Caragiale and, on the other, the cultural establishment formed around members of the National Liberal Party, including Hasdeu and Dimitrie Sturdza. The latter disapproved of Caragiale's anti-Liberal stance and his association with Junimea, as well as to his anti-nationalism, dislike of didacticism, and alleged cosmopolitanism. They thus refused to grant him the prize.|$|E
5|$|Although Mold {{appeared}} for the North {{against the}} Australians, who toured again in 1896, {{he did not}} play any Tests or other representative cricket that year and his wicket total fell to 150 at 18.12; after this season, his bowling began to decline in effectiveness. Suffering frequently from injury in 1897, Mold failed to reach 100 wickets in the season for the first time. His 90 wickets in 1898 were taken at an average over 20, the only time his bowling average was so high, and he missed three {{weeks of the season}} owing to injury. After improving his record to 115 wickets at 18.68 during 1899, he was awarded a benefit match by Lancashire during 1900 which raised £2,050, a record total at the time <b>and</b> <b>worth</b> around £173,000 in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the mid-1930s, Orizaba {{often carried}} {{gold and silver}} bars from Veracruz to New York for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Chase National Bank, or for later {{transshipment}} to London. In October 1933 three short tons (2.7tonnes) of gold bars and coins were shipped on Orizaba for eventual delivery to London, prompting some to believe that gold was being smuggled into Mexico {{to take advantage of}} its policy of not charging duties on gold. In July 1934 Orizaba brought in 16cases of Mexican gold, and in January 1935, 20cases; in both instances, for delivery to Chase National Bank. Twice in 1935, the Ward liner delivered over 1,000bars of silver for the Federal Reserve Bank, bringing 1,390bars in March, and 1,933bars in July. Mexico was not the only place from which Orizaba delivered precious metals. In March 1934, she delivered 12cases of gold—consisting of 84 bars, <b>and</b> <b>worth</b> $1,624,000—from Havana for Chase.|$|E

5|$|Brandenburg and {{her three}} sisters served {{in a wide range}} of roles. In 1900, the four ships were {{deployed}} to China during the Boxer Rebellion, after which they were substantially modernized. In 1910, two of the ships, Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm and Weissenburg, were sold to the Ottoman Navy. Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm was sunk in 1915 by a British submarine while Weissenburg survived the war, only to be broken up in 1938. Brandenburg <b>and</b> <b>Wörth</b> saw limited service during World War I as coastal defense ships before they were withdrawn for auxiliary duties. Both ships were sold for scrapping in May 1919.|$|E
5|$|Sheinberg {{also learned}} of a {{licensing}} agreement between Nintendo and Coleco, {{a producer of}} home video game consoles. Sheinberg scheduled a meeting with Coleco president Arnold Greenberg on April 27, 1982, ostensibly to discuss possible investment in Coleco. Instead, Universal admonished Greenberg for copyright infringement and threatened to sue if the ColecoVision shipped with Donkey Kong as planned. The next day, Universal telexed Coleco and Nintendo giving them 48 hours to cease marketing Donkey Kong, to dispose of all Donkey Kong inventory, and to hand over all records of profits made from the game. On May 5, Greenberg agreed to pay Universal royalties of 3% of Donkey Kongs net sale price, amounting to six million units <b>and</b> <b>worth</b> about $4.6 million. A week later, he signed an agreement that stated that Universal would not sue Coleco as long as Coleco paid royalties.|$|E
5|$|The Brandenburg-class {{ships were}} the first ocean-going battleships built for the German navy, and marked the {{beginning}} of German naval expansion. Previous classes included several types of ironclad ships, including coastal defense ships and armored frigates. The ships were unique for the time in that they were armed with six large-caliber guns instead of four, as was standard on contemporary ships in other navies. The class comprised four ships: Brandenburg, Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm, Weissenburg, <b>and</b> <b>Wörth.</b> Of the four ships, Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm and Weissenburg were more advanced, in that their armor was composed of higher quality steel.|$|E

On December 4, 2008, Abelardo Saavedra, the HISD superintendent at the time, shelve plans of Carnegie <b>and</b> <b>Worthing</b> sharing cafeterias since the proposal had insufficient support from the board of trustees.|$|R
5|$|The Brandenburg-class {{ships were}} the {{foundation}} of what eventually became the High Seas Fleet. As they represented {{a shift in the}} strategic outlook of the German navy, the traditional method of ship construction, which relied heavily on foreign models, was abandoned. Some experimentation was implemented in the design process, particularly in the armor types that were installed on the ships. Brandenburg <b>and</b> <b>Wörth</b> were equipped with compound armor that consisted of several layers of different materials, while the latter two ships received Harvey nickel-steel alloy armor plating. The addition of a third main battery turret was also a significant innovation. While a novel concept, the midships turret caused prohibitive blast damage to the surrounding superstructure when fired, which led to the idea being abandoned. This arrangement has led some authors to characterize the ships as proto-dreadnoughts. This is incorrect, as the guns were not of the same length, and the ships were designed to fight at close range, unlike the later dreadnought battleships.|$|E
5|$|The Space Interferometry Mission {{began as}} a four-month {{preliminary}} architecture study in March 1997. NASA selected TRW's Space & Electronics Group, Eastman Kodak and Hughes Danbury Optical Systems to conduct the study. In 1998, TRW Inc. {{was selected as the}} contractor for the SIM Lite project; Northrup Grumman acquired part of TRW in 2002 and took over the contract. Also selected was Lockheed Martin Missiles and Space located in Sunnyvale, California. The two contracts, which included the mission formulation and implementation phases, were announced in September 1998 <b>and</b> <b>worth</b> a total of over US$200million. The formulation phase of the mission included initial mission design and planning for the full scale implementation of the mission. At the time of the NASA announcement, launch was scheduled for 2005 and the mission was part of the Origins Program, a series of missions designed to answer questions such as the origin of life Earth.|$|E
5|$|The four {{ships were}} {{commissioned}} into the I Battle Squadron. They saw overseas service during the Boxer Rebellion in China in 1900–01 {{under the command}} of Marshal Alfred von Waldersee. Following the return from China, the Brandenburgs were taken into drydock for modernization, which lasted from 1901 to 1905 depending on the ship. During the reconstruction the superstructure was cut down, a second conning tower was added, and the steam boilers were replaced with newer models. Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm and Weissenburg were sold to the Ottoman Empire in 1910 and renamed Barbaros Hayreddin and Turgut Reis, respectively. Brandenburg <b>and</b> <b>Wörth</b> were decommissioned and placed into reserve. At the start of World War I, both ships were recalled to active service as coastal defense ships, but due to their age they were quickly demobilized. They spent the remainder of the war as barracks ships before being broken up in 1920.|$|E

5|$|Weissenburg and Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm were armored with {{nickel steel}} Krupp armor, {{but due to}} {{delivery}} problems, Brandenburg <b>and</b> <b>Wörth</b> were armored with a composite armor. The composite armor was constructed by layering steel-clad wrought iron plates and wood planks, which was backed by two more layers of sheet iron. Krupp's nickel steel armor {{was based on the}} Harvey process, which enriched the upper layers of the steel with carbon. This type of armor produced greater strength with thinner armor belts, which enabled ships equipped with it to carry more complete protection. Some portions of Brandenburg did receive the new Krupp armor, including the barbettes that held the fore and center main battery turrets. All four ships retained teak backing to their armor belts.|$|E
5|$|Wörth {{served in}} the German fleet for {{the first decade of}} her career, {{participating}} in the normal peacetime routine of training cruises and exercises. She took part in the German naval expedition to China in 1900 to suppress the Boxer Rebellion, though by the time the fleet arrived the siege of Peking had already been lifted, <b>and</b> <b>Wörth</b> saw little direct action in China. She was placed in reserve in 1906 as newer, more powerful vessels had supplanted the Brandenburg class as front-line battleships. Obsolete by the start of World War I, Wörth and Brandenburg served in a limited capacity in the Imperial German Navy as coastal defense ships for {{the first two years of}} the war, though they did not see action. By 1916, Wörth was reduced to a barracks ship, a role in which she served until the end of hostilities. Despite plans to convert her into a freighter after the war, Wörth was scrapped in the port of Danzig in 1919.|$|E
