5|$|The Behar {{survivors}} were maltreated {{by members}} of Tones crew. Japanese sailors forced the survivors to hand over all their personal belongings of <b>any</b> <b>value,</b> and then used ropes to tie the survivors in painful positions which caused them to have difficultly breathing. The merchant ship's chief officer was beaten after he complained that treating civilians {{in such a way}} violated the Geneva Convention. However, the female survivors later had their ropes removed. When the survivors were taken below decks to be imprisoned they were badly beaten by Japanese sailors.|$|E
5|$|A 2010 {{study of}} the stream found that the Fonteyn Kill's {{specific}} conductance, {{a measure of the}} amount of dissolved road salt in the stream's water, was nearly 1.0 mS/cm, higher than <b>any</b> <b>value</b> recorded in the Casperkill. Sites upstream of Vassar Lake were recorded in a separate study as having specific conductances twice as high as locations downstream of the lake, suggesting a regulating effect caused by water mixing and retention in Vassar Lake. The total inorganic nitrogen in the kill, which is usually correlated with surrounding green cover, was about , average for measurements taken in the Fonteyn Kill and Casperkill in that study. The study also found that the Fonteyn Kill's score on the Hilsenhoff family biotic index (HBI), a scale measuring pollution based on the tolerance of endemic benthic macroinvertebrates, was approximately six, indicating fairly poor water quality, with scores {{for the rest of the}} Casperkill–Fonteyn Kill watershed were as high as seven (poor water quality) to as low as four (very good water quality).|$|E
5|$|Although it {{remained}} armed, Deal was adapted by Sir John Norris and Lord Carrington during the 18th and 19th centuries {{to form a}} more suitable private house for the castle's captain, which was by now an honorary position. In 1904, the War Office concluded that the castle no longer had <b>any</b> <b>value</b> either as a defensive site or as a barracks, and it was {{opened to the public}} when the captain was not in residence. Early in the Second World War, the captain's quarters were destroyed by German bombing, forcing Deal's captain, William Birdwood, to move to Hampton Court Palace, and the castle became an observation post for an artillery battery placed along the shore line. The castle was not brought back into use as a residence and was restored by the government during the 1950s to form a tourist attraction. In the 21st century, Deal Castle is operated by English Heritage, receiving 25,256 visitors in 2008.|$|E

5|$|Deal Castle was {{increasingly}} resembling a private house, rather than purely a fortification, and {{this led to}} arguments in 1829 {{as to whether it}} should be subject to local taxation as a private dwelling, or continue to be exempt as a military site. The captaincy had long since become an honorary position, given out as a reward by the Crown. In 1898, the War Office agreed that the Office of Works should be consulted over any external alterations to the historic castle, and that the Office of Works would be responsible for paying for any resulting work. The War Office finally concluded in 1904 that the castle no longer had <b>any</b> <b>value</b> either as a defence or as a barracks, and transferred it entirely to the Office of Works. When the captain was not in residence it was opened to visitors.|$|E
5|$|In the end, Emir Habibullah {{returned}} to his vacillating inactivity. He was aware the mission had found support within his council and had excited his volatile subjects. Four days after the draft treaty was signed, Habibullah called for a durbar, a grand meeting where a jihad {{was expected to be}} called. Instead, Habibullah reaffirmed his neutrality, explaining that the war's outcome was still unpredictable and that he stood for national unity. Throughout the spring of 1916, he continuously deflected the mission's overtures and gradually increased the stakes, demanding that India rise in revolution before he began his campaign. It was clear to Habibullah that for the treaty to hold <b>any</b> <b>value,</b> it required the Kaiser's signature, and that for Germany to even attempt to honour the treaty, she would have to be in a strong position in the war. It was a good insurance policy for Habibullah.|$|E
5|$|Integer sorting {{algorithms}} {{are usually}} {{designed to work}} in either the pointer machine or random access machine models of computing. The main {{difference between these two}} models is in how memory may be addressed. The random access machine allows <b>any</b> <b>value</b> that is stored in a register to be used as the address of memory read and write operations, with unit cost per operation. This ability allows certain complex operations on data to be implemented quickly using table lookups. In contrast, in the pointer machine model, read and write operations use addresses stored in pointers, and it is not allowed to perform arithmetic operations on these pointers. In both models, data values may be added, and bitwise Boolean operations and binary shift operations may typically also be performed on them, in unit time per operation. Different integer sorting algorithms make different assumptions, however, about whether integer multiplication is also allowed as a unit-time operation. Other more specialized models of computation such as the parallel random access machine have also been considered.|$|E

5|$|Standard cards can be {{purchased}} at vending machines within all Metrorail stations, at Metro sales offices, selected retail stores, and online. The purchase price includes $2 for the card itself plus an initial fare value, which varies depending on where they are purchased: cards purchased at stations cost $10 ($2 for the card and $8 fare value), while those purchased online cost either $10 or $30 ($2 for the card and $8 or $28 fare value). The cards can be reloaded using farecard vending machines or using cash at fareboxes onboard buses. Until 2016, riders could also add value to their SmarTrip cards by trading in paper farecards (a used farecard up to $20, or an unused farecard of <b>any</b> <b>value).</b> There is a difference between SmarTrip and CharmCard on the maximum value that can be stored on the card. SmarTrip can store up to $300 in value, while CharmCard can store up to $200.|$|E
