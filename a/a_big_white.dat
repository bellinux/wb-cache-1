[...] Moore established a commune that he called the [...] "Humanity Trust" [...] in [...] "Heaven City." [...] Moore faced further legal troubles in 1925 when a 50-year-old follower died following a boxing match with a 15-year-old girl with whom he was having an affair. [...] Though Moore was exonerated of any wrongdoing, the Chicago Tribune published {{a report on the}} commune in June 1925, describing the facility as a [...] "drab farm with one main dwelling, and <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>white</b> barn" [...] where ten families live, work, study, play and practice [...] "a strange communism." [...] The Tribune reported that the inhabitants of the commune included [...] "Mrs. Shirley Talcott and her three children." ...|$|E
2500|$|A more long-running romantic pairing was {{featured}} between Mel {{and the character}} Steve Owen (Martin Kemp), who was portrayed as a villain. It was an on/off romance beginning shortly after both characters' introduction in 1998. In an interview in June 2000, Kemp discussed the relationship between Steve and Mel: [...] "Steve's convinced Mel will make his life complete. She kept him going during all the bad times and now he's determined to have her. It's true {{of a lot of}} guys who get into trouble, they hang their hat on one idea and that keeps them sane [...] there's a driving force that kept them going while they were [...] And often that's a woman. You know from those tender moments when Mel came to visit Steve [...] that she was the thing that kept him going, and he won't stop til he gets her back." [...] Eventually the couple were shown to marry in the soap in March 2001, despite a revelation that Mel had strayed with Steve's nemesis Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). Tamzin Outhwaite explained, [...] "With Ian, Mel was the one who didn't want to go through with it. This time around Mel is the one who is apprehensive, hoping Steve will be there for her. If he isn't, she has no reason to stay in Walford. This really is make or break time for her." [...] The wedding night was a precursor to one of the soap's most publicised storylines, Who Shot Phil?, where Phil was gunned down by an unknown assailant and, due to Mel's infifelity, Steve became one of the prime suspects for the murder attempt, though he transpired to be a red herring. Discussing Mel and Steve's wedding, Outhwaite said, [...] "Even though this wedding with Steve has got as much controversy as Mel's last one , it feels more true. The characters seem more suited and it's not <b>a</b> <b>big,</b> <b>white</b> wedding, it's a low-key register office thing." [...] 17 million viewers watched the wedding.|$|E
2500|$|Handsome Dan was {{selected}} based {{on his ability to}} tolerate bands and children, negative reaction to the color crimson and to tigers (the symbols of rival schools Harvard and Princeton respectively), and Graves (?) cleaned up the dog and named him “Handsome Dan.” Soon, Dan followed Graves everywhere around campus, including sporting events. The students quickly adopted Dan as the Yale mascot. After Graves graduated and returned to England, Dan stayed on campus with his master’s brother. Before football and baseball games would begin, Handsome Dan founded a tradition and a dynasty by being led across the field. One newspaper reported: [...] "He was <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>white</b> bulldog, with one of the greatest faces a dog of that breed (English) ever carried". This was not an exaggeration, as Handsome Dan was one of the finest specimens of his breed in America, and went on to win first prize at the Westminster Dog Show and at least thirty other first prize ribbons in the United States and Canada. According to the Hartford Courant, [...] "In personal appearance, he seemed like a cross between an alligator and a horned frog, and he was called handsome by the metaphysicians under the law of compensation. The title came to him, he never sought it. He was always taken to games on a leash, and the Harvard football team for years owed its continued existence {{to the fact that the}} rope held." [...] The Philadelphia Press reported that [...] "a favorite trick was to tell him to 'Speak to Harvard.' He would bark ferociously and work himself into physical contortions of rage never before dreamed of by a dog. Dan was peculiar to himself in one thing – he would never associate with anyone but students. Dan implanted himself more firmly in the hearts of Yale students than any mascot had ever done before." [...] Handsome Dan crossed the Atlantic to join his old master in 1897 and died in 1898. Graves had Dan stuffed and returned him to be displayed at Yale in the old gymnasium. When it was torn down, Dan I was sent to the Peabody Museum for reconstruction. Handsome Dan I now is in a sealed glass case in one of the trophy rooms of Yale's Payne Whitney Gymnasium, where, according to Stanton Ford, [...] "he is the perpetual guardian of the treasures which attest to generations of Yale athletic glory." [...] Andrew Graves died of tuberculosis on February 18, 1948, in Westbury, Long Island.|$|E

60|$|So once--it {{was late}} on a Thursday evening in autumn, and wild weather outside, terribly dark, and raining so heavily and blowing so hard that {{the walls of the}} cottage shook again--they were all sitting {{together}} by the fireside, each of them busy with something or other, when suddenly some one rapped three times against the window-pane.
