50|$|Fauna that reside within Bahamian dry forests {{includes}} the Bahaman funnel-eared bat (Natalus tumidifrons), rock iguanas (Cyclura spp.), the Bahamian hutia (Geocapromys ingrahami), and the Cuban amazon (<b>Amazona</b> <b>leucocephala</b> bahamensis).|$|R
50|$|The Cuban amazon (<b>Amazona</b> <b>leucocephala)</b> {{also known}} as Cuban parrot or the rose-throated parrot, is a {{medium-sized}} mainly green parrot found in woodlands and dry forests of Cuba, the Bahamas and Cayman Islands in the Caribbean.|$|R
50|$|Endemic birds {{include the}} olive-capped warbler (Dendroica pityophila), Cuban kite (Chondrohierax wilsonii), Cuban trogon (Priotelus temnurus), Cuban amazon, (<b>Amazona</b> <b>leucocephala)</b> and Cuban tody (Todus multicolor). The Cuban ivory-billed {{woodpecker}} (Campephilus principalis bairdii) may remain in eastern pine forests, but is probably extinct.|$|R
50|$|Fauna seen {{in various}} {{locations}} around the island include blue iguanas (Cyclura lewisi), Grand Cayman amazon parrots (<b>Amazona</b> <b>leucocephala</b> caymanensis), Central American agouti (Dasyprocta punctata), and Gecarcinus ruricola, a species of land crab. The Cayman Islands Turtle Farm located in the West Bay district raises green sea turtles for their meat and to release into the wild.|$|R
50|$|Notable {{species of}} birds include the Bahamian {{subspecies}} of Cuban amazon (<b>Amazona</b> <b>leucocephala</b> bahamensis), which exists only in Cuba, the Cayman Islands, the southern Bahamas and Abaco. This population is unique in that it nests in limestone solution cavities rather than tree cavities. Abaco is also known for its intact elkhorn and staghorn coral structures, and for its critically endangered breed of feral horse, the Abaco Barb.|$|R
50|$|Cayman avian fauna {{includes}} two endemic subspecies of Amazona parrots: A. l. hesterna Bangs, 1916 or Cuban amazon, now {{restricted to the}} island of Cayman Brac, but formerly also on Little Cayman, and <b>Amazona</b> <b>leucocephala</b> caymanensis or Grand Cayman parrot, which is native to the Cayman Islands, forested areas of Cuba, and the Isla de la Juventud. Little Cayman and Cayman Brac are also home to red-footed and brown boobies. There are five endemic subspecies of butterflies on the islands.|$|R
50|$|With an {{estimated}} population of only 600 - 800 birds, the Fernandina's flicker {{is one of}} the most endangered woodpeckers in the world. Overall, that population is declining, principally because of habitat loss. Farming, logging, hurricane damage and the caged bird trade - trappers bring down whole palm trees in order to capture nestling Cuban amazons (<b>Amazona</b> <b>leucocephala</b> leucocephala) - are combining to squeeze the remaining birds into smaller and smaller isolated tracts. In addition, West Indian woodpeckers have been observed killing the chicks of Fernandina's flickers.|$|R
5|$|The Puerto Rican amazon (Amazona vittata), {{also known}} as the Puerto Rican parrot or iguaca, is the only extant bird endemic to the {{archipelago}} of Puerto Rico belonging to the Neotropical genus Amazona. Measuring , the bird is a predominantly green parrot with a red forehead and white rings around the eyes. Two subspecies have been described, although there are doubts regarding the distinctiveness of the form gracilipes from Culebra Island, extinct since 1912. Its closest relatives are believed to be the Cuban amazon (<b>Amazona</b> <b>leucocephala)</b> and the Hispaniolan amazon (Amazona ventralis).|$|R
500|$|In {{addition}} to being kept as pets locally, many Cuban macaws (perhaps thousands of specimens) were traded and sent to Europe. [...] This trade has also been suggested as a contributing cause for extinction. Judging {{by the number of}} preserved specimens that originated as captives, the species was probably not uncommon in European zoos and other collections. It was popular as a cagebird, despite its reputation for damaging items with its beak. Furthermore, collectors caught young birds by observing adults and felling the trees in which they nested, although sometimes nestlings were accidentally killed. [...] This practice reduced population numbers and selectively destroyed the species' breeding habitat. This means of collection continues today with the Cuban parakeet (Psittacara euops) and the Cuban amazon (<b>Amazona</b> <b>leucocephala).</b>|$|R
500|$|There is no {{evidence}} that the West Indies were connected to a continent in the past, and thus the various native bird species are assumed to be descended from those that immigrated to the Caribbean at some point. Some small species would have encountered problems traversing large bodies of water, but parrots have flight strength and various behavioral characteristics that would facilitate [...] "over-water" [...] dispersion. Most Caribbean bird species originate from Central, North and South America. The Amazona species found in the Caribbean are divided in two groups: five mid-sized species found in the Greater Antilles and seven large species in the Lesser Antilles. All the Greater Antillean amazons display characteristics leading to suppositions of relatedness, including predominantly green-toned color patterns and white rings around the eyes. Russello and Amato conclude that all Greater Antillean Amazona descend from Amazona albifrons with <b>Amazona</b> vittata, <b>Amazona</b> <b>leucocephala,</b> and <b>Amazona</b> ventralis constituting a complex, a cluster of species so closely related that they intergrade.|$|R
30|$|Less mobile organisms also avoid fire {{through a}} variety of means. Eastern fence lizards (Sceloporus undulatus) have been {{observed}} burrowing (Bishop and Murrie 2004) and climbing trees (Beane 2006) to avoid fire. Radio-tagged meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus) have escaped fire by finding shelter in underground refugia, fleeing to unburned areas, and moving onto the bare ground of a pocket gopher (Geomys bursarius) burrow mound (Geluso et al. 1986). In a high elevation oak-pine woodland in Arizona, eight radio-tagged individuals of three species of montane rattlesnakes (Crotalus lepidus, C. molossus, and C. willardi obscurus) retreated to underground shelters in a low intensity ground fire (Smith et al. 2001). Cuban parrots (<b>Amazona</b> <b>leucocephala)</b> nesting in limestone solution holes in pine forests in the Bahamas had no loss of nests after 20 occupied burrows were burned over by a fire (Stahala 2005). O’Brien et al. (2006) measured temperature and CO 2 concentrations during a surface fire within a 1.2 m deep cavity typical of the limestone solution hole used for nesting by the Cuban parrot. Carbon dioxide concentrations rose no more than 3 -fold while air temperature rose 0.4 °C {{at the bottom of the}} burrow. The residence time of the fire was approximately 15 min within 1 m of the cavity entrance. Many additional examples of fire avoidance behavior are provided in Komarek (1969), Bendell (1974), Whelan (1995), and Russell et al. (1999).|$|R
40|$|Seven accessions of Leucaena Benth, {{supported}} {{significantly different}} population densities of Heteropsylla cubana Crawford. The highest populations {{occurred on the}} I [...] Ieucocephala (Lamb.) De Wit accessions K 8, K 527, and K 784, the I [...] diversifolia (Schlecht.) Benth, accession K 156, and the L. <b>leucocephala</b> X <b>I</b> [...] diversifolia accession K 743. The lowest psyllid densities occurred on the L. pallida Britton and Rose accession K 376. Accessions K 8, K 527, and K 636 were the most severely damaged. Accessions K 743 and K 156 were often slightly damaged and only occasionally moderately damaged. Only slight damage was observed on accessions K 784 and K 376. Parasitism of H. cubana by Psyllaephagus yaseeni Noyes was low (1. 9 %), probably due to hyperparasitization levels averaging 39. 6 %...|$|R
