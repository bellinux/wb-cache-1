2500|$|Once there, Jill seduces Alan {{and the two}} undress {{and attempt}} to have sex. However, Alan breaks this off when he hears the horses making noises in the stables beneath, which he decides {{is the reason for}} his {{inability}} to get an erection. Jill tries to ask Alan what the problem is, but he shouts at her to leave. After Jill dresses and walks out of the stables, the still nude Alan begs the horses for forgiveness, as he sees the horses as God-like figures. [...] "Mine!...You're mine!...I am yours and you are mine!" [...] cries Equus through Dysart's voice, but then he becomes threatening: [...] "The Lord thy God is a jealous God," [...] Equus/Dysart seethes, [...] "He sees you, he sees you forever and ever, Alan. He sees you!...He sees you!" [...] Alan screams, [...] "God sees!" [...] <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> [...] "No more. No more, Equus!" [...] Alan then uses a steel spike to blind the six horses in the stable, whose eyes have [...] "seen" [...] his very soul.|$|E

6000|$|... "Am I his brother's keeper?" [...] And then {{he kind of}} wilted together, {{and looked}} like he wished he hadn't spoken so, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> very gentle: [...] "But you needn't say that, Billy; I was took sudden and irritable, and I ain't very well these days, and not hardly responsible.

6000|$|Weel, on the morn I gaed up to {{the office}} and there I foond the factor and a lang, thin, dour man wi' grey hair and a face as brown and crinkled as a walnut. He looked hard at me wi' a pair o' een that glowed like twa spunks, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> says he: ...|$|E

He {{stretches}} himself and yawns out {{the hypothesis that}} he must have dropped off for a minute. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> he wouldn't mind sitting in at a little gentleman's game of poker. He used to play some when he attended high school in Brooklyn; and as he was out for a good time, why--and so forth.|$|E
6000|$|... "Master Joseph is wery wiolent, {{but there}} is no one like old Diggs for {{grabbing}} a bit of one's wages. He do so love it! <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> you never need be at no loss for nothing; you can find everything under my roof. I should like to know who is to mend our shoes. Has Gaffer Diggs a cobbler's stall?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> {{proceeded}} to <b>say</b> it {{in a rather}} jumbled-up fashion, but very sincerely.|$|R
6000|$|Petru did {{not know}} what to do. He listened in silence for the most part, but now <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> would <b>say,</b> 'Yes, yes, you must have been badly treated,' just for politeness' sake; what more could he do? ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was fully}} {{an hour before}} Jasper Grinder was able to speak, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> could <b>say</b> but little. But he {{explained}} how {{it was that he}} had been shot.

6000|$|... "Willie {{was sure}} dandy-looking in his uniform, with medals strung on his breast {{and his new}} gold-handled sword. You'd never have taken him for the little white-headed snipe that the girls used to order about and make fun of.

6000|$|This {{sentiment}} communicates new {{impulse to}} Mrs. Sliverstone, who launches into new praises of Mr. Sliverstone’s worth and excellence, {{to which he}} listens in the same meek silence, save when he puts in a word of self-denial relative to some question of fact, as—‘Not seventy-two christenings that week, my dear. Only seventy-one, only seventy-one.’ At length his lady has quite concluded, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> Why should he repine, why should he give way, why should he suffer his heart to sink within him? Is it he alone who toils and suffers? What has she gone through, he should like to know? What does she go through every day for him and for society? ...|$|E
6000|$|He got {{a balloon}} and sailed {{up and up}} and up, {{in front of a}} map that was as big as Rhode Island. He went on up till he was out of sight, and by and by he came down and got {{something}} to eat and went up again. To cut a long story short, he kept on doing this for a day or two, and finally he came down and said he thought he had found that solar system, but it might be fly-specks. So he got a microscope and went back. It turned out better than he feared. He had rousted out our system, sure enough. He got me to describe our planet and its distance from the sun, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> to his chief-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Yes. And please, ma’am, the {{servants}} gives him gin-and-water sometimes; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> cries, <b>and</b> <b>says</b> <b>he</b> hates {{his wife and}} the boarders, and wants to tickle them.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But Mr. Wright {{ought to}} know {{something}} about it before <b>he</b> <b>says</b> such things. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> this that <b>he's</b> <b>saying</b> now isn't the same that he said before." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{he brings}} home a {{sum of money}} every day--about thirty shillings--sometimes fifty: <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> smiles, <b>and</b> <b>says</b> it's a good day's work. This is not like a forger," [...] said pore Mrs. A.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{he asked}} if I thought that if he'd promise to send you the money would the gentleman let him go without payin' for the tire, {{and he wanted to}} know what your name was; and when I told him you hadn't no husband, and what your name was, he asked me to say it over again, and then he made me say it once more--the whole of it; and while I was tellin' him that I'd write it down for him if he wanted to send you the money, he give a big jump and he stuck his head out like a bull. He looked so queer that I was gettin' skeered; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> almost whisperin': 'I go! I go away! I leave my bear! If she sell him, that pay everything!

'That 'ere Tony is the blessedest boy,' said Mr. Weller, heedless of this rebuff, 'the blessedest boy as ever I see in MY days! {{of all the}} charmin'est infants as ever I heerd tell on, includin' them as was kivered over by the robin-redbreasts arter they'd {{committed}} sooicide with blackberries, {{there never}} wos any like that 'ere little Tony.

[...] To see him a settin' down on the doorstep pretending to drink out of it, and fetching a long breath artervards, and smoking a bit of firevood, and sayin', [...] "Now I'm grandfather," [...] - to see him a doin' that at two year old is better than any play as wos ever wrote.

But I'm not so sure about it. Bartle Massey says--and he knows the South--as the northern men are a finer breed than the southern, harder-headed and stronger-bodied, and a deal taller. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> in some o' those counties it's as flat as the back o' your hand, and you can see nothing of a distance without climbing up the highest trees. I couldn't abide that. I like to go to work by a road that'll take me up a bit of a hill, and see the fields for miles round me, and a bridge, or a town, or a bit of a steeple here and there. It makes you feel the world's a big place, and there's other men working in it with their heads and hands besides yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If only he don't {{have to go}} to {{jail for}} two or three years!" [...] Seth cried, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> fearing <b>he</b> might <b>say</b> that which would sound like a complaint, he took his leave after {{promising}} to report next evening.|$|R
6000|$|He would, as Mr Powell depicts, {{sit on the}} {{skylight}} and bend over the reclining girl, wondering what there was behind the lost gaze under the darkened eyelids in the still eyes. He would look <b>and</b> look <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> would <b>say,</b> whisper rather, it didn't take much for his voice to drop to a mere breath--he would declare, transferring his faded stare to the horizon, {{that he would never}} rest till he had [...] "got her away from that man." ...|$|R
50|$|Pete and Ken bring Don home, and he drunkenly asks Jonesy what he {{saw when}} he died. Jonesy reports he saw a light <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>says</b> <b>he</b> doesn't {{like to think about}} it. Don wonders if the light was like hot {{tropical}} sunshine and if he heard the ocean.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> {{that the}} Roman Empire was dying. Very true: but {{often as he}} quotes Salvian, he omits always {{to tell us what}} Roman society was dying of. Salvian says, that it was dying of vice. Not of bad laws and class arrangements, but of bad men. M. Guizot belongs to a school which is apt to impute human {{happiness}} and prosperity too exclusively to the political constitution under which they may happen to live, irrespectively of the morality of the people themselves. From that, the constitutionalist school, there has been of late a strong reaction, the highest exponent, nay the very coryphaeus of which is Mr. Carlyle. He undervalues, even despises, the influence of laws and constitutions: with him private virtue, from which springs public virtue, is the first and sole cause of national prosperity. My inaugural lecture has told you how deeply I sympathize with his view--taking my stand, as Mr. Carlyle does, on the Hebrew prophets.|$|E
60|$|Just {{precisely}} {{what happened after}} {{that has been the}} most impossible thing to disinter. I have given all the things that Melville remembered were said, I have linked them into a conversation and checked them by my cousin's afterthoughts, and finally I have read the whole thing over to him. It is of course no verbatim rendering, but it is, he says, closely after the manner of their talk, the gist was that, and things of that sort were said. And when he left Chatteris, he fully believed that the final and conclusive thing was said. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> it came into his head that, apart from and outside this settlement, there still remained a tangible reality, capable of action, the Sea Lady. What was she going to do? The thought toppled him back into a web of perplexities again. It carried him back into a state of inconclusive interrogation past Lummidge's Hotel.|$|E
6000|$|... 'So I {{thought of}} doing, and I had out a young fellow, who I thought might take my place---my partner's son, young Stebbing. They {{wrote that he}} had been {{learning}} Italian, with a view to being useful to me, and so on; but when he came out, what was he but a fine gentleman--- never had put his hand to a pick, nor a blasting-iron; and as to his Italian, he told me it was the Italian of Alfieri and Leopardi. Leopardi's Italian it might be, for it was a very mottled or motley tongue, but {{he might as well have}} talked English or Double-Dutch to our hands, or better, for they had picked up the meaning of some orders from me before I got used to their lingo. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> 'tis office work and superintendence he understands. How can you superintend, I told him, what you don't know yourself? No, no; go home and bring a pair of hands fit for a quarryman, before I make you overlooker.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm not Merwell!" [...] growled the fellow, {{in a deep}} voice. [...] "Don't {{you dare}} to stick me with that pin again, or I'll mash you!" [...] <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> refused to <b>say</b> any more. But he gave Dave's arm such a pinch that it was black and blue {{for a long time}} afterwards.|$|R
6000|$|... "'High art! I {{should think}} it is high art!' whispers old Smee; 'fourteen feet high, at least!" [...] <b>And</b> <b>then</b> out loud <b>he</b> <b>says</b> 'The picture has very fine points in it, Gandish, as you say. Foreshortening of that arm, capital!

6000|$|In the {{meantime}} the elder son rode {{into the world}} to find the touchstone of the trial of truth; and whenever {{he came to a}} place of habitation, he would ask the men if they had heard of it. And in every place the men answered: [...] "Not only have we heard of it, but we alone, of all men, possess the thing itself, and it hangs in the side of our chimney to this day". Then would the elder son be glad, and beg for a sight of it. And sometimes it would be a piece of mirror, that showed the seeming of things; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> would <b>say,</b> [...] "This can never be, for there should be more than seeming". And sometimes it would be a lump of coal, which showed nothing; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> would <b>say,</b> [...] "This can never be, for at least there is the seeming". And sometimes it would be a touchstone indeed, beautiful in hue, adorned with polishing, the light inhabiting its sides; and when he found this, he would beg the thing, and the persons of that place would give it him, for all men were very generous of that gift; so that at the last he had his wallet full of them, and they chinked together when he rode; and when he halted {{by the side of the}} way he would take them out and try them, till his head turned like the sails upon a windmill.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should think}} there did--a very partic'lar thing," [...] said Mr. Macey, nodding sideways. [...] "For Mr. Drumlow--poor old gentleman, I was fond on him, though he'd {{got a bit}} {{confused}} in his head, what wi' age and wi' taking a drop o' summat warm when the service come of a cold morning. And young Mr. Lammeter, he'd have no way but he must be married in Janiwary, which, to be sure, 's a unreasonable time to be married in, for it isn't like a christening or a burying, as you can't help; and so Mr. Drumlow--poor old gentleman, I was fond on him--but when he come to put the questions, he put 'em by the rule o' contrairy, like, and he says, [...] "Wilt thou have this man to thy wedded wife?" [...] says he, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> [...] "Wilt thou have this woman to thy wedded husband?" [...] says he. But the partic'larest thing of all is, as nobody took any notice on it but me, and they answered straight off [...] "yes", like {{as if it had}} been me saying [...] "Amen" [...] i' the right place, without listening to what went before." ...|$|E
6000|$|And then {{he found}} that the Lord was ready to save him. That what the Lord wished was, not to kill him, but to recover him, and make him live--live more really, and fully, and wisely, and manfully--by making him trust more utterly in God's goodness, and love, and mercy; making him more certain that, good as he thought himself, and perfect in heart, he was full of sins: and yet that the Lord had cast all these sins of his behind his back, {{forgotten}} and forgiven them, as soon as he had made him see that all that was good and strong in him came from God, and all that was evil and weak from himself. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> 'O Lord, by these things men live, and in all these things is the life of my spirit.' God meant all along to receive me, and make me live. He chastened me, and brought me low, to shew me that my own faith, my own righteousness, was no reason for his saving me: but that his own love and mercy was a good reason for saving me. 'Behold,' he goes on to say, 'for peace I had great bitterness: but thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption: for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back.' ...|$|E
60|$|My dearest Miss Mitford,--I am tied {{and bound}} beyond {{redemption}} {{for the next}} fortnight at least, therefore the hope of seeing you must be for afterwards. I dare say you think that a child can be stowed away like other goods; but I do assure you that my child, though quite capable of being amused by his aunts for {{a certain number of}} half-hours, would break his little heart if I left him for a whole day while he had not Wilson. When she is here, he is contented. In her absence he is sceptical about happiness, and suspicious of complete desolation. Every now <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> to me, 'Will mama' (saying it in his pretty, broken, unquotable language) 'go away and leave Peninni all alone?' He won't let a human being touch him. I wash and dress him, and have him to sleep with me, and Robert is the only other helper he will allow of. 'There's spoiling of a child!' say you. But he is so good and tender and sensitive that we can't go beyond a certain line. For instance, I was quite frightened about the effect of Wilson's leaving him. We managed to prepare him as well as we could, and when he found she was actually gone, the passion of grief I had feared was just escaped. He struggled with himself, the eyes full of tears, and the lips quivering, but there was not any screaming and crying such as made me cry last year on a like occasion. He had made up his mind.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Mulla-mulgars," [...] he said, [...] "and {{beside his}} bow and his sharp-nosed darts, {{he has three}} big knubbly cudgels in the corner higher than is Nod.

5000|$|Atkinson also {{describes}} {{a boy who}} witnessed the massacre {{of men and women}} including his own mother:"A boy has arrived in Mezreh in a bad state nervously. As I understand it, he was with a crowd of women and children from some village who joined our prisoners and went out June 23. The boy says that in the gorge this side of Bakir Maden the men and women were all shot and the leading men had their heads cut off afterwards. He escaped and came here.
