5|$|Here {{came the}} Rabbi, his back bent, his face shaved... His mere {{presence}} among the deportees added {{a touch of}} unreality to the scene. It was like a page torn from some story book... One by one they passed in front of me, teachers, friends, others, all those I had been afraid of, all those I once could have laughed <b>at,</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> I had lived with over the years. They went by, fallen, dragging their packs, dragging their lives, deserting their homes, the years of their childhood, cringing like beaten dogs.|$|E
5|$|Later in the Han Dynasty, mystics like Luan {{gradually}} {{lost their}} influence as the rulers passed many laws against them. Mediums {{were not allowed}} to barter their crafts alongside roads, and some were even forbidden to make a living at such a craft <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> <b>Those</b> married to shamans were not even allowed to hold government office, though this law was often bypassed. Luan Da's fall signaled {{the beginning of the end}} for these mystics.|$|E
5|$|Sunspots {{are visible}} as dark patches on the Sun's photosphere, and {{correspond}} to concentrations of magnetic field where the convective transport of heat is inhibited from the solar interior to the surface. As a result, sunspots are slightly cooler than the surrounding photosphere, and, so, they appear dark. At a typical solar minimum, few sunspots are visible, and occasionally none {{can be seen}} <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> <b>Those</b> that do appear are at high solar latitudes. As the solar cycle progresses towards its maximum, sunspots tend form closer to the solar equator, a phenomenon known as Spörer's law. The largest sunspots can be {{tens of thousands of}} kilometers across.|$|E

25|$|Bad boundaries: Narcissists do not {{recognize}} that they have boundaries and that others are separate and are not extensions of themselves. Others either exist {{to meet their needs}} or may as well not exist <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> <b>Those</b> who provide narcissistic supply to the narcissist are treated as if {{they are part of the}} narcissist and are expected to live up to those expectations. In the mind of a narcissist, there is no boundary between self and other.|$|E
500|$|The 2001 census showed, that of {{the people}} living in the borough of Halton, 83.8% {{declared}} themselves to be Christian, 8.7% stated that they had [...] "no religion," [...] and 7.0% made no religious claims <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> <b>Those</b> stating their religions as Buddhist, Hindu, Jewish, Islam or Sikh amounted to 0.5%.|$|E
500|$|Some Christian writers {{worried that}} Avatar {{promotes}} pantheism and nature worship. [...] A critic for L’Osservatore Romano of the Holy See {{wrote that the}} film [...] "shows a spiritualism linked to the worship of nature, a fashionable pantheism in which creator and creation are mixed up." [...] Likewise, Vatican Radio argued that the film [...] "cleverly winks <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> pseudo-doctrines that turn ecology into {{the religion of the}} millennium. [...] Nature is no longer a creation to defend, but a divinity to worship." [...] According to Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi, these reviews reflect the Pope's views on neopaganism, or confusing nature and spirituality. On the other hand, disagreeing with the Vatican's characterization of Avatar as pagan, a writer in the National Catholic Reporter urged Christian critics to see the film in the historical context of [...] "Christianity's complicity in the conquest of the Americas" [...] instead.|$|E
50|$|On 19 May 1903 {{there was}} a decisive meeting in Rotthalmünster <b>at</b> which <b>all</b> <b>those</b> {{affected}} were present from the district officer (Bezirksamtsmann) to representatives of every rural district.

2500|$|Anime News Network {{contributor}} Jacob Hope Chapman {{was critical}} of the show's production quality in his review of episodes 1–3, stating that, [...] "Berserk 2016 is an abominably ugly and almost forcefully unpleasant realization of our dreams, with cut-rate CGI, questionable music choices, and disorienting camera work." [...] However, to him {{the strength of the}} source work helps to carry the show, and Itagaki's frenetic directing style at least keeps the action interesting: [...] "Once you manage to unclench your teeth <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> garish cel-shaded puppet bodies smacking against each other, Miura's compelling story and captivating world still shine as one-of-a-kind flights of dark imagination with poignant characterization, even as they struggle under such a lackluster production." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{lionfish}} invasion {{is considered}} {{to be one of the}} most serious recent threats to Caribbean and Florida coral reef ecosystems. To help address the pervasive problem, [...] in 2015 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) partnered with the Gulf and Caribbean Fisheries Institute to set up a lionfish portal to provide scientifically accurate information on the invasion and its impacts. The lionfish web portal is aimed <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> involved and affected, including coastal managers, educators and the public and the portal was designed as a source of training videos, fact sheets, examples of management plans, and guidelines for monitoring. The web portal draws on the expertise of NOAA's own scientists as well as other scientists and policy makers from academia NGO and managers.|$|E
2500|$|On 14 February 2007, a German {{translation}} of RuneScape was introduced, {{followed by a}} French translation on 11 December 2008, Brazilian Portuguese on 24 July 2009, and Latin American Spanish on 25 April 2013. In an interview in May 2008, former Jagex CEO Geoff Iddison stated that, [...] "We do plan to go East with it [...] to the Asian market and the Eastern European market too" [...] "RuneScape is not for Japan, but it could work well in Malaysia for example. And where's India in all this? I think RuneScape is a game that would be adopted in the English-speaking Indian world and the local-speaking Indian world.

2500|$|I {{have devoted}} much space and {{discussion}} {{to the role}} of the Mongol 'phags-pa alphabet in the origin of the Korean alphabet, but it should be clear to any reader that in the total picture, that role was quite limited. [...] The origin of the Korean alphabet is, in fact, not a simple matter <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> <b>Those</b> who say it is [...] "based" [...] in 'phags-pa are partly right; those who say it is [...] "based" [...] on abstract drawings of articulatory organs are partly right. [...] Nothing would disturb me more, after this study is published, than to discover in a work on the history of writing a statement like the following: [...] "According to recent investigations, the Korean alphabet was derived from the Mongol 'phags-pa script" [...] phags-pa contributed none of the things that make this script perhaps the most remarkable in the world.|$|E
