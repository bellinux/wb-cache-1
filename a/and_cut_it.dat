5|$|Sir Joseph {{commissioned}} Pistrucci {{to craft}} a cameo of King George III. As the King was ill with porphyria, Pistrucci modelled the likeness from Marchant's three-shilling bank token, <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>it</b> in red jasper for a fee of 50 guineas. Banks showed the cameo to William Wellesley-Pole, elder brother of the Duke of Wellington and the Master of the Mint, who was greatly impressed {{by the quality of}} what he saw. At this time, the Royal Mint was preparing to issue new gold and silver coins as part of the Great Recoinage of 1816, and in June of that year, Pole decided to hire Pistrucci to make models in stone for the new coinage that could be converted into steel dies by the Mint's engravers.|$|E
5|$|According to the legend, Vasu (also {{known as}} Uparicara Vasu), a Chedi King, {{was on a}} hunting {{expedition}} {{when he had a}} nocturnal emission while dreaming of his wife. Using an eagle, He sent his semen to his queen but due to a fight mid-air with another eagle, the semen fell into the river and was swallowed by the cursed Adrika-fish. Consequently, the fish became pregnant. Soon, A fisherman caught the pregnant fish <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>it</b> open to find two babies in the womb of the fish, one male and one female. The fisherman presented the children to the king, who kept the male child. The boy grew up to become King Matsya, the founder of the Matsya Kingdom. The king gave the female child back to the fisherman, naming her Matsya-gandha ("She who smells like fish"). The fisherman raised the girl as his daughter and named her Kali ("the dark one") because of her complexion. Over the course of time, Kali earned the name Satyavati ("truthful"). The fisherman was also a ferryman, ferrying people across the river in his boat. Satyavati helped her father, the fisherman, in his job and grew up into a beautiful maiden.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} script {{called for}} Michael to tell Andy about Angela's affair {{outside in the}} parking lot before getting into his car and driving away. When filming began, Holland considered filming the scene inside the car instead. Steve Carell suggested Michael get in the car and leave Andy outside, then tell him while driving away, which was how the scene was ultimately shot. During a scene when Andy returns to the office and confronts his co-workers; there is a long, awkward silence, and the script originally called for Kevin to pass gas and ruin the tension. During filming, it was changed so Phyllis would pass gas instead because it was decided it would be funnier if it were a woman. During the editing process, Holland decided the joke did not work very well <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>it,</b> but a brief moment of Dwight reacting in a disgusted way to the flatulence, while maintaining a defensive fighting pose toward Andy, can still be seen in the finished episode.|$|E

The commander of the Military Division of West Mississippi was Major General Edward Richard Sprigg Canby, a career soldier with whom Farragut worked in planning the attack on Mobile.

25|$|However, Rommel {{had failed}} to relieve the {{isolated}} German-Italian strongholds on the Libya–Egypt border and the 7,000 strong garrison at Bardia surrendered on 2 January 1942 after an attack by 2nd South African Division. Sollum fell to the South Africans on 12 January after a small fiercely fought engagement. This completed the surrounding of the heavily fortified Halfaya position (which included the escarpment, the plateau above it and the surrounding ravines) <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>it</b> off from the sea and any potential seaborne supply. The 5,000 defenders, mainly 55th Savona Infantry Division's troops, were already desperately short {{of food and water}} and after this had to rely on meagre supplies from air drops. The carefully prepared positions allowed the defenders to hold out obstinately against the heavy artillery and aerial bombardment with relatively few casualties, but hunger and thirst forced a capitulation on 17 January.|$|E
25|$|The German Eighteenth Army and the Sixteenth Army {{successfully}} {{conquered the}} remaining parts of Estonia, seizing Chudovo, north of Novgorod, which severed {{one of the}} two main supply lines from Leningrad to Moscow. In support of these operations, Richthofen's Corps dropped 3,351 tons of bombs in 4,742 attacks from 10 to 20 August 1941. On 20 August Richthofen moved strike and fighter aircraft to Spasskaya Polist, 40km north-east of Novgorod, to support an attack that would encircle Leningrad, <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>it</b> off from Murmansk. German XXXXI Panzer Corps sealed in Soviet forces in the Lake Ilmen-Luga-Novgorod sector. The Leningrad Front attempted to relieve them, and Richthofen was ordered to blunt the attack. The Soviets were supported by strong air units, and large air battles broke out. During the course of them Fliegerkorps VIII lost one of its most able Stuka aces, Anton Keil. The Germans succeeded in maintaining their lines, and could now turn to capturing Leningrad.|$|E
25|$|At the Battle of Waterloo on the 16th, Milhaud's two {{divisions}} and the Imperial Guard light cavalry took {{position on the}} right flank, behind the I Corps. At 1:30 PM, Napoleon sent General of Division Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d'Erlon's I Corps at the Anglo-Allied lines, supported by General of Brigade Étienne Jacques Travers' cuirassier brigade. The heavy cavalrymen enjoyed a quick success when they caught the Hanoverian Lüneburg Light Battalion in line formation behind La Haye Sainte <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>it</b> to pieces. Soon after, the cuirassiers were attacked and routed by the British Household Cavalry Brigade. Later in the day, Marshal Michel Ney ordered Milhaud to send one brigade of cuirassiers to charge what he erroneously {{believed to be a}} retreating enemy. By some mistake, Delort's entire division moved to the attack followed {{by the rest of the}} IV Cavalry Corps as well as the Guard light cavalry. The unsupported French cavalry hurled itself at the Allied infantry squares, cannons, and cavalry but were beaten back. Again and again the cavalry returned to the attack but every charge was repelled. Soon the III Cavalry Corps and the Guard heavy cavalry joined in, but every charge failed. By 6:00 PM, the superb French reserve cavalry was ruined as a fighting force.|$|E

25|$|When the Cuman-Kipchaks swore oaths it {{was done}} with swords in the hands that touched {{the body of a}} dog cut in two. The Italian Franciscan monk, traveler, and {{historian}}, John of Plano Carpini, says that when the Hungarian prince married the Cuman princess, ten Cumans swore over a dog cut in half with a sword that they would defend the Kingdom of Hungary. The Christian writer and historian of the crusades, Jean de Joinville (c. 1224–c. 1317), mentions that when the Cumans and Byzantines made an alliance, the Cumans made a dog pass between both sides <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>it</b> with a sword, obliging the Byzantines to do the same; the Cumans said that both they and the Byzantines should be cut in pieces if they failed each other. Joinville described a Cuman noble's funeral: he was buried seated on a chair whilst his best horse and best sergeant were placed beside him alive. Prior to this the sergeant was given a large sum of money by the Cuman leaders for the purpose of handing it back to them when they too would come into the afterlife. The Cuman khan also gave a letter of recommendation to the sergeant, which was addressed to the first king of the Cumans, in which the present king testified to the sergeant's good character. After these proceedings a huge mound was raised above the tomb. Cumans were buried in their warrior outfits. Wolves were greatly respected by the Cuman-Kipchaks, and they would sometimes howl along with them in commune. The personal bodyguard of the khan were called Bori (wolf in Turkic). Like other nomadic nations, the Cuman-Kipchaks initiated blood bonds (with the purpose of symbolically cementing a bond) by the drinking or mixing of each other's blood.|$|E

500|$|The title {{sequence}} includes abundant {{references to}} the novel, and exposes several political themes. Salander's tattoos, such as her phoenix and dragon tattoos, were incorporated. The multiple flower representations signified the biological life cycle, as well as Henrik, who received a pressed flower each year on his birthday. [...] "One had flowers {{coming out of this}} black ooze," [...] said Fincher, [...] "it blossoms, and then it dies. And then a different flower, as that one is dying is rising from the middle of it.

[...] Ultimately, the vignette becomes very conceptual because Miller and his team took [...] "a whole thought, <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>it</b> up into multiple different shots that are mixed in with other shots".

Additionally, 'Abassi was reinforced with a Sa'iqa company (lit. lightning; Egyptian commandos).
