40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to {{demonstrate}} how documentation analysis with a neo-documentalist lens can help us explore variations (and stabilities) in conceptions and materialities of documents, as intertwined with disciplinary and sub-disciplinary practices of informing and knowing. Drawing on documentation theory, and with previous research on archaeological documentation as a background, by means of autoethnographic vignettes we explore contemporary conceptions of documentation in five areas in or related to archaeology (Intra-site 3 D documentation, Development-led archaeology, Aggregating documentation for use outside the organization, Mediating documentation – or documentation mediation, and Documenting and displaying archaeology in a changing environment). Digitization, and how digitization has spurred renegotiations of what counts as documentation, functions as a common denominator discussed in all of the vignettes. The analysis highlights simultaneously ongoing renegotiations of documentation serving each area’s unique epistemic purposes, and pushing document materialities in different directions. This operationalization of documentation analysis creates an understanding for intra-disciplinary variations in documentation but is importantly also a practical tool to uncover documentation-related premises of disciplinary knowledge-making. This tool can be applied for example in processes of information policy development (regulating what purposes documentation should serve, and what it should be like), information systems design (e. g. for creation and communication of documentation), and infrastructure development (e. g. for preservation and <b>accessibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>documentation).</b> ARKDIS Arkeologisk information i det digitala samhälle...|$|E
40|$|Librarians and {{trainers}} {{working together}} in Africa If {{everyone involved in}} agricultural development {{had access to the}} right information, at the right time and in the right place, many problems in this field could be resolved overnight. In an effort to get closer to this ideal, CTA and IFLA (International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions) brought together 15 reference librarians, agronomists, trainers and publishers based in anglophone Africa for a workshop from June 15 - 26, 1987 in Lilongwe, Malawi. This workshop was held to complement one for francophone participants (held in December 1986 in Dakar) and saw ten countries represented: Botswana, Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Tanzania and Zambia. The training team consisted of both ACP and European specialists in this field including S. Keena of IFD; W. Robert, J. Kinney, P. Wortley and M. Kinch. The major agricultural databases and principal suppliers of background information were represented by E. Lebowitz of AGRIS, J. Loder of CABI, K. Russel of the U. S. NAL, D. Hall of IFIS and D. Wood of the British Library Document Supply Centre. Identifying user needs This meeting not only enabled the participants to better appreciate analytical methodologies and identify user needs, but also increased their familiarity with primary and secondary information sources dealing with tropical agriculture. Emphasis was placed on the means of improving the publication, distribution and acquisition of documents as well as inter-library loans. The objective is to ensure the availability and <b>accessibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>documentation</b> through the supply of photocopies or microfilm. The potential of CD-ROM (Compact Disc - Read Only Memory; see Spore 9) was also covered. This new technology promises considerable advances for improving access to information. Furthermore, it appears to be quite appropriate for developing countries as it is sturdy, relatively inexpensive, easy to use and does not depend on unreliable telecommunication systems. The workshop also considered the role librarians can play as intermediaries between producers and consumers of information, an aspect which is unfortunately often underestimated. The approach taken by the workshop itself was to encourage the sharing of the practical experiences {{of the participants in the}} use of resources. The presentation of national reports and the ensuing discussion enabled the identification of a certain number of major problems that were subsequently treated in detail. This session had little in common with an academic course: the theoretical presentations were only used to introduce the practical work Concrete results Among other things, this part of the workshop dealt with the use of bibliographies, abstracts and directories. A concrete result was the compilation of several guides to inforrnation sources notably a 'List of agricultural periodicals in Africa', a 'Directory of research centres, universities and rural development departments in Africa' and a 'Bibliography of agricultural bibliographies dealing with Africa'. If the first two guides will remain as working documents, the third one will be developed further and jointly published by CTA and the International Federation for Documentation (IFD) in 1988. The value of this bibliographic directory is that it offers a synthesis of agricultural information relevant for use in Africa. Other practical results of the workshop included two project proposals. The first calls for the preparation of a bibliography on women and development in Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi and Zambia, and the second for the rehabilitation of the documentation resources of the Department of Agriculture in Ghana. Both of these projects may be funded by CTA or the FAO as a follow-up to this workshop. Exhaustive but productive Two field trips were organized for participants. The first one saw them visit the library of the Faculty of Agricultural Sciences at the University of Malawi (Bunda College) where they were briefed on a course erititled 'How to use documentation'. During the second visit, at the Department of Agricultural Research in Chitedze, they were given a demonstration on the use of micro-computers for literature searches, the development of local data bases, and access to international agricultural databases (notably CABI and AGRICOLA) with CDROM technology. Two aspects of this training proved to be particularly popular with participants: information retrieval from different sources (individuals, institutions and documents) and the collection of current agricultural documentation produced at the national level in order to stock a national agricultural library. According to the evaluation sheets, the workshop was exhaustive but highly productive. As a result of similarly positive reviews of the Dakar workshop, CTA intends to continue this kind of training activity. One is planned for 1988 in the Pacific region and another in 1989 for the Caribbean. A report on these activities, including an evaluation, is planned.

40|$|Introduction: There {{is a great}} health {{services}} disparity between {{urban and rural areas}} in China. The percentage of people who are unable to access {{health services}} due to long travel times increases. This paper takes Donghai County as the study unit to analyse areas with physician shortages and characteristics of the potential spatial <b>accessibility</b> <b>of</b> health services. We analyse how the unequal health services resources distribution and the New Cooperative Medical Scheme affect the potential spatial <b>accessibility</b> <b>of</b> health services in Donghai County. We also give some advice on how to alleviate the unequal spatial <b>accessibility</b> <b>of</b> health services in areas that are more remote and isolated. Methods: The shortest traffic times of from hospitals to villages are calculated with an O-D matrix of GIS extension model. This paper applies an enhanced two-step floating catchment area (E 2 SFCA) method to study the spatial <b>accessibility</b> <b>of</b> health services and to determine areas with physician shortages in Donghai County. The sensitivity of the E 2 SFCA for assessing variation in the spatial <b>accessibility</b> <b>of</b> health services is checked using different impedance coefficient values(a). Geostatistical Analyst model and spatial analyst method is used to analyse the spatial pattern and the edge effect <b>of</b> potential spatial <b>accessibility</b> <b>of</b> health services. Results: The results show that 69 % of villages have access to lower potential spatial <b>accessibility</b> <b>of</b> health services than the average for Donghai County, and 79 % of the village scores are lower than the average for Jiangsu Province. The potential spatial <b>accessibility</b> <b>of</b> health services diminishes greatly from the centre of the county to outlying areas. Using a smaller impedance coefficient leads to greater disparity among the villages. The spatial <b>accessibility</b> <b>of</b> health services is greater along highway in the county. Conclusions: Most of villages are in underserved health services areas. An unequal distribution of health service resources and the reimbursement policies of the New Cooperative Medical Scheme have led to an edge effect regarding spatial <b>accessibility</b> <b>of</b> health services in Donghai County, whereby people living {{on the edge of the}} county have less access to health services. Comprehensive measures should be considered to alleviate the unequal spatial <b>accessibility</b> <b>of</b> health services in areas that are more remote and isolated...|$|R

Based on {{the current}} {{condition}} of Guangzhou subway network, the authors used GIS methods and extended the space syntax theory to analyze the <b>accessibility</b> <b>of</b> the subway network, and compared with actual passenger flow. The results show: 1) Space syntax is practicable to measure the <b>accessibility</b> <b>of</b> subway system; 2) Among all sections by division, the <b>accessibility</b> <b>of</b> Tiyuxilu-Chen Clan Academy is the highest, the <b>accessibility</b> <b>of</b> Yantang-Panyu Square is the second highest, while the <b>accessibilities</b> <b>of</b> Jiaokou–Xicun and Dongchong–Jinzhou are the lowest, the <b>accessibility</b> <b>of</b> Xilang-Chen Clan Academy is the second lowest; 3) The <b>accessibility</b> level <b>of</b> subway and actual passenger flow have a positive correlation, the higher the accessibility, the larger the passenger flow; 4) As a whole, line 1 has the highest accessibility and the largest passenger flow, followed closely by line 3. Their departure frequency and number of carriages should be properly increased to relieve passenger flow pressure. Line 4 has relatively low accessibility and less passenger flow, so it should appropriately decrease train frequency or extend departure interval to reduce operating cost at present. Certainly, space syntax inevitably has its limitations, but after proper extension, the space syntax method {{can be used to}} instruct traffic reconstructing and urban planning etc...|$|R
