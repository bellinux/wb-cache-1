5|$|The Prague Spring {{reforms were}} a strong attempt by Dubček to grant {{additional}} {{rights to the}} citizens of Czechoslovakia in an act of partial decentralization of the economy <b>and</b> <b>democratization.</b> The freedoms granted included a loosening of restrictions on the media, speech and travel. After national discussion of dividing the country into a federation of three republics, Bohemia, Moravia-Silesia and Slovakia, Dubček oversaw the decision to split into two, the Czech Republic and Slovak Republic. This was the only formal change that survived the end of Prague Spring, though the relative success of the nonviolent resistance undoubtedly prefigured and facilitated the peaceful transition to liberal democracy with the collapse of Soviet hegemony in 1989.|$|E

25|$|In {{the middle}} of 1960 some counter-movements to Taylorism arose. Representatives of the {{so-called}} Human Relations movement urged humanization <b>and</b> <b>democratization</b> of the working world. The criticism of Taylorism supports the unilateral approach of labor. Strictly speaking, Taylorism is not a scientific theory. All theories of F.W. Taylor are based on experiments. On the basis of samples, conclusions were made, which were then generalized. There is no representativeness of the selected sample.|$|E
25|$|In the MENA region, {{however, the}} United States {{did little to}} rupture {{relations}} with authoritarian regimes and largely avoided paying significant attention to human rights <b>and</b> <b>democratization.</b> Indeed, at times the United States found itself opposed to democratic governance in the MENA region when it conflicted with American interests – participating in the overthrow of a democratically elected government in Iran in 1953, for example, due to oil interests and alleged fear of any leftist move toward the Soviets.|$|E

25|$|In IQ and Global Inequality Lynn and Vanhanen {{argue that}} intelligence, as {{measured}} by IQ tests, is {{a major contributor to}} national wealth as well as to various measures of social well-being.

The book is a follow-up to Lynn and Vanhanen's 2002 book IQ and the Wealth of Nations, and expands on many of the ideas presented in their earlier book.|$|E
25|$|The Ngalop Bhutanese monarchy itself, and {{especially}} the reigning Druk Gyalpo, are prominent symbols of Bhutan.

The democratic Constitution of 2008 explicitly enshrines the institution of the monarchy and the line of Ugyen Wangchuck.

25|$|The {{end of the}} Cold War {{presented}} an opportunity to reshape the international system. This opportunity was afforded to the Cold War's victor's-- that is to say—the United States and other western capitalist states governed by liberal-democratic values that put a premium on basic human rights <b>and</b> <b>democratization.</b> In the preceding decades the state was the only entity to receive special status. While there were exceptions, such as groups struggling against colonial powers, the state possessed the ultimate degree of legitimacy. As a result, the international community rarely meddled with the internal machinations of a given country. Sovereignty {{was not to be}} violated and this was a system which benefited both superpowers, their allies, as well as third world governments.|$|E
25|$|With {{the growth}} of {{advanced}} industrial society during the Cold War era, critical theorists recognized that the path of capitalism and history had changed decisively, that the modes of oppression operated differently, and that the industrial working class no longer remained the determinate negation of capitalism. This led to the attempt to root the dialectic in an absolute method of negativity, as in Marcuse's One-Dimensional Man (1964) and Adorno's Negative Dialectics (1966). During this period the Institute of Social Research resettled in Frankfurt (although many of its associates remained in the United States) with the task not merely of continuing its research but of becoming a leading force in the sociological education <b>and</b> <b>democratization</b> of West Germany. This led to a certain systematization of the Institute's entire accumulation of empirical research and theoretical analysis.|$|E
25|$|Statistical reports {{made by the}} OGPU-NKVD-MGB-MVD {{between the}} 1930s and 1950s are kept in the State Archive of the Russian Federation {{formerly}} called Central State Archive of the October Revolution (CSAOR). These documents were highly classified and inaccessible. Amid glasnost <b>and</b> <b>democratization</b> in the late 1980s, Viktor Zemskov and other Russian researchers managed {{to gain access to}} the documents and published the highly classified statistical data collected by the OGPU-NKVD-MGB-MVD and related to the number of the Gulag prisoners, special settlers, etc. In 1995, Zemskov wrote that foreign scientists have begun to be admitted to the restricted-access collection of these documents in the State Archive of the Russian Federation since 1992. However, only one historian, namely Zemskov, was admitted to these archives, and later the archives were again “closed”, according to Leonid Lopatnikov.|$|E

On 2 September 1945 J signed the act of unconditional capitulation.|$|E
25|$|Many {{academics}} {{argue that}} peacebuilding is {{a manifestation of}} liberal internationalism and therefore imposes Western values and practices onto other cultures. Mac Ginty states that although peacebuilding does not project all aspects of Western culture on to the recipient states, it does transmit some of them, including concepts like neoliberalism that the West requires recipients of aid to follow more closely than most Western countries do. Barnett also comments that the promotion of liberalization <b>and</b> <b>democratization</b> may undermine the peacebuilding process if security and stable institutions are not pursued concurrently. Richmond has shown how 'liberal peacebuilding' represents a political encounter that may produce a post-liberal form of peace. Local and international actors, norms, institutions and interests engage {{with each other in}} various different contexts, according to their respective power relations and their different conceptions of legitimate authority structures.|$|E
25|$|The 1960s in Paraguay were {{characterized}} by repressive violence, armed attacks by soldiers and reprisals by guerrillas, which led to hundreds of deaths and imprisonment of political dissidents. Alternating waves of violence and conciliation served to strengthen fear and consolidate presidential power. In fact, women's suffrage was not achieved in Paraguay until 1961, and was not granted by means of women's agitation, as all forms of dissent were punished <b>and</b> <b>democratization</b> was extinguished. Rather, enfranchisement was granted because President Stroessner wanted to bolster his support with women who might influence voters. As early as 1962, together with María Campos Cervera, María Elena de Pérez, Mary del Pino, and Beatriz Méndez de Prieto, Casco established another organization they called Amparo a la Mujer (Refuge for Women) to continue the work they had begun in 1953. In 1963, a women's journal, Cuñatai, was launched, facilitating participation {{of women in the}} political arena, with Casco serving as the director. The journal survived {{for a year and a}} half. During all this time, Casco had continued teaching in various schools in Asunción, but in 1965 she stopped teaching and turned her focus to politics.|$|E

500|$|The {{advocates of}} human rights <b>and</b> <b>democratization,</b> {{according}} to Bloch and Reddaway, made up about half the dissidents repressed by means of psychiatry. Nationalists made up about one-tenth of the dissident population dealt with psychiatrically. Would-be emigrants constituted about one-fifth of dissidents victimized by means of psychiatry. People, detained only because of their religious activity, made up about fifteen per cent of dissident-patients.

500|$|The {{university}} has a student body {{deeply involved in}} social activism. Its origins {{can be traced to}} the early years of the university. In 1954 the first national student congress took place in Cali, where the main issues that the student movement would tackle were defined: the university's autonomy, and the freedom <b>and</b> <b>democratization</b> of education. [...] Then, in 1957, the National Union of University Students was established. The university would become an important member of this organization, whose first significant action would take place in May of the same year that ended the dictatorship of General Gustavo Rojas Pinilla. The events started with a strike by students of the university, followed by students of private universities in Bogotá, and then by workers in the industrial, transportation, financial, and commercial sectors.|$|E
