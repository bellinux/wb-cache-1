French forces dominated Elba but {{were unable to}} make <b>an</b> <b>impression</b> <b>on</b> {{the walls of the}} fortress while Royal Navy forces controlled access to the island by sea, providing supplies for the defenders and denying them to the French. Halsted and Phoenix maintained a blockade of the port of Piombino on the Italian mainland, ensuring the interception of French supplies.|$|E

This event would leave <b>an</b> <b>impression</b> <b>on</b> her, and as her parents were not interested in her taking up performance arts, she decided that she wanted to become a singer.|$|E

5|$|Although Warren {{departed}} {{the region}} soon afterwards {{with most of}} his squadron, Watrin was still unable to make <b>an</b> <b>impression</b> <b>on</b> the walls of Porto Ferrajo, and Airey held the town against the French {{for the last few}} weeks of the war until news arrived of the ceasefire that accompanied the provisional signing of the Treaty of Amiens on 1 October. On 11 October, volunteers from the Maltese Light Infantry arrived to relieve the garrison at Porto Ferrajo. In March 1802 under Article XI of the final terms of the Treaty, the British turned over the entire island to the French and Elba remained in French hands throughout the Napoleonic Wars. The Maltese detachment returned to Malta in April 1802.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool {{were among}} the favourites to win the {{competition}} while Ajax were virtually unknown outside of the Netherlands. Liverpool manager Bill Shankly had made a scouting trip to watch Ajax before the match and witnessing them lose to lowly opposition returned confident Liverpool would progress. A few of Liverpool's players, including striker Roger Hunt, were part of England's victorious World Cup campaign in 1966. Ajax {{were coming out of}} a poor period, after they had finished in 13th place in the 1964–65 Eredivisie, while the Netherlands national team had yet to make <b>an</b> <b>impression</b> <b>on</b> the international stage. The board of Ajax decided to hire Rinus Michels. He changed the team's formation to a 4–2–4, with an emphasis on passing and possession of the ball. The team showed improvement, winning the Eredivisie in his first season in charge.|$|E
5|$|Picard is irritated {{that the}} stellar {{cartography}} department has shut down several systems on the Enterprise, and visits the section {{to discover what}} is going on. He meets {{the head of the}} department, Lt. Commander Nella Daren, who makes <b>an</b> <b>impression</b> <b>on</b> Picard. It is a meeting memorable enough to later discuss with Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden). At a musical recital by Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner), Picard is surprised to see Daren, once again, playing the piano. The two discuss music, and later meet in Picard's quarters and participate in a duet. Daren plays a portable piano and Picard performs on his Ressikan flute.|$|E

5|$|Second, it {{was then}} that Japan {{underwent}} a period of intense Westernization in order to compete with other developed countries. Initially architects and styles from abroad were imported to Japan but gradually the country taught its own architects and began to express its own style. Architects returning from study with western architects introduced the International Style of modernism into Japan. However, it was not until after the Second World War that Japanese architects made <b>an</b> <b>impression</b> <b>on</b> the international scene, firstly with the work of architects like Kenzo Tange and then with theoretical movements like Metabolism.|$|E
5|$|The Siege of Porto Ferrajo was a French {{attempt to}} force the {{surrender}} of the Tuscan fortress town of Porto Ferrajo (now Portoferraio) {{on the island of}} Elba following the French occupation of mainland Tuscany in 1801 during the French Revolutionary Wars. The Tuscan garrison was heavily outnumbered, but received significant support from British Royal Navy forces who controlled the Mediterranean Sea and ensured that supplies reached the garrison and that French supply convoys were intercepted. The French began the siege with 1,500 men in May 1801, later reinforced to more than 5,000, but could not make <b>an</b> <b>impression</b> <b>on</b> the fortress's defences, instead seeking to starve the defenders into submission with the support of a squadron of French Navy frigates operating off the coast.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} officially {{began when}} a lone Israeli S-199 bombed Egyptian positions in Isdud at 18:00 on June 2. Five light planes—two Fairchild 24s, two Rapides and one Bonanza—also made bombing runs between 20:25 and 21:30. The bombardment {{did not make}} <b>an</b> <b>impression</b> <b>on</b> the readying Israeli soldiers, and {{in light of the}} noise created by the Egyptian anti-aircraft guns, the Israelis considered that the plane was lucky to have survived the run. In addition, the troops were exhausted, not having had proper sleep in the four days preceding the operation. At 22:00, the Israeli forces started moving against the Egyptian positions.|$|E

5|$|Today, the Alaska Volcano Observatory {{monitors}} {{activity at}} Mount Cleveland using satellite imagery. Cloud cover often obscures the volcano, which makes many events difficult to follow. In addition, the low {{resolution of the}} satellite imagery allows minor events, which do not make <b>an</b> <b>impression</b> <b>on</b> the satellite picture, to pass unnoticed. There are no seismic or geophysical instruments on the mountain (the nearest are in Nikolski), and some eruptions are first observed by pilots flying over the volcano. A field {{study was conducted in}} late 2001, and an automatic system based on thermal anomalies was implemented following eruptive events in 2005. In recent years the Alaska Volcano Observatory has made an effort to expand volcanic coverage westward along the Aleutian Arc.|$|E
5|$|Ion Creangă {{was born}} in Humulești in the Principality of Moldavia, a former village which has since been {{incorporated}} into Târgu Neamț city, the son of Orthodox trader Ștefan sin Petre Ciubotariul and his wife Smaranda. His native area, bordering on heavily forested areas, was in the Eastern Carpathian foothills, and included into {{what was then the}} principality of Moldavia. The surrounding region's population preserved an archaic way of life, dominated by shepherding, textile manufacturing and related occupations, and noted for preserving the older forms of local folklore. Another characteristic of the area, which left <b>an</b> <b>impression</b> <b>on</b> Creangă's family history, was related to the practice of transhumance and the links between ethnic Romanian communities {{on both sides of the}} mountains, in Moldavia and Transylvania: on his maternal side, the writer descended from Maramureș-born peasants, while, according to literary historian George Călinescu, his father's origin may have been further southwest, in Transylvania-proper.|$|E
5|$|On June 29, 2009, Swagger {{was traded}} to the Raw brand, making his debut as part of a three-on-one {{gauntlet}} match against WWE Champion Randy Orton, in which he got himself purposely counted out in order to make <b>an</b> <b>impression</b> <b>on</b> Orton. On the July 13 episode of Raw, he won his first match on the brand by defeating Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP). He then feuded with MVP for several weeks, culminating at SummerSlam, in a match that MVP won. After his short feud with MVP ended, Swagger began pursuing the United States Championship. He had a title match on September 21 against Kofi Kingston but lost the match by countout after stealing the championship belt and leaving the arena with it but Kingston later took it back while Swagger was in a physical confrontation with The Miz. Swagger made another unsuccessful attempt at the title at Hell in a Cell in a triple threat match against Kingston and The Miz. At the Royal Rumble, Swagger entered at number 26 in the Royal Rumble match, but was later eliminated by Kofi Kingston.|$|E

5|$|A classic {{encounter}} battle, {{the action}} had been fought between two forces of roughly equal {{size in the}} heavy monsoon rain at close quarters. Both companies had deployed to the high ground at {{around the same time}} in a bid to outflank the other, with the Australian infantry skilfully using their supporting artillery while the Viet Cong had attempted to nullify the Australian tactics by remaining in close contact. Ultimately, the artillery had decided the outcome in favour of the Australians however, and the Viet Cong had been forced to withdraw with heavy casualties. In this way the fighting bore many similarities to the victory twelve months earlier at Long Tan, yet it remained largely unheralded in Australia. Eight Australian soldiers received gallantry awards for their actions, including Military Crosses to O'Donnell, Ross and Clark, while Sutherland was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal. A number of awards were also made to the RAAF pilots and aircrew, including Cox who was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. Meanwhile, the bravery evident by the Viet Cong during the battle had also made <b>an</b> <b>impression</b> <b>on</b> the Australians, who later acknowledged their tight fire discipline and the skilfulness of their battle drills and tactics which they found to be similar to those used by the Australians themselves.|$|E
5|$|Since around 1937, Verity had {{expected}} {{the outbreak of}} the Second World War and had prepared for it through reading military literature. He and Bowes decided to enlist together, and after briefly serving in the Air Raid Precautions in Guiseley until Bowes' wife gave birth, they attempted to join the infantry. However, Bowes was hampered by an old knee complaint and later became a gunnery officer. After serving as a sapper in the Royal Engineers, Verity was commissioned in January 1940 as a second lieutenant in the Green Howards, and later promoted to captain. Following a spell at the Infantry Training Centre, he was posted to the 1stBattalion. He served at the regimental depot in Richmond, North Yorkshire, where he was responsible for training recruits. In the spring of 1941, the battalion moved to Omagh in Northern Ireland for further training. Verity's Yorkshire and England teammate Norman Yardley was also in the 1st Battalion; the fame of these cricketers made <b>an</b> <b>impression</b> <b>on</b> the local population. Playing several cricket matches, Verity frequently took wickets on rough pitches that were unsuitable for batting. There was even time for his appearance in a charity match at Lord's. In August, he returned to England and after a spell in London, he was posted overseas.|$|E
