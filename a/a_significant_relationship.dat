25|$|A {{study of}} {{norepinephrine}} levels in gamblers found high cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) {{levels of the}} norepinephrine (NE) metabolite 3-methoq-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MI-IPG). This could suggest {{a relationship between the}} noradrenergic system and gambling, and gambling could be seen as a reward-dependent behavior, but according to Cloninger’s theory these gamblers should exhibit low levels of NE, not high. Cloninger suggests that had these gamblers been retested after they had refrained from gambling for a determined period, their CSF MHPG levels might have been low. A study of norepinephrine levels in alcoholics with high reward dependence also showed a significant decrease of MHPG in their CSF. This finding demonstrates <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>relationship</b> between reward dependence and norepinephrine.|$|E

25|$|There {{has been}} some {{investigation}} into human CD36 as well. A study examined oral detection of fat in obese subjects with genetic bases for high, medium, and low expression of the CD36 receptor. Those subjects with high CD36 expression were eight times more sensitive to certain fats (oleic acid and triolein) than the subjects with low CD36 expression. Those subjects with an intermediate amount of CD36 expression were sensitive to fat at a level between {{the high and low}} groups. This study demonstrates that there is <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>relationship</b> between oral fat sensitivity and the amount of CD36 receptor expression, but further investigation into CD36 could be useful for learning more about lipid tasting in the context of obesity, as CD36 may be a target for therapies in the future.|$|E

Specifically, the number of reported fatigue-related medical errors increased as the number of extended-duration shifts per month increased. At least one fatigue-related significant medical error was reported in 3.8% of months with no extended-duration work shifts; and at least one fatigue-related significant medical error was reported in 9.8% of months that had between one and four extended-duration work shifts and in 16% of months that had five or more extended-duration work shifts. Furthermore, the frequency of attentional failures was strongly associated with the frequency of extended-duration work shifts. Evidence from this study further corroborates the negative impact that extended-duration work shifts may have on performance, as well as increased accidents and injuries.|$|E

The purpose of the registry was to monitor the long-term health effects of people in Libby exposed to tremolite asbestos and to assist with communicating important health information to registrants. Researchers have used the registry to study how asbestos exposure affects human health. This research has yielded several important findings.

25|$|Another {{method used}} to assess the amount and effects of water {{pollutants}} is to measure the amount of PM2.5 in rainfall. Measuring PM2.5 (the amount of aerodynamic diameter of particle≤2.5 μm in a given amount of air) is a common metric for assessing air quality. Comparing PM2.5 levels between air and rainfall samples allows scientists to determine the amount of air pollution being transferred to water sources. Pollutants in rainfall quickly and directly affect pollution in groundwater sources. In 2013, researchers in Beijing found <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>relationship</b> between the amount of PM2.5 concentrations in the air and in rainfall. Studies showed that rainfall had a significant “washing” effect on PM2.5 in the air, transferring a large portion of these pollutants from the air to water sources. In this way, Beijing’s notorious air pollution has a direct and significant impact on rainfall, and therefore, on water resources throughout the region.|$|E
500|$|In 2015 {{researchers}} Limb, Limb, Limb and Limb {{published a}} paper on their study into the effect of surnames on medical specialisation. They looked at 313,445 entries in the medical register from the General Medical Council, and identified surnames that were apt for the speciality, for example, Limb for an orthopaedic surgeon, and Doctor for medicine in general. They found that the frequency of names relevant to medicine and to subspecialties was much greater than expected by chance. Specialties that had the largest proportion of names specifically relevant to that specialty were those for which the English language has provided {{a wide range of}} alternative terms for the same anatomical parts (or functions thereof). Specifically, these were genitourinary medicine (e.g., Hardwick and Woodcock) and urology (e.g., Burns, Cox, Ball). Neurologists had names relevant to medicine in general, but far fewer had names directly relevant to their specialty (1 in every 302). Limb, Limb, Limb and Limb did not report on looking for any confounding variables. In 2010 Abel came to a similar conclusion. In one study he compared doctors and lawyers whose first or last names began with three-letter combinations representative of their professions, for example, [...] "doc", [...] "law", and likewise found <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>relationship</b> between name and profession. Abel also found that the initial letters of physicians' last names were significantly related to their subspecialty. For example, Raymonds {{were more likely to be}} radiologists than dermatologists.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to investigate the relationship among locus of control (LOC), religious orientation (RO) and test anxiety (TA) among Iranian EFL learners. Furthermore, it scrutinized the role of gender on these variables. To achieve such goals, 100 Iranian EFL students (57 females, 43 males) studying English at Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman participated in the study. These students were randomly selected from junior and senior students majoring in English Translation and English Literature. In order to obtain the required data, three questionnaires were utilized: Rotters’s (1966) locus of control scale (LOCS) to measure participants’ level of LOC, Sarason’s (1975) test anxiety scale (TAS) to measure participants’ TA, and Allport and Ross’s (1967) religious orientation scale (ROS) to determine participants’ intrinsic or extrinsic religious orientation. For analysis of data, Pearson Product Moment Correlation and T-test were used.

This study aimed to investigate the relationship between childhood abuse experiences with dark triad traits of personality among university students. Materials and Methods: This descriptive- analytical study was a correlational study. The statistical population included all university students in Islamic Azad university of Urmia branch in year 2015. Totally, 400 students were selected through randomly cluster sampling method. All of them completed the questionnaires of childhood abuse experiences and dark triad traits of personality. Data were analyzed by using the SPSS- 19 software and by Pearson’s correlation and multivariate regression method. Results: Physical abuse had <b>a</b> negative <b>significant</b> <b>relationship</b> with narcissism (r=- 0. 099) and had <b>a</b> positive <b>significant</b> <b>relationship</b> with psychopathy (r= 0. 248) and Machiavellism (r= 0. 189). Emotional abuse had <b>a</b> positive <b>significant</b> <b>relationship</b> with narcissism (r= 0. 089), psychopathy (r= 0. 164) and Machiavellism (r= 0. 245). Sexual abuse had <b>a</b> negative <b>significant</b> <b>relationship</b> with narcissism (r=- 0. 108). Neglect abuse had <b>a</b> positive <b>significant</b> <b>relationship</b> with narcissism (r= 0. 157) and had <b>a</b> negative <b>significant</b> <b>relationship</b> with psychopathy (r=- 0. 208) and Machiavellism (r=- 0. 171). Also, childhood abuse experiences significantly predicted 7. 6 percent of variance of narcissism, 7 percent of variance of psychopathy and 6. 7 percent of variance of Machiavellism (p≤ 0. 05). Conclusion: According to findings of this research, counselors and therapists must consider the symptoms of these variables and design appropriate programs based on them to prevent shaping dark triad traits of personality. ...|$|R
