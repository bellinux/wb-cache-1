5|$|Symphony No. 5, Op. 50, FS 97 is <b>a</b> <b>symphony</b> {{composed}} by Carl Nielsen in Denmark between 1920 and 1922. It was first performed in Copenhagen on 24 January 1922 with the composer conducting. It {{is one of}} the two of Nielsen's six symphonies lacking a subtitle.|$|E

50|$|Perhaps surprisingly, {{given that}} Rachmaninoff wrote orchestral and two-piano {{versions}} of his Symphonic Dances, which is effectively <b>a</b> three-movement <b>symphony,</b> {{no one has}} orchestrated this Suite as <b>a</b> possible <b>symphony.</b>|$|R
5|$|The German {{composer}} Paul Hindemith {{wrote an}} opera about Kepler entitled Die Harmonie der Welt, and <b>a</b> <b>symphony</b> {{of the same}} name was derived from music for the opera.|$|E
5|$|Music {{is part of}} {{the core}} {{curriculum}} for first to third forms. Pupils take lessons with peripatetic music staff within different disciplines. There is <b>a</b> <b>symphony</b> orchestra composed of students, along with several other smaller classical ensembles. In addition to classical music, there are also a number of jazz and rock bands within the school as well, and to recognise this in addition to the four main music prizes awarded each year, there is an additional contemporary music prize.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes {{the text}} {{can give a}} basic outline that {{correlates}} to the four-movement scheme of <b>a</b> <b>symphony.</b> For instance, the four-part structure of Edgar Allan Poe's The Bells, a progression from youth to marriage, maturity, and death, naturally suggested the four movements of <b>a</b> <b>symphony</b> to Sergei Rachmaninoff, which he followed in his choral symphony of the same name. The text can encourage a composer to expand a choral symphony past the normal bounds of the symphonic genre, as with Berlioz for his Roméo et Juliette, yet stay within the basic structural or aesthetic intent of symphonic form. It can also influence the musical content in parts {{where there is no}} singing, as in Roméo et Juliette. There, Berlioz allows the orchestra to express the majority of the drama in instrumental music and saves words for expository and narrative sections of the work.|$|E
50|$|The Symphony Orchestra of India is <b>an</b> <b>symphony</b> {{orchestra}} {{based in}} Mumbai, India. It {{was founded in}} 2006 by the National Centre for the Performing Arts (NCPA), Mumbai, which is also its home.|$|R
50|$|His {{compositions}} {{included two}} operas, <b>a</b> Rural <b>Symphony,</b> <b>a</b> suite on Indian themes for strings, and two Indian legends, {{as well as}} numerous pieces for piano.|$|R

5|$|The Clouds divide, and JUNO {{appears in}} a Machine drawn by Peacocks; while <b>a</b> <b>Symphony</b> is playing, it moves gently forward, and as it descends, it opens and discovers the Tail of the Peacock, which is so large, that it almost fills {{the opening of the}} Stage between Scene and Scene.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from his}} operas, Wagner {{composed}} relatively {{few pieces of}} music. These include <b>a</b> <b>symphony</b> in C major (written {{at the age of}} 19), the Faust Overture (the only completed part of an intended symphony on the subject), some overtures, and choral and piano pieces. His most commonly performed work that is not an extract from an opera is the Siegfried Idyll for chamber orchestra, which has several motifs in common with the Ring cycle. The Wesendonck Lieder are also often performed, either in the original piano version, or with orchestral accompaniment. More rarely performed are the American Centennial March (1876), and Das Liebesmahl der Apostel (The Love Feast of the Apostles), a piece for male choruses and orchestra composed in 1843 for the city of Dresden.|$|E
5|$|As a manifesto, this {{paragraph}} became {{significant for the}} amalgamation of symphonic and dramatic elements in the same musical composition. Musicologist Hugh MacDonald writes that as Berlioz kept the idea of symphonic construction closely in mind, he allowed the orchestra to express {{the majority of the}} drama in instrumental music and set expository and narrative sections in words. Fellow musicologist Nicholas Temperley suggests that, in Roméo, Berlioz created a model for how a dramatic text could guide the structure of a choral symphony without circumventing that work from being recognizably <b>a</b> <b>symphony.</b> In this sense, musicologist Mark Evans Bonds writes, the symphonies of Liszt and Mahler owe a debt of influence to Berlioz.|$|E

5|$|As {{one of the}} Gulf Coast's {{cultural}} centers, Mobile {{has several}} art museums, <b>a</b> <b>symphony</b> orchestra, a professional opera, a professional ballet company, and a large concentration of historic architecture. Mobile is known for having the oldest organized Carnival celebrations in the United States. The festival began to be celebrated {{in the first decade}} of the 18th century by its first French Catholic colonial settlers. Mobile was host to the first formally organized Carnival mystic society, known elsewhere as a krewe, to celebrate with a parade in the United States, beginning in 1830.|$|E
5|$|Bennett had a {{significant}} influence on English music, not solely as a composer {{but also as a}} teacher, as a promoter of standards of musical education and as an important figure in London concert life. In recent years, appreciation of Bennett's compositions has been rekindled and a number of his works, including <b>a</b> <b>symphony,</b> his piano concerti, some vocal music and many of his piano compositions, have been recorded. In his bicentenary year of 2016, several concerts of his music and other related events took place.|$|E
5|$|In 1970 Zappa met {{conductor}} Zubin Mehta. They {{arranged a}} May 1970 concert where Mehta conducted the Los Angeles Philharmonic augmented by a rock band. According to Zappa, {{the music was}} mostly written in motel rooms while on tour with the Mothers of Invention. Some of it was later featured in the movie 200 Motels. Although the concert was a success, Zappa's experience working with <b>a</b> <b>symphony</b> orchestra was not a happy one. His dissatisfaction became a recurring theme throughout his career; he often felt {{that the quality of}} performance of his material delivered by orchestras was not commensurate with the money he spent on orchestral concerts and recordings.|$|E

5|$|In his fifties, Elgar {{composed}} <b>a</b> <b>symphony</b> and {{a violin}} concerto that were immensely successful. His second symphony and his cello concerto did not gain immediate public popularity and took {{many years to}} achieve a regular place in the concert repertory of British orchestras. Elgar's music came, in his later years, {{to be seen as}} appealing chiefly to British audiences. His stock remained low for a generation after his death. It began to revive significantly in the 1960s, helped by new recordings of his works. Some of his works have, in recent years, been taken up again internationally, but the music continues to be played more in Britain than elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, America {{produced}} diverse composers such as Anthony Heinrich, who composed in an idiosyncratic, intentionally American style {{and was the}} first American composer to write for <b>a</b> <b>symphony</b> orchestra. Many other composers, most famously William Henry Fry and George Frederick Bristow, supported the idea of an American classical style, though their works were very European in orientation. It was John Knowles Paine, however, who became the first American composer to be accepted in Europe. Paine's example inspired the composers of the Second New England School, which included such figures as Amy Beach, Edward MacDowell, and Horatio Parker.|$|E
5|$|Saint-Saëns's student {{compositions}} included <b>a</b> <b>symphony</b> in A major (1850) and a choral piece, Les Djinns (1850), {{after an}} eponymous poem by Victor Hugo. He competed for France's premier musical award, the Prix de Rome, in 1852 but was unsuccessful. Auber {{believed that the}} prize {{should have gone to}} Saint-Saëns, considering him to have more promise than the winner, Léonce Cohen, who made little mark during the rest of his career. In the same year Saint-Saëns had greater success in a competition organised by the Société Sainte-Cécile, Paris, with his Ode à Sainte-Cécile, for which the judges unanimously voted him the first prize. The first piece the composer acknowledged as a mature work and gave an opus number was Trois Morceaux for harmonium (1852).|$|E

5|$|Sullivan {{was born}} in London on 13 May 1842. His father was a {{military}} bandmaster, {{and by the time}} Arthur had reached the age of eight, he was proficient with all the instruments in the band. In school he began to compose anthems and songs. In 1856, he received the first Mendelssohn Scholarship and studied at the Royal Academy of Music and then at Leipzig, where he also took up conducting. His graduation piece, completed in 1861, was a suite of incidental music to Shakespeare's The Tempest. Revised and expanded, it was performed at the Crystal Palace in 1862 and was an immediate sensation. He began building a reputation as England's most promising young composer, composing <b>a</b> <b>symphony,</b> a concerto, and several overtures, among them the Overture di Ballo, in 1870.|$|E
5|$|The {{levels in}} the game consist of galaxies filled with minor planets and worlds, with {{different}} variations of gravity, the central element of gameplay. The concept for the game's use of spherical platforms was first conceptualised from ideas used in Super Mario 128, a technology demonstration shown at Nintendo Space World in 2000. Development of Super Mario Galaxy began {{after the release of}} Donkey Kong Jungle Beat in late 2004, after Shigeru Miyamoto suggested that Nintendo should commission a large-scale Mario game. The game's soundtrack was composed by Mahito Yokota and Koji Kondo, using <b>a</b> <b>symphony</b> orchestra {{for the first time in}} the series.|$|E
5|$|The seventh symphony, the Sinfonia antartica (1952), a {{by-product}} of the composer's score for Scott of the Antarctic, has consistently divided critical opinion on whether it can be properly classed as <b>a</b> <b>symphony.</b> Alain Frogley in Grove argues that though the work can make a deep impression on the listener, it is neither a true symphony in the understood {{sense of the term}} nor a tone poem and is consequently the least successful of the mature symphonies. The work is in five movements, with wordless vocal lines for female chorus and solo soprano in the first and last movements. In addition to large woodwind and percussion sections the score features a prominent part for wind machine.|$|E
