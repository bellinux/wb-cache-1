5|$|Soraya {{is a young}} <b>Afghan</b> {{woman whom}} Amir meets and marries in the United States. Hosseini {{originally}} scripted the character as an American woman, but he later agreed to rewrite her as an <b>Afghan</b> immigrant after his editor did not find her background believable {{for her role in}} the story. The change contributed towards an extensive revision of Part III. In the final draft, Soraya lives with her parents, <b>Afghan</b> general Taheri and his wife, and wants to become an English teacher. Before meeting Amir, she ran away with an <b>Afghan</b> boyfriend in Virginia, which, according to <b>Afghan</b> tradition, made her unsuitable for marriage. Because Amir also had his own regrets, he loves and marries her anyway.|$|E
