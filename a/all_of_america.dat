500|$|In the 1990s, Freddie Meeks, {{one of the}} few {{still alive}} among the group of 50, was urged to {{petition}} the President for a pardon. Others of the Port Chicago 50 had refused to ask for a pardon, reasoning that a pardon is for guilty people receiving forgiveness; they continued to hold the position that they were not guilty of mutiny. Meeks pushed for a pardon {{as a way to get}} the story out, saying [...] "I hope that <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>America</b> knows about it... it's something that's been in the closet for so long." [...] In September 1999, the petition by Meeks was bolstered by 37 members of Congress including George Miller, the U.S. representative for the district containing the disaster site. The 37 Congressmen sent a letter to President Bill Clinton and in December 1999, Clinton pardoned Meeks, who died in June 2003. Efforts to posthumously exonerate all 50 sailors have continued. In 2004, author Robert L. Allen was reported as saying [...] "...even for today it's important to have these convictions set aside." ...|$|E
500|$|The song's {{widespread}} {{success has}} made it indispensable to the band's live setlists and has been performed over 640 times since 1991 making it the band's second most performed song behind [...] "Give it Away". Unlike several of the Chili Peppers' other songs, [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] is not interpreted in a different manner than {{what is on the}} record—aside from being played acoustically, the track is performed the same as it appears on Blood Sugar Sex Magik. Kiedis is, however, notorious for being incapable of achieving several high notes in live performances; the vocalist has noted that he sometimes forgets or rearranges song lyrics in the verses. Therefore, the song has sometimes suffered from his limitations as a singer. After being released as a single in March 1992, the song would be included in virtually all concerts; Frusciante, however, began to resent the song's popularity and would play convoluted intros, purposefully throwing Kiedis off. An example of this was during a televised performance on the highly rated program Saturday Night Live on February 22, 1992. Kiedis said that it [...] "felt like I was getting stabbed in the back and hung out to dry in front of <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>America</b> while [...] was off in a corner in the shadow, playing some dissonant out-of-tune experiment." [...] The guitarist used a distortion pedal for the ending verse and screamed incomprehensibly into the microphone when providing backup vocals, neither of which were originally planned or typical of live performances. Nevertheless, sales of Blood Sugar Sex Magik skyrocketed following the show.|$|E

Additionally, the royal governor was granted powers to undermine local democracy. Further measures allowed the extradition of officials for trial elsewhere in the Empire, if the governor felt that a fair trial could not be secured locally. The act's vague reimbursement policy for travel expenses left few {{with the ability to}} testify, and colonists argued that it would allow officials to harass them with impunity. Further laws allowed the governor to billet troops in private property without permission. The colonists referred to the measures as the [...] "Intolerable Acts", and they argued that both their constitutional rights and their natural rights were being violated, viewing the acts as a threat to <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>America.</b> The acts were widely opposed, driving neutral parties into support of the Patriots and curtailing Loyalist sentiment.|$|E
