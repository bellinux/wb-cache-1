30|$|PDH {{was carried}} out over an {{industrial}} Pt–Sn/γ-Al 2 O 3 catalyst with small amounts of water or methanol added to the feed. These <b>oxygenated</b> <b>additives</b> would maximize both the conversion of propane and the yield of propylene if they are added in the optimum amounts. Application of ANNs model can avoid difficulties like type of catalyst, uncertainty in porosity and mechanism of reaction, etc. in simulation of a catalyst activity. Based on different training algorithms, MLP has been found as the best network with minimum training error for modeling of catalyst conversion and selectivity. The obtained results incorporate excellent capability of ANN in modeling. The estimated values of ANN agreed very well with the experimental values, even in the case where the experimental data seemed to contain some error and diversity. The optimum amounts of <b>oxygenated</b> <b>additives</b> increased with increasing reaction temperature. For a given temperature, the optimum amount of water {{was more than that}} for methanol.

The {{results of the}} study may be concluded as follows: In the combustion of diesel fuel droplet with <b>additive</b> of <b>oxygenate</b> and paraffin, the dimensionless droplet size of (D/Do) 2 was linearly decreased with time. A fuel droplet with low boiling temperature additives and in high boiling temperature diesel fuel evaporates and burns faster than usual diesel fuel. This rapid burning may result from so-called “micro-explosion ” and its burning intensity varies with the types of additives. The results above may suggest that rapid evaporation of <b>oxygenate</b> <b>additive</b> in the middle stage of combustion can contribute much to combustion improvement of blended fuels.

40|$|With {{growing concern}} over {{greenhouse}} gases {{there is increasing}} emphasis on reducing CO 2 emissions. Despite engine efficiency improvements plus increased dieselization of the fleet, increasing vehicle numbers results in increasing CO 2 emissions. To reserve this trend the fuel source must be changed to renewable fuels which are CO 2 neutral. As a renewable, sustainable and alternative fuel for compression ignition engines, biodiesel is widely accepted as comparable fuel to diesel in diesel engines. This is due to several factors like decreasing the dependence on imported petroleum, reducing global warming, increasing lubricity, and reducing substantially the exhaust emissions from diesel engine. However, {{there is a major}} disadvantage in the use of biodiesel as it has lower heating value, higher density and higher viscosity, higher fuel consumption and higher NO x emission, which limits its application. Here fuel additives become essential and indispensable tools not only to minimize these drawbacks but also generate specified products to meet the regional and international standards. Fuel additives can contribute towards fuel economy and emission reduction either directly or indirectly. Their use enable vehicle performance to be maintained at, or near, optimum over the lifetime of the vehicle. A variety of additives are used in automotive biodiesel fuel to meet specification limits and to enhance quality. For example, metal based <b>additives,</b> <b>oxygenated</b> <b>additives,</b> antioxidants, cetane number improvers, lubricity improvers and cold flow improvers are used to meet specifications and quality. This article is a literature review of the effect of various additives on biodiesel properties, engine performance and exhaust emission characteristics and the corresponding effect factors were surveyed and analyzed in detail. The review concludes that the use of additive in biodiesel fuel is inalienable both for improving properties and for better engine performance and emission control.

3000|$|Alcohols and ethers {{are used}} as <b>oxygenated</b> <b>additives</b> to motor fuels and as {{antiknock}} components in gasoline. They increase the octane number and reduce the emissions of gases to greenhouse effect (CO x [...] and NO x [...]). These oxygenated compounds have partially replaced the lead-based salts that are toxic and pollutant. Among the tertiary ethers, such as ethyl tertiary butyl ether, tertiary amyl ethyl ether and tertiary amyl methyl ether, MTBE is the <b>oxygenated</b> <b>additive</b> currently, {{the most widely used}} in the reformulated gasoline and also one of organic chemicals the most produced industrially [1].

Various works proposed the synthesis of the DIPE from propene and water in a two-stage process [2], from a feed of acetone and hydrogen in a two-stage process [3] or one-step process [4] and from acetone feedstock [5]. The DIPE can be also synthesised either from a feed of propylene and water [6] or from a feed of propene and isopropanol over an acidic ion exchange resin like Amberlyst 15 [7].

Abstract: This research studies the influence of oxygenated fuels on transient and steady-state engine performance and emissions using a fully instrumented, 6 -cylinder, common rail turbocharged compression ignition engine. Beside diesel, the other tested fuels were based on waste cooking biodiesel (primary fuel) with triacetin (highly <b>oxygenated</b> <b>additive).</b> A custom test was designed in this study to investigate the engine performance and emissions during steady-state, load acceptance and acceleration operation modes. Furthermore, to study the engine performance and emissions during a whole transient cycle, a legislative cycle (NRTC), which contains numerous discrete transient modes, was utilised. In this paper, the turbocharger lag, engine power, NOx, PM, PN and PN size distribution were investigated. During steady-state operation, compared to diesel, the oxygenated fuels showed lower indicated power, while they showed higher values during turbocharger lag and acceleration. Also, during acceleration and load increase modes, NOx, PM and PN peaked over the steady-state counterpart, also, the accumulation mode count median diameter moved toward the larger particle sizes. Increasing the fuel oxygen content increased the indicated specific NOx and PN maximum overshoot, while engine power, PM, PN and PM maximum overshoot decreased.
