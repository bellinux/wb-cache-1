500|$|The stage {{contained}} wind machines, lasers, arena lighting, a teleprompter on {{the back}} and a retro, mood-lit platform during the performances of the songs. According to Nate Chinen of The New York Times, [...] "the stagecraft... keeps a viewer at a worshipful remove". During a statement before the show, Beyoncé revealed, [...] "We have designed an elegant and beautiful stage <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> new costumes that are being designed especially for this show." [...] Beyoncé is accompanied by an orchestra and her 18-member all-female band on stage [...] "whose satin interpretations pump lush over pomp" [...] according to Mike Ragogna of The Huffington Post. She is also backed by several dancers during the performances of several songs and also appears alone during some performances. The choreography for the show was developed by Beyoncé's collaborator Frank Jr. Gatson. The set list included performances of over thirty songs, both from Beyoncé's solo career and as part of the girl group Destiny's Child. During the show, one major costume change was made. Beyoncé first appeared in beaded Jean Paul Gaultier couture and then in a cape-like jacket {{for the first half of}} the show. Both pieces were worn on top of a figure-flaunting grey bodysuit. For the second part, Beyoncé traded the bodysuit for a black sequined, bathing suit-like number. Several costumes for the stage during the show were also designed by Beyoncé's mother Tina Knowles, who was her designer for many years. Arseniuk of Las Vegas Weekly praised the costumes of the show, saying that Beyoncé [...] "sparkled from beginning to end". She noted that the first costume [...] "left little to the imagination" [...] while the second one [...] "left no curve unnoticed".|$|E

This should compel all of us — world leaders, businesses and individuals — towards action rather than the paralysis of fear. We need both to reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases and to prepare for the impacts of climate change.

[...] All in all, the opera house hosted 111 plays during Tibbits' management, the majority of which was comedy. Dramas also hit the stage such as the Shakespeare favorites Richard III, Romeo and Juliet, and Macbeth. Also popular was the oft performed Uncle Tom's Cabin, which nonetheless drew heavy criticism from local reviewers.

[...] However, it also implies a social cause (a view supported by historians such as Guy and Fletcher). [...] That later demands included limiting the size of households belonging to the gentry – theoretically beneficial in a time of population growth and unemployment – possibly suggests an attack on the prestige of the gentry. [...] Certainly such contemporaries as Thomas Cranmer took this view, condemning the rebels for deliberately inciting a class conflict by their demands: [...] "to diminish their strength and to take away their friends, that you might command gentlemen at your pleasures". Protector Somerset himself saw dislike of the gentry as a common factor in all of the 1549 rebellions: [...] "indeed all hath conceived a wonderful hate against the gentlemen and taketh them all as their enemies." ...|$|E
