5|$|On November 11 Hans Shack and {{his forces}} boarded Dutch {{transport}} ships {{to take them}} to the east side of Funen. After some false starts, due to weather and Swedish resistance, he managed to land near Kerteminde. General-Major Ernst Albrecht von Eberstein {{was in charge of the}} <b>allied</b> <b>forces</b> that had been left on Jutland, and was also moving towards Funen; landfall was made two days later without any Swedish resistance. Both Eberstein and Schack marched towards Odense, meeting up on November 12. So far, the invasion of Funen was going smoothly for the combined Danish and <b>allied</b> <b>forces.</b>|$|E

The newly activated Allied Land Command (LANDCOM), located in Izmir, Turkey, has assumed responsibilities from <b>Allied</b> <b>Force</b> Command Heidelberg in Germany as well as <b>Allied</b> <b>Force</b> Command Madrid in Spain.

5|$|The Japanese army {{advanced}} swiftly southward {{through the}} Malay Peninsula, crushing or bypassing Allied resistance. The <b>Allied</b> <b>forces</b> {{did not have}} tanks, which they considered unsuitable in the tropical rainforest, and their infantry proved powerless against the Japanese light tanks. As their resistance failed against the Japanese advance, the <b>Allied</b> <b>forces</b> were forced to retreat southwards towards Singapore. By 31 January 1942, a mere 55 days {{after the start of}} the invasion, the Japanese had conquered the entire Malay Peninsula and were poised to attack Singapore.|$|E
5|$|According to Moyzisch, the German Foreign Office did {{not make}} much use of the documents, because {{officers}} there were divided about their reliability for several reasons. There was {{a steady stream of}} documents, which was highly unusual. Cicero seemed to have used sophisticated photography techniques to create unusually clear images, which raised the question of whether he acted alone. Antipathy between Papen and Ribbentrop added to the ineffective analysis of the intelligence. Aware of the <b>Allied</b> <b>forces</b> attempts to bring Turkey into the war, however, Papen was able to thwart their efforts for a time by threatening to destroy İzmir and Istanbul if Turkey declared war against Germany. Being able to postpone Turkey's alliance with the <b>Allied</b> <b>forces</b> and the use of their airfields, Papen told Ribbentrop that the way was now clear to take the Balkans.|$|E

For some recipients, it might have been necessary for them to return their NATO Medal before accepting the <b>Allied</b> <b>Force</b> bar.|$|R

5|$|General Douglas MacArthur was {{appointed}} as the Supreme Commander, Southwest Pacific Area, on its creation on 18 April 1942. He created five subordinate commands: <b>Allied</b> Land <b>Forces,</b> <b>Allied</b> Air <b>Forces,</b> <b>Allied</b> Naval <b>Forces,</b> United States Army Forces in Australia (USAFIA), and the United States Army Forces in the Philippines. The last command disappeared when Corregidor surrendered on 6 May 1942, while USAFIA became the United States Army Services of Supply, Southwest Pacific Area (USASOS SWPA). In 1943, United States Army Forces in the Far East was reformed and assumed responsibility for administration, leaving USASOS as a purely logistical agency. Both were swept {{away in a}} reorganisation in 1945. The other three commands, <b>Allied</b> Land <b>Forces,</b> <b>Allied</b> Air <b>Forces</b> and <b>Allied</b> Naval <b>Forces,</b> remained until SWPA was abolished on 2 September 1945.|$|R
40|$|NATO's {{intervention}} in Kosovo in 1999 (Operation <b>Allied</b> <b>Force)</b> {{is one of}} the seminal events in contemporary international relations. While the humanitarian aspect of this intervention was widely endorsed the dominant view is that NATO acted illegally. Many who acknowledged this illegality, however, argued that because Operation <b>Allied</b> <b>Force</b> had so emphatically illustrated deficiencies with the existing legal regime that legal reform would subsequently follow. This article examines whether 10 years on Operation <b>Allied</b> <b>Force</b> can be considered a legal precedent. It is argued that while Operation <b>Allied</b> <b>Force</b> was unquestionably of significant political importance it does not constitute a legal precedent. While the intervention sparked much legal debate it did not did not lead to any significant addition or amendment to positive law nor does it constitute a precedent for customary international law...|$|R

5|$|<b>Allied</b> <b>forces</b> sent {{to disarm}} the Japanese and {{repatriate}} {{prisoners of war}} arrived in Indonesia in September 1945. In Semarang, {{this led to a}} conflict between Japanese forces and Indonesian rebels, that began on 15October; the Indonesians aimed to confiscate the Japanese weapons. <b>Allied</b> <b>forces</b> began landing in the city on 20October 1945; a small group was sent to Gedangan to speak with Soegijapranata. Concerned with civilian suffering, the vicar apostolic told the Allies that they must stop the battle; the Allies could not comply as they did not know the Japanese commander. Soegijapranata then contacted the Japanese and, that afternoon, brokered a cease-fire agreement in his office at Gedangan, despite Indonesian forces' firing at the Gurkha soldiers posted in front of the building.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 4,000 Royalist {{soldiers}} had been killed, {{many in the}} last stand of the whitecoats, and 1,500 captured, including Lucas and Tillier.

During <b>Allied</b> <b>Force</b> the 23d flew over 1000 combat sorties and fired 191 HARM shots to silence over 100 surface-to-air missile sites in Kosovo and Yugoslavia. The squadron was repeatedly noted for bravery in the face of danger while flying these combat operations in <b>Allied</b> <b>Force.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1999 {{the former}} Republic of Yugoslavia sought {{to reclaim the}} region of Kosovo, and {{this led to a}} period of “ethnic cleansing.” When Yugoslavia failed to comply with {{provisions}} of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1199 and continued its ethnic cleansing operations, NATO, led by the United States, began Operation <b>Allied</b> <b>Force.</b> <b>Allied</b> <b>Force</b> focused on bombing key Yugoslavian targets in an effort to persuade President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia to comply with UN resolutions. In support of <b>Allied</b> <b>Force,</b> the 86th AW flew 396 missions carrying 3,000 tons of cargo and 1,492 passengers to various destinations within the European theater.|$|R
5|$|Following the Allies' May 1945 victory, the Soviets {{effectively}} occupied Central and Eastern Europe, while strong US and Western <b>allied</b> <b>forces</b> {{remained in}} Western Europe.

5|$|In March 2005, British Foreign and Commonwealth Office historians issued The Cicero Papers, an {{analysis}} of the potential consequences of the 'Cicero Affair'.

5|$|Meanwhile, Caxias had {{organized}} {{an assault on}} the new Paraguayan defenses which López had thrown up along the Pikysyry, south of Asunción (Paraguay's capital). This stream afforded a strong defensive position which was anchored by the Paraguay River and by the swampy jungle of the Chaco region. Caxias had a road cut through the supposedly impenetrable Chaco, located {{on the other side of}} the Paraguayan River where the Allied army was camped. The Brazilian ships carried the Allied troops across the river, where they moved over the road which had been finished in December. The <b>Allied</b> <b>forces</b> outflanked the Paraguayan lines and attacked from the rear. The combined <b>allied</b> <b>forces</b> annihilated the Paraguayan army and on 1 January 1869 Asunción was occupied.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon {{was hoping}} that the <b>Allied</b> <b>forces</b> would attack, and to {{encourage}} them, he deliberately weakened his right flank.
