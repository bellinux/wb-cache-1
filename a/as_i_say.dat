500|$|As {{late as the}} Siege of Charleston in 1780, Loyalists {{could still}} believe in their {{eventual}} victory, as British troops inflicted heavy defeats on the Continental forces at the Battle of Camden and the Battle of Guilford Court House. In late 1781, the news of Lord Cornwallis's surrender at the Siege of Yorktown reached London; Lord North's parliamentary support ebbed away and he resigned the following year. The King drafted an abdication notice, which was never delivered, finally accepted the defeat in North America, and authorised peace negotiations. The Treaties of Paris, by which Britain recognised {{the independence of the}} American states and returned Florida to Spain, were signed in 1782 and 1783. When John Adams was appointed American Minister to London in 1785, George had become resigned to the new relationship between his country and the former colonies. He told Adams, [...] "I was the last to consent to the separation; but the separation having been made and having become inevitable, I have always said, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> now, that I {{would be the first to}} meet the friendship of the United States as an independent power." ...|$|E
500|$|Stockhausen's two early Electronic Studies (especially the second) had a {{powerful}} influence on the subsequent development of electronic music in the 1950s and 1960s, particularly {{in the work of}} the Italian Franco Evangelisti and the Poles Andrzej Dobrowolski and Włodzimierz Kotoński [...] The influence of his Kontra-Punkte, Zeitmasse and Gruppen may be seen in the work of many composers, including Igor Stravinsky's Threni (1957–58) and Movements for piano and orchestra (1958–59) and other works up to the Variations: Aldous Huxley In Memoriam (1963–64), whose rhythms [...] "are likely to have been inspired, at least in part, by certain passages from Stockhausen's Gruppen" [...] Though music of Stockhausen's generation may seem an unlikely influence, Stravinsky said in a 1957 conversation: I have all around me the spectacle of composers who, after their generation has had its decade of influence and fashion, seal themselves off from further development and from the next generation (<b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> this, exceptions come to mind, Krenek, for instance). Of course, it requires greater effort to learn from one's juniors, and their manners are not invariably good. But when you are seventy-five and your generation has overlapped with four younger ones, it behooves you not to decide in advance [...] "how far composers can go," [...] but to try to discover whatever new thing it is makes the new generation new.|$|E

Sure it was.|$|E
2500|$|Paul McCartney {{commented on}} Wilson's bass lines: [...] "If {{you were in}} the key of C, you would {{normally}} use–the root note would be, like, a C on the bass ... Brian would be using notes that weren't the obvious notes to use. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> 'the G if you're in C–that kind of thing. And [...] also [...] melodies in the bass line." ...|$|E
2500|$|Draco is the prototypical spoiled, rich brat; he {{believes}} that his family's wealth and social position gives him the right to bully those poorer than himself, such as Ron Weasley. He also insults Hermione Granger's Muggle-born status by referring {{to her as a}} [...] "Mudblood", a term that, as stated by Hagrid, is one not used in civilised conversations.

2500|$|As Tommy {{walked back}} to his corner after shaking Louis' hand, I {{followed}} him and seized his glove. [...] "Tommy, a wonderful perform—" [...] I began... Then I dropped his hand like a red-hot coal! He had started to raise his arm. He thought I {{had given him the}} fight and the world championship! I literally ran away, shaking my head and shouting. [...] "No! No! No!" [...] realising how I had raised his hopes for a few seconds only to dash them to the ground... That's the last time my emotions will get the better of me in a prize fight! There was much booing at the announced result, but, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> it, it was all emotional. I gave Tommy two rounds and one even—and both his winning rounds were close.|$|E
2500|$|... rom my {{knowledge}} of the IDF and from {{the extent to which}} I have been following the current operation, I don’t think there has ever been a {{time in the history of}} warfare when any army has made more efforts to reduce civilian casualties and deaths of innocent people than the IDF is doing today in Gaza... Hamas, the enemy they have been fighting, has been trained extensively by Iran and by Hezbollah, to fight among the people, to use the civilian population in Gaza as a human shield... Hamas factor in the uses of the population as a major part of their defensive plan. So even though <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> Israel, the IDF, has taken enormous steps...to reduce civilian casualties, it is impossible, it is impossible to stop that happening when the enemy has been using civilians as human shields.|$|E
2500|$|Roger Casement, {{writing to}} a {{consular}} colleague in Lisbon on August 3, 1903 from Lake Mantumba in the Congo Free State, said: [...] "The people round here are all cannibals. You never saw such a weird looking lot in your life. There are also dwarfs (called Batwas) {{in the forest}} who are even worse cannibals than the taller human environment. They eat man flesh raw! It's a fact." [...] Casement then added how assailants would [...] "bring down a dwarf on the way home, for the marital cooking pot... The Dwarfs, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> dispense with cooking pots and eat and drink their human prey fresh cut on the battlefield while the blood is still warm and running. These are not fairy tales my dear Cowper but actual gruesome reality {{in the heart of}} this poor, benighted savage land." ...|$|E

2500|$|I {{think it}} is well also for {{the man in the}} street to realise that there is no power on earth that can protect him from being bombed. Whatever people may tell him, the bomber will always get through, The only defence is in offence, which means that you have to kill more women and {{children}} more quickly than the enemy if you want to save yourselves...If the conscience of the young men should ever come to feel, with regard to this one instrument [...] that it is evil and should go, the thing will be done; but if they do not feel like that – well, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> the future is in their hands. But when the next war comes, and European civilisation is wiped out, as it will be, and by no force more than that force, then do not let them lay blame on the old men. Let them remember that they, principally, or they alone, are responsible for the terrors that have fallen upon the earth.|$|E
2500|$|In his {{tramping}} days, he did {{domestic work}} for a time. His extreme politeness was recalled {{by a member of}} the family he worked for; she declared that the family referred to him as [...] "Laurel" [...] after the film comedian. With his gangling figure and awkwardness, Orwell's friends often saw him as a figure of fun. Geoffrey Gorer commented [...] "He was awfully likely to knock things off tables, trip over things. I mean, he was a gangling, physically badly co-ordinated young man. I think his feeling [...] that even the inanimate world was against him..." [...] When he shared a flat with Heppenstall and Sayer, he was treated in a patronising manner by the younger men. At the BBC, in the 1940s, [...] "everybody would pull his leg," [...] and Spender described him as having real entertainment value [...] "like, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> watching a Charlie Chaplin movie." [...] A friend of Eileen's reminisced about her tolerance and humour, often at Orwell's expense. Psychiatrist Michael Fitzgerald has speculated that Orwell's social and physical awkwardness, limited interests and monotone voice were the result of Asperger syndrome.|$|E
