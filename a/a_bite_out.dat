As Lugaid has lost a hand, Conall fights him with one hand tucked into his belt, but he only beats him after his horse takes <b>a</b> <b>bite</b> <b>out</b> of Lugaid's side. He also kills Erc, and takes his head back to Tara, where Erc's sister Achall dies of grief for her brother.|$|E
25|$|When {{they get}} back to the classroom, they wordlessly return to their cages, and their hats and capes come off. The Flyboat also disassembles by itself. Ming-Ming is always the first one to get back in her cage, Tuck is always the second, and Linny is always the last. A music style having to do with that day's rescue is played, as Linny takes <b>a</b> <b>bite</b> <b>out</b> of the celery in her cage and winks towards the camera as the closing credits begin.|$|E

Fanged Frisbees are quite literally normal Frisbees with fangs and are first mentioned in Goblet of Fire as one of Filch's newest restricted items during Dumbledore's start-of-term speech. However, they make their first appearance in Half-Blood Prince when Ron whirled one around the Gryffindor common room, it changed course with {{a mind of its}} own, and took <b>a</b> <b>bite</b> <b>out</b> of a tapestry. Most of these objects are banned at Hogwarts due to the possibility of injury.|$|E

500|$|.....Bane {{managed to}} capture {{much of the}} ex-mayor's character: Her eyes are {{friendly}} and her hair as wild as ever. But Katz's signature grin is a little stiff, a little too aggressive. Leaning forward, she looks {{as if she might}} take <b>a</b> <b>bite</b> <b>out</b> of the next passerby. Which by the way, seems appropriate when you look back on her days behind the mayoral desk. Maybe monochromatic bronze just isn't the right medium for a woman as colorful as ol' Vera. Where's the red blazer? Our suggestion: Get this lady some accessories! The right hat or scarf could make that brown pantsuit really work.|$|E

I feel like in a past life I was a lion or a cat or something." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Comedy Central did {{not object}} to most aspects of the episode, they did require some edits to {{material}} they deemed potentially offensive. During rehearsal for a Nativity play, a baby Jesus resembling a fetus pops out of Wendy, who is playing the Virgin Mary, and is caught by Kyle, who is portraying Joseph of Nazareth. Although the scene was ultimately kept in the episode, Comedy Central executives had problems with it and Parker said they had to handle its animation [...] "very carefully". Additionally, during filming of the live-action Mr. Hankey commercial, the baby originally held the Mr. Hankey stool and took <b>a</b> <b>bite</b> <b>out</b> of it. Comedy Central officials would not allow {{the scene in the}} episode and it was changed to portray the idea that the baby had already eaten the stool off-camera, which Parker said he felt was actually funnier.|$|E

500|$|The primary {{race was}} bitter. Miller called McEwen [...] "Pinocchio," [...] and McEwen said of Miller, [...] "His misrepresentations and falsehoods are gargantuan. I {{tried to be}} his best friend in the delegation. I am deeply {{disappointed}} at the meanness of his effort." [...] Tom Deimer of Cleveland's Plain Dealer wrote that the two candidates were largely identical on the issues: [...] "both are textbook Republican conservatives, opposed to abortion, gun control, high taxes, and costly government programs — unless located in their districts." [...] Miller noted he had no overdrafts at the House bank, saying, [...] "the score is 166 to nothing." [...] McEwen said [...] "every one of my checks was free and clear. Every month's statement had a balance." [...] McEwen ran commercials against Miller claiming the long-time congressman [...] "has fallen {{out of touch with}} Ohio" [...] and [...] "doesn't live in our district and isn't even registered to vote here." [...] Miller struck back in a live-television interview by taking a Wheat Thin, claiming it to be McEwen, and then taking <b>a</b> <b>bite</b> <b>out</b> of it.|$|E
500|$|The Red Sox {{held their}} World Series victory parade on the {{following}} Saturday, October 30. The team was transported around on 17 duck boats equipped with loudspeakers so the players could talk to the spectators. Due to large interest in the parade, it was lengthened by officials the day before to include the Charles River, so that fans could watch from the Boston and Cambridge river banks. The parade did not however, include a staged rally. The parade began at 10a.m. local time at Fenway Park, turned east onto Boylston Street, then west onto Tremont Street and Storrow Drive before entering the river. One of the lanes on Massachusetts Avenue had to be closed to accommodate {{members of the media}} filming the parade as it passed under the Harvard Bridge. Ramírez was handed a sign by one of the spectators part of the way through the parade, which read, [...] "Jeter is playing golf today. This is better!" [...] He held on to this sign {{for the rest of the}} parade, in a similar way to what Tug McGraw said after the Philadelphia Phillies won the 1980 World Series, [...] "For once, we take <b>a</b> <b>bite</b> <b>out</b> of the Big Apple". Over three million people were estimated to have attended the parade, making it the largest gathering ever in the city of Boston.|$|E
2500|$|Demeter {{holds the}} bizarre {{distinction}} of being the only major leaguer on record to field an apple. There was a game during his tenure with the Phillies where Demeter had missed several defensive plays at 3rd base. The fans were upset and booing loudly, even prompting one overzealous fan to throw an apple onto the field. Demeter recalled, [...] "I'd made two errors and here came an apple sailing out of the stands." [...] He continued, [...] "So I just picked it up, took <b>a</b> <b>bite</b> <b>out</b> of it and the booing stopped." ...|$|E

50|$|Blethen, who had false {{teeth and}} {{would put them}} {{in his back pocket}} when he was running the bases, only reached base once in his big-league career — in 1923 with the Red Sox.

2500|$|In Plants vs. Zombies, players place {{different}} types of plants and fungi, each with their own unique offensive or defensive capabilities, around a house, {{in order to stop}} a horde of zombies from reaching the house of the residents. The playing field is divided into 5 to 6 horizontal lanes, and with rare exceptions, a zombie will only move towards the player's house along one lane (the main exception is if it has taken <b>a</b> <b>bite</b> <b>out</b> of a garlic). Planting costs [...] "sun", which can be gathered for free (albeit slowly) during daytime levels and by planting certain plants or fungi. Most plants can only attack or defend against zombies in the lane they are planted in. In later levels, players can purchase upgrades with different offensive and defensive abilities.|$|E

Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album a positive review, calling it [...] "a return to the full-throttled attack of Three Dollar Bill Y'All". Metal Hammer writer Terry Bezer wrote, [...] "Aside from the odd duff moment, Gold Cobra throws out the hot shit that’ll make you bounce in the mosh pit over and over again." ...|$|E

Investigators reported that the victim had a tattoo of a heart-shaped peach with <b>a</b> <b>bite</b> <b>out</b> of it and two drips falling from its core on her left breast.

2500|$|The burger {{came at a}} {{point in}} the {{industry}} where fast casual restaurants were beginning to take <b>a</b> <b>bite</b> <b>out</b> of the industry as a whole. Burger King, and other chains, at first had not taken chains such as Five Guys and Smashburger as serious competition. Additionally, convenience stores such as 7-11 were also expanding their in-store foods with cheaper hot foods that challenged {{the lower end of the}} market. These two market trends had the effect of shaving sales from both ends of the menu, challenging the concept of the barbell strategy. As the chains tried to fight the encroachment of the competition from outside fast food industry, McDonald's and Wendy's chose to focus on their menus while Burger King focused its advertising on younger-skewing [...] "superfan". The result was that the other two chains' sales grew by 26% and 9% percent respectively, while Burger King’s remained flat.|$|E
2500|$|Lynch {{also added}} new characters, like Mr. Reindeer and Sherilyn Fenn as {{the victim of}} a car accident. During rehearsals, Lynch began talking about Elvis Presley and Marilyn Monroe with Cage and Dern. The {{director}} acquired a copy of Elvis' Golden Records and after listening to it, called Cage and told him that he had to sing two songs, [...] "Love Me" [...] and [...] "Love Me Tender". The actor agreed and recorded them so that he could lip-synch to them on the set. At one point, Cage called Lynch and asked if he could wear a snakeskin jacket in the film and Lynch incorporated it into his script. Before filming started, Dern suggested that she and Cage go on a weekend road trip to Las Vegas in order to bond and get a handle on their characters. Dern remembers, [...] "We agreed that Sailor and Lula needed to be one person, one character, and we would each share it. I got the sexual, wild, Marilyn, gum-chewing fantasy, female side; Nick’s got the snakeskin, Elvis, raw, combustible, masculine side". Within four months, Lynch began filming on August 9, 1989 in both Los Angeles (including the San Fernando Valley) and New Orleans with a relatively modest budget of $10 million. Originally, the film featured more explicit erotic scenes between Sailor and Lula. In one, she has an orgasm while relating to Sailor a dream she had of being ripped open by a wild animal. Another deleted scene had Lula lowering herself onto Sailor's face saying, [...] "Take <b>a</b> <b>bite</b> <b>out</b> of Lula".|$|E
2500|$|The 100 Acre Wood {{rally in}} Salem, Missouri, started {{the season with}} Gene Henderson and Jim Kloosterman placing their SX/4 second in the Production Class and seventh overall.

At the next event, the Olympus International, Henderson and Kloosterman was an early leader, but retired with a blown engine in his AMC Eagle SX/4; however, Gene's son, Garry Henderson, in another SX/4 with co-driver Mike Van Leo, placed second in the Production Class and sixth overall. The inaugural three-day Michigan International rally should have been easy for the AMC Eagle SX/4, but [...] "several of the very sandy stages that would have been to Henderson's advantage were cancelled" [...] so with co-driver Jon Wickens, the team finished second in the Production Class and tenth overall. The next event with the SX/4 was the Manistee Trails rally in Michigan, where Henderson and Kloosterman won the Production class and finished fifth overall. At the November Press-on-Regardless rally, Henderson was [...] "dominating things in the early going until a big rock took <b>a</b> <b>bite</b> <b>out</b> of the AMC Eagle's transfer case putting it out of the rally."
