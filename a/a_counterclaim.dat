5|$|A {{new trial}} is {{scheduled}} for March 2014, in which Apple will seek to prevent Samsung from selling some of its current devices in the U.S. The case will involve further debate over monetary compensation. In the 2014 lawsuit, Samsung is accused of infringing five of Apple Inc.'s patents in 10 phone and tablet models, while Samsung has responded with <b>a</b> <b>counterclaim,</b> in which it states that two patents for nine phones and tablets have been infringed on by Apple. Jury selection for the trial occurred on March 31, 2014. Samsung stands to gain $6 million if the jury rules in its favor, while Apple is seeking $2 billion in damages and could proceed with similar lawsuits against other Android handset makers, as the relevant patent issues extend beyond Samsung's software technology.|$|E
5|$|Lesnar had {{previously}} signed a non-compete clause {{in order to}} be released from his contract with WWE, which prohibited him from working for any other professional wrestling companies before June 2010. However, he decided to challenge this ruling in court. WWE responded with <b>a</b> <b>counterclaim</b> after Lesnar breached the agreement by appearing at a New Japan Pro-Wrestling show in 2004. In July 2005, the two sides dropped their claims and entered negotiations to renew their relationship. WWE had offered Lesnar a contract, but on August 2, their official website reported that Lesnar had withdrawn from any involvement with the company. The lawsuit began to enter settlement talks on September 21, but did not get solved.|$|E
5|$|Garland's {{history with}} CBS {{prior to the}} series was a {{checkered}} one. She had previously headlined several specials for the network. The first was the inaugural episode of the Ford Star Jubilee which aired in 1955. The special, the first full-scale color telecast on CBS, was a ratings triumph, garnering a 34.8 Nielsen rating. This success led to Garland's signing a three-year, $300,000 contract with the network. Only a single special aired, a live General Electric Theater episode in 1956, before the pact was terminated. The relationship between CBS and Garland and her then-husband and manager, Sid Luft, dissolved in acrimony in 1957 after they and agent Freddie Fields were unable {{to come to terms}} with the network over the format of her next special. Garland filed a US$1.4 million lawsuit against CBS for libel and breach of contract (CBS filed <b>a</b> <b>counterclaim)</b> that was not settled until 1961, when Garland and CBS each agreed to drop their claims and negotiations began for a new round of Garland specials for the network.|$|E

40|$|Even in {{the absence}} of an {{applicable}} statute or court rule, failure to assert <b>an</b> available <b>counterclaim</b> precludes bringing <b>a</b> subsequent action thereon if granting relief would nullify the judgment in the initial action. This so-called common-law compulsory counterclaim rule emerges from the intuitive principle of claim preclusion that a valid and final judgment generally precludes the defendant from later asserting mere defenses to the claim. The implicit extension of this idea is that once a plaintiff obtains a judgment, the defendant generally cannot bring a new action to undo the judgment by reopening the plaintiff’s claim and pushing those defenses. The evident rationale is that claim preclusion simply must apply when the effect of the defendant’s collaterally asserted defense would be to nullify the earlier judgment for the plaintiff. This implicit barrier to collateral attack may seem to occupy some arcane corner of the specialty of res judicata. But the common-law compulsory counterclaim rule in fact is critical to any judicial system. That is, although it is intuitive, it is also important. The rule applies whether or not the prior judgment was by default; the rule indeed is especially important because it works to guarantee that even default judgments mean something and cannot normally be undone by later litigation. The rule applies whether or not <b>a</b> compulsory <b>counterclaim</b> statute or rule of court exists; that fact explains why its very name declares it to be a common-law doctrine. This article takes a wide view of the rule’s purposes and development to determine the rule’s proper scope...|$|R

500|$|According to Robert Mahony, the Drapier's Letters, {{especially}} the fourth, were later praised by Irish nationalists. However, as he continued, many recent critics have re-examined this nationalistic claim and asserted <b>a</b> <b>counterclaim</b> that Swift is speaking {{more for the}} Protestants of Ireland than for the entire nation. Many critics, including Carol Fabricant, have asked who [...] "the Whole People of Ireland" [...] are, [...] "who" [...] the Drapier's Letters are speaking [...] "to", and if Swift has the right, as a Protestant Englishman, {{to speak for the}} entire nation. R. F. Foster believes that Swift represented [...] "Ascendancy attitudes," [...] but this view is not held by all. Some critics, like Joep Leerssen, believe that Swift's work contributed greatly to a common Irish nationalism regardless of religious affiliation, and that Swift was able to relate to all of Ireland through a unified suffering under the British rule. In overall effect, Fabricant argued that Swift's ability to speak for the whole populace is further suggested by the wide consensus opposed to the coinage plan. Along with this, Swift was able to rhetorically extend natural rights, in the Drapier's Letters, to all people of Ireland without any regard to restriction.|$|E
