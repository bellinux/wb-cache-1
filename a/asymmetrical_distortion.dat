This theoretical explanation {{is based on}} behavior models of memristors representing the interrelation between terminated voltages and currents. The simulated single-tone and two-tone signal spectrums for extremely low-frequency (Hz) and microwave (GHz) applications verify our proposed mathematical approach and the new discovery of <b>asymmetrical</b> PIM <b>distortions.</b> This presented method provides an innovative choice to model and simulate the external performance of circuits and systems with <b>asymmetrical</b> PIM <b>distortions</b> in the future...|$|R

40|$|Pierre Curie (1859 ^ 1906) had the {{creative}} curiosity {{of a great}} physicist. Distinguished for his discovery of piezoelectricity, now the heart of quartz crystal watches beating more regularly than Galileo's pendulum, he is known more reconditely for Curie's Principle of symmetries and asymmetries. His lasting fame is ensured from transmuting, by marriage, Marie Sk•odowska into Madame Curieödiscoverer, with Pierre's help, of the most curious of all the elements, radium. Pierre was {{professor of physics at}} the Sorbonne, his Chair going to Marie, when he died from an accident with a cart carrying military uniforms. Curie's Principle, may be stated: Symmetry cannot produce systematic asymmetry. Asymmetry can occur once-off. Thus a stone will break a window in a jagged irregular pattern, but, when repeated, the pattern will vary and on average will be symmetrical. Yet, and this is what I will discuss, some symmetrical illusion figures show <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>distortions.</b> Can illusions of perception flout such a basic principle of physics?

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a rigorous way {{to quantify the}} role played by higher baseband impedances in determining baseband electrical memory effects observed in power transistors under two-carrier excitation. These effects typically appear not only as <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>distortion</b> terms in the frequency domain, but also more reliably as a recognizeable hysteresis or looping in the dynamic transfer characteristics extracted from measured input voltage and output current envelopes of a power device. Investigations have been carried out using a commercially available 10 W GaN HEMT device characterised at 2 GHz within a high-power modulated wavefor measurement system. Active IF loadpull has been employed to present specific baseband impedance environments, allowing the sensitivity of IMD symmetry to baseband impedance variations to be investigated...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Because {{the number}} of {{applications}} for medical ultrasonic devices continue to increase and, hence, {{the number of}} diagnostic ultrasound (US) systems increase, {{there is a need}} to reliably characterize the sources in terms of their output pressures. Currently, the transducers are characterized by making pressure measurements in water for every voltage range applied to the source and, then, linearly derate the measured pressure values to estimate the derated acoustic pressure levels. The process is time-consuming and inaccuracies are introduced in the derating process due to nonlinear effects. Therefore, {{there is a need to}} find an indicator of nonlinearity that could classify the measured pressure waveform as either linear, where the derating procedure would yield an accurate derated acoustic pressure estimate, or nonlinear, where the derating process would fail. Eight different indicators of nonlinearity were evaluated experimentally using spherically focused US transducers. The trans-ducers were selected to test the indicator sensitivity to frequency (3 to 8 MHz), f-number (1 and 2), and transducer diameter (1. 905 and 5. 08 cm). Sensitivity to drive voltage conditions was also tested by exciting one of the transducers with pulses of different duration and phase. None of the eight nonlinearity indicators yielded consistent results. The lack of consistency resulted from the competing effects of nonlinear absorption and <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>distortion,</b> which have yet to be combined into a unified theory. (E-mail...|$|E
40|$|We {{demonstrated}} {{a method for}} the measurement of signed frequency offset between optical source and delay interferometer (DI) for 10 Gb/s DPSK signals based on asynchronous delay-tap sampling technique with a chromatic dispersion (CD) offset. The demodulated DPSK signals show asymmetrical property and amplitude shoulder appears on the waveforms with frequency offset and a fixed CD offset together. The delay-tap sampling scatter plots also show the asymmetry related to the <b>asymmetrical</b> signal <b>distortion.</b> Our proposed method cannot only realize the measurement {{of the magnitude of}} frequency offset but also the polarity. The measurement range is from − 2 GHz to + 2 GHz and the sensitivity can reach ± 100 MHz. The simulation and experimental results are {{demonstrated a}}nd in good agreement.

25|$|Typically a TEM {{consists}} of three stages of lensing. The stages are the condenser lenses, the objective lenses, and the projector lenses. The condenser lenses are responsible for primary beam formation, while the objective lenses focus the beam that comes through the sample itself (in STEM scanning mode, there are also objective lenses above the sample to make the incident electron beam convergent). The projector lenses are used to expand the beam onto the phosphor screen or other imaging device, such as film. The magnification of the TEM {{is due to the}} ratio of the distances between the specimen and the objective lens' image plane. Additional stigmators allow for the correction of <b>asymmetrical</b> beam <b>distortions,</b> known as astigmatism. It is noted that TEM optical configurations differ significantly with implementation, with manufacturers using custom lens configurations, such as in spherical aberration corrected instruments, or TEMs using energy filtering to correct electron chromatic aberration.|$|R
40|$|A bimanual circle drawing {{task was}} {{employed}} to elucidate the dynamics of intralimb and interlimb coordination. Right-handed subjects were required to produce circles with both hands in either a symmetrical (mirror) mode (i. e. one hand moving clockwise, the other counter-clockwise) or in an asymmetrical mode (i. e. both hands moving clockwise or counter-clockwise). The frequency of movement was scaled by an auditory metronome from 1. 50 Hz to 3. 25 Hz in 8 (8 -sec) steps. In the <b>asymmetrical</b> mode, <b>distortions</b> of the movement trajectories, transient departures from the target pattern of coordination, and phase wandering were evident as movement frequency was increased. These features suggested loss of stability. Deviations from circular trajectories were most prominent for movements of the left hand. Transient departures from the required mode of coordination were also largely precipitated by the left hand. The results are discussed with reference to manual asymmetries and mechanisms of interlimb and intersegmental coordination...|$|R
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{an investigation}} of zoom lens calibration, with emphasis {{on the effects of}} lens-image-plane misalignment. Measurements have been made of the photogrammetric principal point and radial (symmetrical) and decentering (<b>asymmetrical)</b> <b>distortion</b> components {{as a function of the}} principal distance (zoom setting) of several zoom lenses. Data were also taken with the axis of symmetry (optical axis) of a zoom lens aligned and misaligned to the same solid-state video camera. An explanation is offered regarding the variation of the principal point as a function of zoom setting based on these measurements. In addition the relationship of the decentering distortion to radial distortion, principal distance, and lens-image-plane misalignment angle is discussed. A technique for determining the proper point of symmetry to be used for distortion computations (as opposed to the principal point) is also suggested. A simple technique for measuring the misalignment angle of zoom lenses when attached to video cameras is presented, along with measurements for seven solid-state cameras. A method to reduce the additional error introduced by zoom lens misalignment is presented. The implications of this study are that special measures to properly align a zoom lens to the sensor image plane are probably not necessary, but that as the accuracy obtainable in digital photogrammetry approaches the 0. 01 or less pixel level, additional calibration including the point of symmetry for distortion computation should be considered...|$|E
40|$|Inspection of {{and around}} joints, beams, and other {{three-dimensional}} structures {{is integral to}} practical nondestructive evaluation of large structures. Non-contact, scanning laser ultrasound techniques offer an automated means of physically accessing these regions. However, to realize the benefits of laser-scanning techniques, simultaneous inspection of multiple surfaces at different orientations to the scanner must not significantly degrade the signal level nor diminish the ability to distinguish defects from healthy geometric features. In this study, we evaluated the implementation of acoustic wavenumber spectroscopy for inspecting metal joints and crossbeams from interior angles. With this technique, we used a single-tone, steady-state, ultrasonic excitation to excite the joints via a single transducer attached to one surface. We then measured the full-field velocity responses using a scanning Laser Doppler vibrometer and produced maps of local wavenumber estimates. With the high signal level associated with steady-state excitation, scans could be performed at surface orientations of up to 45 degrees. Since projection leads to <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>distortion</b> in the wavenumber in one direction, while plate thinning produces a symmetric increase in wavenumber, {{we were able to}} independently estimate both the orientations of the scanned surfaces and the degree of hidden corrosion. With both a two-surface joint and a three-surface joint test specimen, we were able to automatically remove the projection of each angled surface in the scan area and generate corrosion-indicating wavenumber maps for those surfaces as if they all were scanned from normal incidence...|$|E
40|$|Diagenetic {{distortion}} {{can be a}} {{major obstacle}} to collecting quantitative shape data on paleontological specimens, especially for three-dimensional geometric morphometric analysis. Here we utilize the recently -published algorithmic symmetrization method of fossil reconstruction and {{compare it to the}} more traditional reflection 2 ̆ 6 averaging approach. In order to have an objective test of this method, five casts of a female cranium of Papio hamadryas kindae were manually deformed while the plaster hardened. These were subsequently “retrodeformed” using both algorithmic symmetrization and reflection 2 ̆ 6 averaging and then compared to the original, undeformed specimen. We found that in all cases, algorithmic retrodeformation improved the shape of the deformed cranium and in four out of five cases, the algorithmically symmetrized crania were more similar in shape to the original crania than the reflected 2 ̆ 6 averaged reconstructions. In three out of five cases, the difference between the algorithmically symmetrized crania and the original cranium could be contained within the magnitude of variation among individuals in a single subspecies of Papio. Instances of asymmetric distortion, such as breakage on one side, or bending in the axis of symmetry, were well handled, whereas symmetrical distortion remained uncorrected. This technique was further tested on a naturally deformed and fossilized cranium of Paradolichopithecus arvernensis. Results, based on a principal components analysis and Procrustes distances, showed that the algorithmically symmetrized Paradolichopithecus cranium was more similar to other, less-deformed crania from the same species than was the original. These results illustrate the efficacy of this method of retrodeformation by algorithmic symmetrization for the correction of <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>distortion</b> in fossils. Symmetrical distortion remains a problem for all currently developed methods of retrodeformation...|$|E

50|$|In 2000 the car {{went under}} a major rebuild {{due to the}} crash at Goodwood in 1999, and the car was {{acquired}} by Nicolaus Springer. During the restoration, the car was stripped and thoroughly checked. However, there was no chassis damaged, but needed major panel work repair. R S Williams asked Lawrence Kett of G&A fabrications to perform {{the restoration of the}} body shell. The repair was difficult as the car was not symmetrical, having been hand built and already showing signs of previous, body damage. It was also noted that the shell was becoming very brittle, being made of thin alloy and being over 40 years old. To add to that, the rear offside wing had been made from a different material, so may have already had some restoration completed on the shell. The restorers retained as much of the original bodywork as possible, reworking it if necessary. They worked from large blown up photographs to set about creating the old shape, complete with the original inaccuracies, <b>asymmetrical</b> dimensions and <b>distortions.</b>|$|R
40|$|We have {{performed}} Grazing Incidence X-Ray Di_raction (GIXRD), Near Edge Xray Absorption Fine Structure spectroscopy (NEXAFS), Helium Atom Scattering (HAS) and Electron Di_raction (LEED) measurements {{in order to}} investigate the structural properties of a very thin CuPc film on Au(110). All the data have been taken at the ALOISA beamline and its branchline HASPES at ELETTRA Synchrotron (Italy). Among the organic molecules of technological interest for their optical properties, CuPc is ideally suited to UHV studies for its thermal and chemical stability. Moreover, the strong structural anisotropy of a substrate such as the missing row reconstructed (1 x 2) -Au(110) can drive the orientation of a growing organic overlayer[1, 2]. We have observed in real time {{the early stages of}} deposition by using the HAS and LEED techniques. At a supposed coverage of 1 ML, the LEED spectra reveal a (5 x 3) phase, as recently reported [2]; less intense (5 x 7) phase features are also present. By monitoring the system at the same deposition stage with HAS, only a 5 x 7 pattern is measured instead. HAS is a more surface sensitive technique than electron di_raction; a model is proposed where the CuPc layer presents a x 7 periodicity along the [001] direction whereas CuPc molecules locally induce a x 3 reconstruction of the Au(110) substrate, whose high Z atoms cores have a larger scattering yield for electrons than low Z CuPc atoms. The x 3 substrate reconstruction has been confirmed and characterized in detail by means of GIXRD. The rodscans of six Au di_raction peaks have been taken(292 reflection measured). From the fit, the x 3 Au cell model and the atom displacements in the plane perpendicular to the close-packed Au atom rows direction have been obtained. The rod simulations suggest an <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>distortion</b> of the cell structure; two di_erent domains with an opposite orientation of the cell distortion are present.
