5|$|Silver City Airways {{moved to}} Lympne in 1948, {{operating}} Bristol Freighter Mk.21 aircraft and an aerial car ferry to Le Touquet started on 13 July 1948. The <b>air</b> <b>ferry</b> {{was the idea}} of Griffith J Powell, who wanted to holiday in France but did not like the ferry. Bristol lent an aircraft for an experiment on 7 July 1948. The first car was Powell's Armstrong Siddeley 16 which was carried by G-AGVC.The Bristol Freighter Mk.21 could carry two cars. Although only 170 cars were carried in 1948, experience was gained.|$|E
5|$|In February 1953, Lympne was {{waterlogged}} {{and services}} were temporarily transferred to Southend. In September waterlogging again stopped the <b>air</b> <b>ferry,</b> which {{was transferred to}} RAF West Malling. Six Bristol Freighter Mk.32s were introduced in March 1953, {{at a cost of}} £540,000, which could each carry three cars and a service to Ostend was started with the aircraft. Skyways remained at Lympne until October 1954 when it moved to Lydd (Ferryfield). On 3 October 1954, the last Silver City flight to Le Touquet was operated by Bristol Freighter G-AIFV. Silver City moved to Lydd because the runway at Lympne was not suitable. Although it had campaigned for improvements to the runway and was Lympne's biggest customer the airfields owners, the Ministry of Civil Aviation, refused. Silver City said it would build an airport suitable for its needs at Lydd.|$|E
5|$|Lympne {{returned}} to civilian use on 1 January 1946. In 1948, the first <b>air</b> <b>ferry</b> service was inaugurated at Lympne by Silver City Airways. Problems with waterlogging {{of the grass}} runway and the refusal of the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation to upgrade the airfield led to Silver City transferring operations to Lydd (Ferryfield) in 1954. By 1956, the airport's ownership had passed to Eric Rylands Ltd, the Skyways holding company. Skyways operated a coach-air service between London and Paris, flying passengers from Lympne to Beauvais. This service operated until 1974 (1955–1958: the original Skyways; 1958–1971: Skyways Coach-Air; 1971–1972: Skyways International; 1972–1974: Dan-Air Skyways). Following the cessation of commercial operations in October 1974, Lympne continued {{to be used as}} a General Aviation airfield until about 1984. The site is now an industrial estate.|$|E

5|$|Issued by MI6 with an Aston Martin DB Mark III, Bond trails Goldfinger as {{he takes}} his vintage Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost (adapted with armour plating and armour-plated glass) via <b>air</b> <b>ferry</b> to Switzerland, driven by Oddjob. Bond manages to trace Goldfinger to a {{warehouse}} in Geneva where he finds that the armour of Goldfinger's car is actually white-gold, cast into panels at his Kent refinery. When the car reaches Goldfinger's factory in Switzerland (Enterprises Auric AG), he recasts the gold from the armour panels into aircraft seats and fits them to the Mecca Charter Airline, in which he holds a large stake. The gold is finally sold in India at a vast profit. Bond foils an assassination attempt on Goldfinger by Jill Masterton's sister, Tilly, to avenge Jill's death at Goldfinger's hands: he had painted her body with gold paint, which killed her. Bond and Tilly attempt to escape when the alarm is raised, but are captured.|$|E
25|$|In January 1962, BUA {{merged with}} British Aviation Services, {{the holding company}} of rival British {{independent}} airlines Britavia and Silver City Airways. This made BUA the largest unsubsidised airline outside the United States. Silver City's pre-merger status as the main independent provider of <b>air</b> <b>ferry</b> services in the UK also gave BUA a monopoly among UK-based <b>air</b> <b>ferry</b> operators. The subsequent takover of Jersey Airlines in May 1962 resulted in further growth, giving BUA a fleet of more than 100 aircraft and 6,000 staff.|$|E

25|$|Also in 1955, Silver City {{launched}} its first <b>air</b> <b>ferry</b> services between Scotland and Ireland and its first such service from the Midlands.

25|$|Air Holdings, the old {{parent company}} of the unreconstructed BUA group, became a {{separate}} holding company for British Air Ferries (BAF) and Aviation Traders, Freddie Laker's old company. It also assumed ownership of <b>Air</b> <b>Ferry,</b> Airwork Services, the BUA group's tour operators and the new L-1011 franchise for sales outside the US.|$|E
25|$|Following growing {{financial}} difficulties, Silver City {{was taken}} over by BUA parent Air Holdings in 1962. The takeover was officially announced in January of that year. Air Holdings were the owners of Channel Air Bridge, a rival <b>air</b> <b>ferry</b> operator based at Southend in Essex, which operated similar services from Southend to the Continent. The BUA-BAS merger removed BUA's last remaining independent competitor in the <b>air</b> <b>ferry</b> business. The addition of Silver City's 650,000 annual ferry passengers increased the yearly combined total to just under one million, accounting for two thirds of BUA's total passengers. However, the change in ownership failed to staunch the airline's losses. These amounted to £650,000 {{during the first half of}} 1962. By the end of the year, the Silver City name ceased to be used as all aircraft had either been repainted in BUA colours or retired.|$|E
25|$|The 14th Bombardment Squadron, {{assigned}} the best crews and nine B-17s of the 11th Bomb Group in Hawaii, was detached from that group to pioneer an <b>air</b> <b>ferry</b> {{route to the}} Philippines, arriving 12 September {{in the middle of}} a typhoon. Two squadrons of the 19th Bombardment Group followed in October–November. The 14th and 28th Bomb Squadrons were attached to the 19th BG and a total of 35 B-17 Flying Fortresses constituted the FEAF's heavy bombardment force.|$|E

25|$|In summer 1961, Silver City {{agreed with}} rival French <b>air</b> <b>ferry</b> {{operator}} Compagnie Air Transport (CAT) {{for the latter}} to finance {{the construction of a}} two-mile rail spur into Le Touquet Airport from the nearby main line to reduce the travelling time between the airport and Paris by cutting out the coach/rail change at Étaples. In return, Silver City transferred three of its Superfreighters to CAT along with the traffic rights to operate the Ferryfield — Le Touquet and Bournemouth (Hurn) — Cherbourg routes. This arrangement gave CAT a 25% share of the car ferry market between Britain and France.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the coming}} years, Silver City pursued {{a policy of}} {{continuous}} fare reductions to fill the additional capacity on its growing <b>air</b> <b>ferry</b> network. This included new car ferry services between Southampton (Eastleigh) and Cherbourg {{as well as between}} Southend (Rochford) and Ostend and a DC-3 passenger service linking Gatwick and Le Touquet. Both of the former commenced in spring 1952, while the latter was inaugurated the following year. As a result, the number of vehicles carried doubled from 5,000 to 10,000 between 1950 and 1952 and quadrupled to 40,000 {{by the end of the}} following year. The latter was the consequence of an average 40% fare reduction.|$|E
25|$|Silver City Airways was a private, British {{independent}} airline {{formed in}} 1946. The name Silver City {{was derived from}} the eponymous Australian mining town at Broken Hill, where The Zinc Corporation was headquartered. Silver City's first commercial flight departed London Heathrow for Sydney via Johannesburg in late 1946. The following year, Silver City leased its first Bristol Freighter, moved its base to Blackbushe and participated in the airlift of Hindu and Muslim refugees between Pakistan and India. In 1948, control of Silver City passed from the Zinc Corporation to British Aviation Services. In July of that year, the airline inaugurated the world's first <b>air</b> <b>ferry</b> service across the English Channel between Lympne Airport and Le Touquet Airport. In 1948–49, Silver City participated in the Berlin Airlift. In 1949, it established a French sister airline.|$|E

25|$|That year also {{marked the}} {{conclusion}} of the first decade of Silver City's <b>air</b> <b>ferry</b> services. During that period, the airline completed 125,000 ferry flights. These carried 215,000 vehicles and 750,000 passengers. At its peak, Silver City operated 222 daily ferry flights across the English Channel, as well as between Scotland and Ireland and to/from the Isle of Wight, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. Cross-Channel flights to France operated between 7.30 am and 11.00 pm. The average fare was £25 per car and £4 per passenger. This was furthermore the time the Air Kruise cross-Channel services, as well as all Dragon Airways, Lancashire Aircraft Corporation and Manx Airlines operations from Newcastle upon Tyne, Blackpool and the Isle of Man were transferred to Silver City's new Northern Division to streamline BAS's fragmented airline operations. It was hoped that these measures would improve BAS's financial performance.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the poor}} {{financial}} performance, 1962 {{turned out to}} be the busiest year in Silver City's 16-year history. During that year, the airline and its French partner CAT carried 96,272 vehicles and 238,748 passengers on 43,064 flights, representing increases of 10%, 6% and 12% compared with 1961. In addition, over 43,000 tonnes of cargo were carried. However, these record-breaking traffic statistics did not alter the fact that the airline's <b>air</b> <b>ferry</b> operation was no longer economically viable. With the advent of new, high-capacity roll-on/roll-off ferries competition intensified. Established aircraft manufacturers were not interested in producing reasonably priced replacements for the ageing Bristol Freighters/Superfreighters that were suffering from wing fatigue. The airline's long-standing policy of stimulating the market by continuously reducing fares had resulted in uneconomic yields in the absence of a corresponding reduction in costs. The Hermes fleet had continued in operation serving several UK airports, mainly on inclusive tour flights, with the last example being retired from service in late 1962.|$|E
25|$|On 7 July 1948, a Silver City Bristol Freighter {{operated}} the first cross-Channel <b>air</b> <b>ferry</b> service, between Lympne near Folkestone in Kent and Le Touquet on France's northern Côte d'Opale coast, with good road connections from and to London and Paris respectively. The new service, which initially operated on a seasonal charter basis, became a year-round scheduled operation in 1949. In the beginning, {{there was a}} flat £32 one-way fare to take a group of four passengers along with their car across the Channel. Once opposition from British European Airways (BEA) to the carriage of passengers travelling without vehicles was overcome, a new fare structure was introduced. For example, a group of four travelling with a small car was charged only £27, while the comparable fare for four people travelling with a large car remained at £32. By the end of 1949, this operation fully utilised five Freighters, which carried 2,700 cars and 10,000 passengers. These figures represented a significant increase {{over the previous year}} when only 178 cars and their occupants, as well as some motorcycles and bicycles had been carried {{until the end of the}} season in September.|$|E
25|$|On 1 January 1963, Air Holdings merged Silver City with Channel Air Bridge to form British United <b>Air</b> <b>Ferries.</b>|$|R
25|$|During {{the early}} part of its existence, when the airline traded as British United <b>Air</b> <b>Ferries,</b> it {{suffered}} one non-fatal incident.|$|R
50|$|Regular {{services}} to Clacton were operated by E.H. Hillman using Puss Moth and Fox Moth aircraft and The Midland & Scottish <b>Air</b> <b>Ferries</b> operated regular flights from Romford to Glasgow.There were expansion plans for E.H. Hillman to expand {{services to}} Paris, Glasgow and Belfast, but operations moved from Romford to Stapleford Aerodrome {{in the mid}} 1930s. A conflict of interest between The Midland & Scottish <b>Air</b> <b>Ferries</b> and Scottish Motor Traction saw services cease in the mid 1930s.|$|R
