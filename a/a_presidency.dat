At {{the end of}} Greenhill's term in 1652, Fort St George was {{elevated}} to <b>a</b> <b>Presidency,</b> independent of Bantam and {{under the leadership of}} the first president, Aaron Baker (1652–1655). However, in 1655 the status of the fort was downgraded to an Agency and made subject to the factory at Surat, until 1684. In 1658, control of all the factories in Bengal was given to Madras, when the English occupied the nearby village of Triplicane.|$|E
5|$|In 1712, the British {{completed}} {{the construction of}} Fort William, located on the east bank of the Hooghly River to protect their trading factory. Facing frequent skirmishes with French forces, the British began to upgrade their fortifications in 1756. The Nawab of Bengal, Siraj ud-Daulah, condemned the militarisation and tax evasion by the company. His warning went unheeded, and the Nawab attacked; he captured Fort William {{which led to the}} killings of several East India company officials in the Black Hole of Calcutta. A force of Company soldiers (sepoys) and British troops led by Robert Clive recaptured the city the following year. Per the 1765 Treaty of Allahabad following the battle of Buxar, East India company was appointed imperial tax collector of the Mughal emperor in the province of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa, while Mughal-appointed Nawabs continued to rule the province. Declared <b>a</b> <b>presidency</b> city, Calcutta became the headquarters of the East India Company by 1772. In 1793, ruling power of the Nawabs were abolished and East India company took complete control {{of the city and the}} province. In the early 19th century, the marshes surrounding the city were drained; the government area was laid out along the banks of the Hooghly River. Richard Wellesley, Governor-General of the Presidency of Fort William between 1797 and 1805, was largely responsible for the development of the city and its public architecture. Throughout the late 18th and 19th century, the city was a centre of the East India Company's opium trade.|$|E

25|$|The British East India Company {{chose the}} place for a trade settlement. In 1698, the East India Company bought three villages (Sutanuti, Kalikata and Gobindapur) from a local {{landlord}} family of Sabarna Roy Choudhury. The next year, the company began developing the city as <b>a</b> <b>Presidency</b> City. In 1727, {{on the order of}} King George I, a civil court was set up in the city. The Calcutta Municipal corporation (now renamed Kolkata Municipal Corporation) was formed and the city had its first mayor.|$|E

In 1805, Penang became a separate presidency of British India, sharing similar status with Bombay and Madras. When Singapore and Malacca were incorporated with Penang to form the Straits Settlements in 1826, George Town continued {{to serve as the}} seat of government. However, in 1829, Penang was reduced from the rank of <b>a</b> <b>presidency,</b> and in 1832, the capital of the Straits Settlements was shifted from George Town to the rapidly-booming town of Singapore. In 1867, the Straits Settlements became a crown colony under direct British rule.|$|E
25|$|The largest bank, and {{the oldest}} still in existence, is the State Bank of India (S.B.I). It {{originated}} as the Bank of Calcutta in June 1806.

This {{was one of the}} three banks funded by <b>a</b> <b>presidency</b> government, the other two were the Bank of Bombay in 1840 and the Bank of Madras in 1843. The three banks were merged in 1921 to form the Imperial Bank of India, which upon India's independence, became the State Bank of India in 1955. For many years the presidency banks had acted as quasi-central banks, as did their successors, until the Reserve Bank of India was established in 1935, under the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934.|$|E

By {{the middle of the}} 19th century, the company's rule extended across most of India, Burma, Malaya, Singapore, and British Hong Kong, and a fifth of the world's population was under its trading influence.

25|$|Sidney Rigdon, who {{had been}} the first {{counselor}} in the first presidency under Joseph Smith, claimed to have received a vision, after the death of Joseph Smith, sustaining him {{as the leader of the}} Church. Although Joseph Smith taught that after the president in <b>a</b> <b>presidency</b> is released or dies the presidency no longer exists, Rigdon overlooked this teaching and returned to attempt to convince the other saints that he was to be the leader of the church. Unconvinced, because the other members were familiar with Smith's teachings, Brigham Young presented the doctrine taught by Smith that aside from the first presidency, the quorum of the twelve apostles was the governing body of the church. Most Latter Day Saints followed Young as a result.|$|E
25|$|The Charter conferred no {{legislative}} {{power on the}} Governor and Council of Prince of Wales' Island or, indeed, on any other individual or institution. The general power to make laws was vested with the Supreme Government of India and the British Parliament. By the East India Company Act 1813 (also known as the Charter Act 1813), Prince of Wales' Island itself had been conferred an extremely limited power to issue regulations relating to duties and taxes it was empowered to levy; pursuant to this power, it issued nine regulations that applied to the Straits Settlements. However, on 20 June 1830 the East India Company reduced the status of Prince of Wales' Island from <b>a</b> <b>Presidency</b> to a Residency. The island thus lost power to legislate for the Straits Settlements, which power was assumed by the Governor General of Bengal. He issued four such regulations applicable to the Straits Settlements.|$|E
25|$|Gorbachev {{continued}} to work on drafting a new treaty of union which would have created a truly voluntary federation in an increasingly democratised Soviet Union. The new treaty was strongly supported by the Central Asian republics, who needed the economic power and markets of the Soviet Union to prosper. However, the more radical reformists, such as Russian SFSR President Boris Yeltsin, were increasingly convinced that a rapid transition {{to a market economy}} was required and were more than happy to contemplate the disintegration of the Soviet Union if that was required to achieve their aims. Nevertheless, a referendum {{on the future of the}} Soviet Union was held in March (with a referendum in Russia on the creation of <b>a</b> <b>presidency),</b> which returned an average of 76.4% in the nine republics where it was taken, with a turnout of 80% of the adult population. Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Armenia, Georgia and Moldova did not participate. Following this, an April meeting at Novo-Ogarevo between Gorbachev and the heads of the nine republics issued a statement on speeding up the creation of a new Union treaty.|$|E

500|$|In 1639, the English East India Company {{purchased}} {{the village of}} Madraspatnam and one year later it established the Agency of Fort St George, precursor of the Madras Presidency, although there had been Company factories at Machilipatnam and Armagon since the very early 1600s. The agency was upgraded to <b>a</b> <b>Presidency</b> in 1652 before once more reverting to its previous status in 1655. In 1684, it was re-elevated to <b>a</b> <b>Presidency</b> and Elihu Yale was appointed as president. In 1785, under the provisions of Pitt's India Act, Madras became one of three provinces established by the East India Company. Thereafter, {{the head of the}} area was styled [...] "Governor" [...] rather than [...] "President" [...] and became subordinate to the Governor-General in Calcutta, a title that would persist until 1947. Judicial, legislative and executive powers rested with the Governor who was assisted by a Council whose constitution was modified by reforms enacted in 1861, 1909, 1919 and 1935. Regular elections were conducted in Madras up to the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939. By 1908, the province comprised twenty-two districts, each under a District Collector, and it was further sub-divided into taluks and firqas with villages making up the smallest unit of administration.|$|E

The request, specifically demanding the granting of wartime powers to the JNA {{and the introduction of}} a state of emergency, was made through Kadijević at <b>a</b> <b>Presidency</b> session of 1115 May.

None of the three candidates ran on the Justicialist Party ticket, but for special parties created for the occasion: Menem for the [...] "Front for Loyalty", Kirchner for the [...] "Front for Victory" [...] and Rodríguez Saá (who run for president anyway, but as a critic of Duhalde) for the [...] "Front of the National and Popular Movement". It was also announced that Lavagna would stay as minister of Economy during <b>a</b> <b>presidency</b> of Kirchner, to capitalize the support for the ongoing economic policies.
