5|$|The new Meiji Government had {{banned the}} {{carrying}} of swords and in 1876 banned {{the practice of}} duelling, and so traditional swordsmanship was no longer popular. Sakakibara tried {{to find new ways}} of promoting kenjutsu. His motives may have been financial, as without a sponsor he, like many other martial artists of the era, was suffering from penury– his poverty was such that he had to accept help from his wife's uncle Katsu Kaishū in constructing a residence. He began organising , feeling that such public competitions would instil <b>an</b> <b>appreciation</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> art of the swordsman in their audiences. He started an organisation called the , which, inspired by the popularity of sumo wrestling, organised these contests. The first public kogyo organised by Sakakibara's group took place in April 1873, and lasted for over a week. Other martial artists, witnessing the success of the Gekken Kaisha, followed suit.|$|E

500|$|Romance was {{credited}} by music critics to have renewed mainstream interest in bolero music.

[...] In The Wall Street Journal, Mary Talbot compared renewed interest in boleros to the revival of big band and swing music in the Anglo-American market, previously dominated by rock music (which had seized bolero's popularity during the 1960s). Elena Kellner of the Los Angeles Times noted the album's [...] "introducing old favorites to younger audiences" [...] while Achy Obejas of the Chicago Tribune documented Miguel's popularity with older listeners. In Latin Beat Magazine, Franz Reynold wrote that before Miguel, boleros were considered by young people the [...] "music of the ancients, something to be feared, since it seemed to signal the advent of senility". Mark Holston wrote in Américas magazine that the record's [...] "irresistible combination of classic songs, string-laden arrangements, and subtle contemporary influences {{proved to be the}} perfect formula to reawaken the bolero's slumbering passions once again." ...|$|E

500|$|With no {{knowledge}} of the fashion industry, Morgan decided to make a film on the topic after being shocked by the news of the collapse of Rana Plaza.

He had also previously had <b>an</b> <b>appreciation</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> genre, saying he was [...] "actually fascinated by those [...] films that follow one person". Like Morgan a non-connoisseur of fashion, executive producer and eco activist Lucy Siegle said that she does not like such films as they are usually limited to exploring the aesthetic aspects of the industry. It is The True Cost differential in her opinion; it [...] "goes there and then someit unravels the grim, gritty, global supply chain of fast fashion". Nevertheless, the film purposely does not give viewers a clear answer on how to solve the problems as there are [...] "no straightforward answers". Morgan commented, [...] "I'm probably most proud that we avoided easy answers and instead chose to trust people to both feel and think deeply about the issues raised." ...|$|E

[...] Steven H. Silver identified Brooks' international focus as the novel's greatest strength and commented favorably on Brooks' ability to create <b>an</b> <b>appreciation</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> work needed to combat a global zombie outbreak. Silver's only complaint was with [...] "Good-Byes"—the final chapter—in which characters get a chance to give a final closing statement. Silver felt that it was not always apparent who the sundry, undifferentiated characters were. The Eagle described the book as being [...] "unlike any other zombie tale" [...] as it is [...] "sufficiently terrifying for most readers, and not always in a blood-and-guts way, either." [...] Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club stated that the format of the novel makes it difficult for it to develop momentum, but found the novel's individual episodes gripping. Patrick Daily of the Chicago Reader said the novel transcends the [...] "silliness" [...] of The Zombie Survival Guide by [...] "touching on deeper, more somber aspects of the human condition." [...] In his review for Time Out Chicago, Pete Coco declared that [...] "ending horror to the form of alternative history would have been novel in and of itself. Doing so in the mode of Studs Terkel might constitute brilliance." ...|$|E
