5|$|The Crescent is {{a street}} in Taunton, a town in the English county of Somerset. Construction began in 1807, {{during a period of}} {{extensive}} redevelopment in the town, driven by the Market House Society and the Member of Parliament Sir Benjamin Hammet. Lined on the eastern side by a Georgian terrace, the street follows a shallow crescent shape, broken in the middle by Crescent Way <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> further south by St George's Place. It links Upper High Street, at its southern end, with Park Street and Tower Street to the north. On the western side, Somerset County Council have their offices in the County Hall, erected in 1935, and extended in the 1960s. The Georgian terrace, the Masonic Hall, and the County Hall are recorded in the National Heritage List for England as listed buildings.|$|E

He was seen by Noël Coward playing a small role on stage in Power Without Glory (1947), which led to him being cast in Coward's Peace In Our Time (1948) on stage.|$|E

25|$|Brails {{run from}} the leech of a fore-and-aft rigged sail (a spanker or lateen mizzen, for example) to the gaff and mast and serve the same {{function}} as buntlines: to haul in the sail when furling. In this case, however, the action is more horizontal than vertical, hauling the sail forwards, toward the luff <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> up, towards the gaff.|$|E
25|$|According to Master of Wine Clive Coates, {{the wines}} of Saint-Nicolas-de-Bourgueil are noted for a {{distinctive}} raspberry aroma {{that can also}} have elements of pencil shavings. Compared to Chinon, the wines tend to be slightly more austere with more noticeable acidity. While very similar, Coates notes that Saint-Nicolas-de-Bourgueil {{can be a little}} more aromatic <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> lighter than neighboring Bourgueil.|$|E

25|$|One of {{his initial}} {{projects}} {{was to make}} a song for a twelve-year-old mayor's daughter named Sharon Cuneta. It was a daunting challenge, as Rey initially could not figure out what kind song would be fitting for her; she was too young to be taken seriously to be given a love song, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> too old to be given a nursery rhyme.|$|E
25|$|Terrain {{is a very}} {{important}} part of play. Though Games Workshop makes terrain kits available, many hobbyists prefer to make their own elaborate and unique set pieces. Common household items and hobby materials such as balsa wood, cardboard, and polystyrene can be transformed into ruins from the Second Age, woodland terrain, or the rocky wild of Middle-earth with the addition of plasticard, putty, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of patience and skill.|$|E
25|$|Modified {{digital cameras}} can detect some ultraviolet, {{all of the}} visible {{and much of the}} near {{infrared}} spectrum, as most digital imaging sensors are sensitive from about 350nm to 1000nm. An off-the-shelf digital camera contains an infrared hot mirror filter that blocks most of the infrared <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of the ultraviolet that would otherwise be detected by the sensor, narrowing the accepted range from about 400nm to 700nm.|$|E

25|$|Lincoln's {{service had}} a lasting {{impression}} on him and he related tales about it later in life with modesty <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of humor. Through his service {{he was able to}} forge lasting political connections. In addition, he received a land grant from the U.S. government for his military service during the war. Though Lincoln had no military experience when he assumed command of his company, he is generally characterized as an able and competent leader.|$|E
25|$|During French {{exploration}} of the region in 1620, the region's inhabitants were an Iroquoian-speaking tribal offshoot of the large Neutral Nation called the Wenro people or 'Wenrohronon', who lived along the south shore of Lake Ontario and east end of Lake Erie <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of its southern shore. Later, during the 1640s–50s Beaver Wars, the combined warriors of the Five Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy conquered the populous Neutrals and their peninsular territory, while the Senecas alone took out the Wenro and their territory, c. 1651–1653.|$|E
25|$|The First Test was, I {{honestly}} think, the dullest {{and most}} depressing I have ever watched...Even at this range of time one finds the gorge rising at the recollection {{of a piece}} of cricket for which there was no tactical or technical justification whatever. Did England think the pitch was going to go? Did they hope to bat out a draw? The answer is that the pitch at the end was perfect, and Australia's eight wicket win was gained with a day <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> to spare.|$|E

5000|$|Eric Goldman of IGN {{gave the}} episode an 8 out of 10, saying [...] "This was an offbeat episode, even by Community {{standards}} <b>and</b> felt <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> disjointed. However, {{it helped to}} humanize Duncan and gave Hickey <b>and</b> <b>Abed</b> an unlikely bonding session - albeit a pretty serious one!

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{others argue that}} {{evidence}} of bit wear does not necessarily correlate to riding. Some theorists speculate that a horse could have been controlled from the ground by placing {{a bit in the}} mouth, connected to a lead rope, and leading the animal while pulling a primitive wagon or plow. Since oxen were usually relegated to this duty in Mesopotamia, it is possible that early plows might have been attempted with the horse, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> may indeed have been significant as part of agrarian development rather than as warfare technology.|$|E
25|$|Things {{become more}} {{complicated}} for Hikari when she meets a young, handsome, and talented musician who begins do compose the music she uses while she performs her routines. And {{while he is}} very quiet, reserved, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> morbid at times, he quietly begins to develop feelings for Hikari and is unable to express this feelings only through his music. While Hikari does not see this, she will find herself {{in a very difficult}} situation when she discovers that she also has feelings for him. And while a bit naïve and carefree at the beginning story, Hikari will gain in maturity throughout the manga series and find her comfort from all her emotional turmoil through rhythmic gymnastics.|$|E
25|$|These were {{followed}} in later years, by other extensive factories filled with valuable machinery. Adjoining the saw mill mentioned, {{was a large}} woolen factory, which had just got into active operation when it was swept away by a most destructive fire in 1863, which also consumed the sawmill and its contents, and also a large planing mill and sash and door factory just erected by Mr. Henry Lye in close proximity. This great loss for a time checked {{the progress of the}} village, and paralyzed the enterprise of several active and industrious citizens. Another large factory erected for a cotton mill, a wool carding and knitting factory, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> larger saw mill than the former one, had in the meantime been erected {{on the south side of}} the river, just below the bridge, and these important structures with their valuable machinery, continue in active operation, and not only reflect much credit upon the enterprise of the place, but contribute much towards its prosperity.|$|E
5000|$|In a {{mechanical}} hackamore, {{also known as}} <b>a</b> hackamore <b>bit,</b> brockamore, <b>and</b> English hackamore, the reins attach to shanks (like <b>bit</b> shanks on <b>a</b> curb <b>bit)</b> that are attached between <b>a</b> noseband <b>and</b> <b>a</b> curb chain. [...] As in <b>a</b> curb <b>bit,</b> the shanks apply pressure with leverage to the nose, jaw, and poll joint. This is not a true hackamore, nor a modern bitless bridle, but rather is a hybrid between <b>a</b> cavesson <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>bitted</b> bridle.|$|R

25|$|The Jesuits {{arrived in}} the Viceroyalty of Peru by 1571; it was a key area of Spanish empire, with not only dense {{indigenous}} populations but also huge deposits of silver at Potosí. A major figure in {{the first wave of}} Jesuits was José de Acosta (1540–1600), whose book Historia natural y moral de las Indias (1590) introduced Europeans to Spain's American empire via fluid prose and keen observation and explanation, based on fifteen years in Peru <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of time in New Spain (Mexico). Viceroy of Peru Don Francisco de Toledo urged the Jesuits to evangelize the indigenous peoples of Peru, wanting to put them in charge of parishes, but Acosta adhered to the Jesuit position that they were not subject to the jurisdiction of bishops and to catechize in Indian parishes would bring them into conflict with the bishops. For that reason, the Jesuits in Peru focused on education of elite men rather than the indigenous populations.|$|E
25|$|In 1825, he {{left for}} his second Canadian and third Arctic expedition. The goal this time was {{the mouth of the}} Mackenzie River from which he would follow the coast westward and {{possibly}} meet Frederick William Beechey who would try to sail northeast from the Bering Strait. With him was John Richardson who would follow the coast east from the Mackenzie to the mouth of the Coppermine River. At the same time, William Edward Parry would try to sail west from the Atlantic. (Beechey reached Point Barrow and Parry became frozen in 900 miles east. At this time, the only known points on the north coast were a hundred or so miles east from the Bering Strait, the mouth of the Mackenzie, Franklin's stretch east of the Coppermine, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of the Gulf of Boothia which had been seen briefly from land.) Supplies were better organized this time, in part because they were managed by Peter Warren Dease of the Hudson's Bay Company.|$|E
25|$|The Scottish Saltires gave Derbyshire Phantoms a {{good fight}} at The Grange, but despite three wickets from Ryan Watson and an unbeaten 71 from Fraser Watts Derbyshire still came out on top. Scotland had been put in to bat by Derbyshire captain Luke Sutton, and crashed to 42 for 4 after two wickets from new-ball bowler Graeme Welch, but Watts paired up well with the lower middle order before rain set in. Seven overs were cut off the Scottish innings, leaving them with 38 overs to play, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of hard hitting from Pakistani all-rounder Yasir Arafat lifted them to 179 for 7. More rain cut Derbyshire's chase to 32 overs, and under the Duckworth-Lewis method they were set 161 to win. They looked to be {{cruising}} at 120 for 2 after Steve Stubbings had put on 70 with Sutton. Watson then got three wickets and Cedric English two, as the visitors collapsed to 147 for 7, but Stubbings, still at the crease, held his head calm and ended on 75 not out to guide Derbyshire past the target with three balls to spare.|$|E
