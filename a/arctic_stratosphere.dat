40|$|The <b>Arctic</b> <b>stratosphere</b> {{throughout}} the late winter and early spring of 2011 {{was characterized by}} an unusually severe ozone loss, resulting {{in what has been}} described as an ozone hole. The 2011 ozone loss was made possible by unusually cold temperatures {{throughout the}} <b>Arctic</b> <b>stratosphere.</b> Here we consider the issue of what constitutes suitable environmental conditions for the formation and maintenance of a polar ozone hole. Our discussion focuses on the importance of the stratospheric wind field and, in particular, the importance of a high latitude zonal jet, which serves as a meridional transport barrier both prior to ozone hole formation and during the ozone hole maintenance phase.

40|$|The {{influence}} of the Arctic Oscillation (AO) on the vertical distribution of stratospheric ozone in the Northern Hemisphere in winter is analyzed using observations and an offline chemical transport model. Positive ozone anomalies are found at low latitudes (0 – 30 °N) and there are three negative anomaly centers in the northern mid- and high latitudes during positive AO phases. The negative anomalies {{are located in the}} <b>Arctic</b> middle <b>stratosphere</b> (~ 30 hPa, 70 – 90 °N), <b>Arctic</b> upper troposphere/lower <b>stratosphere</b> (UTLS, 150 – 300 hPa, 70 – 90 °N), and mid-latitude UTLS (70 – 300 hPa, 30 – 60 °N). Further analysis shows that anomalous dynamical transport related to AO variability primarily controls these ozone changes. During positive AO events, positive ozone anomalies between 0 – 30 °N at 50 – 150 hPa are related to the weakened meridional transport of the Brewer–Dobson circulation (BDC) and enhanced eddy transport. The negative ozone anomalies in the <b>Arctic</b> middle <b>stratosphere</b> are also caused by the weakened BDC, while the negative ozone anomalies in the Arctic UTLS are caused by the increased tropopause height, weakened BDC vertical transport, weaker exchange between the mid-latitudes and the Arctic, and enhanced ozone depletion via heterogeneous chemistry. The negative ozone anomalies in the mid-latitude UTLS are due mainly to enhanced eddy transport from the mid-latitudes to the equatorward of 30 °N, while the transport of ozone-poor air from the Arctic to the mid-latitudes makes a minor contribution. Interpreting AO-related variability of stratospheric ozone, especially in the UTLS, would be helpful for the prediction of tropospheric ozone variability caused by AO...|$|R

40|$|During {{the recent}} winters water vapour has been {{accurately}} measured from different Arctic sites using balloon-borne Lyman-alpha FLASH-B hygrosonde. Here we {{present the results}} of 18 balloon water vapour soundings conducted at Sodankylä (67 N) and Ny-Alesund (79 N) during 2003 / 04, 2004 / 05 and 2005 / 06 winters. The obtained data set allows case studies and detailed characterization of stratospheric water vapour vertical distribution within different conditions in the <b>Arctic</b> polar <b>stratosphere.</b> Water vapour vertical distribution in the <b>Arctic</b> lower <b>stratosphere</b> is primarily affected by the dynamical effects of polar vortex and by phase aggregation at the temperatures below ice PSC threshold. The measured H 2 O profiles carry the signatures of different processes occurring in the <b>Arctic</b> winter <b>stratosphere</b> and reveal a detailed view on the Arctic UT/LS water vapour distribution. The measurements clearly demonstrate typical differences in stratospheric water vapour concentration {{inside and outside the}} vortex; for example in the polar vortex of 2003 / 04 at 20 hPa the difference reaches 1. 4 ppmv. Also it is pointed out that water vapour profiles obtained at the edge or close to the edge of vortex are characteristic by their laminated structure. As shown by the results of RDF-analysis this structure is not linked to dehydration but to differential advection of air masses originating from inside and outside the vortex. Thus water vapour is proved to be a valuable tracer for dynamical processes in the polar stratosphere. In the other case, the water vapour vertical profiles obtained at Ny-Alesund in January 2005 during the presence of PSCs clearly show the dehydration layers with reduced water vapour. Another focus is put here on the water vapour vertical distribution within the so called transition layer above the polar tropopause. The existence of this transition layer may be caused by diffusion of water vapour through the smeared polar winter tropopause, whereas the vertical structure of the H 2 O profile is affected by the dynamical processes. In addition the variability of water vapour at the hygropause and the distance between tropopause and hygropause are discussed...|$|R

High CO 2 loading provides the ability to attain the statistical significance of any response, typically a problem given the large component of interannual variability common to the region. In response to CO 2, the expected global stratospheric cooling is modified by an anomalous dynamical warming of the <b>Arctic</b> winter lower <b>stratosphere.</b> This warming is shown {{to be associated with}} an increase in frequency of stratospheric sudden warming (SSW) events.

40|$|The role of {{stationary}} planetary {{waves in}} the dynamical response of the Arctic winter stratosphere circulation to global warming is investigated here by analyzing simulations performed with atmosphere-only models from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP 5) driven by prescribed sea surface temperatures (SSTs). Climate models often simulate dynamical warming of the <b>Arctic</b> <b>stratosphere</b> {{as a response to}} global warming in association with a strengthening of the deep branch of the Brewer-Dobson circulation; however, until now, no satisfactory mechanism for such a response has been suggested. This study focuses on December-February (DJF) because this is the period when the troposphere and stratosphere are strongly coupled. When forced by increased SSTs, all the models analyzed here simulate <b>Arctic</b> <b>stratosphere</b> dynamical warming, mostly due to increased upward propagation of quasi-stationary wavenumber 1, as diagnosed by the meridional eddy heat flux. Further, it is shown that the stratospheric warming and increased wave flux to the stratosphere are related to the strengthening of the zonal winds in subtropics and midlatitudes near the tropopause. Evidence presented in this paper corroborate climate model simulations of future stratospheric changes and suggest a dynamical warming of the Arctic polar vortex as the most likely response to global warming...|$|E

40|$|The {{temperature}} of the polar lower stratosphere during spring is the key factor in changing the magnitude of ozone loss in the polar vortices. In this talk, we will review the results of Newman et al. [2000] that quantitatively demonstrate that the polar lower stratospheric temperature is primarily controlled by planetary-scale waves. In particular, the tropospheric eddy heat flux in middle to late winter (January [...] February) is highly correlated with the mean polar stratospheric temperature during March. Strong midwinter planetary wave forcing leads to a warmer spring <b>Arctic</b> lower <b>stratosphere</b> in early spring, while weak midwinter forcing leads to cooler spring Arctic temperatures.

40|$|Arctic {{stratospheric ozone}} {{depletion}} is {{closely linked to}} the occurrence of low stratospheric temperatures. There are indications that cold winters in the <b>Arctic</b> <b>stratosphere</b> have been getting colder, raising the question if and to what extent a cooling of the <b>Arctic</b> <b>stratosphere</b> may continue into the future. We use meteorological reanalyses from the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA-Interim and NASA's Modern-Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) for the past 32 yr together with calculations of the chemistry-climate model (CCM) ECHAM/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry (EMAC) and models from the Chemistry-Climate Model Validation (CCMVal) project to infer radiative and dynamical contributions to long-term Arctic stratospheric temperature changes. For the past three decades the reanalyses show a warming trend in winter and cooling trend in spring and summer, which agree well with trends from the Radiosonde Innovation Composite Homogenization (RICH) adjusted radiosonde data set. Changes in winter and spring are caused by a corresponding change of planetary wave activity with increases in winter and decreases in spring. During winter the increase of planetary wave activity is counteracted by a residual radiatively induced cooling. Stratospheric radiatively induced cooling is detected throughout all seasons, being highly significant in spring and summer. This means that for a given dynamical situation, according to ERA-Interim the annual mean temperature of the Arctic lower stratosphere has been cooling by − 0. 41 ± 0. 11 K decade − 1 at 50 hPa over the past 32 yr. Calculations with state-of-the-art models from CCMVal and the EMAC model qualitatively reproduce the radiatively induced cooling for the past decades, but underestimate the amount of radiatively induced cooling deduced from reanalyses. There are indications that this discrepancy could be partly related to a possible underestimation of past Arctic ozone trends in the models. The models project a continued cooling of the <b>Arctic</b> <b>stratosphere</b> over the coming decades (2001 – 2049) that is for the annual mean about 40 % less than the modeled cooling for the past, due to the reduction of ozone depleting substances and the resulting ozone recovery.

We examine whether the meteorological conditions that allowed particles to grow to the very large sizes observed in 1999 / 2000 also occurred in the other cold winters. The results show that winter 1999 / 2000 had conditions that were optimum for denitrification by large NAT particles, which are a deep concentric NAT area and vortex. Under these conditions, NAT particles can circulate in the NAT-supersaturated air for several days, reaching several micrometres in radius and leading to a high downward flux of nitric acid.

These chemical changes ensured characteristic ozone losses of 10 to 15 percent at altitudes inside the polar vortex where polar stratospheric clouds had occurred.
