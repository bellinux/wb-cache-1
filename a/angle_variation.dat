5000|$|Cyclorotors {{produce thrust}} by {{combined}} action of a rotation of a fixed {{point of the}} blades around a centre and the oscillation of the blades that changes over time their angle-of-attack. The joint action of the advancement produced by the orbital motion and pitch <b>angle</b> <b>variation</b> generates a higher thrust even at low speed with respect of any other propeller. In hover, the blades are actuated to a positive pitch (outward {{from the center of}} the rotor) on the upper half of their revolution and a negative pitch (inward towards the axis of rotation) over the lower half inducing a net upward aerodynamic force and opposite fluid downwash. By varying the phase of this pitch motion the force can be shifted sidewise or downward. Before blade stall, increasing the amplitude of the pitching kinematics will magnify thrust.|$|E
5000|$|Since {{the motions}} of the atoms in a {{molecule}} are determined by quantum mechanics, onemust define [...] "motion" [...] in a quantum mechanical way. The overall (external) quantum mechanical motions translation and rotation hardly change the geometry of the molecule. (To some extent rotation influencesthe geometry via Coriolis forces and centrifugal distortion, but this is negligible for the present discussion.)In addition to translation and rotation, a third type of motion is molecular vibration, which corresponds to internal motions of the atoms such as bond stretching and bond <b>angle</b> <b>variation.</b> The molecular vibrations are harmonic (at least to good approximation), and the atoms oscillate about their equilibrium positions, even at the absolute zero of temperature. At absolute zero all atoms are in their vibrational ground state and show zero point quantum mechanical motion, so that the wavefunction of a single vibrational mode is not a sharp peak, but an exponential of finite width (the wavefunction for n = 0 depicted in the article on the quantum harmonic oscillator). At higher temperatures the vibrational modes may be thermally excited (in a classical interpretation one expresses this by stating that [...] "the molecules will vibrate faster"), but they oscillate still around the recognizable geometry of the molecule.|$|E

40|$|We {{present the}} {{wavelength}} dependent linear polarization and position <b>angle</b> <b>variations</b> arising from single Thomson scattering of continuum stellar radiation in an axisymmetric, hot, planar disk, {{which is in}} bulk motion. The wavelength dependence arises through the combination of Doppler shifted line attenuation, prior to scattering, and the Doppler redistribution of the scattered radiation due to the bulk and thermal motions of the disk electrons. We find that when the scattering electrons are cold, there are large polarization and position <b>angle</b> <b>variations</b> across the resulting spectrapolarimetric absorption line profile-agreeing with previous investigations. However, when the thermal Doppler velocities of the scattering electrons are comparable {{to or greater than}} the electron bulk velocity (as is of ten the case), then the scattered line profile is broadened and the amplitude of the polarimetric variations are considerably reduced. The properties of the electron thermal smearing function are such that the equivalent width of any scattered spectrapolarimetric feature is independent on the electron temperature-a consequence of the conservation of areas under convolution. An important result of this is that for an axisymmetric circumstellar envelope the position <b>angle</b> <b>variations</b> will average to zero across any line formed through the above process. We expect that the effect of multiple line blending will yield a depolarization equivalent width is given by thesum of the individual equivalent widths and the position <b>angle</b> <b>variations</b> will average to zero. The implications of this are that the large depolarizations observed in the UV spectra of pi Aquarii, zeta Tauri and PP Carinae by the Wisconsin Ultraviolet Photo Polarimeter Experiment (WUPPE) can only be explained with prescattering attenuation of stellar flux if there are a sufficient number of multiple overlapping lines {{in that part of the}} spectrum...|$|R

40|$|Abstract In this paper, {{we propose}} two new {{algorithms}} {{to correct the}} trajectories of the tool tip of a five-axis milling machine by adjusting the rotation angles {{in such a way}} that the kinematics error is reduced. The first algorithm is based on the shortest-path optimization with regards to feasible rotations of the inverse kinematics. The cost function is represented in terms of the total <b>angle</b> <b>variation.</b> We show that such an optimization increases the accuracy of machining and is the most appropriate in the case of a rough cut. The shortest-path procedure applies to either the entire set of trajectories or to only the most inappropriate undercuts inside the workpiece. In the latter case, the algorithm generates an interesting family of solutions characterized by smaller undercuts obtained at the expense of increased overcuts. The second algorithm also exploits the idea of the minimization of the <b>angle</b> <b>variation.</b> It is based on the uniform distribution of the cutter contact points with regards to the rotation angles. The method inserts additional tool positions by numerically finding a grid of points distributed uniformly in the angular space. We prove that the proposed algorithm in the neighborhood of stationary points requires 3 – 4 times fewer additional points than the conventional scheme. Also, if a maximum angular speed has been exceeded, the controller detects this event and reduces the angular speed. Our correction algorithms minimize the total <b>angle</b> <b>variation,</b> thus, reduc-ing the probability of such an event. Finally, the efficiency of the two algorithms has been verified by a five-axis machine MAHO 600 E at the CIM Lab of the Asian Institut...|$|E
