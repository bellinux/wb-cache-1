40|$|Introduction The {{engineering}} uses {{of rubber}} have expanded well beyond traditional {{products such as}} tires and seals. Today rubber components {{can be found in}} a diverse set of constructs including engine mounts, building foundations, belts, and fenders (see [12], [21]). Increasingly, the applications of rubber are becoming more sophisticated, as exemplified by the use of rubber bearings in bridges which allow for thermal expansions of the deck without placing excessive loads on the bridge supports (see [14]). In current engineering applications, rubber or elastomer composites are typically filled with inactive particles such as carbon black or silica. If <b>active</b> <b>fillers</b> were used, such as piezoelectric, magnetic, or conductive particles, the resulting controllable elastomer could be used in products such as active vibration suppression devices (e. g., see [16], [17]).

40|$|Advanced ceramic {{is usually}} joined to metal by the {{well-known}} direct brazing process, where costly <b>active</b> <b>filler</b> alloys {{can be considered}} a limitation. Brazing using active-metal-free filler alloy as insert between the joint components is an attempt to overcome it. The active metal diffusion from the titanium member through the bulk of molten filler to the ceramic was responsible to produce an <b>active</b> <b>filler</b> alloy in loco and promote reduction of the zirconium oxide to improve wetting on the ceramic surface. Unalloyed titanium was joined in a high-vacuum furnace (< 3 x 10 - 5 mbar) to yttria-tetragonal zirconia polycristals (Y-TZP) and zirconia partially stabilized with magnesia (Mg-PSZ), where commercial fillers Ag- 28 Cu and Au- 18 Ni with respective thermal cycles were evaluated. Helium gas leak detection test was performed at the ceramic/metal interface at room temperature; samples from reliable vacuum tight joints were examined by microstructural analysis techniques and energy dispersive X-ray analysis at the joint cross-section. Tight joints were produced with eutectic Ag-Cu filler, revealing an intermetallic layer and a dark reaction layer near the ceramic surface; titanium diffusion was efficient for superficial chemical interactions between individual components. Brazing joints were also tested using three-point flexure testing...|$|E
40|$|Brazing {{has been}} {{increasingly}} used to join metals to advanced ceramics. Brazing covalent materials requires either {{the use of}} <b>active</b> <b>filler</b> alloys or the previous metallization of the surface. To that end, a new and simple mechanical technique {{has been applied to}} metallize advanced ceramics, thus avoiding the use of costly Ti-based <b>active</b> <b>filler</b> alloys. The mechanical metallization Of Si 3 N 4 with Ti was employed as an alternative route to deposit active metallic films prior to brazing with stainless steel using 72 % Ag- 28 % Cu or 82 % Au- 18 % Ni eutectic alloys. The brazing temperatures were set to 40 degrees C or 75 degrees C above the eutectic temperature of each filler alloy. Ti-films of average thickness 4 mu m produced adequate spreading of both filler alloys onto Si 3 N 4 substrates, which were subsequently brazed to stainless steel. The interface Of Si 3 N 4 / 310 stainless steel basically consisted of a reaction layer, a precipitation zone and an eutectic microconstituent. Mechanically sound and vacuum-tight joints were obtained, especially upon brazing at relatively lower temperatures. Increasing the brazing temperature resulted in thermal cracking of the Si 3 N 4, possibly due to increased thermal stress. (c) 2005 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc...|$|E
