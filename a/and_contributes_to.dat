5|$|From 1898, the {{newspapers}} that had encouraged so many {{to travel to}} the Klondike lost interest in it. In the summer of 1899, gold was discovered around Nome in west Alaska, and many prospectors left the Klondike for the new goldfields, marking the end of the rush. The boom towns declined and the population of Dawson City fell. Gold mining activity lasted until 1903 when production peaked after heavier equipment was brought in. Since then the Klondike has been mined on and off, and today the legacy draws tourists to the region <b>and</b> <b>contributes</b> <b>to</b> its prosperity.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} stated that sperm whales, {{as well as}} other large cetaceans, help {{fertilise}} the surface of the ocean by consuming nutrients in the depths and transporting those nutrients to the oceans' surface when they defecate, an effect known as the whale pump. This fertilises phytoplankton and other plants {{on the surface of the}} ocean <b>and</b> <b>contributes</b> <b>to</b> ocean productivity and the drawdown of atmospheric carbon.|$|E
5|$|Nearly {{two billion}} {{people in the}} {{developing}} world are deficient in zinc. In children, it causes an increase in infection and diarrhea <b>and</b> <b>contributes</b> <b>to</b> the death of about 800,000 children worldwide per year. The World Health Organization advocates zinc supplementation for severe malnutrition and diarrhea. Zinc supplements help prevent disease and reduce mortality, especially among children with low birth weight or stunted growth. However, zinc supplements should not be administered alone, because many {{in the developing world}} have several deficiencies, and zinc interacts with other micronutrients.|$|E

Its annual meetings, held every winter, foster discussion amongst its members through the presentation of peer-reviewed research, as well as conducting official business of the Society. Since 1928, the LSA has offered training to linguists through courses held at its biennial Linguistic Institutes held in the summer. The LSA and its 3,500 members work to raise awareness of linguistic issues with the public <b>and</b> <b>contributes</b> <b>to</b> policy debates on issues including bilingual education and the preservation of endangered languages.|$|E
5|$|White-winged fairywrens live {{in complex}} social groups. Clans consist of 2–4 birds, {{typically}} one brown or partially blue male and a breeding female. Nest helpers are birds raised {{in previous years}} which remain with the family group after fledging and assist in raising young; they may be male that have retained their brown plumage, or female. Birds in a group roost side-by-side in dense cover and engage in mutual preening. Several subgroups live within one territory and make up a clan, which is presided over by one blue (or black) male who assumes breeding plumage. While the blue male is dominant {{to the rest of}} the brown and partially blue males within his clan, he nests with only one female <b>and</b> <b>contributes</b> <b>to</b> the raising of only her young. It is unclear whether or not he fathers young in any of the other nests within his territory.|$|E
5|$|Midazolam is a short-acting {{benzodiazepine}} {{in adults}} with an elimination half-life of 1.5-2.5 hours. In the elderly, {{as well as}} young children and adolescents, the elimination half-life is longer. Midazolam is metabolised into an active metabolite alpha1-hydroxymidazolam. Age-related deficits, renal and liver status affect the pharmacokinetic factors of midazolam {{as well as its}} active metabolite. However, the active metabolite of midazolam is minor <b>and</b> <b>contributes</b> <b>to</b> only 10 percent of biological activity of midazolam. Midazolam is poorly absorbed orally, with only 50 percent of the drug reaching the bloodstream. Midazolam is metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and by glucuronide conjugation. The therapeutic as well as adverse effects of midazolam are due to its effects on the GABAA receptors; midazolam does not activate GABAA receptors directly but, as with other benzodiazepines, it enhances the effect of the neurotransmitter GABA on the GABAA receptors (↑ frequency of Cl− channel opening) resulting in neural inhibition. Almost all of the properties {{can be explained by the}} actions of benzodiazepines on GABAA receptors. This results in the following pharmacological properties being produced: sedation, induction of sleep, reduction in anxiety, anterograde amnesia, muscle relaxation and anticonvulsant effects.|$|E
