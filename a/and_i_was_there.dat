2500|$|... “I {{hate that}} I got into Kurt {{there at the}} end racing to the line,’’ Logano said. “I had a run to turn up {{underneath}} him and when you do that, the cars get free and then I was there and he tried to catch it <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> again. It is a product of this racing, but I hate that it happened. The last thing I want to do is hit someone like that. Unfortunately, it happened.’’ ...|$|E

Clausen and Bruce Lee, Pearl Harbor: Final Judgement, (HarperCollins, 2001), {{an account}} of the secret [...] "Clausen Inquiry" [...] {{undertaken}} late in the war by order of Congress to Secretary of War Stimson. Clausen carried a vest bomb to protect the copies of decrypts he was allowed to carry with him. Background notes: (A) Clausen was the assistant recorder for the APHB (Army Pearl Harbor Board) and (B) Bruce Lee was the editor for Prange's At Dawn We Slept [...] and Layton's <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>Was</b> <b>There</b> (See Layton, pages 508–509).|$|E

6000|$|... "That will be fine!" [...] Tom had cried. [...] "You {{come when}} Sam <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> we'll do {{all we can}} {{to give you the}} best kind of a time." [...] And so it had been arranged.|$|R
2500|$|On January 7, 1955, Anderson {{became the}} first African-American to perform with the Metropolitan Opera in New York. On that occasion, she sang the part of Ulrica in Giuseppe Verdi's Un ballo in maschera (opposite Zinka Milanov, then Herva Nelli, as Amelia) at the {{invitation}} of director Rudolf Bing. Anderson said later about the evening, [...] "The curtain rose on the second scene <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> on stage, mixing the witch's brew. I trembled, and when the audience applauded and applauded before I could sing a note, I felt myself tightening into a knot." [...] Although she never appeared with the company again after this production, Anderson was named a permanent member of the Metropolitan Opera company. The following year she published her autobiography, My Lord, What a Morning, which became a bestseller.|$|E
2500|$|Tiffany {{was created}} as a new love {{interest}} for established character; Chris Warner. Alison James, who had theatre background, was cast in the role. After appearing on the show for three years, James decided to quit and the character was killed off. She stated, [...] "It {{took me a long}} time to decide to leave Shortland Street because it isn't easy to walk away from something you love. I also had this fear I'd never get work again – it's a real fear. So it {{took me a long time}} to wrestle with the idea that saying no to work wasn't unwise, and that if you actually want to grow and develop as an actor you do have to stop and move on." [...] She found her final scenes draining, [...] "Everyone was acting around me <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there,</b> but my acting had basically stopped. I remember lying there thinking, 'I’m going to miss all these people.' I was quite teary, actually." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You saw her out hunting, no doubt, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there.</b> I did not {{specially}} bring her. She {{was staying}} here, and rode one of Albury's horses." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'WE <b>were</b> <b>there.</b> She <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>there.</b> <b>I,</b> in {{the chair}} upon the hearth; she, a white wreck again, {{trailing}} itself towards me on the floor. But, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> the speaker no more, and the one word that {{she said to me}} from midnight until dawn was, 'Live!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes?--you think--you think? Look now! Waits me, outside, {{the horse}} of the livery-stable man. How many miles you think {{to the stage}} town? Fifteen." [...] (He {{emphasized}} them with his five uplifted fingers.) [...] "It is nothing. Two hour comes the stage <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>there.</b> Ha!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{happened}} at the town hall," [...] began Wright rapidly. [...] "Your father and Judge Owens <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> in consultation with three ranchers from out of town. First we were disturbed by gunshots from somewhere, but not close at hand. Then we heard the loud voices outside.|$|R
6000|$|Naturally {{every one}} was astonished, {{and the first}} thought was, What will happen now? Blood would assuredly flow, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> to see-- and how my elder {{brothers}} would envy me! ...|$|E
6000|$|Father Adrian smiled scornfully. [...] "I was {{not bound}} to Cruta," [...] he answered. [...] "There had been complaints, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> to {{investigate}} them. The monastery was poverty and disease-stricken. It is closed now forever." ...|$|E
6000|$|One night I was waked up by folks hollering [...] "Fire!" [...] all around. I {{jumped up}} and dressed and {{went out of the}} hotel to enjoy the scene. When I see it was Mrs. Sampson's house, I gave forth a kind of yell, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> in two minutes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then if it pleases you we {{will all}} dine here that night," [...] Jocelyn Thew suggested, [...] "and I will take you on to the Alhambra for an hour. Doctor Gant <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> our first night in town, and we found the {{performance}} excellent. You will honour me, Miss Beverley?" ...|$|R
5000|$|It <b>is</b> <b>I</b> who <b>am</b> {{the light}} which is above them all. It <b>is</b> <b>I</b> who <b>am</b> the all. From me did the all come forth, and unto me did the all extend.

60|$|DEAR ORION,--At 12.20 this {{afternoon}} {{a line of}} movable types was spaced and justified by machinery, {{for the first time}} in the history of the world! <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> to see. It was done automatically--instantly--perfectly. This is indeed the first line of movable types that ever was perfectly spaced and perfectly justified on this earth.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{lived up}} river with Mrs. Hammond over two years, and then Mr. Hammond died and Mrs. Hammond broke up housekeeping. She divided her {{children}} among her relatives {{and went to}} the States. I {{had to go to the}} asylum at Hopeton, because nobody would take me. They didn't want me at the asylum, either; they said they were over-crowded as it was. But they had to take me <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> four months until Mrs. Spencer came." ...|$|E
60|$|During {{the winter}} in which I reached my twenty fifth year I lived with my mother's brother, Dr. Alfred Morris, in Warburton, a small country town, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> {{beginning}} the practice of medicine. I had been graduated in the spring, and my uncle earnestly advised {{me to come to}} him and act as his assistant, which advice, considering {{the fact that he was}} an elderly man, and that I might hope to succeed him in his excellent practice, was considered good advice by myself and my family.|$|E
5000|$|... "Tweeter and the Monkey Man" [...] {{was really}} by Tom Petty and Bob Dylan. Well, Jeff [...] <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> too, but we <b>were</b> just sitting <b>there</b> {{around in the}} kitchen, and he was for some reason talking about all this stuff that didn't make much sense to me, you know, it was that Americana kinda stuff {{and we got a}} tape {{cassette}} and put it on and then transcribed everything they were saying.|$|R

6000|$|... 22. This {{is one of}} our Court days, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there.</b> I {{told you}} there is a Drawing-room, Wednesday, Thursday, and Saturday. The Hamiltons and Abercorns have done teasing me. The latter, I hear, is {{actually}} going to France. Lord Treasurer quarrelled with me at Court for being four days without dining with him; so I dined there to-day, and he has at last fallen in with my project (as he calls it) of coining halfpence and farthings, with devices, like medals, in honour of the Queen, every year changing the device. I wish it may be done. Nite MD.|$|E
6000|$|... "I haven't got any home nor any folks neither;" [...] and {{the melancholy}} words banished the {{brightness}} from his rough {{face like a}} cloud. [...] "Mother died soon after I got back. Suddin', but she was ready, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there,</b> so she was happy. Jim lived a number of years, and was a sight of care, poor feller; but we managed to rub along, though we had to sell the farm: for I couldn't do much with one arm, and doctor's bills right along stiddy take a heap of money. He was as comfortable as he could be; and, when he was gone, it wasn't no great matter, for there was only me, and I don't mind roughin' it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{the page}} {{did not show}} the enchanted garden, nor the panthers, nor the girl who had led me by the hand, nor the playfellows who had been so loth to let me go. It showed a long grey street in West Kensington, in that chill hour of {{afternoon}} before the lamps are lit, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there,</b> a wretched little figure, weeping aloud, for all that I could do to restrain myself, and I was weeping because I could not return to my dear playfellows who had called after me, 'Come back to us! Come back to us soon!' I was there. This was no page in a book, but harsh reality; that enchanted place and the restraining hand of the grave mother at whose knee I stood had gone--whither had they gone?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} not. Mrs. Lyddell will never treat {{me as if}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> at home, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> afraid <b>there</b> <b>is</b> an honourable man that <b>I</b> must <b>be</b> {{bestowed}} on." ...|$|R

6000|$|The {{next thing}} to which I will ask your {{attention}} is the Judge's comments upon the fact, as he assumes it to be, that we cannot call our public meetings as Republican meetings; and he instances Tazewell County {{as one of}} the places where the friends of Lincoln have called a public meeting and have not dared to name it a Republican meeting. He instances Monroe County as another, where Judge Trumbull and Jehu Baker addressed the persons whom the Judge assumes to be the friends of Lincoln calling them the [...] "Free Democracy." [...] I have the honor to inform Judge Douglas that he spoke in that very county of Tazewell last Saturday, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> on Tuesday last; and when he spoke there, he spoke under a call not venturing to use the word [...] "Democrat." [...] [Turning to Judge Douglas.] what think you of this? ...|$|E
6000|$|Here Mr. Sterne was {{interrupted}} by a monk of the Order of St. Francis, who stepped into the room, and begged us all to take a pinch of his famous old rappee. I suppose the snuff was very pungent, for, with a great start, I woke up; and now perceived that I must have been dreaming altogether. [...] "Dessein's" [...] of now-a-days is not the [...] "Dessein's" [...] which Mr. Sterne, and Mr. Brummell, and I recollect in the good old times. The town of Calais has bought the old hotel, and [...] "Dessein" [...] has gone over to [...] "Quillacq's." [...] <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> yesterday. And I remember old diligences, and old postilions in pigtails and jack-boots, who were once as alive as I am, and whose cracking whips I have heard in the midnight many and many a time. Now, where are they? Behold they have been ferried over Styx, and have passed away into limbo.|$|E
60|$|But, {{to bring}} this long turn of our affairs to a conclusion, {{the first thing we}} had to do was to consult with the captain of the ship, and with the men, and know if they were willing to go to Japan; and, while I was doing this, the young man whom, as I said, my nephew had left with me as my {{companion}} for my travels, came to me and told me that he thought that voyage promised very fair, and that there was a great prospect of advantage, and he would be very glad if I undertook it; but that if I would not, and would give him leave, he would go as a merchant, or how I pleased to order him; and if ever he came to England, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there,</b> and alive, he would render me a faithful account of his success, and it should be as much mine as I pleased.|$|E

6000|$|... "I do please," [...] she declared. [...] "I {{think we}} will go to our own little place--the Café André, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will <b>be</b> <b>there</b> at half-past twelve. You will be waiting for me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then you can {{very easily}} make the move. And {{then if you}} don't feel well at any time you can just go to bed, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> shall <b>be</b> <b>there</b> to look after you." ...|$|R
