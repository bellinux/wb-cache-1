40|$|Tests of cure (TOC) were {{performed}} on specimens from 106 women following treatment for chlamydial infection of the cervix. 91 women attended for the first TOC with enzyme immunoassay (EIA) within one week of <b>finishing</b> <b>antibiotics.</b> Three were EIA positive, 88 were EIA negative. These three women were subsequently EIA and culture negative although they received no further antibiotics. Ninety women returned for the second TOC with EIA and culture between seven and 27 days after completing treatment. All the results were negative. Routine TOC is unnecessary following appropriate antichlamydial therapy. If TOC is indicated antigen-detection methods {{should not be used}} immediately after <b>finishing</b> <b>antibiotics</b> as misleading positive results may be obtained. EIA or culture at one week or later after treatment is reliable...|$|R

5000|$|Phenotype selection: {{bacterial}} populations exploit extrinsic {{noise to}} choose a population subset to enter a quiescent state. In a bacterial infection, for example, this subset will not propagate quickly but will be more robust when the population is threatened by antibiotic treatment: the rapidly replicating, infectious bacteria will be killed more quickly than the quiescent subset, which may be capable of restarting the infection. This phenomenon is why courses of <b>antibiotics</b> should be <b>finished</b> even when symptoms seem to have disappeared; ...|$|R
40|$|Two trials {{involving}} 300 finishing pigs (120 - 220 lbs.) {{were conducted}} to evaluate Tylan, Stafac, Lincomix, and Flavomycin by growth rate and feed efficiency. In trial I, none of the antibiotics improved growth rate or feed efficiency. In trial II, where pigs were more crowded, feeding an antibiotic slightly, but not significantly, increased daily gain (0 to 8 % improvement) and feed efficiency (3 to 9 %), with no significant difference among antibiotics. These studies demonstrate that the response or lack of response to feeding low levels of <b>antibiotics</b> during the <b>finishing</b> phase {{will depend on the}} level of stress imposed...|$|R
40|$|Ninety-six {{cases of}} {{uncomplicated}} acute septic arthritis in children aged 12 years and under were treated by arthrotomy under general anaesthesia, saline washout and antibiotics for six weeks. They were prospectively studied for 24 weeks to assess clinical, haematological and radiological changes. Clinical improvement was most marked {{in the first}} two weeks and did not change significantly after six weeks. Haematological indices (haemoglobin concentration, serum white cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate) all improved from the start of treatment and continued to improve throughout the study, even after <b>antibiotics</b> were <b>finished.</b> Radiological changes in the bone adjacent to the infected joint were noted to be present in 21 cases by two weeks after presentation, and in a further 10 cases by six weeks after presentation, suggesting some continued infective activity in the bone adjacent to the septic joint even after two weeks of antibiotics. No new radiological changes were noted after six weeks. It is therefore suggested that antibiotics in septic arthritis should be continued for six weeks...|$|R
50|$|The Union of Concerned Scientists {{estimate}} healthy hogs receive 5 {{million pounds}} of two tetracycline antibiotics, this is 60% greater than the total volume of antibiotics given to sick humans. Medical doctors advise appropriate use of <b>antibiotics,</b> specifically <b>finishing</b> the full <b>antibiotic</b> regimen with consequence of the strongest survivors recuperating and worsening the infection. Antibiotics create an environment appropriate for bacteria to evolve resistant strains, since when faced with death any survivors have become more appropriately adapted. This is the same principle as Darwinian evolution by natural selection. The development of resistant bacteria strains {{can be attributed to}} antibiotic use because resistance to the drugs was previously unobserved. The World Health Organization states: “Shortly after the licensing and use in livestock of fluoroquinolone, a powerful new class of antimicrobials, fluoroquinolone-resistant Salmonella and Campylobacter isolations from animals, and humans increased.”. Most production for fast food incorporates antibiotics, but there has been a push by major companies including McDonald's, Subway and Carl's Jr. to discontinues fluoroquinolone use in associated feedlots.|$|R

However, {{there is concern}} that the {{presence}} of antimicrobial drugs in hog feed is a factor promoting the development of antimicrobial drug-resistant bacteria. This study uses a sample-selection model to examine the impact that use has on the productivity of U. S. hog operations. The analysis did not find a relationship between productivity and sub-therapeutic <b>antibiotics</b> fed during <b>finishing,</b> but productivity was significantly improved when fed to nursery pigs. Restrictions on feeding antimicrobial drugs during the nursery phase would likely impose significant economic costs on U. S. hog producers. Livestock Production/Industries,...|$|R

40|$|Two feeding trials {{involving}} {{a total of}} 320 head of finishing pigs were {{used to evaluate the}} effect of feeding an antibiotic to three groups selected from within a farrowing group. Pigs were divided by weight into group A (heaviest 50 %), group B (25 - 50 %) and group C (lightest 25 %). Each group was assigned treatments of either 4 weeks of 100 gm of tylan-sulfa followed by 4 weeks of 40 gm/ton of tylan or no antibiotic for the 8 -week trial. All groups responded to antibiotic feeding the initial 4 weeks with improved growth rate. The second 4 weeks resulted in a mixed response in that some groups not receiving antibiotic showed a compensatory gain. No group treatment interaction was observed. Eight-week performance of all groups would not indicate any advantage to feeding <b>antibiotic</b> to the <b>finishing</b> pig, regardless of weight...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{develop an}} {{objective}} measure to enable hospital Trusts to compare {{their use of}} antibiotics. Design: Self-completion, postal questionnaire with telephone follow up. Sample: 4 hospital trusts in the English Midlands. Results: The survey showed {{that it was possible}} to collect data concerning the number of Defined Daily Doses (DDD's) of quinolone <b>antibiotic</b> dispensed per <b>Finished</b> Consultant Episode (FCE) in each Trust [...] In the 4 trusts studied the mean DDD/FCE was 0. 197 (range 0. 117 to 0. 258). This indicates that based on a typical course length of 5 days, 3. 9 % of patient episodes resulted in the prescription of a quinolone antibiotic. Antibiotic prescribing control measures in each Trust were found to be comparable. Conclusion: The measure will enable Trusts to objectively compare their usage of quinolone antibiotics and use this information to carry out clinical audit should differences be recorded. This is likely to be applicable to other groups of antibiotics...|$|R
40|$|Two hundred fifty-five pigs, weaned at 4 wk of age, {{were used}} in an {{experiment}} to compare the efficacy of Bacillus subtilis and antibiotics as growth promoters for swine from nursery to finishing. Treatments were a nonmedicated control; B. subtilis added at 5 x 105, 1 X 106, or 5 x 106 CFU/g feed; or antibiotics (50 g/ton carbadox during the nursery phase and 100 g/ton chlortetracycline in the growing and finishing phases). Average daily gain and average daily feed intake were greater for pigs fed antibiotics in the nursery and grower phases than for pigs fed diets containing no medication or diets containing B. subtilis. Feed to gain ratio was not affected {{by the addition of}} B. subtilis or <b>antibiotics.</b> In the <b>finishing</b> phase, feeding B. subtilis and antibiotic did not affect avg daily gain, avg daily feed intake, or feed to gain ratio. From weaning to market weight, avg daily gain and avg daily feed intake were greater for pigs fed antibiotics than pigs fed the other treatments. Our results indicate that at the levels used in this experiment, feeding B. subtilis is not as effective as feeding antibiotics to improve performance of nursery and growing pigs. Neither B. subtilis nor chlortetracycline affected the performance of finishing pigs...|$|R
40|$|At present, the {{available}} methods to diagnose active H. pylori infection are {{endoscopy with biopsy}} for histology, culture, rapid urease tests, 13 C or 14 C urea breath test, urine antibody and the stool antigen test. The aims {{of this study were}} to simplify the 13 C urea test by measuring 13 C in blood rather than breath, and to evaluate the usefulness of the 13 C urea blood test for the diagnosis of H. pylori infection. Patients who underwent upper endoscopy for standard clinical indications (e. g. dyspepsia, abdominal pain) were enrolled. A total of 161 patients (93 F, 68 M, mean age 47 ± 14. 2) were evaluated; 50 (31 %) of them were H. pylori positive, and 111 (69 %) were H. pylori negative. H. pylori infection was diagnosed with a rapid urease test (CLOtest) and 13 C urea breath test (UBT). Performance characteristics for the 13 C urea blood test for diagnosis and evaluation of H. pylori eradication were calculated using UBT and CLO as gold standards. The fifty H. pylori-positive patients were treated with triple antibiotic therapy for two weeks. Four weeks after <b>finishing</b> <b>antibiotic</b> therapy patients were retested with a commercial UBT and urea blood test. The 13 C blood test had sensitivities of 92 and 98 % and specificities of 96 and 100 % as compared with urea breath test and CLO, respectively. We conclude that the 13 C urea blood test is highly sensitive and specific for the initial diagnosis and control of eradication of H. pylori infection...|$|R
40|$|Bacterial source {{tracking}} (BST) methods often {{involve the}} use of phenotypic or genotypic fingerprinting techniques to compare indicator bacteria such as Escherichia coli isolated from unknown sources against a library of fingerprints from indicator bacteria found in the feces of various known source animals. The predictive capability of a library is {{based in part on}} how well the library isolates reflect the true population diversity of indicator bacteria that can potentially impact a water body. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the behavior of E. coli population structures in the feces of humans, beef cattle and horses across different parameters. Ribotyping and antibiotic resistance analysis were used to 2 ̆ 2 fingerprint 2 ̆ 2, or subtype E. coli isolates. Significantly greater diversity was observed in the E. coli population of horses compared to the human or beef cattle sampled. Subtype sharing between individuals from all host categories was infrequent, therefore the majority of E. coli subtypes were sampled from a single individual. The dominant E. coli populations of nine individuals (three per host source category) were monitored over time, which demonstrated that E. coli subtypes within a host individual vary on a monthly time frame, and an increase in the frequency of subtype sharing was noted between individuals within the same source group over time. The E. coli population of a single human that had just <b>finished</b> <b>antibiotic</b> treatment was studied on a daily basis for one month. The loss of an E. coli subtype with high antibiotic resistance was observed over time, however there was a single dominant E. coli subtype that was present at every sampling event during the entire month. Geographic distinctiveness of E. coli populations was investigated by sampling four herds located in different geographical regions. We observed that E. coli populations are not geographically distinct, but are somewhat individual-specific, as most E. coli isolates had a subtype that was found in a single individual. This study defines factors that should be considered when constructing a successful BST library, and suggests that E. coli may not be the appropriate indicator organism for BST...|$|R
