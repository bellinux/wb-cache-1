500|$|It {{was during}} one of Jackson's calls to Presley that he {{proposed}} marriage. [...] "If I <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> marry me, would you do it?", the singer queried. Though still married to actor Danny Keough, whom she had wed in 1988 and had two children with, Presley replied that she would. After a pause, Jackson exclaimed {{that he had to}} use the bathroom. Having apparently relieved himself, the singer explained to his new fiancee that his love for her was genuine and she had to believe him. In 2010, Presley acknowledged to Oprah Winfrey that Jackson did formally propose one day in the library, taking out a 10 carat diamond ring and getting down on his knees.|$|E

500|$|Jackson {{proposed}} to Presley {{over the telephone}} towards the fall of 1993, saying: [...] "If I <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> marry me, would you do it?" [...] They married in the Dominican Republic in secrecy, denying it for nearly two months afterwards. The marriage was, in her words, [...] "a married couple's life ... that was sexually active." [...] The tabloid media speculated that the wedding was a ploy to prop up Jackson's public image. The marriage ended {{less than two years}} later with an amicable divorce settlement. In a 2010 interview with Oprah, Presley said they had spent four more years after the divorce [...] "getting back together and breaking up" [...] until she decided to stop.|$|E
500|$|... "We {{came up with}} a {{narrative}} device to really explore Walter's feelings. We had largely all the elements of the episode in place and Fox called and said, 'Hey, how would you guys feel about if we <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> have some musical element in the show? Anything, like just feature a song playing.' They didn't ask us to do Glee. And we instantly, before we got off the phone, said, 'Well, this is what we're thinking for the episode and here's an idea how that could work for us.' We turned their request into what felt like a positive for us and really deepened and sort of blew the episode out even further in the direction we were already taking it".|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{first met}} Lisa Marie Presley (and Elvis Presley) in 1974, during a Jackson 5 {{engagement}} at the MGM Grand. In November 1992, Jackson was reconnected with Presley through a mutual friend, staying in contact {{almost every day}} by telephone. As the child sexual abuse accusations became public, he became dependent on Presley for emotional support; she was concerned about his faltering health and his addiction to drugs. She explained, [...] "I believed he didn't do anything wrong {{and that he was}} wrongly accused and yes I started falling for him. I wanted to save him. I felt that I could do it." [...] In one phone call he made to her, she described him as high, incoherent and delusional. He proposed to her over the phone towards the fall of 1993, saying, [...] "If I <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> marry me, would you do it?". The marriage was, in her words, [...] "a married couple's life ... that was sexually active". They divorced fewer than two years later, remaining friendly.|$|E

500|$|At Trenton, Washington faced a dilemma. All but {{a handful}} of his men's enlistments were expiring on December 31, and he knew that the army would {{collapse}} unless he convinced them to stay. So, on the 30th, Washington appealed to his men to stay one month longer for a bounty of ten dollars. He asked any men who wanted to volunteer to poise their firelocks, but not a man turned out. Washington then wheeled his horse around and rode in front of the troops, saying [...] "My brave fellows, you have done all I <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do, and more than could be reasonably expected; but your country is at stake, your wives, your houses and all that you hold dear. You have worn yourselves out with fatigues and hardships, but we know not how to spare you. If you will consent to stay only one month longer, you will render that service to the cause of liberty and to your country which you probably never can do under any other circumstances." [...] At first no one stepped forward, but then one soldier stepped forward, and he was followed by most of the others, leaving only a few in the original line.|$|E
500|$|John Slattery, who {{was later}} cast as Roger Sterling, {{originally}} auditioned to portray Don Draper. Slattery felt Don was the show's biggest draw and was disappointed upon hearing of his character's sparse screen time. He recalled, [...] "I really did prepare {{the thing and}} went in and I worked hard on it and then read for Don and they actually gave me adjustments and I went and I did it again. And then they sort of said, 'Well, look, here’s the deal. We have a guy. The reason we <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> come in and read for Draper is because we didn't think that you’d come in a read for Roger because there wasn’t that much Roger in the script.'" [...] During production of [...] "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes," [...] Slattery admitted he was unsure of whether to continue working on Mad Men. [...] "I was on the fence a little bit, even while shooting it. And I think Matt finally was like, 'Look man, we’re not jerking you around here. We’re serious about this and I’ve really thought this out. I promise you {{this will be a}} great character {{and it will be a}} big part of the show.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In early October 2014, Kilbey {{explained}} that Willson-Piper was {{not asked to}} leave the band, {{but that he had}} simply not replied to the various attempts made to contact him (Willson-Piper had relocated to Sweden). Realizing that Willson-Piper would not respond, and in agreement with Powles at the time, [...] Kilbey said [...] "Yes, we have to find someone with stature. He has to have his own trip, he can’t be some weedy little guy coming in to play guitar. It has to be somebody with experience and gravitas." [...] As part of the same interview, Haug {{explained that}} he had {{received a phone call from}} Kilbey while he was returning home from a funeral. Without first greeting Haug, Kilbey simply asked, [...] "If I <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> join The Church, what would you say?" [...] and ended the call after Haug's affirmative, but bewildered, response. Haug said that joining the Church was the [...] "last thing" [...] that would have entered his mind, but that [...] "it just really seemed to work".|$|E

2500|$|When Chauvel {{arrived in}} Damascus, {{he told his}} staff [...] "to pitch my camp in a clean orchard {{just out of the}} city, which I thought would suit me better after what I had seen of the place. I then went back to my camp, had lunch, and became {{immersed}} in problems of supply, collection of prisoners, orders for the morrow, etc., sending off first of all an aeroplane message to Lord Allenby, telling him what I had done." [...] He also sent for the British Supply Officer of the Hejaz Forces. [...] "Before discussing supply matters, however, he ... said 'they are out to make as little as possible of the British and make the populace think that it is the Arabs who have driven out the Turk. This is why Lawrence <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> keep your men out of the city and they have no intention of asking you for any police.' He also said 'They are getting the British Consulate ready for you. If you go there you are not defining yourself as the Conqueror of this country, but rather as a contributory ally. You should take possession of Djemal Pasha's house, which is the best one in the place, and which they are reserving for Feisal.' He said there was absolute chaos in the city, the Bazaars were closed and all the better class of people were terrified at the idea of the Hejaz crowd being in charge." [...] As a result, Chauvel decided to march through the city the following day, with [...] "practically every unit being represented; guns, armoured cars, everything, and I also took possession of Djemal's house." ...|$|E
