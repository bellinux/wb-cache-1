After moving to New York City, he began to attend rehab, a process which would inspire the fifth Reggie and the Full Effect album, Last Stop: Crappy Town.

5|$|In 2007, Smith {{appeared}} as Henry in the Polly Stenham play That Face at the Royal Court Theatre Upstairs in Chelsea. The play {{transferred to the}} Duke of York's Theatre in the West End in 2008 and became Smith's second role there. That Face focuses primarily upon <b>alcohol</b> <b>and</b> <b>drug</b> addiction in an upper-middle-class family after the paternal figure in the family leaves. As Henry, Smith portrayed an aspiring artist who left school {{to take care of}} his mother. To prepare for the role, the cast interviewed alcoholics and their families. Smith discussed his character's relationship with his mother in a May 2008 interview with the Evening Standard.|$|E
5|$|In August 1979, {{after two}} warm-up shows in Copenhagen, Led Zeppelin headlined two concerts at the Knebworth Music Festival, playing {{to a crowd}} of {{approximately}} 104,000 on the first night. A brief, low-key European tour was undertaken in June and July 1980, featuring a stripped-down set without the usual lengthy jams and solos. On 27 June, at a show in Nuremberg, Germany, the concert {{came to an abrupt}} halt {{in the middle of the}} third song, when Bonham collapsed onstage and was rushed to hospital. Speculation in the press suggested that his collapse had been the result of excessive <b>alcohol</b> <b>and</b> <b>drug</b> use, but the band claimed that he had simply overeaten.|$|E

50|$|The Journal of Studies on <b>Alcohol</b> <b>and</b> <b>Drugs</b> (JSAD) is a peer-reviewed {{scientific}} {{journal that}} publishes original research articles on {{various aspects of}} the use <b>and</b> misuse of <b>alcohol</b> <b>and</b> other <b>drugs.</b> Topics covered include the biological, medical, epidemiological, social, psychological, and legal aspects of <b>alcohol</b> <b>and</b> other <b>drug</b> use, abuse, <b>and</b> dependence. The journal was established in 1940 as the Quarterly Journal of Studies on Alcohol, changed its name in 1975 to Journal of Studies on Alcohol, before obtaining its current name in 2007. The journal appears bimonthly and publishes supplements at irregular intervals. The Journal of Studies on <b>Alcohol</b> <b>and</b> <b>Drugs</b> is a not-for-profit journal based in the Center of Alcohol Studies at Rutgers University.|$|R

5|$|In August 1979, {{the band}} entered Wessex Studios to begin {{recording}} London Calling. The Clash asked Guy Stevens {{to produce the}} album, much {{to the dismay of}} CBS Records. Stevens had <b>alcohol</b> <b>and</b> <b>drug</b> problems and his production methods were unconventional. During a recording session he swung a ladder and upturned chairs – apparently to create a rock & roll atmosphere. The Clash, especially bassist Paul Simonon, got along well with Stevens, and found Stevens' work to be very helpful and productive to both Simonon's playing and their recording as a band. The album was recorded during a five- to six-week period involving 18-hour days, with many songs recorded in one or two takes.|$|E
