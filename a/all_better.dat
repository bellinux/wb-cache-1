Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their book}} Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode two stars out of five, calling it [...] "a particularly superficial addition to the series". Shearman and Pearson felt that the episode's lack of complexity was refreshing, but ultimately the [...] "awkward" [...] performances and [...] "cheesy" [...] approach to its subject matter detracted from it. Writing for The A.V. Club, Todd VanDerWerff rated the episode a B, describing it as [...] "an episode {{about a man who}} finds himself trying to lose his faith but being unable to do so". VanDerWerff felt that the episode suffered from [...] "the typical Millennium problems", including [...] "an overreliance on trite philosophical dialogue"; however, he found that it contained [...] "something pure and believable at its core that keeps the episode moving along nicely". The episode's thematic concern with {{the role of religion in}} society was noted as being [...] "the tension Millennium would build its best episodes on". Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated [...] "Kingdom Come" [...] 5 out of 5, describing it as being [...] "classic Millennium". Gibron felt that the episode had [...] "an exceptional script that delightfully fails to spell everything out for us up front", and noted that it served as [...] "the blueprint for <b>all</b> <b>better</b> Millennium episodes to come".|$|E
2500|$|The {{meeting on}} 4 February 1985 went badly for the councils, with Jenkin refusing to abandon rate capping and grant penalties; Jenkin {{declared}} {{his willingness to}} meet the councils again {{if they wanted to}} negotiate. Shortly before, Labour leader Neil Kinnock had made clear his opposition to the policy of not setting a rate; he declared at the Labour Party local government conference that what Labour supporters were saying was [...] "Better a dented shield than no shield at <b>all.</b> <b>Better</b> a Labour council doing its best to help us than Government [...] extending the full force of Government policy". He saw the strategy as a gesture which would not help protect services. Notwithstanding his criticism, 26 councils were still considering defying the law.|$|E
2500|$|Te Ngutu o Te Manu was a {{shattering}} {{defeat for}} the Europeans, {{on a similar}} magnitude to the Battle of Puketakuere during the First Taranaki War. Contemporary writers described the loss as [...] "the most serious and complete defeat ever experienced by the colonial forces" [...] and [...] "the most disastrous affair that ever took place in New Zealand". Von Tempsky's death {{came as a shock}} to his military followers and to his wider audience of admirers throughout New Zealand. In the minds of the Pākeha public, von Tempsky was a dashing hero of the New Zealand wars, whose fearlessness and ability to survive near-misses gave him an aura of invincibility. One newspaper correspondent wrote: [...] "Unless something is done and done quickly we had <b>all</b> <b>better</b> clear out." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{moderate}} leadership {{continued to}} support PNL policies, even with Banghereanu jailed. At the 6th PSDMR Congress of April 1899, Diamandy and Morțun presented {{a motion to}} transform the party into a more moderate unit, called [...] "National Democratic" [...] or [...] "Progressive Democratic". According to labor historian Constantin Titel Petrescu, the Congress was a sham, with many important activists absent, and with Jewish members stripped of their voting privileges, on Diamandy's own initiative. In his own view, Diamandy was still persuaded that [...] "intransigent" [...] socialism could eventually work in Romania, and considered methods to prolong the PSDMR's survival. Speaking at the Congress, he warned that the PSDMR was already an [...] "anti-Marxist" [...] group dedicated to a [...] "top-down revolution", which had only managed to set up [...] "a socialist general staff", and could not claim to have improved the workers' lives. The alternative, he argued, was class collaboration, which meant attracting [...] "into our ranks <b>all</b> <b>better</b> elements of the bourgeoisie".|$|E
