40|$|The Learning in Smaller Companies (LISC) {{project was}} {{undertaken}} to develop links between academic institutions and work-based learning in Scotland. The University of Stirling worked with Falkirk College and Clackmannan College {{to create a}} number of work-based learning schemes for employers in small and medium-sized enterprises. The programs were designed for delivery at various academic levels from pre-higher to postgraduate education and {{in a range of}} modes, including traditionally assessed courses and portfolio schemes based on <b>accreditation</b> <b>of</b> <b>competence.</b> The LISC project emphasized flexible delivery schemes compatible to employers' needs and an overall framework that is based on <b>accreditation</b> <b>of</b> <b>competence.</b> The following programs have been delivered through the LISC project: Scottish Vocational Qualifications; Scottish Vocational Education Council National Certificate modules; Higher National Certificate qualifications; University Access courses; and the postgraduate Certificate in Small and Medium Enterprise Management. During the past 2 years, 28 companies within the geographic area covered by Forth Valley Enterprise have participated in the project. The project has attracted small and medium-sized firms {{from a wide range of}} industrial and commercial sectors...|$|R
40|$|The United Kingdom has a {{long and}} {{evolving}} history of public health education. From the initiation of formal standardised training for Medical Officers for Health in the early 1900 s, to the current national public health training programme, public health education has adapted to the changing contexts of public health practice. Whilst the profession was originally only a medical specialty, subsequent re­­cognition of the skills and contribution of the wider public health workforce has led to changes in professional specialist training for public health, which is now open to non-medical applicants. This well-established professional training scheme allows the formal <b>accreditation</b> <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> in {{a broad range of}} public health skills. The academic component of public health training is provided by a rapidly growing number of postgraduate courses. Once confined to the UK’s first school of public health, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and a handful of British Universities, the current 60 or so courses across the country are found in diverse university settings. Quality and standards in higher education are monitored by the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education but there are no other professional accreditation schemes for postgraduate courses in public health nationally. Public health education and training continues to face challenges in the UK, notably the current government plans for major restructuring of the National Health Service (NHS) which threatens the loss of traditional NHS training placements and has created uncertainty around how professional training might be structured in the future. Whilst the long established tradition of public health education and more recent adoption of competency-based approaches to training gives some flexibility to meet these challenges, insight and innovative responses are required to ensure that public health education and training are not destabilised by these challenges. Revisions of the curricula of postgraduate courses and the competencies required for professional accreditation along with provision of experience in the new locations where public health is to be practiced in the future will be key to ensuring that public health professionals are ready to tackle the key issues that confront them...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{creation}} of the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) has evidenced {{the need for the}} development of language policies at universities. University-based language centres have made a great contribution to the development of language learning since their emergence and have {{played a major role in}} the development and implementation of language policies and language education. In addition to teaching and training Language Centres have another important function as university students are now required to prove their language competence at different stages during their university studies for mobility, graduating, entrance to master programmes, etc., as well as for better job opportunities in the international market. This new function of language centres can be defined as the need for the development of more reliable systems for the <b>accreditation</b> or certification <b>of</b> language <b>competence</b> which will provide a basis for comparability of levels of assessment at European level. As a consequence, national language associations throughout Europe are immersed in a process for the design of a common model for the <b>accreditation</b> <b>of</b> language <b>competence</b> in higher education institutions that allows for comparability in achievement across languages and institutions, but which at the same time, allows for degrees of variation and the possibility to reflect the specific needs and aims of the different institutions. In the present work we describe the evolution <b>of</b> the <b>accreditation</b> process in Europe, with special attention to the model developed by the Spanish Association of Higher Education Language Centres (ACLES) ...|$|R

40|$|The age of accountability, {{evolving}} from outcome- and standards-based practices, is {{prevalent in}} the education, healthcare, and counseling fields. In regards to standards, counselor education is framed by the Council for <b>Accreditation</b> <b>of</b> Counseling and Related Educational Programs (CACREP) for best practices in terms of content knowledge; however the assessment <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> <b>of</b> that knowledge is not easily defined. Furthermore, school counselors are held {{to the standards of}} the American School Counselor Association (ASCA) to practice within a certain scope of competence; however, the determination of that level is also not easily or clearly defined. This research sought to investigate credentialing exams and their relationship to competence for school counselors by examining Praxis II: School Guidance and Counseling exam results based on <b>accreditation</b> <b>of</b> participants’ graduate-level school counseling program. This study found no statistically significant effect between <b>accreditation</b> <b>of</b> the participants’ graduate-level school counseling program and results on the Praxis II exam. Likewise, no statistically significant relationship between age, gender, ethnicity, or GPA and Praxis II results was found. Further research, both quantitative and qualitative, should be conducted to investigate the relationship between accreditation and exam results. Last, alignment between counselor education program objectives, standards, and assessment should be strengthened to gain a better grasp on attaining competence...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Health care is to {{some extent}} {{influenced}} {{by the results of}} laboratory tests. In order to provide the best care for the patient, laboratories must seek to achieve high levels <b>of</b> quality and <b>competence.</b> International Standard ISO 15189 specifies these requirements and may be used by laboratories to perform accredited genetic tests of materials derived from the human body. Here we describe the procedures to establish <b>Accreditation</b> <b>of</b> DNA sequencing in our laboratory and the first <b>Accreditation</b> <b>of</b> its kind in Portugal. Methods: Our laboratory started to prepare to comply with ISO 15189 Accreditation requirements for DNA sequencing in 2010. Documents describing administrative and technical procedures of the sequencing workflow including sample registries, laboratory protocols, operation and maintenance of equipments, as well as preparation and use of reagents were produced. Regular examination of laboratory equipments by an external entity was implemented to confirm compliance with working requirements. Requisites for personnel training and demonstration <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> were also implemented. The laboratory participated regularly in the DNA sequencing scheme organized by the European Molecular Genetics Quality Network (EMQN). Results: The laboratory obtained formal recognition by Instituto Português de Acreditação (IPAC) in May 2014. A maximum genotyping score for DNA sequencing has been obtained in the external quality assessment scheme since 2010. Sequencing quality measured in terms of the quality read overlap metrics is currently of approximately 96 % according to the EMQN scheme. The laboratory processes and analyzes an average of 28. 750 samples per year. Discussion: <b>Accreditation</b> <b>of</b> a genetic test under ISO 15189 is a highly demanding and laborious task for a genetic laboratory. However, it is an important step in order to guarantee the highest quality and reproducibility of genetic test results...|$|R
