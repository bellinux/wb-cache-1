25|$|Later that July, three militants {{originally}} born in East Nusa Tenggara, {{convicted murderer}} Tibo, Dominggus da Silva and Don Marinus Riwu, were apprehended {{on suspicion of}} organising the massacre. In 2001 a three-judge court, after hearing testimony from 28 witnesses, convicted Tibo {{as the leader of}} a Christian militia called the Red Group, and found that da Silva was one of his commanders <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Riwu took part in the killings. Though the defense claimed Tibo may have been little more than a hired thug, all three were sentenced to death by firing squad and executed in September 2006 for their crimes.|$|E
25|$|Salisbury {{was charged}} with violent assault and tried at the Old Bailey on 24 April 1723. Her lawyer claimed that the act had not been premeditated <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Finch's {{forgiveness}} should count in her favour. The defence also tried to argue that Sally had acted to defend her sister from Mr. Finch's dishonorable amorous intentions, rather than from jealousy. The prosecution mocked her reputation and claimed that Finch's forgiveness showed only his amiable character and offered nothing {{in the way of}} mitigation. The jury found her guilty of assaulting and wounding Finch but acquitted her of intent to murder. She was sentenced to pay a fine of 100 pounds, a year's imprisonment and to find sureties for her behaviour for two years.|$|E
25|$|In Sentell v. New Orleans and Carrollton Railroad Company, 166 U.S. 698 (1897), Mr. Sentell {{sued the}} New Orleans and Carrollton Railroad Company {{to recover the}} value of his female Newfoundland dog that he alleged to have been negligently killed by the {{railroad}} company. The company claimed that Louisiana law held that only people who licensed their dogs were entitled to sue for compensation if the dog were killed, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Sentell was not entitled to damages since he had not licensed his dog. The trial court in Orleans Parish found for Mr. Sentell and awarded him $250 US, so the railroad company appealed to the Louisiana Court of Appeal, which reversed the decision of the trial court. The Louisiana Supreme Court declined to hear the case, so Mr. Sentell then appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, which agreed to hear the case.|$|E

25|$|When HSV {{particles}} {{are exposed to}} doses of a DNA damaging agent that would be lethal in single infections, but are then allowed to undergo multiple infection (i.e. two or more viruses per host cell), MR is observed. Enhanced survival of HSV-1 due to MR occurs upon exposure to different DNA damaging agents, including methyl methanesulfonate, trimethylpsoralen (which causes inter-strand DNA cross-links), and UV light. After treatment of genetically marked HSV with trimethylpsoralen, recombination between the marked viruses increases, suggesting that trimethylpsoralen damage stimulates recombination. MR of HSV appears to partially depend on the host cell recombinational repair machinery since skin fibroblast cells defective in a component of this machinery (i.e. cells from Bloom’s syndrome patients) are deficient in MR. These observations suggest that MR in HSV infections involves genetic recombination between damaged viral genomes resulting in production of viable progeny viruses. HSV-1, upon infecting host cells, induces inflammation and oxidative stress. Thus {{it appears that the}} HSV genome may be subjected to oxidative DNA damage during infection, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>MR</b> may enhance viral survival and virulence under these conditions.|$|E
500|$|The {{idea for}} the show came from Conan O'Brien, who thought of Marge getting {{a job at the}} power plant <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Burns has a crush on her. The animators had trouble animating Marge with the suit and lipstick. Director Jeff Lynch said there were a few scenes where Marge [...] "looks like a monster". All the jargon used by Troy McClure was {{accurately}} taken from a Time–Life foundation repair book. The original subplot for the episode was Mr. Burns telling Homer to dress up as Mister Atom and have him go to schools to talk to the children. The cast really liked Tom Jones as a guest star. They said he was fun to work with, and was really nice, and even offered to perform a concert after he was done recording lines.|$|E
500|$|Sheppard's tale was revived in {{the first}} half of the 19th century. [...] A melodrama, Jack Sheppard, The Housebreaker, or London in 1724, by W. T. Moncrieff was {{published}} in 1825. [...] More successful was William Harrison Ainsworth's third novel, entitled Jack Sheppard, which was originally published in Bentley's Miscellany from January 1839 with illustrations by George Cruikshank, overlapping with the final episodes of Charles Dickens' Oliver Twist. [...] An archetypal Newgate novel, it generally remains close to the facts of Sheppard's life, but portrays him as a swashbuckling hero. [...] Like Hogarth's prints, the novel pairs the descent of the [...] "idle" [...] apprentice into crime with the rise of a typical melodramatic character, Thames Darrell, a foundling of aristocratic birth who defeats his evil uncle to recover his fortune. [...] Cruikshank's images perfectly complemented Ainsworth's tale—Thackeray wrote that [...] "...Mr Cruickshank really created the tale, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr</b> Ainsworth, as it were, only put words to it." [...] The novel quickly became very popular: it was published in book form later that year, before the serialised version was completed, and even outsold early editions of Oliver Twist. [...] Ainsworth's novel was adapted into a successful play by John Buckstone in October 1839 at the Adelphi Theatre starring (strangely enough) Mary Anne Keeley; indeed, it seems likely that Cruikshank's illustrations were deliberately created in a form that were informed by, and would be easy to repeat as, tableaux on stage. [...] It has been described as the [...] "exemplary climax" [...] of [...] "the pictorial novel dramatized pictorially".|$|E

2500|$|The {{relationship}} between Ainsworth and Cruikshank continued until Saint James's, the final novel {{that the two}} worked together on. It is possible that it resulted from Ainsworth selling his magazine or that Ainsworth drifted from Cruikshank after not needing an illustrator for some time. Of the {{relationship between}} author and illustrator, the Athenaeum printed a review which claimed that it was [...] "doubtful whether the plates were etched for the book, or the book written to illustrate the plates" [...] but stated such with a negative purpose. This was followed by those like William Makepeace Thackeray that complimented the power of Cruikshank's illustrations on the story: [...] "With regard to the modern romance of 'Jack Sheppard' [...] {{it seems to us}} that Mr. Cruikshank really created the tale, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Ainsworth, as it were, only put words to it." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 23 January 1643 the House of Commons {{resolved}} [...] "That the Profits {{belonging to}} the Parish Church of St. Albon's, Woodstreet, shall be forthwith sequestred: <b>And</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Fisher, an orthodox Divine, be appointed to preach there to the Parishioners, in the Stead and Place of Dr. Watts; and to receive the Profits thereof." [...] The House of Lords confirmed this on 3 March, giving considerably more detail of the case, which increases the probability {{that this was the}} Samuel Fisher who had been driven out of Shropshire. Watts had been missing for six months, apparently took part in the Battle of Brentford on the royalist side and was rumoured to be serving as chaplain to Prince Rupert. A committee of sequestrators was empowered to seize the property and income of the church and to pay [...] "Samuell Fisher, Master of Arts, a Godly, Learned, and Orthodox Divine, who is hereby appointed and required to preach every Lords-day, and to officiate as Parson, and to take Care for the Discharge of the Cure of the said Place in all the Duties thereof..." [...] The new incumbent resigned in 1646, which fits well with the re-appearance of Samuel Fisher in Shropshire in August of that year.|$|E

He explains that he wanted each family {{to see each other}} as they really were, and that he sees the Sycamores as [...] "normal", that they are a family that loves and understands one another, saying that Mr. Kirby never had time to understand Tony. Grandpa tells Mr. Kirby that he's happy with no longer working and getting to enjoy life every day, and that has made him happy ever since, though Mr. Kirby is not convinced, especially as Grandpa suspects that Mr. Kirby doesn't like his job. Tony affirms this by pointing out that he found letters that Mr. Kirby had written to his father, expressing desires to be a trapeze artist and later a saxophone player, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Kirby still has a saxophone in his closet. Grandpa tells Mr. Kirby that he should get to enjoy his life and riches now while he can, pointing out, [...] "you can't take it with you." [...] Tony agrees with this, deciding to leave the family business to do something he wants to do, and Mr. Kirby finally gives in, giving his blessings to Alice and Tony getting back together, which they do.|$|E
2500|$|... "Omichund, his {{confidential}} servant, as he thought, {{told his}} master {{of an agreement}} made between the English and Monsieur Duprée [...] to attack him, and received for that advice a sum of not less than four lacks of rupees. Finding {{this to be the}} man in whom the nawab entirely trusted, it soon became our object to consider him as a most material engine in the intended revolution. We therefore made such an agreement as was necessary for the purpose, and entered into a treaty with him to satisfy his demands. When all things were prepared, and the evening of the event was appointed, Omichund informed Mr. Watts, who was at the court of the nawab, that he insisted upon thirty lacks of rupees, and five per cent. upon all the treasure that should be found; that, unless that was immediately complied with, he would disclose the whole to the nawab; <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Watts, and the two other English gentlemen then at the court, should be cut off before the morning. Mr. Watts, immediately on this information, dispatched an express to me at the council. I did not hesitate to find out a stratagem to save the lives of these people, and secure success to the intended event. For this purpose we signed another treaty. The one was called the Red, the other the White treaty. This treaty was signed by every one, except admiral Watson; and I should have considered myself sufficiently authorised to put his name to it, by the conversation I had with him. As to the person who signed admiral Watson's name to the treaty, whether he did it in his presence or not, I cannot say; but this I know, that he thought he had sufficient authority for so doing. This treaty was immediately sent to Omichund, who did not suspect the stratagem. The event took place, and success attended it; and the House, I am fully persuaded, will agree with me, that, when the very existence of the Company was at stake, and the lives of these people so precariously situated, and so certain of being destroyed, {{it was a matter of}} true policy and of justice to deceive so great a villain." ...|$|E
