40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} get rid of health hazard of {{asbestos}} fiber, a new kind of non-asbestos fiber reinforce composite by beater-addition process, which is used for sealing and gasket, has been developed to replace traditional asbestos gasket materials. The mechanical properties of the new composite were tested, and the performance between it and asbestos sheet paper were contrasted. Results show that the density, cross direction tensile strength, machine direction tensile strength and ignition loss at temperature of 300 °C of the new composite are 1. 19 g/cm 3, 2. 62 MPa, 3. 15 MPa and 15. 61 % respectively, while the performances of <b>asbestos</b> <b>paper</b> produced under the same condition are 1. 26 g/cm 3, 2. 87 MPa, 3. 24 MPa and 12. 03 % respectively. Excellent performance, low cost and simple manufacture process of the new composite make it is possible to substitute traditional <b>asbestos</b> <b>paper</b> and apply widely...|$|E
40|$|The present {{paper is}} a {{critical}} reflection on the surface consolidation regarding the materials used in modern buildings with an acknowledged value of cultural heritage. The acknowledgment of the historical and artistic value of a modern building does not simply entail the necessity of operating according to the common standards of building maintenance but also the necessity of applying the preservation criteria. Consequently, {{it is important to}} develop an in-depth theoretical analysis of the criteria and methodologies for the conservation of modern buildings, in particular as regards surface consolidation. The following materials were analysed: finished concrete, ceramic coatings and plaster surfaces containing <b>asbestos.</b> The <b>paper</b> aims to understand whether the conservation principles applied to historic buildings are suitable for reproducible and serial materials which are close to our technologies...|$|R
40|$|It is more {{customary}} {{in assessing}} new product development and marketing {{success and failure}} stories to discuss the " lessons learnt" in terms of marketing theory and practice rather than in terms of any virtues that {{might or might not}} have been revealed.

40|$|Abstract [...] A {{survey of}} the {{asbestos}} fibre concentrations associated with work involving asbestos insulating materials has been undertaken i Devonport Dockyard. The results show that application and removal of asbestos materials both create high dust concentrations, and measures to reduce the health hazards associated with such processes a e described. The results of sampling after the introduction of preventive measures are briefly presented and these results indicate thatthe precautions are effective in reducing the asbestos dust concen-trations in shipyard insulation processes.

40|$|The drywall {{construction}} {{trade has}} in the past been associated with exposure to airborne <b>asbestos</b> fibres. This <b>paper</b> reports a drywall construction worker with 32 years of dust exposure who developed dyspnoea and diminished diffusing capacity, and showed diffuse irregular opacities on chest radiography. He did not respond to treatment with corticosteroids. Open lung biopsy examination showed desquamative interstitial pneumonia. Only a single ferruginous body was seen on frozen section, but tissue examination by electron microscopy showed an extraordinary pulmonary burden of mineral dust with especially high concentrations of chrysotile asbestos fibres. This report emphasises the need to consider asbestos fibre as an agent in the aetiology of desquamative interstitial pneumonia. The coexistent slight interstitial fibrosis present in this case is also considered to have resulted from exposure to mineral dust, particularly ultramicroscopic asbestos fibres...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to review {{research}} in the health effects and risks associated with exposure to asbestos and then to use this scientific evidence to analyze the implications of Canada’s current policy on the use, manufacturing and export of asbestos. The review begins with a brief historical introduction to asbestos, and then moves on to look at the risks associated with asbestos exposure. Epidemiological and in vitro studies are then analyzed to determine the health risks of asbestos, with a specific focus on the different effects of serpentine and amphibole <b>asbestos</b> fibres.

40|$|I {{would like}} to make a few {{comments}} and pose a question or two concerning the question of the lymphohematogenous spread of <b>asbestos.</b> The <b>paper</b> by Godwin and Jagatic (1) {{is one of the more}} important publications that I have come across concerning the distribution of fibers in patients in whom there was both asbestosis and mesothelioma. This study was done very carefully and demonstrated rather nicely the presence of fibers in various organs throughout the body including the spleen and lymph nodes, hilar lymph nodes particularly. Another study with of considerable interest is by Kanazawa et al. (2). They injected crocidolite subcutaneously in rats and found the regional lymph nodes to be rather heavily involved by these fibers. The fact that these fibers apparently can cross various natural barriers such as the endothelial wall and the gastric, small intestinal, and even colonic epithelium seems to be fairly well shown. This raises several very interesting questions. Those of us who have had an opportunity over the years to look at the gastric and intestinal mucosa are very impressed by the dynamic nature of this epithelial surface. The epithelial surface of the gastro intestinal tract is a highly dynamic structure, the cells changing shape and size continuously. The renewal rate varies somewhat, but is in the range of 2 - 5 days. So when you have a very dynamic situation all sorts of things can happen, including the insorption of relatively large particles, which you would not ordinarily predict from the static...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND—A factory fire in Tranmere, Merseyside, England, {{deposited}} asbestos containing fallout in {{an urban}} area. There was considerable community anxiety for months after the incident. Therefore {{an assessment of the}} long term health risks of this acute environmental incident were requested by the local health authority.  METHODS—The facts of the incident were gathered and appraised from unpublished and press reports, involved personnel, and further analysis of material collected {{at the time of the}} incident. The literature on the long term health risks of asbestos was reviewed, and combined with evidence on asbestos exposure to estimate community health risk.  RESULTS—Risk was almost entirely from exposure to fire fallout of chrysotile in <b>asbestos</b> bitumen <b>paper</b> covering the factory roof. Amosite was only detected in a few samples and in trace amounts. The number of people who lived in the area of fallout was 16   000 to 48   000. From a non-threshold model with assumptions likely to overestimate risk, the lung cancer risk is estimated to be undetectably small. Risk of mesothelioma from chrysotile exposure, and risks of lung cancer and mesothelioma from amosite exposure were based on observational studies and were estimated to be even lower than that of lung cancer risk from chrysotile exposure. Academically, there are assumptions that while reasonable cannot be proven, for example, the validity of extrapolating observed risk from much higher exposures to lower exposures, estimates of individual exposure, and that there is no threshold for asbestos to cause cancer.  CONCLUSIONS—The author is unaware of a similar study on long term health risks in a community exposed to asbestos in a fire. It is concluded that, using methods that do not underestimate risk, risk is undetectably small. Practical lessons from this methodology and approach to health risk assessment are discussed.    Keywords: asbestos; environmental pollutants; mesothelioma; health risk assessment; lung cance...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper to explore the grand {{narrative}} of two industrial asbestos giants James Hardie Industries Ltd (James Hardie) and Turner 2 ̆ 6 Newall (UK) through annual reports longitudinally. Corporate disclosures {{play an important role in}} circumscribing and mediating the corporate social footprint. Accounting as regime of representation presents particular social phenomena at a point in time and this study provides both a comparative (spatial) and longitudinal (temporal) dimension of narrative disclosures around <b>asbestos.</b> Design/Methodology/Approach: This <b>paper</b> draws on narrative disclosures as the segue to financial reporting. Annual reports are prefaced by a considerable discourse consisting of narrative, pictorial and graphical representations. These narrative disclosures serve to frame the accounting information and this study interrogates these disclosures for two companies involved in the manufacture of asbestos products through a period of industrial expansion and decline. Findings: The study challenges the ascription of accounting notions of value and other typical accounting representations as disclosed in narrative reporting. The corporate tale traverses periods of asbestos as profit and success through to the liability and considerable corporate risk. This discursive shift was demonstrated by the re-narration of the corporate story; effectively erasing the grand narrative of asbestos in its transformation from ‘magic mineral’ to ‘killer dust’...|$|R
40|$|Thriving in {{the midst}} of {{financial}} distress? An analysis of firms exposed to asbestos litigation ” (Job Market <b>Paper)</b> <b>Asbestos</b> litigation {{is one of the most}} important mass tort litigations in the history of the United States. I analyze a comprehensive sample of 270 firms that were exposed to an unprecedented wave of asbestos litigation in the wake of U. S. Supreme Court decisions in Amchem (1997) and Ortiz (1999). Due to insurance coverage, most firms in the sample have manageable cash outflows and do not suffer materially from the litigation. Because of the long delay between exposure to asbestos and its related illnesses, the remaining firms with substantial cash outflows and liabilities offer a rare natural experiment to study financial distress unrelated to economic distress. When analyzing this sub-sample throughout the distress period, I find little evidence of indirect costs of financial distress. This surprising result can be directly related to the strategic use of Chapter 11 as it provides a safe harbor through the stay in litigation and the “channeling injunction”, which allows for a definitive solution for the legal liabilities. There is also evidence of a positive role for the disciplinary effects of financial distress as firms subject to increased bank monitoring and increased legal liabilities actively restructure and refocus on core operations. “Omitted variables, simultaneity, and endogeneity: A new approach, ” with Phil Davie...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we aimed to asses whether envorimental {{asbestos}} exposure could have an adjuvant effect in developing scleroderma by counting asbestos bodies (AB) in BAL. Study population was consisted of 17 patients with Scleroderma, 4 patients with Asbestosis and 6 control subjects. BAL was performed by instillation of a total 100 mL saline in five aliquots into right middle lobe, lingula or effected segment of the lung by the disease. The quantification of asbestos bodies was done by filtration of 10 mL fresh BAL fluid, onto millipore filters and counting the numbers of <b>asbestos</b> bodies on <b>paper</b> of milipore filter. BAL fluid cells were counted and differantials were determined in remaining BAL fluid. BAL total cell counts and percentages of lymphocytes in scleroderma {{were significantly higher than}} control subjects but they were not significantly different than patients with asbestosis. The mean BAL asbestos body count was significantly higher in subjects with asbestosis (9. 6 ± 2. 2 AB/mL) than in patients with scleroderma (0. 11 ± 0. 02 AB/mL) and controls (0. 05 ± 0. 02 AB/mL). We could not observe any significant difference between BAL asbestos body counts of patients with scleroderma and controls. We {{come to the conclusion that}} according to BAL asbestos body countings, there was not a difference in asbestos expo-sure between patients with scleroderma and normal population and one can not asses the role of exposure to asbesto...|$|R
40|$|The {{explosion}} and {{collapse of the}} World Trade Center (WTC) was a catastrophic event that produced an aerosol plume impacting many workers, residents, and commuters {{during the first few}} days after 11 September 2001. Three bulk samples of the total settled dust and smoke were collected at weather-protected locations east of the WTC on 16 and 17 September 2001; these samples are representative of the generated material that settled immediately after the {{explosion and}} fire and the concurrent collapse of the two structures. We analyzed each sample, not differentiated by particle size, for inorganic and organic composition. In the inorganic analyses, we identified metals, radionuclides, ionic species, asbestos, and inorganic species. In the organic analyses, we identified polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls, polychlorinated dibenzodioxins, polychlorinated dibenzofurans, pesticides, phthalate esters, brominated diphenyl ethers, and other hydrocarbons. Each sample had a basic pH. Asbestos levels ranged from 0. 8 % to 3. 0 % of the mass, the PAHs were > 0. 1 % of the mass, and lead ranged from 101 to 625 microg/g. The content and distribution of material was indicative of a complex mixture of building debris and combustion products in the resulting plume. These three samples were composed primarily of construction materials, soot, paint (leaded and unleaded), and glass fibers (mineral wool and fiberglass). Levels of hydrocarbons indicated unburned or partially burned jet fuel, plastic, cellulose, and other materials that were ignited by the fire. In morphologic analyses we found {{that a majority of the}} mass was fibrous and composed of many types of fibers (e. g., mineral wool, fiberglass, <b>asbestos,</b> wood, <b>paper,</b> and cotton). The particles were separated into size classifications by gravimetric and aerodynamic methods. Material 53 microm in diameter. The results obtained from these samples can be used to understand the contact and types of exposures to this unprecedented complex mixture experienced by the surviving residents, commuters, and rescue workers directly affected by the plume from 11 to 12 September and the evaluations of any acute or long-term health effects from resuspendable dust and smoke to the residents, commuters, and local workers, as well as from the materials released after 11 September until the fires were extinguished. Further, these results support the need to have the interior of residences, buildings, and their respective HVAC systems professionally cleaned to reduce long-term residential risks before rehabitation...|$|R
