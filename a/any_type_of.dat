5|$|Phaeacius {{does not}} try to eat other spiders' eggs, does not enter webs voluntarily, and moves away if it touches one accidentally. It can bite through the threads and pull {{strongly}} with its legs, but cannot escape from very sticky webs. This behaviour {{is quite different from}} that of its close relative, Portia, which hunts actively and can enter <b>any</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> web to catch spiders and their eggs.|$|E
5|$|The Queen Elizabeth-class {{ships were}} {{designed}} to form a fast squadron for the fleet that was intended to operate against the leading ships of the opposing battleline.

5|$|The other {{military}} expedition moved to Paraguay, commanded by Manuel Belgrano. Following instructions from Moreno, {{he helped the}} natives at the missions in Corrientes, {{on his way to}} Paraguay.

5|$|The ride, though indoors, {{would close}} in <b>any</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> rain. Because of leaks in the structure, water pooled in the trough, warranting a shutdown. Typically, the ride would remain shut down {{after a period}} of rain as the crew would have to cycle several trains through the circuit in order for it to dry. Although the ride was enclosed, the storage track {{remained}} outdoors with a large door that opened when the storage track was needed.|$|E
5|$|Today, the American record {{industry}} defines Latin music as <b>any</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> release with lyrics mostly in Spanish.

5|$|Access and {{movement}} within the protected areas is restricted. In the lake area in particular, no motorized boats are permitted.

Taking samples from the lake is to be kept to the minimum even for scientific studies and also the equipment brought from outside for sampling, {{and it must be}} thoroughly washed to avoid <b>any</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> contamination from outside.

5|$|Although M-n {{outside of}} Michigan could conceivably refer to other state, provincial, local, or {{national}} highways, local usage {{in those areas}} does not mimic the Michigan usage in most cases. In countries like the United Kingdom, M refers to motorways, analogous to freeways in the United States, whereas M-numbered designations in Michigan simply indicate state trunklines in general and may exist on <b>any</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> highway. M-numbered trunklines are designated along a variety of roads, including eight-lane freeways in urban areas, four-lane rural freeways and expressways, principal arterial highways, and two-lane highways in remote rural areas. The system also includes M-185 on Mackinac Island, a non-motorized road restricted to bicycles, horse-drawn carriages and pedestrians.|$|E
5|$|Compounding matters was {{the fact}} that the {{supposedly}} deceased actors had signed contracts with the production which ensured that they would not appear in <b>any</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> media, motion pictures, or commercials for one year following the film's release. This was done in order to promote the idea that Cannibal Holocaust was truly the recovered footage of missing documentarians. During the subsequent court proceedings, questions arose as to why the actors were in no other media if they were alive as Deodato claimed.|$|E

Pictus catfish, plecostomus, {{as well as other}} convicts. Other fast moving fish such as Giant Danios can be used as dither fish. Also remember, if you have a breeding pair Convicts in a 40-gallon or smaller you will be most likely be unable to keep the convicts with any tank mates. But if your tank mates have established <b>any</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> dominance they will however breed and live together.|$|E

5|$|In October the {{dry season}} sets in across much of Florida (starting early in the month in {{northern}} Florida and {{near the end of}} the month in deep southern Florida) and lasts until late April in most years. Fronts from mid-latitude storms north of Florida occasionally pass through northern and central parts of the state which bring light and brief winter rainfall. Mid and late winter can become severely dry in Florida. In some years {{the dry season}} becomes quite severe and water restrictions are imposed to conserve water. While most areas of Florida do not experience <b>any</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> frozen precipitation, north Florida can see fleeting snow or sleet a few times each decade.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} the coup, Taraki and other party leaders initiated other radical Marxist policies that challenged both traditional Afghan values and well-established traditional power structures in rural areas. Taraki introduced women to political life and legislated an end to forced marriage. However, he ruled over a nation with a deep Islamic religious culture and {{a long history of}} resistance to <b>any</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> strong centralized governmental control, and consequently many of these reforms were not actually implemented nationwide. Popular resentment of Taraki's drastic policy changes triggered surging unrest throughout the country, reducing government control to only a limited area. The strength of this anti-reform backlash would ultimately lead to the Afghan civil war.|$|E
5|$|Many welding {{processes}} {{require the use}} of a particular joint design; for example, resistance spot welding, laser beam welding, and electron beam welding are most frequently performed on lap joints. Other welding methods, like shielded metal arc welding, are extremely versatile and can weld virtually <b>any</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> joint. Some processes {{can also be used to}} make multipass welds, in which one weld is allowed to cool, and then another weld is performed on top of it. This allows for the welding of thick sections arranged in a single-V preparation joint, for example.|$|E

The USAF did not reveal whether any other officer involved in the chain of events leading to the crash received <b>any</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> administrative or disciplinary action.

5|$|PHP code may be {{embedded}} into HTML or HTML5 markup, {{or it can}} be used {{in combination}} with various web template systems, web content management systems and web frameworks. PHP code is usually processed by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module in the web server or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. The web server software combines the results of the interpreted and executed PHP code, which may be <b>any</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> data, including images, with the generated web page. PHP code may also be executed with a command-line interface (CLI) and can be used to implement standalone graphical applications.|$|E
5|$|Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney was {{developed}} {{by a team of}} seven people, and took ten months to make. It was directed by Shu Takumi and produced by Atsushi Inaba, with music by Masakazu Sugimori, character design by Kumiko Suekane, and art by Tatsuro Iwamoto. In 2000, after Takumi had finished his work on Dino Crisis 2, his boss at the time, Shinji Mikami, gave him six months to create <b>any</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> game he wanted to.

5|$|Sedna {{will come}} to {{perihelion}} around 2075–2076. This close approach to the Sun {{provides an opportunity for}} study that will not occur again for 12,000 years. Although Sedna is listed on NASA's Solar System exploration website, NASA is not known to be considering <b>any</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> mission at this time. It was calculated that a flyby mission to Sedna could take 24.48 years using a Jupiter gravity assist, based on launch dates of 6 May 2033 and 23 June 2046.

5|$|The Civilian Public Service (CPS) was {{a program}} of the United States {{government}} that provided conscientious objectors with an alternative to military service during World War II.
