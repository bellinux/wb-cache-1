5|$|According to Kurt Aland it <b>agrees</b> <b>with</b> the Byzantine text-type 87 {{times in}} the Gospels, 13 {{times in the}} Acts, 29 times in Paul, and 16 times in the Catholic epistles. It <b>agrees</b> <b>with</b> the Nestle-Aland text 66 times (Gospels), 38 (Acts), 104 (Paul), and 41 (Cath.). It has 50 {{independent}} or distinctive readings in the Gospels, 11 in Acts, 17 in Paul, and 14 in the Catholic epistles. Aland placed {{the text of the}} codex in Category II. According to the Claremont Profile Method its text is mixed in Luke 1, Luke 10, and Luke 20.|$|E

5|$|Algebraic K-theory {{is related}} to the group of {{invertible}} matrices with coefficients the given field. For example, the process of taking the determinant of an invertible matrix leads to an isomorphism K1(F) = F. Matsumoto's theorem shows that K2(F) <b>agrees</b> <b>with</b> K2M(F). In higher degrees, K-theory diverges from Milnor K-theory and remains hard to compute in general.|$|E

5|$|Besides {{the other}} {{corrections}} by later hands {{there are not}} a few instances in which the original scribe altered what he had first written. The corrected form of text often <b>agrees</b> <b>with</b> codices: D, N, X, Y, Γ, Θ, Π, Φ and majority of the minuscule manuscripts.|$|E
5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the IAU definition of dwarf planet, some scientists expressed their disagreement with the IAU resolution. Campaigns included car bumper stickers and T-shirts.

5|$|Pausanias' account <b>agrees</b> <b>with</b> that of Herodotus (whom he {{probably}} read) {{except that he}} gives the number of Locrians, which Herodotus declined to estimate. Residing in the direct path of the Persian advance, they gave all the fighting men they had - according to Pausanias 6,000 men - which added to Herodotus' 5,200 would have given a force of 11,200.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with his}} {{scientific}} fame, Newton's {{studies of the}} Bible and of the early Church Fathers were also noteworthy. Newton wrote works on textual criticism, most notably An Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture and Observations upon the Prophecies of Daniel, and the Apocalypse of St. John. He placed the crucifixion of Jesus Christ at 3 April, AD 33, which <b>agrees</b> <b>with</b> one traditionally accepted date.|$|E
5|$|David Kinsley, {{an expert}} on Hindu goddesses and former Professor of Religion at McMaster University, <b>agrees</b> <b>with</b> the Buddhist origin theory, but sees other influences, too. Ancient Hindu goddesses, who are {{depicted}} nude and headless or faceless, may have also influenced the development of Chhinnamasta. These goddesses are mainly depicted headless {{to focus on the}} display of their sexual organs, thus signifying sexual vigour, but they do not explain the self-decapitation theme.|$|E

The Fm2+/Fm0 couple has an electrode potential of −2.37(10)V based on polarographic measurements.|$|E
5|$|Ilokelesia was {{originally}} {{described as a}} sister group to Abelisauroidea. However, Sereno tentatively places it closer to Abelisaurus than to noasaurids, a result which <b>agrees</b> <b>with</b> several other recent analyses. If a stem-based definition is used, Ilokelesia and Rugops are therefore basal abelisaurids. However, as they are more basal than Abelisaurus, they are outside of Abelisauridae if the node-based definition is adopted. Ekrixinatosaurus was also published in 2004, {{so it was not}} included in Sereno's analysis. However, an independent analysis, performed by Jorge Calvo and colleagues, shows it to be an abelisaurid.|$|E
5|$|In 1959, Thompson was {{inducted}} into the Hockey Hall of Fame. He died in Calgary on February 9, 1981. The article was published on Thursday, February 12, 1981, with a dateline of February 11; the article reports his death as having occurred on Monday, making it February 9, which <b>agrees</b> <b>with</b> the Hockey Hall of Fame. He was survived by his wife, Edith, and his daughter, Sandra.|$|E

5|$|Kagan {{believes}} that while Alcibiades was a commander of considerable ability, {{he was no}} military genius, and his confidence and ambitions went far beyond his skills. He thus was capable of important errors and serious miscalculations. Kagan argues that at Notium, Alcibiades committed a serious error in leaving the fleet {{in the hands of}} an inexperienced officer, and that most of the credit for the brilliant victory at Cyzicus must be assigned to Thrasybulus. In this judgement, Kagan <b>agrees</b> <b>with</b> Cornelius Nepos, who said that the Athenians' extravagant opinion of Alcibiades's abilities and valor was his chief misfortune.|$|E
5|$|Next Stace {{explains}} {{that there are}} two orders of being: time (or the world) and eternity (or God), and these intersect in the moment of mystic illumination. He maintains these orders are distinct, so one order cannot dictate to the other. Here he says that he <b>agrees</b> <b>with</b> Kant, who made a distinction between the world of phenomena and the noumenon, although he is critical of Kant’s disregard for mystical experience.|$|E
5|$|One {{measure of}} an instrument's {{usefulness}} {{is to see}} how closely it <b>agrees</b> <b>with</b> another similar instrument that has been validated against information from a clinical interview by a trained clinician. In this respect, the BDI-II is positively correlated with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale with a Pearson r of 0.71, showing good agreement. The test was also shown {{to have a high}} one-week test–retest reliability (Pearson r =0.93), suggesting that it was not overly sensitive to daily variations in mood. The test also has high internal consistency (α=.91).|$|E

5|$|The Greek text of {{the codex}} is a {{representative}} of the Caesarean text-type. It belongs to the textual family f13, known also as Ferrar Family. Also the handwriting and the menology show that is a close member of the group. According to Kurt and Barbara Aland it <b>agrees</b> <b>with</b> the Byzantine standard text 151 times, and 72 times with the Byzantine when it has the same reading as the original text. It agrees 31 times with the original text against the Byzantine. It has 57 independent or distinctive readings. Alands placed it in Category III.|$|E
5|$|Another {{reason that}} was put forward by Jayakumar to justify a limited role by the {{judiciary}} was that the judicial process is unsuitable for deciding preventive detention issues. Persons who are potential threats to national security may act covertly, hindering the collection of evidence to secure a conviction in a court trial. By its nature, however, preventive detention is a precautionary measure and involves making decisions on limited information to prevent threats to national security from materializing. Jayakumar said that the court is ill-equipped {{to determine whether there}} are suspicious circumstances which justify pre-emptive action. Tham <b>agrees</b> <b>with</b> this view, but argues that it applies only where the courts review the exercise of executive power. He distinguishes the objective test applied in Chng Suan Tze from the situation mentioned by Jayakumar, since the court is only interested in whether there is a national security issue involved.|$|E
5|$|Bart and Milhouse torment {{a tourist}} named Howell Huser (a parody of {{television}} personality Huell Howser), who is then chased {{out of town}} by bullies Dolph, Jimbo, and Kearney. Huser is later revealed to be a media personality, and he appears on a network's morning television show warning tourists against visiting Springfield and giving it his lowest rating for any American location (six out of ten). The Springfield tourism business collapses and Mayor Quimby holds an emergency meeting at the town hall. After many senseless suggestions, Lisa suggests that Springfield legalize same-sex marriage to entice visitors to their town. All of Springfield happily <b>agrees</b> <b>with</b> Lisa's idea, even Marge. The town makes a commercial that is broadcast throughout America, convincing {{people to come to}} Springfield.|$|E
