5|$|A year later, Catherine was {{banished from}} court, and her rooms {{were given to}} Anne. Anne was an unusually educated <b>and</b> <b>intellectual</b> woman for her time, and was keenly absorbed and engaged {{with the ideas of}} the Protestant Reformers, though the extent to which she herself was a {{committed}} Protestant is much debated. When Archbishop of Canterbury William Warham died, Anne's influence and the need to find a trustworthy supporter of the annulment had Thomas Cranmer appointed to the vacant position. This was approved by the Pope, unaware of the King's nascent plans for the Church.|$|E
30|$|This {{research}} helps articulate {{some of the}} multilayered {{issues that}} may affect an adequate implementation of Guaraní-Spanish bilingual education: 1) ideological and attitudinal gaps towards Guaraní and Spanish that may fragment Paraguay’s language policy between the policy level (i.e., policy makers <b>and</b> <b>intellectuals)</b> <b>and</b> the operational level (i.e., parents and teachers); 2) insufficient and inadequate bilingual teacher training; and 3) different interpretations and uses of pure Guaraní and Jopará between policy makers <b>and</b> <b>intellectuals,</b> <b>and</b> the subsequent issue of standardizing Jopará.|$|R

5|$|Hypothyroidism, {{also called}} underactive thyroid or low thyroid, {{is a common}} {{disorder}} of the endocrine {{system in which the}} thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone.

Occasionally there may be swelling of the front part of the neck due to goitre. Untreated hypothyroidism during pregnancy can lead to delays in growth <b>and</b> <b>intellectual</b> development in the baby, which is called cretinism.|$|E
5|$|In January 1897, McKinley offered Sherman the Secretary of State position, which Sherman, {{facing a}} {{difficult}} reelection campaign in 1898, quickly accepted.

The appointment {{was seen as}} a good one, but many in Washington soon began to question whether Sherman, at age 73, still had the strength <b>and</b> <b>intellectual</b> vigor to handle the job; rumors circulated to that effect, but McKinley did not believe them. Asked for advice on the inaugural address, Sherman offered a draft threatening intervention in Cuba, then in rebellion against Spain; the suggestion was ignored.|$|E

30|$|Beyond the {{operational}} level, {{an issue that}} disturbs the policy transmission between policy makers <b>and</b> <b>intellectuals</b> involves the different interpretations and uses of Jopará, which has been little discussed in previous studies. Both policy makers <b>and</b> <b>intellectuals</b> understand the advantage of Jopará or Spanish loan words and agree upon the use of Jopará as the language of instruction while denying the use or even the present day existence of pure Guaraní, {{but they seem to}} understand the term Jopará differently, including negative interpretations of the term. Galeano’s criticism of the use of Jopará in the Ministry’s textbook is a prime example. This discrepancy in opinion between policy makers <b>and</b> <b>intellectuals</b> may cause confusion and disrupt its implementation. It is thus encouraged to engage policy makers <b>and</b> <b>intellectuals</b> in policy dialogue so that they can agree upon the standardization of Jopará and a language-of-instruction-policy for an adequate implementation of Guaraní-Spanish bilingual education.|$|R

5|$|Marx's {{ideas have}} had a {{profound}} impact on world politics <b>and</b> <b>intellectual</b> thought. Followers of Marx have frequently debated amongst themselves over how to interpret Marx's writings and apply his concepts to the modern world. The legacy of Marx's thought has become contested between numerous tendencies, each of which sees itself as Marx's most accurate interpreter. In the political realm, these tendencies include Leninism, Marxism–Leninism, Trotskyism, Maoism, Luxemburgism and libertarian Marxism. Various currents have also developed in academic Marxism, often under influence of other views, resulting in structuralist Marxism, historical Marxism, phenomenological Marxism, analytical Marxism and Hegelian Marxism.|$|E
