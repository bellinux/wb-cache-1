5000|$|To humans, {{these birds}} are quite beneficial. For one thing, in {{particular}} the young devour many pest insects during the breeding season. For another, the plumage and song of the breeding males {{have been described as}} [...] "lovely" [...] and [...] "musical", and they can help to generate revenue from ecotourism. No significant negative effects of <b>American</b> yellow and <b>mangrove</b> warblers on humans have been recorded.|$|R

40|$|An {{assessment}} {{was made of}} American Samoa mangroves' vulnerability and predicted changes in position from sea-level rise. The study also evaluated capacity in the Pacific Islands region to assess mangrove vulnerability to climate change and institute adaptation measures. Of the outcomes from climate change, relative sea-level rise may be {{the greatest threat to}} mangroves. By 2100, mangrove losses from relative sea-level rise could be as high as 47 percent in American Samoa and 22 percent when extrapolating regionally, causing about a quarter of total predicted annual regional losses. <b>American</b> Samoa <b>mangrove</b> vulnerability to sea-level rise was determined and future position was predicted through analyses of sea-level trends and projections, mangrove spatial change analysis, reconstruction and monitoring of sedimentation rates, and determination of potential migration areas. These analyses provided three categories of requisite information: (i) Observed and projected rate of change in sea-level relative to the mangrove sediment surface, determined from trends in relative sea-level through analysis of sea-level data from a local tide gauge and observations of trends in the elevation of mangrove sediment surfaces; (ii) observed and projected trends in mangrove seaward margin positions; and (iii) physiographic settings (slope of land upslope and location of obstacles along the landward margin). Results indicate that <b>American</b> Samoa <b>mangroves</b> are not likely keeping pace with rising sea-level, both surface and subsurface process controls on sediment elevation are important factors, and a large proportion (16, 23 and 68 percent) of the landward margins of the three mangrove study sites are obstructed from natural landward migration with sea-level rise. Based on observed trends in sediment surface elevations and movement of two mangroves' seaward margins, these sites have likely not been keeping pace with relative sea-level rise, with an elevation deficit of about 2 mm eat both sites. An embayment mangrove experienced sea-level rise relative to the mangrove sediment surface of 2. 22 (± 2. 22 95...|$|R
40|$|We {{predict the}} decadal change in {{position}} of three <b>American</b> Samoa <b>mangroves</b> from {{analysis of a}} time series of remotely sensed imagery, a geographic information system, tide gauge data, and projections for change in sea-level relative to the mangrove surface. Accurate predictions of changes to coastal ecosystem boundaries, including in response to projected relative sea-level rise, enable advanced planning to minimize and offset anticipated losses and minimize social disruption and cost of reducing threats to coastal development and human safety. The observed mean landward migration of three mangroves’ seaward margins over four decades was 25, 64, and 72 mma− 1, 12 to 37 times the observed relative sea-level rise rate. Two of the sites had clear trends in reductions in mangrove area, {{where there was a}} highly significant correlation between the change in position of the seaward mangrove margin and change in relative sea-level. Here it can be inferred that the force of sea-level rise relative to the mangrove surface is causing landward migration. Shoreline movement was variable at a third site and not significantly correlated with changing sealevel, where it is likely that forces other than change in relative sea-level are predominant. Currently, 16. 5...|$|R
40|$|Rates {{of change}} in {{elevation}} of mangrove surfaces, determined from observations {{of changes in the}} height above the mangrove surface of stakes, generally inserted through the organic peat layer to reach consolidated substrate, were measured in one fringe and one basin mangrove wetland on Tutuila Island, American Samoa. Knowledge of trends in elevation change of coastal wetlands contributes to assessing vulnerability to projected relative sea level rise. The fringe and basin mangroves had rates {{of change in}} elevation of 0. 6 mm yr 1 (± 2. 0) and 2. 2 mm yr- 1 (± 5. 6), where a negative result means lowering in elevation. These trends were not statistically significant (P > 0. 05) and the error intervals around the point estimates of trends in change in elevation overlap zero for both study sites, meaning that it is not clear if the mangrove surfaces have been lowering, rising or not changing. Despite the large error intervals, likely due to short-term variability and cyclical patterns in sedimentation, results indicate that the fringe mangrove has been experiencing a rise in sea level relative to the mangrove surface as the relative sea level rise rate (+ 1. 65 to + 2. 29 mm yr 1) has been exceeding the rate of change in elevation of the mangrove surface (2. 6 to + 1. 4 mm yr 1). It is unclear if the basin mangrove has been experiencing a rise in sea level relative to the mangrove surface. If upper projections for accelerated relative sea level rise in American Samoa occur over coming decades, <b>American</b> Samoa <b>mangroves</b> will migrate landward, where unobstructed, as a natural response to relative sea level rise...|$|R
50|$|The <b>American</b> {{yellow and}} <b>mangrove</b> (including golden) warblers differ {{in some other}} {{reproductive}} parameters. While the former is somewhat more of an r-strategist, the actual differences are complex and adapted to different environmental conditions. The yellow warbler starts breeding in May/June, while the mangrove warbler can be found breeding all year round. American yellow warblers {{have been known to}} raise a brood of young in as little as 45 days, but usually take about 75 days. The tropical populations, by contrast, need more than 100 days per breeding. Males court the females with songs; an American yellow warbler has been observed to sing more than 3,200 songs in one day. They are, like most songbirds, generally serially monogamous; some 10% of mangrove warbler and about half as many American yellow marbler males are bigamous. Very few if any American yellow warblers breed more than once per year; around one in twenty mangrove warbler females will do so however. If a breeding attempt fails, either will usually try and raise a second brood successfully though.|$|R
40|$|In the Pacific islands {{the total}} {{mangrove}} area is about 343, 735 ha, with largest areas in Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Fiji and New Caledonia. A total of 34 species of mangroves occur, {{as well as}} 3 hybrids. These are of the Indo-Malayan assemblage (with one exception), and decline in diversity from west to east across the Pacific, reaching a limit at <b>American</b> Samoa. <b>Mangrove</b> resources are traditionally exploited in the Pacific islands, for construction and fuel wood, herbal medicines, and the gathering of crabs and fish. There are two main environmental settings for mangroves in the Pacific, deltaic and estuarine mangroves of high islands, and embayment, lagoon and reef flat mangroves of low islands. It is indicated from past analogues that their close relationship with sea-level height renders these mangrove swamps particularly vulnerable to disruption by sea-level rise. Stratigraphic records of Pacific island mangrove ecosystems during sea-level changes of the Holocene Period demonstrate that low islands mangroves {{can keep up with}} a sea-level rise of up to 12 cm per 100 years. Mangroves of high islands can keep up with rates of sea-level rates of up to 45 cm per 100 years, according to the supply of fluvial sediment. When the rate of sea-level rise exceeds the rate of accretion, mangroves experience problems of substrate erosion, inundation stress and increased salinity. Rise in temperature and the direct effects of increased CO 2 levels are likely to increase mangrove productivity, change phenological patterns (such as the timing of flowering and fruiting), and expand the ranges of mangroves into higher latitudes. Pacific island mangroves are expected to demonstrate a sensitive response to the predicted rise in sea-level. A regional monitoring system is needed to provide data on ecosystem changes in productivity, species composition and sedimentation. This has been the intention of a number of programs, but none has yet been implemented...|$|R
