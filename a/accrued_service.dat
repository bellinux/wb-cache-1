40|$|Recent {{public policy}} {{approaches}} aimed at halting or reversing environmental decline have embraced market-based instruments (MBIs) including payments for environmental services (PES). A particular advantage of MBIs is cost efficiency as they exploit heterogeneity of opportunity costs of supply among competing providers of environmental services. PES schemes offer {{financial incentives to}} land owners and managers to engage in specified environmental maintenance and restoration activities. Such activities support natural capital and ecosystem services, which, in turn, generate human wellbeing. As this paper demonstrates PES schemes can also generate social co-benefits, which add to the total wellbeing gain achieved. This paper differentiates and illustrates – with particular reference to PES schemes involving Aboriginal people in northern Australia – three types of social co-benefits: ‘type A’ benefits <b>accrue</b> to the <b>service</b> provider {{as a direct result}} of the remuneration received, ‘type B’ benefits <b>accrue</b> to the <b>service</b> provider in the process of undertaking the service and are unrelated to remuneration, and ‘type C’ benefits represent the broader flow-on effects associated with types A and B benefits.

40|$|Under some {{defined benefit}} pension plans (typically foreign plans), the actuarial {{present value of}} {{benefits}} to which an employee is entitled if the employee terminates immediately may exceed the actuarial present value of benefits to which the employee is entitled at expected date of separation based on service to date. For example, {{the provisions of the}} Italian severance pay statute require that, in most cases, the benefit an employee has <b>accrued</b> for <b>service</b> to date is payable immediately upon separation. The undiscounted value of that benefit payable currently would exceed the actuarial present value of that benefit if payment is estimated to occur at the employee's expected termination date. Another example arises in the United Kingdom where legislation requires that deferred vested benefits of terminated employees be statutorily revalued from date of separation to normal retirement age. If the vested benefit obligation (VBO) is determined assuming employee termination at the measurement date, that VBO could exceed the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) if that obligation is measured giving consideration to a statutory revaluation only after the employee's expected date of termination. The issue is whether the VBO is the actuarial present value of the vested benefits to which the employee is entitled if the employee separates immediately (Approach 1) or the actuarial present value of the vested benefits to which the employee is currently entitled but based on the employee's expected date of separation or retirement (Approach 2).

40|$|The {{market growth}} of content and data {{services}} in the mobile telecoms industry entails the development of complex industry networks or 'ecosystems'. This research stems from the emerging Location-Based Services (LBS) sector, which has suffered the slow-start dynamics that often belie optimistic forecasts of new technologies. An exploratory and generic industry-level model is developed using the system dynamics simulation modelling approach to explain the start-up problem. This serves as a dynamic theory for the emerging LBS industry market where service diffusion {{is based on the}} growth of the installed base of an embedded product. Supply-demand interactions occur through complementary bandwagon effects in which benefits <b>accrue</b> from <b>services</b> that complement the main product. Econometric estimation is compared with system dynamics calibration to test a range of diffusion models on historic data, revealing some evidence of bandwagon effects. The model is proposed as a generic structure for market growth in mobile data services in general and as a tentative theory to explain the phenomenon of technology 'hype' cycles. The model leads to broad policy proposals on how to alleviate the start-up problem. Launching products without attending to service quality can mean that consumers become disillusioned whereas ensuring a high quality user experience requires a collaborative and long-term view of ecosystem development. This implies that major players such as handset manufacturers or mobile operators must play a central co-ordinating role. Validation of exploratory models of emerging markets is based more in terms of plausibility and usefulness, given the lack of historic data. A validation framework in the three dimensions of model content, process and outcome provides a holistic and semi-quantitative profile of the utility of generic models. A validation profile is proposed {{that can be used in}} a formative role to clarify model purpose and aid planning in model-based interventions...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} argued that the {{production}} of sufficient nectar to attract bird pollinators would evolve if the fitness benefits <b>accruing</b> from pollination <b>services</b> by birds, compared with insects, outweighed the cost of increased allocation of photosynthate to nectar. This hypothesis implies that the pollination services provided by birds must be considerably better than those provided by insects with which the plant has evolved. Consistent with this, we found that the endangered native swift parrot Lathamus discolor (Shaw) was a very effective pollinator of the native tree Eucalyptus globulus Labill. in Tasmania, facilitating an average of 76 % of the maximum possible seed set for open-pollinated flowers in just one visit to a flower, whereas single flower visits by native insects did not facilitate any seed production. Flowers visited once by either species of introduced social bees, the honeybee Apis mellifera L. or the bumblebee Bombus terrestris (L.), produced less than 7 % of the maximum possible seed set for open-pollinated flowers. Hence, easily managed social bees appear to be poor substitutes for bird pollinators in commercial seed orchards of this tree. We propose three possible reasons why this largely bird-pollinated tree has not evolved characters that deter insects from removing nectar...|$|R

40|$|In {{the context}} of the {{information}} society, to be able to communicate and interact is a crucial and decisive factor for every citizen and business. New interactive services should be accessible to every citizen in a country, so that the benefits of new technologies and <b>services</b> <b>accrue</b> in all areas. This should in turn benefit the overall economic efficiency of society. The adoption of a liberalization policy does not automatically bring such benefits to all regions of a country, partly because the existing levels of infrastructure and services are significantly lower in some areas, and partly because of educational and institutional barriers to the use of new ICTs. Since the broadband divide becomes an issue for the information society, many policies have been initiated to bridge this divide. Widening the scope of universal service policy to cover broadband access is one policy option. However, moving broadband into such a direction needs to be carefully examined.

While historians have examined the effects of the Civil War and Emancipation on African Americans in the South in detail, few have explored the effects of such events on African Americans in the Upper Midwest. Also lacking in this historiography is how the military service of African Americans affected the lives of these veterans and the communities in the Upper Midwest they helped to form after the Civil War. Using the black community of Newton, Iowa after the Civil War as a case study, this thesis argues that African American veterans who settled in the Upper Midwest used the political capital of their service, kinship ties, and other social institutions to forge and maintain space for African American communities. African American Civil War veterans and other black citizens continued for decades after the war to remind their white neighbors of their earned space in the community. They viewed their emancipation and citizenship as rewards for their military service and loyalty to the nation and struggled to obtain the full rights of citizenship still denied them.

40|$|Since {{the late}} 1960 s, the {{valuation}} of ecosystem services has received ample attention in scientific literature. However, to date, {{there has been}} relatively little elaboration of the various spatial and temporal scales at which ecosystem services are supplied. This paper analyzes the spatial scales of ecosystem services, and it examines how stakeholders at different spatial scales attach different values to ecosystem services. The paper first establishes an enhanced framework for the valuation of ecosystem services, with specific attention for stakeholders. The framework includes a procedure to assess the value of regulation services that avoids double counting of these services. Subsequently, the paper analyses the spatial scales of ecosystem services: the ecological scales at which ecosystem services are generated, and the institutional scales at which stakeholders benefit from ecosystem services. On {{the basis of the}} proposed valuation framework, we value four selected ecosystem services supplied by the De Wieden wetlands in The Netherlands, and we analyze how these <b>services</b> <b>accrue</b> to stakeholders at different institutional scales. These services are the provision of reed for cutting, the provision of fish, recreation, and nature conservation. In the De Wieden wetland, reed cutting and fisheries are only important at the municipal scale, recreation is most relevant at the municipal and provincial scale, and nature conservation is important in particular at the national and international level. Our analysis shows that stakeholders at different spatial scales can have very different interests in ecosystem services, and we argue that it is highly important to consider the scales of ecosystem services when valuation of services is applied to support the formulation or implementation of ecosystem management plan...|$|R
40|$|Private forest landowners own {{nearly half}} of U. S. forestlands, {{providing}} a number of benefits to the American public: a refuge for biological diversity, watershed values, renewable timber production, carbon storage, recreation, and enjoyment. The private forestland base also faces a number of threats including development, parcelization, invasive species encroachment, damaging harvesting practices, and climate change. Decision making by private forest landowners has been a topic of keen interest {{for over a century}} as forestry practitioners have struggled to engage forest landowners. Recent studies show very few U. S. private forest landowners have a written management plan. Mail survey (n= 532), interview (n= 53), and participant observation methodologies were used in southern and central Illinois to assess private forest landowner engagement with forestry. First, logistic regression analysis of survey data was used to assess forest management actions of southern Illinois private forest landowners {{in the context of the}} contentious dialogue about the management of the Shawnee National Forest. Second, quantitative survey data about southern Illinois landowners??? climate change perceptions were compared with qualitative interview responses about the array of ecosystem <b>services</b> <b>accruing</b> from their forestlands. Finally, an examination of applied techniques to meet current forestry challenges was facilitated through a partnership with the Illinois Department of Natural Resources in central Illinois. Results indicate amenities and cultural ecosystem services - aesthetic, spiritual, recreational, and heritage values - are highly enjoyed among most private forest landowners and integral to their decision making. Many landowners perceive that cultural ecosystem services are compromised by active management for timber production, ecosystem restoration, climate change mitigation, or other outcomes. Findings suggest that synergistic management strategies merging the enjoyment of cultural ecosystem services with the production of other ecosystem services will effectively engage private forest landowners.

40|$|This {{paper has}} been {{prepared}} under the guidelines {{provided by the}} TAP Secretariat at the FAO, as {{a contribution to the}} TAP, an initiative of the G. 20, which includes near 40 partners, facilitated by the FAO. Its purpose is to provide a Regional synthesis report on capacity needs assessment for agricultural innovation, with capacity gaps identified and analyzed, including recommendations to strengthen agricultural innovation systems (AIS) and draft policy recommendations to address the capacity gaps. This study is part of the TAP Initiative and is targeted at Central America and selected countries in Africa and Asia. This report was guided by the consideration that Innovations in agriculture are recognized as such when they are already used to some extent by producers. The stages preceding the use of innovations may include formal research or farmers’ experimentation. Innovations in agriculture include technological and managerial alternatives. Institutional capacity is understood in its broader sense as referring to a system which includes: legislation and rules of the game, which must be understood and fulfilled by all actors; policies, which, when properly implemented, provide guidelines for private actors’ decisions and investments; organizations (public and private) which have adequate capacity (see below); mechanisms that facilitate interaction and partnerships among actors (platforms, networks, etc.) and ad hoc financial mechanisms (venture capital, competitive funds, etc.) to facilitate private investment. Capacity of an organization is referred as the capacity to perform properly in a system. It requires amongst other things, qualified, motivated and well paid staff; efficient internal procedures; equipment; physical facilities; information systems that allow fulfillment of tasks; sufficient and timely funding; proactive attitude; and positive image. Therefore, improving the capacity of an organization requires investment and not just in training personnel. The rationale for building capacity of innovation systems and participating organizations is most justified {{in the context of the}} need to assure the benefits of markets of technological and managerial goods and <b>services</b> <b>accrue</b> to all actors in agriculture.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{analyzes the}} economic value of improvements resulting from stream restoration within the Chesapeake Bay watershed and reviews {{what is known}} about the economic value of the services provided by restoration and the environmental improvements of stream restoration. Although there is uncertainty about the level of improved services restoration provides studies from the different disciplines help to inform the economic analysis that follows by providing evidence on the types of improvements to the services that are expected from a restoration. To assess the economic benefits of restoring streams requires an analysis of how humans value the services from streams. Some of these <b>services</b> <b>accrue</b> to individuals, who might even pay for them directly. Such services might include, for example, erosion and flood control, and their value can be determined using market data or information from private sector projects. However, many of the benefits of stream restoration are public in nature, such as improvements in water or habitat quality in locations downstream from where restoration occurs. These benefits may be substantial and are likely to be external to any market transaction. This study uses contingent valuation (CV) to measure the value of the following environmental services that may follow from stream restoration; improved water quality, habitat improvement, greater habitat diversity, more erosion and flood control, and overall health of the Chesapeake Bay. Results from the analysis of the CV survey suggest that the annual willingness to pay (WTP) for stream restoration projects within Maryland that improves degraded streams to moderately healthy ranges from $ 0 to $ 114. When extrapolated to the population of the Greater Baltimore Region the total WTP is $ 0 to $ 118. 5 for a moderate stream restoration improvement. Additionally, by using pictures to evaluate the aesthetic preferences of individuals, respondents prefer streams that have open banks with limited riparian vegetation, and streams without erosion.

Despite its increased popularity, ensuring security and availability of data, resources and services remains an ongoing research challenge. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are not a new threat but they remain a major security challenge in achieving a secure and guaranteed service and resources in cloud computing. Mitigating DDoS attack in cloud computing presents {{a new dimension to}} the solutions proffered in traditional computing, therefore, this work proposes DDoS defence solutions that identify and classify packet traffic as either legitimate or malicious, based on its attributes. This thesis has three objectives. Firstly, it investigates a major attribute of DDoS attack, the spoofing of source IP address that hides its identity to disallow easy traceback or deceive the cloud provider to enjoy certain <b>services</b> <b>accrued</b> to a trusted host. Secondly, due to the increased number and sophistication of DDoS attacks against cloud services and the magnitude of traffic that needs to be processed, the analysis of feature selection methods and classification techniques was carried out. Feature selection has been identified as a pre-processing phase in cloud DDoS attack defence that could potentially increase the classification accuracy and reduce the computational complexity, by identifying important features from the original dataset, during supervised learning. Finally, this thesis studies the packet inter-arrival time (IAT) feature of traffic traces, {{in order to determine the}} presence of an attack using a change-point detection. The DDoS attack pattern is detected by leveraging on the fact that most DDoS attacks are automated, thus exhibiting similar patterns. The main contributions are as follows: (i) This thesis proposes an IP spoofing detection technique that uses a passive and active host-based operating system (OS) fingerprinting to detect the true source of a packet during a spoofed DDoS attack; (ii) this thesis proposes an ensemble-based multi-filter feature selection (EMFFS) method that combines the output of four filter methods to achieve an optimum selection, and a decision-tree classifier to detect DDoS attacks; and (iii) this thesis proposes a change-point monitoring algorithm to detect DDoS flooding attacks against cloud services, by examining the packet IAT. A DDoS attack pattern is distinguished from normal traffic by using cumulative sum algorithm (CUSUM). The results obtained show a high detection rate and classification accuracy, when compared with other classification techniques in the literature...|$|R
40|$|The vast {{majority}} of the world's M&A activities are represented by takeovers ofprivately held targets. Yet, this sector of the market for corporate control has received very little attention from academic researchers. This thesis thus sets out to provide a comparative analysis, both theoretically and empirically, of gains to bidders of private targets in relation to gains to bidders of public targets. When targets are privately held as opposed to publicly held or listed, there are reasons to believe that bidders gamer material gains even with full competition. By recognising the possibility that the decision of the owners of a private target to agree to a takeover (i) represents the exit strategy or (ii) is reflective of the passage of the firm through its life cycle, this thesis provides a new perspective on the wealth consequences of private-firm takeovers on bidder shareholders. The empirical analyses in this thesis reveal that not only bidder gains, but also bidder characteristics, distinctly differ between private-firm takeovers and takeovers of public targets or divested subsidiaries. This thesis also provides evidence on the largely unexplored determinants of the choice of payment methods in private-firm takeovers. In several important aspects, the findings contribute to the extant evidence on determinants of payment methods in takeovers of public targets. Considering the costs known {{to be associated with the}} decision to go public facing the owners of a privately held company, acquisition by a listed bidder is potentially a costeffective means by which the firm owners can exit or the firm can gain access to funds necessary for financing the unexploited investment opportunities. The common knowledge of the cost savings arising from choosing the takeover route implies that a portion of these savings is also available to be garnered by bidders of private targets. On the other hand, these savings are either trivial or absent when targets already have access to the capital market (i. e., public targets and divested subsidiaries). Given that the bidder is willing to pay the acquisition price that fully reflects its valuation of its target, there is hence no guarantee that the bidder earns positive gains when acquiring a public target whereas the exit costs savings provide a source of ex ante gains to the bidder if it opts for a private target. Around the bid announcement, bidders of private targets are found to earn positive gains. In contrast, when taking into account the event windows leading up to the announcement date, evidence emerges that public-firm bidders experience losses and bidders of divested subsidiaries overall fare no better than breaking-even around the bid announcement. Also at variance with the experience of public-firm takeovers, this thesis documents that announcement-period gains to bidders of private targets are positive irrespective of the payment method and that equity financing in private-firm takeovers leads to larger bidder gains. This positive announcement-period effect of equity financing appears attributable to the positive information about the bidder's prospects rather than the expected performance monitoring by the target owners. Given the considerably small size and closely held ownership of private targets, which are in contrast with public targets and divested subsidiaries, bidders of private targets are unlikely to be motivated by the empire-building objectives. Instead, the characteristics of private targets imply that their bidders maximise the realisation of expected synergies rather than personal utility for the bidder managers. The closely held ownership and small size of private targets also imply that they are much easier to integratethan public targets or divested subsidiaries. The analysis of long-term bidder abnormalreturn reveals that while private-firm bidders breakeven during the post-acquisition period, 11 there is evidence that public-finn bidders, and particularly bidders of divested subsidiaries, experience losses. The difference in ownership structure between private targets and public targets also leads to the difference in the change in ownership concentration in the bidders. While equity financing leads to a ceteris paribus increase in ownership concentration in privatefirm bidders, the opposite follows for public-firm bidders. The owners of a private target in an equity offer, as rational large shareholders, have economic incentives to monitor the performance of the bidder managers whereas atomistic shareholders of public targets in an equity offer do not. During the post-acquisition period, equity financing overall leads to a normal rate of return for private-firm bidders. This finding is consistent with the notion of rational pricing that the amount of compensation for the monitoring services by the target owners in equity offers reflects the incremental benefits of the <b>services</b> <b>accruing</b> to other bidder shareholders. In contrast, equity financing results in long-term losses for publicfirm bidders. Considering the differences in the wealth effects on bidder shareholders between private-firm takeovers and public-firm takeovers, this thesis also empirically explores two additional largely neglected issues. First, why do some bidders choose private targets and some others choose public targets or divested subsidiaries? Secondly, why equity financing rather than cash financing is used in some takeovers of private targets and not others (and vice versa) ? In the main, the results of investigating the potential factors influencing bidders' target choice decision reveal the importance of managerial ism in the bidder and the pressure to improve growth prospects facing the bidder. However, hubris arising from past performance does not appear to affect bidders' target choice decision. Lll The analysis of the potential determinants of payment methods in private-firm takeovers shows that the level of informational asymmetry in private-firm takeovers is likely to be trivial. The analysis also provides evidence that the choice of payment methods in privatefirm takeovers is ceteris paribus endogenous to the investment objective(s) of the target owners and that agency conflicts in the bidder can deter the target owners who have the objective to hold equity stakes in the combined firm.
