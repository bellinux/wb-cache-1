A previous work outlined the concept via application to a special tight-fitting enclosure. Application of the concept to a fan plenum requires different mathematical descriptions for the image groups. This paper describes the sound reverberation inside a sound enclosure with mostly open sides where the primary noise sources are the <b>air</b> <b>inlets</b> and exhausts of axial type fans located {{at the top of}} the enclosure, the sound transmission through the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> <b>openings,</b> and the radiation to wayside positions. The main reverberation between the floor and ceiling is determined with an image based mathematical model. The model considers how the main reverberant part image group is amplified by its images from two parallel bulkheads and any side wall frame members. The method of images approach allows the hard surfaces of an untreated plenum to be represented by perfectly reflecting surfaces with zero sound absorption coefficients, thus not requiring any estimate or measurement for these surfaces. Numerical results show excellent comparison to experimental results for an actual plenum. The image model is also shown to be significantly more accurate than the standard large room diffuse field reverberant model...|$|R

Because {{of the limitations of}} the globally used wet and dry decontamination processes from the viewpoints of processing speed and large size of the device required, this study developed a wind decontamination system in which forced convective flow is applied against the human body surface, similar to an industrial air-shower system. This study evaluated the decontamination performance of a prototype air-shower system with the aim of verifying the industrial feasibility of the wind decontamination system. Fundamental experiments were conducted to investigate the contaminant removal efficiency of the air-shower system by using hypothetical liquid-phase (pure liquid water) and gas-phase (SF 6 gas) contaminants.

The influences of the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> temperature and velocity on the air outlet temperature and heat transfer rate were investigated The <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> temperature used for the solidification of RT 25 were 10 °C, 12 °C and 14 °C and for the melting 34 °C, 36 °C and 38 °C. The selected <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> velocities were {{the same for the}} melting and solidification process: 0. 5 m/s, 1. 4 m/s and 2. 5 m/s. The results suggest that an increase of the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> velocity reduces linearly the temperature difference between the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> and outlet for the solidification process of the RT 25.

However, distribution of fresh air is equally important for animal performance and welfare.

Therefore, an airflow pattern sensor was developed to measure the trajectory of a non-isothermal air jet in a building with a single or multiple <b>air</b> <b>inlet(s).</b> The experimental conditions covered the whole year characteristics {{to come up with}} a general conclusion in an experimental room of 8 m x 4 in x 4 m. The principle of the airflow pattern sensor is to predict the trajectory of a non-isothermal air jet from the temperature distribution measured near to the <b>air</b> <b>inlet.</b> As seen from data analysis, a prediction of the airflow pattern in terms of drop distance was possible with an error of 0. 87 in in the range from 2. 40 to 7. 15 in using eight temperature sensors on an arc around the <b>inlet</b> <b>opening</b> in combination with inlet and outlet temperatures of the room.

The influences of the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> temperatures and velocities have been investigated on the charging/discharging time of the PCM panels, heating/cooling load and effectiveness over the phase transition.

The increase of the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> velocity reduced the charging and discharging time, however not linearly. The time for the complete melting and solidification is substantially reduced when the velocity has been increased from 0. 6 m/s to 1. 6 m/s. The <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> temperature has been proved to be most important factor affecting the discharging time.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{investigates the}} effect of <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> size on (i) the flowfield {{generated}} in a dry powder inhaler, and (ii) the device-specific resistance, and the subsequent effect on powder deagglomeration. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) {{analysis was used to}} simulate the flowfield generated in an Aerolizer 1 with different <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> sizes at 30, 45, and 60 l/min. Dispersion performance of the modified inhalers was measured using mannitol powder and a multistage liquid impinger at the same flow rates. The <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> size had a varying effect on powder dispersion depending on the flow rate. At low flow rates (30 and 45 l/min), reducing the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> size increased the inhaler dispersion performance by increasing the flow turbulence and particle impaction velocities above their critical levels for maximal powder dispersion. At 60 l/min, re-ducing the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> size reduced the inhaler dispersion performance by releasing a large amount of powder from the device before the turbulence levels and particle impaction velocities could be fully developed. The results demonstrate that the maximal inhaler dispersion performance can be predicted if details of the device flowfield are known...|$|R

Second, due to the greatly restricted radial size of the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> tube in the engine’s inlet system, the longer length of the traditional quarter-wavelength straight-tube {{will be difficult to}} arrange in a compact car <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> system.
