40|$|Tomato batches are characterised {{by large}} {{variation}} in the quality attributes colour and firmness. Acceptability of tomato batches is consequently affected by the colour maturity and firmness maturity. In this paper, {{a model for the}} <b>acceptance</b> <b>period</b> (AP) is presented that describes the acceptability of tomato batches as the time that all quality attributes are considered acceptable {{as a function of the}} maturity at harvest. This model takes into account that tomatoes can first be unacceptable due to being over-ripe, then be acceptable, and then be unacceptable again, due to being over-ripe. Furthermore, the AP model takes also into account that consumers may not consume all tomatoes in a truss at the same time, some immediately and some in 3 ¿ 4 days time. This is accomplished by combining the <b>acceptance</b> <b>period</b> for future and immediate consumption and taking the intersection of those two as the overall AP to indicate whether tomato batches are suited for both types of consumption. The AP model combines the effects of biological variation, varying consumer limits and the {{variation in the}} time of consumption into a practical method to assess acceptability of tomato batches at harvest. The AP model was based on three experiments. In the first and second experiment several tomato batches, differing in harvest maturity, were harvested and stored at three different temperatures. Colour and firmness was measured non-destructively and repeatedly over time so as to estimate the colour and firmness maturity at harvest for each batch. The third experiment was used to determine the consumer limits for today's consumption and consumption over the weekend. By combining the results from all experiments it was possible to estimate the AP as a function of the maturity at harvest, storage temperature and storage duration. The AP model might be used as a tool for growers to assess the acceptability of tomato batches periodically to analyse and solve quality issues or by optimising the compliance to consumer acceptance by varying the storage temperature and transport time to the retailers. Both applications may help to increase profitability in terms of repeated purchase by consumers...|$|E

Tensions grew between the government’s aggressive recruitment processes and the native’s desire to limit entry into France. This thesis explores the recruitment tactics employed by the SGI to lure workers to France in the 1920 s and the subsequent tensions surrounding immigration policy. Publications by French eugenicists, doctors of hygiene, and journalists reveal hostility toward the government’s recruitment procedures and the immigrant community. The native’s fears surrounding immigrant assimilation stemmed from ideas of racial hierarchy and diseased immigrants infecting the weakened French population.

40|$|In this study, {{important}} quality properties such as firmness, {{sugar and}} acid levels were measured and analysed in tomatoes harvested from three greenhouses during a five month period and stored at 16 degrees C for over 20 days. Tomatoes were harvested from three identical, neighbouring, greenhouses which were either conventionally ventilated (open greenhouse) or mechanically cooled (semi-closed greenhouses). Sugar and acids levels were hardly affected by greenhouse type. Compared {{to the open}} greenhouse, semi-closed greenhouses produced heavier and less mature (firmer) fruit at the commercial harvesting stage based on colour. Fruit maturity differences could {{be linked to the}} vertical temperature gradient and to CO 2 levels in the different greenhouses. This indicates that CO 2 levels and temperature affect the synchronisation between colour and firmness maturity at harvest. The <b>acceptance</b> <b>period,</b> i. e., the time period both tomato colour and firmness are considered acceptable by consumers, will likely be positively affected when growers switch from conventionally ventilated to semi-closed production systems. Additional to greenhouse effects also effects of the harvest month were observed. The sugar to acid ratio was highest and glucose to fructose ratio was lowest in July, the month with the highest irradiance, irrespective of greenhouse type. The estimated value for the maximum firmness (F-max) varied from 17. 9 N in August to 31. 2 N in June. This monthly variation in F-max explains {{an important part of the}} variation found in the postharvest behaviour of tomatoes. Interestingly, the monthly variation in F-max showed the same trend as found for the monthly initial sugar levels. It might be hypothesised that the monthly variation in glucose and fructose levels causes variation in that part of firmness that is generated by cell turgor. The monthly variation in F-max, sugar and acid levels could not be linked to climate conditions and remains to be elucidated. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|A large wave of Chinese {{immigrants}} {{came to the}} United States in {{the second}} half of the nineteenth century. Employment, mainly in the salmon-canning industry, drew thousands of them to coastal Astoria, Oregon. Taking the period between the first Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882 and the Immigration Act of 1924, this thesis focuses on the Chinese merchants in Astoria and their importance for our understanding of race relations in the town during these years. Specifically, the merchants help to make sense of how the Chinese related to the local white population, as different sources suggest different trends of amiability and hostility. Newspapers testify that local Chinese gained <b>acceptance</b> during the <b>period,</b> going generally from vilified outcasts to respected members of the community. Immigration case files, however, show that officials displayed little resistance to Chinese in the early exclusion years, but worked harder to deny Chinese applications toward the end of this period. So, from one body of records it seems that white Astorians grew more tolerant of Chinese during these years, while the other document set shows a rise in conflict with the immigrants. This apparent contradiction can be reconciled by considering the demographic changes in the Chinese immigrant community during this period, along with class biases and the role of merchants in immigration and social interactions...|$|R

40|$|The authors {{examined}} {{the effectiveness of}} different coping strategies in buffering {{the negative effects of}} uncontrollable stressors and predicting mental health symptoms in a low-autonomy work environment using a longitudinal design. Soldiers in training indicated {{the extent to which they}} engaged in various coping strategies to deal with stressors related to the training environment at 4 different points in time. Factor analyses of soldiers in 2 different countries (i. e., United States and Australia) yielded 5 coping dimensions: active coping, acceptance of demands, seeking social support, humor, and denial/self-criticism. Among U. S. soldiers in basic training, acceptance of demands and denial/self-criticism interacted with the magnitude of basic-training stressors to predict mental health symptoms (depression and anxiety) at 3 different points during training while controlling for symptoms at the immediate prior time <b>period.</b> <b>Acceptance</b> buffered soldiers from the negative effects of the stressors, whereas denial/self-criticism exacerbated the effects of the stressors. The results of LGC models also indicated that the slopes of acceptance and active coping were negatively related to the slope of mental health symptoms across training, whereas the slope for denial/self-criticism was positively related to the slope of symptoms. Active coping was less predictive of functioning in the face of stressors and in the prediction of symptoms over time.

40|$|AbstractAfter {{collapse}} and subsequent {{dissolution of the}} Soviet Union, post-Soviet Russia faced typical problems of state-building and nation-building. Nations are assumed as political communities of Modernity. They are constructed {{in the process of}} nation-building and are based on nationalism, defined as worldview which perceives social reality through the prism of dividing the world into nations-states. Nation-building is a discursive process where state’s activities predefine the type of nationalism being rooted. Using as a starting point ‘civic versus ethnic nationalism’ dichotomy, the article develops a transformed version of this typology, which is based on two dimensions: model of national membership (openness/closeness) and model of interaction among members (universalism/hierarchical particularism). The analysis of Annual Addresses of the Russian Presidents demonstrates that the Kremlin certainly produces open model of national membership. The key feature of ‘Russianness’ in the Kremlin discourse is commitment to the Russian culture where anyone can be recognized as ‘Russian’ as long as he/she shares the Russian cultural values. At the same time, the openness is combined with neglect of ‘civicism’. In contrast to ‘civicism’, which is based on rational notions of equal rights and responsibilities and universalistic patterns of behavior, the Kremlin image of Russian nation focuses on rather sacral idea of ‘the Russian way’, great historical mission as the destination of Russia. Openness of nationalism entails permanent expansion of the nation ‘outside itself’ in order to ‘absorb’ those groups who are able to accept Russian culture. Since the <b>acceptance</b> requires definite <b>period</b> of time, at any point of time Russian nation includes both ‘core of the nation’ and ‘aspirants’ that are in hierarchical order. Consequently, from the point of the second dimension, Russian nationalism falls into the category of hierarchical particularism...|$|R

Since 1986, SMC has fabricated more than 12 million pounds of depleted uranium (DU) products in a multitude of shapes and sizes with varying metallurgical properties while maintaining security, environmental, health and safety requirements. During initial facility design in the early 1980 `s, emphasis on employee safety, radiation control and environmental consciousness was gaining momentum throughout the DOE complex. This fact coupled with security and production requirements forced design efforts to focus on incorporating automation, local containment and computerized material accountability at all work stations. The result was a fully automated production facility engineered to manufacture DU armor packages with virtually no human contact while maintaining security, traceability and quality requirements. This hands off approach to handling depleted uranium resulted in minimal radiation exposures and employee injuries. Construction of the manufacturing facility was complete in early 1986 with the first armor package certified in October 1986. Rolling facility construction was completed in 1987 with the first certified plate produced in the fall of 1988.

Different study populations were formed: The Tolerability Study Group consists of HIV-infected patients who visited three outpatient clinics (Cologne, Bonn, Freiburg) during a predefined time period. Patients were offered nH 1 N 1 vaccination. Those accepting were administered a standard dose AS 03 adjuvant nH 1 N 1 vaccine. Questionnaires to report side effects occurring within 7 days after immunization were handed out. In a substudy conducted {{during the same time}} <b>period,</b> <b>acceptance</b> towards immunization was recorded. This Acceptance Study Group consists of all HIV-infected patients visiting the Cologne clinic. They were offered vaccination. In case of refusal, motivation was recorded. Results In the Tolerability Study Group, a total of 475 patient diaries returned in the three study centres could be evaluated, 119 of those (25 %) reported no side effects. Distribution of symptoms was as follows: Pain 285 / 475 patients (60 %), swelling 96 (20 %), redness 54 (11 %), fever 48 / 475 (10 %), muscle/joint ache 173 (36 %), headache 127 (27 %), and fatigue 210 (44 %). Association of side effects with clinical data was calculated for patients in Cologne and Bonn. Incidence of side effects was significantly associated with CDC stages A, B compared to C, and with a detectable viral load (> 50 copies/mL). No correlation was noted for CD 4 cell count, age, gender or ethnicity. In the Acceptance Study Group, 538 HIV-infected patients were offered vaccination, 402 (75 %) accepted, while 136 (25 %) rejected. Main reasons for rejection were: Negative media coverage (35 %), indecisiveness with preference to wait until a later date (23 %), influenza not seen as personal threat (19 %) and scepticism towards immunization in general (10 %). Conclusion A total of 622 HIV-infected patients were vaccinated against nH 1 N 1 -influenza in the three study centres. No severe adverse events were reported. The tolerability was in most parts comparable to general population. Acceptance rate towards influenza vaccination was high (75 %).

"Call {{admission}} control (CAC) extends {{the capabilities of}} Quality of service (QoS) tools which protect voice traffic from {{the negative effects of}} other voice traffic. It does not allow oversubscription of a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) network. To achieve better performance for efficient call {{admission control}}, various dynamic routings are being proposed. In the dynamic routing mechanism, the condition of the network is learned by observing the network condition via the probe packets and according to the defined threshold, routes are chosen dynamically. In such schemes, various combination of route selection is used such as two routes are used where one is fixed and other is random or two random routes are chosen and after observation one is chosen if it passes the test. Few schemes use a route history table along with the two random routes. But all have some issues like it selects random routes (not considering the number of hops), does not process memorization before admission threshold test, it calculates all selected paths regardless {{of the fact that they}} are selected or not, thereby wasting central processing unit (CPU) time and since these uses two routes so obviously the call admission probability is less. In this thesis work, a new dynamic routing scheme is proposed which considers a routing history table with endpoint admission control increasing the call admission probability, makes call establishment time faster and it saves valuable CPU resources. The proposed scheme considers a combination of three routes with routing history table [...] one is the direct route and the other two are selected randomly from all available routes and the routing history table is used to memorize the rejected calls. CAC tests like Admission Threshold were performed on the selected routes. Various parameters such as delay, packet loss, jitter, latency etc from the probe packets are used to carry out the tests. Performance of the proposed scheme with respect to other dynamic routing schemes is studied using a mathematical / analytical model. Also, effect of arrival rate probe packets on utilization, busy <b>period,</b> waiting <b>period,</b> <b>acceptance</b> probability of calls, probe packets, and the number of successful calls was also studied...|$|R
40|$|HEALTH RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE AND DEVICE-ACCEPTANCE IN PATIENTS WITH IMPLANTABLE CARDIOVERTER-DEFIBRILLATORS AND TELEMONITORING Florian Leppert, Johannes Siebermair, Stefan Kääb, Wolfgang Greiner OBJECTIVES: Telemedical systems (TMS) {{and data}} {{management}} for implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD) promise {{to reduce costs}} and optimize patient care. Depressive symptoms are common among patients with an ICD and the health related quality of life (HRQoL) {{is affected by the}} underlying disease and the implanted device, respectively. TMS might improve the HRQoL of patients and ICDs acceptance due to a closer monitoring and, thereby, an increased level of perceived safety. In this study, changes in the level of depression, HRQoL and device <b>acceptance</b> over a <b>period</b> of six months after ICD-implantation were investigated. METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, 161 (80. 7 % male; age: 64, 1 ± 14, 6; 82 % with coronary disease, 11 % with dilated cardiomyopathy) patients with an ICD were randomized at the day of implantation into intervention (n= 82) or control group (n= 79). Patients in the intervention group were equipped with a telemonitoring system that transferred device data (e. g. critical events, status of battery, heart function) from the patients’ home to the medical practitioner via internet. The control group received regular care. Patients were asked to fill out three questionnaires (the generic EQ- 5 D, the depression specific Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the device specific Florida Patient Acceptance Survey (FPAS)); the follow-up period was six month, with postal surveys on a monthly basis (7 times in total). Collected data were analyzed in a pseudonymized manner. Datasets with missing values were filled by applying the Expectation-Maximization (EM) method. RESULTS: Nine patients dropped out before survey completion at month six for different reasons (e. g. draw back consent or death). Of the remaining 152 patients 140 patients filled out at least two sets of questionnaires and were included in the analyses. After six months the mean improvement in the health related quality of life (EQ- 5 D-Index) in the telemonitoring group was 10. 7 points compared to baseline (p=. 006) while the mean change in HRQoL in the control group was 5. 5 points (p=. 138). FPAS and HADS-D showed small but non-significant advantage for the telemonitoring group concerning acceptance and level of depression, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary results suggest that telemonitoring systems have the ability to improve the health related quality of life of patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators. Results on effects towards the level of depression and anxiety and the enhancement of ICDs acceptance are also promising. Since ICDs are used in chronic heart diseases a longer follow-up period seems to be required to validate the effects. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{undertakes}} a postcolonial {{reading of}} {{a selection of}} the fiction and non-fiction of Ion Idriess, Arthur Upfield, Ernestine Hill and John K. Ewers. It argues that their published and unpublished writing and correspondence contributed to a mid-twentieth-century literary discourse concerning identity, race and nation. The connection this study makes between these four middlebrow writers is their relationship with Walkabout, an Australian middlebrow geographic magazine. All four writers were noted contributors to the journal. In several ways their writerly endeavours—both fiction and non-fiction—paralleled Walkabout‘s attempts to influence its readers‘ views concerning identity and nation, particularly in respect to rendering the lesser known and populated regions of Australia familiar to its readership. There {{is no shortage of}} studies concerning literature‘s engagement with the constructs of identity and nation, however, few examine the unfashionable and sometimes forgotten Australian middlebrow. This thesis argues that the mostly unsophisticated writing produced by Idriess, Upfield, Hill and Ewers not only sought to thrill and entertain, it challenged dominant racial ideology, re-imagined settler history and embraced a modern yet distinct national identity. Idriess, Upfield, Hill and Ewers engaged with their considerable readership in overt ways, and in hitherto unrecognised more subtle ways. Furthermore, many of their readers read across multiple genres and forms and were capable of nuanced and insightful interpretations of these works. The body of work examined in this thesis attracts criticism for perpetuating a nostalgic national image and adopting negative racial stereotypes. Such criticism fails to identify the more subtle manner in which this writing examined contradictions and ambiguities in mid-twentieth-century society. Idriess‘ writing reflected the <b>period‘s</b> <b>acceptance</b> of a racial hierarchy and the contested nature of Australia‘s cross-cultural relations, but it also supported the growing interest in Indigenous culture and unsettled dominant notions concerning race. Upfield‘s fiction and non-fiction undertook a similar endeavour. His examination of ambivalent relationships between black and white in pastoral Australia suggested that Aborigines should be afforded greater opportunities to participate in society. A selection of Hill and Ewers‘ writing recognised the role literature played in shaping a nation‘s culture and identity. Hill examined processes which imagined a white nation into being and shaped its identity. Ewers utilised aspects of Indigenous culture to support his representation of a distinct nation and encouraged a retreat from Empire. Both he and Upfield were outspoken advocates {{for the development of a}} broad and inclusive national literature which rejected notions of Australia‘s cultural inferiority. All four writers shifted many readers‘ gazes from urban preoccupations and encouraged them to envisage a distinct and prosperous nation which valued its unique culture above those of other Western societies...|$|R
