5|$|The Swiss peasant war of 1653 was {{a popular}} revolt in the Old Swiss Confederacy {{at the time of}} the Ancien Régime. A {{devaluation}} of Bernese money caused a tax revolt that spread from the Entlebuch valley in the Canton of Lucerne to the Emmental valley in the Canton of Bern and then to the cantons of Solothurn and Basel and also to the <b>Aargau.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{team also}} sent squads to the Grand Prix d'Ouverture La Marseillaise, the Gran Premio della Costa Etruschi, the Trofeo Laigueglia, Omloop Het Nieuwsblad, Les Boucles du Sud Ardèche, Cholet-Pays de Loire, Dwars door Vlaanderen, the Route Adélie de Vitré, the inaugural Flèche d'Emeraude, the Scheldeprijs, the Grand Prix de Denain the Tour du Finistère, the Amstel Gold Race, La Flèche Wallonne, the Eschborn-Frankfurt City Loop, the Grand Prix of <b>Aargau</b> Canton, the Grand Prix de Plumelec-Morbihan, and Boucles de l'Aulne, but placed {{no higher than}} 12th {{in any of these}} races.|$|E
5|$|Territories {{that had}} been conquered since the early 15th century were governed as condominiums by the cantons. Reeves for these territories were {{assigned}} by the Tagsatzung {{for a period of}} two years; the posts changed bi-annually between the cantons. The <b>Aargau</b> had been annexed in 1415. The western part belonged to Bern, while the eastern part comprised the two condominiums of the former County of Baden in the north and the Freie Ämter ("Free Districts") in the south. The Free Districts had been forcibly recatholized after the Reformation in Switzerland, and the Catholic cantons, especially Lucerne, Zug, and Uri considered these districts part of their sphere of influence and the reeves typically came from these cantons. The Thurgau, which had been annexed in 1460, was also a condominium of the Confederacy.|$|E
5|$|Bernese troops {{under the}} command of Sigmund von Erlach then {{advanced}} from Bern to the <b>Aargau</b> to meet the forces of Zürich. Under this double pressure, the peasants' resistance collapsed. Von Erlach's troops numbered about 6,000 men and 19 cannons. The operation was a veritable punitive expedition: the troops plundered the villages along their way and even razed the defenses of the small town of Wiedlisbach, which lost its town privileges and was declared a village again. On June 7, 1653, the Bernese army met with a troop of about 2,000 men of Leuenberger's army who were on their way back from Wohlenschwil. The peasants retreated to Herzogenbuchsee, where they were defeated by von Erlach's troops; the little town went up in flames {{in the course of the}} battle. Niklaus Leuenberger fled and went hiding, but he was betrayed by a neighbour and was apprehended by the Bernese district sheriff Samuel Tribolet on June 9, 1653.|$|E
5|$|On May 30, 1653, {{following}} an earlier {{resolution of the}} Tagsatzung and earlier Bernese demands, Zürich assembled an army with recruits from its own territories, from the Thurgau, and from Schaffhausen {{under the command of}} Conrad Werdmüller with the task to break any armed resistance once and for all times. Some 8,000 men with 800 horses and 18 cannons marched towards the <b>Aargau.</b> Already three days later, Werdmüller's army controlled the important crossing of the river Reuss at Mellingen. In the hills around the nearby villages Wohlenschwil and Othmarsingen a peasant army of some 24,000 men assembled, led by Leuenberger and Schybi. A peasant delegation tried to negotiate with Werdmüller, showing him the peace treaty concluded on the Murifeld. Werdmüller, who had been until then unaware of this treaty that had been signed only days before, refused to acknowledge the validity of the contract and demanded the unconditional surrender of the peasants. Thus rebutted, the peasants attacked Werdmüller's troops on June 3, 1653, but being poorly equipped and lacking any artillery, they were defeated decisively in the Battle of Wohlenschwil. The peasants were forced to agree to the peace of Mellingen, which annulled the Huttwil League. The peasant troops returned home and an amnesty was declared, except for the leaders of the movement.|$|E
5|$|Zwingli again {{took the}} lead in the disputation. His {{opponent}} was the aforementioned canon, Konrad Hofmann, who had initially supported Zwingli's election. Also taking part was a group of young men demanding a much faster pace of reformation, who among other things pleaded for replacing infant baptism with adult baptism. This group was led by Conrad Grebel, one of the initiators of the Anabaptist movement. During the first three days of dispute, although the controversy of images and the mass were discussed, the arguments led {{to the question of whether}} the city council or the ecclesiastical government had the authority to decide on these issues. At this point, Konrad Schmid, a priest from <b>Aargau</b> and follower of Zwingli, made a pragmatic suggestion. As images were not yet considered to be valueless by everyone, he suggested that pastors preach on this subject under threat of punishment. He believed the opinions of the people would gradually change and the voluntary removal of images would follow. Hence, Schmid rejected the radicals and their iconoclasm, but supported Zwingli's position. In November the council passed ordinances in support of Schmid's motion. Zwingli wrote a booklet on the evangelical duties of a minister, Kurze, christliche Einleitung (Short Christian Introduction), and the council sent it out to the clergy and the members of the Confederation.|$|E
25|$|The canton was not {{politically}} viable, notably {{due to its}} lack of an economic base; in both 1801 (Constitution of Malmaison) and 1802 (Second Helvetic Constitution), {{it was decided to}} merge the canton into <b>Aargau,</b> but the move was not completed. Napoleon Bonaparte signed the Act of Mediation on 19 February 1803 and, in the process, the canton of Baden was dissolved and united with the cantons of <b>Aargau</b> and Fricktal, forming the contemporary canton of <b>Aargau.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1803, Napoleon {{ordered the}} fusion of the cantons of <b>Aargau,</b> Baden and Fricktal. Aarau was {{declared}} {{the capital of the}} new, enlarged canton of <b>Aargau.</b> In 1820 the city wall was torn down, {{with the exception of the}} individual towers and gates, and the defensive ditches were filled in.|$|E
25|$|Despite intense {{diplomatic}} {{efforts by the}} protectors of Fricktal on 19 February 1803 to retain the canton's right of existence, exactly a year after its foundation, Napoleon Bonaparte decreed its merger with the cantons of <b>Aargau</b> and Baden on 19 March (forming the modern-day canton of <b>Aargau),</b> in the Act of Mediation, disestablishing the Helvetic Republic.|$|E
25|$|Boswil is a {{municipality}} in {{the district}} of Muri in the canton of <b>Aargau</b> in Switzerland.|$|E

25|$|In 1798, the Helvetian Republic was proclaimed and {{the lords}} from Bern were ousted. The canton of <b>Aargau</b> was founded and Lenzburg became a {{district}} capital in 1803.|$|E
25|$|The former canton {{can still}} be {{identified}} with the contemporary <b>Aargau</b> districts of Zurzach, Baden, Bremgarten and Muri (albeit with the gains and losses in 1803 as detailed above).|$|E
25|$|In 1803 Napoleon's Act of Mediation {{partially}} {{restored the}} sovereignty of the cantons, and the former subject territories of <b>Aargau,</b> Thurgau, Vaud and Ticino became cantons with equal rights.|$|E
25|$|The Lenzburg {{railway station}} {{is served by}} fast trains Zürich-Aarau-Basel, and by local trains of the Zürich S-Bahn, <b>Aargau</b> S-Bahn and Lucerne S-Bahn. Zurich International Airport is within close reach (around 1 hour by train).|$|E
25|$|Under the {{centralized}} {{government of}} the Helvetic Republic cantons were purely administrative entities, which were in turn divided into districts and municipalities. Brugg thus lost all of its previously privileges and became a district capital in the Canton of <b>Aargau.</b>|$|E
25|$|The city of Basel {{functions}} {{as the capital}} of the Swiss half-canton of Basel-Stadt, though several of its suburbs are located in the half-canton of Basel-Landschaft or the canton of <b>Aargau.</b> Others are even located in France and Germany.|$|E
25|$|In 1415 Bern invaded lower <b>Aargau</b> {{with the}} help of Solothurn. Aarau capitulated after a short resistance, and was forced to swear {{allegiance}} to the new rulers. In the 16th century, the rights of the lower classes were abolished.|$|E
25|$|In 1803 Napoleon's Act of Mediation {{reestablished}} a Swiss Confederation that partially {{restored the}} sovereignty of the cantons, and the former tributary and allied territories of <b>Aargau,</b> Thurgau, Graubünden, St. Gallen, Vaud and Ticino became cantons with equal rights.|$|E
25|$|Some {{parts of}} the canton of Baden at this point were {{transferred}} to other cantons: the Amt of Hitzkirch to Lucerne, whilst Hüttikon, Oetwil an der Limmat, Dietikon and Schlieren went to Zürich. In return, Lucerne's Amt of Merenschwand was transferred to <b>Aargau</b> (district of Muri).|$|E
25|$|In 1803, Napoleon's Act of Mediation {{partially}} {{restored the}} sovereignty of the cantons, and the former tributary and allied territories of <b>Aargau,</b> Thurgau, Grisons, St. Gallen, Vaud and Ticino became cantons with equal rights. Napoleon and his enemies fought numerous campaigns in Switzerland that ruined many localities.|$|E
25|$|In the Diet, six cantons {{which had}} a {{population}} of more than 100,000 (Bern, Zurich, Vaud, St Gallen, Graubünden and <b>Aargau)</b> were given two votes, the others having but one apiece. Meetings of the Diet were to be held alternately at Fribourg, Bern, Solothurn, Basel, Zürich and Lucerne.|$|E
25|$|The village lies {{on a hill}} {{above and}} {{to the east of}} the Reuss Valley, {{covering}} part of the Mutschellen Pass. This municipality is bounded by Rudolfstetten-Friedlisberg, Widen, Zufikon, and Oberwil-Lieli, all in canton <b>Aargau,</b> and shares a boundary with the canton of Zurich (district of Dietikon) to the east.|$|E
25|$|Fricktal was a canton of the Helvetic Republic from February 1802 to February 1803, {{consisting}} of {{that part of}} the Breisgau (in Habsburg Further Austria) south of the Rhine ("the Fricktal"). Now, the territories of Fricktal form the districts of Rheinfelden and Laufenburg in the canton of <b>Aargau.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{originally}} separate settlements Unterberikon (Lower Berikon) and Oberberikon (Upper Berikon) {{fell under}} the territorial lordship {{of the city of}} Zurich in 1415, when the Eidgenossen (Confederacy) conquered <b>Aargau.</b> Later, in 1471, Unterberikon became part of Amt Rohrdorf in the county of Baden, while Oberberikon {{fell under the}} oversight of the Kelleramt (Freiamt Affoltern).|$|E
25|$|Growing social {{differences}} {{and an increasing}} absolutism in the city cantons during the Ancien Régime led to local popular revolts. An uprising during the post-war depression after the Thirty Years' War escalated to the Swiss peasant war of 1653 in Lucerne, Berne, Basel, Solothurn and the <b>Aargau.</b> The revolt was put down swiftly by force {{and with the help}} of many cantons.|$|E
25|$|Many cantons of Switzerland {{include a}} part in the Swiss Plateau. Entirely {{situated}} within the Swiss Plateau are the cantons of Zurich, Thurgau and Geneva; mostly situated within the Swiss Plateau are the cantons of Lucerne, <b>Aargau,</b> Solothurn, Berne, Fribourg and Vaud; small portions of the Swiss Plateau are situated in the cantons of Neuchâtel, Zug, Schwyz, St. Gallen and Schaffhausen.|$|E
25|$|The first Solaris Urbino Hybrid 18 {{was sold}} in 2006 to Dresden. In 2007 3 buses were sold to Leipzig and Bochum (delivered in January 2008) in Germany and Lenzburg in the Swiss canton of <b>Aargau.</b> In 2008 the modernised model came to Bern, Glonn, Hannover, Munich and Poznań. In 2009 a test vehicle of the Solaris company was given to PKM Sosnowiec from 2008.|$|E
25|$|The urban {{educational}} and cultural opportunities of Aarau were extended through numerous new institutions. A Theatre and Concert Hall {{was constructed in}} 1883, which was renovated and expanded in 1995–96. The <b>Aargau</b> Nature Museum opened in 1922. A former cloth warehouse was converted into a small theatre in 1974, and the alternative culture center KIFF (Culture in the fodder factory) was established in a former animal fodder factory.|$|E
25|$|Frederick IV {{fell into}} {{disregard}} at the Council of Constance in 1415, after he assisted {{the flight of}} the opposition Pope John XXIII. In response, Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund requested the Swiss {{to take control of}} <b>Aargau.</b> Bern did not hesitate and dispatched troops at once. The residents of Brugg did not resist the invaders and allowed them to enter the town unopposed. In return Bern left the town alone.|$|E
25|$|After the Council of 1870, bishop Eugène Lachat of the Diocese of Basel {{proclaimed the}} dogma of papal infallibility in his diocese {{even though the}} {{respective}} cantons (Solothurn, Lucerne, Zug, Bern, <b>Aargau,</b> Thurgau and Basel-Landschaft) had expressly forbidden him to do so. Two priests in Lucerne and Starrkirch did not acknowledge the new dogma. Lachat deposed and excommunicated them. Thereupon, the cantons Solothurn, Bern, <b>Aargau,</b> Thurgau and Basel-Landschaft deposed the bishop on 29 January 1873 and when the cathedral chapter refused to appoint an interim bishop, on 21 December 1874 they dissolved the diocese of Basel and liquidated Lachat's assets. Lachat moved his office from Solothurn to Lucerne. 97 clerics in the predominantly Catholic part of the canton Berne (today canton Jura) protested against the deposition of the bishop and {{the dissolution of the}} diocese. They proclaimed Lachat to be their rightful bishop at which the Federal Council deposed them. Rioting in several villages of the Jura region was quelled by force and military occupation; the 97 clerics were expelled in January 1874. The federal government rescinded this ordninance in 1875 but supremacy over the church by the canton of Berne was confirmed in a plebiscite.|$|E
25|$|Jews were {{banished from}} Swiss {{towns in the}} 1620s, and from 1776, {{they were allowed to}} reside {{exclusively}} in two villages, Lengnau and Oberendingen, in what is now the canton of <b>Aargau.</b> At the close of the 18th century, the 553 Jews in these villages represented almost the entire Jewish population in Switzerland. An important source for the situation of Swiss Jews in the 18th century is the 1768 Sammlung Jüdischer Geschichten by Johann Caspar Ulrich.|$|E
25|$|Johann Jakob Sulzer (1806–1883), a Democratic Party {{politician}} from Winterthur, {{founded the}} Lake Constance–Lake Geneva Railway (German: Bodensee-Genfersee-Bahn), later renamed the Swiss National Railway (German: Schweizerische Nationalbahn, SNB) to overcome {{shortcomings of the}} existing railways in providing an adequate and co-ordinated network. It planned to build a line from Lake Constance and Singen to Lausanne via Winterthur, <b>Aargau,</b> Solothurn, Lyss, Murten and Payerne. Construction started in 1875 but it went bankrupt in 1878 and its assets were acquired by the NOB and SCB.|$|E
25|$|In Switzerland shechitah was {{forbidden}} {{throughout the whole}} country in 1893 after having been banned in the cantons of <b>Aargau</b> and St. Gallen in 1867 after plebiscites, and later a ban {{was introduced in the}} whole of Switzerland after a plebiscite at Federal level. The system of voting on individual policies using referendums (plebiscites) had only recently been introduced. and the first plebiscite in Swiss history was on the subject of banning shechita. The government and all the political parties were against the ban, but the popular sentiment won the day.|$|E
25|$|As of 1820, a {{total number}} of 8,000 {{distinct}} coins were current in Switzerland, issued by cantons, cities, abbeys and principalities or lordships, mixed with surviving coins of the Helvetic Republic and the pre-1798 Helvetic Republic. In 1825, the cantons of Berne, Basel, Fribourg, Solothurn, <b>Aargau</b> and Vaud formed a monetary concordate, issuing standardised coins, the so-called Konkordanzbatzen, still carrying the coat of arms of the issuing canton but interchangeable and identical in value. The reverse {{side of the coin}} displayed a Swiss cross with the letter C in the center.|$|E
25|$|The {{civil war}} during the Reformation {{ended in a}} stalemate. The Catholic cantons could block council {{decisions}} but, due to geographic and economic factors, could not prevail over the Protestant cantons. Both factions began to hold separate councils, still meeting at a common Tagsatzung (although the common council was deadlocked by disagreements between both factions until 1712, when the Protestant cantons gained power after their victory in the second war of Villmergen). The Catholic cantons were excluded from administering the condominiums in the <b>Aargau,</b> the Thurgau and the Rhine valley; in their place, Berne became co-sovereign of these regions.|$|E
