5|$|The {{production}} of The Rescuers signaled {{the beginning of}} a changing of the guard process in the personnel at the Disney animation studio: as veterans such as Milt Kahl and Les Clark retired, they were gradually replaced by new talents such as Don Bluth, Ron Clements, John Musker, and Glen Keane. The new animators, culled from the <b>animation</b> <b>program</b> at CalArts and trained by Eric Larson, Frank Thomas, Ollie Johnston, and Woolie Reitherman got their first chances to prove themselves as a group with the animated sequences in Disney's live-action/animated hybrid feature Pete's Dragon (1977), the animation for which was directed by Don Bluth. In September 1979, dissatisfied with what they felt was a stagnation {{in the development of the}} art of animation at Disney, Bluth and several of the other new guard animators quit to start their own studio, Don Bluth Productions, which became Disney's chief competitor in the animation field during the 1980s.|$|E

500|$|Pileggi had {{to endure}} long bouts of make-up application. To create the {{principal}} illusion of monstrous veins, long black faux-veins were glued onto his face, arms, and torso.

I really don't know how those guys on Star Trek or Babylon 5 can stand having that done to them every day. I just wouldn't work if that's what it took". To show the nanobot infection progressing, special effects makeup supervisor John Vulich used two different make-up sets.

500|$|South Park animators {{created the}} episode using PowerAnimator, the Alias Systems Corporation <b>animation</b> <b>program</b> most {{commonly}} known as [...] "Alias". Eric Stough, director of animation for the series, said [...] "Mecha-Streisand" [...] was slightly more challenging to animate than other first season episodes due to the laser beam-type effects featured in the final monster fight, which were specifically designed to resemble a low-budget monster movie with poor graphics. The scenes with an instructional guide taking the kids on a fossil hunt were based on real-life arrowhead-digging excursions Parker and Stone went on in Red Rocks Park during their childhood in Colorado. During a scene with Chef and Leonard Maltin driving in a car, actual video footage of Colorado roads is visible through the back window of the car. The footage was shot by a friend of Parker and Stone and used because the animators did not yet know how to create roads in perspective.|$|E

500|$|South Park animators {{created the}} episode using PowerAnimator, the Alias Systems Corporation <b>animation</b> <b>program</b> most {{commonly}} known as [...] "Alias". It was particularly challenging for animators to design the complex scheme of lights during the episode's disco club scene. Eric Stough, director of animation for the series, said it {{took one of the}} technical directors [...] "about half a day" [...] to set up the brief scene. Parker said he was particularly happy with the animation in [...] "Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride", and said he believed the series was starting to settle into the defined look it has retained throughout the years. Parker said, [...] "I think that this was where we finally felt like we got it right, we got the look of it right". However, the animation includes some perspective errors, particularly during the football scenes, where Chef stands about as wide as a 10-yard marking on the field. Parker said the animators worked for a long time on the snow in the outdoor scenes, but ultimately decided they did not like how it came out.|$|E
500|$|In {{writing the}} script, the duo sought to give Comedy Central {{executives}} {{an idea of}} what the series would be like and how each show could differ from the others. Parker and Stone also said they would not write another script until the network signed off on the full show with a season of at least six episodes. Comedy Central liked the script and agreed to commit to a series. While [...] "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe" [...] was created almost entirely with construction paper, [...] "Weight Gain 4000" [...] was the first South Park episode made completely using computers. It was created in little over a month in a studio in Westwood, California, by about 15 animators using PowerAnimator, the Alias Systems Corporation <b>animation</b> <b>program</b> most commonly known as [...] "Alias", which would be used in subsequent episodes. In the future, South Park shows would be created within a week of their broadcast dates and require about 40 animators. [...] "Weight Gain 4000" [...] was animated in chronological order from beginning to end. Although Parker and Stone sought to improve the details and textures of the characters and overall animation, they also specifically chose Alias because it would allow the animation to maintain the show's deliberately crude visual style they first created with construction paper in The Spirit of Christmas and [...] "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe".|$|E
500|$|Elsa's {{appearance}} {{had to be}} redesigned {{following her}} transition from antagonist to protagonist. She was originally drawn in a style similar to other Disney villains, with blue skin and spiky black hair. A {{few months after the}} film's release, visual development artist Claire Keane (the daughter of Disney Legend Glen Keane) published early concept art of Elsa that was modeled after the singer Amy Winehouse. At the time, she was imagined as having blue [...] "bouffant" [...] hair as well as [...] "a deep, soulful voice and dramatic mood swings". Lasseter reportedly influenced the creation of the character's much softer final appearance, particularly in regards to her very thick platinum blonde hair, which animators found difficult to design. Art director Michael Giaimo said that while a number of strategies were proposed for Elsa's hair, Lasseter would push the animation team to continue making improvements, saying, [...] "It's not aspirational enough. We want people to feel like this hair is a beautiful statement." [...] During a research trip, producers found that [...] "there are lots of braids" [...] worn by women in Norway; they then hired a stylist from New York named [...] "Danilo" [...] who helped to create a style that would reflect that while still being [...] "a little different". A new <b>animation</b> <b>program</b> called Tonic was invented to assist with the task, and the character's hair ultimately required 420,000 CGI threads. By contrast, Anna was given roughly 140,000 hairs while Rapunzel from Tangled had only required 27,000 CGI threads for her hair.|$|E

40|$|Physics-based <b>animation</b> <b>programs</b> {{can often}} be modeled in terms of hybrid automata. A hybrid {{automaton}} includes both discrete and continuous dynamical variables. The discrete variables define the automaton's modes of behavior. The continuous variables are governed by mode-dependent differential equations. This paper describes a system for specifying and automatically synthesizing physics-based <b>animation</b> <b>programs</b> based on hybrid automata. The system presents a program developer with a family of parameterized specification schemata. Each scheme describes a pattern of behavior as a hybrid automaton passes through a sequence of modes. The developer specifies a program by selecting one or more schemata and supplying application-specific instantiation parameters for each of them. Each scheme {{is associated with a}} set of axioms in a logic of hybrid automata. The axioms serve to document the semantics of the specification scheme. Each scheme is also associated with a set of implementation rules. The rules synthesize program components implementing the specification in a general physics-based animation architecture. The system allows <b>animation</b> <b>programs</b> to be developed and tested in an incremental manner. The system itself can be extended to incorporate additional schemata for specifying new patterns of behavior, along with new sets of axioms and implementation rules. It has been implemented and tested on over a dozen examples. We believe this research is a significant step toward a specification and synthesis system that is flexible enough to handle a wide variety of <b>animation</b> <b>programs,</b> yet restricted enough to permit programs to be synthesized automatically. 1...|$|R
