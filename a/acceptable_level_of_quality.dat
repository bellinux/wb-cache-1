The amount of {{exposure}} variation that a given film can tolerate while still producing an <b>acceptable</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>quality</b> is called its exposure latitude.

After covering the mobility and QoS management principles and integration, this paper also proposes a new QoS-aware architecture for mobile Internet. This new architecture takes into account the specific characteristics of mobile networks in order to design an integrated Mobility/QoS-aware management architecture suitable for realtime applications requirements. The solution avoids network congestion as well as the starvation of less priority DiffServ classes while increasing resource utilization for priority classes while maintaining the QoS offer to MN’s applications by making each DiffServ class unchangeable with MNs mobility. The proposed mobility management model is simple, easy to implement, and takes into consideration mobile internet requirements.

This architecture uses a VoIP gateway associated with an 802. 11 e QoS enhanced access point (QAP) to transcode voice flows be-fore their transmissions over the wireless channel. The instantaneous bit rate is determined by a control mechanism based on the estimation of channel congestion state.

To ensure an <b>acceptable</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>quality</b> of service for users in a wireless data network, network designers rely on signal propagation path loss models. To provide adaptability, the use of machine learning techniques has been considered to predict characteristics of the wireless channel.

Simulation results indicate that, depending on the employed kernel and its parameters, the performance obtained using support vector regression is similar and with lower computational complexity to that obtained by a multilayer perceptron neural network.
