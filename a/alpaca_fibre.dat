40|$|<b>Alpaca</b> <b>fibre</b> has low crimp {{and smooth}} fibre surface. This makes the fibre {{difficult}} to process, particularly in sliver/fibre transferring and delivering processes. Blending with wool enhances the <b>alpaca</b> <b>fibre</b> processibility, makes the fibre more easily processed on modern wool processing facilities, {{and allows the}} development of new products. To evaluate the effect of wool fibre properties, especially wool crimp, on alpaca/wool blends, two <b>alpaca</b> <b>fibre</b> lots were processed to tops then blended with three commercial wool tops via top gillings. Yarns and knitted fabrics were subsequently engineered with identical machine settings. The performance of alpaca/wool blend slivers, yarns and fabrics has been investigated in this paper. Blending <b>alpaca</b> <b>fibre</b> with wool improves the cohesion properties of the blend slivers, especially with high-crimp wools. Wool fibre crimp does not affect the evenness of blend yarns, but may affect the yarn hairiness value and tensile properties. The alpaca/wool fabrics exhibit satisfactory pilling performance.

40|$|The {{molecular}} basis of inheritance of <b>alpaca</b> <b>fibre</b> colour is poorly understood. However, colour dilution genes are anticipated to be causing a major effect on <b>alpaca</b> <b>fibre</b> colour. Candidate genes for dilutions included tyrosinase (tyr) and membrane associated transport protein (matp), {{both of which}} have been associated with coat colour dilution in other species. The coding regions of the tyr and matp genes were sequenced in 24 animals with various colour phenotypes. No polymorphism found in the coding region of tyr and matp exons 1, 3, 4, 5 and 7 could account for the dilutions in fibre colour observed...|$|E

The uses of mohair, new product development and developments within the Australian industry including improvements in mohair marketing and uses of objective mohair testing are discussed. The increase in knowledge, since 1980, of grazing and nutritional requirements, methods of improving mohair quality and the availability and use of new genetic material are reviewed. The origin of carpet wool sheep and their management requirements are reviewed. The uses and processing of carpet wool, and the complexity of carpet production and design are discussed. Improvements in carpet wool specification and marketing are reviewed. Breeding requirements for speciality carpet wool are defined. Origin, uses, world production and prospects of angora (rabbit) and <b>alpaca</b> <b>fibre</b> production are briefly reviewed...|$|E

40|$|This study {{reports the}} latest {{research}} into <b>alpaca</b> and wool <b>fibres.</b> In particular, those properties that have received little attention in research literature have been examined. They include single fibre abrasion and bending fatigue, single fibre tensile properties, as well as resistance to compression behaviour. These properties are important because they affect the softness and pilling propensity of these fibres and the resultant fabrics. Clean wool and <b>alpaca</b> <b>fibres</b> were used in this study. Fibre abrasion/bending fatigue measurements were carried out using a Textechno FIBRESTRESS instrument. The resistance to compression (RtC) tests were carried out according to Australian Standard AS 3535 - 1988. The results indicate that wool and <b>alpaca</b> <b>fibres</b> behave quite differently, even though both fibre types are of animal origin. Wool fibre resistance to compression decreases as fibre diameter increases while the opposite appears to occur for <b>alpaca</b> <b>fibres.</b> For both wool and alpaca the number of abrasion/bending cycles at fibre break increases {{with an increase in}} fibre diameter, it takes longer to break the <b>alpaca</b> <b>fibres.</b> Reasons for these differences have been postulated based on differences in fibre surface and structure between alpaca and wool. <br /...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of recent research on a range of natural fibres and textiles. The focus is on work carried out at Deakin University’s Centre for Material and Fibre Innovation, which is a multidisciplinary research centre with over 100 researchers. The fibres include hemp, wool, silk, and <b>alpaca</b> <b>fibres.</b> Research on yarns, fabrics, and fine powders made from wool and silk fibres are briefly discussed also. The within-fibre diameter variation of wool has been examined systematically, which highlights the importance of this hard-to-measure fibre attribute. A relationship between hemp fibre fineness and residual gum content has been established, which provides a rapid means of assessing the residual gum content in the degummed hemp fibres. Silk and wool fibres have been converted into ultrafine powders for advanced applications. The Resistance to Compression (RtC) behaviour of wool and <b>alpaca</b> <b>fibres</b> has been closely examined, which challenges the belief that RtC is a good indicator of fibre softness. Ways of reducing the hairiness of natural fibre yarns, predicting the pilling propensity of wool knits, and functionalising fabrics for superhydrophobicity and photochromic or colour changing effects are discussed. <br /...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of wool and other fibres, in particular those produced by camelids (special fibres) in South America is reviewed. The two main production systems, namely commercial and smallholding are described, including their geographic locations. Wool {{is by far}} the main animal fibre produced in South America with a volume of 143 million kg (greasy) followed by the <b>alpaca</b> <b>fibre</b> with 4 million kg. Sheep breeding programs in the four South American countries with the largest sheep populations are summarized. Argentina and Uruguay have the most developed sheep genetic improvement programs. Their evolution from the beginning in the 1970 ’s until now is reviewed, including a description of the present programs...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studied the}} wool and <b>alpaca</b> <b>fibre</b> {{curvature}} and its variation during the fibre processing. It revealed {{the effect of}} wool fibre crimp on the cohesion properties of alpaca and wool blended slivers. Different wool and alpaca tops were blended via a number of gillings, {{and the role of}} wool fibre curvature in alpaca/wool blend processing has also been investigated. During the wool fibre processing, fibre curvature tended to diminish gradually from scoured fibre to top. Blending wool with alpaca fibres improved the cohesion properties of the blended sliver, compared with pure alpaca slivers. For a high ratio of alpaca component in the blend, a high-crimp wool should be used to achieve good sliver cohesion. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Many {{classes of}} alpaca fibres contain {{a certain amount}} of coarse fibres, which are strong and stiff, and cause {{discomfort}} to the end users of the <b>alpaca</b> <b>fibre</b> products. It is therefore desirable to separate the coarse fibres from the fine alpaca fibres. This paper reports trial results on alpaca dehairing using a cashmere dehairing machine. The diameters of alpaca fleece, dehaired alpaca fibres and removed alpaca fibres were analysed, and the fibre lengths before and after dehairing have been compared. The results indicate that it is feasible to dehair alpaca fibres using a cashmere dehairing facility. The dehaired alpaca fibres are cleaner, bulkier and softer, with around 1. 5 μm reduction in average fibre diameter, but the dehairing process shortens the dehaired fibre length considerably. The dehairing effectiveness of coarse fibre removal using the cashmere dehairing technology has also been discussed in this paper. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Softness is {{a unique}} selling point for luxury <b>fibres</b> such as <b>alpaca.</b> However, {{there is very little}} {{objective}} data on the softness of animal fibres. This study first establishes that the resistance to compression (RtC) behaviour of <b>alpaca</b> and wool <b>fibres</b> is quite different, and that the RtC method {{can not be used to}} examine the softness of different animal fibres. It then reports a new method for evaluating fibre softness. This method is based on the measurement of the force required to pull a fibre bundle through a series of parallel pins. This force, reflecting the combined effect of fibre surface properties, fibre diameter and rigidity, can achieve reasonable discrimination between fibres of varying levels of softness, such as alpaca and wool. Mechanisms responsible for the superior softness of <b>alpaca</b> <b>fibres</b> are discussed also. <br /...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{promising}} perspectives of using keratins extracted by sulphitolysis reaction from Merino wool (KM) and Brown <b>Alpaca</b> <b>fibres</b> (KA) in poly (l-lactide) (PLLA) -based biomaterials. Both types of keratin were dispersed in chloroform (CHCl 3) and tetrahydrofuran (THF), and optimisation of dispersion methods and parameters using the two selected solvents was considered. The extraction yield, as well as supermolecular structures, morphology and thermal behaviour of the two proteins {{before and after the}} regeneration in CHCl 3 was investigated. The results indicated that the supermolecular structures and thermal behaviour of the two proteins were affected by the interaction with CHCl 3, producing decrease of the amount of α-helix structures in KM and an increase for KA, a slight decrease of β-sheet structures and a reduced thermal stability of α-crystallites for both keratins. Biocomposite films based on PLLA polymer matrix and two different contents of Merino wool and Brown Alpaca keratins (1 % and 5 % wt) were successfully developed by solvent casting in chloroform and the resulting morphologies after incorporation of different keratins (as a function of content and source) give evidence of different surface topographies, with a random distribution of keratin in flask-like structure. PLLA/ 5 KA and PLLA/ 5 KM samples with 1 % and 5 % wt of keratins show a specific pore-like surface microstructure, induced by solvent evaporation. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Some <b>alpacas</b> {{maintain}} fine <b>fibre</b> throughout life, {{while others}} suffer from significant coarsening of fibre as they age, a trait known as micron blowout. Micron blowout results in reduced productivity, through reduced yield {{of high quality}} fibre {{over the life of}} an animal. Data from a well-established alpaca herd in Peru was used in a complex quantitative genetics analysis to determine if genetics plus environment, or environment alone was responsible for micron blowout in alpacas. This project has shown that micron blowout has a moderate heritability in alpacas, and that selection against micron blowout would be successful in reducing the extent of the problem. This report is targeted at Australian alpaca breeders...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} aimed at characterizing {{the type and}} {{arrangement}} of skin follicles of Suri and Huacaya alpaca. Samples (11 Suri and 10 Huacaya) were collected by punch skin biopsy from the midside of alpaca and processed for histological study. Each biopsy was examined using projection microscope. Follicular groups were identified and the position of each secondary and primary follicle was recorded. The ratio of secondary to primary follicles (S/P ratio) was compared between breeds using the Wilcoxon test. The spatial structure of the follicles was analyzed with Ripley’s K function and the L function. To detect deviations from Complete Spatial Randomness at different spatial scales simulated confidence envelopes were calculated. The S/P ratio did not differ between Huacaya (7. 1 ± 0. 52) and Suri (7. 21 ± 0. 62). There is evidence of statistically significant spatial structure of the follicles in both breeds at small spatial scales. However, at a higher spatial scale, the proportion of samples with a clustered spatial structure of follicles was significantly higher in Huacaya. The study of skin follicles spatial pattern opens up new possibilities for improving knowledge of the potential role of skin follicle in <b>alpaca</b> <b>fibre</b> production...|$|E
50|$|Alpacas {{are kept}} in herds that graze on the level heights of the Andes of {{southern}} Peru, western Bolivia, Ecuador, and northern Chile {{at an altitude of}} 3500 m to 5000 m above sea level, throughout the year. Alpacas are considerably smaller than llamas, and unlike llamas, they were not bred to be beasts of burden, but were bred specifically for their <b>fibre.</b> <b>Alpaca</b> fiber is used for making knitted and woven items, similar to wool. These items include blankets, sweaters, hats, gloves, scarves, a wide variety of textiles and ponchos in South America, and sweaters, socks, coats and bedding {{in other parts of the}} world. The fibre comes in more than 52 natural colors as classified in Peru, 12 as classified in Australia and 16 as classified in the United States.|$|R
40|$|MSc (Biochemistry), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 Alpacas {{were first}} {{introduced}} into South Africa {{during the year}} 2000. They are valuable because of the fine quality wool they produce which has much better insulation properties than that of merino wool <b>fibres.</b> <b>Alpacas</b> are also used to act as guards of sheep herds against predators. During 2008, blood samples from an alpaca that died acutely with severe lung oedema, respiratory distress and froth exuding from the nose were received at Elsenburg Veterinary Laboratory. The alpaca was from a herd of 23 alpacas of a British veterinarian in the Montagu district in the western Cape. Virus isolation attempts on the blood produced infrequent embryo mortalities. Embryonated chicken egg (ECE) material was send to the Virology Department at the Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute (OVI). A bluetongue virus (BTV) PCR performed at the diagnostic PCR laboratory at OVI on the ECE material was positive. Further intra-venous (IV) inoculations in ECE produced embryo mortalities on two consecutive days, the 8 th and 9 th November. The dead embryos were harvested separately and named and treated as two separate virus samples, Alp 8 and Alp 9 which were further passaged on baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells. The BTV virus neutralisation tests (VNT) performed at the Office International des Epizooties (OIE) Laboratory on both Alp 8 and Alp 9 were negative. Because of the close serological relationship between BTV and epizootic haemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV), an EHDV VNT was also performed and was also negative. In {{the light of the}} negative VNT and the positive BTV PCR results, more in-depth molecular analyses were performed. RNA was purified from tissue culture material and agarose gel electrophoresis (AGE) performed. Both Alp 8 and Alp 9 had a typical orbiviral electrophoretic profile, but their respective profiles were different. A sequence-independent reverse transcriptase PCR amplification method generated ample complementary DNA (cDNA) of both samples for sequencing. Sanger sequencing was used to partially sequence genome segments 5 (NS 1) and 2 (VP 2). BLAST analysis of the partial information of the genome segments 5 (NS 1) of Alp 8 confirmed it as being a BTV and Alp 9 as being an EHDV. BLAST analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence generated of VP 2 of both Alp 8 and Alp 9 established that these samples were possibly new serotypes of BTV and EHDV respectively. The complete genome of both Alp 8 and Alp 9 was sequenced with next generation 454 Pyrosequencing. This confirmed the partial sequencing results. BLAST analysis of the complete sequence of S 2 (VP 2) of Alp 8 showed that it has 73 % nucleotide and 77 % deduced amino acid identity to BTV 15. In contrast the nucleic acid sequence of genome segment S 2 (VP 2) of Alp 9 had no nucleotide sequence identity to any virus, but its deduced amino acid sequence had 71 % amino acid identity to EHDV 2. Hyper immune guinea pig (GP) serum prepared against the putative new BT (Alp 8) and EHD (Alp 9) virus serotypes were tested for serological cross-reactivity against the 24 OIE reference antigen strains of BTV and the 8 OIE reference antigen strains of EHDV. Alp 8 had a neutralising antibody (NAb) titre of > 32 against BTV 15. Alp 9 did not cross react with any of the OIE BTV and EHDV strains. Six out of the remaining 22 alpacas on the farm had NAbs {{to a greater or lesser}} extend against Alp 8 (BTV) and Alp 9 (EHDV) viruses, which confirmed that the viruses were also present in other alpacas in the herd. Very few cases of EHDV in alpacas have ever been reported in literature. A small scale pilot vector susceptibility study showed that vector competence of C. imicola for both Alp 8 and Alp 9 was low, below 2 %. The fact that neutralising antibodies to Alp 8 and Alp 9 were detected in other alpacas in the herd raises the question as to whether there are other Culicoides species circulating in the area that could vector the viruses. In conclusion, the results from the serological and virological analyses as well as the nucleic acid sequence data of the genomes of two virus samples, Alp 8 and Alp 9, from an alpaca that died in the Montagu district in the western Cape identified Alp 9 as a definite new serotype of EHDV and Alp 8 as a possible new serotype of BTV most closely related to BTV 15.
