5|$|Because {{germanium}} and gallium <b>arsenide</b> {{have very}} similar lattice constants, germanium substrates {{can be used}} to make gallium <b>arsenide</b> solar cells. The Mars Exploration Rovers and several satellites use triple junction gallium <b>arsenide</b> on germanium cells.|$|E
5|$|Extremely high-purity (99.9999+%) gallium is commercially {{available}} {{to serve the}} semiconductor industry. Gallium <b>arsenide</b> (GaAs) and gallium nitride (GaN) used in electronic components represented about 98% of the gallium consumption in the United States in 2007. About 66% of semiconductor gallium {{is used in the}} U.S. in integrated circuits (mostly gallium <b>arsenide),</b> such as the manufacture of ultra-high speed logic chips and MESFETs for low-noise microwave preamplifiers in cell phones. About 20% of this gallium is used in optoelectronics. Worldwide, gallium <b>arsenide</b> makes up 95% of the annual global gallium consumption.|$|E
5|$|Gallium <b>arsenide</b> {{is used in}} {{a variety}} of {{optoelectronic}} infrared devices. Aluminium gallium <b>arsenide</b> (AlGaAs) is used in high-power infrared laser diodes. The semiconductors gallium nitride and indium gallium nitride are used in blue and violet optoelectronic devices, mostly laser diodes and light-emitting diodes. For example, gallium nitride 405nm diode lasers are used as a violet light source for higher-density Blu-ray Disc compact data disc drives.|$|E

While the undoped FeTe {{has the same}} Fermi surface nested at (π,π) as in Fe <b>arsenides,</b> doping by ∼ 0. 5 electrons reveals a novel square [...] type Fermi surface showing a strong (π, 0) nesting and leading to a different magnetic structure. Our result strongly supports the same mechanism of superconductivity in chalcogenides as in the <b>arsenides,</b> reconciling theory to existing experiments.

5|$|As such, {{they have}} to be made by {{reacting}} alkylmercury compounds with sodium or potassium metal in inert hydrocarbon solvents. While methylsodium forms tetramers like methyllithium, methylpotassium is more ionic and has the nickel <b>arsenide</b> structure with discrete methyl anions and potassium cations.|$|E
5|$|Gallium is {{predominantly}} used in electronics. Gallium <b>arsenide,</b> the primary chemical compound of gallium in electronics, {{is used in}} microwave circuits, high-speed switching circuits, and infrared circuits. Semiconductive gallium nitride and indium gallium nitride produce blue and violet light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and diode lasers. Gallium is also used {{in the production of}} artificial gadolinium gallium garnet for jewelry.|$|E
5|$|In {{synthetic}} diamond {{grown by}} the high-pressure high-temperature synthesis or chemical vapor deposition, defects with symmetry lower than tetrahedral align to {{the direction of}} the growth.

5|$|All the {{alkali metals}} react readily with {{phosphorus}} and arsenic to form phosphides and <b>arsenides</b> with the formula M3Pn (where M represents an alkali metal and Pn represents a pnictogen – phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, or bismuth). This {{is due to}} the greater size of the P3− and As3− ions, so that less lattice energy needs to be released for the salts to form. These are not the only phosphides and <b>arsenides</b> of the alkali metals: for example, potassium has nine different known phosphides, with formulae K3P, K4P3, K5P4, KP, K4P6, K3P7, K3P11, KP10.3, and KP15. While most metals form <b>arsenides,</b> only the alkali and alkaline earth metals form mostly ionic <b>arsenides.</b> The structure of Na3As is complex with unusually short Na–Na distances of 328–330 pm which are shorter than in sodium metal, and this indicates that even with these electropositive metals the bonding cannot be straightforwardly ionic. Other alkali metal <b>arsenides</b> not conforming to the formula M3As are known, such as LiAs, which has a metallic lustre and electrical conductivity indicating the presence of some metallic bonding. The antimonides are unstable and reactive as the Sb3− ion is a strong reducing agent; reaction of them with acids form the toxic and unstable gas stibine (SbH3). Indeed, they have some metallic properties, and the alkali metal antimonides of stoichiometry MSb involve antimony atoms bonded in a spiral Zintl structure. Bismuthides are not even wholly ionic; they are intermetallic compounds containing partially metallic and partially ionic bonds.|$|R

The small screen reduced the power consumption and material costs, but it was revised several times in pursuit of lower power consumption, creating issues with the reliability.|$|E
5|$|From its {{discovery}} in 1875 until {{the era of}} semiconductors, the primary uses of gallium were high-temperature thermometrics and metal alloys with unusual properties of stability or ease of melting (some such being liquid at room temperature). The development of gallium <b>arsenide</b> as a direct band gap semiconductor in the 1960s ushered in the most important stage in the applications of gallium.|$|E

The SDW transition temperature in LaFeAs_ 1 -xSb_xO decreases with increasing antimony content, while the superconducting transition temperature in LaFeAs_ 1 -xSb_xO_ 0. 85 F_ 0. 15 initially increases with Sb substitution. 1111 -compounds with samarium instead of lanthanum have a smaller unit cell volume. In these phases, no Sb solubility is observed. There is also no apparent solubility of antimony in the 122 -iron <b>arsenides...</b>|$|R
50|$|The nickel variety, annabergite, {{occurs as}} a light green nickel bloom on nickel <b>arsenides.</b> In {{addition}} iron, magnesium and zinc can also substitute for the cobalt position, creating three other minerals: parasymplesite (Fe), hörnesite (Mg) and köttigite (Zn).|$|R
5|$|All {{elements}} {{in this group}} are metals. The similarity of the metallic radii of cadmium and mercury is an effect of the lanthanide contraction. So, the trend in this group is unlike the trend in group 2, the alkaline earths, where metallic radius increases smoothly {{from top to bottom}} of the group. All three metals have relatively low melting and boiling points, indicating that the metallic bond is relatively weak, with relatively little overlap between the valence band and the conduction band. Thus, zinc is close to the boundary between metallic and metalloid elements, which is usually placed between gallium and germanium, though gallium participates in semi-conductors such as gallium <b>arsenide.</b>|$|E
5|$|Boron, silicon, germanium, {{antimony}} and tellurium, {{as well as}} heavier {{metals and}} metalloids such as Sm, Hg, Tl, Pb, Bi and Se, {{can be found in}} topological insulators. These are alloys or compounds which, at ultracold temperatures or room temperature (depending on their composition), are metallic conductors on their surfaces but insulators through their interiors. Cadmium <b>arsenide</b> Cd3As2, at about 1 K, is a Dirac-semimetal—a bulk electronic analogue of graphene—in which electrons travel effectively as massless particles. These two classes of material are thought to have potential quantum computing applications.|$|E
5|$|Cray had {{intended}} to use gallium <b>arsenide</b> circuitry in the Cray-2, which would not only offer much higher switching speeds but also used less energy and thus ran cooler as well. At the time the Cray-2 was being designed, the state of GaAs manufacturing simply was {{not up to the}} task of supplying a supercomputer. By the mid-1980s, things had changed and Cray decided {{it was the only way}} forward. Given a lack of investment on the part of large chip makers, Cray decided to invest in a GaAs chipmaking startup, GigaBit Logic, and use them as an internal supplier.|$|E

It occurs {{in association with}} magnetite, sphalerite, chalcopyrite, skutterudite, allanite, zoisite, scapolite, titanite, calcite along with numerous other Co-Ni sulfides and <b>arsenides.</b> It was described as early as 1832.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Several transition-metal phosphates, arsenates, and antimonates undergo direct {{reduction}} in hydrogen at relatively low temperatures (400 - 1050 degrees C) to the corresponding phosphides, <b>arsenides,</b> and antimonides, providing a convenient route for {{the synthesis of}} transition-metal pnictides. We have synthesized by this route a variety of binary transition-metal phosphides (MoP, WP, Fe 2 P, Ni 2 P, FeP, RuP), <b>arsenides</b> (NiAs, CoAs), and antimonides (NiSb 2, CoSb 3). We could not however synthesize pnictides of manganese, vanadium, and gallium by this route, suggesting that the method is applicable only to those metals that are less electropositive than hydrogen, that is, those metals whose binary oxides are reducible by hydrogen to the metallic state...|$|R

5|$|In medieval Germany, a red mineral {{was found}} in the Erzgebirge (Ore Mountains) that resembled copper ore. However, when miners were unable to extract any copper from it, they blamed a mischievous sprite of German mythology, Nickel (similar to Old Nick), for besetting the copper. They called this ore Kupfernickel from the German Kupfer for copper. This ore is now known to be nickeline (aka niccolite), a nickel <b>arsenide.</b> In 1751, Baron Axel Fredrik Cronstedt tried to extract copper from {{kupfernickel}} at a cobalt mine in the Swedish village of Los, and instead produced a white metal that he named after the spirit that had given its name to the mineral, nickel. In modern German, Kupfernickel or Kupfer-Nickel designates the alloy cupronickel.|$|E
5|$|Polonium has {{no common}} {{compounds}}, {{and almost all}} of its compounds are synthetically created; more than 50 of those are known. The most stable class of polonium compounds are polonides, which are prepared by direct reaction of two elements. Na2Po has the antifluorite structure, the polonides of Ca, Ba, Hg, Pb and lanthanides form a NaCl lattice, BePo and CdPo have the wurtzite and MgPo the nickel <b>arsenide</b> structure. Most polonides decompose upon heating to about 600°C, except for HgPo that decomposes at ~300°C and the lanthanide polonides, which do not decompose but melt at temperatures above 1000°C. For example, PrPo melts at 1250°C and TmPo at 2200°C. PbPo is {{one of the very few}} naturally occurring polonium compounds, as polonium alpha decays to form lead.|$|E
5|$|Three {{neptunium}} <b>arsenide</b> compounds {{have been}} prepared, NpAs, NpAs2, and Np3As4. The first two were first created by heating arsenic and neptunium hydride in a vacuum-sealed tube {{for about a}} week. Later, NpAs was also made by confining neptunium metal and arsenic in a vacuum tube, separating them with a quartz membrane, and heating them to just below neptunium's melting point of 639°C, which is slightly higher than the arsenic's sublimation point of 615°C. Np3As4 is prepared by a similar procedure using iodine as a transporting agent. NpAs2 crystals are brownish gold and Np3As4 is black. The neptunium antimonide compound NpSb was created in 1971 by placing equal quantities of both elements in a vacuum tube, heating them to the melting point of antimony, and then heating it further to 1000°C for sixteen days. This procedure also created trace amounts of an additional antimonide compound Np3Sb4. One neptunium-bismuth compound, NpBi, has also been reported.|$|E
40|$|Considerations of the {{observed}} bad-metal behavior in Fe-based superconductors led to an early proposal for quantum criticality induced by isoelectronic P for As doping in iron <b>arsenides,</b> which has since been experimentally confirmed. We study here an effective model for the isoelectronically tuned pnictides using a large-N approach. The model contains antiferromagnetic and Ising-nematic order parameters appropriate for J 1 −J 2 exchange-coupled local moments on an Fe square lattice, and a damping caused by coupling to itinerant electrons. The zero-temperature magnetic and Ising transitions are concurrent and essentially continuous. The order-parameter jumps are very small, and are further reduced by the interplane coupling; consequently, quantum criticality occurs over a wide dynamical range. Our results reconcile recent seemingly contradictory experimental observations concerning the quantum phase transition in the P-doped iron <b>arsenides...</b>|$|R

Molybdenum powder is used in circuit board inks. Ruthenium(IV) oxide coated titanium anodes are used for the industrial production of chlorine. Home electrical systems, for the most part, are wired with copper wire for its good conducting properties.
