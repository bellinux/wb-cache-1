40|$|We present {{observations}} of the magnetic field configuration and its transformation in six solar eruptive events that show good agreement with the Hirayama-Shibata model for eruptive flares. The observations arc X-ray images from the Yohkoh Soft X-ray Telescope (SXT) and magnetograms from Kitt Peak National Solar Observatory, interpreted together with the 1 - 8 Angstrom X-ray flux observed by GOES. The observations show: 1. Each event is a magnetic explosion that occurs in an initially closed magnetic bipole in which the core field is sheared and twisted {{in the shape of}} a sigmoid, having an oppositely curved elbow on each end. The arms of the opposite elbows are sheared past each other so that they overlap and are crossed low above the neutral line in the middle of the bipole. 2. Although four of the explosions <b>arc</b> ejective (<b>blow</b> open the bipole) and two are confined (arc arrested within the closed bipole), all six begin the same way. In the SXT iniages, the explosion begins with brightening and expansion of the two elbows together with the appearance of short bright sheared loops low over the neutral line under the crossed arms and, rising up from the crossed arms, long strands connecting the far ends of the elbows. 3. All six events arc single-bipole events in that during the onset and early development of the explosion they show no evidence for reconnection between the exploding bipole and any surrounding magnetic fields. We conclude that in each of our events the magnetic explosion was unleashed by runaway tether-cutting via implosive/explosive rcconnection in the middle of the sigmoid, as in the Hirayama-Shibata model. The similarity of the onsets of the two confined explosions to the onsets of the four ejective explosions and their agreement with the model indicate that runaway reconnection inside a sheared core field can begin whether or not the overlying fields (the envelope field and contiguous fields that press down on the envelope) allow the explosion to be ejective. We consider the implications ofthis for the unleashing of magnetic explosions in field configurations composed of to or more impacted bipoles...|$|R

Magnetic <b>arc</b> <b>blow</b> was studied in this research with the ground position and welding current were varied.

Macro photographs and data {{of the size of the}} weld deposit show magnetic <b>arc</b> <b>blow</b> has strong influence on the size of the weld on the first cut section. This specimen was welded by using 200 Ampere with the ground placed in the starting point of the welding process. Undercut and incomplete penetration are commonly found as discontinuities in all cut sections of the specimens. While porosities occur mainly in the first section with high current. It 2 ̆ 7 s believed that these discontinuities occur due to the lack of shielding by the protective gas caused by very strong <b>arc</b> <b>blow</b> around the melt. Tungsten inclusions are also the common discontinuities to take place, they are found more when welding using high current (200 A).

30|$|<b>Arc</b> <b>blow</b> is a {{phenomenon}} in which the arc tends to become separated {{from the point of}} welding, as though a strong wind were blowing (Naidu et al. 2003). The reason for the occurrence of <b>arc</b> <b>blow</b> is imbalance in the magnetic field surrounding the workpiece (Gerbec 2009). Generally, this phenomenon occurs in three situations: (i) the direction of the current changes, (ii) there are magnetic materials around the welding arc, and (iii) there are magnetic materials {{near the edge of the}} plate (Naidu et al. 2003). <b>Arc</b> <b>blow</b> is generally found only with high DC welding currents. It can be prevented by reducing the current level, by using an AC welding current, and by demagnetizing the fixture (Gerbec 2009). Arc voltage affects arc deflection such that an arc with a lower voltage is shorter and stiffer and has better resistance to deflection than an arc with a higher arc voltage.|$|E
40|$|Oxygen {{plasma arc}} cutting is widely {{employed}} in various industrial fields.

The resulting test pieces were evaluated for parameters that imparted the best clad quality and the results indicate the following: 1) Magnetic steering of the arc reduces dilution and corrosion rate. 2) Magnetic steering of the arc permits use of higher currents for a given dilution level, thus increasing productivity. 3) Clad metal microstructures of a desirable type are obtained when the arc is magnetically steered. 4) Use of 309 L strips for single layer cladding appears to be satisfactory since ferrite content lies between 5 to 10 % for a variety of welding conditions. 5) The corrosion rate (microns per 24 hours) is linearly related to the dilution percentage of the clad metal...|$|E

Due {{to the effect}} of magnetic <b>arc</b> <b>blow,</b> both of the arcs direct towards each other and subsequently act as a single heat source. This heat source is basically a double-ellipsoidal moving heat source that follows Gaussian distribution. It causes melting of the specimen and formation of weld-pool. Numerical simulation of this entire phenomenon is a classical problem based on Gaussian distributed double-ellipsoidal moving heat source with fluid flow driven by Electro Magnetic Force (EMF), buoyancy, surface tension, marangoni stress and gravity.
