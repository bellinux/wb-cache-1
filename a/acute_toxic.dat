5000|$|... "Encephalopathy" [...] is {{a general}} term {{describing}} brain malfunctions and [...] "toxic" [...] asserts that the malfunction is caused by toxins on the brain. The most prominent characteristic of toxic encephalopathy is an altered mental status. Acute intoxication is a reversible symptom of exposure to many synthetic chemical neurotoxicants. Acute intoxication symptoms include lightheadedness, dizziness, headache and nausea, and regular cumulative exposure to these toxic solvents {{over a number of}} years puts the individual at high risk for developing toxic encephalopathy. Chronic exposure to low levels of neurotoxic chemicals can also cause reversible changes in mood and affect which resolve with cessation of exposure. <b>Acute</b> and chronic <b>toxic</b> encephalopathy on the other hand, are persistent changes in neurological function that typically occur with exposure to higher concentrations and longer durations respectively. The symptoms of <b>acute</b> and chronic <b>toxic</b> encephalopathy do not resolve with cessation of exposure and can include memory loss, small personality changes/increased irritability, insidious onset of concentration difficulties, involuntary movements (parkinsonism), fatigue, seizures, arm strength problems, and depression. [...] Neurobehavioral effects of occupational exposure to organic solvents exists among painters. The condition may also be referred to as substance-induced persistent dementia.|$|R

Standardized methodology {{to assess the}} effects of pesticide mixtures under field conditions is lacking. We conducted an experiment on chronic feeding of a diet contaminated with a field-realistic pesticide mixture on free-flying honeybee colonies. Pesticide residues in larvae and adult tagmata were detected in trace amounts. In colonies treated with a pesticide mixture, larval weight was higher and acini diameters of the hypopharyngeal glands of nurse bees were smaller than in the untreated control. Brood termination and adult lifespan did not differ between both groups. Our study offers a reproducible and applicable approach for testing effects of pesticides on bee health. As feeding of a field-realistic pesticide mixture did not elicit <b>acute</b> bee <b>toxic</b> effects, the described differences might be explained by sub-lethal effects or joint action of single compounds...|$|R

40|$|Tenofovir, {{a widely}} {{prescribed}} antiretroviral medication {{for treatment of}} HIV- 1 infection, is infrequently associated with renal dysfunction and biopsy findings of acute tubular necrosis. We examined the clinical and pathological findings in 13 cases of tenofovir nephrotoxicity (7 men and 6 women, mean age of 51. 1 ± 9. 6 years). Patients received tenofovir therapy for a mean of 19. 6 months (range, 3 weeks to 8 years; median 8 months). Nine patients presented with acute kidney injury, and four had mild renal insufficiency with subnephrotic proteinuria. Mean baseline serum creatinine was 1. 3 ± 0. 3 [*]mg/dl, reaching 5. 7 ± 4. 0 [*]mg/dl {{at the time of}} biopsy, with mean proteinuria of 1. 6 ± 0. 3 [*]g/day.

Renal biopsy revealed <b>toxic</b> <b>acute</b> tubular necrosis, with distinctive proximal tubular eosinophilic inclusions representing giant mitochondria visible by light microscopy. Electron microscopy showed mitochondrial enlargement, depletion, and dysmorphic changes. Clinical follow-up after tenofovir discontinuation was available for 11 of 13 patients (mean duration 13. 6 months).
