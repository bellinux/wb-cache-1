5|$|Then a rule {{change is}} announced, {{allowing}} the tributes {{from the same}} district to win as a couple. Katniss finds and nurses <b>a</b> <b>seriously</b> wounded Peeta, while continuing to act {{the part of a}} girl in love to gain gifts. When the Gamemakers announce that what each contestant needs most will be provided at a feast, Katniss risks her life to obtain medicine for Peeta. She is pinned to the ground by Clove, who gloats about Rue while toying with the helpless Katniss. That talk costs Clove her life, however; Thresh, the male District 11 tribute, kills her, but spares Katniss - once - for Rue's sake. The medicine saves Peeta's life.|$|E
5|$|When the RUC {{arrived at}} the site they found five dead bodies, <b>a</b> <b>seriously</b> injured Stephen Travers, body parts, the {{smouldering}} remains of the destroyed minibus, debris from the bomb blast, bullets, spent cartridges, and the band members' personal possessions, including clothing, shoes, and {{a photograph of the}} group, strewn across the area. They also discovered a stolen white Ford Escort registration number 4933 LZ, which had been left behind by the gunmen, along with two guns, ammunition, green UDR berets and a pair of glasses later traced to James McDowell, the gunman who had ordered the shootings.|$|E
5|$|In {{the absence}} of officially {{recognized}} diagnostic criteria, and beyond the ambit of the discourse on a broader set of criteria discussed above, the term attachment disorder has been increasingly used by some clinicians {{to refer to a}} broader set of children whose behavior may be affected by lack of a primary attachment figure, <b>a</b> <b>seriously</b> unhealthy attachment relationship with a primary caregiver, or a disrupted attachment relationship. Although there are no studies examining diagnostic accuracy, concern is expressed as to the potential for over-diagnosis based on broad checklists and 'snapshots'. This form of therapy, including diagnosis and accompanying parenting techniques, is scientifically unvalidated and is not considered to be part of mainstream psychology or, despite its name, to be based on attachment theory, with which it is considered incompatible. It has been described as potentially abusive and a pseudoscientific intervention, that has resulted in tragic outcomes for children.|$|E

5|$|Such eliminativists have {{developed}} different arguments {{to show that}} folk psychology is <b>a</b> <b>seriously</b> mistaken theory {{and needs to be}} abolished. They argue that folk psychology excludes from its purview or has traditionally been mistaken about many important mental phenomena that can, and are, being examined and explained by modern neurosciences. Some examples are dreaming, consciousness, mental disorders, learning processes, and memory abilities. Furthermore, they argue, folk psychology's development in the last 2,500 years has not been significant and it is therefore a stagnating theory. The ancient Greeks already had a folk psychology comparable to modern views. But in contrast to this lack of development, the neurosciences are a rapidly progressing science complex that, in their view, can explain many cognitive processes that folk psychology cannot.|$|E
5|$|The {{proposal}} {{to build a}} wind farm, in {{a joint venture between}} United Utilities and Peel Holdings, was announced in 2003. Shortly afterwards a pressure group, The Friends of Scout and Knowle Moor, was formed, and on 9 September 2003 representatives of the group attended a meeting of the Metropolitan Borough of Bury's, Ramsbottom and Tottington Area Board to oppose the plans. At the meeting, the spokesperson for the group said that, although they supported the use of alternative energy, they felt that this was the wrong area. Among the objections were that the scheme was contrary to the Unitary Development Plan and the Green Belt, and would adversely affect common land, open countryside and areas of ecological importance and special landscape value. The group also considered that the proposed development would be out of scale with the landscape, adversely affecting peat, water courses and wildlife, and would have <b>a</b> <b>seriously</b> detrimental visual impact, as well as causing a noise nuisance.|$|E
5|$|The {{column of}} sixteen Spaniards {{retreating}} from Xocorro were ambushed at Guaxeregui and killed to a man. The only {{survivor of the}} expedition was <b>a</b> <b>seriously</b> wounded African slave. The reinforcements sent from Comayagua to the Peñol were also attacked in Cares, and had to fight their way through to join the Spanish at the Peñol, suffering considerable hardship. The citizens of Santa María de Comayagua appealed to Montejo for help, and he sent a dozen mixed cavalry and infantry, who managed {{to break through the}} hostile natives encircling the settlement, and reinforce the town, where they were cut off from further Spanish assistance. Montejo was left with only eleven soldiers, and returned to Gracias a Dios to protect the colonists there, who included women and children. The Indians killed isolated Spaniards wherever they could find them. The natives, seeing the success of their fortress at Cerquín, started construction of a similar fortress near Gracias a Dios, and gathered a great quantity of supplies in storehouses there. Montejo urgently needed to halt their progress, but was unable to attack directly. Instead, he sent an African servant who managed to set the storehouses ablaze. The dismayed Indians of that district then sued for peace. A local Indian ruler called Mota plotted to attack Gracias a Dios, but the plan was betrayed to Monetejo. In a lighning raid, Mota was seized and taken back to Gracias as a prisoner, only to escape and resume his plans for an assault. Montejo eventually discovered his hiding place and launched another rapid raid, and kept him hostage in Gracias under close guard as guarantor of his people, thus defusing the immediate threat against Gracias a Dios.|$|E

Newcomer) then flew on to Byrd Station to pick up Kuperov, while the other stood by in Christchurch. The total distance flown during this rescue mission was just under 13000 miles.|$|E
25|$|In the north, Montgomery's {{intelligence}} staff {{preparing for}} Operation Plunder estimated that their million-plus troops faced <b>a</b> <b>seriously</b> weakened Army Group H comprising about 85,000 troops and 35 tanks, {{but the actual}} numbers were likely much less. Army Group B commanded 27 seriously weakened divisions under the 5th Panzer Army (without significant armor), the 7th Army, and 15th Army, but many of its forces had been sent south to help contain the Remagen bridgehead, which made the other crossings during Operation Plunder in late March easier.|$|E

25|$|Andrew Skolnick {{describes}} Maharishi Yagyas as Hindu ceremonies {{to appease}} the gods and beseech their help on behalf of afflicted followers that can cost {{tens of thousands of}} dollars, and which the patient neither takes part in nor witnesses. He wrote that, while Chopra and Nancy Lonsdorf, medical director of the Maharishi Ayur-Veda Center in Washington, D.C. denied that they prescribed yagyas or that yagyas were part of Maharishi Ayur-Veda, Chopra's Lancaster Center did recommend yagyas for its patients, and a TM-Movement fundraising letter states that Lonsdorf prescribed an $11,500 yagya for <b>a</b> <b>seriously</b> ill patient of hers.|$|E
25|$|Although cleverer {{than the}} Prince, Baldrick, knowing {{his place in}} the medieval pecking-order, holds him in awe. He often leads cheers in the Prince's honour (along with Lord Percy, who tries hard to join in), fills his head with illusions of grandeur, and often ends up doing his dirty work. This {{included}} carrying the decapitated body of Richard III and sleeping with the Spanish Infanta, Edmund's fiancée, making her unchaste in hopes that this would prevent the marriage. The latter task resulted in several injuries, including <b>a</b> <b>seriously</b> blackened eye. When Baldrick is abandoned by Edmund in the final episode, a tear falls from his eye.|$|E

25|$|Skolt Sami {{is spoken}} by {{approximately}} 400 {{people by the}} government {{as one of the}} official Sami languages used in Lapland and can thus be used by anyone conducting official business in that area. It is an official language in the municipality of Inari, and elementary schools there offer courses in the language, both for native speakers and for students learning it as a foreign language. Only a small number of youths do learn the language and continue to use it actively. Skolt Sami is thus <b>a</b> <b>seriously</b> endangered language, even more seriously than Inari Sami in the same municipality, which has a nearly equal number of speakers.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{the first}} film, the plot does {{not focus on}} the series' ongoing {{extraterrestrial}} based mytharc themes, but instead works as a standalone thriller horror story, similar {{to many of the}} monster-of-the-week episodes that were frequently seen in the TV series. The story follows Mulder and Scully who have been out of the FBI for several years, with Mulder living in isolation as a fugitive from the organization and Scully having become a doctor at a Catholic-run hospital, where she has formed a friendly relationship with <b>a</b> <b>seriously</b> ill patient. When an FBI agent is mysteriously kidnapped, and a former priest who has been convicted of being a child molester claims to be experiencing psychic visions of the endangered agent, Mulder and Scully reluctantly accept the FBI's request for their particular paranormal expertise on the case.|$|E
