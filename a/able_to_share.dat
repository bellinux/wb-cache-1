5|$|In Zürich, Vermigli succeeded Konrad Pellikan as {{the chair}} of Hebrew, a {{position}} he would hold until his death. He married his second wife, Catarina Merenda of Brescia, Italy, in 1559.

5|$|Pied currawongs are {{generally}} tree-dwelling, hunting and foraging some metres above the ground, and thus <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>share</b> territory with the ground-foraging Australian magpie. Birds roost in forested areas or large trees at night, disperse to forage {{in the early}} morning and return in the late afternoon. Although often solitary or encountered in small groups, the species may form larger flocks of fifty or more birds in autumn and winter. On the ground, a pied currawong hops or struts.|$|E

5|$|Within the verse, Coleridge {{seeks to}} {{discover}} the environment that his friends are exploring because {{he is unable to}} join them. The poem links the lime-tree bower to the Quantocks where the Wordsworths, Lamb and Fricker were out walking. Although he is separated from them, the poet connects to his distant friends and they are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>share</b> in a common view on life. The poem describes Coleridge's loneliness and solitude throughout, yet he is glad that his friends are able to experience nature. Because of this, he is able to tolerate his prison, which he views as merely physical rather than intellectual.|$|E
5|$|Chi's {{character}} is voiced by Rie Tanaka, and Georgette Rose in its English counterpart. The anime and manga storylines are essentially the same, but they differ slightly. These differences include {{the events in}} the ending, other things such as describing Elda's memory loss, and her special program. In the anime for example, it is explained that Hibiya reset Elda's memories after her husband's death rather than Elda losing them when she took Freya's program in. Another difference is the special program that was placed into Elda in the anime, this program appears to have an alternate effect. If Chi finds the Person just for her, all persocoms would be granted the ability to feel emotion. The reason for this is since Ichiro Mihara was the creator of persocoms, he viewed them all as his children. His wish was that if Chi were able to find someone who loved her in return, all his children would be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>share</b> in this happiness by being able to feel emotions the way humans do.|$|E
5|$|Obstacles for the {{proposal}} include the proposed Cross-Harbor Rail Tunnel, {{the lack of}} electrification on the line, and the single-tracking {{in some parts of}} the line. The current iteration of the plan would have its northern terminus be Co-Op City South using the Hells Gate Branch. The LIRR Bay Ridge Branch and the New York Connecting Railroad have freight operating along them, and are regulated by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA). FRA rules require a certain distance between freight and passenger trains that share rights-of-way, and as a result it is uncertain whether the right-of-way is wide enough or if more durable train cars are needed to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>share</b> the same tracks. The RPA's 2015 plan considered having FRA compliant light rail vehicles run over the line. In addition to providing transfer opportunities, the line would provide transit access to areas without it in Glendale and Middle Village in Queens, and in Flatlands and Canarsie in Brooklyn.|$|E

5|$|On June 19, 2013, Microsoft {{announced}} (in {{response to}} the negative reaction) that it would reverse its changes to Xbox One's DRM and game licensing model. As with Xbox 360, users would be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>share</b> and resell physical games without restrictions, and beyond a mandatory software update upon the console's initial setup process to enable playback of Blu-ray and DVD video, the console would not require a permanent internet connection to operate. These changes required the family sharing features, along {{with the ability to}} play games without their disc after installation, to be dropped. Xbox One chief product officer Marc Whitten stated that the family sharing feature may return in the future, but could not be implemented on launch due to time restraints. Don Mattrick, the then president of Microsoft's Interactive Entertainment Business, stated that the licensing changes were in {{response to the}} negative public reaction. Other analysts believed that the change was in direct response of Sony's aggressive position during its E3 press conference. Mattrick, who had been a leader in Xbox One development, announced his departure from Microsoft on July 1, 2013, to become CEO of Zynga. Analysts speculated that his departure was predicated on the poor response and subsequent reversal of the plans for Xbox One.|$|E

Through P2P networks users are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>share</b> their intellectual property {{in a way that}} can benefit society as a whole.The sharing of intellectual property ultimately relates to economic growth due to the ability for creators to share information and still possibly benefit financially from it. Through P2P networks people are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>share</b> types of education like scholarly articles, becoming a new form of public commons.

Therefore, the larger Ted.com network becomes positively correlates to those who benefit from its common-pool resources.|$|E
