5|$|Torres {{sings the}} second verse, telling Selena {{that he will}} wait for her, {{reasoning}} that he likes having an illusion and believing that she loves him. He then tells her he does not care how long he has to wait. Selena replies, telling him how beautiful his responses are, which makes her feel she is falling in love. Selena states that she stops herself from making <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>that</b> could hurt her. Torres and Selena repeat the song's chorus before the song concludes.|$|E
5|$|Hakim {{screened}} {{her first}} {{work as a}} producer, Daun di Atas Bantal (Leaf on a Pillow) during Un Certain Regard at Cannes ten years later. When producing the film, she chose young director Garin Nugroho, whom she perceived to be highly talented; she also took the leading role. During production, she made <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>that</b> required the reshooting of all footage. In an attempt to cut expenses, she had saved all cans of exposed film to send to the developing lab at once; the lab then notified her that a technical fault with the camera had rendered all of it unusable and that the problem could have been detected earlier had she sent each can as it was filmed.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, alien time {{traveller}} the Doctor (Christopher Eccleston) and {{his companion}} Rose Tyler (Billie Piper), having {{been joined by}} near-future genius Adam Mitchell (Bruno Langley), land on Satellite 5 in the year 200,000. Satellite 5 is a space station that broadcasts news across the entire human empire. However, the Doctor notices that the station is suspicious: there are no aliens, {{and those who are}} promoted to Floor 500 seem to disappear. The Doctor and Rose discover that the Editor (Simon Pegg) and an alien are controlling the rest of humanity by way of the press. Meanwhile, Adam makes <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>that</b> forces the Doctor and Rose to take him home.|$|E

5|$|Having been {{promoted}} {{weeks after the}} end of the previous season and not being granted an increased wage budget, Smith felt he had a tough job in keeping Sunderland in the top flight in 1990–91. He allowed Gates and MacPhail to leave on free transfers in order to free up money to bring in new players. He spent £350,000 on Portsmouth defender Kevin Ball and took midfielder Peter Davenport from rivals Middlesbrough; Ball would prove to be a success, though Smith admitted in his autobiography that signing Davenport had been <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>that</b> left him unable to bring in any further players, as his small budget was spent. He was given further funds in February 1991 as Sunderland were engaged in a relegation battle, and Smith spent £225,000 on midfielder Brian Mooney, who had a limited impact due to injuries. On the final day of the season Sunderland had to better Luton Town's result at home to Derby in their match against Manchester City at Maine Road, but they lost 3–2 and were relegated back into the Second Division.|$|E
5|$|On 22 August 2007, Robinson made <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>that</b> {{resulted}} in Germany scoring their first {{goal of the}} match. England lost the match 2–1 for their first loss at the new Wembley Stadium. He was substituted at half-time and replaced by David James, although then England manager Steve McClaren {{said he planned to}} make this substitution before the match. Despite this error, Robinson was still the number one goalkeeper, featuring in four further European Championship qualifiers, and keeping a clean sheet in three of them. He made another mistake, however, in a 2–1 defeat against Russia: Robinson palmed a shot into the path of Russian forward Roman Pavlyuchenko's path, resulting in the striker scoring Russia's winning goal. As a result, McClaren dropped Robinson for the final qualifying match against Croatia in November, replacing him with Scott Carson. England failed to qualify for the Euro 2008 finals as they lost 3–2 in their final match against Croatia; Carson made an error from a Niko Kranjčar shot for the first goal.|$|E
5|$|After making <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>that</b> led to York conceding a goal late on in a 1–1 {{draw away}} to Forest Green on 26 November 2011, he was {{replaced}} in the line-up by McGurk {{for the next}} match at home to Lincoln three days later. This {{was the start of}} a second extended spell out of the team for Smith that season, before returning to play as a defensive midfielder in a 3–5–2 formation for York's FA Trophy first-round replay away to Solihull Moors on 13 December 2011. He scored his first goal of the season in the 11th minute of this match, converting Scott Kerr's cross at the far post, with York going on to win 3–0. However, he returned to the bench for the subsequent league match against Kidderminster on 19 December 2011, with York reverting to their usual 4–3–3 formation. With York reverting to 3–5–2 for a 1–1 draw away to Mansfield on 26 December 2011, Smith returned as a defensive midfielder, but after picking up his fifth yellow card of the season was suspended for the reverse fixture at home to Mansfield on 1 January 2012. Smith captained York to victory in the 2012 FA Trophy Final at Wembley Stadium on 12 May 2012, with Newport County being beaten 2–0. This was the first time York had won a national knockout competition. Eight days later, he captained York to a 2–1 victory over Luton in the 2012 Conference Premier play-off Final at Wembley Stadium, meaning the club regained Football League status after eight years with promotion to League Two.|$|E

25|$|On June 21, 1863 he is breveted {{lieutenant}} colonel for gallant and meritorius service in action at Upperville, Virginia. Starr commands the Cavalry Reserve Brigade briefly. He assumed {{he would be}} promoted but his older age and reputation denied him continued command. Many felt his old school discipline, attitude and the rapidly changing venue of the Union cavalry was beyond him. Remarkably he held his tongue while fuming in outrage but soldiered on. Then on July 2, 1863 for gallant and meritorius service in the Gettysburg Campaign he is breveted to colonel. However his new commander quickly makes <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>that</b> would be costly to Starr and the 6th Cavalry.|$|E

25|$|Over {{four years}} later, Light {{is able to}} garner most of the world's support, {{reaching}} the point where his followers have begun to worship Kira as a literal deity. But two young men, Mello and Near, both raised as potential successors to L begin to separately investigate the case that took the life of their predecessor. Near heads the SPK (Special Provision for Kira), an American investigation team composed of CIA and FBI agents, while Mello teams up with the Mafia. Although Mello dies working separate from Near, his actions lead Teru Mikami, a man selected by Light to kill criminals using another Death Note, to make <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>that</b> results in Light's capture by Near, the SPK and Japanese police. Seeing that Light has finally lost, he is killed when Ryuk writes his name in his own Death Note, just as the Shinigami had warned when they first met.|$|E
25|$|Intimidatory or {{aggressive}} bowling {{is a legitimate}} tactic of bowling {{with the intent of}} hitting the batsman with the ball. This is somewhat restrained by some of the laws of cricket, including those that disallow excessive use of bouncers and any use of the beamer, which is aimed directly at the head on the full. Successful intimidatory bowling usually employs a mixture of bouncers and short-pitched deliveries aimed at the batsman's head, chest, and rib cage. The intention is to disrupt a batsman's focus, and ultimately induce <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>that</b> leads to the loss of the batsman's wicket. Often the eventual wicket will not fall to a bouncer or short-pitched ball, but instead to a more standard delivery that the batsman is no longer expecting, or is rendered temporarily unable to play in his usual way (by fear, pain, surprise, or some combination of the three).|$|E
25|$|New Zealand won the toss {{and elected}} to bat, {{immediately}} demonstrating a reshuffling of their batting order, with Guptill facing the first ball from Anderson, presumably to protect Ronchi, who fell so {{quickly in the}} previous match. However, Ronchi was soon on strike and just as soon {{on his way back}} to the pavilion, Anderson clean-bowling him with the last ball of the third over. Guptill was almost out himself on 13 in the 10th over, but his low pull shot was dropped by Trott at midwicket. It was <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>that</b> would prove costly for England, as Guptill went on to put on successive 100-run stands for the second and third wickets with Williamson (55) and Taylor (60) on his way to a New Zealand record 189 not out off 155 balls. Captain Brendon McCullum put on 40 runs himself to close out New Zealand's 50 overs with the team on 359/3.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by John Swartzwelder and {{directed}} by Mark Ervin.

500|$|Some critics {{compared}} the storyline {{to the five}} stages of grief, a theory introduced by Elisabeth Kübler-Ross. Alex Panisch of Out opined that the first five tracks [...] "document the five stages of a relationship turning sour: good times, doubt, breaking up, coping, and still being hung up". Critics also noted that, unlike other artists' break up records, the singer admits in Truth Serum {{that she was the}} person who made <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>that</b> ended the relationship. Panisch commented that; [...] "When female artists sing about breakups [...] they almost overwhelmingly write themselves in the position of the wronged party and their songs are about recovering and strengthening from the experience. [...] Tove Lo flips the script on this narrative". Shanon Carlin of Radio.com stated that the singer [...] "doesn't try and capitalize off her heartbreak by writing a female empowerment anthem that shames the guy who did her wrong. No, on this album, Lo is not an innocent. It's actually quite the opposite".|$|E
