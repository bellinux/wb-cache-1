40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of the literature on intraday credit in payment systems to date and explores the dilemma central banks face when deciding on their intraday credit policies. On the one hand, any strategy in which the costs of liquidity are not fully borne by payment system participants can be expected to yield an inefficient outcome. Participants would consume more credit than optimal and, due to moral hazard, central banks would be faced with larger <b>amounts</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> and a greater risk of default than would otherwise be the case. On the other hand, a strategy making intraday liquidity expensive increases the risk of payment delays and payment system gridlocks, due to participants limiting their intraday borrowings and delaying the sending of payments, which can hamper the well functioning of the payment system. This could further influence the allocation of real resources, as achieving economic efficiency requires intraday credit to be provided without cost, even accounting for default risk and moral hazard. Recent developments in payment system design, which have improved the turnover ratio of reserves, have reduced the stringency of the dilemma in a number of countries. large-value payment system; intraday credit; liquidity. ...|$|R

40|$|Climate {{change may}} {{potentially}} increase {{the magnitude of}} losses from natural hazards, but the United States experience shows that {{the primary reason for}} escalating losses is policy failure. It is well known that centralised, taxpayer-funded ex post disaster relief has actually encouraged development in risky jurisdictions and also weakened incentives for ex ante precautions in such jurisdictions (moral or “charity ” hazard). Less well known and analysed is the role played by centralised ex ante development subsidies—often masquerading as protective investment—in distorting incentives. This paper develops a simple three jurisdiction model in which homogeneous jurisdictions decide by majority vote in a centralised legislature on the centralised (federal) share of ex post loss and centralised spending an ex ante development in a Beneficiary jurisdiction, taking into account how these decisions about centralised spending impact local Beneficiary jurisdiction incentives for precautions against ex post loss. The model shows that the marginal cost of ex ante federal development spending may be greater for a Beneficiary jurisdiction than for a Contractor jurisdiction. This somewhat technical result has an observable implication: evidence that a small fraction of ex post loss in a Beneficiary jurisdiction is centrally compensated (shared across jurisdictions) is evidence that ex ante development subsidies there may be truly precautionary on net; conversely, evidence that a Beneficiary jurisdiction has a large share of its ex post hazard loss compensated by centralised disaster relief suggests that the ex ante development subsidies received by that jurisdiction did more to encourage new development and increase the <b>amount</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> than they did to protect existing development. The model is extended to consider how ex post loss sharing impacts the demand for federally subsidised disaster insurance and other related issues...|$|E

Stratification of IMI patients by the <b>amount</b> of myocardium <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> and the time to treatment should clarify the precise indications for thrombolytic therapy. This study is an independent secondary analysis of the TIMI II patient data available through the NHLBI. Clinical features were used to identify IMI subgroups in the TIMI II trial characterized by increased myocardium <b>at</b> <b>risk.</b> There were 861 patients with IMI who had {{one or more of}} the following markers for myocardium at risk: anterior ST depression, hypotension defined as a systolic blood pressure < 100 mmHg, or advanced AV block. There were 455 patients with IMI who did not have any markers of increased myocardium <b>at</b> <b>risk.</b> The subgroups for each marker and the group without any marker were then stratified by time to thrombolysis and their outcomes were compared to historical controls with hypothesis tests and confidence intervals. Patients with IMI plus anterior ST depression, hypotension, or AV block who received thrombolysis had a highly statistically significant decre, 1 se in mortality (p< 0. 001) compared to historical controls. Patients with IMI plus hypotension or AV block had a significant decrease in mortality only up to 3 hours from onset of symptoms (p< 0. 05). In patients with simple 1 MI, an insignificant relative reduction in mortality of 15. 4 % was seen from a baseline mortality of 2. 5 %. Consequently, thrombolytic therapy cannot be justified for all patients with IMI, but it is clearly indicated for IMI with anterior ST depression, advanced AV block, and hypotension. The decrease in mortality for patients with hypotension or AV block declines steeply over the first 3 hours. IMI with anterior or lateral ST elevation, right ventricular infarction, or new bundle-branch block is hypothesized to have the same benefit but could not be tested because the data was not available in the TIMI II database. To demonstrate significance of the relative reduction in mortality for patients with simple IMI would require 32, 220 patients. For the individual patient with a simple inferior myocardial infarction, the essentially immaterial benefit of 15. 4 % relative reduction in mortality from a baseline mortality of 2. 5 % may not outweigh the risk of a hemorrhagic complication of therapy. In conclusion, IMI patients should be considered on an individual basis, with consideration given to the <b>amount</b> of myocardium <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> and the time to treatment...|$|R

The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} non-invasively whether chest pain severity is predictive of the <b>amount</b> of myocardium <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> and whether the response of pain during thrombolysis is associated with myocardial salvage during acute myocardial infarction. Background. The perception of chest pain and response to reperfusion therapy during acute myocardial infarction may provide important information for treatment benefit. Previous studies have been limited by the inability to measure myocardium <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> and myocardial salvage. Methods. Sixty-two patients with acute myocardial infarction received an injection of technetium- 99 m sestamibi before thrombolysis and again at hospital discharge. Tomographic imaging was performed 1 to 6 h later. Myocardium <b>at</b> <b>risk,</b> infarct size and absolute myocardial salvage were derived from these images using previously described techniques and were expressed as a percent of the left ventricle. Salvage index was calculated by dividing myocardial salvage by the myocardium <b>at</b> <b>risk.</b> Chest pain severity was graded before thrombolysis as none, mild, moderate or severe. Chest pain response during thrombolytic therapy was graded as none, partial or completely resolved. Results. There was no association between chest pain severity and myocardium <b>at</b> <b>risk,</b> but there was a weak trend toward greater myocardial salvage and salvage index (p = 0. 09 and p = 0. 12, respectively) for patients with more severe symptoms. Patients without chest pain at the start of thrombolysis still demonstrated significant salvage (11 ± 11 % of the left ventricle, p = 0. 009). There was a significant association between chest pain response to therapy and both myocardial salvage (p = 0. 03) and salvage index (p = 0. 01). By multivariate analysis, chest pain severity and response of chest pain during thrombolysis were significant independent predictors of myocardial salvage, salvage index and infarct size. Thrombolysis was most effective in the 20 patients (32 %) with moderate or severe chest pain and complete resolution of symptoms during thrombolysis (salvage of 79 % to 89 % of the area <b>at</b> <b>risk).</b> In the remaining 32 patients with chest pain, salvage of the area <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> was only 32 %.

In the Lower Valley (Socorro, Clint, and San Elizario) area of El Paso County (TX), there has been a rapid growth in population. This increase in growth has led to this project about the types of pesticides used in farms and if they are creating possible health risks for people living in this area and which populations are most <b>at</b> <b>risk.</b> To determine population risk, I use existing GIS information, specifically a USDA aerial photograph taken when crops were at full leaf, US Bureau of the Census data from 2000, and data regarding pesticide usage and crop growth gathered by myself to analyze, compare, and assess possible health risks from living, or attending school, near farm fields. I focus on five pesticides commonly used on local crops (e. g., cotton, pecans, and chiles) and the level of danger that they present to the surrounding population. In regards to the defoliant Defol 750 used on chile, the populations that are mostly <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> are Hispanics and people who are 65 years of age and over. When looking at the insecticides Lorsban 4 E and Whirlwind, the populations that are most affected are non Hispanic Whites, renters, and adults 18 to 64 years of age. In regards to Roundup ProMax herbicide and Trimax Pro insecticides, the populations that are most <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> are non Hispanic Whites, renters, and adults 18 to 64 years of age. In terms of schools, nine schools are located within 300 feet of the nearest farm field, putting students and school staff <b>at</b> <b>risk.</b> We can see that there is an overall significant pattern of increased risk in regards to populations that are non Hispanic Whites, adults, and renters, as well as to schools that surround farmlands. In sum, there are a substantial <b>amount</b> of people <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> due to the proximity of farms that use pesticides to homes and schools in the Lower Valley. ...|$|R
