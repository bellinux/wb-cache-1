Methods: Thirty-two 12 -week-old healthy female Sprague Dawley rats were randomly allocated into four groups: 1) control (saline, daily); 2) dexamethasone (2 mg/kg, twice weekly); 3) celecoxib (50 mg/kg, daily); and 4) methotrexate (0. 5 mg/kg, twice weekly). The drugs were administered to the rats for 12 weeks and the animals were weighed on a weekly basis. The femurs and lumbar vertebrae were harvested for bone mineral density and bone mechanical properties analyses. The proximal tibiae were processed for bone histomorphometry and micro-computed tomography analyses. Results: The following results were obtained: 1) dexamethasone strongly inhibited bone formation rate accompanied with a decrease in bone mineral density and bone biomechanical properties; 2) celecoxib stimulated bone resorption, leading to a decrease of bone mass and femur biomechanic properties; and 3) methotrexate caused bone loss and bone quality deterioration to a lesser extent due to the increase of the bone turnover rate on the proximal tibial metaphysis of the rats. Conclusion: This study provides a comparative profile of {{the long-term effects of}} clinical doses of celecoxib, methotrexate, and dexamethasone on intact skeletons of the rats. The results indicate that the three <b>antiarthritics</b> have varying degrees of side effects on bone metabolism, and these findings will help physicians {{to learn more about the}} potential effects of <b>antiarthritics</b> on bone metabolism.

40|$|Turmeric {{has been}} used for centuries in Ayurvedic {{medicine}} as a treatment for inflammatory disorders including arthritis. On the basis of this traditional usage, dietary supplements containing turmeric rhizome and turmeric extracts are also being used in the western world for arthritis treatment and prevention. However, to our knowledge, no data are available regarding <b>antiarthritic</b> efficacy of complex turmeric extracts similar in composition to those available for use as dietary supplements. Therefore, the studies described here were undertaken to determine the in vivo efficacy of well-characterized curcuminoid-containing turmeric extracts in the prevention or treatment of arthritis using streptococcal cell wall (SCW) induced arthritis, a well-described animal model of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Arthritic index, a clinical measure of joint swelling, was used as the primary endpoint for assessing the effect of extracts on joint inflammation. An essential oil-depleted turmeric fraction containing 41 % of the three major curcuminoids was efficacious in preventing joint inflammation when treatment was started before, but not after, the onset of joint inflammation.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Selective {{serotonin}} reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), {{in addition}} to their antidepressant effects, have been reported to have antiinflammatory effects. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the <b>antiarthritic</b> potential of 2 SSRIs, fluoxetine and citalopram, in murine collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and in a human ex vivo disease model of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Following therapeutic administration of SSRIs, paw swelling was assessed and clinical scores were determined daily in DBA/ 1 mice with CIA. Joint architecture was examined histologically at the end of the treatment period. Cultures of human RA synovial membranes were treated with SSRIs, and cytokine production was measured. Toll-like receptor (TLR) function was examined in murine and human macrophages, human B cells, and human fibroblast-like synovial cells treated with SSRIs. RESULTS: Both SSRIs significantly inhibited disease progression in mice with CIA, with fluoxetine showing the greatest degree of efficacy at the clinical and histologic levels. In addition, both drugs significantly inhibited the spontaneous production of tumor necrosis factor, interleukin- 6, and interferon-gamma-inducible protein 10 in human RA synovial membrane cultures. Fluoxetine and citalopram treatment also inhibited the signaling of TLRs 3, 7, 8, and 9, providing a potential mechanism for their antiinflammatory action. CONCLUSION: Fluoxetine and citalopram treatment selectively inhibit endosomal TLR signaling, ameliorate disease in CIA, and suppress inflammatory cytokine production in human RA tissue. These data highlight the <b>antiarthritic</b> potential of the SSRI drug family and provide further evidence of the involvement of TLRs in the pathogenesis of RA.

Gait {{analysis was used to}} examine the role of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs in the development of pain. Body weights were also measured to monitor the progression of disease and the systemic <b>antiarthritic</b> effects of the test compounds used in this study, as well as their systemic toxicity. Our results showed that azothioprine (5 mg/kg/day), chloroquine (12. 5 mg/kg/day), sodium aurothiomalate (2. 5 mg/kg/day) and methotrexate (1 mg/kg/week) not only inhibited the macroscopic changes such as erythema and swelling of limbs, but also exhibited significant reversal of gait deficits seen in the untreated or saline-treated arthritic rats. No reduction in the body weights were observed in the arthritic rats treated with azothioprine, chloroquine, sodium aurothiomalate and methotrexate. D-Penicillamine (12. 5 mg/kg/day), however, showed a significant reduction (P < 0. 03) in the body weights of the arthritic rats over a period of 22 days; furthermore, it was unable to show any reduction in arthritic score (P < 0. 1). In earlier experiments, chloroquine and methotrexate failed to suppress carageenan-induced edema, suggesting that the mode of <b>antiarthritic</b> action may be different from those of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents. Since these disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs are reported to have an immunomodulatory role, especially the gold salt, which influences the monocyte–macrophage system, it is suggested that the observed <b>antiarthritic</b> effects of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs may be partly attributed to their immunomodulatory activity...|$|E

Intraperitoneal injections of 7. 5 ml/kg wt ethanol extract showed antiinflammatory activity with 88. 89 % inhibition {{as compared to}} reference drug diclofenac, which showed 94. 44 % inhibition in formalin-induced paw oedema. As formalin-induced paw oedema closely resembles human arthritis, the <b>antiarthritic</b> property of ethanol extract of Hedera helix was also investigated. The visible reduction in arthritic symptoms by extract of Hedera helix suggests {{the potential of the}} plant extract against inflammation and arthritis...|$|E

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic in�ammation of the synovial joints leading to bone and cartilage damage. Untreated in�ammatory arthritis can result in severe deformities and disability. e use of anti-in�ammatory agents and biologics has been themainstay of treatment of RA. However, the prolonged use of such agentsmay lead to severe adverse reactions. In addition, many of these drugs are quite expensive. ese limitations have necessitated the search for newer therapeutic agents for RA. Natural plant products offer a promising resource for potential <b>antiarthritic</b> agents. We describe here the cellular and soluble mediators of in�ammation-induced bone damage (osteoimmunology) in arthritis. We also elaborate upon various herbal products that possess <b>antiarthritic</b> activity, particularly mentioning the speci�c target molecules. As the use of natural product supplements by RA patients is increasing, this paper presents timely and useful information about the mechanism of action of promising herbal products that can inhibit the progression of in�ammation and bone damage {{in the course of}} arthritis. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to assess the <b>antiarthritic</b> potential of ECF in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and explore its underlying mechanism. Methods. In vitro, lymphocyte proliferation assay was measured by CCK- 8 kit. In vivo, the therapeutic potential of ECF on CIA was investigated; surface marker, Treg cell, and intracellular cytokines (IL- 17 A and IFN-γ) were detected by flow cytometry. Th 1 cell differentiation assay was performed, and mRNA expression in interferon-γ-related signaling was examined by q-PCR analysis. Results. In vitro, ECF markedly inhibited the proliferation of splenocytes in response to ConA and anti-CD 3. In vivo, ECF treatment reduced the severity of CIA, inhibited IFN-γ and IL- 6 secretion, and decreased the proportion of CD 11 b+Gr- 1 + splenic neutrophil. Meanwhile, ECF treatment significantly inhibited the IFN-γ expression in CD 4 +T cell without obviously influencing the development of Th 17 cells and T regulatory cells. In vitro, ECF suppressed the differentiation of naive CD 4 + T cells into Th 1. Furthermore, ECF intensely blocked the transcriptional expression in interferon-γ-related signaling, including IFN-γ, T-bet, STAT 1, and STAT 4. Conclusion. Our results indicated that ECF exerted <b>antiarthritic</b> potential in collagen-induced arthritis by suppressing Th 1 immune response and interferon-γ-related signaling...|$|E
