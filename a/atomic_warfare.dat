25|$|The year HUAC began {{investigating}} Hollywood {{is often}} considered {{the beginning of}} the Cold War, as in March 1947, the Truman Doctrine was announced.

The stage was set for Bradbury to write the dramatic nuclear holocaust ending of Fahrenheit 451, exemplifying the type of scenario feared by many Americans of the time.|$|E

An advocate of technological research and development, his tenure saw the development of the intercontinental bomber, the jet fighter, the extensive use of radar, global airlift and <b>atomic</b> <b>warfare</b> as mainstays of modern air power.|$|E
25|$|The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists is a nontechnical online {{magazine}} {{that has been}} published continuously since 1945, when it was founded by former Manhattan Project physicists after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The Bulletins primary aim is {{to inform the public}} about nuclear policy debates while advocating for the international control of nuclear weapons. One of the driving forces behind the creation of the Bulletin was the amount of public interest surrounding atomic energy {{at the dawn of the}} atomic age. In 1945 the public interest in <b>atomic</b> <b>warfare</b> and weaponry inspired contributors to the Bulletin to attempt to inform those interested about the dangers and destruction that atomic war could bring about. In the 1950s, the Bulletin was involved in the formation of the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs, annual conferences of scientists concerned about nuclear proliferation.|$|E

500|$|In 1942, Teller {{was invited}} {{to be part of}} Robert Oppenheimer's summer {{planning}} seminar, at the University of California, Berkeley for the origins of the Manhattan Project, the Allied effort to develop the first nuclear weapons. A few weeks earlier, Teller had been meeting with his friend and colleague Enrico Fermi about the prospects of <b>atomic</b> <b>warfare,</b> and Fermi had nonchalantly suggested that perhaps a weapon based on nuclear fission could be used to set off an even larger nuclear fusion reaction. Even though he initially explained to Fermi why he thought the idea would not work, Teller was fascinated by the possibility and was quickly bored with the idea of [...] "just" [...] an atomic bomb even though this was not yet anywhere near completion. At the Berkeley session, Teller diverted discussion from the fission weapon to the possibility of a fusion weapon—what he called the [...] "Super", an early concept of what was later to be known as a hydrogen bomb.|$|E
500|$|As Bradbury had promised, with {{research}} and development, nuclear weapons became smaller, simpler and lighter. They also became easier to store, assemble, test and maintain. Thus, while under Eisenhower's New Look policy the Armed Forces became more heavily involved with aspects {{of nuclear weapons}} than ever, {{the role of the}} AFSWP diminished. It began moving away from training assembly teams, which were increasingly not required, as its primary mission, and became more involved in the management of the rapidly growing nuclear stockpile, and providing technical advice and logistical support. In 1953, the AFSWP Field Command had 10,250 personnel. On 16 October 1953, the Secretary of Defense charged the AFSWP with responsibility for [...] "a centralized system of reporting and accounting to ensure that the current status and location" [...] of all nuclear weapons [...] "will be known at all times". The <b>Atomic</b> <b>Warfare</b> Status Center was created within the AFSWP to handle this mission.|$|E

The United States' forgoing <b>atomic</b> <b>warfare</b> was not because of [...] "a disinclination by the Soviet Union and People's Republic of China to escalate" [...] the Korean War, but because UN allies—notably from the UK, the Commonwealth, and France—were concerned about a geopolitical imbalance rendering NATO defenseless while the United States fought China, who then might persuade the Soviet Union to conquer Western Europe. The Joint Chiefs of Staff advised Truman to tell Attlee that the United States would use nuclear weapons only if necessary to protect an evacuation of UN troops, or to prevent a [...] "major military disaster".|$|E

2500|$|In 1951, the U.S. {{escalated}} {{closest to}} <b>atomic</b> <b>warfare</b> in Korea. Because China deployed new armies to the Sino-Korean frontier, pit crews at the Kadena Air Base, Okinawa, assembled atomic bombs for Korean warfare, [...] "lacking only the essential pit nuclear cores". In October 1951, the United States effected Operation Hudson Harbor {{to establish a}} nuclear weapons capability. USAF B-29 bombers practised individual bombing runs from Okinawa to North Korea (using dummy nuclear or conventional bombs), coordinated from Yokota Air Base in east-central Japan. Hudson Harbor tested [...] "actual functioning of all activities which {{would be involved in}} an atomic strike, including weapons assembly and testing, leading, ground control of bomb aiming". The bombing run data indicated that atomic bombs would be tactically ineffective against massed infantry, because the [...] "timely identification of large masses of enemy troops was extremely rare." ...|$|E
2500|$|Unlike the Vietnam War, {{in which}} the Soviet Union only officially sent [...] "advisers", in the Korean aerial war Soviet forces participated via the 64th Airborne Corps. Fearful of confronting the United States directly, the Soviet Union denied {{involvement}} of their personnel in anything other than an advisory role, but air combat quickly resulted in Soviet pilots dropping their code signals and speaking over the wireless in Russian. This known direct Soviet participation was a casus belli that the UN Command deliberately overlooked, lest the war for the Korean peninsula expand to include the Soviet Union, and potentially escalate into <b>atomic</b> <b>warfare.</b> 1,106 enemy airplanes were officially downed by the Soviet pilots, 52 of whom got ace status. The Soviet system of confirming air kills erred on the conservative side; the pilot's words had to be corroborated and enemy aircraft falling into the sea were not counted, the number might exceed 1,106.|$|E
