30|$|Anomalous {{union of}} pancreaticobiliary ductal (AUPBD) {{junction}} without congenital choledochal cyst {{is a risk}} factor for hepatobiliary malignancies and is defined as the abnormal junction of the pancreatic duct and common bile duct that occurs outside the duodenal wall to form a long common channel (> 15  mm). Kimura et al. has proposed a classification system for AUPBD where type 1 is defined as the pancreatic duct joined to the common bile duct (as the main duct) and type 2 is defined as the common bile duct joined to the pancreatic duct (as the main duct) [26]. The <b>anomalous</b> <b>junction</b> is also often associated with a choledochal cyst or a biliary tract carcinoma which {{may be due to the}} reflux of activated pancreatic fluid; type 1 abnormalities carry a higher risk of biliary tract and gallbladder malignancies [27].|$|E

Aim: To study {{the frequency of}} K-ras gene mutations in advanced gallbladder carcinoma not associated to <b>anomalous</b> <b>junction</b> of pancreatic-biliary duct (AJPBD). Material and methods: 33 formalin fixed paraffin embedded samples of gallbladder carcinoma (30 women, age range 32 - 86 years) were selected. Pancreatic cancer tissue with K-ras mutations was used as control. DNA was extracted from the histological section by mean of microdissection and K-ras mutations in codon 12 were detected by polymerase chain reaction and {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (RFLP), using previously reported technique. Results: Most cases were poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas. K-ras mutation was detected in 10 cases (30 %) samples. No differences in K-ras mutation frequency between subserous and serous tumors were detected and no relation between histological features and the mutation was observed.

The most accepted classification of various types of anomalous pancreaticobiliary junction is the new Komi classification. The majority of cases of type III anomalous pancreaticobiliary junction are reported from Japan and very seldom from outside Japan. This study evaluates the prevalence of type III anomalous pancreaticobiliary junction in the Indian population. Objective To retrospectively evaluate the prevalence of type III anomalous pancreaticobiliary junction revealed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) examinations carried out between 1985 and 2005. Design ERCP records of 3, 827 patients satisfying inclusion criteria between 1985 and 2005 were retrospectively analyzed. Main outcome measure Patients demonstrating anomalous pancreaticobiliary junction were identified and classified according to the new Komi classification. Results A total of 101 patients had anomalous pancreaticobiliary junction (2. 6 % of all ERCP). Only 2 patients (2. 0 % of all anomalous pancreaticobiliary junction cases and 0. 05 % of all ERCP examinations) had type III anomalous pancreaticobiliary junction. Both cases were associated with choledochal cysts and chronic pancreatitis.

40|$|Rajveer Hundal, Eldon A Shaffer Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada Abstract: Gallbladder cancer, though {{generally}} considered rare, {{is the most}} common malignancy of the biliary tract, accounting for 80 %- 95 % of biliary tract cancers. An early diagnosis is essential as this malignancy progresses silently with a late diagnosis, often proving fatal. Its carcinogenesis follows a progression through a metaplasia-dysplasia-carcinoma sequence. This comprehensive review focuses on and explores the risks, management, and outcomes for primary gallbladder carcinoma. Epidemiological studies have identified striking geographic and ethnic disparities – inordinately high occurrence in American Indians, elevated in Southeast Asia, yet quite low elsewhere in the Americas and the world. Age, female sex, congenital biliary tract anomalies, and a genetic predisposition represent important risk factors that are immutable. Environmental triggers {{play a critical role in}} eliciting cancer developing in the gallbladder, best exemplified by cholelithiasis and chronic inflammation from biliary tract and parasitic infections. Mortality rates closely follow incidence; those countries with the highest prevalence of gallstones experience the greatest mortality from gallbladder cancer. Vague symptoms often delay the diagnosis of gallbladder cancer, contributing to its overall progression and poor outcome. Surgery represents the only potential for cure. Some individuals are fortunate to be incidentally found to have gallbladder cancer at the time of cholecystectomy being performed for cholelithiasis. Such an early diagnosis is imperative as a late presentation connotes advanced staging, nodal involvement, and possible recurrence following attempted resection. Overall mean survival is a mere 6 months, while 5 -year survival rate is only 5 %. The dismal prognosis, in part, relates to the gallbladder lacking a serosal layer adjacent to the liver, enabling hepatic invasion and metastatic progression. Improved imaging modalities are helping to diagnose patients at an earlier stage. The last decade has witnessed improved outcomes as aggressive surgical management and preoperative adjuvant therapy has helped prolong survival in patients with gallbladder cancer. In the future, the development of potential diagnostic markers for disease will yield screening opportunities for those at risk either with ethnic susceptibility or known anatomic anomalies of the biliary tract. Meanwhile, clarification of the value of prophylactic cholecystectomy should provide an opportunity for secondary prevention. Primary prevention will arrive once the predictive biomarkers and environmental risk factors are more clearly identified.

40|$|Weak superconducting {{proximity}} {{effect in the}} vicinity of the topological transition of a quantum anomalous Hall system has been proposed as a venue to realize a topological superconductor (TSC) with chiral Majorana edge modes (CMEMs). Recent experiment [He, et al., Science 357, 294 (2017) ] claimed to have observed such CMEMs in the form of a half-integer quantized conductance plateau in the two-terminal transport measurement of a quantum <b>anomalous</b> Hall-superconductor <b>junction.</b> While the presence of a superconducting {{proximity effect}} generically splits the quantum Hall transition into two phase transitions with a gapped TSC in between, in this work we propose that a nearly flat conductance plateau, similar to that expected from CMEMs, can also arise from the percolation of quantum Hall edges well before the onset of the TSC or at temperatures much above the TSC gap. Our work, therefore, suggests that in order to confirm the TSC, it is necessary to supplement the observation of the half-quantized conductance plateau with a hard superconducting gap (which is unlikely for a disordered system) from the conductance measurements or the heat transport measurement of the transport gap. Alternatively, the half-quantized thermal conductance would also serve as a smoking-gun signature of the TSC. Comment: 5 pages, 4 figures, 8 pages of supplementary materia...|$|R
40|$|Choledochal cysts are a {{congenital}} anomaly, {{and they}} show dilatation of the intra- or extrahepatic biliary tree.

Types I and IV-A cysts {{are the most common}} types, which are associated with <b>anomalous</b> pancreaticobiliary <b>junction</b> (APBJ), but other cysts are not associated with APBJ. Types I and IV-A cysts appear to belong to a different category from other cysts embryologically. Type I and IV-A cysts accompany anomalies of the pancreas.

Aim: The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the role of EUS in achieving etiological diagnosis in patients with IAP. Materials and Methods: Consecutive 192 patients with IAP were evaluated prospectively with EUS over a period of 2 years. Patients who had no etiological diagnosis for AP after detailed history, clinical examination, laboratory investigations, and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography were included in the study. Results: The mean age of patients was 34. 6 ± 12 and male:female ratio was 2. 1 : 1. Of these, 135 patients had gallbladder intact (Group A) and 57 patients had undergone cholecystectomy (Group B). In Group A, EUS identified a possible cause in 79 (58. 5 %) patients; microlithiasis (n = 48), chronic pancreatitis (CP) (n = 23), common bile duct (CBD) and gallbladder stone (n = 3), pancreatic divisum (n = 3), small pancreatic tumor (n = 1), and <b>anomalous</b> pancreaticobiliary <b>junction</b> (n = 1).

At age 5 years, abdominal ultrasonography had shown non-cystic dilatation of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary system without choledocholithiasis. Despite endoscopic sphincterotomy of a normal ampulla with extraction of bile duct stones at age eleven years, followed by laparoscopic resection of a dilated gall bladder, the attacks increased in frequency. Subsequent endoscopic retrograde cholangio pancreatography (ERCP) confirmed biliary dilatation {{in the absence of}} stones but the pancreatic duct was poorly outlined. At age 15 years a magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatogram (MRCP) showed generalised dilatation of the extrahepatic biliary tree involving the common hepatic duct and the porta hepatis with a large elongated choledochal cyst arising out of the lateral wall of the common bile duct (CBD). These findings are best seen in a coronal view (Figure 1) which also shows a normal pancreatic duct joining the CBD about 15 mm proximal {{to the level of the}} ampulla.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis, an idiopathic inflammatory condition of the biliary tree, has been clearly associated {{with the development of}} cholangiocarcinoma in up to 40% of patients. Congenital biliary cystic disease, such as choledochal cysts or Caroli's disease, has also been associated with malignant transformation in up to 25% of cases. These conditions appear to be related to an <b>anomalous</b> pancreatico-biliary duct <b>junction</b> and, perhaps, are related to the reflux of pancreatic secretions into the bile duct. Chronic biliary tract parasitic infection, seen commonly in Southeast Asia due to Clonorchis sinensis and Opisthorchis viverrini, has also been identified as a risk factor. Although gallstones and cholecystectomy are not thought to be associated with an increased incidence of cholangiocarcinoma, hepatolithiasis and choledocholithiasis may predispose to malignant change. Further, industrial exposure to asbestos and nitrosamines, {{and the use of the}} radiologic contrast agent, Thorotrast (thorium dioxide), are considered to be risk factors for the development of cholangiocarcinoma.|$|R
40|$|Congenital cystic {{dilatation}} of {{the common}} bile duct, also known as choledochal cyst, is an uncommon malformation, observed mainly in asiatic children, with a 3 : 1 female [...] male ratio. The entity is classified into 4 different types according to the anatomy of the malformation, which effects or not the intrahepatic biliary tree. The authors review theirs experience with 16 consecutive patients with choledochal cyst operated between 1971 and 1985. In 12 children (mean age: 5, 8 years, 11 girls) without previous surgery, preoperative diagnosis was made with abdominal ultrasonography and, in some cases, endoscopic retrograde cholangio-wirsungography. Peroperative cholangiography demonstrated a common pancreatico-biliary channel associated with high choledochal amylase content in 6 cases. Surgical treatment consisted in cyst excision with hepatico-jejunostomy in those 12 patients. We also discuss the surgical treatment of 4 previously operated patients with postoperative cholangitis or biliary carcinoma. An <b>anomalous</b> pancreatico-biliary ductal <b>junction</b> (long common channel allowing free pancreatico-biliary reflux) is usually observed in these patients; it is considered {{to play a role}} in the etiology of congenital choledochal cysts. Appropriate surgical treatment consists in cyst excision with hepatico-jejunostomy as biliary drainage, in order to eliminate bile stasis, to remove the mechanism which allows continuous pancreatico-biliary reflux and to prevent the occurrence of bile duct carcinoma...|$|R
40|$|Choledochocele {{represents}} a cystic dilatation of the distal {{common bile duct}} and it’s included in Todani’s classification as type III choledochal cysts. We report {{a case of a}} 66 -years-old man who presented a suspected gallbladder lithiasis with colic abdominal pain, vomit, fever, jaundice and abnormal liver function tests. However the endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography revealed the absence of stones in the common bile duct and the presence of a 15 mm-wide choledochocele that was successfully treated with an endoscopic sphincterotomy. Additionally a comprehensive review of the literature of the last 15 years was performed, collecting 105 cases of choledochocele. The available data were classified in 10 variables and subsequently analysed. Summarizing all data, we noticed that choledochocele presents different characteristics if compared with other types of choledochal cysts: The population affected is older, there isn’t a strong female prevalence, the most frequent manifestation is pancreatitis instead of jaundice and cholangitis, the association with <b>anomalous</b> pancreato-biliary duct <b>junction</b> is rare and the risk of malignancy is lower. The standard for the diagnosis is endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography instead of magnetic resonance cholangio-pancreatography and the most accepted treatment is endoscopic sphincterotomy in order to allow the correct outflow of the biliary juice. In conclusion, even if choledochocele is commonly considered a type of cystic dilatation of the common biliary duct and it is usually included in the choledochal cysts classification, it has to be considered as a distinct entity with its own features...|$|R
