The rate <b>of</b> <b>tenancy</b> had gradually increased since 1860 ’s and reached to over {{forty percent of the}} total farms in the United States in 1935. Writers aim in this study to identify the economical and noneconomical causes and problems of the development <b>of</b> <b>tenancy</b> in the United States. It is primarily for the purpose to get some useful suggestions and implications for Japan, Taiwan or other countries where the development <b>of</b> <b>tenancy</b> is now needed as a basic means of the structural improvement of agriculture...|$|R

40|$|We {{revisit the}} {{classical}} question of productivity implications <b>of</b> sharecropping <b>tenancy,</b> {{in the context}} <b>of</b> <b>tenancy</b> reforms (Operation Barga) in West Bengal, India studied previously by Banerjee, Gertler and Ghatak (JPE 2002). We utilize a disaggregated farm panel, controlling for other land reforms, agriculture input supply services, infrastructure spending of local governments, and potential endogeneity of land reform implementation. We continue to find significant positive effects <b>of</b> lagged village <b>tenancy</b> registration rates. But the direct effects on tenant farms are overshadowed by spillover effects on non-tenant farms. The effects <b>of</b> <b>tenancy</b> reform are also dominated by those of input supply programs and irrigation expenditures of local governments. These results indicate the effects <b>of</b> the <b>tenancy</b> reform cannot be interpreted as reduction of Marshall-Mill sharecropping distortions alone; village-wide impacts of land reforms and agricultural input supply programs administered by local governments deserve greater attention. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{determinants}} <b>of</b> agrarian <b>tenancy</b> contract choice and its implication on productivity in prewar Japan. Rapid agricultural growth under extensive tenancy relationships in prewar Japan was achieved with {{the prevalence of}} a unique rent reduction contract, which was more efficient than a share tenancy or a pure fixed-rent contract in terms of provision of incentives and risk-sharing. Despite its potential efficiency, a rent reduction contract incurred substantial transaction costs, which may have inhibited its adoption outside Japan. The prevalence of this contract in prewar Japan was likely due {{to the presence of}} villages that reduced such costs through informal governance <b>of</b> the private <b>tenancy</b> relationships. We found quantitatively at the village level that the choice <b>of</b> <b>tenancy</b> contract in prewar Iwate prefecture was affected by risk and possibly transaction costs. Furthermore, a sign of Marshallian inefficiency was found at the prefecture level, where the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>tenancy</b> and productivity is negatively correlated and such inefficiency was worse in prefectures with a greater proportion <b>of</b> share <b>tenancy.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Most of {{the discussions}} <b>of</b> farm <b>tenancy</b> have dealt {{primarily}} with the economic condition of the tenant class, the maintenance of soil fertility under tenant farming, and the more general and sociological aspects <b>of</b> the so-called <b>tenancy</b> problem. Very {{little attention has been}} directed to the relation <b>of</b> <b>tenancy</b> to the concrete problems of farm organiaztion and management. It is the purpose of this bulletin to present some details of this relationship as revealed in a limited investigation. To this end the effect of changes in the agriculture of the state on the increase in tenancy and on the methods of renting land is traced briefly thru the 40 years since tenancy statistics were first available. The prevailing types <b>of</b> <b>tenancy</b> are analyzed in their relation to the peculiarities of farming in each section {{of the state and the}} terms of rental under each tenancy type are given. Finally, the specific variations in the organization of the farm under the different types <b>of</b> <b>tenancy</b> are presented as revealed by the analysis of farm survey data from several representative counties. In conclusion the importance of properly adjusting the lease bargain to the type of farming best fitted to each individual farm and to the characteristics of the landlord and tenant is pointed out...|$|R

These included creation of quantified data bases from tax assessments for identification of statistical patterns in landholding, wealth, slaveowning, race, and gender; examination of other primary sources; development of a selected bibliography of secondary and period sources; and examination of extant sites in the field.
