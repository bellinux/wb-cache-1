40|$|Prospects for {{utilizing}} whole-genome {{association analysis}} in <b>autogamous</b> <b>plant</b> populations appear promising {{due to the}} reported high levels of linkage disequilibrium (LD). To determine the optimal strategies for implementing association analysis in soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.), we analyzed the structure of LD in three regions of the genome varying in length from 336 to 574 kb. This analysis was conducted in four distinct groups of soybean germplasm: 26 accessions of the wild ancestor of soybean (Glycine soja Seib. et Zucc.); 52 Asian G. max Landraces, the immediate results of domestication from G. soja; 17 Asian Landrace introductions that became the ancestors of North American (N. Am.) cultivars, and 25 Elite Cultivars from N. Am. In G. soja, LD did not extend past 100 kb; however, in the three cultivated G. max groups, LD extended from 90 to 574 kb, likely due to the impacts of domestication and increased self-fertilization. The three genomic regions were highly variable relative {{to the extent of}} LD within the three cultivated soybean populations. G. soja appears to be ideal for fine mapping of genes, but due to the highly variable levels of LD in the Landraces and the Elite Cultivars, whole-genome association analysis in soybean may be more difficult than first anticipated...|$|E
40|$|The endosperm, {{a result}} of double {{fertilization}} in flowering plants, is a triploid tissue whose genetic composition {{is more complex than}} diploid tissue. We present a new maximum-likelihood-based statistical method for mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) underlying endosperm traits in an <b>autogamous</b> <b>plant.</b> Genetic mapping of quantitative endosperm traits is qualitatively different from traits for other plant organs because the endosperm displays complicated trisomic inheritance and represents a younger generation than its mother plant. Our endosperm mapping method is based on two different experimental designs: (1) a one-stage design in which marker information is derived from the maternal genome and (2) a two-stage hierarchical design in which marker information is derived from both the maternal and offspring genomes (embryos). Under the one-stage design, the position and additive effect of a putative QTL can be well estimated, but the estimates of the dominant and epistatic effects are upward biased and imprecise. The two-stage hierarchical design, which extracts more genetic information from the material, typically improves the accuracy and precision of the dominant and epistatic effects for an endosperm trait. We discuss the effects on the estimation of QTL parameters of different sampling strategies under the two-stage hierarchical design. Our method will be broadly useful in mapping endosperm traits for many agriculturally important crop plants and also make it possible to study the genetic significance of double fertilization in the evolution of higher plants...|$|E
40|$|Background: Modern civilization {{depends on}} {{only a few}} plant species for its nourishment. These crops were derived via several {{thousands}} of years of human selection that transformed wild ancestors into high-yielding domesticated descendants. Among cultivated plants, common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is the most important grain legume. Yet, our understanding of the origins and concurrent shaping of the genome of this crop plant is limited. Results: We sequenced the genomes of 29 accessions representing 12 Phaseolus species. Single nucleotide polymorphism-based phylogenomic analyses, using both the nuclear and chloroplast genomes, allowed us to detect a speciation event, a finding further supported by metabolite profiling. In addition, we identified ~ 1200 protein coding genes (PCGs) and ~ 100 long non-coding RNAs with domestication-associated haplotypes. Finally, we describe asymmetric introgression events occurring among common bean subpopulations in Mesoamerica and across hemispheres. Conclusions: We uncover an unpredicted speciation event in the tropical Andes that gave rise to a sibling species, formerly considered the “wild ancestor” of P. vulgaris, which diverged before the split of the Mesoamerican and Andean P. vulgaris gene pools. Further, we identify haplotypes strongly associated with genes underlying the emergence of domestication traits. Our findings also reveal the capacity of a predominantly <b>autogamous</b> <b>plant</b> to outcross and fix loci from different populations, even from distant species, which led to the acquisition by domesticated beans of adaptive traits from wild relatives. The occurrence of such adaptive introgressions should be exploited to accelerate breeding programs in the near future.

40|$|ABSTRACT Heterozygosity is an {{extremely}} important resource in early breeding programs using <b>autogamous</b> <b>plants</b> because it is usually associated {{with the presence of}} genetic variability. Induced mutation and artificial hybridization can increase distinctly the proportion of loci in heterozygosis. This study aimed to compare segregating and mutant populations and relate the mechanisms used to generate variability with their respective heterozygosity levels tested. The treatments mutant populations (M 2, M 3, M 4, M 5, M 6 and M 7), segregating populations (F 4, F 5 and F 6) and lines (BRS Pérola and IPR Uirapuru) were evaluated by multivariate analysis and compared by orthogonal contrasts. The canonical discriminant analysis revealed which response variables contributed to differentiate the treatments assessed. All orthogonal contrasts involving the mutant populations showed significant differences, except the contrast between M 2 vs. M 3, M 4, M 5, M 6, M 7. The orthogonal contrast between the mutant and segregating populations denotes a significant variation in the interest in genetic breeding. The traits stem diameter (1. 41) and number of legumes per plant (2. 72) showed the highest canonical weight in this contrast. Conversely, number of grains per plant (- 3. 58) approached the mutant and segregating populations. No significant difference was observed in the linear comparison of means F 5 vs. F 6. The traits are fixed early in the segregant populations, unlike the mutant populations. Comparatively, induced mutation provides more loci in heterozygosis than artificial hybridization. Selection pressure should vary according to the variability creation mechanism used {{at the beginning of the}} breeding program...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION In the a {{breeding}} program leading, various strategies {{can be used}} and they are capable to yield good results. However, hybridization is a routine in current breeding programs {{and it has been}} the main new bean lines source (Menezes Júnior et al. 2013). The big difficulty in the <b>autogamous</b> <b>plants</b> breeding is finding two parents who bring together all the interest phenotypes. In this case, the alternative would be to promote successive cycles of selection and interbreeding of the best individuals or the best families (Geraldi 1997). The genetic progress periodic estimation is fundamental to guide the plant breeders about the selective strategies used and the alternatives that could be adopted to increase their efficiency. Thus, the procedures commonly used to compare selective cycles are the different cycles families or lines evaluation, which can be done using common witnesses (Ramalho 1996). The work objective was to estimate the genetic progress of two recurrent selection cycles based on the evaluation of families with common controls. MATERIAL AND METHODS The experiments were carried out at the Experimental Station of Coimbra, belonging to the Department of Plant Sciences of the Federal University of Viçosa (UFV). The base population, zero cycle (C 0), it was obtained by the combination of 20 carioca type grains, with favorable phenotypes for several agronomic interest characters. The parents were recombined in a circulating diallel design, with each parent participating in two crosses, generating 20 populations. From these populations, the families were derived and evaluated for three generations, in the generations F 2 : 4 and F 2 : 5. The same recombination procedure and C 0 evaluation were performed in cycle one (CI) ...|$|R
30|$|We {{identified}} three loci associated with resistance in total and one locus per panel x environment combination. This {{is far less}} than the 97 loci in total identified by Kang et al. (2015) using five blast strains. The great majority (75 / 97) of the loci associated with blast resistance detected by these authors were specific to one strain. The number of loci we were able to identify was also less than the 30 identified by Wang et al. (2014) in an indica panel using 16 blast strains. More in line with our results, Zhao et al. (2011) only detected a total of nine loci (five in their indica panel, none in their tropical japonica panel) using a mixture of three blast strains and Zhu et al. (2016) detected 16 loci for resistance to blast in field conditions over three different environments in the RDP 1 panel. Under our natural infestation conditions, the genetic structure of M. oryzae populations was complex, with a broad virulence spectrum as observed in our panel of differential lines. Such conditions drastically reduced the number of R genes that could potentially be detected. However, particularly in our tropical japonica panel, the near absence of complete resistance observed should have provided the right situation to detect quantitative resistance. Unfortunately, only one QTL was detected. The size of the tropical japonica panel (151 varieties) may have been too small to detect the usually small effects of QTLs. Genome wide investigations that specifically target quantitative resistance should be further considered in the future, preferentially in the tropical japonica background with the objective to better understand the genetic architecture of quantitative resistance to blast. Although the accumulation of quantitative resistance loci could contribute to achieve durable resistance (Poland et al. 2008), its molecular basis is still largely unknown in contrast to the gene-for-gene resistance model. To perform GWAS, we used 14, 187 markers for the indica panel and 12, 438 for the japonica panel. Although recently, some GWAS involved over a million SNP markers (Huang et al. 2015), given the extent of linkage disequilibrium in both panels, the genome coverage should have been sufficient to detect most of the loci involved in rice blast resistance. The drawback is that the resolution power of GWAS should be limited as many candidate genes may be detected in a same LD block (Yano et al. 2016). Still, a higher density of markers may allow localizing with more precision causative genes and polymorphisms. For example, Kang et al. (2015) clearly improved their mapping resolution when they compared a 44  K SNP dataset and a 700  K SNP dataset for the analysis of a same resistance locus reducing their target zone from 220  kb to 20  kb. To increase our detection power, we also need to work with a larger number of accessions, which would enable us to capture more low-frequency resistant alleles (Zuk et al. 2014). Multiple alleles may exist at single resistance loci within populations with a broad genetic base, as we observed at the Pi 33 locus in our indica panel. It may therefore be useful to complement GWAS based on single biallelic markers with GWAS based on haplotypes (Lorenz et al. 2010). In the context of an <b>autogamous</b> <b>plant</b> species such as rice, this should be straightforward as it would not involve the complication of inferring the linkage phase of the markers.|$|E

Não se observou efeito depressivo da autofecundação na altura das progênies derivadas do cafeeiro n. ° 1 e, nas do cafeeiro n. ° 2, o efeito depressivo não se mostrou uniforme. Dos três híbridos analisados, dois dêles apresentaram altura intermediária entre a dos dois e, no terceiro, altura pouco menor. As variâncias não mostraram tendências de aumento ou diminuição com as autofeeundações sucessivas e, dois dos híbridos, deram variâncias menores e um dêles variância maior, do que a dos pais. Quanto ao vigor das plantas, avaliado por pontos dados subjetivamente, notou-se uma redução no vigor na geração S 1 em relação a S 0, permanecendo as plantas das demais gerações com vigor semelhante ao do S 1 ou S 2. Apenas um dos três híbridos mostrou vigor maior do que o dos pais. No que concerne à produção, verificou-se uma diminuição a partir da S 1 a S 4 nos descendentes do cafeeiro n. ° 1, tendo a S 4 produção superior a S 0, porém não significativa; entre os descendentes do n. ° 2, observou-se produção significativamente menor apenas na progênie Em um dos híbridos a produção foi superior à dos pais e nos outros dois, intermediaria.

'Bourbon Vermelho' being an <b>autogamous</b> <b>plant,</b> {{a certain level}} of heterozygosity seems to be maintained in the population, owing to about 10 per cent of natural out-crossing. If heterozygosity is present ít ahould be possible to detect the harmful effect of successive selfings on the population. The influence of successive selfings on the total yield, height and vigor of five generation (S 0 to S 4) and of hybrids between S 0, S 2 and S 4, in two independent series of coffee progenies (1 and 2) was analysed. Concerning plant height {{it was found that the}} progenies derived from the mother tree n. 2 were in average taller than those belonging to group 1. No significant differences were noticed among the generations for the group 1, whereas in the second, the S 2 progeny was the shortest and the S 0 the tallest. The hybrids between S 0 or S 2 were intermediate to the parents, while the crossing between S 4 was shorter than both parents. The variance was somewhat similar, showing no tendency for increasing as a result of continuous controlled self-pollination (Table I). Plant vigor seems to decrease in the S 1 remaining stable in the subsequent generations. Only the hybrid between S 2 was more vigorous than both parents. The total yield for the first group of progenies decreased from S 0 to S 3 as result of selfing. However the S 4 generation gave a higher yield, which may be due to selection or mutation since contamination should not have occurred. In the second group only the progeninys S 4 was less productives than the S 0. The hybrid between S 0, had higher yield than both parents indicating some heterotic manifestation. The variance was not affected by continuous artificial selfings. Additional data must be collected for other cultivars before the effect of successive selfing on coffee can be determined accurately. The data here discussed indicated that, although some depressive effeet could be noticed, it was not related to the presence of highly deleterious genes in heterozygosity in the ppoulation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract only availableNicotiana is {{commonly}} studied {{due to the}} presence of both highly autogamous species, such as plumbaginifolia, and crossing species, such as alata. There are also species that expend energy to a mix of selfing and crossing, such as longiflora. It has been speculated that there are morphological differences between these types. Specifically, my study concentrates on the differences in pollen to ovule ratios {{and the size of the}} sexual parts. I hypothesize a lower pollen to ovule ratio in selfers as the plant will not need excessive pollen for dispersal. Sexual parts of the plant should be larger in cross breeding plants to hold the larger quantity of pollen or ovules. It is important to understand the differences between <b>autogamous</b> <b>plants</b> and cross breeding plants so as to better understand the costs and benefits associated with autogamy. Measurements that I took include anther length and width, ovary length and width, and position of the flower on the inflorescence. I have developed protocols to evenly spread the pollen of one locule in a solution on a slide and to show and preserve one carpel of the ovary. These protocols were designed so that I was able to take pictures through a compound and dissecting scope, save the pictures as JPEG files and count the pollen and ovules with the help of a computer program. Currently there is not enough data to run any statistical tests. I will run all measurements and counts through an analysis of variance test to determine statistical differences. Judging on the data I have thus far, I predict a significant difference between pollen to ovule ratios. There may be little difference between anther and ovule size.

The anthers of the <b>autogamous</b> bread wheat <b>plant</b> are normally extruded post anthesis, a trait which is unfavourable {{for the production of}} F 1 hybrid grain. Higher anther extrusion (AE) promotes cross fertilization for more efficient hybrid seed production. Therefore, this study aimed at the genetic dissection of AE by genome wide association studies (GWAS) and determination of the main effect QTL. We applied GWAS approach to identify DArT markers potentially linked to AE to unfold its genetic basis in a panel of spring wheat accessions. Phenotypic data were collected for three years and best linear unbiased estimate (BLUE) values were calculated across all years. The extent of the AE correlation between growing years and BLUE values ranged from r = + 0. 56 (2013 vs 2015) to 0. 91 (2014 vs BLUE values). The broad sense heritability was 0. 84 across all years. Six accessions displayed stable AE > 80 % across all the years. Genotyping data included 2, 575 DArT markers (with minimum of 0. 05 minor allele frequency applied). AE was influenced both by genotype and by the growing environment. In all, 131 significant marker trait associations (MTAs) (|log 10 (P) | >FDR) were established for AE. AE behaved as a quantitative trait, with five consistently significant markers (significant across at least two years with a significant BLUE value) contributing a minor to modest proportion (4. 29 % to 8. 61 %) of the phenotypic variance and affecting the trait either positively or negatively.
