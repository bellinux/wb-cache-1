5|$|Howe and Queen Charlotte led {{the fleet}} by example, sailing {{directly}} at the French flagship Montagne. Passing between Montagne and the next in line Vengeur du Peuple, Queen Charlotte raked both <b>and</b> <b>hauled</b> up close to Montagne {{to engage in a}} close-range artillery battle. As she did so, Queen Charlotte also became briefly entangled with Jacobin, and exchanged fire with her too, causing serious damage to both French ships.|$|E
5|$|On {{her next}} trip, the veteran {{transport}} loaded troops at Saint-Nazaire that included nine complete hospital units. After two days delay because of storms in the Bay of Biscay, Princess Matoika departed on 16April, {{and arrived at}} Newport News on 27April with 3,500troops. Shifting south to Charleston, South Carolina, the Matoika embarked 2,200former German prisoners of war (POWs) <b>and</b> <b>hauled</b> them to Rotterdam. This trip was followed up in May {{with the return of}} portions of the 79th Infantry Division from Saint-Nazaire to New York.|$|E
5|$|Roberts {{entered his}} first NHL {{training}} camp with the Flames in 1984 believing his summer lacrosse schedule {{was enough to}} keep him in proper hockey game shape. Coach Bob Johnson disagreed <b>and</b> <b>hauled</b> him in front of his peers as an example of someone who had not committed to being a hockey player. He was initially upset, but grew to realize that Johnson was correct, particularly in that he was not particularly focused on his fitness. The criticism inspired Roberts to dedicate himself to personal training, and carried a reputation for being obsessed with nutrition and physical fitness throughout his career. He credited his fitness and nutrition regimen with helping him extend his career another 13 years after his first retirement.|$|E

5|$|After this, the Allied forces {{advanced}} to the fortified naval outpost of Tobruk. The 6th Division attacked the perimeter defences early on 21 January, following a week of continuous bombardment from both land and sea. The 2/3rd Battalion was tasked with breaching the outer Italian defences for the 2/1st Battalion to pass through. Following the initial breakthrough, the 2/3rd then advanced west along the inner ring of defences, attacking a number of Italian posts as they went. Tobruk fell the next day, with the Italians surrendering to Brigadier Horace Robertson, {{the commander of the}} 19th Brigade. The Italian flag was taken down {{and in the absence of}} an Australian flag, a signaler from the 2/4th Battalion tied his slouch hat to the flag staff <b>and</b> <b>hauled</b> it up to the top. The battalion's losses during the fighting for Tobruk were seven officers and 50 men killed or wounded.|$|E
5|$|Levant {{returned}} to Navy service in 1766 {{under the command}} of Captain Basil Keith, and was assigned to patrol and convoy duties on the Navy's Jamaica Station. In August she docked at Deptford to take on crew and supplies, setting sail for the Caribbean on 28 November. Levant held her Jamaica post for three years, but this extensive service in tropical waters left her in poor condition. In 1770 she {{returned to}} Deptford Dockyard where she was decommissioned <b>and</b> <b>hauled</b> out of the water for rebuilding. The work was granted to shipwright John Dudman and took six months from November 1770 to April 1771. Repair and rebuilding expenses were £5,869 with an additional £3,059 for fitting-out, amounting to considerably more than the vessel's original construction cost of £5,423.|$|E
5|$|The {{lifeboats}} were lowered {{every few}} minutes on each side, {{but most of the}} boats were greatly under-filled. No.5 left with 41 aboard, No.3 had 32 aboard, No.8 left with 39 and No.1 left with just 12 out of a capacity of 40. The evacuation did not go smoothly and passengers suffered accidents and injuries as it progressed. One woman fell between lifeboat No.10 and the side of the ship but someone caught her by the ankle <b>and</b> <b>hauled</b> her back onto the promenade deck, where she made a second successful attempt at boarding. First-class passenger Annie Stengel broke several ribs when an overweight German-American doctor and his brother jumped into No.5, squashing her and knocking her unconscious. The lifeboats' descent was likewise risky. No.6 was nearly flooded during the descent by water discharging out of the ship's side, but successfully made it away from the ship. No.3 came close to disaster when, for a time, one of the davits jammed, threatening to pitch the passengers out of the lifeboat and into the sea.|$|E

5|$|Villaret in Montagne, having {{successfully}} broken {{contact with}} the British flagship and slipped away to the north, managed to gather 11ships of the line around him and formed them up in a reconstituted battle squadron. At 11:30, with the main action drawing to a close, he began a recovery manoeuvre intended to lessen the tactical defeat his fleet had suffered. Aiming his new squadron at the battered Queen, Villaret's attack created consternation in the British fleet, which was unprepared for a second engagement. However, discerning Villaret's intention, Howe also pulled his ships {{together to create a}} new force. His reformed squadron consisted of Queen Charlotte, Royal Sovereign, Valiant, Leviathan, Barfleur, and Thunderer. Howe deployed this squadron in defence of Queen, and the two short lines engaged one another at a distance before Villaret abandoned his manoeuvre <b>and</b> <b>hauled</b> off to collect several of his own dismasted ships that were endeavouring to escape British pursuit. Villaret was subsequently joined by the battered Terrible, which sailed straight through the dispersed British fleet to reach the French lines, and he also recovered the dismasted Scipion, Mucius, Jemmappes, and Républicain—all of which lay within reach of the unengaged British ships—before turning eastwards towards France. At this stage of the battle, Howe retired below and the British consolidation was left to his Captain of the Fleet, Sir Roger Curtis. Curtis was subsequently blamed by some in the Navy for not capturing more of the dismasted French ships, and was also accused of dissuading Howe from attempting further pursuit.|$|E

25|$|Maintaining an {{adequate}} water supply was a problem, and later an inclined plane was built at Blackhill, in which barges were let down <b>and</b> <b>hauled</b> up, floating in caissons that ran on rails.

25|$|The {{inclined}} planes used a large wheel round {{which the}} rope (later a wire rope) passed {{and there was}} a brake on the drum enabling a man to control the speed of the movement; it was worked on the balanced system: four loaded waggons descended <b>and</b> <b>hauled</b> four empties up.

Although she was a large boat and expensive, Shoshone drew less than two feet of water and had no difficulty navigating the river to Old's Ferry, Idaho.|$|E
25|$|Starting in 1849, many of {{the ship}} crews jumped ship {{and headed for the}} gold fields when they reached port. Soon San Francisco Bay had many {{hundreds}} of abandoned ships anchored offshore. The better ships were recrewed and put back in the shipping and passenger business. Others were bought cheap <b>and</b> <b>hauled</b> up on the mud flats and used as store ships, saloons, temporary stores, floating warehouses, homes, {{and a number of other}} uses. Many of these repurposed ships were partially destroyed in one of San Francisco's many fires and ended up as landfill to expand the available land. The population of San Francisco exploded from about 200 in 1846 to 36,000 in the 1852 California Census.|$|E
