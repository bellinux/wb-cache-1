I. INTRODUCTlo Consider an organized market dealing with a single commodity where trading takes place out ofeuuilibrium. We suppose that prices are set either by a marketeer (for example, a trading speciaiist) or by a market authority (for example, in a centralized economy).

While these should, in principle, give broadly comparable measurements, any differences are a function {{not only of the}} differences in the sensor responses, but also of the spectral characteristics of the target pixels. In order to test for and quantify differences between these sensors, a large set of coincident imagery was assembled for the Australian landscape. Comparisons were carried out in terms of surface reflectance, and also in terms of biophysical quantities estimated from the reflectances.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} main issues that supply shocks pose for {{the conduct of}} {{monetary}} policy. A simple version of the Gordon-Phelps model shows that the necessary condition for actual real GNP to be maintained at its equilibrium level {{in the wake of a}} supply shock is for the change innominal GNP to exceed the change in the nominal wage by the change in the income share of the raw material in GNP. The required "wedge" between nominal GNP and wage growth can be accomplished by any combination of monetary accommodation and nominal wage flexibility. Without this combination a "macroeconomic externality" occurs, with real CNP falling below its equilibrium level. The obstacles to monetary accommodation are examined in terms of a taxonomic wage <b>adjustment</b> <b>equation</b> that allows for differing responses to current inflation, lagged inflation, and lagged wage change. Monetary accommodation is infeasible when there is full indexation to current inflation and creates a permanent acceleration of inflation following a one-time permanent shock when there is indexation to lagged inflation. With "forward-looking" expectation formation in the sense of Taylor, a supply shock is likely to cause changes in parameters of the wage <b>adjustment</b> <b>equation</b> as workers attempt to avoid the macroeconomic externality. The final section of the paper discusses doctrinal debates that originated in part from the empirical failures of earlier Phillips curves that neglected supply shocks. ...|$|E

40|$|Since the {{breakdown}} of the Smithsonian agreement, many countries in the world have adopted the system of flexible exchange rates, and experienced greater exchange rate volatility than had previously been anticipated. But, central banks often engage in buying or selling foreign exchange in order to moderate the speed of exchange rate movements. In this managed floating exchange rate system, the significance of international reserves still remains. Existing studies of the demand for reserves, however, have ignored the role of exchange rate flexibility in modeling. ^ In this thesis, the dynamic <b>adjustment</b> <b>equation</b> of international reserves is developed by combining the theory of exchange market intervention with the theory of the demand for international reserves. The model is then estimated with quarterly data from 8 industrial countries that maintained a flexible exchange rate between 1973 and 1990. The results obtained support the hypotheses that: (i) international reserve movements respond both to the gap between desired and actual reserve holdings and to the change in the exchange rate, and the expected value of the coefficient for the exchange-rate smoothing term is negative; (ii) omitting considerations of exchange-rate smoothing term from the dynamic analysis of international reserve holdings yields an upward biased coefficient on the gap between target and actual reserve holdings; (iii) omitting considerations of the gap between desired and actual reserve holdings term from the dynamic analysis of international reserve holdings, i. e., foreign exchange market intervention model yields an downward biased coefficient on the change in the exchange rate. However, the general dynamic <b>adjustment</b> <b>equation</b> of reserve holdings during the sample period remains stable between before and after the Plaza Meeting for all cases except Canada. The general model is less successful with the data from the developing countries, where other considerations need to be introduced to account for changes in reserve holdings. ...|$|E

A model of interest rate determination which allows for imperfectly mobile capital and the impact of both domestic and international influences on the domestic rate is developed and estimated using cointegration techniques. The results indicate that domestic interest rates have been influenced significantly by foreign interest rates. However, despite several reductions in capital control in the late 1980 s and early 1990 s, the degree of capital mobility appears not to be as high as previously reported nor to have increased significantly. The finding of a moderately high degree of capital mobility coupled with a reasonable EC-type, short-run dynamic <b>adjustment</b> <b>equation</b> for the domestic interest rate implies that there is still some scope for the Thai authorities to conduct an independent monetary policy. ...|$|E

Secondly, instead of arbitrarily adding the lagged inflation rate to the theory based long run PC to capture persistence in inflation, our approach shows that persistence effects can also be captured through the dynamic <b>adjustment</b> <b>equations.</b> This has an added advantage because it offers a more flexible lag structure to estimate dynamic adjustments compared to the partial adjustment process in the hybrid NKPC. ...|$|R
