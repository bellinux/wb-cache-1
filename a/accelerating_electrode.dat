50|$|The ions {{pass through}} the <b>accelerating</b> <b>electrode</b> and strike the target. When ions strike the target, 2-3 {{electrons}} per ion are produced by secondary emission. In order to prevent these secondary electrons from being accelerated back into the ion source, the accelerator electrode is biased negative {{with respect to the}} target. This voltage, called the suppressor voltage, must be at least 500 volts and may be as high as a few kilovolts. Loss of suppressor voltage will result in damage, possibly catastrophic, to the neutron tube.|$|E
5000|$|An <b>accelerating</b> <b>electrode</b> (accelerator) {{is placed}} {{directly}} in front of the emitter. This electrode consists of a metal (usually stainless steel) plate where two sharp blades are machined. When thrust is required, a strong electric field is generated by the application of a high voltage difference between the emitter and the accelerator. Under this condition, the free surface of the liquid metal enters a regime of local instability, due to the combined effects of the electrostatic force and the surface tension. A series of protruding cusps, or [...] "Taylor cones" [...] are thus created. When the electric field reaches a value in the order of 109 V/m, the atoms at the tip of the cusps spontaneously ionize and an ion jet is extracted by the electric field, while the electrons are rejected in the bulk of the liquid. An external source of electrons (neutralizer) provides negative charges to maintain global electrical neutrality of the thruster assembly.|$|E

40|$|AbstractComputer {{simulation}} of gas-filled neutron tube has been fulfilled. Fully relativistic electromagnetic particle-in-cell finite difference, time-domain cod SUMA [1, 2] {{has been used}} to investigate ion-optic system, the ionization and knock on processes and their influence on the deuteron beam and the output neutron flow parameters. When deuteron and ionized particles space charge self-field forces become the same order of magnitude as external one, virtual cathode may occurs. It happens because the injected from ion source deuterons cannot overcome their own space charge potential wall and move in transverse direction. However, electrons, produced by ionization, are trapped within the deuteron beam space charge potential wall and decrease it significantly. Thus, space charge neutralization of deuteron beams by electrons, may considerably increase target current and, as a result, output neutron flow. Moreover, own longitudinal electric field rise near the target leads to reduction of <b>accelerating</b> <b>electrode</b> target potential wall, which was made to prevent knock on emission from the target. As a result, additional knocked on electrons may appear in the region and should be taken into account. The data obtained were compared with experimental results...|$|E

40|$|On August 8, 2001, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory {{celebrated the}} centennial {{of the birth of}} its founder (and namesake), Ernest Orlando Lawrence. For the occasion, many speeches were given and old speeches were remembered. We recall the words of the late Luis Alvarez, a Nobel Laureate and one of the Lawrence's closest colleagues: ''Lawrence will always be remembered as the {{inventor}} of the cyclotron, but more importantly, he should be remembered as the inventor of the modern way of doing science''. J. L. Heilbron and R. W. Seidel, in the introduction of their book, ''Lawrence and His Laboratory'' stated, ''The motives and mechanisms that shaped the growth of the Laboratory helped to force deep changes in the scientific estate and in the wider society. In the entrepreneurship of its founder, Ernest Orlando Lawrence, these motives, mechanisms, and changes came together in a tight focus. He mobilized great and small philanthropists, state and local governments, corporations, and plutocrats, volunteers and virtuosos. The work they supported, from astrophysics and atomic bombs, from radiochemistry to nuclear medicine, shaped the way we observe, control, and manipulate our environment. '' Indeed, all over the civilized world, the ways we do science changed forever after Lawrence built his famed Radiation Laboratory. In this editorial, we epitomize his legacy of changing the way we do medicine, thereby affecting the health and well being of all humanity. This year marks the 75 th anniversary of the invention of the cyclotron by Ernest Orlando Lawrence at the University of California at Berkeley. Lawrence conceived the idea of the cyclotron early in 1929 after reading an article by Rolf Wideroe on high-energy accelerators. In the spring of 1930 one of his students, Nels Edlefsen, constructed two crude models of a cyclotron. Later in the fall of the same year, another student, M. Stanley Livingston, constructed a 13 -cm diameter model that had all the features of early cyclotrons, accelerating protons to 80, 000 volts using less than 1, 000 volts on a semi-circular <b>accelerating</b> <b>electrode,</b> now called the ''dee''. Following the discovery by J. D. Cockcroft and E. T. S. Walton of how to produce larger currents at higher voltages, Lawrence constructed the first two-dee 27 -Inch (69 -cm) Cyclotron, which produced protons and deuterons of 4. 8 MeV. The 27 -Inch Cyclotron was used extensively in early investigations of nuclear reactions involving neutrons and artificial radioactivity. In 1939, working with William Brobeck, Lawrence constructed the 60 -Inch (150 -cm) Cyclotron, which accelerated deuterons to 19 MeV. It was housed in the Crocker Laboratory, where scientists first made transmutations of some elements, discovered several transuranic elements, and created hundreds of radioisotopes of known elements. At the Crocker Laboratory the new medical modality called nuclear medicine was born, which used radioisotopes for diagnosis and treatment of human diseases. In 1939 Lawrence was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, and later element 103 was named ''Lawrencium'' in his honor...|$|E
40|$|In 1930, Ernest Orlando Lawrence at the University of California at Berkeley {{invented the}} cyclotron. One of his students, M. Stanley Livingston, {{constructed}} a 13 -cm diameter model that {{had all the}} features of early cyclotrons, accelerating protons to 80 keV using less than 1 kV on a semi-circular <b>accelerating</b> <b>electrode,</b> now called the ''dee''. Soon after, Lawrence constructed the first two-dee 27 -Inch (69 -cm) Cyclotron, which produced protons and deuterons of 4. 8 MeV. In 1939, Lawrence constructed the 60 -Inch (150 -cm) Cyclotron, which accelerated deuterons to 19 MeV. Just before WWII, Lawrence designed a 184 -inch cyclotron, but the war prevented the building of this machine. Immediately after the war ended, the Veksler-McMillan principle of phase stability was put forward, which enabled the transformation of conventional cyclotrons to successful synchrocyclotrons. When completed, the 184 -Inch Synchrocyclotron produced 340 -MeV protons. Following it, more modern synchrocyclotrons were built around the globe, and the synchrocyclotrons in Berkeley and Uppsala, together with the Harvard cyclotron, would perform pioneering work in treatment of human cancer using accelerated hadrons (protons and light ions). When the 184 -Inch Synchrocyclotron was built, Lawrence asked Robert Wilson, {{one of his former}} graduate students, to look into the shielding requirements for of the new accelerator. Wilson soon realized that the 184 -Inch would produce a copious number of protons and other light ions that had enough energy to penetrate human body, and could be used for treatment of deep-seated diseases. Realizing the advantages of delivering a larger dose in the Bragg peak when placed inside deep-seated tumors, he published in a medical journal a seminal paper on the rationale to use accelerated protons and light ions for treatment of human cancer. The precise dose localization provided by protons and light ions means lower doses to normal tissues adjacent to the treatment volume compared to those in conventional (photon) treatments. Wilson wrote his personal account of this pioneering work in 1997. In 1954 Cornelius Tobias and John Lawrence at the Radiation Laboratory (former E. O. Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory) of the University of California, Berkeley performed the first therapeutic exposure of human patients to hadron (deuteron and helium ion) beams at the 184 -Inch Synchrocyclotron. By 1984, or 30 years after the first proton treatment at Berkeley, programs of proton radiation treatments had opened at: University of Uppsala, Sweden, 1957; the Massachusetts General Hospital-Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory (MGH/HCL), USA, 1961; Dubna (1967), Moscow (1969) and St Petersburg (1975) in Russia; Chiba (1979) and Tsukuba (1983) in Japan; and Villigen, Switzerland, 1984. These centers used the accelerators originally constructed for nuclear physics research. The experience at these centers has confirmed the efficacy of protons and light ions in increasing the tumor dose relative to normal tissue dose, with significant improvements in local control and patient survival for several tumor sites. M. R. Raju reviewed the early clinical studies. In 1990, the Loma Linda University Medical Center in California heralded in the age of dedicated medical accelerators when it commissioned its proton therapy facility with a 250 -MeV synchrotron. Since then there has been a relatively rapid {{increase in the number of}} hospital-based proton treatment centers around the world, and by 2006 there are more than a dozen commercially-built facilities in use, five new facilities under construction, and more in planning stages. In the 1950 s larger synchrotrons were built in the GeV region at Brookhaven (3 -GeV Cosmotron) and at Berkeley (6 -GeV Bevatron), and today most of the world's largest accelerators are synchrotrons. With advances in accelerator design in the early 1970 s, synchrotrons at Berkeley and Princeton accelerated ions with atomic numbers between 6 and 18, at energies that permitted the initiation of several biological studies. It is worth noting that when the Bevatron was converted to accelerate light ions, the main push came from biomedical users who wanted to use high-LET radiation for treating human cancer...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of electric propulsion to communications satellites, however, {{has been limited}} {{to the use of}} hydrazine thrusters with electric heaters for thrust and specific impulse augmentation. These electrothermal thrusters operate at specific impulse levels of approximately 300 s with heater powers of about 500 W. Low power arcjets (1 - 3 kW) are currently being investigated as a way to increase specific impulse levels to approximately 500 s. Ion propulsion systems can easily produce specific impulses of 3000 s or greater, but have yet to be applied to communications satellites. The reasons most often given for not using ion propulsion systems are their high level of overall complexity, low thrust with long burn times, and the difficulty of integrating the propulsion system into existing commercial spacecraft busses.

Here, water-gas shift and reforming reactions at the anode are coupled to diffusive and convective transport processes, leading to a variation of temperature and gas-phase species along the flow channel and through the anode thickness. A combined experimental and modelling study of the spatially resolved performance of a planar segmented SOFC was performed in order to investigate and understand the spatial inhomogeneities in gas composition and temperature. A planar anode-supported SOFC single cell was locally characterized in a 4  4 -segmented cell arrangement. The tests were performed in counter-flow operation with methane-steam mixtures. Local and global current-voltage relationship was measured as a function of gas composition and fuel utilization. A two-dimensional elementary kinetic electrochemical model representing the segmented cell along the flow path and through the thickness of membrane-electrode assembly and interconnector was developed. The coupled charge-transfer and heterogeneous chemical kinetics are represented by an elementary kinetic mechanism consisting of 24 reactions between 6 gas-phase species, 12 Ni-surface-adsorbed species, and 4 YSZ-adsorbed species.

The system has been fully developed for the inspection of spot welds manufactured in steel alloys, and has been mainly applied in the automotive industry. In recent years, a variety of materials have been introduced to the automotive industry. These include high strength steels, magnesium alloys, and aluminum alloys. Aluminum alloys have been of particular interest due to their high strength-to-weight ratio. Resistance spot welding requirements for aluminum vary greatly from those of steel. Additionally, the oxide film formed on the aluminum surface increases the heat generation between the copper electrodes and the aluminum plates leading to <b>accelerated</b> <b>electrode</b> deterioration. Preliminary studies showed that the real-time quality inspection system was not able to monitor spot welds manufactured with aluminum. The extensive experimental research, finite element modelling of the aluminum welding process and finite difference modeling of the acoustic wave propagation through the aluminum spot welds presented in this dissertation, revealed that the thermodynamics and hence the acoustic wave propagation through an aluminum and a steel spot weld differ significantly. For this reason, the hardware requirements and the algorithms developed to determine the welds quality from the ultrasonic data used on steel, no longer apply on aluminum spot welds. After updating the system and designing the required algorithms, parameters such as liquid nugget penetration and nugget diameter were available in the ultrasonic data acquired during the aluminum welding process.

40|$|Random {{networks}} of silver nanowires are a promising option to replace conventional transparent conductive oxides, such as {{indium tin oxide}} (ITO), which are expensive, brittle, and require high temperatures and vacuum during deposition. In this work, silver nanowire transparent electrodes are fabricated with similar optoelectronic properties as ITO, while having a more convenient deposition process and being both cheaper and more mechanically flexible. Alongside these benefits, however, are some technical challenges {{that need to be}} addressed before nanowire electrodes can be widely used in commercial electronic devices. Firstly, the high surface roughness of the nanowire electrodes can cause issues such shorting when they are integrated into thin-film devices. A simple hot-rolling method was studied to embed the nanowires into the surface of plastic substrates, which reduces both the surface roughness and nanowire adhesion. A second issue with nanowire electrodes is the Joule heating that occurs when they conduct current for long periods of time, as is the case when used in solar cells and light emitting diodes. It is shown that the current density in the nanowires is both much higher and non-uniform than in a continuous film such as ITO. This leads to localized temperatures of 250 °C or more when conducting current levels encountered in organic solar cells and OLEDs. These temperatures <b>accelerate</b> <b>electrode</b> breakdown. A passivation layer of reduced graphene oxide is deposited on the nanowire films to slow their degradation. However, Joule heating still occurs and the electrodes fail due to melting of the plastic substrate. Recommendations for managing these adverse effects are proposed. To expand the application of silver nanowire transparent electrodes, they are integrated into polymer dispersed liquid crystal (PDLC) smart windows for the first time. Not only are the materials and fabrication costs of the nanowire electrodes less than ITO, but the resulting smart windows exhibit superior electro-optical characteristics. In another application, silver nanowires in conjunction with Al-doped ZnO (AZO) are developed as a conformal and transparent electrode to improve the efficiency of 3 D solar cells. Lastly, a simple method of growing AgCl nanocubes directly on silver nanowires is introduced, which can have applications in surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and photocatalytic reactions...|$|R
40|$|Sulphated polysaccharides κ-, ι-, and λ-carrageenan were {{analysed}} in seawater {{by applying}} adsorptive transfer constant current derivative chronopotentiometric stripping (AdT CPS) method on mercury <b>electrode.</b> <b>Accelerated</b> faradaic (catalytic) {{nature of the}} peak (peak HPS) recorded at negative potential was confirmed for all three carrageenans using specific electrochemical criteria. The effect of chronopotentiometric parameters (accumulation potential, accumulation time and stripping current) on the peak HPS height was evaluated for each carrageenan. Optimal CPS parameters for AdT CPS analysis of particular carrageenan in seawater were defined. Regarding the AdT CPS of carrageenans mixture, only λ-carrageenan could be successfully measured in the mixture with ι- and/or κ-carrageenan. This is the first electroanalytical study of a model mixture of sulphated polysaccharides in seawater and it is of great importance {{for the analysis of}} organic matter in seawater, especially acidic polysaccharides containing sulphate groups in the structure...|$|R
40|$|Radio-frequency {{quadrupole}} (RFQ) {{linear accelerators}} {{appeared on the}} accelerator scene in the late 1970 s and have since revolutionized the domain of low-energy proton and ion acceleration. The RFQ makes the reliable production of unprecedented ion beam intensities possible within a compact radio-frequency (RF) resonator which concentrates the three main functions of the low-energy linac section: focusing, bunching and <b>accelerating.</b> Its sophisticated <b>electrode</b> structure and strict beam dynamics and RF requirements, however, impose severe constraints on the mechanical and RF layout, making the construction of RFQs particularly challenging. This lecture will introduce the main beam optics, RF and mechanical features of a RFQ emphasizing how these three aspects are interrelated and how they contribute to the final performance of the RFQ.

40|$|Abstract: 2 -Mercaptoethanol self-assembled {{monolayer}} (ME/Au SAMs) was prepared on a gold electrode. The ME/Au SAMs {{was characterized by}} using ATR-FTIR and dynamic contact angle measurements. The electrochemical behaviors of noradrenaline (NE) on the ME/Au SAMs were studied in BR buffer solution. The modified <b>electrode</b> <b>accelerated</b> electron transfer rate of the redox of NE and showed an excellent eletrocatalytic activity. The diffusion coefficient (D) of NE was obtained to be 4. 3 × 10 - 8 cm 2 s- 1. The catalytic current increased linearly with the concentration of NE {{in the range of}} 2. 0 × 10 - 6 - 1. 0 × 10 - 3 M by square wave voltammetry response. The modified electrode could eliminate the interference of ascorbic acid (AA) at 40 -fold concentration of NE and could be satisfactorily used for the determination of NE in the drug injection...|$|R
50|$|Since the {{electrons}} {{have a negative}} charge, they are repelled by the cathode and attracted to the anode. They travel in straight lines through the empty tube. The voltage applied between the <b>electrodes</b> <b>accelerates</b> these low mass particles to high velocities. Cathode rays are invisible, but their presence was first detected in early vacuum tubes when they struck the glass wall of the tube, exciting the atoms of the glass and causing them to emit light, a glow called fluorescence. Researchers noticed that objects placed in the tube {{in front of the}} cathode could cast a shadow on the glowing wall, and realized that something must be travelling in straight lines from the cathode. After {{the electrons}} reach the anode, they travel through the anode wire to the power supply and back to the cathode, so cathode rays carry electric current through the tube.|$|R
