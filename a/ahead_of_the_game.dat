Additionally, most of Moscow's hotels were full on the night of the game. As some fans looked to offload tickets to the match, The Moscow Times reported that the black-market price dropped from a high of €2,000 (£1,600) to around €500 (£400), while Russian TV channel Sport-1 was reporting prices as low as £300 for tickets belonging to fans who had failed to make the trip to Moscow. Among the celebrities who did not travel were Chelsea supporter and chairman of the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) Sebastian Coe, who had to attend meetings ahead of the 2012 Summer Olympics, and Manchester United fan and Simply Red lead singer Mick Hucknall, who was due to perform at the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth.|$|E

Guillemin was selected for the Rest. <b>Ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> Reichel in Le Figaro gave France the odds of winning, since it had a heavier pack and better halfbacks, and also commented positively on Duval, Bonhomme and Guillemin. The Rest of France won 12–6. The cohesion of the Rest's threequarter line, all coming from Stade Français, was especially apparent, while the forwards, although weaker in the scrum, and lighter, played with more [...] "valour". As a result, many changes were made for the team to play [...] on 1 January 1908: the captain, Marc Giacardy, was dropped altogether, and Guillemin was one of several who won selection.|$|E

About GHV2, New Strait Times Christie Leo commented that [...] "this second volume of {{greatest}} hits isn't as immediately accessible as the first. But that's not what this collection is all about. This 14-track set actually provides a more daring glimpse into the inner machinations of the music marketing juggernaut, Madonna". AllMusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave a mixed review calling it [...] "slightly disappointing", justifying {{that it was because}} during the 1990s, Madonna was an album artist. He finished his review saying that [...] "the end result is less {{than the sum of its}} parts, even if this is a good way to get all of Madge's 90s hits at once." [...] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine commented that [...] "GHV2 certainly encapsulates the second decade of the performer's boundary-bridging career", but criticized the lack of new material, and its [...] "choppy edits, random sequences and missing links", saying: [...] "the collection doesn't seem to do justice to a career that has always been <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> and focused on the future". Charlotte Robinson from PopMatters criticized its sequencing, stating, [...] "Chronological sequencing would have made it easier to follow the course of Madonna's musical evolution. But would these changes have made GHV2 a significantly better album? Probably not. As it stands, it's the best summary of Madonna's second decade as a performer we're going to get." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} {{learned from}} an ex-MI5 officer {{that it is}} common for intelligence gatherers who spend most of their work listening in to other people {{to fall in love with}} civilians through just their voices. This story was the basis of Ruth wanting to go out with John in [...] "Love and Death". Khoury based [...] "Outsiders" [...] on Internet security. He already became intoned with the area, as he once worked with an internet company. Although the story is dramatised, Khoury did research on what was feasible, such as if one man and a laptop could theoretically bring Britain to its knees. Also in the episode, the G algorithm is based on an actual computer programme. [...] "Frequently Asked Questions" [...] deals with interrogation and torture. Walters realised that torture is counterproductive as the suspects can say anything the interrogators want to hear, but rationalises that Adam is an expert in that field. To get the interrogation as true as possible, the producers consulted with ex-Army advisors who were trained in questioning terror suspects. As the episode was first broadcast, a prison abuse scandal in Iraq was put on the news. In response to this, Kudos director Stephen Garrett stated [...] "Spooks is really well researched and sometimes we look like we're <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> It's just we know stuff that's happening, and it'll come out in the news a bit later on." [...] In the same episode, the weapons caches came from a true story that the Russians hid weapons in Britain during the Cold War, according to Collins.|$|E
500|$|Preproduction began around August 1997 {{and lasted}} about six months. The six-person team came from Looking Glass's Austin studios. Spector, the team's {{director}} and producer, saw {{their work as}} improving upon the foundation provided by Origin, Looking Glass, and Valve Corporation by doing what those companies did not. The game's working title was Shooter: Majestic Revelations, with a scheduled release of Christmas 1998. The working title {{was meant to be}} ironic because they did not want the game to be solely a first-person shooter. They worked on the setting <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> mechanics, and decided on a conspiracy-style story that referenced existing conspiracy theories such as Area 51, CIA drug trafficking, the John F. Kennedy assassination, the Majestic 12, and a Masonic underground bunker beneath Denver International Airport. Spector said their research helped them understand how conspiracy theorists think. The team was also able to look to the real world in 1997 to find the rise of stories about terrorists and mechanically-augmented soldiers {{that they were able to}} build upon. They also used this time to work out the backstory for constancy. The team designed over 200 characters without associated in-game roles, which was both helpful when designing missions and unhelpful as they attempted to reduce their scope. In the third quarter of 1997, Spector wrote a [...] "manifesto" [...] on his ideal game and the [...] "rules of role-playing" [...] that was later published in the February 1999 Game Developer magazine. His principles included [...] "problems, not puzzles", [...] "no forced failure", [...] "players do; NPCs watch", and [...] "areas with multiple entrance and exit points".
