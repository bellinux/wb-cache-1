25|$|Abnormal {{scapular}} {{function is}} called scapular dyskinesis. One action the scapula performs during a throwing or serving motion is {{elevation of the}} acromion process {{in order to avoid}} impingement of the rotator cuff tendons. If the scapula fails to properly elevate the acromion, impingement may occur during the cocking and <b>acceleration</b> <b>phase</b> of an overhead activity. The two muscles most commonly inhibited during this first part of an overhead motion are the serratus anterior and the lower trapezius. These two muscles act as a force couple within the glenohumeral joint to properly elevate the acromion process, and if a muscle imbalance exists, shoulder impingement may develop.|$|E

The nature and speeds of these phases inform {{the character of the}} transition highlighting the importance of the barriers and drivers identified.

5000|$|The <b>acceleration</b> <b>phase</b> is {{initiated}} {{once the}} projectile begins its forward motion, {{which is also}} {{about the same time}} as the stride foot makes contact with the ground. The <b>acceleration</b> <b>phase</b> is the most explosive part of the overhead throwing motion, as the projectile’s velocity increases from zero to its maximum velocity in this short amount of time. The ball is brought forward while the thrower's body rotates towards the target starting from the stride foot, moving up to the pelvis, followed by the trunk and spinal rotation, and then up to the shoulders. Although not visibly obvious, trunk muscular control is an important factor in high velocity throwing [...] During this phase the thrower's trunk will tilt to the side opposite the throwing arm to allow for greater distance of acceleration, which transfers more energy to the projectile. The <b>acceleration</b> <b>phase</b> ends at the time of the projectile's release from the hand, at which point it has attained its maximum velocity.|$|E

50|$|Race {{tracks are}} often {{broken down into}} {{separate}} elements such as standard corners, chicanes, double apexes, and straights.

50|$|In 2005, Hunter et al. {{conducted}} a study that determined relationships between sprint velocity and relative impulses in which gait and ground reaction force data was collected and analyzed. It was found that during accelerated runs, a typical support phase {{is characterized by a}} breaking phase followed by a propulsive phase (-FH followed by + FH). A common trend in the fastest subjects tested was that there was only a moderate to low amount of vertical force and a large amount of horizontal forces produced. Post study, it was hypothesized by the author that braking forces are necessary to store elastic energy in muscle and tendon tissue. This study loosely confirmed the importance of horizontal as well as vertical GRF during the <b>acceleration</b> <b>phase</b> of sprinting. Unfortunately, since data were collected at the 16-m mark, it was insufficient to draw definite conclusions regarding the entire <b>acceleration</b> <b>phase.</b>|$|E

30|$|The passive {{effect of}} the soft tissues is {{isolated}} when the humerus is abducted ninety-degrees from the thorax and the humerus is maximally externally rotated. This position coincides with the late cocking/early <b>acceleration</b> <b>phases</b> of the throwing motion, when the throwing athlete’s shoulder experiences the greatest strain, is most vulnerable to injury, and passively stabilized. For the clinical and sports biomechanics community, understanding the forces at this extreme range of motion offers the greatest opportunity for injury prevention, improved rehabilitation, and advancing surgical treatments of shoulder pathology.|$|R
30|$|The {{objective}} is to damp frequency oscillations quickly by controlling the acceleration and deceleration terms. For instance, a larger J would present a stronger opposition to both the RoCoF and the frequency deviation during <b>acceleration</b> <b>phases</b> (a to b and c to d). On the other hand, a smaller J would boost the deceleration of the frequency more rapidly during deceleration phases (b to c and d to e). In addition, a larger D would attenuate the frequency amplitude of the oscillations more quickly and stabilize the system faster in all segments.|$|R

50|$|A torque {{converter}} cannot achieve 100 percent coupling efficiency. The classic three element {{torque converter}} has an efficiency curve that resembles ∩: zero efficiency at stall, generally increasing efficiency during the <b>acceleration</b> <b>phase</b> and low efficiency in the coupling phase. The loss of efficiency as the converter enters the coupling phase {{is a result}} of the turbulence and fluid flow interference generated by the stator, and as previously mentioned, is commonly overcome by mounting the stator on a one-way clutch.|$|E
40|$|The {{nonlinear}} {{evolution of}} collisionless magnetic reconnection {{in the presence}} of a strong guide field is analyzed on the basis of a gyrofluid model for compressible plasmas.

50|$|During {{the stall}} and <b>acceleration</b> <b>phases,</b> in which torque {{multiplication}} occurs, the stator remains stationary {{due to the}} action of its one-way clutch. However, as the torque converter approaches the coupling phase, the energy and volume of the fluid returning from the turbine will gradually decrease, causing pressure on the stator to likewise decrease. Once in the coupling phase, the returning fluid will reverse direction and now rotate {{in the direction of}} the impeller and turbine, an effect which will attempt to forward-rotate the stator. At this point, the stator clutch will release and the impeller, turbine and stator will all (more or less) turn as a unit.|$|R
50|$|The {{overhead}} throwing motion can {{be divided}} into phases which include windup, early cocking, late cocking, early acceleration, late acceleration, deceleration, and follow-through. Training for pitchers often includes targeting one or several of these phases. Biomechanical evaluations are sometimes done on individual pitchers to help determine points of inefficiency. Mechanical measurements that are assessed include, but are not limited to, foot position at stride foot contact (SFC), elbow flexion during arm cocking and <b>acceleration</b> <b>phases,</b> maximal external rotation during arm cocking, horizontal abduction at SFC, arm abduction, lead knee position during arm cocking, trunk tilt, peak angular velocity of throwing arm and angle of wrist.|$|R

50|$|In November 1946 the NII-1 NKAP {{research}} institute was formed with mathematician Mstislav Vsevolodovich Keldysh as its head {{to investigate and}} develop the German Sänger-Bredt design. In 1947, studies indicated that the high fuel consumption of Sänger's rocket-based design rendered the concept impracticable in the short term. Using engines which {{were considered to be}} available in a reasonable timespan, 95% of the vehicle's initial mass would have to be propellant. However, use of ramjets during the <b>acceleration</b> <b>phase</b> would give the craft a more reasonable 22% dead weight and still achieve the 5 km/s velocity required for a 12,000 km intercontinental range.|$|E
50|$|In {{aerospace}} engineering, {{especially those}} areas dealing with spacecraft, the eigenvector slew {{is a method}} to calculate a steering correction (called a slew) by rotating the spacecraft around one fixed axis, or a gimbal. This corresponds in general to the fastest and {{most efficient way to}} reach the desired target orientation as there is only one <b>acceleration</b> <b>phase</b> and one braking phase for the angular rate.
