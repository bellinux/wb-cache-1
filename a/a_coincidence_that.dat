5|$|In 1956, over 9,000 socialist and populist {{politicians}} were released from prison. A few Jewish functionaries {{of the security}} forces were brought to court in the process of de-Stalinization. According to Heather Laskey, it was not <b>a</b> <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> the high ranking Stalinist security officers put on trial by Gomułka were Jews. Władysław Gomułka was captured by Światło, imprisoned by Romkowski in 1951 and interrogated by both, him and Fejgin. Gomułka escaped physical torture only as a close associate of Joseph Stalin, and was released three years later. According to some sources, the categorization {{of the security forces}} as a Jewish institution—as disseminated in the post-war anticommunist press at various times—was rooted in Żydokomuna: the belief that the secret police was predominantly Jewish became one of the factors contributing to the post-war view of Jews as agents of the security forces.|$|E

The state government {{said that the}} victims were not chosen in any way and Sonboly did not know any of them. Police thought it was <b>a</b> <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> all of the fatalities were of immigrant backgrounds, as the McDonald's near the shopping mall was patronised by the children of migrants.|$|E

There were no untoward incidents except destruction of telephone and telegraph wires near Lyallpur Railway Station. But a huge mass of dry husk near the station caught fire {{and as a result}} 2-3 people burnt alive. It was <b>a</b> <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> Lyallpuri was on the station at the moment. Early morning on 22 April, English police fully loaded with machine-guns laid siege to Lyallpur and arrested 12 people including Lyallpuri.|$|E
25|$|In 1704, Chastelein bought another land {{which later}} he named Weltevreden. In this new estate he {{established}} the first experimental coffee plantation in the Indies, {{as well as}} the first Indies zoo. In the estate of Depok he created a pepper plantation. It can not be <b>a</b> <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> Chastelein had let this family work in Depok, slave families like Laurens and Loen from Ambon. During the period he wrote a dissertation in which he established an ethical manifestation against Dutch East India Company's merchant politics, especially toward Governor General Willem van Outhoorn, who was in favor of aggressive trade policy.|$|E
25|$|Evacuation Day is {{a holiday}} {{observed}} on March 17 in Suffolk County, Massachusetts (which includes {{the cities of}} Boston, Chelsea, and Revere, {{and the town of}} Winthrop) and also by the public schools in Somerville, Massachusetts. The holiday commemorates the evacuation of British forces from the city of Boston following the Siege of Boston, early in the American Revolutionary War. Schools and government offices (including some Massachusetts state government offices located in Suffolk County) are closed. If March 17 falls on a weekend, schools and government offices are closed on the following Monday in observance.

25|$|The {{day of the}} battle, {{known in}} Serbian as Vidovdan (St. Vitus' day), is an {{important}} part of Serb ethnic and Serbian national identity, with notable events in Serbian history falling on that day, among which are: in 1876 Serbia declared war on the Ottoman Empire (Serbian–Ottoman War (1876–78)); in 1881 Austria-Hungary and the Principality of Serbia signed a secret alliance; in 1914 the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria was carried out by Gavrilo Princip (although <b>a</b> <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> his visit fell on that day, Vidovdan added nationalist symbolism to the event); in 1921 Serbian king Alexander I proclaimed the Vidovdan Constitution; in 1989, on the 600th anniversary of the battle, Serbian political leader Slobodan Milošević delivered the Gazimestan speech on the site of the historic battle, etc.|$|E
25|$|On the {{accession}} of Ismail Pasha, Nubar Bey was in {{the prime}} of life.

Ismail, himself a more capable man than his immediate predecessors, at once recognized the ability of Nubar, and charged him with a mission to Constantinople, not only to notify his accession, but to smooth the way for the many ambitious projects he already entertained, notably the completion of the Suez Canal, the change in title to that of khedive and the change in the order of succession.|$|E
25|$|On August 6 and August 7, the Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader visited Dubrovnik, {{which was}} {{followed}} by fires in that area. It prompted some county officials to make arson accusations against {{the nearby town of}} Trebinje in the neighboring Bosnia and Herzegovina. Mario Magud, the firefighting commander in Konavle, said: There are no firemen on the Trebinje side. Everything indicates that they set the fire themselves with the intention to burn Konavle and beyond. It's not <b>a</b> <b>coincidence</b> <b>that,</b> as soon as we localize one fire, a new fire breaks out.. Luka Korda, the chief of Konavle municipality, made similar accusations. The Bosnian civil defense secretary Stanko Slišković said it was not true that the Bosnian firemen did not do anything to prevent fires in the border area near Dubrovnik: Our people made the greatest effort to fight every fire where it was possible. Nobody can say with certainty where a fire started... I'm sorry this happened and I understand the indignation of the citizens of Dubrovnik, but it's not our fault. He claimed that the Bosnian civil defense cooperated well with their Croatian counterparts and said that the Bosnian forces could not fight the fires in the inaccessible or mined areas.|$|E

Banner agrees that it may not be <b>a</b> <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> Monroe launched a trend of platinum blonde actresses during the Civil Rights Movement, but has also criticized Dyer, pointing out that in her highly publicized private life Monroe associated with people who were seen as [...] "white ethnics", such as Joe DiMaggio (Italian-American) and Arthur Miller (Jewish). According to Banner, she sometimes challenged prevailing racial norms in her publicity photographs; for example, in an image featured in Look in 1951, she was shown in revealing clothes while practicing with African-American singing coach Phil Moore.|$|E

In an interview with Vibe in April 1995, while serving time in Clinton Correctional Facility, Shakur accused Uptown Records' founder Andre Harrell, Sean Combs, and Wallace of having prior knowledge of a robbery that resulted in him being shot five times and losing thousands {{of dollars worth of}} jewelry on the night of November 30, 1994. Though Wallace and his entourage were in the same Manhattan-based recording studio {{at the time of the}} shooting, they denied the accusation. Wallace said: [...] "It just happened to be <b>a</b> <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> he [...] was in the studio. He just, he couldn't really say who really had something to do with it at the time.

500|$|The first charter {{produced}} by [...] "Æthelstan A" [...] in 928 described the king as rex Anglorum, [...] "king of the English", {{the first time}} that title had been used. By 931 he had become [...] "king of the English, elevated by the right hand of the Almighty to the throne of the whole kingdom of Britain". Some charters were witnessed by Welsh kings, and occasionally by the kings of Scotland and Strathclyde, signifying acceptance of Æthelstan's lordship. In Keynes's view, it cannot be <b>a</b> <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> the charters commenced immediately after the conquest of Northumbria, and [...] "Æthelstan A"'s primary aim was to display the [...] "grandeur of Æthelstan's kingship". Foot argues that the king's inner circle quickly seized on the potential of the conquest for [...] "ideological aggrandizement of the king's public standing". To Keynes, the diplomas [...] "are symbolic of a monarchy invigorated by success, developing the pretensions commensurate with its actual achievements and clothing itself in the trappings of a new political order." [...] He sees the fifty years from 925 to 975 as [...] "the golden age of the Anglo-Saxon royal diploma".|$|E

500|$|Scholars such as Charles Oman {{note that}} {{one element of}} the children's account, the entry into a {{different}} reality {{by way of a}} cave, seems to have been quite popular. Gerald of Wales tells a similar story of a boy who, after escaping his master, [...] "encountered two pigmies who led him through an underground passage into a beautiful land with fields and rivers, but not lit by the full light of the sun". But the motif is poorly attested; E. W. Baughman lists it as the only example of his F103.1 category of English and North American folk tale motifs: [...] "Inhabitants of lower world visit mortals, and continue to live with them". Martin Walsh considers the references to St Martin to be significant, and sees the story of the green children as evidence that the feast of Martinmas has its origins in an English aboriginal past, of which the children's story forms [...] "the lowest stratum". [...] suggests a Celtic connection in a 1900 edition of Notes and Queries: [...] "'Green' spirits are 'sinless' in Celtic literature and tradition...

The song was to feature backing vocals by several of Jackson's brothers [...] and would be included in a two-disc album, This Is It. It was also confirmed that the song would be featured during the end credits of the movie production. Sony said, in response to the reports, that it was <b>a</b> <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> his upcoming concert series was also titled [...] "This Is It," [...] explaining they had no evidence that he had planned to release the song. However, John McClain and John Branca, two representatives of Jackson's estate said, in a prepared statement, that [...] "This Is It" [...] was [...] "picked because the lyrics were appropriate because of the name Michael [...] gave his tour" [...] and that they were [...] "thrilled to present" [...] the song.|$|E
500|$|Many Muslims saw the {{cartoons}} {{as a sign}} of lack of education about Islam in Denmark and in the West.

Do not say that this is the task of the ulema (religious scholars)it is the task of all of us." [...] Ana Soage said, [...] "the targeting of a religious symbol like Muhammad, the only prophet that Muslims do not share with Jews and Christians, was perceived as the last in a long list of humiliations and assaults: it is probably not <b>a</b> <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> the more violent demonstrations were held in countries like Syria, Iran and Libya, whose relations with the West are tense." [...] Yusuf al-Qaradawi, a prominent Islamic theologian, called for a day of anger from Muslims in response to {{the cartoons}}. He supported calls for a UN resolution that [...] "categorically prohibits affronts to prophetsto the prophets of the Lord and His messengers, to His holy books, and to the religious holy places". He also castigated governments around the world for inaction on the issue, saying, [...] "Your silence over such crimes, which offend the Prophet of Islam and insult his great nation, is what begets violence, generates terrorism, and makes the terrorists say: Our governments are doing nothing, and we must avenge our Prophet ourselves.
