In the present study an attempt has been made toinvestigate the behaviour of exterior beam-column joint withdifferent detailing of reinforcement, different spacing ofconnecting ties and with different percentage of steel fibres. Initially three specimens (SP 1, SP 2 and SP 3) with differentdetailing of reinforcement were tested. Then specimen SP 2 wasselected for further investigation based on its structuralperformance and ease of detailing. Two more Specimens weretested with different spacing of ties/stirrups. Finally, toinvestigate the effect of addition of fibres on behaviour ofperformance of joints, three specimens (SP 6, SP 7 and SP 8) withvolume fractions of 0. 5 %, 1. 0 % and 1. 5 % steel fibres were castand tested. The results obtained from the investigation indicated thataddition of steel fibres in the concrete mix improved structuralperformance of beam column joints measured in terms ofultimate load carrying capacity, stiffness, crack width, deflectionand curvature ductility factor. Steel fibre reinforced concrete isone of the possible alternative solutions for reducing thecongestion of transverse reinforcement in beam column joints.

Multiple molecular <b>mechanisms</b> capable of <b>arresting</b> the cell cycle {{have been identified in}} mammalian cells; however, it is unknown whether each mechanism meets all 3 requirements or whether they act together to confer specific functions to the arrest.

This system exhibits both gel and glass phases and we show that the competition between these two <b>arrest</b> <b>mechanisms</b> {{can result in a}} complex, three-step decay of the time correlation functions, controlled by two different localization lengthscales. For certain combinations of the parameters, this competition gives rise to an anomalous logarithmic decay of the correlation functions and a subdiffusive particle motion, which can be understood as a simple crossover effect between the two relaxation processes. We establish a simple criterion for this logarithmic decay to be observed. We also find a further logarithmically slow relaxation related to the relaxation of floppy clusters of particles in a crowded environment, in agreement with recent findings in other models for dense chemical gels. Finally, we characterize how the competition of gel and glass <b>arrest</b> <b>mechanisms</b> affects the dynamical heterogeneities and show that for certain combination of parameters these heterogeneities can be unusually large. By measuring the four-point dynamical susceptibility, we probe the cooperativity of the motion and find that with increasing coupling this cooperativity shows a maximum before it decreases again, indicating the change {{in the nature of the}} relaxation dynamics.

40|$|Progression {{through the}} cell cycle is tightly controlled, and the {{decision}} {{whether or not to}} enter a new cell cycle can be influenced by both internal and external cues. For budding yeast one such external cue is pheromone treatment, which can induce G 1 <b>arrest.</b> Two distinct <b>mechanisms</b> are known to be involved in this arrest, one dependent on the arrest protein Far 1 and one independent of Far 1, but the exact mechanisms have remained enigmatic. The studies presented here further elucidate both of these mechanisms. We looked at two distinct aspects of the Far 1 -independent <b>arrest</b> <b>mechanism.</b> First, we studied the role of the G 1 /S regulatory system in G 1 arrest. We found that deletion of the G 1 /S transcriptional repressors Whi 5 and Stb 1 compromises Far 1 -independent arrest, but only partially, and that this partial arrest failure correlates to partial de-repression of G 1 /S transcripts. Deletion of the CKI Sic 1, however, is more strongly required for arrest in the absence of Far 1, though not when Far 1 is present. Together, this demonstrates that functionally overlapping regulatory circuits controlling the G 1 /S transition collectively provide robustness to the G 1 arrest response. We also sought to reexamine the phenomenon of pheromone-induced loss of G 1 /S cyclin proteins, which we suspected could be another Far 1 -independent <b>arrest</b> <b>mechanism.</b> We confirmed that pheromone treatment has an effect on G 1 cyclin protein levels independent of transcriptional control. Our findings suggest that this phenomenon is dependent on SCFGrr 1 but is at least partly independent of Cdc 28 activity, the CDK phosphorylation sites in Cln 2, and Far 1. We were not, however, able to obtain evidence that pheromone increases the degradation rate of Cln 1 / 2, which raises the possibility that pheromone reduces their synthesis rate instead. Finally, we also studied the function of Far 1 during pheromone-induced G 1 arrest. Although it has been assumed that Far 1 acts as a G 1 /S cyclin specific CDK inhibitor, there has been no conclusive evidence that this is the case. Our data, however, suggests that at least part of Far 1 ’s function may actually be to interfere with Cln-CDK/substrate interactions since we saw a significant decrease of co-pulldown of Cln 2 and substrates after treatment with pheromone. All together, the results presented here demonstrate that there are numerous independent mechanisms in place to help robustly arrest cells in G 1...|$|R

We find the structures responsible for the colour are continuous in their size and spatially controlled by the degree of spinodal phase separation in the corresponding region of the feather barb. Blue structures have a well-defined broadband ultra-violet (UV) to blue wavelength distribution; the corresponding nanostructure has characteristic spinodal morphology with a lengthscale of order 150 nm. White regions have a larger 200 nm nanostructure, consistent with a spinodal process that has coarsened further, yielding broader wavelength white reflectance. Our analysis shows that nanostructure in single bird feather barbs can be varied continuously by controlling the time the keratin network is allowed to phase separate before mobility in the system is arrested. Dynamic scaling analysis of the single barb scattering data implies that the phase separation <b>arrest</b> <b>mechanism</b> is rapid and also distinct from the spinodal phase separation mechanism i. e. it is not gelation or intermolecular re-association.

In addition, the machining-affected layer is shown to be on the order of 1 mm, easily on the same length scale as the wall thickness of aerospace structures...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDeregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) is {{implicated in}} tumor progression. We attempt to indentify the tumor suppressive miRNA not only down-regulated in {{glioblastoma}} multiforme (GBM) but also potent to inhibit the oncogene EZH 2, and then investigate the biological function and pathophysiologic {{role of the}} candidate miRNA in GBM. In this study, we show that miRNA- 138 is reduced in both GBM clinical specimens and cell lines, and is effective to inhibit EZH 2 expression. Moreover, high levels of miR- 138 are associated with long overall and progression-free survival of GBM patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset (TCGA) data portal. Ectopic expression of miRNA- 138 effectively inhibits GBM cell proliferation in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo through inducing cell cycles G 1 /S <b>arrest.</b> <b>Mechanism</b> investigation reveals that miRNA- 138 acquires tumor inhibition through directly targeting EZH 2, CDK 6, E 2 F 2 and E 2 F 3. Moreover, an EZH 2 -mediated signal loop, EZH 2 -CDK 4 / 6 -pRb-E 2 F 1, is probably involved in GBM tumorigenicity, and this loop can be blocked by miRNA- 138. Additionally, miRNA- 138 negatively correlates to mRNA levels of EZH 2 and CDK 6 among GBM clinical samples from both TCGA and our small amount datasets. In conclusion, our data demonstrate a tumor suppressive role of miRNA- 138 in GBM tumorigenicity, suggesting a potential application in GBM therapy...|$|R
