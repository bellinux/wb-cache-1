Diamond says that these natural endowments began with the dawn of man, and favored Eurasian civilizations due to their location along similar latitudes, suitable farming climate, and early animal domestication.|$|E

This practice is opposed by a variety of human rights groups, including Organs Watch, a group established by medical anthropologists, which was instrumental in exposing illegal international organ selling rings. These patients may have increased complications owing to poor infection control and lower medical and surgical standards.

The group opened by expressing that the 2009 administration change did little to the [...] " [...] neoliberal politics of both parties", claiming that both exploit demagogue to entice voters but that in reality they [...] "only serve the bourgeoisie of the United States of Puerto Rico, among which are the bankers, developers and contractors". However, the organization did differentiate Fortuño from his predecessor, claiming that that [...] "as a fervent servant of the Republican neoliberal capitalism" [...] he employed [...] "an strategy to downsize the government, privatize anything that is of interest to bond and capital holders and to eliminate all that is preserving {{the culture of the}} Puerto Rican nation alive". The Macheteros expressed concern that this administration wanted to portray the wealthy <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> the economic crisis, [...] "which are really the fault of all government administrations, including Mr. Fortuño's". The group also disregarded all measures adopted by the legislature, which in their view only responded to the economic interests of the wealthy, which they considered [...] "perhaps the worst of all" [...] and warning the PPD legislators led by Hector Ferrer that [...] "weak opposition [...] into accomplices".|$|E

Kierkegaard believed that there is no human-comprehensible purpose of God, making faith in God absurd itself. Camus on the other hand states that to believe in God is to [...] "deny one of the terms of the contradiction" [...] between humanity and the universe (and is therefore not absurd but what he calls [...] "philosophical suicide"). Camus (as well as Kierkegaard), though, suggests that while absurdity does not lead to belief in God, neither does it lead to the denial of God.

2500|$|Mixers, {{disturbed}} by the edicts of the PSC having so much influence in their daily practice, created the American Chiropractic Association (one of the early precursors to today's ACA). Though born out of necessity to defend against the UCA attacks, the ACA's stated purposes were to advance education and research for chiropractic. Its growth was initially stunted by its resolution to recognize physio-therapy and other modalities as pertaining to chiropractic. What growth did occur was credited to its second president, Frank R. Margetts, DC with support from his alma mater, National Chiropractic College. He insisted that no college administrator could hold an official position in the association, giving doctors in the field a collective voice. But a disagreement within the UCA in 1924 turned the tide for the ACA. B.J. was still working to purge mixers from practicing chiropractic, and he saw a new invention by Dossa D. Evans, the [...] "Neurocalometer" [...] (NCM), <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> all of straight chiropractic's (and particularly PSC's) legal and financial problems. As {{the owner of the}} patent on the NCM, he planned {{to limit the number of}} NCMs to 5000 and lease them only to graduates of the Palmer related schools who were members of the UCA. He then claimed that the NCM was the only way to accurately locate subluxations, preventing over 20,000 mixers from being able to defend their method of practice.|$|E
2500|$|The {{ecological}} {{problems faced}} by the world today are {{partly due to the}} loss of traditional knowledge, values, and ethics of behavior that celebrate the intrinsic value and sacredness of the natural world and that give the preservation of Nature prime importance. Correspondingly, the assumption of human superiority to other life forms, as if we were granted royalty status over Nature; the idea that Nature is mainly here to serve human will and purpose. Deep ecology had a response to the anthropocentric view and several different actors played a role in its development. Prominent among them is Joseph W. Meeker, who in 1973 told George Sessions about Arne Næss, whom Meeker knew personally. As Warwick Fox related, [...] "One of the things that initially interested Sessions about Næss was Næss's strong interest in, and innovative approach to, the work of Spinoza. Sessions says that he had himself 'arrived at Spinoza <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> the process of teaching history of philosophy by about 1972 and independently of being in contact with Næss.'" [...] Sessions therefore wrote to Næss at this time, beginning a lifelong association. Meeker's (1972, 1997) book The Comedy of Survival: Studies in Literary Ecology emerged through the work of scholars seeking an environmental ethic. That book represents Meeker's founding work in literary ecology and ecocriticism, which demonstrates the relationship between the literary arts and scientific ecology, especially humankind's consideration of comedy and tragedy. It reminds readers that adaptive behaviors (comedy) promote survival, whereas tragedy estranges from other life forms. This thesis rests on Meeker's study of comparative literature, his work with biologist Konrad Lorenz, and his work as a field ecologist in the National Park service in Alaska, Oregon, and California.|$|E
