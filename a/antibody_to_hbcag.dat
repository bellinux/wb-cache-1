Their serologic profile and clinical outcome are described. Nine out of 30 patients were HBsAg positive before BMT: four were chronic carriers and five were found HBsAg+ at transplant. Three of the former {{and one of the}} five latter patients remained persistently HBsAg+ after transplant with signs of liver disease; none developed liver failure, indicating that HBsAg positivity is not an absolute contra-indication to BMT. Among the remaining 21 patients. HBsAg was detected early (n = 12) or late (n = 9) after transplant.

40|$|A quantitation {{procedure}} for hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) in serum without prior removal of <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> <b>HBcAg</b> is described. The virus nucleoprotein core {{was released from}} hepatitis B virus (HBV) particles by treatment with Nonidet P- 40 detergent and allowed to form immune complexes with homologous <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> <b>HBcAg</b> present in the sera of HBV-infected individuals. After precipitation with 2. 0 % polyethylene glycol- 1. 5 % Tween 20, the HBcAg immune complexes were dissociated by treatment with 3 M KSCN and then adsorbed onto polystyrene beads {{in the presence of}} the SCN- ions. Thereby, <b>HBcAg</b> and <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> <b>HBcAg</b> were linked independently of each other to the matrix, and the core antigen could be quantitated directly by incubation of the beads with 125 I-labeled anti-HBc. Even in the presence of an excess of <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> <b>HBcAg</b> in the polyethylene glycol precipitates, HBcAg could be detected without appreciably affecting the sensitivity. The assay proved to be specific for core determinants and exhibited excellent reproducibility. The application of the HBcAg assay in 185 hepatitis B e antigen-positive sera revealed HBc antigenemia in 99 % of the sera containing hepatitis B e antigen at titers of greater than or equal to 1 : 256 and 43 % of the sera with lower hepatitis B e antigen levels. However, only in 6 of the 34 HBcAg-negative sera could HBV DNA be detected by blot hybridization. When correlated with HBV-associated DNA polymerase (DNAP) activity, HBc antigenemia was found in all DNAP-positive sera (n = 95) and in 39 % of the hepatitis B e antigen-positive sera without detectable DNAP activity (n = 44). Of the DNAP-negative sera with HBc antigenemia, 94 % contained HBV DNA, whereas in the absence of HBcAg, HBV DNA could be detected only in 3 of 27 DNAP-negative sera.

Of the sixty-five HBsAg positive livers, fifty-three were histologically diagnosed as chronic hepatitis, three as acute hepatitis, five as acute hepatitis with signs of transition to chronicity, and four as 'near normal liver'. In the group with chronic hepatitis, HGcAg was observed in thirty-nine livers, all of which also had HBsAg. Thirty-five of these thirty-nine cases also had the ability to fix complement in vitro in the hepatocyte nuclei and/or cytoplasm. Of these thirty-five cases, twenty-nine were positive for immunoglobulin deposition on the nuclei. All of these cases had <b>antibody</b> <b>to</b> <b>HBcAg</b> in the blood, but only five had anti-HBs. The frequency of in vitro complement fixation and immunoglobulin deposition was higher in active forms of the disease, such as chronic aggressive hepatitis and active cirrhosis, than in non-active disease such as chronic persistent hepatitis and mild cirrhosis. By the application of double fluorescent staining techniques, complement fixation was observed in some HBcAg-positive nuclei. In the 'near normal liver' cases there was no intrahepatic accumulation of HBcAg, and despite the presence of anti-HBc in the blood, in vitro complement fixation and immunoglobulin deposition were both absent. The group of three HBsAg ositive 'acute hepatitis with signs of transition to chronicity' cases behaved similarly to those with chronic aggressive hepatitis and had circulating anti-HBc, in vitro complement fixation and immunoglobulin deposition in the hepatocytes.

40|$|AIM: To {{assess the}} {{prevalence}} of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and association with drug induced liver injury (DILI) in patients undergoing anti-tuberculosis (TB) therapy. METHODS: Four hundred and twenty nine patients with newly diagnosed TB - either active disease or latent infection - who were due to commence anti-TB therapy between September 2008 and May 2011 were included. These patients were prospectively tested for serological markers of HBV, HCV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections - hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B e antigen, IgG and IgM <b>antibody</b> <b>to</b> <b>HBcAg</b> (anti-HBc), HCV IgG antibody and HIV antibody {{using a combination of}} enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Western blot assay and polymerase chain reaction techniques. Patients were reviewed at least monthly during the TB treatment initiation phase. Liver function tests were measured prior to commencement of anti-TB therapy and 2 - 4 wk later. Liver function tests were also performed at any time the patient had significant nausea, vomiting, rash, or felt non-specifically unwell. Fisher’s exact test was used to measure significance in comparisons of proportions between groups. A P value of less than 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Of the 429 patients, 270 (62. 9 %) had active TB disease and 159 (37. 1 %) had latent TB infection. 61 (14. 2 %) patients had isolated anti-HBc positivity, 11 (2. 6 %) were also HBsAg positive and 7 (1. 6 %) were HCV-antibody positive. 16 / 270 patients with active TB disease compared to 2 / 159 patients with latent TB infection had markers of chronic viral hepatitis (HBsAg or HCV antibody positive; P = 0. 023). Similarly the proportion of HBsAg positive patients were significantly greater in the active vs latent TB infection group (10 / 43 vs 1 / 29, P = 0. 04). The prevalence of chronic HBV or HCV was significantly higher than the estimated United Kingdom prevalence of 0. 3 % for each. We found no association between DILI and presence of serological markers of HBV or HCV. Three (5. 3 %) patients with serological markers of HBV or HCV infection had DILI compared to 25 (9. 5 %) patients without; P = 0. 04.

40|$|Previous studies located T-cell {{recognition}} of the nucleocapsid of the hepatitis B virus (<b>HBcAg)</b> <b>to</b> residues 120 - 140 in mice bearing the H- 2 s or H- 2 b haplotypes. Herein, we demonstrate that B 10. S (H- 2 s) and B 10 (H- 2 b) H- 2 congenic strains recognize distinct T-cell sites within the p 120 - 140 (a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 120 - 140 of HBcAg) sequence defined by p 120 - 131 and p 129 - 140, respectively. Peptide p 120 - 131 stimulates B 10. S HBcAg-primed T cells, and reciprocally p 120 - 131 -primed T cells recognize HBcAg. Similarly, the p 129 - 140 sequence is a T-cell recognition site relevant <b>to</b> the native <b>HBcAg</b> in the B 10 strain. It is also shown that these 12 -residue peptides efficiently prime T-helper cells, which are capable of eliciting <b>antibody</b> production <b>to</b> <b>HBcAg</b> in vivo. These observations prompted us to examine {{the ability of the}} HBcAg-specific p 120 - 140 sequence to function as a T-cell carrier moiety as a component of a totally synthetic hepatitis B vaccine. For this purpose a synthetic B-cell epitope from the pre-S(2) region (p 133 - 140) of the viral envelope was chosen because this sequence represents a dominant antibody-binding site of the envelope. Immunization of B 10. S and B 10 strains with the synthetic composite peptide c 120 - 140 -(133 - 140) elicited anti-peptide antibody production, which was crossreactive with the native viral envelope. Furthermore, c 120 - 140 -(133 - 140) immunization primed p 120 - 131 -specific T cells in the B 10. S strain and p 129 - 140 -specific T cells in the B 10 strain, which recognized HBcAg and provided T-helper cell function for anti-envelope antibody production in vivo. These results demonstrate the feasibility of constructing complex synthetic immunogens that represent multiple proteins of a pathogen and are capable of engaging both T and B cells relevant to the native antigens...|$|R

Interleukin (IL) - 10 {{is a potent}} immunosuppressive cytokine which we reported recently to be secreted in response <b>to</b> <b>HBcAg</b> by {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMCs) from patients with chronic HBV infection or healthy controls. Using an enzyme-linked immunospot assay, we compared the ability of <b>HBcAg</b> <b>to</b> stimulate IL- 10 production by PBMC with that of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), phytohaemagglutinin-P and hepatitis C virus-derived antigens in 16 patients with chronic HBV infection and six healthy controls. Frequencies of IL- 10 spot-forming cells (SFC) in response <b>to</b> <b>HBcAg</b> were comparable <b>to</b> those obtained with LPS in patients with chronic HBV infection. Frequencies of IL- 10 SFC in response <b>to</b> <b>HBcAg</b> or <b>to</b> LPS were significantly higher in patients with chronic HBV infection than in healthy controls. IL- 10 SFC in response <b>to</b> <b>HBcAg</b> consisted of 26 – 35 % T cells, 62 – 70 % monocytes and less than 1 % B cells in patients with chronic HBV infection. Only monocytes contributed to IL- 10 production in controls.

40|$|Background and Aims: Acute {{exacerbations}} (AEs) of perinatally-acquired {{chronic hepatitis}} B (CHB) {{are accompanied by}} increased T cell responses to hepatitis B core and e antigens (HBcAg & HBeAg). Naturally-arising forkhead transcription factor Foxp 3 (forkhead box p 3) -expressing CD 4 +CD 25 + regulatory T (Treg) cells {{are thought to be}} important in the control of infectious diseases. This study aimed to investigate whether HBcAg-specific Treg cells play a role in modulating spontaneous AEs and in influencing the outcome of anti-hepatitis B virus (HBV) treatments. Methods: The SYFPEITHI scoring system was employed to predict epitope peptides on HBcAg overlapping with HBeAg for the construction of peptide-HLA class II tetramers to measure HBcAg-specific Treg cell frequencies (Treg f). Results: HBcAg-specific Treg f declined significantly in association with increased HBcAg-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte frequencies during spontaneous AEs without treatment. Vigorous in vitro expansion of CD 4 +CD 25 + Treg cells from CHB patients responding <b>to</b> <b>HBcAg</b> and/or its peptides plus interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) was consistently detected. Depletion of Treg cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells enhanced proliferation <b>to</b> <b>HBcAg.</b> In contrast, patients with AEs who received anti-HBV treatments with oral nucleoside analogues or interferon-alpha injection revealed that more post-treatment increase of HBcAg-specific Treg f correlated with a higher sustained remission rate to the therapy. Conclusions: These data indicate that HBcAg-specific Treg cells from perinatally-acquired CHB patients are proliferative <b>to</b> <b>HBcAg</b> and its peptides and exhibit suppressor activity.

Eleven of the 20 CAH patients showed a significant T lymphocyte proliferative response <b>to</b> <b>HBcAg,</b> whereas no proliferation was detectable in response to envelope antigens (HBs and pre-S) in any patient.

40|$|AbstractCytokines {{that are}} {{secreted}} {{as a response}} to viral antigen not only have direct antiviral properties but also crucially influence immune reactions determining the outcome of infection. As an advantageous alternative to the study of cytokines present in the supernatants of antigen-specific T cell clones and lines, we have used ELISPOT assays to determine the number of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) - and IL 4 -producing cells generated by peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with acute hepatitis B (AHB) and chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection in response <b>to</b> <b>HBcAg</b> in a short-term culture (48 h). In response <b>to</b> <b>HBcAg</b> IFN-γ was predominantly produced. In contrast to the results obtained in acute hepatitis B, the typical lymphokine pattern in CHB was characterized by a weak or absent antigen-specific IFN-γ production. A predominance of IL- 4 -producing cells was not observed in either AHB or CHB. A significant number of IFN-γ-producing cells was usually detectable during phases of viral elimination {{and the quality of the}} lymphokine response seemed to be epitope independent. Comparison of the results obtained in proliferation assays and ELISPOT assays clearly shows that lymphokine production upon stimulation with viral protein is totally independent of T cell proliferation and more sensitively reflects antiviral reactivity...|$|R

ELISA, Western blot and animal immunization were {{used to analyze the}} antigenicity and immmunogenicity of purified particulate antigens. The ability to capture HBV by antibodies elicited by chimeric particles was detected with immuno-capture PCR. RESULTS: Recombinant antigens CI, CII, CIII carrying 1 - 3 copies of HBV preS 1 (21 - 47) individually could form virus-like particles (VLPs), similar <b>to</b> <b>HBcAg</b> in morphology. But recombinant antigens carrying 4 - 6 copies of HBV preS 1 (21 - 47) were poorly expressed in E. coli. Chimeric antigens were lacking of immunoreactivity with anti-HBc monoclonal antibodies (McAbs), but still reserved good immunoreactivity with anti-HBe McAbs. CI, CII, CIII could strongly react with anti-preS 1 McAb, suggesting that preS 1 (21 - 47) fragment was well exposed on the surface of chimeric VLPs. Three chimeric VLP antigens (CI, CII and CIII) could stimulate mice <b>to</b> produce high-level <b>antibody</b> responses, and their immunogenicity was stronger than non-particulate antigen 21 - 47 * 6, containing 6 copies of preS 1 (21 - 47).

Among HBeAg-negative patients, 50 % showed the presence of circulating DNA viral sequences, and HBcAg was identified in five of 26 (19 %) cases in serum and in six of 24 (25 %) in the liver respectively. In 15 patients, liver fragments permitted examination in parallel by immunofluorescence for HBcAg and molecular hybridization for viral DNA in liver cells. A DNA pattern characteristic of viral replication was found in cases with evidence of active virion production, independently from HBeAg and anti-HBe, and in these patients HBcAg was present both in serum and in hepatocytes. In two cases with free HBV-DNA, without evidence of replicative activity, core antigen was not detected in the liver, but in one patient HBcAg was found in the serum. A similar finding was also noted in another patient, in whom the hybridization pattern was consistent with integration of viral genome into high-molecular-weight cellular DNA.

METHODS [...] Serum samples from 1316 consecutive patients were screened for antinuclear antibodies and the clinical findings in patients with <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> centromere alone were compared with those with <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> both centromere and histone. RESULTS [...] Twenty six patients had <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> centromere. Fourteen patients had <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> centromere alone and 12 patients had <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> centromere and histone. Four of the 12 patients with <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> centromere and histone had diffuse scleroderma with severe pulmonary or vascular disease. CONCLUSIONS [...] A subset of patients with scleroderma with <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> centromere and histone has been identified retrospectively, who have severe pulmonary or vascular disease. It will be of interest to follow up the clinical course of other patients with scleroderma who have both antibodies for the development of pulmonary or vascular disease...|$|R
40|$|<b>Antibodies</b> <b>to</b> Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) were {{measured}} in sera of 492 students {{during the past}} 11 years in our college. The frequency of <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> EBV in newly enrolled students from 1978 to 1989 (93 %) was higher than in those from 1987 to 1989 (86 %). <b>Antibodies</b> <b>to</b> cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus (HSV) and rubella virus were also measured in sera of 287 students from 1986 to 1989. The frequency of <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> both CMV and HSV in the students were 74 % and 30 %. The frequency of <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> rubella virus was significantly higher in the female students (92 %) than in the male students (65 %). The relation ship between the age {{and the frequency of}} <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> both EBV and CMV were also examined in sera of 229 healthy adults. The frequency of <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> EBV in the healthy adults was 93 % in the 20 years age group and 100 % in the > 50 years age group. The frequency of <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> CMV in the healthy adults was 59 % in the 20 years age group and 86 % in the > 50 years age group. Therefore, the frequency of <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> both EBV and CMV increased with age. われわれは熊本大学医療技術短期大学部学生におけるEBV、CMV、HSVの３種のヘルペス科ウイルスおよび風疹（ルベラ）ウイルスに対する各抗体の保有状況を調べたので報告する。また、一般健常人については、EBVおよびCMV抗体保有率と加齢との関係を調べたので併せて報告する...|$|R
40|$|We {{made three}} {{different}} lines of hepatitis B virus (HBV) transgenic mice which express different amounts of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and/or hepatitis B core antigen (<b>HBcAg)</b> <b>to</b> analyse the cellular mechanisms of HBcAg specific T-cell tolerance. BS 10 (official designation, 1. 2 HB-BS 10) transgenic mice, which contain the whole HBV genome, express relatively high amounts of HBeAg in the serum and HBcAg in the liver. SPC mice, which contain hepatitis B virus core and precore gene, express {{small amounts of}} HBeAg in the serum but not HBcAg in the liver. SC 33 mice, which contain only hepatitis B core gene, do not express HBeAg in the serum but express HBcAg in the liver. BS 10 mice showed a very low anti-HBc antibody response after primary and secondary immunizations with recombinant <b>HBcAg</b> compared <b>to</b> transgenic host C 57 BL/ 6 (B 6) mice. SPC mice showed an almost equal level of anti-HBc <b>antibody</b> response compared <b>to</b> B 6 mice. SC 33 mice contained anti-HBc antibody even before immunization and showed high titres of anti-HBc antibody response after immunization with HBcAg. Analysis of cellular site(s) of low responsiveness of BS 10 mice revealed that proliferating and helper T cells are specifically tolerant <b>to</b> <b>HBcAg.</b> B cells and antigen-presenting cells in BS 10 mice were not defective. SC 33, SPC and BS 10 mice differ a little in their developmental expression of HBc/HBeAg. Our results suggest critical roles of the nature (circulating versus non-circulating) {{as well as the}} time of expression of self-antigens in T-cell tolerance...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Antibodies</b> <b>to</b> P. falciparum apical {{membrane}} protein 1 (AMA 1) {{may contribute to}} protective immunity against clinical malaria by inhibiting blood stage growth of P. falciparum, and AMA 1 is a leading malaria vaccine candidate. Currently, there is limited knowledge of the acquisition of strain-specific and cross-reactive <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> AMA 1 in humans, or the acquisition of invasion-inhibitory <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> AMA 1. METHODOLOGY/FINDINGS: We examined the acquisition of human <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> specific polymorphic invasion-inhibitory and non-inhibitory AMA 1 epitopes, defined by the monoclonal antibodies 1 F 9 and 2 C 5, respectively. Naturally acquired antibodies were measured in cohorts of Kenyan children and adults. <b>Antibodies</b> <b>to</b> the invasion-inhibitory 1 F 9 epitope and non-inhibitory 2 C 5 epitope were measured indirectly by competition ELISA. <b>Antibodies</b> <b>to</b> the 1 F 9 and 2 C 5 epitopes were acquired by children and correlated with exposure, and higher antibody levels and prevalence were observed with increasing age and with active P. falciparum infection. Of note, the prevalence of <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> the inhibitory 1 F 9 epitope was lower than <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> AMA 1 or the 2 C 5 epitope. <b>Antibodies</b> <b>to</b> AMA 1 ectodomain, the 1 F 9 or 2 C 5 epitopes, {{or a combination of}} responses, showed some association with protection from P. falciparum malaria in a prospective longitudinal study. Furthermore, <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> the invasion-inhibitory 1 F 9 epitope were positively correlated with parasite growth-inhibitory activity of serum antibodies. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Individuals acquire <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> functional, polymorphic epitopes of AMA 1 that may contribute to protective immunity, and these findings have implications for AMA 1 vaccine development. Measuring <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> the 1 F 9 epitope by competition ELISA may be a valuable approach <b>to</b> assessing human <b>antibodies</b> with invasion-inhibitory activity in studies of acquired immunity and vaccine trials of AMA 1...|$|R

40|$|An enzyme {{immunoassay}} was used <b>to</b> measure circulating <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> gluten, gliadin and to 'reticulin glycoprotein' in 25 patients with Sjögren's syndrome (SS), in 20 patients with rheumatoid arthritis without SS and in 19 patients with {{systemic lupus erythematosus}} without SS. <b>Antibody</b> levels <b>to</b> these three antigens were significantly higher in SS than in the other groups. In SS the level of <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> 'reticulin glycoprotein' correlated positively with the levels of <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> both gliadin and to gluten {{but not with the}} level of <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> SS-B antigen. Patients with primary SS had higher <b>antibody</b> levels <b>to</b> 'reticulin glycoprotein' than had patients with secondary SS, whereas no significant difference between primary and secondary SS was found in the levels of the <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> gliadin or <b>to</b> gluten.

40|$|An {{enzyme-linked}} immunoassay {{was used}} <b>to</b> detect <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> the cell wall peptidoglycan of Staphylococcus aureus in human sera. All 170 sera from donors and patients with staphylococcal and nonstaphilococcal infections contained IgG <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> peptidoglycan; antobody levels varied with age, and transplacental transfer occurred. IgM <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> peptidoglycan {{were not found}} in donors and were present in only one patient with serious staphylococcal infection. Significantly elevated levels of IgG <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> peptidoglycan were observed in 20 (80 %) of 25 patients with deep tissue infection with S. aureus but in only two (9 %) of 22 patients with superficial staphylococcal infection. An increase in levels of <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> peptidoglycan generally coincided {{with an increase in}} level of IgG <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> teichoic acid. No cross-reactivity between peptidoglycan and teichoic acid was observed. Thus, staphylococcal peptidoglycan is immunogenic in humans, and testing for IgG <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> peptidoglycan may be useful in the diagnosis and follow-up of serious staphylococcal infections...|$|R
40|$|Immunoglobulin G (IgG) <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> three vaccine {{candidate}} preerythrocytic Plasmodium falciparum antigens {{were evaluated}} {{in children and}} adults in an epidemic-prone highland area of Kenya during rainy (high-transmission) and dry (low-transmission) seasons. The frequencies and median levels of IgG <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> circumsporozoite protein (CSP) and thrombospondin-related adhesive protein (TRAP) were compared to the frequencies and median levels of IgG <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> liver-stage antigen 1 (LSA- 1) reported previously. The frequencies and median levels of IgG <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> CSP and TRAP were similar in children and adults in the rainy season, but they were lower in children than in adults in the dry season. The frequencies and median levels of <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> LSA- 1 were lower in children than in adults in both the rainy and dry seasons. <b>Antibodies</b> <b>to</b> CSP and LSA- 1 were primarily members of the IgG 1 and IgG 3 subclasses, while <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> TRAP were primarily members of the IgG 3 and IgG 4 subclasses. In a treatment-reinfection study following dry season testing, <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> TRAP were associated with a trend toward protection from infection in children (P = 0. 051) but not in adults. <b>Antibodies</b> <b>to</b> LSA- 1 and CSP did not correlate with protection in children or adults.

IgE <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> higher molecular weight antigens (Der fI, fIII, fIV etc.) developed in some cases, suggesting that repeated injections of crude extract tended <b>to</b> induce IgE <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> alternative molecules in patients. The IgG 4 <b>antibody</b> <b>to</b> Der fII increased in 10 cases, while that to Der fI increased in three of 12 cases, indicating that production of IgG 4 <b>antibodies</b> <b>to</b> mite antigens started and expanded with repeated injections of house dust extract.
