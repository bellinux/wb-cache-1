5|$|Insects {{have been}} used medicinally in {{cultures}} around the world, often according to the Doctrine of Signatures. Thus, the femurs of grasshoppers, which were said to resemble the human liver, were used to treat liver ailments by the indigenous peoples of Mexico. The doctrine was applied in both Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and in Ayurveda. TCM uses arthropods for various purposes; for example, centipede is used to treat tetanus, seizures, and convulsions, while the Chinese Black Mountain Ant, Polyrhachis vicina, {{is used as a}} cure all, especially by the elderly, and extracts have been examined as a possible <b>anti-cancer</b> <b>agent.</b> Ayurveda uses insects such as Termite for conditions such as ulcers, rheumatic diseases, anaemia, and pain. The Jatropha leaf miner's larvae are used boiled to induce lactation, reduce fever, and soothe the gastrointestinal tract. In contrast, the traditional insect medicine of Africa is local and unformalised. The indigenous peoples of Central America used a wide variety of insects medicinally. Mayans used Army ant soldiers as living sutures. The venom of the Red harvester ant was used to cure rheumatism, arthritis, and poliomyelitis via the immune reaction produced by its sting. Boiled silkworm pupae were taken to treat apoplexy, aphasy, bronchitis, pneumonia, convulsions, haemorrhages, and frequent urination.|$|E

40|$|Delayed {{hypersensitivity}} reaction in mice was commonly enhanced with various <b>anti-cancer</b> <b>agents</b> administered as single or intermittent high doses but not consecutive divided doses.

40|$|Cellular {{responses}} to <b>anti-cancer</b> <b>agents</b> {{result from the}} interaction between drugs, cellular targets and mechanisms of damage repair. Despite the pharmacological advances {{in the treatment of}} cancer, the clinical efficacy of chemotherapy is unpredictable in most patients. However, new information on the genetics of cancer delineates strategies by which the genetic background of tumour cells and patients might be profiled to select <b>anti-cancer</b> <b>agents</b> with improved efficacy and tolerability. This article focuses on the application of pharmacogenetics in the characterization of differences in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of <b>anti-cancer</b> <b>agents</b> among individuals to define the likelihood of response and reduce the incidence of adverse effects...|$|R

2500|$|Studies {{have shown}} that {{serotype}} 2 of the virus (AAV-2) apparently kills cancer cells without harming healthy ones. [...] "Our results suggest that adeno-associated virus type 2, which infects {{the majority of the}} population but has no known ill effects, kills multiple types of cancer cells yet has no effect on healthy cells," [...] said Craig Meyers, a professor of immunology and microbiology at the Penn State College of Medicine in Pennsylvania in 2005. This could lead to a new <b>anti-cancer</b> <b>agent.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Another {{specific}} {{element that}} has been tested and used as an <b>anti-cancer</b> <b>agent</b> is lanthanum, more specifically lanthanum chloride (LaCl3 [...] ). The lanthanum ion is used to affect the levels of let-7a and microRNAs miR-34a in a cell throughout the cell cycle. [...] When the lanthanum ion {{was introduced to the}} cell in vivo or in vitro, it inhibited the rapid growth and induced apoptosis of the cancer cells (specifically cervical cancer cells). This effect was caused by the regulation of the let-7a and microRNAs by the lanthanum ions. The mechanism for this effect is still unclear but {{it is possible that the}} lanthanum is acting in a similar way as the cerium and binding to a ligand necessary for cancer cell proliferation.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Cancer is a {{major public}} health concern in both {{developed}} and developing countries. Several plant-derived <b>anti-cancer</b> <b>agents</b> including taxol, vinblastine, vincristine, the campothecin derivatives, topotecan, irinotecan and etoposide are in clinical use all over the world. Other promising <b>anti-cancer</b> <b>agents</b> include flavopiridol, rosco-vitine, combretastatin A- 4, betulinic acid and silvestrol. From this list one can well imagine the predominance of polyphenols, flavonoids and their synthetic analogs {{in the treatment of}} ovarian, breast, cervical, pancreatic and prostate cancer. Flavonoids present in human diet comprise many polyphenolic secondary metabolites with broad-spectrum pharmacological activities including their potential role as <b>anti-cancer</b> <b>agents.</b> A positive correlation between flavonoids-rich diet (from vegetables and fruits) and lower risk of colon, prostate and breast cancers lead to a question that whether flavonoids mediate the protective effects as chemopreventive agents or can interact with different genes and proteins to play role in chemotherapy. The current review emphasizes onto the therapeutic potential of flavonoids and their synthetic analogs as <b>anti-cancer</b> <b>agents</b> by providing new insights into the factors, regulation and molecular mechanisms along with their significant protein interactions...|$|R

In rats receiving DES and ANI, {{the development of}} kidney tumors was inhibited. Histologically, golden-brownpigments were observed in the cells of renal tubules in the groups of DES-treatment.

2500|$|The main {{proponent of}} {{hydrazine}} sulfate as an <b>anti-cancer</b> <b>agent</b> is a U.S. physician named Joseph Gold, {{who developed the}} treatment in the mid-1970s. The use of hydrazine sulfate as a cancer remedy was popularized by the magazine Penthouse in the mid-1990s, when Kathy Keeton, wife and business partner of the magazine's publisher Bob Guccione, used it {{in an attempt to}} treat her metastatic breast cancer. [...] Alternative medicine nutritionist Gary Null wrote three of the articles about alternative cancer treatments, including one titled [...] "The Great Cancer Fraud." [...] Keeton (until her death in 1997) and other supporters of hydrazine sulfate treatment accused the U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI) of deliberately hiding the beneficial effects of the compound, and threatened to launch a class action lawsuit. The NCI denied the claims, and says that there is little to no evidence that hydrazine sulfate has any beneficial effects whatsoever. The position of the NCI was supported by an inquiry held by the General Accounting Office.|$|E
2500|$|One of the {{specific}} elements from the lanthanide group that has been tested and used is cerium (Ce). There have been studies that use a protein-cerium complex to observe the effect of cerium on the cancer cells. The hope was to inhibit cell proliferation and promote cytotoxicity. Transferrin receptors in cancer cells, {{such as those in}} breast cancer cells and epithelial cervical cells, promote the cell proliferation and malignancy of the cancer. Transferrin is a protein used to transport iron into the cells and is needed to aid the cancer cells in DNA replication. [...] Transferrin acts as a growth factor for the cancerous cells and is dependent on iron. Cancer cells have much higher levels of transferrin receptors than normal cells and are very dependent on iron for their proliferation. Cerium has shown results as an <b>anti-cancer</b> <b>agent</b> due to its similarities in structure and biochemistry to iron. [...] Cerium may bind in the place of iron on to the transferrin and then be brought into the cancer cells by transferrin-receptor mediated endocytosis. The cerium binding to the transferrin in place of the iron inhibits the transferrin activity in the cell. This creates a toxic environment for the cancer cells and causes a decrease in cell growth. This is the proposed mechanism for cerium’s effect on cancer cells, though the real mechanism may be more complex in how cerium inhibits cancer cell proliferation. Specifically in HeLa cancer cells studied in vitro, cell viability was decreased after 48 to 72 hours of cerium treatments. Cells treated with just cerium had decreases in cell viability, but cells treated with both cerium and transferrin had more significant inhibition for cellular activity.|$|E

40|$|Homocamptothecins {{are proving}} to be an {{especially}} interesting class of <b>anti-cancer</b> <b>agents</b> because they resemble standard camptothecins in cytotoxicity but have very different pharmacodyanamic properties. This review summarizes synthetic approaches to the parent homocamptothecin and its analogs. Three powerful and general routes-the Lavergne-Comins route, the cascade radical annulation route, and the Friedlander route-have been put into place to make homocamptothecins. These routes are compared and contrasted. Together, they have driven the SAR, preclinical, and clinical development of this class of <b>anti-cancer</b> <b>agents.</b> © 2008 Académie des sciences...|$|R
