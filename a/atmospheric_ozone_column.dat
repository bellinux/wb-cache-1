40|$|The {{potentially}} harmful solar UV-B radiation is attenuated {{on its way}} through the atmosphere by absorption by stratospheric and tropospheric ozone and scattering. This study presents spectral measurements of solar UV-radiation, the development of the elaboration method and the atmospheric ozone amounts calculated therewith. Diurnal variations of UV-B spectra between 290 and 320 nanometers were measured in Bayreuth (50 N) in summer 1992 and 1993. In addition, on elected days with few clouds, direct radiation was occulted and relation between diffuse and global radiation in UV and visible bands was measured - on the one hand to gain the direct radiation for the model calculation, on the other hand to assess the influence of scattering by aerosol particles. Data were processed with computer programs (Schreiber 1993) which were improved and extended to subsequently correct errors like wavelength shifts of the monochromator and other reconstructable deviations, and to calculate spectra of direct radiation from the measurements. With a simple radiation model, the total ozone amount of the atmsophere at the measurement site was calculated from these spectra. The height of the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>column</b> could be determined with a variation range mostly less than 1 %. The results coincided well with data from Hohenpeissenberg in southern Bavaria (Deutscher Wetterdienst 1992 + 1993 a). During most days with few clouds, an increase of total ozone of about 2 - 5 % could be observed. The diurnal variation of the total ozone shows on these days a similar curve as measurements of the surface ozone in Oberwarmensteinach, situated about 20 km from Bayreuth at 400 m higher level. The measured increase of total ozone during most days can only partly be explained by the photochemical formation of surface ozone - therefore the diurnal variation had to continue until several km height. Measurements close to Garmisch-Partenkirchen (Fraunhofer-Institut 1992), however, show that this diurnal variation decreases with increasing height. The spectral course of relation between diffuse and global radiation shows typical shapes for identical sun elevation angles. For solar elevations above 35 the total ozone could be determined exactly, even when measurements from different days with equal elevation angles were used. The relation between diffuse and direct radiation was higher on nearly all afternoons than before noon, which {{can be explained by the}} increase of aerosol particle amount because of convection processes starting during the day.

40|$|Tropospheric ozone columns (TCOs) {{derived from}} {{differences}} between the Dutch-Finnish Aura Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) measurements of the total <b>atmospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>column</b> and the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) measurements of stratospheric ozone columns are discussed. Because the measurements by these two instruments are not spatially coincident, interpolation techniques, with emphasis on mapping the stratospheric columns {{in space and time}} using the relationships between lower stratospheric ozone and potential vorticity (PV) and geopotential heights (Z), are evaluated at mid-latitudes. It is shown that this PV mapping procedure produces somewhat better agreement in comparisons with ozonesonde measurements, particularly in winter, than does simple linear interpolation of the MLS stratospheric columns or the use of typical coincidence criteria at mid-latitudes. The OMI/MLS derived tropospheric columns are calculated to be 4 Dobson units (DU) smaller than the sonde measured columns at mid-latitudes. Standard deviations between the derived tropospheric columns and those measured by ozonesondes are 9 DU (30 %) annually but they are just 6 DU (15 %) in summer. Uncertainties in the interpolated MLS stratospheric columns are likely to be the primary cause of these standard deviations. An important advantage of the PV mapping approach is that it works well when MLS data are missing (e. g., when an orbit of measurements is missing). In the comparisons against ozonesonde measurements, it provides up to twice as many comparisons compared to the other techniques. The OMI/MLS derived tropospheric ozone columns have been compared with corresponding columns based on the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) measurements, and Regional chEmical trAnsport Model (REAM) simulations. The variability of tropospheric ozone columns has been examined for spring and summer 2005 over North America and the surrounding oceans. Comparisons of monthly mean distributions show good agreements between OMI/MLS tropospheric ozone columns, REAM columns, and TES columns. Two six-day periods in March have been selected to study the periodic TCO enhancements in two regions, around the Baja peninsula (Mexico) and over the West Coast of California. Thirteen-day back trajectories and daily maps of carbon monoxide (CO) and ozone from GEOS-CHEM and OMI/MLS have been used to investigate the influence of cross-Pacific transport. It is concluded that in the first period of the case study, the high ozone concentrations in mid and lower troposphere over the West Coast of California have been under the influence of cross-Pacific transport. Meteorological fields indicate that the high ozone concentrations in the upper troposphere over the West Coast of California and the high TCOs over the Baja peninsula are associated with stratospheric intrusions through a deep Rossby wave breaking event. The correlations between REAM TCOs and surface ozone from Environmental Protection Agency ground network measurements indicate that the TCO enhancement over the West Coast is associated with an increase of surface ozone. The correlations of REAM TCOs with geopotential height, wind fields, and tropopause height during the case study period suggest that TCO enhancement is best characterized in springtime by decreases of geopotential height on the 500 mb surface.

The influence of changes in lake depth on the UVR proxy was excluded by applying a correction, based on the non-linear relation between modern scytonemin concentrations and lake depth in a regional reference data set, and the record of past lake depths inferred using a diatom based transfer function in the sediment core. Results showed four well-defined maxima in the UVR proxy during the last 1600 – 1800 years, centred around 1820 – 1780, 1580 – 1490, 790 – 580 and 680 – 440 AD.

30|$|Among the tropospheric gases {{that can}} be {{monitored}} from space, ozone {{is one of the}} most problematic ones. In fact, the contribution of tropospheric ozone to the measured radiance signal must be separated from the contribution of stratospheric ozone, which is much larger, due to the fact that most of the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> is found in the stratosphere. In order to accomplish this, several techniques were developed during the last 20 years. The rationale behind the first tropospheric ozone retrieval algorithms was to isolate the stratospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>column</b> by means of limb measurements [11, 12] or total ozone retrievals over high-altitude clouds [13, 14], and then subtract it from a co-located or neighboring measurement of the total <b>ozone</b> <b>column.</b> In the case of limb measurements, the separation between stratosphere and the troposphere is achieved thanks to the limb viewing geometry, whose line of sight does not encounter the atmospheric layers located beneath the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere (UTLS). In the case of measurements over high clouds, it is assumed that such clouds shield the underlying troposphere, and that the stratospheric ozone field does not have a significant horizontal variability within a certain number of neighboring pixels. If these assumptions hold true, it is possible to say that total <b>ozone</b> <b>column</b> retrievals over high altitude clouds actually represent stratospheric columns, which can be subtracted from total <b>ozone</b> <b>columns</b> retrieved over neighboring clear-sky pixels to yield an approximated value for the tropospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>column.</b> This type of approach has been mainly used over the Tropics, where high convective clouds are more frequent.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> attenuates {{ultraviolet}} radiation reaching the Earth’s surface. Since UV-B radiation {{is considered the}} principal factor of causing the skin cancers, cataracts and some immunological disorders, determination of total <b>ozone</b> <b>column</b> has become everyday practice. In Serbia and Montenegro, such determinations are not being done. Satellite data for the entire globe are accessible. Objective: The objective of our work was to collect and analyze data for the territory of Serbia and Montenegro, because ozone is an important parameter {{for the study of}} effects and protection from UV radiation. METHODS Data collected during TOMS (Total Ozone Measuring Spectrometer) experiment are presented for grid whose elements are 1 ° latitude by 1. 25 ° longitude. Grid elements in which the territory of Serbia and Montenegro comprises more than 50 % of the element area were taken to represent the territory of Serbia and Montenegro. Eleven grid elements were selected and average monthly values for 272 months in the period from 1978 until 2004 were collected. Data for the period between 1993 and 1996 were unavailable. Results: Mean values of total <b>ozone</b> <b>column</b> and mean monthly values of eleven grid elements differed very little. Differences were smaller than magnitudes of random error. Average annual values of total <b>ozone</b> <b>column</b> above the territory of Serbia and Montenegro were in the range from 316 Dobson units (DU) in 2002 to 347 DU in 1981. Annual cyclic changes of total <b>ozone</b> <b>column</b> showed spring maxima and autumn minima. Maximal recorded monthly value was 421 DU in March 1987 and minimal monthly value was 271 DU in October 2001. There was a trend of decreasing total <b>ozone</b> <b>column</b> values in the period between 1979 and 1992 at the rate of approximately 4. 5 % per decade. Conclusion: Mean total <b>ozone</b> <b>column</b> value above the territory of Serbia and Montenegro can represent total <b>ozone</b> <b>column</b> for the whole territory. Annual cycles with spring maxima and autumn minima are in accordance with oscillations observed for middle northern latitudes. The trend showing 4. 5 % decrease per decade in the period between 1979 and 1992 corresponds well to trends calculated for comparable locations...|$|R

40|$|The solar UV {{radiation}} has prominent {{impacts on}} human life, {{animals and plants}} with positive and negative effects. <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>ozone,</b> which is formed from the photodissociation of molecular oxygen mainly in the stratosphere, absorbs a significant factor of solar UV radiation. The ozone in the stratosphere acts as a protective layer to prevent UV radiation reaching {{on the surface of}} the earth. Hence the intensity of solar UV radiation on the surface has a strong dependence on the Total <b>Ozone</b> <b>Column</b> (TOC). The UV irradiance on earth surface depends on geometrical factors such as solar zenith angle, altitude, latitude and other atmospheric parameters as well. This is an attempt to study the variation of solar UV flux at its four discrete wavelengths ranging from 305 - 380 nm at Kannur, which is located in the north of Kerala in India.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Reports {{of severe}} stratospheric ozone {{depletion}} over the Arctic have heightened {{concern about the}} potential impact of rising ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation on north polar aquatic ecosystems. Our optical measurements and modelling results indicate that the ozone-related UV-B influence on food web processes in the Arctic Ocean is likely to be small relative to the effects caused by variation in the concentrations of natural UV-absorbing compounds, known as chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM), that enter the Arctic basin via its large river inflows. The aim of our present study was to develop and apply a simple bio-optical index that takes into account the combined effects of attenuation by <b>atmospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> and water <b>column</b> CDOM, and photobiological weighting for high-latitude environments such as the Arctic Ocean. To this end, we computed values for a biologically effective UV dose rate parameter (“weighted transparency ” or T*) based on underwater UV measurements in high-latitude lakes and rivers that discharge into the Arctic Ocean; measured incident UV radiation at Barrow, Alaska; and published biological weighting curves for UV-induced DNA damage and UV photoinhibition of photosynthesis. The results underscore how strongly the Arctic Ocean is influenced by riverine inputs: shifts in CDOM loading (e. g., through climate change, land-use practices, or changes in ocean circulation) can cause variations in biological UV exposure of much greater magnitude than ozone-related effects...|$|R

Photosynthetic rates were found to be depressed after two hours exposure to UV-B irradiance simulating a 0. 18 atm•cm <b>ozone</b> <b>column</b> when the sun is at 30 ° from the zenith. During this initial exposure period, partial stomatal closure was implicated in the suppression of photosynthesis. However, after one day exposure, substantial increases in photosynthetic resistances apart from stomatal diffusion resistance occurred in the UV-irradiated plants and no differences in stomatal diffusion resistance were apparent between UV-irradiated and control plants. Dark respiration rates were slightly higher in those plants exposed to UV radiation. Leaf expansion of R. patientia was substantially repressed but only during the initial few days of exposure. Thereafter, leaf expansion was similar in the UV-irradiated and control plants. A reduction in total plant dry weight and leaf area of approximately 50 percent occurred after 22 days treatment while chlorophyll concentrations remained unaltered. Time of leaf initiation was shawm to be delayed in those plants exposed to UV-B radiation. Leaf longevity was decreased with increased UV radiation but accelerated whole-plant senescence and death was not observed. Photosynthetic rates determined through the ontogeny of the third leaf of R. patientia exposed to four levels of UV irradiance were found to be depressed {{as a function of the}} accumulated biologically effective UV irradiation. Thus, reciprocity was demonstrated between 6350 and 3175 J biologically effective UV irradiation. Results of the simultion model showed that under reduced <b>atmospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> concentrations, suppression of photosynthesis and leaf growth would be more severe during mid-sunnner (i. e. June) than would occur during the March to early May period, This results from smaller solar angles from the zenith and lower prevailing ozone concentrations prevalent during June. A validation test of the model was made with photosynthetic data obtained during a field study with R. patientia exposed to UV-B radiation corresponding to a 38 percent <b>atmospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> reduction (0. 18 atm•cm when the sun was at 30 ° from the zenith). This validation test showed a reasonable correspondence between the measured and predicted photosynthetic rates. R. patientia was selected as the test species for this study because (1) it is reasonably sensitive to UV radiation as determined in preliminary studies evaluating approximately 20 native and agricultural plant species, (2) it is normally exposed to full sunlight in · its natural habitat, and (3) individual leaves are relatively long - lived (about 60 days) and are not normally shaded by other leaves of the same plant. Although this species probably represents one of the more sensitive plants to UV radiation, it would be this group of sensitive plants that would be initially affected under conditions of reduced <b>atmospheric</b> <b>ozone.</b> If more resistant plants with long-lived plant parts also accumulate UV radiation damage as was shown to occur in R. patientia, over sufficient periods of time even these species might be significantly impacted under conditions of reduced <b>atmospheric</b> <b>ozone...</b>|$|R
40|$|The Persistent Elevated Pollution Episode (PEPE) /Northeast Regional Oxidant Study (NEROS) Project {{consisted}} {{of a series of}} field measurements sponsored by the EPA during July and August, 1980. NASA participation in the Project had several purposes: (1) use remote sensing to help determine mixed layer height and ozone profiles regionally; and (2) provide opportunity for development, testing and evaluation of several NASA 'emerging' airborne remote sensing systems. NASA also provided information on the hazy pollution episodes throughout the summer of 1980 with satellite imagery.

40|$|Abstract. For the 27 -year period 1933 - 1959 inclusive, highly {{significant}} negative correlation is {{found between the}} relative sunspot number and the worldwide average of total <b>atmospheric</b> <b>ozone.</b> Peak correlation {{with respect to the}} present-day 10 -year sunspot cycle is found at a lag of 1 •/ • to 2 years of the sunspots relative to ozone. The peak correlation of total <b>atmospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> with the mean latitudinal distance from the solar equator of the total area of sunspots is almost identical in magnitude to that with sunspot number. Itowever, the peak correlation with sunspot latitude is found at a lag of less than 6 months of the ozone relative to sunspot latitude, in the opposite direction to that with sunspot number. This phase difference of the negative correlation suggests that <b>atmospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> is much more sensitive to sunspot latitude than to sunspot number. INTRODUCTORY P•EMARKS The author's longtime interest in <b>atmospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> as a possible link between solar activity and climate was increased by the implications of a recent paper by Kraus [1961].

40|$|Recently, {{passengers}} and crew members on long-distance commercial flights have filed complaints after suffering symptoms of ozone sickness. Studies were conducted to determine the frequency and concentration of ozone in commercial jet transports. The airliner problem with ozone prompted NASA to determine the ozone concentrations that might be encountered in the cabin of a small business jet. Simultaneous measurements of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> levels and ozone levels in the cabins of jet aircraft were necessary because of the wide and rapid variability of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> in flight. It {{was found that the}} <b>atmospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> concentrations in the case of B- 747 airliners vary widely during a flight.

It was used to validate the colocated daytime Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) partial <b>ozone</b> <b>columns</b> along the aircraft tracks over diverse geophysical conditions. Results show that the MLS v. 1. 5 and CAFS <b>ozone</b> <b>columns</b> agree to better than 3 % at pressure levels of 100 and 146 hPa, and to better than 5 % at 215 hPa level. The partial <b>ozone</b> <b>column</b> differences between the two systems were the largest during the Polar AVE (PAVE) 2005 campaign (polar region, ~ 250 hPa pressure level), and the smallest during the CRAVE 2006 campaign (tropics, ~ 100 hPa pressure level). Overall, the averaged bias between the MLS and CAFS partial <b>ozone</b> <b>column</b> is about 2 %, and the standard deviation of the differences is about 2 %. The v. 2. 2 update of the MLS data tends to reduce the bias to less than 1 %. In addition, the AVE 2005 campaign uncovered an altitude-dependent bias, where the MLS partial <b>ozone</b> <b>columns</b> above 100 and 146 hPa pressure levels were about 1 % higher than the CAFS derived columns, while the bias increased to about 3 % in partial columns integrated above 215 hPa. However, the MLS and CAFS data track each other closely over a wide range of atmospheric conditions, and the differences lie within the combined uncertainties of the two data sets...|$|R

40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} chemical-dynamical-radiative {{model of}} the middle atmosphere is used to investigate the potential changes of temperature, ozone, and other chemical constituents in response tovariations in the solar ultraviolet flux, associated with the solar rotation (27 days) and the solar cycle (11 years). The model reproduces satisfactorily the response (amplitude and phase) to the 27 -day forcing of ozone and temperature in the stratosphere but does not properly explain the ozone and temperature r sponses of opposite sign observed near 70 km altitude. The change in the <b>ozone</b> <b>column</b> abundance associated with the 27 -day solar forcing {{is estimated to be}} less than 0. 5 %. Variations in middle and upper <b>atmospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> concentrations and temperatures induced by solar variations on the ll-year time scale are not negligible compared to changes produced as a result of human activities over the same period of time. The calculated change in the <b>ozone</b> <b>column</b> abundance from solar minimum to solar maximum conditions is of the order of 1. 1 - 1. 3 % in the tropics and increases with latitude, especially in winter, to reach up to 1. 5 - 1. 7 % in the polar regions. There are large unexplained ifferences between the calculated and observed stratospheric responses. For example, in the photochemically controlled region of the upper stratosphere, the model seems to underestimate the ozone response by more than a factor 2. In addition, the negative temperature and ozone responses observed in the lower stratosphere cannot be reproduced by the model. Potential dynamical feedbacks exist, but reliable data sets covering a period longer than one solar cycle have to become available before this problem can adequately be addressed. 1...|$|R
