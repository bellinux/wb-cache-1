Most conventional analog circuits are designed worst-case, for adequate performance while handling the most demanding tasks.

This paper evaluates {{the use of such}} blocks for the design of a family of floating-point units including add/sub, multiplier, and divider. Portions of the units that would receive the greatest benefit from the use of multipliers and shift registers are identified. It is shown that the use of these results in significant area savings compared to similar floating-point units based solely on conventional LUT/FF logic. Finally, a complete floating-point application circuit that solves a classic heat transfer problem is presented. ...|$|R
