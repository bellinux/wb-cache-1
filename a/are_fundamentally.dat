However, {{this does not mean}} that kitsune are ghosts, nor that they <b>are</b> <b>fundamentally</b> different from regular foxes. Because the word spirit is used to reflect a state of knowledge or enlightenment, all long-lived foxes gain supernatural abilities.|$|E
5|$|Palmer {{begins by}} {{defending}} {{the claim that}} animals have moral standing, and then surveys three key approaches to animal ethics; utilitarian approaches, animal rights approaches, and capabilities approaches. All are lacking, she argues, as they <b>are</b> <b>fundamentally</b> capacity-oriented, and thus unable to properly take account of human relationships to animals. However, her approach leans more strongly towards a Regan-inspired rights view. She next identifies different kinds of relations humans may have with animals: affective, contractual and, most significantly, causal.|$|E
5|$|This {{increase}} in permeability primarily affects transport of ions and other hydrated species, {{indicating that the}} mechanism {{is the creation of}} nm-scale water-filled holes in the membrane. Although electroporation and dielectric breakdown both result from application of an electric field, the mechanisms involved <b>are</b> <b>fundamentally</b> different. In dielectric breakdown the barrier material is ionized, creating a conductive pathway. The material alteration is thus chemical in nature. In contrast, during electroporation the lipid molecules are not chemically altered but simply shift position, opening up a pore that acts as the conductive pathway through the bilayer as it is filled with water.|$|E

5|$|Bicycles and {{motorcycles}} {{are both}} single-track vehicles and so their motions have many fundamental attributes in common and <b>are</b> <b>fundamentally</b> different from {{and more difficult}} to study than other wheeled vehicles such as dicycles, tricycles, and quadracycles. As with unicycles, bikes lack lateral stability when stationary, and under most circumstances can only remain upright when moving forward. Experimentation and mathematical analysis have shown that a bike stays upright when it is steered to keep its center of mass over its wheels. This steering is usually supplied by a rider, or in certain circumstances, by the bike itself. Several factors, including geometry, mass distribution, and gyroscopic effect all contribute in varying degrees to this self-stability, but long-standing hypotheses and claims that any single effect, such as gyroscopic or trail, is solely responsible for the stabilizing force have been discredited.|$|E
5|$|Some {{people have}} opposed {{feminism}} {{on the grounds}} that they believe it is contrary to traditional values or religious beliefs.

40|$|I {{maintain}} that quantum mechanics <b>is</b> <b>fundamentally</b> about {{a system of}} N particles evolving in three-dimensional space, not the wave function evolving in 3 N-dimensional space. 1. What <b>is</b> quantum mechanics <b>fundamentally</b> about? I believe that quantum mechanics <b>is</b> <b>fundamentally</b> about particles – quantum mechanics describes the behavior of systems of particles evolving in three-dimensional space (or, if you prefer, four-dimensional space-time). (At least, that’s what I would say for non-relativistic quantum mechanics – for the relativistic case, I’d say that quantum mechanics <b>is</b> <b>fundamentally</b> about fields, existing in four-dimensional space-time. The ontological issue I’m interested in <b>is</b> <b>fundamentally</b> {{the same in the}} relativistic and non-relativistic cases, so I’ll stick with the non-relativistic case for simplicity.) Some physicists and philosophers disagree with my claim that quantum mechanics <b>is</b> <b>fundamentally</b> about particles – they would hold that quantum mechanics <b>is</b> <b>fundamentally</b> about the wave function, construed as a really existing field evolving in a 3 N-dimensional space (where N is the number of particles standardly thought to exist in three-dimensional space). I don’t believe in the wave function, and the point {{of this paper is to}} convince you that you shouldn’t believe in it either. Now, of course I think that the wave function is a usefu...|$|R
