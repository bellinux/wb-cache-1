50|$|An Affixing Machine is {{a machine}} that <b>affixes</b> postage <b>stamps</b> to an envelope, {{postcard}} or wrapper. Affixing machines {{first appeared in the}} 1850s but were not widely used until the early 20th century. There were also much larger floor models produced for this purpose. <b>Stamp</b> <b>affixing</b> machines were brought about by the need to mechanically <b>affix</b> <b>stamps</b> for bulk processing of mail. A secondary reason for the machines was to make the theft of stamps more difficult for employees with access to large inventory of coils.|$|R

50|$|SHRED is thus {{effectively}} {{an electronic}} reputation system, where reputation—in {{the form of}} being able to <b>affix</b> <b>stamps</b> to E-mail—is lost through complaints, and has to be bought back with money, thus imposing a financial cost on the loss of reputation. The presence or absence of a stamp then can be used by E-mail receivers, together with other sources of information such as blacklists, whitelists, and content analysis, to make judgments as to whether E-mail should be relayed or delivered.|$|R
50|$|Although not {{technically}} money, each certificate {{was intended to}} circulate with a value of one dollar. The intent {{of the program was}} to keep the certificates circulating and discourage hoarding. To achieve this, a holder had to affix to the back of a certificate a 1-cent stamp before the end of every week, for the certificate to maintain its validity. But the hassle and expense of the stamps made the certificates unpopular with the public. To make matters worse, the tiny postage-style stamps (smaller than 1 cm²) were prone to falling off. As the program intended, possessors of the certificates tried to avoid having to purchase and <b>affix</b> the <b>stamps,</b> by spending the certificates before the week's validity expired. The certificates then fell into in the hands of merchants, who would then purchase and <b>affix</b> <b>stamps</b> to maintain the notes' validity.|$|R

50|$|In April 2006, {{the postal}} order system {{underwent}} a revamp, enabling individual post offices to print postal orders on demand in any value from 50p through to 250 pounds, {{instead of the}} previous 50p to 20 pounds fixed range. As a result, single postal orders can now be purchased for odd denominations such as 66p or 99p, {{rather than having to}} make up odd amounts through a combination of pre-printed denominations and <b>affixed</b> <b>stamps.</b> This has made British postal orders similar to the money orders issued by post offices in the United States and many other countries.|$|R
