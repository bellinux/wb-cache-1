5|$|In April 1864, Brazil sent Minister Plenipotentiary José Antônio Saraiva to {{negotiate}} with Atanasio Aguirre, who had succeeded Berro in Uruguay. Saraiva made an initial attempt {{to settle the dispute}} between Blancos and Colorados. Faced with Aguirre's intransigence regarding Flores' demands, the Brazilian diplomat abandoned the effort and sided with the Colorados. On 10 August 1864, after a Brazilian ultimatum was refused, Saraiva declared that Brazil's military would begin exacting reprisals. Brazil declined to acknowledge a formal state of war, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>most</b> of its duration, the Uruguayan–Brazilian armed conflict was an undeclared war.|$|E
5|$|The medical faculties of Charles University in Prague {{also have}} a pelican as their emblem. The symbol of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service is a pelican, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>most</b> of its {{existence}} {{the headquarters of the}} service was located at Pelican House in Dublin, Ireland. The heraldic pelican also ended up as a pub name and image, though sometimes with the image of the ship Golden Hind. Sir Francis Drake's famous ship was initially called Pelican, and adorned the British halfpenny coin.|$|E
5|$|The sagas {{give all}} the credit to the Norwegians, praising Eirik Hákonarson for any {{intelligence}} <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>most</b> of the valour shown by Olaf Tryggvason's opponents. The Danes and Swedes rush {{at the front of}} Olaf's line and are repulsed, suffering heavy casualties and loss of ships. Jarl Eirik attacks the flank and forces his vessel, the Iron Ram, up against the last ship of Olaf's line, which he clears with a fierce attack and then proceeds onto the next ship. In this way, Olaf's ships were cleared one by one, till the Long Serpent alone was left.|$|E

5|$|Like {{other wines}} {{produced}} in the United States, Oregon wines are marketed as varietals. Oregon law requires that wines {{produced in the}} state must be identified by the grape variety from which it was made, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>most</b> varietals it must contain at least 90% of that variety. The exceptions to the 90% law are the following varietals: Red and White Bordeaux varietals, Red and White Rhône varietals, Sangiovese, Tempranillo, Zinfandel and Tannat. For these wines, they follow the Federal guidelines of 75%. Oregon law has long forbidden use of place names, except as appellations of origin. Oregon is most famous for its Pinot noir, which is produced throughout the state. Pinot noirs from the Willamette Valley have received much critical acclaim from wine connoisseurs and critics, and Oregon is {{regarded as one of}} the premier Pinot-producing regions in the world.|$|E
5|$|Tharoor {{is also an}} {{acclaimed}} writer, having authored 16 bestselling {{works of}} fiction and non-fiction since 1981, {{all of which are}} centred on India and its history, culture, film, politics, society, foreign policy, and more. He {{is also the author of}} hundreds of columns and articles in publications such as The New York Times, The Washington Post, TIME, Newsweek, and The Times of India. He was a contributing editor for Newsweek International for two years. From 2010 to 2012, he wrote a column in The Asian Age/Deccan Chronicle <b>and,</b> <b>for</b> <b>most</b> of 2012, until his appointment as Minister, a column in Mail Today; he also writes an internationally syndicated monthly column for Project Syndicate. He also wrote regular columns for The Indian Express (1991–93 and 1996–2001), The Hindu (2001–2008), and The Times of India (2007–2009).|$|E
5|$|When 27 August, fifteen {{days before}} 7 September, passed without a reply from either Sadat or Assad, {{it was clear}} no {{offensive}} would take place in September. During 28 and 29 August, Sadat met with Assad in Damascus, where they agreed to start the war in October. They specified October 6 as D-Day, and informed Ahmed Ismail and Tlass on 22 September, who in turn relayed the decision to the Chiefs of Staff. At the request of Ahmed Ismail, Sadat produced a presidential directive for war. Therefore, {{it was only in}} September, less than a month before the attack, that the date October 6 was finally selected as D-Day. The coordinated offensive would begin at 14:00 (Cairo Local Time). October 6 was chosen for several reasons. The speed of the water current and the tide were optimal for a crossing operation, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>most</b> of the night there was a full moon, facilitating bridge construction. The date coincided with Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement. This was an important factor in choosing October 6 for an attack; observant Jews fast on that day, abstain from the use of fire or electricity (which meant transportation would be at a standstill), and much of the Israeli army would be demobilised. October also coincided with the month of Ramadan in the Muslim Calendar, which meant that Muslim soldiers would be fasting. It was in Ramadan that the Muslims won their first victory at the Battle of Badr in the year 634. Opting for something more inspirational than the High Minarets as a name, Operation Badr was chosen by Egyptian commanders as the codename for the assault.|$|E
