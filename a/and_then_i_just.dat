It's kind of a {{hypnotic}} state that you reach after a while when you keep on playing it where words just evolve from it. So you take those words and just let them go whichever way they want...'Moonshadow'? Funny, that was in Spain, I went there alone, completely alone, {{to get away from}} a few things. And I was dancin' on the rocks there... right on the rocks where the waves were, like, blowin' and splashin'. Really, it was so fantastic. And the moon was bright, ya know, and I started dancin' and singin' and I sang that song and it stayed. It's just the kind of moment that you want to find when you're writin' songs.|$|E
500|$|Ten {{features}} a two-part track entitled [...] "Master/Slave" [...] that both opens {{and closes the}} album. The first part begins the album, before [...] "Once" [...] starts, {{and the second part}} closes the album, after [...] "Release". It begins about ten seconds after the album's closer [...] "Release" [...] as a hidden track, but both count as one track on the CD. The song is entirely instrumental (except for random unintelligible words Vedder utters throughout) with a dominant fretless bass line makes up the core of the song (which Ament referred to in a 1994 Bass Player magazine interview as [...] "my tribute to (fretless bass instrumentalist) Mick Karn"), along with some guitar and sounds that seem to come from the drums. Producer Rick Parashar stated in 2002, [...] "As I recall, I think Jeff had, like, a bass line...I heard the bass line and then we kind of were collaborating on that in the control room, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> started programming on the keyboard all this stuff; he was jamming with it and it just kind of came about like that." ...|$|E

[...] The last time they met, leaving the funeral of Dr. Rowley Pope, Jack Fingleton asked Bardsley his thoughts: [...] "I was just {{thinking}}," [...] said the old cricketer, [...] "what a great bloke old Doc was. [...] I was thinking of him, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> happened to see So-And-So across there, and I thought, Poor old So-And-So. [...] By cripes, he's looking old.

2500|$|Paul Weitz {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} the story of Grandma long before he began writing the script. He never completed the story until he had met and worked with Tomlin on the 2013 film Admission, saying that [...] "After meeting Lily, the voice and the character really clicked, I had thought about it for years, so I had a lot of it worked out in my head, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> went to a coffee shop and wrote it longhand." [...] He said that, as he wrote, he could hear her [...] "performing it in [...] head". After writing the script, he was afraid to present it to Tomlin in case she turned down the lead role. Tomlin said that she immediately connected with the character and the story; she and Weitz then spent several months editing the script together. The film marked Tomlin's first leading role in 27 years, after co-starring with Bette Midler in the 1988 comedy film Big Business.|$|E
2500|$|Thus {{began his}} {{transition}} into the brash, bombastic manager [...] "Captain" [...] Lou Albano. With a quick wit and a grating personality, Albano delivered memorable promos and earned the scorn of the wrestling audience as {{he attempted to}} dethrone World Wide Wrestling Federation superstar and WWWF World Heavyweight Champion Bruno Sammartino. Albano described the strategy behind his overblown, ranting interview style: [...] "I just remember the point I wanna bring across, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> babble before, during, and after. [...] Somehow, in the middle, I said {{the two or three}} sentences that sold tickets. [...] Mostly, I just tried to make people want to see me get my ass kicked, and along the way, hopefully the guy I was managing would catch a beating too!" [...] Growing out his hair and beard, and packing on extra pounds, Albano gave the image of a wild man. He developed a later trademark, applying rubber bands to his beard, after having seen a homeless man do the same. He also often wore a rubber band hanging from a safety pin pushed through his cheek.|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked about}} his {{opinions}} regarding an afterlife, Schuldiner responded [...] "I don't know", but elaborated that he believed [...] "this is hell", and that demons are in people, as they [...] "create evil". Although his parents are Jewish, Schuldiner did not go through any formal religious training. In the documentary, [...] "666 at Calling Death", he was asked whether Satanism {{was a part of}} his music. [...] He replied, [...] "Not at all. I really don't want to involve any type of religious theme in our music. I think that's more of a personal thing. [...] Yeah, I'm not a Satanist and I definitely don't put that into our music on purpose. I was really young when the band first started out. I was never really into writing Satanic lyrics at all, personally. [...] We did write gore lyrics, but it was more like kind of tongue-in-cheek, horror-movie type level. Nothing like encouraging people to go out and hurt themselves or anything stupid like that. It's pure fantasy-movie type, scary stuff. <b>And</b> <b>then,</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> really got into writing about reality, which is what we all have to deal with." ...|$|E

5000|$|In October 2014, {{as part of}} the {{publicity}} for then upcoming Christian-themed film Do You Believe?, in which she would be starring, she revealed that she had returned to her Christian faith, saying: [...] "I was born a Christian, sang in the choir. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> lost touch with my saviour Jesus Christ. I stopped talking to Him <b>and</b> praying. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> started talking to Jesus and I started to feel really good and I got the offer to do this film." ...|$|R

Unless you'd like something fancier." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1978, Morrison {{recalled}} that he recorded the songs about {{four weeks after}} writing them: [...] "Veedon Fleece {{was a bunch of}} songs that I wrote <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> recorded it about four weeks after I wrote it. [...] When you make an album you write some songs; you might have four songs and maybe you write two more, suddenly you've got enough songs for an album." [...] According to the drummer Dahaud Shaar, the tracks were laid down in a very informal manner: [...] "During that time I kinda haunted the studio, and Van would come in and we'd just do tracks." [...] David Hayes recalled about the recording sessions: [...] "Every night for about a week he came in with two or three new tunes and we just started playing with him." [...] Jim Rothermel also {{recalled that}} during the California recording sessions for the album the songs were often a first take and that the band members had sometimes not heard the songs previously. The strings and woodwinds were arranged by Jef Labes in a New York studio. [...] The song [...] "Come Here My Love" [...] was inspired during the week of the sessions and another song [...] "Country Fair" [...] was left over from the Hard Nose the Highway album [...] and provided a fitting sense of closure. [...] "Bulbs" [...] and [...] "Cul de Sac" [...] were recut in New York later with musicians with whom Morrison had never worked before: guitarist John Tropea, bassist Joe Macho and drummer Allen Schwarzberg. Given a rock music treatment, these songs were [...] released as the single for the album." ...|$|E

5000|$|Describing {{himself as}} “a {{complete}} history geek”, Duncan {{also has a}} huge interest in American history. He believes the greatest difference between America and Rome is that compared to Rome, America has only spent a short time on the world stage. Despite studying political science in college, Duncan {{spent much of his}} free time studying ancient Greek and Latin texts. [...] " I sort of stumbled into it, so I was reading a ton of Livy at the time, and a ton of Suetonius, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> had <b>just</b> gotten into Tacitus." ...|$|R
5000|$|TNGHT first premiered the {{unfinished}} {{version of the}} track during BBC Radio 1Xtra's Diplo & Friends in late 2012, a time which he said was before the EDM-trap trend.

5000|$|Brad Wood {{provided}} a different recording approach, structuring the drum patterns and bass lines around Phair's vocal phrases and guitar riffs, instead of recording the rhythm section first <b>and</b> <b>then</b> layering the guitars and vocals on top. Phair has commented, [...] "It was fun. Actually we just played our parts separately. I {{laid down the}} guitar, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> would <b>just</b> tell them what kind of song it would be {{and what kinds of}} instruments we needed to do. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> they would go in there and figure out a part <b>and</b> <b>then</b> do it.

Why, I've got the prettiest little ranch you ever laid eyes on, up in Glen Ellen. That's where I got stuck for that brick-yard. You {{recollect}} handling the correspondence. I only laid eyes on the ranch that one time, and I so {{fell in love with it}} that I bought it there <b>and</b> <b>then.</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> rode around the hills, and was happy as a kid out of school. I'd be a better man living in the country. The city doesn't make me better. You're plumb right there. I know it. But suppose your prayer should be answered and I'd go clean broke and have to work for day's wages?" ...|$|E

The Senate held the private meeting in the Old Senate chamber to discuss Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's threat of the so-called [...] "nuclear option", which would change the rules for Senate votes on President Obama's executive branch nominees. Wicker said he hoped the chamber's bipartisan past could serve as an inspiration for {{the debate about the}} nuclear option: [...] "I think there are concessions that can be made on both sides. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> would <b>just</b> hope that, institutionally, we can get away from this mindset." ...|$|R

60|$|I {{have just}} arrived from New York-been there ever since Christmas {{staying at the}} house of Dan Slote my Quaker City room-mate, and having a splendid time. Charley Langdon, Jack Van Nostrand, Dan and I, (all Quaker City night-hawks,) had a {{blow-out}} at Dan's' house and a lively talk over old times. We went through the Holy Land together, and I just laughed till my sides ached, at some of our reminiscences. It was the unholiest gang that ever cavorted through Palestine, but those are the best boys in the world. We needed Moulton badly. I started to make calls, New Year's Day, but I anchored for the day at the first house I came to--Charlie Langdon's sister was there (beautiful girl,) and Miss Alice Hooker, another beautiful girl, a niece of Henry Ward Beecher's. We sent the old folks home early, with instructions not to send the carriage till midnight, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> staid there and worried the life out of those girls.

6000|$|... "'Gee, Oi'd like dat, but it ain't {{for poor}} blokes the loikes of me,' said he. That {{gave me an}} idea.

They talked it all over and then they came around and asked me if I supposed Sparrer would like to join the Blue Tortoise Patrol. I told them that I was sure he wouldn't if he suspected that the invitation was charity on their part. They chewed this over {{for a while and then}} came around and said that they really would like to take him in, and there wasn't any charity about it.

6000|$|THERE {{were three}} in the meadow by the brook [...] Gathering up windrows, piling cocks of hay, [...] With an eye always lifted toward the west [...] Where an {{irregular}} sun-bordered cloud [...] Darkly advanced with a perpetual dagger [...] Flickering across its bosom. Suddenly [...] One helper, thrusting pitchfork in the ground, [...] Marched himself off the field and home. One stayed. [...] The town-bred farmer failed to understand. [...] "What is there wrong?" [...] "Something you just now said." [...] "What did I say?" [...] "About our taking pains." [...] "To cock the hay?--because it's going to shower? [...] I said {{that more than half}} an hour ago. [...] I said it to myself as much as you." [...] "You didn't know. But James is one big fool. [...] He thought you meant to find fault with his work. [...] That's what the average farmer would have meant. [...] James would take time, of course, to chew it over [...] Before he acted: he's just got round to act." [...] "He is a fool if that's the way he takes me." [...] "Don't let it bother you. You've found out something. [...] The hand that knows his business won't be told [...] To do work better or faster--those two things. [...] I'm as particular as anyone: [...] Most likely I'd have served you just the same. [...] But I know you don't understand our ways. [...] You were just talking what was in your mind, [...] What was in all our minds, and you weren't hinting. [...] Tell you a story of what happened once: [...] I was up here in Salem at a man's [...] Named Sanders with a gang of four or five [...] Doing the haying. No one liked the boss. [...] He was one of the kind sports call a spider, [...] All wiry arms and legs that spread out wavy [...] From a humped body nigh as big's a biscuit. [...] But work! that man could work, especially [...] If by so doing he could get more work [...] Out of his hired help. I'm not denying [...] He was hard on himself. I couldn't find [...] That he kept any hours--not for himself. [...] Daylight and lantern-light were one to him: [...] I've heard him pounding in the barn all night. [...] But what he liked was someone to encourage. [...] Them that he couldn't lead he'd get behind [...] And drive, the way you can, you know, in mowing-- [...] Keep at their heels and threaten to mow their legs off. [...] I'd seen about enough of his bulling tricks [...] (We call that bulling). I'd been watching him. [...] So when he paired off with me in the hayfield [...] To load the load, thinks I, Look out for trouble. [...] I built the load and topped it off; old Sanders [...] Combed it down with a rake and says, 'O. K.' [...] Everything went well till we reached the barn [...] With a big catch to empty in a bay. [...] You understand that meant the easy job [...] For the man up on top of throwing down [...] The hay and rolling it off wholesale, [...] Where on a mow it would have been slow lifting. [...] You wouldn't think a fellow'd need much urging [...] Under these circumstances, would you now? [...] But the old fool seizes his fork in both hands, [...] And looking up bewhiskered out of the pit, [...] Shouts like an army captain, 'Let her come!' [...] Thinks I, D'ye mean it? 'What was that you said?' [...] I asked out loud, so's there'd be no mistake, [...] 'Did you say, Let her come?' 'Yes, let her come.' [...] He said it over, but he said it softer. [...] Never you say a thing like that to a man, [...] Not if he values what he is. God, I'd as soon [...] Murdered him as left out his middle name. [...] I'd built the load and knew right where to find it. [...] Two or three forkfuls I picked lightly round for [...] Like meditating, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> dug in [...] And dumped the rackful on him in ten lots. [...] I looked over the side once in the dust [...] And caught sight of him treading-water-like, [...] Keeping his head above. 'Damn ye,' I says, [...] 'That gets ye!' He squeaked like a squeezed rat. [...] That was the last I saw or heard of him. [...] I cleaned the rack and drove out to cool off. [...] As I sat mopping hayseed from my neck, [...] And sort of waiting to be asked about it, [...] One of the boys sings out, 'Where's the old man?' [...] 'I left him in the barn under the hay. [...] If ye want him, ye can go and dig him out.' [...] They realized from the way I swobbed my neck [...] More than was needed something must be up. [...] They headed for the barn; I stayed where I was. [...] They told me afterward. First they forked hay, [...] A lot of it, out into the barn floor. [...] Nothing! They listened for him. Not a rustle. [...] I guess they thought I'd spiked him in the temple [...] Before I buried him, or I couldn't have managed. [...] They excavated more. 'Go keep his wife [...] Out of the barn.' Someone looked in a window, [...] And curse me if he wasn't in the kitchen [...] Slumped way down in a chair, with both his feet [...] Stuck in the oven, the hottest day that summer. [...] He looked so clean disgusted from behind [...] There was no one that dared to stir him up, [...] Or let him know that he was being looked at. [...] Apparently I hadn't buried him [...] (I may have knocked him down); but my just trying [...] To bury him had hurt his dignity. [...] He had gone to the house so's not to meet me. [...] He kept away from us all afternoon. [...] We tended to his hay. We saw him out [...] After a while picking peas in his garden: [...] He couldn't keep away from doing something." [...] "Weren't you relieved to find he wasn't dead?" [...] "No! and yet I don't know--it's hard to say. [...] I went about to kill him fair enough." [...] "You took an awkward way. Did he discharge you?" [...] "Discharge me? No! He knew I did just right." ...|$|E

5000|$|Although {{frequently}} {{funny and}} thought-provoking, Lassiter was always caustic, always contrarian, and often downright mean. He typically began his {{show with a}} topical monologue that could last anywhere from five {{minutes to an hour}} to a full three-hour shift; the monologue was usually designed to incite his listeners to the point of blind rage, at which point he would begin to accept calls from people who were furious to the point of inarticulacy. As he once put it, [...] "It dawned on me that if I talked for an hour, hour and a half, by the time I stopped these people weren't rational. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> would <b>just</b> rip them to shreds." [...] In fact, Lassiter showed extreme disdain and impatience with his callers, not hesitating to poke fun at them, subtly trap them into demonstrating their hypocrisy or lies, or even to insult them outright. [...] "Get off my phone, you subhuman pig!" [...] became one of his most famous catchphrases.|$|R
