5|$|In {{the primary}} portion of Infinity Blade, the player {{character}} travels a largely linear path through a ruined castle and fights one-on-one battles with oversized enemies. The {{path through the}} castle {{is a series of}} discreet locations where the player can pan the camera around the stationary player character to view a fully three-dimensional area. The player taps locations highlighted onscreen to trigger either a short cutscene as the player character moves to the next location, or a sword battle with an enemy. During combat, the player controls the character's sword by swiping a finger across the screen. Players can touch icons {{at the bottom of the}} screen to dodge attacks by ducking right or left, or to block attacks with a shield, which has a limited number of uses during a single battle. Players may also parry incoming attacks with an intercepting sword move that, for example, parries an attack from the left with <b>a</b> <b>swipe</b> to the left. Each of these three counters can leave the enemy vulnerable to counterattack for a short period, but incorrect counters result in damage to the player character, as reflected in the health bar. When players fail in battle en route to the God King, the game resets to the location preceding the previous battle. Enemies can perform attacks that cannot be parried or blocked—such as a shield bash—that must be dodged. Players use two special abilities via icons atop the screen: the Super Attack temporarily stuns the opponent, and magic heals or attacks as indicated by drawing a given symbol. Both require time to recharge after use. When attacking, the player can swipe in any direction, and can do specific attack combinations to deal extra damage.|$|E

2500|$|During combat, {{the player}} has five basic sword attack moves; <b>an</b> upward <b>swipe,</b> <b>a</b> {{downward}} <b>swipe,</b> <b>a</b> left <b>swipe,</b> <b>a</b> right <b>swipe,</b> and <b>a</b> thrust. Later in the game, Aragorn can use charged up versions {{of each of}} the five main attacks. The player can also use a secondary weapon to thrust attack; this weapon can be a shield, a torch or a spear. The player can also access chain attacks (attacks which increase in power with each successful attack) and special abilities such as [...] "Battle Cry" [...] (which makes allies fight harder) and [...] "Rally" [...] (which makes allies temporarily invulnerable). The player can also gain access to a bow, which can be upgraded in various ways. For example, [...] "black arrow tips" [...] can target multiple enemies at once, while [...] "eagle feathers" [...] can slow down time when the player enters first-person mode whilst aiming the bow. Another combat method is fighting on horseback, during which the player can use his sword as normal, and can also dash with his spear at the ready. The Wii version of the game is controlled via the Wii Remote. The PlayStation 3 version can be controlled via either the DualShock 3 or the PlayStation Move.|$|R

50|$|When {{fighting}} with a corvo, the wielder will not feint with the blade itself; traditionally {{it is used}} in conjunction with a rag, poncho or stick in the off-hand, which allows the bearer to parry an incoming attack. The corvo is then used to counterattack with <b>a</b> <b>swiping,</b> slashing or stabbing motion.|$|R
25|$|The British major {{even took}} <b>a</b> <b>swipe</b> at William Alexander, Lord Stirling {{who was not}} even {{involved}} in the operation. Alexander had made an unsuccessful attempt to claim a Scottish earldom between 1756 and 1762. His hard-drinking ways were well-known to British officers.|$|E
25|$|In Querétaro, Denmark were {{eliminated}} {{as they went}} from a 1–0 lead to a 5–1 battering against Spain; key player Frank Arnesen was suspended for the game after being sent off against West Germany in their last group match, for taking <b>a</b> <b>swipe</b> at German playmaker Lothar Matthäus. The Danes scored first, with a Jesper Olsen penalty, but they were then taken apart by a devastating performance from Butragueño of Spain, who scored four of his team's five goals. At the Azteca Stadium in Mexico City, England progressed to the quarter-finals comfortably when they saw off Paraguay 3–0, while Brazil brushed aside Poland 4–0. West Germany had a much harder time getting past Morocco, for whom goalkeeper Badou Zaki had an outstanding game. Morocco held out until the 87th minute, when Lothar Matthäus scored the only goal of the match with a free kick. Mexico won 2–0 against Bulgaria with an outstanding scissor-kick goal by Manuel Negrete which is honored by a remembrance plaque at the Azteca.|$|E
500|$|Guitarist {{and critic}} Bill Janovitz also {{emphasizes}} the urban, unreal quality of [...] "Visions of Johanna", {{calling it a}} [...] "sprawling epic". [...] "The journey takes Dylan through lofts, the D train, a museum, empty lots, and through snippets of overheard conversation, {{as well as a}} discussion with some 'little boy lost', who 'takes himself so seriously', and who is 'so useless and all/muttering small talk at the wall'." [...] For Janovitz, this [...] could [...] "possibly be <b>a</b> <b>swipe</b> at a critic".|$|E

50|$|If a {{fraudulent}} CNP transaction is reported, the {{acquiring bank}} hosting the merchant account that received {{the money from}} the fraudulent transaction must make restitution; whereas with <b>a</b> <b>swiped</b> (card present) transaction, the issuer of the card is liable for restitution. Because of the greater risk, some card issuers charge a greater transaction fee to merchants who routinely handle card not present transactions.|$|R
500|$|On 31 July 2005, Pratchett criticised media {{coverage}} of Harry Potter author J. K. Rowling, commenting that certain {{members of the media}} seemed to think that [...] "the continued elevation of J. K. Rowling can be achieved only {{at the expense of other}} writers". Pratchett later denied claims that this was <b>a</b> <b>swipe</b> at Rowling, and said that he was not making claims of plagiarism, but was pointing out the [...] "shared heritage" [...] of the fantasy genre. Pratchett also posted on the Harry Potter newsgroup about a media-covered exchange of views with her.|$|E
500|$|During the 1919 season, Ruth {{was used}} as a pitcher in only 17 of his 130 games and {{compiled}} an 8–5 record. Barrow used him as a pitcher mostly {{in the early part of}} the season, when the Red Sox manager still had hopes of a second consecutive pennant. By late June, the Red Sox were clearly out of the race, and Barrow had no objection to Ruth concentrating on his hitting, if only because it drew people to the ballpark. Ruth had hit a home run against the Yankees on Opening Day, and another during a month-long batting slump that soon followed. Relieved of his pitching duties, Ruth began an unprecedented spell of slugging home runs, which gave him widespread public and press attention. Even his failures were seen as majestic—one sportswriter noted, [...] "When Ruth misses <b>a</b> <b>swipe</b> at the ball, the stands quiver".|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{positively}} reviewed by critics. Walton of The Moving Picture News affirmed, {{stating that the}} film was a [...] "...well-staged, naturally acted story with a lesson. There is pathos and stern reality mixed in with fidelity and anxiety, the whole making a story of entrancing and edifying power." [...] The Moving Picture World summarized the film and remarked, [...] "The contrasts in the delineation of human nature constitute the principal points of interest, and they are worked out with full appreciation of dramatic varieties. The implied false friends have a good many counterparts, {{and the way they}} are depicted here is too graphic to be misunderstood." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror took <b>a</b> <b>swipe</b> at Bison Pictures of the New York Motion Picture Company and the Powers Picture Plays by praising the camera posing of the film and acknowledging the acting of the flower girl to be well-portrayed.|$|E

2500|$|When Borges writes [...] "The metaphysicians of Tlön are {{not looking}} for truth or even an {{approximation}} to it: they are after a kind of amazement. They consider metaphysics a branch of fantastic literature," [...] he can be seen either as anticipating the extreme relativism that underlies some postmodernism or simply as taking <b>a</b> <b>swipe</b> at those who take metaphysics too seriously.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a debate}} at Oxford Union in October 2013, {{when asked whether}} FIFA {{president}} Sepp Blatter preferred Messi or Ronaldo, Blatter paid tribute to the work ethic of the Argentine before taking <b>a</b> <b>swipe</b> at Ronaldo, claiming [...] "one of them has more expenses for the hairdresser than the other". Real Madrid demanded – and promptly received – a full apology, and the Portuguese issued his own riposte with a mock-salute celebration after scoring a penalty against Sevilla, after Blatter had described him as a [...] "commander" [...] on the pitch.|$|E

40|$|There are differing {{theories}} {{concerning the}} construction dubbed swiping by Merchant 2002. Some theories {{predict that the}} inverted preposition/wh-word order characteristic of swiping is idiosyncratic to prepositions and wh-words in particular and does not generalize to other elements. Other theories predict that <b>swiping</b> is merely <b>a</b> particular instantiation of a generalizable possibility for inverted word orders under ellipsis. In this paper I provide evidence for this latter type of theory by showing that the characteristics of swiping extend beyond prepositionals and wh-words. The generalization is that whatever can extrapose and be extracted from can enter into <b>a</b> <b>swiping</b> like construction...|$|R
2500|$|... iOS 9 adds {{a number}} of {{features}} to the iPad to improve productivity. These include Slide Over, Split Screen, and Picture in Picture, for enhanced multitasking, similar to the experience found on OS X El Capitan.

This app takes up 1/3 of the screen and sticks {{to the right side}} of the screen, while interactivity within the full-screen app is disabled while left inactive in the background.

He was [...] "advised" [...] not to insure against rain in his benefit match, which proved a wise decision. In a match at Ilford, he conceived {{that if he were}} to take a catch off a particular ball bowled by leg-spinner Bill Greensmith, he should marry a woman named Ann who was keener on him than he was on her – Greensmith bowled a long hop, the batsman took <b>a</b> <b>swipe,</b> Dodds held the catch, and married Ann.|$|E
