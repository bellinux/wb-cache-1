5|$|Saville succeeded Claire L. Chennault as America's leading fighter {{aircraft}} tactician. With Benjamin S. Kelsey, Saville co-wrote {{the technical}} specifications {{which led to}} the Lockheed P-38 Lightning and the Bell P-39 Airacobra fighters. In 1949 he selected the North American F-86 Sabre as America's main defense fighter, and in 1950 he approved a guided <b>air-to-air</b> <b>missile</b> system that would be carried aboard the proposed supersonic 1954 interceptor; the missile produced was the AIM-4 Falcon.|$|E
5|$|The Swiss {{acquired}} a single Mirage for testing, as a preface to production under license of 100Dassault Mirage IIIS interceptors, with strengthened wings, airframe, and undercarriage. Avionics would differ as well, with the Thomson-CSF Cyrano II radar {{replaced by the}} Hughes Electronics TARAN-18system, to provide the Mirage IIIS compatibility with the AIM-4 Falcon <b>air-to-air</b> <b>missile.</b> The Mirage IIIS {{was intended to be}} operated as an interceptor, ground attack, and reconnaissance aircraft, using wing pods for the photographic mission.|$|E
5|$|A smaller, single-panel oil {{painting}} by Lichtenstein {{around the same}} time, Tex!, has a similar composition, with a plane at the lower left shooting an <b>air-to-air</b> <b>missile</b> at a second plane that is exploding in the upper right, with a word bubble. The same issue of All-American Men of War was the inspiration {{for at least three}} other Lichtenstein paintings, Okay Hot-Shot, Okay!, Brattata and Blam, in addition to Whaam! and Tex! The graphite pencil sketch, Jet Pilot was also from that issue. Several of Lichtenstein's other comics-based works are inspired by stories about Johnny Flying Cloud written by Robert Kanigher and illustrated by Novick, including Okay Hot-Shot, Okay!, Jet Pilot and Von Karp.|$|E

5|$|Starting in the 1980s, the Stinger and AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air {{missiles}} and the AGM-122 Sidearm anti-radiation missile were evaluated for use upon the AH-64. The Stinger was initially selected; the U.S. Army was also considering the Starstreak <b>air-to-air</b> <b>missile.</b> External fuel tanks {{can also be}} carried on the stub wings to increase range and mission time. The stub-wing pylons have mounting points for maintenance access; these mountings {{can be used to}} secure externally personnel for emergency transportation. Stinger missiles are often used on non-U.S. Apaches, as foreign forces do not have as many air superiority aircraft to control the skies. The AH-64E initially lacked the ability to use the Stinger to make room for self-defense equipment, but the capability was re-added following a South Korean demand.|$|E
5|$|Su-25SM weapon suite {{has been}} {{expanded}} {{with the addition}} of the Vympel R-73 highly agile <b>air-to-air</b> <b>missile</b> (albeit without helmet mounted cuing and only the traditional longitudinal seeker mode) and the S-13T 130mm rockets (carried in five-round B-13 pods) with blast-fragmentation and armour-piercing warheads. Further, the Kh-25ML and Kh-29L Weapon Employment Profiles have been significantly improved, permitting some complex missile launch scenarios to be executed, such as: firing two consecutive missiles on two different targets in a single attack pass. The GSh-30-2 cannon (250-round magazine) has received three new reduced rate-of-fire modes: 750, 375 and 188 Rounds per Minute. The Su-25SM was also given new BD3-25 under-wing pylons.|$|E
5|$|USAF F-105s were {{escorted by}} F-4s {{to protect them}} against enemy fighters. However, the Thunderchief was officially {{credited}} with 27.5 air-to-air victories against North Vietnamese aircraft {{at the cost of}} 17 aircraft lost to enemy fighters (North Vietnamese pilots claimed to have shot down an additional 23 F-105s but none have been confirmed by USAF). All victories were against MiG-17s. Of these 24.5 were shot down with cannon fire (one victory was shared with an F-4), and three with AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles. One F-105F is unofficially credited with downing three MiGs—one by <b>air-to-air</b> <b>missile,</b> the second by cannon fire and the third by jettisoning the centerline rack full of bombs directly into the path of a surprised MiG.|$|E

5|$|In October 1995, Pakistan was {{reportedly}} {{to select a}} Western company {{by the end of}} the year to provide and integrate the FC-1's avionics, which was expected to go into production by 1999. The avionics were said to include radar, Inertial navigation system, Head-up display, and Multi-function displays. Competing bids came from Thomson-CSF with a variant of the Radar Doppler Multitarget (RDY), SAGEM with a similar avionics package to those used in the ROSE upgrade project, and Marconi Electronic Systems with its Blue Hawk radar. FIAR's (now SELEX Galileo) Grifo S7 radar was expected to be selected due to the company's ties with the PAF. In February 1998, Pakistan and China signed a letter of intent covering airframe development. Russia's Klimov offered a variant of the RD-33 turbofan engine to power the fighter. In April 1999, South Africa's Denel offered to arm the Super 7 with the T-darter beyond-visual-range (BVR) <b>air-to-air</b> <b>missile</b> (AAM), rather than the previously reported R-Darter. Previously in 1987, Pratt & Whitney offered the Super-7 project three engine options; PW1212, F404, and PW1216, with local manufacturing in either China or Pakistan. Rolls Royce offered its RB199-127/128 turbofan engine; this plan was scrapped in 1989.|$|E
