40|$|The barriers, enthalpies, {{and rate}} {{constants}} for {{the addition of}} methyl radical <b>to</b> <b>the</b> double bonds of a selection of alkene, carbonyl, and thiocarbonyl species (CH 2 =Z, CH 3 CH=Z, and (CH 3) 2 C=Z, where Z = CH 2, O, or S) and for the reverse β-scission reactions have been investigated using high-level ab inito calculations. The results are rationalized {{with the aid of}} the curve-crossing model. The addition reactions proceed via early transition structures in all cases. The barriers for addition of methyl radical to C=C bonds are largely determined by <b>the</b> reaction exothermicities. <b>Addition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> unsubstituted carbon center of C=C double bonds is favored over <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> substituted carbon center, both kinetically (lower barriers) and thermodynamically (greater exothermicities). <b>The</b> barriers for <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> C=O bonds are influenced by both the reaction exothermicity and the singlet-triplet gap of <b>the</b> substrate. <b>Addition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> carbon center is favored over <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> oxygen, also both thermodynamically and kinetically. For <b>the</b> thiocarbonyl systems, <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> carbon center is thermodynamically favored over <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> sulfur. However, in this case, the reaction is contrathermodynamic, <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sulfur center having a lower barrier due to spin density considerations. Entropic differences among corresponding addition and β-scission reactions are relatively minor, and the differences in reaction rates are thus dominated by differences in the respective reaction barriers...|$|R
5|$|One of {{the first}} <b>additions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> DRR {{occurred}} in March 1956 when new covered shelters were built on each end of Frontierland Station's depot building.

5|$|The {{demolition}} of the building's {{north and west}} side began in October 2016. The west side (home to the later <b>additions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> building) was fully demolished by March 2017, with the other portions of the complex scheduled to be demolished at a later date.|$|E
5|$|The state sent nearly 400,000 Hoosiers who enlisted or were drafted. More than 11,783 Hoosiers {{died in the}} {{conflict}} and another 17,000 were wounded.

5|$|<b>Additions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> end musical number, {{including}} visual gags such as Bob {{appearing in}} uniform, were added after the animatics. The crew felt that watching the character singing {{would not be}} interesting enough {{and they had to}} include these gags to make it work. The Simpsons creator Matt Groening was surprised when he saw the additions, because he originally thought they were silly and would not appear in the final cut, but he has grown to like them.|$|E
5|$|After the war, the {{architect}} A. G. Biggs carried out substantial <b>additions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> castle between 1962 and 1968, including remodelling the western range {{to provide for}} more female accommodation, using stone from the second East Cowes Castle, an 18th and 19th-century stately home, which had been demolished the previous year.

5|$|By 1907 President Theodore Roosevelt {{more than}} doubled the forest reserve acreage, and Congress responded by {{limiting}} the President’s ability to proclaim new reserves. The National Forest System underwent a major reorganization in 1908, and in 1911 Congress authorized new <b>additions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> system {{under the authority of}} the Weeks Act. The management goals provided by the Organic Act were expanded upon by the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960 to include “outdoor recreation, range, timber, watershed, and wildlife and fish purposes” {{as well as for the}} establishment of wilderness areas.|$|E
5|$|During the Chola era, Kanchipuram {{was not the}} capital, but {{the kings}} had a palace in the town and lot of {{development}} was extended eastwards. During the Vijayanagara period, the population rose to 25,000. There were no notable <b>additions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> town's infrastructure during British rule.

5|$|In 1974, King Faisal added 40,440 {{square metres}} to the mosque. The {{area of the}} mosque was also {{expanded}} {{during the reign of}} King Fahd in 1985.

5|$|In 1985, the Utah Department of Transportation petitioned {{to extend}} US666 {{northwest}} to Richfield, but {{the proposal was}} rejected. The proposed extension followed SR95, SR24, and SR119. A concurrency with US191 would have been routed through Blanding and Monticello to connect {{to the rest of}} the route. One of the reasons cited for rejecting the proposal was that portions of SR24 were not built to standards desired for <b>additions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Highway System.|$|E

Angels directing djinns are also painted on tiles in the ceiling, which also reference King Solomon. Kala Burj was used as a summer pavilion.|$|E
