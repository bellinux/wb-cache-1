5|$|Sam & Max Hit the Road was {{developed}} by a small team at LucasArts, {{many of whom had}} previous experience working on other LucasArts adventure games. The game was designed by Sean Clark, Michael Stemmle, Sam & Max creator Steve Purcell and his future wife Collette Michaud, all of whom had worked on Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis. Sam and Max first appeared as video game characters as internal testing material for SCUMM engine programmers recently employed by LucasArts; Steve Purcell created animated versions of the characters and an office backdrop for the programmers to practice on. Soon after, Sam & Max comic strips by Steve Purcell were published in LucasArts' quarterly newsletter. After a positive reaction from fans to the strips <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> wish to use new characters and settings after the success of the Monkey Island and Maniac Mansion franchises, LucasArts offered in 1992 to create a video game out of the characters.|$|E

25|$|When the Abarcas left Iguala {{after the}} mass {{kidnapping}} in September 2014, law enforcement began an investigation to locate all the properties {{owned by the}} couple and their families.

After ruling out Monterrey as a possible hideout, authorities concentrated on three properties in Iztapalapa where they believed the couple was hiding. Through the couple's real estate businesses, authorities were also able to link Berumen to the family once more and locate her properties in Iztapalapa. In one of the properties, investigators noticed something unusual: they regularly saw a woman (now known to be Berumen) going in <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> property that {{was thought to be}} abandoned.
