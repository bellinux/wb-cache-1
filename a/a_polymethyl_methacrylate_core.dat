The different reactivity ratios of MA and AA toward N-isopropylacrylamide originates p(MA-N) and p(N-AA) particles with carboxylate charges supposedly located, preferentially, in the close vicinity of the core and at the shell periphery, respectively. The corresponding Swelling features of these nanoparticles are addressed over {{a broad range of}} pH values (4 to 7. 5), NaNO 3 concentrations (3 to 200 mM), and temperatures (15 to 45 degrees C) by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and small angle neutron scattering (SANS). DLS shows that the swelling of the particle shells increases their thickness from similar to 10 to 90 nm with decreasing temperature, ionic strength, or increasing pH, with the effect being more pronounced for p(N-AA) whose lower critical solution temperature is shifted to higher values compared to that of p(MA-N). Potentiometric titration and electrokinetic results further reflect the easier dissociation of carboxyl groups in p(N-AA) and a marked heterogeneous interfacial swelling of the latter with decreasing solution salt content. The DLS response of both particles is attributed to the multiresponsive nature of a peripheral dilute shell, while SANS only probes the presence of a quasi-solvent-free dense polymer layer, condensed on the core surface. The thickness of that layer slightly increases from similar to 6 to 9. 5 mu with increasing temperature from 15 to 45 degrees C (at 15 mM NaNO 3 and pH 5) due to the collapse of the outer dilute shell layer.

40|$|Electron spin {{resonance}} (ESR) spectroscopy {{has been}} employed, {{together with the}} cryogenic quenching technique, to monitor occluded radical concentrations during methyl methacrylate-butyl acrylate core-shell polymerizations. Occluded radicals are only detected during the preparation of <b>poly(methyl</b> <b>methacrylate)</b> <b>cores</b> (seeds) presumably because a higher mobility of unterminated chains in poly(butyl acrylate) seeds reduces steady state concentrations. Addition of either butyl acrylate or methyl methacrylate as a second charge of (shell) monomer to <b>a</b> <b>poly(methyl</b> <b>methacrylate)</b> seed results in an immediate decrease in the occluded radical concentration to below that of the detection limit of the electron spin resonance spectrometer.
