London's theatre district is here, as are many cinemas, bars, clubs, and restaurants, including the city's Chinatown district (in Soho), <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>to</b> the east is Covent Garden, an area housing speciality shops. The city {{is the home}} of Andrew Lloyd Webber, whose musicals have dominated the West End theatre since the late 20th century. The United Kingdom's Royal Ballet, English National Ballet, Royal Opera, and English National Opera are based in London and perform at the Royal Opera House, the London Coliseum, Sadler's Wells Theatre, and the Royal Albert Hall, as well as touring the country.|$|E
25|$|The Museo Caracas (also Museo Santana, or Museo Crillo) {{is located}} on the ground floor, though one of the rooms is reached via a narrow wooden stairway. The ground floor {{contains}} works by Venezuela's most celebrated painters and many other historic artifacts. Four of the Palacio's rooms are used for exhibiting some 3,000 artifacts of artistic or historic interest. In Room 2, there are paintings of two of Venezuela's historic presidents: Joaquín Crespo (1841–1898) by Arturo Michelena <b>and,</b> <b>just</b> <b>to</b> the left, José Tadeo Monagas (1784–1868) by Martín Tovar y Tovar. Room 3 displays many of Santana's small carved figures representing Venezuelan celebrities from the early 20th century. Room 4 displays flags and banners including one from 1533 which belonged to the Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro. General Antonio José de Sucre presented it to Bolívar when he freed Venezuela from Spanish rule. Room 5 displays paintings by Venezuela's historic artists including Armando Reverón, Emilio Boggio, Rafael Monasterios, Federico Brandt and Manuel Cabré. Miniature paintings of the rural scenes drawn by Raul Santana are also on display. Bolivar is depicted in the heavens on a ceiling mural.|$|E
500|$|Shaw's {{admiration for}} Mussolini and Stalin {{demonstrated}} his growing belief that dictatorship {{was the only}} viable political arrangement. When the Nazi Party {{came to power in}} Germany in January 1933, Shaw described Hitler as [...] "a very remarkable man, a very able man", and professed himself proud to be the only writer in England who was [...] "scrupulously polite <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>to</b> Hitler". His principal admiration was for Stalin, whose regime he championed uncritically throughout the decade. Shaw saw the 1939 Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact as a triumph for Stalin who, he said, now had Hitler under his thumb.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, Backspacer {{displays}} {{a more positive}} outlook than the band's last few albums. Vedder credited the election of President Barack Obama as inspiration for the optimistic lyrics. Regarding the lyrics, Vedder said, [...] "I've tried, over the years, to be hopeful in the lyrics, and I think that's going to be easier now." [...] Gossard stated, [...] "We've {{made a couple of}} political and pointed records, the last two in particular, <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>to</b> move away from that is great, because it allows you {{to go back to that}} when you need to and it refreshes everybody, and it comes down to a beat and a melody and your friends and a lyric and a poem and something that's important to you." [...] Vedder stated he did not spend [...] "more than half hour" [...] writing the lyrics to each song: [...] "If it’s not gonna happen quick then I don’t wanna do it, because it means there’s another one out there that is gonna happen quick, and is gonna hit you like a lightning bolt." ...|$|E
500|$|Elizabeth Henstridge {{described}} the episode as [...] "a coming-of-age story. I think we see Simmons at the start, and she’s {{never really been}} combat ready ... we see her have to survive, <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>to</b> see her go on this journey from complete despair". Henstridge also noted thriller elements in the episode. On the moment in [...] "4,722 Hours" [...] where Simmons loses hope, Henstridge explained, [...] "I never thought we'd see her get to that place ... It justifies her relationship with Will, too, because {{she was ready to}} end it all and {{he was the one who}} pulled her back from the brink." [...] Concerning that relationship with new character Will Daniels, the executive producers worked with Titley to try to make it feel earned in the episode, given the fan following of 'FitzSimmons' (the potential relationship between Simmons and Leo Fitz). Executive producer Jed Whedon also noted on this that the episode [...] "wasn’t a story about the two of them on this planet, but a story about Fitz hearing this and how he will respond. He breaks your heart, at the end, she breaks your heart, and hopefully, you’re feeling for all three involved." ...|$|E
500|$|Blakeney Chapel is {{a ruined}} {{building}} on the Norfolk coast of England. Despite its name, {{it is in the}} parish of Cley next the Sea, not the adjoining village of Blakeney, and was probably not a chapel. The building stood on a raised mound or [...] "eye" [...] on the seaward end of the coastal marshes, less than [...] from the sea <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>to</b> the north of the current channel of the River Glaven where it turns to run parallel to the shoreline. It consisted of two rectangular rooms of unequal size, and appears to be intact in a 1586 map, but is shown as ruins in later charts. Only the foundations and part of a wall still remain. Three archaeological investigations between 1998 and 2005 provided more detail of the construction, and showed two distinct periods of active use. Although it is described as a chapel on several maps, there is no documentary or archaeological evidence to suggest that it had any religious function. A small hearth, probably used for smelting iron, is the only evidence of a specific activity on the site.|$|E

500|$|For DeLonge, he had {{developed}} an [...] "itch to do something where he didn't feel locked in to what Blink was." [...] According to DeLonge, Box Car Racer was not [...] "meant {{to be a real}} band," [...] but rather [...] "something to do in some spare time that was really only expected to be on the low list of the totem pole of priorities in my life, <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>to</b> have an experimental creative outlet." [...] The project was at first solely acoustic guitar-based; he considered it in its earliest stages to be a [...] "Violent Femmes-esque acoustic record". The unnamed project went through other names, such as The Kill, and the album was initially titled Et tu, Brute?. He eventually settled on the name Box Car Racer, which was actually the name of a band Barker was in just after high school that DeLonge liked. He began writing songs {{about the end of the}} world, and connected it thematically with the biblical Book of Revelation and World War II. When reading about the war, DeLonge was [...] "freaked out" [...] to learn that Fat Man, the atomic bomb that was detonated over Nagasaki, was dropped from the B-29 bomber Bockscar (commonly misspelled Boxcar).|$|E
500|$|The {{foremost}} {{business and}} political figure in southern Africa at this time was Cecil Rhodes, a vicar's son who had arrived from England in 1870, aged 17. Since entering the diamond trade at Kimberley in 1871, Rhodes had gained near-complete domination of the world diamond market {{with the help of}} Charles Rudd, Alfred Beit and other business associates, as well as the generous financial backing of Nathan Mayer Rothschild. Rhodes was {{also a member of the}} Cape Parliament, having been elected in 1881. Amid the European Scramble for Africa, he envisioned the annexation to the British Empire of territories that would connect the Cape, at Africa's southern tip, with Cairo, the Egyptian city at the northern end of the continent, and allow for the construction of a railway linking the two. This ambition was directly challenged in the south by the presence of the Boer republics <b>and,</b> <b>just</b> <b>to</b> the north of them, Lobengula's domains. The fact that the Zambezi–Limpopo region did not fall into any of the [...] "spheres of influence" [...] defined at the [...] Berlin Conference further complicated matters; the Transvaalers, Germans and Portuguese were all also showing interest in the area, much to the annoyance of both Lobengula and Rhodes.|$|E
500|$|Plutarch {{says that}} upon {{hearing that the}} Persian forces were {{gathering}} at Aspendos, Cimon sailed from Cnidus (in Caria) with 200 triremes. It is highly likely that Cimon had assembled this force because the Athenians had had some warning of a forthcoming Persian campaign to re-subjugate the Asiatic Greeks. Certainly, no other league business would have required such a great force. Cimon may have been waiting in Caria because he expected the Persians to march straight into Ionia, along the Royal road from Sardis. According to Plutarch, Cimon sailed with these 200 triremes to the Greek city of Phaselis (in Lycia) but was refused admittance. He therefore began ravaging the lands of Phaselis, but with the mediation of the Chian contingent of his fleet, the people of Phaselis agreed to join the league. They were to contribute troops to the expedition, and to pay the Athenians ten talents. The fact that Cimon pre-emptively sailed to and captured Phaselis suggests that he anticipated a Persian campaign to capture the coastal cities (as outlined [...] above). The presence of both army and navy at Aspendos may have persuaded him that {{there was to be}} no immediate assault on Ionia. By capturing Phaselis, the furthest east Greek city in Asia Minor (<b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>to</b> the west of the Eurymedon), he effectively blocked the Persian campaign before it had begun, denying them the first naval base they needed to control. Taking further initiative, Cimon then moved to directly attack the Persian fleet at Aspendos.|$|E
