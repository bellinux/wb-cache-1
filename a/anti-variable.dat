40|$|CD 4 can {{physically}} {{associate with}} the CD 3 -T-cell receptor complex as visualized in cocapping experiments. This association occurs when the T-cell receptor is cross-linked by certain <b>anti-variable</b> region antibodies that appear to induce a conformational change in the receptor such that it associate with CD 4. Similar association has been observed in earlier studies with the same cloned helper T cell when the physiological ligand, antigen-class II major histocompatibility complex molecule, is bound by the T-cell receptor. The ability of anti-T-cell receptor antibodies to induce the T-cell receptor-CD 4 association correlates with a 100 -fold increase {{in the ability of}} the antibody to activate the T cell. This suggests that the complex of CD 4 and the T-cell receptor act synergistically in T-cell activation, thus readily explaining the commonly observed association of CD 4 expression with class II major histocompatibility complex-restricted antigen recognition. This association could also play a role in infection by human immunodeficiency virus...|$|E
40|$|Two basic {{types of}} factors {{reacting}} with anti-I region (anti-Ia) antisera are compared, those derived from macrophage-like antigen presenting cells and others derived from T-lymphocytes, {{of either the}} suppressor or helper type. Despite the common property of reacting with anti-Ia antisera, {{the two sets of}} factors differ by many criteria. Macrophages, upon culture with antigen, release complexes of Ia antigen and a fragment of the original immunogen. This material is only produced by responder macrophages and thus appears to be a soluble Ir gene product. The genetic restriction of the T-macrophage interaction was investigated in chimeras, and {{it was found that the}} host environment as well as the donor genotype was of importance in determining restrictions, which were thus not really directed to "self. " There was no evidence for intrinsic T-cell Ir genes, as nonresponder stem cells developed into responder T-cells in a (responder X nonresponder) F 1 environment. However, these cells only responded in the presence of responder macrophages. Specific T-cell factors are different in nature. These all react with anti-Ia antisera, but the nature or function of the T-cell Ia is unknown. The basic structure involves a VARIAble region" responsible for antigen binding which, as it reacts with anti-idiotype antisera and <b>anti-variable</b> region framework antisera is an immunoglobulin variable region. There is also a "constant region," defined by its biological properties as well as by specific rabbit antisera. This two-region nature of specific factors is reminiscent of immunoglobulin structure and it is a reasonable hypothesis that the constant region is linked to the Ig cluster of genes...|$|E
40|$|The {{cytotoxic}} reaction {{mediated by}} cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) {{consists of three}} phases: first, the CTL binds to the target cell; next, the CTL is triggered to lyse the target cell; and in the third phase, the CTL detaches from the target cell which is lysed {{in the absence of}} the CTL. Recently, we obtained evidence that human alloreactive CTL clones initially adhere to target cells without the involvement of the interaction between the T cell receptor (Tcr) and its specific target antigen. In the present study, we investigated the effect of monoclonal antibodies specific for the Tcr on the cytotoxic reaction of three CD 8 + HLA-A 2 -specific CTL clones, using a single cell assay in which the binding event can be distinguished from the post-binding (lytic) phase of the cytolytic reaction. It was found that monoclonal antibodies directed at a variable part of the Tcr do not affect the binding phase but strongly block the lytic phase of the cytotoxic reaction. An anti-constant region Tcr antibody and an anti-CD 3 reagent had a similar effect on the two phases of the reaction as the <b>anti-variable</b> part Tcr antibodies. In contrast, antibodies specific for LFA- 1 strongly blocked the adhesion phase but did not affect the lytic phase. Antibodies specific for CD- 8 had intermediate effects. They could block both the adhesion as well as the lytic phase. The effect of anti-CD 8 appeared to be dependent on the CTL clone tested. One clone was found to be inhibited in the adhesion phase, but not in the lytic phase, whereas anti-CD 8 hardly blocked the adhesion phase of two other CTL clones, but affected the lytic step of those clones. Our data indicate that LFA- 1 is a major adhesion molecule in the CTL reaction, whereas the Tcr/CD 3 complex is implicated in a phase after the initial formation of conjugates. CD 8 is associated with both steps in the cytolytic reaction. In addition to its minor role in the adhesion phase, our data suggest strongly that CD- 8 is involved in the triggering phase of the cytolytic reactio...|$|E

A Escherichia coli enteropatogênica (EPEC), um dos principais agentes etiológicos das diarréias infantis no nosso país, é genética e fenotipicamente relacionada com a E. coli enterohemorrágica (EHEC) que além de provocar diarréia é responsável por complicações como síndrome hemolítica urêmica (HUS) e colite hemorrágica (HC). Embora a EHEC seja considerada emergente pela OMS, no Brasil poucos casos de complicações como HUS e HC foram reportados. O mecanismo de patogenicidade comum entre EPEC e EHEC é conhecido como a lesão ättaching and effacingn̈os microvilos do enterócito. Esta lesão é mediada por um conjunto de fatores de virulência, dentre eles a intimina. A intimina é uma proteína de membrana externa, responsável pelo íntimo contato da bactéria com o enterócito, possui uma região N-terminal que é altamente conservada e uma região C-terminal que é variável. De acordo com a região variável, existem vários subtipos de intimina, dentre eles as intiminas &# 945; &# 946; e &# 947;. Uma infecção por EPE-C ou EHE-C induz a uma resposta de anticorpos anti-intimina no soro e no colostro. No presente trabalho, foram determinados os anticorpos contra as regiões variáveis &# 945; &# 946; e &# 947; e a região conservada em 100 amostras de soro e em 54 colostros de adultos saudáveis da Grande São Paulo. As concentrações de IgG sérico e de IgA secretora foram determinadas por ELISA utilizando como antígeno proteínas purificadas obtidas de bactérias recombinantes de cada intimina e os resultados foram submetidos a análise estatística. Foram também {{realizadas}} absorções com as bactérias recombirrantes e ensaios de inibição de adesão. Primeiramente observamos que nossa população apresenta anticorpos séricos e secretores reativos com a região conservada e as regiões variáveis das intiminas &# 945; &# 946; e &# 947;, e que existe uma correlação positiva entre os, diferentes grupos de dados, mostrando assim uma reatividade cruzada parcial entre os anticorpos anti-intiminas, este fato foi confirmado com as absorções e com os ensaios de adesão. A concentração de anticorpos IgA no colostro é mais alta que IgG no soro e a concentração de anticorpos anti-região conservada da intimina no soro se encontra elevada quando comparada com as outras três determinações. Em ensaio de adesão em células HEp- 2, foi verificado que anticorpos anti-região variável inibem a adesão de EPEC 0127 :H 6 numa porcentagem maior que os anticorpos anti-região conservada. Apresença de anticorpos anti-região variável da intimina &# 947; sugere mais uma vez a possível proteção contra a EHEC. Em conjunto, nossos resultados corroboram com a idéia de que nossa população desenvolve uma imunidade natural resultante da exposição a linhagens de E. Coli ou outras bactérias presentes no ambiente, que confere uma proteção contra. EHEC, mesmo não sendo esta bactéria tão freqüente no nosso meio. Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) is {{a leading}} cause of infantile diarrhea in developing countries, and has many genetic and antigenic similarittes with enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC). EHEC can cause a variety of uman illnesses ranging from uncomplicated diarrhea to haemorrhagic colitis and haemolytic uremic syndrome. EHEC strains share with EPEC the ability to induce the attaching and effacing lesion (A/E) onto the human enterocyte membrane mediated by virulence factors codified by the patogenicity island LEE, as the type III secretion system, Esps, intimin and Tir. The infection with EPEC and EHEC induces the production of antibodies reactive with these virulence factors. Intimin is an outer membrane protein that mediates intimate attachment in the host cells, upon interaction with its- translocated receptor Tir. This protein shows high conservationin the N-terminal region and variability in the last C-terminal 280 amino acids. Many subtypes of intimins, like &# 945;, &# 946; and &# 947;, were described according to the variable region. In this work we determined the concentration of IgG antibodies in 100 serum samples and IgA antibodies in 54 colostrum samples reactive with the variable regions &# 945;, &# 946; and &# 947; intimins and the conserved region in healthy Brazilian adutts, living in São Paulo. The concentrations of seric IgG and secretor IgA anti-intimin antibodies were determined by ELISA with purified proteins obtained from recombinant bacteria expressing the conserved and the variable regions, and then the results were submitted to statistical analysis. Some absorptions and adhesion assays were performed with the aim of investigate cross reactions among the various antibodies. Firstly we observed that our poputation has seric and secretory antibodies reactive with conserved and variable regions of &# 945;, &# 946; and &# 947; intimins, and there are a positive correlation among these antibodies in serum and colostrum, showing a partial cross reactivity among anti-intimins antibodies. This was confirmed by the absorptions and adhesion assays. IgA antibodies in colostrum were higher than IgG in serum, what could be related with the profective effect of breastfeeding against EPEC infection in infants. The seric antibodies anti-conserved region were higher compared to the other three determinations. The results obtained in the adhesion assays showed that the percentage of inhibition adhesion to EPEC 0127 :H 6 serotype with <b>anti-variable</b> regions antibodies was higher than anti-conserved regions. The presence of anti-&# 947; variable region suggests the possible protection against EHEC. Taken together, our results suggest that our population develop a natural immunity {{as a result of the}} direct contact with E. coli strains or other bacteria present in the environment, which confers protection against EHEC, although it is not frequent in our population...|$|E
