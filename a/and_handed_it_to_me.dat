25|$|You may be {{too young}} to remember, but in 1971, during a Test match, I {{collided}} with England fast bowler John Snow and lost my bat. Snow picked it up <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> But at the time, many papers wrote that Snow had flung the bat at me. It all depends {{on your point of}} view, or what you are trying to portray...|$|E
60|$|Then with a self-satisfied smirk he half-cocked {{the rifle}} <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> ready for action.|$|E
60|$|He drew a {{card from}} his pocket, <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I read it with ill-concealed curiosity.|$|E
60|$|The Inspector {{took one}} from an {{envelope}} <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> him.|$|R
60|$|Patiently {{she took}} it off the chimney-piece <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Philip.|$|R
60|$|The {{young lady}} refolded the letter, <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the boy.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{handed him}} both. After several futile efforts {{he succeeded in}} writing a few words. Then he folded up the note, <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was with}} Mr. Cole on {{business}} {{an hour and}} a half ago. He had just read Elton's letter as I was shewn in, <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> directly." ...|$|E
6000|$|My visitor fumbled in his raiment, drew forth a soiled card, <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Upon it was written, {{in plain}} but unsteadily formed characters, the name [...] "Michob Ader." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{took the}} {{revolver}} {{from his pocket}} <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> his companion.|$|R
60|$|Ashe gave in. He {{produced}} a coin <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> her gloomily.|$|R
60|$|The old man opened another bottle grudgingly, <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the boy.|$|R
60|$|I {{jumped up}} {{in a state}} of ecstasy. Just as I had thrown my arms round Mrs. Staveley's neck, the servant came in with a letter, <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|He dived {{into his}} breast-pocket, became {{motionless}} for ten seconds, then woke {{up again and}} produced her letter. He drew it clumsily from its envelope, <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> silently.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} {{me for the first}} time. Did she believe me? or did she still doubt? Before I could decide, she took a letter from her pocket, opened it, <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|Roche sealed up {{the letter}} {{he had been}} writing, <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Hunterleys.|$|R
60|$|He took it {{from his}} pocket <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Stirling, who {{wrinkled}} his brows.|$|R
60|$|Holmes {{scribbled}} {{a receipt}} upon {{a sheet of}} his note-book <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let {{me look at}} {{that one}} of your own," [...] said I to the man, as though it were merely a subject for {{experimental}} inquiry. Larry, accustomed to obedience, took off the shoe <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{not from}} Minna," [...] he said; [...] "the {{handwriting}} is strange to me. Perhaps my father {{knows something about}} it." [...] He turned to his father's letter; read it; <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> without a word of remark.|$|E
60|$|Whose or whither bound, {{we could}} not even conjecture. When they had come close enough to make us out at all, Kantos Kan's {{operator}} received a radio-aerogram, which he immediately handed to my companion. He read the thing <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|Holmes wrote a name upon a slip {{of paper}} <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the Premier.|$|R
60|$|I {{took from}} my breast pocket Barbara's photograph, <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> her in silence.|$|R
60|$|The clerk {{wrote the}} address {{on a piece of}} paper <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] I {{answered}} briefly, as Hans put {{the charge}} of powder into the rifle, and drove home the wad. Then, taking a bullet from Retief's hand, he rammed that down on {{to the top of}} it, capped the gun, <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|My {{first look}} was at Romayne. He {{took off his}} hat, <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> with a smile. His adversary's bullet had cut a piece out of {{the brim of his}} hat, on the right side. He had {{literally}} escaped by a hair-breadth.|$|E
60|$|He {{took from}} his pocket a little silver-clasped morocco case, <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I opened it. Inside there was the {{photograph}} of a woman. She was tall and slight, and strangely picturesque with her large vague eyes and loosened hair. She looked like a clairvoyante, and was wrapped in rich furs.|$|E
60|$|She reached {{mechanically}} {{into the}} envelope, {{took out the}} letter, <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> him.|$|R
60|$|He drew a big di'mond {{ring off}} of 'is finger <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Sam.|$|R
60|$|He hastened up {{and dipped}} a cup {{into the water}} <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> her.|$|R
6000|$|... "See here, Harlowe, I don't {{feel like}} joking in a ghostly law office after midnight. Here are your facts. Yuba Bill, the driver, stole a bag from this passenger, Wiles, or Smiles, <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{to insure the}} return of my own. I found in it some papers {{concerning}} my case. There they are. Do with them what you like." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{took the}} {{telegram}} {{out of his}} pocket, <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> It was dated from Poplar at twelve o'clock. [...] "Go to Baker Street at once," [...] it said. [...] "If I have not returned, wait for me. I am close on the track of the Sholto gang. You can come with us to-night {{if you want to}} be in at the finish." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{took out}} his {{revolver}} <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> ‘You see,’ he said, ‘I could have killed you even yet. But I am dying, as you say; nothing could save me; and my bill is long enough already. Dear me, dear me,’ he said, looking in my face with a curious, puzzled, and pathetic look, like a dull child at school, ‘if there be a judgment afterwards, my bill is long enough.’ ...|$|E
60|$|Then he {{took the}} epistle {{out of his pocket}} <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Lady Mabel.|$|R
50|$|The race {{restarted}} on lap 55. Logano gave up {{the lead}} on lap 62 <b>to</b> pit <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> back <b>to</b> Harvick. Danica Patrick gave up fifth to pit on lap 84. Harvick pitted from the lead on lap 84 <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Brad Keselowski, who {{gave up the}} lead to pit the next time by <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Kyle Busch. Debris on the front stretch brought out the third caution of the race on lap 90. Harvick opted not to pit and retook the lead.|$|R
60|$|The {{man took}} a card {{from his pocket}} <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> her with a bow.|$|R
