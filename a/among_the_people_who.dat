5|$|When King George IV died on 26 June 1830 without {{surviving}} legitimate issue, William succeeded him as King William IV. Aged 64, he was {{the oldest}} person yet to assume the British throne. Unlike his extravagant brother, William was unassuming, discouraging pomp and ceremony. In contrast to George IV, who tended {{to spend most of}} his time in Windsor Castle, William was known, especially early in his reign, to walk, unaccompanied, through London or Brighton. Until the Reform Crisis eroded his standing, he was very popular <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>people,</b> <b>who</b> saw him as more approachable and down-to-earth than his brother.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} chapters {{describe in}} detail the places Wallace visited. Wallace includes numerous observations on the people, their languages, ways of living, and social organisation, {{as well as on}} the plants and animals found in each location. He talks about the biogeographic patterns he observes and their implications for natural history, in terms both of the movement of species and of the geologic history of the region. He also narrates some of his personal experiences during his travels. The final chapter is an overview of the ethnic, linguistic, and cultural divisions <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> live in the region and speculation about what such divisions might indicate about their history.|$|E

25|$|The flying man – This man was Ultima’s {{teacher and}} was also known as el hombre volador. He gave her the owl that became her spirit familiar, her guardian, and her soul. He told her to do good works with her powers, but to avoid interfering with a person’s destiny.

25|$|According to Numbers 16-17, a Levite named Korah {{led many}} in {{challenging}} Aaron's exclusive {{claim to the}} priesthood. When the rebels were punished by being {{swallowed up by the}} earth, (Numbers 16:25-35), Eleazar, the son of Aaron, was commissioned to take charge of the censers of the dead priests. And when a plague broke out <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> had sympathized with the rebels, Aaron, at the command of Moses, took his censer and stood between {{the living and the dead}} till the plague abated (Numbers 17:1-15, 16:36-50).|$|E

25|$|The myth of {{the princess}} is the most popular, and it differs from a region to another. In one of the {{versions}} the princess is Ahwang Kongju of the Yao kingdom on the Asian mainland or another kingdom. The princess had a strong connection to the Divine, granting welfare to her people. The king sent the princess <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>people,</b> <b>who</b> began to worship her for her healing powers. The mudang were established as her successors. The princess is worshipped at the ritual of seasonal offerings in Chungcheong. The yellow and red clothes worn by the mudang are regarded as Ahwang Kongju's robes, at the ritual.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, trouble {{broke out}} in Lisbon at the annual celebration of the Feast of Corpus Christi on 16 June. Junot {{permitted}} the festival to take place, but concentrated 15,000 soldiers {{in the city to}} prevent a riot. Nevertheless, as the religious procession made its way through the streets, a panic broke out <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> surged through the lines of soldiers. Just as the artillery was ready to fire on the mob, Junot coolly rode into the crowd and ordered his men to refrain from firing. He managed to clear the streets, calmed the people, and insisted that the procession continue. Though Junot's level-headed action averted a massacre, Lisbon remained rife with wild rumors. On top of this, a British expedition under General Brent Spencer hovered off the coast. Spencer had only 5,000 troops but Junot {{had no way of knowing}} this.|$|E
500|$|Musicians {{from other}} {{countries}} also participated in resistance to apartheid. Several musicians from Europe and North America refused to perform in South Africa during the apartheid regime: these included The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, and the Walker Brothers. After the Sharpeville massacre in 1960, the Musicians' Union in the UK announced a boycott of the government. The first South African activist to receive widespread attention outside South Africa was Steve Biko {{when he died in}} police custody in 1977. His death inspired a number of songs from artists outside the country, including from Tom Paxton and Peter Hamill. The most famous of these was the song [...] "Biko" [...] by Peter Gabriel. U2 lead singer Bono was <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> said that the song {{was the first time he}} had heard about apartheid.|$|E

500|$|Bajpayee's {{shoulder}} got injured while {{filming the}} Telugu film Vedam, and was {{absent from the}} screen for nearly two years. He then returned in a major role with the comedy Jugaad (2009), {{which was based on}} the 2006 Delhi sealing drive incident. His next release was the mystery thriller Acid Factory (2009), which was a remake of the Hollywood film Unknown (2006). He played a comic role of one <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> are kidnapped and locked in a factory with no memory of how they came there. The film did not do well at the box office. The string of financial failures continued with his next release. In Madhur Bhandarkar's Jail (2009), he played the role of a convict serving life imprisonment. He called his role a [...] "narrator" [...] and [...] "mentor" [...] of its protagonist (played by Neil Nitin Mukesh).|$|E
500|$|The two [...] "co-protagonists" [...] of {{the book}} are 5-Liu Hsing and 5-Nova Luis. Both Hsing and Luis have been {{described}} as protagonists typical of Le Guin's works, being somewhat isolated from the society they live in, due to their strong individuality {{and the fact that they}} do not entirely conform to societal expectations. As with other members of their generation, Hsing and Luis grow up in an environment devoid of terrestrial ties, as a result of which they are, as children, unfamiliar with the terms [...] "hill", [...] "sky" [...] and [...] "wind". Despite not having an understanding of a planetary existence, Hsing and Luis are <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> are not convinced by the beliefs of the angels. Instead they question those beliefs, and hold that a reality exists outside of their own human-created bubble, and are drawn to the idea of stimuli other than those created by humans.|$|E
500|$|In June 2006, Massachusetts State Senator Jarrett Barrios gained {{national}} attention when he proposed legislation restricting the serving of Fluffernutter sandwiches in public schools. After Barrios {{learned that his}} son was served Fluffernutters {{on a daily basis}} at his Cambridge, Massachusetts, public elementary school, he created an amendment to a junk food bill that aimed to limit the serving of Fluffernutters in Massachusetts public schools to once a week. The proposal was criticized as an example of trivial and overly intrusive legislation, while Barrios' supporters pointed to concerns over the problem of childhood obesity. <b>Among</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> defended the Fluffernutter at the time was Massachusetts State Representative Kathi-Anne Reinstein, whose district in Revere was close to Lynn, where Marshmallow Fluff is made. She claimed she planned to [...] "fight to the death for Fluff" [...] and supported legislation that would make the Fluffernutter the official state sandwich. The measure failed, and Reinstein tried again unsuccessfully in 2009. Supporters of the bill cited the sandwich's close association with childhood and Massachusetts.|$|E

500|$|Even though {{improvements}} {{were made}} the ground suffered problems when hosting large crowds, due to narrow surrounding streets and {{a shortage of}} turnstiles. A reporter for the Manchester Football News summarised the access problems: [...] "The croft is a nightmare in wet weather, and altogether the approach is easily the worst of any I know". On occasion, further problems occurred inside the ground as well as outside. A 1913 cup tie against Sunderland drew a crowd officially recorded as 41,709, but believed to be significantly higher. An hour before kick-off the gates were closed, with many ticket-holders unable to gain admission. The crowd was so large that once the match kicked off the crowd began to spill onto the pitch, a problem which worsened as the game progressed. Sunderland's Charles Buchan recalled that [...] "Before half-time they were three or four yards inside the touchlines." [...] A Sunderland goal in the 58th minute caused further encroachment, forcing the referee to abandon the match. An FA inquiry into the events on the terraces gave rise to debate {{on the issue of}} crowd control at sporting events. Use of mounted police was a particularly contentious issue, the chairman of the committee asking [...] "If the ball struck a horse, and the creature plunged <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>people,</b> <b>who</b> was to be held responsible for any injuries that might accrue?" ...|$|E
500|$|A {{family of}} cattle ranchers, the Wetherills, befriended {{members of the}} Ute tribe near their ranch {{southwest}} of Mancos, Colorado. [...] With the Ute tribe's approval, the Wetherills were allowed to bring cattle into the lower, warmer plateaus of the present Ute reservation during winter. Word of the Ancestral Puebloan great houses had spread, and Acowitz, {{a member of the}} Ute tribe, told the Wetherills of a special cliff dwelling in Mesa Verde: [...] "Deep in that canyon and near its head are many houses of the old people– the Ancient Ones. [...] One of those houses, high, high in the rocks, is bigger than all the others. [...] Utes never go there, it is a sacred place." [...] On December 18, 1888, Richard Wetherill and cowboy Charlie Mason rediscovered Cliff Palace after spotting the ruins from the top of Mesa Verde. Wetherill gave the ruin its present-day name. Richard Wetherill, family and friends explored the ruins and gathered artifacts, some of which they sold to the Historical Society of Colorado and much of which they kept. <b>Among</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> stayed with the Wetherills and explored the cliff dwellings was mountaineer, photographer, and author Frederick H. Chapin, who visited the region during 1889 and 1890. He described the landscape and ruins in an 1890 article and later in an 1892 book, The Land of the Cliff-Dwellers, which he illustrated with hand-drawn maps and personal photographs.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{generally}} accepted by modern scholars that the Daniel who appears as {{the hero of}} the Book of Daniel never existed, but that the authors reveal their true identity at the end of Daniel 12: they are the maskil, the [...] "wise", of whom Daniel is one: [...] "Those <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> are wise shall make many understand ..." [...] The actual background to the book was the persecution of the Jews by the Greek king Antiochus IV Epiphanes in 167-164 BCE, and there is a broad consensus that the book was completed shortly after that crisis ended.|$|E
2500|$|The Book of Daniel {{was written}} in {{reaction}} to the persecution of the Jews by the Greek king Antiochus IV Epiphanes in 167-164 BCE.
