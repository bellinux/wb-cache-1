2500|$|Blacks enjoyed full {{fellowship}} in {{the church}} — holding priesthood office included — up until 1849 when Brigham Young, the prophet of the church at the time, issued a church-wide ban on blacks being {{able to have the}} priesthood. Young would then make the earliest known statement declaring a black priesthood ban, stating, [...] "The Lord had cursed Cain's seed with blackness and prohibited them the priesthood." [...] This decision may have been brought about by the actions of William McCary, an African American convert to the church who believed he was a prophet and claimed on various occasions to be Jesus and Adam, father of the human race. McCary was also known to perform sealings in his own house and was later excommunicated in 1847. Despite this banning of priesthood rights, many blacks were still able to hold church office and lead congregations. Joseph T. Ball, for example, was the leader of a Boston congregation, and supposedly the first black to do so. Abel himself also enjoyed opportunities for involvement {{in the church}} after this declaration. He completed three missions for the church: one in the 1830s, one in the 1840s, and the last in his local area in 1843. In addition, as the church moved out West, Mormons were exposed to a larger population of blacks and anti-black political attitudes continued to increase. Other influential black members include Black Pete, a member who came to Ohio and later became notorious for claiming to be a revelator. He was later disfellowshipped by Joseph Smith because of his false teachings. One Q. Walker Lewis from Lowell, Massachusetts also found himself <b>a</b> <b>item</b> of scrutiny during this period. Lewis was ordained an elder by William Smith, Joseph Smith Jr.'s younger brother. By 1847, his authority was challenged despite his being well-respected in the church community.|$|E

50|$|Retroactive {{interference}} is {{the psychological}} theory of memory whereby learning something new impedes retrieval of a memory that was previously learned. Briggs studied retroactive interference using {{a test of}} free recall. In his study, participants learned paired associate words (i.e. A1-B1, A2-B2,...Ai-Bi) over multiple trials, until the learning of the Ai-Bi associates were perfected. Following this, participants were given a new list of paired associates, where the second word of the pair was changed while the first word of the associate pair was kept the same (A1-C1, A2-C2,... Ai-Ci). After mastery of this second list of paired associates, Briggs had participants perform a recall procedure. He presented a list <b>A</b> <b>item</b> and the participant was asked to recall whichever pair (the -Bi or -Ci) that came to mind. Based on retroactive interference, learning of A-B paired associates declined due to the learning of the subsequent A-C associates, and as a result, there was {{a higher rate of}} responses from list C by the participants on the recall test.|$|E

5000|$|The Sciascia story unfolds {{with the}} arrival in Sicily of a {{medicine}} rep from Verona. He is a unaware of being witness to a double murder at a rural railway station and hears of the event on the car radio. He calls on the local police station {{to help with the}} enquiries. The police had already discovered the body of a retired ambassador, who had returned after years of absence, to in his remote farmhouse, after calling them to alert them of his discovery of <b>a</b> <b>item</b> (a stolen painting) rolled up in the attic. The police did not call that night as the duty Inspector who left soon after insisted the Brigadiere should tarry as it might be a hoax as he knew the Farmhose to be abandoned. The following day the strange appearance of the retired ambassador's body which appeared to have been a suicide, raises suspicion in the Brigadiere that he may have been murdered. This remains the investigating policeman's opinion but is totally rejected by the Police Commissioner who insists on a simple and uncomplicated suicide. There is a suggestion that the Carabinieri who have also turned up at the crime scene are aware of the alternative theory the Brigadiere had mulled over with the Carabiniere driver and repeated to his superior the Colonel. Meanwhile interrogation of the Veronese witness clarifies that he had not seen the railway staff but their murderers rolling up a [...] "carpet"/ painting in the station. The film follows the investigation as it proceeds with an old friend of the [...] "suicide" [...] a professor Franzo also revealing more on the telephone conversations they had exchanged before the ambassador's death. It looked to the police as though the Farm buildings had been used for criminal activity for some time. The inspector however appeared to be overly familiar with the inside of the Great house and real doubts entered the Brigadiere's mind as to his real involvement in the crime. The Procurator/judge insisted unreasonably the police Commissioner and Carabinieri should give him more and cast iron evidence if he were to proceed with any case, as in his view all he heard were conjectures. The estranged widow and son of the ambassador arrive and the extent of the family rift is evident. They appear to have relied on the local parish priest Don Cricco to oversee the mainly abandoned family properties in the area. The film ends with an accident in which the Inspector and Brigadiere exchange pistol shots, killing the Inspector. The police call it an accident.|$|E
