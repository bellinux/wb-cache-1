25|$|Khan {{is known}} for his {{trademark}} shoot up, but performed poorly in this event. In the Colombo SAF Games, two of his shoot up scores were under ten with a highest of 10.7 where he used to reach 10.8 three to four times. About his poor shoot up performances he said,"I don't quite enjoy it these days. A fear works in my mind. He also thinks the pressure of expectation may be the reason for this <b>and</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> overcome this soon.|$|E
25|$|Persons with narcissistic {{personality}} disorder (NPD) {{are characterized by}} their persistent grandiosity, excessive need for admiration, and a personal disdain for, and lack of empathy for other people. As such, the person with NPD usually displays the behaviors of arrogance, a sense of superiority, and actively seeks to establish abusive power and control over other people. Narcissistic {{personality disorder}} is a condition different from self-confidence (a strong sense of self); people with NPD typically value themselves over other persons {{to the extent that}} they openly disregard the feelings and wishes of others, <b>and</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> be treated as superior, regardless of their actual status or achievements. Moreover, the person with narcissistic personality disorder usually exhibits a fragile ego (Self-concept), an inability to tolerate criticism, and a tendency to belittle others in order to validate their own superiority.|$|E
25|$|Croteam used {{an array}} of {{automated}} and in-place tools to help rapidly design, debug, and test the game for playability. In one aspect, they recognized {{in the development of}} a puzzle game was that while puzzles could be designed with specific solutions, the process of creating the video game around the puzzle could create unsolvable situations or unforeseen shortcuts. To address this, they used a bot, developed by Croteam member Nathan Brown who had previously developed bots for other games including the ones incorporated into ports of Serious Sam 3 for consoles. The bot, named Bot, would watch the playthrough of a puzzle by a human player in terms of broad actions such as placing boxes on a switch for the completion of a puzzle. Then, as the puzzle's environment was tuned and decorated, they would have Bot attempt to solve the puzzle, testing to make sure it did not run into any dead-ends. If it did encounter any, Bot reported these through an in-house bug reporting system and then used game cheats to move on and finish out testing, which took between 30 and 60 minutes for the full game. As such, they were able to quickly iterate and resolve such problems when new features were introduced to the game. Overall, Croteam estimates they logged about 15,000 hours with Bot before the release of the public test version, <b>and</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> use similar techniques in future games. They also used human playtesters to validate other more aesthetic factors of the games prior to the title's release.|$|E

500|$|Gainey {{explained}} the changing {{fortunes of the}} franchise following their playoff defeat {{at the hands of}} the Nordiques in 1982: [...] "We can't put on our sweaters anymore <b>and</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> win." [...] The Canadiens' mystique had been broken by consecutive playoff losses to the upstart Minnesota North Stars, the Oilers and the Nordiques. The loss to Quebec in 1982 was the culmination of a vicious series where the players attempted to hurt and intimidate their opponents, while the media argued over which team better represented francophone Quebec. Montreal's growing rivalry with Quebec peaked two years later in 1984 when they eliminated the Nordiques in six games, but not before the Good Friday Massacre made headlines. A hit by Quebec's Dale Hunter on Montreal goaltender Steve Penney sparked a bench-clearing brawl at the end of the second period. A second brawl, including some players who were ejected as a result of the first, erupted before the start of the third period. Ten players were ejected from the game, and 198 penalties in minutes were handed out as a result of the incidents, which proved a turning point in the game as Montreal scored five third period goals to win.|$|E
500|$|Tripp {{attempts}} to describe homosexuality, {{the social context}} in which it occurs, and its biological and sociological implications. He acknowledges a debt to previous researchers, including the ethologist Frank A. Beach, the psychologist John Money, the biologist Alfred Kinsey, the sexologists Wardell Pomeroy and Clyde Martin, the anthropologist Paul Gebhard, and the psychologist George Weinberg. Based on his review {{of the history of}} sexual laws and customs, he concludes that homosexuality has been called an [...] "aberration" [...] or [...] "perversion" [...] due to moral assumptions rooted partly in religious beliefs. Exploring the question of a possible biological basis to homosexuality, Tripp focuses on the issue of hormones. He argues that the existing evidence is too inconsistent to show any connection between male homosexuality and hormone levels, with studies showing homosexual men as having hormone levels sometimes lower and sometimes higher than those of heterosexual men. Tripp maintains that future {{attempts to}} establish a connection will inevitably fail, due to their false underlying assumptions. Based on studies suggesting that sexual patterns depend on learning in primates and other animals, Tripp argues that human sexual orientation also depends on learning. He argues that a majority of people are heterosexual because their upbringing has made them want <b>and</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> be heterosexual, and that while early favorable heterosexual experiences help reinforce heterosexuality, there is an uneven correlation between early sexual experience and adult sexual orientation. Tripp considers the context in which such experiences occurred to be crucial, writing that emotion or a sense of drama is needed to give them significance.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the case}} of an attack by a {{high-speed}} force, the attackers could pick the time and place of the attack, <b>and</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> encounter only the aircraft already in the air along that route. Thus they could outnumber the defenders in any given area. To ensure there were a reasonable number of fighters along any approach route, huge numbers of aircraft would need to be in the air at all times covering all the routes. Even more aircraft would be needed to handle issues like refuelling, re-arming, and repair. Likewise, a huge number of pilots would be needed to crew the aircraft, as each pilot could only be expected to fly so long per day. Such a system was essentially impossible, {{and was one of the}} reasons it was widely believed that [...] "the bomber will always get through".|$|E
2500|$|Rostron {{ordered the}} ship's heating and hot water cut off {{in order to}} make as much steam as {{possible}} available for the engines, and had extra lookouts on watch to spot ice. Cottam, meanwhile, messaged the Titanic that Carpathia was [...] "coming as quickly as possible <b>and</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> be there within four hours." [...] Cottam refrained from sending more signals after this, trying to keep the air clear for Titanic's distress signals. Carpathia reached the edge of the ice field by 2:45a.m., and for the next two hours dodged icebergs as small growlers of ice ground along the hull plates.. The Carpathia arrived at the distress position at 4:00a.m., approximately {{an hour and a half}} after the Titanic went down, claiming more than 1,500 lives. For the next four and a half hours, the ship took on the 705 survivors of the disaster from Titanics 20 lifeboats. Survivors were given blankets and coffee, and then escorted by stewards to the dining rooms. [...] Others went on deck to survey the ocean for any sign of their loved ones. [...] Throughout the rescue, Carpathia's own passengers assisted in anyway that they could. [...] By 9:00, the last survivor had been picked up, and Rostron gave the order to get underway.|$|E
