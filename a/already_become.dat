5|$|Because {{almost all}} {{other species of}} amphidromine gastropods, such as ones within the genera Partula and Achatinella, have <b>already</b> <b>become</b> extinct, the genus Amphidromus, {{containing}} over 110 species, is uniquely useful {{for the study of}} the evolution of asymmetry in animals, and this is why the conservation of this genus is of essential importance to biologists.|$|E
5|$|Coolsma {{returned}} to the Netherlands {{with his wife in}} 1876 and became the leader of the NZV, holding the office until 1908. He disputed the idea that missionary work should be focused on the non-Islamicised eastern portion of the colony. He believed instead that missionary work should be prioritsed in the western portion, where Islam had <b>already</b> <b>become</b> entrenched.|$|E
5|$|It was at {{this point}} that the Non-Intervention Committee was created to uphold the agreement, but the double-dealing of the USSR and Germany had <b>already</b> <b>become</b> apparent. It also removed the need for a {{declaration}} of neutrality (which would have granted the Nationalists and Republicans control over neutrals in the areas they controlled), and had little legal standing. In Britain, part of the reasoning was based on an exaggerated belief in Germany's and Italy's preparedness for war.|$|E

5|$|Malvern had <b>already</b> <b>become</b> an {{overspill}} for {{the nearby}} city of Worcester, {{and the new}} motorways constructed in the early 1960s brought the industrial Midlands within commuting distance by car. With this development came the construction of large private housing developments. The town continues to swell as increasingly more farmland, especially in the Malvern Link area between the villages of Guarlford and Newland, is turned over to housing projects creating new communities and suburbs.|$|E
5|$|The {{change to}} Best in Show was {{considered}} by the press to be of little significance and was not promoted by Charles Cruft, and did not require a dog to have won its Best of Breed class until 1936. It did however remove restrictions on entry, which remained until the mid-1960s when entry to Crufts was restricted to dogs who had <b>already</b> <b>become</b> a champion by gaining championship points at other dog shows.|$|E
5|$|Chikhachov {{instructed}} Andrey Toropov of the Nikolaev Shipyard {{to draft}} two proposals, one armed with 10-inch {{and the other}} with 12-inch guns. Toropov estimated that the ship should have displaced at least 8,880 tons. Chikhachov admitted the fact and presented the two options to the NTC. The admiral himself and the active fleet commanders voted for the 12-inch caliber, which had <b>already</b> <b>become</b> a worldwide battleship standard, but the NTC strongly advised against it. The Navy brass spent April and May 1893 in lengthy debates. They agreed to increase displacement to 8,880 tons and were leaning toward accepting 12-inch guns when General Admiral Grand Duke Alexey resolved the discussion in favor of the smaller caliber.|$|E

5|$|From {{the early}} 20th century {{to at least}} the mid-1980s, {{educational}} policies in Mexico focused on the hispanicization (castellanización) of indigenous communities, teaching only Spanish and discouraging the use of indigenous languages. As a result, today there is no group of Nahuatl speakers having attained general literacy in Nahuatl; while their literacy rate in Spanish also remains {{much lower than the}} national average. Even so, Nahuatl is still spoken by well over a million people, of whom around 10% are monolingual. The survival of Nahuatl as a whole is not imminently endangered, but the survival of certain dialects is, and some dialects have <b>already</b> <b>become</b> extinct within the last few decades of the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|From {{the sixth}} century, Scotland {{experienced}} {{a process of}} Christianisation, traditionally seen as carried out by Irish-Scots missionaries, including St Ninian, St Kentigern and St Columba {{and to a lesser}} extent those from Rome and England. However, Gilbert Markus highlights the fact that most of these figures were not church-founders, but were usually were active in areas where Christianity had <b>already</b> <b>become</b> established, probably through gradual diffusion that is almost invisible in the historical record. This would have included trade, conquest and intermarriage.|$|E
5|$|Jamie Vardy {{broke the}} Premier League record for scoring 11 goals in 11 {{consecutive}} league games, in the 2015–16 Premier League season. Vardy {{is also the}} ninth player to score 20 top-flight goals in a season, following Arthur Chandler, Ernie Hine, Arthur Rowley, Jimmy Walsh, Ken Keyworth, Jackie Sinclair, Frank Worthington and Gary Lineker. Vardy's goal at Sunderland on 10 April 2016 saw him become the first player since Gary Lineker in 1984–85 to score 20 top flight goals for the club, having <b>already</b> <b>become</b> Leicester's highest Premier League scorer in a single season.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{findings}} suggest that Finnish trade connections <b>already</b> <b>became</b> more active during the 8th century bringing an influx of silver onto Finnish markets.

5|$|Other notable {{examples}} include Kenyan runner Bernard Lagat, {{who became a}} United States citizen in May 2004. The Kenyan constitution requires that one renounce their Kenyan citizenship when they become a citizen of another nation. Lagat competed for Kenya in the 2004 Athens Olympics {{even though he had}} <b>already</b> <b>become</b> a United States citizen. According to Kenya, he was no longer a Kenyan citizen, jeopardising his silver medal. Lagat said he started the citizenship process in late 2003 and did not expect to become an American citizen until after the Athens games.|$|E
5|$|Puerto Escondido {{proved to}} be a rich {{collecting}} ground, and after nine days in the Gulf, they had to scale back their collecting ambitions owing to lack of space for the specimens. It had <b>already</b> <b>become</b> clear that there were certain species that were ubiquitous in the region: some species of crabs, sea anemones, limpets, barnacles and sea cucumbers were found at every stop, and the sun star, Heliaster kubiniji, the sea urchin, Arbacia incisa, and bristleworms of the Eurythoe genus were common.|$|E
5|$|Detractors of {{the flag}} movement, {{including}} Motilal Nehru, soon hailed the Swaraj flag {{as a symbol of}} national unity. Thus, the flag became a significant structural component of the institution of India. In contrast to the subdued responses of the past, the British Indian government took greater cognisance of the new flag, and began to define a policy of response. The British parliament discussed public use {{of the flag}}, and based on directives from England, the British Indian government threatened to withdraw funds from municipalities and local governments that did not prevent the display of the Swaraj flag. The Swaraj flag became the official flag of Congress at the 1931 meeting. However, by then, the flag had <b>already</b> <b>become</b> the symbol of the independence movement.|$|E

50|$|The lesser Saône has a {{tendency}} to flood (sometimes influenced by snow), with a very strong oceanic effect. The soils are not susceptible to much infiltration, so that they saturate quickly which contributes to surface runoff. The flow rate grows very quickly, and after receiving the waters of the Lanterne, the Saône <b>already</b> <b>becomes</b> a powerful river.|$|R
5|$|During {{the initial}} {{examination}} of the fossil on March 6, 1999 it had <b>already</b> <b>become</b> clear to Currie that {{the left and right}} feet mirrored each other perfectly and that the fossil had been completed by using both slab and counterslab. He also noticed no connection could be seen between the tail and the body. In July 1999, Currie and the Czerkases brought the fossil to the High-Resolution X-ray CT Facility of the University of Texas (Austin) founded and operated by Dr. Timothy Rowe to make CT scans. Rowe, having made the scans on July 29, determined that they indicated that the bottom fragments, showing the tail and the lower legs, were not part of the larger fossil. He informed the Czerkases on August 2 that there was a chance of the whole being a fraud. During a subsequent discussion Rowe and Currie were pressured by the Czerkases to keep their reservations private.|$|E
5|$|In 1957 Van der Byl {{was made}} a Director of the United Dominions Corporation (Rhodesia) Ltd, having <b>already</b> <b>become</b> {{an active member of}} the Rhodesia Tobacco Association.

His first involvement in government was in 1960 when the Rhodesia Tobacco Association made him one of their representatives on the National Native Labour Commission, on which he served for two years. In 1961, he also represented the Rhodesia Tobacco Association on the council of the Rhodesian National Farmers Union. He was recognised as a leading spokesman for Rhodesian tobacco farmers.|$|E
5|$|In {{a process}} known as the Marian reforms, Roman consul Gaius Marius carried out a {{programme}} of reform of the Roman military. In 107 BC, all citizens, regardless of their wealth or social class, were made eligible for entry into the Roman army. This move formalised and concluded a gradual process that had been growing for centuries, of removing property requirements for military service. The distinction among the three heavy infantry classes, which had <b>already</b> <b>become</b> blurred, had collapsed into a single class of heavy legionary infantry. The heavy infantry legionaries were drawn from citizen stock, while non-citizens came to dominate the ranks of the light infantry. The army's higher-level officers and commanders were still drawn exclusively from the Roman aristocracy.|$|E

As Albert was working at the British Embassy in Paris as a sous chef, Michel joined him there as the pastry chef for the Embassy. He moved on from there to become a chef in Philippe de Rothschild's service, while Albert moved to England to work there. Between 1960 and 1962, Michel served his French National Service. He was first stationed at the Palace of Versailles, but was later posted overseas in Béchar, Algeria.

5|$|The Nisshōki flag is {{designated}} as the national flag in the Law Regarding the National Flag and National Anthem, which was promulgated and became effective on August 13, 1999. Although no earlier legislation had specified a national flag, the sun-disc flag had <b>already</b> <b>become</b> the de facto national flag of Japan. Two proclamations issued in 1870 by the Daijō-kan, the governmental body of the early Meiji period, each had a provision for a design of the national flag. A sun-disc flag was adopted as the national flag for merchant ships under Proclamation No. 57 of Meiji 3 (issued on February 27, 1870), and as the national flag used by the Navy under Proclamation No. 651 of Meiji 3 (issued on October 27, 1870).
