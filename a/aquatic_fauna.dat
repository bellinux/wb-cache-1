The trout (Salmonidae) will feed at the surface on these and water boatmen (Corixidae), and below the surface on the caddisfly (Trichoptera) larvae and pupae; they will also take the adult caddisflies when they emerge. Other <b>aquatic</b> <b>fauna</b> including daphnia and snails are {{also found in the}} lake. Large populations of dragonflies, including migrant hawker (Aeshna mixta) and significant numbers of ruddy darter (Sympetrum sanguineum), occur at the lake. Eleven species of wainscot moth make their home in the reed beds, including the nationally local brown-veined wainscot (Archanara dissoluta), twin-spotted wainscot (Archanara geminipuncta) and silky wainscot (Chilodes maritimus).|$|E
5|$|Little {{progress}} was made, but in 2005 the Environment Agency and the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust promoted {{the formation of}} the Itchen Navigation Trust. They were committed to conserving the remains, rather than a full restoration to navigable standards. A request was made to the Heritage Lottery Fund in the United Kingdom for funds to restore the watercourse. Known as The Itchen Navigation Heritage Trail Project, funding was granted and a five-year restoration project began. Work has included widening the aperture at College Mead Lock and the construction of a bypass channel around Malm Lock to assist the movement of fish and other <b>aquatic</b> <b>fauna.</b> The navigation has been designated a European Special Area of Conservation as well as a Site of Special Scientific Interest, due to the rich diversity of wildlife found along the system, and its historical importance.|$|E

25|$|The Chao Phraya basin is home {{to around}} 280 species of fish, {{including}} about 30 endemics. By far the most diverse family is Cyprinidae with 108 species. The mainstream of the Chao Phraya River has about 190 native fish species. In general, the <b>aquatic</b> <b>fauna</b> of Chao Phraya and Mae Klong show clear similarities, and they are sometimes combined in a single ecoregion with 328 fish species. Despite their similarities, there are also differences between the <b>aquatic</b> <b>fauna</b> of Chao Phraya and Mae Klong; the latter (but not the former) {{is home to}} a few taxa otherwise only known in major Burmese rivers: the Irrawaddy, Salween, and Tenasserim. The <b>aquatic</b> <b>fauna</b> in Chao Phraya–Mae Klong also show clear similarities with that of the middle Mekong (the lower Mekong fauna more closely resembles that of the eastern Malay Peninsula). It is believed that the upper Mekong was connected to Chao Phraya (rather than present-day lower Mekong) until the Quaternary, which explains the similarities in their river faunas. This included the Nan River basin, a tributary of the Chao Phraya, which {{is home to a}} number of taxa (for example, Ambastaia nigrolineata and Sectoria) otherwise only known from Mekong. Of the fish species known from the Chao Phraya–Mae Klong, only about 50 are absent from the Mekong.|$|E

40|$|Abstract {{approved}} (Major professor) A {{population of}} juvenile steelhead trout (Salmo gairdneri) reared {{in a completely}} controlled freshwater impoundment situated in mid-western Oregon was studied from June of 1962 until March of 1963. The limnological characteristics of the environment {{as well as the}} dynamics of the <b>aquatic</b> insect <b>fauna</b> were surveyed in detail. Instan-taneous growth and mortality rates, net production and biomass changes were computed for the fish population at semimonthly inter-vals. The total yield could be obtained by complete draining of the pond. A study of stomach contents of the trout established qualitative and quantitative relationships between the fish and their food supply. The partitioning of the total food ingested between maintenance and growth was estimated and efficiencies of food utilization calculated.

25|$|The {{construction}} of sluice gates {{at the northern}} part of Thale Luang in 1956 ceased the flow of saline water into Thale Noi lake, creating a freshwater biome that had significant impacts on the ecosystem. Reducing or eliminating connectivity between the larger lake system and Thale Noi lake affected the feeding and breeding cycles of fish and other <b>aquatic</b> <b>fauna</b> which consequently impacted the entire food web. Reports of increased weed infestation has also been documented as a result of limited salt-water intrusions that previously reduced populations.|$|E
25|$|In the Middle Coosa River Watershed, 281 {{occurrences of}} rare {{plant and animal}} species and natural {{communities}} have been documented, including 73 occurrences of 23 species that are federal or state protected. Ten conservation targets were chosen: the riverine system, matrix forest communities (oak hickory-pine forest), gray bat (Myotis grisescens), riparian vegetation, mountain longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) forest communities, red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis), critically imperiled aquatic species (fish, mussels, and snails), southern hognose snake (Heterodon simus), caddisflies, and imperiled plants. Maintaining the biodiversity of the Coosa River system is particularly important because it has already lost a significant portion of its <b>aquatic</b> <b>fauna</b> to extinction.|$|E
25|$|The {{extent by}} which Searsville Reservoir {{serves as a}} source for {{non-native}} species was illustrated when Stanford biologists studied the <b>aquatic</b> <b>fauna</b> found in the plunge pool below the Searsville dam spillway. The plunge pool was drained in 2013 to allow for a safety inspection of the base of the dam. Native species found when the plunge pool was pumped dry include two steelhead trout, 26 California roach and 22 Sacramento suckers. In contrast, more than 1,500 non-native fishes were encountered during the dewatering process, including over 500 sunfish including green sunfish ((Lepomis cyanellus), bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) and likely redear sunfish (Lepomis microlophus), two bullhead catfish (Ameiurus species) and over 1,000 mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis). Other non-native in the plunge pool included 500 bullfrogs and 150 Louisiana red swamp crayfish.|$|E

25|$|The {{remains of}} S. imperator {{were found in}} a region of the Ténéré Desert named Gadoufaoua, more {{specifically}} in the Elrhaz Formation of the Tegama Group, dating from the late Aptian to the early Albian of the Early Cretaceous, approximately 112 million years ago. The stratigraphy {{of the region and}} the <b>aquatic</b> <b>fauna</b> that was found therein indicates that it was an inland fluvial environment, entirely freshwater in nature with a humid tropical climate. S. imperator shared the waters with the holostean fish Lepidotus and the coelacanth Mawsonia. The dinosaur fauna was represented by the iguanodontian Lurdusaurus, which was the most common dinosaur in the region, and its relative Ouranosaurus; there were also two sauropods, Nigersaurus and a currently unnamed sauropod while the theropod fauna included the spinosaurid Suchomimus, the carcharodontosaurid Eocarcharia and the abelisaurid Kryptops.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{topographical}} settings, {{the environment}} of the Lake George site was extremely favorable for occupation. In prehistoric times the rich soils and the varying ecologies supported a vast array of plant and animal species. The natural levees created by deposits from the Mississippi were made of rich sandy and silty loams which allowed the common Southeastern deciduous hardwoods, such as hickory, elm, ash, cottonwood, maple, pecan, hackberry, honey locust, sycamore, and even gums and oaks to flourish. The swamps surrounding the site supported an entirely different ecosystem including alligators, small reptiles and aquatic plants. The streams and rivers also provided fish, shellfish, and other <b>aquatic</b> <b>fauna,</b> which can be seen from excavations of shell middens and deposits of the site. These waterways also provided a major form of communication. This abundant region was obviously utilized by many different peoples over the course of prehistory as the Holly Bluff Site shows.|$|E

40|$|At {{municipal}} level, {{the ecological}} health of {{rivers and streams}} is currently not well documented. Information on ecosystem health is crucial in order to set ecologically sound management objectives for a municipality’s aquatic resources. In this study, a three-tiered environmental water quality approach, using water quality-, biological assessment- and toxicological data, was used to provide a first-order level of assessment into the ecological status of the streams and rivers within the Northern Service Delivery Region (NSDR) of the Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality (EMM). The NSDR is situated across five water catchments, of which the Hennops- and Blesbokspruit catchments are the largest. Chemical, bacteriological and physical {{data were collected from}} 17 sampling sites. These results were incorporated into a Water Quality Index. The diversity of the <b>aquatic</b> macro-invertebrate <b>fauna</b> as well as the ability of the aquatic habitats to support such a diverse fauna was measured through the use of the SASS 5 and IHAS indexes.

40|$|Background: Aquatic {{insects are}} the major groups of {{arthropods}} that spend some parts of their life cycle in the water. These insects {{play an important role}} for transmission of some human and animal diseases. There is few information about the <b>aquatic</b> insects <b>fauna</b> of Iran. Methods: To study the <b>aquatic</b> insects <b>fauna,</b> adult, nymphal and larval collections were carried out from different habitats using the standard technique in Zayandeh Roud River, Isfahan Province,central Iran, during summer 2011. Results: In total, 741 speimens of aquatic insects were collected and morphologically identified. They include 7 families and 12 genera representing 2 Orders. The order of Diptera (92. 31 %) and Coleoptera (7. 69 %). The families Culicidae, Syrphidae and Chironomidae from Diptera order, Gyrinidae, Dytiscidae, Haliplidae, Hydrophilidae from Coleoptera order were identified. Conclusion: Some aquatic insects play an important role for transmission of human and animal diseases. These insects also are important for biological control. Therefore ecological study on aquatic insects can provide information about ecology of insects in an area for any decision making...|$|R
500|$|The {{changes in}} {{vegetation}} that result when feral horses overpopulate a region affects bird species by removing plants upon which they feed, {{as well as}} altering the habitat of the birds and their prey. [...] Feral horse grazing is also linked {{to a decline in}} reptiles and amphibians due to habitat loss. In addition, the grazing and trampling near waterways influences <b>aquatic</b> <b>fauna.</b> [...] In areas frequented by horses, crab densities are higher, increasing the propensity for predation on fish. [...] As a result, fish densities decline as the removal of vegetation renders them more susceptible to predation.|$|E
2500|$|In general, the <b>aquatic</b> <b>fauna</b> {{population}} is healthy, but of low diversity, possibly {{due to the}} atoll's isolation. Researchers have not seen any marine turtles, but Polynesian custom regarding harvesting assumed their presence. Examples of the giant clam family Tridacnidae are very abundant, except for the largest giant clam T. gigas. Smaller bivalves were present, but few Mollusks. The reef fish are primarily emperor breams, parrotfish, and red snappers. Also present are moray eel and grey reef shark. Approximately 100 stony coral species and two soft coral species are present.|$|E
2500|$|Additional risks {{posed by}} {{increased}} availability of inorganic nitrogen in aquatic ecosystems include water acidification; eutrophication of fresh and saltwater systems; and toxicity issues for animals, including humans. Eutrophication {{often leads to}} lower dissolved oxygen levels in the water column, including hypoxic and anoxic conditions, which can cause death of <b>aquatic</b> <b>fauna.</b> Relatively sessile benthos, or bottom-dwelling creatures, are particularly vulnerable because of their lack of mobility, though large fish kills are not uncommon.
