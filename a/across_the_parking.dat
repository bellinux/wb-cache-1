25|$|For the 12 seasons (1984–96) {{prior to}} the Phantoms' founding, the National Hockey League (NHL)'s Philadelphia Flyers had {{maintained}} a highly-successful affiliation with the AHL's oldest franchise, the Hershey Bears, which included a Calder Cup title in 1988. In September 1996, however, the Flyers left their long-time home arena, the Spectrum, and moved <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> lot into the soon-to-be-completed CoreStates Center. Instead of demolishing the Spectrum, Comcast Spectacor, the owner of both arenas {{as well as the}} Flyers, elected to keep it open and active, but doing so would require a tenant to fill the 80 to 100 NHL and National Basketball Association (NBA) dates the Spectrum would lose to the CoreStates Center.|$|E
25|$|The Golden Gaters' inaugural {{match was}} a 35–26 victory at home over the Denver Racquets on May 8, 1974. Hunt split her {{two sets of}} women's singles but won 10 games and lost 7 against her opponents. Emerson won both of his men's singles sets over Andrew Pattison, 7–5 and 6–2. Kloss and McMillan played both mixed doubles set for the Golden Gaters and split them winning 12 games and losing 12. The Golden Gaters drew 4,012 fans for their opener at the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum Arena. <b>Across</b> <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> lot, the {{defending}} two-time World Champion Oakland Athletics were playing the Baltimore Orioles at the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum and drew only 2,980 fans in head-to-head competition with the Golden Gaters {{for the attention of}} sports fans.|$|E

2500|$|The Phantoms' 2005 playoff run began {{against the}} Norfolk Admirals, {{a team that}} had {{defeated}} Philadelphia in six of their ten regular-season meetings including the last {{game of the season}} played at the Spectrum on April 17. Philadelphia took the first round set in six games with a 4–2 victory at the Wachovia Center located <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> lot from the Spectrum. (With the circus in the Spectrum for two weeks as the playoffs began and no conflicting Flyers' post-season dates at the Center because of the lockout, the AHL club would end up playing all 13 of its home Calder Cup games in the much larger NHL building.) ...|$|E
2500|$|In the Eastern Conference Finals, Carolina met the heavily-favored Toronto Maple Leafs. In Game 6 in Toronto, the Leafs' Mats Sundin {{tied the}} game with 22 seconds {{remaining}} {{to send it to}} overtime, where Carolina's Martin Gelinas would score to send the franchise to their first Stanley Cup Finals appearance. During this series, several Hurricanes fan traditions drew hockey-wide media attention for the first time: fans met the team at the airport on the return from every road trip, and echoed football-season habits honed for games <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> lot by hosting massive tailgate parties before each home game, a relative novelty in the cold-weather-centric NHL. Inside the building, the CBC's Don Cherry lauded the RBC Center as [...] "the loudest building in the NHL", praise that would be echoed in 2006.|$|E
