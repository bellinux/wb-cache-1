5|$|In 1995, Gretzky {{sold the}} card to Wal-Mart and Treat Entertainment for $500,000. The two {{companies}} {{intended to use}} the card as the grand prize in a promotional contest. The card was sent all across the United States, as part of Wal-Mart's plan to rejuvenate the baseball card market. On February 24 of the following year, the 122nd anniversary of Wagner's birthday, the grand prize drawing for the card was held on CNN's Larry King Weekend. At around 9:00 P.M., Hall of Fame third baseman Brooks Robinson, one of King's guests on the show, pulled out {{the name of one}} Patricia Gibbs, a postal worker living in Hollywood, Florida. After spending hours unsuccessfully trying to contact Gibbs, King's staff finally got through to her phone, and informed Gibbs of her prize. Treat Entertainment and Wal-Mart gave the card to Gibbs a few weeks later at <b>a</b> <b>Wal-Mart</b> store in Miramar, Florida. Gibbs could not afford the taxes on the card, so she decided to consign the card to an auction later on. She consigned the card to Christie's, a New York-based auction house better known for selling famous artworks.|$|E

25|$|On August 23, Atta's driver license was revoked in {{absentia}} after {{he failed to}} show up in traffic court to answer the earlier citation for driving without a license. On the same day, Israeli Mossad reportedly gave his name to the CIA as part of a list of 19 names they said were planning an attack in the near future. Only four of the names are known for certain, the others being Marwan al-Shehhi, Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi.

25|$|On March 20, 2003, it was {{announced}} that Melody Mountain would be developed. Overlooking the city to the west, it is bounded by 6th Street, US 23, and a CSX spur. Initial plans were to include <b>a</b> <b>Wal-Mart,</b> Home Depot, O'Charley's, Fire Mountain and Outback Steakhouse, although Fire Mountain and Home Depot later dropped out of the project; Chick-Fil-A was later added to the project. The $30 million Melody Mountain project was destined to be completed in 2005, however, Phase I opened in early 2006. It was financed partially by $3 million in bonds issued by the city.|$|E
25|$|Along State Highway 351 {{outside of}} I-20 {{and along the}} interstate to the west, the {{northeast}} region of Abilene technically started development in the mid-1980s when the Heritage Parks subdivision first broke ground. However, {{after the turn of}} the 21st century, construction accelerated rapidly for the area to become the second strongest area of development in the city. Since 2005, the Heritage Parks subdivision has expanded; a new community and apartment complex have begun; <b>a</b> <b>Wal-Mart</b> has been attracted to the area, enticing more commercial growth, and a new master-planned commercial district has been created by a major developer, Kenneth Musgrave, who owned, and still owns, much of the land in the area along SH 351.|$|E
25|$|In Canada, the UFCW {{managed to}} win union {{recognition}} at two Wal-Mart stores in Quebec {{and one in}} Saskatchewan. Wal-Mart closed the Jonquière store and workers in Saint-Hyacinthe voted to decertify UFCW in 2011. The union has also applied for recognition at a dozen other Wal-Marts and had won a contract with <b>a</b> <b>Wal-Mart</b> store in Gatineau, Quebec, Canada. After a couple years of unsuccessful negotiations between the union and Wal-Mart the workers at the store {{decided to leave the}} union. The last remaining unionized Wal-Mart in North America was located in Weyburn, Saskatchewan. Wal-Mart successfully repelled an attempted UFCW unionization campaign here in August 2013 when the Supreme Court of Canada dismissed the union's attempt to compel Wal-mart to reach a collective agreement with it; workers at the Weyburn store then voted 51 to 5 to decertify the union.|$|E

25|$|Like in Greece, the Irondequoit {{portion of}} Ridge Road {{is lined with}} {{businesses}} ranging from big-box stores to small establishments. The road's status as an anchor for the town's economy {{is supported by the}} presence of <b>a</b> <b>Wal-Mart</b> supercenter on Hudson Avenue between NY104 and East Ridge Road and the Medley Centre, formerly the Irondequoit Mall, located on East Ridge Road between North Goodman Street and Culver Road. Past Culver Road, the look along the four-lane East Ridge Road changes slightly as it gains a median while the surrounding neighborhood begins to shift from commercial to residential—a change ushered in by the presence of Eastridge High School. The divided highway, as well as CR241, come to an end at NY590 exit11, the northernmost exit on the expressway. The exit is unorthodox in that the exit is bordered on both sides by NY104, which is forced to parallel NY590 for a short distance due to the composition of the area.|$|E

500|$|On September 15, 2009, 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment {{released}} X-Men Origins: Wolverine on DVD and Blu-ray disc.

The single-disc DVD release has the origins featurette and anti-smoking PSA.|$|E
500|$|The {{voice of}} a guest at the tanning-party which Stewie is hosting was {{provided}} by Mike Barker. David A. Goodman comments on the DVD commentary that [...] "It's nice to hear Mike Barker back on Family Guy.," [...] as Barker had performed multiple voices of characters in previous episodes. Peter asking [...] "I'm going to prison, aren't I?" [...] when hiding in the tree after beating up Chris's bully caused {{a little bit of}} trouble for the show, though it was never edited when aired on TV. A sketch had been created showing Brian falling asleep when watching Late Night with Bib Fortuna while Stewie was still in the tanning booth, but it did not seem good enough to air, so it was never broadcast. When Stewie is being sprayed by Brian with sun-screen, Ralph Furley enters the room and mistakenly thinks he sees Brian ejaculating on Stewie. The cream was originally intended to keep squirting out of the bottle as if Brian were continuing to ejaculate despite Mr. Furley's presence, but the animation didn't look right and was removed. MacFarlane comments that he was amazed that broadcasting standards allowed them to get away with the scene, even though Brian's line, [...] "This isn't what it looks like" [...] was edited to keep the ejaculation illusion from being blatant (the TV version goes from Mr. Furley yelling, [...] "Brian" [...] and Brian reacting to Mr. Furley running out and saying, [...] "Never mind, I'll come back later!"). A deleted scene was made and designed to happen directly after Peter sickens Meg by farting in her face in which Peter steals Chris's lunch money and runs for the bus. The gag showing Dick Cheney as <b>a</b> <b>Wal-Mart</b> greeter had Cheney's greeting, [...] "Go fuck yourself" [...] bleeped out on TV, but not DVD. Peter falling to the floor after being pushed away from hitting Randy by Chris was very difficult to do, as it is difficult to do slow-motion in animation. The DVD version includes an extra scene in the car, in which Peter shows Chris how he looks like an anus by wearing a hoodie, pulling the hood on the drawstring tight around his mouth, and pushing a chocolate candy bar out of the hole to simulate defecation.|$|E

40|$|The {{changing}} nature of <b>Wal-Mart</b> from <b>a</b> traditional dry goods retailer into an integrated, global supply chain and Wal-Mart's expansion into urban markets necessitate new architectural and urban strategies.

2500|$|In December 2011 Wal-Mart {{recalled}} {{a quantity of}} infant formula after a baby died in Missouri.

The baby formula was purchased from <b>a</b> <b>Wal-Mart</b> in Lebanon, Missouri. After the purchase, a 10-day-old infant died from a rare bacterial infection, CNN affiliate KYTV reported.
