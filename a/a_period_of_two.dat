Some, such as Panggilan Darah, enjoyed international release; {{the film was}} screened in Singapore (then part of the Straits Settlements) by September 1941. The company's productions were targeted at low-income audiences and extensively used kroncong music, for the recording of which the company established the Oriental Novelty Five. Though its films were screened at least into the 1950s, Oriental's output may be lost.|$|E
5|$|Leigh's family {{opposed the}} fictionalisation of her murder, though {{protests against the}} film were {{abandoned}} after it received financial backing from the New South Wales Film and Television Office. Blackrock was filmed over <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> weeks at locations including Stockton, where Leigh was murdered, a decision that was opposed by local residents who said that memories of the murder were still fresh. While the film was never marketed as being {{based on a true}} story, numerous comparisons between the murder and the film were made, and many viewers believed it to be a factual account of the murder.|$|E

Wellek and Warren began dividing their responsibilities, at first evenly, but with more work done by Wellek as Warren dealt with the illness, and later loss, of his wife Eleanor in 1946. During this period of writing Wellek transferred to Yale University (1946) and Warren to the University of Michigan (1948), but collaboration continued.|$|E

5|$|The first {{computer-controlled}} {{search for}} supernovae was {{begun in the}} 1960s at Northwestern University.

By this means, they discovered 14 supernovae over <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> years.|$|E
5|$|The planetarium {{remained}} at normal levels of service during this renovation period, but attendance dropped significantly, {{particularly when the}} adjacent museum was closed for <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> years during the most intensive phase of its second major expansion. In all, the construction phase lasted for four years, from 1978 to 1982. In particular, some school groups that could justify the expense of seeing the museum and a planetarium show in a single day's outing had difficulty justifying a visit solely to the planetarium.|$|E
5|$|A {{few other}} non-essential heavy metals {{have one or}} more toxic forms. Kidney failure and {{fatalities}} have been recorded arising from the ingestion of germanium dietary supplements (~15 to 300g in total consumed over <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> months to three years). Exposure to osmium tetroxide (OsO4) may cause permanent eye damage {{and can lead to}} respiratory failure and death. Indium salts are toxic if more than few milligrams are ingested and will affect the kidneys, liver, and heart. Cisplatin (PtCl2(NH3)2), which is an important drug used to kill cancer cells, is also a kidney and nerve poison. Bismuth compounds can cause liver damage if taken in excess; insoluble uranium compounds, as well as the dangerous radiation they emit, can cause permanent kidney damage.|$|E

5|$|In 1223, King HenryIII {{met with}} the Welsh prince Llywelyn ab Iorwerth at Ludlow Castle for peace talks, but the {{negotiations}} were unsuccessful. The same year Henry became suspicious of Walter's activities in Ireland and, among other measures to secure his loyalty, Ludlow Castle {{was taken over by}} the Crown for <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> years. This was cut short in May 1225 when Walter carried out a campaign against Henry's enemies in Ireland and paid the King 3,000marks for the return of his castles and lands. During the 1230s, however, Walter had accumulated a thousand pounds of debt to Henry and private moneylenders which he was unable to repay. As a result, in 1238 he gave Ludlow Castle as collateral to the King, although the fortification was returned to him sometime before his death in 1241.|$|E
5|$|Territories {{that had}} been conquered since the early 15th century were governed as condominiums by the cantons. Reeves for these territories were {{assigned}} by the Tagsatzung for <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> years; the posts changed bi-annually between the cantons. The Aargau had been annexed in 1415. The western part belonged to Bern, while the eastern part comprised the two condominiums of the former County of Baden {{in the north and}} the Freie Ämter ("Free Districts") in the south. The Free Districts had been forcibly recatholized after the Reformation in Switzerland, and the Catholic cantons, especially Lucerne, Zug, and Uri considered these districts part of their sphere of influence and the reeves typically came from these cantons. The Thurgau, which had been annexed in 1460, was also a condominium of the Confederacy.|$|E
5|$|The gestational period {{lasts for}} about {{eight and a}} half months, after which a single calf is born. Females in labour do not move away from the female herd and {{repeatedly}} lie down and get up again. Births normally take place in areas with short grass when the cow is in the lying position. She stands up immediately afterwards which causes the umbilical cord to break, vigorously licks the calf and chews on the afterbirth. In spite of regional variations, around 80% of the females give birth to their calves within <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> to three weeks after the onset of the rainy season - from mid-November to the end of December. Seasonal breeding has also been reported among wildebeest in captivity in European zoos. Twin births have not been reported.|$|E
