5|$|A {{survey of}} 1000 {{secondary}} school pupils and university students in Tayside conducted in February 2010 found 20% {{of them had}} previously taken mephedrone. Although {{at the time it}} was available legally over the internet, only 10% of users reported purchasing it online, with most purchasing it from street dealers. Of those who had used mephedrone, 97% said it was easy or very easy to obtain. Around 50% of users reported at least one negative effect <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of mephedrone, of which teeth grinding is the most common. Detailed interviews with users in Northern Ireland similarly found that few purchased mephedrone online, with most interviewees citing concerns that their address would be traced or that family members could intercept the package.|$|E
5|$|Malcolm Robert Jardine (8 June 1869– 16 January 1947) was an English {{first-class}} cricketer {{who played}} 46 matches, mainly for Oxford University. Although his first-class record was not impressive, he scored 140 in the University Match of 1892 using an unorthodox batting method. He played a few matches for Middlesex but later {{went to work}} in India, in effect ending his English first-class career. He played first-class cricket in India for the Europeans and after a successful legal career, returned to England. His son Douglas went on to play cricket for Oxford, Surrey and England, captaining the latter two and being <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of Bodyline bowling.|$|E
25|$|ADRs <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of {{intravenous}} lidocaine {{are similar}} to toxic effects from systemic exposure above. These are dose-related and more frequent at high infusion rates (≥3mg/min). Common ADRs include: headache, dizziness, drowsiness, confusion, visual disturbances, tinnitus, tremor, and/or paraesthesia. Infrequent ADRs <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of lidocaine include: hypotension, bradycardia, arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, muscle twitching, seizures, coma, and/or respiratory depression.|$|E
50|$|Also, {{the neutron}} {{irradiation}} of curium generates the higher actinides, such as californium, which increase <b>the</b> neutron dose <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>used</b> nuclear fuel; {{this has the}} potential to pollute <b>the</b> fuel cycle <b>with</b> strong neutron emitters. As a result, it is likely that curium will be excluded from most MOX fuels.|$|R
30|$|Finally, to ease network management, {{underlying}} network solutions {{should become}} more 'invisible'. To {{be able to}} reuse network solutions in different contexts, underlying communication interfaces should be presented in an abstract and ubiquitous way.

25|$|Some {{cases of}} lower-limb {{lymphedema}} have been <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of tamoxifen, {{due to the}} blood clots and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) that {{can be caused by}} this medication.

25|$|Flucloxacillin is {{contraindicated}} {{in those}} with a previous history of allergy to penicillins, cephalosporins, or carbapenems.

40|$|We have {{employed}} the relativistic coupled-cluster theory {{to calculate the}} electric dipole matrix elements in the singly ionized barium (Ba$^+$) and radium (Ra$^+$).

Static polarizabilities of the low-lying states and lifetimes of the first excited P-states are also determined using these matrix elements in Ba$^+$.

We describe the attributes of parcel data, discuss its value to a variety of stakeholders, present typical data flows across organizational boundaries, and illustrate a wide range of uses.

In our survey, this second group of instruments measuring attitudes towards money is related to parental transmissions <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>uses</b> of money, i.e. the values that have been transmitted regarding the appropriate way of using one’s financial resources. We considered it important to evaluate the money attitudes learned through the socialisation process established in childhood and that relate to ways of acting, {{because it has been}} demonstrated that these aspects influence adult behaviour (Argyle and Furnham, 1998; Furnham, Kirkcaldy, and Lynn, 1994). Moreover, parents are considered to play a decisive role in teaching attitudes towards money (Beutler and Dickson, 2008).|$|R
25|$|Carbon capture, utilization, and {{sequestration}} (or storage) {{is increasingly}} being utilized in modern coal gasification projects {{to address the}} greenhouse gas emissions concern <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of coal and carbonaceous fuels. In this respect, gasification has a significant advantage over conventional coal combustion, in which CO2 resulting from combustion is considerably diluted by nitrogen and residual oxygen in the near-ambient pressure combustion exhaust, making it relatively difficult, energy-intensive, and expensive to capture the CO2 (this is known as “post-combustion” CO2 capture).|$|E
25|$|Common adverse drug {{reactions}} <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of flucloxacillin include: diarrhoea, nausea, rash, urticaria, {{pain and}} inflammation at injection site, superinfection (including candidiasis), allergy, and transient increases in liver enzymes and bilirubin. Rarely, cholestatic jaundice (also {{referred to as}} cholestatic hepatitis) {{has been associated with}} flucloxacillin therapy. The reaction may occur up to several weeks after treatment has stopped, and takes weeks to resolve. The estimated incidence is one in 15,000 exposures, and is more frequent in people >55 years, females, and those with treatment longer than two weeks.|$|E
25|$|Most {{people with}} sickle-cell disease have {{intensely}} painful episodes called vaso-occlusive crises. However, the frequency, severity, {{and duration of}} these crises vary tremendously. Painful crises are treated symptomatically with pain medications; pain management requires opioid administration at regular intervals until the crisis has settled. For milder crises, a subgroup of patients manage on NSAIDs (such as diclofenac or naproxen). For more severe crises, most patients require inpatient management for intravenous opioids; patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) devices are commonly used in this setting. Diphenhydramine is also an effective agent that doctors frequently prescribe to help control itching <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of opioids.|$|E
