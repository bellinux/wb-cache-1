5|$|This {{phosphorylation}} {{reaction is}} an equilibrium, {{which can be}} shifted by altering the proton-motive force. In {{the absence of a}} proton-motive force, the ATP synthase reaction will run from right to left, hydrolyzing ATP and pumping protons out of the matrix across the membrane. However, when the proton-motive force is high, the reaction is forced to run in the opposite direction; it proceeds from left to right, allowing protons to flow down their concentration gradient and turning ADP into ATP. Indeed, in the closely related vacuolar type H+-ATPases, the hydrolysis reaction is used to <b>acidify</b> cellular compartments, by pumping protons and hydrolysing ATP.|$|E
5|$|Many households, {{and some}} small communities, rely on {{rainwater}} for their drinking water supplies. Roof-fed systems are highly vulnerable to contamination by ashfall, {{as they have}} a large surface area relative to the storage tank volume. In these cases, leaching of chemical contaminants from the ashfall can become a health risk and drinking of water is not recommended. Prior to an ashfall, downpipes should be disconnected so that water in the tank is protected. A further {{problem is that the}} surface coating of fresh volcanic ash can be acidic. Unlike most surface waters, rainwater generally has a very low alkalinity (acid-neutralising capacity) and thus ashfall may <b>acidify</b> tank waters. This may lead to problems with plumbosolvency, whereby the water is more aggressive towards materials that it comes into contact with. This can be a particular problem if there are lead-head nails or lead flashing used on the roof, and for copper pipes and other metallic plumbing fittings.|$|E

Male Sprague-Dawley rats swam for 2 h and were immediately administered <b>acidified</b> or skim milk, then euthanized at 30, 60, 90, and 120 min afterwards.

25|$|Carbon dioxide {{is removed}} from the {{atmosphere}} primarily through photosynthesis and enters the terrestrial and oceanic biospheres. Carbon dioxide also dissolves directly from the atmosphere into bodies of water (oceans, lakes, etc.), as well as dissolving in precipitation as raindrops fall through the atmosphere.

In trial 2, calves were fed colostrum stored in refrigerator (2 to 4 �C) after formic acid addition (ACRE). Liquid diets were <b>acidified</b> with formic acid at 0. 23 % vol/wt. Each batch of <b>acidified</b> colostrum (8 batches in ACAT and 10 batches in ACRE) was labelled 0 days old when colostrum from first eight milkings was mixed. Colostrum samples were collected at days 0, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 of storage. Mean pH for <b>acidified</b> colostrum stored at summer ambient temperatures was 4. 35 at day 0, it decreased to 3. 56 at day 10 (P< 0. 05) and then began increasing and rose to 4. 59 on the 25 th day of storage (P< 0. 05).

25|$|Diacetyl can be {{produced}} by the LAB through metabolism of sugar or of citric acid. While citric acid is naturally present in grapes, {{it is in a}} very small amount with most of it coming from deliberate addition by the winemaker to <b>acidify</b> the wine. In the presence of both malic and citric acids, the LAB use both, but use the malic much more quickly, with the rate of citric use/diacetyl formation influenced by the particular bacterial strain (with most strains of O. oeni producing less diacetyl than Lactobacillus and Pediococcis species), as well as the redox potential of the wine. In wine conditions that have a low redox potential (meaning it is more oxidative such as in a barrel that is not fully topped up), more citric acid will be consumed and diacetyl formed. In more reductive conditions, such as in alcoholic fermentations where yeast populations are at their peak and the wine is heavily saturated with carbon dioxide, the formation of diacetyl is much slower. The yeasts also help keep levels low by consuming diacetyl and reducing it to acetoin and butylene glycol.|$|E
25|$|Sphagnum is a genus of {{approximately}} 380 accepted species of mosses, {{commonly known as}} peat moss. Accumulations of Sphagnum can store water, since both living and dead plants can hold large quantities of water inside their cells; plants may hold 16–26 times as much water as their dry weight, depending on the species. The empty cells help retain water in drier conditions. Hence, as sphagnum moss grows, it can slowly spread into drier conditions, forming larger mires, both raised bogs and blanket bogs. These peat accumulations then provide habitat for {{a wide array of}} peatland plants, including sedges and ericaceous shrubs, as well as orchids and carnivorous plants. Sphagnum and the peat formed from it do not decay readily because of the phenolic compounds embedded in the moss's cell walls. In addition, bogs, like all wetlands, develop anaerobic soil conditions, which produces slower anaerobic decay rather than aerobic microbial action. Peat moss can also <b>acidify</b> its surroundings by taking up cations, such as calcium and magnesium, and releasing hydrogen ions. Under the right conditions, peat can accumulate to a depth of many meters. Different species of Sphagnum have different tolerance limits for flooding and pH, so any one peatland may have a number of different Sphagnum species.|$|E

40|$|Phenotypic {{plasticity}} may {{be critical}} {{to the maintenance of}} viable populations under future environmental change. Here we examined the role of behavioural avoidance of sub-optimal conditions in enabling the intertidal gastropod, Bembicium auratum, to persist in mangrove forests affected by the low pH runoff from acid sulphate soils (ASS). Behaviourally, the gastropod may be able to avoid periods of particularly high acidity by using pneumatophores and/or mangrove trunks to vertically migrate above the water line or by retreating into its shell. We hypothesised that (1) B. auratum would display greater and more rapid vertical migration out of <b>acidified</b> than reference estuarine waters, and (2) responses would be more pronounced in gastropods collected from <b>acidified</b> than reference sites. Gastropods from <b>acidified</b> sites showed significantly higher activity in and more rapid migration out of <b>acidified</b> waters of pH 6. 2 - 7. 0, than reference waters or waters of pH < 5. 0. Gastropods from reference locations showed a significantly weaker response to <b>acidified</b> water than those from <b>acidified</b> waters, and which did not significantly differ from their response to reference water. At extremely low pHs, < 5. 0, a higher proportion of both <b>acidified</b> and reference gastropods retreated into their shell than at higher pHs. Both the migration of gastropods out of <b>acidified</b> waters and retraction into their shells serves to reduce exposure time to <b>acidified</b> waters and may reduce the impact of this stressor on their populations. The stronger response to acidification of gastropods from populations previously exposed to this stressor suggests that the response may be learned, inherited or induced over multiple exposures. Our study adds to growing evidence that estuarine organisms may exhibit considerable physiological and behaviour adaptive capacity to acidification. The potential for such adaptive capacity should be incorporated into studies seeking to forecast impacts to marine organisms of environmental change. 9 page(s...|$|R
