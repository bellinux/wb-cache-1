25|$|Mucocutaneous {{leishmaniasis}} is {{very difficult}} to treat. Treatment involves the use of pentavalent <b>antimonial</b> compounds, which are highly toxic (common side effects include thrombophlebitis, pancreatitis, cardiotoxicity and hepatotoxicity) and not very effective. For example, in one study, despite treatment with high doses of sodium stibogluconate for 28 days, only 30% of patients remained disease-free at 12 months follow-up. Even in those patients who achieve an apparent cure, as many as 19% will relapse. Several drug combinations with immunomodulators have been tested, for example, a combination of pentoxifylline (inhibitor of TNF-Î±) and a pentavalent <b>antimonial</b> at a high dose for 30 days in a small-scale (23 patients) randomised placebo-controlled study from Brazil achieved cure rates of 90% and reduced time to cure, a result that should be interpreted cautiously in light of inherent limitations of small-scale studies. In an earlier small-scale (12 patients) study, addition of imiquimod showed promising results which need yet to be confirmed in larger trials.|$|E

James) taking their departure from the East Station of Bournemouth. The weather was raw and changeable, and Joseph was arrayed in consequence according {{to the principles of}} Sir Faraday Bond, a man no less strict (as is well known) on costume than on diet. There are few polite invalids who have not lived, or tried to live, by that punctilious physician's orders. [...] "Avoid tea, madam," [...] the reader has doubtless heard him say, [...] "avoid tea, fried liver, <b>antimonial</b> wine, and bakers' bread. Retire nightly at 10.45; and clothe yourself (if you please) throughout in hygienic flannel. Externally, the fur of the marten is indicated. Do not forget to procure a pair of health boots at Messrs. Dall and Crumbie's." [...] And he has probably called you back, even after you have paid your fee, to add with stentorian emphasis: [...] "I had forgotten one caution: avoid kippered sturgeon as you would the very devil!" [...] The unfortunate Joseph was cut to the pattern of Sir Faraday in every button; he was shod with the health boot; his suit was of genuine ventilating cloth; his shirt of hygienic flannel, a somewhat dingy fabric; and he was draped to the knees in the inevitable greatcoat of marten's fur. The very railway porters at Bournemouth (which was a favourite station of the doctor's) marked the old gentleman for a creature of Sir Faraday. There was but one evidence of personal taste, a vizarded forage-cap; from this form of headpiece, since he had fled from a dying jackal on the plains of Ephesus, and weathered a bora in the Adriatic, nothing could divorce our traveller.|$|E

40|$|Leishmania aethiopica is the {{etiological}} {{agent of}} cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in Ethiopia {{and can cause}} severe and complicated cases such as diffuse CL (DCL), mucocutaneous leishmaniasis or extensive CL, requiring systemic treatment. Despite the substantial burden, evidence-based treatment guidelines are lacking. We conducted a systematic review of clinical studies reporting on treatment outcomes of CL due to L aethiopica {{in order to help}} identify potentially efficacious medications on CL that can be taken forward for clinical trials. We identified a total of 24 records reporting on 506 treatment episodes of CL presumably due to L aethiopica. The most commonly used drugs were <b>antimonials</b> (n = 201), pentamidine (n = 150) and cryotherapy (n = 103). There were 20 case reports/series, with an overall poor study quality. We only identified two small and/or poor quality randomized controlled trials conducted a long time ago. There were two prospective non-randomized studies reporting on cryotherapy, <b>antimonials</b> and pentamidine. With cryotherapy, cure rates were 60 - 80 %, and 69 - 85 % with <b>antimonials.</b> Pentamidine appeared effective against complicated CL, also in cases non-responsive to <b>antimonials.</b> However, all studies suffered from methodological limitations. Data on miltefosine, paromomycin and liposomal amphotericin B are extremely scarce. Only a few studies are available on DCL. The only potentially effective treatment options for DCL seem to be <b>antimonials</b> with paromomycin in combination or pentamidine, but none have been properly evaluated. In conclusion, the evidence-base for treatment of complicated CL due to L aethiopica is extremely limited. While <b>antimonials</b> remain the most available CL treatment in Ethiopia, their efficacy and safety in CL should be better defined. Most importantly, alternative first line treatments (such as miltefosine or paromomycin) should be explored.

50|$|The {{resurrection of}} the <b>antimonial</b> cup may have {{occurred}} because of the prohibition of antimony in 1566 by an Act of Parliament. As a method to circumvent the law, metal tin cups were made with antimony {{as one of its}} ingredients. When wine was allowed to stand in one for approximately 24 hours the wine became impregnated with tartrate of antimony, from the action of the tartar contained in the wine upon the metal of the film of oxide formed upon its surface. This resulting alcoholic drink was attractive to sick patients as a medicine by purging the body. The family <b>antimonial</b> cup gathered increased powers of suggestion with years of being handed down from generation to generation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Antimonial</b> cups are {{extremely}} rare as only six are known in Great Britain, all in London, {{two in the}} Netherlands (Amsterdam and Leiden), one in Basel, Switzerland, one in Italy in the former papal palace in Ariccia and another one in London believed to have belonged to Captain James Cook, the English navigator. It is in the National Maritime Museum at Greenwich, London. The reason he had an <b>antimonial</b> cup is mostly of speculation, anything from stomach problems to scurvy. The provenance shows that it was acquired on loan in 1983 from Lady Rowley, daughter of the 8th Viscount Galway, Governor General of New Zealand. The family regarded it as a pewter communion cup and had owned it for many years. Lady Rowley's ancestor, General Robert Monckton, was General James Wolfe's second in command at Quebec. Cook {{was involved in the}} St Lawrence Expedition of 1759 under the joint command of Admiral Sir Edward Saunders and General Wolfe. The <b>antimonial</b> cup may have been bought by the 5th Viscount Galway (William George Monckton-Arundell) between 1815 and 1830 amongst Cook relics from a sale of the effects of Rear Admiral Isaac Smith, a nephew and companion of Mrs Elizabeth Cook (widow of James Cook).|$|E
50|$|Pentavalent <b>antimonials</b> (also {{abbreviated}} pentavalent Sb or SbV) are a {{group of}} compounds used {{for the treatment of}} leishmaniasis. They are also called pentavalent antimony compounds.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Antimonials</b> are {{the first}} drug of choice for the {{treatment}} of American tegumentary leishmaniasis (ATL); however, their efficacy is not predictable, and this may be linked to parasite drug resistance. We aimed to characterize the in vitro antimony susceptibility of clinical isolates of Peruvian patients with ATL who were treated with sodium stibogluconate and to correlate this in vitro phenotype with different treatment outcomes. METHODS: Thirty-seven clinical isolates were obtained from patients with known disease and treatment histories. These isolates were typed, and the susceptibility of intracellular amastigotes to pentavalent (SbV) and trivalent (SbIII) <b>antimonials</b> was determined. RESULTS: We observed 29 SbV-resistant isolates among 4 species of subgenus Viannia, most of which exhibited primary resistance; isolates resistant only to SbIII; and 3 combinations of in vitro phenotypes: (1) parasites sensitive to both drugs, (2) parasites resistant to both drugs, and (3) parasites resistant to SbV only (the majority of isolates fell into this category). There was no correlation between in vitro susceptibility to both <b>antimonials</b> and the clinical outcome of therapy. CONCLUSION: Antimony insensitivity might occur in a stepwise fashion (first to SbV and then to SbIII). Our data question the definition of true parasite resistance to <b>antimonials.</b> Further studies of treatment efficacy should apply standardized protocols and definitions and should also consider host factors...|$|R

The major toxic sideeffects of <b>antimonials</b> as a result of therapy are cardiotoxicity (~ 9 % of patients) and pancreatitis, which is seen commonly in HIV and visceral leishmaniasis co-infections.
