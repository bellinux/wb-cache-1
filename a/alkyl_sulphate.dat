40|$|A simple, {{rapid and}} {{convenient}} method for {{the synthesis of}} secondary <b>alkyl</b> <b>sulphate</b> esters is described in which the sodium alkoxide of the parent alcohol is sulphated by using triethylamine-SO 3 complex. The procedure gives relatively good yields, even for the sulphation of long-chain alcohols and those in which the hydroxy group is remote from the terminal carbon atoms. Positional isomerization, arising from the migration of the hydroxy group along the carbon chain, is absent, and resolved enantiomers of alcohols react with complete retention of configuration...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that {{secondary}} alkylsulphohydrolases from certain detergent-degrading micro-organisms are unusual esterases in that they catalyse fission of the C-O bond of the <b>alkyl</b> <b>sulphate</b> ester linkage. The position of bond fission catalysed by a primary alkylsulphatase and an arylsulphohydrolase present in Pseudomonas C 12 B has now been investigated. The primary alkylsulphatase behaved like the secondary alkylsulphohydrolases in cleaving the C-O bond of potassium heptan- 1 -yl sulphate. In contrast, the arylsulphohydrolase, in common with other similar enzymes previously studied, catalysed the fission of the O-S bond of potassium p-nitrophenyl sulphate...|$|E

The intact protein is a dimer with a mol. wt. of 160 000. Activity towards primary <b>alkyl</b> <b>sulphate</b> esters was maximal at pH 8. 3, varied little in the range pH 7. 8 - 8. 7, but decreased sharply at higher pH. For a homologous series of primary <b>alkyl</b> <b>sulphate</b> substrates (C 6 -C 12), logKm decreased linearly with increasing chain length, corresponding to {{a contribution to the}} free energy of association between enzyme and substrate of - 2. 5 kJ/mol for each additional CH 2 group in the alkyl chain. logKi for the competitive inhibition by secondary alkyl 2 -sulphate esters followed a similar pattern (- 2. 4 kJ/mol for each additional CH 2 group) except that only n- 1 carbon atoms effectively participate in hydrophobic bonding, implying that the C- 1 methyl group is not involved. logKi values for inhibition primary alkanesulphonates also depended linearly on chain length but with a diminished gradient, indicating a free-energy increment of - 1. 2 kJ/mol per additional CH 2 group. The collective results showed the presence of a hydrophobic site on the enzyme capable of accomodating an alkyl chain of considerable length.

The enzyme protein is dimeric with a subunit molecular mass of 77. 6 kDa, has an isoelectric point of pI 7. 2, and converts butyl- 1 -sulphate stoichiometrically into butan- 1 -ol and inorganic sulphate. Stoichiometric incorporation of 18 O from H 2 (18) O into sulphate during the reaction showed that enzymic hydrolysis occurred at the O-S bond of the C-O-S ester linkage. The enzyme was active on C 3 -C 7 linear primary <b>alkyl</b> <b>sulphates</b> but not on higher (C 8, 9) or lower (C 1, 2) homologues, although the latter pair were competitive inhibitors. The specificity constant (kcat. /Km) was highest for pentyl sulphate (Km 1. 89 +/- 0. 38 mM; kcat. 6. 86 +/- 0. 52 s- 1) and decreased for higher and lower homologues.

40|$|Sodium hexan- 1 -yl {{sulphate}} {{and certain}} related <b>alkyl</b> <b>sulphate</b> esters {{have been shown}} to serve as inducers of the formation of primary alkylsulphatases (designated as P 1 and P 2) in Pseudomonas C 12 B. When the organism is grown on sodium hexan- 1 -yl [35 S]sulphate as the sole source of sulphur or as the sole source of carbon and sulphur only the P 2 alkylsulphatase is formed and inorganic 35 SO 42 − is liberated into the media. Cell extracts contain this anion as the major 35 S-labelled metabolite although two unidentified labelled metabolites as well as choline O-[35 S]sulphate occur in trace quantities in some extracts. Dialysed cell extracts are capable of liberating inorganic 35 SO 42 − from sodium hexan- 1 -yl [35 S]sulphate without the need to include cofactors known to be required for the bacterial degradation of n-alkanes.

The CS 2 enzyme was purified to homogeneity, and an initial study was made of its general properties, specificity, cellular localization and relationship to the CS 1 enzyme. The CS 2 enzyme has a molecular weight of approx. 250000 and a subunit size of approx. 58000, indicating that the molecule is a tetramer.

40|$|The {{position}} of bond fission during the acidic hydrolysis of diethyl sulphite in {{water has been}} studied, using oxygen- 18 as a tracer, by Bunton, de la Mare, and Tillett (1969).

These authors, however, attribute the excess oxygen- 18 in the sample analysed, to the incomplete removal of oxygen- 18 water before analysis and assume that only sulphur-oxygen fission occurs. However, no evidence is produced to support this assumption. If alkyl-oxygen fission occurs to a small extent during the first-stage acid catalysed hydrolysis of diethyl sulphite, {{it seems unlikely that}} it would occur during the second-stage hydrolysis because the mechanism of the second-stage hydrolysis would probably involve sulphur-oxygen fission judging from the behaviour of the nearest related compounds, the <b>alkyl</b> <b>sulphates.</b> First-stag...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: Teepol, {{a modern}} anionic detergent, has been {{investigated}} and used in culture media for organisms of the coli-typhoid group, in substitution for bile salts. Media containing 0. 1 yo Teepol and {{an indicator of the}} sulphonphthalein group have been found to possess advantages over MacConkey's medium. While bile salts as marketed are costly and variable in their bacteriological properties, Teepol is cheap and reliable. MacConkey (1908) described a culture medium which still has a wide field of use. This medium incorporates an intestinal detergent, sodium taurocholate, which confers selectivity and suppresses the swarming of Proteus. Lominski & Lendrum (1942) showed that swarming is inhibited by surface active agents, particularly straight chain <b>alkyl</b> <b>sulphates</b> which have a peak of anti-swarming activity when the molecular chain has 12 carbon atoms.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{demonstrate}} {{the effects of}} weak magnetic fields (> approximately 1 mT) on chemical reactions involving free radicals, {{in the context of}} possible effects of environmental electromagnetic radiation on biological systems. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Transient absorption, flash photolysis experiments have been performed to study the kinetics and yields of radical reactions. The triplet state of benzophenone {{has been used as a}} convenient source of radical pairs, whose identity is largely immaterial to the investigation of the so-called Low Field Effect. Hydrogen abstraction from surfactant molecules in micelles yields a pair of neutral radicals, one large and one small, in a region of restricted translational and rotational motion. RESULTS: In <b>alkyl</b> <b>sulphate</b> and sulphonate micelles a weak field increases the concentration of free radicals that escape from the micelle to an extent that depends on the structure, dynamics and volume of the space in which the radical pairs are confined. The effect (up to 10 %) is typically largest at 1 - 2 mrT. Smaller effects are found for Brij and TX 100 micelles. CONCLUSIONS: Low Field Effects depend strongly on the local environment of the radical pair. Larger effects than observed here might be expected for radicals formed from singlet (rather than triplet) precursors, as would be the case in biological reactions...|$|E
40|$|AIMS: To {{establish}} {{the ability of}} the rhamnolipids biosurfactants from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, in the presence and absence of caprylic acid and ascorbic acid, to disrupt bacterial biofilms, compared with the anionic <b>alkyl</b> <b>sulphate</b> surfactant Sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS). METHODS AND RESULTS: Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 15442 biofilms were disrupted by rhamnolipids at concentrations between 0 · 5 and 0 · 4 g l(- 1) and with SDS at 0 · 8 g l(- 1). The combination of rhamnolipids 0 · 4 g l(- 1) and caprylic acid at 0 · 1 g l(- 1) showed a remarkable effect on biofilm disruption and cell killing. After 30 min of treatment most of the biofilm was disrupted and cell viability was significantly reduced. Neither caprylic acid nor ascorbic acid has any effect on biofilm disruption at 0 · 1 g l(- 1). SDS is an effective antimicrobial agent; however, in the presence of caprylic acid its effect was neutralized. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that rhamnolipids at low concentration in the presence of caprylic acid are promising molecules for inhibition/disruption of biofilms formed by Ps. aeruginosa ATCC 15442.

The detergents belonged to the alkyl pyridinium, alkyl trimethylammonium or <b>alkyl</b> <b>sulphate</b> families. Large unilamellar liposomes formed by egg phosphatidylcholine plus or minus stearylamine or dicetyl phosphate were used. Solubilization was assessed as a decrease in light-scattering of the liposome suspensions.

In addition, from the study of thirty different liposome-surfactant systems, we have derived a series of empirical rules that may be useful in predicting the behaviour of untested surfactants: (i) the detergent concentration producing the onset of solubilization (Don) decreases as the alkyl chain length increases; the decrease follows a semi-logarithmic pattern in the case of alkyl pyridinium compounds; (ii) for surfactants with critical micellar concentrations (cmc) less than 6 x 10 (- 3) M, Don. is independent of the nature of the detergent and the bilayer composition; for detergents having cmc greater than 6 x 10 (- 3) M, Don. increases linearly with the cmc; and (iii) Don. varies linearly with the surfactant concentration that produces maximum solubilization...|$|E

30|$|Calculation of log Kow/D for the {{majority}} of anionic surfactants, e.g. alkylbenzene sulphonates, <b>alkyl</b> <b>sulphates,</b> using the H&L approach with a variety of surfactant specific modifications has been widely researched and validated. When compared to this approach, CLOGP appears to give consistently higher log Kow values for the sulphate-containing surfactants. This is due to the lower fragment value used for the sulphate fragment (−[*] 2.17 cf. −[*] 5.87 in H&L method). KOWWIN and Broto both scored highly when considering R 2 alone with values of 0.999 for both methods (Additional file 4 : Table S 7). Whilst ALOGP predictions also appear consistently high for selected compounds in this class, using the MAE measure of predictivity, ALOGP ranked by far the best when considering magnitude of the error with an MAE value of 0.16 (Additional file 4 : Table S 8) followed by Molinspiration, KOWWIN and H&L with modifications (with MAE values of 0.46, 0.83 and 1.06, respectively). When taking into account the threshold approach also, in which only the ALOGP method scores as a moderate predictor compared to poor/bad scoring for all other methods (Additional file 4 : Table S 9), ALOGP is consistently better for predicting log Kow/D for anionic surfactants based on this small dataset.

Additional evidence has been obtained to indicate {{that it is probably}} optically stereospecific for d-secondary <b>alkyl</b> <b>sulphate</b> esters with the ester sulphate group at C- 2 and with a chain length of at least seven carbon atoms. Enzyme activity towards racemic samples of heptan- 2 -yl sulphate (1 -methylhexyl sulphate), octan- 2 -yl sulphate and decan- 2 -yl sulphate (1 -methylnonyl sulphate) increased with increasing chain length. l-Octan- 2 -yl sulphate is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme, as are certain primary alkyl sulphates and primary alkanesulphonates.

Vmax. reached a maximum with the C 9 compound, whereas logKm decreased linearly as the alkyl-chain length was increased from C 7 to C 14. A parallel series of l-alkan- 2 -yl sulphates was also prepared, and these esters, together with homologous series of primary alkyl sulphates and primary alkanesulphonates, were shown to be competitive inhibitors of the CS 2 enzyme. For each series of compounds, logKi values decreased linearly with increasing alkyl-chain length. Plots of chain length against the standard free energy of binding (ΔG 0) of substrate and inhibitors to the CS 2 enzyme showed that the standard free energy of association of a –CH 2 – group with the enzyme was 2. 0 – 2. 4 kJ/mol for all classes of compound studied, indicating an important contribution from hydrophobic interactions to the overall binding.

This indicates that the binding of any one of these particular inhibitors involves one carbon atom fewer than the number involved in binding a substrate of the same chain length.

A reagent (secondary <b>alkyl</b> <b>sulphate)</b> {{is added to the}} milk and the number of somatic cells estimated from the resultant viscosity of the mixture. The Ruakura rolling ball viscometer has been developed to measure the viscosity of the CMT gel. It consists of a tube mounted horizontally so that the milk-reagent mixture can be introduced into it. After a holding time of 26 seconds the tube tips through an angle of 25 ° allowing a stainless steel ball to roll through the mixture for a standard time before returning to the horizontal. The distance the ball has rolled is inversely related to the viscosity developed. The physical function of the viscometer follows Stokes' Law. The range of the instrument is suited to reading the viscosity developed by the CMT reaction in New Zealand herd milks. The viscous reaction in milk is caused by somatic cell nuclei forming a fibrillar network. The reaction intensity is related to the DNA content of the milk sample. Proteins can modify the viscosity developed. Bacterial DNA does not enter the reaction. The network is fragile and rheomalaxic in nature. The reaction intensity in milk varies with time. An approximate 25 second holding time is required before determining the viscosity. After this holding time the reaction intensity progressively decreases. Milk to be tested should be under 24 hours old although refrigeration or boric acid preservative can extend this time. Different operators can rank milk samples by somatic cell count in a similar order with the Ruakura rolling ball viscometer.

E. coli attached to stainless steel surfaces became significantly more susceptible to benzalkonium chloride (BAC) after treatment with sodium <b>alkyl</b> <b>sulphate</b> (SAS) by 0. 51 Log 10 cfu ml- 1 and fatty alcohol ethoxylate (FAE) by 0. 96 Log 10 cfu ml- 1. No change in susceptibility was observed with sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), sodium lauryl ethyl sulphate (SLES) or polyethoxylated alcohol (PEA). L. monocytogenes became significantly less susceptible to BAC after treatment with anionic detergents SAS by 0. 79 Log 10 cfu ml- 1, SDS by 0. 33 Log 10 cfu ml- 1 and SLES by 0. 22 Log 10 cfu ml- 1, yet no change in susceptibility was observed with FAE. Following treatment with all detergents both organisms became significantly more susceptible to sodium dichloroisocyanurate (NaDCC) demonstrating that the effect of the disinfectant was independent of detergent type. Flow cytometry using the fluorochrome propidium iodide (PI) revealed significant increases in cell membrane permeability of both organisms by all detergents except sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) and the effect was much greater in E. coli. Increasing above the in-use concentration of SAS and FAE had no further effect on cell membrane permeability, or susceptibility to BAC. Hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) showed that E. coli became less hydrophobic following treatment with SAS, SDS, FAE and L. monocytogenes became less hydrophobic following treatment with SAS and SDS but no effect was seen with FAE. Investigations into carbon chain length of detergent revealed that SAS and the C 18 standard increased susceptibility of E. coli to BAC which, with permeability results, suggests a link between increase in susceptibility to BAC and increase in membrane permeability. Efflux experiments with L. monocytogenes showed that efflux of ethidium bromide (EtBr) was greater from cells treated with SAS than with FAE suggesting that the anionic charge on the detergent molecule influences an efflux mechanism that reduces susceptibility to BAC. Overall the results demonstrate that detergent type can influence the sensitivity of persistent food borne microorganisms to BAC and NaDCC and the significance of the findings may impact on the choice of agents used in cleaning procedures in the food industry...|$|E
40|$|Anionic {{surfactants}} {{are used}} worldwide in detergent and household cleaning products. Due to their extensive use, surfactants can {{find their way}} into wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), where they may be completely or partially removed. Anionic surfactants not only have adverse effects on aquatic and terrestrial environment, but also can have adverse effects on the WWTP operation and performance. Anionic surfactants are the major class used in detergent formulations. Sodium Dodecylbenzene Sulphonate (SDBS) {{is a member of the}} LAS group and Sodium Dodecyl Sulphate (SDS) is a member of the <b>Alkyl</b> <b>Sulphate</b> group. This study selected SDS and SDBS as model anionic surfactants due to their widespread use. The aim of this study is to assess the effect of the presence of anionic surfactants in the influent to WWTPs on activated sludge processes. To accomplish this aim, the effect of the presence of SDS and SDBS on activated sludge oxygen uptake rate (OUR) and nitrification was assessed according to the ISO standard methods. The OUR method facilitates estimation of the effects of anionic surfactants on activated sludge microorganisms in aerobic biological treatment systems. A nitrification inhibition test was developed by International Standard Organization and has been used by many researchers for assessing the inhibitory effects of anionic surfactants on nitrifying microorganisms in activated sludge. The morphology of activated sludge flocs was also evaluated to help investigate the effect of anionic surfactants on the settling behaviour of flocs. The results indicated that the anionic surfactants SDS and SDBS have an adverse effect on the activated sludge OUR and nitrification activities. Inhibition to OUR increased from 12. 9 % to 44. 2 % for SDS concentrations from 5 to 100 mg/L, after 30 minutes of incubation. The inhibition to OUR decreased with increased incubation time to 180 minutes reaching 6 % at 5 mg/L and 27 % at 100 mg/L. SDBS showed a strong inhibitory effect on activated sludge OUR where an inhibition of 19. 8 % to 79. 1 % was measured after 30 minutes, which declined reaching 15 % to 69. 2 %, after 180 minutes, for the same concentration range. SDS and SDBS also showed an inhibitory effect on activated sludge nitrification which followed a trend that was in agreement with that observed for their inhibition to OUR. SDS and SDBS inhibition to nitrification was proportional to their initial concentrations. For example, inhibition to nitrification increased from 5. 9 % to 46. 5 % with increase SDS concentration from 5 to 100 mg/L compared with 12. 9 % to 53. 6 % for the same concentration range of SDBS. The results obtained demonstrated that the inhibitory effects of SDS and SDBS on activated sludge biological activities were intensified at low temperature, as measured in terms of OUR and nitrification. However, inhibition to nitrification decreased significantly with a temperature increase from 20 &ordm;C to 30 &ordm;C. The results showed that the presence of SDS and SDBS in the activated sludge aeration basins may lead to changes to the morphology of activated sludge flocs measured in terms of the mean projected area and perimeter...|$|E

40|$|Natural {{products}} {{have historically been}} {{a rich source of}} “lead compounds” in drug discovery. The investigation of terrestrial plants and marine organisms aimed at searching new biologically active compounds is a central issue of this kind of studies, trough structure elucidation combined with biological tests. My research activity has been mainly devoted to the discovery and to the chemical and pharmacological investigation of new bioactive natural products as “lead compounds” in the area of antitumor, anti inflammatory and antimalarial activities. My research work, described in this PhD thesis, was organized in two different topics, i) isolation and structural characterization of bioactive secondary metabolites from marine invertebrates; ii) synthesis of quinones derivatives endowed with cytotoxic and antimalarial activities from natural lead compounds. The fulfilment of my research project required the use of different procedures of isolation and extraction. The chemical characterization of the isolated compounds has been performed through an extensive spectroscopic analysis (UV, IR, ECD, 1 D and 2 D NMR) together with mass spectrometry and computational methods. I have also used synthetic methods both for the chemical derivatization of the isolated molecules and for the preparation of analogues on the simplified model of natural molecules. During the course of research conducted during the PhD course and whose results are reported in the following thesis, I have dealt with the extraction and chemical analysis of different species of sea squirts (Aplidium conicum, Ciona edwarsii, Aplidium elegans, Phallusia fumigata and Sidnyum elegans) and of the sponge Axinella polypoides. This analysis led to the isolation of new molecules, which are structurally different, with interesting bioactivity. Among these, two new meroterpenes, conithiaquinones A and B, and three <b>alkyl</b> <b>sulphates</b> with cytotoxic properties. Three sulfated sterols, phallusiasterols A-C, one of them with agonist activity on the pregnane X receptor (PXR) in HepG 2 cells. The phosphoeleganin, a potent inhibitor of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1 B (PTP 1 B). An analysis of the metabolic content of the sponge Axinella polypoides has provided important chemo-taxonomic information about the organism, in addition, led to the isolation of a new betaine and a new cyclonucleoside. Within the study of compounds with antimalarial activity, in collaboration with the University of Rome La Sapienza and the Department of Public Health, Microbiology and Virology, University of Milan, I have performed the synthesis and evaluation of in vitro on strains of Plasmodium falciparum D 10 (chloroquine-sensitive) and W 2 (chloroquine-resistant) of synthetic analogues of natural quinones, prepared on the pattern of two natural molecules previously isolated from an ascidian. The synthetic derivatives showed significant antimalarial activity and were also highlighted some structural requirements that are critical for the activity. Finally, during the period of research at the Institute of Materia Medica (SIMM) in Shanghai, I started to study lipid-soluble extract of a fungal strain Penicillium sp, isolated from the Chinese mangrove Bruguiera gymnorrhiza. The analysis showed that the main component of the extract is a cytotoxic alkaloid, 2 -(1 -hydroxyethyl) - 4 (3 H) quinazolinone, which is currently subject to a broader drug screening...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on ways to control the {{characteristics}} of a thermo-responsive polymer called poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAAM). The thermal behaviour of pNIPAAM displays an inverse solubility upon heating above what is known as its Lower Critical Solution Temperature (LCST). Experimentally, it converts from a hydrophilic to a hydrophobic structure when placed in aqueous media between the temperatures 30 - 35 °C. This phenomenon places pNIPAAM as a potential candidate for use as a soft polymer actuator, and we are specifically interested in exploiting this behaviour for potential applications in microfluidic valves and drug delivery. However, there are some drawbacks associated with this thermo-responsive polymer. Generally, the polymerization medium used for the synthesis of pNIPAAM is an organic solvent. This is a limitation for pNIPAAM-based hydrogels used in open atmosphere and {{in a wide range of}} temperatures, as the liquid phase of the gel can be prone to freezing or evaporation due to its volatility. Its poor mechanical properties, especially in its swollen state, are detrimental to its role as a vessel for drug delivery. Because of its non-biodegradable nature, surgical removal after drug release may be required. If the device were too soft and easily broken during handling, it would be difficult to be completely removed through traditional surgical procedures. Also, weak mechanical properties are not desirable for microfluidic valves which can be exposed to harsh chemicals and high solvent pressures. The main focus of this thesis is to address these limitations and further optimize the pNIPAAM hydrogel for application. The main theme of my work was the replacement of the common organic solvent with Ionic Liquids (ILs) as a polymerization medium for pNIPAAM, in order to create a series of ionogels. ILs are molten salts that consist of a cation and anion held together via weak electrostatic interactions, which reduce the lattice energy of the salt. This chemical environment contributes to factors such as negligible vapour pressure and general high thermal stability. The tailoring of the anion or cation can also lead to a variation of properties. The first chapter of my work described the physicochemical properties of free- standing crosslinked pNIPAAM gels generated in the presence of varying ILs. The resulting ionogels were found to exhibit LCST values different to that of pNIPAAM and improved swelling/shrinking behaviour compared with that of the conventional pNIPAAM hydrogel. Most interestingly, the pNIPAAM shrinking behaviour was completely eliminated with use of dicyanamide as the IL anion. The ionogel from this report with the most desirable shrinking/swelling behaviour was then studied in terms of drug release. This ionogel was found to have greater water uptake, and better mechanical stability that the conventional hydrogel. When pre-loaded with a dye acting as a drug mimic it was also found to have greater release capabilities. Following this, varying concentrations of pNIPAAM were integrated into a cross- linked thermo-responsive Polymeric Ionic Liquid (PIL), producing an interpenetrating network (IPN). This novel material is characterized as function of the concentration of pNIPAAM within the gel. The IPN with the highest concentration of pNIPAAM was found to display the most favourable swelling/shrinking properties. Lastly, progressions from this area also led to the synthesis of 1 -vinylimidazolium <b>alkyl</b> <b>sulphate</b> polymeric ionic liquids (PILs). These PILs were synthesized using a halide-free method and were found to possess sufficient thermal stability of up to 340 °C and mechanical stability with a storage moduli value as high as 4. 64 x 106 Pa...|$|E
40|$|Sponges {{represent}} {{the most prolific}} producers of novel marine bioactive secondary metabolites. In the last years, several drugs derived from marine natural products {{have appeared in the}} market, and others are in clinical trials. The aim of my research project was to exploit the unusual and often surprising chemistry of marine sponges, in the frame of the more general purpose of discovering and developing new drugs from natural products. The research work presented in this PhD Thesis was directed to two different aspects of the study of marine secondary metabolites. On one hand, in parallel with the advent of environmental genomics from a drug discovery perspective, the largest part of my research activity focused on the metagenomic analysis of the Caribbean sponge P. simplex, and was aimed at the identification of new genes coding for polyketide synthases (PKSs), the giant enzyme complexes that produce polyketides, a large class of secondary metabolites that include many antibiotic and antitumor compounds. On the other hand, the remaining part of the research described in this PhD Thesis was more related to the “core activity” of natural product chemistry, and directed to the isolation and structure elucidation of new bioactive compounds from different specimens of sponges living in tropical oceans, wonderful sources of unusual molecular architectures to be used as leads and scaffolds for the elaboration of new drugs. Metagenomic investigations on Plakortis simplex (Demospongiae, Homosclerophorida, Plakinidae) was started because the sponge is known for the production of large amounts of polyketide peroxides, of which plakortin is the most abundant. Plakortin is of special interest due to its anti-malarial activity, which is retained also against chloroquine-resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum. Therefore, a study of the biosynthesis of plakortin was undertaken, with the final aim of its biotechnological production. Most non-aromatic polyketides are synthesized by type I polyketide synthases (type I PKSs), produced in a number of cases by bacterial symbionts. The bacterial origin of plakortin is therefore a reasonable hypothesis, and indeed cell fractionation of P. simplex has shown that plakortin is mainly present in the bacterial cells. Since cultivation of true sponge symbionts failed in most cases, the search for the plakortin genes had to rely on cultivation-independent techniques, such as the study of the sponge metagenome (collective genome of the sponge and its symbionts). While the putative genes implied in plakortin biosynthesis could not be identified, an unexpected result from the metagenomic library screening was the discovery of Swf, a new group of mono-modular type I PKS/FAS (“hybrid polyketide synthase/fatty acid synthase”), which appears to be specifically associated to sponge symbionts. The putative swf operon consists of swfA (FAS/PKS I), swfB (R and ST domains), and swfC (radical SAM). SwfA contains a single PKS module, which builds the backbone of the acyl chain by recruiting iteratively malonyl units according to the substrate determining motif of its AT domain. The domain organization of SwfA is KS-AT-DH-ER-KR-ACP and from this architecture a saturated fatty acyl chain is expected, although a (poly) unsaturated and/or (poly) hydroxylated acyl chain cannot be excluded, because in iterative PKSs the reduction domains can be optionally used during each of the elongation steps. SwfB [composed of R (thioester reductase) and ST (sulfotransferase) domains] and SwfC (a radical SAM), are expected to modify the acyl chain produced by SwfA in unknown ways. As the R and ST domains are contiguous in SwfB, the expected product of elaboration of an acyl chain by SwfB would possibly be an <b>alkyl</b> <b>sulphate</b> or an alkylaminosulphonate: while the R domain can reductively release the assembled chain as a primary alcohol or amine, the ST domain can transfer the sulfate group to the hydroxyl or amino group. SwfC represents a radical SAM enzyme which can catalyze methylation of the substrate through a radical mechanism. Two different examples of the swf cluster were found in the metagenome of P. simplex, PS 11 G 3 and PSA 11 D 7 (PSA 11 D 7 lacks the swfC gene). In addition, PCR amplification of metagenomic DNA from three different and taxonomically distant “high microbial abundance” sponges, Aplysina fulva, Smenospongia aurea and Pseudoceratina crassa, with primers designed for swf, produced amplicons which showed high sequence similarities to the AT domain of swfA. Therefore, the swf cluster is widespread in marine sponges and presumably associated to ubiquitous sponge symbionts. It represents the second group of mono-modular PKS, after the supA family, to be ubiquitously present in marine sponges. Preliminary studies of heterologous expression of swf genes were undertaken with the final aim of characterizing the unknown metabolite produced by the cluster. Activation of the ACP domain of the SwfA protein to its holo-form by co-expression with the phosphopantetheinyl transferase Svp was the first functional proof of swf type genes in marine sponges. Furthermore, applying homologous recombination for expression vector engineering, swfA was clearly expressed at the protein level in E. coli BL 21 -CodonPlus®(DE 3) -RIPL cells by coexpression with the chaperone plasmid pTf 16, which encodes for the molecular chaperone Trigger factor aiding the protein folding process. After cloning the whole swf operon into the expression vector pHIS 8 -Svp by homologous recombination, the new recombinant construct was used for heterologous expression trials of the whole cluster in E. coli BL 21 -(DE 3) BAP 1. Methanol extracts of transformants and their culture broths were analysed by LC-HR-ESI-MS, but no compounds which were present in all the transformants and absent in all the negative controls could be detected. In addition, fatty acid composition of transformants and their culture broths was characterized by saponification of the lipid extract and derivatization to fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) followed by GC/MS analysis. Even in this case, no new metabolite was detected, suggesting that the swf pathway is not functional in this expression system. As a consequence, the biosynthetic function of the swf cluster remains unknown at present. In parallel, metagenomic investigations conducted using high-throughput sequencing based on massively parallel 454 pyrosequencing led to a comprehensive overview of the polyketide metabolism of P. simplex and its symbionts, shedding light on the existence of novel polyketide synthase pathways potentially involved in bioactive compound biosynthesis. 454 pyrosequencing was performed on complex and heterogeneous PCR products amplified from the metagenomic DNA of P. simplex with degenerate probes targeting ketosynthase and acyltransferase domains of type I PKSs. Next generation sequencing of AT amplicon mixture generated 8995 reads; applying this modern approach, no PKS/FAS other than known SupA and SwfA could be found. Almost 51 % of the total reads belonged to the Swf enzymes, while only the 4 % was represented by AT belonging to SupA enzymes (the remaining reads appear not to be related to AT domains). On the other hand, 454 pyrosequencing of KS amplicon PCR mixture generated 19333 reads. Besides the expected huge presence of KS forming parts of SupA enzymes (~ 80 % of the total reads), BLASTx analyses led to the detection of 8 new KS fragments, not reported in genbank database. All the eight putative KS fragments (which based on phylogenetic analysis appeared to be part of one hybrid NRPS-cis-AT PKS and seven cis-AT PKSs) are significantly different (E values ≥ 10 - 6) to each other, and BLASTx analysis as well as the rebuilt phylogenetic taxonomy revealed that they are only distantly related to PKSs of characterized function. In addition, phylogenetic analyses suggest that these KS fragments are mainly related to PKSs from Cyanobacteria, Actinomycetes and Myxobacteria, commonly known as precious sources of bioactive polyketides. These fragments may represent important starting points for further research towards the isolation of new PKS genes. The second line of research of my project was directed to the isolation and structure elucidation of new secondary metabolites from two tropical sponges, Chalinula molitba and Plakortis cf. lita. Stereo structure determination of the new compounds was determined by a combination of mass spectrometry, mono- and bidimensional NMR experiments and micro-scale chemical degradation. The analysis of the organic extract of the Caribbean sponge C. molitba led to the identification of chalinulasterol, a new C- 24 chlorinated sterol disulfate. On the basis of the structural similarity with the PXR agonist solomonsterol A, the possible role of chalinulasterol as modulator of the pregnane-X receptor activity was evaluated by carrying out a transactivation assay (luciferase assay) on HepG 2 cells, a human hepatocarcinoma cell line. Despite the structural similarity, chalinulasterol failed in transactivating PXR. The possibility that chalinulasterol could act as potential PXR antagonist was investigated, thus, also in this case, failed to reverse the induction of luciferase caused by rifaximin. Although negative, these results have an important implication in terms of structure-activity relationship, because they suggest that the sulfate group (absent in chalinulasterol) present in the side chain at position C- 24 of solomonsterol A is essential in the ligand-receptor binding and receptor transactivation, confirming a proposed binding model where a clear interaction of the 24 -sulfate with the positively charged Lys 210 is hypothesized. Chemical analysis of the Indonesian sponge P. lita revealed, as first remarkable result, a secondary metabolite profile (glycolipids, hopanoids, polyketides) that, in spite of the geographical distance, was very {{similar to that of the}} Caribbean sponges of the genus Plakortis. Taking into account that secondary metabolites are often of bacterial origin, this indicates that bacterial communities associated to many species of Plakortis sponges are highly specific and consistently conserved in specimens collected in different times and geographical areas, suggesting vertical transmission within their hosts. In addition, among the many known compounds, plakohopanoid, a novel type of hopanoid, was isolated. Plakohopanoid is composed of a C 32 hopanoid acyl ester-linked to a mannosyl-myo-inositol unit. It is interesting to note that C 32 hopanoic derivatives are commonly considered as geohopanoids, i. e. diagenetic products formed through abiotic degradation of the hopanoids biosynthesized by bacteria (biohopanoids). As a consequence, the presence of plakohopanoid in a marine living organism is worthy of note, because it shows that there is a biosynthetic pathway to C 32 hopanoic acids, which therefore should not be classified anymore as sure geohopanoids...|$|E

The benzothiadiazoles and their selenium analogues only combine with one molecular proportion of quaternizing agent; while some bis- quaternaries have been prepared, di-quaternary salts are never obtained. The merits of various quaternizing agents, viz., <b>alkyl</b> iodides, dialkyl <b>sulphates,</b> <b>alkyl</b> p-toluenesulphonates, and alkyl 2, 4 -dinitrobenzenesulphonates for the preparation of methyl and ethyl quaternary salts of these very weak bases are discussed, and the anions of such compounds are exchanged to form chlorides, bromides, iodides, perchlorates, thiocyanates and cyanides, with interesting properties. Though 1, 2, 3 -benzothiadiazole is an unsymmetrical compound, in practice {{only one of the}} three possible isomers of alkyl- 1, 2, 3 - benzothiadiazolium salts is obtained. The position of alkylation is considered in the light of evidence from reductive cleavage (to give N-alkyl-o-aminothiophenols), reaction with alkali and spectroscopic measurements; N(3) appears the most likely site. There is little doubt about the structure of alkyl- 2,l, 3 -benzothiadiazolium and -benzoselenadiazolium salts; their decomposition in water yields sulphurous or selenious acid and the N-alkyl-o-phenylenediamine. The alkyl 2, 4 -dinitrobenzenesulphonates afford the best scope for obtaining higher alkyl quaternaries. The benzothiadiazoles and their selenium analogues undergo quaternization with n-propyl, n-butyl, n-amyl, iso-butyl and iso-amyl 2, 4 -dinitrobenzenesulphorates, though thermal decomposition of the iso-alkyl esters is a serious problem. Secondary or tertiary alkyl 2, 4 -dinitrobenzenesulphonates are unobtainable but very small quantities of sec. -alkyl quaternary iodides of l, 2, 3 -benzothiadiazole and 2, 1, 3 -benzoselenadiazole result from the use of iso-propyl iodide. Some polymethylene bis-quaternaries are prepared, especially by means of a convenient one-stage process involving heterocyclic base, ?,w-di-iodoalkane and silver 2, 4 -dinitrobenzenesulphonate. The work done establishes that the effectiveness of the alkyl 2, 4 - dinitrobenzenesulphonates as quaternizing agents decreases as the series is ascended.

However, the difficulty lies in the fact that chitin in cell walls of fungi Aspergillus niger is covalently bonded with glucans, which can be completely separated by means of enzymes only. Chitin-glucan complex obtained contains about 15 - 20 % glucan, but its presence results in important changes of consumer product qualities in comparison with chitin shells of crustaceans.

40|$|Structured liquid' {{detergent}} {{products have}} received much attention {{as a means}} of providing liquid detergent compositions with special rheological and other properties. These include the ability to suspend particles and storage stability at ambient temperatures. The challenge is to prevent separation of the product into two or more layers (which requires a high viscosity) while controlling the rheology to allow a sufficient ease of pouring acceptable to the consumer. Liquid laundry detergent compositions are generally formulated with a variety of active ingredients, typically one or more anionic surfactants, often in combination with a nonionic surfactant and detergent builder materials such as electrolytes. The microstructure of these 'liquids' (determined by the product formulation, process conditions and procedures) strongly influences the macroscopic properties such as rheology. In this work, the microstructure, rheology and aging of a range of model structured liquid have been studied. The model systems are complex aqueous mixtures of sodium alkylbenzene <b>sulphate</b> (LAS), sodium <b>alkyl</b> ether <b>sulphate</b> (SLES) and primary alcohol ethoxylate (NEODOL 25 - 7). The dependence of the phase microstructure on sample composition was investigated by added different amount of electrolyte (tri-sodium citrate, TSC) in the model system. The physical appearance of these systems varied from transparent to milky depending on the concentration of the electrolyte. All were viscous 'gels'. Optical microscopy and SAXS have been used to elucidate the basic microstructure, its variation with electrolyte concentration and temperature on the angstrom to micrometer length scale. Deuterium nuclear magnetic resonance (2 H NMR) spectroscopy on 2 H 2 O-enriched samples has been used to provide information about the phase behaviour of the liquid crystalline systems. Changes in spectral line shape and water quadrupole splittings are presented and discussed as a function of sample composition, temperature and aging process. The shear-alignment process of the lamellar microstructure has been examined including Linkam optical shear cell, AR 2000 rheometer and 2 H Rheo-NMR. A variety of rheological patterns including simple stress sweeps and oscillatory rheology have been investigated and provided information about the effect of shear, shear time and nature of deformation of the model structured liquids. In this context, the relaxation kinetics of the shear-induced structures has been investigated using 2 H Rheo-NMR spectroscopy. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
