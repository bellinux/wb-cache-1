50|$|By early July 1944, {{over one}} hundred <b>airmen</b> were in areas under Chetnik control. The German and Bulgarian {{occupation}} forces in Serbia that had spotted the damaged aircraft and open parachutes pursued the <b>airmen.</b> However, Chetniks {{under the control of}} Mihailović had already reached them. The Germans offered cash to the local Serbian population for the capture of Allied <b>airmen.</b> The peasants accepted the <b>airmen</b> into their homes and fed them for months without Allied help. Hospitals for sick and wounded <b>airmen</b> were established in Pranjani village.|$|R
5|$|The {{locations}} {{of several of}} the Beaufighter planes—gravesites—were found by marine archeologist Rob Rondeau and diving crew 60 years later.

5|$|Cadets have a rank {{structure}} {{similar to}} the United States Air Force enlisted and officer grades, excluding those of general officers. A cadet starts as a cadet <b>airman</b> basic, and is promoted {{as he or she}} completes each achievement. Unlike the regular armed forces, where it is possible to enter as either directly as a commissioned following completion of some form of officer training (service academy, college ROTC, or OCS/OTS, etc.), or enlist and eventually advance to non-commissioned officer or petty officer status, a CAP cadet must be promoted through every CAP cadet enlisted grade in order to achieve the rank of CAP cadet second lieutenant. To complete an achievement, a cadet must pass a physical fitness test as well as two written tests, one for leadership and one for aerospace education. The only exceptions to this rule are the promotions to cadet <b>airman</b> and cadet staff sergeant, which have no aerospace test. For some achievements, an additional test of drill proficiency is required. In the new promotion system, effective as of 2010, there is a drill test for all CAP cadet enlisted grades.|$|E
5000|$|Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian (2009) {{features}} the Tuskegee <b>Airmen.</b> One of the <b>Airmen,</b> played by Keith Powell, narrates the group's activities in a stentorian voice ("The Tuskegee <b>Airmen</b> {{are on the}} march once again!"). Another one of the <b>Airmen</b> (Craig Robinson) says to Amelia Earhart (Amy Adams), [...] "A lot of people didn't think we could fly, either ... thanks for clearing the runway for us." ...|$|R
25|$|The Enemy Airmen's Act {{contributed to}} the deaths of {{hundreds}} of Allied <b>airmen</b> throughout the Pacific War. An estimated 132 Allied <b>airmen</b> shot down during the bombing campaign against Japan in 1944–1945 were summarily executed after short kangaroo trials or drumhead courts-martial. Imperial Japanese military personnel deliberately killed 33 American <b>airmen</b> at Fukuoka, including fifteen who were beheaded shortly after the Japanese Government's intention to surrender was announced on August 15, 1945. Mobs of civilians also killed several Allied <b>airmen</b> before the Japanese military arrived to take the <b>airmen</b> into custody. Another 94 <b>airmen</b> died from other causes while in Japanese custody, including 52 who were killed when they were deliberately abandoned in a prison during the bombing of Tokyo on May 24–25, 1945.|$|R

5|$|Developing a {{love for}} motor vehicles, motor cycles and flying as a teenager, Lock joined the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve as an AC2 <b>Airman</b> u/t Pilot (No. 745051) on 17 February 1939, and was {{promoted}} to Sergeant the following day. He undertook his initial peacetime training mostly on weekends and some week nights with 28 Elementary and Reserve Flying Training School (No. 28 E) run by the company 'Reid & Sigrist' at Meir, outside Stoke-on-Trent and made his first solo flight within the month.|$|E
5|$|Each {{milestone}} {{award in}} the Civil Air Patrol confers upon a cadet various benefits. Upon earning the Mitchell Award and the grade of cadet second lieutenant, a cadet {{is eligible for}} promotion the rank of <b>airman</b> first class (E-3) upon enlistment in the United States Air Force. A cadet earning the Earhart Award and being promoted to C/Capt and, if age 17 or older, may be selected to attend the International Air Cadet Exchange.|$|E
5|$|Hartmann {{said the}} German pilots {{themselves}} still learned from their enemy. Oil freezing in the DB 605 engines of the Bf109G-6s made them difficult {{to start in}} the extreme cold of the Russian winter. A captured Soviet <b>airman</b> showed them how pouring fuel into the aircraft's oil sump would thaw the oil and enable the engine to start on the first try. Another solution, also learned from the Soviets, was to ignite fuel under the engine.|$|E

5|$|In January 2015, Stone started {{education}} at the <b>Airman</b> Leadership School {{to learn how to}} be a non-commissioned officer and lead others. Stone announced in December 2015 that he will be leaving the United States Air Force in November 2016 after meeting with U.S. Ambassador to France Jane D. Hartley further piqued his interest in international relations. He plans on pursuing a degree in international relations at the University of California, Los Angeles or the University of Southern California.|$|E
5|$|Southern Rhodesian pilots {{played a}} part in the siege of Malta during 1942. John Plagis, a Rhodesian <b>airman</b> of Greek ancestry, joined the {{multinational}} group of Allied airmen defending the strategically important island in late March and on 1 April achieved four aerial victories in an afternoon, thereby becoming the siege's first Spitfire flying ace. By the time of his withdrawal in July he had been awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross twice. The British finally delivered vital supplies to Malta on 15 August with Operation Pedestal.|$|E
5|$|Training Check <b>Airman</b> Captain Dennis E. Fitch, 46, {{was hired}} by United Airlines in 1968.

50|$|Starting in March 2015, BMT was altered, {{graduation}} {{occurs during}} the seventh week, and the weekend after graduation, the new <b>Airmen</b> are {{moved to the}} Airman's Week dorms generally into a dorm with people going to the same Technical Training bases as themselves. During this week, <b>Airmen</b> participate in classes and activities designed to help them become more independent thinkers, and to make them aware {{of some of the}} problems facing young <b>Airmen</b> in both Tech Training and beyond, including mental, academic and social stresses that often affect new <b>Airmen.</b> During this week, <b>Airmen</b> are granted more freedoms, to include base liberties after duty hours, and a more relaxed dining facility, with <b>Airmen</b> no longer being required to march, and are now allowed to talk to each other, and classroom sessions are mixed gender.|$|R

5|$|For the Royal Air Force, Proud had caves {{dug into}} the sides of a wadi to hide two of the Hurricanes. The third was hidden in a hole beside the runway, the same shape as the {{aircraft}}, and covered by a lid and some tents. Dummy aircraft and hangars were constructed to draw fire; these were marked as real on marked-up air photographs captured with a Luftwaffe <b>airman.</b> The aircraft all survived the siege, important both for air defence and for maintaining {{the morale of the}} defending troops.|$|E
5|$|Haynes and {{his wife}} toured the American West after his retirement, indulging {{themselves}} while searching for a permanent residence. Some of the general's friends suggested Wichita Falls, the city of his last military post, but he left to assess the possibility of living in Taos, New Mexico, {{where he and his}} <b>airman</b> son hiked and explored ancient human settlements. Deciding against Taos, Haynes {{and his wife}} continued in their tour, soon finding Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, to their liking. There, he bought two adjoining lots on North Carmelo Street with one existing house. Rather than accepting any of the offers he received promising an executive career in the aeronautics industry, he relaxed by hunting and fishing.|$|E
