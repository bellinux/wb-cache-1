These adaptations include long, sticky tongues to capture ants and strong claws to break into ant nests. Brown bears (Ursus arctos) {{have been found to}} feed on ants. About 12%, 16%, and 4% of their faecal volume in spring, summer, and autumn, respectively, is composed of ants.|$|E
5|$|A scapula (shoulder blade), only {{tentatively}} {{assigned to}} Plesiorycteropus, has the acromion, a process, present, but {{the structure is}} probably not as large as in <b>aardvarks</b> or armadillos. Six humeri have been found; the bone is robust and an entepicondylar foramen {{is present in the}} distal (far) end. There are three examples of the radius, a compact and massive bone in Plesiorycteropus which resembles the pangolin radius. The three known ulnae show that the olecranon process at the proximal (near) end is well-developed, but the distal end is narrow; the morphology of the bone suggests that the animal was capable of producing much force with its arms.|$|E
5|$|Female {{marsupials}} have paired uteri and cervices. Most eutherian (placental) mammal {{species have}} a single cervix and single, bipartite or bicornuate uterus. Lagomorphs, rodents, <b>aardvarks</b> and hyraxes have a duplex uterus and two cervices. Lagomorphs and rodents share many morphological characteristics and are grouped together in the clade Glires. Anteaters of the family myrmecophagidae are unusual in that they lack a defined cervix; they {{are thought to have}} lost the characteristic rather than other mammals developing a cervix on more than one lineage.|$|E

5|$|Plesiorycteropus, {{also known}} as the bibymalagasy or Malagasy aardvark, is a {{recently}} extinct eutherian mammalian genus from Madagascar. Upon its description in 1895, it was classified with the aardvark, but more recent studies have found little evidence to link it to <b>aardvarks</b> or any other order of mammals. Molecular evidence instead suggests that it is related to the tenrecs. Two species are currently recognized, the larger P.madagascariensis and the smaller P.germainepetterae. They probably overlapped in distribution, as subfossil remains of both species have been found in the same site.|$|E
5|$|The robust nasal bones, {{preserved}} {{in a single}} specimen, are widest at the front, a feature unusual among placentals that is also seen in armadillos, and are also unusually flat. The ethmoid labyrinth, in the nasal cavity, was large, suggesting that Plesiorycteropus had {{a good sense of}} smell. A much larger part of the nasal septum, which separates the left and right nasal cavities, is ossified than usual in other mammals; MacPhee could find a similar condition only in sloths, which have a very short nose. The lacrimal bone is relatively large. At it is a single lacrimal canal, which opens near the suture between the frontal and lacrimal bones, like in lipotyphlans. There is a small tubercle (absent in <b>aardvarks)</b> near this opening. The orbital cavity, which houses the eyes, is relatively short, similar to the situation in pangolins and armadillos. A distinct tubercle is present on the suture between the frontal and parietal bones in P.germainepetterae, but not P.madagascariensis. P.madagascariensis has a more expansive braincase and a less pronounced narrowing between the orbits. The foramen rotundum, an opening in the bone of the orbit, is present. The optic canal, which houses the nerves leading to the eyes, is narrow, suggesting that the eyes were small, similar to many other tenrecoids. As in pangolins and xenarthrans, little of the squamosal bone can be seen from above. The temporal lines on the braincase, which anchor muscles, are located lower in P.germainepetterae. Like in <b>aardvarks,</b> the parietals are relatively large. An interparietal bone is present. Unlike in anteaters and pangolins, the occiput (the back of the skull) is flat and vertical. Plesiorycteropus lacks notches above the foramen magnum (the opening that connects the brain to the spinal cord), which are present in <b>aardvarks.</b> The nuchal crest, a projection on the occiput, is straight in P.madagascariensis, but in P.germainepetterae it is interrupted in the middle, similar to the situation in armadillos and hyraxes.|$|E
5|$|Reviewing Patterson's and Thewissen's {{contributions}} in 1994, Ross MacPhee found little {{support for the}} classification of Plesiorycteropus as a tubulidentate in their data. MacPhee used a cladistic analysis of eutherians to ascertain the relationships of the genus, but found that while different analytic variants supported different affinities—with <b>aardvarks,</b> hyraxes, ungulates (hooved mammals), and even lipotyphlans (shrews, moles, hedgehogs, and allies)—there was no compelling evidence linking it to any other eutherian group. Therefore, he erected a separate order for Plesiorycteropus, named Bibymalagasia, arguing {{that it would be}} unacceptable to leave a Recent eutherian unassigned to any order and that discovery of more material, or further analysis, was unlikely to demonstrate close affinities of Plesiorycteropus with any other order. He considered it possible but unlikely that a few fossil taxa, such as Palaeorycteropus and Leptomanis from the Paleogene of France, would eventually be found to be bibymalagasians. Various analyses published by Robert Asher and colleagues in 2003, 2005, and 2007, based on morphology combined with DNA sequence data in some analyses, produced different estimates of the relationships of Plesiorycteropus, some placing it within Afrotheria close to <b>aardvarks</b> or Afrosoricida, but others supporting a relationship with the hedgehog Erinaceus. A 2004 morphological study by Inés Horovitz, focusing on extinct South American ungulates (such as Notoungulata and Litopterna), placed Plesiorycteropus among tubulidentates and closer to the extinct aardvark relative Myorycteropus than to Orycteropus. A 2013 study by Michael Buckley examined preserved collagen sequences in Plesiorycteropus bones. Buckley found that the animal was closely related to the tenrecs, a group of insectivorous mammals native to Madagascar, and suggested that it should be placed in the order Tenrecoidea with the tenrecs and golden moles.|$|E

25|$|Operation Phou Phiang II (6 August – 25 October 1972) {{was one of}} {{the final}} battles of the Laotian Civil War.

A new radar bombing program by F-111 <b>Aardvarks</b> and B-52 Stratofortresses failed to cripple the Communist forces.

500|$|Filhol had {{classified}} Plesiorycteropus {{as close}} to the aardvark on the basis of morphological similarities. In his 1946 review, Charles Lamberton was unable to provide a definitive allocation, confused by the various similarities he saw with <b>aardvarks,</b> pangolins, armadillos, and anteaters. He believed it was most likely a primitive, isolated member of [...] "Edentata", a group in which he included <b>aardvarks,</b> pangolins, and Xenarthra (sloths, armadillos, and anteaters). He rejected some alternatives, such as a close affinity to <b>aardvarks</b> or the possibility that the material assigned to Plesiorycteropus did not in fact represent a single animal. Bryan Patterson, who revised tubulidentates (the order of which the aardvark is the only living representative) in the 1970s, accepted Plesiorycteropus {{as a member of the}} group, dismissing many similarities with pangolins and other animals as convergent. However, he placed it as the only member of its own subfamily Plesiorycteropodinae in view of its differences from other tubulidentates (subfamily Orycteropodinae), and hypothesized that it arrived on Madagascar in the Eocene, at the same time as the lemurs. Johannes Thewissen, who critiqued some aspects of Patterson's classification in 1985, also accepted Plesiorycteropus as a tubulidentate without comment.|$|E

As such, it may represent a transitional stage in the evolution of paenungulates from insectivore-like mammals.
