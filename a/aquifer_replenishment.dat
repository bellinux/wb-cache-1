Study focusThe North {{district of}} Delhi has mostly shallow water levels {{and is a}} groundwater surplus region {{in contrast to the}} over-exploited aquifers of the region. The surface runoff and flood waters during monsoon season in the district either causes water logging in lower elevation areas or they join drains and rivers as rejected recharge. This study aims to understand groundwater dynamics of the region in perspective of the aquifer architecture and proposes groundwater management options to meet local water requirements. New hydrological insights in the regionThree distinct hydrogeological domains are identified with subtle differences in groundwater occurrence. Insights are obtained in stream–aquifer interaction and baseflow to the Yamuna River is quantified. The salinity enrichment in groundwater has been attributed to water logging in clay rich formations under semi arid condition. The viability of limited dewatering of shallow <b>aquifers</b> and its <b>replenishment</b> by enhanced recharge from surface runoff and flood waters during the monsoon period have been established...|$|R
40|$|This is an author's peer-reviewed final manuscript, as {{accepted}} by the publisher. The published article is copyrighted by the American Society of Civil Engineers {{and can be found}} at: [URL] percolation can be an important source of shallow <b>aquifer</b> <b>replenishment</b> in arid regions of the southwestern United States. Aquifer recharge derived from irrigation percolation can be more significant in fluvial valleys overlying shallow aquifers where highly permeable soils allow rapid water infiltration and <b>aquifer</b> <b>replenishment.</b> We used data from various irrigation experiments and piezometric level data to assess irrigation percolation effects on recharge of a shallow aquifer in an agricultural valley of northern New Mexico. The water balance method (WBM) and the water table fluctuation method (WTFM) were used for estimating aquifer recharge at the field scale (< 1 ha) and the WTFM was used for determining recharge at the entire valley scale (40 km²). Also, the temporal and spatial distribution of aquifer response to irrigation percolation and canal seepage inputs was characterized. Results showed that for separate irrigation events at the field scale, aquifer recharge values ranged from 0 to 369 mm when using the WBM and from 0 to 230 mm when using the WTFM. For the cumulative irrigation season at the valley scale, recharge ranged from 1044 to 1350 mm yr⁻¹. A relatively rapid water table response with sharp water table rises and declines was observed in all but dryland location wells in response to canal seepage and irrigation percolation inputs. Results of this study add {{to the understanding of the}} mechanisms of shallow aquifer recharge and the interactions between surface water and groundwater in a floodplain agricultural valley of northern New Mexico...|$|E

40|$|The {{advancement}} of seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers using three-dimensional variable density transport models is examined. The fluid flow and mass transport processes are considered {{and the resulting}} differential equations are solved numerically using finite element method. A constraint based boundary condition regarding chloride concentration is imposed on the seaside boundary. The numerical models are applied to an unconfined aquifer located in {{the central part of}} Thira Island (Santorini). Several scenarios are examined corresponding to steady-state and time-dependent conditions. Two potential cases of <b>aquifer</b> <b>replenishment,</b> with natural and artificial recharge are also simulated. The results demonstrate significant dependence of the {{advancement of}} seawater intrusion on the initial and boundary conditions prevailing on the seaside boundary of the aquifer. The transition zone predicted by variable density flow and transport models is of considerable width indicating the necessity for modelling using advanced three-dimensional variable density transport models. © 2008 Elsevier B.

40|$|What is {{the import}} of California’s Sustainable Groundwater Management Act of 2014 (“SGMA”) ? It is {{acknowledgement}} that groundwater consumption is drastically outpacing <b>aquifer</b> <b>replenishment</b> and that new tools are necessary to resolve this issue. However, there is justifiable concern that the SGMA is ill-equipped to tackle sustainable groundwater management. Additionally, {{the timing of the}} SGMA’s adoption raises questions as to the Legislature’s motives, especially when it has remained silent {{for more than a century}} with respect to groundwater conservation. While the problem appears to be a tragedy of the groundwater commons (potentially remedied by market-based incentives and/or collective action), it is in fact much more complicated. As this paper argues, the problem is rooted in the interplay between the over-allocation of Constitutionally protected groundwater use rights, the American common law system and its independent regimes for surface water and groundwater resources (despite hydrogeological interconnectedness), the legislative process, severe climate-induced drought, and a significant lag between technological advancement and legal precedent. Only through state powers like eminent domain (by reacquiring and redistributing use rights) can the state prevent unbridled groundwater extraction...|$|E
40|$|After the {{hydrological}} pyrotechnics of last year, runoff {{patterns were}} more subdued {{through the first}} half of 2013, but temperatures were seasonally very unusual: an exceptionally hot July followed a notably cool spring. River flows and <b>aquifer</b> <b>replenishment</b> were generally within the normal range through the spring and early summer and overall water resources remained healthy. However, the persistence of high pressure during most of July — with an associated prolonged heatwave — changed the complexion of the landscape and the arid conditions triggered sustained river flow recessions. By mid-July heat stress had become a significant health issue, the parched soils were impacting on agriculture and fire risk in the countryside had increased markedly; there was also significant ecological stress as headwater streams dried up. Although, overall reservoir stocks, and groundwater resources, remained well within the normal summer range, heatwave-related surges in water demand stretched water treatment and distribution capacities. Late July witnessed a further transformation: heavy rainfall and intense thunderstorms terminated lengthy sequences of rainless days in most areas, disruptive flash flood events were very common and, approaching month-end, flood alerts were widespread across northern Britai...|$|E
40|$|Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) endotoxin, a {{bacterial}} byproduct abundantly present in wastewater, {{is more and}} more representing a major concern in wastewater treatment sector for the potential health risk it represents. It is, therefore, more urgent than before to protect consumers from contaminating their fresh potable water reserves with LPS endotoxin through <b>aquifer</b> <b>replenishment</b> using reclaimed wastewater or by supplying reclaimed wastewater as potable water. Membrane treatment is an alternative to activated sludge process and is the most commonly used to treat wastewater. Moreover, nano-filtration and reverse osmosis are the most advanced technologies used to treat wastewater to a potable level. Removal efficiency of LPS endotoxin using Membrane bioreactors (MBRs) and Nanofiltration (NF) and Reverse Osmosis (RO) is subject of this paper. It revealed that these advanced technologies could remove a significant amount of endotoxin. However, levels of concentration in the product water are still much higher than the one found in tap water and it is not advisable to supply this water directly to consumers. Further investigations are required to determine the best management practices for a safe supply of potable water from reclaimed wastewater...|$|E
40|$|Groundwater {{resources}} in the San Lorenzo River Basin (SLRB) {{are in a state}} of chronic overdraft, requiring well-informed mitigation measures. Distributed Stormwater Collection-Managed Aquifer Recharge (DSC-MAR) presents a cost-effective method of <b>aquifer</b> <b>replenishment</b> by collecting runoff and infiltrating it as recharge, but its successful implementation demands thorough knowledge of the distribution and availability of hillslope runoff. We apply a surface hydrology model to analyze the dynamics of hillslope runoff at high resolution (0. 1 to 1. 0 km 2) across the 350 km 2 SLRB watershed. We used a 3 m digital elevation model to create a detailed model grid, which we parameterized with high-resolution geologic, hydrologic, and land use data. To analyze hillslope runoff under a range of conditions, we developed a catalog of dry, normal, and wet climate scenarios from the historic record. Simulation results show high spatial variability of hillslope runoff, and indicate opportunities for runoff as potential supply for MAR during all climate scenarios. Additionally, our results reveal a consistent increase in the spatial and temporal variability of runoff under a wet climate scenario. The simulation's high-resolution output enables quantification of hillslope runoff at sub-watershed scales, commensurate with DSC-MAR catchments, demonstrating this method as a viable tool for MAR decision making and site planning...|$|E
40|$|Ephemeral streamflow {{infiltration}} through alluvial channels {{has been}} identified as an important source of <b>aquifer</b> <b>replenishment</b> in arid and semi-arid environments. In this dissertation, two field methods were developed for monitoring streamflow timing in ephemeral stream channels. The first streamflow timing method exploits differences in the advective and conductive thermal transport mechanisms during the presence and absence of streamflow. The second method of streamflow timing utilized the relationship between soil water content and electrical conductance. Electrical resistance sensors were designed to detect saturated soil conditions and thus to infer streamflow timing during periods of saturation. Both methods were field-tested in Rillito Creek, Tucson, Arizona. The electrical resistance method proved more suitable than the temperature method because it was not depth dependent and was able to more accurately infer streamflow timing with less data post processing. Transient and steady state infiltration fluxes were simulated in a coarse-grained alluvial channel to determine the relative contribution the onset of streamflow provides to potential recharge. Water content, temperature, and pore pressure measurements were incorporated into a variably saturated heat and fluid transport model to simulate infiltration. Infiltration fluxes at the onset of streamflow were about 2 - 3 orders of magnitude higher than steady state fluxes and were inversely proportional to antecedent water content. The time duration from the onset of streamflow to steady-state infiltration ranged from 1. 8 to 20 hours. Two transient and steady state periods were observed indicating a lower permeable layer at depth. During steady state periods, infiltration fluxes averaged 0. 33 meters per day and ranged from 0. 14 to 0. 45 meters per day. A long-term decline was observed in all three events. Higher frequency diurnal and episodic changes were prompted by fluctuations in atmospheric temperature and discharge. The simulated steady state values were consistent with the effective vertical conductivity values (0. 22 meters per day) of an underlying less permeable layer. The average contribution from the cumulative transient infiltration for the events was approximately 18 percent. Therefore, it is apparent that potential recharge calculations for alluvial channels that do not consider infiltration during the onset transient period may underestimate the true potential for recharge...|$|E
40|$|The Apuan Alps, in Northern Tuscany, are a mainly calcareous-metamorphic range where {{quarrying}} {{is particularly}} extensive, {{due to the}} abundance, quality and beauty of the marble (the Carrara marble is of worldwide renown). In this mountain range geological heritages, or geosites, are widely represented. These include surface and underground karst features, features of Quaternary glaciations and also the particular alpine-type morphology (sharp peaks, steep slopes, deeply cut valleys). Signs of the age-old quarrying activities are also evident. Among these, the accumulation of rock fragments in quarry dumps - locally named ravaneti - {{is typical of the}} Apuan Alps and is one of its most important characteristics. The ravaneti result from marble excavation and cover a large surface area of quarried zones. They are the result of an extensive quarrying method, with extensive use of mines, now obsolete and replaced by more up-to-date techniques. At present the ravaneti are taken into consideration from two opposing points of view, that is their environmental and economic-productive relevance. However, both viewpoints must find an accordance with each other. Indeed, over the last few years, these quarry dumps have been increasingly used as a source of inert materials and calcium carbonate, without any planning or regulation. By contrast, the environmental value of the ravaneti is scarcely taken into consideration, even though they have {{become an integral part of}} the Apuan landscape: their whiteness seen in the distance makes the mountainous massif even more particular. Moreover, the ravaneti, which resulted from ancient quarrying techniques, are an important indication of past extractive activity. They sometimes still show traces of quarrying work (e. g. the vie di lizza - rocky chutes once used by quarry workers for sliding marble blocks downslope -, the fragment retaining constructions and the ramps going up to the quarries). They are therefore important features of local industrial archaeology. Finally, the quarry dumps are very large and very pervious. They therefore slow down the rainwater concentration in the watercourses, thereby helping to protect inhabited centres against floods and contributing to <b>aquifer</b> <b>replenishment.</b> This is an important fact in favour of maintenance of the ravaneti. The present market trends lead to the fear that the intensive re-utilization of the ravaneti may become uncontrolled. This has certainly been the case of the indiscriminate quarrying activity in the Apuan Alps over the centuries. We believe it is essential to promote as soon as possible a series of studies, to determine which ravaneti deserve protection from indiscriminate re-utilization. Any selection criteria, based on thematic maps and project files, should consider classification parameters, including: scenic significance, morphology, characteristics of plant adaptation, historical and anthropic value. Even if the introduction of regulatory measures restrict the exploitation of a certain number of ravaneti, millions and millions tons of rock fragments will remain for market use. Moreover, such protective action will raise the tourist value of the area. In conclusion, no damage to the economy of the Apuan district is expected from the adoption of a rational policy for safeguarding the environment...|$|E
