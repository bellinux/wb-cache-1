5|$|If {{a viable}} hybrid embryo is {{obtained}} via gene editing procedures, {{it may be}} possible to implant it into a female <b>Asian</b> <b>elephant</b> housed in a zoo, but with the current knowledge and technology, it is unknown if the hybrid embryo would be carried through the two-year gestation.|$|E
5|$|Elephants {{are large}} mammals {{of the family}} Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea. Three species are {{currently}} recognized: the African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana), the African forest elephant (L. cyclotis), and the <b>Asian</b> <b>elephant</b> (Elephas maximus). Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Elephantidae is the only surviving family of the order Proboscidea; other, now extinct, members of the order include deinotheres, gomphotheres, mammoths, and mastodons.|$|E
5000|$|The goal of World Elephant Day is {{to create}} {{awareness}} of the urgent plight of African and <b>Asian</b> <b>elephants,</b> and to share knowledge and positive solutions for the better care and management of captive and wild elephants. African elephants are listed as [...] "Vulnerable" [...] and <b>Asian</b> <b>elephants</b> as [...] "Endangered" [...] on the IUCN Red List of threatened species. One conservationist has stated that both African and <b>Asian</b> <b>elephants</b> face extinction within twelve years. [...] The current population estimates are about 400,000 for African elephants and 40,000 for <b>Asian</b> <b>elephants,</b> {{although it has been}} argued that these numbers are much too high.|$|R
50|$|Other {{evidence}} of vocal learning in elephants {{occurred in a}} cross-fostering situation with a captive African elephant. At the Basel Zoo in Switzerland, Calimero, a male African elephant, was kept with two female <b>Asian</b> <b>elephants.</b> Recordings of his cries shows {{evidence of}} chirping noises, typically only produced by <b>Asian</b> <b>elephants.</b> The duration and frequency of these calls differs from recorded instances of chirping calls from other African elephants and more closely resembles the chirping calls of <b>Asian</b> <b>elephants.</b>|$|R

5|$|Elephants exhibit mirror self-recognition, an {{indication}} of self-awareness and cognition that has also been demonstrated in some apes and dolphins. One study of a captive female <b>Asian</b> <b>elephant</b> suggested the animal was capable of learning and distinguishing between several visual and some acoustic discrimination pairs. This individual was even able to score a high accuracy rating when re-tested with the same visual pairs a year later. Elephants are among the species known to use tools. An <b>Asian</b> <b>elephant</b> has been observed modifying branches and using them as flyswatters. Tool modification by these animals is not as advanced as that of chimpanzees. Elephants are popularly thought of as having an excellent memory. This could have a factual basis; they possibly have cognitive maps {{to allow them to}} remember large-scale spaces over long periods of time. Individuals appear {{to be able to keep}} track of the current location of their family members.|$|E
5|$|Play {{behaviour}} in calves differs {{between the}} sexes; females run or chase {{each other while}} males play-fight. The former are sexually mature {{by the age of}} nine years while the latter become mature around 14–15 years. Adulthood starts at about 18 years of age in both sexes. Elephants have long lifespans, reaching 60–70 years of age. Lin Wang, a captive male <b>Asian</b> <b>elephant,</b> lived for 86 years.|$|E
5|$|The British Alpine Hannibal Expedition was an {{experimental}} archeology event {{that took place}} in 1959. British engineer John Hoyte led an expedition that tried to reenact aspects of Hannibal's legendary crossing of the Alps during the Second Punic War in 218 BCE. The group successfully took the female <b>Asian</b> <b>elephant</b> Jumbo, provided by a zoo in Turin, from France over the Col du Mont Cenis into Italy.|$|E

5|$|The 2010 {{wildlife}} survey counted 12 Bengal tigers. In December 2011, the Conservator of Forests of Tamil Nadu {{stated that}} the sanctuary is home to at least 28 tigers as confirmed by a camera trap study conducted by World Wildlife Fund. In the 2012 national wildlife survey, 25 tigers were recorded. As per the 2011 census, the Sathyamangalam forests was home to over 850 Indian elephants and {{is part of a}} protected area, which consists of the largest <b>Asian</b> <b>elephant</b> population in the world.|$|E
5|$|The Phoenix Zoo {{garnered}} worldwide {{attention for}} one of its animals, an <b>Asian</b> <b>elephant</b> named Ruby. Ruby came to the zoo in 1973, just months after being born in Thailand. After noticing Ruby doodling in the sand with sticks, her keeper decided {{to give her a}} brush and paint. Ruby quickly became known for her paintings, whose sales raised over US$200,000 for the zoo. Art collectors all over the world joined 18-month waiting lists and paid hundreds of dollars for original prints.|$|E
5|$|A second method {{involves}} artificially inseminating {{an elephant}} egg cell with sperm cells from a frozen woolly mammoth carcass. The resulting offspring {{would be an}} elephant–mammoth hybrid, and the process {{would have to be}} repeated so more hybrids could be used in breeding. After several generations of cross-breeding these hybrids, an almost pure woolly mammoth would be produced. The fact that sperm cells of modern mammals are viable for 15 years at most after deep-freezing is a hindrance to this method. In one case, an <b>Asian</b> <b>elephant</b> and an African elephant produced a live calf named Motty, but it died of defects at less than two weeks old.|$|E

5|$|African {{elephants}} {{are listed}} as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) while the <b>Asian</b> <b>elephant</b> is classed as endangered. One of the biggest threats to elephant populations is the ivory trade, as the animals are poached for their ivory tusks. Other threats to wild elephants include habitat destruction and conflicts with local people. Elephants are used as working animals in Asia. In the past, they were used in war; today, they are often controversially put on display in zoos, or exploited for entertainment in circuses. Elephants are highly recognisable and have been featured in art, folklore, religion, literature, and popular culture.|$|E
5|$|EEHV1A (originally just {{known as}} EEHV1) {{was the first}} species/type identified, which causes an acute hemorrhagic disease with a very high {{mortality}} rate in Asian elephants. This form of the virus was originally believed to occur naturally in African elephants (occasionally producing skin nodules), and to be transmitted to Asian elephants within captivity, but more extensive studies have since largely disproved this concept because several other species/types of EEHV (e.g. EEHV2, EEHV3 and EEHV6) instead {{have been identified in}} African elephants. A second lethal subtype, EEHV1B, was identified in Asian elephants in 2001. EEHV3, EEHV4 and EEHV5 have also each been {{responsible for the deaths of}} at least one <b>Asian</b> <b>elephant</b> calf.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, the IUCN {{listed the}} <b>Asian</b> <b>elephant</b> as {{endangered}} {{due to a}} 50% population decline over the past 60–75 years while CITES lists the species under Appendix I. Asian elephants once ranged from Syria and Iraq (the subspecies Elephas maximus asurus), to China (up to the Yellow River) and Java. It is now extinct in these areas, and the current range of Asian elephants is highly fragmented. The total population of Asian elephants {{is estimated to be}} around 40,000–50,000, although this may be a loose estimate. It is likely that around half of the population is in India. Although Asian elephants are declining in numbers overall, particularly in Southeast Asia, the population in the Western Ghats appears to be increasing.|$|E

5|$|Other {{threats to}} {{elephants}} include habitat destruction and fragmentation. The <b>Asian</b> <b>elephant</b> lives {{in areas with}} some of the highest human populations. Because they need larger amounts of land than other sympatric terrestrial mammals, they are the first to be affected by human encroachment. In extreme cases, elephants may be confined to small islands of forest among human-dominated landscapes. Elephants cannot coexist with humans in agricultural areas due to their size and food requirements. Elephants commonly trample and consume crops, which contributes to conflicts with humans, and both elephants and humans have died by the hundreds as a result. Mitigating these conflicts is important for conservation. One proposed solution is the provision of ‘urban corridors’ which allow the animals access to key areas.|$|E
5|$|The Columbian mammoth (Mammuthus columbi) is an {{extinct species}} of mammoth that {{inhabited}} North America {{as far north}} as the northern United States and as far south as Costa Rica during the Pleistocene epoch. It {{was one of the last}} in a line of mammoth species, beginning with M. subplanifrons in the early Pliocene. The Columbian mammoth evolved from the steppe mammoth, which entered North America from Asia about 1.5 million years ago. The pygmy mammoths of the Channel Islands of California evolved from Columbian mammoths. The closest extant relative of the Columbian and other mammoths is the <b>Asian</b> <b>elephant.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{first case}} of a fatal form of the disease was {{documented}} in 1995, though tissue samples from {{as early as the}} 1980s have since tested positive for the virus, and localized skin lesions in wild African elephants were recorded in the 1970s. Since 1995, there have been over fifty documented disease cases in North America and Europe, of which only nine have been successfully cured. Those affected are mostly young animals born in captivity, though a small number of older wild-born adults held in zoos have died, and a number of cases caused by the same pathogenic type of EEHV have been identified in both orphan and wild calves in <b>Asian</b> <b>elephant</b> populations.|$|E

Other attractions include elephant and pony rides, a petting zoo, a large wet-play area, a playground, a discovery centre and multiple food and souvenir shops.|$|R
5|$|The African {{elephant}} has two finger-like extensions {{at the tip}} of {{the trunk}} that allow it to grasp and bring food to its mouth. The <b>Asian</b> <b>elephant</b> has only one, and relies more on wrapping around a food item and squeezing it into its mouth. Asian elephants have more muscle coordination and can perform more complex tasks. Losing the trunk would be detrimental to an elephant's survival, although in rare cases, individuals have survived with shortened ones. One elephant has been observed to graze by kneeling on its front legs, raising on its hind legs and taking in grass with its lips. Floppy trunk syndrome is a condition of trunk paralysis in African bush elephants caused by the degradation of the peripheral nerves and muscles beginning at the tip.|$|E
5|$|The {{woolly mammoth}} (Mammuthus primigenius) is an extinct species of mammoth that lived during the Pleistocene epoch, {{and was one}} of the last in a line of mammoth species, {{beginning}} with Mammuthus subplanifrons in the early Pliocene. The woolly mammoth diverged from the steppe mammoth about 400,000 years ago in East Asia. Its closest extant relative is the <b>Asian</b> <b>elephant.</b> The appearance and behaviour of this species are among the best studied of any prehistoric animal because of the discovery of frozen carcasses in Siberia and Alaska, as well as skeletons, teeth, stomach contents, dung, and depiction from life in prehistoric cave paintings. Mammoth remains had long been known in Asia before they became known to Europeans in the 17th century. The origin of these remains was long a matter of debate, and often explained as being remains of legendary creatures. The mammoth was identified as an extinct species of elephant by Georges Cuvier in 1796.|$|E
5|$|The {{virus has}} been {{identified}} in the pulmonary nodules of African elephants {{as far back as}} the 1970s. The first recognised fatal case of EEHV in an <b>Asian</b> <b>elephant</b> was identified at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., in 1995; testing on stored tissue samples was able to identify a number of earlier deaths as being due to the same virus. These cases have so far been identified as early as 1983. Since this date, there have been a total of 54 more cases in North America and Europe, nine of which were successfully treated. The May 2009 deaths of two calves at Whipsnade Zoo were not included in this calculation. This gives a fatality rate of over 80% among known symptomatic disease cases. In cases where antiviral medication was applied, treatment was effective in about one in three cases. As of 2005, there were twelve cases where famciclovir had been used, eight of which were fatal. As a fraction of the overall population, it has been calculated that of the 78 Asian elephants born in captivity in North America between 1978 and 2007, 19 are known to have died of EEHV, and five more were successfully treated with antiviral medication.|$|E
