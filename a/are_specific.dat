5|$|Although {{meteorological}} surveys alert about hurricanes {{or severe}} storms, {{in the areas}} where the risk of coastal flooding is particularly high, there <b>are</b> <b>specific</b> storm surge warnings. These have been implemented, for instance, in the Netherlands, Spain, the United States, and the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|There <b>are</b> <b>specific</b> {{proteins}} {{expressed in}} cardiac muscle cells. These are mostly associated with muscle contraction, and bind with actin, myosin, tropomyosin, and troponin. They include MYH6, ACTC1, TNNI3, CDH2 and PKP2. Other proteins expressed are MYH7 and LDB3 {{that are also}} expressed in skeletal muscle.|$|E

50|$|Recently the phylogenetic {{relationship}} of the group Thermotogae was characterized based on the CSI approach. Previously no biochemical or molecular markers were known that could clearly distinguish the species of this phylum from all other bacteria. More than 60 CSIs that <b>were</b> <b>specific</b> for the entire Thermotogae phylum or its different subgroups were discovered. 18 CSIs are uniquely present in various Thermotogae species and provide molecular markers for the phylum. Additionally there were many CSIs that <b>were</b> <b>specific</b> for various thermotogae subgroups. 12 CSIs <b>were</b> <b>specific</b> for a clade consisting of various Thermotoga species except Tt. Lettingae. 14CSIs <b>were</b> <b>specific</b> for a clade consisting of the Fervidobacterium and Thermosipho genera and 18 CSIs <b>were</b> <b>specific</b> for the genus Thermosiphon.|$|R
50|$|Erythrocyte {{antibody}} rosetting (EA-rosetting), {{occurs when}} an antibody molecule that <b>is</b> <b>specific</b> for an epitope on another cell {{is embedded in}} the membrane of a red blood cell and then reacted against a cell carrying the epitope that the antibody <b>is</b> <b>specific</b> for.|$|R
50|$|The host {{specificity}} of this parasite is uncertain. Either it <b>was</b> <b>specific</b> to the scimitar-horned oryx and became extinct during captive breeding of the host, or - alternatively - it may <b>be</b> <b>specific</b> to the addax and possibly still surviving in the wild.|$|R
5|$|Traditionally {{these terms}} <b>are</b> <b>specific</b> to certain {{geographical}} areas although {{some may be}} used by a particular social group such as pax in the UK, used primarily by children attending private schools. To be functional a truce term must be understood and honoured {{by most of the}} children playing together.|$|E
5|$|While {{some wild}} {{narcissi}} <b>are</b> <b>specific</b> {{in terms of}} their ecological requirements, most garden varieties are relatively tolerant of soil conditions, however very wet soils and clay soils may benefit from the addition of sand to improve drainage. The optimum soil is a neutral to slightly acid pH of 6.5–7.0.|$|E
5|$|Whitney High School fields eleven boys' {{sports teams}} and twelve girls' sports teams. Nearly all sports have teams of both genders, {{although}} exceptions do exist: baseball and football <b>are</b> <b>specific</b> to males, while cheerleading, drill team, softball, and team tennis <b>are</b> <b>specific</b> to females. Whitney's sports teams {{participate in the}} Pioneer Valley League, which includes six other high schools in El Dorado County, Placer County, Nevada County, and Sacramento County. Whitney's football team won the Sac-Joaquin Section championships in 2008; they were runners-up to Oakdale High School the previous year and reached the championships again in 2009. Likewise, the girls' soccer team won the Sac-Joaquin Section championships in 2009. Nazir Rasooli was the champion of the 2009 Sac-Joaquin Section Wrestling Championship, {{and was the first}} Whitney wrestler to qualify for the State championship.|$|E

5|$|All {{students}} {{have the right to}} enter upper secondary education when they turn sixteen. Around 97% of students leaving lower secondary education enter into upper secondary education; however there is a notable drop-out rate. There <b>are</b> <b>specific</b> entry requirements for different courses, but as all {{students have}} the right to this sort of education, a general program of study is available for those students who may fail to meet requirements. Some schools enjoy more prestige and popularity than others, especially in Reykjavík, and those may need to turn away hundreds of students every year.|$|E
5|$|Baculoviruses <b>are</b> <b>specific</b> to {{individual}} insect host species {{and have been}} shown to be useful in biological pest control. For example, the Lymantria dispar multicapsid nuclear polyhedrosis virus has been used to spray large areas of forest in North America where larvae of the gypsy moth are causing serious defoliation. The moth larvae are killed by the virus they have eaten and die, the disintegrating cadavers leaving virus particles on the foliage to infect other larvae.|$|E
5|$|Diamond {{enhancements}} <b>are</b> <b>specific</b> treatments {{performed on}} natural or synthetic diamonds (usually those already cut and polished into a gem), which {{are designed to}} better the gemological characteristics of the stone {{in one or more}} ways. These include laser drilling to remove inclusions, application of sealants to fill cracks, treatments to improve a white diamond's color grade, and treatments to give fancy color to a white diamond.|$|E

5|$|Export is {{a special}} resource, only {{available}} to the three Asian civilizations, and is used to hire foreign troops and research technologies from the consulate, where the player can choose a foreign ally or, for the Japanese, isolationism. Export is generated automatically when the villagers are gathering, but its gather rate is much slower than other resources, making it challenging to afford a large foreign army. Export Rate / Experience points are also generated by other means (like sacred cows for Indians) and <b>are</b> <b>specific</b> to each clan.|$|E
5|$|IQ classifications for {{individuals}} also vary because category labels for IQ score ranges <b>are</b> <b>specific</b> to each brand of test. The test publishers {{do not have}} a uniform practice of labeling IQ score ranges, nor do they have a consistent practice of dividing up IQ score ranges into categories of the same size or with the same boundary scores. Thus psychologists should specify which test was given when reporting a test-taker's IQ. Psychologists and IQ test authors recommend that psychologists adopt the terminology of each test publisher when reporting IQ score ranges.|$|E
5|$|Most {{information}} about the carucage comes from the financial records associated with its collection, {{but there is no}} detailed description of the way it was collected or assessed, unlike the account of the workings of the Exchequer given in the Dialogue Concerning the Exchequer, written in about 1180. Government records such as the Pipe Rolls, the Memoranda Rolls, and other financial records, some of which <b>are</b> <b>specific</b> to the carucage, have survived, and include records of assessments and receipts for the sums collected. There are also occasional references to the tax in medieval chronicles, supplementing the information found in the financial records.|$|E

5|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} {{of the most common}} form of pancreatic cancer may include yellow skin, abdominal or back pain, unexplained weight loss, light-colored stools, dark urine and loss of appetite. There are usually no symptoms in the disease's early stages, {{and symptoms}} that <b>are</b> <b>specific</b> enough to suggest pancreatic cancer typically do not develop until the disease has reached an advanced stage. By the time of diagnosis, pancreatic cancer has often spread to other parts of the body.|$|E
5|$|Some poetry types <b>are</b> <b>specific</b> to {{particular}} cultures and genres {{and respond to}} characteristics of the language in which the poet writes. Readers accustomed to identifying poetry with Dante, Goethe, Mickiewicz and Rumi may {{think of it as}} written in lines based on rhyme and regular meter; there are, however, traditions, such as Biblical poetry, that use other means to create rhythm and euphony. Much modern poetry reflects a critique of poetic tradition, playing with and testing, among other things, the principle of euphony itself, sometimes altogether forgoing rhyme or set rhythm. In today's increasingly globalized world, poets often adapt forms, styles and techniques from diverse cultures and languages.|$|E
5|$|Steins;Gates {{gameplay}} requires little interaction {{from the}} player {{as most of}} the duration of the game is spent on reading the text that appears on the screen which represents either the dialogue between the various characters or the thoughts of the protagonist.

5|$|Super Mario Kart {{features}} eight playable {{characters from}} the Mario series – Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Yoshi, Bowser, Donkey Kong Jr., Koopa Troopa and Toad. Each character's kart has different capabilities with differing levels of top speed, acceleration and handling. Mario, Luigi, Peach, Yoshi, Bowser and Toad returned {{in all of}} the subsequent Mario Kart games starting with Mario Kart 64. During races, computer-controlled characters have special items, or superpowers, which they are able to use. These powers <b>are</b> <b>specific</b> to each character; for example, Yoshi drops eggs which cause players who hit them to lose coins and spin, while Donkey Kong Jr. throws bananas.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} {{is based on}} the combination of the symptoms, as very few other diseases cause the same symptoms together. Blood tests may show elevated creatinine and urea levels (in kidney involvement), raised IgA levels (in about 50%), and raised C-reactive protein (CRP) or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) results; none <b>are</b> <b>specific</b> for Henoch–Schönlein purpura. The platelet count may be raised, and distinguishes it from diseases where low platelets are the cause of the purpura, such as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of extraterrestrial intelligence would have various impacts on biology and astrobiology. The {{discovery of}} extraterrestrial life in any form, intelligent or non-intelligent, would give humanity greater {{insight into the}} nature of life on Earth and would improve the conception of how the tree of life is organized. Human biologists could learn about extraterrestrial biochemistry and observe how it differs from that found on Earth. This knowledge could help human civilization to learn which aspects of life are common throughout the universe and which <b>are</b> <b>specific</b> to Earth.|$|E
