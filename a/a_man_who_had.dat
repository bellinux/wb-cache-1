5|$|On 9 July 1918 McCudden {{was killed}} in a flying {{accident}} when his aircraft crashed following an engine fault. His rank {{at the time of his}} death was major, a significant achievement for <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> begun his career in the RFC as an air mechanic. McCudden is buried at the British war cemetery at Beauvoir-Wavans.|$|E
5|$|To the reader: {{whoever you}} are, your fears that this small clod of earth lies {{heavily on the}} buried Mercator are groundless; the whole Earth is no burden for <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> the whole weight of her lands on his {{shoulders}} and carried her as an Atlas.|$|E

In his chamber in the Rue St. Honore, at Paris, sat <b>a</b> <b>man</b> ALONE--a <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> been maligned, <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> {{been called}} <b>a</b> knave and charlatan, <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> been persecuted {{even to the}} death, it is said, in Roman Inquisitions, forsooth, and elsewhere.

5|$|According to Guha, Nehru and his Congress colleagues {{called on}} Indians to honour Gandhi's memory {{and even more}} his ideals. Nehru used the {{assassination}} to consolidate {{the authority of the}} new Indian state. Gandhi's death helped marshal support for the new government and legitimise the Congress Party's control, leveraged by the massive outpouring of Hindu expressions of grief for <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> inspired them for decades. The government suppressed the RSS, the Muslim National Guards, and the Khaksars, with some 200,000 arrests.|$|E
5|$|Olaf died in 1006, and Olaf's widow Thorgerd {{subsequently}} {{directed a}} number of revenge-killings herself, including that of Thorkel, <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> witnessed Kjartan's death but been indifferent to it and had not intervened. Bolli was killed by Olaf's sons and their allies in a raid led by Thorgerd. Some twelve years later, Gudrun, {{with the help of}} her friend Snorri Goði, had {{a number of}} Bolli's murderers killed in revenge.|$|E
5|$|The {{court was}} shown {{extensive}} video footage of Tomlinson and Harwood on the day. Harwood was seen trying to arrest <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> daubed graffiti on a police van, then joining {{a line of}} officers who were clearing Royal Exchange Passage. Harwood pushed a man who blew a vuvuzela at him, then appeared to push a BBC cameraman who was filming the arrest of another man. The footage showed Harwood push a third man out of the way, and shortly after this (the passageway now almost empty) the officers reached Tomlinson.|$|E

5|$|The first {{description}} of thrombosis of the cerebral veins and sinuses {{is attributed to}} the French physician Ribes, who in 1825 observed thrombosis of the saggital sinus and cerebral veins in <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> suffered from seizures and delirium. Until {{the second half of}} the 20th century it remained a diagnosis generally made after death. In the 1940s, reports by Dr Charles Symonds and others allowed for the clinical diagnosis of cerebral venous thrombosis, using characteristic signs and symptoms and results of lumbar puncture.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} Welsh monarch during Ímar's reign was Gruffudd ap Llywelyn (died 1063/1064). One of the latter's main rivals was Iago ab Idwal ap Meurig, King of Gwynedd (died 1039), <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> killed Gruffudd's {{father in}} 1023, and thenceforth ruled Gwynedd until his own demise in 1039. Gruffudd himself {{may have been}} responsible for Iago's slaying, and certainly succeeded to the kingship of Gwynedd after his death. It was likely in the context of Iago's fall and this resulting regime change that the latter's son, Cynan (fl. 1064), fled overseas and sought refuge in Dublin.|$|E
5|$|There {{were several}} {{bystanders}} {{who witnessed the}} murder and managed to see {{the faces of the}} assassins, including Juan Manuel Bautista, a colleague of Buendía; Rogelio Barrera Galindo, <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> parked his vehicle close to the journalist's; and Felipe Flores Fernández, a bus driver. Among the first to arrive at the murder scene was José Antonio Zorrilla Pérez, then-head of the Federal Security Directorate (DFS), Mexico's equivalent of the FBI, and one of Buendía's main sources for his political publications. Photos of Buendía's corpse circulated across Mexico {{and the rest of the}} world.|$|E

5|$|Tintin joins {{his friends}} {{a few days}} later, where he points out to Haddock and Calculus that their villa is bugged. He {{recognises}} one of the staff as Pablo, <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> saved his life in The Broken Ear. From Pablo, Tintin learns that the entire scenario is a plot organised by Colonel Sponsz, a figure in the Bordurian military who is assisting Tapioca's government {{in order to gain}} revenge against Tintin for the events of The Calculus Affair.|$|E
5|$|Gautier was not {{satisfied}} with this story. It was basically a succession of dances with one moment of drama at its end. He had no experience writing ballet scenarios so he called upon Vernoy de St. Georges, <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> written many ballet librettos. St. Georges liked Gautier's basic idea of the frail young girl and the Wilis. He wrote the story of Giselle {{as it is known}} today in three days, and sent it to Léon Pillet, the director of the Paris Opéra. Pillet needed a good story to introduce Grisi to the Paris public. He found that story in Giselle. Grisi liked it as much as Pillet did, so Giselle was put into production at once.|$|E
5|$|Henry Gerber and the Society for Human Rights {{serve as}} direct {{links between the}} LGBT-related {{activism}} of the Weimar Republic and the American homophile movement of the 1950s. In 1929, {{a young man named}} Harry Hay was living in Los Angeles. He soon discovered the cruising scene in Pershing Square, where he met Champ Simmons, <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> been a lover of one of Gerber's Society compatriots. This man told Hay about the Society's brief history, warning Hay of the futility of trying to organize gay men. Although Hay would later deny that he had any knowledge of previous LGBT activism, he was inspired by this knowledge to conceive in 1948 a proposal for a gay men's political and social group. In 1950 Hay's idea reached fruition when he and several other men founded the Mattachine Society, the first enduring LGBT rights organization in the United States.|$|E

5|$|His public enemies, {{even the}} men who {{directed}} the fatal shot, ne'er spoke or wrote of him without expressions of marked respect; those whom he commanded loved him even to idolatry; and I, his associate and commander, fail in words adequate to express my opinion of his great worth. I feel assured that every patriot in America, on hearing this sad news, will {{feel a sense of}} personal loss, and the country generally will realize that we have lost, not only an able military leader, but <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who,</b> <b>had</b> he survived, was qualified to heal the national strife which has been raised by designing and ambitious men.|$|E
5|$|In 1786, subfossil Rodrigues {{solitaire}} bones encrusted in stalagmite {{were discovered}} in a cave and sent to Georges Cuvier in about 1830. For unknown reasons, he stated they had recently been found on Mauritius, which caused confusion, until they were compared with other bones from Rodrigues that were found {{to belong to the}} same species. These finds confirmed Leguat's descriptions, but at this time no living residents of Rodrigues remembered having seen live specimens. In 1831, <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> lived on Rodrigues for 40 years said that he had never seen birds large enough to be Rodrigues solitaires. Rodrigues covers only , making it implausible that the bird would have survived undetected.|$|E
5|$|In 1999 Patel was reprimanded by the General Medical Council (GMC) {{for having}} {{released}} medical details about Roger Sylvester, <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> died in police custody. In 2002 the police dropped a criminal inquiry because Patel said the victim, Sally White, {{had died of}} a heart attack with no signs of violence, although she was reportedly found naked with bruising to her body, an injury to her head and a bite mark on her thigh. Anthony Hardy, a mentally ill alcoholic who lived in the flat in which her body was found locked in a bedroom, later murdered two women and placed their body parts in bin bags. The police investigated Patel in relation to that autopsy, but the investigation was dropped.|$|E

5|$|Scotland Yard issued another {{appeal in}} March 2014 for {{information}} about <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> entered holiday homes occupied by British families in four incidents in the western Algarve between 2004 and 2006, {{two of them in}} Praia da Luz. On those occasions he sexually assaulted five white girls, aged 7–10, in their beds. The man spoke English with a foreign accent and his speech was slow and perhaps slurred. He had short, dark, unkempt hair, tanned skin, and in the view of three victims a distinctive smell; he may have worn a long-sleeved burgundy top, perhaps with a white circle on the back. These were among 12 incidents in the area between 2004 and 2010. The Polícia Judiciária reportedly believed the intruder in the four incidents between 2004 and 2006 was Euclides Monteiro, the former Ocean Club employee from Cape Verde who died in 2009.|$|E

5|$|Charles and the Duke of Buckingham, James's {{favourite}} and <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> {{great influence}} over the prince, travelled incognito to Spain in February 1623 {{to try to reach}} agreement on the long-pending Spanish match. In the end, however, the trip was an embarrassing failure. The Infanta thought Charles was little more than an infidel, and the Spanish at first demanded that he convert to Roman Catholicism as a condition of the match. The Spanish insisted on toleration of Catholics in England and the repeal of the penal laws, which Charles knew would never be agreed by Parliament, and that the Infanta remain in Spain for a year after any wedding to ensure that England complied with all the terms of the treaty. A personal quarrel erupted between Buckingham and the Count of Olivares, the Spanish chief minister, and so Charles conducted the ultimately futile negotiations personally. When Charles returned to London in October, without a bride and to a rapturous and relieved public welcome, he and Buckingham pushed a reluctant King James to declare war on Spain.|$|E
