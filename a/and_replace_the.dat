The project will also add a carpool lot at Major Mackenzie Drive, upgrade overpasses at Highway 7 and 16th Avenue, <b>and</b> <b>replace</b> <b>the</b> Rouge River overpass. The project will start in 2017 and is expected to be completed in 2021.|$|E
5|$|As bishop, de Gray {{settled a}} long-running {{dispute between the}} monks of his cathedral chapter and his {{predecessors}} as bishop. He also allowed the monks of his cathedral chapter the right to appoint <b>and</b> <b>replace</b> <b>the</b> clergy of the dependent churches of the cathedral. De Gray received a 1203 missive from Innocent III decrying the marriages of some secular clergy, in contravention of canon law. In more secular matters, he granted the town of Bishop's Lynn (now King's Lynn) the right to hold a weekly market and two fairs per year. He also built a palace at Gaywood.|$|E
5|$|During the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, Suslov, {{along with}} Anastas Mikoyan, {{operated}} {{in close proximity}} to Budapest in order to direct the activities of the Soviet troops and to lend assistance to the new Hungarian leadership. Suslov and Mikoyan attended the Politburo meeting of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party which elected János Kádár to the General Secretaryship. In a telegram to the Soviet leadership, Suslov and Mikoyan acknowledged that the situation had become more dire, but both were content with the dismissal of Ernő Gerő as General Secretary and the choice of Kádár as his successor. The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet criticised Suslov's and Mikoyan's concessions to the new revolutionary government in the People's Republic of Hungary. Despite his initial reservations, Suslov eventually supported the Presidium's decision to intervene in Hungary militarily <b>and</b> <b>replace</b> <b>the</b> counterrevolutionary government's leadership there.|$|E

5|$|The Grand Street Bridge {{opened for}} traffic in 1919, {{but had to}} be closed in 1932 after the {{southeast}} pier was excessively settled. The Connecticut Highway Department and federal government provided the funds required to remove the bascule leaves <b>and</b> <b>replace</b> <b>the</b> pier in 1936. As {{a part of the}} renovations, a new floor and electrical system were installed. In 1965, the bridge floor was replaced with steel grating atop 14-inch (36-cm) I-beam stringers. In 1984, the eastern approach span and northwest trunnion post, the point where the bridge pivots, were reconstructed as part of what would be the bridge's last major renovations. Other minor repairs to the bridge's steel and masonry were done during the project. The bridge was closed in the 1990s and it was dismantled in 1999. In 2010, the United States Coast Guard struck the rule pertaining to the operation of the bridge due to its removal. Previously, the rule stated that the bridge need not open for the passage of vessels.|$|E
5|$|The flight on long pointed wings is noiseless, due {{to their}} soft plumage, and very buoyant. Flying birds can be sexed since the male has a white wing patch across three primary {{feathers}} and white tips to the two outer tail feathers, whereas females do not show any white in flight. Chicks have downy brown and buff plumage, and the fledged young are similar in appearance to the adult female. Adults moult their body feathers from June onwards after breeding, suspend the process while migrating, <b>and</b> <b>replace</b> <b>the</b> tail and flight feathers on the wintering grounds. Moult is completed between January and March. Immature birds follow a similar moult strategy to the adults unless they are from late broods, {{in which case the}} entire moult may take place in Africa.|$|E
5|$|The {{streetcar}} {{system was}} built by Twin City Rapid Transit and operated efficiently through 1949, with a program of reinvesting their profits into system improvements. However, in 1949, New York investor Charles Green gained control of the system, halted the rebuilding program, and announced a goal of completely converting the system to buses by 1958. These policies alienated the public and he was ousted in 1951, but his successor, Fred Ossanna, continued to cut service <b>and</b> <b>replace</b> <b>the</b> system with buses. On June 19, 1954, the last streetcar took its run. A photo taken in 1954 shows James Towley handing Fred Ossanna a check while one of the streetcars burned in the background. Later on, {{it was discovered that}} Ossanna and associates had plundered the streetcar system for personal gain. A small section of the line between Lake Calhoun and Lake Harriet is now operated by the Minnesota Streetcar Museum.|$|E

In September 2014, a further 16 were ordered; the final one of which was delivered in October 2016, bringing the fleet up to 120.|$|E
5|$|After the World Security Council members {{arrive for}} the Helicarriers' launch, Rogers {{broadcasts}} Hydra's plot to {{everyone at the}} Triskelion. Romanoff, disguised {{as one of the}} Council members, disarms Pierce. Fury arrives and forces Pierce to unlock S.H.I.E.L.D's database so that Romanoff can leak classified information, exposing Hydra to the public. Following a struggle, Fury kills Pierce. Meanwhile, Rogers and Wilson storm two Helicarriers <b>and</b> <b>replace</b> <b>the</b> controller chips, but the Winter Soldier destroys Wilson's suit and fights Rogers on the third. Rogers fends him off and replaces the final chip, allowing Hill to take control and have the vessels destroy each other. Rogers refuses to fight the Winter Soldier in an attempt to reach his friend, but as the ship collides with the Triskelion, Rogers is thrown out into the Potomac River. The Winter Soldier rescues the unconscious Rogers before disappearing into the woods. With S.H.I.E.L.D. in disarray, Romanoff appears before a Senate subcommittee and Fury, under the cover of his apparent death, heads to Eastern Europe in pursuit of Hydra's remaining cells. Rogers and Wilson decide to find the Winter Soldier, while Rumlow, who was a double agent for Hydra, is hospitalized following the Triskelion's destruction.|$|E
5|$|During the 1940s, NSB {{electrified}} the Sørland Line, {{although the}} final section from Egersund to Stavanger was not converted until 1956. In 1957, the Kirkenes–Bjørnevatn Line became the only line to remove the electrification <b>and</b> <b>replace</b> <b>the</b> electric locomotives with diesel power. The 1950s saw the electrification of several regional and commuter lines around Oslo, including the Kongsvinger Line, the Trunk Line and the Dovre Line from Lillestrøm to Hamar, the Vestfold Line and the Eastern Østfold Line. This was largely due to NSB's program to remove all steam locomotives, either by electrification or by dieselization. In the late 1950s and 1960s, several to-be electrified lines were operated with diesel locomotives as an interim solution. The 1960s saw the remaining two steam lines in Southern Norway, the Bergen and Dovre Lines, electrified along with the Gjøvik Line. The Bergen Line was completed in 1964 and the Dovre Line completed in 1970. This finished all the planned electrifications, and the authorities deemed the remaining lines unprofitable to electrify because of low traffic. During the 1990s, a new program was attempted, this time to electrify the entire network, but only the Arendal Line was converted before the program was canceled. However, new lines around Oslo, including the Lieråsen and Oslo Tunnels on the Drammen Line, and the Gardermoen and Asker Lines were electrified {{at the time they}} opened. Further plans have been launched, in particular the section of the Nordland Line from Trondheim to Steinkjer, {{which is part of the}} Trøndelag Commuter Rail, and the Meråker Line, which connects to the electrified Central Line in Sweden.|$|E

5|$|During the {{off-season}} Vancouver signed defenceman Jason Garrison to a six-year contract worth $27.6 million. While the Canucks brought in Garrison, they lost longtime defenceman Sami Salo. The Canucks wanted to re-sign Salo, {{though they were}} unwilling to sign him to a two-year contract and offered only a one-year deal. Salo chose to leave and signed a two-year $7.5 million contract with the Tampa Bay Lightning. It was believed that Garrison would step in {{and contribute to the}} power play <b>and</b> <b>replace</b> <b>the</b> departed Salo, who had performed a similar role. However, he struggled to adjust with his new team. He was taken off the power play unit and dropped to the third pairing within the first month. After the injuries to Bieksa, Garrison was moved from left defenceman to the right side pairing with Dan Hamhuis. The coaching staff came to consider this pairing to be the best and most trusted. Garrison finished the season with eight goals and eight assists, scoring three goals and three assists on the power play, and registering a +18 rating. His plus-minus was second on the team and led all defenceman.|$|E
5|$|This failure {{prompted}} the German command to rethink its strategy. To reinforce the troops <b>and</b> <b>replace</b> <b>the</b> losses, additional personnel were {{transferred from the}} 163rd Infantry Division based in Southern Finland. With a combined effort by all the German forces, extensive air-support by Luftflotte 5, {{as well as a}} supportive flanking attack by the Finnish 6th Division, they finally broke through the Soviet defenses on 6 July and captured Salla. A heavy Soviet counterattack drove them back out of the town but on 8 July, a general Soviet retreat of the 122nd Rifle Division allowed the German forces to recapture the town. The Soviet troops had to leave most of their artillery behind and in the heavy fighting some 50 Soviet tanks were destroyed. In order not to lose momentum, the SS Division Nord pursued the 122nd Rifle Division toward Lampela, while the 169th Division turned east toward Kayraly. Meanwhile, the Finnish 6th Division was making good progress in its flanking manoeuvre to the east to circumvent Kayraly and Lape Apa.|$|E
