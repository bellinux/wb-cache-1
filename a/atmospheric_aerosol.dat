25|$|<b>Atmospheric</b> <b>aerosol</b> particles, {{also known}} as {{atmospheric}} particulate matter, particulate matter (PM), particulates, or suspended particulate matter (SPM) are microscopic solid or liquid matter suspended in Earth's atmosphere. The term aerosol commonly refers to the particulate/air mixture, {{as opposed to the}} particulate matter alone. Sources of particulate matter can be natural or anthropogenic. They have impacts on climate and precipitation that adversely affect human health.|$|E
25|$|Several {{types of}} <b>atmospheric</b> <b>aerosol</b> have a {{significant}} effect on Earth's climate: volcanic, desert dust, sea-salt, that originating from biogenic sources and human-made. Volcanic aerosol forms in the stratosphere after an eruption as droplets of sulfuric acid that can prevail for up to two years, and reflect sunlight, lowering temperature. Desert dust, mineral particles blown to high altitudes, absorb heat and may be responsible for inhibiting storm cloud formation. Human-made sulfate aerosols, primarily from burning oil and coal, affect the behavior of clouds.|$|E
25|$|All {{aerosols}} both {{absorb and}} scatter solar and terrestrial radiation. This is quantified in the Single Scattering Albedo (SSA), {{the ratio of}} scattering alone to scattering plus absorption (extinction) of radiation by a particle. The SSA tends to unity if scattering dominates, with relatively little absorption, and decreases as absorption increases, becoming zero for infinite absorption. For example, sea-salt aerosol has an SSA of 1, as a sea-salt particle only scatters, whereas soot has an SSA of 0.23, showing {{that it is a}} major <b>atmospheric</b> <b>aerosol</b> absorber.|$|E

40|$|Various {{environmental}} samples including {{water from}} Lake Michigan, snow, rain and <b>atmospheric</b> <b>aerosols</b> {{were analyzed by}} total reflection X-ray fluorescence (TXRF). <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>aerosols</b> were taken hourly at different days in 2000 and 2001. One diurnal set out of these samples is selected and discussed in detail. Lake Michigan water samples were collected sporadically throughout the year as well as precipitation samples comprising of rain and snow. The precipitation samples {{were part of a}} project involving students in the environmental chemistry laboratory. All water samples could be analyzed as such after standardization. <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>aerosols</b> however, since collected onto filter membranes, were microwave digested prior to analysis. The results presented for the three types of environmental samples show the versatility of TXRF as analysis technique. Due to the small sample amount required, TXRF proves to be ideally suited in particular for <b>atmospheric</b> <b>aerosols</b> enabling a high time resolution and allowing the monitoring of air masses...|$|R
25|$|The direct aerosol effect {{consists}} of any direct interaction of radiation with <b>atmospheric</b> <b>aerosol,</b> such as absorption or scattering. It affects both short and longwave radiation {{to produce a}} net negative radiative forcing. The magnitude of the resultant radiative forcing due to the direct effect of an aerosol {{is dependent on the}} albedo of the underlying surface, as this affects the net amount of radiation absorbed or scattered to space. e.g. if a highly scattering aerosol is above a surface of low albedo it has a greater radiative forcing than if it was above a surface of high albedo. The converse is true of absorbing aerosol, with the greatest radiative forcing arising from a highly absorbing aerosol over a surface of high albedo. The direct aerosol effect is a first order effect and is therefore classified as a radiative forcing by the IPCC. The interaction of an aerosol with radiation is quantified by the single-scattering albedo (SSA), the ratio of scattering alone to scattering plus absorption (extinction) of radiation by a particle. The SSA tends to unity if scattering dominates, with relatively little absorption, and decreases as absorption increases, becoming zero for infinite absorption. For example, sea-salt aerosol has an SSA of 1, as a sea-salt particle only scatters, whereas soot has an SSA of 0.23, showing that it is a major <b>atmospheric</b> <b>aerosol</b> absorber.|$|E

Ramon was {{the space}} shuttle payload {{specialist}} on board the fatal STS-107 mission of Space Shuttle Columbia, in which he and the six other crew members {{were killed in a}} re-entry accident over the southern United States. Ramon had been selected as a payload specialist in 1997 and trained at the Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas, from 1998 until 2003. Among other experiments, Ramon was responsible for the MEIDEX project in which he was required to take pictures of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>aerosol</b> (dust) in the Mediterranean area using a multispectral camera designed to provide scientific information about atmospheric aerosols and the influence of global changes on the climate, and data for the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) and Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments. Researchers from Tel Aviv University (TAU) were responsible for the scientific aspect of the experiment. The TAU team also worked with a US company, Orbital Sciences Corporation, to construct and test special flight instruments for the project.|$|E
25|$|The Semi-direct effect {{concerns}} any radiative effect {{caused by}} absorbing <b>atmospheric</b> <b>aerosol</b> such as soot, apart from direct scattering and absorption, which {{is classified as}} the direct effect. It encompasses many individual mechanisms, and in general is more poorly defined and understood than the direct and indirect aerosol effects. For instance, if absorbing aerosols are present in a layer aloft in the atmosphere, they can heat surrounding air which inhibits the condensation of water vapour, resulting in less cloud formation. Additionally, heating a layer of the atmosphere relative to the surface results in a more stable atmosphere due to the inhibition of atmospheric convection. This inhibits the convective uplift of moisture, which in turn reduces cloud formation. The heating of the atmosphere aloft also leads to a cooling of the surface, resulting in less evaporation of surface water. The effects described here all lead {{to a reduction in}} cloud cover i.e. an increase in planetary albedo. The semi-direct effect classified as a climate feedback) by the IPCC due to the interdependence between it and the hydrological cycle. However, it has previously been classified as a negative radiative forcing.|$|E

25|$|Transgressing {{one or more}} {{planetary}} boundaries may be highly damaging or even catastrophic, due {{to the risk of}} crossing thresholds that trigger non-linear, abrupt environmental change within continental- to planetary-scale systems. The 2009 study identified nine {{planetary boundaries}} and, drawing on current scientific understanding, the researchers proposed quantifications for seven of them. These seven are climate change (CO2 concentration in the atmosphere < 350 ppm and/or a maximum change of +1 W/m2 in radiative forcing); ocean acidification (mean surface seawater saturation state with respect to aragonite ≥ 80% of pre-industrial levels); stratospheric ozone (less than 5% reduction in total atmospheric O3 from a pre-industrial level of 290 Dobson Units); biogeochemical nitrogen (N) cycle (limit industrial and agricultural fixation of N2 to 35 Tg N/yr) and phosphorus (P) cycle (annual P inflow to oceans not to exceed 10 times the natural background weathering of P); global freshwater use (< 4000nbsp&km3/yr of consumptive use of runoff resources); land system change (< 15% of the ice-free land surface under cropland); and the rate at which biological diversity is lost (annual rate of < 10 extinctions per million species).

40|$|The {{study of}} organic {{chemistry}} in <b>atmospheric</b> <b>aerosols</b> and cloud formation {{is of interest}} in predictions of air quality and climate change. It is now known that aqueous phase chemistry {{is important in the}} formation of secondary organic aerosols. Here, the photoreactivity of pyruvic acid (PA; CH 3 COCOOH) is investigated in aqueous environments characteristic of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>aerosols.</b> PA is currently used as a proxy for α-dicarbonyls in atmospheric models and is abundant in both the gas phase and the aqueous phase (<b>atmospheric</b> <b>aerosols,</b> fog, and clouds) in the atmosphere. The photoreactivity of PA in these phases, however, is very different, thus prompting the need for a mechanistic understanding of its reactivity in different environments. Although the decarboxylation of aqueous phase PA through UV excitation has been studied for many years, its mechanism and products remain controversial. In this work, photolysis of aqueous PA is shown to produce acetoin (CH 3 CHOHCOCH 3), lactic acid (CH 3 CHOHCOOH), acetic acid (CH 3 COOH), and oligomers, illustrating the progression from a three-carbon molecule to four-carbon and even six-carbon molecules through direct photolysis. These products are detected using vibrational and electronic spectroscopy, NMR, and MS, and a reaction mechanism is presented accounting for all products detected.
