40|$|Network {{services}} for the most demanding advanced networked applications which require absolute, per-flow service <b>assurances</b> can be deterministic or statistical. By exploiting statistical properties of traffic, statistical <b>assurances</b> can extract more capacity from a network than deterministic <b>assurances.</b> In this paper we consider statistical service <b>assurances</b> for traffic scheduling algorithms. We present functions, so-called effective envelopes, which are, with high certainty, upper bounds of multiplexed traffic. Effective envelopes {{can be used to}} obtain bounds on the amount of traffic on a link that can be provisioned with statistical service <b>assurances.</b> We show that our bounds can be applied to a variety of traffic scheduling algorithms. In fact, one can reuse existing admission control functions for scheduling algorithms with deterministic <b>assurances.</b> We present numerical examples which compare the number of flows with statistical <b>assurances</b> that can be admitted with our effective envelope approach to those achieved with existing methods.

40|$|The {{important}} {{concern for}} modern software systems {{is to become}} more cost-effective, while being versatile, flexible, resilient, dependable, energy-efficient, customisable, configurable and self-optimising when reacting to run-time changes that may occur within the system itself, its environment or requirements. One {{of the most promising}} approaches to achieving such properties is to equip software systems with self-managing capabilities using self-adaptation mechanisms. Despite recent advances in this area, one key aspect of self-adaptive systems that remains to be tackled in depth is <b>assurances,</b> i. e., the provision of evidence that the system satisfies its stated functional and non-functional requirements during its operation in the presence of self-adaptation. The provision of <b>assurances</b> for self-adaptive systems is challenging since run-time changes introduce a high degree of uncertainty during their operation. In this seminar, we discussed the problem of <b>assurances</b> for self-adaptive systems from four different views: criteria for <b>assurances,</b> composition and decomposition of <b>assurances,</b> feedback loop and <b>assurances,</b> and perpetual provisioning of <b>assurances...</b>|$|R
40|$|Diplomatic <b>assurances</b> are {{agreements}} reached {{between the}} State from {{which an individual}} is to be transferred and the receiving State that the individual to be transferred is not at risk of suffering certain human rights abuses. Such <b>assurances</b> are generally sought from States that are known for serious human rights violations. In The End of the Road on Diplomatic Assurances: The Removal of Suspected Terrorists under International Law, Evelyne Schmid explores the legal arguments that are invoked to {{support the use of}} diplomatic <b>assurances</b> and weighs them against empirical evidence of the consequences that arise when diplomatic <b>assurances</b> fail to protect the transferred individual, pointing Chahal v. the United Kingdom, Saadi v. Italy, Ben Khemais v. Italy and Toumi v. Italy as to illustrate how diplomatic <b>assurances</b> may not suffice in preventing mistreatment of the individual upon his or her transfer. Schmid stresses the need for a careful approach towards the use of diplomatic <b>assurances</b> and provides a framework for assessing their validity...|$|R

40|$|The {{practice}} of so-called diplomatic guarantees in recent international law The {{aim of this}} thesis is to analyze the {{practice of}} so-called diplomatic <b>assurances</b> (guarantees) in contemporary international law and its possible impact on existing obligations of States related {{to the protection of}} human rights, especially in relation to the ban on torture. Diplomatic <b>assurances</b> enable a transfer of an individual from one State to another. They include an undertaking of the State receiving an individual that he or she will be treated in accordance with the conditions set by the sending State, i. e. generally in accordance with the human rights obligations. However, it has recently received a great deal of public attention due to a number of suspicious returns of alleged terror suspects into the countries with poor human rights record including a record of torture. Consequently, the opinion criticizing the reliance on diplomatic <b>assurances</b> evolved describing diplomatic <b>assurances</b> as a tool how to circumvent current obligations of States under international human rights law. First part of this thesis provides a general overview of diplomatic <b>assurances,</b> their history, what are {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} diplomatic <b>assurances</b> and whether diplomatic <b>assurances</b> could be considered as treaties under [...] ...|$|R

5|$|Before a {{translation}} is greenlit and translators are allocated for each language, the localization, quality <b>assurance</b> (QA) and marketing staff play through a build {{of the game}} and sometimes do a focus group study. The localization team's playthrough can sometimes take over 100 hours of gameplay. Once the company greenlights a localization project, a period of brainstorming starts in which glossary, style, naming schemes and fonts are chosen. During the translation phase, voiced sections are translated first. Text files are cross-checked by multiple translators and editors. The text is then integrated along with any graphic and sound changes, and the game goes to quality <b>assurance.</b> During a period of several weeks to up to three months, Japanese QA teams look for bugs while Western QA teams check linguistic issues. The localization team often re-plays the game during this phase, translates the manuals and help out on the guidebooks if these are made. Finally, the game is sent to the hardware manufacturers to be approved.|$|E
