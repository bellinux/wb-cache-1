500|$|In February 1977, word {{leaked out}} that Matlock {{was leaving the}} Sex Pistols. On 28 February, McLaren sent a {{telegram}} to the NME confirming the split. He claimed that Matlock had been [...] "thrown out...because he went on too long about Paul McCartney.... the Beatles was too much." [...] In an interview a few months afterwards, Steve Jones echoed the charge that Matlock had been sacked because he [...] "liked the Beatles." [...] Jones expanded {{on the matter of}} the band's issues with Matlock: [...] "He was a good writer but he didn't look like a Sex Pistol <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> washing his feet. His mum didn't like the songs." [...] Matlock told the NME that he had voluntarily left the band by [...] "mutual agreement".|$|E
500|$|Gatiss has criticised recent {{television}} {{adaptations of}} the Conan Doyle stories as [...] "too reverential and too slow", aiming instead {{to be as}} irreverent to the canon as the 1930s and 1940s films starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, which were mostly set in the then contemporary interwar era. Benedict Cumberbatch's Sherlock uses modern technology, such as texting, the internet and GPS to solve crimes. Paul McGuigan, who directed two episodes of Sherlock, says that this {{is in keeping with}} Conan Doyle's character, pointing out that [...] "n the books he would use any device possible <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> in the lab doing experiments. It's just a modern day version of it. He will use the tools that are available to him today in order to find things out." ...|$|E

500|$|Clifford's Inn was {{the oldest}} of the Inns of Chancery, and was first {{mentioned}} in 1344. Although generally considered a dependent of the Inner Temple, its members always maintained that they were independent. As a note of that [...] "independence" [...] it became custom for the Inner Temple to send them a message once a year, which would be received but deliberately not replied to. Their coat of arms was a modified form of the Clifford family arms, with [...] "cheque or and azure, a fess gules, a bordure, bezantée, of the third." [...] Noted students include John Selden; Sir Edward Coke was also said to have studied there, but historical records find no evidence of this, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> associated with Lyon's Inn more than Clifford's.|$|E
500|$|A {{significant}} {{element of}} delusion permeated his thinking: Bundy was always surprised when anyone noticed {{that one of}} his victims was missing, because he imagined America to be a place where everyone is invisible except to themselves. <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> astounded when people testified that they had seen him in incriminating places, because Bundy did not believe people noticed each other. [...] "I don't know why everyone is out to get me", he complained to Lewis. [...] "He really and truly did not have any sense of the enormity of what he had done," [...] she said. [...] "A long-term serial killer erects powerful barriers to his guilt," [...] Keppel wrote, [...] "walls of denial that can sometimes never be breached." [...] Nelson agreed. [...] "Each time he was forced to make an actual confession," [...] she wrote, [...] "he had to leap a steep barrier he had built inside himself long ago." ...|$|E
500|$|Van Meegeren played {{different}} roles, some {{of which}} were shrouded in fraudulent intentions, as he sought to fulfill his goal of besting his critics. Han’s father was said to have once told him, [...] "You are a cheat and always will be." [...] On the other hand, his brothers and sisters perceived him as loyal, generous, and affectionate, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> loving and helpful to his own children. The question [...] "what was his character" [...] cannot be answered unequivocally. Indeed, recent works question many of the existing assumptions about van Meegeren and the motivations for his career in forgery. With Han van Meegeren, everything was double-edged, and his character presents itself as fragments rather than unity. In 2008, Harvard-trained art historian Jonathan Lopez had become fluent in Dutch and published 'The Man Who Made Vermeers, Unvarnishing the Legend of Master Forger Han Van Meegeren'. His extensive research confirmed that van Meegeren started to make forgeries, not so much by feeling misunderstood and undervalued by art critics as for the income that it generated, income which he needed to support his addictions and promiscuity. Lopez confirmed the veracity of Jan Spierdijk's article in 'De Waarheid' in which Spierdijk reported that the book 'Tekeningen 1' by van Meegeren was in Hitler's library, signed by the artist and dedicated to the Führer.|$|E

500|$|On 17 March 1918, Minifie {{took off}} in his Camel on a sortie. During the flight, {{he was forced to}} crash land in German-held {{territory}} near Houthulst Forest, Belgium. The exact circumstances of why he was forced to land are unknown, but it came as a result of either being shot down during a duel with Jasta 47's Friedrich Ehmann or Minifie's machine suffering engine failure. He was subsequently captured by German forces at Roulers, and taken as a prisoner of war; he spent the remainder of the war at prison camps in Karlsruhe and Clausthal, Germany. Roderic Dallas later wrote to Minifie's mother, informing her that Richard had been taken as a prisoner of war. In the letter he described Minifie as [...] "a brilliant pilot and air fighter", and stated that [...] "his aerial victories were gained by clean, clever fighting <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> so modest about his great achievements". On 1 April, the Royal Naval Air Service and Royal Flying Corps were combined to form the Royal Air Force, with personnel from the former services transferring to the new branch; Minifie was promoted to captain the same day. He was released from captivity following the Armistice with Germany in November 1918, returning to the United Kingdom on 13 December 1918. Minifie returned to Australia in May 1919, and was placed on the Royal Air Force's unemployed list on 1 November.|$|E

Although Weise was sometimes described as a loner, several students said he had numerous friends. He had a notebook in which he drew what a close friend described as [...] "dark stuff".|$|E

[...] Every time townsfolk needed someone's strength, Barada took the call.|$|E
2500|$|... {{presidency}} has inscribed {{him forever}} in Russian and in world history. ... A new democratic Russia was born during his time: a free, open and peaceful country. A {{state in which}} the power truly does belong to the people. ... the first President of Russia’s strength consisted in the mass support of Russian citizens for his ideas and aspirations. Thanks to the will and direct initiative of President Boris Yeltsin a new constitution, one which declared human rights a supreme value, was adopted. It gave people the opportunity to freely express their thoughts, to freely choose power in Russia, to realise their creative and entrepreneurial plans. This Constitution permitted us to begin building a truly effective Federation. ... We knew him as a brave and a warm-hearted, spiritual person. He was an upstanding and courageous national leader. <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> very honest and frank while defending his position. ... assumed full responsibility for everything he called for, for everything he aspired to. For everything {{he tried to do}} and did do for the sake of Russia, for the sake of millions of Russians.

2500|$|Ribbentrop became Hitler's {{favourite}} foreign-policy adviser, {{partly by}} dint of his familiarity with the world outside Germany, but also by flattery and sycophancy. One German diplomat later recalled that [...] "Ribbentrop didn't understand anything about foreign policy. His sole wish was to please Hitler". In particular, Ribbentrop acquired the habit of listening carefully to what Hitler was saying, memorizing his pet ideas, and then later presenting Hitler's ideas as his own – a practice that much impressed Hitler as proving Ribbentrop was an ideal National Socialist diplomat. Ribbentrop quickly learned that Hitler always favoured the most radical solution to any problem, and accordingly tendered his advice in that direction as a Ribbentrop aide recalled:When Hitler said 'Grey', Ribbentrop said 'Black, black, black'. He always said it three times more, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> more radical. I listened to what Hitler said one day when Ribbentrop wasn't present: 'With Ribbentrop it is so easy, he is always so radical. Meanwhile, {{all the other people}} I have, they come here, they have problems, they are afraid, they think we should take care and then I have to blow them up, to get strong. And Ribbentrop was blowing up the whole day and I had to do nothing. I had to break – much better!' ...|$|E
2500|$|Like fellow La Masia {{graduate}} Cesc Fàbregas, Iniesta originally {{started as}} a defensive midfielder, but his balance, ball control and agility allied with his skill on the ball saw him make progress as an attacking midfielder. Beyond his raw talent that was spotted {{at a young age}} by Barcelona's scouts, it was his great versatility, work ethic and inventiveness that allowed him to stake a claim on a first-team place at the age of 18. Vicente del Bosque described him as [...] "the complete footballer. He can attack and defend, he creates and scores," [...] and Frank Rijkaard said, [...] "I played him as a false winger, central midfielder, deep midfielder and just behind the striker <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> excellent." [...] He was used initially as a wide-forward in the absence of Juan Román Riquelme and Ronaldinho by Louis van Gaal and Rijkaard respectively, but made his name as a world-class player in central midfield alongside or in lieu of Xavi, at both club and international level. As FIFA.com says, [...] "It is in this position that his direct style and quick feet can be used to full effect, with the ball seeming glued to his toes as he races into threatening positions. Iniesta is a player known for his passing, dribbling, vision and movement." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bonwick and {{his wife}} arrived at Hobart on 10 October 1841. He was a {{successful}} teacher in Hobart for eight years and published {{the first of his}} many school books Geography for the Use of Australian Youth in 1845. He went to Adelaide in 1850, and opened a private school. In 1852 {{made his way to the}} Victorian gold diggings after finding himself in debt. He did not find much gold, but his health benefited. He then went to Melbourne where he published [...] from October 1852 until its final edition in May 1853. [...] In 1852 he also published [...] He then established a successful boarding school at Kew now a suburb of Melbourne. He had already published several school books and pamphlets, when in 1856 he published his Discovery and Settlement of Port Phillip, the first of his historical works. About this time he joined the Victorian government service as an inspector of denominational schools, and in 1857 made a tour of inspection through the western district of Victoria. He then made Ballarat his centre and worked there for about four years. During his journeys he suffered from sunstroke and a coaching accident, and became so ill that he had to retire from the service. He was given 18 months' leave of absence, but was unable to continue this work. His head had been injured in the accident. He was never able to ride a horse again, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> liable to have an attack of giddiness. He visited England in 1860 and then returned to Melbourne in July 1862 and opened a school in the suburb of St Kilda, which became very prosperous. He paid another visit to England with his wife, leaving the school in the hands of a son and a friend of his. They, however, mismanaged the school, and Bonwick was compelled to return and put things in order again. He was doing much writing, and in the ensuing years travelled in various parts of Australia, New Zealand and Europe.|$|E
