The results are compared with Monte Carlo simulations and a Density Functional Theory based on the Fundamental Measure approach and a second-order bulk expansion which <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> <b>electrostatic</b> correlations. The agreement is very good even for multivalent ions.

40|$|AbstractBackground: Recent {{studies have}} {{identified}} the human copper chaperone CCS as the presumed factor responsible for copper incorporation into superoxide dismutase (SOD). A {{lack of knowledge of}} the chaperone's three-dimensional structure has prevented understanding of how the copper might be transferred. Results: The three-dimensional structure of CCS was homology modelled using the periplasmic protein from the bacterial mercury-detoxification system and the structure of one subunit of the human SOD dimeric enzyme as templates. On the basis of the three-dimensional model, a mechanism for the transfer of copper from CCS to SOD is proposed that <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> <b>electrostatic</b> acceptor recognition, copper storage and copper-transfer properties. Conclusions: The proposed model identifies a path for copper transfer based on the presence of different metal sites characterized by sulphur ligands. Such a model permits the development of strategies able to interfere with copper incorporation in SOD, providing a possible way to prevent or arrest degeneration in the fatal motor neuron disorder amyotrophic lateral sclerosis...|$|E

The resulting method is better suited than either minimal-basis DFT or DFTB for modeling the low-level subsystem in embedded mean-field theory (EMFT), improving upon the former by correcting for basis-set incompleteness and upon the latter by properly <b>accounting</b> <b>for</b> <b>electrostatics.</b> EMFT calculations using DFT-in-FCDFT have much smaller errors in orbital energies, dipole moments, and reaction energies than our previous DFT-in-DFT calculations...|$|R
40|$|Humic {{substances}} (HS) were {{extracted from}} the soil and water of an upland catchment and characterised with respect to molecular weight, C, H, O, N and S contents and ash content. Three samples were obtained: peat humic acid, aquatic humic acid and aquatic fulvic acid. The weight average molecular weights were found to increase from 2400 for aquatic fulvic acid, to 6300 for aquatic humic acid and to 16500 for peat humic acid. Acid-base titrations were performed to assess the proton binding behaviour at different ionic strengths in NaCl and {{in the presence of}} important cation competitors (calcium and magnesium). The results from the titrations were fitted to a recently developed discrete-site/electrostatic model of cation-humic binding. Model parameters showed systematic trends with molecular weight and good agreement with parameters derived from the analysis of literature data. In the order peat humic, aquatic humic and aquatic fulvic acid, the milli-equivalents of carboxylic acid groups per gram of HS (nA) increased.

40|$|Classical {{theory of}} the {{electric}} double layer {{is based on the}} fundamental assumption of a dilute solution of point ions. There are a number of situations such as high applied voltages, high concentration of electrolytes, systems with multivalent ions, or solvent-free ionic liquids where the classical theory is often applied but the fundamental assumptions cannot be justified. Perhaps the most basic assumption underlying continuum models in electrokinetics is the mean-field approximation, that the electric field acting on each discrete ion is self-consistently determined by the local mean charge density. This paper considers situations where the mean-field approximation breaks down and electrostatic correlations become important. A fourth-order modified Poisson equation is developed that <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> <b>electrostatic</b> correlations and captures the essential features in a simple continuum framework. The theory is derived variationally as a gradient approximation for non-local electrostatics, in which the dielectric permittivity becomes a differential operator. The only new parameter is a characteristic length scale for correlated ion pairs. The model is able to capture subtle aspects of more detailed simulations based on Monte Carlo, molecular dynamics, or density functional theory and allows for the straightforward calculation of electrokinetic flows in correlated liquids, for the first time. Departures from classical Helmholtz-Smoluchowski theory are controlled by the dimensionless ratio of the correlation length to the Debye screening length. Charge-density oscillations tend to reduce electro-osmotic flow and streaming current, and over-screening of the surface charge can lead to flow reversal. These effects also help to explain the apparent charge-induced thickening of double layers in induced-charge electrokinetic phenomena...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} a general {{thermodynamic}} framework {{has been developed}} {{that can be applied}} to every acid gas-amine system, as well as to mixed gas systems or amine blends. This framework is based on the EoS/GE model electrolyte-LCVM (e-LCVM), which consists of the translated and modified Peng-Robinson equation of state and extended UNIQUAC as an expression of excess Gibbs free energy. By the addition of the Debye-Huckel term, extended-UNIQUAC <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> <b>electrostatic</b> interactions between ions produced by the chemical reactions of the acid gas and the amine and as a local composition model can predict ternary or quaternary systems using binary interaction parameters. One of the most important binary systems of the generic “acid gas - alkanolamine - water” system is H 2 O-MDEA. For this system there are few experimental data available in literature, so new experiments were conducted for the determination of more accurate parameters. These binary interaction parameters were used by e-LCVM and led to better predictions. The new framework is the first that succeeds in estimating the mole fractions of all species in the liquid phase with great accuracy. Then the binary parameters of extended-UNIQUAC that account for the molecular and electrostatic interactions among all species are determined. All parameters are judged by their impact on the results of the model and then the most important parameters are calculated in order to obtain the best fit of the model to a selected experimental database. After the correlation of the model, its predictions are tested against unregressed data in different conditions. The final test of the reliability of the model is its predictions for mixed gas systems and amine blends. Without regressing any new parameters e-LCVM calculated total and partial pressures with very good accuracy. ...|$|E

Combining a multireference perturbation method and density functional theory with a classical but atomistic and polarizable embedding scheme, we show that <b>accounting</b> <b>for</b> <b>electrostatics</b> only leads to a qualitatively wrong picture, while a responsive environment can successfully capture both the classical and quantum dominant effects.

Electrohydrodynamic ionic wind pumps, also known as electrostatic fluid accelerators (EFA), have the potential for becoming a critical element in electronics {{thermal management}} solutions.

40|$|Buildup and {{stabilization}} of external filter cake {{is a well-known}} phenomenon in several environmental and industrial applications. Significant decline of the tangential rate along thick intervals in lengthy vertical wells yields a nonuniform external filter cake profile. We derive the mechanical equilibrium equations for the stabilized cake profile <b>accounting</b> <b>for</b> <b>electrostatic</b> particle−rock interaction, varying permeate factor, applying the torque balance to describe cake equilibrium, and calculating the lever arm ratio using Hertz’s theory for contact deformation of cake and particles. An implicit formula for the cake thickness along the well is derived. Two regimes of the stabilized cake buildup correspond to low rates, where the cake starts from the reservoir top, and for high rates, where the cake is formed in the lower well section only. The sensitivity analysis shows that the drag and permeate forces are the competitive factors affecting cake thickness under varying Young’s modulus, rate, and salinity. The main parameters defining external cake profile are injection rate, cake porosity, water salinity, and Young’s modulus.

Analytical estimates based on the DVLO theory framework corroborate our findings. Molecular dynamics simulations using the OPEP coarse-grained force field for proteins show that the mutant E 17 Q is subject to larger structural fluctuations when compared to the wild type.

Given that experimental {{determination of the}} Gibbs hydration energy for this class of compounds is currently unfeasible, computer simulations appear as the only alternative for the estimation of this important quantity. Several simulation parameters are discussed and optimized based on calculations for barbituric acid.

It is shown that the electrostatic contribution is dominant (representing approximately 90 % of the total Gibbs energy of hydration) and that barbiturate intra-molecular interactions cannot be neglected. The importance of the electrostatic contribution is attributed {{to the formation of}} hydrogen bonds between the barbiturates and water, which {{play an important role in}} the solvation process.

40|$|We {{study the}} bulk {{thermodynamics}} and interfacial properties of electrolyte solution mixtures by <b>accounting</b> <b>for</b> <b>electrostatic</b> interaction, ion solvation, and inhomogeneity in the dielectric medium in the mean-field framework. Difference in the solvation energy between the cations and anions {{is shown to}} give rise to local charge separation near the interface, and a finite Galvani potential between two coexisting solutions. The ion solvation affects the phase equilibrium of the solvent mixture, depending on the dielectric constants of the solvents, reflecting the competition between the solvation energy and translation entropy of the ions. Miscibility is decreased if both solvents have low dielectric constants and is enhanced if both solvents have high dielectric constant. At the mean-field level, the ion distribution near the interface is determined by two competing effects: accumulation in the electrostatic double layer and depletion in a diffuse interface. The interfacial tension shows a nonmonotonic dependence on the salt concentration: it increases linearly with the salt concentration at higher concentrations and decreases approximately as the square root of the salt concentration for dilute solutions, reaching a minimum near 1 mM. We also find that, for a fixed cation type, the interfacial tension decreases as the size of anion increases.

These radicals have been previously experimentally detected and characterized both in the two-electron and one-electron activated forms of the enzymes. In this work, the well-studied W 164 radical in VP has been chosen for calibration purposes because its spectroscopic properties have been extensively studied by multifrequency EPR and ENDOR spectroscopies.

40|$|International audienceA new {{equation}} of state for electrolyte solutions has been developed from {{an expression of the}} Helmholtz free energy containing a nonelectrolyte part and a part relative to ions. The nonelectrolyte part is taken from the equations of state (EOS) of Schwartzentruber et al. (1989). The ionic part is composed of an MSA long-range term to <b>account</b> <b>for</b> <b>electrostatic</b> interactions and a short-range interaction term specific to ions. Using correlations between parameters and experimental ionic diameters, the model reduces to a one-parameter model. It has been applied to numerous strong electrolyte systems and extended to ternary systems to test its predictability without mixing parameters for ions. Its results compare well to the results reported for other one-parameter models (electrolyte EOS). Furthermore, {{it was found that the}} cation-anion interaction parameter could also be correlated to experimental ionic diameters. Then, the osmotic coefficients of 28 alkaline and alkaline-earth halide systems may be represented with a root mean square relative deviation of 2. 9 % using only six correlation parameters.

The resulting model is predictive. The quality of the prediction was tested by determining osmotic coefficients relative to six systems without any parameter adjustment.

40|$|Recent {{experimental}} and theoretical investigations show that water molecules between or near redox partners can significantly affect their electron-transfer (ET) properties. Here we study {{the effects of}} intervening water molecules on the electron self-exchange reaction of azurin (Az), by performing a conformational sampling on the water medium and by using a newly developed ab initio method to calculate transfer integrals between molecular redox sites. We show that the insertion of water molecules at the interface between the copper active sites of Az dimers slightly increases the overall ET rate, while some favorable water conformations can considerably enhance the ET kinetics. These features are traced back to the interplay of two competing factors: the electrostatic interaction between the water and protein subsystems (mainly opposing the ET process for the water arrangements drawn from MD simulations) and the effectiveness of water in mediating ET coupling pathways. Such an interplay provides a physical basis for the found absence of correlation between the electronic couplings derived through ab initio electronic structure calculations and the related quantities obtained through the Empirical Pathways (EP) method. In fact, the latter does not <b>account</b> <b>for</b> <b>electrostatic</b> effects on the transfer integrals. Thus, we conclude that the water-mediated electron tunneling is not controlled by the geometry of a single physical pathway. We discuss the results in terms of the interplay between different ET pathways controlled by the conformational changes of one of the water molecules via its electrostatic influence.
