5|$|Reports {{of the six}} {{missing women}} and Sparks's brutal beating {{appeared}} prominently in newspapers and on television throughout Washington and Oregon. Fear spread among the population; hitchhiking by young women dropped sharply. While pressure mounted on law enforcement agencies, the paucity of physical evidence severely hampered them. Police could not provide reporters with the little information that was available for fear of compromising the investigation. Further similarities between the victims were noted: The disappearances all took place at night, usually near ongoing construction work, {{within a week of}} midterm or final exams; all of the victims were wearing slacks or blue jeans; and at most crime scenes, there were sightings of <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>wearing</b> a cast or a sling, and driving a brown or tan Volkswagen Beetle.|$|E

Jones is presented as <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>wearing</b> an Armani suit jacket, with a cigarette {{in her mouth and}} a flattop haircut. While promoting the album, Jones slapped chat-show host Russell Harty live on air after he had turned to interview other guests, making Jones feel she was being ignored.|$|E

25|$|An {{eyewitness}} who {{was injured}} called Shaker Mohammed Abdulhussain told Al Wasat that police cars were parked near Salmaniya Medical Complex gates where the funeral {{was supposed to}} move out from. To prevent clashes between mourners and riot police, mourners formed a human chain in which Shaker {{was standing next to}} Al-Matrook. There were two people speaking to riot police telling them that the youth will ensure that nothing would go wrong. Then <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>wearing</b> full black came from outside the funeral and threw a stone at riot police, who then started firing rubber bullets and bird pellet gunshot indiscriminately. While Shaker and Al-Matrook were trying to help a man who was injured by rubber bullets to his leg, they were shot with bird pellet gunshot. Shaker was injured in his chest and other parts in the body, while Al-Matrook was injured in his back and died in the hospital.|$|E
25|$|The entity {{claims a}} unique {{tradition}} that unlike {{the rest of}} the state national guards, also includes the early American period that preceded the creation of the Thirteen Colonies. This claim is reflected in its first Coat of Arms which depicts the defeat of the British in the second Battle of San Juan and the patch worn by the 295th Regiment, designed by John Roqueña in 1953, which features <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>wearing</b> a morion. The first coat of arms of the PRNG featured a lion guarding a tower on top of an isle located in the middle of a blue field representing the ocean, the beast representing the militia guarding San Juan, three sailboats that represent the defeated British float in 1798, and a sheep next to a red book representing Puerto Rico as seen in the coat of arms. Since its early days, the units stationed in Puerto Rico used a yellow and red patch that features a guerite, similar to those at El Morro.|$|E

25|$|In Renaissance {{paintings}} of the adoration of the Trinity, God may be depicted in two ways, either with emphasis on The Father, or the three elements of the Trinity. The most usual depiction of the Trinity in Renaissance art depicts God the Father using an old man, usually with a long beard and patriarchal in appearance, sometimes with a triangular halo (as {{a reference to the}} Trinity), or with a papal crown, specially in Northern Renaissance painting. In these depictions The Father may hold a globe or book (to symbolize God's knowledge and as a reference to how knowledge is deemed divine). He is behind and above Christ on the Cross in the Throne of Mercy iconography. A dove, the symbol of the Holy Spirit may hover above. Various people from different classes of society, e.g. kings, popes or martyrs may be present in the picture. In a Trinitarian Pietà, God the Father is often symbolized using <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>wearing</b> a papal dress and a papal crown, supporting the dead Christ in his arms. They are depicted as floating in heaven with angels who carry the instruments of the Passion.|$|E

Madonna has performed the song in six of her concert tours, most recent being the Rebel Heart Tour in 2015. Most of the time, her performances of [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] were associated with strong reaction and uproar from the media.|$|E

500|$|Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their}} book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five. [...] The two noted that, while the episode's premise [...] "brims over with atmosphere", the ending of [...] "Død Kalm" [...] was {{extremely}} lacking. Shearman and Pearson argued [...] "that if the writers can only devise a plot which paints them into a corner so awkward there's no realistic way they can get out, then they shouldn't write the story at all." [...] The two also criticized the episode's make up.
