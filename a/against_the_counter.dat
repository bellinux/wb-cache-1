Anselmo states that he jumped off a bar stool to get high up in the air. He also said that it took him about ten takes until the cameramen got the shot into the desired style.|$|E

25|$|Corrigan {{had just}} stepped {{out the front}} door when he heard a second shot behind him. He turned and saw Switzer sliding down the wall with a {{surprised}} look on his face. Stiltz had shot him. Corrigan said he saw a closed penknife at Switzer's side, which he presumed fell out of his pocket or his hand. He then saw his stepfather shove Piott <b>against</b> <b>the</b> kitchen <b>counter</b> and threaten to kill him too. As Piott begged for his life, they heard emergency sirens. Corrigan thought this was the only reason Stiltz did not kill Piott. Corrigan said his stepfather lied in his account of the event before the coroner's jury.|$|R

A meeting place, a wailing wall, a place to borrow, Lottie was always there, the good {{listener}} with an open purse. She knew all the gossip and called all the local politicians by their first names so she could, when the occasion arose, do you a favor. Campaign posters plastered the store windows and every charity drive was represented. After school, children pressed <b>against</b> <b>the</b> candy <b>counter</b> and found their pennies garnered more than at any other store. When the small bell over the door gave warning of a customer, Lottie would call a greeting, her unlined face stretched into a smile.

5000|$|In November 2006 Thaksin, who was {{in exile}} {{following}} the coup, appointed Noppadon as his legal adviser, in matters relating both to his status in Thailand and his business affairs in Britain and elsewhere. In this capacity he defended Thaksin <b>against</b> <b>the</b> National <b>Counter</b> Curruption Commission (NCCC), which had alleged that Thaksin's purchase of the Manchester City Football Club showed that he was concealing assets allegedly gained through corruption while in office. He challenged the NCCC to examine Thaksin's asset statements, arguing that {{the purchase of the}} club was not financed by hidden wealth. He argued that Thaksin financed the purchase with [...] "honest earnings" [...] and that Thaksin was [...] "not obliged" [...] to declare funds held by his adult children, relatives and close associates.|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, {{both sides}} {{unleashed}} diplomatic offensives. The Knights dispatched {{letters to the}} monarchs of Europe, preaching their usual crusade <b>against</b> <b>the</b> heathens; Władysław <b>countered</b> with his own letters to the monarchs, accusing the Order of planning to conquer the whole world. Such appeals successfully recruited many foreign knights to each side. Wenceslas IV of Bohemia signed a defensive treaty with <b>the</b> Poles <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Teutonic Order; his brother, Sigismund of Luxembourg, allied himself with the Order and declared war against Poland on 12 July, though his Hungarian vassals refused his call to arms.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This {{work is a}} {{continuation}} of the process of developing a model for predicting the potential of Portland cements to exhibit expansion due to delayed ettringite formation, as presented in part 1 [1]. The model was derived basing on the kinetics theory applied to cement chemistry and evaluates two primary conditions of, the presence of sufficient active alumina in cement and the requirements for sulphate to alumina ratio applied <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>countering</b> microstructural effects, to determine the underlying kinetic characteristics for DEF in the system. The primary purpose of the model is determination of the intrinsic presence of the potential for DEF in cements. In the second part of this work herein presented, the model is validated and tested for robustness by its application {{to a wide range of}} existing experimental data for DEF studies, taken from various global sources available in the literature. Over 164 data sets taken from various independent works, were used in the validation. It was found that the model was in strong agreement with experiment data for both expansive and non-expansive cements. However, some few outputs showed disagreements between model predictions and experimental observations. Most of the important disparities appear to occur with cements of high Fe 2 O 3 /Al 2 O 3 ratios and may be related to inadequacy of the Bogue formula used in the model. These revealed aspects where future refinement of the model will be required. The model at this stage is applicable to plain Portland cements with a future possibility of improvements to examine more complex systems containing pozzolanic materials...|$|R
50|$|Consequently, the 16th and 17th centuries were {{to witness}} a {{succession}} of armed Druze rebellions <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Ottomans, <b>countered</b> by repeated Ottoman punitive expeditions <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Chouf, in which the Druze population of the area was severely depleted and many villages destroyed. These military measures, severe as they were, {{did not succeed in}} reducing the local Druze to the required degree of subordination. This led the Ottoman government to agree to an arrangement whereby the different nahiyes (districts) of the Chouf would be granted in iltizam ("fiscal concession") to one of the region's amirs, or leading chiefs, leaving the maintenance of law and order and the collection of its taxes in the area {{in the hands of the}} appointed amir. This arrangement was to provide the cornerstone for the privileged status which ultimately came to be enjoyed by the whole of Mount Lebanon, Druze and Christian areas alike.|$|R
