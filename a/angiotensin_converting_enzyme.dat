25|$|Since {{cardiovascular}} {{disease is a}} serious complication associated with diabetes, some have recommended blood pressure levels below 130/80mmHg. However, evidence supports {{less than or equal}} to somewhere between 140/90mmHg to 160/100mmHg; the only additional benefit found for blood pressure targets beneath this range was an isolated decrease in stroke risk, and this was accompanied by an increased risk of other serious adverse events. A 2016 review found potential harm to treating lower than 140 mmHg. Among medications that lower blood pressure, <b>angiotensin</b> <b>converting</b> <b>enzyme</b> inhibitors (ACEIs) improve outcomes in those with DM while the similar medications angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) do not. Aspirin is also recommended for people with cardiovascular problems, however routine use of aspirin has not been found to improve outcomes in uncomplicated diabetes.|$|E
25|$|Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone {{system is}} a major blood {{pressure}} regulating mechanism. Markers of electrolyte and water imbalance in the body such as hypotension, low distal tubule sodium concentration, decreased blood volume and high sympathetic tone trigger {{the release of the}} enzyme renin from the cells of juxtaglomerular apparatus in the kidney. Renin activates a circulating liver derived prohormone angiotensinogen by proteolytic cleavage of all but its first ten amino acid residues known as angiotensin I. ACE (<b>Angiotensin</b> <b>converting</b> <b>enzyme)</b> then removes a further two residues, converting angiotensin I into angiotensin II. ACE is found in the pulmonary circulation and in the endothelium of many blood vessels. The system increases blood pressure by increasing the amount of salt and water the body retains, although angiotensin is also very good at causing the blood vessels to tighten (a potent vasoconstrictor).|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} {{a wide variety of}} drugs that can trigger dysgeusia, {{including}} zopiclone, H1-antihistamines, such as azelastine and emedastine. Approximately 250 drugs affect taste. The sodium channels linked to taste receptors can be inhibited by amiloride, and the creation of new taste buds and saliva can be impeded by antiproliferative drugs. Saliva can have traces of the drug, giving rise to a metallic flavor in the mouth; examples include lithium carbonate and tetracyclines. Drugs containing sulfhydryl groups, including penicillamine and captopril, may react with zinc and cause deficiency. Metronidazole and chlorhexidine have been found to interact with metal ions that associate with the cell membrane. Drugs that prevent the production of angiotensin II by inhibiting <b>angiotensin</b> <b>converting</b> <b>enzyme,</b> eprosartan for example, have been linked to dysgeusia. There are few case reports claiming calcium channel blockers like Amlodipine also cause dysguesia by blocking calcium sensitive taste buds.|$|E

25|$|Another system {{maintaining}} the extracellular fluid volume, peripheral resistance, {{and that if}} disturbed may lead to hypertension, is the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system. Renin is a circulating enzyme that participates in maintaining extracellular volume and arterial vasoconstriction, therefore contributing to regulation of blood pressure. It performs this function by breaking down (hydrolysing) angiotensinogen, secreted from the liver, into the peptide angiotensin I. Angiotensin I is further cleaved by an enzyme that is located primarily but not exclusively in the pulmonary circulation bound to endothelium; that enzyme is <b>angiotensin</b> <b>converting</b> <b>enzyme</b> (ACE). This cleavage produces angiotensin II, the most vasoactive peptide. Angiotensin II is a potent constrictor of all blood vessels. It acts on the musculature of arteries, raising peripheral resistance and thereby elevating blood pressure. Angiotensin II also causes the adrenal glands to release aldosterone, which stimulates the epithelial cells of the kidneys to increase re-absorption of salt and water, leading to raised blood volume and raised blood pressure. So elevated renin levels in the blood (normally 1.98-2.46ng/ml in the upright position) leads to hypertension.|$|E
25|$|Proteins {{constitute}} 90-95% of venom's {{dry weight}} {{and they are}} responsible for almost all of its biological effects. Among hundreds, even thousands of proteins found in venom, there are toxins, neurotoxins in particular, as well as nontoxic proteins (which also have pharmacological properties), and many enzymes, especially hydrolytic ones. Enzymes (molecular weight 13-150 KDa) make-up 80-90% of viperid and 25-70% of elapid venoms: digestive hydrolases, L-amino acid oxidase, phospholipases, thrombin-like pro-coagulant, and kallikrein-like serine proteases and metalloproteinases (hemorrhagins), which damage vascular endothelium. Polypeptide toxins (molecular weight 5-10 KDa) include cytotoxins, cardiotoxins, and postsynaptic neurotoxins (such as α-bungarotoxin and α-Cobratoxin), which bind to acetylcholine receptors at neuromuscular junctions. Compounds with low molecular weight (up to 1.5 KDa) include metals, peptides, lipids, nucleosides, carbohydrates, amines, and oligopeptides, which inhibit <b>angiotensin</b> <b>converting</b> <b>enzyme</b> (ACE) and potentiate bradykinin (BPP). Inter- and intra-species variation in venom chemical composition is geographical and ontogenic. Phosphodiesterases interfere with the prey's cardiac system, mainly to lower the blood pressure. Phospholipase A2 causes hemolysis by lysing the phospholipid cell membranes of red blood cells. Amino acid oxidases and proteases are used for digestion. Amino acid oxidase also triggers some other enzymes and is responsible for the yellow colour of the venom of some species. Hyaluronidase increases tissue permeability to accelerate absorption of other enzymes into tissues. Some snake venoms carry fasciculins, like the mambas (Dendroaspis), which inhibit cholinesterase to make the prey lose muscle control.|$|E

The ACE type 2 (ACE 2) increases angiotensin 1 - 7 production and counterbalances ACE effects.

2500|$|Ferreira {{received}} his M.D. from the Faculty of Medicine of Ribeirão Preto of the University of São Paulo (USP) and soon became staff {{member of the}} same school, {{where he is a}} member of the Department of Pharmacology. His research training in pharmacology initiated in this Department with Prof. Maurício Rocha e Silva, the discoverer of bradykinin. While working on this subject, he discovered a family of peptides present in the venom of a Brazilian snake, Bothrops jararaca, which inhibited kininase activity and strongly potentiated the effects of bradykinin in vivo and in vitro. This factor was named bradykinin potentiating factor, BPF. In 1968, with the collaboration of Dr. Lewis Joel Greene, from the Brookhaven National Laboratory, U.S., he isolated several pharmacologically active peptides responsible for the activity of BPF. Using those peptides, was demonstrated a general parallelism between bradykinin potentiation and inhibition of Angiotensin I conversion. Subsequently, his group elucidated the structure of the smallest peptide, and using the synthetic pentapeptide, demonstrated its ability to potentiate bradykinin and to inhibit the conversion of angiotensin I in vivo [...] in experimental models of hypertension. His work in this area paved the way for the development of a new class of antihypertensive drugs, the <b>angiotensin</b> <b>converting</b> <b>enzyme</b> (ACE) inhibitors by Squibb scientists.

40|$|Familial hypertrophic {{cardiomyopathy}} is an autosomal dominant genetically heterogeneous disease {{characterized by a}} partial penetrance and variable expressivity. Previous studies showed that the extent of hypertrophy {{is influenced by the}} <b>angiotensin</b> I <b>converting</b> <b>enzyme</b> insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism. Recently, molecular genetic analysis revealed the existence of healthy carriers and that as many as a quarter of genetically affected individuals do not express the disease. This data prompted us to re-investigate the role of the <b>angiotensin</b> I <b>converting</b> <b>enzyme</b> polymorphism on hypertrophy by assessing both clinically affected individuals and healthy carriers. For this, several families with mutations in the cardiac myosin binding protein C or the β-myosin heavy chain genes were analysed.

Significant association between the D allele and hypertrophy was observed only in the case of Arg 403 codon mutations (mean septum thickness for subjects with the DD genotype: 19. 3 ± 2. 7 mm; with the ID genotype: 13. 4 ± 1. 3 mm and with the II genotype: 11. 0 ± 0. 9 mm; P < 0. 02).
