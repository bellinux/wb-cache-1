40|$|ObjectiveThis {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the differences in the diameter of the thoracic aorta when measured from electrocardiographic (ECG) -gated and nongated computed tomography (CT) angiography. Another aim was to define the difference in the aortic diameter when it is measured at peak systole and end diastole in ECG-gated scans. MethodsThe gated and nongated CT angiograms of 27 patients (mean age, 58  ± 16 standard deviation [SD] years) obtained on a 256 -slice multidetector CT scanner were used. The transverse and <b>anteroposterior</b> <b>diameters</b> and the lumen areas were measured at 1, 4, and 8  cm below the origin of the left subclavian artery. ResultsThere was {{a significant difference in the}} aortic measurements of diameter between gated and nongated scans found in samples taken at 1, 4, and 8  cm distal to the left subclavian artery (P <. 0001). We found a considerable difference between the systolic and diastolic diameters (P <. 0001). The maximum change in diameter between systole and diastole was 2. 9  ± 0. 9 (SD) mm (14. 5 %, P <. 0001) at 1  cm, 5. 4  mm (22. 6 %; median, 1. 7  mm; P <. 0001) at 4  cm, and 4. 4  mm (16. 9 %; median, 1. 3  mm; P <. 0001) at 8  cm. There was a significant difference between the transverse and <b>anteroposterior</b> <b>diameters</b> in systole and diastole at all locations (P <. 0001) : The maximum change in diameter between transverse and <b>anteroposterior</b> <b>diameters</b> in systole was 5. 4  ± 1. 1 (SD) mm (15. 7 %, P <. 0001) at 1  cm, 5. 8  mm (19 %; median, 1. 4  mm; P <. 0001) at 4  cm, and 5  mm (15 %; median, 1. 02  mm; P <. 0001) at 8  cm. There was also a substantial difference between measuring the transverse diameter directly and deriving it from the lumen area (P <. 0001). ConclusionsOur results showed an important difference between systolic and diastolic diameters measurements in ECG-gated scans. The standard protocol for measuring aortic diameters in gated scans of the thoracic aorta uses images at end diastole because the lack of wall motion at this time provides better resolution. This is likely to result in undersizing that, in some instances, may threaten stability and the proper seal of the stent graft. The dimensions of the aorta in a gated CT should be measured at peak systole rather than the conventional end diastole used today. Most medical centers use nongated CT or gated CT scans in end diastole to calculate sizes of endografts. In view of our findings, the latter method could result in potential complications...|$|R

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate, by using ultrasound imaging, cervical lymph nodes in patients with multiple sclerosis and to ascertain if such patients have any clinical features to attest their role. METHODS: We enrolled 43 patients affected by relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (22 drug free and 21 under treatment with natalizumab or fingolimod), who underwent ultrasound examination. The morphology, diameters and volume of cervical lymph nodes were measured. We evaluated also a control group of 20 healthy volunteers. RESULTS: Between-group comparisons showed that the mean <b>anteroposterior</b> <b>diameters</b> in the cervical lymph nodes on both sides of the neck were significantly different (χ 2 = 19. 5, p < 0. 001 for right; χ 2 = 20. 0, p < 0. 001 for left). Post hoc contrasts showed that the mean <b>anteroposterior</b> <b>diameters</b> were greater both in drug-naive (mean ± SD 0. 66 ± 0. 20 cm; p < 0. 001) and treated patients (0. 55 ± 0. 24 cm; p < 0. 001) compared to healthy individuals (0. 36 ± 0. 19 cm). Moreover, significant difference (p < 0. 001) was shown on comparing the mean volume of the cervical lymph nodes on both sides of the neck in the studied groups. No significant differences emerged between the drug-free and treated patients. CONCLUSION: The abnormalities shown by ultrasound in cervical lymph nodes are related to deep ones and independent of the ongoing treatment, suggesting a relationship between lymphatic drainage and disease pathology...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} the narrowest {{diameter of the}} bony nasolacrimal canal. METHODS: Fifty-eight bony nasolacrimal canals from 29 Japanese cadavers (12 men and 17 women; average age at death, 83. 4 years; range, 70 - 99 years) had been fixed in 10 % buffered formalin before use. After exposing the medial (44 canals) or posterior half (14 canals) of the bony nasolacrimal canal, the part with the shortest <b>anteroposterior</b> or transverse <b>diameter</b> was determined on inspection. These positions from the canal entrance were measured, and the distance ratio, indicating where the shortest diameter was located {{in relation to the}} total length of the canal, was calculated. RESULTS: The shortest <b>anteroposterior</b> and transverse <b>diameters</b> were {{at the entrance to the}} canal in 32 of 44 canals (72. 7 %) and in 9 of 14 canals (64. 3 %), respectively. In the other canals, the shortest <b>anteroposterior</b> and transverse <b>diameters</b> were located at an average of 3. 6 and 5. 6 [*]mm from the entrance, and the distance ratios were 29. 0 % and 46. 7 %, respectively.

The histopathology of congenital subglottic stenosis includes abnormally shaped cricoid cartilage or laryngeal cleft [11]. Most frequently, the transverse diameter is shorter than normal, making the stenosis detectable on chest X-ray examination [6]. In the present case, detection of the stenosis by preoperative chest X-ray was difficult since the tracheal shape was flattened, while transverse diameter was preserved according to CT imagery. The narrowest tracheal diameter calculated, based on the CT image, was 3.6  mm on POD 7.

50|$|Expansion of the {{thoracic}} cavity is driven in three planes; the vertical, the anteroposterior and the transverse. The vertical plane is extended by {{the help of}} the diaphragm contracting and the abdominal muscles relaxing to accommodate the downward pressure that is supplied to the abdominal viscera by the diaphragm contracting. A greater extension can be achieved by the diaphragm itself moving down, rather than simply the domes flattening. The second plane is the anteroposterior and this is expanded by a movement known as the 'pump handle.' The downward sloping nature of the upper ribs are as such because they enable this to occur. When the external intercostal muscles contract and lift the ribs, the upper ribs are able also to push the sternum up and out. This movement increases the <b>anteroposterior</b> <b>diameter</b> of the {{thoracic cavity}}, and hence aids breathing further. The third, transverse, plane is primarily expanded by the lower ribs (some say it is the 7th to 10th ribs in particular), with the diaphragm's central tendon acting as a fixed point. When the diaphragm contracts, the ribs are able to evert and produce {{what is known as the}} bucket handle movement, facilitated by gliding at the costovertebral joints. In this way, the transverse diameter is expanded and the lungs can fill.|$|E

We assessed the patient's contralateral tendon and also performed ultrasonography on the Achilles tendon of 70 age- and sex-matched controls. We recorded the maximum transverse <b>anteroposterior</b> <b>diameter,</b> the presence of intratendinous alterations, and the presence of intratendinous calcification. RESULTS: The average maximum <b>anteroposterior</b> <b>diameter</b> of the ruptured tendon was 11. 7 mm (SD = 2. 10). The patients' normal tendons measured an average of 5. 4 mm (SD = 0. 9), and there was an average measure of 4. 9 mm (SD = 0. 5) (p = 0. 0001) in the controls. There was no difference in the maximum <b>anteroposterior</b> <b>diameter</b> of the ruptured tendon depending on the method of treatment (conservative, open repair, percutaneous repair).

CONCLUSION: The <b>anteroposterior</b> <b>diameter</b> of the ruptured tendon was significantly greater than the nonruptured contralateral.
