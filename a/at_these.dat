5|$|A rare but {{important}} terrain feature {{found in the}} abyssal and hadal zones is the hydrothermal vent. In contrast to the approximately 2°C ambient water temperature <b>at</b> <b>these</b> depths, water emerges from these vents at temperatures ranging from 60°C up to as high as 464°C. Due to the high barometric pressure <b>at</b> <b>these</b> depths, water may exist in either its liquid form or as a supercritical fluid at such temperatures.|$|E

5|$|The Cat's Eye was {{the first}} {{planetary}} nebula to be observed with a spectroscope by William Huggins on August 29, 1864. Huggins' observations revealed that the nebula's spectrum was non-continuous and made of a few bright emission lines, first indication that planetary nebulae consist of tenuous ionised gas. Spectroscopic observations <b>at</b> <b>these</b> wavelengths are used in abundance determinations, while images <b>at</b> <b>these</b> wavelengths {{have been used to}} reveal the intricate structure of the nebula.|$|E

5|$|A close {{binary star}} system occurs when two stars orbit {{each other with}} an average {{separation}} that is of the same order of magnitude as their diameters. <b>At</b> <b>these</b> distances, more complex interactions can occur, such as tidal effects, transfer of mass and even collisions. Tidal interactions in a close binary system can result in modification of the orbital and rotational parameters. The total angular momentum {{of the system is}} conserved, but the angular momentum can be transferred between the orbital periods and the rotation rates.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 66 cyclists have been {{qualified}} {{in the event}} <b>at</b> <b>these</b> Games. Most {{of them are not}} expected to finish one-day races, having worked in support for their teams (in this case, nations) to place riders with better climbing skills in good positions once the mountainous part of a course begins. Additionally, any rider lapped by the race leader on the Badaling circuit would be forced to stop, although this situation did not occur.|$|E

5|$|<b>At</b> <b>these</b> sites, {{the study}} also found averages of 1.7, 2.23, and 5.56 parts per million of aluminum, respectively. Concentrations of {{aluminium}} higher than 100 to 200 parts per million can cause suffocation of fish by accumulating in their gills. The toxicity of aluminum to fish is increased by a water pH of below 4.5 to 6.5. There were also 0.65, 0.81, and 1.84 parts per million of iron in these sites, and 0.96, 1.15, 0.03, and 2.65 parts per million of manganese. There were 91.37, 114.27, and 274.1 milligrams per liter of sulfates {{in the waters of}} Nescopeck <b>at</b> <b>these</b> sites.|$|E
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>these</b> speeds, it was {{expected}} that the B-70 would be almost immune to interceptor aircraft, the only effective weapon against bomber aircraft at the time. The bomber would spend only a few minutes over a particular radar station, flying out of its range before the controllers could position their fighters in a suitable location for an interception. High speed also made the aircraft difficult to see on radar displays and its high-altitude flight could not be matched by any contemporary Soviet fighter.|$|E

5|$|Because Wells Cathedral was secular {{rather than}} monastic, cloisters {{were not a}} {{practical}} necessity. They were omitted from several other secular cathedrals but were built here and at Chichester. Explanations for their construction <b>at</b> <b>these</b> two secular cathedrals range from the processional to the aesthetic. As at Chichester, there is no northern range to the cloisters. In monastic cloisters it was the north range, benefiting most from winter sunlight, that was often used as a scriptorium.|$|E
