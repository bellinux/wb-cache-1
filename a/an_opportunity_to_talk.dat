Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX) asked Mueller [...] "Did {{you have}} <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to General Ashcroft, {{or did he}} discuss what was {{discussed}} in the meeting with Attorney General Gonzales and the chief of staff?" [...] He replied [...] "I did have a brief discussion with Attorney General Ashcroft." [...] Lee went on to ask [...] "I guess we use [...] TSP , we use warrantless wiretapping. So would I be comfortable in saying that those were the items {{that were part of}} the discussion?" [...] He responded [...] "It was—the discussion was on a national—an NSA program that has been much discussed, yes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why not? Please {{tell me why}} not?" [...] Richard begged. [...] "I am {{not asking}} for {{anything}} more now than just <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> with her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish you'd stay here!" [...] he exclaimed, impulsively. [...] "Accept my sister's invitation--it {{would give}} us such <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> of this sitting. Come, let me send for your trunks." ...|$|E
50|$|During the Pope Benedict XVI Islam controversy, he said:I {{have two}} {{reactions}} to the pope's lecture: There is my concern about the degradation of relations and, at the same time, I see <b>an</b> <b>opportunity.</b> <b>A</b> chance <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about a serious, important issue: the relationship between religion and logic.|$|R

2500|$|Aga Khan IV, {{leader of}} the Nizari Ismaili branch of Islam said: [...] "I have two {{reactions}} to the pope's lecture: There is my concern about the degradation of relations and, at the same time, I see <b>an</b> <b>opportunity.</b> <b>A</b> chance <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about a serious, important issue: the relationship between faith and logic" ...|$|R
6000|$|When {{the mother}} and {{daughter}} had gone Mrs. Verrian said, [...] "She is a great admirer of yours, Philip. She's read your story, and I suspect she wants <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> with you about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{often thought}} so," [...] said Stephen laconically. He thrust {{his hands into}} his pockets and gazed moodily out to sea. Miss Trevor had never before had <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to him in Paul's absence and she {{determined}} {{to make the most of}} it.|$|E
6000|$|... "If you've {{an hour or}} so to spare, Mr. Jacks," [...] he said, [...] "I'd like to {{go right}} into this with you, if it would {{interest}} you any. It's my business over here, so naturally I am glad enough of <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> it over." ...|$|E
5000|$|Jestem gejem, jestem lesbijką. Poznaj nas. (I'm gay, I'm a lesbian. Get to know us.) - was a tour around Polish universities: with {{educational}} meetings for students, teachers, and LGBT-people's parents - and for many, <b>a</b> first <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> with openly gay people.http://www.homoseksualizm.org.pl/(Polish) ...|$|R

60|$|He {{arrived just}} as the Squire was in the full flow of his meditations, {{and it would not}} have needed a man of Mr. Quest's {{penetration}} and powers of observation to discover that he had something on his mind which he was longing for <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about.|$|E
6000|$|... "I had hoped," [...] {{replied the}} Colonel, in an aggrieved voice, [...] "that {{you might have}} been able to spare me a few minutes' conversation. For some weeks I have been seeking <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to you; but somehow your arduous occupations never seem to leave you free for {{ordinary}} social intercourse." ...|$|E
60|$|Thus {{they walked}} along {{down the steep}} path, until they began to enter the bushes. Rollo's father had made this {{arrangement}} {{so that he might}} have <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> with him about the difficulty with the boys, for he thought, on the whole, {{it would be better to}} talk with him now than to wait till they got home.|$|E
5000|$|Sabeel offers regular [...] "witness visits" [...] to the Holy Land for Christian clergy. The trips {{provide them}} with <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> meet, <b>talk,</b> and worship with Palestinian Christians and others who oppose the Israeli occupation. The clergy members are able to {{experience}} [...] "the Separation Wall, illegal settlements, checkpoints, confiscated and demolished homes, refugee camps, and environmental degradation".|$|R
50|$|It was {{suggested}} to Penn in email, on his Myspace account (now inactive), and in person after his Penn & Teller show, that Penn Radio devote the occasional Monday to Michael Goudeau. Goudeau {{would have been}} given <b>a</b> greater <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about his interesting life and field calls and gmails directed at him. Penn indicated such an idea would not fly.|$|R
50|$|Five days later, Rowena and Miles {{are taking}} a walk when it begins to rain. They seek shelter in the Teasdale's shed and have <b>a</b> rare <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> one another. Rowena admits to {{sleeping}} {{with most of the}} squash club and recommends that Miles have an affair as well to rediscover his long-lost sense of adventure. Miles takes the suggestion badly so she locks him in the shed.|$|R
6000|$|He {{plunged into}} his speech with a long-drawn, rasping [...] "Well, boys," [...] that, {{though they were}} not {{conscious}} of it, set every young nerve ajar. He supposed they knew--hey?--what he had come down for? It was not often that he had <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to boys. He supposed that boys were {{very much the same}} kind of persons--some people thought them rather funny persons--as they had been in his youth.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why not?' said {{a little}} French actress, highly {{finished}} like a miniature, who scarcely ate anything, but drank champagne and chatted with equal rapidity and composure, and who was always ready to fight anybody's battle, provided she could get <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk.</b> 'Why not, Mr. Annesley? You never will let anybody eat. I never eat myself, because every night, having to talk so much, I am dry, dry, dry; so I drink, drink, drink. It is an extraordinary thing {{that there is no}} language which makes you so thirsty as French.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{need not}} go very far, {{if it is}} {{fighting}} that you want," [...] the man said. [...] "Those who ride with the Bairds have their share, and more, of it. If you like to stop here a day or two, I will take <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to William Baird, or {{to one of his}} sons, if I find a chance; but I cannot take you up there, now. At the best of times they are not fond of visitors, and would be less so than usual, now." ...|$|E
60|$|Har. Jun. I hear my siren's voice, I cannot stir from hence.--Dear friend, if thou wilt e'er oblige me, {{divert the}} company a little, and give me <b>opportunity</b> <b>a</b> while <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> alone with her.|$|R
50|$|Kimmy is {{also given}} <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> by Xanthippe <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about her {{experience}} as a mole woman on her show, Profiles. Kimmy considers it, but realizes {{she does not want}} to and leaves the episode after introducing Titus.|$|R
6000|$|John {{had found}} <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> of <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> young {{lady in the}} breakfast-room, and had told her of his deeds. [...] "I only left London on Tuesday night, and I have come here taking Venice on the road." ...|$|R
60|$|That {{evening the}} girl asked {{permission}} to go on deck. She said that she felt the effects of long confinement below, and I readily granted her request. I could not understand her, and I craved <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> with her again {{in an effort to}} fathom her and her intentions, and so I {{made it a point to}} follow her up the ladder. It was a clear, cold, beautiful night. The sea was calm except for the white water at our bows and the two long radiating swells running far off into the distance upon either hand astern, forming a great V which our propellers filled with choppy waves. Benson was in the tower, we were bound for San Diego and all looked well.|$|E
60|$|What showed itself {{especially}} in this interview was her tenderness for all young people. She had often enquired after mine; asked about their characters, habits, and tastes; and on this occasion she found <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> with each one separately, and to make them all feel at ease, so {{that they were able}} to talk with her. She seemed interested to point out to them what they should see and study in London; and the charm of her conversation left on their minds an impression that subsequent years have never effaced. I record this incident, because it shows how little Lady Byron assumed the privileges or had the character of an invalid absorbed in herself, and likely to brood over her own woes and wrongs.|$|E
6000|$|His {{brother did}} not come from London for five or six days, and it was two days more before he got <b>an</b> <b>{{opportunity}}</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> with him; but then getting him by himself he began to talk very close to him about it, and the same evening got an opportunity (for we had a long conference together) to repeat all their discourse to me, which, as near as I can remember, was to the purpose following. He told him he heard strange news of him since he went, viz. that he made love to Mrs. Betty. 'Well, says his brother a little angrily, 'and so I do. And what then? What has anybody to do with that?' 'Nay,' says his brother, 'don't be angry, Robin; I don't pretend {{to have anything to do}} with it; nor do I pretend to be angry with you about it. But I find they do concern themselves about it, and that they have used the poor girl ill about it, which I should take as done to myself.' 'Whom do you mean by THEY?' says Robin. 'I mean my mother and the girls,' says the elder brother. 'But hark ye,' says his brother, 'are you in earnest? Do you really love this girl? You may be free with me, you know.' 'Why, then,' says Robin, 'I will be free with you; I do love her above all the women in the world, and I will have her, let them say and do what they will. I believe the girl will not deny me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, sir, I {{shall have}} <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> of <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> you, later on. I, as you see, am engaged in {{precisely}} the same work as you are; namely, in ascertaining, for myself, {{the state of the}} roads across these mountains." ...|$|R
50|$|In November 2014, Crabb {{started a}} podcast with Leigh Sales called Chat 10 Looks 3. It is {{independent}} of the work they do for other media outlets and is <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> for them <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about books, movies, television, the media and culture.|$|R
30|$|Discussion A stay in an {{intensive}} care unit is <b>a</b> good <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about advance directives {{because of the lack}} of opportunities and all the more since those patients have a high risk to be hospitalized again in the next few months. In interviews, treating physicians admit that the talk about advance directives is often too late in the evolution of diseases. One of the reasons for the unpopularity about advance directives: physicians aren’t bind by them in the French law, but they are asked to take them into account for medical decisions.|$|R
50|$|Part 1 {{is a short}} {{conversation}} with the examiner. The examiner asks {{a series of questions}} which give candidates <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about themselves.|$|E
50|$|He {{is proud}} of having been built at Doncaster and {{his work on the}} East Coast Main Line in his youth. Therefore, he never misses <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about his Doncaster {{brothers}} and cousins from the London and North Eastern Railway. He arrived on Sodor in 1923.|$|E
5000|$|Prior to the battle, Caesar and Ariovistus held a parley. [...] Ariovistus' cavalry cast {{stones and}} weapons at the Roman cavalry. [...] Caesar broke off {{negotiations}} and instructed his men not to retaliate {{to prevent the}} Suebi from claiming they were induced into a trap by their accepting <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk.</b>|$|E
50|$|Aside {{from being}} Senior Prefects, sixth form members of each house have the <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> be Link Prefects. This is where {{two members of}} the sixth form are {{allocated}} to one tutor group within the house. They will generally visit the group once a week, usually on a Thursday. This provides a direct link between the pupils and staff and allows the younger members of the house to be able to chat to older members of the house who they perhaps wouldn't have <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> otherwise <b>talk</b> <b>to.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Throughout the series, {{the female}} contestants {{participate}} in competitions and are {{selected by the}} men for dates, {{with some of the}} contestants being eliminated at various intervals. Each woman receives a text message of [...] "yes" [...] if any of the men want to keep her in contention or [...] "no" [...] if none of them want to keep her in contention. If the men are undecided, they send a text message for the woman to meet them at the house's swimming pool, where the men have <b>an</b> additional <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her before deciding whether she should stay or go.|$|R
