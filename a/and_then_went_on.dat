5|$|A {{traditional}} superstition that is {{prevalent among}} many of today's NHL players {{is that no}} player should either touch or hoist the Campbell (Western Conference champion) or Prince of Wales (Eastern Conference champion) trophies after they have won the conference playoffs; these players feel that the Stanley Cup is the true championship trophy and thus {{it should be the}} only trophy that they should be hoisting. Instead of touching the conference trophy, the captain of the winning team merely poses (usually looking solemn) with the trophy, and sometimes, the entire team poses as well. There have been other teams, however, that have ignored the superstition and hoisted the conference trophy <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> to win the Cup anyway.|$|E
