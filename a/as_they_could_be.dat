5|$|Fairley was {{acutely aware}} that much {{remained}} unknown about malaria. In particular, {{he was interested in}} the possibility that sulphaguanidine (or a related sulphonamide) might be a causal prophylactic against malaria, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> manufactured in Australia, unlike atebrin and plasmoquine. Fairley decided to establish a unit in Cairns to investigate malaria. The LHQ Medical Research Unit commenced work in June 1943.|$|E
5|$|The United States adopted half-tracks {{in large}} numbers <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> built more quickly and cheaply by {{civilian}} vehicle producers than vehicles from the established armored vehicle manufacturers. The M2 Half Track Car had first been intended as an artillery tractor, but was also used for carrying the machine gun squads of armored infantry regiments and for reconnaissance units until faster and better-armed M8 Greyhound armored cars were available.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the First World War in August 1914, an Expeditionary Force of seven regular divisions was mobilised for service in France. At the same time, the Territorial Force was activated to replace them for home defence duties. The Expeditionary Force represented almost all the regular units stationed in the United Kingdom, but only about half the strength of the regular Army; the remainder was scattered in various stations around the Empire, mainly in India and the Mediterranean. These units were withdrawn as quickly <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> replaced by Indian or Territorial units, and formed into new divisions to reinforce the Expeditionary Force.|$|E

60|$|What {{has taken}} some time to narrate, happened, in fact, {{with the speed of}} light; for so soon as the Duke assumed his {{threatening}} posture, Crawford had thrown himself betwixt him and the object of his vengeance; and the French gentlemen, drawing together <b>as</b> fast <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could,</b> <b>were</b> crowding to the same point.|$|R
5|$|In a {{study of}} risk taking, some types of risk, such as {{physical}} or heroic risk for others' benefit, are viewed more favorably than other types of risk, such as taking drugs. Males and females valued different degrees of heroic risk for mates and same-sex friends. Males valued heroic risk taking by male friends, but preferred less of it in female mates. Females valued heroic risk taking in male mates and less of it in female friends. Females may be attracted to males inclined to physically defend them and their children. Males may prefer heroic risk taking by male friends <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> good allies.|$|E
5|$|In the west, outnumbered and under-equipped US forces—committed in {{piecemeal}} {{fashion as}} rapidly <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> deployed—were repeatedly defeated and pushed south. The 24th Division, the first US division committed, took heavy {{losses in the}} battle for Taejon in mid-July, which they were driven from after heavy fighting. Elements of the 3rd Battalion, 29th Infantry Regiment, newly arrived in the country, were wiped out at Hadong in a coordinated ambush by North Korean forces on July 27, leaving open a pass to the Pusan area. Soon after, Chinju to the west was taken, pushing back the 19th Infantry Regiment and leaving open routes to Pusan. US units were subsequently able to defeat and push back the North Koreans on the flank in the Battle of the Notch on August 2. Suffering mounting losses, the North Korean force on the west flank withdrew for several days to re-equip and receive reinforcements. This granted both sides several days of reprieve to prepare for the attack on the Pusan Perimeter.|$|E
25|$|In the event, {{most of the}} {{overseas}} garrison units were withdrawn as soon <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> replaced with Territorial battalions, and new regular divisions were formed piecemeal in the United Kingdom. None of these units arrived {{in time to see}} service with the Expeditionary Force.|$|E

5|$|King {{argues that}} enslaved {{children}} {{did not have the}} opportunities for childhood and thus, did not have childhoods. Slave children instead worked <b>as</b> soon <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could,</b> <b>were</b> often separated from caregivers and family, and were subject to punishment of many sorts, sometimes no different than those levied on adults. The children's trauma was compared to that of war—enduring abuses, sexual exploitation, inability to protect themselves—and they aged prematurely through these experiences.|$|R
60|$|At this {{unexpected}} question {{the boy looked}} at Matt in amazement, his mouth wide open, and his eyes <b>as</b> big <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> well <b>be.</b>|$|R
25|$|Both {{the disc}} records, and the {{machines}} to play them, were cheaper to mass-produce than {{the products of}} the cylinder system. Disc records were also easier and cheaper to store in bulk, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> stacked, or when in paper sleeves put in rows on shelves like books—packed together more densely than cylinder recordings.|$|E
25|$|His {{attitude}} from August 1914 was a noble one, too noble to be wise. He {{cared for}} the success of the British aims, especially insofar <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> achieved by the Admiralty, and for nothing else. His passion for this aim was pure, self-devoted, and all-devouring. He failed to remember he was a politician.|$|E
25|$|Horse trams, {{a legacy}} of the old private tramway companies, were phased out as soon <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> {{replaced}} by steam or electric traction. The steam trams continued in service for many decades, initially to continue services while installation of electrical infrastructure was still underway, but eventually relegated to non-revenue operations and providing additional capacity at times of heavy loadings.|$|E
50|$|It {{is unclear}} whether those {{locomotives}} were indeed operating under SM01 name, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> have <b>been</b> withdrawn from service before changing naming standards in 1960.|$|R
6000|$|... "You needn't {{worry about}} that," [...] was the cheerful answer. [...] "Things are going just about <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could.</b> There'll <b>be</b> a second adjournment, and then perhaps another." ...|$|R

25|$|By 1947, {{television}} sets, {{most with}} five and seven-inch screens, were selling almost as fast <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> produced. Because of this, Major League teams began televising games and attracted {{a whole new}} audience into ballparks in the process. People who had only casually followed baseball began going to the games in person. In 1948, Major League Baseball's total attendance reached a record high of 21 million.|$|E
25|$|On 18 May 1565, Suleiman the Magnificent laid siege to Malta. By {{the time}} the Ottoman fleet arrived the Knights were as ready <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be.</b> First, the Ottomans {{attacked}} the newly built fort of St. Elmo and after a whole month of fighting the fort was in rubble and the soldiers kept fighting until the Turks ended their lives. After this they started attacking Birgu and the fortifications at Senglea but to no gain.|$|E
25|$|During the 1850s, {{the cost}} of the Transactions to the Society was {{increasing}} again (and would keep doing so {{for the rest of the}} century); illustrations were always the largest outgoing. Illustrations had been a natural and essential aspect of the scientific periodical since the later seventeenth century. Engravings (cut into metal plates) were used for detailed illustrations, particularly where realism was required; while wood-cuts (and, from the early nineteenth century, wood-engravings) were used for diagrams, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> easily combined with letterpress.|$|E
50|$|Kashechewan is policed by the Nishnawbe-Aski Police Service, an Aboriginal-based service. A {{fire at the}} {{detachment}} on January 9, 2006, {{severely injured}} an officer and killed two inmates <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> rescued.|$|R
60|$|Ralph {{was often}} {{down at the}} Rectory, where he was always made welcome, Mr. Withers and his wife being anxious {{to learn as much}} of his {{disposition}} <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could.</b> <b>They</b> <b>were</b> well satisfied with the result.|$|R
5000|$|Due {{to their}} island location, Inchcolm’s {{religious}} buildings are in better condition {{than most of}} those on the mainland <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> so easily destroyed by the [...] "rascally mob" [...] of proactive Reformers.|$|R
25|$|During the Parade of Nations, Dutchman DJ Tiësto {{provided}} the music, {{becoming the first}} DJ ever to spin live at the Olympics. During {{the course of his}} performance the Dutch athletes started dancing in front of the DJ booth and had to be moved on by officials. Tiësto later released a condensed version of the performance on CD titled Parade of the Athletes. In the liner notes, he noted the IOC requested to him that the music not contain any lyrics <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> inadvertently misinterpreted.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally {{draught beer}} came from wooden barrels, also called casks. In the 1950s these {{began to be}} {{replaced}} by metal casks of stainless steel or aluminium, mainly for quality reasons <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> sterilised and the beer was therefore less likely to spoil, but also for economic reasons. An additional benefit of the switch to metal casks was that staling from oxygen in the air could be reduced. Subsequently, in the early 1960s a form of metal cask, known as a keg, was introduced which allowed for more efficient cleaning and filling in the brewery.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} texts have Berrice today, {{as well as}} Bergos for Vergos in {{the same}} list of islands. The Scandiae islands are more of a problem, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> Scandinavia, but other islands had that name as well. Moreover, Procopius says that the earlier name of Scandinavia was Thule {{and that it was}} the home of the Goths. The fact that Pytheas returned from the vicinity of the Baltic favors Procopius's view. The fact that Pytheas lived centuries before the colonization of Iceland and Greenland by European agriculturalists makes them less likely candidates, as Thule was populated and its soil was tilled.|$|E
50|$|RPGamer {{gives the}} game 4 out of 5, making {{note of the}} game's crafting, {{character}} interactions, and graphics as strong points, but felt the main story and music were not <b>as</b> strong <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> have <b>been.</b>|$|R
60|$|The {{children}} had, for {{the most}} part, inherited that precious heirloom of contentment and elasticity, and were as happy in nooks and corners in bedroom, nursery, staircase or kitchen, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> have <b>been</b> in extensive play-rooms and gardens.|$|R
50|$|No digital {{effects are}} used in the film, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> afforded by the production. To achieve the effect of Soraya's head full of writhing snakes, live snakes were glued to a cap worn by actress Pich Chanboramey.|$|R
25|$|John Eves, {{a native}} of Ireland living in Mill Creek Hundred, Delaware, {{is thought to have}} been one of the white men to visit the Greenwood Valley and Little Fishing Creek area in 1770. (One account of this visit {{indicates}} that he purchased a sizable portion of the land he explored in the area from the Indians who had served as his guides on this trek.) Although he returned to Delaware after this initial visit, he returned the following year with his son Thomas and built a log cabin on the property. The entire Eves family arrived the next year, in 1772, and began tilling the fields adjacent to the cabin as soon <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> cleared.|$|E
25|$|The Territorial Army mobilised on the {{outbreak}} of war. The War Office's plan was that the first four newly formed TA LAA regiments would go to France as soon <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> mobilised, {{in order to provide}} AA cover for the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). 51st (Devon) LAA Regiment therefore crossed to France as part of 2nd Anti-Aircraft Brigade (2nd AA Bde). The new LAA regiments were still badly under-equipped for overseas service, having {{only a small number of}} their establishment of Bofors 40 mm guns and a lot of Light machine guns (LMGs), usually old Lewis guns, and a reduced scale of transport for a mobile role. In November 1939, 51st LAA only possessed 12 Bofors and 48 LMGs.|$|E
25|$|The {{new rules}} {{allowing}} document reclassification were outlined in Executive Order 12356. Previously, Executive Order 12065, issued by Jimmy Carter in 1978, had prohibited document reclassification. Executive Order 12356, issued by Ronald Reagan in 1982, eliminated the reclassification prohibition and described {{situations in which}} documents could be reclassified. Released documents could be reclassified as long <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> reasonably recovered (meaning that documents {{available to the public}} at large would not meet this criterion). It also allowed documents requested under the FOIA or Privacy Act to be classified or reclassified provided they met specified requirements (e.g., certain matters related to national security). According to Bamford, he could not be prosecuted under the new rules because of the principle of ex post facto.|$|E
50|$|The Italian {{region of}} Friuli Venezia Giuila ordered 8 ETR 563 5-car units in 2010 for Trenitalia. Four more units were ordered, which {{are able to}} operate into Slovenia and Austria. The units were delayed into service <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> approved.|$|R
50|$|The German and British {{authorities}} gave similar assurances regarding aircraft {{of their}} countries. Aware that the bombs used were British, the British {{pointed out that}} this proved nothing <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> have <b>been</b> taken from captured ordinance and used for precisely that purpose.|$|R
50|$|Lord Haldane, for the Council, {{found that}} the Acts were ultra vires the {{jurisdiction}} of the Parliament of Canada, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> justified under any heading of federal power enumerated in s. 91 of the British North America Act, 1867.|$|R
