5|$|For {{greatest}} {{efficiency and}} best coupling to the room's <b>air</b> <b>volume,</b> subwoofers {{can be placed}} {{in a corner of the}} room, far from large room openings, and closer to the listener. This is possible since low bass frequencies have a long wavelength; hence there is little difference between the information reaching a listener's left and right ears, and so they cannot be readily localized. All low frequency information is sent to the subwoofer. However, unless the sound tracks have been carefully mixed for a single subwoofer channel, it's possible to have some cancellation of low frequencies if bass information in one channel is out of phase with another.|$|E

40|$|Air-breathing divers {{are limited}} {{not only by}} a limited oxygen supply, and by {{pressure}} changes with depth (Boyd, 1997; Butler, 2001; Jones et al., 1988), {{but also by the}} need to carry <b>air</b> <b>volumes</b> underwater.

40|$|Some {{plants and}} animals feature superhydrophobic {{surfaces}} capable of retaining a layer of air when submerged under water. Long-term air retaining surfaces (Salvinia-effect) are of high interest for biomimetic applications like drag reduction in ship coatings of up to 30 %. Here we present a novel method for measuring <b>air</b> <b>volumes</b> and <b>air</b> loss under water. We recorded the buoyancy force of the air layer on leaf surfaces of four different Salvinia species and on one biomimetic surface using a highly sensitive custom made strain gauge force transducer setup. The <b>volume</b> of <b>air</b> held by a surface was quantified by comparing the buoyancy force of the specimen with and then without an <b>air</b> layer. <b>Air</b> <b>volumes</b> retained by the Salvinia -surfaces ranged between 0. 15 and 1 L/m 2 depending on differences in surface architecture. We verified the precision of the method by comparing the measured <b>air</b> <b>volumes</b> with theoretical volume calculations and could find a good agreement between both values. In this context we present techniques to calculate <b>air</b> <b>volumes</b> on surfaces with complex microstructures. The introduced method also allows to measure decrease or increase of air layers with high accuracy in real-time to understand dynamic processes...|$|R
25|$|Dry suits pose {{their own}} unique {{problems}} compared to wet suit diving, due to the complex construction and since a diver needs to constantly manage and adjust the <b>air</b> <b>volume</b> inside the suit. During descent, air must be added to maintain constant volume. This prevents suit squeeze, loss of neutral buoyancy, and potential uncontrolled descent. During ascent, the air added at depth must be removed again, {{in order to prevent}} over-inflation, excessive buoyancy, and potential uncontrolled ascent. Most modern dry suits are equipped with adjustable spring-loaded automatic exhaust valves, which can assist with this problem when properly set.|$|E
25|$|Modern EMSs read in {{data from}} various sensors about the {{crankshaft}} position, intake manifold temperature, {{intake manifold pressure}} (or intake <b>air</b> <b>volume),</b> throttle position, fuel mixture via the oxygen sensor, detonation via a knock sensor, and exhaust gas temperature sensors. The EMS then uses the collected data to precisely determine how much fuel to deliver and when and how far to advance the ignition timing. With electronic ignition systems, individual cylinders can have their own individual timing so that timing can be as aggressive as possible per cylinder without fuel detonation. As a result, sophisticated electronic ignition systems can be both more fuel efficient, and produce better performance over their counterparts.|$|E

50|$|Early {{experimentation}} with pull-through systems began by removing sources of high-pressure drop, such as tower dryers.

2500|$|Both {{available}} engines used a Bosch Motronic fully electronic {{engine control}} unit (ECU), with cylinder bank selective knock control, dual-barrel throttle valve, lambda mixture control via intake <b>air</b> <b>volume</b> metering and exhaust gas temperature sensor, and required unleaded petrol. Fuel was delivered to the combustion chambers via eight intake manifold-sited electronic fuel injectors, fed from two common fuel rails (one per cylinder bank), and were sequentially 'fired' or activated {{in accordance with the}} engine's firing order. [...] Whilst the 3.6V8 was able to use 95RON (91AKI) fuel, for the 4.2V8, the more expensive 98RON (93AKI) 'SuperPlus' unleaded was required in order to achieve the quoted power output. The usage of 95RON in the 4.2V8 resulted in a lower power output, as well as increased fuel consumption.|$|E
2500|$|Early sauropodomorphs, {{including}} the group traditionally called [...] "prosauropods", {{may also have}} had air sacs. Although possible pneumatic indentations {{have been found in}} Plateosaurus and Thecodontosaurus, the indentations are very small. One study in 2007 concluded that prosauropods likely had abdominal and cervical air sacs, based on the evidence for them in sister taxa (theropods and sauropods). The study concluded {{that it was impossible to}} determine whether prosauropods had a bird-like flow-through lung, but that the air sacs were almost certainly present. A further indication for the presence of air sacs and their use in lung ventilation comes from a reconstruction of the air exchange volume (the volume of air exchanged with each breath) of Plateosaurus, which when expressed as a ratio of <b>air</b> <b>volume</b> per body weight at 29nbsp&ml/kg is similar to values of geese and other birds, and much higher than typical mammalian values.|$|E
2500|$|The smaller {{cylinders}} {{which have}} a combined first and second stage regulator directly mounted into the cylinder neck thread are generally known as [...] "Spare Air" [...] after the commercially supplied unit of that name. These can provide {{a limited number of}} breaths for an out-of-air emergency and are suitable for relatively shallow dives without decompression. [...] The smaller 1.7cuft Spare Air provides approximately 30 breaths, and the larger 3.0cuft approximately 60 breaths at surface pressure. The number of breaths provided in practice will depend on the diver's lung capacity, depth, exertion and state of mind. An ascent from [...] at a recommended rate of [...] and a typical residual minute volume of 15 litres per minute for a fairly relaxed diver would use approximately 60 litres of free <b>air</b> (<b>volume</b> at surface pressure - approximately 2.1cuft.) For some dive profiles this may be adequate. The manufacturers recommend these cylinders for use within recreational diving limits and suggest that very little training is required in their use.|$|E
