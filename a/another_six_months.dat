5|$|Cadets in the Pakistan Navy {{undertake}} {{an initial}} 18months' {{training at the}} Pakistan Naval Academy. They study humanities, engineering, professional and technical subjects. After passing out they are appointed midshipmen, and undertake <b>another</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> of training at sea. They are assigned to operations, weapons engineering, mechanical engineering, or logistics. After passing the final fleet examination, they are promoted {{to the rank of}} sub-lieutenant.|$|E
5|$|Females {{lay between}} three and seven pale bluish-green, brown-blotched eggs. Incubation is about 18 to 21 days, by the female only. However, the male may stand or crouch over the young, {{sheltering}} but not actually brooding them. Young fledge at 35 to 42 days, and are fed by both parents. They stay with their parents for <b>another</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> after fledging.|$|E
5|$|On {{his return}} from National Service in 1962 Dibnah {{retrieved}} his tools from storage, bought a 1927 350cc AJS motorcycle for 21guineas and looked for more work. Bolton, however, {{was in the midst}} of post-industrial decline; between 1957 and 1965 about 70mills were closed in the town, leaving only 37mills operational and about 50disused. Initially he was unable to find much work and existed on smaller, domestic jobs, until he earned enough to buy his own set of ladders and secured his first commission while working at a local mill. He was paid £140 to point a mill tower, which he did at weekends. He struggled, however, to get any more meaningful work, until he met Lonsdale Bonner, one of his teachers from art college. The two agreed a deal whereby Bonner would be paid a commission for each job he got for Dibnah. His first job was dismantling a chimney alongside the Manchester and Bolton Railway, a difficult proposition, as a mistake could force the temporary closure of the railway. The two managed to gain commissions for several jobs, but their relationship was terminated when Dibnah was called upon to undertake <b>another</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> of National Service.|$|E
50|$|Zain is Jade's second husband. He {{does not}} intend to marry Jade at first, but after getting to know her and {{developing}} feelings for her, he changed his mind and asked Jade to stay with him for <b>another</b> <b>six</b> <b>month.</b>|$|R

5|$|Dyer was {{a popular}} choice with boxing promoters, helped {{by the fact that}} after each bout he would sing Thora, a popular hit of the day to the audience. His careers as a pugilist and {{baritone}} earned him the nickname, 'The Singing Boxer'. His first few bouts were all held in south Wales, but by the autumn of 1910 he was travelling to England to fight, and on 10 October 1910 he was invited to fight at the National Sporting Club in Covent Garden, London. On 15 May 1911 Dyer was scheduled to fight Dick Emden at The Ring in Blackfriars, London. To date, Dyer had recorded over 15 bouts and was unbeaten but the fight with Emden ended in defeat and affected his future boxing career. Dyer was easily ahead in the bout, when in the fifth round he dislocated his knee and fell to the canvas in agony. Emden, who taunted the fallen Dyer, was given the victory and Dyer would not fight for <b>another</b> <b>six</b> <b>months.</b> The injury to his right knee plagued Dyer throughout his entire boxing career, and also stopped him serving in the armed forces during the First World War. After the injury, Dyer always fought with a protector strapped around his knee, and was forced to change his fighting style. He would always stand on the toes of his right foot, as a quick back step could possibly dislocate his knee again. His return bout in November 1911 was a win against Young Lilley at The Ring, but this was again followed by a long absence. Dyer did not fight again until 1 June 1912.|$|E
5|$|Key staff {{recruited}} {{to work at}} Fort Halstead included John Challens, who commenced on 1 January 1948. By mid-1948, {{it became clear that}} Penney's initial estimate that he would require 220 staff was wide of the mark, and that he would need nearly 500. This meant not only taking personnel from other projects, but scrapping some entirely. In October 1948, Penney submitted a request for developing a new, separate site for HER on grounds of safety, security and economy. This was approved, but it took <b>another</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> to locate a suitable site. An airbase, RAF South Cerney in Gloucestershire was chosen, but the RAF refused to relinquish the site. A former airbase, RAF Aldermaston, was then selected. At the same time, it was decided to separate HER from the Armaments Research Establishment (ARE). This resulted in a painful bureaucratic battle over personnel like Challens, whose expertise was wanted for research on both nuclear weapons and guided missiles. In the end, HER kept 25 of the 30 key personnel that ARE wanted, including Challens. The site was taken over on 1 April 1950. Penney became Chief Superintendent High Explosive Research (CSHER). The first stage of work at Aldermaston was completed in December 1951, but the plutonium processing building was only handed over in April 1952, the month that the first plutonium was due to arrive from Windscale. At the peak of construction in 1953, over 4,000 personnel were working on the site.|$|E
25|$|Henry Cow {{agreed to}} disband as a {{permanent}} group, but did not announce the fact immediately.

50|$|His {{return from}} this injury only lasted 23 minutes {{as he was}} injured playing for the {{reserves}} in March 2014, this required surgery which set him back for <b>another</b> <b>six</b> to nine <b>months.</b>|$|R
50|$|On 31 August 1989, the Council of State {{dissolved}} the National Assembly, named {{a provisional}} government headed by ex-Attorney General Francisco Rodríguez, {{and announced that}} he would consider holding <b>another</b> election in <b>six</b> <b>months.</b>|$|R
25|$|Lowe {{had surgery}} to remove the {{affected}} lung tissue and underwent <b>another</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> of recuperation. Eighteen months passed before he was able start work again.

25|$|Before {{beginning}} his internship, {{he said he}} first wanted some actual hospital experience to gain more confidence {{and he took a}} job at a hospital in St Albans, where his mother had worked as an emergency surgeon during the war. He then did his six-month internship at Middlesex Hospital's medical unit, followed by <b>another</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> in its neurological unit. He completed his internship in June 1960, but was uncertain about his future.|$|E
25|$|Charles’ {{dream of}} revenge against the Confederates ended that day. Although he would doggedly {{struggle}} for <b>another</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> against his foes, his defeat at Morat really spelled {{the beginning of}} the end for the Duchy of Burgundy, much to the delight of the duke's enemies. Charles escaped to Morges, and then to Pontarlier, where he stayed for months, reportedly in a deep depression. He later returned to the battlefield at the Battle of Nancy, where he was killed.|$|E
50|$|Founded by Li Shau-kee, {{the company}} was taken public in 1981 by Sun Hung Kai Securities. The shares were {{introduced}} at HK$4 by a novel, geared, method - {{there was to be}} an initial downpayment of HK$1 per share upon subscribing to the offer, with cash calls of <b>another</b> HK$1 <b>six</b> <b>months</b> later. The final HK$2 instalment would be due at the year end.|$|R
50|$|In 1920 {{he went to}} the University of Vienna, {{where he}} studied {{chemistry}} for one year and astronomy for <b>another.</b> After <b>six</b> <b>months</b> of mandatory apprenticeship done home in Hungary, he was admitted to the Technical University of Berlin, where he studied mechanical and then electrical engineering. Eventually he started his own experiments in physics, where he was adopted as a student by Professor Richard Becker in 1928. In 1932 he completed his doctorate on the fracture of mica.|$|R
5000|$|Henry Colin Campbell (died April 18, 1930), aka The Torch Murderer, was {{executed}} by the State of New Jersey {{for the murder of}} Mildred Mowry, whom he met through a personal ad placed with a [...] "matrimonial agency." [...] A career criminal and bigamist whose previous crimes were non-violent, Campbell married Mowry in 1929 despite having <b>another</b> wife. <b>Six</b> <b>months</b> after marrying Mowry, Campbell murdered her to collect on a $1,000 investment she owned and burned her corpse.|$|R
25|$|The {{battle of}} Memphis was, {{aside from the}} later {{appearance}} of the ironclad CSS Arkansas, the final challenge to the federal thrust down the Mississippi River against Vicksburg. The river was now open down to that city, which was already besieged by Farragut's ships, but the federal army authorities did not grasp the strategic importance of the fact for nearly <b>another</b> <b>six</b> <b>months.</b> Not until November 1862 would the Union Army under Ulysses S. Grant attempt to complete {{the opening of the}} river.|$|E
25|$|Responding to the request, a {{force of}} local natives was raised and led by Brooke managed to {{temporarily}} stop the rebellion. Brooke was granted a large quantity of antimony from the local mines and authority in the Sarawak River as a reward. Since then, Brooke became embroiled in Hashim's campaign to restore order in the area. Brooke returned to Singapore and spent <b>another</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> cruising along the coasts of the Celebes Islands before returning to Sarawak on 29 August 1840.|$|E
25|$|Consolidated Vultee Aircraft Corporation (later Convair) and Boeing Aircraft Company {{took part}} in the competition, with Consolidated winning a tender on 16 October 1941. Consolidated asked for a $15 million {{contract}} with $800,000 for research and development, mockup, and tooling. Two experimental bombers were proposed, the first to be delivered in 30 months, and the second within <b>another</b> <b>six</b> <b>months.</b> Originally designated Model B-35, the name was changed to B-36 to avoid confusion with the Northrop YB-35 piston-engined flying wing bomber, against which the B-36 was meant to compete for a production contract.|$|E
50|$|Another {{group that}} {{added to the}} ranks of the White Water Shakers were {{followers}} of William Miller. He predicted the exact moment in April 1843 for Christ's Second Coming. People wound up their earthly affairs, dressed in ascension robes, and waited. Miller set <b>another</b> date <b>six</b> <b>months</b> later, but that final judgment day passed, too. His disappointed followers, the Millerites or Second Adventists, were courted by the Shakers who convinced the Millerites that the Shakers had already experienced the Second Coming in a spiritual sense.|$|R
50|$|In October 1971, {{there was}} an {{incident}} with prisoners refusing {{to return to their}} cells. They were protesting over low gratuity payments. A riot was avoided, with the situation resolved after half an hour. However, both Director Colin Campbell and the Jail Officers' Union were, in January 1972, worried that overcrowding could result in <b>another</b> riot within <b>six</b> <b>months.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the grow-out phase, {{the shrimp}} are grown to maturity. The postlarvae are {{transferred}} to ponds {{where they are}} fed until they reach marketable size, which takes about <b>another</b> three to <b>six</b> <b>months.</b> Harvesting the shrimp is done by fishing them from the ponds using nets or by draining the ponds. Pond sizes {{and the level of}} technical infrastructure vary.|$|R

After reaching the cap, qualifying PEVs for one quarter still earn the full credit, the second quarter after that quarter PEVS are eligible for 50% of the credit for six months, then 25% of the credit for <b>another</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> and finally the credit is phased out.|$|E
25|$|The {{song was}} written in October 1968, {{intended}} for the album The Beatles, but left off because of time constraints. It was rehearsed again three months later, in January 1969, at Twickenham film studios during the Get Back sessions but would not be recorded for <b>another</b> <b>six</b> <b>months.</b> The film features two brief rehearsal takes compiled together showing the band's progress on the song {{up to that point}} in time. Lennon is shown to be participating on electric guitar despite not featuring on the recording for Abbey Road at all. Road manager and Beatles associate Mal Evans participates by providing the anvil hits.|$|E
25|$|Australia {{ended the}} subcontinental {{part of the}} tour with victory over Ceylon by an innings and 44 runs. Not wanting to wait {{a month for the}} next boat and a fortnight's sea voyage, the Australians {{returned}} to Perth by hitching a ride on a B-24 Liberator. The pilot of the RAAF plane had already promised 14 friends a lift so {{that they would not be}} stuck in India for <b>another</b> <b>six</b> <b>months,</b> so the Australian team sat on the floor of the aircraft. They made it back to Australia despite suffering engine trouble and an overloaded plane.|$|E
50|$|Haggard {{wrote the}} novel {{as a result of}} a five-shilling wager with his brother, namely whether he could write a novel half as good as Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island (1883). He wrote it in a short time, somewhere between six and sixteen weeks between January and 21 April 1885. However, the book was a {{complete}} novelty and was rejected by one publisher after <b>another.</b> After <b>six</b> <b>months,</b> King Solomon's Mines was published, and the book became the year's best seller; the only problem was how to print copies fast enough (much to the chagrin of those who had rejected the manuscript).|$|R
50|$|Nick {{goes back}} to barbering and raises <b>another</b> stake. <b>Six</b> <b>months</b> later, he tracks down Sleepy Sam and his gang in another city. He proposes a {{one-on-one}} game, each man putting up $50,000 and playing until one man has all the money. Sam accepts. Nick insists on sending out for fresh decks of cards, just to be safe. When Nick wins and tries to leave, the con artists reach for their guns, but Jack and another man burst in with their guns already drawn. Nick then gloats, pointing out that he simply cheated better than Sam by using shaved cards.|$|R

25|$|Askin enlisted as a Private in the Second Australian Imperial Force on 30 March 1942. An {{instructor}} {{with the}} 14th Infantry Training Battalion at Dubbo, {{he was appointed}} Acting Corporal, then reverted to Private. In November 1942 he joined the 2/31st Infantry Battalion in New Guinea, where he served for two months. He was in New Guinea for <b>another</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> from July 1943. Landing at Balikpapan, Borneo, in July 1945, Askin was promoted to Sergeant under Lieutenant Colonel Murray Robson. When hostilities ceased, he unsuccessfully attempted {{to set up an}} import business in Bandjermasin. Returning to Australia in February 1946, he was demobilised on 22 March.|$|E
25|$|Special Constables {{have existed}} in Wiltshire since their {{definition}} was finalised under the Special Constable Act, but were historically {{looked down on}} as 'hobby bobbies'. After going {{through a period of}} neglect during the 1990s and early 2000s, the National Policing Improvement Agency implemented the national strategy for Specials recruitment, training and development. After setting targets to recruit 100 Specials a year, Wiltshire's Special Constabulary currently has roughly 250 officers and is still recruiting. The selection process lasts up to six months. The training programme is <b>another</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> and takes place at headquarters in Devizes. All Special Constables are required to complete a two-year probationary period.|$|E
25|$|The Mormon Battalion {{arrived in}} San Diego on January 29, 1847 after a march of some 1,900 miles from Iowa. For {{the next five}} months until their {{discharge}} on July 16, 1847 in Los Angeles, the battalion trained and also performed occupation duties in several locations in southern California. The most significant service the battalion provided in California was as a reliable unit under Cooke that General Kearny could rely on to block Fremont's mutinous bid to control California. The construction of Fort Moore was one measure that Cooke employed to protect legitimate military and civil control under Kearny. Some 22 Mormon men died from disease or other natural causes during their service. About 80 of the men re-enlisted for <b>another</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> of service.|$|E
50|$|The sexes are {{separate}} in Listriolobus pelodes. The gonads are located beside the anal vesicles and liberate gametes into the coelum or body cavity. Here they mature and are then {{stored in the}} nephridia before being liberated into the sea in the late winter or spring. After fertilisation, the eggs hatch into planktonic trochophore larvae. After several developmental stages {{over a period of}} about <b>six</b> <b>months,</b> the larvae settle on the seabed and undergo metamorphosis into juvenile spoon worms. They seem to be attracted to settle in areas of fine, nutrient-rich sediment but the mechanism for this discrimination is unclear. The juveniles become sexually mature in <b>another</b> <b>six</b> to twelve <b>months.</b>|$|R
50|$|On March 31, 1985 {{the group}} within Knight Ridder {{responsible}} for developing Viewtron wrote Knight Ridder's {{board of directors}} advocating a new direction, one that pursued business and personal computer applications. The memo recommended lowering the monthly price of the service, discontinuing the AT&T terminal to concentrate on home computer development, and conducting <b>another</b> review in <b>six</b> <b>months.</b> The memo pointed out that this direction was preferable because it would compete with the newspapers less than the existing service.|$|R
40|$|It {{was eight}} months before launch when my second Flight Operations Team lead {{said he was}} leaving the project for <b>another</b> job. <b>Six</b> <b>months</b> earlier, the {{original}} lead had said he was leaving. I was stunned [...] but I remained confident that we would recover. I didn't expect to lose the second lead. After all, lightning {{is not supposed to}} strike twice in the same place. This time, with only eight months until launch, I was very much concerned. No, 'concerned' is probably too mild a word. Let's get it right: I was sweating. Losing a lead at any stage presents problems, but two losses within 6 months of each other can definitely shake the confidence of an inexperienced Flight Ops Team...|$|R
