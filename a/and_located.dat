30|$|We had {{a number}} of {{predictions}} about people’s ability to detect <b>and</b> <b>locate</b> manipulations in real-world photos. We expected the type of manipulation—implausible versus plausible—to affect people’s ability to detect <b>and</b> <b>locate</b> manipulations. In particular, people should correctly identify more of the physically implausible manipulations than the physically plausible manipulations given the availability of evidence within the photo. We also expected people to be better at correctly detecting <b>and</b> <b>locating</b> manipulations that caused more change to the pixels in the photo than manipulations that caused less change.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—RFID {{technology}} {{being applied}} for the field of tracking <b>and</b> <b>locating</b> application faces many challenges. In order to solve the problem, we design and construct a model of RFID-based tracking <b>and</b> <b>locating</b> system {{which is based on}} complex event processing, that is BCEPS model. BCEPS model consists of physical device layer, RFID data processing layer, event processing engine, application layer and data storage layer. BCEPS model filters the RFID data which is gathered in real time and then generates RFID events. At the same time, BCEPS model responses to the requirement coming from users and then generates user events. RFID and user events are sent to event processing engine and are processed. Finally, results are returned to users. To enhance the efficiency of processing massive events and the real-time performance of system, we first propose and design the real-time event scheduling algorithm for event processing engine. Finally, we verify BCEPS model by implementing RFID-based tracking <b>and</b> <b>locating</b> system in underground mine which uses the time-shifting tracking <b>and</b> <b>locating</b> algorithm which is designed by ourselves. Index Terms—RFID, complex event processing, BCEPS model system, PTSA event scheduling algorithm, TSTLA tracking <b>and</b> <b>locating</b> algorithm I...|$|R

5|$|Also {{on display}} is a burden basket created by basketmaker Sophie George {{in the design}} of the baskets used by the Kalapuya, the Native American tribe that {{formerly}} inhabited the Tualatin Valley. As few members of the Kalapuya remain and none had the knowledge of how to make the basket, George visited the British Museum to find an example of a basket in order to design the replica. A bronze cast was created and is displayed at Hillsboro Central. The station also includes a weather vane, one of a series of eight on the Westside MAX. Designed by Keith Jellum <b>and</b> <b>located</b> on the roof of the station building, the vane resembles old train signals. Constructed of bronze, the semaphore signals stop and approach.|$|E
5|$|Another {{possibility}} is that a gene for aposematism might be recessive <b>and</b> <b>located</b> on the X chromosome. If so, predators would learn to associate the colour with unpalatability from males with the trait, while heterozygous females carry the trait until it becomes common and predators understand the signal. Well-fed predators might also ignore aposematic morphs, preferring other prey species.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} on September21 Harvey {{accelerated}} slightly and turned southeastward. Although {{the center of}} the storm was poorly defined at the time <b>and</b> <b>located</b> to the northwest of the main area of thunderstorm activity, convection was strong in nature.

The storm further accelerated across the Florida Peninsula and quickly merged with a developing storm off the coast of South Carolina at 0600UTC on September22. Although the remnants of Harvey became unidentifiable later that day, Environment Canada reported that the system crossed Newfoundland before dissipating on September24.|$|E
