5|$|The {{number of}} protons and {{neutrons}} in the atomic nucleus can be modified, although this can require very high energies {{because of the}} strong force. Nuclear fusion occurs when multiple atomic particles join to form a heavier nucleus, such as through the energetic collision of two nuclei. For example, {{at the core of}} the Sun protons require energies of 3–10 keV to overcome their mutual repulsion—the coulomb barrier—and fuse together into a single nucleus. Nuclear fission is the opposite process, causing <b>a</b> <b>nucleus</b> to split into two smaller nuclei—usually through radioactive decay. The nucleus can also be modified through bombardment by high energy subatomic particles or photons. If this modifies the number of protons in <b>a</b> <b>nucleus,</b> the atom changes to a different chemical element.|$|E
40|$|The spin–lattice {{relaxation}} time, T 1, for 69 Ga, 71 Ga, and 75 <b>As</b> <b>nuclei</b> in GaAs:Mn 2 + single crystals {{was measured}} {{as a function}} of temperature. The values of T 1 for 69 Ga, 71 Ga, and 75 <b>As</b> <b>nuclei</b> were found to decrease with increasing temperature. The T 1 values in GaAs:Mn 2 + crystal are similar to those in pure GaAs crystal. The cal-culated activation energies for the 69 Ga, 71 Ga, and 75 <b>As</b> <b>nuclei</b> are 4. 34, 4. 07, and 3. 99 kJ/mol.

5|$|A direct {{relativistic}} effect {{is that as}} atomic numbers of elements increase, the innermost electrons begin to revolve faster around the nucleus {{as a result of}} the increase of the electromagnetic attraction between an electron and <b>a</b> <b>nucleus.</b> Similar effects have been found for s orbitals (and p1/2 ones, though this is not quite applicable for dubnium): for example, the 7s orbital is contracted by 25% in size and stabilized by 2.6 eV.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>nucleus</b> {{typically}} contains between 1 and 10 compact structures called Cajal bodies or coiled bodies (CB), whose diameter measures between 0.2µm and 2.0µm {{depending on}} the cell type and species. When seen under an electron microscope, they resemble balls of tangled thread and are dense foci of distribution for the protein coilin. CBs {{are involved in a}} number of different roles relating to RNA processing, specifically small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) and small nuclear RNA (snRNA) maturation, and histone mRNA modification.|$|E
5|$|All the bound {{protons and}} {{neutrons}} in an atom {{make up a}} tiny atomic nucleus, and are collectively called nucleons. The radius of <b>a</b> <b>nucleus</b> is approximately equal to 1.07fm, where A is {{the total number of}} nucleons. This is much smaller than the radius of the atom, which is on the order of 105fm. The nucleons are bound together by a short-ranged attractive potential called the residual strong force. At distances smaller than 2.5 fm this force is much more powerful than the electrostatic force that causes positively charged protons to repel each other.|$|E
40|$|Line-tension-induced {{scenario}} of heterogeneous nucleation is studied for <b>a</b> lens-shaped <b>nucleus</b> with <b>a</b> finite contact angle nucleated on a spherical substrate {{and on the}} bottom of the wall of a spherical cavity. The effect of line tension on the free energy of <b>a</b> critical <b>nucleus</b> can be separated from the usual volume term. By comparing the free energy of <b>a</b> lens-shaped critical <b>nucleus</b> of <b>a</b> finite contact angle with that of <b>a</b> spherical <b>nucleus,</b> we find that <b>a</b> spherical <b>nucleus</b> may have <b>a</b> lower free energy than <b>a</b> lens-shaped <b>nucleus</b> when the line tension is positive and large, which is similar to the drying transition predicted by Widom [B. Widom, J. Phys. Chem. 99 2803 (1995) ]. Then, the homogeneous nucleation rather than the heterogeneous nucleation will be favorable. Similarly, the free energy of <b>a</b> lens-shaped <b>nucleus</b> becomes negative when the line tension is negative and large. Then, the barrier-less nucleation with no thermal activation called athermal nucleation will be realized. Comment: 13 pages, 13 figures, Journal of Chemical Physics to be publishe...|$|R

50|$|Deuterium fusion, {{also called}} {{deuterium}} burning, is a nuclear fusion reaction {{that occurs in}} stars and some substellar objects, in which <b>a</b> deuterium <b>nucleus</b> and <b>a</b> proton combine to form <b>a</b> helium-3 <b>nucleus.</b> It occurs as {{the second stage of}} the proton-proton chain reaction, in which <b>a</b> deuterium <b>nucleus</b> formed from two protons fuses with another proton, but can also proceed from primordial deuterium.|$|R
5|$|Domains are a {{relatively}} new grouping. First proposed in 1977, Carl Woese's three-domain system was not generally accepted until later. One main characteristic of the three-domain method is the separation of Archaea and Bacteria, previously grouped into the single kingdom Bacteria (a kingdom also sometimes called Monera), with the Eukaryota for all organisms whose cells contain <b>a</b> <b>nucleus.</b> A small number of scientists include a sixth kingdom, Archaea, but do not accept the domain method.|$|E
5|$|Every atom is {{composed}} of <b>a</b> <b>nucleus</b> and one or more electrons bound to the nucleus. The nucleus is made {{of one or more}} protons and typically a similar number of neutrons. Protons and neutrons are called nucleons. More than 99.94% of an atom's mass is in the nucleus. The protons have a positive electric charge, the electrons have a negative electric charge, and the neutrons have no electric charge. If the number of protons and electrons are equal, that atom is electrically neutral. If an atom has more or fewer electrons than protons, then it has an overall negative or positive charge, respectively, and it is called an ion.|$|E
5|$|For atoms {{with low}} atomic numbers, <b>a</b> <b>nucleus</b> {{that has more}} {{neutrons}} than protons tends to drop to a lower energy state through radioactive decay so that the neutron–proton ratio is closer to one. However, as the atomic number increases, {{a higher proportion of}} neutrons is required to offset the mutual repulsion of the protons. Thus, there are no stable nuclei with equal proton and neutron numbers above atomic number Z = 20 (calcium) and as Z increases, the neutron–proton ratio of stable isotopes increases. The stable isotope with the highest proton–neutron ratio is lead-208 (about 1.5).|$|E
50|$|After {{formation}} of the ascus-initial cell, the <b>A</b> and <b>a</b> <b>nuclei</b> fuse {{with each other to}} form <b>a</b> diploid <b>nucleus</b> (see Figure). This nucleus is the only diploid nucleus in the entire life cycle of N. crassa. The diploid nucleus has 14 chromosomes formed from the two fused haploid nuclei that had 7 chromosomes each. Formation of the diploid nucleus is immediately followed by meiosis. The two sequential divisions of meiosis lead to four haploid nuclei, two of the A mating type and two of the a mating type. One further mitotic division leads to four A and four <b>a</b> <b>nuclei</b> in each ascus. Meiosis {{is an essential part of}} the life cycle of all sexually reproducing organisms, and in its main features, meiosis in N. crassa seems typical of meiosis generally.|$|R
5000|$|An {{arbitrary}} {{combination of}} protons and neutrons {{does not necessarily}} yield <b>a</b> stable <b>nucleus.</b> One can think of moving up and/or to the right across the table of nuclides by adding one type of nucleon to <b>a</b> given <b>nucleus.</b> However, adding nucleons {{one at a time}} to <b>a</b> given <b>nucleus</b> will eventually lead to <b>a</b> newly formed <b>nucleus</b> that immediately decays by emitting a proton (or neutron). Colloquially speaking, the nucleon has 'leaked' or 'dripped' out of the nucleus, hence giving rise to the term [...] "drip line".|$|R

5|$|Formed {{for service}} during the World War II, the 2/17th Battalion was raised on 26 April 1940 from Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) volunteers at Ingleburn, New South Wales. With an {{authorised}} strength of around 900 personnel, like other Australian infantry battalions of the time, the 2/17th was formed around <b>a</b> <b>nucleus</b> of four rifle companies– designated 'A' through to 'D'– each consisting of three platoons; these {{were supported by}} a battalion headquarters and a headquarters company with six specialist platoons: signals, pioneer, anti-aircraft, transport, administrative and mortars.|$|E

During this service, she underwent refits at Portsmouth in 1909–1910, during which she received fire control equipment for her main battery, and 1911–1912. From June 1912 to January 1913 she served as a seagoing gunnery training ship at the Nore. In January 1913 she {{was transferred to the}} 3rd Fleet, and was based at Pembroke Dock and Devonport.|$|E

5|$|Other more rare {{types of}} {{radioactive}} decay include ejection of neutrons or protons or clusters of nucleons from <b>a</b> <b>nucleus,</b> {{or more than}} one beta particle. An analog of gamma emission which allows excited nuclei to lose energy in a different way, is internal conversion— a process that produces high-speed electrons that are not beta rays, followed by production of high-energy photons that are not gamma rays. A few large nuclei explode into two or more charged fragments of varying masses plus several neutrons, in a decay called spontaneous nuclear fission.|$|E

He introduced the idea that an electron could drop from a higher-energy orbit to a lower one, in the process emitting a quantum of discrete energy. This became a basis for what is now known as the old quantum theory.|$|E
