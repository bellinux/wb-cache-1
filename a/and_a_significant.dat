5|$|According to the National Development and Reform Commission of China, 366grams of coal {{would produce}} 1kWh of {{electricity}} during 2006. At full power, Three Gorges reduces coal consumption by 31million tonnes per year, avoiding 100million tonnes {{of greenhouse gas}} emissions, millions of tonnes of dust, onemillion tonnes of sulfur dioxide, 370,000tonnes of nitric oxide, 10,000tonnes of carbon monoxide, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> amount of mercury. Hydropower saves the energy needed to mine, wash, and transport the coal from northern China.|$|E
5|$|Although the red-throated loon {{is not a}} {{globally}} threatened species, as it has a {{large population}} <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> range, there are populations which appear to be declining. Numbers counted in U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service surveys in Alaska show a 53% population decline between 1971 and 1993, for example, and survey count numbers have dropped in continental Europe as well. In Scotland, on the other hand, the population increased by some 16% between 1994 and 2006, according to surveys done by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and Scottish Natural Heritage. In 2002, Wetlands International estimated a global population of 490,000 to 1,500,000individuals; global population trends have not been quantified.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, {{improvements}} in regional transport infrastructure precipitated {{the decline of}} Salford's existing industries, including those at the Salford Docks. Increased foreign competition began to undermine the competitiveness of local textile processing businesses. Rising unemployment during the Great Depression of the 1920s and '30s, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> economic decline in the decades following the Second World War contributed toward a fall in Salford's population. By 1939 local coal mining had almost stopped, and cotton spinning had by 1971 ceased completely. Between 1921 and 1939, the population of Salford decreased by 29%, from 234,045 to 166,386, far greater than the rate of decline within the whole of North West England.|$|E
5|$|Early in the 21st century, {{there was}} {{dramatic}} departmental restructuring at the college, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> redevelopment and modernisation of the Hereford campus.

Students live in halls of residence, which enable them to gain a level of independence within the college environment.

This decline includes the cumulative losses from all factors, such as urbanization, pesticide use, tracheal and Varroa mites, and commercial beekeepers' retiring and going out of business. However, in late 2006 and early 2007, the rate of attrition was alleged to have reached new proportions, and people began to use the term colony collapse disorder to describe this sudden rash of disappearances (or sometimes spontaneous hive collapse or the Mary Celeste syndrome in the United Kingdom).|$|E

5|$|Government {{publications}} on {{the dangers}} of sects increased between 1996 and 1998, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> number of them dealt with the Church of Scientology. The German courts had approved such publications in 1989, seeing them as part of the government's responsibility to keep the public informed, and finding that they did not interfere with religious freedom. In 1996, the German parliament launched an Enquete (Enquiry) Commission to investigate sects and similar groups, {{in large part because of}} public concerns about Scientology. Its final report, published in June 1998, concluded that Scientology, alone among new religious movements, required monitoring by Germany's domestic intelligence services.|$|E

All of these vessels were formally taken over by the KSCS at the beginning of March 1921.

Vlastimil Koubek was the architect for the East Building (L'Enfant Plaza Hotel, located at 480 L'Enfant Plaza SW), and for the Center Building (475 L'Enfant Plaza SW; now the United States Postal Service headquarters). The team set out with a broad vision that was praised by both the Washington Post and Washington Star (which rarely agreed on anything), but funding problems forced revisions <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> reduction in scale.|$|E

5|$|The English {{people are}} a British people. Some genetic {{evidence}} suggests that 75–95% descend in the paternal line from prehistoric settlers who originally came from the Iberian Peninsula, {{as well as a}} 5% contribution from Angles and Saxons, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> Scandinavian (Viking) element. However, other geneticists place the Germanic estimate up to half. Over time, various cultures have been influential: Prehistoric, Brythonic, Roman, Anglo-Saxon, Viking (North Germanic), Gaelic cultures, as well as a large influence from Normans. There is an English diaspora in former parts of the British Empire; especially the United States, Canada, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand. Since the late 1990s, many English people have migrated to Spain.|$|E
5|$|The French {{defenders}} of the island were weakened by years of isolation caused by the British blockade. Although the available French troops numbered between 3,000 and 4,000, there was an epidemic on the island <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> proportion of the garrison, principally formed by the 66e Régiment, were unfit for duty.
