5|$|Given {{that these}} {{examples}} are all highly symmetric—and thus simplified—it {{is tempting to}} conclude that the occurrence of singularities is an artifact of idealization. The famous singularity theorems, proved using the methods of global geometry, say otherwise: singularities are a generic feature of general relativity, and unavoidable once the collapse of an object with realistic matter properties has proceeded beyond a certain stage and also {{at the beginning of a}} wide class of expanding universes. However, the theorems say little about the properties of singularities, and much of current research is devoted to characterizing these entities' generic structure (hypothesized e.g. by the BKL conjecture). The cosmic censorship hypothesis states that all realistic future singularities (no perfect symmetries, matter with realistic properties) are safely hidden away behind <b>a</b> <b>horizon,</b> and thus invisible to all distant observers. While no formal proof yet exists, numerical simulations offer supporting evidence of its validity.|$|E

40|$|Characterization of {{the impacts}} of climate change on {{terrestrial}} carbon (C) cycling is important due to possible feedback mechanisms to atmospheric CO 2 concentrations. We investigated soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics in the A 1 and <b>A</b> 2 <b>horizons</b> (~ 0 – 5. 1 and ~ 5. 1 – 12. 3 cm depth, respectively) of a shrubland grass (Deschampsia flexuosa) after 8 years of exposure to: elevated CO 2 (CO 2), summer drought (D), warming (T) and all combinations hereof, with TDCO 2 simulating environmental conditions for Denmark in 2075. The mean C residence time was highest in the heavy fraction (HF), followed by the occluded light fraction and the free light fraction (fLF), and it increased with soil depth, suggesting that C was stabilized on minerals at depth. <b>A</b> 2 <b>horizon</b> SOM was susceptible to climate change whereas <b>A</b> 1 <b>horizon</b> SOM was largely unaffected. The <b>A</b> 2 <b>horizon</b> fLF and HF organic C stocks decreased by 43 and 23 % in response to warming, respectively.

In simpler terms, to refer to an individual's horizon is to refer to an individual's future goals, as informed by their past experiences and personal belief system. Since goals, beliefs, and experiences are plural, there can be horizons within a larger horizon, similar to how there can be multiple thoughts within a core belief in CBT, or how there can be multiple experiences of high school within the overall experience of high school.

40|$|Inputs of DOC in {{precipitation}} {{were low}} and increased {{with the passage}} of rainfall through different canopies. Throughfall, stemflow, leachates from <b>A</b> <b>horizons</b> and litterfall were identified as sources of DOC, while B and C horizons in upland areas provide a sink. Throughfall and stemflow displayed high temporal variability in DOC concentrations, while soil leachates and peat waters exhibited strong seasonal patterns. DOC concentrations in throughfall, stemflow and <b>A</b> <b>horizons</b> were highest in the predominantly coniferous site. In the fall, DOC concentrations from <b>A</b> <b>horizons</b> in the deciduous site were significantly higher than those from the coniferous site. Factors influencing DOC in peat waters are: (1) peat thermal regime, (2) water chemistry, and (3) water table position. Large storms ($>$ 30 mm precipitation) appear to be the primary factor influencing exports of DOC in streamflow, particularly following dry antecedant soil moisture conditions. Slow rates of water movement through compact deep peats ($>$ 60 cm depth) and adsorption of DOC in B and C horizons of this catchment obstruct exports of DOC, which over the 5. 5 month study period, were minimal in comparison to inputs...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} four pedons (three Fulvudands and one Andic Haplorthox) located at high {{elevations}} (2000 - 2400 m a. s. l.) in the Nilgiri Hills {{on an old}} laterized surface of South India, and characterized by thick (50 - 100 cm) epipedons whose colour tends to darken with depth. In two of them, the colour contrast between the top and the bottom <b>A</b> <b>horizons</b> was so well expressed that they were morphologically {{very similar to the}} African Oxisols reported to have sombric subsurface horizons. Soil organic matter (SOM) of the different selected <b>A</b> <b>horizons</b> was characterized by its mean residence time (MRT) and its delta(13) C value, whereas their humic acids (HAs) were examined by techniques that made it possible to determine their chemical composition and their chromatic properties. It was found that the darker colour of the subsurface <b>A</b> <b>horizons</b> of these soils was related to three joined characteristics: a SOM delta(13) C signature indicating a C 4 -type vegetation (i. e. a grassland-type) origin, the presence of humic acids belonging to the A-type (i. e. melanic) category of Kumada (Kurnada, K., 1987. Chemistry of soil organic matter. Developments in Soil Science, Elsevier, Tokyo), and large mean residence time values. In contrast, the top <b>A</b> <b>horizons</b> had <b>a</b> more recent SOM, mainly inherited from a C 3 -type vegetation, and humic acids (HAs) that were less condensed than the A-type HAs. It was also found that where the presence of sombric-like subsurface <b>A</b> <b>horizons</b> was the most evident, the vegetation change recorded by the soils (i. e. the change from a grassland-type vegetation towards a C 3 -type vegetation) was expressed on the thickest part of their epipedon. These observations led us to propose that the occurrence of sombric-like subsurface <b>A</b> <b>horizons</b> resulted from the following sequence of events: (i) an exceptionally thick accumulation of organic matter deriving from grassland followed by (ii) its progressive replacement by less dark organic matter derived from a C 3 -type vegetation. This proposal was found to be in reasonable agreement with the history of the vegetation changes experienced by the Nilgiri Hills {{since the end of the}} Pleistocene. On the other hand, it is also very similar to one of the hypotheses proposed by Van Wambeke (Van Wambeke, A., 1992. Soils of the Tropics-Properties and Appraisal. McGraw-Hill, New York) to explain the frequent occurrence of sombric horizons in the Oxisols and Ultisols of the high-altitude areas of Central Africa. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B. V.

25|$|A fixed {{crossing}} of Hurumlandet and the Oslofjord was first proposed by Anton Grønsand in 1958.

As a {{crossing of}} the Oslofjord invariable would have to cross a county border, plans fell outside the natural planning framework.

Initiated by Hurum Municipality, it was also partially owned by larger companies in the municipality. It attempted to revitalize the proposal and launched a detailed plan in 1974 which called for two bridges which would connect each side of the fjord to the island of Håøya. The cost of the project was steep, the Håøya bridges alone estimated at 510 million 1981 Norwegian krone (NOK). The plans were rejected by the road administration because of the steep cost and low traffic prognosis, while others criticized the environmental impact it would create on Håøya and at the towns of Svelvik and Drøbak.|$|E
