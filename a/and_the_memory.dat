5|$|Remember Me was {{developed}} as the debut project of Dontnod Entertainment, {{with one of}} the company's founding members Jean-Maxime Moris as its director. Part of his goal for the game was to create a thought-provoking narrative, and eventually settled on a female protagonist to help convey the story's themes. Originally a PlayStation 3-exclusive under Sony titled Adrift, it was cancelled in 2011 and later purchased by Capcom which resurrected it as a multiplatform game. General praise was given for the world design, Olivier Deriviere's soundtrack, the ambition of the story <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Memory</b> Remix segments, while the main criticisms laid against other aspects of the story, poor design choices and formulaic combat.|$|E
5|$|The {{controllers}} {{were designed}} to be tough enough to survive the forces of launch, and proved to be extremely resilient to damage. During {{the investigation of the}} Challenger accident the two MECs (from engines 2020 and 2021), recovered from the seafloor, were delivered to Honeywell Aerospace for examination and analysis. One controller was broken open on one side, and both were severely corroded and damaged by marine life. Both units were disassembled <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> units flushed with deionized water. After they were dried and vacuum baked, data from these units was retrieved for forensic examination.|$|E
5|$|The {{senators}} {{responded by}} acknowledging Elagabalus as emperor and accepting {{his claim to}} be the son of Caracalla. Caracalla and Julia Domna were both deified by the Senate, both Julia Maesa and Julia Soaemias were elevated to the rank of Augustae, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> of both Macrinus and Diadumenian was expunged by the Senate. The former commander of the Third Legion, Comazon, was appointed commander of the Praetorian Guard.|$|E

5|$|At {{an unknown}} date, {{which may have}} been in the early 640s, East Anglia was {{attacked}} by a Mercian army and Ecgric was obliged to defend it with a much smaller force, though one that was not negligible. The East Angles appealed to Sigeberht to leave his monastery and lead them in battle, hoping that his presence <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> of his former military exploits would encourage the army and make them less likely to flee. Sigeberht refused, saying that he had renounced his worldly kingdom and now lived only for the heavenly kingdom. However, he was dragged from the monastery to the battlefield where, unwilling to bear arms, he went into battle carrying only a staff. The Mercians were victorious and Sigeberht, Ecgric and many of the East Angles were slain and their army was routed. In this way Sigeberht became a Christian martyr. He is among the names of the kings who according to an ancient saying, were avenged by the slaying of Penda in 654.|$|E

25|$|The five most {{successful}} Flemish films were Loft (2008; 1,186,071 visitors), Koko Flanel (1990; 1,082,000 tickets sold), Hector (1987; 933,000 tickets sold), Daens (1993; 848,000 tickets sold) and De Zaak Alzheimer (2003; 750,000 tickets sold). The {{first and last}} ones were directed by Erik Van Looy, and an American remake is being made of both of them, respectively The Loft (2012) <b>and</b> <b>The</b> <b>Memory</b> of a Killer. The other three ones were directed by Stijn Coninx.|$|E
25|$|In 1937, {{while an}} {{undergraduate}} at Cornell, Arthur Laurents {{was introduced to}} political activism by a student who became the model for Katie Morosky, {{a member of the}} Young Communist League and an outspoken opponent of Francisco Franco and his effort to take control of Spain via the Spanish Civil War.

The registers are the base of all normal operations for X#. A register can be copied to another by writing DST = SRC as opposed to mov or load/store instructions. Registers can be incremented or decremented just as easily. Arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) are written as dest op src where src is a constant, variable, or register, and dest is both an operand and the location where the result is stored.|$|E

25|$|The {{film was}} based on the real events but with {{numerous}} compromises for its commercial appeal, such as including Americans among the escapees (none of whom were actually American). While some characters were fictitious, many were amalgams of and some based on real people. There were no actual escapes by motorcycle or aircraft. Nor were the prisoners executed in one place at the same time. The film has resulted in the story <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> of the fifty executed airmen remaining widely known, if in a distorted form.|$|E
25|$|As a boy, he {{had spent}} one summer at a camp in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains, an {{experience}} he recalled fondly in his later autobiography. The experience <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> began leading him {{to spend some time}} each summer in the countryside outside of the city. Starting in 1929 with a month in Briarcliff Manor, it grew into six months the next year, when Copland and his then-partner Gerard Sykes took up residence in another Westchester County country town, Bedford. During that stay, he finished his early Piano Variations.|$|E
25|$|Born in 1829 Green Flake, {{the slave}} of James Madison Flake, a convert to the LDS Church, was baptized {{at the age}} of 16 on April 7, 1844 by John Brown. He {{accompanied}} the Flake family to Nauvoo, Illinois. Green remained a slave but {{was a member of the}} church throughout his life. From family diaries <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> of a grandson, it is believed that it was Green who drove the carriage and team that brought President Brigham Young into the Salt Lake Valley. Brigham Young freed Flake in 1854.|$|E

25|$|In a {{study by}} Kliegel et al. (2008), it was shown that motivational state {{affected}} performance in two age groups (three-year-olds and five-year-olds) completing the same prospective memory task. There was no difference for the two age groups when motivation was high but performance of the three years old was reduced when motivation was low. If a person considers a task to be unimportant or is affected by fatigue, {{they will not be}} motivated to remember the intention. Less attention will be given to relevant cues <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> {{is more likely to be}} forgotten. Therefore, prospective memory can be enhanced by avoiding low motivational states.|$|E
25|$|The five {{remaining}} members of The Triffids gave {{a series of}} performances on 17–20 January 2008, {{as part of the}} 2008 Sydney Festival celebrating the music <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> of David McComb. The band were joined on stage by a number of Australian musicians including Mark and Rob Snarski (The Blackeyed Susans), Toby Martin (Youth Group), Steve Kilbey (The Church), Mick Harvey (Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds), Chris Abrahams (The Necks) and Melanie Oxley. Youth Group in fact opened these shows with 4 covers of Early Triffids classics and rarities in praise of band's earlier years. A feature-length documentary of these shows, It's Raining Pleasure, was to be released in early 2009.|$|E
25|$|The AGC {{also had}} a {{sophisticated}} software interpreter, developed by the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory, that implemented a virtual machine with more complex and capable pseudo-instructions than the native AGC. These instructions simplified the navigational programs. Interpreted code, which featured double precision trigonometric, scalar and vector arithmetic (16 and 24-bit), even an MXV (matrix × vector) instruction, could be mixed with native AGC code. While the execution time of the pseudo-instructions was increased (due {{to the need to}} interpret these instructions at runtime) the interpreter provided many more instructions than AGC natively supported <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> requirements were much lower than in the case of adding these instructions to the AGC native language which would require additional memory built into the computer (at that time the memory capacity was very expensive). The average pseudo-instruction required about 24 ms to execute. The assembler and version control system, named YUL for an early prototype Christmas Computer, enforced proper transitions between native and interpreted code.|$|E

30|$|In the schemes {{mentioned}} above, {{the exploitation}} of <b>the</b> source-relay correlation <b>and</b> <b>the</b> source <b>memory</b> structure have been addressed separately.

A similar study can be found in[15], where <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> structure of <b>the</b> source is represented by a very simple model, bit-flipping between the current information sequence and its previous counterpart, which is not reasonable in many practical scenarios. When {{the exploitation of}} <b>the</b> source <b>memory</b> having more generic structures, the problem of code design for relay systems exploiting jointly <b>the</b> source-relay correlation <b>and</b> <b>the</b> source <b>memory</b> structure is still open.|$|R
25|$|The diary {{abruptly}} {{picks up}} when Jared regains consciousness after {{being involved in}} an explosion. In the hospital, Jared attempts to piece together his memories, chronicling that one of B's lecture theatres was bombed; Shirin and B's inner circle are presumably all dead. Flown back to the United States to recuperate, Jared eventually confronts Fr. Lulfre from whom he learns that the Laurentian order indeed authorized both B's assassination and {{the bombing of the}} theatre. Jared renounces his devotion to the order and returns hastily back to Europe, desperately searching for any information about possible survivors of the bombing and lamenting his lack of knowledge about the people he seeks out, for example, the fact that he never even learned Shirin's last name. Ultimately, though, Jared recalls that the theatre had an underground tunnel through which Shirin and the others might have escaped. Visiting the mouth of the tunnel, which is barricaded by wooden planks, Jared finds contact information engraved in the wood. He is later reunited with Shirin and the others, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> comes flooding in that he warned them to flee moments before the explosion, thus saving their lives. A brief epilogue explains that Jared and Shirin plan to completely disappear from the public eye together; moments before Jared must leave to board a plane, he urges the spreading of B's philosophy and writes the final words of his diary: that Charles Atterley, Shirin, he, and the reader, too, are all B.|$|E

The scene was shot several times; Flannery admitted that the shooting was excruiating and it felt like they had been shooting the one scene for [...] "14 hours". To preserve Flannery's modesty, the series' monitors were shut off <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> card for the digital camera was removed.
