5|$|Ruffin's and Leval's {{divisions}} fled {{towards the}} Laguna del Puerco, where Victor succeeded in halting their disorganised rout. The Marshal deployed {{two or three}} relatively unscathed battalions to cover the reorganisation of his forces and secure their retreat, but Graham had also managed to call his exhausted men to order and he brought them, with Duncan's artillery, against Victor's new position. Morale in the re-formed French ranks was fragile; when <b>a</b> <b>squadron</b> <b>of</b> KGL hussars rounded the Cerro and drove <b>a</b> <b>squadron</b> <b>of</b> French dragoons onto their infantry, the shock {{was too much to}} bear for the demoralised soldiers, who retreated in a sudden rush.|$|E

Meanwhile, the Bikanir Camel Corps and <b>a</b> <b>squadron</b> <b>of</b> aircraft continued searching the desert sands for missing men.|$|E
5|$|When Macpherson's {{squadron}} {{reached the}} high ground an Ottoman patrol saw the light horsemen, but before they could alert the Tiberias garrison, they was quickly cut off and captured. By the time <b>a</b> <b>squadron</b> <b>of</b> the 12th Light Horse Regiment advancing from Semakh, reached the outskirts of Tiberias at 11:30, all approaches were held by squadrons of the 3rd Light Horse Brigade.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>squadron</b> <b>of</b> the 8th Light Horse Regiment of the 3rd Light Horse Brigade, {{commanded}} by Major Macpherson, left Nazareth at 05:00 on 25 September.

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>squadron</b> <b>of</b> three galleys under Antonio Diedo {{arrived to}} {{reinforce}} the city on 17 March, but to little avail. A muster of the city's available defenders showed that they sufficed to man only one {{in two or three}} crenelles, and they were deficient in both armament and morale: news of Murad's approach at the head of an army rumoured to number 190,000 men caused widespread terror among the populace.|$|E
5|$|Anchored in Manila Bay, Cooke {{pretended that}} his ships were French vessels and {{successfully}} lured successive boatloads of Spanish officials aboard, taking them prisoner in turn. Once he had determined from his captives {{the state of}} defences in Manila, that the treasure ship had been unloaded at Cavite and that the Spanish squadron was undergoing extensive repairs and thus unavailable for operations, he sent a raiding party against <b>a</b> <b>squadron</b> <b>of</b> gunboats {{in the mouth of}} the Pasig River. Capturing the gunboats in a bloodless attack, Cooke then released his prisoners and sailed southwards, unsuccessfully assaulting Zamboanga before returning to Macau.|$|E
5|$|As {{the rest}} of the 3rd Light Horse Brigade {{advanced}} to Tiberias, their left flank moved over the site of the 1187AD Battle of Hattin.

5|$|Benbow's {{fame and}} success earned him both public notoriety and a {{promotion}} to admiral.

Benbow instigated the trial and later imprisonment or execution of a number of the captains involved, though he did not live to see these results. These events contributed to his notoriety, and led to several references to him in subsequent popular culture.|$|E
5|$|During the Quasi-War, the United States {{paid tribute}} to the Barbary States {{to ensure that they}} would not seize or harass American {{merchant}} ships. In 1801 Yusuf Karamanli of Tripoli, dissatisfied with the amount of tribute in comparison to that paid to Algiers, demanded an immediate payment of $250,000.

The squadron passed through the Straits of Gibraltar on 2September, before stopping at Cartagena on 10September to pick up supplies. On 28September it arrived at its destination, where it was reinforced with five other men-of-war. The King embarked on 7October, and the squadron arrived in Barcelona on 17October.|$|E
5|$|IAF {{aircraft}} carried {{electronic countermeasures}} pods to foil radar tracking. The IAF command post in Tel Aviv provided Ivry a real-time command {{picture of the}} air battle through various data links.

A two-way voice communications link between Ivry and his pilots was set up, allowing for real-time command.|$|E
5|$|Implacable {{temporarily}} {{became a}} trials carrier in October 1947 {{as her own}} air group was not yet ready and she was refitted from October to December 1948 in preparation of service as the Home Fleet flagship. She embarked a squadron each of de Havilland Sea Hornets and Blackburn Firebrands in April 1949 and became the flagship of Admiral Sir Philip Vian on 29 April. <b>A</b> <b>squadron</b> <b>of</b> de Havilland Sea Vampires flew from her deck later that year and her air group was augmented by <b>a</b> <b>squadron</b> <b>of</b> Fairey Barracudas in 1950. Implacable was placed in reserve in September 1950 and slowly converted into a training ship {{by the addition of}} extra accommodation and classrooms, including the addition of a deckhouse on her flight deck. She was recommissioned on January 1952 as the flagship of the Home Fleet Training Squadron. Together with Indefatigable, she was present during the Coronation Fleet Review of Queen Elizabeth II on 15 June 1953. Four months later, Implacable ferried a battalion of troops from Plymouth to Trinidad in response to a crisis in British Guiana.

These were superseded soon after by the Mach 2 F-106 Delta Darts and on 10 June 1972, the unit became the 102d Air Defense Wing.
