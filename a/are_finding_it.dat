5|$|The {{government}} {{believed that}} the changes were needed because of the collapse in unskilled jobs in the economy, which means that young school leavers at 16 years of age <b>are</b> <b>finding</b> <b>it</b> increasingly more difficult to find employment, consequentially in many cases making them unemployable. Within the last 40 years, the number of unskilled jobs available have more than halved, from 8 million in the 1960s to 3.5 by 2007, with predictions of further drops to just 600,000 by 2020 due to the increasing demand for skilled labour. This, together with fewer students continuing their further education, increase the difficulty for young school leavers to find work if they were either not able, or chose not to, stay on at school and complete further education.|$|E

25|$|In September 2011, {{plans were}} {{announced}} to demolish some University buildings that were damaged from an earthquake.

The number of international students, who pay much higher fees and are {{a major source of}} revenue, dropped by 30 per cent. By 2013, the University had lost 22 per cent of its students. However, a record number of 886 PhD students are enrolled at the University of Canterbury as of 2013. Other New Zealand universities, apparently defying an informal agreement, launched billboard and print advertising campaigns in the earthquake-ravaged city to recruit University of Canterbury students who <b>are</b> <b>finding</b> <b>it</b> difficult to study there.
