PERSSILAA (PERsonalised ICT Supported Service for Independent Living and Active Ageing) is a unique European project that develops and validates a new service model, to screen for and prevent frailty in community dwelling older adults. This multimodal service integrates nutrition, physical and cognitive function and is supported by an interoperable ICT service infrastructure. A multidisciplinary team from 5 countries, The Netherlands, Spain, Italy, Portugal and Ireland, is providing a unique combination of skills to develop remote services for screening, monitoring and training modules aiming to contribute to good health habits on the nutritional, physical and cognitive domains. This communication will give a special focus to the work developed by the Portuguese team in this project, comprising also the design of an interactive nutrition website.

40|$|Prostate cancer (CaP) {{metastasis}} to bone {{results in}} mixed osteolytic and osteoblastic lesions {{associated with high}} morbidity and there is mounting evidence that the urokinase-type plasminogen (uPA) system is causatively involved in the progression of CaP. Adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are promising tools for cell-mediated gene therapy with the advantage of osteogenic potential, a critical issue {{in the case of}} osteolytic metastases. In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic use of engineered murine MSCs for in vivo delivery of the uPA antagonist amino-terminal fragment (hATF) in order to impair osteolytic CaP cells progression in bone and to repair bone lesions. Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) revealed that both primary MSCs (pMSCs) and MSC line C 3 H 10 T 1 / 2 (C 3) expressing hATF (MSC-hATF) inhibited significantly intra-tibial PC- 3 -Luc growth following co-injection in SCID mice. Furthermore, micro-computed tomography (microCT) imaging of vascular network clearly demonstrated a significant decrease of tumor-associated angiogenesis and a protection from tumor-induced osteolysis in MSC-hATF treated mice. Importantly, the osteogenic potential of MSC-hATF cells was unaffected and area of new bone formation was evidenced in 60 % of animals. Altogether, these data support the concept of MSC-based therapy of tumor osteolysis disease, indicating that MSCs may combine properties of vehicle for angiostatic agent with osteogenic potential. ______________________________________________________________________________ Author contributions: V.
