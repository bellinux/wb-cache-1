5|$|The {{realization}} {{that we live}} in <b>a</b> <b>galaxy</b> which is one among many galaxies, parallels major discoveries that were made about the Milky Way and other nebulae.|$|E
5|$|Another area of {{interest}} for Rubin was the phenomenon of counter-rotation in galaxies. Her discovery that some gas and stars moved {{in the opposite direction}} to the rotation {{of the rest of the}} galaxy challenged the prevailing theory that all of the material in <b>a</b> <b>galaxy</b> moved in the same direction, and provided the first evidence for galaxy mergers and the process by which galaxies initially formed.|$|E
5|$|Binary and multi-star systems {{consist of}} two or more stars that are gravitationally bound and {{generally}} move around each other in stable orbits. When two such stars have a relatively close orbit, their gravitational interaction can {{have a significant impact on}} their evolution. Stars can form part of a much larger gravitationally bound structure, such as a star cluster or <b>a</b> <b>galaxy.</b>|$|E
50|$|NGC 7600 is <b>an</b> {{elliptical}} <b>galaxy</b> about 160 {{million light-years}} {{in the constellation}} Aquarius classified as <b>a</b> lenticular <b>galaxy,</b> or, more formally, <b>an</b> S0 <b>galaxy.</b>|$|R
50|$|NGC 5010 is <b>a</b> {{lenticular}} <b>galaxy</b> {{located about}} 140 million light years away, {{in the constellation}} Virgo. It is considered a LIRG (Luminous Infrared <b>Galaxy).</b> <b>As</b> the <b>galaxy</b> has few young blue stars and mostly red old stars and dust, it is transitioning from being <b>a</b> spiral <b>galaxy</b> to being <b>an</b> elliptical <b>galaxy,</b> with its spiral arms having burned out and become dusty arms.|$|R
5000|$|<b>A</b> ring <b>galaxy</b> has <b>a</b> ring-like {{structure}} {{of stars and}} interstellar medium surrounding a bare core. <b>A</b> ring <b>galaxy</b> is thought to occur when <b>a</b> smaller <b>galaxy</b> passes through the core of <b>a</b> spiral <b>galaxy.</b> Such <b>an</b> event may have affected the Andromeda Galaxy, as it displays a multi-ring-like structure when viewed in infrared radiation.|$|R
5|$|During the {{following}} two billion years, the accumulated matter settles into a galactic disc. <b>A</b> <b>galaxy</b> will continue to absorb infalling material from high-velocity clouds and dwarf galaxies throughout its life. This matter is mostly hydrogen and helium. The cycle of stellar birth and death slowly increases the abundance of heavy elements, eventually allowing the formation of planets.|$|E
5|$|Galactic habitable-zone {{theory has}} been criticized due to an {{inability}} to quantify accurately the factors making a region of <b>a</b> <b>galaxy</b> favorable {{for the emergence of}} life. In addition, computer simulations suggest that stars may change their orbits around the galactic center significantly, therefore challenging {{at least part of the}} view that some galactic areas are necessarily more life-supporting than others.|$|E
5|$|Globular {{clusters}} {{are found}} in the halo of <b>a</b> <b>galaxy</b> and contain considerably more stars and are much older than the less dense open clusters, which {{are found in}} the disk of <b>a</b> <b>galaxy.</b> Globular clusters are fairly common; there are about 150 to 158 currently known globular clusters in the Milky Way, with perhaps 10 to 20 more still undiscovered. These globular clusters orbit the Galaxy at radii of 40 kiloparsecs (130,000 light-years) or more. Larger galaxies can have more: Andromeda Galaxy, for instance, may have as many as 500. Some giant elliptical galaxies (particularly those at the centers of galaxy clusters) such as M87, have as many as 13,000 globular clusters.|$|E
50|$|The surface {{brightness}} fluctuation (SBF) method {{takes advantage}} of the use of CCD cameras on telescopes. Because of spatial fluctuations in <b>a</b> <b>galaxy’s</b> surface brightness, some pixels on these cameras will pick up more stars than others. However, as distance increases the picture will become increasingly smoother. Analysis of this describes a magnitude of the pixel-to-pixel variation, which is directly related to <b>a</b> <b>galaxy’s</b> distance.|$|R
50|$|Tidal {{stripping}} {{occurs when}} <b>a</b> larger <b>galaxy</b> pulls stars and other stellar material from <b>a</b> smaller <b>galaxy.</b>|$|R
50|$|Hoag's Object is <b>a</b> non-typical <b>galaxy</b> of {{the type}} known as <b>a</b> ring <b>galaxy.</b> The galaxy is named after Arthur Hoag who {{discovered}} it in 1950 and identified it as either a planetary nebula or <b>a</b> peculiar <b>galaxy</b> with eight billion stars.|$|R
5|$|Spiral galaxies {{consist of}} a {{rotating}} disk of stars and interstellar medium, along with a central bulge of generally older stars. Extending outward from the bulge are relatively bright arms. In the Hubble classification scheme, spiral galaxies are listed as type S, followed by a letter (a, b, or c) that indicates the degree of tightness of the spiral arms {{and the size of}} the central bulge. An Sa galaxy has tightly wound, poorly defined arms and possesses a relatively large core region. At the other extreme, an Sc galaxy has open, well-defined arms and a small core region. <b>A</b> <b>galaxy</b> with poorly defined arms is sometimes referred to as a flocculent spiral galaxy; in contrast to the grand design spiral galaxy that has prominent and well-defined spiral arms. The speed in which <b>a</b> <b>galaxy</b> rotates is thought to correlate with the flatness of the disc as some spiral galaxies have thick bulges, while others are thin and dense.|$|E
5|$|Spiral galaxies {{resemble}} spiraling pinwheels. Though {{the stars}} and other visible material contained in such <b>a</b> <b>galaxy</b> lie mostly on a plane, the majority of mass in spiral galaxies exists in a roughly spherical halo of dark matter that extends beyond the visible component, {{as demonstrated by the}} universal rotation curve concept.|$|E
5|$|The Milky Way {{galaxy and}} the nearby Andromeda Galaxy are moving toward each other at about 130km/s, and—depending upon the lateral movements—the two might collide in about five to six billion years. Although the Milky Way has never {{collided}} with <b>a</b> <b>galaxy</b> as large as Andromeda before, evidence of past collisions of the Milky Way with smaller dwarf galaxies is increasing.|$|E

5|$|As well {{as being}} located in a region of the galaxy that is {{chemically}} advantageous {{for the development of}} life, a star must also avoid an excessive number of catastrophic cosmic events with the potential to damage life on its otherwise habitable planets. Nearby supernovae, for example, have the potential to severely harm life on a planet; with excessive frequency, such catastrophic outbursts have the potential to sterilize an entire region of <b>a</b> <b>galaxy</b> for billions of years. The galactic bulge, for example, experienced an initial wave of extremely rapid star formation, triggering a cascade of supernovae that for five billion years left that area almost completely unable to develop life.|$|E
5|$|Estimating {{the exact}} {{rate at which}} GRBs occur is difficult; for <b>a</b> <b>galaxy</b> of {{approximately}} {{the same size as}} the Milky Way, estimates of the expected rate (for long-duration GRBs) can range from one burst every 10,000 years, to one burst every 1,000,000 years. Only a small percentage of these would be beamed towards Earth. Estimates of rate of occurrence of short-duration GRBs are even more uncertain because of the unknown degree of collimation, but are probably comparable.|$|E
5|$|In the {{modified}} Hubble sequence galaxy morphological classification scheme of French astronomer Gérard de Vaucouleurs, M87 is categorized as an E0p galaxy. The E0 designation {{is used for}} an elliptical galaxy that displays no flattening—that is, it appears spherical. A 'p' suffix indicates a peculiar galaxy that does not fit cleanly into the classification scheme; in this case, the peculiarity denotes {{the presence of the}} jet emerging from the core. M87 is considered a type-cD galaxy, which is a supergiant D class galaxy. The latter category, first proposed by American astronomer William W. Morgan in 1958, is <b>a</b> <b>galaxy</b> that has an elliptical-like nucleus surrounded by an extensive, dustless, diffuse envelope.|$|E

40|$|All {{galaxies are}} thought to reside within large haloes of dark matter, whose {{properties}} can only be determined from indirect observations. The formation and assembly of galaxies is determined from the interplay between these dark matter haloes and the baryonic matter they host. Although statistical relations {{can be used to}} approximate how massive <b>a</b> <b>galaxy’s</b> halo is, very few individual galaxies have direct measurements of their halo masses. We present a method to directly estimate the total mass of <b>a</b> <b>galaxy’s</b> dark halo using its system of globular clusters. The link between globular cluster systems and halo masses is independent of <b>a</b> <b>galaxy’s</b> type and environment, in contrast to the relationship between galaxy halo and stellar masses. This trend is expected in models where globular clusters form in early, rare density peaks in the cold dark matter density field and the epoch of reionization was roughly coeval throughout the Universe. We illustrate the general utility of this relation by demonstrating that <b>a</b> <b>galaxy’s</b> supermassive black hole mass and global X-ray luminosity are directly proportional to their host dark halo masses, as inferred from our new method...|$|R
40|$|We compile radio {{supernova}} remnant (SNR) {{samples from}} the literature for 19 nearby galaxies ranging from the SMC to Arp 220, and use this data to constrain the SNR luminosity function (LF) at 20 cm. We find that radio SNR populations are strikingly similar across galaxies. The LF {{can be described as}} a power law with constant index and scaling proportional to <b>a</b> <b>galaxy’s</b> star formation rate (SFR). Unlike previous authors, we do not find any dependence of SNR luminosity on <b>a</b> <b>galaxy’s</b> global ISM density. The observed correlation between the luminosity of <b>a</b> <b>galaxy’s</b> brightest SNR and <b>a</b> <b>galaxy’s</b> SFR can be completely explained by statistical effects, wherein galaxies with higher SFR more thoroughly sample the high-luminosity end of the SNR LF. The LF is well fit by a model of SNR synchrotron emission which includes diffusive shock acceleration and magnetic field amplification, if we assume that all remnants are undergoing adiabatic expansion, the densities of star-forming regions are similar across galaxies, and the efficiency of CR production is constant.

5|$|Most {{observed}} events (70%) have a {{duration of}} greater than two seconds and {{are classified as}} long gamma-ray bursts. Because these events constitute {{the majority of the}} population and because they tend to have the brightest afterglows, they have been observed in much greater detail than their short counterparts. Almost every well-studied long gamma-ray burst has been linked to <b>a</b> <b>galaxy</b> with rapid star formation, and in many cases to a core-collapse supernova as well, unambiguously associating long GRBs with the deaths of massive stars. Long GRB afterglow observations, at high redshift, are also consistent with the GRB having originated in star-forming regions.|$|E
5|$|Observations of {{globular}} clusters show that these stellar formations arise primarily in regions of efficient star formation, {{and where the}} interstellar medium is at a higher density than in normal star-forming regions. Globular cluster formation is prevalent in starburst regions and in interacting galaxies. Research indicates a correlation between the mass of a central supermassive black holes (SMBH) {{and the extent of}} the globular cluster systems of elliptical and lenticular galaxies. The mass of the SMBH in such <b>a</b> <b>galaxy</b> is often close to the combined mass of the galaxy's {{globular clusters}}.|$|E
5|$|Over time, the Universe and its {{contents}} have evolved; for example, the relative population of quasars and galaxies has changed and space itself has expanded. Due to this expansion, scientists on Earth can observe the light from <b>a</b> <b>galaxy</b> 30 billion light years away even though that light has traveled for only 13 billion years; the very space between them has expanded. This expansion {{is consistent with the}} observation that the light from distant galaxies has been redshifted; the photons emitted have been stretched to longer wavelengths and lower frequency during their journey. Analyses of Type Ia supernovae indicate that the spatial expansion is accelerating.|$|E

5|$|Stars {{are created}} within galaxies from a reserve of cold gas that forms into giant {{molecular}} clouds. Some galaxies {{have been observed}} to form stars at an exceptional rate, which {{is known as a}} starburst. If they continue to do so, then they would consume their reserve of gas in a time span less than the lifespan of the galaxy. Hence starburst activity usually lasts for only about ten million years, a relatively brief period in the history of <b>a</b> <b>galaxy.</b> Starburst galaxies were more common during the early history of the Universe, and, at present, still contribute an estimated 15% to the total star production rate.|$|E
5|$|The {{estimated}} rate of supernova production in <b>a</b> <b>galaxy</b> {{the size of}} the Milky Way is about one every 50years. This is much higher than the actual observed rate, implying that a portion of these events have been obscured from the Earth by interstellar dust. The deployment of new instruments that can observe across a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum, along with neutrino detectors, means that the next such event will almost certainly be detected.|$|E
5|$|Water megamasers {{were the}} first type of megamaser discovered. The first water megamaser was found in 1979 in NGC 4945, <b>a</b> <b>galaxy</b> in the nearby Centaurus A/M83 Group. The first {{hydroxyl}} megamaser was found in 1982 in Arp 220, which is the nearest ultraluminous infrared galaxy to the Milky Way. All subsequent OH megamasers that have been discovered are also in luminous infrared galaxies, {{and there are a}} small number of OH kilomasers hosted in galaxies with lower infrared luminosities. Most luminous infrared galaxies have recently merged or interacted with another galaxy, and are undergoing a burst of star formation. Many of the characteristics of the emission in hydroxyl megamasers are distinct from that of hydroxyl masers within the Milky Way, including the amplification of background radiation and the ratio of hydroxyl lines at different frequencies. The population inversion in hydroxyl molecules is produced by far infrared radiation that results from absorption and re-emission of light from forming stars by surrounding interstellar dust. Zeeman splitting of hydroxyl megamaser lines may be used to measure magnetic fields in the masing regions, and this application represents the first detection of Zeeman splitting in <b>a</b> <b>galaxy</b> other than the Milky Way.|$|E
5000|$|To {{inquire into}} {{the origin and}} fate of <b>a</b> <b>galaxy's</b> halo gas is to inquire into the {{evolution}} of said galaxy. HVCs and IVCs are significant features of <b>a</b> spiral <b>galaxy's</b> structure. These clouds are of primary importance when considering <b>a</b> <b>galaxy's</b> Star formation rate (SFR). The Milky Way has approximately 5 billion solar masses of star forming material within its disk and a SFR of 1-3 [...] yr−1. Models for galactic chemical evolution find that {{at least half of}} this amount must be continuously accreted, low-metallicity material to describe the current, observable structure. Without this accretion, the SFRs indicate that the current star formation material will only last for another few gigayears (Gyr) at most.|$|R
