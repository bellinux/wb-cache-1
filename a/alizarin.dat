25|$|Synthetic dyes {{are often}} derived from 9,10-anthraquinone, such as <b>alizarin.</b> Important {{derivatives}} are 1-nitroanthraquinone, anthraquinone-1-sulfonic acid, and the dinitroanthraquinone. Natural pigments that are derivatives of anthraquinone are found, inter alia, in aloe latex, senna, rhubarb, and cascara buckthorn, fungi, lichens, and some insects.|$|E
25|$|Anthracene {{is a solid}} {{polycyclic}} {{aromatic hydrocarbon}} (PAH) of formula C14H10, consisting of three fused benzene rings. It is a component of coal tar. Anthracene {{is used in the}} production of the red dye <b>alizarin</b> and other dyes. Anthracene is colorless but exhibits a blue (400-500nm peak) fluorescence under ultraviolet radiation.|$|E
25|$|Spanish {{influence}} {{changed the}} way in which Aztecs used pigments, particularly in their manuscripts. For example, Cochineal was replaced by Spanish dyes like minium and <b>alizarin</b> crimson. The image of Moctezuma's death (seen to the right) uses both indigenous and Spanish pigments, and is therefore representative of the transition and influence between cultures.|$|E
25|$|Morphine {{had already}} been {{isolated}} in Germany by German pharmacist Friedrich Sert√ºrner in 1804. Codeine was first isolated decades later in 1832 in France by Pierre Robiquet, a French chemist and pharmacist already famous for the discovery of <b>alizarin,</b> the most widespread red dye, while working on refined morphine extraction processes. This {{paved the way for}} the elaboration of a new generation of safer, codeine-based specific antitussive and antidiarrheal formulations.|$|E
25|$|The carmine dye {{was used}} in Central America in the 15th century for {{coloring}} fabrics and became an important export good during the colonial period. After synthetic pigments and dyes such as <b>alizarin</b> were invented in the late 19th century, natural-dye production gradually diminished. Health fears over artificial food additives, however, have renewed the popularity of cochineal dyes, and the increased demand has made cultivation of the insect profitable again, with Peru being the largest exporter. Some towns in the Mexican state of Oaxaca are still working in handmade textiles using this cochineal.|$|E
25|$|Discoveries {{in color}} science created new {{industries}} and drove changes in fashion and taste. The discovery in 1856 of mauveine, the first aniline dye, was a forerunner {{for the development}} of hundreds of synthetic dyes and pigments like azo and diazo compounds which are the source of a wide spectrum of colors. Mauveine was discovered by an 18-year-old chemist named William Henry Perkin, who went on to exploit his discovery in industry and become wealthy. His success attracted a generation of followers, as young scientists went into organic chemistry to pursue riches. Within a few years, chemists had synthesized a substitute for madder in the production of <b>Alizarin</b> Crimson. By the closing decades of the 19th century, textiles, paints, and other commodities in colors such as red, crimson, blue, and purple had become affordable.|$|E
25|$|William Perkin {{continued}} active {{research in}} organic chemistry {{for the rest}} of his life: he discovered and marketed other synthetic dyes, including Britannia Violet and Perkin's Green; he discovered ways to make coumarin, one of the first synthetic perfume raw materials, and cinnamic acid. (The reaction used to make the latter became known as the Perkin reaction.) Local lore has it that the colour of the nearby Grand Union Canal changed from week to week depending on the activity at Perkin's Greenford dyeworks. In 1869, Perkin found a method for the commercial production from anthracene of the brilliant red dye <b>alizarin,</b> which had been isolated and identified from madder root some forty years earlier in 1826 by the French chemist Pierre Robiquet, simultaneously with purpurin, another red dye of lesser industrial interest, but the German chemical company BASF patented the same process one day before he did. During the next decade, the new German Empire was rapidly eclipsing Britain as the centre of Europe's chemical industry. By the 1890s, Germany had a near-monopoly on the business and Perkin was compelled to sell off his holdings and retire.|$|E
500|$|Polish {{cochineal}} (Porphyrophora polonica), {{also known}} as Polish carmine scales, is a scale insect formerly used to produce a crimson dye of the same name, colloquially known as [...] "Saint John's blood". The larvae of P. polonica are sessile parasites living on the roots of various herbsespecially those of the perennial knawelgrowing on the sandy soils of Central Europe {{and other parts of}} Eurasia. Before the development of aniline, <b>alizarin,</b> and other synthetic dyes, the insect was of great economic importance, although its use was in decline after the introduction of Mexican cochineal to Europe in the 16th century.|$|E
500|$|In 1904 Romaine Brooks, {{the name}} she preferred, became {{dissatisfied}} with her work, {{and in particular}} with the bright color schemes that she had used in her early paintings. She travelled to St. Ives on the Cornish coast, rented a small studio, and began learning to create finer gradations of gray. When a group of local artists asked her to give an informal show of her work, she displayed only some pieces of cardboard on which she had dabbed her experiments with gray paint. From then on, nearly all of her paintings are keyed to a gray, white and black color scheme with touches and tints of ochre, umber, <b>alizarin</b> and teal. By 1905 she had found her tonal palette and would continue to develop these harmonics her whole career.|$|E
500|$|A {{variety of}} plants produce red dyes, {{including}} {{a number of}} lichens, henna, alkanet or dyer's bugloss (Alkanna tinctoria), asafoetida and dyer's madder Rubia tinctorum. [...] Madder and related plants of the genus [...] Rubia [...] are native to many temperate zones around the world, and were already used as sources of good red dye, such as rose madder, in prehistory. [...] Madder has been identified on linen in the tomb of Tutankhamun, and Pliny the Elder records madder growing near Rome. Madder was a dye of commercial importance in Europe, being cultivated in the Netherlands and France to dye the red coats of military uniforms until the market collapsed following the development of synthetic <b>alizarin</b> dye in 1869. [...] Madder was also used to dye the [...] "hunting pinks" [...] of Great Britain.|$|E
500|$|The first {{synthetic}} dyes {{were discovered}} in the mid-19th century, starting with William Henry Perkin's mauveine in 1856, an aniline dye derived from coal tar. <b>Alizarin,</b> the red dye present in madder, was the first natural pigment to be duplicated synthetically, in 1869, leading {{to the collapse of}} the market for naturally grown madder. [...] The development of new, strongly colored aniline dyes followed quickly: a range of reddish-purples, blues, violets, greens and reds became available by 1880. These dyes had great affinity for animal fibres such as wool and silk. [...] The new colors tended to fade and wash out, but they were inexpensive and could be produced in the vast quantities required by textile production in the industrial revolution. By the 1870s commercial dyeing with natural dyestuffs was fast disappearing.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the case}} of the dye <b>alizarin</b> (1,2-dihydroxyanthraquinone, [...] ), {{mordanting}} was hypothesised to involve the formation of a dianion of <b>alizarin.</b> This would form a five-coordinate aluminium complex, , which can take up water to form a hydrate with a six-coordinate aluminium-centred dianion, [...] [...] The proposal was based on infared spectroscopic data, and was subsequently challenged by work suggesting a structure with two bridging hydroxyl ligands connecting a dinuclear core, , with two <b>alizarin</b> moieties each chelating to each aluminium centre. The structure was proposed by Soubayrol et al. based on 27Al NMR spectroscopy and electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry evidence. [...] They reported that the degree of hydration was dependent on the identity of the counter-ion, with the sodium salt being a stable tetrahydrate with a monohydrate being formed from potassium hydroxide. These were distinguishable based on their chemical shifts, suggesting the waters are associating with the aluminium centres or the <b>alizarin</b> moieties, and not behaving as is typical for waters of crystallisation.|$|E
2500|$|Aluminium {{triacetate}} {{is used as}} a mordant {{agent with}} dyes like <b>alizarin,</b> both alone and in combination. Together with aluminium diacetate or with aluminium sulfacetate it is used with cotton, other cellulose fibres, and silk.

2500|$|A related {{structure}} with calcium ions {{was reported in}} 1994, and in it the alizarins chelate to the calcium ions to form AzCaAz bridges between the aluminium centres (which are also bridged by hydroxo groups) and the aluminium centres subsequently bind to the deprotonated phenol residues of the dye; in the Soubayrol model, each <b>alizarin</b> {{is associated with a}} single aluminium cation. [...] As with the structure of aluminium acetate itself, the forms it takes in applications has not been resolved.|$|E
2500|$|The {{demand for}} {{cochineal}} fell {{sharply with the}} appearance on the market of <b>alizarin</b> crimson and many other artificial dyes discovered in Europe {{in the middle of}} the 19th century, causing a significant financial shock in Spain as a major industry almost ceased to exist. The delicate manual labour required for the breeding of the insect could not compete with the modern methods of the new industry, and even less so with the lowering of production costs. The [...] "tuna blood" [...] dye (from the Mexican name for the Opuntia fruit) stopped being used and trade in cochineal almost totally disappeared in the course of the 20th century. The breeding of the cochineal insect has been done mainly for the purposes of maintaining the tradition rather than to satisfy any sort of demand.|$|E
50|$|In 1827, the French chemists Pierre-Jean Robiquet and Colin began {{producing}} garancine, the concentrated {{version of}} natural madder. They then found that madder lake contained two colorants, the red <b>alizarin</b> {{and the more}} rapidly fading purpurin. Purpurin is only present in the natural form of madder and gives a distinctive orange/red generally warmer tone that pure synthetic <b>alizarin</b> does not. Purpurin fluoresces yellow to red under ultraviolet light, while synthetic <b>alizarin</b> slightly shows violet. <b>Alizarin</b> was discovered before purpurin, by heating the ground madder with acid and potash. A yellow vapor crystallized into bright red needles: <b>alizarin.</b> This <b>alizarin</b> concentrate comprises only 1% of the madder root.|$|E
50|$|<b>Alizarin</b> crimson is a {{red color}} that is biased {{slightly}} more towards purple than towards orange on the color wheel. It is named after the organic dye <b>alizarin,</b> found in the madder plant, and the related synthetic lake pigment <b>alizarin</b> crimson (PR83 in the Color Index). <b>Alizarin</b> crimson paint was frequently used on Bob Ross' TV show, The Joy of Painting.|$|E
50|$|In 1826, the French chemist Pierre Jean Robiquet had {{isolated}} from the root of a plant, madder, and defined the structure of, <b>alizarin,</b> a remarkable red dye. Liebermann's 1868 discovery that <b>alizarin</b> {{can be reduced to}} form anthracene, which is an abundant component in coal tar, opened the road for synthetic <b>alizarin.</b> The patent of Liebermann and Carl Gr√§be for the synthesis of <b>alizarin</b> from anthracene was filed one day before the patent of William Henry Perkin. The synthesis is a chlorination or bromination of anthracene with a subsequent oxidation forming the <b>alizarin.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Alizarin</b> is {{the main}} {{ingredient}} for the manufacture of the madder lake pigments known to painters as Rose madder and <b>Alizarin</b> crimson. <b>Alizarin</b> in the most common usage of the term has a deep red color, but the term {{is also part of}} the name for several related non-red dyes, such as Alizarine Cyanine Green and Alizarine Brilliant Blue. A notable use of <b>alizarin</b> in modern times is as a staining agent in biological research because it stains free calcium and certain calcium compounds a red or light purple color. <b>Alizarin</b> continues to be used commercially as a red textile dye, but to a lesser extent than 100 years ago.|$|E
50|$|Gr√§be {{synthesized}} the dye <b>alizarin</b> in 1868 with Carl Theodore Liebermann. <b>Alizarin</b> {{had been}} isolated from madder root some forty years earlier in 1826 by the French chemist Pierre Robiquet. Its chemical synthesis was {{a milestone in}} the development of the German and international dye industry, and foreshadowed collapse of the French agricultural sector that produced madder root (after synthesis became the more economical means of producing <b>alizarin).</b>|$|E
50|$|Madder was an {{important}} dye and imports into the UK were valued at ¬£1.25 million {{per year in the}} 1860s. Schunck started his extensive investigations into the colouring materials in madder in 1846. The main colorant of madder was discovered by Robiquet and Colin in 1827 and called <b>alizarin.</b> Their analysis gave a formula C37H48O10. When purified by Schunck using sublimation and crystallisation, he obtained a result which suggested C14H8O4, but taking into account the analyses of metal derivatives as well, he chose C14H10O4 as the best result. The modern formula is C14H8O4. He found that oxidation of <b>alizarin</b> with nitric acid gave alizaric acid (phthalic acid) which on heating gave pyroalizaric acid (phthalic anhydride). This led to the suggestion that <b>alizarin</b> was a derivative of naphthalene, a C10 hydrocarbon, although Schunck pointed out that this did not explain the reactions of <b>alizarin.</b> He was vindicated when Graebe and Liebermann (1868) distilled <b>alizarin</b> with zinc dust to give anthracene, a C14 hydrocarbon, and subsequently (1869) synthesised <b>alizarin</b> from anthraquinone.|$|E

50|$|The plant's roots {{contain an}} {{anthracene}} compound called <b>alizarin</b> that gives its red colour to a textile dye known as Rose madder.

5000|$|Alizarin's {{abilities}} as a biological stain were first noted in 1567, {{when it was}} observed that when fed to animals, it stained their teeth and bones red.
