5|$|Masaccio {{is often}} {{compared}} to contemporaries like Donatello and Brunelleschi as {{a pioneer of}} the renaissance, particularly for his use of single-point perspective. One technique that was unique to Masaccio, however, {{was the use of}} atmospheric, or <b>aerial</b> <b>perspective.</b> Both the mountains in the background, and the figure of Peter on the left are dimmer and paler than the objects in the foreground, creating an illusion of depth. This technique was known in ancient Rome, but was considered lost until reinvented by Masaccio.|$|E
5|$|Unusual weather phenomena, such as {{snow and}} mist, fascinated Monet because they altered the {{chromatic}} appearance of familiar topography. In such paintings as The Magpie, one of Monet's early masterpieces, form dissolves under {{the combination of}} a greatly restricted color range, <b>aerial</b> <b>perspective,</b> and broken brushwork. A virtuoso color performance, the painting is an essay on the variations of white perceptible in the reflection of sun on crisp new snow. Wonderfully abstract passages of flat color, such as the strong violet shades along the fence, are divorced from the spatial realities of the objects portrayed.|$|E

25|$|The {{painting}} {{was one of}} the first portraits to depict the sitter in front of an imaginary landscape, and Leonardo {{was one of the}} first painters to use <b>aerial</b> <b>perspective.</b> The enigmatic woman is portrayed seated in what appears to be an open loggia with dark pillar bases on either side. Behind her, a vast landscape recedes to icy mountains. Winding paths and a distant bridge give only the slightest indications of human presence. Leonardo has chosen to place the horizon line not at the neck, as he did with Ginevra de' Benci, but on a level with the eyes, thus linking the figure with the landscape and emphasizing the mysterious nature of the painting.|$|E
25|$|In {{the center}} foreground, the {{fountain}} of life consists of a large stream of water, ending with a jewel-laden bed. In the distance, a minutely detailed cityscape recalls New Jerusalem. The detail and close attention to landscape and nature is at a level previously unseen in Northern European art. The numerous recognisable species of plants are minutely depicted {{with high levels of}} botanical accuracy. Similarly, the clouds and rock formations in the distance contain degrees of verisimilitude that evince studied observation. The far landscape contains representations of actual churches, while the depiction of the mountains beyond contain the first known example in art of <b>aerial</b> <b>perspective.</b> Yet the panel does not strive for exact realism; the sum of the forensically detailed natural elements, in combination with the apparition of the Holy Spirit and extended beams of light, serve to create a wholly individual and uniquely creative interpretation of a classic biblical scene.|$|E

500|$|An {{architectural}} {{competition for}} the new museum was held in 1997, with the winning design being that of Berlin-based architect Daniel Libeskind. Born in Łódź, Poland, in 1946, Libeskind's family had suffered during the Second World War and dozens of his relatives {{had died in the}} Holocaust. At the museum's opening, Libeskind said that he sought to [...] "create a building... which emotionally moved the soul of the visitor toward a sometimes unexpected realization"'. Libeskind envisaged a 'constellation composed of three interlocking shards' [...] with each shard being a remnant of an imagined globe shattered by conflict. These shards in turn represented air, earth and water, and each formed a functionally distinct part of the museum. The 55m high air shard, provides the museum's entranceway and a viewing balcony (now closed to the public) above the Manchester Ship Canal with views of the Manchester skyline. The construction of the tower leaves viewers exposed to the elements and one reviewer considered that it reflected [...] "the <b>aerial</b> <b>perspective</b> of modern warfare and the precariousness of the life below". The earth shard houses the museum's exhibition spaces, while the water shard accommodates a cafe with views of the canal.|$|E

[...] "An object has not one absolute form; it has many," [...] Metzinger wrote. Furthermore, part of the role of placing together various images was left to the observer (the one looking at the painting). The object represented, depending on how the observer perceives it, could have as many forms [...] "as there are planes in the region of perception." [...] (Jean Metzinger, 1912) ...|$|E

2500|$|Shinn left {{no record}} or notes {{of any kind}} about his time in Europe, but it is {{generally}} assumed that he saw the work of Daumier, Degas, and Lautrec while in France and Walter Sickert while in England. Echoes of the style of all four artists {{can be found in}} Shinn's work, especially in the affinity he shares with Degas in depictions of stages marked by unusual croppings and compositions. [...] Some of these paintings, like Trapeze, Winter Garden, New York (1903) or Curtain Call (n.d.), view the performers {{from the rear of the}} stage and include the audience as a backdrop to the picture itself; others, like London Hippodrome (1902), assume an imaginary <b>aerial</b> <b>perspective</b> from a balcony; and others take as a vantage point the middle of the orchestra pit (e..g, the 1906 The Orchestra Pit: Old Proctor's Fifth Avenue Theater), looking up toward the stage at a sharp angle. [...] Whether depicting ballet dancers, magicians, actors, acrobats, or vaudevillians, Shinn (who presumably spent a good deal of time at the theater himself) presents performance art as an enlivening and sensuous, if sometimes raucous, experience for both the men and women on the stage and the audience.|$|E

40|$|Spatial {{skills are}} known to vary widely among normal individuals.

They also performed a series of spatial and nonspatial component skill tests. With limited learning, performance after route encoding was worse than performance after survey encoding. Furthermore, performance after route and survey encoding appeared to be preferentially linked to perspective and object-based transformations, respectively. Together, the results provide clues to how different skills might be engaged by different individuals for the same goal of learning a large-scale environment...|$|R
6000|$|... § 25. Fig. 63 is a {{facsimile}} of a {{piece of}} the background in Albert Durer's woodcut of the binding of the great Dragon in the Apocalypse. It is one of his most careless and rudest pieces of drawing; yet, observe in it how notably the impulse of the breaking wave is indicated; and note farther, how different a thing good drawing may be from delicate drawing on the one hand, and how different it must be from ignorant drawing on the other. Woodcutting, in Durer's days, had reached no delicacy capable of expressing subtle detail or <b>aerial</b> <b>perspective.</b> But all the subtlety and <b>aerial</b> <b>perspective</b> of modern days are useless, and even barbarous, if they fail in the expression of the essential mountain facts.|$|E
6000|$|... § XXII. Now, in Millais' [...] "Huguenot," [...] {{the figures}} were {{standing}} {{about three feet}} from the wall behind them; and the wise world of critics, which could find no other fault with the picture, professed to have its eyes hurt by the want of an <b>aerial</b> <b>perspective,</b> which, had it been accurately given (as, indeed, I believe it was), would have amounted to the 10/3-5000th, or less than the 15,000th part of the depth of any given color. It {{would be interesting to}} see a picture painted by the critics, upon this scientific principle. The <b>aerial</b> <b>perspective</b> usually represented is entirely conventional and ridiculous; a mere struggle {{on the part of the}} pretendedly well-informed, but really ignorant, artist, to express distances by mist which he cannot by drawing.|$|E
6000|$|... § XXI. But {{not only}} in the conceit of it, but in the {{inaccuracy}} of it, this science betrays us. <b>Aerial</b> <b>perspective,</b> as given by the modern artist, is, in nine cases out of ten, a gross and ridiculous exaggeration, as is demonstrable in a moment. The effect of air in altering the hue and depth of color is of course great in the exact proportion of the volume of air between the observer and the object. It is not violent within the first few yards, and then diminished gradually, but it is equal for each foot of interposing air. Now in a clear day, and clear climate, such as that generally presupposed in a work of fine color, objects are completely visible at a distance of ten miles; visible in light and shade, with gradations between the two. Take, then, the faintest possible hue of shadow, or of any color, and the most violent and positive possible, and set them side by side. The interval between them is greater than the real difference (for objects may often be seen clearly much farther than ten miles, I have seen Mont Blanc at 120) caused by the ten miles of intervening air between any given hue of the nearest, and most distant, objects; but let us assume it, in courtesy to the masters of <b>aerial</b> <b>perspective,</b> to be the real difference. Then roughly estimating a mile at less than it really is, also in courtesy to them, or at 5000 feet, we have this difference between tints produced by 50,000 feet of air. Then, ten feet of air will produce the 5000th part of this difference. Let the reader take the two extreme tints, and carefully gradate the one into the other. Let him divide this gradated shadow or color into 5000 successive parts; and the difference in depth between one of these parts and the next is the exact amount of <b>aerial</b> <b>perspective</b> between one object, and another, ten feet behind it, on a clear day.|$|E

60|$|Compare with these, Turner's {{treatment}} of his {{materials in the}} Mercury and Argus. He has here his light actually coming from the distance, the sun being nearly in {{the centre of the}} picture, and a violent relief of objects against it would be far more justifiable than in Poussin's case. But this dark relief is used in its full force only with the nearest leaves of the nearest group of foliage overhanging the foreground from the left; and between these and the more distant members of the same group, though only three or four yards separate, distinct <b>aerial</b> <b>perspective</b> and intervening mist and light are shown; while the large tree in the centre, though very dark, as being very near, compared with all the distance, is much diminished in intensity of shade from this nearest group of leaves, and is faint compared with all the foreground. It is true that this tree has not, in consequence, the actual pitch of shade against the sky which it would have in nature; but it has precisely as much as it possibly can have, to leave it the same proportionate relation to the objects near at hand. And it cannot but be evident to the thoughtful reader, that whatever trickery or deception {{may be the result of}} a contrary mode of treatment, this is the only scientific or essentially truthful system, and that what it loses in tone it gains in <b>aerial</b> <b>perspective.</b>|$|E
