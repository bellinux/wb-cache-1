5|$|A {{modus vivendi}} had been {{achieved}} between Warwick {{and the king}} for some months, but the restoration of Henry Percy to Montagu's earldom of Northumberland prevented any chance of full reconciliation.

Four people were killed in the disaster and seventeen were injured, as an entire corner of the building slid <b>away.</b> <b>The</b> collapse caused major changes in UK building regulations and led to the decline of further building of high rise council flats that had characterised 1960s public architecture.|$|E
5|$|As {{noted by}} Arthur M. Greenhall:If there is fur {{on the skin}} of the host, the common vampire bat uses its canine and cheek teeth like a barber's blades to shave <b>away</b> <b>the</b> hairs. The bat's razor-sharp upper incisor teeth then make a 7mm wide and 8mm deep cut. The upper incisors lack enamel, which keeps them {{permanently}} razor sharp. Their teeth are so sharp, even handling their skulls in a museum can result in cuts.|$|E
5|$|As rain {{continued}} to fall, the slightly acidic rainwater dissolved the limestone. As limestone wore <b>away,</b> <b>the</b> groundwater {{came into contact}} with the land surface and created a massive wetland ecosystem. Although the region appears flat, weathering of the limestone created slight valleys and plateaus in some areas. These plateaus rise and fall only a few inches, but on the subtle South Florida topography these small variations affect both the flow of water and the types of vegetation that can take hold.|$|E

5|$|As the {{collapse}} continues, the rotation rate can increase {{to the point}} where the accreting protostar can break up due to centrifugal force at the equator. Thus the rotation rate must be braked during the first 100,000years to avoid this scenario. One possible explanation for the braking is the interaction of the protostar's magnetic field with the stellar wind in magnetic braking. The expanding wind carries <b>away</b> <b>the</b> angular momentum and slows down the rotation rate of the collapsing protostar.|$|E
5|$|As {{was common}} {{practice}} with upper-class {{children of the}} time, Edward and his younger siblings were brought up by nannies rather than directly by their parents.

His subsequent crying and wailing would lead the Duke and Duchess to send him and the nanny <b>away.</b> <b>The</b> nanny was discharged after her mistreatment of the children was discovered.|$|E
