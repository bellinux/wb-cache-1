25|$|In true Robin and Patrick fashion, they cannot get on {{the same}} page - just when Robin realizes she does want to marry him, Patrick has finally {{accepted}} the fact that she does not. Mac arrests Patrick and locks the two of them in the PCPD interrogation Room, forcing them to talk. Patrick proposes again and Robin finally says yes. They decide to marry before their daughter is born, and their wedding is set for October 29, 2008. Patrick, thinking he has {{all the time in the}} world, decides to go into the hospital to do last minute rounds. He cuts it close, but signs out on time. However, just as he is about to leave, Anthony Zacchara (Bruce Weitz) is brought in with a stroke and needs emergency surgery. Matt (Jason Cook), Patrick's newly found half brother who's also a neurosurgeon, offers to perform it, but Patrick is afraid that should something go wrong the Zaccharas would go after his brother. Meanwhile, back at the church, everyone waits for Patrick's arrival impatiently and believing that he has a case of cold feet and has left his fiancee at the altar. Robin is the only one who had no fears and no doubts and is certain beyond <b>a</b> <b>shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>doubt</b> that Patrick will be there. Patrick comes running in after a successful surgery and apologizes for his lateness, but Robin is cool-headed; she knew he would be there. Mac walks her down the aisle, as her father Robert is still getting treatment for his cancer overseas.|$|E

"Witness 62" [...] {{added that}} {{on the day of}} the Jonesborough ambush, the IRA had placed a [...] "spotter" [...] on the road from Dundalk to observe which {{direction}} Breen and Buchanan would take to return north. Having noted the road the RUC officers had taken, the spotter immediately alerted the ambush team that Buchanan was driving up the Edenappa Road. He concluded that [...] "without <b>a</b> <b>shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>doubt</b> it [...] was pre-planned".|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} provide female {{students}} a permanent place at MIT, she would donate the money to found Stanley McCormick Hall, an all female dormitory that would allow MIT to house 200 female students. Katharine's funding made a tremendous impact {{of the number of}} women at MIT, increasing from 3% to 40%. The ramifications of the hall are best stated by William Hecht '61, {{executive vice president of the}} Association of Alumni and Alumnae of MIT when he said, [...] "the visible presence of women at MIT helped open up the science and engineering professions to a large part of the population that before had been excluded. It demonstrated beyond <b>a</b> <b>shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>doubt</b> that at MIT men and women are equal." ...|$|E

[...] He dashed into the cottage, and, reappearing with the burning lamp held at full arm's length, he threw it among a bank of brambles. [...] "We must give the room {{a little time to}} clear.

60|$|Jean {{advanced}} a {{few more}} paces, rifle up, ready to fire the instant Queen lifted a gun. The man's immobility brought the cold sweat to Jean's brow. He stopped to bend the full intense power of his gaze upon this inert figure. Suddenly over Jean flashed its meaning. Queen was dead. He had backed up against the pine, ready to face his foe, and he had died there. Not <b>a</b> <b>shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>doubt</b> entered Jean's mind as he started forward again. He knew. After all, Queen's blood would not be on his hands. Gordon and Fredericks in their death throes had given the rustler mortal wounds. Jean kept on, marveling the while. How ghastly thin and hard! Those four days of flight had been hell for Queen.|$|E
60|$|His {{house was}} {{apparently}} open in Sir Roger's interest. Beer, at any rate, was flowing there as elsewhere; and scarlet ribbons going in--not, perhaps, {{in a state}} of perfect steadiness--came out more unsteady than before. Still had Mr Reddypalm been deaf to the voice of that charmer, Closerstil, though he had charmed with all his wisdom. Mr Reddypalm had stated, first his unwillingness to vote at all:--he had, he said, given over politics, and was not inclined to trouble his mind again with the subject; then he had spoken of his great devotion to the Duke of Omnium, under whose grandfathers his grandfather had been bred: Mr Nearthewinde had, as he said, been with him, and proved to him beyond <b>a</b> <b>shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>doubt</b> that it would show the deepest ingratitude on his part to vote against the duke's candidate.|$|E

60|$|There was not <b>a</b> <b>shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>doubt</b> on {{his mind}} as to the {{identity}} of the Australian--nor as to that of Crinkett's companion. At the moment he did not remember the man's name, but he knew him as a miner with whom he had been familiar at Ahalala, and who had been in partnership both with himself and Crinkett at Nobble,--as one who had, alas! been in his society when Euphemia Smith had been there also. At that instant he remembered the fact that the man had called Euphemia Smith Mrs. Caldigate in his presence, and that he had let the name pass without remonstrance. The memory of that moment flashed across him now as he quickly turned back his face towards his child who was still uttering his little wail in the arms of the clergyman.|$|E

"'Things {{stolen from}} a god are frightfully dangerous,' he said, 'for the Brahmins or priests {{connected}} with the temples {{have been known to}} follow them up for years, and in nine cases out of ten they get possession of them again.

I know that my clothes, my drawers, and everything belonging to me have been gone through at night a score of times. Nothing has been stolen, but, being a methodical man, I could generally see some displacement in the things that told me they had been disturbed, They gave it up for a time, but I haven't <b>a</b> <b>shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>doubt</b> that they have been watching me ever since, and they may be watching me now, for anything I know. Now, half of that fortune I have left by my will to your son; half to the girl. I will tell you where the things are the last thing before I die.|$|E
60|$|Aggregation of the Protoplasm {{from the}} Action of Carbonate of Ammonia.--I have fully {{described}} in the third chapter the remarkable effects of moderately strong doses of this salt in causing the aggregation of the protoplasm within {{the cells of the}} glands and tentacles; and here my object is merely to show what small doses suffice. A leaf was immersed in twenty minims (1.183 ml.) of a solution of one part to 1750 of water, [page 146] and another leaf in the same quantity of a solution of one part to 3062; in the former case aggregation occurred in 4 m., in the latter in 11 m. A leaf was then immersed in twenty minims of a solution of one part to 4375 of water, so that it received 1/240 of a grain (.27 mg.); in 5 m. there was a slight change of colour in the glands, and in 15 m. small spheres of protoplasm were formed in the cells beneath the glands of all the tentacles. In these cases there could not be <b>a</b> <b>shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>doubt</b> about the action of the solution.|$|E
