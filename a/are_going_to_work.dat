[...] Anders also said that this song is [...] "her asking when things <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> out," [...] and commented that it was [...] "emotional" [...] and thought that it would bring people to tears.

500|$|The Economist heralded the book's publication, saying [...] "If {{there is}} no place for Watership Down in children’s bookshops, then children’s {{literature}} is dead." [...] Peter Prescott, senior book reviewer at Newsweek, gave the novel a glowing review: [...] "Adams handles his suspenseful narrative more dextrously than most authors who claim to write adventure novels, but his true achievement lies in the consistent, comprehensible and altogether enchanting civilisation that he has created." [...] Kathleen J. Rothen and Beverly Langston identified the work as one that [...] "subtly speaks to a child", with [...] "engaging characters and fast-paced action [...] make it readable." [...] This echoed Nicholas Tucker's praise for the story's suspense in the New Statesman: [...] "Adams ... has bravely and successfully resurrected the big picaresque adventure story, with moments of such tension that the helplessly involved reader finds himself checking whether things <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> out all right on the next page before daring to finish the preceding one." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{receiving}} {{reports of}} mass casualties and destruction at Pass-a-Grille, the American Red Cross stocked a United States Navy subchaser with pine caskets and relief supplies, but found no bodies {{and only a}} fraction of the reported damage. Because of fears that the hurricane might hinder the Florida land boom of the 1920s, rebuilding and cleanup of the area commenced quickly and the land boom in the Tampa Bay region and in southern Florida continued. Local officials, businessmen, realtors, and later the press soon attempted to cover up or downplay the damage, which threatened to distort Tampa's advertised image as the [...] "Year Round City". On October28, a writer for The Tampa Tribune stated, [...] "Everyone is accepting the storm as an incident and all <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> to rebuild the devastated areas, with the firm conviction that there will not be another storm of such severity during the life of anyone now living." [...] One of the destroyed buildings at the Ballist Point Pavilion was soon rebuilt after the storm. However, the building was destroyed again by fire in 1922. In 1925, a new pavilion was built. On Captiva Island, the Wayside Chapel suffered extensive damage, but was repaired and reopened as Captiva School and Chapel-by-the-Sea, which has been listed as a National Historic Place since 2013. Many farmers on the island sold their land for a significantly reduced price to Clarence B. Chadwick, who would transform more than [...] of property into the South Seas Island Resort.|$|E

2500|$|In April 2007, the Institute {{announced}} its [...] "Commitment to New Orleans" [...] initiative {{which includes the}} relocation of the program to the campus of Loyola University New Orleans from Los Angeles. Blanchard had passionately lobbied the Institute to relocate saying, [...] "After Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans was shaken and its musical roots were threatened. I grew up in this city and learned about jazz here at Loyola with other young jazz musicians like Wynton and Branford Marsalis and I know that the Institute will have {{a great impact on}} jazz and in our communities.

2500|$|He {{also argued}} that a {{proposed}} £26,000-a-year benefits cap, would {{not lead to a}} rise in homelessness or child poverty [...] "The reality is that with £26,000 a year, it’s very difficult to believe that families will be plunged into poverty – children or adults," [...] he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. [...] "Capping at average earnings of £35,000 before tax and £26,000 after, actually means that we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with families make sure that they will find a way out." [...] but added there would need to be [...] "discretionary measures". Duncan Smith led the governments legislation in the House of Commons in January 2013 to cap most benefit increases at 1%, a real terms cut.|$|E

The garment collapsed and her breast was accidentally revealed." [...] CBS forced Jackson to release a video apology, and said [...] "My decision to change the Super Bowl performance was made after the final rehearsal. MTV, CBS, [...] the NFL {{had no knowledge of}} this whatsoever and unfortunately, the whole thing went wrong in the end. I am really sorry if I offended anyone, that was truly not my intention". Jackson later commented, [...] "Sometimes they cut out that I said it was an accident" [...] when the statement was replayed in the media. A written statement read, [...] "The decision to have a costume reveal {{at the end of my}} halftime show performance was made after final rehearsals. MTV was completely unaware of it. It was not my intention that it go as far as it did. I apologize to anyone offended – including the audience, MTV, CBS and the NFL." [...] Due to the event being accidental and unintentional, Jackson refused to release another apology statement to media outlets following this. Speaking to USA Today, Jackson said, [...] "It's truly embarrassing for me to know that 90 million [...] people saw my breast, and then to see it blown up on the Internet the size of a computer screen ... but there are much worse things in the world, and for this to be such a focus, I don't understand." [...] Regarding continued backlash, she responded, [...] "Who knows...Maybe they'll get mad at something that I do in my show, but at least it won't be new to me, since I've already gone through all of this. But I feel very positive that things <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> out just fine. Everything happens for a reason." ...|$|E
