Each person was given freely by his neighbors whatever he required for his use, which is as much as anyone may reasonably desire. Every one worked half the time and played half the time, and the people enjoyed the work as much as they did the play, because it is good to be occupied and to have something to do. There were no cruel overseers set to watch them, and no one to rebuke them or to find fault with them. So each one was proud to do all he could for his friends and neighbors, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> when they would accept the things he produced.|$|E

Watson said, [...] "It's a tough situation we are in. We can't hurt the whalers and we have to stay within the boundaries of the law in opposing illegal whaling operations.

500|$|In contrast, Amy Kaufman from Los Angeles Times {{opined that}} Cavallari was more {{intriguing}} than Conrad, whose storylines she felt had been overshadowed as the series progressed.

Julie Miller from Movieline was critical of the episode's [...] "staged showdowns", but nonetheless noted that the series [...] "continues to compel" [...] like professional wrestling and enjoyed {{a scene in which}} Jenner became irritated with Nicole, labeling it the sole genuine reaction of the episode.

The introduction of the item rental system was well received, with many reviewers {{pointing out that the}} system granted players with more freedom. Ryckert loved having items available from the beginning, saying that it allowed him to experiment in combat. Both MacDonald and Gies agreed that losing rented items upon defeat added another layer of challenge and consequence to the game. Nintendo Life reviewer, Martin Watts found that streamlining the item system allowed the game to place a greater emphasis aspects such as exploration, solving puzzles and boss fights.

Her first appearance in a theatrical musical was the short-lived Anyone Can Whistle, written by Arthur Laurents and Stephen Sondheim. An experimental work, it opened at the Majestic Theatre on Broadway in April 1964, but was critically panned and closed after nine performances. Lansbury had {{played the role of}} crooked mayoress Cora Hoover Hooper, and although she loved Sondheim's score she faced personal differences with Laurents <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> when the show closed. She appeared in The Greatest Story Ever Told (1965), a cinematic biopic of Jesus, but was cut almost entirely from the final edit. She {{followed this}} with an appearance as Mama Jean Bello in Harlow (1965), as Lady Blystone in The Amorous Adventures of Moll Flanders (1965), and as Gloria in Mister Buddwing (1966).

500|$|Danielle {{was killed}} off minutes after {{revealing}} her true identity to Ronnie, dying in her mother's arms. Although different outcomes to the storyline were considered, Santer explained that Danielle dying best preserved Ronnie's status as EastEnders [...] "tragic heroine character". Treadwell-Collins felt that to allow Ronnie {{to have her}} daughter, the [...] "one thing that is key to her character" [...] would serve to progressively weaken her character, and Santer agreed that while it may initially be touching, ultimately the relationship would become boring. The scene in which Danielle dies was filmed during winter, but as it was set in early April, snow had to be cleared away from the set before filming could commence. A body double {{was used for the}} moment Danielle was run over. Although sad to leave, Crace felt that the story's conclusion was the right one, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> that Ronnie and Danielle finally shared a brief moment in the end, explaining: [...] "It was so important that that tender moment was finally found, because that's all people wanted.

Burton also said his late-race vibration was enough to scare him <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> the race ended because of the amount of shudder coming from his car: [...] "I screamed, ‘We’ve got a wheel loose, we got a wheel loose’ and they said, {{we do not have a}} wheel loose, we know we got them tight." ...|$|E

Yarrell gave invaluable advice, and bargained with shopkeepers so Darwin paid £50 for two pistols and a rifle, while FitzRoy had spent £400 on firearms. On Sunday 11 September, FitzRoy and Darwin took the steam packet for Portsmouth. Darwin was not seasick, and had a pleasant [...] "sail of three days". For {{the first time he}} saw the [...] "very small" [...] cramped ship, met the officers, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> to get a large cabin, shared with the assistant surveyor John Lort Stokes.

500|$|The second {{televised}} debate organised by the Finnish Broadcasting Company on 14 April was {{the last}} before the election and it included all the eight parliamentary parties. The economy was a dominant theme of the debate. Jutta Urpilainen reiterated her claim that the incumbent government was furthering {{the establishment of a}} flat tax. She also accused the government for advancing the interests of the richest percentage {{at the expense of the}} poor people. Jyrki Katainen denied the claims, but the two main governing coalition parties, the NCP and the Centre Party, were the only parties opposed to increasing welfare for the unemployed. Prime Minister Mari Kiviniemi of the Centre Party had previously been quiet on spending cuts, but when pressed on the issue by the debate's moderator she was rather indiscreet on cutting funding for the public sector and the Defence Forces. However, she still insisted that cuts may not be necessary if the economic growth is sufficiently high in the following years. Cuts on defence spending were supported by most parties, but Timo Soini contested this by saying that national security can not depend on economic conjectures. The crisis concerning the breaches against the campaign funding laws during the previous electoral campaign in 2007 was also discussed. Kiviniemi admitted that mistakes had been made. Soini called the mishandling an example of corruption <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> that it was exposed.
