5|$|Linda Schuyler had co-created The Kids of Degrassi Street in 1979 with Kit Hood, and Yan Moore was {{a writer}} on that series. As the {{children}} grew up, the Degrassi franchise developed into Degrassi Junior High and Degrassi High. In 1999 two episodes of Jonovision, a CBC Television talk show aimed at teenagers, reunited some of the cast members from the series. At the same time, Schuyler and Moore were developing a new television drama. When the Jonovision reunion episode proved to be popular, Schuyler and Moore wondered about reuniting the characters, too. As the months passed, they began thinking <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> have happened to the characters of Degrassi High and realized that the character Emma Nelson, born {{at the end of}} Degrassi Junior Highs second season, would soon be entering junior high school. Stephen Stohn, Schuyler's husband suggested Degrassi: The Next Generation as the name for the new sequel series, borrowing the concept from , of which he was a fan.|$|E
5|$|Stone {{had fallen}} ill with {{appendicitis}} {{during the previous}} leg of the voyage; he was hospitalised in Dakar and took no further part in the adventure. Orsborne was able to obtain further fuel and water, but Girl Pats arrival {{attracted the attention of}} the local Lloyd's agent, who had been on the lookout for the vessel. On 26 May he saw Orsborne and inspected the log book, where he discovered the false names and other inconsistencies. Orsborne was asked to present the ship's papers at the British consulate but, on the pretext that he needed to test the engines, he rapidly put to sea. The appearance of Girl Pat in Dakar—the first confirmation since Corcubión that the vessel was still afloat—was widely reported. Relatives of the crew members were relieved that those aboard were safe but were apprehensive <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> lie ahead.|$|E
25|$|There was no autopsy held on Dan or Steve, {{and there}} have been many stories <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> have happened.

Several politicians and FPV institutions issued warnings <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> happen if Macri were elected president. According to Scioli, {{the campaign was}} intended to encourage public awareness. It was rumored that the campaign might have been suggested by Brazilian João Santana, who organized a similar campaign in Brazil during the ballotage of Dilma Rousseff and Aécio Neves.|$|E
25|$|During most dreams, {{the person}} dreaming is {{not aware that}} they are dreaming, no matter how absurd or {{eccentric}} the dream is. The reason for this {{may be that the}} prefrontal cortex, the region of the brain responsible for logic and planning, exhibits decreased activity during dreams. This allows the dreamer to more actively interact with the dream without thinking <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> happen, since things that would normally stand out in reality blend in with the dream scenery.|$|E

Wills and inventories of possessions of families {{of a similar}} economic level inform us <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> {{be found in a}} similar household. Period paintings help answer questions concerning the disposition of furniture about the room, possible color schemes, and the sort of textiles that might have been used. Through paintings, for example, we learn that mid-Eastern carpets were too valuable to place on the floor but rather were displayed on tabletops and then in turn covered with white linen cloths during meals.|$|E

25|$|The {{revolution}} of African slaves brought many fears to colonies surrounding Haiti and the Caribbean. Prominent wealthy American slave owners, {{reading about the}} revolution, also read speculation <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> come in their own states. However, newspapers like the Colombian Centinel took the extra steps to support the revolution, {{in the sense that}} it was based on the foundations of the American Revolution. The French media also played an important role in the Haitian Revolution, with contributions that made many French upstarts quite interested in the young, passionate Toussaint's writings of freedom.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} notable periods of Malta's history is the temple period, {{starting}} around 3600 BC. The Ġgantija Temple in Gozo {{is one of the}} oldest free-standing buildings in the world. The name of the complex stems from the Maltese word ġgant, which reflects the magnitude of the temple's size. Many of the temples are in the form of five semicircular rooms connected at the centre. It has been suggested that these might have represented the head, arms and legs of a deity, since one of the commonest kinds of statue found in these temples is a fat woman — a symbol of fertility. The Temple period lasted until about 2500 BC, at which point the civilization that raised these huge monoliths seems to have disappeared. There is much speculation <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> have happened and whether they were completely wiped out or assimilated.|$|E
25|$|Many {{have speculated}} <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> have {{happened}} had Pauling {{been able to}} travel to Britain as planned in May 1952. As it was, his political activities caused his travel to be restricted by the United States government {{and he did not}} visit the UK until later, at which point he met none of the DNA researchers in England. At any rate he was preoccupied with proteins at the time, not DNA. Watson and Crick were not officially working on DNA. Crick was writing his Ph.D. thesis; Watson also had other work such as trying to obtain crystals of myoglobin for X-ray diffraction experiments. In 1952, Watson performed X-ray diffraction on tobacco mosaic virus and found results indicating that it had helical structure. Having failed once, Watson and Crick were now somewhat reluctant to try again and for a while they were forbidden to make further efforts to find a molecular model of DNA.|$|E

It predicted that the Oregon Theatre could become [...] "McMenamins Mophouse & Brewery", referring to the McMenamins regional chain of breweries, historic hotels, music venues and pubs. Willamette Week wrote, [...] "When one of the nation's last adult theaters finally succumbs to market pressure, McMenamins rehabs the space while keeping its historic character alive with 'voyeur' dining booths, a sticky dance floor and VIP dining in the bored projectionist's perch." [...] In 2014, Willamette Week called the theater [...] "seedy".|$|E
500|$|Author Santiago Fouz-Hernández commented in {{his book}} Madonna's Drowned Worlds that to him the song felt like a trepiditation of Madonna's {{thoughts}} <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> be termed [...] "girlhood" [...] and on a broadscale, on [...] "feminity". Christopher P. Andersen, author of Madonna: Unauthorized, described [...] "Dear Jessie" [...] as [...] "a wistfully psychedelic confection of carousels and pink elephants", adding that [...] "the song harkens back to the lullabies your mother must have sang to you". Robin Anne Reid, author of Women in Science Fiction and Fantasy: Overviews, complimented the fact that [...] "although the sort of fantasies that [...] conjures might trend towards the kinky and sexual, she can also delve {{into a world of}} mermaids, fountains of youth, leprechauns and magic lanterns as is evident by 'Dear Jessie'." ...|$|E
500|$|In the 82nd Congress, Senator Bricker {{introduced}} {{the first version}} of his amendment, S.J. Res. 102, drafted by Bricker and his staff. [...] The American Bar Association was still studying the issue of how to prevent an abuse of [...] "treaty law" [...] when Bricker introduced his resolution on July 17, 1951, without the ABA's involvement, but the Senator wanted to begin immediate debate on an issue he considered vital. [...] Bricker was not trying to reverse the Yalta Agreement, in contrast to the goals of some of his conservative colleagues; he was worried most <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> be done by the United Nations or under an executive agreement. A second proposal, S.J. Res 130, was introduced by Bricker on February 7, 1952, with fifty-eight co-sponsors, including every Republican except Eugene Millikin of Colorado.|$|E

500|$|Newcomers Amanda Detmer and Chad E. Donella {{were cast}} as {{students}} Terry Chaney and Tod Waggner, respectively. [...] "When I first read the script, {{the thing that}} struck me most was that the characters were well-written and the relationships between them were strong and believable," [...] Detmer said. [...] "That's important, {{because you have to}} care about these people in order to be worried <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> happen to them". [...] Detmer defined Terry as [...] "very put-together [...] seems content to defer to [...] – to not make waves. But the stress of what happens affects their relationship and interestingly enough brings out a certain strength in her". On the other hand, Donella observed how similar his role was to himself. [...] "I believe in fate. I think you come into this life with some things to accomplish and you're taken out earlier or later depending on the game plan".|$|E
500|$|With the single's cover art and its {{accompanying}} music video, Madonna {{ushered in}} another image change, {{inspired by the}} look of Hollywood actress Jean Harlow. The black and white video was directed by photographer Melodie McDaniel, who was chosen by the singer due to McDaniel's previous short films. It features Madonna as a singer in a nightclub in Harlem, New York. Interspersed with scenes of daily life in the neighborhood, the video ends with Madonna uniting with her lover and their supposed child. The video sparked academic discussions <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> constitute the lyrical secret of the song. Madonna performed [...] "Secret" [...] on tour for the first time during her 2001 Drowned World Tour. It was later performed at the Houston stop of her Sticky and Sweet Tour in November 2008 as a fan request, and on the Rebel Heart Tour in 2015.|$|E
500|$|Writing for the Chicago Tribune, Achy Obejas {{called the}} {{recording}} a fragmentary work {{and said it}} is [...] "Selena's past and <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> have been". Obejas called the record [...] "full of promise and flaws", and said its intentional bilingual nature was done by [...] "necessity rather than design". She also said the album is a Latino crossover nix, citing Gloria Estefan's earlier mainstream work as the primitive Latino crossover; although Selena [...] "didn't get {{to take the next}} step" [...] as did Estefan. Objeas also wrote that the album is the opposite of a [...] "masterpiece, or definitive, or even a testament to Selena's talents", but is more of a [...] "smorgasbord". Objeas praised Selena's [...] "complete ease on the R tunes" [...] and thought she was [...] "getting funky and pretty soulful". Enrique Lopetegui of The Los Angeles Times said Dreaming of You is Selena's [...] "most electric and satisfying album", and said it was an applicable [...] "epitaph" [...] for her. Lopetegui called the songs on the album [...] "radio-friendly pop tunes" [...] but said the album [...] "lacks cohesion" [...] and that he finds the bilingual album [...] "even more interesting than the original idea". According to Lopetegui, Selena [...] "blossoms into a full-fledged soul singer, with an aggressiveness seldom show before" [...] on her English-language tracks but finds the rancheras [...] "Tú Sólo Tú" [...] and [...] "El Toro Relajo" [...] the [...] "most impressive" [...] and saying Selena was inexperienced with that style. Christopher John Farley of Time magazine said Dreaming of You elevated Selena's music [...] "to a far wider audience than she ever had when she was alive". He said the album incorporates her [...] "finest, most enjoyable work" [...] and called it [...] "a commendable but sorrowful accomplishment". Contrasting her Tejano and English-language songs, Farley wrote that Selena's Tejano recordings was sometimes clumsy, whereas her English pop songs were [...] "sweet, pure and clear, and on the mariachi numbers, Selena shows off a voice that is sexy, strong and gracefully maturing".|$|E

Stephen Knight in the Sydney Morning Herald wrote: Blood is a Stranger is a skilful and thoughtful thriller... with a busy plot and some interesting, unnerving speculations <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> be {{going on in the}} world of lasers, yellowcake (uranium mining and manufacture) and Asian politics—things that most people prefer to ignore in favour of more simple and familiar puzzles.’ ...|$|E
2500|$|The Victoria Police {{launched}} a formal investigation into Holt's disappearance {{the day after}} it occurred. Jack Ford, a former homicide detective, was chosen to head the investigation, with Aubrey Jackson of the Commonwealth Police assisting. The resulting police report was released on 5 January 1968, but did not record any definitive findings {{due to a lack}} of evidence. Senior pathologist James McNamara was consulted <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> have happened to Holt's body, and suggested that it may have trapped by kelp and then consumed by sea creatures (specifically sharks, crayfish, and/or sea lice). If that were the case, [...] "the body would have been reduced to a skeleton in a period as short as 24 to 48 hours". The federal government declined to conduct its own inquiry into Holt's disappearance, as it was considered uncontroversial and his family did not want one.|$|E
