40|$|The present {{research}} explored the metacognitive reading strategies used by university {{students and the}} correlation between metacognitive reading strategies (Global, Problem-Solving, <b>and</b> Support <b>reading</b> strategies) <b>and</b> <b>reading</b> comprehension. Specifically, the objectives of this research are four-folds, namely to identify metacognitive reading strategies used by the students during reading, to find the correlation between Global Reading Strategies (GLOB) <b>and</b> <b>reading</b> comprehension, to find the correlation between Problem-Solving Reading Strategies (PROB) <b>and</b> <b>reading</b> comprehension, <b>and</b> to find the correlation between Support Reading Strategies (SUPP) <b>and</b> <b>reading</b> comprehension. A survey on metacognitive <b>reading</b> strategies <b>and</b> a <b>reading</b> comprehension test were administered to identify students’ metacognitive <b>reading</b> strategies <b>and</b> comprehension performance. The subjects were 31 students of English Department at a university in Surabaya. The findings revealed that students preferred to use PROB reading strategies the most, followed by GLOB <b>reading</b> strategies, <b>and</b> SUPP <b>reading</b> strategies. This finding on prime preferences indicates that students {{had a tendency to}} concentrate and monitor their comprehension, particularly when they had difficulties in doing the reading test. In terms of correlation, the findings revealed that (1) a positive, moderate (at. 66) correlation between GLOB strategies <b>and</b> <b>reading</b> comprehension, (2) a positive, strong correlation (at. 72) between PROB strategies <b>and</b> <b>reading</b> comprehension, <b>and</b> (3) a positive, weak correlation (at. 26) between SUPP strategies <b>and</b> <b>reading</b> comprehension. In general, the overall correlation between metacognitive <b>reading</b> strategies <b>and</b> <b>reading</b> comprehension was positive and strong at. 79.

40|$|Although {{evidence}} suggests that individual differences in <b>reading</b> <b>and</b> mathematics skills are correlated, this relationship has typically only been studied in relation to word decoding or global measures of reading.

Multivariate genetic analyses of latent phenotypic factors of mathematics, word decoding <b>and</b> <b>reading</b> comprehension revealed substantial genetic and shared environmental correlations among all three domains. However, the phenotypic and genetic correlations between mathematics <b>and</b> <b>reading</b> comprehension were significantly greater than between mathematics and word decoding.
