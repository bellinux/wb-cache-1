40|$|Learning in {{academic}} settings is {{strongly related to}} the way the students are tested or examined. Assessment therefore must be integrated in the curriculum design, coordinated and should reflect the learning outcomes of the education. Assessment within the field of implant dentistry must fulfil four major objectives: complete and direct the learning process with feedback (formative), ensure that students are adequately prepared (summative), assess attitudes and skills such as critical thinking, reflection and self-assessment ability, and supply continuous feedback to teachers on curricular content and impact. Different assessment methods should be used to assess different levels of competencies throughout the curriculum. Various forms of written or oral assessment methodologies are applicable at earlier stages in the curriculum. At intermediate levels, interactive assessment methods, such as patient simulations (paper based or virtual) and more could encourage the necessary synthesis of several disciplines and aspects of the theoretical knowledge. At higher levels of competence, documentation of clinical proficiency by means of reflective portfolios and diaries is an appropriate assessment method with both formative and summative potential. The highest level of competence requires performance assessment using structured, objective, clinical criteria. The group strongly encourages the use of reflective forms of assessment methods which engage the students in a process of self-appraisal, identification of individual learning needs and self-directed learning. The ultimate goal of this would be to allow the student to develop <b>a</b> <b>lifelong</b> <b>learning</b> <b>attitude.</b> © 2009 Blackwell Munksgaard. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to enhance {{understanding}} of the experience of qualified nurses managing the process of learning through work when enrolled on a work-based learning module.  Design/methodology/approach – The study was based on constructivist grounded theory using semi-structured interviews with purposive and theoretical sampling of 13 health professionals across acute and community settings. Constant comparative method of data analysis used.  Findings – A core category revealed a social process of learning to learn through work as the nurse shifted from a relatively passive view of the self in the workplace to one that actively constructed an environment that facilitated the realisation of learning objectives. The outcome was the development of metacognition skills of learning to learn promoting intentional learning behaviour towards <b>a</b> <b>lifelong</b> <b>learning</b> <b>attitude.</b> Research limitations/implications – If knowledge generated from work-based learning is to nourish the organisation, there needs to be opportunities for knowledge exchange in the workplace, consistent mentor support, protective time and a positive attitude to learning in work from colleagues. The study did not include master's students.  Originality/value – While studies have highlighted the influence and impact of organisations on the quality and scope of learning through work, less is known about how health care professionals, in particular qualified nurses, learn to learn in the workplace. This study is of value to those investigating and supporting individuals learning through work-based learning. Threshold concepts and troublesome knowledge introduce a creative perspective to explore the meaning of learning through work...|$|E
40|$|Innovation {{and high}} growth {{technological}} {{companies have been}} set as a priority in Europe. Recently, the European Union declared "Entrepreneurship and Innovation {{are central to the}} creative process in the economy and to promoting growth, increasing productivity and creating jobs. Entrepreneurs sense opportunities and take risks in the face of uncertainty to open new markets, design products and develop innovative processes. '' The most innovative firms, which seek early-stage, external financing, have the potential promise of substantial returns but a concomitant high level of risk. It is within the context of such firms that the potential of venture capital, as a source of entrepreneurial support, appears most relevant. However, many barriers hinder the development of venture capital in Europe, and in particular in France. Innovators are not only vulnerable at the outset but are faced with an interminable series of obstacles to creativity. The main handicaps and obstacles are those affecting the coordination of efforts, human resources, private or public financing and the legal and regulatory environment. This thesis analyzes the current situation of venture capital and entrepreneurship in France, compares it to the overall situation in Europe and in the United States. It eventually delvers some policy recommendations aimed at fostering both the supply and demand of venture capital in France. The main challenge is probably best summarized as one of flexibility. Regulations and procedures of all sorts need to be re-engineered to encourage and promote the fluid development of businesses. Flexibility to adopt new cultural mindsets: risk-taking behavior, different attitudes towards initiative, success and failure. Flexibility to adopt <b>a</b> <b>lifelong</b> <b>learning</b> <b>attitude</b> and regularly retrain. Ultimately, entrepreneurship and the development of venture capital in France is about action rather than analysis, and, despite its high potential, France has still much to achieve. by James H.

40|$|Knowledge, {{which is}} the most {{significant}} characteristic of today’s knowledge society, has been changing and improving very rapidly. Particularly, the developments in science and technology have been influencing social, economical and cultural life; thus professions and descriptions of professions have been continuously renewed. In addition, the needed profile of man power relevant to the changing professions has been changing continuously and the learnt knowledge has not been prevalent. For this reason, {{there is a need for}} the individuals to update their knowledge and skills continuously in order to adopt themselves to the technological changes and new work conditions. Lifelong learning approach can provide societies and individuals with opportunities to catch up with these changes and developments. In raising individuals as lifelong learners, teachers play a big role. In order to establish lifelong learning societies, first of all teachers should have all the characteristics of lifelong learning. This is why it is extremely important to determine what the attitudes of the teachers are towards lifelong learning approach. However, there has not been developed any scale measuring teachers’ attitudes towards lifelong learning approach so far. Therefore, in this current study, it is aimed to develop a scale to determine what the attitudes of the teachers are towards lifelong learning approach. The subject group is consisted of 300 teachers, working in the schools of the Northern Cyprus. The findings on the validity of the structure of the scale are measured by the factor analysis. As a result of the analysis, <b>a</b> <b>lifelong</b> <b>learning</b> <b>attitude</b> scale is developed with 19 items in three sub-dimensions (LLLAS). The sub-dimensions of the scale are formed in the following expressions: “reluctance to learn”, “belief in the benefits of learning activities for professional development”, “awareness of personal learning skills”. As the result of the validity and reliability analysis, it was decided that the scale (LLLAS) would be appropriate in terms of its characteristics to be used in future studies...|$|E
40|$|The Lifelong Learning and Library Connection as a {{model for}} {{tertiary}} library customer education examined the transitional skill and ability expectations of undergraduate tertiary education students to propose a Perceptual Model of lifelong learning as an alternative to behavioural and relational models which are more experientially or practice based. The hypothesis was that the personal perceptions of customers can mirror personal reality. What customers believe can predict what they will pursue. Therefore a Perceptual Model can offer the advantage of facilitating lifelong learning through library customer education approaches geared to the sequential levels of skills needed by customer groups. The perceptual model proposed is comprised of areas that, according to literature, can most affect the lifelong learning skills and abilities of students. It considered the affect of perceptions on these areas rather than measuring skills as in other models. The model may be visualized as a ladder that sequentially leads to higher level skills as perceptual awareness of information needs increases. Using details obtained from literature reviewed about the theoretical and practical applications of lifelong learning and the role of tertiary libraries, questions on the perceptions of customers were raised. Literature was categorized into four foci: customer group segmentation; library use issues; library skills assessment; and library integration into tertiary life. Literature portrayed gaps in customer perceptions research in these areas. These gaps were manipulated to encapsulate the key questions, concepts and principals for the study. These were: • Segmentation (Focus A) – What are the most appropriate divisions of customer groups to facilitate a lifelong learning development through library customer education? What are the segments customers belong to and do these groups have homogeneous customer education needs? What are the lifelong learning needs to be met or assisted by the library through customer education? • Library Issues (Focus B); Skills Assessment (Focus C); Course Integration (Focus D) – What are customer 2 ̆ 7 s personal methodologies for using libraries and information resources, and the library use rationale or personal feelings and motivations associated with using libraries and information resources? What are the personal perceptions of students regarding the value of library customer education required for the library to positively influence lifelong learning behaviour and philosophies? What are the future directions for the library to improve their lifelong learning role through customer education? One of the primary goals of libraries is to facilitate lifelong learning. These are the pivotal points for lifelong learning but because personal perceptions are developed by individuals over many years, library customer education is required to help develop <b>a</b> <b>lifelong</b> <b>learning</b> <b>attitude.</b> This case study targeted the students of a tertiary institute to assist in identifying the most affective library customer education segment focus for fostering lifelong learning attitudinal and skill development.

40|$|There is a proverb in China: huo dao lao, xue dao lao, {{which means}} keep on {{learning}} {{as long as}} you live. Though this is an ancient thought for <b>Lifelong</b> <b>Learning,</b> the meaning of the current research in <b>Lifelong</b> <b>Learning</b> is still up to date. Kessels (2001) stated that our society is gradually moving towards a knowledge economy: an economy in which the application of knowledge replaces the importance of capital, raw materials, and labor as the main means of production. He suggests that knowledge productivity will remain the dominant economic factor in a knowledge society. He defined knowledge productivity as the ability to gather information, generate new knowledge, disseminate, and apply this knowledge to achieve stepwise improvement and radical innovation. Kessels (2001) concluded that the demand for knowledge productivity and the importance of continuous learning are described as {{the two sides of the}} same coin. Kessels’ statement stresses that continuous learning is of vital importance in a knowledge society. DeSimone, Werner and Harris (2002) acknowledged that organizations face many challenges as a new century unfolds before us. The increasing globalization and technological revolution (in particular, the Internet) have been identified as two primary factors that make for a new competitive landscape. Given the rapid changes that all organizations face, it is clear that employees must continue the learning process throughout their careers in order to meet these challenges. DeSimone, Werner and Harris (2002) suggested that organizations must find a way to provide <b>Lifelong</b> <b>Learning</b> opportunities to all of their employees, and meeting the need for <b>lifelong</b> individual <b>learning</b> is one of the present five challenges, which is currently facing the field of HRD. <b>Lifelong</b> <b>Learning</b> is necessary at a national, organizational, and individual level to survive international competition (Van Woerkom, 2003). This project is intended to explore <b>Lifelong</b> <b>Learning</b> arrangements to satisfy the need for <b>Lifelong</b> <b>Learning</b> of employees in Chinese organizations in the context of an emerging knowledge economy. The thesis develops a new conceptual model for <b>Lifelong</b> <b>Learning</b> arrangements. This framework was constructed from the educational system level, the organizational level, personal characteristics, quality of <b>Lifelong</b> <b>Learning</b> and <b>Lifelong</b> <b>Learning</b> <b>attitude</b> and <b>Lifelong</b> <b>Learning</b> behavior aspects. The conceptual model led to a specific research design and the construction of a new data collection instrument, comprising a questionnaire that consists of 74 items. Six organizations participated in this research, two private-owned, two state-owned and two foreign-invested. These firms represent the current three main kinds of companies in China. 648 questionnaires were used to test the reliability of the instrumentation of the conceptual model. At last, the instrument was improved after the deletion of four items from their scale. In addition to the quantitative data, interviews were held in the six participating organizations to reveal the background of the research findings from the questionnaire, which gave more explanation on the data from the questionnaires. On the basis of the interview analysis of the conditions for <b>Lifelong</b> <b>Learning</b> of the six participating organizations, the author provides recommendations for the future of <b>Lifelong</b> <b>Learning</b> in Chinese organizations. A regular regression analysis was used to investigate the effects of education support, organizational level, personal characteristics and quality of <b>Lifelong</b> <b>Learning</b> variables on <b>Lifelong</b> <b>Learning</b> <b>attitude</b> and behavior. Two factors from the organizational level, namely communication and reward system, became the most important predictor variables for both <b>Lifelong</b> <b>Learning</b> <b>attitude</b> and <b>Lifelong</b> <b>Learning</b> behavior. <b>Lifelong</b> <b>Learning</b> <b>attitude</b> and behaviour are directly influenced by communication and reward system. The framework and recommendations outlined in this project are only a starting point and basis to the future <b>Lifelong</b> <b>Learning</b> related research. The general framework for <b>Lifelong</b> <b>Learning</b> arrangements in this research might provide a reference for such actions. Each organization should probe its own practical way related to the specific circumstances. Dahlman, Zeng and Wang (2007) argued that <b>Lifelong</b> <b>Learning</b> research and actions should be open enough to constantly absorb, adapt, and apply new and successful experiences globally and locally. The <b>Lifelong</b> <b>Learning</b> framework in this research also needs constant adjustment and improvement responsive to the changing demands of the economy and society. China’s <b>Lifelong</b> <b>Learning</b> system should be integrated with the evolving global system to keep itself updated (Dahlman, Zeng & Wang, 2007) ...|$|R

40|$|Problem: The cost of {{gathering}} and labelling data is remaining constant, while computing power isbecoming cheaper. Recognizing this, {{the notion of}} <b>a</b> <b>lifelong</b> <b>learning</b> agent has been proposed. <b>A</b> <b>lifelong</b> <b>learning</b> agent is <b>a</b> system that learns knowledge and, when thereafter learning novel tasks, can use thisknowledge to increase the accuracy of what is learned or {{to reduce the number}} of examples necessary for learning. Many open problems exist: can an agent exploit multiple sources of learned knowledge, to whatdegree will an agent benefit from different types of learned knowledge, what types of knowledge should be made available, how should the agent adapt as a new task arrives, how might the order of task arrival impactlearning, and of course, how should such an agent be built? Impact: <b>A</b> <b>lifelong</b> <b>learning</b> agent offers the promise of learning from substantially fewer examples. Currently, we have shown situations were the number of examples required to learn a task have been halved. Understanding how and where <b>a</b> <b>lifelong</b> agent can be applied would allow systems to be built that efficientlylearn novel tasks. State of the Art: This problem area is still quite young and fertile, and so there is quite a wide diversityof approaches in the literature.

Of the wide variety of underlyingmechanisms proposed for creating <b>a</b> <b>lifelong</b> long agent, few have been applied to a complete system, and not enough is understood about how the mechanisms scale as an agent ages.
