500|$|The Fraternity Hymn {{was written}} by brother Scott Jeffrey Heckstall Jr. {{when he was a}} {{prospective}} member of the Eta Gamma chapter in 1977. Heckstall had wanted to be a charter member, but was not chosen. Heckstall was encouraged to rush, and he recalled that as part of his rush process, a couple of brothers took him to a piano and told him, [...] "We know that you play [...] in church. We need a fraternity hymn. We'll give you three hours, and you sit over there {{and come up with a}} hymn. We'll come back in three hours, and we expect a hymn." [...] Heckstall recalled the hymn Someday (Beams of Heaven <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>Go)</b> by Charles Albert Tindley and changed a few words—for example, [...] "Beams of Heaven <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> through this wilderness below" [...] became [...] "K K Psi, as we go through this wilderness here below." [...] The brothers of Eta Gamma were satisfied with Heckstall's hymn. Years later, the hymn was presented to the brotherhood assembled at the 1995 National Convention and accepted as the national fraternity hymn. Blue and white are the fraternity's official colors. The fraternity flower is a red carnation, so chosen because it was founder William Scroggs's favorite flower.|$|E
500|$|While vacationing at Richard Branson's estate at the Necker Island in 2011, Winslet met {{her third}} husband, Ned RocknRoll (born Edward Abel Smith; {{he is the}} nephew of Branson and works for Virgin Galactic), during a house fire. The couple married in New York in December 2012, and their son, Bear Blaze Winslet, was born the next year. After moving back to England, Winslet {{purchased}} a property worth £3.25 million by the sea at West Wittering, where as of 2015, she lives with RocknRoll and her children. Describing her life in a 2015 interview, she said, [...] "The countryside, particularly, is very good for my head. I love that I can go for a walk, pick blackberries and feed them to the baby <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> along." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the second}} verse, Beyoncé resigns herself and {{continues}} to sing about cruelties that men often inflict on women. Still imagining herself impersonating {{the man who has}} wronged her, she highlights how some men switch off their phones to avoid ex-lovers after having found another girl. Beyoncé continues, [...] "I'd put myself first / And make the rules <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> / 'Cause I know that she'd be faithful / Waitin' for me to come home". She then repeats the chorus; the intensity with which she sings gradually increases until she hits her upper register and seems close to crying. During the bridge, Beyoncé stops singing about the male behaviors she would indulge in if she were a man and addresses her callous lover directly. As Beyoncé emphasizes how it feels to be cheated on, she sings her vocal lines an octave higher than she did {{in the rest of the}} song. She finally tells him that it is too late to come back and apologize. In the last verse, Beyoncé concludes, [...] "But you're just a boy". Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music notes that she [...] " [...] her voice into a thin, pleading whine" [...] at this point. With a squeak in her voice, she repeats the chorus for the final time as she fights to remain strong, not allowing her agony to bring her down.|$|E

2500|$|Fang Xuanling {{had served}} Your Imperial Majesty {{for a long}} time. [...] He is careful, {{and all of his}} {{wonderful}} strategies and secret plans were not revealed to anyone. [...] Unless there is a particularly good reason, I hope that you will not abandon him. [...] As to my Zhangsun clan, many of them enjoy high salaries and high positions on account of our marriage, not because of their great virtues, and therefore they can crumble easily. [...] In order to preserve the Zhangsuns, I hope that you will not put them in powerful positions, and that they would be satisfied with seeing you at imperial gatherings the first and 15th day of each month. [...] During my lifetime, I made no contributions to the people, and I should not harm them in my death. [...] I hope that you will not build a tomb to cause the people to labor and the empire to waste resources. [...] Make a hill my tomb, and only use brick or wooden implements in the tomb. [...] I hope that Your Imperial Majesty will continue to be close to honest men and stay away from those lacking virtues; that you will accept faithful words and reject wicked flattery; that you will decrease labor and stop hunting. [...] Even <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> into the underworld, if these things happen, I will have no regrets. [...] It is not necessary to summon the sons and daughters back here; if I see them mourn and cry, I will only be saddened.|$|E
2500|$|When Cameron first {{appeared}} in the pilot episode, she behaved with more human mannerisms, but these faded in subsequent episodes. It has been confirmed by Friedman that this behavioral change {{was the result of a}} conscious decision; however the explanations he has given of the logistics behind this decision have varied. At the Television Critics Association press tour, he stated that within the story, Cameron had been prepared for the events of the pilot. Once the characters [...] "jumped forward in time though, she was as adrift as everyone else". In an interview with IGN, Friedman stated that as he wrote the second episode, he became interested in exploring the [...] "calmer, odder part of" [...] Cameron, reflected in a scene in the pilot in which Cameron asks questions of John [...] "in a very programmed way". He continued to say that Cameron's behavior may appear inconsistent to a viewer, but that this inconsistency may be operative in the completion of her tasks. In any case, the character's robotic interactions with humans were manipulated for humor, but Friedman did express a wish to avoid [...] "cheap jokes" [...] in favor of more seriously exploring Cameron's existence as a cyborg. Summer Glau in an interview said about Cameron's changing behavior: [...] "We were experimenting with Cameron quite a bit, and we wanted her to be able to seem human. We wanted especially John to be fooled by her, so that he would let her into his life. And so in the pilot, I do act very human. And then <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> through the series, it appears that I’ve taken steps back and that I am acting more like a Terminator would. We did that for several different reasons, but I know for me it's fun because I get to take more time for her development, her human development. I think that it also is funny and I think once her cover was blown with the Connors, she kind of was able to drop that persona and become who she really is around them, if that answers the question." ...|$|E
