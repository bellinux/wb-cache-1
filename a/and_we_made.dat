She revealed the video's completion, release and inspiration through a video description quote saying, [...] "heyy {{to all my}} fans! so me [...] my friends were bored and we were really channeling some 80's [...] (Tron, David Bowie in Labyrinth, and Revenge of the Nerds.) <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>made</b> this new video for take it off. it was really fun to make. i hope you guys like it". The video was directed by Skinny. This version of the video is known as [...] "Take it Off (K$ N' Friends Version)".|$|E
500|$|The {{recording}} engineer for the album, Brooks Arthur, [...] remembered the sessions in 2009: [...] "A cloud came along, {{and it was}} called the Van Morrison sessions. We all hopped upon that cloud, and the cloud took us away , <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>made</b> this album, and we landed when it was done." [...] In a Rolling Stone interview in 1972, Morrison told John Grissim, Jr.: [...] "I was really pretty happy with the album. [...] The only complaint I had was that it was rather rushed. [...] But I thought it was closer to the type of music I wanted to put out. [...] And still is, actually." ...|$|E

Sneak King is the game that Burger King had creative control over, and which was envisioned based on the King commercials. Oliver stated, [...] "Sneak King is derived by them, purely from their commercials. It was basically 'here's our commercials, {{we have to have}} a video game around them.' They threw in all their ideas, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>made</b> it work." [...] Originally, Sneak King was designed as a tile-based puzzle game, but it soon evolved into a Spy vs Spy caper with multiple Kings who are [...] "trying to out-deliver one another while laying traps for their enemies".|$|E

500|$|... "Wannabe" [...] was {{completed}} in thirty minutes—mainly because the group had written and composed parts of the song beforehand—in what Brown describes as a [...] "sudden creative frenzy." [...] During the session, Brown and Bunton {{came up with the}} idea of including a rap near the end of the song. At this point the group got very motivated, and incorporated the word [...] "zigazig-ha" [...] into the lyrics. Chisholm told Billboard magazine: [...] "You know when you're in a gang and you're having a laugh and you make up silly words? Well we were having a giggle <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>made</b> up this silly word, zigazig-ha. We were in the studio and it all came together in this song." ...|$|E
500|$|... gave {{us all a}} bit of paper, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>made</b> lists {{from one}} to 15. Eno said 'No. 2, we all play a G; No. 7 we all play a C sharp'; an so on. So it was like {{painting}} by numbers... used to love me and Percy; we'd go in and run through our dictionary licks and he'd record them and make a loop of them. Robert Fripp, who worked with Eno on (No Pussyfooting) and Here Come the Warm Jets, performed the solo on [...] "St. Elmo's Fire". Eno asked Fripp to improvise a lightning-fast guitar solo that would imitate an electrical charge between two poles on a Wimshurst high voltage generator. This {{was the basis for}} Eno crediting Fripp's solo on this track as [...] "Wimshurst Guitar".|$|E
500|$|Captain America's shield, {{which serves}} as both a {{defensive}} tool and a weapon, came in four types: metal, fiberglass, rubber, and computer graphics (CG). Prop master Barry Gibbs specified that [...] "We had the 'hero shield,' which was made of aluminum, for our beauty shots [...] close-up work. We then created a lighter shield that was aluminum-faced with a fiberglass back, for use on a daily basis.... And then we had a stunt shield made of polyurethane, {{which is sort of}} a synthetic rubber... <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>made</b> an ultrasoft one we put on [...] back, so that if there were an accident, it wouldn't hurt him." [...] Visual effects supervisor Christopher Townsend said Evans [...] "would practice swinging the practical shield so he knew the arc and the speed at which he should move. We would take the shield from him and shoot the scene with him miming it. Then we would add in a CG shield".|$|E

500|$|During the U.S. third leg, it was {{reported}} that Born to Run would be featured in its entirety during several shows, possibly in a scheme to boost ticket sales. [...] The full-album idea took fruition with the late September-early October set of five shows at Giants Stadium, which would be the final concerts ever in that venue in Springsteen's home state. [...] Born to Run was played at two shows, Darkness on the Edge of Town at one show, and Born in the U.S.A. at two shows. [...] Springsteen later said of the full album idea, [...] "We had done so many shows and were going to come back around one more time, so we were like, 'OK, what can we do that we haven't done? Let's try to play some of the albums.' There were some people who were starting to do it, it sounded like a good idea, and my audience fundamentally experienced all my music in album form. People took Born to Run home and played it start to finish 100 times; they didn't slip on a cut in the middle. <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>made</b> albums – we took a long time, and we built them to last. ... Those records are packed with songs that have lasted 30–35 years. It simply was a way to revitalize the show and do something appealing and fun for the fans, but it ended up being a much bigger emotional experience than I thought it would be." ...|$|E
500|$|O'Connell {{came up with}} [...] "Swing," [...] a {{song that}} Rubano said [...] "speaks to what {{the sound of the}} band is right now". [...] "Where My Mouth Is" [...] was the last song {{recorded}} for New Again. According to Lazzara, the lyrics were [...] "the most blatant that I've ever been in a song". The demo for the song was originally acoustic with an organ, mostly instrumental, and ran for 6–7 minutes. Fazzi praised the track, as did Rubano. The song subsequently went through various arrangement changes. The riff for [...] "Cut Me Up Jenny" [...] came from Lazzara: [...] "I was so bored and so lazy, I picked up the guitar and then the [...] That's where it came from <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>made</b> a song out of it." [...] Lazzara described it as [...] "a little choppy" [...] with [...] "a nice groove to it". Fazzi said the track has a [...] "crazy 80s vibe, it's a very different song for Taking Back Sunday", while Rubano said it contained hints of Phoenix and Bloc Party. When [...] "Catholic Knees" [...] existed as a rough idea, Fazzi suggested that the group change the time signature to 7/4. Lazzara cited it as an example of Fazzi's influence on the band: [...] "Cause none of us would have thought to [...]" [...] Reyes compared the track to Queens of the Stone Age and Foo Fighters.|$|E
500|$|Lennon {{later said}} he [...] "couldn't {{remember}} any of the words but it didn't matter—I just made them all up <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>made</b> a great wonderful noise." [...] Carl Perkins said to Lennon after the {{show that he was}} [...] "so beautiful you made me cry." [...] A bootleg album of the concert appeared, under the title JL-YO-EC, thanks to an audience recording, which was released {{a few months after the}} official album. After Lennon's death, the album, along with seven other Lennon albums, was reissued by EMI as part of a box set, which was released in the UK on 15 June 1981. The album was reissued in the US in 1982, on Capitol, and again in the same country on the same label, in 1986. The album was originally scheduled to appear on CD for the first time in June 1989, but the plan was scrapped. Ono, with the help of Rob Stevens from Quad Recording, supervised a remixing of Live Peace in Toronto 1969 for its compact disc issue, released on 1 May 1995. Two of the remixed tracks feature a variation in Ono's vocals: while [...] "Dizzy Miss Lizzy" [...] has additional backing vocals from Ono, [...] "Money" [...] has fewer backing vocals from Ono. The CD booklet included a 1995 calendar, mimicking the original release. The album is also available from the audiophile label Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab., utilizing the same remix. The booklet for the 2006 Mobile Fidelity release also included a current calendar.|$|E

500|$|... "Rock Show", {{the first}} season finale of Parks and Recreation was written by Norm Hiscock and {{directed}} by series co-founder Michael Schur. Schur said he felt [...] "Rock Show" [...] marked a change in tone for the series and struck a better balance between personal and professional stories {{than any of the}} other episodes from the season. Schur said: [...] "We treated that whole six-episode season like a pilot. If you go back and watch those episodes now, you can see us making changes. The sixth episode is different in tone than the first. <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>made</b> some character tweaks, like every show ever does". Amy Poehler said she believed [...] "Rock Show" [...] would end what she described as the inevitable comparisons between Parks and Recreation and The Office, which is also produced by Parks creators Schur and Greg Daniels. Poehler said, [...] "I think it was something we had to work through in the beginning, and I’m kind of hoping we’re on the other side of that and people will start to judge the show on its own, for what it is and realize it’s just a completely different world in a similar style.” Schur made his directorial debut with [...] "Rock Show", and had only one day of preparation before directing the episode. While preparing to direct the episode, Schur was asked to make an appearance on The Office as Mose Schrute, the cousin of Dwight Schrute and a popular minor character, in the fifth season finale episode, [...] "Company Picnic". Schur regretfully declined because he needed the time to work on [...] "Rock Show", leading Office episode writers Paul Lieberstein and Jennifer Celotta to create the character Rolf, Dwight's friend played by James Urbaniak, as an alternative.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, {{referring}} to her previous efforts at health care reform, she said, [...] "I learned some valuable lessons about the legislative process, the importance of bipartisan cooperation and the wisdom of taking small steps to get a big job done." [...] Again in 2007, she reflected on her role in 1993–1994: [...] "I think that both {{the process and the}} plan were flawed. We were trying to do something that was very hard to do, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>made</b> a lot of mistakes." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams {{added his}} voice to the condemnation, saying, [...] "There is no {{justification}} for what happened this afternoon in Dublin. Sinn Féin had appealed to people to ignore this loyalist parade {{and not to be}} provoked by it. Our view was that it should not be opposed in any way <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>made</b> that clear. Regrettably a small, unrepresentative group chose to ignore our appeal." [...] The President of Ireland, Mary McAleese, also condemned the rioters. Jeffrey Donaldson of the Democratic Unionist Party, who was in Dublin to address the Love Ulster march, said he was 'appalled' by the violence.|$|E

2500|$|In October 2001 in a PBS interview, former CIA Director James Woolsey {{claimed that}} Ramzi Yousef worked for Iraqi intelligence.

[...] However, Herman says that Yasin's presence in Baghdad does not mean Iraq sponsored the attack: [...] "We looked at that rather extensively. There were no ties to the Iraqi government." [...] CNN terrorism reporter Peter L.

Over the next few minutes, McCartney introduced some of the lyrics, reworking [...] "Get back to the place you should be" [...] from fellow Beatle George Harrison's [...] "Sour Milk Sea" [...] into [...] "Get back to where you once belonged". McCartney had played bass on Jackie Lomax's recording of [...] "Sour Milk Sea" [...] a few months earlier. On 9 January McCartney brought a more developed version of [...] "Get Back" [...] to the group, with the [...] "Sweet Loretta" [...] verse close to its finished version.

The long logs that it was our pride to cut and carry! The accuracy with which we laid them one upon another, hewn to the line and bulletproof. The Cyclopean doors that we hung, with sliding blots fit to be the 'mast of some great admiral!' And when we had 'made the pile complete' some marplot of the Regular Army came that way and chatted a few moments with our commander, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>made</b> an earthwork away off {{on one side of the}} road (leaving the other side to take care of itself) and camped outside it in tents! But the Regular Army fellow had not the heart to suggest the demolition of our Towers of Babel, and the foundations remain to this day." ...|$|E
2500|$|The cast of V {{features}} {{a number of}} actors from other science-fiction series, including Lost, Firefly and Smallville. Peters has stated that the casting of so many actors from a science-fiction background was coincidental, explaining: [...] "Obviously, we went for the best actors we could possibly find. It's a nice bonus {{that a lot of}} these folks have appeared in genre shows in the past, but it was not designed that way. We also wanted to make sure that as we moved forward, we honoured and respected the characters and the themes that the (original) show envisioned, while introducing brand new characters and brand new themes that make sense in a post-9/11 world." [...] Mitchell was a fan of the original series as a child, recalling: [...] "I liked the escape of it; I liked the entertainment of it. It was a fun night for me. I was allowed to watch an hour of television with my parents, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>made</b> a kind of celebration of it. I hope that other teenagers will do that with their parents with this show." [...] Mitchell's role in V sees her play an FBI agent with traits traditionally assigned to males. She commented: [...] "I like playing a traditional hero. I don't think I've ever done it before. Sigourney Weaver said she always chooses male roles because they are meatier." [...] Mitchell characterizes Erica as having [...] "a little bit of a hero complex", but [...] "her joy and her love and her true affection is with her son, and the fact that he is in imminent danger (makes it) fun to play." ...|$|E
