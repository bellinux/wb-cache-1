5|$|Before I {{had become}} {{familiar}} with my surroundings the President sent for me. In the interview that followed he told me what he wanted, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> failures and his disappointments had been, and proceeded to advise me as to what I should do to accomplish the purpose determined upon {{in the way of}} the new coinage. In this talk he suggested some details of action of a drastic character for my guidance, which he was positive were necessary to be adopted before success could be had. All this was delivered in his usual vigorous way, emphasizing many points by hammering on the desk with his fist.|$|E
5|$|Carbon is {{the sixth}} element, with a {{ground-state}} electron configuration of 1s22s22p2, {{of which the}} four outer electrons are valence electrons. Its first four ionisation energies, 1086.5, 2352.6, 4620.5 and 6222.7kJ/mol, are much {{higher than those of}} the heavier group 14 elements. The electronegativity of carbon is 2.5, significantly higher than the heavier group 14 elements (1.8–1.9), but close to most of the nearby nonmetals {{as well as some of}} the second- and third-row transition metals. Carbon's covalent radii are normally taken as 77.2pm (C–C), 66.7pm (C=C) and 60.3pm (C≡C), although these may vary depending on coordination number <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> carbon is bonded to. In general, covalent radius decreases with lower coordination number and higher bond order.|$|E
5|$|If it {{is unclear}} what counts as science, how the process of {{confirming}} theories works, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> purpose of science is, there is considerable scope for values and other social influences to shape science. Indeed, values can play a role ranging from determining which research gets funded to influencing which theories achieve scientific consensus. For example, in the 19th century, cultural values held by scientists about race shaped research on evolution, and values concerning social class influenced debates on phrenology (considered scientific at the time). Feminist philosophers of science, sociologists of science, and others explore how social values affect science.|$|E

5|$|Never 7 is {{a visual}} novel {{in which the}} player reads the story, and presses a button to advance through the text.

The game is presented from a first-person perspective, with pre-rendered backgrounds and 2D character portraits accompanying the text.

5|$|To Mahavira, {{the metaphysical}} {{nature of the}} {{universe}} consists of dravya, jiva, and ajiva. The jiva gets attached and bound to samsara (wordly realms of suffering and existence) because of karma (activity). Karma, in Jainism, includes both actions and intent, and it colors (lesya) the soul; its particles stick to the soul and affect how, where, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> soul is instantaneously reborn into after a being dies.|$|E
5|$|When one inhales or exhales, {{according}} to verses 4.47–65, the Nadis {{are loaded with}} vital airs. There are ten types of vital airs, corresponding to different stages of breathing, and they are named Prana, Apana, Samana, Udana, Vyana, Naga, Kurma, Krikara, Devadatta and Dhananjaya. These affect the Nadis in different ways, and how the body functions <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> balance of organs within the body is, depends on food one takes in and how well inhalation and exhalation are able to deliver the vital airs to various body parts.|$|E
5|$|Beauty {{in nature}} has {{historically}} been a prevalent theme in art and books, filling large sections of libraries and bookstores. That nature has been depicted and celebrated by so much art, photography, poetry, and other literature shows the strength with which many people associate nature and beauty. Reasons why this association exists, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> association consists of, are studied by the branch of philosophy called aesthetics. Beyond certain basic characteristics that many philosophers agree about to explain what is seen as beautiful, the opinions are virtually endless. Nature and wildness have been important subjects in various eras of world history. An early tradition of landscape art began in China during the Tang Dynasty (618–907). The tradition of representing nature as it is {{became one of the}} aims of Chinese painting and was a significant influence in Asian art.|$|E

5|$|Following a brief {{interlude}} by From Hell artist Eddie Campbell, the series' direction {{was taken}} over by Paul Jenkins in 1995. He had been former editor of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and other Mirage Studios lines. He had pitched to several comic houses, having tired of editing, and eventually managed to gain stewardship of Hellblazer, the first largely untested writer to achieve this. Jenkins' run is more traditionally English in its themes, with Albion, Arthurian legend, and old English battles all featuring, and even an appearance by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and a speculative explanation of the writing of Kubla Khan, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> interruption of the 'man from Porlock' may have been. He also returns to Jamie Delano's coverage of anarchist lifestyles, and the effects of the Criminal Justice Act of 1994, a controversial law which restricted the ability of the public to throw raves and large demonstrations.|$|E
5|$|For a {{time after}} the fourth night, Robert cannot find the Number Devil in his dreams; later, however, on the fifth night, Robert finds himself at a desert where the Number Devil teaches him about {{triangular}} numbers {{through the use of}} coconuts. On the sixth night, the Number Devil teaches Robert about the natural occurrence of Fibonacci numbers, which the Number Devil shortens to Bonacci numbers, by counting brown and white rabbits as they reproduce multiple times. By this dream, Robert's mother has noticed a visible change in Robert's mathematical interest, and Robert begins going to sleep earlier to encounter the Number Devil. The seventh night brings Robert to a bare, white room, where the Number Devil presents Pascal's triangle and the patterns that the triangular array displays. On the eighth night, Robert is brought to his classroom at school. The Number Devil arranges Robert's classmates in multiple ways, teaches him about permutations, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Number Devil calls vroom numbers (factorials).|$|E
5|$|Khánh had {{a meeting}} with Lodge in the morning of the coup for around an hour after {{arranging}} a meeting through Wilson. Due to concerns as to whether Washington would express support for the coup <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> official policy was, the meeting was not held at the embassy but at the home of Lodge's aide Dunn. However, if Lodge was concerned about keeping a low profile regarding the coup, Khánh was not, arriving at Dunn's residence with seven jeeploads of aides before embracing Lodge. He told Lodge that he would go after the communists aggressively and that the coup would not disrupt the military in any significant way. Khánh vowed to intensify the war effort, ask Lodge for guidance constantly, introduce democracy and install a direct phone line between Vietnamese military headquarters and the US Embassy. Lodge also reported that Khánh wanted {{to give the impression that}} he seriously thought that neutralist deal involving de Gaulle was a genuine and ominous prospect, and that de Gaulle had made much progress in influencing the previous administration.|$|E

5|$|The game {{takes place}} in the mansion of the fictional Edison family: Dr. Fred, a mad scientist; Nurse Edna, his wife; and their son Weird Ed. Living with the Edisons are two large, disembodied tentacles, one purple and the other green. The intro {{sequence}} shows that a sentient meteor crashed near the mansion twenty years earlier; it brainwashed the Edisons and directed Dr. Fred to obtain human brains for use in experiments. The game begins as Dave Miller prepares to enter the mansion to rescue his girlfriend, Sandy Pantz, who was kidnapped by Dr. Fred. With the exception of the green tentacle, the mansion's inhabitants are hostile, and will throw the player characters into the dungeon—or, in some situations, kill them—if they see them. When a character dies, the player must choose a replacement from the unselected characters; and the game ends if all characters are killed. Maniac Mansion has five possible endings, based on which characters are chosen, which survive, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> characters accomplish.|$|E
5|$|The {{scenario}} {{was based}} around {{the concept of}} five different races, and the interaction with a human character. The story premise of a human character becoming {{a member of one}} of the five playable races was born out of a compromise about who <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> player character should be. The concept of a non-human character was introduced by Horii as he saw an inherent contradiction in the idea of a human saving the other tribes. This raised some contention among the staff including Fujisawa due to the Dragon Quest series' established convention of a human as the main protagonist, but Fujisawa and Horii decided to have the player character be a human first and later become one of the five tribes. Part of the story's initial drama came from the player character growing accustomed to their new form. Once the basic scenario concept had been finalized, the team commissioned the various character designs from Toriyama. In contrast to the greater majority of MMORPGs, which did not seem to have a solid ending, the team wanted to create a definitive ending with a final boss as featured in normal RPGs.|$|E
5|$|This led to {{a series}} of {{increasingly}} sophisticated models to better predict the effectiveness of an ABM system <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> opposition would do to improve their performance against it. A key development was the Prim-Read theory, which provided an entirely mathematical solution to generating the ideal defensive layout. Using a Prim-Read layout for Nike-X, Air Force Brigadier General Glenn Kent began considering Soviet responses. His 1964 report produced a cost-exchange ratio that required $2 of defense for every $1 of offence if one wanted to limit US casualties to 30 percent of the population. The cost increased to 6-to-1 if the US wished to limit casualties to 10 percent. ABMs would only be cheaper than ICBMs if the US was willing to allow over half its population die in the exchange. When he realized he was using outdated exchange rates for the Soviet ruble, the exchange ratio for the 30 percent casualty rate jumped to 20-to-1.|$|E
