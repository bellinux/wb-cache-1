50|$|The <b>Agreed</b> <b>Minute</b> was {{a statute}} {{governing}} {{the nature of}} the U.S. military presence in Iceland. The <b>Agreed</b> <b>Minute</b> was last renegotiated in 2001. At the time, the U.S. Air Force committed itself to maintaining four to six interceptors at the Keflavík base, supported by a helicopter rescue squad. The Air Force, in order to cut costs, announced plans to remove the four remaining jets in 2003. The removal was then delayed to address Icelandic demands for continued presence of the jets. After an unfruitful series of negotiations and two reshuffles of the Icelandic government the issue lay dormant until early 2006 when the U.S. Air Force issued an official statement that withdrawal of the aircraft was already being prepared. U.S. officials have since then argued that Iceland is in no need of a military presence.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to examine}} the effectiveness of MoU Box 1974 in exercising the traditional fishing rights conferred on Indonesian traditional fishermen in which {{some of them are}} from East Nusa Tenggara. This research belongs to normative legal research-a library study centering on the norms of law. The data used in this research was secondary data. The research shows that MoU Box 1974 has acknowledged the fishing traditional rights conferred on the Indonesian traditional fishermen in the Austral Ocean. However, MoU Box 1974 becomes ineffective following the <b>Agreed</b> <b>Minutes</b> 1989 which apparently has restricted the division of fishing areas. After the <b>Agreed</b> <b>Minutes</b> 1989 was enacted as the elaboration of MoU Box 1974 many Indonesian traditional fishermen were arrested, prosecuted and imprisoned. This fact shows that MoU Box 1974 is unsuited for this period anymore. Hence, MoU Box 1974 needs to be reexamined...|$|R

However, its strategic geographic position in the Atlantic made it an invaluable member. Expansion of forces by Iceland was therefore concentrated primarily in the Icelandic Coast Guard, which saw action in a series of confrontations with British fishing vessels and Royal Navy warships known as the Cod Wars.|$|E

In 1990 the Japanese government expressed its intention to continue to rely on the treaty's arrangements to guarantee national security.|$|R
