500|$|... "The Little Drummer Boy", {{based on}} an ancient Czech folksong, was written by Katherine K. Davis in 1957. [...] The song tells the {{apocryphal}} story of a poor young boy who, unable to afford a gift for the infant Jesus, plays his drum with Mary's approval. The baby smiles at the boy in gratitude. The 1958 version by the Harry Simeone Chorale is the standard, and hit the unparalleled record of placing in the Top 40 for five straight Christmases in a row. Simeone recorded the song in a Greenwich Village cathedral to give it <b>a</b> <b>hushed</b> respect. Its highest position on both the US and UK charts was #13.|$|E
500|$|The song, {{which is}} written in the key of E-flat major, {{features}} an organ and piano sound. The song starts with <b>a</b> <b>hushed</b> electric organ ballad, including Martin's falsetto. The song then builds with acoustic guitar and piano, along with a string section during the beginning choruses. The sound then shifts with a plaintive three-note guitar line, ringing through a rhythmic upbeat drum tempo. [...] The song then transitions to its bridge, which roars into an instrumentation of piano notes, electric & bass guitar riffs, drums, and a singalong chorus with an anthemic feel. A synthesizer then joins the instrumentation, {{during the second half}} of the bridge. The song finally ends with the beginning chorus, with slow, melancholic piano notes being played in the background.|$|E

500|$|... "I Was Here" [...] {{begins with}} quivering reverb and a plaintively plucked guitar setting a somber mood for about fifteen {{seconds before the}} beats begin {{alongside}} Beyoncé's voice. Her vocals set <b>a</b> <b>hushed</b> and morbid tone on the song as she bring doses of edge and grit, singing: [...] "I wanna leave my footprints on the sands of time / Know {{there was something that}} meant something that I left behind / When I leave this world, I'll leave no regrets / I'll leave something to remember, So they won't forget". She further sings throughout the song, [...] "The hearts I have touched will be the proof that I leaved that I made a difference". Watery synths shimmer in the background before Beyoncé adopts an authoritative tone to chant the chorus lines: [...] "I was here / I lived, I loved / I was here / I did, I've done / Everything that I wanted / And it was more than I thought it would be / I will leave my mark so everyone will know / I was here".|$|E
500|$|... "Fix You" [...] {{features}} an organ and piano sound. The song starts with <b>a</b> <b>hushed</b> electric organ ballad, including Martin's falsetto. The song then builds with both an acoustic guitar and piano sound. The sound then shifts with a plaintive three-note guitar line, ringing through a bringing rhythm upbeat tempo. Its instrumentation is varied {{with the sound}} of church-style organs hovering throughout the background, piano notes, acoustic and electric guitar riffs, drums, bass guitar, and a singalong chorus. [...] "The Hardest Part" [...] features a faster piano ballad sound, and starts with a repeating two-note piano riff, and {{features an}} instrumentation of a singsong guitar. It also includes a slow tempo with a drumming rhythm. The track ends with the band playing the repeated instrument riffs. [...] "Speed of Sound" [...] is a track musically based on the piano. The song benefits from an insistently ornate keyboard riff and a busy but less-hummable chorus, in which the song builds into a huge drum beat and a synthesizer-heavy chorus. The song also includes an upbeat tempo, with a driving bass line and distorted guitar riffs being heard throughout the song.|$|E

500|$|Lerew {{was posted}} to RAAF Overseas Headquarters, London, in December 1943. He {{travelled}} via the United States, meeting film stars Bing Crosby, Bob Hope, and Dorothy Lamour {{on the set}} of Road to Utopia at Los Angeles in February 1944. In London, he undertook study of RAF and USAAF methods of operations, as well as diplomatic duties. Of the invasion of France on 6June 1944, he wrote: [...] "There has been no rejoicing. <b>A</b> <b>hushed</b> quietness has descended over London and all of England. Most people have relatives in it, and there is only one wish: that is, that it will end quickly. It is depressing to be playing no part in it." [...] Later in the year, Lerew was invested with his Distinguished Flying Cross by King GeorgeVI at Buckingham Palace. He returned to Australia in early 1945, and married Laurie Steele, the Australian-born widow of a Royal Air Force night-fighter pilot, having met her when he was stationed in England. The couple had two daughters, but eventually divorced. In March, Lerew took part in the investigation into the crash of a Hudson carrying Major General George Vasey; he determined that the pilot's lack of experience in instrument flying had been a factor, and recommended further such training for RAAF flight crew. Promoted group captain, he formed the Directorate of Flying Safety in June 1945 and served as its inaugural Director. Believing that the promotion of flying safety in the RAAF cut across both administrative and operational spheres, and aware of the notorious feud between the service's two senior officers, Air Vice Marshals George Jones and Bill Bostock, Lerew had proposed that the new directorate be placed squarely under the auspices of Jones as Chief of the Air Staff, with authority to demand free access to information from all other directorates.|$|E
500|$|... "Kicking and Screaming" [...] is {{the most}} {{prominent}} representation of rock music on The Time of Our Lives. The track features instrumentation that relies on glam electric guitar riffing and ragged, gutsy vocals, which, at several points, feature a gravelly element. It results in an uptempo electronic rock number. Lyrically, [...] "Kicking and Screaming" [...] is a merciless message to an ex-boyfriend. [...] "Party in the U.S.A." [...] mixes R and pop music elements while having instrumentation that includes a [...] "clash between feathery jazz guitar chords and a booming synth bassline serving as a hook". Cyrus' vocals display an undertone of alternative country twang and features belter refrains. The lyrics for [...] "Party in the U.S.A." [...] discuss Cyrus' relocation from Nashville, Tennessee to Hollywood, California. The refrains mainly speak of how her favorite songs make her feel more confident. [...] "When I Look at You" [...] is a power ballad that transitions in instrumentation, from piano to electric guitar. Throughout the song, Cyrus keeps <b>a</b> <b>hushed</b> tone, but starts to belt soon {{before the arrival of}} the second verse. Lyrically, it speaks of a dream lover. [...] "The Time of Our Lives" [...] is a bouncy, dance-pop song characterized by 1980s synths and a fizzy sound caused by a bubblegum pop background. Cyrus' processed vocals display a prominent use of auto-tune; influences derive from new wave music. The song's lyrics talk about not worrying so much about the future and simply focusing on the present and having a good time together. [...] "Talk Is Cheap" [...] is a pop-punk, garage rock song with disco influences and a number of hooks. [...] "Talk Is Cheap" [...] features lyrics that speak of being extremely irritated after encountering predicaments at a club and others smoking cigarettes. [...] "Obsessed" [...] is a power ballad with soft rock characteristics and husky vocals. [...] "Obsessed"'s lyrics deal with teenage lust. [...] "Before the Storm" [...] is a country pop ballad about a melancholic romantic breakup.|$|E

Thus far in the trial, Ruby Bates had been notably absent. She had disappeared from her home in Huntsville weeks before the new trial, and every sheriff in Alabama had been ordered to search for her, to no avail. Now, two guardsmen with bayonets opened the courtroom doors, and Bates entered, [...] "in stylish clothes, eyes downcast." ...|$|E

2500|$|The success hasn't {{made life}} in the theatre any easier for Vertinskaya. She remembered how in Sovremennik (after Ophelia made her known internationally) she was shifted back to the mass scenes. Yevgeny Yevstigneev complained bitterly because the moment he (as the King in The Naked King) stepped on stage the {{audience}} responded in <b>a</b> <b>hushed</b> collective whisper: [...] "Look over there, it's Vertinskaya in the crowd!" [...] Occasionally, Vertinskaya remembered, she had to artificially [...] "simplify" [...] her facial features (even to stuff her nostrils) so as to fit the Soviet [...] "common heroine" [...] stereotype. [...] "In those times, they demanded {{a different kind of}} heroine: ruddy-faced cheerful 'activistkas'", – the actress responded when asked about huge gaps in her working schedule in the early 1970s.|$|E
2500|$|Gravelings are mischievous gremlin-like {{creatures that}} cause the {{accidents}} and mishaps (in the form of Rube Goldberg machine scenarios) that kill people.

Reapers can see and interact with them to some extent: Daisy once shushed a graveling; Rube yelled [...] "Get outta here!" [...] once when seeing gravelings desecrating a cemetery statue; and George once chased several angry gravelings around her apartment. Although gravelings seem to be self-aware and recognize the reapers, they do not communicate verbally with them, and {{talk to each other}} in <b>a</b> <b>hushed</b> and unintelligible babble; other times they growl or hiss.|$|E
2500|$|Attaching a small metal, rubber, leather, or wooden {{device called}} a mute, or sordino, {{to the bridge}} of the violin gives a softer, more mellow tone, with fewer audible overtones; the sound of an entire orchestral string section playing with mutes has <b>a</b> <b>hushed</b> quality. The {{conventional}} Italian markings for mute usage are con sord., or con sordina, meaning 'with mute'; and senza sord., meaning 'without mute'; or via sord., meaning 'mute off'. Larger metal, rubber, or wooden mutes are widely available, known as practice mutes or hotel mutes. [...] Such mutes are generally not used in performance, but are used to deaden the sound of the violin in practice areas such as hotel rooms. (For practicing purposes there is also the mute violin, a violin without a sound box.) Some composers have used practice mutes for special effect, for example, at the end of Luciano Berio's Sequenza VIII for solo violin.|$|E
