William Lawrence Bragg proposed a model in which the incoming X-rays are scattered specularly (mirror-like) from each plane; from that assumption, X-rays scattered from adjacent planes will combine constructively (constructive interference) when the angle θ between the plane and the X-ray results in a path-length difference that is an integer multiple n of the X-ray wavelength λ.|$|E

The proposed algorithm also supports (partial) dense matching, that alleviates the symmetric flip problem due to initial coarse sampling. We test the performance of our matching algorithm on several shape datasets in comparison to state of the art. Our method proves useful, not only for partial matching, but also for complete matching of semantically similar hybrid shape pairs whose maximum geodesic distances may not be compatible, a case that would fail most of the conventional isometric shape matchers...|$|R

25|$|Given {{any such}} {{interpretation}} {{of a set of}} points as complex numbers, the points constructible using valid compass and straightedge constructions alone are precisely the elements of the smallest field containing the original set of points and closed under the complex conjugate and square root operations (to avoid ambiguity, we can specify the square root with complex argument less than π). The elements of this field are precisely those that may be expressed as a formula in the original points using only the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, complex conjugate, and square root, which is easily seen to be a countable dense subset of the plane. Each of these six operations corresponding to a simple compass and straightedge construction.

The compactness theorem first appeared as a lemma in Gödel's proof of the completeness theorem, and it took many years before logicians grasped its significance and began to apply it routinely. It says that a set of sentences has a model if and only if every finite subset has a model, or in other words that an inconsistent set of formulas must have a finite inconsistent subset. The completeness and compactness theorems allow for sophisticated analysis of logical consequence in first-order logic and the development of model theory, and they are a key reason for the prominence of first-order logic in mathematics.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{problem of}} ranking, {{in which the}} goal is to learn a real-valued ranking {{function}} that induces a ranking or ordering over an instance space, has recently gained attention in machine learning. We study generalization properties of ranking algorithms, in <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> the ranking problem known as the bipartite ranking problem, using the notion of algorithmic stability. In particular, we derive generalization bounds for bipartite ranking algorithms that have good stability properties. We show that kernel-based ranking algorithms that perform regularization in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space have such stability properties, and therefore our bounds can be applied to these algorithms; this is in contrast with previous generalization bounds for ranking, which are based on uniform convergence and in many cases cannot be applied to these algorithms. A comparison of the bounds we obtain with corresponding bounds for classification algorithms yields some interesting insights into the difference in generalization behaviour between ranking and classification. ...|$|R
40|$|The wake of {{wide body}} {{aircraft}} is a hazard to following aircraft in approach, climb, and cruise. Thus, {{a large amount of}} experimental research effort has been devoted to instability and breakdown of vortices. However, investigations of the instabilities of vortices in the wake far field very often are lacking the link to the near field and are inconclusive as to the aerodynamic, whereas investigations of the wake in a wind tunnel very often miss the link to the mid- and far field at a sufficiently high Reynolds-number. For this reason, the wake of an Airbus A- 300 with different flap settings was investigated in a joint ONERA/DLR-project in the catapult of ONERA Lille. The Particle Image Velocimetry was chosen as a non-intrusive testing technique. In <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> the landing flaps, a premature breakdown of the vortex cores was observed.
