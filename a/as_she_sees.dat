2500|$|Pakistani lawyer Sundas Hoorain {{has said}} that women in pre-Islamic Arabia had a much higher {{standing}} than they got with Islam. [...] She describes a free sex society in which {{both men and women}} could have multiple partners or could contract a monogamous relationship per their will. [...] She thus concludes that the Muslim idea of monogamy being a post-Islamic idea is flawed and biased and that women had the right to contract such a marriage before Islam. [...] She also describes a society in which succession was matrilineal and children were retained by the mother and lived with the mother's tribe, whereas in Shariah law, young children stay with their mother until they reach the age of puberty, and older children stay with their father. [...] Hoorain also cites problems with the idea of mass female infanticide and simultaneous widespread polygamy (multiple women for one man), <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>sees</b> it as an illogical paradox. [...] She questions how it was possible for men to have numerous women if so many females were being killed as infants.|$|E
2500|$|Julia Fish (born 1950) is an American {{artist whose}} {{paintings}} have a deceptive simplicity. She paints in oil on stretched rectangular canvases of varying size. By means of close observation of everyday subjectsleaves {{of a tree}} seen through a window, a section of floor tiles, an old fashioned light fixture she makes, as one critic says, [...] "quiet, abstract manifestations of observed realities." [...] She is a studio artist who paints not what she sees in an instant but rather what she observes continuously, day after day. The result, she says, {{is not so much}} temporal as durational. [...] Her paintings compress many instances of observation so as to become, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>sees</b> it, [...] "a parallel system to a lived experience." [...] The paintings lack spacial orientation and, as a critic says, can [...] "be described as both highly realistic and abstract without compromising either term." [...] In 2008, Alan G. Artner, writing in the Chicago Tribune, said [...] "This is work of small refinements and adjustments. The world of everyday things generates it, but Fish's qualities of seeing and touch elevate the things to a plane on which they leave behind their humble character." ...|$|E
2500|$|Louise {{is now a}} young woman, and Rose {{has built}} a pale {{imitation}} of the Dainty June act for her. Using all girls, Rose and Herbie try valiantly to sell [...] "Madame Rose's Toreadorables" [...] to a fading vaudeville industry. However, they are still together ("Together, Wherever We Go"). With no vaudeville venues left, Louise and her second-rate act wind up accidentally booked at a burlesque house in Wichita, Kansas, {{as a means to}} deter police raids. Rose is anguished, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>sees</b> what a booking in burlesque means to her dreams of success, but Louise persuades her that two weeks' pay for the new act is better than unemployment. As they are introduced to Louise, three of the strippers on the bill advise her on {{what it takes to be}} a successful stripper, a [...] "gimmick," [...] something that [...] "makes your strip special" [...] ("You Gotta Get a Gimmick"). Backstage, Rose proposes marriage to Herbie. He asks her to break up the act and let Louise have a normal life, and she reluctantly accepts, agreeing to marry the day after their show closes. On the last day of the booking, the star stripper in the burlesque show is arrested for solicitation. Desperate, Rose cannot resist the urge to give Louise another nudge toward stardom, and she volunteers Louise to do the strip tease as a last-minute replacement. Disgusted at Rose's blind ambition for her daughter, Herbie walks out on Rose forever ("Small World (Reprise)"). Although reluctant, Louise wants to please her mother and she goes on, assured by Rose that she needn't actually strip, but simply walk elegantly and tease by dropping a single shoulder strap. Shy and hesitant, she sings a titillating version of the old kiddie act song, [...] "May We Entertain You?". She removes only her glove, but she speaks directly to her 'audience', which becomes her [...] "gimmick" [...] ("Let Me Entertain You (Gypsy Strip Tease)").|$|E
