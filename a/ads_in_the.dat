In the mid-1980s he modeled Munsingwear briefs {{in a series of}} magazine and billboard <b>ads.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> mid-1970s Jack did television commercials and print-ads for In-N-Out Burger, a California-based fast food chain.|$|E
5|$|Modern Shift: In today’s society, we are {{beginning}} to see a shift in gender representation in the media particularly in the male fashion industry. Fashion designers are now starting to blur the lines between masculinity and femininity. In the first advertisement, the male has a very soft delicate hold on the rose compared to the typical aggressive grip men exhibit in <b>ads.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> other two examples, both men are not only portraying the idea of feminine touch but the concept of self-touch as well.|$|E

5|$|In May 2015, a New York Times exposé by Sarah Maslin Nir on {{the working}} {{conditions}} of manicurists in New York City and elsewhere {{and the health}} hazards {{to which they are}} exposed attracted wide attention, resulting in emergency workplace enforcement actions by New York governor Andrew M. Cuomo. In July 2015, the story's claims of widespread illegally low wages were challenged by former New York Times reporter Richard Bernstein, in the New York Review of Books. Bernstein, whose wife owns two nail salons, asserted that such illegally low wages were inconsistent with his personal experience, and were not evidenced by <b>ads</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Chinese-language papers cited by the story. The New York Times editorial staff subsequently answered Bernstein's criticisms with examples of several published ads and stating that his response was industry advocacy. The independent NYT Public Editor also reported that she had previously corresponded with Bernstein and looked into his complaints, and expressed her belief that the story's reporting was sound.|$|E
5|$|To {{compete in}} this market, Roberts needed more capital. He took MITS public in November 1973 with a stock {{offering}} of 500,000 shares at $1 each. The 1973 oil crisis caused {{a stock market}} downturn and MITS was only able to sell 250,000 shares. This allowed MITS {{to pay off the}} existing debt, but did not allow for any expansion. Roberts had developed several test equipment products such as a Waveform Generator and a Digital Voltmeter so he attempted to appeal to kit builders again by featuring the test equipment and digital clocks in the advertisements, instead of calculators. MITS was losing money, and by July 1974, the full page prominent ads were replaced with quarter-page <b>ads</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> back of the magazine.|$|E

25|$|The {{development}} in atmospheric pressure suits stagnated in the 1940s through 1960s, as efforts were concentrated on solving {{the problems of}} deep diving by dealing with the physiological problems of ambient pressure diving instead of avoiding them by isolating the diver from the pressure.

25|$|During {{the summer}} of 1993 the AFA {{purchased}} full-page <b>ads</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> New York Times, USA Today, and Los Angeles Times denouncing the sexual and violent content of the upcoming ABC police drama NYPD Blue.

25|$|During the 2002 {{election}} campaign, Davis {{took the}} unusual step of taking out campaign ads during the Republican primaries against Los Angeles mayor Richard Riordan. Davis claimed that Riordan had attacked his record {{and that his}} campaign was defending his record. Polls showed that, as a moderate, Riordan would be a more formidable challenger in the general election than a conservative candidate. Polls even showed that Riordan would defeat Davis. Davis attacked Riordian with negative <b>ads</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> primary. The ads questioned Riordan's pro-choice stance by questioning Riordan's support of pro-life politicians and judges. The ads pointed out Riordan's position of wanting a moratorium on the death penalty as being to the left of Gray Davis, who strongly supported it.|$|E
25|$|In January 1877, Jones was {{contacted}} by Henry G. Romaine requesting that he {{act as an}} intermediary {{between himself and the}} Stewart estate. Romaine had been involved in stealing the body of Alexander T. Stewart three months earlier and was demanding a ransom from his widow Cornelia. In several signed letters to Jones, Romaine offered the return of Stewart's body for $250,000 and was instructed to contact him through personal <b>ads</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> New York Herald. He also received a small packet, express delivered from Canada, which included the knobs and two of the silver handles from Stewart's casket as well as a small strip of velvet and triangular piece of paper. Jones immediately reported the incident to the NYPD Chief of Police George W. Walling and, after a meeting with Walling and Henry Hilton, Jones agreed to proceed in the negotiations.|$|E

25|$|The new {{department}} of Beckman Instruments took the name Shockley Semi-Conductor Laboratories (the hyphen was conventional in those years). During 1955 Beckman and Shockley signed the deal, bought licenses on all necessary patents for $25,000, and selected the location in Mountain View, near Palo Alto, California. The place did not prove very successful: Shockley's colleagues at Bell Labs and RCA refused {{to move to}} a rural location with no long-distance phone service. The vast majority of semiconductor-related companies and professionals were based on the East Coast, so Shockley posted <b>ads</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> New York Times and the New York Herald Tribune. Early respondents included Sheldon Roberts of Dow Chemical, Robert Noyce of Philco and Jay Last, a former intern of Beckman Instruments. The newspaper campaign brought some three hundred responses, and fifteen people, including Gordon Moore and David Allison, Shockley himself recruited {{at a meeting of the}} American Physical Society.|$|E
25|$|The {{defendants}} {{also argued}} that Steinberg was estopped from defending his copyright {{on the grounds that}} he had taken no action over a period of eight years to stop others from counterfeiting his posters and adapting his idea to other locations, and had not acted in response to newspaper ads promoting the movie. The court rejected this argument, holding that the defendants had not proved any of the elements of estoppel: (1) a representation in fact; (2) reasonable reliance thereon; and (3) injury or damage resulting from denial by the party making the representation. While the defendants argued that Steinberg had made a representation of his acquiescence to their use of his image in the movie poster by not complaining about the <b>ads</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> newspaper, the judge rejected this line of reasoning and noted that the defendants had continued to use the infringing advertisements even after becoming aware of Steinberg's objections. Further, there was no existing relationship between the parties that could give rise to estoppel.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, Putnam County's lakes {{had become one}} of many places where city {{residents}} went on hot summer weekends. Brothers Warren and Arthur Smadbeck were developers who decided to create more. They bought failing farms in the area in 1928 and built the dam to create the lake. Around it they built small bungalows and cottages meant to be weekend or summer homes for middle-income families, selling them in lavish <b>ads</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> New York Daily Mirror.
