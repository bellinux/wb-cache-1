25|$|Using this terminology, <b>a</b> <b>latch</b> is level-sensitive, {{whereas a}} {{flip-flop}} is edge-sensitive. That is, when <b>a</b> <b>latch</b> is enabled it becomes transparent, while a flip flop's output only changes {{on a single}} type (positive going or negative going) of clock edge.|$|E
25|$|The mandibles of O. bauri {{are kept}} in place with <b>a</b> <b>latch</b> called the clypeus. Once the latch is {{released}}, all of the energy stored is quickly released and the mandibles close, very similar to a crossbow when fired.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>latch</b> or a {{flip-flop}} is {{a circuit}} that has two stable states {{and can be}} used to store state information. They typically constructed using feedback that crosses over between two arms of the circuit, to provide the circuit with a state. The circuit can be made to change state by signals applied to one or more control inputs and will have one or two outputs. It is the basic storage element in sequential logic. Latches and flip-flops are fundamental building blocks of digital electronics systems used in computers, communications, and many other types of systems.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>latching</b> switch is <b>a</b> {{switch that}} {{maintains}} its state after being activated. A push-to-make, push-to-break switch would therefore be <b>a</b> <b>latching</b> switch - {{each time you}} actuate it, whichever state the switch is left in will persist until the switch is actuated again.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> slam <b>latch</b> uses <b>a</b> {{spring and}} is {{activated}} by the shutting or slamming of a door. Like all <b>latches,</b> <b>a</b> slam <b>latch</b> is <b>a</b> mechanism {{to hold a}} door closed. The slam latch derives its name from its ability to slam doors and drawers shut without damaging the <b>latch.</b> <b>A</b> slam <b>latch</b> is rugged and ideal for industrial, agricultural and construction applications.|$|R
30|$|In this paper, we {{divide the}} SR latch into two types. One is <b>a</b> random <b>latch,</b> {{and the other}} is <b>a</b> {{constant}} <b>latch.</b> We defined <b>a</b> “random latch” as <b>an</b> SR <b>latch</b> whose output sequence includes at least one transition between 0 and 1 and defined a “constant latch” as <b>an</b> SR <b>latch</b> that generates only 0 ’s or only 1 ’s.|$|R
25|$|The {{original}} plan for Pohick Church was {{drawn up by}} James Wren, and was identical to that used for both The Falls Church and Christ Church in Alexandria, Virginia; however, {{at some point during}} the construction process the footprint of the church was altered to that seen today. Some sources have claimed that George Washington himself drew up the design for the building, and at least one hints that George Mason, too, might have provided input; however, records show that in March 1769 the vestry paid James Wren and William West for the church plans. Construction was initially overseen by the planter Daniel French of Rose Hill, a member of the congregation. He died before completion of the building works, and oversight passed to William Buckland, who was also involved in the building of Gunston Hall nearby, and who may have participated in the decoration of the church interior as well; it is possible that Buckland took over the work at the instigation of his employer, George Mason, who had assumed many of French's debts and obligations at the latter's death. Much of the original woodwork in the building was executed by master carver William Bernard Sears, a longtime associate of Buckland's who was also attached to Gunston Hall, likely in indenture to Mason, and is known to have worked at Mount Vernon as well. The account presented by him for his services survives, and indicates that he was paid £58:19:0 for his craft. Plans for the church complex also called for the installation of mounting blocks and six benches in the churchyard, so that people could sit under the trees, and for the area to be cleared of all rubbish and litter. Washington's records indicate that he took an interest in furnishing the new church; besides paying William Copan for carving ciphers on both his pew and that of his neighbor Fairfax, he fitted his own pew with drawers, and also paid for <b>a</b> <b>latch</b> and a door for the church building.|$|E
2500|$|Magnetic circuit {{breakers}} use a solenoid (electromagnet) whose pulling force increases with the current. Certain designs utilize electromagnetic forces {{in addition to}} those of the solenoid. The circuit breaker contacts are held closed by <b>a</b> <b>latch.</b> As the current in the solenoid increases beyond the rating of the circuit breaker, the solenoid's pull releases the latch, which lets the contacts open by spring action.|$|E
2500|$|The torpedo tubes on British and Australian {{submarines}} were afterwards {{equipped with}} a [...] "Thetis clip", one of the modifications introduced {{as a result of}} the accident. This is <b>a</b> <b>latch</b> which allows a torpedo tube door to be opened no more than a small amount in case it is open to the sea at the bow end. Once it is clear that no flooding will occur the latch can be released and the door fully opened.|$|E

5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>latching</b> relay (also called [...] "impulse", [...] "keep", or [...] "stay" [...] relays) {{maintains}} either contact position indefinitely {{without power}} {{applied to the}} coil. The advantage is that one coil consumes power only for an instant while the relay is being switched, and the relay contacts retain this setting across a power outage. <b>A</b> <b>latching</b> relay allows remote control of building lighting without the hum that may be produced from a continuously (AC) energized coil.|$|R
2500|$|Each {{negative}} logic selector bail that is {{displaced by the}} interposer in turn pulls <b>a</b> <b>latch</b> interposer and link which causes a selector latch near the cycle shaft to be {{pulled away from the}} latch bail. The latches pulled away in this manner are disengaged {{for the rest of the}} cycle, while the remaining latches take part in character selection, hence the term [...] "{{negative logic}}". The minus five selector bail pulls an interposer and link which causes <b>a</b> <b>latch</b> to disengage from a cam, allowing it to move an additional input into the whiffletree that subtracts five units of rotation from any negative logic inputs. An additional [...] "low velocity" [...] selector latch is also engaged by certain keys, such as '.' and '_', which require a reduced striking force so as not to cut the paper; this selector latch engages the low velocity control cam follower, which pulls the low velocity cable connected to the cam in the carrier, causing the low velocity lobe to be used instead of the usual high velocity lobe. Additionally, punctuation marks are deliberately placed about the ball so the maximum amount of energy is used to position the element prior to striking, further reducing the impact.|$|E
2500|$|King Richard {{was distracted}} {{by a growing}} {{conflict}} with the Lords Appellant from this time on. Glyndŵr's opportunities were further limited {{by the death of}} Sir Gregory Sais in 1390 and the sidelining of Richard Fitzalan, Earl of Arundel, and he probably returned to his stable Welsh estates, living there quietly for ten years during his forties. The bard Iolo Goch ("Red Iolo"), himself a Welsh lord, visited him in the 1390s and wrote a number of odes to Owain, praising Owain's liberality, and writing of Sycharth, [...] "Rare was it there / to see <b>a</b> <b>latch</b> or a lock." ...|$|E

50|$|In {{cases where}} the {{parallel}} outputs should not change during the serial loading process, it is desirable to use <b>a</b> <b>latched</b> or buffered output. In <b>a</b> <b>latched</b> shift register (such as the 74595) the serial data is first loaded into an internal buffer register, then upon receipt of a load signal {{the state of the}} buffer register is copied into a set of output registers. In general, the practical application of the serial-in/parallel-out shift register is to convert data from serial format on a single wire to parallel format on multiple wires.|$|R
