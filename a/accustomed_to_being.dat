Magpies will become <b>accustomed</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> fed by humans, and although they are wild, {{will return to the}} same place looking for handouts. The idea is that humans thereby appear less of a threat to the nesting birds. Although this has not been studied systematically, there are reports of its success.|$|E
5|$|Hayes {{took office}} {{determined}} {{to reform the}} system of civil service appointments, which had been based on the spoils system since Andrew Jackson was president. Instead of giving federal jobs to political supporters, Hayes wished to award them by merit according to an examination that all applicants would take. Immediately, Hayes's call for reform brought him into conflict with the Stalwart, or pro-spoils, branch of the Republican party. Senators of both parties were <b>accustomed</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> consulted about political appointments and turned against Hayes. Foremost among his enemies was New York Senator Roscoe Conkling, who fought Hayes's reform efforts at every turn.|$|E
5|$|The {{events in}} Arkham Origins take place {{about five years}} before , in midwinter Gotham City. Batman, an {{experienced}} crime-fighter {{in the second year}} of his career, is not yet the veteran superhero of Arkham Asylum and Arkham City. He is a mysterious force; even the police do not know whether he is a vigilante, a myth or a supernatural being. Batman has fought ordinary criminals and gangsters, and is <b>accustomed</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> stronger and faster than his opponents. However, on a snowy Christmas Eve he is confronted with more-dangerous foes: eight professional assassins hoping to collect a $50-million bounty placed on Batman's head by Black Mask. Villains (including the Joker) take advantage of the assassins' arrival to launch their own schemes, and Black Mask's henchmen instigate a rise in crime and gang activity in the city.|$|E

25|$|After ending Reconstruction, Hayes {{turned to}} the issue of {{reforming}} the system of civil service appointments.

25|$|The 19th {{century was}} also a new era for Europe. Church power was declining, and friars began coming to the Philippines, ending hopes that the friars would {{relinquish}} their posts. With {{the opening of the}} Suez Canal, the voyage between Spain and the Philippines was made shorter. More peninsulares (Spaniards born in Spain) began pouring into the colony and started to occupy the various government positions traditionally held by the criollos (Spaniards born in the Philippines). In the 300 years of colonial rule, the criollos had been <b>accustomed</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> semi-autonomous with the governor-general, who was the only Spaniard (peninsulares) government official. The criollos demanded representation in the Spanish Cortes where they could express their grievances. This, together with the secularization issues, gave rise to the Criollo Insurgencies.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{throwing}} {{with his}} left hand as well as batting from the left, Sabathia is right-handed. Sabathia has six pitches: a cutter (89–92 MPH), a more used two-seam/sinker fastball (88–93 MPH), a Four seam fastball (89-94 mph), a curve ball (74-76 MPH), a slider (78–82 MPH), and changeup (82–84 MPH). Once ahead in the count, he primarily uses his changeup to strike out right-handed batters, and his slider to strike out left-handers. He also exhibits good command of his pitches, posting a 5.65 K/BB ratio in 2007. Throughout most of his career, Sabathia's four-seam fastball sat in the 92-96 mph range (topping out at 98 mph) and his sinking fastball averaged 89-93 mph (topping out at 96 mph), thus making him a power pitcher. Since 2013, Sabathia has become <b>accustomed</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> a control pitcher, in the 2017 he cut down his usage of the four-seamer (87-91 mph topping out at 93 mph) and favored the sinker and cutter.|$|E

According to one story, Tatiana, <b>accustomed</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> addressed only by her name and patronymic, was so disconcerted when she was addressed as [...] "Your Imperial Highness" [...] by lady-in-waiting Baroness Sophie Buxhoeveden when she was heading a committee meeting that she kicked the woman under the table and hissed [...] "Are you crazy to speak to me like that?" ...|$|E

25|$|These {{individuals}} {{may be trying}} to reenact unresolved issues with their parents. A history of frequent illnesses may also {{contribute to the development of}} this disorder. In some cases, individuals afflicted with FD are <b>accustomed</b> <b>to</b> actually <b>being</b> sick, and thus return to their previous state to recapture what they once considered the 'norm.' Another cause is a history of close contact with someone (a friend or family member) who had a severe or chronic condition. The patients found themselves subconsciously envious of the attention said relation received, and felt that they themselves faded into the background. Thus medical attention makes them feel glamorous and special.|$|R
500|$|In many of Shinkai's films, sad endings {{resulting}} from misunderstandings and unrequited feelings are common. According to Shinkai, his stories {{are intended to}} encourage teenagers as they learn to cope with these commonplace experiences. In an interview, {{he admitted that he}} had been <b>accustomed</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> turned down by women, and felt that his stories were encouraging because his characters continue to try, despite being unsuccessful at love. The Garden of Words also illustrated how people do not mature as linearly or elegantly as we often assume. Shinkai himself could relate with Yukari in not feeling as smart or mature at age 27, stating, [...] "We're all still just children at age 27," [...] a point that voice actress Kana Hanazawa also agreed with.|$|E

500|$|On 20 May 1515, an Indian {{rhinoceros}} {{arrived in}} Lisbon from the Far East. In early 1514, Afonso de Albuquerque, governor of Portuguese India, sent ambassadors to Sultan Muzaffar Shah II, ruler of Cambay (modern Gujarat), to seek permission {{to build a}} fort {{on the island of}} Diu. [...] The mission returned without an agreement, but diplomatic gifts were exchanged, including the rhinoceros. At that time, the rulers of different countries would occasionally send each other exotic animals to be kept in a menagerie. The rhinoceros was already well <b>accustomed</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> kept in captivity. Albuquerque decided to forward the gift, known by its Gujarati name of genda, and its Indian keeper, named Ocem, to King Manuel I of Portugal. It sailed on the Nossa Senhora da Ajuda, which left Goa in January 1515. The ship, captained by Francisco Pereira Coutinho, and two companion vessels, all loaded with exotic spices, sailed across the Indian Ocean, around the Cape of Good Hope and north through the Atlantic, stopping briefly in Mozambique, Saint Helena and the Azores.|$|E

Groves came in at 166.4 lb, considerably under the limit, which surprised some observers who were <b>accustomed</b> <b>to</b> him <b>being</b> naturally heavier than Froch.

500|$|The grey jay readily capitalizes on {{novel food}} sources, {{including}} {{taking advantage of}} man-made sources of food. To the frustration of trappers using baits to catch fur-bearing animals or early travelers trying to protect their winter food supplies, and {{to the delight of}} campers, bold grey jays are known to approach humans for treats and to steal from unattended food stores. Grey jays do not change their feeding behavior if watched by people; if they are able to link humans with food, they will not forget. A nesting female that had become <b>accustomed</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> fed by humans was reportedly able to be enticed to leave the nest during incubation and brooding. This behaviour has inspired a number of nicknames for the grey jay, including [...] "lumberjack", [...] "meat-bird", [...] "venison-hawk", [...] "moose-bird", and [...] "gorby", the last two popular in Maine in the northeastern United States. The origin of [...] "gorby", also spelt [...] "gorbey", is unclear but possibly derived from gorb, which in Scots or Irish means [...] "glutton" [...] or [...] "greedy (animal)" [...] or in Scots or northern English [...] "fledgling bird".|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{the rising}} {{importance}} of sailing warships, galleys were more {{closely associated with}} land warfare, and the prestige associated with it. British naval historian Nicholas Rodger has described this as display of [...] "the supreme symbol of royal power... derived from its intimate association with armies, and consequently with princes". This was put to perhaps its greatest effect by the French [...] "Sun King", Louis XIV, {{in the form of}} a dedicated galley corps. Louis and the French state created a tool and symbol of royal authority that did little fighting, but was a potent extension of absolutist ambitions. Galleys were built to scale for the royal flotilla at the Grand Canal at Versailles for the amusement of the court. The royal galleys patrolled the Mediterranean, forcing ships of other states to salute the King's banner, convoyed ambassadors and cardinals, and obediently participating in naval parades and royal pageantry. Historian Paul Bamford described the galleys as vessels that [...] "must have appealed to military men and to aristocratic officers... <b>accustomed</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> obeyed and served".|$|E
2500|$|George Pullman pioneered {{sleeping}} accommodations on trains, and by {{the late}} 1860s, he was hiring only African-Americans to serve as porters. [...] After the Civil War ended in 1865 Pullman {{knew that there was}} a large pool of former slaves who would be looking for work; he also had a very clear racial conception. He was aware that most Americans, unlike the wealthy, didn’t have personal servants in their homes. Pullman also knew the wealthy were <b>accustomed</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> served by a liveried waiter or butler, but to staff the Pullman cars with [...] "properly humble" [...] workers in uniform was something the American middle class had never experienced. [...] Hence, part of the appeal of traveling on sleeping cars was, in a sense, to have an upper class experience. [...] From the very start, porters were featured in Pullman's ads promoting his new sleeper service. [...] Initially, they were one of the features that most clearly distinguished his carriages from those of competitors, but eventually nearly all would follow his lead, hiring African-Americans as porters, cooks, waiters and Red Caps (railway station porters).|$|E

60|$|He was accustomed, as we {{have already}} stated, to join the younger {{children}} in games of hide and go seek. He began now {{to search for the}} most recondite hiding places, where he could not be found, and when he had concealed himself in such a place, he would remain there for a very long time, until his playmates had given up the search in despair. Then, at length, after having been missing for half an hour, he would reappear of his own accord. He thought that by this plan he should get the children and the attendants <b>accustomed</b> <b>to</b> his <b>being</b> for a long time out of sight, so that, when at length he should finally disappear, their attention would not be seriously attracted to the circumstance until he should have had time to get well set out upon his journey.|$|R
