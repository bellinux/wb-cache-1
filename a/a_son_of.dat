5|$|At {{least one}} sibling of Nyuserre is known with near-certainty: Neferefre, who was <b>a</b> <b>son</b> <b>of</b> Neferirkare and Khentkaus II, was Nyuserre's elder brother. Since the {{relation}} between Shepseskare and Nyuserre remains uncertain, {{it is possible that}} the two were brothers too, as suggested by Roth, although the dominant hypothesis is that Shepseskare was <b>a</b> <b>son</b> <b>of</b> Sahure and hence Nyuserre's uncle.|$|E
5|$|After an interregnum {{prompted}} by Eorpwald's assassination, Sigeberht returned from Gaul to become {{ruler of the}} East Angles. It is likely that he gained the kingdom by military means, because his prowess as a commander was later remembered. During his reign, part of the kingdom was governed by Ecgric his 'kinsman', a relationship described by the Latin term cognatus. This may mean that Ecgric was <b>a</b> <b>son</b> <b>of</b> Rædwald. However, the historian Steven Plunkett is amongst those that consider Ecgric {{to be the same}} person as Æthelric, named in the East Anglian tally (in the Anglian collection) as <b>a</b> <b>son</b> <b>of</b> Eni, Rædwald's brother. Whoever the pagan Ecgric was, Sigeberht had equal or senior power while he ruled, because the influence of his religious patronage was felt throughout his kingdom.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the chronicle}} {{indirectly}} implies that Rögnvaldr was also <b>a</b> <b>son</b> <b>of</b> Finnguala, {{there is evidence}} that strongly suggests that he had a different mother. Within a letter from Óláfr to HenryII, King of England, Óláfr describes Rögnvaldr as a bastard. Further evidence is found within a Gaelic praise-poem of Rögnvaldr, which states that he was <b>a</b> <b>son</b> <b>of</b> Sadb, an otherwise unknown Irishwoman who may have been an unrecorded wife or concubine of Guðrøðr. The chronicle records that because Óláfr was only a child {{at the time of his}} father's death, the Manxmen chose Rögnvaldr to rule instead, describing him as a vigorous and hardier man. The chronicle states that Rögnvaldr began his reign the following year, in 1188.|$|E
