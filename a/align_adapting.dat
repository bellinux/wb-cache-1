The programme aimed to embed effective ICT-based teaching practices in schools, together with a student-centred approach that positioned the teacher’s role as a facilitator of learning. An unofficial blogging community, connecting three cluster-based online communities to a global network, was found {{to play a role}} in driving embedding of the new approach. Influential individuals from this community (connector-leaders) employed a set of brokering practices, making differentiated use of technologies to foster knowledge embedding via five processes: focusing, persuading, <b>aligning,</b> <b>adapting</b> and owning. Their influence was extended by the activities of a group of followers who brokered knowledge across the online/offline boundary.

This paper proposes geotracks and geolists, music tracks and playlists of existing music that are <b>aligned</b> and <b>adapted</b> to specific journeys. We describe how everyday walking journeys such as commutes to work and existing popular music tracks can each be analysed, decomposed and then brought together, using musical adaptations including skipping and repeating parts of tracks, dynamically remixing tracks and cross-fades. Using a naturalistic experiment we compared walking while listening to geotracks (dynamically adapted using GPS location information) to walking while listening to a fixed playlist. Overall, participants enjoyed the walk more when listening to the adaptive geotracks. However adapting the lengths of tracks appeared to detract {{from the experience of}} the music in some situations and for some participants, revealing trade-offs in achieving fine-grained alignment of music and walking journeys...|$|R
40|$|Educators, {{government}} {{bodies and}} employers have acknowledged {{the need for}} modern learners to acquire 21 st century skills using information and communication technologies, to personalise student learning. Students need broader skills than the 3 Rs (reading, writing and arithmetic) {{to operate in the}} 21 st century. These broader skills known as the 4 Cs include: creativity, communication, collaboration and critical thinking. The use of information and communication technologies is crucial in developing the 4 Cs in conjunction with understanding how learning takes place. However, simply using technology does not guarantee that deep learning will occur. The use of technology needs to <b>align</b> and <b>adapt</b> with our knowledge of learning to be able to operate in a transformative space.

40|$|This study {{seeks to}} answer the {{question}} how supply chain managers’ capabilities impact individual and firm performance. Organisations have begun to recognise the importance of their supply chain and the necessity for qualified supply chain managers. Therefore, {{there is a need for}} further research on the impact of these capabilities on individual and firm performance. Sustained performance of a firm depends on dynamic capabilities and it allows firms to <b>align</b> and <b>adapt</b> strategies according to the volatile external environment. Using dynamic capabilities theory, the supply chain manager capabilities model was developed as a way for supply chain managers to effectively use their skills and past experiences to improve their own and firm’s performance. Primary data was collected through a survey distributed to supply chain management professionals. The results strongly support the relationship between technology and soft skills with supply chain manager capabilities. Interestingly, our study identifies sequential relationship amongst the three constructs such as capabilities, individual and firm performance. Capabilities are related with individual performance whereas individual performance is related with the firm performance. However, our findings revealed that there is no direct relationship between supply chain manager capabilities and firm performance...|$|R
40|$|There are {{two basic}} {{approaches}} for understanding {{the way in which}} organization change is produced and managed. One approach is based in the objectivist, structural-functionalist tradition that there is an underlying, ordered pattern to the nature of reality, and {{that it is possible to}} come to know and represent this pattern (Burrell and Morgan, 1979). In this view, “true ” reality exists independent of the observer, and increasing one’s knowledge of this objective reality is tantamount to increasing the accuracy and scope of one’s ideas, models, or representations of that reality. In this view, language is simply a tool for description in which words correspond to objects in the world. In the structural-functional approach, the job of a change manager is to understand this reality and to <b>align</b> or <b>adapt</b> the organization to it through appropriate interventions (French and Bell, 1995). Since gaining knowledge is seen as creating an increasingly accurate understanding and reproduction of an objective reality, it is assumed that the extent to which a manager’s representations are accurate and correspond with that reality is the extent to which the change interventions will be successful. This means that ineffective or unsuccessful changes reflect a misunderstanding o...|$|R
40|$|This interpretivist study, in {{the field}} of {{information}} Systems, investigates the process of transformative professional change using a knowledge management lens. The goal of the research was to understand how online communities of practice (CoPs) facilitate the transfer and embedding of professional knowledge. It was guided by the question: How do online CoPs facilitate the transfer and embedding of professional knowledge? This topic was of contemporary and strategic significance in New Zealand: The government had embarked on a strategy to transform teaching in NZ schools, aiming to leverage a major investment in IT infrastructure, using online CoPs to help embed a new paradigm of studentcentred, ICT-enriched learning at system level. There was, however, no research to suggest how this might occur. Despite the increasing use of online CoPs by organisations, and an expansion in the number of tools available for this purpose, there is little understanding of how online CoPs can facilitate knowledge transfer. The way in which knowledge embedding (deep transfer) occurs, and the role online CoPs may play in supporting this process, is particularly poorly understood. This is significant issue in this internet-rich era, when developing nations are aiming to cultivate knowledge economies. I conducted the research using a case research strategy, qualitative methods and an inductive process of theory generation. The research case was a national professional development programme for schools, with five CoP subunits: Four were regionally based school cluster CoPs and one was a distributed blogging community. (Membership of this community overlapped with three of the cluster CoPs.) Based on my analysis of data, and on feedback from participants, I found that three complementary mechanisms were operating simultaneously, facilitating the embedding of knowledge at meso, micro and macro levels. The result of my study is a threelevel explanatory theory. At the meso (school) level, knowledge embedding followed a six-stage cycle, with different activities and issues characterising each stage. Online CoPs played a different role at each stage. At the micro (individual) level, knowledge embedding was driven by teachers' crossings of multiple engagement spaces (communication contexts) in a polycontextual environment. Crossings drove personalisation and facilitated the linking of theory and practice, leading to deep individual understanding. At the macro level, the embedding of knowledge was driven by the brokering function of a middle layer community in a system of overlapping, tiered CoPs. Key roles were played by two kinds of knowledge brokers: connector-leaders and follower-feeders. All three embedding-facilitating mechanisms promoted five fundamental knowledge embedding processes: focusing, persuading, <b>aligning,</b> <b>adapting,</b> and owning (developing ownership) ...|$|R
40|$|Perceptual aftereffects {{provide a}} {{sensitive}} tool {{to investigate the}} influence of eye and head position on visual processing. There have been recent indications that the TAE is remapped {{around the time of}} a saccade to remain <b>aligned</b> to the <b>adapting</b> location in the world. Here, we investigate the spatial frame of reference of the TAE by independently manipulating retinal position, gaze orientation, and head orientation between adaptation and test. The results show that the critical factor in the TAE is the correspondence between the adaptation and test locations in a retinotopic frame of reference, whereas world- and head-centric frames of reference do not play a significant role. Our results confirm that adaptation to orientation takes place at retinotopic levels of visual processing. We suggest that the remapping process that plays a role in visual stability does not transfer feature gain information around the time of eye (or head) movements...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to offer}} an original contribution on the debate on collaborative forecasting both in the academic and managerial perspective. Collaborative Forecasting (CF) - referring {{to the process of}} collecting and reconciling the information from diverse sources inside and outside the company, {{to come up with a}} single unified statement of demand (Hill, 1999) – has been receiving increasing attention in the managerial literature. Following Meredith’s (1998) suggestion to use case studies as a basis for theory formulation, insights from 3 case studies are used to extend existing theory on CF. The first objective of this research is to understand if the phases characterising the CF process are different from those of the conventional forecasting process, and - if yes - what are the main differences. Moreover, this research has a further explorative objective, as it intends to highlight what and how co-ordination mechanisms are activated to <b>adapt,</b> <b>align</b> and synchronise forecasting activities carried out by different members of the networ...|$|R
40|$|While neural machine {{translation}} (NMT) has become the new paradigm, the parameter optimization requires large-scale parallel data which is scarce in many domains and language pairs. In this paper, we address a new translation scenario in which there only exists monolingual corpora and phrase pairs. We propose a new method towards translation with partially aligned sentence pairs which are derived from the phrase pairs and monolingual corpora. To make full use of the partially <b>aligned</b> corpora, we <b>adapt</b> the conventional NMT training method in two aspects. On one hand, different generation strategies are designed for aligned and unaligned target words. On the other hand, a different objective function is designed to model the partially aligned parts. The experiments demonstrate that our method can achieve a relatively good result in such a translation scenario, and tiny bitexts can boost translation quality to a large extent.

40|$|Systematic sensor errors complicate {{centralized}} data fusion. [1] sensor model specific alignment procedures, {{which allow}} the compensation of essential bias values like azimuth deviation and range offset, donot remove systematic errors completely. The residual errors, like time differences between different sources and varying spatial deviations, {{lead to a}} reduction of the tracking performance in the centralized architecture. A detailed statistic of deviations between predicted track states and observations, evaluated for each track and each sensor, provides additional model independent bias information. It turns out, that this information issufficient for afurther decisive reduction of the residual errors. A feedback control mechanism can be established, which allows acontinuous compensation of sensor and track specific bias values down to a level appropriate for the application ofadvanced recursive tracking methods. The centralized tracking, supported by bias control, finally gains its superiority over track fusion mainly fromthe following capabilities: Maneuverrecognition based on bias controlled, multiple source measurements Recursive filter selectionaccording to themaneuvercondition Performance enhancement in grouptracking, 2 Ddata processing, track initiation and correlationgatedetermination The processing of the complete set of <b>aligned</b> data, recursively <b>adapted</b> tothe target maneuver, allows anoptimal use of information from allcontributing sensors. ...|$|R
40|$|Historically, {{profitability}} and efficiency, {{and more}} recently, customer satisfaction, quality, and responsiveness, {{have been the}} dominant concern for organisations (Green Jr. et al., 2012; Mohanty et al. 1999). In this line, ‘Lean’ and ‘Six Sigma’ have been recognised as the two most prominent strategies employed by organisations to attain operational excellence and thus achieve the aforementioned objectives. However, in order to respond to environmental regulations {{and the growth of}} customer demands for products and services that are more environmentally sustainable, companies have now been forced to rethink their objectives and how they manage their operations and processes (Garza-Reyes, 2015 a). For this reason, some organisations have taken a proactive role in developing cleaner supply chains, manufacturing processes and services as well as designing environmentally sustainable products. This has given birth to the emergence of the ‘green paradigm’ as a philosophy and operational approach to improve the environmental efficiency of organisations and reduce the negative ecological impact of their products and services while still achieving their financial objectives (Garza-Reyes, 2015 b). The green paradigm can be considered an initiative (Digalwar et al., 2013) that utilises methods such as environmental operations management, also known as green operations (Nunes and Bennett, 2010), reverse logistics (Sarkis, 2003), green supply chains (Sarkis, 2012), green manufacturing (Kleindorfer et al., 2005), among others, to reduce the negative environmental effect of the consumption and production of products and services (Garza-Reyes, 2015 b). As lean manufacturing aims at the elimination of waste in every area of production, design, supplier network and factory management, its compatibility with the green paradigm seems logical. However, despite their primary and similar objective of fiercely targeting the reduction of waste, the green and lean relationship and their combination as an integrated approach has only recently started to be explored (Dües et al., 2013). For this reason, only few theoretical frameworks and empirical examples are available to guide and explain industrialists how to integrate green methodologies into their current lean practices (Garza-Reyes, 2015 a; Dües et al., 2013), or vice versa. On the other hand, quality is more than just achieving capable and reliable processes or manufacturing products free of defects (Madu and Kuei, 1995). In this context, a system’s overall performance should not only be measured on the basis of product quality but also on the basis of environmental sustainability (Kuei and Madu, 2003). Nevertheless, very few researches have correlated the quality and green paradigms. Total quality environmental management (TQEM), a sub-development of TQM, emphasises environmental controls, in industries that are associated with environmental waste (i. e. electronic component and semiconductors manufacturing) (Sarkis, 2003; Raisinghani et al., 2005). TQEM is a method that correlates quality with green aspects. However, in the case of six sigma, there is very limited evidence of research that has investigated the relationship between six sigma and green initiatives and performance (Garza-Reyes, 2015 b). This relationship requires investigation because the quality and environmental sustainability dimensions are considered mutually dependant (Kuei and Madu, 2003). This special issue (SI) of the International Journal of Lean Six Sigma (IJLSS) therefore intends to explore the synergies between the lean/six sigma and green paradigms by presenting the latest research and developments in lean and six sigma, with particular interest in their combination with the green paradigm and their contribution and impact upon creating environmentally sustainable supply chains, processes, services and products. In particular, this SI focuses on theoretical, practical, novel and original contributions investigating the combination and/or impact of the lean/six sigma strategies on environmental initiatives and performance by addressing the following questions: •	How can lean and/or six sigma be effectively integrated with green strategies and initiatives to support the development, management and improvement of environmentally sustainable supply chains, processes, services and products? •	How have lean and/or six sigma been employed to contribute in achieving greener supply chains, processes, services and products, and what results have been obtained? •	What green-oriented theoretical frameworks, decision-support concepts, methods and tools have been proposed based on lean and/or six sigma and how have they been integrated as part of the corporate, business or functional strategies of organisations? •	How can organisations <b>align,</b> <b>adapt</b> and deploy lean/six sigma strategies to effectively respond to and support the current environmental challenges without jeopardising their business success? •	How can lean/six sigma aid organisations to balance the need for operational excellence and profit gains with that of environmental compliance? •	What empirical evidence exists of the application of lean/six sigma to improve the environmental performance of organisations...|$|R
