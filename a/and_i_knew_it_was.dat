2500|$|A {{month after}} the Gomez fight, it was {{announced}} that Jorge Rubio would become Khan's new trainer. Rubio was chosen because Khan thought that he had very good chemistry with the Cuban trainer. Khan said, [...] "Rubio was showing me all these new training techniques, and I felt so comfortable because it suited my style. I knew I had the hand speed and the footwork to do it <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> going to make me a much better fighter".|$|E
2500|$|On 29 January 2005 it was {{announced}} {{after a lot of}} speculation that Ryan, along with Kim Medcalf (Sam), would be leaving. A source for the show said, [...] "Michelle [...] has made no secret of her plans to leave the soap in recent months. Despite her character being at the centre of some of the show's biggest storylines, the actress is now considering a modelling career." [...] The source added, [...] "Michelle is hot property and has been inundated with offers of other acting work. She's also had several offers of lucrative modelling projects." [...] Speaking about her decision to quit she told The Sun,Everyone knew {{it was time for me}} to go <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> time for me to move on."Then Jessie , who plays my screen mum Kat, said, 'You're young, so get out there. Now's the time to go for it. You're only young once and you can't stay here forever.' ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{shooting}} of Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old African American boy (June 25, 2002 – November 23, 2014), occurred on November 22, 2014, in Cleveland, Ohio. Two police officers, 26-year-old Timothy Loehmann and 46-year-old Frank Garmback, responded {{after receiving a}} police dispatch call of a black male that [...] "keeps pulling a gun out of his pants and pointing it at people". A caller reported that a male was pointing [...] "a pistol" [...] at random people in the Cudell Recreation Center. At {{the beginning of the}} call and again in the middle he says of the pistol [...] "it's probably fake". [...] Toward the end of the two-minute call, the caller stated [...] "he is probably a juvenile". However, this information was not relayed to Loehmann or Garmback on the initial dispatch. The officers reported that upon their arrival, they both continuously yelled [...] "show me your hands" [...] through the open patrol car window. [...] Loehmann further claimed that instead of showing his hands, it appeared as if Rice was trying to draw the replica: [...] "I knew it was a gun <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> coming out". In response, the officer shot twice, hitting Rice once in the torso. He died on the following day.|$|E

6000|$|It was {{spring the}} first time that I saw her, for her papa and mamma [...] moved in [...] Next door, just as skating was over, and marbles about to begin; [...] For the fence in our back yard was broken, and I saw, as I peeped [...] through the slat, [...] There were [...] "Johnny-jump-ups" [...] all around her, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> [...] spring just by that.|$|E
60|$|Now, I too had {{so often}} {{thought it a}} pity, that, in the {{singular}} kind of quarrel with myself which I was always carrying on, I was half inclined to shed tears of vexation and distress when Biddy gave utterance to her sentiment and my own.

6000|$|... "It wasn't dreadful, Jo, only so sad! I saw in {{a minute}} it was sicker, but Lottchen said her mother had gone for a doctor, so I took Baby and let Lotty rest.

6000|$|... "But I {{paid for}} it. It {{was two years}} and over before I knew what happened. All I knew was that I was Julian Jones and that I'd been blacklisted in the big strike, and that I was married to Sarah here. I mean that. I didn't know {{anything}} in between, and when Sarah tried to talk about it, it gave me pains in the head. I mean my head was queer, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> queer.|$|E

"I shan't {{tell you}} what they said, because I don't {{remember}} much of it; but I heard Polly and Fan talking about some one dreadful mysterious, and when I asked who it was, Fan said,'Sir Philip.'

60|$|The {{upshot of}} my meditations was that I asked Stephen {{down to dinner}} with us from church one day.

If it had been Jane Miranda I don't know that I'd have bothered; but Lizzie Pye wouldn't have done for a stepmother for Althea's boys at all. She was too bad-tempered, and as mean as second skimmings besides.|$|E

60|$|The men I {{was not so}} much struck with. They {{were very}} distinguished-looking and very gentlemanly and {{polished}} in manner,--very, very different from what few young men there were at Canterbury. But they had a languid air about them which impressed me unpleasantly. They gave me the idea that they had gone out so much into society that they had quite ceased to care for dancing, and that even conversation was too much labour to be undertaken; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> bad taste, but I certainly preferred as partners the officers I had met at Canterbury to these languid young Guardsmen and scions of nobility.|$|E
60|$|I was indignant beyond measure. Had not Dermot {{told him}} the true story? He shook his head, and was much {{concerned}} at having to say so, but he had so entirely ceased to put any confidence in Dermot's statements that he preferred not listening to them. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> vain to try to show him the difference between deliberate falsehood, which was abhorrent to Dermot, and the exaggerations and mystifications to which his uncle's solemnity always prompted him. I appealed to the county paper; {{but he had been}} abroad at the time, and had, moreover, been told that the facts had been hushed up.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Some {{people had}} asked me to take their boy, three years and a half old, to school--a wretched pair, with a little savage for a son. I said I would speak to Miss Wilkins, and put plainly before her the {{character}} of parents and child. However, she wished to have him, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> so far well to get the boy away from home. But such a scene ensued! The boy was really like a little savage; kicked, dashed his head against the wall, and at length, with his nose bleeding violently, exhausted with his violence, fell asleep. Next day, he is so bad, he is sent home; when the mother drives him back to school, cursing and swearing, telling Miss Wilkins she may kill him if she pleases! Unluckily, I was not in school.|$|E
60|$|Twelve {{nights and}} eleven days {{we had been}} driving in the boat, when old Mr. Rarx began to be delirious, and to cry out to me to throw the gold {{overboard}} or it would sink us, and {{we should all be}} lost. For days past the child had been declining, and that was the great cause of his wildness. He had been over and over again shrieking out to me to give her all the remaining meat, to give her all the remaining rum, to save her at any cost, or we should all be ruined. At this time, she lay in her mother's arms at my feet. One of her little hands was almost always creeping about her mother's neck or chin. I had watched the wasting of the little hand, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> nearly over.|$|E
6000|$|... "It was cruel of me, sir, and {{altogether}} unjust, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> when I said it, but I couldn't help it. I {{felt as if}} I had a {{devil in}} me. I was just mad with sorrow and hopelessness, and yet each word seemed to come as cold and hard from me {{as if it was}} frozen. For a moment she didn't move, and then, all of a sudden like, she gave a twist out of my arms and went straight down. I grabbed at her, and just got hold of her cloak and pulled her up again. She never moved after that, but just lay quiet on my arm as if she was dead. Her head was back, half in, half out of the water; and it was only by the tears that run down sometimes through her eyelids, and by a little sob in her breast, that I knew that she was sensible.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pray don't leave off telling me," [...] said Margaret--"it is {{just what}} I wish on my own account, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> is {{comfortable}} {{to have a good}} grumble." ...|$|R
