5|$|In 1855, Tchaikovsky's father funded {{private lessons}} with Rudolph Kündinger and {{questioned}} {{him about a}} musical career for his son. While impressed with the boy's talent, Kündinger said he saw nothing to suggest a future composer or performer. He later admitted that his assessment was also based on his own negative experiences as a musician in Russia and his unwillingness for Tchaikovsky to be treated likewise. Tchaikovsky was told to finish his course <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>try</b> for a post in the Ministry of Justice.|$|E
5|$|Music {{was not a}} {{priority}} at the School, but Tchaikovsky regularly attended the theater and the opera with other students. He was fond of works by Rossini, Bellini, Verdi and Mozart. Piano manufacturer Franz Becker made occasional visits to the School as a token music teacher. This was the only formal music instruction Tchaikovsky received there. From 1855 the composer's father, Ilya Tchaikovsky, funded private lessons with Rudolph Kündinger, a well-known piano teacher from Nuremberg, and questioned Kündinger about a musical career for his son. Kündinger replied that nothing suggested a potential composer or even a fine performer. Tchaikovsky was told to finish his course <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>try</b> for a post in the Ministry of Justice.|$|E
5|$|To remedy this, {{assorted}} {{odds and}} ends were used to reinforce 18th Army. The first of these was the only German cavalry division, aptly named 1st Kavalleriedivision. The mounted troops of this unit, accompanied by some infantry, were to occupy the weakly defended provinces east of the river IJssel <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>try</b> to cross the Afsluitdijk (Enclosure Dike). A simultaneous landing in Holland near Enkhuizen was to be attempted, using barges to be captured in the small port of Stavoren. As both efforts were unlikely to succeed, the mass of regular divisions was reinforced by the SS-Verfügungsdivision (including SS-Standarten Der Führer, Deutschland and Germania) and Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler, which would serve as assault infantry to breach the Dutch fortified positions. Still this added only 1 division to the equation.|$|E

25|$|Wolverines inhabiting the Old World (specifically, Fennoscandia) hunt more {{actively}} than their North American relatives. This {{may be because}} competing predator populations in Eurasia are not as dense, making it more practical for the wolverine to hunt for itself than to wait for another animal to make a kill <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>try</b> to snatch it. They often feed on carrion left by wolves, so changes in wolf populations may affect the population of wolverines. They are also known on occasion to eat plant material.|$|E

Sending his luggage ahead of him, Wingate set off in September 1927 by bicycle, travelling first through France and Germany before making his way to Genoa via Czechoslovakia, Austria and Yugoslavia. From Genoa he took a boat to Egypt. From Cairo he travelled to Khartoum.|$|E
500|$|Casino Royale {{had been}} {{produced}} as a 1954 television episode and a 1967 satirical film. [...] Eon Productions gained {{the rights to}} Casino Royale in 1999 after Sony Pictures Entertainment exchanged them for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's rights to Spider-Man. In March 2004, Neal Purvis and Robert Wade began writing a screenplay for Pierce Brosnan as Bond, aiming {{to bring back the}} flavour of Ian Fleming's original Bond novels. Paul Haggis' main contribution was to rewrite the climax of the film. He explained, [...] "the draft that was there was very faithful to the book and there was a confession, so in the original draft the character confessed and killed herself. She then sent Bond to chase after the villains; Bond chased the villains into the house. I don't know why but I thought that Vesper had to be in the sinking house and Bond has to want to kill her <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>try</b> and save her." ...|$|E

500|$|When writing lyrics for {{previous}} releases, Moore would [...] "start mumbling and I try {{to figure}} out what I'm saying <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>try</b> to make it make sense". With Blood, he [...] "really wrote them down and tried to make them coherent. I didn't want it to be like 'Oh, you get your own impression of the lyrics. Everybody has their own idea!' I wanted to have an idea that I wanted to communicate, and something communicable." [...] Moore noted that he did occasionally use his [...] "mumbling" [...] method as it [...] "puts you in the right direction as far as sounds, vowel sounds, and stresses on certain syllables. And if you can write some words and lyrics that match that, sometimes it flows really well." [...] He described all the songs as based on [...] "personal experiences". [...] "I'll start writing a song that has a little bit of a world view or political view or something," [...] he said, [...] "but then by the time I'm finished the lyrics it'll be about a relationship or something like that." ...|$|E
500|$|Casino Royale reboots the series, {{establishing}} a new timeline and narrative framework {{not meant to}} precede or succeed any previous Bond film. Barbara Broccoli stated that [...] "For years, my father wanted to make Casino Royale—it's the Holy Grail... We {{wanted to make a}} tougher film, the way it should have been made years ago". Fellow producer Michael G. Wilson agreed, commenting [...] "We felt the last film was too fantastical, so we {{decided to go back to}} the basics and update". Neal Purvis and Robert Wade began writing a screenplay at the end of February 2004, while Pierce Brosnan was still Bond. Paul Haggis was brought in later, and his main contribution included rewriting the climax of the film. He explained that [...] "the draft that was there was very faithful to the book and there was a confession, so in the original draft the character confessed and killed herself. She then sent Bond to chase after the villains; Bond chased the villains into the house. I don't know why but I thought that Vesper [...] had to be in the sinking house and Bond has to want to kill her <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>try</b> and save her". In February 2005 Martin Campbell was announced as the film's director and the next Bond film was revealed to be Casino Royale, although the identity of the new Bond was still unknown; the producers had chosen not to renew Pierce Brosnan's contract, and in October Eon announced that the part of Bond would be taken by Daniel Craig.|$|E

2500|$|Wolfram {{argues that}} the {{computational}} realities of the universe make science hard for fundamental reasons. But he also argues that by {{understanding the importance of}} these realities, we can learn to use them in our favor. For instance, instead of reverse engineering our theories from observation, we can enumerate systems <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>try</b> to match them to the behaviors we observe. A major theme of NKS [...] is investigating the structure of the possibility space. Wolfram argues that science is far too ad hoc, in part because the models used are too complicated and unnecessarily organized around the limited primitives of traditional mathematics. Wolfram advocates using models whose variations are enumerable and whose consequences are straightforward to compute and analyze.|$|E
