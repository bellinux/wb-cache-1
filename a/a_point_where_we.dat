40|$|In “Empathy and its discontents” Bloom (2017 : {{see also}} Bloom, 2016) argues {{that we should}} abandon empathy as a moral compass in favor of compassion. Bloom’s central premise is that empathy is narrow in its focus on single {{identified}} individuals, biased in that it favors the in-group, {{and can be used}} as a tool to motivate us to do things that are not optimally effective, or even destructive (e. g., motivate war). For all these reasons, Bloom argues that policy decision should not be motivated by empathy. There is indeed ample evidence that empathy is fraught with biases and we have, as Bloom, argued that deliberate mechanisms are needed to counteract the innumeracy and parochialism of empathy (Slovic and Västfjäll, 2010). While there is much to agree with Bloom on, there are <b>a</b> few <b>points</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> disagree; (1) the definition of compassion, (2) data supporting why empathy, but not compassion, is bad, (3) the role of deliberation in moral judgment.   Funding agencies: National Science Foundation, Vetenskapsradet; Riksbankens Jubileumsfond</p...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a family of}} spherical three dimensional spacelike slices embedded in the Schwarzschild solution. The mean curvature is constant on each slice but can change from slice to slice. We give a simple expression for an everywhere positive lapse and thus we show how to construct foliations. There is a barrier preventing the mean curvature from becoming large, and we show how to avoid this so as to construct a foliation where the mean curvature runs {{all the way from}} zero to infinity. No foliation exists where the mean curvature goes from minus to plus infinity. There are slicings, however, where each slice passes through the bifurcation sphere $R = 2 M$ and the lapse only vanishes at this one point, and is positive everywhere else, while the mean curvature does run from minus to plus infinity. Symmetric foliations of the extended Schwarzschild spacetime degenerate at <b>a</b> critical <b>point,</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> show that the lapse function exponentially approaches zero.

The structure of the future medical school is delineated in a rough sketch, and so are the roles of the future medical teacher.
