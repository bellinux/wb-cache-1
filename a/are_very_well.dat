5|$|Cameroon's natural {{resources}} <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> suited to agriculture and arboriculture. An estimated 70% {{of the population}} farms, and agriculture comprised an estimated 19.8% of GDP in 2009. Most agriculture is done at the subsistence scale by local farmers using simple tools. They sell their surplus produce, and some maintain separate fields for commercial use. Urban centres are particularly reliant on peasant agriculture for their foodstuffs. Soils and climate on the coast encourage extensive commercial cultivation of bananas, cocoa, oil palms, rubber, and tea. Inland on the South Cameroon Plateau, cash crops include coffee, sugar, and tobacco. Coffee is a major cash crop in the western highlands, and in the north, natural conditions favour crops such as cotton, groundnuts, and rice. Reliance on agricultural exports makes Cameroon vulnerable to shifts in their prices.|$|E
5|$|The fossils {{found in}} {{abundance}} along this coastline {{provide evidence of}} how animals and plants evolved in this region. During the Triassic this area was a desert, while in the Jurassic {{it was part of}} a tropical sea, and in the Cretaceous it was covered by swamps. The fossilised remains of the animals and plants that lived in those periods <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> preserved, providing a wealth of information on their body shapes, the way they died and even the fossilised remains of their last meals. Fossil groups found here include crustaceans, insects, molluscs, echinoderms, fish, amphibians, reptiles and a few mammals. At Lulworth Cove there is a fossil forest of conifers, tree-ferns and cycads.|$|E
5|$|With a {{body mass}} of , Drymoreomys is a {{medium-sized}} rodent with long fur that is orange to reddish-buff above and grayish with several white patches below. The pads on the hindfeet <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> developed {{and there is}} brown fur on the upper sides of the feet. The tail is brown above and below. The front part of the skull is relatively long and the ridges on the braincase are weak. The palate is short, with its back margin between the third molars. Several traits of the genitals are not seen in any other oryzomyine rodent.|$|E

5|$|P. gobiensis {{is named}} for the region it was found in 2001, and first {{described}} by Sereno, Zhao and Lin in 2010. It is known from a skull and partial articulated skeleton with gastroliths. Many other specimens either cannot be determined to belong to any particular species, or {{have not yet been}} assigned to one. These specimens are generally all referred to as Psittacosaurus sp., although it is not assumed that they belong to the same species. More than 200 specimens of Psittacosaurus have been found in the Yixian Formation, which is famous for its fossils of feathered dinosaurs. The vast majority of these have not been assigned to any published species, although many <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> preserved and some have already been partially described. Nearly 100 Psittacosaurus skeletons were excavated in Mongolia during the summers of 2005 and 2006 by a team led by Mongolian paleontologist Bolortsetseg Minjin and American Jack Horner from the Museum of the Rockies in Montana. Although only P. mongoliensis has been described from Mongolia so far, these specimens are still in preparation and have not yet been assigned to a species.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} an abelian group {{is one of the}} first {{concepts}} encountered in undergraduate abstract algebra, from which many other basic concepts, such as modules and vector spaces, are developed. The theory of abelian groups is generally simpler than that of their non-abelian counterparts, and finite abelian groups <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> understood. On the other hand, the theory of infinite abelian groups is an area of current research.|$|E

Another feature is that the process of nucleosynthesis is determined by conditions at the start of this phase of the life of the universe, and proceeds independently of what happened before.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} of Dreadnoughtus schrani provides {{insight into the}} size and anatomy of giant titanosaurian dinosaurs, especially of the limbs and the shoulder and hip girdles. The majority of D. schrani bones <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> preserved. There is minimal deformation, especially in the limb bones. Fine features, such as locations of muscle attachment, are frequently clearly visible. Dreadnoughtus also has an unusually long neck for its body size, making up {{almost half of the}} animal's length.|$|E
25|$|The series {{tells the}} story of Daisuke Aso, a private detective who investigates paranormal cases {{involving}} Japanese urban legends that come to exist because of people's belief. Manga critics considered this concept interesting, although most of them did not find the series to be as unsettling as a horror series could be. Some argued it was more comedic than horrific, and its pacing was mostly criticized. Its art was met with divergent opinions, but overall consensus is that while human characters are not well drawn, Esuno's monsters <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> done and horrifying.|$|E

25|$|In {{temperate}} Europe, {{mixed forest}} with both broadleaf and coniferous trees dominate. The most important species {{in central and}} western Europe are beech and oak. In the north, the taiga is a mixed spruce–pine–birch forest; further north within Russia and extreme northern Scandinavia, the taiga gives way to tundra as the Arctic is approached. In the Mediterranean, many olive trees have been planted, which <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> adapted to its arid climate; Mediterranean Cypress is also widely planted in southern Europe. The semi-arid Mediterranean region hosts much scrub forest. A narrow east-west tongue of Eurasian grassland (the steppe) extends eastwards from Ukraine and southern Russia and ends in Hungary and traverses into taiga to the north.|$|E
25|$|The {{soil profile}} of the {{vineyard}} is very diverse across the collection of east, west and south-facing slopes. Throughout the vineyard {{is a mix of}} calcareous rocks, clay, loam, sand, sandstone and silt. The soils <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> draining and with the arid desert climate of the region that sees only around 6 inches of annual precipitation, irrigation is a must. Located on the far western edge of the Yakima Valley, Red Willow experiences generally warmer climate conditions than the greater Yakima Valley with growing degree day averaging 2796 units since 2003 in contrast to the 2169 GDD units averaged by Yakima Valley vineyards in the subappellation of the Rattlesnake Hills AVA.|$|E
25|$|Ten {{of these}} papyri <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> preserved. The {{majority}} of these documents date to the 27th year of Khufu's reign and describe how the central administration sent food and supplies to the sailors and wharf workers. The datation of these important documents is secured by phrases typical for the Old Kingdom period, alongside the fact, that the letters are addressed to the king himself and Khufu is addressed by his Horus name. This was a typical behaviour when an addressed king was still alive; when the ruler was already dead, he was addressed by his cartouche name or birth name. One document is of special interest: the diary of Mererer, an official involved {{in the building of}} the Great Pyramid. Using the diary, researchers were able to reconstruct three months of his life, providing new insight into everyday lives of people of the Fourth Dynasty. These papyri are the earliest examples of imprinted papyri ever found in Egypt. Another inscription, found at the limestone walls of the harbor, mention the head of the royal scribes controlling the ware exchanges: Idu.|$|E

According to Dandolo, [...] "it is more than clear that the merchants <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> {{informed}} {{about the state of}} the poll, and that the cardinals' attendants in Conclave go partners with them in wagers, which thus causes many tens of thousands of crowns to change hands" [...] (an early example of insider trading).|$|E

500|$|In 2007, {{the carcass}} {{of a female}} calf nicknamed [...] "Lyuba" [...] was {{discovered}} near the Yuribey River, {{where it had been}} buried for 41,800 years.

At the time of discovery, its eyes and trunk were intact and some fur remained on its body. Its organs and skin <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> preserved. [...] "Lyuba" [...] is believed to have been suffocated by mud in a river that its herd was crossing. After death, its body may have been colonised by bacteria that produce lactic acid, which [...] "pickled" [...] it, preserving the mammoth in a nearly pristine state.|$|E
