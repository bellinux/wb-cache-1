25|$|Plain RNAs may be poor immunogens, but {{antibodies}} {{can easily}} be created against RNA-protein complexes. Many autoimmune diseases see these types of antibodies. There havenâ€™t yet been reports of antibodies against siRNA bound to proteins. Some methods for siRNA delivery adjoin polyethylene glycol (PEG) to the oligonucleotide reducing excretion and improving circulating half-life. However recently a large Phase III trial of PEGylated RNA <b>aptamer</b> against factor IX had to be discontinued by Regado Biosciences because of a severe anaphylactic reaction to the PEG part of the RNA. This reaction led to death in some cases and raises significant concerns about siRNA delivery when PEGylated oligonucleotides are involved.|$|E
500|$|His {{experimental}} work pioneered the hybridization chain reaction method, the first {{demonstration of the}} self-assembly of nucleic acid structures conditional on a molecular input. The method arose from attempts to use DNA hairpins as [...] "fuel" [...] for DNA machines, but Dirks and Pierce realized that they could instead be used for signal amplification, and when {{used in conjunction with}} an <b>aptamer,</b> as a biosensor. As an enzyme-free, isothermal method, it later found application as the basis of an immunoassay method, for in situ hybridization imaging of gene expression, and as the basis for catalytic, isothermal self-assembly of DNA nanostructures.|$|E
2500|$|Riboswitches {{are often}} conceptually {{divided into two}} parts: an <b>aptamer</b> and an {{expression}} platform. [...] The <b>aptamer</b> directly binds the small molecule, and the expression platform undergoes structural changes {{in response to the}} changes in the <b>aptamer.</b> The expression platform is what regulates gene expression.|$|E
50|$|The <b>aptamer</b> HD22 (also {{known as}} HTDQ) is an {{optimized}} <b>aptamer</b> with 29 (5-AGTCCGTGGTAGGGCAGGTTGGGGTGACT-3) or 27 (lacking {{the first and}} the last nucleotides of 29-mer form) nucleotides. This <b>aptamer</b> recognizes the exosite II of thrombin, which is involved in the activation of factor V and factor VIII and mediates the heparin binding. Therefore, HD22 inhibits the activations of factors V/VIII rather than that of fibrinogen. Despite that this <b>aptamer</b> only shows moderate effect on fibrinogen regulation, the affinity of this <b>aptamer</b> is slightly higher than TBA (KD~0.5 nM), and nowadays this <b>aptamer</b> is widely used for developments of <b>aptamer</b> sensor.|$|E

5000|$|... (2005) Eastern blot {{has been}} used to {{describe}} a blot of proteins on PVDF membrane where the probe is an <b>aptamer</b> rather than an antibody. This could be seen as similar to a Southern blot, however the interaction is between a DNA molecule(the <b>aptamer)</b> and a protein, rather than two DNA molecules. The method is similar to South-western blotting.|$|E
50|$|Three subcategories of the PreQ1 riboswitch exist: preQ1-I, preQ1-II, and preQ1-III. PreQ1-I has a {{distinctly}} small <b>aptamer,</b> ranging from 25 to 45 nucleotides long, {{compared to the}} structures of PreQ1-II riboswitch and preQ1-III riboswitch. PreQ1-II riboswitch, only found in Lactobacillales, has a larger and more complex consensus sequence and structure than preQ1-I riboswitch, {{with an average of}} 58 nucleotides composing its <b>aptamer,</b> which forms as many as five base-paired substructures. PreQ1-III riboswitch has a distinct structure and is also larger in <b>aptamer</b> size than preQ1-I riboswitch, ranging from sizes ranging from 33 to 58 nucleotides. PreQ1-III riboswitch has an atypically organized pseudoknot that does not appear to incorporate its downstream expression platform at its ribosome binding site (RBS).|$|E
5000|$|Despite the {{relative}} similarity of the purine-binding <b>aptamer</b> domain across different purine riboswitches, one binding pocket can still discriminate {{for a single}} type of purine ligand with high selectivity. [...] Critical to this sensitivity is a single difference in the secondary structure of ribonucleotides: in position 74 of the <b>aptamer</b> domain, {{it has been found}} that conversion of a cytosine to a uracil changes an <b>aptamer</b> from being guanine sensitive to being adenine sensitive, and vice versa. [...] Such a conversion is owed to the ability of a nucleotide in position 74 to Watson-Crick base pair with the ligand in the binding pocket, and cytosine and uracil's respective ability to preferentially hydrogen-bond with guanine or adenine.|$|E

50|$|Non-modified aptamers are cleared rapidly {{from the}} bloodstream, with a {{half-life}} of minutes to hours, mainly due to nuclease degradation and clearance {{from the body}} by the kidneys, {{a result of the}} aptamer's inherently low molecular weight. Unmodified <b>aptamer</b> applications currently focus on treating transient conditions such as blood clotting, or treating organs such as the eye where local delivery is possible. This rapid clearance can be an advantage in applications such as in vivo diagnostic imaging. An example is a tenascin-binding <b>aptamer</b> under development by Schering AG for cancer imaging. Several modifications, such as 2'-fluorine-substituted pyrimidines, polyethylene glycol (PEG) linkage, etc. (both of which are used in Macugen, an FDA-approved <b>aptamer)</b> are available to scientists with which to increase the serum half-life of aptamers easily to the day or even week time scale.|$|E
50|$|The {{need for}} fluorescently {{tracking}} RNA rose as its roles in complex cellular functions {{has grown to}} not only include mRNA, rRNA, and tRNA, but also RNAi, siRNA, snoRNA, and lncRNA, among others. Spinach is a synthetically derived RNA <b>aptamer</b> born out {{of the need for}} a way of studying the role of RNAs at the cellular level. This <b>aptamer</b> was created using Systematic Evolution for Ligands by EXponential enrichment, or SELEX, which is also known as in vitro evolution. The <b>aptamer</b> was designed to be an RNA mimic of green fluorescent protein (GFP); similar to GFP for proteins, Spinach can be used for the fluorescently labeling RNA and tracking it in vivo. A method for inserting the Spinach sequence after an RNA sequence of interest is readily available.|$|E

50|$|In 2002, Hirao et al. {{developed}} an unnatural base pair between 2-amino-8-(2-thienyl)purine (s) and pyridine-2-one (y) that functions in vitro in transcription and translation toward a genetic code for protein synthesis containing a non-standard amino acid. In 2006, they created 7-(2-thienyl)imidazo4,5-bpyridine (Ds) and pyrrole-2-carbaldehyde (Pa) {{as a third}} base pair for replication and transcription, and afterward, Ds and 4-3-(6-aminohexanamido)-1-propynyl-2-nitropyrrole (Px) was discovered as a high fidelity pair in PCR amplification.

50|$|Aptamers are {{particular}} DNA ligands {{that target}} biomolecules such as proteins. SPR imaging platform {{would be a}} good choice to characterize <b>aptamer</b> -protein interactions. To study the aptamer-protein interaction, first oligonucleotides are grafted through formation of thiol Self Assembling Monolayer (SAM) on gold substrate using piezoelectric dispensing system. Thiol groups are introduced on DNA nucleotides by N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS). Target oligonucleotides having a primary amine group at their 59th end are conjugated to HS-C (11)-NHS in phosphate buffer solution at pH 8.0 for one hour at room temperature. <b>Aptamer</b> grafting biosensor is placed on SPRM after rinsing. Then Thrombin is co-injected with excess of cytochrome C for signal specificity. Concentration of free thrombin is determined by calibration curve obtained by plotting initial slope of the signal at the beginning of injection against concentration. The interaction of thrombin and the <b>aptamer</b> can be monitored on microarray in real-time during injections of thrombin at different concentrations. Solution phase dissociation constant KDsol (3.16Â±1.16 nM) is calculated from the measured concentrations of free thrombin.|$|E

50|$|Another {{demonstration}} of UBPs were achieved by Ichiro Hirao's group at RIKEN institute in Japan. In 2002, they developed an unnatural base pair between 2-amino-8-(2-thienyl)purine (s) and pyridine-2-one (y) that functions in vitro in transcription and translation, for the site-specific incorporation of non-standard amino acids into proteins. In 2006, they created 7-(2-thienyl)imidazo4,5-bpyridine (Ds) and pyrrole-2-carbaldehyde (Pa) {{as a third}} base pair for replication and transcription.

In 2013, they applied the Ds-Px pair to DNA <b>aptamer</b> generation by in vitro selection (SELEX) and demonstrated the genetic alphabet expansion significantly augment DNA <b>aptamer</b> affinities to target proteins.|$|E
50|$|Furthermore, the Hirao lab {{applied a}} genetic {{alphabet}} expansion using an unnatural base pair to SELEX and achieved {{the generation of}} high affinity DNA aptamers. Only few hydrophobic unnatural base as a fifth base significantly augment the <b>aptamer</b> affinity to target proteins.|$|E
50|$|Non-covalent binding of inhibitor: in {{this method}} a peptide, {{antibody}} or <b>aptamer</b> are non-covalently {{bound to the}} enzyme at low temperature and inhibit its activity. After an incubation of 1-5 minutes at 95 Â°C, the inhibitor is released and the reaction starts.|$|E
50|$|Both DNA and RNA aptamers show robust binding affinities {{for various}} targets. DNA and RNA aptamers have been {{selected}} for the same target. These targets include lysozyme, thrombin, human immunodeficiency virus trans-acting responsive element (HIV TAR), hemin, interferon Î³, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), prostate specific antigen (PSA), dopamine, and the non-classical oncogene, heat shock factor 1 (HSF1). In the case of lysozyme, HIV TAR, VEGF and dopamine the DNA <b>aptamer</b> is the analog of the RNA <b>aptamer,</b> with thymine replacing uracil. The hemin, thrombin, and interferon Î³, DNA and RNA aptamers were selected through independent selections and have unique sequences. Considering that not all DNA analogs of RNA aptamers show functionality, the correlation between DNA and RNA sequence and their structure and function requires further investigation.|$|E
