About 375,000 people were sterilized against their will due to their disabilities.|$|E
5|$|By 1952, {{the farm}} had become <b>a</b> <b>burden</b> <b>to</b> Olga and her husband. They were both elderly; their sons had moved away; labor {{was hard to}} come by; the Colonel {{suffered}} increasing ill-health, and some of Olga's remaining jewelry was stolen. The farm was sold, and Olga, {{her husband and her}} former maid, Mimka, moved to a smaller five-room house at 2130 Camilla Road, Cooksville, Ontario, a suburb of Toronto now amalgamated into the city of Mississauga. Mimka suffered a stroke that left her an invalid, and Olga nursed her until Mimka's death on 24 January 1954.|$|E
5|$|Though Brownlee {{was no more}} {{enthusiastic}} than Reid about deficits, his continued confidence in his Provincial Treasurer was evidenced by his decision to give him yet another ministerial portfolio. In 1930 Brownlee secured Alberta's long-sought control over its natural resources from the federal government, and he appointed Reid Alberta's first Minister of Lands and Mines on 10 October 1930. In this capacity, Reid favoured private over public ownership. He opposed calls from his own party to promote government-developed hydroelectricity projects, and viewed the provincially owned railways as <b>a</b> <b>burden</b> <b>to</b> the government, though they finally turned a profit in 1927. He was a leading advocate of selling them to private interests, a course that was eventually followed in 1929.|$|E

5|$|During the withdraw, however, A Company {{ran into}} a sizable North Korean force and had {{scattered}} in the ensuing fight. Most of the company, including its commander were killed at close range. In this desperate action, Private First Class Luther H. Story, a weapons squad leader, fought so tenaciously that {{he was awarded the}} Medal of Honor. Badly wounded, Story refused to be <b>a</b> <b>burden</b> <b>to</b> those who might escape, and when last seen was still engaging North Korean at close range. Of those in the company, approximately ten men escaped to friendly lines. The next morning, under heavy fog, the group made its way by compass toward Yongsan. From a hill at 12:00, after the fog had lifted, the men looked down on the Battle of Yongsan which was then in progress. That afternoon 20 survivors of the company merged into the lines of the 72nd Tank Battalion near Yongsan. Stragglers from this position continued to stream {{in the next few days}} as well.|$|E
5|$|George VI's {{coronation}} at Westminster Abbey {{took place}} on 12 May 1937, the date previously intended for Edward's coronation. In a break with tradition, Queen Mary attended the ceremony {{in a show of}} support for her son. There was no Durbar held in Delhi for George VI, as had occurred for his father, as the cost would have been <b>a</b> <b>burden</b> <b>to</b> the government of India. Rising Indian nationalism made the welcome that the royal party would have received likely to be muted at best, and a prolonged absence from Britain would have been undesirable in the tense period before the Second World War. Two overseas tours were undertaken, to France and to North America, both of which promised greater strategic advantages in the event of war.|$|E
5|$|Innocent {{gave some}} dispensations as the crisis progressed. Monastic {{communities}} {{were allowed to}} celebrate Mass in private from 1209 onwards, and late in 1212 the Holy Viaticum for the dying was authorised. The rules on burials and lay access to churches {{appear to have been}} steadily circumvented, at least unofficially. Although the interdict was <b>a</b> <b>burden</b> <b>to</b> much of the population, it did not result in rebellion against John. By 1213, though, John was increasingly worried about the threat of French invasion. Some contemporary chroniclers suggested that in January Philip II of France had been charged with deposing John on behalf of the papacy, although it appears that Innocent merely prepared secret letters in case Innocent needed to claim the credit if Philip did successfully invade England.|$|E

5|$|Nasser also {{attempted}} to maintain {{oversight of the}} country's civil service {{to prevent it from}} inflating and consequently becoming <b>a</b> <b>burden</b> <b>to</b> the state. New laws provided workers with a minimum wage, profit shares, free education, free health care, reduced working hours, and encouragement to participate in management. Land reforms guaranteed the security of tenant farmers, promoted agricultural growth, and reduced rural poverty. As a result of the 1962 measures, government ownership of Egyptian business reached 51percent, and the National Union was renamed the Arab Socialist Union (ASU). With these measures came more domestic repression, as thousands of Islamists were imprisoned, including dozens of military officers. Nasser's tilt toward a Soviet-style system led his aides Boghdadi and Hussein el-Shafei to submit their resignations in protest.|$|E
5|$|At {{daylight}} on {{the morning}} of 4 September only two officers and approximately half the men who had assembled on the hill, were alive. As the day passed, with ammunition down to about one clip per man and only a few grenades left and no help in sight, McDoniel decided to abandon the position that night. When it got dark the survivors would split into small groups and try to get back to friendly lines. That evening after dark the North Koreans launched another weak attack against the position. At 22:00, McDoniel and Caldwell and 27 enlisted men slipped off the hill in groups of four. Master Sergeant Travis E. Watkins, still alive in his paralyzed condition, refused efforts of evacuation, saying {{that he did not want}} to be <b>a</b> <b>burden</b> <b>to</b> those who had a chance to get away. He asked only that his carbine be loaded and placed on his chest with the muzzle under his chin. Like Oullette, he would also win the Medal of Honor for his actions. Of the 29 men who came off the hill the night of September 4, 22 escaped to friendly lines, many of them following the Naktong downstream, hiding by day and traveling by night, until they reached the lines of the US 25th Infantry Division.|$|E

Illegal immigrants, more prevalent in the U.S. than in Canada, also add <b>a</b> <b>burden</b> <b>to</b> the system, as many of them do not carry health insurance and rely on emergency rooms— which are legally required to treat them under EMTALA— as a principal source of care.

Though the novel {{stresses the importance of}} love and understanding in marriage, Austen never seems to condemn Charlotte's decision to marry for money. She uses Charlotte to convey how women of her time would adhere to society's expectation for women to marry even if it is not out of love, but convenience. Charlotte is the daughter of Sir William Lucas and Lady Lucas, friends of Mrs. Bennet.|$|E

The Goldfeder financial empire had almost completely collapsed, and there was barely enough money to support the widowed Countess Stefania. Krystyna, not wishing to be <b>a</b> <b>burden</b> <b>to</b> her mother, worked at a Fiat car dealership, but soon became ill from automobile fumes and had to give up the job. At first she was thought, on the basis of shadows on her chest x-rays, to be suffering from tuberculosis, which had killed her father.

She began spending {{a great deal of time}} hiking and skiing the Tatra Mountains.|$|E
25|$|Twice a Florida High Speed Rail {{system was}} {{proposed}} to connect Miami with Orlando and Tampa.

Many were disappointed in Scott's vehement denial of the money. 26 Florida senators from both political parties signed a letter to United States Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood encouraging him to ignore Scott's decision, and even former governor Jeb Bush, who was against the previous high-speed rail proposal, was surprised by Scott's actions. The money was ultimately directed to other states and the plan killed.|$|E
