The fruit was used to make a rose-coloured dye. F. aurea was also used in traditional medicine in The Bahamas and Florida.

2500|$|Jeffrey Howard Archer {{was born}} in the City of London Maternity Hospital in Finsbury. He was two weeks old when his family moved to Somerset, {{eventually}} settling in the seaside town of Weston-super-Mare, where Archer spent most of his early life. [...] His father, William (died 1956), was 64 years old when Jeffrey Archer was born. Early in his career, Archer gave conflicting accounts to the press of his father's supposed, but non-existent, military career. William Archer was, in fact, a bigamist, fraudster and conman, who impersonated another William Archer, a deceased war medal holder. He was at different times employed as <b>a</b> <b>chewing</b> <b>gum</b> salesman in New York and a mortgage broker in London, in the latter capacity being charged at the Old Bailey for a series of fraud offences. On being allowed bail, he absconded to America under the name William Grimwood. As a boy Archer dreamt about being Bristol Rovers Football Club's captain, and still remains a fan of the club.|$|E
