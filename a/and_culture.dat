40|$|This article {{examines}} the alignment of learning <b>and</b> safety <b>culture</b> in organisations. It tests the hypothesis that factors that indicate a good learning culture might also signify good safety and vice versa. The hypothesis was tested through an intensive literature review. Areas of alignment of learning <b>culture</b> <b>and</b> safety <b>culture</b> were identified. Six components of learning <b>culture</b> <b>and</b> safety <b>culture</b> can be measured by the same instrument. These components form guiding principles for measurement of safety <b>culture</b> <b>and</b> learning <b>culture.</b> Another eight component areas were identified where learning <b>culture</b> <b>and</b> safety <b>culture</b> partially align. Four further components {{were found to be}} relevant to either safety culture or learning <b>culture</b> <b>and</b> do not align. Overall, there is a relationship between learning <b>culture</b> <b>and</b> safety <b>culture,</b> but gauging one does not provide a reliable measure of the other...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} aims to grasp {{whether there are}} {{differences}} in organizational culture types, in job satisfaction and organizational commitment, and in influences of organizational culture types on job satisfaction and organizational commitment between semiconductor industry and automobile industry. Further, this study intends to propose practical ways to combine the organizational cultures of the both industries with one another by recognizing their differences. First, organizational cultures were recognized in order of rational culture, group <b>culture,</b> development <b>culture</b> <b>and</b> hierarchical <b>culture</b> in semiconductor industry, and in order of rational culture, hierarchical <b>culture,</b> group <b>culture</b> <b>and</b> development <b>culture</b> in automobile industry. Like this, there were differences in the organizational culture types recognized between the both industries. Second, semiconductor industry was high in affective commitment and job satisfaction than automobile industry, but low in normative commitment than automobile industry. Third, job satisfaction was affected by group <b>culture</b> <b>and</b> rational <b>culture</b> in semiconductor industry <b>and</b> by hierarchical <b>culture,</b> group <b>culture</b> <b>and</b> development <b>culture</b> in automobile industry. Affective commitment was affected by group <b>culture</b> <b>and</b> rational <b>culture</b> in semiconductor industry <b>and</b> by development <b>culture</b> <b>and</b> rational <b>culture</b> in automobile industry. Normative commitment was affected by group culture in semiconductor industry <b>and</b> by development <b>culture</b> <b>and</b> rational <b>culture</b> in automobile industry...|$|R
