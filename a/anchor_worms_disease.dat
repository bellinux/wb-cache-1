40|$|The {{non-native}} parasitic <b>anchor</b> <b>worm</b> (Lernaea cyprinacea) {{may induce}} anaemia, malformations, reduced growth and increased susceptibility to secondary infection to its hosts. The objectives {{of this study}} were to (i) compile a list of the host species of L. cyprinacea in the Iberian Peninsula and (ii) assess if climate may impact on infestation levels of the parasite. There were two primary sources for data collection: (i) fish sampling in the Tormes Basin (Ávila, central Spain) during August 2010 and 2016 and (ii) data retrieved from publications containing relevant information about L. cyprinacea. Eleven temperature variables were obtained from Worldclim. Next, the relationship between infestation levels of the <b>anchor</b> <b>worm</b> (prevalence, intensity and abundance) and temperature was tested using mixed models. Fifteen cyprinids species among 18 species are host of L. cyprinacea in the Iberian Peninsula. Infestation levels of the <b>anchor</b> <b>worm</b> are highly connected to temperature. Finally, the possible implications of global warming for host–parasite interactions are discussed...|$|R

It is one the next diseases targeted for eradication by the World Health Organization. Guinea <b>worm</b> <b>disease</b> is transmitted by drinking water containing copepods (water fleas) that are infected with Dracunculiasis medinensis larvae. One year after human ingestion of infected water a female adult worm emerges, typically from a lower extremity, producing painful ulcers that can impair mobility for up to several weeks. This disease occurs annually when agricultural activities are at their peak. Large proportions of economically productive individuals of a village are usually affected simultaneously, resulting in decreased agricultural productivity and economic hardship. Eradication of guinea <b>worm</b> <b>disease</b> depends on prevention, as there is no effective treatment or vaccine. Since 1986, there has been a 98 % reduction in guinea <b>worm</b> <b>disease</b> worldwide, achieved primarily through community-based programs. These programs have educated local populations on how to filter drinking water to remove the parasite and how to prevent those with ulcers from infecting drinking-water sources. Complete eradication will require sustained high-level political, financial and community support...|$|R
