5|$|Eumenorrhea denotes normal, regular {{menstruation}} {{that lasts}} {{for a few}} days (usually 3 to 5 days, but anywhere from 2 to 7 days is considered normal). The average blood loss during menstruation is 35 milliliters with 10–80 ml considered normal. Women who experience Menorrhagia <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>susceptible</b> to iron deficiency than the average person. An enzyme called plasmin inhibits clotting in the menstrual fluid.|$|E
5|$|Steel {{cylinders}} <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>susceptible</b> than aluminium {{to external}} corrosion, particularly in seawater, {{and may be}} galvanized or coated with corrosion barrier paints to resist corrosion damage. It {{is not difficult to}} monitor external corrosion, and repair the paint when damaged, and steel cylinders which are well maintained have a long service life, often longer than aluminium cylinders, as they are not susceptible to fatigue damage when filled within their safe working pressure limits.|$|E

5|$|Like {{many other}} organisms, {{increasing}} ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation due to stratospheric ozone depletion {{and other factors}} may harm the DNA of amphibians, particularly their eggs. The amount of damage depends upon the life stage, the species type and other environmental parameters. Salamanders and frogs that produce less photolyase, an enzyme that counteracts DNA damage from UVB, <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>susceptible</b> {{to the effects of}} loss of the ozone layer. Exposure to ultraviolet radiation may not kill a particular species or life stage but may cause sublethal damage.|$|E
5|$|Most E. coli strains do {{not cause}} disease, but virulent strains can cause gastroenteritis, urinary tract infections, {{neonatal}} meningitis, hemorrhagic colitis, and Crohn's disease. Common {{signs and symptoms}} include severe abdominal cramps, diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis, vomiting, and sometimes fever. In rarer cases, virulent strains are also responsible for bowel necrosis (tissue death) and perforation without progressing to hemolytic-uremic syndrome, peritonitis, mastitis, septicemia, and Gram-negative pneumonia. Very young children <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>susceptible</b> to develop severe illness, such as hemolytic uremic syndrome, however, healthy individuals of all ages are at risk to the severe consequences that may arise {{as a result of}} being infected with E. coli.|$|E

40|$|Evaluation of abscesses {{appearing}} in {{male and female}} euthymic and athymic (nude) Balb/c mice after subcutaneous injection of Trichomonas vaginalis in the dorsal region showed that females <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>susceptible</b> than males. Female euthymic mice, however, <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>susceptible</b> than male athymic mice, and splenectomised athymic males <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>susceptible</b> than non-splenectomised athymic males. F 1 female athymic mice were the most susceptible, as their abscesses reached a peak size five days earlier than those of athymic homozygous females. F 1 male athymic mice, though slightly <b>more</b> <b>susceptible</b> than athymic homozygous males, did not develop abscesses that were similar in size. These results suggest that resistance or susceptibility to T vaginalis infection depends on {{the gender of the}} host and on thymus dependent cellular populations...|$|R
5|$|Porpoises {{are very}} {{sensitive}} to anthropogenic disturbances, and are keystone species, which can indicate the overall health of the marine environment. Populations of harbor porpoises in the North and Baltic Seas are under increasing pressure from anthropogenic causes such as offshore construction, ship traffic, fishing, and military exercises. Increasing pollution is a serious problem for marine mammals. Heavy metals and plastic waste are not biodegradable, and sometimes cetaceans consume these hazardous materials, mistaking them for food items. As a result, the animals <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>susceptible</b> to diseases and have fewer offspring. Harbour porpoises from the English Channel were found to have accumulated heavy metals.|$|E

5|$|Dysregulation of the {{ubiquitin}} proteasome {{system may}} contribute to several neural diseases. It may lead to brain tumors such as astrocytomas. In some of the late-onset neurodegenerative diseases that share aggregation of misfolded proteins as a common feature, such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, large insoluble aggregates of misfolded proteins can form and then result in neurotoxicity, through mechanisms that are not yet well understood. Decreased proteasome activity has been suggested {{as a cause of}} aggregation and Lewy body formation in Parkinson's. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that yeast models of Parkinson's <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>susceptible</b> to toxicity from α-synuclein, the major protein component of Lewy bodies, under conditions of low proteasome activity. Impaired proteasomal activity may underlie cognitive disorders such as the autism spectrum disorders, and muscle and nerve diseases such as inclusion body myopathy.|$|E

5|$|Endotracheal {{intubation}} {{and mechanical}} ventilation {{may be used}} to ensure proper oxygen supply and provide a secure airway. Hypotension (low blood pressure), which has a devastating outcome in TBI, can be prevented by giving intravenous fluids to maintain a normal blood pressure. Failing to maintain blood pressure can result in inadequate blood flow to the brain. Blood pressure may be kept at an artificially high level under controlled conditions by infusion of norepinephrine or similar drugs; this helps maintain cerebral perfusion. Body temperature is carefully regulated because increased temperature raises the brain's metabolic needs, potentially depriving it of nutrients. Seizures are common. While they can be treated with benzodiazepines, these drugs are used carefully because they can depress breathing and lower blood pressure. TBI patients <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>susceptible</b> to side effects and may react adversely or be inordinately sensitive to some pharmacological agents. During treatment monitoring continues for signs of deterioration such as a decreasing level of consciousness.|$|E
5|$|She {{explains}} the neurological basis for reasoning and cognition in the brain, and brings the point across that the self itself is changeable. She describes the physiology behind neurological pathways which include webs of neurons containing dendrites, axons, and synapses; and explains that certain brains with more rigid pathways {{will be less}} susceptible to new information or creative stimuli. Taylor utilizes neurological science to show that brainwashed individuals have more rigid pathways, and that rigidity can make it unlikely that the individual will rethink situations or be able to later reorganize these pathways. She explains that repetition {{is an integral part}} of brainwashing techniques because connections between neurons become stronger when exposed to incoming signals of frequency and intensity. She argues that people in their teenage years and early twenties <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>susceptible</b> to persuasion. Taylor explains that brain activity in the temporal lobe, the region responsible for artistic creativity, also causes spiritual experiences in a process known as lability.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary risk}} factor for COPD {{globally}} is tobacco smoking. Of those who smoke about 20% will get COPD, and {{of those who are}} lifelong smokers about half will get COPD. In the United States and United Kingdom, of those with COPD, 80–95% are either current smokers or previously smoked. The likelihood of developing COPD increases with the total smoke exposure. Additionally, women <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>susceptible</b> to the harmful effects of smoke than men. In non-smokers, secondhand smoke is the cause of about 20% of cases. Other types of smoke, such as, marijuana, cigar, and water pipe smoke, also confer a risk. Water pipe smoke appears to be as harmful as smoking cigarettes. Problems from marijuana smoke may only be with heavy use. Women who smoke during pregnancy may increase the risk of COPD in their child. For the same amount of cigarette smoking, women have a higher risk of COPD than men.|$|E

5|$|Two life-history {{features}} of amphibians are {{often cited as}} a reason why amphibians are good indicators of environmental health or 'canaries in the coal mine'. Like all amphibians, the long-toed salamander has both an aquatic and terrestrial life transition and semipermeable skin. Since they serve different ecological functions in the water {{than they do in}} land, the loss of one amphibian species is equivalent to the loss of two ecological species. The second notion is that amphibians, such as long-toed salamanders, <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>susceptible</b> to the absorption of pollutants because they naturally absorb water and oxygen through their skin. The validity of this special sensitivity to environmental pollutants, however, has been called into question. The problem is more complex, because not all amphibians are equally susceptible to environmental damage because there is such a diverse array of life histories among species.|$|E
5|$|Damage to {{buildings}} and structures can range from complete or partial roof collapse to less catastrophic damage of exterior and internal materials. Impacts depend on the thickness of ash, whether it is wet or dry, the roof and building design and how much ash gets inside a building. The specific weight of ash can vary significantly and rain can increase this by 50-100%. Problems associated with ash loading are {{similar to that of}} snow; however, ash is more severe as 1) the load from ash is generally much greater, 2) ash does not melt and 3) ash can clog and damage gutters, especially after rain fall. Impacts for ash loading depend on building design and construction, including roof slope, construction materials, roof span and support system, and age and maintenance of the building. Generally flat roofs <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>susceptible</b> to damage and collapse than steeply pitched roofs. Roofs made of smooth materials (sheet metal or glass) are more likely to shed ash than roofs made with rough materials (thatch, asphalt or wood shingles). Roof collapse can lead to widespread injuries and deaths and property damage. For example, the collapse of roofs from ash during the 15 June 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption killed about 300 people.|$|E
