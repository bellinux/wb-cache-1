500|$|First Lady Barbara Bush paraphrased {{the film}} in her 1990 {{commencement}} address at Wellesley College: [...] "Find the joy in life, because as Ferris Bueller said on his day off, 'Life moves pretty fast; if you don't stop <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>around</b> once in a while, you could miss it!'" [...] Responding to the audience's enthusiastic applause, she added [...] "I'm {{not going to tell}} George ya clapped more for Ferris than ya clapped for George." ...|$|E
500|$|Animals {{that live}} in groups often give alarm calls that give warning of an attack. For example, vervet monkeys give {{different}} calls depending {{on the nature of}} the attack: for an eagle, a disyllabic cough; for a leopard or other cat, a loud bark; for a python or other snake, a [...] "chutter". The monkeys hearing these calls respond defensively, but differently in each case: to the eagle call, they look up and run into cover; to the leopard call, they run up into the trees; to the snake call, they stand on two legs <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>around</b> for snakes, and on seeing the snake, they sometimes mob it. Similar calls are found in other species of monkey, while birds also give different calls that elicit different responses.|$|E
500|$|In August 1876, Disraeli was {{elevated}} to the House of Lords as Earl of Beaconsfield and Viscount Hughenden. [...] The Queen {{had offered to}} ennoble him as early as 1868; he had then declined. [...] She did so again in 1874, when he fell ill at Balmoral, but {{he was reluctant to}} leave the Commons for a house in which he had no experience. [...] Continued ill health during his second premiership caused him to contemplate resignation, but his lieutenant, Derby, was unwilling, feeling that he could not manage the Queen. [...] For Disraeli, the Lords, where the debate was less intense, was the alternative to resignation from office. [...] Five days {{before the end of the}} 1876 session of Parliament, on 11 August, Disraeli was seen to linger <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>around</b> the chamber before departing the Commons. [...] Newspapers reported his ennoblement the following morning.|$|E

500|$|Pratchett married Lyn Purves at the Congregational Church, Gerrards Cross, on 5 October 1968, {{and they}} moved to Rowberrow, Somerset, in 1970. Their {{daughter}} Rhianna Pratchett, {{who is also a}} writer, was born there in 1976. In 1993, the family moved to Broad Chalke, a village west of Salisbury, Wiltshire. He listed his recreations as [...] "writing, walking, computers, life". He described himself as a humanist and was a Distinguished Supporter of Humanists UK (formerly known as the British Humanist Association) and an Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society. He was the patron of the Friends of High Wycombe Library. In 2013 he gave a talk at Beaconsfield Library which he had visited as a child and donated the income from the event to it. On a number of occasions he also visited his former school to speak to the students <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>around.</b>|$|E
500|$|Ferris returns Sloane {{home and}} realizes {{his parents are}} due home soon. As he races on foot through the neighborhood, he is nearly hit by Jeannie driving their mother home. She speeds off trying to beat Ferris home. Ferris makes it home first, to find Rooney waiting for him outside. Jeannie races into the house as their mother talks to their father about her {{behavior}} today. Jeannie discovers Rooney threatening Ferris, and has a change of heart; she tells {{him that she was}} just helping to return Ferris from the hospital, and shows Rooney his wallet that she had found from his earlier break-in attempts. Rooney flees while Ferris thanks Jeannie and rushes back to his bedroom to greet his parents while feigning his waning illness. As they leave, Ferris reminds the audience, [...] "Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>around</b> once in a while, you could miss it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The first novelty stores, which {{carried a}} wide variety of goods, {{appeared}} in the late 1840s. They had larger, glass windows, made possible by the new use of cast iron in architecture. Customers were welcome to walk in <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>around,</b> and prices were posted on every item. These shops were relatively small, and catered only to a single area, since it was difficult for Parisians to get easily across the city through the narrow streets.|$|E

2500|$|It is a {{difficult}} and dangerous thing in a democracy to prevent {{a substantial part of}} the population from doing things they do not regard as wrong. ... The freedom with which a person can walk about <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>around</b> is a very useful guide to the civilized quality of an urban area ... judged against this standard, many of our towns now seem to leave a great deal to be desired ... there must be areas of good environment where people can live, work, shop, look about and move around on foot in reasonable freedom from the hazards of motor traffic.|$|E
2500|$|The open, {{non-linear}} environment allows {{players to}} explore and choose how they wish to play the game. Although storyline missions are necessary to progress through the game and unlock certain cities and content, they are not required as players can complete them at their own leisure. When not taking on a storyline mission, players can free-roam <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>around</b> the cities of San Andreas, eat in restaurants, or cause havoc by attacking people and causing destruction. Creating havoc can attract unwanted and potentially fatal attention from the authorities. The more chaos caused, the stronger the response: police will handle [...] "minor" [...] infractions (attacking pedestrians, pointing guns at people, stealing vehicles, manslaughter, etc.), whereas SWAT teams, the FBI, and the military respond to higher wanted levels.|$|E
2500|$|He {{said his}} prayer was {{interrupted}} by a [...] "being from the unseen world". Smith said the being caused his tongue to swell in his mouth so that he could not speak. One account said he heard a noise behind him like someone walking towards him and then, when he tried to pray again, the noise grew louder, causing him to spring to his feet <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>around,</b> but he saw no one. In some of the accounts, he described being covered with a thick darkness and thinking that he would be destroyed. At his darkest moment, he knelt a third time to pray and, as he summoned all his power to pray, he felt ready to sink into oblivion. At that moment, he said his tongue was loosed and he saw a vision.|$|E

2500|$|In November 1965, {{an article}} was {{published}} involving an antique oak rocking chair {{said to have}} been previously owned by attorney Charlie Willett, a Bell descendant. The rocking chair was recently sold in an estate sale to Mrs. J. C. Adams, owner of an antique store on U.S. 41. A customer sat down in the chair, after learning it was not for sale, and while rocking in the chair asked Mrs. Adams if she believed in the supernatural. Two weeks later, the customer's daughter visited the home of Mrs. Adams and said after her mother had left and visited the Bell cemetery a voice told her to [...] "stand up <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>around,</b> you will find something of much value." [...] After some car trouble, the woman walked out into a field and found a black iron kettle turned over. She turned the kettle over and found a pearl buckle in the grass. The woman's daughter reported a jeweler estimated the buckle to be 160 to 200 years old.|$|E
2500|$|On {{his next}} single, [...] "The Fightin' Side of Me," [...] {{released}} by his record company in 1970 over Haggard's objections, Haggard's lyrics {{stated that he}} did not mind the counterculture [...] "switchin' sides and standin' up for what they believe in," [...] but resolutely declared, [...] "If you don't love it, leave it!" [...] In May 1970, Haggard explained to John Grissom of Rolling Stone, [...] "I don't like their views on life, their filth, their visible self-disrespect, y'know. They don't give a shit what they look like or what they smell like.... What do they have to offer humanity?" [...] In a 2003 interview with No Depression magazine, Haggard said, [...] "I had different views in the '70s. As a human being, I've learned [...] I have more culture now. I was dumb as a rock when I wrote 'Okie From Muskogee.' That's being honest with you at the moment, and {{a lot of things that}} I said [...] I sing with a different intention now. My views on marijuana have totally changed. I think we were brainwashed and I think anybody that doesn't know that needs to get up and read <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>around,</b> get their own information. It's a cooperative government project to make us think marijuana should be outlawed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although Tormented {{received}} {{very little}} critical attention, reviews were positive, with critics finding fault in the album's production but praising its heaviness and aggression. AllMusic gave the album {{a very positive}} review, writing: [...] " [...] shows a band with its alternative metal heart {{in the right place}} [...] Despite some spotty production, this impressive debut unleashes a band whose amps are overloaded, and whose aim is deadly. The original version of [...] "Mudshuvel" [...] (which later appeared on Dysfunction) is one of several highlights." [...] In 1997, Steven Woltasek of CMJ New Music Report wrote: [...] "For those of you that don't know, wake up <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>around</b> for the debut release from Staind entitled [...] In the book Brave Nu World, author Tommy Udo wrote: [...] "To go back now and listen to Staind's 1996 debut, Tormented, back to back with Break The Cycle is like listening to another band". Scott Hefflon of the Lollipop wrote: [...] "Staind are savvy, street-smart, and dammit, they rock. Their studio debut, tOrmenteD, shows either a natural knack for milking the most out of a crunchy guitar, or they had some good coaching." [...] The Northeast Performer wrote: [...] "Staind's musicianship is striking, and their live performance takes their recorded material one step further: pushing the envelope, ripping up the envelope, then jumping up and down all over the envelope til there ain't a damn thing left".|$|E
