40|$|The {{mechanism}} of biocontrol agent Saccharothrix yanglingensis Hhs. 015 action against Valsa mali, a major <b>apple</b> Valsa <b>canker</b> pathogen, was examined using a novel, sensitive (minimum detection limit 100 pg/μL) and reliably RT-qPCR technique. Prior to lesion formation, total concentration of V. mali in the bark {{showed a significant}} decrease (p< 0. 05) after 24 h of Hhs. 015 treatment. This was more pronounced at 48 and 96 h post treatment. After lesion formation, levels of V. mali remained constant at the boundary between infected and uninfected bark tissues, although the relative expansion rate of the lesion was significantly reduced (p< 0. 05). Gene expression levels of endo-polygalacturonase, a marker for fungal pathogenicity, were sharply reduced while host induced resistance callose synthase levels increased significantly (p< 0. 05) at the boundary bark at 9 d after Hhs. 015 treatment. The results showed that biocontrol agent Hhs. 015 prevented infection of V. mali by inhibiting pathogen growth, down-regulating pathogenicity factor expression and inducing {{a high level of}} host resistance...|$|R
40|$|The <b>apple</b> <b>canker</b> disease (aka European canker), {{which is}} caused by the fungus Neonectria distissima, infects apple trees and can cause severe damage on both the fruit and the tree itself. For some time it has been assumed that apple trees may be {{infected}} as early as the planting stage. There is, however, no previous documentation on rootstock infection. If rootstocks can get infected, how does this happens and what is the entry point for the infection? This project has investigated the issue by means of testing different kinds of rootstocks and different methods of inoculation. The different methods used were inoculation by pricking the rootstock with needles containing inoculum, spraying the rootstocks with a spore suspension and dripping spore suspension in the wound made after cutting off the top shoot of the rootstock. Inoculation occurred at different dates, and the rootstocks received different treatments of pinching and topping. The experiments showed that all rootstocks may become infected by <b>apple</b> <b>canker,</b> although there was a difference in how effective the different methods of inoculation were. The rootstocks which were inoculated by needles containing inoculum had a high probability of developing infections and showed symptoms of infection after four weeks. Needles with inoculum inserted into the shoots provoked earlier symptoms than those inserted into the stem. Inoculation by spraying the rootstocks with a spore suspension developed very little infection, and did not show symptoms until eleven weeks after inoculation. Results also showed that, the rootstocks were most prone to develop infections if they were pinched the same day as they were sprayed with spore suspension. Rootstocks pinched one or three days before being sprayed with spore suspension developed fewer infections. All rootstocks tested, M 9, B 9, M 26 and MM 106, developed infections of <b>apple</b> <b>canker,</b> and {{there was no difference in}} susceptibility. When wounds were made in the rootstock, either by pricking with a needle or by cutting the top off, the infection levels after inoculation were high. If the wounds were made by pinching off the shoots, however, the probability of infection was low. Wounds in younger tissue were more susceptible for infection than wounds in older tissue. The results show that to reduce the risk of infection of <b>apple</b> <b>canker,</b> it is important to be considerate while handling rootstocks to avoid damages. When pinching, topping and grafting one should take precautions to avoid <b>apple</b> <b>canker</b> and be aware of potential sources of inoculum in the near vicinity. M-P...|$|E

40|$|Bacillus subtilis strain EDR 4 is a {{potential}} biocontrol agent against Valsa mali (Vm), the fungus causing <b>apple</b> <b>canker</b> disease. In this study, we identified and characterized the antifungal peptide produced by B. subtilis EDR 4. Peptides were isolated by 30 % ammonium sulfate precipitation and purified by column chromatography. A 4 -kDa peptide exhibiting antifungal activity was obtained and designated as P 6. The amino acid sequence of P 6 was determined by liquid chromatography combined with tandem mass spectrometry. P 6 showed inhibitory effects against eight different pathogenic plant fungi, and was stable (i. e., retained its biological activity) at temperatures as high as 121 °C for 20 min and at pH values ranging from 3 to 11. Microscopic examination of Vm hyphae treated with P 6 showed protoplasm release, and in vitrospore germination was also inhibited. These results suggest that P 6 is the active substance responsible for the antifungal activity of B. subtilisEDR 4 against Vmand that P 6 may be effective in the biocontrol of Vmas well as other plant pathogenic fungi...|$|E
50|$|Chemical control Fungicides {{that may}} be used to {{effectively}} control N. galligena are limited. Infection by N. galligena often occurs through wounds in the autumn and spring-summer period, therefore, it is recommended that fungicides be applied at these times. The application of fungicides will prevent or decrease the sporulation of existing cankers, which in turn decreases the inoculum available to spread the pathogen. Fungicides may also protect trees from N. galligena through a fungitoxic deposit over favorable infection sites. A mixture of carbendazim and a scab fungicide, such as dithianon, is the suggested treatment in areas with a severe canker problem. In areas with a reduced risk of canker, it is recommended that a scab fungicide be applied in the spring-summer and copper oxychloride applied at leaf-fall to avoid infection. Although scab fungicides are commonly used for managing <b>apple</b> scab, <b>cankers</b> are also controlled when applied at the correct time. Thiophanate-methyl is another fungicide that is highly effective because it protects trees against the pathogen and suppresses sporulation of already infected plants. However, the application of thiophanate-methyl is limited due to its harm on organisms such as mites.|$|R
40|$|Valsa mali var. mali (Vmm), {{the causal}} agent of <b>apple</b> tree <b>canker</b> disease, {{produces}} various toxic compounds, including protocatechuic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, p-hydroxyacetophenone, 3 -(p-hydroxyphenyl) propanoic acid and phloroglucinol. Here, {{we examined the}} relationship between toxin production and the pathogenicity of Vmm strains and determined their bioactivities in several assays, for further elucidating the pathogenesis mechanisms of Vmm and for developing new procedures to control this disease. The toxins were quantified with the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method, and the results showed that the strain with attenuated virulence produced low levels of toxins with only three to four kinds of compounds being detectable. In contrast, higher amounts of toxins were produced by the more aggressive strain, and all five compounds were detected. This indicated a significant correlation between the pathogenicity of Vmm strains and their ability to produce toxins. However, this correlation only existed in planta, but not in vitro. During the infection of Vmm, protocatechuic acid was first detected at three days post inoculation (dpi), and the others at seven or 11 dpi. In addition, all compounds produced noticeable symptoms on host plants at concentrations of 2. 5 to 40 mmol/L, with protocatechuic acid being the most effective compound, whereas 3 -(p-hydroxyphenyl) propanoic acid or p-hydroxybenzoic acid were the most active compounds on non-host plants...|$|R
40|$|In fungi, heterotrimeric guanine-nucleotide binding {{proteins}} (G-proteins) are {{key elements}} of signal transduction pathways, which control growth, asexual and sexual development, as well as virulence. In this study, we have identified two genes encoding heterotrimeric G protein alpha subunits, named Gvm 2 and Gvm 3, from Valsa mali, the causal agent of <b>apple</b> Valsa <b>canker.</b> Characterization of Gvm 2 and Gvm 3 mutants indicates that Gvm 3 may be a crucial regulator of vegetative growth. Deletion of the corresponding gene results in a 20 % reduction in growth rate. Besides, Gvm 2 and Gvm 3 seem {{to be involved in}} asexual reproduction, and mutants are hypersensitive to oxidative and cell membrane stresses. Interestingly, both G protein alpha subunits were most probably involved in V. mali virulence. In infection assays using Malus domestica cv. 'Fuji' leaves and twigs, the size of lesions caused by deletion mutants △Gvm 2, or △Gvm 3 are significantly reduced. Furthermore, many genes encoding hydrolytic enzymes-important virulence factors in V. mali-are expressed at a lower level in these deletion mutants. Our results suggest that Gvm 2 and Gvm 3 {{play an important role in}} virulence probably by regulation of expression of cell wall degrading enzymes. △Gvm 2, and △Gvm 3 mutants were further analyzed with respect to their impact on the transcript levels of genes in the cAMP/PKA pathway. The expression of the genes encoding adenylate cyclase VmAC, protein kinase A (PKA) regulatory subunit VmPKR, and PKA catalytic subunit VmPKA 1 are down-regulated in both mutants. Further analyses indicated that intracellular cAMP level and PKA activity are down-regulated in the △Gvm 3 mutant, but are basically unchanged in the △Gvm 2 mutant. Overall, our findings indicate that both Gvm 2 and Gvm 3 play diverse roles in the modulation of vegetative growth, asexual development, and virulence in V. mali...|$|R

40|$|<b>Apple</b> <b>canker</b> {{caused by}} the phytopathogenic fungus Neonectria ditissima is an {{economically}} important disease, which has spread {{in recent years to}} almost all pome-producing regions of the world. N. ditissima is able to cross-infect a wide range of apple varieties and causes branch and trunk lesions, known as cankers. Most modern apple varieties are susceptible and in extreme cases suffer from high mortality (up to 50 %) in the early phase of orchard establishment. There is no known race structure of the pathogen and the global level of genetic diversity of the pathogen population is unknown. Resistance breeding is underway in many global breeding programmes, but nevertheless, a total resistance to canker has not yet been demonstrated. Here we present preliminary data from a survey of the phylogenetic relationships between global isolates of N. ditissima which reveals only slight evidence for population structure. In addition we report the results of four rapid screening tests to assess the response to N. ditissima in different apple scion and rootstock varieties, which reveals abundant variation in resistance responses in both cultivar and rootstock material. Further seedling tests show that the segregation patterns of resistance and susceptibility vary widely between crosses. We discuss inconsistencies in test performance with field observations and discuss future research opportunities in this area...|$|E

30|$|Apple {{proliferation}} symptoms {{have also}} been frequently observed {{in the last decade}} in apple orchards in Asturias, in the North coast of Spain. This region has long tradition in cider-making, and most of the 10, 000  ha of apple orchards are cultivated almost exclusively to produce cider-apples. The majority of the surface devoted to apple production is occupied by traditional extensive orchards with big trees grown on seedling rootstocks. Since the early 1990 s, an increasing percentage of these old orchards have been substituted by new semi-intensive ones with trees growing on semi-dwarfing rootstocks (Dapena et al. 2005). Those orchards are planted with selected local cultivars tolerant to several common <b>apple</b> diseases (scab, <b>canker,</b> powdery mildew). The use of pesticide in both situations is very low, even null. Sprays are mainly made with narrow-spectrum insecticides against the codling moth (Cydia pomonella L.) or the rosy apple aphid (Dysaphis plantaginea Passerini). Such situation of low pressure of pesticide use potentially allows high abundance and diversity of insects in orchards (Miñarro et al. 2005, 2009). The immersion of those orchards in an agricultural landscape characterized by a mosaic of small and different-land-use plots separated by hedgerows, as well as the occurrence of a permanent rich floral groundcover, also favour insect abundance and richness (Miñarro and Prida 2013; Rosa García and Miñarro 2014).|$|R
40|$|Valsa mali (V. mali) is the causative {{agent of}} <b>apple</b> tree Valsa <b>canker,</b> which heavily damages the {{production}} of apples in China. However, the biological roles of the RNA interfering (RNAi) pathway in the pathogenicity of V. mali remain unknown. Dicer-like proteins (DCLs) are important components that control the initiation of the RNAi pathway. In this study, VmDCL 1 and VmDCL 2 were isolated and functionally characterized in V. mali. VmDCL 1 and VmDCL 2 are orthologous in evolution to the DCLs in Cryphonectria parasitica. The deletion of VmDCL 1 and VmDCL 2 did not affect vegetative growth when the mutants (ΔVmDCL 1, ΔVmDCL 2 and ΔVmDCL 1 DCL 2) and wild type strain 03 – 8 were grown on a PDA medium at 25 °C in the dark. However, the colony of ΔVmDCL 1 increased by 37. 1 % compared to the 03 – 8 colony in a medium containing 0. 05 % H 2 O 2 3 days after inoculation, {{and the growth of}} ΔVmDCL 1 was significantly inhibited in a medium containing 0. 5 M KCl at a ratio of 25. 7 %. Meanwhile, in the presence of 0. 05 % H 2 O 2, the growth of ΔVmDCL 2 decreased by 34. 5 % compared with the growth of 03 – 8, but ΔVmDCL 2 grew normally in the presence of 0. 5 M KCl. More importantly, the expression of VmDCL 2 was up-regulated 125 -fold during the pathogen infection. In the infection assays using apple twigs, the pathogenicity of ΔVmDCL 2 and ΔVmDCL 1 DCL 2 was significantly reduced compared with that of 03 – 8 at a ratio of 24. 7 and 41. 3 %, respectively. All defective phenotypes could be nearly rescued by re-introducing the wild type VmDCL 1 and VmDCL 2 alleles. Furthermore, the number and length distribution of unique small RNAs (unisRNAs) in the mutants and 03 – 8 were analyzed using deep sequencing. The number of unisRNAs was obviously lower in ΔVmDCL 1, ΔVmDCL 2 and ΔVmDCL 1 DCL 2 than that in 03 – 8, and the length distribution of the sRNAs also markedly changed after the VmDCLs were deleted.

40|$|ABSTRACT: European <b>apple</b> <b>canker</b> (EC) {{is caused}} by Neonectria ditissima, a {{pathogen}} officially registered as a quarantine pest in 2012. Thirty-five isolates of N. ditissima of different geographical regions of southern Brazil from apple branches showing symptoms of EC were identified by the specific pair primers Ch 1 and Ch 2 and analyzed concerning the virulence on Gala apple cultivar and morphophysiological characteristics. The disease symptoms were characterized and the isolates compared based on average mycelium growth (AMG), mycelium growth index (MGI), colony color, conidia type, dimensions and growth on potato dextrose agar (PDA), malt agar (AM), and synthetic SNAY (SN) culture media. Nineteen isolates showed the greatest AMG on PDA, forming three growth groups of 35. 56 (GI), 52. 71 (GII), and 62. 67 mm (GIII). Seven isolates showed MGI greater than 4. 0 mm diameter on PDA compared with that on AM and SN. The highest conidia production was on SN, and the predominant colony color in all media was white to beige with central pigmentation of brown and borders colored in shades of beige. There were significant differences among the average dimensions of micro- and macroconidia on PDA, AM, and SN. The pathogenicity was confirmed for all isolates despite of different morphophysiological characteristics. There was no correlation among isolates morphophysiological variability, virulence, and geographical origin...|$|E
40|$|Sexual {{reproduction}} in filamentous ascomycetes {{is controlled}} by the mating type (MAT) locus, including two idiomorphs MAT 1 - 1 and MAT 1 - 2. Understanding the MAT locus can provide clues for unveiling the sexual development and virulence factors for fungal pathogens. The genus Valsa (Sordariomycetes, Diaporthales) contains many tree pathogens responsible for destructive canker diseases. The sexual stage of these ascomycetes is occasionally observed in nature, and no MAT locus has been reported to date. Here, we identified the MAT locus of the <b>apple</b> <b>canker</b> pathogen Valsa mali, which causes extensive damage, and even death, to trees. V. mali is heterothallic in that each isolate carries either the MAT 1 - 1 or MAT 1 - 2 idiomorph. However, the MAT structure is distinct from that of many other heterothallic fungi in the Sordariomycetes. Two flanking genes, COX 13 and APN 2, were coopted into the MAT locus, possibly by intrachromosomal rearrangement. After the acquisition of foreign genes, unequal recombination occurred between MAT 1 - 1 / 2 idiomorphs, resulting in a reverse insertion in the MAT 1 - 2 idiomorph. Evolutionary analysis showed that the three complete MAT 1 - 1 - 2, COX 13, and APN 2 genes in this region diverged independently due to different selection pressure. Null hypothesis tests of a 1 : 1 MAT ratio of 86 V. mali isolates from four different provinces showed a relatively balanced distribution of the two idiomorphs in the fields. These results provide insights into the evolution of the mating systems in Sordariomycetes...|$|E
40|$|Neonectria ditissima (formerly Neonectria galligena, anamorph Cylindrocarpon heteronema) is {{the causal}} agent of fruit tree canker, which is {{regarded}} as a serious economic problem in apple production. This fungus is closely associated with mild and wet conditions, and climate therefore has an important impact on its geographic distribution. Notable damage to apple trees is especially common in, e. g., North-Western Europe. Complete resistance has not yet been reported. In addition, no major genes have as yet been identified and resistance appears to be controlled mainly by additive gene action. Apple cultivars varied significantly in level of partial resistance towards <b>apple</b> <b>canker</b> after artificial inoculation of detached shoots and/or potted trees with macroconidia of N. ditissima. The inter-specific crabapple hybrid ‘Prairifire’ showed the least damage, indicating that valuable sources of resistance can be found in Malus species. Neonectria ditissima could be detected in artificially infected apple trees using a species-specific β-tubulin gene-based qPCR assay two months after inoculation. When quantified in different cultivars, a positive relationship between N. ditissima biomass and the size of canker-induced lesions was found. Interaction between plant and pathogen was studied using light microscopy of apple woody tissue; fungal hyphae were found in all cell types, and gel formation was observed in both a susceptible and a resistant cultivar but infection appears to progress more rapidly in the susceptible cultivar. Genetic variation among different N. ditissima isolates was investigated using SSR and AFLP markers. Comparatively low levels of genetic differentiation among orchards indicate that gene flow is prominent. Analyses of single-ascospore isolates from the same perithecia suggest that this fungus is heterothallic and therefore outcrossing. Furthermore, a focused genomics approach was applied in order to identify differentially expressed genes in response to fungal attack on apple trees. Obtained data indicate that apple cultivars inoculated with N. ditissima exhibit significant upregulation of defence-related genes and genes involved in detoxification, peroxidase-related reactions, phenylpropanoid metabolism and the lignification process...|$|E
