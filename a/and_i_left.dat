5|$|Leah Greenblatt from Entertainment Weekly ranked these couplets {{from the}} song; ("Your guard {{is up and}} I know why, because {{the last time you}} saw me is still burned in the back of your mind / You gave me roses <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> them there to die"), at number two out of ten best couplets from Speak Now sheet.|$|E
500|$|The song's {{narrative}} is in first person, and depicts Swift apologizing {{to a young}} man whose heart she broke. Mandi Bierly from Entertainment Weekly describes the song as [...] "a melancholy mea culpa with the kind of driving chorus and age-appropriate yet universal honesty", adding that [...] "in the tune [...] she says she’s sorry for the last time he saw her ('You gave me roses, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> them there to die') and that she wishes she realized what she had ('I’d go back to December, turn around, and change my own mind/I go back to December all the time').|$|E
500|$|The main cast was put {{together}} {{through a process of}} auditions and readings. Actors often did not know whether Chase liked their performances or not. Michael Imperioli, who beat out several actors for the part of Christopher Moltisanti, recalls [...] "He's got a poker face, so I thought he wasn't into me, and he kept giving me notes and having me try it again, which often is a sign that you're not doing it right. I thought, I'm not getting this. So he said, 'Thank you,' <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>left.</b> I didn't expect to hear back. And then they called." [...] Chase also said he wanted Imperioli because he had been in Goodfellas. James Gandolfini was invited to audition for the part of Tony Soprano after casting director Susan Fitzgerald saw a short clip of his performance in the 1993 film True Romance. Lorraine Bracco, who had played the role of mob wife Karen Hill in Goodfellas, was originally asked {{to play the role of}} Carmela Soprano. She took the role of Dr. Jennifer Melfi instead because she wanted to try something different and felt the part of the highly educated Dr. Melfi would be more of a challenge for her. Tony Sirico, who has a criminal background, signed on to play Paulie Walnuts as long as his character was not to be a [...] "rat".|$|E

2500|$|Much later, Morley would comment [...] "When Trevor <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>left,</b> (Jeczalik, Langan and Dudley) {{became a}} novelty group who had hits with Tom Jones." [...] His {{disdain for the}} artistic {{direction}} of The Art of Noise once {{he was no longer}} involved with it was even more evident in other articles he penned, including the liner notes of the 1986 compilation album Daft (under the name Otto Flake) and a September 2002 article for The Observer.|$|E
2500|$|In 2003 Paul Kosky and {{the band}} had an [...] "acrimonious" [...] split; which [...] "almost spelt the end" [...] for the band. According to Mathieson [...] "the band were {{starting}} to bristle at the extent of Kosky's involvement {{in every aspect of}} their stalled career." [...] Kosky felt he was a scapegoat for problems with the second album including its poorer commercial performance: [...] "Everyone was looking for a fall guy. It happened to be me <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> gracefully. I put my life into it for five years and I gambled a lot. Like any relationship, you find a time when you move on." [...] Chris Robinson bought out Kosky's share of their partnership in Wah Wah Music and became the band's new manager.|$|E

2500|$|By now my {{dysentery}} was so violent I was draining blood. Every {{one of the}} men {{was sick}} from one cause or another. My shoulders were worn raw from the pack straps, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> the pack behind... The boys with me weren't in much better shape... A scout moving ahead suddenly held his rifle high in the air. That meant Enemy sighted... Then at last we saw them, coming down the railroad four abreast... The gunner crouched low over his tommy-gun and tightened down. Then the gun spoke. Down flopped a half-dozen Japs, then another half dozen. The [...] column spewed from their marching formation into the bush. We grabbed up the gun and slid back into the jungle. Sometimes staggering, sometimes running, sometimes dragging, I made it back to camp. I was so sick I didn't care whether the Japs broke through or not; so sick I didn't worry any more about letting the colonel down. All I wanted was unconsciousness.|$|E
2500|$|The austere {{beauty of}} Euclidean {{geometry}} {{has been seen}} by many in western culture as a glimpse of an otherworldly system of perfection and certainty. Abraham Lincoln kept a copy of Euclid in his saddlebag, and studied it late at night by lamplight; he related that he said to himself, [...] "You never can make a lawyer {{if you do not}} understand what demonstrate means; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> my situation in Springfield, went home to my father's house, and stayed there till I could give any proposition in the six books of Euclid at sight". Edna St. Vincent Millay wrote in her sonnet [...] "", [...] "O blinding hour, O holy, terrible day, When first the shaft into his vision shone Of light anatomized!". Einstein recalled a copy of the Elements and a magnetic compass as two gifts that had a great influence on him as a boy, referring to the Euclid as the [...] "holy little geometry book".|$|E
2500|$|... "Crazy Horse <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> {{the crowd}} and rode down along the river. We came to a ravine, then we {{followed}} up the gulch to {{a place in the}} rear of the soldiers that were making the stand on the hill. Crazy Horse gave his horse to me to hold along with my horse. He crawled up the ravine to see where he could see the soldiers. He shot them as fast as he could load his gun. They fell off their horses as fast as he could shoot." [...] When they found they were being killed so fast, the ones that were left broke and ran as fast as their horses could go to some other soldiers that were further along the ridge toward Custer. Here they tried to make another stand and fired some shots, but we rushed them along the ridge where Custer was. Then they made another stand (the third) and rallied a few minutes. Then they went along the ridge and got with Custer’s men." ...|$|E
