40|$|A {{face seal}} {{assembly}} is provided having an annular seal body mounted in an <b>axially</b> <b>moveable</b> relationship to a seal support structure. A piston ring is disposed between the annular seal {{body and the}} seal support structure forming a secondary seal. A first locator spring, which is an annular wave spring, is disposed between said seal support structure and the piston ring to urge the piston ring in an axial direction. Optionally, a second locator spring, also a wave spring, may be disposed between the piston ring and the seal support structure for urging the piston ring in a radial direction...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{this study}} the {{indirect}} extrusion of seamless aluminum tubes with variable wall thickness was investigated. Therefore, an <b>axially</b> <b>moveable</b> stepped mandrel was applied. Investigations revealed that wall thickness transitions {{can either be}} graded over the tube length or very sharp. The microstructures in thin-walled and thick-walled tube sections were investigated. The local variation of the extrusion ratio and with that the tube wall thickness, product velocity and product temperature during the process lead to significantly different local microstructures at TB= 400 °C. At TB= 500 °C the microstructure was homogeneously recrystallized with similar grain size in all different tube sections. Furthermore, the mechanical tube properties were characterized by three point bending tests...|$|E
40|$|The {{apparatus}} and method are disclosed for releasably connecting {{first and second}} objects, where a magnetic end effector may include at least one elongated pin number, a proximal end of which {{is connected to the}} first object and the distal end of which may be inserted into a receiving portion in the second object. Latch members are carried by the pin member for radial movement between retracted and expanded positions for releasing and locking, respectively, first and second objects. A plunger member carried by the pin member is <b>axially</b> <b>moveable</b> between first and second positions. In the first plunger position, the latch members are located in the expanded (locked) position and in the second plunger position the latch members are released for movement to retracted or unlocked position. The magnetic end effector is provided for releasable attachment to the first object and for moving the plunger member to the second position, releasing the first object...|$|E
40|$|Results of {{investigations}} of whistler mode ECRH plasma startup in the Michigan Mirror Machine are presented. Electron‐velocity‐distribution and plasma‐spatial‐distribution time evolution {{are characterized by}} measurements from <b>axially</b> and radially <b>moveable</b> Langmuir probes, an endloss current detector, an electron cyclotron emission radiometer, a foil‐filtered X‐ray detector, and a diamagnetic loop at the mirror midplane. Measurements of the buildup of both electron density and perpendicular pressure (nkT⟂) are compared to predictions from various numerical models. Both modeling and data suggest {{the creation of a}} highly anisotropic electron velocity distribution function with a ‘‘sloshing electron’’ axial density profile...|$|R
40|$|An {{expandable}} anchor assembly {{is provided}} for anchoring the threaded end portion of an elongated roof bolt in a borehole. The anchoring assembly includes a hollow outer sleeve {{in the form}} of a plurality of symmetrically arranged, longitudinal segmented wall portions with exterior gripping teeth and an inner expander sleeve {{in the form of}} a corresponding plurality of longitudinal wall portions symmetrically arranged about a central axis to define an inner threaded cylindrical section. The inner sleeve is captured within and <b>moveable</b> <b>axially</b> relative to the outer sleeve. As the threaded end portion of the elongated bolt is inserted into the inner threaded cylindrical section of the inner sleeve from the trailing end to the leading end thereof, the inner sleeve expands over and clamps around the threaded end portion of the elongated bolt. Thereafter, partial withdrawal of the elongated bolt from the borehole causes the inner sleeve to axially move relative to the outer sleeve from the leading end toward the trailing end of the outer sleeve in a wedging action to cause the outer sleeve to radially expand and force engagement of the gripping teeth against the sidewall of the borehole to thereby secure the expandable anchor assembly and therewith the threaded end portion of the elongated bolt within the borehole...|$|R
