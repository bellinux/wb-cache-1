5|$|Brüning's <b>austerity</b> {{measures}} brought little economic {{improvement and}} were extremely unpopular. Hitler exploited this by targeting his political messages specifically {{at people who}} had been affected by the inflation of the 1920s and the Depression, such as farmers, war veterans, and the middle class.|$|E
5|$|Dedicated to Laura, {{daughter}} of the composer Isaac Albéniz. The eleventh and twelfth of the set {{can be viewed as}} another contrasting pair. The eleventh is severe in mood and in rhythm, reflecting the prevailing <b>austerity</b> of Fauré's later style.|$|E

50|$|Although he had {{mastered}} many yogic paths and practised intense <b>austerities,</b> {{he was unable}} to attain his ultimate goal of self-realization until he found his Satguru. Finally, that happened after thirty years of <b>austerities</b> and intense searching. In 1921, while he was practising stringent <b>austerities</b> in a cave on Mt. Abu, Rajasthan, his Guru Shri Yogiraj Parameshwardas, a master of Kundalini yoga, came to him.|$|R
2500|$|Buddha {{initially}} practiced severe <b>austerities,</b> fasting himself {{nearly to}} death of starvation.

5|$|A Book of Mediterranean Food was an {{influential}} cookery book written by Elizabeth David in 1950, her first, {{and published by}} John Lehmann. After years of rationing and wartime <b>austerity,</b> the book brought light and colour back to English cooking, with simple fresh ingredients, from David's experience of Mediterranean cooking while living in France, Italy and Greece. The book was illustrated by John Minton, and the chapters were introduced with quotations from famous writers.|$|E
5|$|According to Oswald Spengler, the {{characteristic}} mistake of the Gracchan age was {{to believe in}} the possibility of the reversibility of history – a form of idealism which according to Spengler was at that time shared by both sides of the political spectrum – Cato had sought to turn back the clock to the time of Cincinnatus, and restore virtue by returning to <b>austerity.</b>|$|E

Inner <b>austerities</b> include expiation, confession, respecting and assisting mendicants, studying, meditation and ignoring bodily wants in order to abandon the body.|$|R
5|$|According to Penton, Rutherford's austerity—evidenced by his {{distaste for}} Christmas, {{birthday}} parties and other popular customs that {{were described as}} of pagan origin or that encouraged creature worship and {{were not to be}} observed—led in turn to <b>austerity</b> becoming a part of Witness life. In 1938, he directed that singing be dispensed with at congregation meetings; singing was reinstated soon after his death.|$|E
5|$|Apart from {{arguments}} {{over whether or}} not <b>austerity,</b> rather than increased or frozen spending, is a macroeconomic solution, union leaders have also argued that the working population is being unjustly held responsible for the economic mismanagement errors of economists, investors, and bankers. Over 23 million EU workers have become unemployed {{as a consequence of the}} global economic crisis of 2007–2010, and this has led many to call for additional regulation of the banking sector across not only Europe, but the entire world.|$|E
5|$|Central to feminist {{economics}} {{is an effort}} to alter the theoretical modeling of the economy, to reduce gender bias and inequity. Feminist macroeconomic inquiries focus on international capital flows, fiscal <b>austerity,</b> deregulation and privatization, monetary policy, international trade and more.

5|$|Dairy farming {{has been}} a major sector of Israeli {{agriculture}} since the founding of the state, and the yield of local milk cows is amongst the highest in the world. Initially, the moshavim (farming cooperatives) and kibbutzim produced mainly soft white cheese as it was inexpensive and nutritious. It became an important staple in the years of <b>austerity</b> and gained a popularity that it enjoys until today.|$|E
5|$|Irish {{banks had}} lost an {{estimated}} 100 billion euros, {{much of it}} related to defaulted loans to property developers and homeowners made {{in the midst of}} the property bubble, which burst around 2007. The economy collapsed during 2008. Unemployment rose from 4% in 2006 to 14% by 2010, while the national budget went from a surplus in 2007 to a deficit of 32% GDP in 2010, the highest in the history of the eurozone, despite <b>austerity</b> measures.|$|E

5|$|The 2012 {{budget was}} {{delivered}} by Finance Minister Marshall on April 24, 2012, {{and was a}} stark contrast from the <b>austerity</b> budget that Dunderdale and her ministers had been warning of for months. Only 45 temporary positions were cut from the public service and a review of programs found $38.8 million in savings, {{much lower than the}} $100 million Dunderdale had previously mentioned. Government spending actually increased in the budget by 1.7 per cent, though this was below the rate of inflation.|$|E
5|$|The SR West Country and Battle of Britain classes, collectively {{known as}} Light Pacifics or informally as Spam Cans, are air-smoothed 4-6-2 Pacific steam {{locomotives}} {{designed for the}} Southern Railway by its Chief Mechanical Engineer Oliver Bulleid. Incorporating {{a number of new}} developments in British steam locomotive technology, they were amongst the first British designs to use welding in the construction process, and to use steel fireboxes, which meant that components could be more easily constructed under wartime <b>austerity</b> and post-war economy.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Piketty, French {{economist}} {{and author of}} the bestselling book Capital in the Twenty-First Century regards taxes on capital as a more favorable option than <b>austerity</b> (inefficient and unjust) and inflation (only affects cash but neither real estates nor business capital). According to his analysis, a flat tax of 15 percent on private wealth would provide the state with nearly a year's worth national income, which would allow for immediate reimbursement of the entire public debt.|$|E
