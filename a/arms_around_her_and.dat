60|$|He {{held his}} thin {{trembling}} <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> devoured {{her face with}} his eyes.|$|E
60|$|He put his <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> {{drew her}} head close to his. Their lips met.|$|E
60|$|He wound his <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her,</b> <b>and,</b> {{without a}} word, {{commenced}} dragging {{her across the}} road.|$|E
60|$|He {{passed his}} <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> pulled <b>her</b> {{down on his}} knees.|$|R
60|$|She {{was shaking}} all over. He passed his other <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> lifted <b>her</b> up.|$|R
60|$|He put his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> led <b>her</b> to an oak bench {{near the}} big fireplace.|$|R
60|$|He {{told her}} what more he had to say, but it was with his <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> his eyes close to hers.|$|E
60|$|Sally came {{softly in}} on tiptoe, threw her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her,</b> <b>and</b> kissed her, {{with a half}} laugh, then {{bursting}} into tears, sobbed upon her shoulder.|$|E
60|$|As {{she reached}} {{the door of the}} house, Cicely Drane was coming out. Involuntarily Miriam threw her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> folded her close to the {{teaberry}} gown.|$|E
60|$|So saying, {{he put his}} <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her,</b> <b>and</b> half leading, half carrying, {{took her}} to her room.|$|R
60|$|She {{frowned at}} his facetiousness--a pretty, adorable frown {{that made him}} put his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> kiss it away.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm almost {{bursting}} with vanity {{from listening to}} you," [...] he laughed, passing his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> drawing <b>her</b> against him.|$|R
6000|$|The {{reply was}} so {{unexpectedly}} mild for Aunt Sally, that Jeff put his <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> kissed her hard cheek. [...] "And I've got some quail, aunty, knowin' you liked em." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{pulled them}} in to a standstill, soothed {{them with his}} voice, and made the reins fast around the whip. Then {{he turned to her}} with <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> lips to lips.|$|E
60|$|With no gentle hand {{he grasped}} {{her arm and}} forced her to look at him. But the misery in her eyes overcame him, and he roughly threw his <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> held her close.|$|E
6000|$|MISS LORE--My! One {{evening he}} has his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her,</b> <b>and</b> the next morning he's ready to break her head! Just like a man! ...|$|R
60|$|He {{passed his}} <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> gripped <b>her</b> fingers tightly. So {{they were sitting}} when, by and by, Selingman burst into the room.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then we'll {{get married}} on triolets that will sell," [...] he {{asserted}} stoutly, putting his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> drawing a very unresponsive sweetheart toward him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh no, it is n't!" [...] {{and behind}} her back her fingers slowly crushed the petals of a blood-red poppy. She shook her head, smiling a {{brilliant}} smile. The blossoms fell, he flung his <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her,</b> <b>and</b> {{kissed her on the}} lips.|$|E
6000|$|He put his <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her,</b> <b>and</b> {{only by the}} convulsive {{movements}} of her body became aware that she was sobbing without a sound. Sustaining her, he lost himself in the profound silence of the night. After a while she became still, and cried quietly. Then, suddenly, as if waking up, she asked: ...|$|E
60|$|She {{leaned toward}} {{him as he}} was about to say good night. But she leaned not imperatively, not seductively, but wistfully and humbly. He was touched to the heart. His large {{tolerance}} rose up in him. He put his <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her,</b> <b>and</b> kissed her, and knew that upon his own lips rested as true a kiss as man ever received.|$|E
60|$|The woman-hater was so distressed that {{he forgot}} to be nervous. He sat down <b>and</b> put his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> spoke out what was in his mind without further parley.|$|R
60|$|NED. [Masterfully putting <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> drawing <b>her</b> toward him.] <b>And</b> I am a joker, too, {{and a very}} wicked man. Nevertheless, {{you must}} trust me. There will be nothing wrong.|$|R
60|$|She {{laughed and}} took his hand as he dragged a chair over to her side. He put his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> head fell {{naturally}} back upon his shoulder. Her eyes sought his. He was leaning forward, gazing down between the curving line of lamp-posts, across the belt of black river with its flecks of yellow light. But Ruth watched him only.|$|R
60|$|As {{he rose to}} {{his feet}} Mary Louise also sprang from her chair and the Colonel folded his <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> for a moment held her tight in his embrace. Then he slowly {{released}} her, holding the girl at arms' length while he studied her troubled face with grave intensity. One kiss upon her upturned forehead and the old man swung around and left the room without another word.|$|E
6000|$|... 9. They bore {{her to a}} bark, and {{the swift}} stroke Of silent rowers clove the blue {{moonlight}} seas, Until upon their path the morning broke; They anchored then, where, be there calm or breeze, [...] 2905 The gloomiest of the drear Symplegades Shakes with the sleepless surge;--the Ethiop there Wound his long <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her,</b> <b>and</b> with knees Like iron clasped her feet, and plunged with her Among the closing waves out of the boundless air. [...] 2910 ...|$|E
60|$|Once, on parting, {{he threw}} his <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> swiftly drew her against him. Her gasping cry of {{surprise}} and pain brought him to his senses and left him there very much embarrassed and still trembling with a vague and nameless delight. And she, too, was trembling. In the hurt itself, which was {{the essence of the}} vigorous embrace, she had found delight; and again she knew sin, though she knew not its nature nor why it should be sin.|$|E
60|$|There was {{a rush of}} {{moisture}} to her eyes. <b>Her</b> voice faltered <b>and</b> broke. She smiled through her tears at them, then {{turned to look at}} Bert, who put his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> gathered <b>her</b> on to his knees.|$|R
6000|$|All {{this now}} {{happened}} to Lawrence. Never before had {{he looked into}} the eyes of a woman who loved him; and, leaning over towards this one, he put his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> drew <b>her</b> towards him. [...] "And never shall you be alone," [...] he said.|$|R
6000|$|She {{took the}} lines, and at Milton's {{suggestion}} wound them <b>around</b> <b>her</b> hands. She looked very pretty with the moon shining on her face, <b>her</b> eyes big <b>and</b> black with excitement, and Milton immediately put his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> laid {{his head on}} her shoulder. [...] "Milton Jennings, you don't"---- ...|$|R
60|$|She was dead, and, after all, her end {{had been}} crowned with peace. She {{did not hear}} the door thrown roughly open, the {{swelling}} of angry voices, or the fast-approaching tramp of many feet. Nor did Paul heed any of these signs of coming danger; he had folded his strong <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her,</b> <b>and</b> his lips, pressed close to her, seemed to draw the last quivering breath from her frail body. It was only when her head sunk back, {{and he knew that}} she was dead, that he laid her reverently down and turned around.|$|E
6000|$|When I {{came up with}} her, I {{turned and}} looked into the bonnet. It was Sylvia. As my eyes fell upon the face of that startled angel, my impulse was to throw my <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her,</b> <b>and</b> rush away with her, gray bonnet, shawl and all, to some distant clime where there were no Houses of Martha, Mother Anastasias, or {{anything}} which could separate my dear love and me; but I crushed down this mad fancy, smothered, as well as I could, my wild emotions, and said, as calmly as possible,-- ...|$|E
60|$|This {{use of our}} given names {{had come}} about quite {{as a matter of}} course, and was as unpremeditated as it was natural. In that moment I could have put my <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> drawn her to me. I should {{certainly}} have done so out in that world to which we belonged. As it was, the situation stopped there in the only way it could; but I was left alone in my little hut, glowing warmly through and through with a pleasant satisfaction; and I knew that a tie, or a tacit something, existed between us which had not existed before.|$|E
60|$|He put his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> kissed <b>her</b> cheek in his frank delight {{at seeing}} her again. Alma coldly asked him in. Her face was still as pale {{as when she}} came downstairs, but a curious little spot of fiery red blossomed out where Gilbert's lips had touched it.|$|R
60|$|He laughed cheerily. His <b>arms</b> were <b>around</b> <b>her,</b> <b>and</b> she was comforted.|$|R
60|$|Then he gave {{a little}} beckoning signal and the girl turned to slip on a light coat, for the nights were chill on the mountain. Afterward she unfastened <b>her</b> outside door <b>and</b> joined the detective, who passed an <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> led <b>her</b> {{to one of the}} benches on the bluff.|$|R
