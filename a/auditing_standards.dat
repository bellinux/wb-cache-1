Further examples of international regulatory bodies are: the Financial Stability Board (FSB) established to coordinate information and activities among developed countries; the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) which coordinates the regulation of financial securities; the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) which promotes consistent insurance industry supervision; the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering which facilitates collaboration in battling money laundering and terrorism financing; and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) which publishes accounting and <b>auditing</b> <b>standards.</b> Public and private arrangements exist to assist and guide countries struggling with sovereign debt payments, such as the Paris Club and London Club. National securities commissions and independent financial regulators maintain oversight of their industries' foreign exchange market activities. Two examples of supranational financial regulators in Europe are the European Banking Authority (EBA) which identifies systemic risks and institutional weaknesses and may overrule national regulators, and the European Shadow Financial Regulatory Committee (ESFRC) which reviews financial regulatory issues and publishes policy recommendations.|$|E

This Committee is considered the antecessor of the <b>Auditing</b> <b>Standards</b> Board, {{and was the first}} to issue Statements on <b>auditing</b> <b>standards</b> and principles to the public accounting community. In 1941 it issued a pamphlet titled Statements on Auditing Procedure, which discussed the auditor’s responsibility in applying judgment in audits. It was followed by a series of numbered pronouncements called Statements on Auditing Procedures, or SAP (the antecessors of Statements on <b>Auditing</b> <b>Standards),</b> issued between 1939 up to the early 1970s for a total of 54 SAP pronouncements. During that time, the Securities Exchange Commission required public accountants to include a representation in their independent audit reports that the audit was performed in compliance with generally accepted <b>auditing</b> <b>standards,</b> and the Committee issued a booklet titled Generally Accepted Auditing Standards—Their Significance and Scope to adopt the SEC’s requirement. In 1963, the Committee issued Statement on Auditing Procedure No. 33 to consolidate and replace various pronouncements issued between 1949 and 1963, including pamphlets and statements.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{contribute}} to an understanding of how <b>auditing</b> <b>standard</b> setting is adapted to changing patterns of resistance at various stages of its development. Design/methodology/approach – The research is conducted as a longitudinal single case study of the auditing standard-setting activities of the Danish professional body 1970 - 1978. The case is based on extensive interviews with members of the standard-setting board at that time, supplemented with documentary studies. Findings – The paper identifies and discusses five general measures to deal with the immanent resistance to <b>auditing</b> <b>standard</b> setting: alignment of interests, representation, due process, soft texts, and reference to ideology. It concludes by analyzing how these strategies are adapted to changing patterns of standard-setting resistance at various stages. Research limitations/implications – The paper discusses <b>auditing</b> <b>standard</b> setting only. Although resistance to accounting standard setting may be dealt with in the same way, the patterns of resistance are most likely different and the adaptation strategies may therefore also be different. Practical implications – Presenting insight into the processes of <b>auditing</b> <b>standard</b> setting, the paper is of interest to anyone involved in the process, either as developers or as users. Originality/value – The paper supplements previous studies of standard setting by applying the Actor-Network Theory approach to <b>auditing</b> <b>standard</b> setting, thereby outlining a new general framework for the study of <b>standard</b> setting. <b>Auditing,</b> Denmark, Regulation, <b>Standards...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background and problem: During {{the last}} couple of years there have been a great number of {{accounting}} scandals throughout the world. The line of auditing is by this time going through extensive changes when the rules are changed nationally and internationally. As an adaptation of Swedish accounting and <b>auditing</b> into international <b>standards,</b> a New <b>Auditing</b> <b>Standard</b> in Sweden that compensates for the former Auditing Process has been appointed. The main problem of this thesis is: what are the effects of a more detailed <b>auditing</b> <b>standard?</b> Purpose: The purpose of this thesis is to investigate the effects of the more detailed New <b>Auditing</b> <b>Standard</b> in Sweden. The authors will investigate how it has affected the responsibility of the auditor and if the quality of the auditing has improved since the New <b>Auditing</b> <b>Standard</b> was introduced. Delimitations: The authors can not investigate every aspect of audit regulation and have therefore decided to concentrate more on the aspect of the auditor, and less on the aspect of the companies of which the audit is made. The authors have chosen to delimitate the thesis to the 200 series of the New <b>Auditing</b> <b>Standard.</b> Methodology: This thesis is based on the qualitative approach. The empirical material has been collected through qualitative interviews. Results and conclusion: The effects for large and small companies are different. Cooperation is the key to an audit of high quality. Regulation is only on of the tools in the procedure, the auditor’s choices are influenced by a lot of factors in the surroundings. A more detailed regulation leaves the auditors with a narrower scope to make judgments on their own. Since all companies are different there is no template to follow while conducting the audit, therefore the audit has to be adapted to each company. Suggestions for further research: It would be interesting to investigate what effects the New <b>Auditing</b> <b>Standard</b> has had from the companies’ point of view. In addition, it would be of great interest to investigate further if the requirement for an audit should be kept or not for small companies. Additionally; an investigation of possible scenarios in the future would be of significant interest...|$|R
