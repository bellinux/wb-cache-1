40|$|This study {{examined}} relationships among self-esteem, media internalization, sexual orientation, and ethnicity in predicting drive for muscularity in {{a diverse group}} of men (N = 217) who work out in gyms. Investigations examined media internalization and sexual orientation as moderators of the relationship between self-esteem <b>and</b> <b>drive</b> for muscularity. Additional analyses examined media internalization as a moderator of the relationships between a) sexual orientation <b>and</b> <b>drive</b> for muscularity <b>and</b> b) ethnicity <b>and</b> <b>drive</b> for muscularity. Standardized questionnaires were utilized to assess drive for muscularity, media internalization, self-esteem, sexual orientation, and ethnicity. While lower self-esteem predicted greater drive for muscularity, neither media internalization nor sexual orientation were significant moderators of this relationship. However, media internalization mediated the relationships between sexual orientation <b>and</b> <b>drive</b> for muscularity <b>and</b> between ethnicity <b>and</b> <b>drive</b> for muscularity. Findings suggest that the internalization of ideal muscularized images explain demographic differences in the drive to be more muscular...|$|R

40|$|Homosexuality {{has been}} found to be a risk factor for body dissatisfaction in men. An online sample of 64 {{homosexual}} men was used to examine the relationship between psychosocial variables hypothesised to play a role in this link (connection to gay community, rejection sensitivity, self-esteem, stigma consciousness, and internalised homophobia) and two aspects of body dissatisfaction (<b>drive</b> for thinness <b>and</b> <b>drive</b> for muscularity). Results from multiple linear regression analyses suggest that <b>drive</b> for thinness <b>and</b> <b>drive</b> for muscularity have distinct profiles, with drive for thinness correlated with low self-esteem, <b>and</b> <b>drive</b> for muscularity correlated with increased involvement with the gay community. Future research should continue to examine <b>drive</b> for thinness <b>and</b> <b>drive</b> for muscularity as distinct aspects of body dissatisfaction...|$|R

Faulkner and Cook became engaged in a physical confrontation. During the traffic stop, Abu-Jamal who was driving his cab in the vicinity, observed the altercation, parked, and ran across the street toward Cook's car. Faulkner was shot from behind and in the face. He shot Abu-Jamal in the stomach. Faulkner died at the scene from the gunshot to his head.|$|E

En route, Attanasio shot Bonventre twice in the head but only wounded him; he would kill Bonventre with two more shots when they reached their destination. The task of {{disposing}} of Bonventre's corpse was handed to Gabriel Infanti, who promised Vitale that Bonventre's remains would disappear forever. However, after a tipoff, the remains were discovered on April 16, 1984, in a warehouse in Garfield, New Jersey, stuffed into two 55-gallon glue drums.|$|E
5|$|Demand from {{middlemen}} {{and specialized}} animal trade mafias {{has increased the}} profitability of slow loris hunting <b>and</b> <b>driven</b> many hunters to catch any they spot by climbing or shaking trees. In the Mondulkiri Province in Cambodia, slow lorises are shaken out of trees and then bludgeoned {{to death with a}} stick. In Indonesia, slow lorises are worth more alive, so hunters climb the tree to reach them and place a V-shaped stick around their neck to immobilize them. If the slow loris is found in with an infant, the parent is often killed.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the various}} charters, the {{provision}} of royal justice was inconsistent <b>and</b> <b>driven</b> by the needs of immediate politics: sometimes action would be taken to address a legitimate baronial complaint, while on other occasions the problem would simply be ignored. The royal courts, which toured the country to provide justice at the local level, typically for lesser barons and the gentry claiming grievances against major lords, had little power, allowing the major barons to dominate the local justice system. Henry's rule became lax and careless, resulting in a reduction in royal authority in the provinces and, ultimately, the collapse of his authority at court.|$|E
5|$|James then flew to Algiers, {{where he}} was {{publicly}} paraded through the airport <b>and</b> <b>driven</b> to meet General Maitland Wilson, ostensibly for a meeting to discuss operations against the south of France. Instead, he was moved quietly to a remote villa by 'A' Force's Rex Hamer. Rumours suggest this was because James had been spotted smoking and staggering around Algiers, so the deceivers decided to cut his appearances short. Whatever the reason, the next day, out of character, James was flown to Cairo. He was to remain hidden there until the public disclosure of Montgomery's presence in France. Meanwhile, double agents in North Africa were used to extend the masquerade {{for a few more}} days, by hinting Montgomery was still in the region.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} relationships between media influence (exposure, self-comparison to media ideals and internalization of media messages, societal pressure {{to have the}} perfect body, using media {{as a source of}} information about how to achieve a certain body ideal) <b>and</b> <b>drive</b> for thinness <b>and</b> <b>drive</b> for muscularity in 311 male and female undergraduates at a university in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States. We hypothesized that <b>drive</b> for thinness <b>and</b> <b>drive</b> for muscularity in both women and men would relate to body comparison/internalization, societal pressure, use of media for information, magazine consumption and television viewing. We also expected television and magazines would have different influences on men <b>and</b> women’s <b>drive</b> for muscularity <b>and</b> <b>drive</b> for thinness. Finally, we hypothesized that societal pressure and using media as a source of information would mediate the relation between media exposure (number of magazines read, hours of television watched) <b>and</b> <b>drive</b> for thinness <b>and</b> <b>drive</b> for muscularity in women and men. Students completed surveys on-line. Results revealed using media as a source of information on how to attain the ideal body mediates the relationship between <b>drive</b> for thinness <b>and</b> media exposure in women. Overall, it seems that media and the internalization of general/non-athletic body ideals may have an impact on drive for thinness in both men and women. Similarly, internalization of athletic body ideals may relate to drive for muscularity in both collegiate {{men and women in the}} U. S. Implications for counselors were discussed...|$|R
