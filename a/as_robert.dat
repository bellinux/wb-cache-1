5|$|Like the Tom Swift, Jr. series, {{the series}} portrays Tom as a {{scientist}} {{as well as an}} inventor whose inventions depend on a knowledge of theory. The series differs from previous versions of the character, however, in that Tom's inventive genius is portrayed as problematic and sometimes dangerous. <b>As</b> <b>Robert</b> Von der Osten argues, Tom's inventions for this series often have unexpected and negative repercussions.|$|E

5|$|Swakeleys manor, {{subordinate}} to Ickenham, {{was named after}} Robert Swalcliffe, who owned the manor with his wife Joan in the 14th century.

5|$|The role of {{cleaning}} symbioses has been debated by biologists for over thirty years. Some believe that cleaning represents selfless co-operation, essentially pure mutualism, increasing the fitness of both individuals.

Others again believe that cleaning behaviour is simply one-sided exploitation, {{a form of}} parasitism.|$|E
5|$|A clergyman {{is said to}} have {{informed}} Richard that Edward IV's {{marriage to}} Elizabeth Woodville was invalid because of Edward's earlier union with Eleanor Butler, making Edward V and his siblings illegitimate. The identity of the informant is known only through the memoires of French diplomat Philippe de Commines <b>as</b> <b>Robert</b> Stillington, the Bishop of Bath and Wells. On 22 June 1483, a sermon was preached outside Old St. Paul's Cathedral declaring Edward's children bastards and Richard the rightful king. Shortly after, the citizens of London, both nobles and commons, convened and drew up a petition asking Richard to assume the throne. He accepted on 26 June and was crowned at Westminster Abbey on 6 July 1483. His title to the throne was confirmed by Parliament in January 1484 by the document Titulus Regius.|$|E
5|$|Among {{professional}} economists {{the revival}} of Keynesian economics has been even more divisive.

Some economists, such <b>as</b> <b>Robert</b> Lucas, questioned the theoretical basis for stimulus packages. Others, like Robert Barro and Gary Becker, say that empirical evidence for beneficial effects from Keynesian stimulus does not exist. However, {{there is a growing}} academic literature that shows that fiscal expansion helps an economy grow in the near term, and that certain types of fiscal stimulus are particularly effective.|$|E
