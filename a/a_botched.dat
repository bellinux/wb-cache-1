Seven soldiers were subsequently executed by firing squad. The mutineers testified that {{they were forced to}} such measures by the severity of Sheaffe's command. They said if they had continued under Brock's command, they would never have taken such action. Brock was evidently upset by the news that the conspirators had been shot. In <b>a</b> <b>botched</b> execution, the firing squad discharged their weapons at too long a distance, so that the condemned men were not killed instantly.|$|E

It was <b>a</b> <b>botched</b> attempt; in spite of tumultuous crowds who greeted the rebels in Durham, the rebellion did not spread. The assistance they sought did not materialise, their communication with allies at Court was poor.

Orton argued that this could potentially end his career. According to Anderson, Randy Orton also persuaded his friend and fellow wrestler John Cena to complain to Vince McMahon about Anderson's in ring performance, which prompted McMahon to release Kennedy from his contract.|$|E

5000|$|Early {{versions}} of the Storyteller System used {{a version of this}} by which if a player rolled a 1, his character suffered a critical failure rather than just had negative consequences. This made rolling botches (critical failures) more likely the higher the skill or attribute as these added more dice.

5|$|In {{the next}} match, which {{was for the}} WWF World Heavyweight Championship, {{challenger}} Shawn Michaels was accompanied to the ring by Jenny McCarthy and Diesel, the champion, was escorted by Pamela Anderson. Michaels relied on his quickness in the opening stages, while Diesel used his strength advantage against Michaels.

Michaels capitalized on his advantage by performing several aerial moves, including a flying crossbody, flying bulldog throw, and a diving elbow drop. He was unable to pin Diesel, however, so he performed a sleeper hold to wear Diesel down. They brawled outside the ring, after which Michaels performed a superkick, his finishing move, but Sid, Michaels's bodyguard, had the referee distracted and unable to count the pinfall.
