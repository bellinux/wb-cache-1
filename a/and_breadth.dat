40|$|Recently work on {{technological}} change has {{emphasized the importance}} and implications of different knowledge bases among industries in terms of innovative potential. In some industries, products and processes have become more complex, as well as {{there appears to be}} increased convergence in some market segments. Although increasing attention has been given to features of knowledge bases, there have been limited empirical research on how to measure them. In this paper a method is proposed to measure empirically the <b>breadth</b> <b>and</b> depth dimensions of main technology fields, sectors and firms in the economy. For this purpose, we measure the knowledge bases of 30 main technology fields by using the concepts of <b>breadth</b> <b>and</b> depth. <b>Breadth</b> corresponds to the range of different subjects that a technology field draws upon. Depth refers {{to the extent to which}} a certain field is exploited in detail. We position the main technology fields in the <b>breadth</b> <b>and</b> depth space by utilizing the EPO (European Patent Office) database between 1978 - 2000. We also present the evolution of <b>breadth</b> <b>and</b> depth through time, as well as the <b>breadth</b> <b>and</b> depth dimensions of 40 largest firms in biotechnology and telecommunications. Our results reveal that the both technology fields and firms are largely scattered in the <b>breadth</b> <b>and</b> depth space. Biotechnology stands out to have the highest <b>breadth</b> <b>and</b> depth. Patents, <b>Breadth</b> <b>and</b> depth, technology fields, knowledge base. ...|$|R

5|$|The Rockefeller Foundation {{offered an}} {{extension}} of Bethe's fellowship, allowing {{him to return to}} Italy in 1932. In the meantime, Bethe worked for Sommerfeld in Munich as a privatdozent. Since Bethe was fluent in English, Sommerfeld had Bethe supervise all his English-speaking postdoctoral fellows, including Lloyd P. Smith from Cornell University. Bethe accepted a request from Karl Scheel to write an article for the Handbuch der Physik on the quantum mechanics of hydrogen and helium. Reviewing the article decades later, Robert Bacher and Victor Weisskopf noted that it was unusual in the depth <b>and</b> <b>breadth</b> of its treatment of the subject, yet required very little updating for the 1959 edition. Bethe was then asked by Sommerfeld to help him with the handbuch article on electrons in metals. The article covered the basis of what is now called solid state physics. Bethe took a very new field and provided a clear, coherent and complete coverage of it. His work on the handbuch articles occupied {{most of his time in}} Rome, but he also co-wrote a paper with Fermi on another new field, quantum electrodynamics, describing the relativistic interactions of charged particles.|$|E
5|$|The axiomatization of mathematics, on {{the model}} of Euclid's Elements, had reached new levels of rigour <b>and</b> <b>breadth</b> {{at the end of the}} 19th century, {{particularly}} in arithmetic, thanks to the axiom schema of Richard Dedekind and Charles Sanders Peirce, and in geometry, thanks to Hilbert's axioms. But at the beginning of the 20th century, efforts to base mathematics on naive set theory suffered a setback due to Russell's paradox (on the set of all sets that do not belong to themselves). The problem of an adequate axiomatization of set theory was resolved implicitly about twenty years later by Ernst Zermelo and Abraham Fraenkel. Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory provided a series of principles that allowed for the construction of the sets used in the everyday practice of mathematics, but they did not explicitly exclude the possibility of the existence of a set that belongs to itself. In his doctoral thesis of 1925, von Neumann demonstrated two techniques to exclude such sets—the axiom of foundation and the notion of class.|$|E

40|$|Aim   To {{identify}} {{the factors that}} contribute to variation in abundance (population density), and to investigate whether habitat <b>breadth</b> <b>and</b> diet <b>breadth</b> predict macroecological patterns in a suborder of passerine birds (Meliphagoidea). Location   Australia (including Tasmania). Methods   Mean abundance data were collated from site surveys of bird abundance (the Australian Bird Count); range size and latitudinal position data from published distribution maps; and body mass <b>and</b> diet <b>breadth</b> information from published accounts. A diversity index of habitats used (habitat breadth) was calculated from the bird census data. We used bivariate correlation and multiple regression techniques, employing two phylogenetic comparative methods: phylogenetic generalized least squares and independent contrasts. Results   Body mass and latitude were the only strong predictors of abundance, with larger-bodied and lower-latitude species existing at lower densities. Together, however, body mass and latitude explained only 11. 1 % of the variation in mean abundance. Range size <b>and</b> habitat <b>breadth</b> were positively correlated, as were diet <b>breadth</b> <b>and</b> body mass. However, neither range size, nor habitat <b>breadth</b> <b>and</b> diet <b>breadth,</b> explained patterns in abundance either directly or indirectly. Main conclusions   Levels of abundance (population density) in meliphagoid birds are most closely linked to body mass and latitudinal position, but not range size. As with many other macroecological analyses, we find little evidence for aspects of niche breadth having an effect on patterns of abundance. We hypothesize that evolutionary age may also have a determining effect on why species tend to be rarer (less abundant) in the tropics. <br /...|$|R
