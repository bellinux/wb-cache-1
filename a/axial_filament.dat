40|$|The fine {{structure}} of the spirochete Treponema zuelzerae, and particularly of its <b>axial</b> <b>filaments,</b> was investigated by using the electron microscope.

A multidisciplinary analysis of the structural features of the protein <b>axial</b> <b>filaments</b> inside the spicules of a number of marine sponges, belonging to two different classes (Demospongiae and Hexactinellida), is presented, together with a preliminary analysis of the biosilicification process. The study was carried out by a unique combination of techniques: fiber diffraction using synchrotron radiation, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetric (DSC), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and molecular modeling. From a phylogenetic point of view, the main result is the structural difference between the dimension and packing of the protein units in the spicule filaments of the Demospongiae and the Hexactinellida species. Models of the protein organization in the spicule <b>axial</b> <b>filaments,</b> consistent with the various experimental evidences, are given.

40|$|Electron {{microscopic}} {{studies of}} the epithelial cells of the uriniferous tubules in Rana nigromaculata produced the following result : 1. There are {{a large number of}} minute spherical elements in the cytoplasm of the epithelial cells of the uriniferous tubules. They have been referred to as microsomes. Microsomes may be divided into two categories according to their size and density, Morita 2 ̆ 7 s S-Microsomes and C-Microsomes. They are seen connected with each other by dark A-Substance of varying form, appearing as strings. 2. Mitochondria may be divided into two types according to the difference in their inner structure. Mitochondria of one type are those in which a structure resembling a comb, or the so-called 2 ̆ 2 cristae mitochondriales, 2 ̆ 2 is observed. The so-called 2 ̆ 2 cristae 2 ̆ 2 are supposed to be the outgrowth of the microsomes situated a mitochondrion. They grow in size and number to form this characteristic structure. Mitochondria of the other type contain a great number of vesicular granules in them, which appear at a glance as a foamy structure. This vesicular granule may be indistinguishable in form the S-Microsome located in the cytoplasm. 3. At the basal region of the epithelium, of the Mittelstiick, there are tubular structures which bend in a complicated manner. Having an opening in the basal region, they have a blind end in the cytoplasm. When this tubular structure develops to encircle a mitochondrion, the mitochondrion grows large in size, showing a tendency to swell and become vague in outline. 4. The presence of peculiar vacuoles and granules in the supranuclear region is observed in the epithelium of the Hauptstiick. On the free surface of the lumen, there is what is called a 2 ̆ 2 brush border 2 ̆ 2 which consists of a great number of tubules that are polygonal in form. It appears that the lumen of this tubule has a communication with the cytoplasm. 5. The epithelim of the Halsstiick has cilia. The ultrastructure of the cilium agrees well with what has been reported by Fawcett and Porter (1954). There are 9 <b>axial</b> <b>filaments</b> in the periphery and 2 in the center, with a basal corpuscle at the base of each cilium. This basal corpuscle consists entirely of peripheral <b>axial</b> <b>filaments,</b> being cylindrical in form. The rootlets of many cilia are Y-shaped, while those of some cilia gather together in a great number to form bundles which run toward the upper border of the nucleus. The nucleus of the epithelial cell of this part has an irregular contour. The bundles composed of the rootlets of cilia appear to run toward the hollow in the upper border of the nucleus, but they do not come in contact with the nuclear membrane or penetrate into the nucleus.
