40|$|M. Ed. (Educational Management) As {{the leader}} of a group of teachers, the <b>principal</b> of <b>a</b> school has a {{managerial}} task to perform. This would include the creation of an educational environment wherein effective teaching and learning can take place. Many of the principal's managerial functions are described in the literature, but the ideal school climate is not the result of purely organizational, administrative and supervisory management. Harmonious interpersonal relations are just as important. Meaningful education in schools can only take place if a congenial relationship between principal and staff exists. Where the principal and staff of a school are interdependent upon each other, sound relationships are essential. The principal should thus practice his style of management and leadership so as not to offend his staff. This would include characteristics <b>such</b> <b>as</b> empathy, respect, warmth and to be explicit in his manner. Furthermore, the personal characteristics of the principal as well as effective communication and motivation can promote job satisfaction and influence the creation and maintenance of interpersonal relations. Practice shows indisputable evidence that the importance of good personal relationships is of great importance in <b>a</b> people-oriented enterprise <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> school. <b>Principals</b> should thus also be sure to maintain a healthy balance between their people- and task orientated styles of management. The handling of conflict should take place in a manner which is not detrimental to the processes of teaching and learning. Conflict should therefore not be seen as only having a negative influence...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The difficulties for a college's decision-makers {{in the management of}} resources are manifold and give rise to complexities dissimilar, in many respects, from those usually found in an industrial setting. Whereas in industry pressure is generated by what the public will buy, the pressures in education arise partly from the rising standards of expectation of the public and partly from the education service itself in the role of initiator. (1. 0). In addition, some industrial researchers would also assert that the prime objective of a company is to make a profit acceptable to shareholders. (23). The organisational structure and major activities of the company are thus geared to the attainment of this goal. This {{is not to say that}} other company objectives are not considered to be important but the 'primary task' is seen'as one of profit-making. If, then, the primary task of a company is to make profits, it could be asked what is the primary task of a further education college and from what point of view? Other research has shown, for example, for a further education college there can be wide opinion variances among students, employers and lecturing staff about what they see as the central purpose of the college (15). Similar findings were expressed in the Plowden Report about the formulations of objectives by primary school head-teachers. (Para. 497). The model conceived in this research has re-constructed the kind of management system in operation at many colleges in the further education sector and made use of the linear programming methodology to formulate objectives and constraints in the optimising of a department's course provision. However, its chief pre-occupation was not seen as that of optimisation in so much as focussing attention on relevant information for decision-making. In particular, the purpose of this kind of information is to assist <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> college <b>principal</b> and departmental heads with the formulation of policy relating to staff manpower requirements in a situation where fluctuating patterns of demand for courses occur from year to year...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{defining}} features of contemporary zeitgeist {{is that we}} live in an era of mediatization – a metaprocess, through (and by) which all everyday relations increasingly depend on networked media technologies and online communication channels. Due to rapid developments in digital electronics, all these Internet- or mobile-enabled platforms, and devices, are prone to the processes of quantification and datafication, and <b>as</b> <b>such,</b> surveillance is <b>a</b> <b>principal</b> dimension that lies at the core of mediatization. Through five peer-reviewed academic articles and the cover text, this dissertation provides a multi-faceted analysis of the complex relationships – built by Azerbaijan’s and Turkey’s state intelligence, security and law enforcement agencies with a number of local, and global, private information, entertainment and telecommunications companies. The articles are focused on different cases: the complete dispersion of commercial social media based oppositional activists in Azerbaijan, and the arrests of Anonymous led hacktivists in Turkey, both happening in 2011; and, the mass mobilization of millions of Turkish citizens during the Gezi Park protests of 2013. The current compilation puts forth in-depth accounts and scrutiny of how various social movements (in general), and individual activists (in particular), are affected by an amalgamation of public, political; and, private, economic, surveillance practices and seeks to illuminate the abusive extents of this transformation – vis-à-vis the changing media and communication environment – by way of using mediatization as an analytical tool. Overall, this dissertation contributes a nuanced understanding of the complex interplay between the increasingly mediatized natures of activism and surveillance in semi-authoritarian states. The conclusions have relevance and significance – in considering both similar country contexts and on a global scale – in the light of contemporary technological and political transformations.
