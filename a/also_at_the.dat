5|$|After {{a period}} in England, de Vere {{returned}} to the Continent in 1342, where he served with Northampton, who had been made lieutenant of Brittany.

In the summer of 1346 de Vere was campaigning with the king in Normandy, and took part in the Battle of Crécy.

Prominent Brazilian politicians, most notably Pinheiro Machado and the Baron of Rio Branco, moved to have the country recognized as an international power, as they believed that the short-term windfall would continue. A strong navy was seen as crucial to this goal. The National Congress of Brazil drew up and passed a large naval acquisition program in late 1904, but it was two years before any ships were ordered. While they first ordered three small battleships, the launch of the revolutionary British Dreadnought—which heralded a new and powerful type of warship—caused the Brazilians to cancel their order in favor of two dreadnoughts, with a third to follow.|$|E
