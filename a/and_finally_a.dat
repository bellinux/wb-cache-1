5|$|After {{undergoing}} substantial repairs, Temeraire {{was employed}} blockading the French fleets and supporting British operations off the Spanish coasts. She {{went out to}} the Baltic in 1809, defending convoys against Danish gunboat attacks, and by 1810 was off the Spanish coast again, helping to defend Cadiz against a French army. Her last action was against the French off Toulon, when she came under fire from shore batteries. The ship returned to Britain in 1813 for repairs, but was laid up. She was converted to a prison ship and moored in the River Tamar until 1819. Further service brought her to Sheerness as a receiving ship, then a victualling depot, <b>and</b> <b>finally</b> <b>a</b> guard ship. The Admiralty ordered her to be sold in 1838, and she was towed up the Thames to be broken up.|$|E
5|$|Amid {{rumors that}} the team would be sold and/or relocated, the Mariners—who had had only two winning seasons (1991 and 1993) since {{beginning}} play in 1977—mounted a late-season comeback in 1995 to clinch their first postseason appearance in franchise history. They then mounted a series of comebacks in the ALDS, first overcoming a 2-game series deficit to force a deciding Game 5, then tying Game 5 in the 8th inning to force extra innings, <b>and</b> <b>finally</b> <b>a</b> one-run 11th inning deficit that was overcome by the Double.|$|E

5|$|Cryptothecia rubrocincta is a crustose lichen, {{because it}} {{grows in the}} form of a surface crust. The thallus, or body of the lichen is spread out flat and can be either tightly to loosely {{attached}} to the growing surface. It is 0.15–0.30mm thick, and can be smooth, or have low radiating ridges. The older, central region of the lichen surface has many reproductive structures called isidia; they resemble granules that are 0.1–0.4 by 0.1mm. The species relies entirely on vegetative means to reproduce, and is not known to have any sexual structures. From the center outwards, three color zones can be differentiated in mature specimens; the first grayish-green, the second white, <b>and</b> <b>finally</b> <b>a</b> bright red cottony rim.|$|E
5|$|Cryptothecia rubrocincta is {{a species}} of lichen in the Arthoniaceae family of fungi. The species is {{distributed}} in subtropical and tropical locations throughout the southeastern United States, as well as Central and South America, and has been collected infrequently in a few locales in Africa. The body of the lichen forms continuous, circular crust-like patches on dead wood, readily recognizable by the prominent red pigment. The older, central region is covered with red, spherical to cylindrical granules. Moving outwards from the center, zones of color may be distinguished, the first gray-green, the second white, <b>and</b> <b>finally</b> <b>a</b> bright red cottony rim. The red and green colors of this unmistakable woodland lichen {{give the appearance of}} a Christmas wreath, suggestive of its common North American name, the Christmas wreath lichen. The red pigment, called chiodectonic acid is one of several chemicals the lichen produces to help tolerate inhospitable growing conditions.|$|E
5|$|Former {{changes in}} sea levels have left {{continental}} shelves, shallow {{areas in the}} sea close to land. These nutrient-rich waters teem with life, which provide humans with substantial supplies of food—mainly fish, but also shellfish, mammals, and seaweed—which are both harvested in the wild and farmed. The most diverse areas surround great tropical coral reefs. Whaling in the deep sea was once common but whales' dwindling numbers prompted international conservation efforts <b>and</b> <b>finally</b> <b>a</b> moratorium on most commercial hunting. Oceanography has established that not all life is restricted to the sunlit surface waters: even under enormous depths and pressures, nutrients streaming from hydrothermal vents support their own unique ecosystem. Life may have started there and aquatic microbial mats are generally credited with the oxygenation of Earth's atmosphere; both plants and animals first evolved in the sea.|$|E

Titus Flavius Norbanus may have been appointed to the prefecture of Egypt, but almost certainly became prefect of the Praetorian Guard by 94, with Titus Petronius Secundus as his colleague. Domitian opened the year following the revolt by sharing the consulship with Marcus Cocceius Nerva, suggesting the latter had {{played a part in}} uncovering the conspiracy, perhaps in a fashion similar to the one he played during the Pisonian conspiracy under Nero.|$|E

ILM supervisor Dennis Muren considered using stop motion animation for the scene. He also explained that another traditional and practical way in the late-1980s to execute this sequence would have been through the use of an optical dissolve with cutaways at various stages.|$|E

In the bottom of the eighth, the Mariners again had the bases loaded when Tino Martinez singled to score Edgar Martínez, followed by a Dan Wilson double that scored Jay Buhner and Blowers, <b>and</b> <b>finally</b> <b>a</b> sacrifice fly double play hit by Cora that scored Tino Martinez but got Wilson thrown out at third. Tony Phillips led off the ninth for the Angels with a home run to avoid a shutout, but Johnson retired the next three Angels hitters to record his sixth complete game and 18th win of the season.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{conspicuous}} elements of the painting is the ring on the model's ring finger. Resting on the mantle piece, it becomes a {{focal point of the}} composition. The ring was a device of which Whistler was conscious; it had not been present in The White Girl. Though he and Hiffernan were not married, the ring showed a development in how he represented her in his art; from prostitute in Wapping, to mistress in The White Girl, <b>and</b> <b>finally</b> <b>a</b> wife in The Little White Girl. At the same time, this development reflected Whistler's notion of his own position in the English art world: towards greater legitimacy. The ring is also an allusion to the Christian sacrament of marriage, which lends a religious aspect to the aestheticism that he and Swinburne were trying to develop.|$|E
5|$|Saturn's {{interior}} is probably {{composed of a}} core of iron–nickel and rock (silicon and oxygen compounds). This core {{is surrounded by a}} deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, <b>and</b> <b>finally</b> <b>a</b> gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. Electrical current within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than Earth's, but has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth due to Saturn's larger size. Saturn's magnetic field strength is around one-twentieth of Jupiter's. The outer atmosphere is generally bland and lacking in contrast, although long-lived features can appear. Wind speeds on Saturn can reach , higher than on Jupiter, but not as high as those on Neptune.|$|E

5|$|The Astros' Joe Niekro retired the Dodgers {{in order}} {{in the first and}} second innings. The Astros added to their lead {{in the top of the}} third as Cedeño singled, stole second (after Cruz had been caught {{stealing}} earlier in the inning), and scored on Art Howe's home run to make the game 4–0. Niekro allowed two successive singles to lead off the bottom of the inning, but proceeded to retire three straight Dodgers without allowing either runner to score. The Astros further added to their lead in the fourth, as Puhl singled on a bunt to third base and then stole second and third base while Cabell batted. Both he and Morgan walked to load the bases with one out. Puhl scored on a Cruz sacrifice fly, Cedeño walked to re-load the bases, <b>and</b> <b>finally</b> <b>a</b> Howe single gave the Astros another two runs to make the game 7–0.|$|E
5|$|The Yankees {{replaced}} Melky Cabrera {{on their}} postseason roster with Ramiro Peña {{due to his}} injury in Game4, while Brett Gardner took Cabrera's place in center field. A. J.

The Yankees scored first in the first inning, with Johnny Damon reaching base with a single and then scoring on a two-out double by Alex Rodriguez. The Phillies responded {{in the bottom of}} the inning with a single by Jimmy Rollins, Shane Victorino reaching after being hit by a pitch, <b>and</b> <b>finally</b> <b>a</b> three-run home run by Chase Utley to take the lead.

5|$|The eggs may be {{deposited}} singly or {{in small}} groups, or may {{take the form of}} spherical egg masses, rafts or long strings. In terrestrial caecilians, the eggs are laid in grape-like clusters in burrows near streams. The amphibious salamander Ensatina attaches its similar clusters by stalks to underwater stems and roots. The greenhouse frog (Eleutherodactylus planirostris) lays eggs in small groups in the soil where they develop in about two weeks directly into juvenile frogs without an intervening larval stage. The tungara frog (Physalaemus pustulosus) builds a floating nest from foam to protect its eggs. First a raft is built, then eggs are laid in the centre, <b>and</b> <b>finally</b> <b>a</b> foam cap is overlaid. The foam has anti-microbial properties.
