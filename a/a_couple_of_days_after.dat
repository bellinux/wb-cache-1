He mentioned that despite sharing the biggest rivalry of their careers, they always shared mutual admiration for professional wrestling. In an act of motivation, he told Cena to 'wake up' and beat Brock Lesnar. He also mentioned beforehand that he was not supposed to be on the show that night, also declaring that he would no longer be under contract with WWE in <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days.</b> <b>After</b> this, his contract with the WWE had legitimately expired. On the September 21, 2012 episode of SmackDown, Edge made an appearance addressing Team Hell No.|$|E

25|$|As the Railway minister, he has {{advocated}} instituting a rail regulator to fix rail fares, {{a policy}} that is diametrically opposite to the one by earlier railway ministers. He has also advocated de-politicizing the Railways {{and would like to}} restructure the Indian Railway Board, which lacked synergy before he joined. Trivedi believes that the Indian Railways can add 2% to India's GDP and is willing to go against his party's line of not hiking the fares. However, he believes the government must modernize the railways, for which a fare hike {{would not be able to}} generate adequate funds, and has publicly criticized the Prime Minister for not providing funds.. Trivedi is pushing for a national policy on railways, that would continue irrespective of political changes in the government. He has also said that the ministry is also open to the idea of privatization, which would allow more funds to be allocated to help the system cope with capacity. He stepped down as the Railway Minister on 18 March 2012, <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>after</b> presenting his first ever Railway Budget in which he increased passenger fare. This did not go down well with his political party, Trinamool Congress and in particular its head West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.|$|E
25|$|During the 2014 NBA draft, the Suns drafted sophomore forward T. J. Warren from NC State, Canadian {{freshman}} {{point guard}} Tyler Ennis from Syracuse, Serbian shooting guard Bodgan Bogdanović, and senior center-power forward Alec Brown from Wisconsin-Green Bay. After trying to obtain players like LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, and Chris Bosh, and after losing key player Channing Frye to the Orlando Magic, the Suns decided to sign-and-trade for Sacramento Kings point guard Isaiah Thomas under a four-year contract worth $27 million {{in exchange for}} Alex Oriakhi, using a $7 million traded-player exception. On September 24, 2014, the Suns and Eric Bledsoe agreed on a five-year contract worth $70 million after months of inactivity between both sides for a new offer. <b>A</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>after,</b> on September 29, 2014, they extended both Markieff and Marcus Morris to 4-year deals that combine to $52 million, with Markieff earning $32 million while Marcus gets the remaining $20 million. Right before the trade deadline on February 19, 2015, however, the Suns made moves to change the team made roster. After demanding a trade due to lingering frustrations with the front office {{and direction of the}} team, Goran Dragić and his brother Zoran were traded by the Suns to the Miami Heat for Danny Granger and Miami's 2017 and 2021 first-round picks in a three-team trade with the New Orleans Pelicans. Immediately right after the trade, the Suns made a surprising move in replacing Dragić by trading for Milwaukee Bucks guard Brandon Knight, sending away Tyler Ennis and Miles Plumlee to Milwaukee while also sending the Lakers' 2015 first-round pick to the Philadelphia 76ers. Isaiah Thomas was then traded right after to the Boston Celtics for Marcus Thornton and the Cleveland Cavaliers' 2016 first-round pick.|$|E

In an unrelated September 16 incident, a straphanger got injured while walking up another escalator at the 34th Street station. Earlier that day, the New York Post reported on signal problems in the brand-new tunnels around the station, while riders complained about the delays on Twitter and Reddit. A Wall Street Journal commentator remarked that [...] "it's only a matter of months (make that weeks) before the gleaming station ... is pockmarked with chewing-gum spots, urban scrawl and litter." [...] Overall, however, the station received positive acclaim during its first few days of service.

500|$|The now three-piece Oasis {{chose to}} {{continue}} recording the album, with Noel Gallagher re-recording most of Arthurs' guitar and McGuigan's bass parts.

Finding a replacement bassist took more time and effort. The band were rehearsing with David Potts, but he quickly resigned, and they brought in Andy Bell, former guitarist/songwriter of Ride and Hurricane No.1 as their new bassist. Bell had never played bass before and had to learn to play it (with Noel since saying that Liam said, [...] "If he can play the guitar, he can play the fookin' bass"), along with a handful of songs from Oasis' back catalogue, in preparation for a scheduled tour of America in December 1999.|$|E
500|$|The idea of {{combining}} motion pictures with recorded sound {{is nearly as}} old as the concept of cinema itself. On February 27, 1888, <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>after</b> photographic pioneer Eadweard Muybridge gave a lecture not far from the laboratory of Thomas Edison, the two inventors privately met. Muybridge later claimed that on this occasion, six years before the first commercial motion picture exhibition, he proposed a scheme for sound cinema that would combine his image-casting zoopraxiscope with Edison's recorded-sound technology. No agreement was reached, but within a year Edison commissioned the development of the Kinetoscope, essentially a [...] "peep-show" [...] system, as a visual complement to his cylinder phonograph. The two devices were brought together as the Kinetophone in 1895, but individual, cabinet viewing of motion pictures was soon to be outmoded by successes in film projection. In 1899, a projected sound-film system known as Cinemacrophonograph or Phonorama, based primarily on the work of Swiss-born inventor François Dussaud, was exhibited in Paris; similar to the Kinetophone, the system required individual use of earphones. An improved cylinder-based system, Phono-Cinéma-Théâtre, was developed by Clément-Maurice Gratioulet and Henri Lioret of France, allowing short films of theater, opera, and ballet excerpts to be presented at the Paris Exposition in 1900. These appear to be the first publicly exhibited films with projection of both image and recorded sound. Phonorama and yet another sound-film system—Théâtroscope—were also presented at the Exposition.|$|E

He called both main courses [...] "the business"; they were a saddle of rabbit served with a herb risotto, leeks, asparagus and a rosemary au jus; the other course was ham wrapped sweetbreads, he added were [...] "stupendously good", served with braised lettuice and cep confit.
