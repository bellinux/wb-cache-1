5000|$|He wrote several {{collections}} {{of short stories}} that were well received. His short stories often follow a Chekhovian pattern. The characters in Trevor's work are typically marginalised members of society: children, the elderly, single middle-aged men and women, or the unhappily married. Those who cannot accept the reality of their lives create their own alternative worlds into which they retreat. A number of the stories use Gothic elements to explore the nature of evil and its connection to madness. Trevor acknowledged the influence of James Joyce on his short-story writing, and [...] "the odour of <b>ashpits</b> and old weeds and offal" [...] can be detected in his work, but the overall impression is not of gloominess, since, particularly in his early work, the author's wry humour offers the reader a tragicomic version of the world. He adapted much of his work for stage, television and radio. In 1990, Fools of Fortune {{was made into a}} film directed by Pat O'Connor, along with a 1999 film adaptation of Felicia's Journey, which was directed by Atom Egoyan.|$|R
2500|$|William Matthew Scott {{was born}} at 128 Camp Road (now Oatland Lane) in Little London, Leeds, Yorkshire on 30 September 1893. Camp Road was {{demolished}} in the 1960s. His place of birth was next to the poor Jewish immigrant area of tailors and shoemakers, called the Leylands, in the All Souls district of Leeds. At least until 1911 Scott lived in the working-class areas of Little London and Woodhouse, next to Meanwood Beck. The area {{has a history of}} poverty, and within living memory were the Woodhouse cholera epidemic of the 1840s, and the typhoid epidemic in nearby Headingley of 1889. When Scott was born, the middens and <b>ashpits</b> which had nurtured the diseases were being replaced by communal water closets. That meant that inhabitants of the back-to-backs had to walk {{to the end of the}} row to use the lavatory or empty a chamber pot but they would not catch cholera; communal outside lavatories and cobbled streets with washing lines overhead persisted while Scott lived there. However it should be remembered that street communities were strong, public transport was efficient and good quality education and libraries were available for working people. All the addresses at which Scott lived in his youth were demolished in the early 1960s slum clearances to make way for new council estates, but it should be remembered that many of these buildings were known to be repairable, so that [...] "slum" [...] was often a misnomer.|$|R

At the same time, Miss Everdene {{has a right}} to be her own baily if she choose--and to keep me down to be a common shepherd only."

60|$|That night I slept badly. In {{the morning}} I was first-comer {{to the bridge}} as I lived nearest. I hid my books in the long grass near the <b>ashpit</b> {{at the end of}} the garden where nobody ever came and hurried along the canal bank. It was a mild sunny morning in the first week of June. I sat up on the coping of the bridge admiring my frail canvas shoes which I had {{diligently}} pipeclayed overnight and watching the docile horses pulling a tramload of business people up the hill. All the branches of the tall trees which lined the mall were gay with little light green leaves and the sunlight slanted through them on to the water. The granite stone of the bridge was beginning to be warm and I began to pat it with my hands in time to an air in my head. I was very happy.|$|E
6000|$|The {{maltster}} {{cleared his}} throat in an exaggerated form for emphasis, and elongating {{his gaze to the}} remotest point of the <b>ashpit,</b> said, in the slow speech justifiable when the importance of a subject is so generally felt that any mannerism must be tolerated in getting at it, [...] "Well, I don't mind the year I were born in, but perhaps I can reckon up the places I've lived at, and so get it that way.

60|$|When {{the short}} days of winter came dusk fell {{before we had}} well eaten our dinners. When we met in the street the houses had grown sombre. The space of sky above us was the colour of ever-changing violet and towards it the lamps of the street lifted their feeble lanterns. The cold air stung us and we played till our bodies glowed. Our shouts echoed in the silent street. The career of our play brought us through the dark muddy lanes behind the houses where we ran the {{gauntlet}} of the rough tribes from the cottages, to the back doors of the dark dripping gardens where odours arose from the <b>ashpits,</b> to the dark odorous stables where a coachman smoothed and combed the horse or shook music from the buckled harness. When {{we returned to the}} street light from the kitchen windows had filled the areas. If my uncle was seen turning the corner we hid in the shadow until we had seen him safely housed. Or if Mangan's sister came out on the doorstep to call her brother in to his tea we watched her from our shadow peer up and down the street. We waited to see whether she would remain or go in and, if she remained, we left our shadow and walked up to Mangan's steps resignedly. She was waiting for us, her figure defined by the light from the half-opened door. Her brother always teased her before he obeyed and I stood by the railings looking at her. Her dress swung as she moved her body and the soft rope of her hair tossed from side to side.|$|R
30|$|Sites of the Baodun culture {{constitute}} a lynchpin for understanding how rice agriculture moved into Southwest China as they contain {{some of the}} earliest archaeobotanical evidence for this region as a whole. The sites of the Baodun culture appear suddenly on the Chengdu Plain at around 2700 BC. Even the earliest sites of this culture exhibit signs of developed social complexity. The remains of around ten walled sites pertaining to the Baodun culture have been discovered, ranging from 7 – 245  ha in size (Chengdu Gongzuo 2001; Chengdu and Pixian 1999; Chengdu et al. 1998; Chengdu and Pixian 2001; Chengdu et al. 2000; He 2011; Yan and Jiang 1999; Zhongri 2001). Data from the Chengdu Plain Archaeological Survey project as well as recent excavations carried out by the Chengdu City Institute of Archaeology indicate that smaller scale settlements were also present alongside these larger walled enclosures (Chengdu Guoji 2010; Chengdu 2002, 2004 a, 2005 a, 2006 a, b, c, 2007; Chengdu and Pixian 2005; Chengdu and Xindu 2010). The scale of these enclosures and the labor required to build them hints at the beginnings of social complexity in the region. The type site of Baodun (2700 – 2100 BC) is surrounded by an interior and exterior wall and covers a total surface area of 245  ha, but the internal organization of these sites is still poorly understood. Large numbers of <b>ashpits</b> containing domestic refuse as well as a few wattle and daub houses have been unearthed. Installations unearthed at the site of Gucheng in Pixian county have been interpreted as serving a ritual function, suggesting that these walled sites may also have functioned as ritual centers (Chengdu and Pixian 2001).|$|R
5000|$|The {{purpose of}} a fogou is no longer known. Their central {{location}} in settlements and the work that evidently went into constructing them is indicative of their importance to the community. It has been conjectured that they were used for religious purposes, as refuges, or for food storage. Many are oriented south-west-north-east, facing the prevailing wind. Their use as refuge during raiding trips was first suggested by Darvill in his book 'Prehistoric Britain' (London: Batsford. 1987, page 177). An argument was put forward by Kenneth L MacGregor; was that they mainly served as refuges since food storage is impractical due to the damp conditions and ritual use is unlikely because the Celtic Druid tradition focused more on the living world. Both documentary and archaeological evidence support their use as refuges. Nancy Edwards wrote that [...] "evidence would support this: creeps, hidden chambers and sally-ports, {{as well as the}} fact that most sonterrains were invisible above ground, would all have helped to provide protection in the case of sudden attack. They could, however, turn into death-traps if the aggression was prolonged." [...] Where they were open at both ends, a fogou could provide ideal conditions for food storage, especially the drying of meat or storage of dairy products such as milk, butter and cheese where natural moulds would assist in preservation of perishable foodstuffs. <b>Ashpits</b> found at Trewardreva and in the circular side-chamber at Carn Euny were probably for preserving gulls' eggs, as was done on Saint Kilda in Scotland. A layer of black greasy mould with charcoal, animals and bird bones at Treveneague is also very suggestive of food storage. Diodorus Siculus stated that Iron Age people in Britain stored their grain in [...] "underground repositories", adding contemporary evidence [...] to the speculation that they were mainly used for food storage. Excavated examples at Halliggye, Carn Euny and Boden suggest fogous may have been deliberately filled after use or upon abandonment of the associated settlements.|$|R

The ash and cinders were left in the pit until it was emptied. This was either carried out by hand or with a hoist (Schrägaufzug) (see photograph right). By this means, the ash was shovelled into trolleys, which were lifted and tipped into a wagon that then transport the ash away.|$|E

50|$|During {{the final}} {{kilometres}} {{to the terminal}} station the fireman began to prepare for disposal (Abrüsten) by letting the fire slowly burn down depending on demands of the route. After the train {{had arrived at the}} terminus, the fireman turned off the train heating and the locomotive was uncoupled from the wagons. Then the locomotive was returned to the Betriebswerk, where it first went to the coaling plant, where its coal was replenished. Next the engine proceeded to the <b>ashpit</b> where the boiler was cleaned out by the shed workers (Betriebsarbeiter). This involved emptying the ash and clinker from the smokebox and grate into an <b>ashpit</b> sunk between the tracks. This was a particularly dirty job. After completely cleaning out the boiler the engine was run to the water cranes, where the engine's water tanks were refilled. The next stop was the sanding point. At smaller Betriebswerke, refilling the sanders was manual work using buckets and ladders.|$|E

After the train arrives, passengers deboard the train and the crew backs the train down to the wye for servicing. An <b>ashpit</b> was recently constructed for use and to aid in heavier repairs if needed, which do happen on occasion. After shoving the train uptown for boarding passengers, the engineer will oil and inspect the engine once again and the crew will perform another brake test for the return trip to Durango.|$|E
50|$|The Bolsover Colliery Company {{acquired}} ten {{acres of}} land in Creswell from the Duke of Portland {{on which to build}} a village to house its colliery employees. The village comprises 280 cottages built in two circles, an inner and an outer, around a large green with shrubberies and a bandstand. The inner-circle cottages faced the green and their back yards faced those of the outer circle. All the houses were of two storeys and had five or six rooms and were lit by electricity. All the houses had small front gardens facing either the green or surrounding the outer circle. Between the circles was a 15 yard road with a tram track used to transport coal to the colliers' cellars. In the back yards were enclosed <b>ashpit</b> lavatories that were emptied weekly at night by staff employed by the colliery company. The night soil was taken away on the tram line.|$|E
50|$|Depending on the park's {{operating}} schedule, {{the general}} timetable for departing trains begin {{an hour and}} a half after opening, and the final run one hour before the park closes. The fireman will report to work about three hours before departure, and will begin inspections. The track is inspected each morning, and the locomotive is serviced by removing the stack gag, opening all operating valves to appliances to test their operation, as well as blowing down the sight glasses, cleaning the banked fire, cleaning the smokebox cinder bonnet, refilling lubricators, cleaning the <b>ashpit,</b> coaling the tender, and a scrubbing down of locomotive and tender with soap and water. Once the engine has been serviced, the engineer or fireman will perform a hammer test on all pins, nuts, and wedges on the running gear and replace brake shoes and tighten up driving box wedges as necessary. The whole process usually takes 1½ hours to make the engine operational for the day, and the rest of the time is used to clean and make adjustments.|$|E
50|$|A private {{house in}} this {{neighbourhood}} rented at 4 a week {{was pointed out}} to me because its inmates had suffered a good deal of sickness, scarlet fever, measles, etc. Here in the back yard measuring about 10 ft by 5 ft I found that the privy was only separated from the scullery by a wall four and a half inches thick and that it stood nine inches higher than the scullery floor. By the privy and forming part of it was an open <b>ashpit</b> full of disgusting filth. The rain keeps this filth {{in a constant state of}} moisture, so that the excremental matter percolates through the rotting wall of the scullery, and yet against this wall there are shelves where cooking utensils are placed. On the morning of my visit, some potatoes, ready peeled for cooking, were piled up against that part of the wall which was permeated with the moisture from the privy. When it rains the amount of water coming through the wall from the privy and into the scullery is much greater and the scullery is only separated from the living room by a door which generally remains open.|$|E
