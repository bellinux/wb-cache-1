50|$|Black tea {{contains}} {{compounds that}} have low solubilities, {{which tend to}} bind together. The solution becomes cloudy and changes color to pale brown. This phenomenon is known as tea creaming. Research {{has shown that the}} cream is a colloidal substance that contains many of the compounds that contribute to color and flavor of black tea, and can contain up to 30% of the total solids. The driving force behind cream formation is the insolubility of theaflavin and polyphenols, which associate together through galloyl group interactions. The theaflavins have acidic properties which cause them to have a negative charge at the pH of black tea, which is roughly 4.9. Normally this would lead to electrostatic repulsions between the molecules, stabilizing the colloid. However, the presence of calcium ions (Ca2+) can neutralize these charges, promoting aggregation. Other charged metal ions, such as magnesium and aluminum, are also present in high concentrations in tea, but neither ions partition as well into tea as those of calcium. Glycosylation of the solution is also found to increase solubility of polyphenols while weakening self association. The proposed explanation is that the sheer size of the sugar makes it hard for other molecules to interact with each other. In the American market, instant tea is expected by the consumer to be clear when reconstituted, which makes the cream an unacceptable part of the solution. Industrially, a variety of methods have been patented to deal with the issue, such as the utilization of tannase to solubilize the cream. Another method developed was based on the identification of two classes in cream: low molecular weight compounds such as the polyphenols that contribute to flavor, and higher molecular weight compounds such as polysaccharides, polypeptides, and proteins. This process removes the high molecular weight compounds through ultrafiltration, <b>absorption</b> <b>chromatography</b> or oil filtration. The flavor compounds remain and do not cream.|$|E

Both techniques allow for the facile introduction of chemical functionalities into a polymer midchain position and hence provide an attractive synthetic avenue for the construction of complex macromolecular architectures. Such a strategy is evidenced by the efficient use of polystyrene and poly(isobornyl acrylate) featuring an alkoxyamine midchain function in polymer-polymer conjugation reactions with azide-terminated polymers, yielding 3 -arm star (co) polymers via the Cu-catalyzed alkyne/azide cycloaddition reactions.

Landings of shrimp in Santos in 1964 equaled 13 % of the total landing, by weight, while economically it is the principal fishery. I- Blackening was effectively prevented by dipping the shrimp in cooled chemical solution for 30 minutes and then storing them at loW temperatures.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we report studies {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} contribution of seminal prostaglandins {{to some of the}} known immunosuppressive properties of human seminal plasma. Initial studies revealed that fractions of seminal plasma enriched in E series prostaglandins, obtained by reverse phase chromatography, had a pronounced inhibitory effect on the PHA-induced proliferation of peripheral blood lymphocytes and on the NK-cell-mediated lysis of K 562 target cells. Additional investigations revealed that similar inhibitory effects could be achieved with purified PGE 2 (10 (- 6) to 10 (- 9) M) and 19 -OH PGE 1 (10 (- 6) to 10 (- 7) M), both of which are present in uniquely high concentrations in human seminal plasma. In contrast, 19 -OH PGF 1 which is found in lower concentrations in semen was slightly stimulatory in proliferative assays and had no effect on NK-cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Removal of the seminal prostaglandins by <b>absorption</b> <b>chromatography</b> resulted in a dramatic decrease in immune suppressive activity. Further studies with fractions obtained by ion-exchange HPLC of desalted seminal plasma indicated that prostaglandins complexed with seminal proteins, and these too were immunosuppressive.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to test for {{expression}} of a 900 -bp open reading frame (ORF), ORF 3, located at the 5 ' end of the mycocerosic acid synthase gene in Mycobacterium bovis BCG and to determine the nature of the ORF 3 protein. ORF 3 was expressed as a 61 -kDa C-terminal fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase in Escherichia coli. Polyclonal rabbit antiserum, prepared against this fusion protein, cross-reacted with a 65 -kDa protein in M. bovis BCG crude extracts. Since this protein was larger than that predicted from the nucleotide sequence (32 kDa), ORF 3 was resequenced, revealing an ORF of 1, 749 bp that encodes a 64. 8 -kDa protein containing 583 amino acids. Reverse transcription-PCR revealed that ORF 3 is expressed in M. bovis BCG. The ORF 3 product has a high degree of similarity to the acyladenylate family of enzymes. Immunoaffinity <b>absorption</b> <b>chromatography</b> was used to isolate the 65 -kDa cross-reacting protein from M. bovis BCG. This purified protein catalyzed coenzyme A (CoA) ester synthesis of n-C 10 to n-C 18 fatty acids but not mycocerosic acids. ORF 3 antibodies severely inhibited acyl-CoA synthase activities of the purified protein and extracts of M. bovis BCG, Mycobacterium smegmatis, and E. coli. They also showed immunological cross-reactivity with proteins in these extracts. Both the ORF 3 protein and the acyl-CoA synthase activity were located in the cell cytosol or were loosely associated with the cell membrane.

40|$|Despite {{recombinant}} protein technology development, proteins isolated from natural sources remain important for structure and activity determination. Ficolins represent {{a class of}} proteins {{that are difficult to}} isolate. To date, three methods for purifying ficolin- 3 from plasma/serum have been proposed, defined by most critical step: (i) hydroxyapatite <b>absorption</b> <b>chromatography</b> (ii) N-acetylated human serum albumin affinity chromatography and (iii) anti-ficolin- 3 monoclonal antibody-based affinity chromatography. We present a new protocol for purifying ficolin- 3 complexes from human plasma that is based on an exclusive ligand: the O-specific polysaccharide of Hafnia alvei PCM 1200 LPS (O-PS 1200). The protocol includes (i) poly(ethylene glycol) precipitation; (ii) yeast and l-fucose incubation, for depletion of mannose-binding lectin; (iii) affinity chromatography using O-PS 1200 -Sepharose; (iv) size-exclusion chromatography. Application of this protocol yielded average 2. 2 mg of ficolin- 3 preparation free of mannose-binding lectin (MBL), ficolin- 1 and - 2 from 500 ml of plasma. The protein was complexed with MBL-associated serine proteases (MASPs) and was able to activate the complement in vitro. In-process monitoring of MBL, ficolins, and total protein content revealed the presence of difficult-to-remove immunoglobulin G, M and A, in some extent in agreement with recent findings suggesting crosstalk between IgG and ficolin- 3. We demonstrated that recombinant ficolin- 3 interacts with IgG and IgM in a concentration-dependent manner. Although this association does not appear to influence ficolin- 3 -ligand interactions in vitro, it may have numerous consequences in vivo. Thus our purification procedure provides Ig-ficolin- 3 /MASP complexes that might be useful for gaining further insight into the crosstalk and biological activity of ficolin- 3...|$|E

The reactions for specific functional groups were also performed. In the integuments of the sea bream, the existence of α-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, α-doradexanthin, 3, 3 '-dihydroxy-ε-carotene and astaxanthin was confirmed. In the internal organs β-carotene, echinenone, lutein, zeaxanthin, 3, 3 '-dihydroxy-ε-carotene and astaxanthin were found. In the integuments of the red sea bream, the existence of α-cryptoxanthin, 3, 3 '-dihydroxy-ε-carotene, lutein (trace), zeaxanthin, 3 -hydroxycanthaxanthin and astaxanthin were clarified. In the internal organs, canthaxnthin, lutein, astaxanthin and P_E- 518 were found. The carotenoids in the sea bream and the red sea bream were compared, and the most conspicuous differences among them, the sea bream contains lutein besides astaxanthin in the integuments, on the contrary, the red sea bream contains the traces. It is very interesting that the bright red color of the sea bream comes from the mixture of astaxanthin (red color), lutein (yellow) and α-doradexanthin (trace). It was confirmed that the sea bream and the red sea bream could not convert β-carotene to astaxanthin by feeding β-carotene- 15, 15 '-^ 3 H_ 2, but they could transfer astaxanthin in the diet to their body astaxanthin. The carotenoids in Kinmedai, Beryx splendes Lowe, Amadai, Branchiostegus japonicus, and Akahana, Cephalopholis aurantius, were also extracted, isolated and the metabolic pathway from plant carotenoids to astaxanthin was proposed. When the results and those of previous studies are taken together, consistent patterns are seen. Thus aquatic animals are divided into three classes {{on the basis of}} where astaxanthin is biosynthesized as follows : 1. Prawn-Form, 2. Sea bream-Form, 3. Red carp-Form. Prawn-Form ― The aquatic animals, which belong to this group, can convert β-carotene to their body astaxanthin. Almost all crustacea which contain astaxanthin in their body belong to this group. Prawn, lobster and crab belong to this group. Sea bream-Form ― Can not convert β-carotene, lutein or zeaxanthin to astaxanthin, and can transfer astaxanthin in the diet to body astaxanthin. These animals are carnivorous, and half digested crustacea were found in their stomach. Sea bream (Madai), red sea bream (Chidai), Amadai, Kinmedai and Akahana belong to this group. Red carp-Form ― Can convert lutein or zeaxanthin to astaxanthin, but β-carotene is not the major precursor of astaxanthin. They can transfer astaxanthin in the diet to body astaxanthin. These animals contain α-doradexanthin. Gold fish, red carp, fancy red carp, yellow-golden carp, and Benibuna belong to this group...|$|E

Both these antisera also neutralized virus in vitro in the absense of complement. All three antisera were also shown to react with the nuclear and plasma membranes of infected fibroblasts by indirect immunoperoxidase immunobinding assays. Rabbit antisera raised against HCMV induced plasma membrane proteins of 54, 62 and 94 kDa, guinea pig monospecific polyclonal antisera reactive with the gB virion envelope proteins 55 / 130 kDa, and monoclonal antibodies specific for the virion gB complex, 15 D 8 (Rasmussen et al., 1985), C H 28 - 2 (Pereira et al., 1984), 7 - 17 (Britt et al., 1985) and α 52 (Farrar and Greenaway, 1986) were used to assess the antigenic association of virion envelope proteins and HCMV induced and normal plasma membrane proteins. Immunoblot and immnoprecipitation analyses of HCMV induced plasma membrane proteins with anti- 54, 62 and 94 kDa sera indicated that HCMV induced plasma membrane proteins of 54, 62 and 94 kDa were antigenically related and reacted with HMWC 2 ̆ 7 S of 130 - 150 and 500 kDa in plasma membrane preparations from infected fibroblasts. Anti- 54 kDa sera was shown to be virus specific wheras anti- 62 and anti-kDa sera demonstrated a low affinity for host cell proteins although a HMWC of 140 could possibly be virus specific. HMWC 2 ̆ 7 s of 130 - 150 kDa, also reported for the virion gB glycoprotein complex, were detected when HCMV induced plasma membrane proteins were immunoprecipitated with monospecific polyclonal sera 4 PP and 6 PP and Mab 15 D 8 and analysed under non reducing gel conditions. Serum 4 PP and Mab 15 D 8 were highly virus specific whereas serum 6 PP cross reacted with low affinity to host cell proteins. Plasma membrane preparations of HCMV infected and uninfected fibroblasts immunnoprecipitat ed with Mabs 15 D 8, 7 - 17, CH 28 - 2 and analysed by reducing SDS PAGE and fluorography showed that proteins of similar M.

B. sphaericus IFO 3525, in which the enzyme is most abundant, was chosen to study the enzyme reaction. The enzyme was not induced {{by the addition of}} meso-alpha-epsilon-diaminopimelate to the growth medium. The reaction product was isolated and identified as alpha-amino-epsilon-ketopimelate by a comparison of the properties of its 2, 4 -dinitrophenylhydrazone with those of an authentic sample in silica gel thin-layer <b>chromatography,</b> <b>absorption,</b> infrared and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry, and elemental analyses. The alpha-amino-epsilon-ketopimelate formed enzymatically was decarboxylated by H 2 O 2 to yield L-alpha-aminoadipate. This suggests that the amino group with D-configuration in the substrate is oxidatively deaminated; the enzyme is a D-amino acid dehydrogenase. L-alpha-Amino-epsilon-ketopimelate undergoes spontaneous dehydration to the cyclic delta 1 -piperideine- 2, 6 -dicarboxylate. The enzyme reaction is reversible, and meso-alpha-epsilon-diaminopimelate was formed in the reductive amination of L-alpha-epsilon-ketopimelate...|$|R
40|$|Differences in {{glycosylation}} {{between the}} natural K- 1, 6 glucan- 6 -glucanohydrolase from Penicillium minioluteum and the heterologous protein {{expressed in the}} yeast Pichia pastoris were analyzed. Glycosylation profiling was carried out using fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis and amine <b>absorption</b> high-performance liquid <b>chromatography</b> (NH 2 -HPLC) in combination with matrix-assisted laser desorption-time of flight-mass spectrometry. Both microorganisms produce only oligomannosidic type structures, but the oligosaccharide population differs in both enzymes. The native enzyme has mainly short oligosaccharide chains ranging from Man 5 GlcNAc 2 to Man 9 GlcNAc 2, of which Man 8 GlcNAc 2 was the most represented oligosaccharide. The oligosaccharides linked to the protein produced in P. pastoris range from Man 7 GlcNAc 2 up to Man 14 GlcNAc 2, with Man 8 GlcNAc 2 and Man 9 GlcNAc 2 being the most abundant structures. In both enzymes the first glycosylation site (Asn 5) is always glycosylated. However, Asn 537 and Asn 540 are onl...|$|R
40|$|The genes C, C 2, R, A, A 2, Bz, Bz 2 and Pr are {{required}} {{for the formation of}} purple anthocyanin in the aleurone tissue of maize, and the recessive gene(s) result in non-purple (red, bronze and colorless). Aleurone extracts of recessive a and certain double recessive combinations were analyzed by paper <b>chromatography,</b> <b>absorption</b> spectra in the ultraviolet (UV) and infrared, mass spectra, and other analytical techniques. Homozygous recessive a tissue accumulates the flavonol, quercetin, while the double combinations a c and a r lack it, suggesting that dominant genes C and R {{are required}} for its formation and act prior to A in the synthesis of flavonols, as in the gene action sequence for anthocyanin synthesis. Dominant C-I inhibits the formation of quercetin, whereas Bz, Bz 2 and In do not affect its formation. These results suggest a close biogenetic relationship between quercetin and cyanidin- 3 -glucoside and also independently confirm the position of A in both sequences...|$|R
40|$|An {{outline of}} the history of {{chromatography}} is presented, reviewing briefly the existing theories. The theory of Jame sand Martin for gas liquid partition chromatography and the extension to their theory by Litlewood and porter are Derived. The equipment to investigate the variables involved in gas-liquid partition chromatography (GLPC) was built and a large number of experiments were performed to study these variables. An analysis of the data results in the verification of the conclusions of other investigators. Investigations at temperature below the freezing point of the fixed phase suggests the concurrent action of <b>absorption</b> and adsorption <b>chromatography</b> on solid surfaces. Data were taken to permit the calculation of equilibrium vaporization constants (K values) from GLPC measurements. The constants so obtained follow closely the predicted values taken from the charts. A column with spherical beads from 0. 07 to 0. 028 mm in diameter indicated that the Klinkenberg effect did not contribute to the separation of methane from propane and probably has no effect on the separation in practical columns. Preliminary investigations suggest the application of partition chromatographic principles to gas hydrate studies...|$|R
40|$|The decay {{processes}} in monuments, considered as interaction between building materials and environmental factors, presents a specific {{interest in the}} case of marine environment (Mediterranean), in mild climatic conditions. An extended monument, like the Medieval Fortress of Rhodes could be a characteristic example. It is constructed by a susceptible to salt decay biocalcareous porous stone which suffers mainly from salt crystallisation and hard carbonate crusts formation. The research program has been developed on walls of different typologies, according to their position and exposure orientation to various environmental factors, and specifically concerning humidity sources as capillary rise via ground and marine salt spray. Stone samples from different positions along the fortress, at various heights and depths on the walls, significant of the main decay patterns (alveolar, carbonate crust and mixed), underwent physical and chemical examination. Humidity and soluble salts' concentration measurements by Atomic <b>Absorption</b> Spectroscopy, Ionic <b>Chromatography</b> and specific conductivity allow the assessment of their distribution patterns on the masonries. Hence from the correlation between environmental factors and the material properties, directions for a conservation plan might be derived...|$|R
40|$|Abstract　The recent {{analytical}} results obtained in our laboratory for monitoring {{the quality of}} Matsukawa river and groundwaters in the Yonezawa territory are summarized. The concentrations of typical cations and anions as well as chlorinated hydrocarbons were determined by atomic <b>absorption</b> spectrometry, ion <b>chromatography</b> and gas chromatography. The high levels of hydrogen and sulfate ion concentrations in the river water were observed at the upper streams of Matsukawa river, where closed sulfer mine had been located. An increase of hydrogen and sulfate ions is due to air oxidation of ore residues and their subsequent dissolution in running water, which deteriorates the quality of rivdr waters. The discharge of polluted water into the boreholes (depth: 80 m) significantly contributed to the remediation of water quality. Using analytical data on ground water, the distribution patterns of four elements (Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, Cl- and SO 42 -) were mapped. This profile is useful to estimate the flow direction of groundwater. The pollution of groundwater by chlorinated hydrocarbons was demonstrated in {{the central part of}} the city. Thus, in 1994, tetrachloroethylene and trichloroethylene were detected 11 and 27 out of the 50 samples analyzed, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Until recently, {{atmospheric}} {{carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) and methane (CH 4) measurements were made almost exclusively using nondispersive infrared (NDIR) <b>absorption</b> and gas <b>chromatography</b> with flame ionisation detection (GC/FID) techniques, respectively. Recently, commercially available instruments based on spectroscopic {{techniques such as}} cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS), off-axis integrated cavity output spectroscopy (OA-ICOS) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy have become more widely available and affordable. This resulted in a widespread use of these techniques at many measurement stations. This paper {{is focused on the}} comparison between a CRDS "travelling instrument" that has been used during performance audits within the Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) programme of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) with instruments incorporating other, more traditional techniques for measuring CO 2 and CH 4 (NDIR and GC/FID). We demonstrate that CRDS instruments and likely other spectroscopic techniques are suitable for WMO/GAW stations and allow a smooth continuation of historic CO 2 and CH 4 time series. Moreover, the analysis of the audit results indicates that the spectroscopic techniques have a number of advantages over the traditional methods which will lead to the improved accuracy of atmospheric CO 2 and CH 4 measurements...|$|R
