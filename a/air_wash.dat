These precautions aid in the prevention of pneumonia after suffering influenza. • Cooperation in these ways will lessen the necessary period of quarantine and eliminate the threat of epidemic in BuffaloNewspaper article 4...|$|E
40|$|AIM: {{to compare}} the {{feasibility}} and patients' tolerance of esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) using a thin endoscope with those of conventional oral EGD and to determine the optimal route of introduction of small-caliber endoscopes. METHODS: One hundred and sixty outpatients referred for diagnostic EGD were randomly allocated to 3 groups: conventional (C) -EGD (9. 8 mm in diameter), transnasal (TN) -EGD and transoral (TO) -EGD (5. 9 mm in diameter). Pre-EGD anxiety was measured using a 100 -mm visual analogue scale (VAS). After EGD, patients and endoscopists completed a questionnaire on the pain, nausea, choking, overall discomfort, {{and quality of the}} examination either using VAS or answering some questions. The duration of EGD was timed. Blood oxygen saturation (SaO 2) and heart rate (HR) were monitored during EGD. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients refused to participate in the study. The 3 groups were well-matched for age, gender, experience with EGD, and anxiety. EGD was completed in 91. 1 % (41 / 45), 97. 5 % (40 / 41), and 96. 2 % (51 / 53) of cases in TN-EGD, TO-EGD, and C-EGD groups, respectively. TN-EGD lasted longer (3. 11 +/- 1. 60 min) than TO-EGD (2. 25 +/- 1. 45 min) and C-EGD (2. 49 +/- 1. 64 min) (P< 0. 05). The overall tolerance was higher (P< 0. 05) and the overall discomfort was lower (P< 0. 05) in TN-EGD group than in C-EGD group. EGD was tolerated "better than expected" in 73. 2 % of patients in TN-EGD group and 55 % and 39. 2 % of patients in TO-EGD and C-EGD groups, respectively (P< 0. 05). Endoscopy was tolerated "worst than expected" in 4. 9 % of patients in TN-EGD group and 17. 5 % and 23. 5 % of patients in TO-EGD and C-EGD groups, respectively (P< 0. 05). TN-EGD caused mild epistaxis in one case. The ability to insufflate <b>air,</b> <b>wash</b> the lens, and suction of the thin endoscope were lower than those of conventional instrument (P< 0. 001). All biopsies performed were adequate for histological assessment. CONCLUSION: Diagnostic TN-EGD is better tolerated than C-EGD. Narrow-diameter endoscope has a level of diagnostic accuracy comparable to that of conventional gastroscope, even though some technical characteristics of these instruments should be improved. Transnasal EGD with narrow-diameter endoscope should be proposed to all patients undergoing diagnostic EGD...|$|E
