60|$|<b>At</b> <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not know}} how to address my nice white parcel, for I never had heard the child's name. But after {{thinking}} over the matter, I remembered that she was the only girl there with yellow curls hanging down her back, so I decided to risk the cake with the above direction.|$|E
60|$|On several {{occasions}} Jan had sent animals to be doctored by this Sihamba, for {{she would not}} come out to attend to them whatever fee was offered to her. <b>At</b> <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not approve of it, but as she always cured the animals, whatever their ailments might be, I gave in on the matter.|$|E
6000|$|A silence, {{and then}} Miss Ponsonby said, 'After all, my dear, though I thought quite {{otherwise}} <b>at</b> <b>first,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> believe that, considering what the youth is, {{and how much}} attached he seems, you might safely continue the engagement.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They wanted to, {{but were}} poor and had {{forgotten}} {{the exact location of}} the island where the treasure was hidden. Bahama Jack was a happy go lucky sort of a sailor and he came to this country and worked for a while on a lumber schooner running from Florida to Boston. Doranez also came to this country, but where he kept himself <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not in the least. Any one who {{addresses}} her must {{be prepared}} to explain himself fully. Nor ought he to hope to get much encouragement <b>at</b> <b>first.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not think that Lady Mary will bestow her heart till she is sure she can give it with safety." [...] There was an amount of falsehood in this which was proof at any rate of very strong friendship on the part of Lady Cantrip.|$|R
6000|$|By [...] "we" [...] I {{mean the}} American passengers. The first welcome {{discovery}} among the crowd wandering aimlessly and somewhat disconsolately about the decks was the cheerful {{face of a}} friend whom <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not recognize because of his amazing disguise in uniform. Hitherto he had been associated in my mind with dinner parties and clubs.|$|E
6000|$|... "I have forgiven him," [...] Helen answered, smiling. [...] "Indeed, if I hadn't done so long since, {{it would}} be easy to forgive him now. <b>At</b> <b>first,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> feel dreadfully humiliated, but I soon saw what he had saved me from. And, of course, if he had kept his promise, I could not have married you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There she is, Miss Mary," [...] said Joe, {{pointing}} {{out of the}} window, his whole face in a glow, between joy and whiskey. [...] "It should be told to the deacon at once, that his last hours might be happier than some that he has passed lately. That's she--though, <b>at</b> <b>first,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not know her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{ought to}} have told me <b>at</b> <b>first,</b> Walter. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not blame you, but you should not do things on your own responsibility." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ben-Ahmed, I {{told you}} the truth <b>at</b> <b>first.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not {{know where she is}} hiding. <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> indeed, know some time ago, but the place of her abode has been changed, and <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know now. I may as well however say at once that, if <b>I</b> <b>did</b> know, nothing that you can do would induce me to tell you where she hides. You may imprison, torture, or slay me if you choose, but in regard to Hester Sommers I am from this moment dumb!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't <b>at</b> <b>first,</b> but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> now. <b>I</b> {{begin to}} {{understand}} her, and, besides, I feel in myself certain things that are in her, though I think I am more like the Wetherfords. My father's family home was in Maryland." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I wasn't {{sure about}} her. Your aunt {{recommended}} her, and I {{thought you might}} not like--and <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not know what things ought to cost, nor how long they ought to last, {{and that was what}} I did sums for. Then when I did prove it, I saw only dishonesty in the kitchen, and extravagance and mismanagement of my own.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Next {{moment we}} were round the turn {{and on a}} broad and grassy slope. And then I yelled. My men came running back to me in great alarm. It seems that <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> nothing but shout, 'She has given the child into my hands! She has given the child into my hands!' The escort thought I had gone mad." ...|$|E
60|$|To {{tell the}} truth, {{although}} I had been alarmed <b>at</b> <b>first,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not particularly regret what had happened. At any rate, it saved me the bother of {{going over to}} the police-station at Mellborough. Still, the thought that he might even now be lurking about in the vicinity, with plenty of opportunities to provide a weapon for himself, was not altogether a pleasant one.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} I am {{focusing}} on oeuvre of German artist Thomas Demand. <b>At</b> <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> so <b>at</b> {{the level of}} his method {{and in the second}} part I discuss three different readings of his work. The purpose of this work is to present Demand`s oeuvre in coherent context and to discuss and synthesize different interpretational readings with greater focus on relation between Demands work and reality, that is representation, and the viewer with his perception of Demand`s photographs. I identify the moment associating the motifs of absence, closedness and interiority, which are common to all interpretations, as crucial to Demand`s work. I propose to read Demand`s photographs as anticipating principles of the digital image thus the photography...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why is it impossible?" [...] Newman demanded. [...] "You {{may think}} it is, <b>at</b> <b>first,</b> without its really being so. I didn't {{expect you to}} be pleased <b>at</b> <b>first,</b> but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{believe that if you}} will think of it a good while, you may be satisfied." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{came home}} from Mr. Boythorn's after six {{pleasant}} weeks. We were often {{in the park and}} in the woods and seldom passed the lodge where we had taken shelter without looking in to speak to the keeper's wife; but we saw no more of Lady Dedlock, except at church on Sundays. There was company at Chesney Wold; and although several beautiful faces surrounded her, her face retained the same influence on me as <b>at</b> <b>first.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not quite know even now whether it was painful or pleasurable, whether it drew me towards her or made me shrink from her. I think I admired her with a kind of fear, and I know that in her presence my thoughts always wandered back, as they had done <b>at</b> <b>first,</b> to that old time of my life.|$|R
6000|$|<b>At</b> <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not {{grasp the}} fact that he was dying. The [...] "year to two" [...] of life that Washburn had allowed to him had somehow become {{converted}} in my mind to vague years, a fate with no immediate meaning; the meanwhile he himself appeared to grow from day to day in buoyancy. How could I know it was his great heart rising to his need.|$|E
60|$|So {{the steam}} would escape {{generally}} easily, and {{would only make}} a passing rattle, like the earthquake of which the famous jester Charles Selwyn {{said that it was}} quite a young one, so tame that you might have stroked it; like that which I myself once felt in the Pyrenees, which gave me very solemn thoughts after a while, though <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> nothing but laugh at it; and I will tell you why.|$|E
60|$|Its {{motion was}} so swift, complex, and perfect that <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not see it}} as a machine, in spite of its {{metallic}} glitter. The fighting-machines were coordinated and animated to an extraordinary pitch, but nothing to compare with this. People who have never seen these structures, and have only the ill-imagined efforts of artists or the imperfect descriptions of such eye-witnesses as myself to go upon, scarcely realise that living quality.|$|E
6000|$|The {{girl looked}} away from him. [...] "I was {{not good enough to}} {{understand}} its value <b>at</b> <b>first,</b> and when <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> tried to make you take it back." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! not handsome--not at all handsome. I {{thought him}} very plain <b>at</b> <b>first,</b> but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not think him so plain now. One does not, you know, after a time. But did {{you never see}} him? He is in Highbury every now and then, and he is sure to ride through every week in his way to Kingston. He has passed you very often." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have agreed. <b>I</b> thought <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>I</b> couldn't <b>do</b> {{it without}} getting her into trouble about that second marriage, and I don't want to injure {{her in any}} way. Perhaps she's no worse than I am, after all! But nobody knows about it over here, and I find {{it will not be}} a {{difficult}} proceeding at all. If she wants to start afresh I have only too obvious reasons for not hindering her." ...|$|R
60|$|Why does Otto seem {{to avoid}} me? Has he some secret sorrow that I cannot share? To-day {{he moved his}} camp-stool {{to the other side}} of the meadow. He was in the long grass behind an {{elderberry}} bush. <b>At</b> <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not see him. I thought that he had hanged himself. But he said no. He had forgotten to get a rope. He had tried, he said, to shoot himself. But he had missed himself.|$|E
6000|$|She {{looked at}} him incredulously. [...] "And yet they were sitting close together," [...] she said; [...] "so close that <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not see her; {{apparently}} talking in the most private manner in a very public place. They surely looked very much like an engaged couple as I have noticed them. And old Jane has told me that everybody knows {{she is trying to}} trap him; and surely {{there is good reason to}} believe that she has succeeded." ...|$|E
60|$|As Senor Altascar {{rose with}} well-bred gravity to receive us, George {{advanced}} {{with such a}} heightened color, and such a blending of tenderness and respect in his manner, that I was touched to the heart by so much devotion in the careless youth. In fact, my eyes were still dazzled by {{the effect of the}} outer sunshine, and <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not see the white teeth and black eyes of Pepita, who slipped into the corridor as we entered.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{then the}} men come. They all have guns-rifles, shotguns, revolvers, pistols. And <b>I</b> think, <b>first,</b> {{that justice is}} very quick in the United States. Only just now have I kicked {{a man in the}} head, and, one-two-three, just like that, men come with guns to take me to jail for kicking a man in the head. <b>At</b> <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not understand. The many men are angry with me. They call me names, and say bad things; but they do not arrest me. Ah! I begin to understand! I hear them talk about three {{thousand}} dollars. I have robbed them of three thousand dollars. It is not true. I say so. I say never have I robbed a man of one cent. Then they laugh. And I feel better and I understand better. The three thousand dollars is the reward of the Government for this man I have tied up with my belt and my bandana. And the three thousand dollars is mine because I kicked the man in the head and tied his hands and his feet.|$|R
60|$|Accordingly I dug up a {{piece of}} ground, as well as I could, with my wooden spade, and {{dividing}} it into two parts, I sowed my grain; but as I was sowing, it casually occurred to my thought, that I would not sow it all <b>at</b> <b>first,</b> because <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not know when was the proper time for it; so I sowed about two thirds of the seeds, leaving about a handful of each.|$|R
6000|$|... "My child," [...] said he, [...] "I {{want you}} to go. Of course, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not take to the notion <b>at</b> <b>first,</b> but <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not {{consider}} then what {{you will have to}} tell when you come home. The people of Glenford will be your everlasting debtors. It might be a good thing to invite Maria Port out here. You could give her the best time she ever had in her life, telling her about the Broadstone people." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{librarian}} now {{stepped up}} to me, and demanded whether I had a card of admission. <b>At</b> <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not comprehend him, but I soon found that the library {{was a kind of}} literary [...] "preserve," [...] subject to game-laws, and that no one must presume to hunt there without special license and permission. In a word, I stood convicted of being an arrant poacher, and was glad to make a precipitate retreat, lest I should have a whole pack of authors let loose upon me.|$|E
60|$|As I drew nearer I {{perceived}} he {{was dressed}} in clothes as dusty and filthy as my own; he looked, indeed, as though he had been dragged through a culvert. Nearer, I distinguished the green slime of ditches mixing with the pale drab of dried clay and shiny, coaly patches. His black hair fell over his eyes, and his face was dark and dirty and sunken, so that <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not recognise him. There was a red cut across the lower part of his face.|$|E
60|$|Clarke {{led us to}} {{the rim of the}} canyon. Without any preparation--for {{the giant}} trees hid the open sky--we rode right out {{to the edge of the}} {{tremendous}} chasm. <b>At</b> <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not seem to think; my faculties were benumbed; only the pure sensorial instinct of the savage who sees, but does not feel, made me take note of the abyss. Not one of our party had ever seen the canyon from this side, and not one of us said a word. But Clarke kept talking.|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{mother took}} a little village shop, and I went to the village school. <b>At</b> <b>first,</b> <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not work very hard; but {{fortunately}} there was a change in masters, and the new one turned {{out one of the}} best friends a boy ever had. He pushed me on greatly and, when I was apprenticed to a mill wright, he urged me to continue my education by working of an evening. I stuck to it hard, and with his help learned, therefore, a good deal more than was usual, in my station of life. My mother was always particular about my speaking and, what with that and the books, I suppose I talk better than they generally do." ...|$|R
6000|$|But no; there lies At {{times in}} their tune A note that cries What <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>I</b> fear <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not hear: [...] "O we {{remember}} At each wind's hollo - Though life holds yet - We go hence soon, For 'tis November; - But that you follow You may forget!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I fancied so two {{or three}} times, Edgar, but I am by no means {{sure that it is}} not fancy. I felt more sure of it <b>at</b> <b>first</b> than <b>I</b> <b>do</b> now, for there is a slight mist rising from the water. If they don't come out to us by the {{afternoon}} we will go in and have a look at them. We have got half a dozen sweeps on board, and with those and the boats we could work her in in a couple of hours." ...|$|R
