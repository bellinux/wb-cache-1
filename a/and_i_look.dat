25|$|Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama congratulated Trump, {{while also}} taking the {{opportunity}} to emphasise that action on climate change is a priority for Fiji: Fiji has {{a close relationship with}} the United States <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> forward to working with you and your administration in the months and years ahead. We especially seek America's support in our struggle against the extreme weather events and rising sea levels caused by climate change, which pose a particular threat to the Pacific islands and other low lying areas of the world. We also look forward to working with you to protect our oceans and seas from the threat of pollution and overfishing. With every best wish as you prepare to assume the presidency.|$|E

On the contrary, if I fail the people would say 'Oh you are the son, {{but you are not}} like your father'. It's rather a burden." ...|$|E
500|$|Steven Aoun of PopMatters {{applauded the}} way the episode [...] "focuses on two popular {{supporting}} characters, and foregrounds the relation between memory and identity." [...] Furthermore, the site noted that [...] "the sound that takes you by surprise may be your own crying." [...] Novelist Lev Grossman, {{in an interview with}} NPR, praised the backstory of the Ice King and the exploration of his condition, noting that his origin is [...] "psychologically plausible." [...] Grossman praised {{the way the}} series was able to tackle the issues of mental illness, saying: [...] "It's very affecting. My dad has been going through having Alzheimer's, and he's forgotten so much about who he used to be. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> at him and think this cartoon is about my father dying." ...|$|E

500|$|I {{remember}} {{not just}} because it was a win, but also because it was a big fight right into the last night. Fabrizia reminded me the other night that we had a problem with the brake pads, so we lost a lot of time. We finished three days rallying (with one day to go), night and day, 32 seconds in front of Ari Vatanen. We drove the last special stage for the night, came back to the hotel and I could not sleep at all, four hours {{in front of me and}} no sleep. Then I arrive at the special stage, it's about 42km long, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> at Fabrizia and I said [...] "OK, we forget everything, and we are at the first stage of the rally again, because one of us will crash." [...] And so Ari hit a rock, and we won the rally.|$|E
500|$|Among the Canadians, {{only two}} players were not suspended: goalie Jimmy Waite and forward Pierre Turgeon. [...] Waite {{felt he could}} not risk being ejected for {{fighting}} under {{the belief that the}} game would resume, and that the Canadian backup goaltender, Shawn Simpson, was injured. [...] Steve Nemeth would later apply for early reinstatement arguing that he was not fighting, but trying to help break the players apart. [...] Many of their teammates never forgave Turgeon for failing to defend his teammates. In the words of Everett Sanipass: [...] "I'm looking for someone to help (Stéphane) Roy out <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> over at the bench. [...] There's this dog Turgeon, just sitting there, with his head down. He wouldn't get his ass off the bench ... just sitting there when everyone's off the Soviet bench and at least one of our guys is in real trouble getting double-teamed." ...|$|E
500|$|Common became {{interested}} in the role due to both the script and the prospect of working with McAvoy, Jolie, and Morgan Freeman. Common learned a great deal about firearms as preparation for the role, but said he is not a strong supporter of guns in real life. Konstantin Khabensky, who starred in Bekmambetov's Night Watch, was cast so that the director would have a familiar face around. British television veteran Marc Warren agreed to work in the film because he always wanted to be in a Hollywood blockbuster. Thomas Kretschmann originally intended to pick up the comic series after being cast, but Bekmambetov convinced him not to. He said that he [...] "did excessive gun training" [...] to [...] "make sure I look good <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> like I know what I'm doing". Kristen Hager originally auditioned for Fox, but accepted the role of Cathy, considering it [...] "fun to play".|$|E

500|$|The most {{well-documented}} early European {{team was}} founded by activist Nettie Honeyball in England in 1894. It was named the British Ladies' Football Club. Nettie Honeyball is quoted, [...] "I founded the association late last year , with the fixed resolve of proving {{to the world that}} women are not the 'ornamental and useless' creatures men have pictured. I must confess, my convictions on all matters where the sexes are so widely divided are all on the side of emancipation, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> forward to the time when ladies may sit in Parliament and have a voice in the direction of affairs, especially those which concern them most." [...] Honeyball and those like her paved the way for women's football. However, the women's game was frowned upon by the British football associations, and continued without their support. It has been suggested that this was motivated by a perceived threat to the 'masculinity' of the game.|$|E
500|$|In December 2011, Jenkins {{exited the}} project, citing [...] "creative differences". She stated, [...] "I {{have had a}} great time working at Marvel. We parted on very good terms, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> forward to working with them again." [...] Jenkins felt she could not have made a good film [...] "out of Thor 2 because I wasn’t the right director... I could have made a great Thor if I could have done the story that I was wanting to do. But I don’t think I was the right person to make a great Thor out of the story they wanted to do." [...] Jenkins had {{intended}} to create a film based on the premise of Romeo and Juliet, where Jane was stuck on Earth with Thor forbidden to come save her. After Thor eventually does travel to Earth, he and Jane would have discovered that Malekith was [...] "hiding the dark energy inside of Earth because he knows that Odin doesn't care about Earth, and so he's using Odin's disinterest in Earth to trick him." ...|$|E
500|$|Recurring guest actors for {{the series}} Eugene Simon, Julian Glover, Roger Ashton-Griffiths, Finn Jones, and Ian Gelder, who portrayed Lancel Lannister, Pycelle, Mace Tyrell, Loras Tyrell, and Kevan Lannister, respectively, also made their final {{appearance}} in the series. Finn Jones, who was cast concurrently in the leading role for the upcoming television series Marvel's Iron Fist, spoke about his departure saying, [...] "I had been on Thrones for six years. It was yearly employment. Now I was at a crossroads and I had {{to think of what}} the future is. I was very blessed that something like this has come along at the right moment," [...] referring to Iron Fist. Eugene Simon also spoke about his learning of his departure, saying that the showrunners promised a [...] "huge scene" [...] for his character in the season finale, with Simon responding, [...] "for everything that you've done for the last six years, thank you. This is a wonderful way to go. I really, really appreciate it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> forward to doing it for you." ...|$|E

500|$|Like her 2000 studio album, Music, Madonna {{enlisted the}} help of French DJ and {{producer}} Mirwais Ahmadzaï. Always interested in adapting herself and her music to the contemporary compositions, Madonna was inspired by the new Massive Attack and Lemon Jelly albums. [...] "We set out to put the two worlds of acoustic and electronic music together," [...] said Madonna. [...] "It is another step on, but I've never wanted to repeat myself. I don't ever want to repeat myself or make the same record twice." [...] American Life became Madonna's final studio album with Maverick Records, and marked the end of an eleven-year recording history with the label. In an interview with VH1 titled Madonna Speaks, the singer discussed her 20 years in the music industry, and revealed her motivations behind American Life, about [...] "material things" [...] being unimportant. [...] "I have lots of 'material' things and I've had lots of beliefs about things and what's important, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> back at the 20 years behind me and I realized that {{a lot of things that}} I'd valued weren't important", she concluded. Discussing her thoughts on the conception of the album, she told Q magazine that through her 20 years of being in the entertainment industry, she would have a correct opinion on fame and fortune and its perils, which would be the base of the album.|$|E

2500|$|In 2011, {{to commemorate}} its centennial year, the synagogue planned {{a series of}} events. [...] Past {{president}} Jerry Einhorn said: “I think it’s absolutely wonderful we have reached our 100th year. It’s a beautiful synagogue, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> forward to its next 500 years.” That year marked Greene's 13th and final year as the congregation's rabbi.|$|E

2500|$|Stan was {{introduced}} {{as the father}} of established regular characters Shirley (Linda Henry), Tina (Luisa Bradshaw-White), and Mick Carter (Danny Dyer), although Mick was later revealed to be Stan's grandson. The casting of Timothy West was announced on 12 December 2013, when West commented, [...] "I am excited to be joining EastEnders for the first time. Stan is a wonderful character <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> forward to seeing {{what is going to happen}} to him." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{preparing}} {{for her own}} role, Allen did not consult real mothers of kidnapped children, but said she reflected on her own experiences [...] "in a mall when my daughter was little <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> around and within a flash she’s not there." [...] Canadian actor Tom McCamus originally auditioned for the part of Old Nick before being cast as Leo. The actors improvised some lines, with Donoghue saying they created [...] "speech patterns more natural-sounding than I could have written, and produced some brilliant new lines that {{ended up in the}} film." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Stuart Law was {{released}} by Lancashire in October 2008, after the season had ended, Chapple replaced him as captain. Speaking of his appointment, Chapple said [...] "it's a privilege to play for such a big county, and an even bigger honour to be captaining the club I've been involved with for the past 18 years. I'm {{a product of the}} Lancashire system, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> forward to leading a very talented squad of players to future success". Despite missing five County Championship matches of the 2009 season through injury, Chapple was named Lancashire's Championship Player of the Year.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2003, it was {{confirmed}} that Steve McFadden {{would be taking}} a year hiatus.

EastEnders will always be No1 in my heart <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> forward to returning to Albert Square." [...] Executive producer Louise Berridge went on to say that she was [...] "looking forward to Steve returning in 2004". In July 2004, it was announced that McFadden had delayed his return.
