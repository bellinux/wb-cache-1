The measurements include 3 -hourly synoptic observations as well as daily upper <b>air</b> <b>soundings.</b> The measurements started on September 6 1985 at Bremerhaven and were terminated at April 28 1986 in Punta Arenas. The 3 -hourly synoptic observations are performed following the instructions of the FM 13 ships code defined by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The datasets include automatic measurements such as mean ship's speed, wind velocity, wind direction, air temperature, water temperature as well as visual observations such as total cloud amount, present weather, clouds, height and period of swell waves, ice classification.

Also, conditions for the occurrence of derecho were characterized and destruction that it caused was described. Additionally, the ranges of the individual derecho cases enabled the determination of the most vulnerable areas of Poland to the occurrence of this phenomenon.
