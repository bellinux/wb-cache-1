At the outset, it is shown that tropical variability of lightning exhibits a prominent diurnal mode, much like rain. A comparison of the geographical distribution of {{the timing of the}} diurnal maximum shows that there is very good agreement between the two observables over continental and coastal regions throughout the tropics. Following this global tropical comparison, we focus on two regions, Borneo and equatorial South America, both of which show the interplay between oceanward and landward propagations of the phase of the diurnal maximum. Over Borneo, both rain and lightning clearly show a climatological cycle of ``breathing in'' (afternoon to early morning) and ``breathing out'' (morning to early afternoon). Over the equatorial east coast of South America, landward propagation is noticed in rain and lightning from early afternoon to early morning. Along the Pacific coast of South America, both rain and lightning show oceanward propagation. Though qualitatively consistent, over both regions the propagation is seen to extend further in rainfall. <b>Additionally,</b> <b>given</b> <b>that</b> lightning highlights vigorous convection, the timing of its diurnal maximum often precedes that of rainfall in the convective life cycle.

30|$|Because of {{the above}} reasons, many works have focused on {{reducing}} the amount of transmitted data at the encoder side and recovering it at the decoder side for low bit rate transmission [10 – 12]. <b>Additionally,</b> <b>given</b> <b>that</b> depth maps consist of large homogeneous areas, they require less transmission bit rate compared with texture [13]. Therefore, the reduction and recovery of texture data have drawn more attention than that of the depth data. In order to speed up the encoding process and reduce the overall bit rate, in [14], Garcia et. al adopted a low-resolution (LR) and full-resolution (FR) frames mixed video sequence. Based on this, a mixed resolution coding approach was proposed where the first M frames in the sequence were encoded at FR and the rest frames were coded at LR. Mixed resolution (MR) view frameworks have been proposed in [15, 16] for multiview video coding, where at least one view is coded at LR, while the others are coded at FR. These frameworks can reduce the amount of transmitted and stored data in comparison with the full FR framework. In [17, 18], a MR-MVD framework was adopted at the encoder side and 3 D warping-generated virtual views were utilized to recover FR frames from the LR frames at the decoder side. With proper reconstruction algorithms at the decoder side, MR-MVD framework can well enhance the overall transmission efficiency.|$|E

40|$|Although many {{riparian}} and semi-aquatic {{plant species}} disperse via water currents, {{little is known}} about how this process interacts with the landscape matrix. In mangroves, the dense aerial root network could act as a strong dispersal barrier for the morphologically diverse propagules found in these trees. In this study, we combined field and laboratory experiments to test the effect of root density, propagule morphology and hydrodynamic variables on retention rates and trajectories of the propagules of 4 common species. Overall, flume experiments showed that larger propagules were more frequently retained than smaller ones. For the larger propa gules, retention rates increased with increasing obstacle density in the landscape matrix. In elongated propagules, intraspecific variation was linked to floating orientation. Experimental wave action and increased water flow velocity reduced retention. Dispersal in the field was constrained by major tidal currents and experiments confirmed less retention of smaller propagules, which moved farther than larger ones. Overall, our results reveal that the pronounced morphological variation in mangrove propagules interacts with the landscape matrix, contributing to strong differences in dispersal capacity among species and morphotypes. These results may help to explain observed mangrove distribution patterns, including zonation at local, regional and global scales. <b>Additionally,</b> <b>given</b> <b>that</b> many mangrove biotopes are currently strongly threatened by human pressure and fragmentation, this information is important as an input variable for dispersal models that aim to predict dispersal patterns at multiple scales and species responses to environmental change.

In the present study, we asked whether nicotine effects on PM performance were attributable to a drug-induced non-specific increase in arousal. Therefore, a double-blind, placebo-controlled study compared the effect of nicotine {{to the effect of}} an arousal manipulation on PM performance. All participants were non-smokers; half received 1 mg nicotine via a nasal spray and half received a matched placebo. Within these groups, half of the volunteers were exposed to hard anagrams and exhibited heightened tense arousal, while half of the volunteers were given easy anagrams and showed no change in arousal. These manipulations resulted in four conditions, placebo/low-arousal (n= 12), placebo/high-arousal (n= 10), nicotine/low-arousal (n= 12), nicotine/high-arousal (n= 13). All participants completed an ongoing lexical decision task while maintaining a PM intention (to make a separate, non-focal, response to certain items embedded within the ongoing task). When introduced separately, both nicotine and high tense arousal improved PM performance, but when combined, this improvement was eliminated. It is argued that both nicotine and high tense arousal increase attentional resources, specifically improving monitoring of the PM targets, but when combined they no longer produce beneficial effects. <b>Additionally,</b> <b>given</b> <b>that</b> nicotine exerted no effect on physiological or subjective measures of arousal, we conclude that the observed effects of nicotine and of arousal on PM performance are driven by different pharmacological mechanisms. © 2008 Collegium Internationale Neuropsychopharmacologicum...|$|E

This study uses econometric estimation to explore how climate impacts Chinese pesticide usage and subsequently to project the future implications of climate change on pesticide use. The results indicate that both atmospheric temperature and precipitation increase pesticide usage. Under current climate change projections, pesticide usage will rise by + 1. 1 to 2. 5 % by 2040, + 2. 4 to 9. 1 % by 2070, and + 2. 6 to 18. 3 % by 2100. Linearly extrapolating the results to 2020 yields an approximately 0. 5 to 1. 2 % increase. Thus, to achieve stabilization, more severe actions are needed to address this increase. Possible actions to achieve the reductions needed include using better monitoring and early warning networks so as to permit early responses to climate change-stimulated increases, enhancing information dissemination, altering crop mix, and promoting nonchemical control means. <b>Additionally,</b> <b>given</b> <b>that</b> increased pesticide usage generally increases health and environmental damage, there may be a need to more widely disseminate safe application procedure information while also strengthening compliance with food safety regulations.

The greedy algorithm Greedy[d] of Azar et al. places each ball by probing d > 1 random bins and placing {{the ball in}} the least loaded of them. It ensures a maximum load that is exponentially better than the strategy of placing each ball uniformly at random. Vöcking showed that a slightly asymmetric variant, Left[d], provides a further significant improvement. However, this improvement comes at an additional computational cost of imposing structure on the bins. Here, we present a fully decentralized and easy-to-implement algorithm called FirstDiff[d] that combines the simplicity of Greedy[d] and the improved balance of Left[d]. The key idea in FirstDiff[d] is to probe until a different bin size from the first observation is located, then place the ball. Although the number of probes could be quite large for some of the balls, we show that FirstDiff[d] requires only d probes on average per ball (in both the standard and the heavily-loaded settings). Thus the number of probes is no greater than either that of Greedy[d] or Left[d]. More importantly, we show that FirstDiff[d] closely matches the improved maximum load ensured by Left[d] in both the standard and heavily-loaded settings. We further provide a tight lower bound on the maximum load up to O(n) terms.

With the development of optical networks, optical IP phones have also been included as a technology for which universal service is provided, but at the same time dependence on land line phones is decreasing due to the popularity and convenience of cell-phones.

For example, quercetin (3, 3 ′, 4 ′, 5, 7 -pentahydroxyflavone) is a highly ubiquitous and well-classified dietary polyphenol found in various fruits, vegetables and other plant products including onions, broccoli, kale, oranges, blueberries, apples, and tea. Quercetin has demonstrated anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic activity in various cancer cell types. Quercetin is readily metabolized by tyrosinase into various compounds that promote anti-cancer activity; <b>additionally,</b> <b>given</b> <b>that</b> tyrosinase expression increases during tumorigenesis, and its activity is associated with pigmentation changes in both early- and late-stage melanocytic lesions, it suggests that quercetin {{can be used to}} target melanoma.

Data from the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES II), 1988 - 1994, were used to explore this relationship in a large sample of U. S. adults. METHODS: This study used data on 13, 357 dentate participants in NHANES III aged 20 - 79 years. In NHANES III, information on perceived dental health, sociodemographic attributes, smoking status, frequency of dental visits, dental insurance, and general health perception were collected during a home interview, and oral health status was assessed at a mobile examination center. RESULTS: Overall, 34. 4 % of individuals in the study sample reported having an unfavorable perception of their dental health by qualifying it as "fair" or "poor. " Furthermore, 46. 6 % of smokers had an unfavorable dental health perception, compared to 28. 3 % of non-smokers. An interaction between smoking and race/ethnicity was found in logistic regression modeling. Stratified results show that cigarette smoking {{was not a significant}} predictor for an unfavorable dental health perception among individuals who self-identified as Mexican American, but smoking was a significant predictor for an unfavorable dental health perception among those who identified as non-Hispanic black or non-Hispanic white. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to describe the effects of smoking on dental health perception while controlling for examined oral health status. Because perceived dental health is a potential indicator for dental care utilization, a better knowledge of the factors that influence dental health perception is not only important for dental services planning, but also for understanding oral health-related quality of life issues. <b>Additionally,</b> <b>given</b> <b>that</b> smoking may negatively affect dental health perception, these findings have potential implications for smoking cessation activities conducted by dental care providers...|$|E
