5|$|As Paul {{became a}} hurricane, the {{government}} of Mexico issued a hurricane watch for Baja California Sur from Agua Blanca {{on the west coast}} to La Paz on the east coast.

5|$|Later in its duration, King {{moved into}} Georgia as <b>a</b> <b>weakening</b> {{tropical}} storm before dissipating. The storm brought heavy rainfall and wind gusts {{of up to}} 55mph (90km/h), causing a three-hour power outage in Valdosta and downing several trees. Across the state, King produced $250,000 in damage (1950USD) and caused one death.|$|E
5|$|On August 23, {{the storm}} began <b>a</b> <b>weakening</b> trend {{and it turned}} towards the north. The next day, the storm—having {{weakened}} to Category 1 status—skirted the southeastern tip of Newfoundland. Debbie began to lose its tropical characteristics as it accelerated towards the northeast, and it weakened into a tropical storm early on August 25. As it moved over increasingly cold waters, it dissipated east of Greenland.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after its}} peak, Tropical Storm Aletta began to weaken. However, the {{tropical}} cyclone managed to maintain winds of 50mph (85km/h) for 30 hours before resuming <b>a</b> <b>weakening</b> trend. While the steering currents weakened on May25, Aletta slowed {{and moved in}} a large clockwise loop until May28. Shortly thereafter, Tropical Storm Aletta was downgraded into a depression. Tropical Depression Aletta dissipated on May29 roughly 180mi (290km/h) southwest of Acapulco.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>{{weakening}}</b> trend soon occurred, with it weakening to a Category1 hurricane {{early on}} September15. About four days later, the hurricane completed its cyclonic loop and then headed west-northwestward. The system weakened to {{a tropical storm}} early on September20. During the next few days, the storm decelerated and turned westward. Late on September22, it weakened to a tropical depression. The depression continued westward, until dissipating at 1800UTC on September23, while located about 745 miles (1,200km) east-southeast of Bermuda.|$|E
5|$|As Jimena passed {{south of}} Hawaii as <b>a</b> <b>weakening</b> {{tropical}} storm, it brought high winds and heavy rainfall to the island. High wind gusts of 53–58mph (85–93km/h) {{were reported in}} South Point and Kahoolawe. In Honolulu, a weather station reported winds of 36mph (58km/h) while a station in Kauai reported winds of 22mph (35km/h). The storm dropped 6–10inches of rain across the Big Island. In Glenwood, Hawaii, the storm dropped 8.43inches (214mm) of rain. The rainfall from Jimena helped reduce drought conditions across the Big Island. Coastal sections of the Hawaiian Islands reported high surf ranging from 11 to 15feet (3–5meters) high.|$|E
5|$|As supercells and {{multi-cell}} thunderstorms dissipate {{due to a}} weak {{shear force}} or poor lifting mechanisms, (e.g. considerable terrain or lack of daytime heating) the gust front associated with them may outrun the squall line itself and the synoptic scale {{area of low pressure}} may then infill, leading to <b>a</b> <b>weakening</b> of the cold front; essentially, the thunderstorm has exhausted its updrafts, becoming purely a downdraft dominated system. The areas of dissipating squall line thunderstorms may be regions of low CAPE, low humidity, insufficient wind shear, or poor synoptic dynamics (e.g. an upper level low filling) leading to frontolysis.|$|E

5|$|Changes in {{direction}} {{of this nature}} are most commonly observed {{as a result of}} a cyclone's interaction with other low pressure systems, troughs, ridges, or with anticyclones. A strong and stationary anticyclone can effectively block the path of an extratropical cyclone. Such blocking patterns are quite normal, and will generally result in <b>a</b> <b>weakening</b> of the cyclone, the weakening of the anticyclone, a diversion of the cyclone towards the anticyclone's periphery, or a combination of all three to some extent depending on the precise conditions. It is also common for an extratropical cyclone to strengthen as the blocking anticyclone or ridge weakens in these circumstances.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for the cyclone, the Central Pacific Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch for the Big Island. A tropical storm warning was subsequently issued for the same location, The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) sent 20 transportation, public works, and health experts to the region. Many schools were closed, including the University of Hawaii at Hilo and Hawaii Community College; as a result, an estimated 26,000 college students were sent home. As <b>a</b> <b>weakening</b> cyclone, Flossie produced light precipitation {{on the island of}} Hawaii. Large waves impacted south-facing beaches while the maximum sustained wind observed reached 39mph (63km/h) at South Point. No fatalities were reported.|$|E
5|$|September 10, 1964– Hurricane Dora makes {{landfall}} as <b>a</b> <b>weakening</b> Category 2 hurricane near Jacksonville, {{the first}} hurricane in {{an extended period}} of time to strike the area. Dora produces moderate to heavy amounts of precipitation which peaks at 23.73inches (603mm) in Mayo, causing flooding damage and killing one from drowning. Wind gusts peak at 125mph (200km/h) near St. Augustine, causing massive utility failures and heavy damage to buildings. Two Navy personnel die when their evacuating plane crashed upon takeoff. Damage totaled about $220million (1964USD, $1.53billion 2008USD).|$|E
