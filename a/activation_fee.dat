500|$|Reaction to this {{digital rights}} {{management}} scheme was extremely negative. Critics felt that the changes would infringe on consumers' first-sale rights for games purchased on physical media, as games would only be licensed to users rather than sold, and the disc itself would only be used to install the game and not confer ownership of its license or permission to resell. Microsoft also stated that publishers could impose restrictions or <b>activation</b> <b>fees</b> on second-hand copies of games. Xbox Chief Marketing and Strategy Officer Yusuf Mehdi explained that the system was built with digital distribution in mind, but that Microsoft wanted to maintain the availability of games on physical media. He also noted that Microsoft was not [...] "giving in" [...] to publishers' objections to used games, but rather trying to balance the needs of consumers and the industry, and that the trading and sharing abilities of the platform added a level of flexibility not seen on other online distribution platforms at the time.|$|R
5000|$|The {{transition}} of Qwest Wireless customers began in August 2008, initially focusing on customers {{who did not}} have other Qwest Services ("standalone" [...] wireless service). Customers who also had other Qwest services were allowed to [...] "migrate", but were not marketed to directly until October, 2008, when combined Qwest/Verizon Wireless billing was available. In October, 2008, Qwest began offering bundled billing, providing a combined Qwest/Verizon Wireless bill and discounting the Qwest services for qualifying customers who choose to add VzW to the Qwest bill. Financial terms of this agreement are not being disclosed. Current Qwest Wireless customers will be offered a comparable phone for free by Verizon, or the option to receive 25% off a different phone of the customers choice if they choose to move to VzW. <b>Activation</b> <b>fees</b> are also waived for migrating customers, as are early termination fees if the customer has a term agreement with Qwest Wireless.

5000|$|On October 13, 2013, U.S. Cellular {{unveiled}} its take on Shared Data plans. The {{plans are}} comparable to other carriers Shared Data options, but still include all of the same free calling features. A further enhancement to the Shared Data plans was unveiled during Q2 2014, where customers could opt to purchase devices under no-interest [...] "installment agreements" [...] {{in lieu of a}} device subsidy. The installment plans are based on the full device cost spread out over 24 equal monthly installment payments, in addition to the cellular service cost. Customers who purchase equipment on installment plans receive discounts on their [...] "connection charges" [...] to their shared data plans, and pay lower <b>activation</b> <b>fees</b> on devices. There is also no penalty for early payoff for devices on installment plans. Customers who purchase devices under installment payments on shared data plans also have an [...] "early upgrade" [...] option to trade-in their devices after 18 payments in order to upgrade to a new device superseded by another installment agreement on the new device. In November, 2015, an enhancement was made to allow customers who purchase devices on installment plans to be able to [...] "pay down" [...] their devices in multiples of the device's monthly installment cost at any time. Thus, customers can now either pay off their devices in full at any time or make extra payments towards their devices.|$|R
40|$|Humans {{recognize}} facial emotional expressions (FEEs) {{better when}} FEEs are presented dynamically than through static images. Wallraven et al. 2008 propose {{that humans are}} sensitive to the natural dynamics of FEEs. Moreover, PET/fMRI studies suggest that differentiated brain networks process static and dynamic FEEs. However, in most cases, dynamic FEEs have been created out of static ones, using linear morphing techniques. Together with the low time resolution of PET/fMRI, such studies fail to capture the modulation of the activated brain networks by the subtle (and highly nonlinear) dynamics of FEEs. Our ongoing study investigates EEG responses to static and dynamic FEEs drawn from an ecologically valid database (Kaulard et al. 2008, Kaulard et al. 2009). “Happy” and “angry” FEEs performed by two male and two female actors are displayed to twenty female participants in an “oddball” experimental paradigm. Blocks of either dynamic or static stimuli that differ in their emotional content (“happy” versus “angry” and reverse) are presented in a pseudorandom order. The task consists of pressing a keyboard button upon appearance of a deviant stimulus. Data analysis focuses on synchrony and nonlinear coupling of sensor as well as source dynamics (as a bridge to PET/fMRI studies), both in the time-frequency and in the phase-space domain, to identify the brain networks that emerge and evolve dynamically in each condition. Preliminary results from pilot data analysis confirm the PET/fMRI findings of enhanced and differentiated brain <b>activations</b> for dynamic <b>FEEs</b> compared to static ones...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} use of pricing schemes in {{subscription}} services that consist of various combinations of activation, subscription, and cancellation fees. When customers exclusively consider what is directly perceivable, the <b>activation</b> <b>fee</b> starts low and increases as the network grows (penetration strategy), whereas the cancellation fee starts high and decreases as the network grows (skimming strategy). The activation and cancellation fees take various other forms otherwise. The subscription fee remains low at the early stages and increases only when a reasonable number of subscribers is secured. Finally, the authors discuss the theoretical and managerial implications of their findings. This paper investigates {{the use of}} pricing schemes in subscription services that consist of various combinations of activation, subscription, and cancellation fees as applied in certain industries. It is assumed that customer attrition limits the diffusion of the service, but may also generate revenues. The authors demonstrate that, {{depending on the size}} of the service network, and the industry and market characteristics, such as customer activation and maintenance costs and customer sensitivities to different pricing components, the monopolist may find it optimal to choose any of the following pricing schemes: activation, subscription and cancellation fees; subscription and cancellation fees; subscription and activation fees; activation and cancellation fees; and a single <b>activation</b> <b>fee,</b> and a single subscription fee. Using a parametric model, the authors further show that, regardless of the chosen pricing scheme, when customers disregard the effect of the cancellation fee at the subscription and the effect of the <b>activation</b> <b>fee</b> at the termination stage, the <b>activation</b> <b>fee</b> starts low and increases as the network grows (penetration strategy), whereas the cancellation fee starts high and decreases as the network grows (skimming strategy).
