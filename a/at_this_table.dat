[...] these prisoners – they're murderers, they're terrorists, they're insurgents. [...] Many of them probably have American blood on their hands.

2500|$|In 2003, Fred Christenson {{secured the}} {{long-term}} rights acquisition for ESPN, {{and the channel}} expanded their coverage to new heights with their coverage of the WSOP. [...] They included coverage of the entire tournament, with a [...] "Featured Table". [...] <b>At</b> <b>this</b> <b>table,</b> the viewers could see the player's hole cards and subsequent strategy. [...] The action was also broadcast as if live, though on tape-delay. [...] 2003 was the first year that the broadcast covered action preceding the final table. Since then, ESPN has greatly expanded its coverage to include many of the preliminary events of the WSOP, especially Texas Hold 'Em. Also, their coverage of the main event now typically includes at least one hour program on each day. For {{the first two years}} of its existence, ESPN was broadcasting one hour programs of the [...] "circuit" [...] events that the WSOP has at various Harrah's-owned casinos, but ESPN did not renew these events. ESPN's coverage now includes many of the trappings of sports coverage, such as lighter segments (called [...] "The Nuts") and interviews. ESPN's coverage has been largely driven by Matt Maranz, Executive Producer for the WSOP telecasts. Maranz previously worked on ESPN's football pre-game show, and has also produced taped segments for NBC's Olympic coverage.|$|E
