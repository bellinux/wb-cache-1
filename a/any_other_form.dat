5|$|Some {{viruses that}} infect Archaea have complex {{structures}} that are unrelated to <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>form</b> of virus, {{with a wide}} variety of unusual shapes, ranging from spindle-shaped structures, to viruses that resemble hooked rods, teardrops or even bottles. Other archaeal viruses resemble the tailed bacteriophages, and can have multiple tail structures.|$|E
5|$|Archaea can be {{infected}} by double-stranded DNA viruses that are unrelated to <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>form</b> of virus {{and have a}} variety of unusual shapes, including bottles, hooked rods, or teardrops. These viruses have been studied in most detail in thermophilics, particularly the orders Sulfolobales and Thermoproteales. Two groups of single-stranded DNA viruses that infect archaea have been recently isolated. One group is exemplified by the Halorubrum pleomorphic virus 1 ("Pleolipoviridae") infecting halophilic archaea and the other one by the Aeropyrum coil-shaped virus ("Spiraviridae") infecting a hyperthermophilic (optimal growth at 90–95°C) host. Notably, the latter virus has the largest currently reported ssDNA genome. Defenses against these viruses may involve RNA interference from repetitive DNA sequences that are related to the genes of the viruses.|$|E
5|$|Several {{scholars}} {{have suggested that}} rongorongo {{may have been an}} invention inspired by this visit and the signing of the treaty of annexation. As circumstantial evidence, they note that no explorer reported the script prior to Eugène Eyraud in 1864, and are of the opinion that the marks with which the chiefs signed the Spanish treaty do not resemble rongorongo. The hypothesis of these researchers is not that rongorongo was itself a copy of the Latin alphabet, or of <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>form</b> of writing, but that the concept of writing had been conveyed in a process anthropologists term trans-cultural diffusion, which then inspired the islanders to invent their own system of writing. If this is the case, then rongorongo emerged, flourished, fell into oblivion, and was all but forgotten within a span of less than a hundred years.|$|E

25|$|Video game {{development}} and authorship, much like <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>form</b> of entertainment, is frequently a cross-disciplinary field. Video game developers, as employees within this industry are commonly referred, primarily include programmers and graphic designers. Over the years this {{has expanded to}} include almost every type of skill that one might see prevalent {{in the creation of}} any movie or television program, including sound designers, musicians, and other technicians; as well as skills that are specific to video games, such as the game designer. All of these are managed by producers.|$|E
25|$|Some Protestant US {{military}} chaplains {{carry the}} Roman Rite {{version of the}} Anointing of the Sick with them for use if called upon to assist wounded or dying soldiers who are Catholics. The Catholic and Orthodox Churches consider invalid as a sacrament the administration of Anointing of the Sick by such chaplains, who {{in the eyes of}} those Churches are not validly ordained priests. The rite performed by them is thus seen as having the same by no means negligible value of <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>form</b> of prayer offered for the sick or dying.|$|E

25|$|However, {{the subject}} matter of a {{photograph}} is not necessarily subject to an independent copyright. For example, in the Creation Records case, a photographer, attempting to create a photograph for an album cover, set up an elaborate and artificial scene. A photographer from a newspaper covertly photographed the scene and published it in the newspaper. The court held that the newspaper photographer did not infringe the official photographer's copyright. Copyright did not subsist in the scene itself – it was too temporary to be a collage, and could not be categorised as <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>form</b> of artistic work.|$|E
