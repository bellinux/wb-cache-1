50|$|The 1920s {{conclusions}} properly decoded {{an incomplete}} additive version of Egyptian multiplication. The 1920s historians had not followed up an 1895 report that suggested a second form of multiplication method {{was present in}} Ahmes' RMP 2/n table and RMP 36. The second method included aliquot parts, as Springer suggested. <b>Aliquot</b> <b>part</b> were reported by F. Hultsch in 1895. Hultsch parsed Ahmes' 2/n table revealing <b>aliquot</b> <b>part</b> patterns. Yet, Springer's Egyptian multiplication encyclopedia entry did not specify critical <b>aliquot</b> <b>part</b> operational details that are required to translate the information into modern arithmetic statements. Sadly, 1920s math historians had skipped over several operational details, such as of F. Hultsch's 1895 <b>aliquot</b> <b>part</b> discussion points, thereby improperly concluding that <b>aliquot</b> <b>part</b> patterns had not been seen in Ahmes' 2/n table.|$|E
50|$|The <b>aliquot</b> <b>part</b> {{story line}} {{remained}} an unsolved issue until the 21st century.

In 2006, the 1895 Hultsch-Bruins method was confirmed {{from a second}} direction, detailing a common aliquot method used in the RMP and Egyptian Mathematical Leather Roll.

Marx did not reject the basic concept of the Quantity Theory of Money, but rejected the notion that each of the four elements were equal, and instead argued that the quantity of commodities and the price of commodities are the determinative elements and that the volume of money follows from them. He argued... The law, that the quantity of the circulating medium is determined by the sum of the prices of the commodities circulating, and the average velocity of currency may also be stated as follows: given the sum of the values of commodities, and the average rapidity of their metamorphoses, the quantity of precious metal current as money depends on the value of that precious metal. The erroneous opinion that it is, on the contrary, prices that are determined by the quantity of the circulating medium, and that the latter depends on the quantity of the precious metals in a country;this opinion was based by those who first held it, on the absurd hypothesis that commodities are without a price, and money without a value, when they first enter into circulation, and that, once in the circulation, an <b>aliquot</b> <b>part</b> of the medley of commodities is exchanged for an <b>aliquot</b> <b>part</b> of the heap of precious metals.|$|E

The efficiency of antimicrobial activity is expressed in terms of average diameter of inhibition zones obtained by triplicate results.|$|E
40|$|Sraffa's construct, the {{standard}} commodity, responds to Ricardo's {{search for an}} 'invariable' measure of value, since it is a measurement unit invariant to changes in distribution. But Sraffa {{suggests that there is}} no 'counterpart,' no analogous search or needed construct, for the 'problem' of 'difference' as distinct from change ('why two commodities produced by the same quantities of labour are not of the same exchangeable value'). Difference in this sense is crucial to Marx, who distinguishes value and surplus-value from capitalist price and profit in part in order to theorize differences as systematic value transfers. In that effort, Marx repeatedly poses commodities and capitals as 'aliquot parts' of the whole, so that profit is a redistributed share of aggregate surplus-value. This paper shows that, when Marx's <b>aliquot</b> <b>part</b> imagery is formalized, the resulting hypothetical system represents a meaningful 'counterpart,' a construct with a function in Marx's analysis of difference comparable to that of Sraffa's standard commodity in analyzing distributional change. A Marxian 'standard system' posing each commodity as an <b>aliquot</b> <b>part</b> of the social capital (a) defines the needed labor-time unit of social account by homogenizing heterogeneous concrete labors as socially average ('abstract') labor while simultaneously (b) allowing the derivation of exchange-value (e. g., capitalist production price) on that scale via summation of directly and indirectly embodied labor. Indeed, Marx's approach to production prices as resulting from an inter-industry redistribution of aggregate surplus-value is shown to be algebraically identical to the calculation of labor-embodied under 'aliquot part' production conditions. ...|$|E

Conversion methods were independently applied to two coordinate control data sets. The first was constructed from survey data collected using traditional and {{global positioning system}} (GPS) surveying techniques. The second was constructed from map features on USGS 7. 5 -minute maps. The accuracy of the products from these conversion methods was evaluated along with the influence coordinate control data have on this accuracy and the replicability of the conversion methods. The accuracy of the conversion methods {{and the influence of}} the control data were measured by comparing conversion products with two parcel map control data sets. One parcel map was constructed from the survey coordinate control data. The second was constructed from the USGS map feature control data. Public Land Survey System (PLSS) comer positions, parcel comer positions, parcel dimensions, and parcel areas were used in this comparison. These parcel characteristics were identically coded across the conversion method products and parcel maps. The Euclidean distance metric was used to calculate positional differences in PLSS and parcel comer positions. Absolute differences were calculated for parcel lines and parcel areas. Arithmetic means, standard deviations, and coefficients of variation were calculated for these differences and used to analyze the accuracy of the conversion method products and the influence of the coordinate control data. The conversion method which used rubbersheeting and survey control data produced the best positional, dimensional, and areal accuracies. Recompilation produced the worst regardless of coordinate control data. The remainder produced similar results. The influence of the coordinate control data was seen in all aspects of parcels described by <b>aliquot</b> <b>part</b> descriptions.

The present experiments were designed to test the question more directly. Material and Methods The methods used in the previous experiments were followed in the present work. In brief, young but mature white rats (150 - 220 gin.) previously on an adequate stock ration were placed on the experimental diet. After various intervals groups of four to six animals were exsanguinated under ether anesthesia, <b>aliquot</b> <b>parts</b> of serum from each were pooled and the total serum proteins were measured by the gravimetric method of Barnett, Jones and Cohn (2). The Experimental Dict. [...] In order to reduce the problem to its simplest terms the diet consisted exclusively of carrots. The oxheart variety which is said to have a high content of carotene (3) was used although there was no special reason for this selection other than convenience. The carrots always came in fresh and had not been in storage. A liberal ration was placed in the cages every 2 nd day and it was estimated that each rat ate 60 - 100 gm. or more daily. Denton and Kohman (4) studied the nutritive properties of carrots and pointed out that they contain approximately 1 per cent of protein. Each rat, therefore, ingested about a gram (or a little less) of protein daffy; how much of this was digested and absorbed, and to what extent carrot protein is adequate for rats we cannot state. Carrots are said to contain considerable quantities of water-soluble and fatsoluble vitamins as well as salts (Na, Ca, C 1, P, Fe). Theoretically, therefore, they afford a ration not obviously inadequate from a nutritional standpoint, and in fact Denton and Kohman reported that rats on an exclusive carrot diet (except for the addition of salts) remained in apparently good health for as long as 16 weeks...|$|R

But this action of the mind, which is so familiar to every thinking and reasoning man, is easier to be conceived by reflecting on what passes in us when we affirm or deny, than to be explained by words. When a man has in his head the idea of two lines, viz. the side and diagonal of a square, whereof the diagonal is an inch long, he may have the idea also of the division of that line into a certain number of equal parts; v.g. into five, ten, a hundred, a thousand, or any other number, and may have the idea of that inch line being divisible, or not divisible, into such equal parts, as a certain number of them will be equal to the sideline. Now, whenever he perceives, believes, or supposes such a kind of divisibility to agree or disagree to his idea of that line, he, as it were, joins or separates those two ideas, viz. the idea of that line, and the idea of that kind of divisibility; and so makes a mental proposition, which is true or false, according as such a kind of divisibility, a divisibility into such <b>ALIQUOT</b> <b>parts,</b> does really agree to that line or no.

In addition, the relation of toxicity to specific oil boiling-point fraction ranges was explored.
