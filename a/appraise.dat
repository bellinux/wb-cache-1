5|$|In 1946 Secretary of State Dean Acheson {{appointed}} Thomas {{to serve}} on a panel with Robert Oppenheimer, David Lilienthal, Chester I. Barnard and Harry Winne to <b>appraise</b> international atomic inspection, culminating in the Acheson–Lilienthal Report. In 1951 Truman appointed Thomas to the Science Advisory Committee, an eleven-man committee of prominent scientists to advise on defense planning. In 1953 President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed him a scientific consultant to the National Security Council, {{and he was the}} U.S. Representative to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission.

5|$|The MOD {{commissioned}} {{a series of}} multi-beam sonar surveys to image the wreck and <b>appraise</b> its condition. The high-resolution sonograms showed Royal Oak to be lying almost upside down with her top works forced into the seabed. The tip of the bow had been blown off by U-47s first torpedo and a gaping hole on the starboard flank {{was the result of}} the triple strike from her second successful salvo. Following several years of delays, Briggs Marine was contracted by the MoD to conduct the task of pumping off the remaining oil. Royal Oaks mid-construction conversion to fuel oil had placed her fuel tanks in unconventional positions, complicating operations. By 2006, all double bottom tanks had been cleared and the task of removing oil from the inner wing tanks with cold cutting equipment began the next year. By 2010, some 1600 tonnes of fuel oil had been removed, and the wreck was declared to be no longer actively releasing oil into Scapa Flow. Operations continue at a reduced pace to tackle the oil known to be remaining (state for 2012).|$|E
50|$|A {{short sale}} has two {{intrinsic}} and inseverable components. A Short Sale is successful when (1) The Lien holder(s) (a.k.a. Mortgage Company) is agreeable to net {{less than the}} amount owed on the note (debt) {{as the result of}} (2) an arm's length sale at or below the <b>Appraised</b> Value for that property. The agreeable selling price is intrinsically defined to be at or less than the <b>appraised</b> value allowing the process to be attainable. A prudent buyer will not pay greater than the <b>appraised</b> value, and a Bank or Finance company will not provide a mortgage for greater than the <b>appraised</b> value, thus limiting the Short Sale proceeds to a maximum gross yield of the property's <b>Appraised</b> Value.|$|R
50|$|The CLA {{helps to}} {{equalize}} how much towns pay, essentially {{by adjusting the}} <b>appraised</b> value of a homestead by looking at recent sale prices in town {{in comparison to the}} <b>appraised</b> values. If the <b>appraised</b> values are below the sale prices, the CLA raises the tax rate, and if the prices are below the <b>appraised</b> values, the CLA lowers the tax rate. This is done so that properties that have not been reappraised in several years are not able to pay lower taxes than a similarly valued homestead that was more recently reappraised.|$|R

As {{a new type of}} network, the <b>appraising</b> of TI training needs to be solved by new method. Therefore, the paper set up a new index system firstly, laid the foundation for the <b>appraising</b> of Tactical Internet simulative training. Secondly, the paper used a Petri net method, which solved the acquisition problem for those indexes that are dynamic changed and not easy to be directly calculated. Thirdly, the paper used a BP neural network method, which solved the calculation of index weights. Finally, based on the method of satisfaction degree, the paper set up an <b>appraising</b> model which realized the <b>appraising</b> of trainees’ training level. The paper’s work has been applied in practice and achieved good results...|$|R

He met with a sullen commanding officer, Colonel Sing, who reported the desertion of 50 soldiers the previous night, and claimed {{to be short of}} weaponry. On the other hand, when the case officer moved on to the Hmong, the CIA man found Vang Pao personally firing a 4.2 inch mortar at the enemy. The inspection tour left serious doubts as to whether the Hmong had sufficient military power to tackle an offensive by themselves. To further complicate matters, Vang Pao and the Neutralists loathed one another.|$|E

While his first release for the year was the Imtiaz Ali's road movie Highway which garnered positive reviews, his very next release was the performance captured animation film Kochadaiiyaan, a Rajinikanth starrer directed by Soundarya Rajinikanth. The film's score and soundtrack garnered huge critical <b>appraise</b> with its score being long-listed at the forthcoming Academy Awards.

25|$|Cadillac {{was formed}} from the {{remnants}} of the Henry Ford Company. After a dispute between Henry Ford and his investors, Ford left the company along with several of his key partners in March 1902. Ford's financial backers William Murphy and Lemuel Bowen called in engineer Henry M. Leland of Leland & Faulconer Manufacturing Company to <b>appraise</b> the plant and equipment in preparation for liquidating the company's assets. Instead, Leland persuaded the pair to continue manufacturing automobiles using Leland's proven single-cylinder engine. A new company called the Cadillac Automobile Company was established on 22 August 1902, re-purposing the Henry Ford Company factory at Cass Street and Amsterdam Avenue. It was named after French explorer Antoine Laumet de La Mothe, sieur de Cadillac, who had also founded Detroit in 1701.|$|E
25|$|Cost–benefit {{analysis}} {{is often used}} by organizations to <b>appraise</b> the desirability of a given policy. It is {{an analysis of the}} expected balance of benefits and costs, including an account of foregone alternatives and the status quo. CBA helps predict whether the benefits of a policy outweigh its costs, and by how much relative to other alternatives, so that one can rank alternate policies in terms of the cost–benefit ratio. Generally, accurate cost–benefit analysis identifies choices that increase welfare from a utilitarian perspective. Assuming an accurate CBA, changing the status quo by implementing the alternative with the lowest cost–benefit ratio can improve Pareto efficiency. While CBA can offer a well-educated estimate of the best alternative – perfect appraisal of all present and future costs and benefits is difficult –, perfection in terms of economic efficiency and social welfare are not guaranteed.|$|E
25|$|This was {{the major}} {{decision}} that sealed {{the fate of the}} Greek campaign in Anatolia. The state and Army leadership, including King Constantine, Prime Minister Dimitrios Gounaris, and General Anastasios Papoulas, met at Kütahya where they debated the future of the campaign. The Greeks, with their faltering morale rejuvenated, failed to <b>appraise</b> the strategic situation that favoured the defending side; instead, pressed for a 'final solution', the leadership was polarised into the risky decision to pursue the Turks and attack their last line of defence close to Ankara. The military leadership was cautious and requested for more reinforcements and time to prepare, but did not go against the politicians. Only a few voices supported a defensive stance, including Ioannis Metaxas. Constantine by this time had little actual power and did not argue either way. After a delay of almost a month that gave time to the Turks to organise their defence, seven of the Greek divisions crossed east of the Sakarya River.|$|E
25|$|Clarence T. Barrett, Henry P. Judah, and Theodore C. Vermilyen were {{appointed}} as commissioners to <b>appraise</b> {{the value of}} the land required by the Staten Island Rapid Transit Railroad Company to extend the Staten Island Railroad from Vanderbilt's Landing to Tompkinsville. Work on the line was not set to begin until the commissioners made their report. The SIRT filed a map of the proposed route {{in the office of the}} clerk of Richmond County, with the line passing through the lawn of Ms. Post on the North Shore of the island. On February 26, 1883, Mr. Franklin Bartlett and Mr. Clifford Bartlett, on behalf of Ms. Post, notified the court that a change of route would be demanded. The new line, after leaving Vanderbilt's Landing, crossed the property formerly occupied by the Seaman's Retreat, but since acquired by the state by the Marine Society, then through the property of the New York Coast Wrecking Company, the lumber yards of C. C. Eddy & Sons, the carriage factory of J. Scott, the Schaeffer grounds, property represented by Coudert brothers, the grounds of George Bechtel, Rubsnin & Horrman, the brewers; S. L. Mulford & Co.'s coal and wood yard, and lands of Samuel Barton and W. Butler Duncan. The only other building upon the line besides Scott's carriage factory is a small barn on the Schaeffer grounds. The cost of the extension was estimated to be $150,000.|$|E
25|$|In Western cultures, {{predictors}} of happiness include elements that support personal independence, {{a sense of}} personal agency, and self-expression. In Eastern cultures, {{predictors of}} happiness focus on an interdependent self that is inseparable from significant others. Compared to people in individualistic cultures, people in collectivistic cultures are more likely to base their judgments of life satisfaction on how significant others <b>appraise</b> their life than on the balance of inner emotions experienced as pleasant versus unpleasant. Pleasant emotional experiences have a stronger social component in East Asian cultures compared to Western ones. For example, people in Japan are more likely to associate happiness with interpersonally engaging emotions (such as friendly feelings), whereas people in the United States are more likely to associate happiness with interpersonally disengaging emotions (pride, for example). There are also cultural differences in motives and goals associated with happiness. For example, Asian Americans tend to experience greater happiness after achieving goals that are pleasing to or approved of by significant others compared to European Americans. There is also evidence that high self-esteem, {{a sense of personal}} control and a consistent sense of identity relate more strongly to SWB in Western cultures than they do in Eastern ones. However, {{this is not to say}} that these things are unimportant to SWB in Eastern cultures. Research has found that even within Eastern cultures, people with high self-esteem and a more consistent sense of identity are somewhat happier than those who are low in these characteristics. There is no evidence that low self-esteem and so on are actually beneficial to SWB in any known culture.|$|E

While local courts were authorized to <b>appraise</b> the value of any property and provide an avenue for property owners to make claims, the law prohibited the use of any power of attorney by absent property holders, preventing them from filing suit without returning to the country. In addition, the defendant in the case would be the state of Turkey which had created specially tasked committees to deal with each case.|$|E
500|$|In {{some ways}} humanism {{was not a}} {{philosophy}} but a method of learning. In contrast to the medieval scholastic mode, which focused on resolving contradictions between authors, humanists would study ancient texts in the original and <b>appraise</b> them {{through a combination of}} reasoning and empirical evidence. Humanist education was based on the programme of 'Studia Humanitatis', the study of five humanities: poetry, grammar, history, moral philosophy and rhetoric. Although historians have sometimes struggled to define humanism precisely, most have settled on [...] "a middle of the road definition... the movement to recover, interpret, and assimilate the language, literature, learning and values of ancient Greece and Rome". Above all, humanists asserted [...] "the genius of man... the unique and extraordinary ability of the human mind".|$|E

500|$|Hoping {{to write}} a song that would {{successfully}} [...] "portray [...] {{in a world that}} is so protected and safe", Ashman and Menken drew inspiration from a story-telling style that is often reserved for traditional operettas. As Beauty and the Beasts opening number, [...] "Belle", a [...] "pivotal moment...in the narrative", plays a significant role in the film by introducing both the film's heroine, Belle, after whom the song is named, and Gaston, the film's villain. While Belle, a book-loving and intelligent nonconformist who has grown frustrated with her predictable village life, longs for an adventure similar to the ones she reads about in her books, Gaston is a narcissistic hunter who seeks her hand in marriage. In roughly five minutes, the song explains both Belle and Gaston's roles in Beauty and the Beast to the audience. The song also voices the opinions of the townsfolk and [...] "sets up the overall theme and foreshadows what makes the town so oppressive to [...] "; [...] while the villagers award Belle high praise for her doubtless Beauty, they see her as odd because of her love of books and ridicule her for her non-conformity.

[...] Afterwards, an appraiser named Bob Connelly valued the card at $850,000, based on the two previous paper analysis reports. In November 2005, Cobb and Edwards put the card up for sale on eBay. They had to shut down the sale, however, because Connelly only agreed to <b>appraise</b> the card if his report was printed in its entirety at the eBay card listing.|$|E

Linda Grant suffered accusations of plagiarism following her award in 2000, while the following year, a panel of male critics produced their own shortlist and heavily criticised the genuine shortlist.
