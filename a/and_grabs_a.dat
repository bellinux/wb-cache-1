25|$|Jimmy {{manages to}} swerve and drives off while the Viperox chase after them. Helicopters fly over head and fire at flying Viperox. Stark is annoyed {{that they are}} losing, when Lord Azlok storms in and tries to get the truth of where the Doctor is. The Doctor and Seruba have escaped the vault and drive a Jeep to the base, where they see that it's under heavy attack. The Doctor is worried about getting in until Jimmy and Cassie show up with the TARDIS. The TARDIS materialises in the room in Area 51 where Rivesh is dying. In the nick of time, Seruba revives Rivesh. The Doctor asks for the device to be {{activated}} and Rivesh relishes the thought of killing the Viperox. However, the Doctor warns him not to detonate it, or it will completely wipe the Viperox out. Rivesh remains adamant on revenge, but the Doctor reinstates his beliefs and tells him that no-one should {{have the power to}} exterminate an entire species. Rivesh returns the favour of his revival and trusts the Doctor with the device. The Doctor uses his sonic screwdriver on it and then he rushes into the TARDIS <b>and</b> <b>grabs</b> <b>a</b> cable. At that moment, Azlok holds Jimmy hostage {{at the entrance to the}} TARDIS, threatening to kill him if the Doctor detonates it. The Doctor says he isn't going to set it off and explains that one day the Viperox will become a peace-loving race. Azlok dismisses this as madness and advances, but the Doctor connects a cable from the TARDIS console to the device and unleashes a deafening soundwave that affects all the Viperox in the area: the Doctor then orders the Viperox to leave Earth and never return. A furious Azlok vows that the Doctor's time will come, though the Doctor dismisses the warning of his impending death, before Azlok and the rest of the Viperox retreat and flee from Earth. After the attack, Stark thanks the Doctor and Seruba and Rivesh leave in their ship. The Doctor leaves the weapon with Stark in case the Viperox ever return, and Stark warns them to keep quiet about the events. The Doctor suggests that Cassie and Jimmy clear up the Viperox mess. As the TARDIS departs, Cassie and Jimmy hold hands.|$|E

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Head Up High" [...] was released onto Oh Land's Vevo account on 20 October 2014. It {{was directed by}} frequent collaborator Duncan Winecoff and produced by Oh Land, Winecoff, Stuart Winecoff, Emi Stewart, and Sam Campodonico-Ludwig. The video starts with Oh Land walking down a sidewalk at night. She then enters a small, darkened studio where she is shown dancing and singing. The following scenes display the singer appearing stressed and she eventually places a mask on top of head <b>and</b> <b>grabs</b> <b>a</b> baseball bat. She then proceeds to throw a potted plant and vase of flowers against a brick wall, knock over a glass of orange juice, and smash a desktop computer.

Shep returns to her grave and he drops his flowers with the others. Shep looks {{to the left and}} sees a woman watering the flowers. Shep takes her watering can and runs back to Helen's grave. The woman picks up the watering can and waters the flowers and picks up the flower bouquet brought by Shep. An inter-title announces that night has come and it shows Shep lying asleep near the hedge. A ghostly image of Helen, superimposed on the film, appears through hedge and awakens Shep. Helen leads Shep through the cemetery and to her grave. Shep crawls to her grave and lies across the flowers as Helen's form disappears down into the grave. The camera lingers on Shep before fading. The final inter-title of the film announces [...] "Don't cry, it's only make believe" [...] showing Helen, holding flowers and leaning against Shep. This sequence and title may have served as a reminder to children in the audience it was all simply a dramatic story.|$|E
2500|$|Spring Breakers has {{generated}} debate and controversy among critics, with some regarding {{the film as}} sexist due to its objectification of women, while others viewed the film as a feminist or female empowerment film. In regard to the former perspective, The Guardian suggests that the film [...] "reinforces rape culture" [...] and [...] "turns young women into sex objects", while other reviewers state that it [...] "pushes booze-and-bikini hedonism to the extreme", as the [...] "camera glides up, down and around these women's bodies like a giant tongue." [...] In regard to the latter perspective, the women are not depicted as the film's victims, but arguably as antiheroes, acting {{according to their own}} power and agency. According to Rolling Stone, the film presents [...] "a kind of girl-power camaraderie that could almost be called feminist", a result of the director's intent to [...] "do the most radical work, but put it out in the most commercial way (...) to infiltrate the mainstream". In his review of the film, Richard Roeper wrote [...] "Korine's camera is nearly an intrusive weapon as he lingers over the soft, limber bodies of Vanessa Hudgens, Selena Gomez, Ashley Benson and his wife, Rachel Korine.... I think that's sort of the point. When a pre-med student on spring break loses her top, drinks to the point of passing out <b>and</b> <b>grabs</b> <b>a</b> willing lugnut by the ears for six hours of anonymous fun, is she setting the woman's movement back 40 years, or taking charge of her life like any man would do at that age?" ...|$|E
