40|$|Abstract — With {{recent years}} ’ {{accelerated}} convergence to process oriented service management frameworks, IT management is adopting business methods. As organisations model and document their management processes, they <b>apply</b> <b>suggestions</b> and best practices found in document collections like the eTOM or the ITIL. Formal {{representation of the}} emerging management process definitions {{can be accomplished by}} means of process or workflow definition formalisms. However, many IT management processes may differ from other business processes in that they are executed by technical personnel. More important, an IT infrastructure as the target of management processes offers compelling opportunities for automation at an operational level. To help leverage these opportunities, formalisms for process representation need to express IT management process details at a technical level. This paper analyses formalisms designed for business process representation, assesses their suitability to express IT management process definitions, and categorises the examined formalisms according to IT management requirements.

40|$|Thispaper reviews aspects ofthe {{literature}} on international investing {{that should be}} of interest to individual investors. Three modern issues are covered: (I) the bene$ts of international diversijcation as the global markets continue to integrate; (2) the problem of currency exposure; and (3) effective means of achieving international diversijcation. Strategies are discussed which enable the individual to <b>apply</b> <b>suggestions</b> from the research. By restricting the scope of the review to issues of most interest to the individual, we do not review research on international asset pricing theory and international market eficiency and “anomalies. ” Individual investors have seen, and are continuing to see, significant growth in international investment opportunities. The globalization of investment ownership is part of the general integration of the world’s financial markets, made possible by technological advances and a worldwide liberalization of regulations regarding foreign ownership. Domestic mutual funds now offer easy access to individuals interested in international funds, global funds, and country-specific funds. Today, the existence of international mutual funds allows individual investors to purchase stocks i...|$|E
40|$|In depression, {{the ability}} to {{experience}} daily life positive affect predicts recovery and reduces relapse rates. Interventions based on the experience sampling method (ESM-I) are ideally suited to provide insight in personal, contextualized patterns of positive affect. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine whether add-on ESM-derived feedback on personalized patterns of positive affect is feasible and useful to patients, and results in a reduction of depressive symptomatology. Depressed outpatients (n= 102) receiving pharmacological treatment participated in a randomized controlled trial with three arms: an experimental group receiving add-on ESM-derived feedback, a pseudo-experimental group participating in ESM but receiving no feedback, and a control group. The experimental group participated in an ESM procedure (three days per week over a 6 -week period) using a palmtop. This group received weekly standardized feedback on personalized patterns of positive affect. Hamilton Depression Rating Scale - 17 (HDRS) and Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (IDS) scores were obtained before and after the intervention. During a 6 -month follow-up period, five HDRS and IDS assessments were completed. Add-on ESM-derived feedback resulted in a significant and clinically relevant stronger decrease in HDRS score relative to the control group (p< 0. 01; - 5. 5 point reduction in HDRS at 6 months). Compared to the pseudo-experimental group, a clinically relevant decrease in HDRS score was apparent at 6 months (B=- 3. 6, p= 0. 053). Self-reported depressive complaints (IDS) yielded the same pattern over time. The use of ESM-I was deemed acceptable and the provided feedback easy to understand. Patients attempted to <b>apply</b> <b>suggestions</b> from ESM-derived feedback to daily life. These data suggest that the efficacy of traditional passive pharmacological approach to treatment of major depression can be enhanced by using person-tailored daily life information regarding positive affect. status: publishe...|$|E

The {{aim of this}} research was to explore how teaching writing to parents may support home-school literacy connections. This qualitative case study explored parents’ experiences in interactive writing sessions. The descriptive coding and constant comparative analysis of transcribed parent writing sessions, field notes, and documents revealed three themes: (1) Writing Tips and Strategies, (2) Parent-Writers, and (3) Story Connections. The parent writing sessions facilitated parents’ understanding of how to support their elementary-age children’s writing development. Parents demonstrated a desire to support their children’s writing development, and they needed strategies to understand how to help. Parents <b>applied</b> <b>suggestions</b> as writers to support their children’s writing development at home.

Because these devices are nearly always with their owners, can sense relevant {{information about the}} context of their use, and nearly always have network access, they enable the principle of kairos, providing the right information at the best time. Relatively little work has examined providing opportunistic, right-time, right-place suggestions or notifications that encourage people to change their behavior. This paper first discusses some of the challenges facing designers incorporating suggestions into their persuasive technologies. We then review a set of relevant persuasive technologies, focusing primarily on technologies in the health domain. We then identify a design space that represents tactics for building persuasive technologies, particularly suggestion technologies. We then explore how this design space of suggestion tactics can be used to evaluate, compare, and inform the design of new persuasive technologies...|$|R

This survey study aims at investigating domestic fuel consumption patterns of rural areas in central district of Zahedan County, Eastern Iran. The sample was consisted of 250 household heads resided in rural areas with more than 25 households. The validity of questionnaire was confirmed by a panel of experts and its reliability was measured by using a pilot study. Findings revealed that, only 43 percent (n= 102 household) revealed an efficient energy use behavior. The efficient energy consumers were significantly different with respect to their education level, age, income, and the other household characteristics. Results from the structural equation modeling which was used to confirm adequacy of the reasoned action model of fuel consumption behavior, showed that 0. 24 percent of fuel consumption behavior was determined by attitude, intention and subjective norms towards fuel consumption.

This study examined the psychological causes of and responses to LMS using semi-structured interviews with 15 elite trampolinists. Responses were analyzed using inductive content analysis, which led to a total of 54 raw data themes forming 6 general dimensions. Results showed that despite positive experiences before the recognizable start of the syndrome LMS could be traced back to initial skill acquisition and a gradual increase in pressure from various sources. This then lead to negative emotional reactions including self-presentation concerns and perceptions of poor coping strategies. A change in cognitions surrounding the initial motor program of the move also left the sufferer with altered perceptions and visual memory of the skill. Participants expressed that coping strategies were unsuccessful due to the current lack of knowledge surrounding the syndrome. <b>Applied</b> <b>suggestions</b> are offered for sport psychology consultants working with athletes suffering from LMS.

Clusteredness is a global univariate property defined as a layout diverging from equidistance of points to the closest neighbouring point set.

We use this to construct an index for quantification of clusteredness, coined the OPTICS Cordillera, as the norm of subsequent differences over the pair.
