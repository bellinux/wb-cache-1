40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{aim of this}} {{retrospective}} analysis was to analyze the results of treatment of patients with cervical node metastases from carcinoma of occult primary with a policy including neck dissection and postoperative comprehensive radiotherapy. METHODS: Ninety patients were treated with curative intent from 1990 to 2002. RESULTS: The <b>actuarial</b> <b>rate</b> of neck disease control was 68. 8 % at 5 years (95 % confidence interval [CI], 58. 9 %- 78. 7 %). On multivariate analysis, the rate of neck disease control {{was significantly related to}} lymph nodal metastatic level (P =. 006). The <b>actuarial</b> <b>rate</b> of developing head and neck primary tumors at 5 years was 8. 9 % (95 % CI, 2. 6 %- 15. 2 %). The 5 -year <b>actuarial</b> <b>rate</b> of distant metastases was 19. 1 % (95 % CI, 9. 4 %- 28. 9 %). In multivariate analysis, a statistically significant difference in the rate of distant metastasis was obtained when patients were stratified according to the level of nodal involvement (P =. 01) and the presence of extracapsular extension (P =. 013). At the time of analysis, 50 of the 90 patients were alive. A total of 32 (35. 6 %) had died from causes related to their primary disease. Actuarial disease-specific survival at 2 and 5 years was 73. 6 % (95 % CI, 64. 3 %- 82. 9 %) and 62. 8 % (95 % CI, 51. 9 %- 73. 7 %), respectively. In multivariate analysis, a statistically significant difference in disease-specific survival was obtained when patients were stratified according to the level of nodal involvement and the presence of extracapsular extension. CONCLUSIONS: Our study seems to support the use of combined-modality therapy in patients with neck metastases from carcinoma of occult primary.

Material and methodsStudy includes 235 women with ILC treated between 1983 and 1987. All of them underwent axillary dissection and either mastectomy (n= 163) or BCS (n= 72). 50 Gy adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) was given for 53 BCS and 81 mastectomy patients. The BCS group was compared with the mastectomy group. ResultsPatients treated with mastectomy or BCS had a similar outcome at 15 years with regard to distant metastasis-free (62 % vs. 70 %; p, 0. 2017) and breast cancer-specific (62 % vs. 70 %; p, 0. 1728) survival. In the BCS group the <b>actuarial</b> <b>rate</b> of ipsilateral in breast recurrences was 10 % with and 53 % without RT at 15 years (relative risk [RR], 0. 10; p< 0. 0001).

40|$|AIM: To analyse local tumour control, {{radiation}} related complications, visual acuity, enucleation rate, {{and survival}} after brachytherapy of small to medium sized choroidal melanoma (CM) {{with a high}} dose rate (HDR) strontium- 90 (Sr- 90) applicator. METHODS: From 1983 until 2000, 98 eyes with CM were treated with Sr- 90 brachytherapy. The main outcome measures were actuarial rates of the patients' survival, ocular conservation rate, tumour regression, complication rates, and preservation of visual acuity. End point rates were estimated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: The median follow up time was 6. 7 years (0. 5 - 18. 8 years). Actuarial melanoma free patient survival rate was 85 % (SE 4. 8 %) after 18 years. <b>Actuarial</b> <b>rate</b> of ocular conservation and complete tumour regression was 90 % (SE 3. 8 %) after 15 years. In 93 % local tumour control was achieved, 88 % showed a stable scar. Recurrence of the tumour on the border caused enucleation of six eyes (7 %). In three cases (4 %) retinal detachment was the end point. No cases of optic atrophy or of sight impairing retinopathy outside the treated area were found. <b>Actuarial</b> <b>rate</b> of preservation of visual acuity of 1 / 10 was 65 % at 5 years and 45 % at 15 years of follow up (SE 5. 9 % and 8. 8 %). CONCLUSIONS: Sr- 90 brachytherapy is as effective as iodine or ruthenium brachytherapy for small to medium sized CM but causes fewer complications. The preservation of vision is better than with all other described radioisotopes. HDR Sr- 90 brachytherapy can therefore safely be recommended for small to medium sized CM. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Object To {{assess the}} effects of {{radiosurgery}} (RS) on the radiological and hormonal control and its toxicity {{in the treatment of}} pituitary adenomas. Methods Retrospective analysis of 42 patients out of the first 48 consecutive patients with pituitary adenomas treated with RS between 1999 and 2008 with a 6 months minimum follow-up. RS was delivered with Gamma Knife as a primary or adjuvant treatment. There were 14 patients with non-secretory adenomas and, among functioning adenomas, 9 were prolactinomas, 9 were adrenocorticotropic hormone-secreting and 10 were growth hormone-secreting tumors. Hormonal control was defined as hormonal response (decline of more than 50 % from the pre-RS levels) and hormonal normalization. Radiological control was defined as stasis or shrinkage of the tumor. Hypopituitarism and visual deficit were the morbidity outcomes. Hypopituitarism was defined as the initiation of any hormone replacement therapy and visual deficit as loss of visual acuity or visual field after RS. Results The median follow-up was 42 months (6 - 109 months). The median dose was 12, 5 Gy (9 - 15 Gy) and 20 Gy (12 - 28 Gy) for non-secretory and secretory adenomas, respectively. Tumor growth was controlled in 98 % (41 in 42) of the cases and tumor shrinkage ocurred in 10 % (4 in 42) of the cases. The 3 -year <b>actuarial</b> <b>rate</b> of hormonal control and normalization were 62, 4 % and 37, 6 %, respectively, and the 5 -year <b>actuarial</b> <b>rate</b> were 81, 2 % and 55, 4 %, respectively. The median latency period for hormonal control and normalization was, respectively, 15 and 18 months. On univariate analysis, there were no relationships between median dose or tumoral volume and hormonal control or normalization. There were no patients with visual deficit and 1 patient had hypopituitarism after RS. Conclusions RS is an effective and safe therapeutic option in the management of selected patients with pituitary adenomas. The short latency of the radiation response, the highly acceptable radiological and hormonal control and absence of complications at this early follow-up are consistent with literature. </p...|$|E

Radiotherapy was delivered to the chest wall and regional nodes to a total of 60 to 70 Gy in 2 Gy daily fractions. Treatment toxicity was assessed and a comparison of treatment outcome was performed between study patients and historical groups treated with either radiotherapy alone or excision followed by radiotherapy. The dose-limiting toxicities of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia occurred at the second planned dose of 450 mg/m 2 /week after accrual of only six patients, resulting in a MTD of 300 mg/m 2 /week. Myelosuppression and skin desquamation were commonly observed. <b>Actuarial</b> <b>rates</b> of local-regional control were 100 %, 50 %, and 90 % at 2 years for the gemcitabine with radiotherapy, radiotherapy alone, and excision followed by radiotherapy groups, respectively (p  =  0. 105).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) {{is one of}} the {{surgical}} alternatives for the treatment of drug-resistant trigeminal neuralgia (TN). This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of GKS in a large population of patients with TN with very long-term clinical follow-up. METHODS: Between July 1992 and November 2010, 737 patients presenting with TN were treated using GKS. Data were collected prospectively and were further retrospectively evaluated at Timone University Hospital. The frequency and severity of pain, as well as trigeminal nerve function, were evaluated before GKS and regularly thereafter. Radiosurgery using the Gamma Knife (model B, C, 4 C, or Perfexion) was performed with the help of both MR and CT targeting. A single 4 -mm isocenter was positioned in the cisternal portion of the trigeminal nerve at a median distance of 7. 6 mm (range 4 - 14 mm) anterior to the emergence of the nerve (retrogasserian target). A median maximum dose of 85 Gy (range 70 - 90 Gy) was prescribed. RESULTS: The safety and efficacy are reported for 497 patients with medically refractory classical TN who were never previously treated by GKS and had a follow-up of at least 1 year. The median age in this series was 68. 3 years (range 28. 1 - 93. 2 years). The median follow-up period was 43. 8 months (range 12 - 174. 4 months). Overall, 456 patients (91. 75 %) were initially pain free in a median time of 10 days (range 1 - 180 days). Their actuarial probabilities of remaining pain free without medication at 3, 5, 7, and 10 years were 71. 8 %, 64. 9 %, 59. 7 %, and 45. 3 %, respectively. One hundred fifty-seven patients (34. 4 %) who were initially pain free experienced at least 1 recurrence, with a median delay of onset of 24 months (range 0. 6 - 150. 1 months). However, the <b>actuarial</b> <b>rate</b> of maintaining pain relief without further surgery was 67. 8 % at 10 years. The hypesthesia <b>actuarial</b> <b>rate</b> at 5 years was 20. 4 % and at 7 years reached 21. 1 %, but remained stable until 14 years with a median delay of onset of 12 months (range 1 - 65 months).

CONCLUSIONS: Retrogasserian GKS proved to be safe and effective in the long term and in {{a very large number of}} patients. Even if the probability of long-lasting effects may be modest compared with microvascular decompression, the rarity of complications prompts discussion of using GKS as the pragmatic surgical first- or second-intention alternative for classical TN.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the determinants of public pension fund performance {{through the lens of}} agency theory. The study sought to answer the following questions: (1) How much of the fluctuation in the performance of pension plans is due to political interference - either directly from decisions made by legislatures or through the governance structure of the pension boards, after controlling for asset allocation, plan size, and other external factors? (2) Do pension board expertise, education and training, and information disclosure requirements improve the performance of pension plans? (3) Do pension trustees strategically determine the <b>actuarial</b> <b>rate</b> of return (discount rate) in order to reduce contributions in times of fiscal stress for the pension sponsor? Using longitudinal data of pension fund performance over the period 2000 to 2009 and instrumental variables methods to address endogeneity issues, the study found partial support for the agency theory hypotheses. The results indicate that political interference through reduced contributions was the main factor explaining pension performance.

Between September 1991 and March 2009, 420 liver transplanted patients were retrospectively analyzed, identifying 29 cases with PVT (6. 9 %). Preoperative diagnosis, preoperative risk factors, surgical technique options to treat various forms (grades) of PVT, postoperative recurrence and <b>actuarial</b> survival <b>rates</b> were studied. In three cases of PVT grade II and in one case PVT grade III the thrombectomy was insufficient, requiring some surgical technique options (13. 79 %). In two cases placement of iliac vein graft was performed, in one an anastomosis of the portal vein with collateral splenorenal vein and in the other with left gastric varicose. The <b>actuarial</b> survival <b>rate</b> for patients without PVT and patients with PVT and effective thrombectomy was 73. 8 % while those with PVT who needed some type of surgical option was 75 %. Our results suggest that <b>actuarial</b> survival <b>rates</b> were similar among patients with PVT or PVT with effective thrombectomy when compared with PVT that required some surgical options...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Background: This {{analysis}} was undertaken {{to evaluate the}} impact of pre-radiotherapy CEA and CA 19 - 9 values on clinical outcome of locally advanced rectal cancer. Patients and Methods: Retrospective {{data were collected from}} patients (n= 203) with UICC stage II and III rectal adenocarcinomas, who underwent low anterior or abdominoperineal resection and received post-operative or pre-operative radiochemotherapy from January 1989 until July 2002. The rates of survival and distant and local recurrences were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, Log-rank test and Cox’s proportional hazards (median follow-up 8 years). Multivariate {{analysis was}} used to assess the prognostic value of CEA and CA 19 - 9.

40|$|Purpose. To {{evaluate}} toxicity {{associated with}} the addition of elective nodal irradiation (ENI) to a hypofractionated regimen for the treatment of prostate cancer. Methods and Materials. Fifty-seven patients received pelvic image-guided IMRT to 50. 4 [*]Gy in 28 fractions with a hypofractionated simultaneous boost to the prostate to 70 [*]Gy. Thirty-one patients received prostate-only treatment to 70 [*]Gy in 28 fractions. Results. Median followup was 41. 1 months. Early grade ≥ 2 urinary toxicity rates were 49 % (28 of 57) for patients receiving ENI and 58 % (18 of 31) for those not (P= 0. 61). Early grade ≥ 2 rectal toxicity rates were 40 % (23 of 57) and 23 % (7 of 31), respectively (P= 0. 09). The addition of ENI resulted in a 21 % <b>actuarial</b> <b>rate</b> of late grade ≥ 2 rectal toxicity at 4 years, compared to 0 % for patients treated to the prostate only (P= 0. 02). Retrospective daily dosimetry of patients experiencing late rectal toxicity revealed an average increase of 2. 67 % of the rectal volume receiving 70 [*]Gy compared to the original plan. Conclusions. The addition of ENI resulted in an increased risk of late rectal toxicity. Grade ≥ 2 late rectal toxicity was associated with worse daily rectal dosimetry compared to the treatment plan...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Trigeminal {{neuralgia}} (TN) {{related to}} multiple sclerosis (MS) {{is more difficult}} to manage pharmacologically and surgically. OBJECTIVE: This article aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) in this special group of patients. METHODS: Between July 1992 and November 2010, 43 cases with more than 1 year of follow-up were operated with GKS for TN related to MS and prospectively evaluated in the Timone University Hospital, Marseille, France. Radiosurgery using the Gamma Knife (model B or C or Perfexion) was performed. A single 4 -mm isocenter was positioned at a median distance of 8 mm (range 5. 7 - 14. 7) anterior to the emergence of the nerve. A median maximum dose of 85 Gy (range 75 - 90) was delivered. RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 53. 8 months (12 - 157. 1). Thirty-nine patients (90. 7 %) were initially pain free. Their actuarial probability of remaining pain free without medication at 6 months, 1, 3, 5 and 10 years was 87. 2, 71. 8, 43. 1, 38. 3 and 20. 5 %, respectively, and remained stable till 12 years. The hypoesthesia <b>actuarial</b> <b>rate</b> at 6 months, 1 and 2 years was 11. 5, 11. 5 and 16 %, and remained stable till 12 years. CONCLUSIONS: GKS proved safe and effective in this special group of patients...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this study, we {{evaluated}} {{the influence of}} nonmyeloablative and ablative conditioning regimens on the occurrence of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). One hundred thirty-seven patients undergoing matched-related sibling transplantations received the same GVHD prophylaxis. Myeloablative regimens included intravenous busulfan/cyclophosphamide (n = 45) and fludarabine/melphalan (n = 29). Patients in the nonmyeloablative group (n = 63) received fludarabine/idarubicin/cytarabine, cisplatin/fludarabine/idarubicin, and fludarabine/cyclophosphamide. The <b>actuarial</b> <b>rate</b> of grade II to IV acute GVHD was significantly higher (hazard ratio, 3. 6; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 5 – 8. 8) in patients receiving ablative regimens (36 %) compared with the nonmyeloablative group (12 %). The cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD was higher in the ablative group (40 %) compared with the nonmyeloablative group (14 %). The rates were comparable within the first 200 days and were significantly higher in the ablative group beyond day 200 (hazard ratio, 5. 2; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 2 – 23. 2). Nonrelapse and GVHD-related mortality were relatively low in both groups. The use of the described nonmyeloablative preparative regimens {{was associated with a}} reduced incidence of grade II to IV acute GVHD and chronic GVHD compared with the busulfan/cyclophosphamide and fludarabine/melphalan transplant regimens. It {{is interesting to note that}} nonrelapse mortality with nonmyeloablative regimens in older and more debilitated patients was low (14 %) and comparable to that achieved with standard high-dose regimens in younger patient...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: For select {{men with}} low risk {{prostate}} cancer active surveillance {{is more often}} being considered a management strategy. In a multicenter retrospective study we evaluated the <b>actuarial</b> <b>rates</b> and predictors of remaining on active surveillance, the incidence of cancer progression and the pathological findings of delayed radical prostatectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cohort of 262 men from 4 institutions met the inclusion criteria of age 75 years or younger, prostate specific antigen 10 ng/ml or less, clinical stage T 1 -T 2 a, biopsy Gleason sum 6 or less, 3 or less positive cores at diagnostic biopsy, repeat biopsy before active surveillance and no treatment for 6 months following the repeat biopsy. Active surveillance started on {{the date of the}} second biopsy. <b>Actuarial</b> <b>rates</b> of remaining on active surveillance were calculated and univariate Cox regression was used to assess predictors of discontinuing active surveillance. RESULTS: With a median followup of 29 months 43 patients ultimately received active treatment. The 2 and 5 -year probabilities of remaining on active surveillance were 91 % and 75 %, respectively. Patients with cancer on the second biopsy (HR 2. 23, 95 % CI 1. 23 - 4. 06, p = 0. 007) and a higher number of cancerous cores from the 2 biopsies combined (p = 0. 002) were more likely to undergo treatment. Age, prostate specific antigen, clinical stage, prostate volume and number of total biopsy cores sampled were not predictive of outcome. Skeletal metastases developed in 1 patient 38 months after starting active surveillance. Of the 43 patients undergoing delayed treatment 41 (95 %) are without disease progression at a median of 23 months following treatment. CONCLUSIONS: With a median followup of 29 months active surveillance for select patients appears to be safe and associated with a low risk of systemic progression. Cancer at restaging biopsy and a higher total number of cancerous cores are associated with a lower likelihood of remaining on active surveillance. A restaging biopsy should be strongly considered to finalize eligibility for active surveillance...|$|R
