5|$|The area <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> {{was cleared}} of {{pedestrians}} and firefighting personnel because of falling glass and debris. The falling debris was dangerous for firefighters {{because they often}} had to cross the perimeter <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> to enter and leave the high-rise. Hose lines stretched into the building were damaged by falling debris and one firefighter was struck by debris and seriously injured while tending to the lines.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1990s, the O Street Market had once more become dilapidated. The {{structure}} fell into disrepair, trash collected <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>building,</b> many vendors were squatters without leases, {{and drug dealers}} and gang members loitered nearby, driving customers away. The building's owner fell behind on tax payments, and the city threatened to place a lien on the building and foreclose.|$|E
5|$|Television {{coverage}} of the event showed people holding on to scaffolding <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>building,</b> and some were able to climb down to safety. One worker on the 28th floor said that workers were adding insulation to the building when the fire broke out.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a numerical study to simulate airflow around {{an array of}} buildings with different heights. The simulation showed a complex 3 D flow pattern <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>buildings.</b> <b>The</b> velocity and standard deviation <b>around</b> <b>the</b> short <b>buildings</b> increased by about 30 % compared to the same arrangement with <b>buildings</b> of <b>the</b> same height. Thus, the existence of <b>the</b> tall <b>buildings</b> increased <b>the</b> turbulence level and velocity magnitude <b>around</b> <b>the</b> short <b>buildings.</b> This suggests that <b>the</b> proposed <b>buildings</b> arrangement and spacing were effective in improving <b>the</b> wind environment <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>buildings...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This study {{presents}} experiments {{conducted in}} an environmental wind tunnel using physical models to quantify <b>the</b> airflow field <b>around</b> array of buildings {{of two different}} heights. A complex airflow pattern was developed <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>buildings.</b> In addition, <b>the</b> tall <b>buildings</b> increased <b>the</b> turbulence level <b>around</b> <b>the</b> short <b>buildings.</b> Combining short and tall <b>buildings</b> increased <b>the</b> spatially averaged velocity and standard deviation <b>around</b> <b>the</b> short <b>buildings</b> by 25 % compared to the velocity and standard deviation <b>around</b> <b>buildings</b> of <b>the</b> same height. Thus, <b>the</b> proposed <b>buildings</b> arrangement and spacing proved {{to be effective in}} improving <b>the</b> wind environment <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>buildings...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to clear the visual effect by {{predicting}} the evaluation of space where two or three buildings are set. We made the evaluation experiments, using the simulator which enable us to look <b>around</b> <b>the</b> small scale models. Next, we selected physical variables, predicted <b>the</b> evaluation <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>buildings,</b> and got <b>the</b> predicting equations. Then we made <b>the</b> contours <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>buildings</b> from <b>the</b> equations. As a result, the contour form represents characteristic shape <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>buildings.</b> We recognized that <b>the</b> number of <b>buildings,</b> <b>the</b> evaluation scales, and the variations of setting of <b>the</b> <b>buildings</b> influenced <b>the</b> evaluation of <b>the</b> <b>building</b> circumstances...|$|R
5|$|A {{group of}} about 1,500 men began marching towards the {{electric}} distribution center used to power the entire streetcar system, several blocks away from the terminal building. The police had maintained a heavy guard <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> during the ongoing strike and Sheriff Porttens had given orders to use firearms to disperse any attempt by the strikers to take the building. As the crowd neared the building, the police opened fire. Several were injured and the crowd was driven away.|$|E
5|$|At about 8:30am {{the wooden}} {{construction}} of {{the main part of}} the building also burned through and collapsed. Despite the fact that there were still people in the building and more people were lying <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> severely injured, the fire fighters decided to withdraw. The fire department proceeded to extinguish the smoking debris, and at 9:30am the fire was declared under control. The building's collapse left a gaping hole; of the hotel, the furniture store and the book store, almost nothing remained.|$|E
5|$|At present, {{the orphanage}} has been heavily vandalised, with {{surrounding}} residents regularly {{calling the police}} because the sounds of windows smashing and people entering without permission can be heard and seen frequently. Small grass fires <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> have also been reported. Restorations have been considered by the Goulburn City Council. The council is holding Ferrara accountable for allowing damage at the orphanage, while he {{has come up with}} many development projects for the lot. As a result, city council has not issued Ferrara any development permits until restoration work to the orphanage is complete.|$|E

5|$|Fare {{control is}} in a glass-enclosed headhouse {{building}} off of Main Street. The headhouse has {{a feature that}} is unusual to the subway system: it uses recordings of birds to try to scare away city pigeons, and these bird recordings play every few minutes or so. The system was installed because of issues with pigeons entering the headhouse and leaving feathers and droppings both inside and <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> Previous efforts, like spiked ledges, had been ineffective in curbing the pigeon population of the area immediately next to the station.|$|E
5|$|In {{the initial}} design the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum was {{dominated}} by adjoining utility buildings, which were linked to it by high-level walkways. Tange refined this concept to place the museum prominently at the centre, separate from the utility buildings (only {{one of which was}} subsequently designed by him). In addition to architectural symbolism, he thought it important for the design to centre <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> that houses the information about the atomic explosion.|$|E
5|$|Sydenham Hill {{is one of}} {{the highest}} {{locations}} in London; 109metres (357ft) above sea level (spot height on Ordnance Survey Map); {{and the size of the}} Palace and prominence of the site made it easy to identify from much of London. This led to the residential area <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> becoming known as Crystal Palace instead of Sydenham Hill. The Palace was destroyed by fire on 30 November 1936 and the site of the building and its grounds is now known as Crystal Palace Park.|$|E

5|$|A {{few days}} later, the sheriff of St. George, {{accompanied}} by a posse of 30 men, arrested 25 members of the Miners Union, including Matthew O'Loughlin. As Silver Reef's jail {{was too small to}} hold all 25 prisoners, most of them were jailed in the Rice Building. The Rice Building could not hold all of the prisoners, so a line was drawn <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>building,</b> and anyone who crossed the line was threatened with shooting. The Miners Union members were transferred to Beaver, where they were tried for riot, conspiracy, and false imprisonment. Thirteen of the members were sentenced to imprisonment; three were bailed out, while ten were sent to the Utah Territorial Penitentiary. Matthew O'Loughlin was sentenced to twenty days in prison and was charged a $75 fine.|$|E
5|$|The Cunard Building's {{architectural}} style can be generally {{described as a}} mix of Italian Renaissance and Greek Revival, {{with a degree of}} Beaux-Arts influence on the building's structural form. Willink and Caldwell's designs were heavily influenced by the work of Italian architect Baldassare Peruzzi and more broadly Italian Renaissance palace design in general, with the Farnese Palace in Rome believed to have been particularly influential. Despite the strong Italian influence, the architects chose to introduce Greek style for the details <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> itself and, as the building itself is larger than the Italian palaces that provided its inspiration, its structural form was prominently based upon American Beaux-Arts buildings such as those in New York.|$|E
5|$|The nine-story building, {{built in}} 1977, {{was named for}} a federal judge and housed fourteenfederal agencies, {{including}} the DEA, ATF, Social Security Administration, and recruiting offices for the Army and Marine Corps. The Murrah building was chosen for its glass front—which was expected to shatter under {{the impact of the}} blast—and its adjacent large, open parking lot across the street, which might absorb and dissipate some of the force, and protect the occupants of nearby non-federal buildings. In addition, McVeigh believed that the open space <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> would provide better photo opportunities for propaganda purposes. The attack was planned to take place on April 19, 1995, to coincide with the anniversary of the Waco siege and the 220th anniversary of the Battles of Lexington and Concord.|$|E

5|$|By February 26 city {{officials}} had determined One Meridian Plaza {{was not in}} danger of collapse. There was structural damage to horizontal steel beams and floor sections {{on most of the}} fire damaged floors. Under extreme fire exposure the beams and girders sagged and twisted and cracks appeared in the concrete floors. However, the overall structure was stable and able to support the weight of the building. Thermal expansion of the steel frame caused some of the granite panels to be dislodged from the building's facade. The streets and buildings around One Meridian Plaza were closed and cordoned off. The 20-story Morris Building and several three-story shops behind One Meridian Plaza on Chestnut Street were damaged by falling debris and sat unused for years until they were demolished in 2000. The neighboring Girard Trust Building, then called Two Mellon Plaza, experienced extensive water damage forcing the closure of the building. A bank in the building reopened a month later {{but the rest of the}} tower remained vacant for years. The roads <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> were closed for months after the fire, including a portion of two of Philadelphia's major streets, Broad and Market.|$|E
5|$|In the White House, Clinton placed donated {{handicrafts}} {{of contemporary}} American artisans, such as pottery and glassware, on rotating {{display in the}} state rooms. She oversaw {{the restoration of the}} Blue Room to be historically authentic to the period of James Monroe and the Map Room to how it looked during World War II. Working with Arkansas interior decorator Kaki Hockersmith over an eight-year period, she oversaw extensive, privately funded redecoration efforts <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>building,</b> often trying to make it look brighter. These included changing the look of the Treaty Room, a presidential study, to along 19th century lines. Overall the redecoration brought mixed notices, with Victorian furnishings for the Lincoln Sitting Room being criticized the most. Clinton hosted many large-scale events at the White House, including a state dinner for visiting Chinese dignitaries, a New Year's Eve celebration {{at the turn of the}} 21st century and a state dinner honoring the bicentennial of the White House in November 2000.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor and Donna, {{neither one}} {{aware of the}} other's involvement, both {{investigate}} Adipose Industries, which is marketing a special diet pill {{to the people of}} London. They find that the pill's slogan, The Fat Just Walks Away, is literal. The pills use latent body fat to parthenogenetically create small white aliens called Adipose that spawn at night and leave the host's body. The Doctor and Donna separately infiltrate the offices of Adipose Industries, each unaware that the other is there. Donna hides out in a toilet cubicle until they close, the Doctor stays in a storage room. As they explore the building, they suddenly encounter each other through opposite windows in an office. They are confronted by Miss Foster, an alien who is using Britain's overweight population to create the Adipose babies for the Adiposian First Family. Miss Foster pursues the Doctor and Donna <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>building,</b> finally catching them in an office. She tells the Doctor that the Adipose lost their breeding planet and hired Miss Foster to find a replacement. The Doctor uses Miss Foster's sonic pen and his sonic screwdriver to create a diversion and escape.|$|E
