50|$|During the proestral period, {{increased}} levels of oestradiol make the female attractive to the male. There is a rise in progesterone during the oestral phase and the female is now receptive. Following this, the level of oestradiol fluctuates {{and there is a}} lengthy dioestrous phase during which the female is pregnant. Pseudo-pregnancy frequently occurs in canids that have ovulated but failed to conceive. A period of <b>anoestrus</b> follows pregnancy or pseudo-pregnancy, there being only one oestral period during each breeding season. Small and medium-sized canids mostly have a gestation period of fifty to sixty days while larger species average sixty to sixty-five days. The time of year in which the breeding season occurs is related to the length of day, as has been demonstrated in the case of several species that have been translocated across the equator to the other hemisphere and experiences a six-month shift of phase. Domestic dogs and certain small canids in captivity may come into oestrus more frequently, perhaps because the photoperiod stimulus breaks down under conditions of artificial lighting.|$|E

40|$|Summary. Jugular vein {{blood was}} {{collected}} daily from four mature ewes throughout <b>anoestrus</b> {{and the first}} oestrous cycle of the breeding season until 4 days after the second oestrus. The levels of oestrogen, progesterone and LH were determined by radioimmunoassay. There were fluctuations in the LH level {{throughout most of the}} observed an-oestrous period with a mean =+-. E. value of 2 =. =+-=. ng/ml. High LH values of 20 =., 41 =. and 137 =. ng/ml were observed in three ewes on Day =- 4 of <b>anoestrus.</b> A brief minor rise in progesterone level was also observed around this period. Progesterone levels were consistently low(0 =. 1 =+-=. 1 ng/ml) before Day =- 5 of <b>anoestrus.</b> A major rise occurred on Day =- 2 of <b>anoestrus</b> and this was followed by patterns similar to those that have been previously reported for the oestrous cycle of the ewe. Random fluctuations ofoestrogens deviating from a mean level of 4 =. 0 =+- 0 =. pg/ml were observed during <b>anoestrus</b> and the mean level during the period from the first to the second oestrus was 5 =. =+-=. pg/ml. A well=req- defined peak of 13 =. =+-=. pg/ml was seen in all ewes {{on the day of the}} second oestrus. Results of the present study suggest that episodic releases of LH occur during <b>anoestrus</b> and periods of low luteal activity. The fluctuations in LH levels, as observed during the period of low luteal activity, i. e. before Day =- 5 of <b>anoestrus,</b> were less pronounced during the periods of high luteal activity.

40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of the pituitary to GnRH in early and late <b>anoestrus</b> and the indirect response of the ovary were investigated in six adult beagle bitches. Plasma concentrations of LH and oestradiol were determined after i. v. injection of graded doses of GnRH (0, 0. 01, 0. 1, 1, 10 and 100 =m=-). The responses were measured by the LH and oestradiol concentration profiles over time. The responses of LH and oestradiol were significantly dose dependent (P = 0. 002 and P < 0. 001, respectively). The responses of LH and oestradiol were significantly higher (P = 0. 02 and P = 0. 001, respectively) in late <b>anoestrus</b> than in early <b>anoestrus.</b> The responses of LH and the responses of oestradiol were positively correlated(r = 0. 97, P = 0. 001).

40|$|Exposure of anoestrous ewes to rams induces an {{increase}} in LH secretion, eventually leading to ovulation. This technique therefore is an effective, low-cost and hormone-free way of mating sheep outside the breeding season. However, {{the use of this}} technique is limited by the variability of the ewes’ responses. In this study, our objective was to understand more completely the origins of this variability and to determine the relative roles of breed, the point in time during <b>anoestrus</b> and the depth of <b>anoestrus</b> on the response to the ‘ram effect’. In the first experiment, the pattern of <b>anoestrus</b> {{on the basis of the}} concentration of progesterone determined weekly, was determined in four breeds including two less seasonal (Mérinos d'Arles and Romane), one highly seasonal (Mouton Vendéen) and one intermediate (Île-de-France) breeds. <b>Anoestrus</b> was longer and deeper in Mouton Vendéen and Île-de-France than in Romane or Mérinos d'Arles. In the second experiment, we used the same four breeds and tested their hypophyseal response to a challenge with a single dose of 75 ng gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) in early, mid and late <b>anoestrus,</b> and then we examined their endocrine and ovarian responses to the ‘ram effect’. Most (97 %) ewes responded to GnRH and most (93 %) showed a short-term increase in LH pulsatility following the ‘ram effect’. The responses in both cases were higher in females that went on to ovulate, suggesting that the magnitude of the hypophyseal response to a GnRH challenge could be a predictor of the response to the ‘ram effect’. As previously observed, the best ovarian response was in Mérinos d'Arles at the end of <b>anoestrus.</b> However, there was no relationship between the proportion of females in the flock showing spontaneous ovulation and the response to the ‘ram effect’ of anoestrous ewes from the same flock...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to analyze oestrogen receptor-alpha (ER alpha), ER beta and progesterone receptor (PR) gene expression in the canine oocyte and cumulus cells throughout the oestrous cycle. Ovaries from 38 bitches were recovered after ovariohysterectomy and sliced. The phase of the oestrous cycle was determined by vaginal cytology, vaginoscopy and serum hormonal measurements. Oocytes were mechanically denuded by repeated pipetting. For each phase of the cycle, a sample was composed by a pool of 50 oocytes (sample number: prooestrus = 3, oestrus = 8, dioestrus = 5 and <b>anoestrus</b> = 5) or a pool of cumulus cells (prooestrus = 4, oestrus = 7, dioestrus = 4 and <b>anoestrus</b> = 6). Oocyte and cumulus cells` total RNA was isolated and reverse transcription was conducted to perform real-time PCR. Oestrogen receptor-alpha was expressed throughout the cycle in the oocyte (33. 33 %, 25. 0 %, 20. 0 % and 60. 0 % for prooestrus, oestrus, dioestrus and <b>anoestrus,</b> respectively) and cumulus cells (50. 0 %, 47. 14 %, 25. 0 % and 66. 67 % for prooestrus, oestrus, dioestrus and <b>anoestrus,</b> respectively). In the oocyte, the ER beta was also expressed in all phases of the cycle (33. 33 %, 50. 0 %, 20. 0 % and 60. 0 % for prooestrus, oestrus, dioestrus and <b>anoestrus,</b> respectively), whereas in cumulus cells, ER beta was only expressed during prooestrus (50 %) and oestrus (14. 29 %). Interestingly, while the oocyte PR was not detected in any phase of the cycle, this receptor was expressed during prooestrus (50 %), oestrus (42. 86 %) and <b>anoestrus</b> (16. 67 %) in cumulus cells. In conclusion, canine oocytes express ER alpha and ER beta throughout the oestrous cycle, however, {{there is a lack of}} PR expression in all these phases.

In cattle, maternal selectivity is one of the factors that delays the recovery of sexual activity. To investigate the possible influence of maternal selectivity on the duration of postpartum <b>anoestrus</b> in goats, we compared the recovery of estrus behavior by daily estrus detection with an active buck in intact and selective nursing goats (n = 24) with that of dams rendered non-selective by peripheral hyposmia with ZnSO 4 (n = 18).

This review will deal {{with the effects of}} body fat or food intake on sexual and hypothalamic/pituitary activity in sheep, mainly focused on Mediterranean genotypes. Although only severe malnutrition can significantly extend the length of the seasonal anestrous period, the level of fat reserves can play a significant role on reproductive seasonality delaying the onset of seasonal <b>anoestrus,</b> particularly on the Mediterranean environment. The effect of overfeeding on LH secretion has also been reported, specially at short term. Several experimental approaches have elucidated that both high body fat and food intake are able to modify the sensitivity of the hypothalamus to oestradiol negative feedback during seasonal <b>anoestrus,</b> with those effects being associated to a reduced amount of NPY mRNA and to an increase of plasma insulin, glucose and leptin concentrations, particularly in the late scenario.

Before ram introduction, the number of medium (3. 5 - 4. 4 mm) and large (> 4. 4 mm) follicles and the maximum follicle diameter were lower (p 0. 05) the ram-induced preovulatory follicle characteristics; these parameters were similar (p> 0. 05) between ewes developing a short or a normal cycle. Results did not show any relationship between the ovarian status preceding male introduction and the growing dynamic of the ram-induced preovulatory follicles or the category of cycle (normal or short) displayed following ovulation. In conclusion, (1) the luteal outcome following the first ovulation induced by the male effect depends on the time of onset of seasonal <b>anoestrus</b> and (2) the number and size of follicles >= 2 mm also depend on the time of onset of seasonal <b>anoestrus</b> but are not related to the luteal outcome following the first ovulation induced by the male effect...|$|E
40|$|Today, many species, {{especially}} feline are endangered. For this, domestic cats {{used as a}} {{model for}} in vitro culture studies. So, many investigators have problems transporting ovaries to their laboratories. In this study effects of different transport temperatures on in vitro maturation of feline oocytes were investigated. Ovaries were collected from 12 ovariectomised queens of 2 - 3 years old, four of which were at oestrus and eight at <b>anoestrus.</b> One ovary of each pair was brought to the laboratory in PBS at 4 °C and other one at 37 °C. Two main groups as oestrus and <b>anoestrus</b> were established and each were divided into further 2 subgroups as 4 and 37 °C. Oocytes were collected in TCM-medium and matured for 24 h under 5 % CO 2 at 38. 5 °C. Matured oocytes were fertilized with fresh semen at a final concentration 1 x 10 6 mL - 1 in Sperm-Talp medium under 5 % CO 2 for 18 - 24 h. After removing cumulus oophorus cells and zygotes were divided into groups and in vitro cultured for 72 h in 100 μL SOF medium under 5 % CO 2, 5 % O 2 and 90 % N 2 gas mixture. At the 48 th h of incubation, the best cleavage was 44. 4 % (8 / 18) at 37 °C oestrus group and the lowest was 14 % (7 / 50) in the oestrus group at 4 °C. These rates were 22. 72 % (15 / 66) and 28. 57 % (8 / 28), respectively for the <b>anoestrus</b> group. At the 72 h of culture in 37 °C oestrus group 7 embryos stayed at 4 - 8 blastomere stage and 1 embryo reached 16 - 32 blastomere stage. This result was significant when compared to the other groups (p< 0. 001). In 4 °C <b>anoestrus</b> group only 5 embryos have reached 4 - 8 blastomere and no significant difference among the results was observed. It is concluded that cat ovaries oestrus are better transported at 37 °C while <b>anoestrus</b> ovaries could be carried at 4 °C...|$|E
40|$|Mouflon and {{domestic}} Manchega sheep {{differ in the}} timing of their reproductive season under natural photoperiod (NP) conditions. This study examines whether they also differ in their reproductive responses to artificial photoperiod cues. For this, mouflons (n = 24) and ewes (n = 24) were exposed between the winter and summer solstices to artificial long days (LD: 16 h light/day), to short days (SD) simulated via the use of melatonin implants, or to NP conditions (controls), and their ovulatory activity monitored. The effects of these treatments on annual changes in prolactin concentration were also recorded. In the LD mouflon ewes, the offset and onset (7 March 5 and 2 October +/- 4, respectively) of cyclic ovulatory activity occurred earlier (P 0. 05) between the SD and NP mouflon ewes in either the onset of <b>anoestrus</b> (12 May +/- 6 and 26 April +/- 6, respectively) or the onset of subsequent ovulatory activity (13 October +/- 8 and 20 October +/- 2, respectively); however {{the duration of the}} <b>anoestrus</b> period was significantly reduced in the SD. In LD Manchega ewes, the onset of <b>anoestrus</b> was advanced (2 February +/- 5 vs 15 March +/- 11), but ovulatory activity started {{at the same time as}} in NP Manchega ewes (16 July +/- 4 vs 5 July +/- 8). In the SD Manchega ewes, two animals showed continuous cyclic ovulatory activity over the course of the experiment while the remainder entered <b>anoestrus</b> two months later (16 May +/- 6, P < 0. 001) than their NP counterparts. In these SD ewes, the onset of cyclic ovarian activity was very variable. An annual rhythm of plasma prolactin concentration was seen in both the mouflon and Manchega ewes under all three photoperiod conditions. However, the amplitudes of the changes seen in prolactin concentration were smaller in both the LD and SD animals than in the corresponding NP animals (P < 0. 001). In conclusion, the results show that these two types of Mediterranean sheep differ in their ovulatory response when subjected to artificial photoperiods. The results also suggest that refractoriness to SDs may be the most important physiological mechanism regulating the onset of <b>anoestrus</b> in highly seasonal breeds, but not in less seasonal breeds...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to observe the effect of Gn-RH and PMSG on onset of oestrusin the postpartum <b>anoestrus</b> dairy cattle. The total of twenty one postpartum <b>anoestrus</b> dairycattle for used for this study. They were divided into three groups i. e. (I) treated with singledose injection of 500 ug Gn-RH /im/head (Gn-RH 1 x), (II) treated with twice injection 250 ug Gn-RH/im/head (at 24 hours interval) (Gn-RH 2 x), and (III) treated with single doseinjection of 1000 IU PMSG/im/head. The result showed that the onset of oestrus wichtreated with PMSG was earlier (3, 43 ± 0, 79 days) than Gn-RH 1 x (7, 17 ± 3, 24 days).

40|$|The haematologic {{parameters}} of the Nigerian Mongrel bitch were investigated {{at different stages of}} the reproductive cycle to determine their clinical values. Results showed that red blood cell (RBC) counts were highest during <b>anoestrus,</b> with a mean of 5. 09 ± 0. 62 x 106 /µL, while lowest values were recorded during pregnancy, the difference was significant (P< 0. 05). White blood cell (WBC) counts, packed cell volume (PCV) and haemoglobin concentration (Hb) showed an increasing pattern from <b>anoestrus</b> to proestrus and then decreased with transition from proestrus to oestrus. Total WBC counts were highest during dioestrus and almost twice the value recorded in pregnancy. It appears that WBC count may be used for pregnancy diagnosis in the Nigerian Mongrel bitch...|$|E
40|$|Summary. Examination of {{hormonal}} changes {{occurring in}} farm species {{at the onset}} of puberty, during the follicular phase of the oestrous cycle, and at those times when ovarian activity is re-established after periods of seasonal or lactational <b>anoestrus,</b> provides circumstantial evidence that the final phases of follicular development are dependent on a pattern of tonic (episodic) LH secretion. A suppression of episodic LH secretion is associated with periods of anovulation. Stimulation of tonic LH secretion by repeated injections of small doses of synthetic Gn-RH or purified LH restores normal reproductive function in all but deeply anoestrous animals. Continuous infusion of Gn-RH is as effective as repeated injections. It is suggested that an additional inadequacy, possibly endocrine, contributes to the anovulatory state in deep <b>anoestrus...</b>|$|E
40|$|Summary. Plasma {{progesterone}} determinations {{were carried}} out on blood samples collected daily from Clun Forest ewes during the normal oestrous cycle and also after administration of LH-releasing hormone(LH-RH) during seasonal <b>anoestrus.</b> Levels ofplasma progesterone at oestrus ranged from 0 =. to 0 =. ng/ml and luteal phase levels from 3 to 6 ng/ml. Levels found during seasonal <b>anoestrus</b> were {{within the range of}} those observed at oestrus. Following treatment with LH-RH, there was an increase in the plasma LH level in all cases and ovulation occurred in twenty-three out of twenty-seven treated ewes. In the animals which ovulated, the plasma progesterone concentration either remained basal (eighteen animals) or rose to a lower level (< 2 ng/ml) than that found during the luteal phase of the cycle...|$|E
