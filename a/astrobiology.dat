5|$|A Discovery Program {{contestant}} for {{its mission}} #13 is Journey to Enceladus and Titan (JET), an <b>astrobiology</b> Saturn orbiter that would assess the habitability potential of Enceladus and Titan.|$|E
5|$|In <b>astrobiology,</b> it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that discrete vanadium accumulations on Mars could be a potential microbial biosignature, when used in conjunction with Raman spectroscopy and morphology.|$|E
5|$|Paleontology even {{contributes}} to <b>astrobiology,</b> {{the investigation of}} possible life on other planets, by developing models of how life may have arisen and by providing techniques for detecting evidence of life.|$|E
5|$|Ordinary {{supernova}} explosions {{can have}} the same effects as GRBs on Earth's atmosphere if they are close enough. Locally, supernovas are much more frequent events than GRBs, with a possibility of occurring closer to Earth. In the field of <b>astrobiology,</b> the rate and distribution of supernovas are used to define {{what is known as}} the Galactic Habitable Zone.|$|E
5|$|Planned for May 2018 is {{the launch}} of NASA's InSight lander, along with the twin MarCO CubeSats that will fly by Mars and provide a {{telemetry}} relay for the landing. The mission is expected to arrive at Mars in November 2018. NASA plans to launch its Mars 2020 <b>astrobiology</b> rover in July or August 2020.|$|E
5|$|Astronomy and {{astrophysics}} {{have developed}} significant interdisciplinary links with other major scientific fields. Archaeoastronomy {{is the study}} of ancient or traditional astronomies in their cultural context, utilizing archaeological and anthropological evidence. <b>Astrobiology</b> {{is the study of}} the advent and evolution of biological systems in the Universe, with particular emphasis on the possibility of non-terrestrial life. Astrostatistics is the application of statistics to astrophysics to the analysis of vast amount of observational astrophysical data.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of extraterrestrial intelligence would have various impacts on biology and <b>astrobiology.</b> The {{discovery of}} extraterrestrial life in any form, intelligent or non-intelligent, would give humanity greater {{insight into the}} nature of life on Earth and would improve the conception of how the tree of life is organized. Human biologists could learn about extraterrestrial biochemistry and observe how it differs from that found on Earth. This knowledge could help human civilization to learn which aspects of life are common throughout the universe and which are specific to Earth.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of an internal global salty ocean with an aquatic environment supported by global ocean circulation patterns, with an energy source and simple organic compounds in contact with Enceladus's rocky core, may advance the study of <b>astrobiology</b> {{and the study of}} potentially habitable environments for microbial extraterrestrial life. The {{presence of}} a wide range of organic compounds and ammonia indicates their source may be similar to the water/rock reactions known to occur on Earth and that are known to support life. Therefore, several robotic missions have been proposed to further explore Enceladus and assess its habitability; some of the proposed missions are: Journey to Enceladus and Titan (JET), Enceladus Explorer (En-Ex), Enceladus Life Finder (ELF), Life Investigation For Enceladus (LIFE), and Enceladus Life Signatures and Habitability (ELSAH).|$|E
25|$|<b>Astrobiology</b> {{makes use}} of physics, chemistry, astronomy, biology, {{molecular}} biology, ecology, planetary science, geography, and geology to investigate the possibility of life on other worlds and help recognize biospheres that might be different from that on Earth. The origin and early evolution of life is an inseparable part of the discipline of <b>astrobiology.</b> <b>Astrobiology</b> concerns itself with interpretation of existing scientific data, and although speculation is entertained to give context, <b>astrobiology</b> concerns itself primarily with hypotheses that fit firmly into existing scientific theories. Given more detailed and reliable data {{from other parts of}} the universe, the roots of <b>astrobiology</b> itself—physics, chemistry and biology—may have their theoretical bases challenged.|$|E
25|$|The European Space Agency is {{currently}} {{collaborating with the}} Russian Federal Space Agency (Roscosmos) and developing the ExoMars <b>astrobiology</b> rover, {{which is to be}} launched in 2018. Meanwhile, NASA is developing the Mars 2020 <b>astrobiology</b> rover and sample cacher for a later return to Earth.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} of deep-sea ecosystems, along with advancements {{in the fields}} of <b>astrobiology,</b> observational astronomy and {{discovery of}} large varieties of extremophiles, opened up a new avenue in <b>astrobiology</b> by massively expanding the number of possible extraterrestrial habitats and possible transport of hardy microbial life through vast distances.|$|E
25|$|<b>Astrobiology</b> is {{the study}} of the origin, evolution, distribution, and future of life in the universe: {{extraterrestrial}} life and life on Earth. <b>Astrobiology</b> addresses the question of whether life exists beyond Earth, and how humans can detect it if it does. The term exobiology is similar but more specific—it covers the search for life beyond Earth, and the effects of extraterrestrial environments on living things.|$|E
25|$|Journey to Enceladus and Titan (JET) is an orbiter <b>astrobiology</b> mission {{concept to}} assess the {{habitability}} potential of Saturn's moons Enceladus and Titan.|$|E
25|$|While {{it is an}} {{emerging}} and developing field, {{the question of whether}} life exists elsewhere in the universe is a verifiable hypothesis and thus a valid line of scientific inquiry. Though once considered outside the mainstream of scientific inquiry, <b>astrobiology</b> has become a formalized field of study. Planetary scientist David Grinspoon calls <b>astrobiology</b> a field of natural philosophy, grounding speculation on the unknown, in known scientific theory. NASA's interest in exobiology first began with the development of the U.S. Space Program. In 1959, NASA funded its first exobiology project, and in 1960, NASA founded an Exobiology Program, which is now one of four main elements of NASA's current <b>Astrobiology</b> Program. In 1971, NASA funded the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) to search radio frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum for interstellar communications transmitted by extraterrestrial life outside the Solar System. NASA's Viking missions to Mars, launched in 1976, included three biology experiments designed to look for metabolism of present life on Mars.|$|E
25|$|Jere {{studied and}} taught about <b>astrobiology,</b> {{publishing}} {{papers on the}} possibility of past and present life on Mars and Europa as well as icy bodies in the Universe anywhere.|$|E
25|$|Enceladus Life Finder (ELF) is a {{proposed}} <b>astrobiology</b> mission concept for a space probe intended {{to assess the}} habitability of the internal aquatic ocean of Enceladus, Saturn's sixth-largest moon.|$|E
25|$|The Mars 2020 rover mission by NASA will be {{launched}} in 2020, {{and it is}} based on the Mars Science Laboratory design. The scientific payload will be focused on <b>astrobiology.</b>|$|E
25|$|Advancements in {{the fields}} of <b>astrobiology,</b> {{observational}} astronomy and discovery of large varieties of extremophiles with extraordinary capability to thrive in the harshest environments on Earth, have led to speculation that life may possibly be thriving on many of the extraterrestrial bodies in the universe. A particular focus of current <b>astrobiology</b> research is the search for life on Mars due to this planet's proximity to Earth and geological history. There is a growing body of evidence to suggest that Mars has previously had a considerable amount of water on its surface, water being considered an essential precursor to the development of carbon-based life.|$|E
25|$|Another active {{research}} area in <b>astrobiology</b> is planetary system formation. It {{has been suggested}} that the peculiarities of the Solar System (for example, the presence of Jupiter as a protective shield) may have greatly increased the probability of intelligent life arising on our planet.|$|E
25|$|Astroecology {{concerns}} {{the interactions of}} life with space environments and resources, in planets, asteroids and comets. On a larger scale, astroecology concerns resources for life about stars in the galaxy through the cosmological future. Astroecology attempts to quantify future life in space, addressing this area of <b>astrobiology.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Astrobiology</b> is an {{interdisciplinary}} field {{that uses a}} combination of geobiological and planetary science data to establish a context for the search for life on other planets. The origin of life from non-living chemistry and geology, or abiogenesis, is a major topic in <b>astrobiology.</b> Even though it is fundamentally an earth-bound concern, and therefore of great geobiological interest, getting at {{the origin of life}} necessitates considering what life requires, what, if anything, is special about Earth, what might have changed to allow life to blossom, what constitutes evidence for life, and even what constitutes life itself. These are the same questions that scientists might ask when searching for alien life. In addition, astrobiologists research the possibility of life based on other metabolisms and elements, the survivability of Earth’s organisms on other planets or spacecrafts, planetary and solar system evolution, and space geochemistry.|$|E
25|$|Non-cellular replicating agents, notably viruses, are {{generally}} {{not considered to be}} organisms because they are incapable of independent reproduction or metabolism. This classification is problematic, though, since some parasites and endosymbionts are also incapable of independent life. <b>Astrobiology</b> studies the possibility of different forms of life on other worlds, including replicating structures made from materials other than DNA.|$|E
25|$|Life Investigation For Enceladus (LIFE) is a {{proposed}} <b>astrobiology</b> sample-return mission concept. The spacecraft would enter into Saturn orbit and enable multiple flybys through Enceladus' icy plumes to collect icy plume particles and volatiles and {{return them to}} Earth on a capsule. The spacecraft may sample Enceladus' plumes, the E ring of Saturn, and the upper atmosphere of Titan.|$|E
25|$|Three {{series of}} <b>astrobiology</b> {{experiments}} {{have been conducted}} outside the International Space Station between 2008 and 2015 (EXPOSE) where {{a wide variety of}} biomolecules, microorganisms, and their spores were exposed to the solar flux and vacuum of space for about 1.5 years. Some organisms survived in an inactive state for considerable lengths of time, and those samples sheltered by simulated meteorite material provide experimental evidence for the likelihood of the hypothetical scenario of lithopanspermia.|$|E
25|$|The {{possibility}} {{of life on}} Mars is a subject of significant interest to <b>astrobiology</b> due to the planet's proximity and similarities to Earth. To date no proof has been found of past or present life on Mars. However, cumulative evidence {{is now clear that}} during the ancient Noachian time period, the surface environment of Mars had liquid water and may have been habitable for microorganisms. The existence of habitable conditions does not necessarily indicate the presence of life.|$|E
25|$|An {{absolute}} {{requirement for}} life is an energy source, {{but the notion}} of planetary habitability implies that many other geophysical, geochemical, and astrophysical criteria must be met before the surface of an astronomical body is able to support life. Of particular interest is the set of factors that has sustained complex, multicellular animals in addition to simpler organisms on Earth. Research and theory {{in this regard is}} a component of planetary science and the emerging discipline of <b>astrobiology.</b>|$|E
25|$|ExoMars (Exobiology on Mars) is {{a two-part}} <b>astrobiology</b> project {{to search for}} {{evidence}} of life on Mars, a joint mission of the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Russian space agency Roscosmos. The first part, launched in 2016, placed a trace gas research and communication satellite into Mars orbit and released a stationary experimental lander (which crashed). The second part is planned to launch in 2020, and to land a rover on the surface, supporting a science mission {{that is expected to}} last into 2022 or beyond.|$|E
25|$|The ISS {{simplifies}} individual experiments {{by eliminating}} the need for separate rocket launches and research staff. The wide variety of research fields include <b>astrobiology,</b> astronomy, human research including space medicine and life sciences, physical sciences, materials science, space weather, and weather on Earth (meteorology). Scientists on Earth have access to the crew's data and can modify experiments or launch new ones, which are benefits generally unavailable on unmanned spacecraft. Crews fly expeditions of several months duration, providing approximately 160-man-hours per week of labour with a crew of 6.|$|E
25|$|Most astronomy-related <b>astrobiology</b> {{research}} {{falls into}} the category of extrasolar planet (exoplanet) detection, the hypothesis being that if life arose on Earth, then it could also arise on other planets with similar characteristics. To that end, a number of instruments designed to detect Earth-sized exoplanets have been considered, most notably NASA's Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF) and ESA's Darwin programs, both of which have been cancelled. NASA launched the Kepler mission in March 2009, and the French Space Agency launched the COROT space mission in 2006. There are also several less ambitious ground-based efforts underway.|$|E
25|$|While often {{delegated}} {{to the field}} of <b>astrobiology,</b> attempts to understand how and when life arose are relevant to geobiology as well. The first major strides towards understanding the “how” came with the Miller-Urey experiment, when amino acids formed out of a simulated “primordial soup”. Another theory is that life originated in a system much like the hydrothermal vents at mid-oceanic spreading centers. In the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, a variety of hydrocarbons form under vent-like conditions. Other ideas include the “RNA World” hypothesis, which postulates that the first biologic molecule was RNA and the idea that life originated elsewhere in the solar system and was brought to Earth, perhaps via a meteorite.|$|E
25|$|The {{meteorite}} is {{best known}} for gaining intense media attention in 1996 when a group of scientists claimed to have found evidence for microscopic fossils of Martian bacteria in it, culminating in then U.S. president Bill Clinton giving a speech about the potential discovery. These claims were controversial from the beginning, and the wider scientific community ultimately rejected the hypothesis once all the unusual features in the meteorite had been explained without requiring life to be present. Despite there being no convincing evidence of Martian life, the initial paper and scientific and public attention caused by it are considered to be turning points {{in the history of the}} developing science of <b>astrobiology.</b>|$|E
25|$|As of 2017, Rensselaer's {{faculty and}} alumni include {{six members of}} the National Inventors Hall of Fame, six National Medal of Technology winners, five National Medal of Science winners, eight Fulbright Scholarship recipients, and a Nobel Prize winner in Physics; in addition, 85 faculty or alumni {{are members of the}} National Academy of Engineering, 17 of the National Academy of Sciences, 25 of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, eight of the National Academy of Medicine, and eight of the National Academy of Inventors. Research {{projects}} include the areas of <b>Astrobiology</b> and Astrophysics, Biotechnology and Life Sciences, Energy, Environment, and Smart Systems (EES), Nanotechnology and Advanced Materials, Computational Science and Engineering, and Cognitive Engineering.|$|E
25|$|Icebreaker Life is a lander {{mission that}} {{proposed}} for NASA's Discovery Program for the 2021 launch opportunity, {{but it was}} not selected for development. It would have had a stationary lander that would be a near copy of the successful 2008 Phoenix and it would have carried an upgraded <b>astrobiology</b> scientific payload, including a 1-meter-long core drill to sample ice-cemented ground in the northern plains to conduct a search for organic molecules and evidence of current or past life on Mars. One of the key goals of the Icebreaker Life mission is to test the hypothesis that the ice-rich ground in the polar regions has significant concentrations of organics due to protection by the ice from oxidants and radiation.|$|E
25|$|The Tanpopo {{mission is}} an orbital <b>astrobiology</b> {{experiment}} by Japan {{that is currently}} investigating the possible interplanetary transfer of life, organic compounds, and possible terrestrial particles in low Earth orbit. The Tanpopo experiment is taking place at the Exposed Facility located on the exterior of Kibo module of the International Space Station. The mission will collect cosmic dusts and other particles for three years by using an ultra-low density silica gel called aerogel. The purpose is to assess the panspermia hypothesis {{and the possibility of}} natural interplanetary transport of life and its precursors. Some of these aerogels will be replaced every one or two years through 2018. Sample collection began in May 2015, and the first samples will be returned to Earth in mid-2016.|$|E
25|$|Planetary {{habitability}} is {{the measure}} of a planet's or a natural satellite's potential to have habitable environments hospitable to life, or its ability to generate life endogenously. A planet in the habitable zone has no guarantee of actually being habitable, and habitable environments {{do not need to}} contain life. Life may develop directly on a planet or satellite or be transferred to it from another body, a hypothetical process known as panspermia. As the existence of life beyond Earth is unknown, planetary habitability is largely an extrapolation of conditions on Earth and the characteristics of the Sun and Solar System which appear favorable to life's flourishing—in particular those factors that have sustained complex, multicellular organisms and not just simpler, unicellular creatures. Research and theory in this regard is a component of planetary science and the emerging discipline of <b>astrobiology.</b>|$|E
25|$|Extremophiles, organisms able {{to survive}} in extreme environments, are a core {{research}} element for astrobiologists. Such organisms include biota which are {{able to survive}} several kilometers below the ocean's surface near hydrothermal vents and microbes that thrive in highly acidic environments. It is now known that extremophiles thrive in ice, boiling water, acid, alkali, the water core of nuclear reactors, salt crystals, toxic waste and {{in a range of}} other extreme habitats that were previously thought to be inhospitable for life. This opened up a new avenue in <b>astrobiology</b> by massively expanding the number of possible extraterrestrial habitats. Characterization of these organisms, their environments and their evolutionary pathways, is considered a crucial component to understanding how life might evolve elsewhere in the universe. For example, some organisms able to withstand exposure to the vacuum and radiation of outer space include the lichen fungi Rhizocarpon geographicum and Xanthoria elegans, the bacterium Bacillus safensis, Deinococcus radiodurans, Bacillus subtilis, yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, seeds from Arabidopsis thaliana ('mouse-ear cress'), as well as the invertebrate animal Tardigrade.|$|E
