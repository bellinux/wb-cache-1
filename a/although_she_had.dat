5|$|While hiking at {{a family}} reunion in 1980, Brodie became unusually tired. She was shortly {{diagnosed}} with metastatic lung cancer, <b>although</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> never smoked.

5|$|A {{number of}} {{observers}} noted smoke {{coming from the}} vicinity of No. 3 turret and the aircraft area just forward of it, just before the explosion.

While fire in the secure magazines was a very remote possibility, a fire in an area adjacent to the No. 3 magazine could have raised the temperature to a level sufficient to ignite the highly sensitive black-powder primers stored in the magazine and thus cause the explosion.|$|E

During this period, she was visited in the hospital by her brother Thomas, who had remained a practicing Latter-day Saint. Brodie asked him to “give me a blessing,” <b>although</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> long been estranged from both her brother and the LDS Church.

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Labor's fourth consecutive defeat in the 2004 federal election it was widely speculated that Gillard might challenge Jenny Macklin for the deputy leadership, {{but she did not}} do so.

After Mark Latham resigned as Labor Leader in January 2005, Gillard appeared on ABC's Australian Story in March 2006, after which an Ipsos Mackay poll conducted for Network Ten's Meet the Press found that more respondents would prefer Gillard to be Labor Leader; she polled 32% compared with Beazley's 25% and Kevin Rudd's 18%. <b>Although</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> significant cross-factional support, she announced on 25 January 2005 that she would not contest the leadership, allowing Beazley to be elected unopposed.|$|E

At the time, there was a vacancy for the Chair of Bacteriology at the University of London, and Ledingham was lobbying his colleagues to offer Burnet the post, but Burnet returned to Australia, partly because of Druce.|$|E
5|$|After {{losing her}} job, Boisselier moved with her middle child, a son, to Quebec, where her eldest {{daughter}} was a student.

5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> long {{broken her}} formal {{ties with the}} British Communist Party, Wilkinson {{retained}} strong links with other communist organisations at home and abroad. Her association with leading communists such as Willi Münzenberg and Otto Katz is revealed in British intelligence files held on her. However, she {{was not prepared to}} risk losing her parliamentary seat, and thus kept her rebellious behaviour within bounds. In 1937 Wilkinson was {{one of a group of}} Labour figures—Aneurin Bevan, Harold Laski and Stafford Cripps were others—who founded the left-wing magazine Tribune; in the first issue she wrote of the need to fight unemployment, poverty, malnutrition and inadequate housing. Mindful of the dependence of many low-income families on credit, she introduced a bill to regulate hire purchase agreements, at the time a subject of frequent abuse, and with all-party support she secured the passage of the Hire Purchase Act 1938.|$|E
