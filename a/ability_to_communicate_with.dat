5|$|In October 2006, as details {{surrounding}} {{the crash of}} Flight 1907 began to emerge, the investigation seemed {{to be at least}} partly focused on possible air traffic control errors. This led to increasing resentment by the controllers and exacerbated their already poor labor relations with their military superiors. The controllers complained about being overworked, underpaid, overstressed, and forced to work with outdated equipment. Many have poor English skills, limiting their <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> foreign pilots, which played a role in crash of Flight 1907. In addition, the military's complete control of the country's aviation was criticized for its lack of public accountability.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files; this season focuses on the {{investigations}} of John Doggett (Robert Patrick), Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). In this episode, after being in a car accident, Reyes awakens in a surreal hospital. Doggett and a comatose Reyes struggle to prevent her organ donor card from being acted upon. The two, however, soon discover a unique woman, Audrey Pauley, who has the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> both those conscious and unconscious.|$|E
5|$|The {{story is}} told in the first-person through the protagonist, Elspeth Gordie, a teenage girl who has secret mental powers such as telepathy and the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> animals. The story begins at Kindraide orphan home, {{where she and her}} brother Jes live, before moving briefly through Sutrium, the capital, and the countryside. However the {{majority}} of the narrative is set at Obernewtyn, which lies in the northern mountains of the Land, the fictional nation in which the Obernewtyn Chronicles is set.|$|E

5|$|Littlest Pet Shop is a Canadian–American children's {{animated}} {{television series}} developed by Julie McNally-Cahill and Tim Cahill for Hasbro Studios. Based on the Littlest Pet Shop and Blythe toys owned by Hasbro, the show follows Blythe Baxter, {{a teenage girl}} who, after moving into an apartment in a metropolitan area, gains the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> animals. Located below her apartment is the eponymous pet store where Blythe works and talks {{to a group of}} pets who regularly reside at a day care in the shop. Worried that a corrupt rival business will drive their shop out of business, the pets depend on Blythe to drive business into the store with her pet fashion designs.|$|E
5|$|Al-Badr {{had formed}} two royalist armies— one under his uncle Prince Hassan {{in the east}} and one under his own control in the west. Both armies {{controlled}} most of the north and east of Yemen, including the towns of Harib and Marib. The provincial capital of Northern Yemen, Sadah, which would have given the Imam a key strategic road towards the main capital San'a, was controlled by the republicans. There were also areas like the town of Hajjah, where the royalists controlled the mountains while the Egyptians and republicans controlled the town and fortress. Mercenaries from France, Belgium and England, who had fought in Rhodesia, Malaya, Indochina and Algeria, were sent to assist the Imam in planning, training and giving the irregular forces the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> one another and the Saudis. They trained tribesmen in the use of antitank weapons, such as the 106mm gun and in mining techniques. The numbers of mercenaries are estimated in the hundreds, although Egyptian sources at the time reported 15,000. Royalist tactics were confined to guerilla warfare, isolating conventional Egyptian and republican forces, and conducting attacks on supply lines.|$|E
5|$|Hartley {{explained}} that Arthur would {{be aware of}} his powers {{at the beginning of}} the series and would have no problem using them for personal gain. Hartley felt this played against the typical superheroes, because his character was not afraid to flaunt his abilities. Gough explained A.C. would be able to swim faster than humans, breathe underwater, as well as have super strength while underwater. He also stated that exposure to water on land would give him powers. The extent of his speed is shown in the pilot, when Arthur is able to keep up with a fighter jet flying above him. The extent of A.C.'s ability to breathe underwater was not elaborated upon, but he is seen swimming near the bottom of the ocean near the start of the pilot. When A.C. is talking to Eva about releasing captive dolphins, he tells her that he felt as though the dolphins were somehow calling to him. In the comics, one of Aquaman's powers is the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> sea life. Gough likened A.C.'s not having access to water to Clark's growing weak around kryptonite in Smallville – if A.C. does not get water, he will dehydrate and weaken. Water gives him a power boost and enables producers to explore stories on land.|$|E

5|$|Niadra is a zerg broodmother {{and leader}} of the Niadra Brood. She was created by Sarah Kerrigan when she battled the protoss on Kaldir. Although she succeeded in {{preventing}} them from contacting the Golden Armada, one of the protoss ships attempted to flee from the planet and travel to Shakuras. To prevent them from surviving, Kerrigan placed a parasitic larva within the captured protoss colonist Lasarra and dropped the psionic veil that prevented her from being warped back to her people. After being teleported to the ship, the protoss attempted to warn the Templar but died as the parasitic larva spawned from her body. Shortly afterwards, it began infesting the local animals kept onboard by the protoss and hid within the ventilation shafts where it found a safe location to mature into a queen. Kerrigan gave her the name Niadra and tasked her with eliminating all the protoss on board the ship, a task she accomplished with assistance from her zerg offspring. After damaging the vessel's warp drive, Niadra and her brood became the only occupants of the craft, but they had traveled beyond the reach of Kerrigan's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>communicate.</b> <b>With</b> few other options, Niadra decided to continue the Queen of Blades' last directives: to survive, grow her brood, and destroy the protoss.|$|E
5|$|The Karma Society {{was founded}} to study God, who was losing {{his faith in}} {{humanity}} due to their behavior. Sera was the only survivor {{of a group of}} children with the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> God. To hide from the pain of the experiments, Sera created an artificial environment that would become the Junkyard, populating it with benign versions of Karma Society staff: these artificial beings would become the Junkyard's five tribes. The original Serph manipulated Sera and his team for his own ends while the original Heat attempted to protect her: when Sera saw Serph killing Heat while linked to the EGG, God felt her pain and attacked Earth. The original Serph was overwhelmed by a flood of data and became a demon before being killed. Now knowing the truth, Serph escapes from the EGG, killing Heat in the process. Sera then decides to head for a secondary Karma facility to communicate with God: on the way, Gale dies defeating Angel, and Cielo sacrifices himself so Sera and Serph can reach the transmission site. As Sera begins transmission, the base is destroyed, killing her and Serph. Their data travels to the sun—the physical manifestation of God—and merges into a new being called Seraph. Aided by the data avatars of the Embryon, Seraph confronts God, fighting an avatar of him to prove humanity's worth. Upon victory, Seraph achieves enlightenment and travels with Schrödinger to new worlds, while God restores the sun and Earth. At the game's end, it is shown that the Embryon, Angel, and aspects of Sera and Serph have reincarnated, with a grown Fred acting as their caretaker.|$|E

40|$|Several {{techniques}} for estimating the software development effort are known and commonly used.

25|$|Post-birth {{experiences}} are also believed to convey magical power, an example {{being that the}} survival of a near-death illness may be taken as evidence of their power as a healer.

25|$|To {{confirm the}} notion that {{language}} acquisition occurs as a progression of comprehension before production, Castro and Snowdon (2000) showed that infants respond behaviorally to vocalizing adults in a fashion that indicates they can comprehend auditory inputs. When an adult produces a C-call chirp, used to indicate food preference and when navigating to a food source, an infant approaches the adult caller to be fed, but do not use the prototype calling {{as a proxy for}} C-calls. This finding argues for the idea that infants are able to understand vocalizations first, and later acquire the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> adult vocalizations.|$|E
25|$|DuBois {{refers to}} herself as a medium and profiler, rather than a psychic, because of the {{negative}} connotation she feels {{is associated with the}} term psychic. She claims that she became aware that she had the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> departed souls when she was 6 years old. DuBois claims she uses this ability to connect deceased loved ones to the living, and also to help law enforcement agencies solve crimes, such as the Texas Rangers and the Glendale, Arizona police department, and that she used these abilities as a jury consultant. These law enforcement agencies have since either denied any such cooperation happened or stated the tips provided by DuBois were not helpful.|$|E
25|$|Cutolo overplayed {{his hand}} in the Cirillo affair. His former {{political}} protectors turned and provided their support to his main rival Carmine Alfieri. When his main 'military' chief, Vincenzo Casillo was killed in January 1983 by the allies of Alfieri, it was clear Cutolo had lost the war. His power declined considerably. Not only Cutolo but many other Camorra gangs understood the shift in the balance of power caused by the death of Casillo. They abandoned the NCO and allied themselves with Alfieri. His sister who ran the business was arrested in 1993.
