Furthermore, the ease of sponge aquaculture means that the whole family can {{be involved in the}} production process. This results in a profitable family business which conforms to traditional discourses of “family farms”, increasing the likelihood of sea sponge aquaculture adoption. In addition, it is common for sea sponge farms to be located close to family homes allowing for continual <b>access,</b> <b>monitoring,</b> modification and work to be completed on the farm.|$|E

50|$|Effectively {{measuring}} human {{risk behavior}} {{is difficult because}} risky behaviors, beliefs and perceptions are often unknown. In addition attacks such as phishing, social engineering, incidents such as data leakage and sensitive data posted on social media sites and even breaches go undetected and unknown {{making it difficult to}} determine and measure points of failure. Often, attacks, incidents and breaches are reacted to or reported from outside the compromised organization after attackers have covered their tracks, and thus cannot be researched and measured proactively. In addition, malicious traffic often goes unnoticed because attackers often spy and mimic known behavior in order to prevent any intrusion detection or <b>access</b> <b>monitoring</b> alerts.|$|E

40|$|An {{increasing}} number of democratically elected governments including Sri Lanka are facing challenge of terrorism. The United Nations has identified terrorism {{as a threat to}} good governance. According to the prevailing situation of our country, security has become the most concerned for everybody since the high involvement of present humanity rescue mission. Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF) has to face severe threats from LTTE carders. However, there is no proper Access Control and Monitoring System for authorization process at main guard rooms of SLAF. Because of this security weakness, enemy may enter in to any SLAF camp easily. New <b>Access</b> <b>Monitoring</b> and Control System was implemented with the help of available resources like personal service identification card which has been encoded as a secret data, using simple magnetic card reader with keyboard emulation mode and thin client terminal for data reader from service identity card and display details with photograph of serviceman. Further voice alert have been improved to draw attention of the policeman when unauthorized movements take place through the guard room. In the implementation process, SQL Server,. Net Environment with windows 2003 server, web and client server technology have been used with more security features. The <b>Access</b> <b>Monitoring</b> and Control System have been implemented as a pilot project at Sri Lanka Air Force Head Quarters. The system evaluation has found that this has improved the mechanism of identification of authorized and unauthorized people efficiency, reducing the queue and authentication time. It is expected to improve the security of serviceman and to get an online parade sheet preparation facility through improved management decision process with concurrent attendant details; and in addition to that a new weapon checking process has also been confirmed from civil society security. Finally, still there is no computer-based authentication process is used in any forces in Sri Lanka; this is the first experience for serviceman.

40|$|Object-based sound reproduction, {{on the one}} hand, allows sound {{engineers}} to interact with sound objects, not only during production {{but also in the}} reproduction venue. On the other hand object-based systems are quite complex: Multicore audio processors are used to render complex sound scenes consisting of hundreds of audio objects to be reproduced using a large number of loudspeaker channels. This results in the need for applications optimally adapted to the user. Working tasks need to be parallelized. This paper outlines a software architecture which helps to incorporate the multitude of audio processing components of an object-based spatial audio environment into a unified system.
