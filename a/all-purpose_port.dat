40|$|Near Gaza City a {{deep sea}} port {{will be built}} {{to stimulate the economy}} of Palestine. The Palestinians wish to have an <b>all-purpose</b> <b>port</b> (containers, bulk, ro-ro, multi purpose, fishery and ferries) Within this Master's Thesis three {{possible}} port layout alternatives are generated 5. The three layouts are based on the traffic forecast provided by Grabowsky&Poort and local conditions. To find out which of three alternatives is the better, a number of calculations are made to obtain more information on: 9 ̆ 5 the effects of a calamity with a LPG carrier; 9 ̆ 5 port's downtime due to excessive waves; 9 ̆ 5 nautical quality level; The effects of a calamity concerning the handling of LPG are estimated based on dispersion relations. The best solution to minimize damage, is to pose limitations on other port activities, during the passage and mooring of a LPG carrier. It is chosen not to skip the handling of LPG, because by building this port the Palestinians should be independent from foreign ports. Leaving the handling of LPG to other ports is not in line with this goal. The wave induced downtime is estimated based on a database of measurements 50 km off the shore of Gaza. The wave pattern inside the port is established in two steps. The first step reaches from 50 km off-shore to the port's entrance. Use is made of the software package HISWA. The second step reaches from the port's entrance to the quays. This step is made {{with the help of the}} computer program DIFFRAC. The nautical quality level is estimated with the help of SHIPMA. There are only slight differences in the 'quality' of the approach between the alternatives. The three alternative port lay-outs are evaluated with a Multi Criteria Evaluation. Criteria that are used are (among others) : downtime, safety and costs. Alternative 3 turns out to be the better alternative, but also the most expensive. The decision of which alternative to choose is therefore in the hands of the Port Authorities. They may choose depending on how much money they want to spend extra, to obtain a better port. At the end of the report a number of conclusions and recommendations concerning the Gaza Sea Port are given. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
