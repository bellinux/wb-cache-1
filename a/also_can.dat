5|$|The {{coasts of}} the Kandalaksha Gulf and the Barents Sea are {{important}} breeding grounds for bearded seals and ringed seals. Gray seals are rare and endemic to the Barents Sea. Greenland seals, or harp seals, <b>also</b> <b>can</b> {{be seen from}} time to time.|$|E
5|$|Bounty Hunter: A new mode {{introduced}} in the game. If an online player creates too much chaos in the world, the mode will be initiated. Police, alongside one to three other players, will join the player's game {{with the hope of}} killing the hunted and claiming the bounty, which gives them experience points. The hunted could either strike back at the hunters by killing them, which gives them greater rewards, or escape from them until the bounty expires. The hunted, meanwhile, <b>also</b> <b>can</b> be assisted by another player if that player chooses to join the hunted. Players can manually place a bounty on themselves using the in-game smartphone.|$|E

5|$|Exposure to lead <b>also</b> <b>can</b> be {{evaluated}} by measuring erythrocyte protoporphyrin (EP) in blood samples. EP {{is a part}} of red blood cells known to increase when the amount of lead in the blood is high, with a delay of a few weeks. Thus EP levels in conjunction with blood lead levels can suggest the time period of exposure; if blood lead levels are high but EP is still normal, this finding suggests exposure was recent. However, the EP level alone is not sensitive enough to identify elevated blood lead levels below about 35μg/dL. Due to this higher threshold for detection and the fact that EP levels also increase in iron deficiency, use of this method for detecting lead exposure has decreased.|$|E
5|$|In addition, some {{independent}}s {{have won}} seats through party lists by being elected {{as an independent}} running on a party's list, and Ivan Grubišić's list of non-partisan candidates has won seats as well. Since individuals (not parties) possess parliamentary seats once won, there <b>also</b> <b>can</b> be (and have been) instances where seat-holders became independent or switched to another political party.|$|E
5|$|Lambeosaurus, {{best known}} through L. lambei, was {{quite similar to}} Corythosaurus in {{everything}} but {{the form of the}} head adornment. Compared to Corythosaurus, the crest of Lambeosaurus was shifted forward, and the hollow nasal passages within were {{at the front of the}} crest and stacked vertically. It <b>also</b> <b>can</b> be differentiated from Corythosaurus by its lack of forking nasal processes making up part of the sides of the crest, which is the only way to tell juveniles of the two genera apart, as the crests took on their distinctive forms as the animals aged.|$|E
50|$|Jackfruit {{industries}} are established in Sri Lanka and Vietnam, where the fruit is processed into {{products such as}} flour, noodles, papad, and ice cream. It is <b>also</b> <b>canned</b> and sold as a vegetable for export.|$|R
50|$|The {{film was}} {{predominantly}} shot across London, with scenes <b>also</b> <b>canned</b> at Buckingham Palace {{and at a}} Hilton Hotel. The producers had earlier location scouted {{in the city and}} took music director, A. R. Rahman along to get a feel of the city.|$|R

5|$|Newport News is {{also served}} by several {{television}} stations. The Hampton Roads designated market area (DMA) is the 43rd {{largest in the}} U.S. with 712,790 homes (0.64% of the total U.S.). The major network television affiliates are WTKR-TV 3 (CBS), WAVY 10 (NBC), WVEC-TV 13 (ABC), WGNT 27 (CW), WTVZ 33 (MyNetworkTV), WVBT 43 (Fox), and WPXV 49 (ION Television). The Public Broadcasting Service station is WHRO-TV 15. Newport News residents <b>also</b> <b>can</b> receive independent stations, such as WSKY broadcasting on channel 4 from the Outer Banks of North Carolina and WGBS-LD broadcasting on channel 11 from Hampton.|$|E
5|$|Regular bus {{services}} with minivans and taxis <b>also</b> <b>can</b> be found. There are three bus terminals {{operating in the}} town such as the Buses to Sepilok, Local Bus Terminal and the Long Distance Bus Terminal. The long-distance bus terminal is located about 4km north of the town while the local bus connects with {{the centre of the}} town.|$|E
5|$|Solsticial {{alignments}} <b>also</b> <b>can</b> {{be seen as}} {{displays of}} power. When viewed from a ceremonial plaza on the Island of the Sun (the mythical origin place of the Sun) in Lake Titicaca, the Sun was seen to rise at the June solstice between two towers on a nearby ridge. The sacred {{part of the island}} was separated from the remainder of it by a stone wall and ethnographic records indicate that access to the sacred space was restricted to members of the Inca ruling elite. Ordinary pilgrims stood on a platform outside the ceremonial area to see the solstice Sun rise between the towers.|$|E
50|$|Bonito under 1 kg or so (called palamut in Turkish) {{are often}} grilled as steaks. Larger bonito (torik in Turkish) are cut into steaks and {{preserved}} as lakerda. Bonito is <b>also</b> <b>canned,</b> but canned bonito del norte (Spanish) is not bonito, but albacore tuna.|$|R
5000|$|The p110 subunit <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be {{recruited}} independently of p85. For example, Grb2 <b>can</b> <b>also</b> bind the Ras-GEF Sos1, leading to activation of Ras. Ras-GTP then activates the p110 subunit of PI3K. Other adaptor molecules such as insulin receptor substrate (IRS) <b>can</b> <b>also</b> activate p110.|$|R

5|$|The School of Music is {{also home}} to a number of ensembles, such as the 80-to-90-member Symphony Orchestra, Jazz Ensemble, Concert Band, and Percussion and MIDI Ensembles. Students <b>also</b> <b>can</b> opt to form their own small Chamber Ensembles, either for course credit or independently. The {{contemporary}} Sonic Generator group, backed by the GVU and in collaboration with the Center for Music Technology, performs a diverse lineup of music featuring new technologies and recent composers.|$|E
5|$|The {{governor}} <b>also</b> <b>can</b> {{influence the}} state court system through the appointment of judges. In Indiana, when vacancies occur on the Supreme Court, Tax Court, and circuit courts, the Judicial Nominating Commission interviews candidates and sends a list of three candidates for each vacancy to the governor, who chooses one. Justices of the peace and superior courts judges are elected in Indiana; if a vacancy occurs (such as by death or resignation) the governor may make an appointment, who holds the office until the next general election. The authority to make such appointments gives the governor considerable sway in setting {{the makeup of the}} judiciary.|$|E
5|$|The most {{recognized}} {{marker of}} acute Chagas disease is called Romaña's sign, which includes {{swelling of the}} eyelids {{on the side of}} the face near the bite wound or where the bug feces were deposited or accidentally rubbed into the eye. Rarely, young children, or adults may die from the acute disease due to severe inflammation/infection of the heart muscle (myocarditis) or brain (meningoencephalitis). The acute phase <b>also</b> <b>can</b> be severe in people with weakened immune systems.|$|E
50|$|Poor living {{conditions}} <b>can</b> <b>also</b> cause {{a very bad}} effect on the population; diseases such as malaria and HIV/AIDS <b>can</b> <b>also</b> contribute to this. Lack of nutrients, poor sanitation and poor health institutions. Death rate and birth rate <b>can</b> <b>also</b> {{have a negative effect}} on the population.|$|R

5|$|The {{positive}} charge in ions {{is achieved by}} stripping away electrons from atomic nuclei. The number of electrons removed is related to either the increase in temperature or the local density of other ionised matter. This <b>also</b> <b>can</b> be accompanied by the dissociation of molecular bonds, though this process is distinctly different from chemical processes of ion interactions in liquids or the behavior of ions existing in metals. The response of plasma to electromagnetic fields can be usefully employed in many modern technological devices, such as plasma televisions or plasma etching.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} historians {{have studied the}} {{surviving}} Pipe rolls, using them {{as the basis for}} study of financial and governmental history, especially of the medieval era. A study from 1925 compiled the royal income that passed through the Exchequer for each year of Henry II and Richard I, as well as a sample of some years from John's reign, attempting to compare how the royal revenues compared in the various reigns. Recent work by Nick Barratt on the reigns of Richard and John have updated the earlier research. Historian David Carpenter has carried out further studies on the early years of King Henry III's reign. The Pipe rolls have also been used to identify royal officials, especially those that were involved in local government and were not high ranking. Because they recorded judicial fines, the Pipe rolls <b>also</b> <b>can</b> be used to shed light on how the judicial system in medieval England worked, as well as identifying royal judges. Although they don't provide exact revenue figures, most historians believe they represent a close approximation of revenue, and can be used to gain a general understanding of how much financial resources the English kings had available in the Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|Brood {{parasitism}} by brown-headed cowbirds is common, {{with up to}} 25% of Carolina wren nests {{being affected}} in certain regions such as Oklahoma and Alabama. Cowbird parasitism peaks in April at 41%, and is as low as 8% and 0% in July and August, respectively. Female cowbirds sometimes eject Carolina wren eggs before laying their own, and even if host eggs are retained, the size of cowbird eggs negatively affect the hatching success of wren eggs. As a result, cowbirds may {{have a significant impact}} on the reproductive success of wrens. The feeding rate for cowbird nestlings is higher than wren feeding rates, and some have been raised to independence. This <b>also</b> <b>can</b> be detrimental to the survival of wren nestlings. A rare instance of brood-parasitism by a house finch has been recorded. The rate of brood parasitism is thought to be lower in more natural and concealed nesting locations. Body parasites such as the larvae of blowflies feed on nestlings and the blood loss weakens nestlings. Fellow species of wren such as Bewick's wren and the winter wren compete for nesting locations and food, respectively.|$|E

5|$|Discoloration {{of teeth}} {{may result from}} {{bacteria}} stains, tobacco, tea, coffee, foods {{with an abundance of}} chlorophyll, restorative materials, and medications. Stains from bacteria may cause colors varying from green to black to orange. Green stains also result from foods with chlorophyll or excessive exposure to copper or nickel. Amalgam, a common dental restorative material, may turn adjacent areas of teeth black or gray. Long term use of chlorhexidine, a mouthwash, may encourage extrinsic stain formation near the gingiva on teeth. This is usually easy for a hygienist to remove. Systemic disorders <b>also</b> <b>can</b> cause tooth discoloration. Congenital erythropoietic porphyria causes porphyrins to be deposited in teeth, causing a red-brown coloration. Blue discoloration may occur with alkaptonuria and rarely with Parkinson's disease. Erythroblastosis fetalis and biliary atresia are diseases which may cause teeth to appear green from the deposition of biliverdin. Also, trauma may change a tooth to a pink, yellow, or dark gray color. Pink and red discolorations are also associated in patients with lepromatous leprosy. Some medications, such as tetracycline antibiotics, may become incorporated into the structure of a tooth, causing intrinsic staining of the teeth.|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the Kwan Um School of Zen, people became Dharma Teachers rather quickly, mostly out of need in order to run practice. The current requirement is that a person must take the five precepts after at least four days of retreat, or an agreed upon time by the guiding teacher of a Zen Center. To become a Dharma Teacher in Training will take the individual the minimum of two years after taking the five precepts. This <b>also</b> <b>can</b> only be approved of by the guiding teacher. The student will then take the ten precepts. To become a Dharma Teacher, one must complete a minimum of two years of training as a Dharma Teacher in Training that includes a course of study and certain amount of time attending retreats and serving certain practice roles. It takes a minimum of five years after becoming a Dharma Teacher to become a Senior Dharma Teacher and this must be approved by the guiding teacher. At this time, the person will take the sixteen precepts. Receiving inga (inka) only comes when a student has proven satisfactorily in further training sanctioned by a Zen Master and members of the school. Becoming a Zen Master will require the sanction of several Zen Masters in and outside the school.|$|E
5|$|Shielding gas {{mixtures}} {{of three or}} more gases are also available. Mixtures of argon, carbon dioxide and oxygen are marketed for welding steels. Other mixtures add {{a small amount of}} helium to argon-oxygen combinations, these mixtures are claimed to allow higher arc voltages and welding speed. Helium also sometimes serves as the base gas, with small amounts of argon and carbon dioxide added. However, because it is less dense than air, helium is less effective at shielding the weld than argonwhich is denser than air. It <b>also</b> <b>can</b> lead to arc stability and penetration issues, and increased spatter, due to its much more energetic arc plasma. Helium is also substantially more expensive than other shielding gases. Other specialized and often proprietary gas mixtures claim even greater benefits for specific applications.|$|E
