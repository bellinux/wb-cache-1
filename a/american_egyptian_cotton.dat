25|$|India's cotton-processing sector changed during EIC {{expansion}} in India {{in the late}} 18th and early 19th centuries. From focusing on supplying the British market to supplying East Asia with raw cotton. As the Artisan produced textiles were no longer competitive with those produced Industrially, and Europe preferring the cheaper slave produced, long staple <b>American,</b> and <b>Egyptian</b> <b>cottons,</b> for its own materials.|$|R
5000|$|Originally it was {{designed}} to spin best <b>Egyptian</b> <b>cottons,</b> in what was technically termed [...] "combed" [...] and [...] "super carded yarns." [...] However, in 1913 it started spinning mediums, 34s to 78s from <b>American,</b> Brazilian and <b>Egyptian.</b> By 1916 it had dropped Brazilian and did 40s to 90s, it then in 1917 purchased combing equipment and produced up to 120s then by 1929 it purchased Egyptian solely and ran 140s.

The cotton count {{is a measure of the}} fineness if the yarn- the higher number being the finer. <b>Egyptian</b> <b>cotton</b> has the longest staple so is most suitable for fine counts.|$|R
50|$|The term <b>Egyptian</b> <b>cotton</b> {{is usually}} {{applied to the}} extra-long-staple cotton {{varieties}} produced in Egypt (Giza 45, Giza 70, Giza 77, Giza 87, Giza 88, Giza 92, Giza 93) and used in luxury and upmarket brands worldwide. Giza 45 has the highest thread count, ranging up to 1000 threads per square inch. The majority of <b>Egyptian</b> <b>cotton</b> export is long-staple cotton, not ELS <b>cotton.</b> <b>Egyptian</b> ELS varieties amount to about 7% of annual global ELS/LS cotton exports, and amount to approximately 25% of <b>Egyptian</b> <b>cotton</b> exports.|$|R
40|$|Copyright 2008 Elsevier B. V., All rights reserved. Signaling {{cross-talk}} between wound- and pathogen-response pathways influences {{resistance of}} plants to insects and disease. To elucidate potential interactions between salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) defense pathways, we exploited {{the availability of}} characterized mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. and monitored resistance to <b>Egyptian</b> <b>cotton</b> worm (Spodoptera littoralis Boisd.; Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). This generalist herbivore is sensitive to induced plant defense pathways and is thus a useful model for a mechanistic analysis of insect resistance. As expected, treatment of wild-type Arabidopsis with JA enhanced resistance to <b>Egyptian</b> <b>cotton</b> worm. Conversely, the coil mutant, with a deficiency in the JA response pathway, was more susceptible to <b>Egyptian</b> <b>cotton</b> worm than wild-type Arabidopsis. By contrast, the npr 1 mutant, with defects in systemic disease resistance, exhibited enhanced resistance to <b>Egyptian</b> <b>cotton</b> worm. Pretreatment with SA significantly reduced this enhanced resistance of npr 1 plants but had no influence on the resistance of wild-type plants. However, exogenous SA reduced the amount of JA that <b>Egyptian</b> <b>cotton</b> worm induced in both npr 1 mutant and wild-type plants. Thus, this generalist herbivore engages two different induced defense pathways that interact to mediate resistance in Arabidopsis. ?? Springer-Verlag 2001...|$|R

It is considered the next best quality after high quality <b>Egyptian</b> <b>cotton</b> by some authorities. Pima cotton is grown in the American southwest. Not all products bearing the Pima name are made with the finest cotton. The Pima name is now used by cotton-producing nations such as Peru, Australia and Israel.|$|R
30|$|The {{planted area}} of <b>Egyptian</b> <b>cotton</b> and {{yield per unit}} area is decreasing. This is {{attributed}} to two main causes: (1) The farmers delay the planting date for a month after March 30 (the recommended sowing date) to get complete winter crop especially wheat before <b>cotton.</b> (2) The <b>Egyptian</b> <b>cotton</b> cultivars were bred as a full season crop (180 [*]days) grown from mid-March to mid-September. Consequently, the <b>Egyptian</b> <b>cotton</b> cultivars cannot tolerate the environmental stress of late sowing and often result in progressively decreasing yield. Many reports emphasized the adverse effects of late planting on yield (Silvertooth 2001; Norton and Clark 2004; Mahdy et al. 2018). Cotton breeders initiated and advocated the need for considering the concept of double cropping of summer <b>Egyptian</b> <b>cotton</b> with winter crops. Nowadays, late planting system is considered an agricultural practice adopted by the <b>Egyptian</b> <b>cotton</b> farmers in some areas. This is usually done due to changing economics of <b>Egyptian</b> <b>cotton</b> production due to {{the high costs of}} inputs and low net income of outputs. Several publications in this topic were published (Abo El-Zahab et al. 2007 and 2008; Baker et al. 2012). Selection of different genotypes under environmental stress conditions {{is considered one of the}} main tasks of plant breeders for exploiting genetic variations to improve stress-tolerant cultivars (Clark et al. 1984). Schnell and Becker (1986) stated that the population structure type to be produced for commercial use is the breeder’s decision. Moreover, breeding new varieties process nearly always implies that the genetic material passes through different several population structures before reaching the final one. These hints should sufficiently elucidate the relevance of examining the various population structures for the effects of the two factors, heterogeneity and heterozygosity, upon the yield level and yield stability.|$|R

40|$|The {{induction}} {{of plant}} defenses by insect feeding is regulated via multiple signaling cascades. One of them, ethylene signaling, increases susceptibility of Arabidopsis to the generalist herbivore <b>Egyptian</b> <b>cotton</b> worm (Spodoptera littoralis; Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). The hookless 1 mutation, which affects a downstream component of ethylene signaling, conferred resistance to <b>Egyptian</b> <b>cotton</b> worm {{as compared with}} wild-type plants. Likewise, ein 2, a mutant in a central component of the ethylene signaling pathway, caused enhanced resistance to <b>Egyptian</b> <b>cotton</b> worm that was similar in magnitude to hookless 1. Moreover, pretreatment of plants with ethephon (2 -chloroethanephosphonic acid), a chemical that releases ethylene, elevated plant susceptibility to <b>Egyptian</b> <b>cotton</b> worm. By contrast, these mutations in the ethylene-signaling pathway had no detectable effects on diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) feeding. It is surprising {{that this is not}} due to nonactivation of defense signaling, because diamondback moth does induce genes that relate to wound-response pathways. Of these wound-related genes, jasmonic acid regulates a novel β-glucosidase 1 (BGL 1), whereas ethylene controls a putative calcium-binding elongation factor hand protein. These results suggest that a specialist insect herbivore triggers general wound-response pathways in Arabidopsis but, unlike a generalist herbivore, does not react to ethylene-mediated physiological changes...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to develop a}} numerical process {{that can be used}} as a quality criterion to determine the technological value of the <b>Egyptian</b> <b>cotton</b> varieties, which in turn would denote the end-use of their fibers. However the material used in the study comprised the 6 <b>Egyptian</b> <b>cotton</b> varieties Giza 70, Giza 80, Giza 86, Giza 88, Giza 90 and Giza 92. According to the local practice in Egypt, Giza 70, Giza 88 and Giza 92 belong to the Extra-Long Staple (ELS) category, while Giza 80, Giza 86 and Giza 90 are included under the Long Staple (LS) category. The regression analysis of the relationships between fiber properties and yarn skein strength (lea product) of the 2 carded ring counts 40 and 50 Ne, was employed to drive an equation for calculating the Multiplicative Analytic Hierarchy Process (MIAHP) values. The values of the MIAHP have been used as numerical determinations of the technological values of the <b>Egyptian</b> <b>cotton</b> varieties. Nevertheless, the findings of this study clarified that with respect to the criteria weights, the pair-wise comparisons denoted that fiber length properties of <b>Egyptian</b> <b>cotton</b> ranked first where they revealed the most dominant effect on yarn strength, while tensile properties ranked second with a relative weight close to that of fiber length. On the contrary, the relative weight of fiber fineness (micronaire reading) was found to be marginal. With regard to the relative weight of sub-criterion, the pair-wise comparisons indicated that the role of fiber tenacity as a determinant of yarn strength is much superior to that of fiber elongation. Further the global weights of the sub-criterion of fiber length pointed out that the UHML (upper half mean length) plays an important role in determining yarn strength of the <b>Egyptian</b> <b>cotton</b> comparing with either the UI (uniformity index) or the SFC (short fiber content). In conformity with the values of the MIAHP, it was found that in the order of descending rank, Giza 88 ranked first, followed by Giza 92, Giza 70, Giza 86, Giza 80 and finally Giza 90...|$|R
40|$|The authors examine risk {{management}} options for <b>Egyptian</b> <b>cottons,</b> the export prices for which are volatile. They use regression analysis to establish whether Egyptian cotton's prices can be effectively hedged by using existing futures contracts on the New York Cotton Exchange. They find {{no relationship between}} the movements in prices of Egyptian long and extra-long cottons and prices for the base quality of U. S. medium staple cotton traded on the New York futures market. (Probably because <b>Egyptian</b> <b>cotton</b> prices are government-determined, U. S. medium staple cotton prices are influenced by price support policies unrelated to the longer staple markets, and the fiber of the cottons analyzed have different physical characteristics.) So, the New York cotton futures market's No. 2 contract is not an appropriate mechanism for hedging the price risk facing <b>Egyptian</b> <b>cotton</b> under present procedures for determining prices - and probably not under market-determined prices. If the cotton market in Egypt is liberalized, cotton prices there may correlate more with prices elsewhere - especially for the longer staple cottons. The authors extend their regression analysis to the prices of other medium staple cottons - Australian, Central Asian, Mexican, Pakistani, and Turkish - to determine how they behave relative to U. S. medium staple cotton prices. None of these prices had short-term movements closely related to U. S. cotton prices, indicating mainly the influence of domestic policies on the U. S. market. Again, the New York futures No. 2 contract {{does not provide a}} satisfactory hedge for these cottons. The cotton futures contract recently introduced in New York (world cotton contract) - based on the Cotlook A Index - may prove useful for hedging the price risk for some cottons (especially Australian, Central Asian, and Pakistani) but apparently not <b>Egyptian</b> <b>cotton.</b> The authors recommend (together with privatizing the industry) establishing a domestic spot market to give transparency to the price-forming process. When the spot market is functioning well, establishing a foward market could provide a hedging instrument for <b>Egyptian</b> <b>cotton.</b> Markets and Market Access,Crops&Crop Management Systems,Agricultural Research,Textiles, Apparel&Leather Industry,Access to Markets...|$|R
