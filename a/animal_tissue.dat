5|$|Most {{grasshoppers}} are polyphagous, eating vegetation {{from multiple}} plant sources, {{but some are}} omnivorous and also eat <b>animal</b> <b>tissue</b> and animal faeces. In general their preference is for grasses, including many cereals grown as crops. The digestive system is typical of insects, with Malpighian tubules discharging into the midgut. Carbohydrates are digested mainly in the crop, while proteins are digested in the ceca of the midgut. Saliva is abundant but largely free of enzymes, helping to move food and Malpighian secretions along the gut. Some grasshoppers possess cellulase, which by softening plant cell walls makes plant cell contents accessible to other digestive enzymes.|$|E

40|$|Objective To {{establish}} {{a method for}} the determination of apramycin in <b>animal</b> <b>tissues</b> by LC-MS/MS. Methods The residues of apramycin in the test samples were extracted with 5 % trichloroacetic acid solution. After being cleaned up with SPE column, concentrated and reconstituted, the residues were detected by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry under multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode via positive-ion mode. Results The method showed a good linearity over the range of 0 ~ 5 mg/L for apramycin with r> 0. 995. The average recoveries were 80. 9 %~ 101 % at three or four spiked levels in <b>animal</b> <b>tissues,</b> and the relative standard deviations were 1. 17 %~ 12. 6 %. The limit of quantitation was 0. 030 mg/kg. Conclusion This method is highly sensitive, accurate and reproducible, and it is suitable {{for the detection of}} apramycin in <b>animal</b> <b>tissues...</b>|$|R

30|$|This work {{is aimed}} to {{evaluate}} a method to detect the residual magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) in <b>animal</b> <b>tissues.</b> Ferric ions released from MNPs through acidification with hydrochloric acid can be measured by complexation with potassium thiocyanate. MNPs in saline could be well detected by this chemical colorimetric method, whereas the detected sensitivity decreased significantly when MNPs were mixed with mouse tissue homogenates. In order to check the MNPs in <b>animal</b> <b>tissues</b> accurately, three improvements have been made. Firstly, proteinase K was used to digest the proteins that might bind with iron, and secondly, ferrosoferric oxide (Fe 3 O 4) was collected by a magnetic field which could capture MNPs and leave the bio-iron in the supernatant. Finally, the collected MNPs were carbonized in the muffle furnace at 420 °C before acidification to ruin the groups that might bind with ferric ions such as porphyrin. Using this method, MNPs in <b>animal</b> <b>tissues</b> could be well measured while avoiding the disturbance of endogenous iron and iron-binding groups.|$|R
25|$|Laser {{desorption}} electrospray ionization (LDESI) {{mass spectrometry}} is an ambient ionization technique applicable to plant and <b>animal</b> <b>tissue</b> imaging, live-cell imaging, {{and most recently}} to cell-by-cell imaging. This technique uses a mid-IR laser to ablate the sample which creates a cloud of neutral molecules. This cloud is then hit with the electrospray from above to cause ionization. The desorbed ions are then able to pass into the mass spectrometer for analysis. This method is also good for imaging in applications. The analyses can be desorbed through a pulsed laser irradiation without the need of a matrix. This method is best used with small organic molecules up to larger biomolecules as well.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{invention}} of the microscope in the seventeenth century it has been known that plant and <b>animal</b> <b>tissue</b> is composed of cells : the cell was discovered by Robert Hooke. The plant cell wall was easily visible even with these early microscopes but no similar barrier was visible on animal cells, though it stood to reason that one must exist. By the mid 19th century, this question was being actively investigated and Moritz Traube noted that this outer layer must be semipermeable to allow transport of ions. Traube had no direct evidence for the composition of this film, though, and incorrectly asserted that it was formed by an interfacial reaction of the cell protoplasm with the extracellular fluid.|$|E
25|$|Lavoisier showed {{at the end}} of the 18th {{century that}} organic {{substances}} consisted of a limited number of elements: primarily carbon and hydrogen and supplemented by oxygen and nitrogen. He went quickly focus on the isolation of these substances, often because they had an interesting pharmacological activity. Plants were the main source of such compounds, especially alkaloids and glycosides. It was long been known that opium, a sticky mixture of alkaloids (including codeine, morphine, noscapine, thebaine, and papaverine) from the opium poppy (Papaver somniferum), possessed a narcotic and at the same time mind-altering properties. Already in 1805 was morphine isolated by the German chemist Friedrich Sertürner and in the 1870s it was discovered that boiling morphine with acetic anhydride produced a substance with a strong pain suppressive effect: heroin. In 1815, Eugène Chevreul isolated from <b>animal</b> <b>tissue</b> cholesterol, a crystalline substance that belongs to the class of steroids, and in 1820 was strychnine, an alkaloid was isolated.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{extraction}} procedure is presented for sulphonamides (SAs) in <b>animal</b> <b>tissues</b> (raw meat and meat-based baby food), based on matrix solid phase dispersion (MSPD).

This procedure allowed to obtain quantitative recovery, high selectivity improved by a cool eluant, and easy application. Good recoveries are accompanied by low RSDs and not a significative matrix effect. The MSPD procedure, coupled with LC-MSMS analysis, provides very interesting LODs, due also to the concentration step.
