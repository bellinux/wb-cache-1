30|$|To {{get more}} {{quantitative}} {{information about the}} content variation versus the voltage magnitude and precursor concentration, EDX measurements were carried out for all samples, as shown in Figure  5 e. First of all, the contents of Cd and S were very close in the whole experimental range (with the detailed value shown in Additional file 1 : Table S 3). It has further proved that AC voltage has {{a significant contribution to}} form the CdS material with a quite high purity in this electric-field-assisted chemical deposition. This enables us to simplify the discussion of the amount of <b>as-formed</b> CdS with the Cd signal intensity. Secondly, the amount of <b>as-formed</b> CdS increased monotonously with increasing voltage under the same precursor concentration. It also significantly increased with higher precursor concentration at the same voltage magnitude. This is more obvious in the low voltage region (2.5 to 5.0  V). The ratio of the amount of <b>as-formed</b> CdS among different concentrations was close to 1 : 3 : 5, which was the ratio of the precursor concentrations. Finally, the Cd/S ratio was almost independent on the increasing voltage. Hence, the thickness of the CdS film can be effectively controlled by the precursor concentration and voltage magnitude (detailed relationship can be found in Additional file 1 : Figure S 4). Consider the CdS thickness, opening of the <b>as-formed</b> structures, and continuity of the film, a moderate experiment condition (6.0 to 7.0  V, 0.003  M precursor concentration) was seemly a suitable condition for application.|$|E
30|$|In general, this {{experiment}} has investigated a composite CdS/TiO 2 structure (TiO 2 nanotubes with homogeneous CdS coating inside) {{by a new}} ultrafast growth method with the growth time (~ 90  s) two orders of magnitude shorter than similar methods [27] at RT. The thickness of the <b>as-formed</b> film inside the tubes can be monotonously tuned by the voltage magnitude and precursor concentrations. The quality of deposition like the content ratio can be greatly improved by suitable voltage control. Furthermore, the crystalline structures of the <b>as-formed</b> CdS can be changed versus the different magnitude of voltage. The sensitized solar cells composed of as-fabricated complex structures on TiO 2 NTA substrate have quite a wide distribution of energy band gap, which indicates potential possibility in spectrum matching with band manipulation. As a result, the <b>as-formed</b> sample has shown a significant advantage than conventional structures in several aspects. We name the growth method “successive electrochemical deposition (SECD)” since its reactions took place in an open system.

30|$|Considering the {{obtained}} {{experimental results}} described above, some important points should be proposed and discussed. Firstly, in our recent works about some organogel systems based on organic compounds [47 – 51], functionalized imide derivatives, with the different substituent groups (such as cholesteryl, azobenzene, or luminol), molecular skeletons, or spacers, {{can have a}} profound effect on the gelation abilities and the <b>as-formed</b> nanostructures.

In addition, it should be noted that the present GO/PEI hydrogels are more environmentally friendly than organogels from different organic solvents.
