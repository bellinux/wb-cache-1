5|$|Fans gained {{national}} attention after giving a torrid time to David Beckham {{in his first}} <b>away</b> <b>match</b> of 1998–99 the season after the England midfielder was sent off for a petulant foul on Diego Simeone. Coinciding with the game, there were claims (and an image taken) that fans, organised by a hardcore, had hung an effigy of the player outside a local pub. Although it was later revealed that the pub was in South-East London, the heartland of West Ham's greatest rivals Millwall. The West Ham fans did, however, boo Beckham's every touch of the ball during the game.|$|E

5|$|In Keegan's first season, 1971–72, Liverpool {{missed out}} on winning the League Championship by a single point, the title going to Brian Clough's Derby County. Shankly {{maintained}} that Liverpool were denied a definite penalty in their crucial <b>away</b> <b>match</b> against Derby and then had a good goal disallowed {{towards the end of}} their final match against Arsenal. Both decisions cost the team a vital point which would have been enough to claim first place. Shankly took encouragement from the team's overall form, especially as they made a strong finish to the season, and he was confident of success in 1972–73.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} <b>away</b> <b>match</b> of the 2010–11 season, he scored an injury-time {{equaliser}} against Ipswich Town; {{the goal was}} Burnley's first from a corner kick for 15 months.

5|$|The 1953–54 season saw Edwards {{emerge as}} a regular in the United first team.

5|$|The league season {{concluded}} with an <b>away</b> <b>match</b> against divisional runners-up Scunthorpe; having gone two goals down York fought back to draw 2–2 with goals scored by Brobbel and Andrew.

York lost 1–0 to Fleetwood in the first leg at home; the goal came from former York player Matty Blair in the 50th minute, who scored from close range after Antoni Sarcevic's shot was blocked on the line.

At an awards night held at York Racecourse, Oyebanjo was voted Clubman of the Year for 2013–14.|$|E
5|$|The move to top team IFK Göteborg {{went well}} and Augustinsson played {{most of the}} games during the pre-season.
