50|$|Revive <b>Adserver</b> is an {{open-source}} {{advertising server}} that is licensed under the GNU General Public License. It features an integrated banner management interface and tracking system for gathering statistics. It {{used to be}} known under different names in the past, most recently as OpenX Source. In Sep 2013, OpenX Source was sold to Andrew Hill and rebranded Revive <b>Adserver.</b> The current code base for OpenX Enterprise and Revive <b>Adserver</b> (formerly known as OpenX Source) are completely separate.|$|E
50|$|Revive <b>Adserver</b> can be {{extended}} with help of plug-ins.|$|E
50|$|LiftDNA was {{the first}} SSP to build a RTB enabled yield {{optimization}} company that was directly integrated into Google's Doubleclick and OpenX (company)'s adservers, the two largest publisher adservers in the market. Its approach differed from existing SSP's (Rubicon Project, Admeld and Pubmatic) by leveraging Google and OpenX's <b>adserver</b> API. Instead of rebuilding an <b>adserver</b> from scratch, LiftDNA was able to leverage a publisher's existing platform and make accurate yield decisions with {{the added benefit of}} seeing all data and pricing within a publisher's <b>adserver,</b> rather than the partial view other SSP's had (only traffic redirected to SSP for optimization).|$|E
50|$|The open {{design of}} the Adtech <b>Adservers</b> allows for the {{implementation}} of external technologies. In targeting, Adtech collaborates with vendors such as Nugg and Wunderloop.|$|R
50|$|Second party data {{refers to}} an {{amalgamation}} of statistics related to cookie pools on external publications and platforms. The data is provided directly from the source (<b>adservers,</b> hosted solutions for social or an analytics platform). It is also possible to negotiate a deal with a particular publisher to secure specific data points or audiences.|$|R
50|$|On April 21, 2015 the aufeminin group {{announced}} {{the sale of}} its subsidiary Smart <b>AdServer</b> to private equity firm Cathay Capital.|$|E

50|$|The {{software}} enables {{web site}} administrators to rotate banners from both in-house advertisement campaigns {{as well as}} from paid or third-party sources, such as Google's AdSense. Revive <b>Adserver</b> provides standard banner rotation, click tracking, zone-based ad selection, zone-based campaign targeting, direct ad selection, ad targeting (per browser, domain, language, etc.), ad capping and support for Adobe Flash banners.|$|E
5000|$|The LiftDNA core {{technology}} solution enabled accurate impression and {{user level}} pricing for blind tag-based network demand which fed RTB / exchanges to bid accurately in the <b>adserver.</b> [...] "Predictive Pricing" [...] was a breakthrough that enabled publishers to host super auctions within their ad servers, with real-time bidders and traditional ad networks competing simultaneously for impressions the moment an ad call occurs. All of LiftDNA publisher clients came from existing SSP, where they subsequently saw revenue increases ranging from 50-150%.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Gator" [...] (also {{known as}} Gain <b>AdServer)</b> {{products}} collected personal information from its unknowing users, including all websites visited and portions {{of credit card}} numbers to target and display ads on the computers of web surfers. It billed itself as the [...] "leader in online behavioral marketing". The company {{changed its name to}} Claria Corporation on October 30, 2003 in an effort to [...] "better communicate the expanding breadth of offerings that they provide to consumers and advertisers", according to CEO and President Jeff McFadden.|$|E
50|$|The first local {{ad server}} was {{released}} by NetGravity in January 1996 for delivering online advertising at major publishing sites such as Yahoo! and Pathfinder. The company was founded by Tom Shields and John Danner, and based in San Mateo, California. In 1998, the company went public on NASDAQ (NETG), and was purchased by DoubleClick in 1999.

50|$|In 1999, Anne-Sophie Pastel, Marc-Antoine Dubanton and Cyril Vermeulen {{created the}} website aufeminin.com. In July 2000, the company became {{publicly}} traded and launched Smart <b>Adserver,</b> an independent ad serving software. In 2006, aufeminin.com bought the N°1 French cooking website, Marmiton.org.

50|$|DoubleClick offers {{technology}} {{products and}} services that are sold primarily to advertising agencies and media companies to allow clients to traffic, target, deliver, and report on their interactive advertising campaigns. The company's main product line is formally known as DART, which is designed for advertisers and publishers. DART automates the administration effort in the ad buying cycle for advertisers (DoubleClick for Advertisers, or DFA) and the management of ad inventory for publishers (DoubleClick for Publishers, or DFP). It is intended to increase the purchasing efficiency of advertisers and to minimize unsold inventory for publishers. DART Enterprise is the rebranded version of NetGravity <b>AdServer,</b> which DoubleClick acquired with its purchase of NetGravity in 1999. Unlike the DFA and DFP products which are both SaaS (Software as a Service) products, DART Enterprise is a standalone product running on Linux.|$|E
