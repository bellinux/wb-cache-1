40|$|A {{comparative}} electrical characterization {{study of}} aluminum oxide (Al 2 O 3) deposited by thermal and plasma-assisted <b>atomic</b> <b>layer</b> <b>depositions</b> (ALDs) {{in a single}} reactor is presented. Capacitance and leakage current measurements show that the Al 2 O 3 deposited by the plasma-assisted ALD shows excellent dielectric properties, such as better interfaces with silicon, lower oxide trap charges, higher tunnel barrier with aluminum electrode, and better dielectric permittivity (k = 8. 8), than the thermal ALD Al 2 O 3. Remarkably, the plasma-assisted ALD Al 2 O 3 films exhibit more negative fixed oxide charge density than the thermal ALD Al 2 O 3 layers. In addition, it is shown that plasma-assisted ALD Al 2 O 3 exhibits negligible trap-assisted (Poole-Frenkel) conduction unlike the thermal ALD Al 2 O 3 films, resulting in higher breakdown electric fields than the thermal ALD prepared films.

40|$|Carbon {{nanotube}} field-effect transistors (CNT FETs) {{have been}} proposed as possible building blocks for future nano-electronics. But a challenge with CNT FETs is that they appear to randomly display varying amounts of hysteresis in their transfer characteristics.

This study includes 94 CNT FET samples, providing an unprecedented basis for statistics on the hysteresis seen in five different CNT-gate configurations.

25|$|Supercritical fluids {{can be used}} {{to deposit}} {{functional}} nanostructured films and nanometer-size particles of metals onto surfaces. The high diffusivities and concentrations of precursor in the fluid as compared to the vacuum systems used in chemical vapour deposition allow deposition to occur in a surface reaction rate limited regime, providing stable and uniform interfacial growth. This is crucial in developing more powerful electronic components, and metal particles deposited in this way are also powerful catalysts for chemical synthesis and electrochemical reactions. Additionally, due to the high rates of precursor transport in solution, it is possible to coat high surface area particles which under chemical vapour deposition would exhibit depletion near the outlet of the system and also be likely to result in unstable interfacial growth features such as dendrites. The result is very thin and uniform films deposited at rates much faster than <b>atomic</b> <b>layer</b> <b>deposition,</b> the best other tool for particle coating at this size scale.|$|E

These precursors were dissolved in ethylcyclohexane and separately injected into a vaporizer. The deposition rates of the metal elements were investigated {{as a function of the}} input of the solutions. We started the ALD - PZT process with Ti(Oi - Pr) (2) (DPM) (2). When the input of one solution was increased, the deposition rates of the metal elements continued to increase or fluctuate, showing a complex interdependence. A PZT film deposited on a three-dimensional (3 D) structure had an inhomogeneous cation composition. The film uniformity on the 3 D structure was significantly improved by substituting Ti(Oi - Pr) (2) (DPM) (2) with Ti(Oi - Pr) (4). In this ALD - PZT process, self-regulated growths were confirmed for Pb and Zr.

40|$|Ternary PbTiOx {{films were}} {{deposited}} at 240 degrees C on Pt-covered Si substrates {{using a combination}} of liquid injection <b>atomic</b> <b>layer</b> <b>depositions</b> of binary TiOx and PbO films. Ti(OC 3 H 7) (2) (C 11 H 19 O 2) (2) [Ti(Oi-Pr) (2) (DPM) (2) ] and Pb(C 11 H 19 O 2) (2) [Pb(DPM) (2) ] dissolved in ethylcyclohexane and H 2 O were used as source materials. The deposition rates of Pb and Ti were enhanced in the ternary process compared to their binary processes under comparable deposition conditions. The Pb/Ti ratio of PbTiOx films saturated with an increase in Ti precursor input, while it continued to increase with an increasing Pb precursor input. The self-regulated growth nature of the Pb-O layer in the binary film growth was lost in the mixed PbTiOx process as a result of interaction with the predeposited Ti-O layer. It was confirmed that for the PbTiOx film to grow on Pt substrates, an initial incubation period is required. Both Pb-O and Ti-O layers shared a common incubation period of up to ten sequences. The incubation period was shortened by increasing the input of Pb precursor. It was independent of the input of the Ti precursor and the order of precursor supply. This variable incubation period was considered as a potential key issue for growing stoichiometric and uniform multicomponent films over three-dimensional (3 D) structures. The order of precursor supply affected the effective deposition rate after the incubation period. A sequence starting with a Ti precursor injection showed a higher growth rate than a sequence that started with a Pb precursor supply. A PbTiOx film was deposited on a 3 D substrate precoated with an Ir layer to demonstrate the uniformity in film thickness and cation composition. Although the present PbTiOx process does not have an ideal wide-process window in the cation composition, the PbTiOx film showed uniform coverage and the distribution of cation composition over the hole structure was within +/- 10 %.
