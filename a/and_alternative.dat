Until 1989, the Comics Code Authority (CCA), which imposed de facto censorship on comics sold through news stands in the United States, forbade any suggestion of homosexuality. Artists had to drop subtle hints while not stating directly a character's orientation. Overt gay and lesbian themes were first found in underground <b>and</b> <b>alternative</b> titles which did not carry the CCA's seal of approval.|$|E

5|$|Over 50% of MS {{patients}} may use complementary <b>and</b> <b>alternative</b> medicine, although numbers vary greatly {{depending on the}} definition of alternative medicine used. In the United States, {{it is estimated that}} 75% of the MS patient populations use at least one complementary <b>and</b> <b>alternative</b> medicine for treatment and symptomatic control. The evidence for effectiveness for such treatments in most cases is weak or absent. Examples of treatments used by patients include dietary supplementation and regimens such as vitamin D, calcium, vitamin B12, and antioxidants. The rationale behind the use of Vitamin D supplementation is that studies show an association between vitamin D deficiency and increasing progression of MS, as well as the anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin D.|$|E
