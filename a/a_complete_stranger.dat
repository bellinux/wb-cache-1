25|$|Townspeople sing joyfully of {{the peace}} that will follow the {{imminent}} wedding of the prince of Mantua and the princess of Bavaria. Young people look forward to songs and dancing, {{and a group of}} prisoners released by the King celebrate. A group of impoverished students, Spark, Hartmann, Facio enter hoping also to share in some fun while contemptuous of the townspeople. The King and his guards emerge from the palace. The King announces the arrival of the prince of Mantua to wed his daughter Elsbeth and encourages the celebration. A courtier explains that Elsbeth is grieving on the death of the court jester of whom she was fond. Marinoni, the prince of Mantua's aide-de-camp enquires about the festivities and the princess, but is mocked by the students. Fantasio enters and sings a ballad to the moon. The page of Elsbeth enters to tell the students to keep their voices down as they will disturb the princess; they enter the tavern. Elsbeth sings of her wonder at the change in her life, but Fantasio enters unseen and asks her if she is really in love – with <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> <b>stranger.</b> Elsbeth, startled, leaves repeating Fantasio's words. When Spark joins his friend Fantasio talks extravagantly of his feelings. Soon the funeral cortege of court jester St Jean passes by and Fantasio has the idea to take the appearance of the jester {{to gain access to the}} princess, and he and Spark enter the nearby tailor's shop to get the costume. This will also help him avoid being arrested for his debts by the police. The fatuous prince of Mantua and his aide Marinoni enter, and the prince, wanting to discover the real thoughts and feelings of his future wife determines to dress as a servant to find out; he and Marinoni exit to exchange their clothes. The students come in singing and Fantasio re-appears dressed as the old jester. Two sentries mistakenly let him into the palace grounds and he looks forward to his adventure and to meeting Elsbeth again.|$|E

This leads them to a clandestine laboratory where a secret experiment is taking place on board, with connections to Scully's child, William.

50|$|Seniority {{in years}} and old age is a respectful status in Samoan society where elders, <b>a</b> {{familiar}} or <b>complete</b> <b>stranger,</b> {{are referred to as}} tamā (father) or tinā (mother).

40|$|When {{searching for}} items {{in our daily}} lives, we typi-cally search for things that are {{familiar}} in places that are familiar, such as a knife in your kitchen. Inevitably, the search is much faster when you search for a knife in your own kitchen than in a friend’s or <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> <b>stranger’s</b> kitchen. But even in a stranger’s kitchen, you would still know to look in drawers or on the countertop. Thus, the types of top-down influences arising from scene context {{in each of these}} circumstances can come from a multitude of sources. It can include general semantic knowledge (like in a stranger’s kitchen) or knowledge of specific visual details or features (like in your own kitchen). The ques-tion remains whether either one or both of these top-down influences (general semantic and specific visual details) primarily affect how we search and whether target-object features may change this. In the present study, we exam-ined the contributions made by top-down knowledge of scene context and target features to searching in scenes. Scene Context and Search Guidance From early on, scene context has been known to be an important factor in determining eye movement and at-tention allocation (Buswell, 1935; Yarbus, 1967). Since then, many other studies have shown an effect of scene context on visual search (Castelhano & Henderson, 2007...|$|R

The next day, Dennis walks into the staff office of [...] TGS with Tracy Jordan, announcing he has found a new apartment and reads a heartfelt letter to Liz. The staff suddenly turns on Liz after Dennis walks out, and Jenna suggests to Liz that in light of the previous night's disaster, she should re-consider getting back together with him.

When Quintanilla, Jr. was trying to retrieve the fan club's bank statements, he said they had [...] "vanished". He found a letter in Saldívar's handwriting stating that Maria Elida had to close the bank account because of a major problem. According to the letter, {{a member of the}} fan club, Yvonne Perales, was sent to the bank to deposit $3,000 but Perales did not deposit the money and could not be found. The letter stated that Maria Elida found out about the situation [...] "too late" [...] and that Perales and the money were missing. Maria Elida then wrote checks to be cashed by Saldívar, even though the bank account had no funds. The letter said Maria Elida was closing the account for that reason and that the bank would have to cover the checks. Quintanilla, Jr. confronted Saldívar about Perales' identity; he said Saldívar knew nothing about her. Quintanilla, Jr. said Saldívar did not trust the treasurer of the fan club but she had trusted <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> <b>stranger</b> to deposit $3,000.

2500|$|To further confuse things, {{even the}} meaning of [...] "friend" [...] is subject to scrutiny.

2500|$|All these rituals are {{symbolic}} of one's development. Before each is performed, the individual spends time with community elders {{to prepare for}} the next stage. The elders' teachings are not written, but transmitted from generation to generation by oral tradition. The iziduko (clan) for instance—which matters most to the Xhosa identity (even more than names and surnames) are transferred {{from one to the other}} through oral tradition. Knowing your isiduko is vital to the Xhosas and it is considered a shame and uburhanuka (lack-of-identity) if one doesn’t know one's clan. This is considered so important that when two strangers meet for the first time, the first identity that gets shared is isiduko. It is so important that two people with the same surname but different clan are considered total strangers but the same two people from the same clan but different surnames are regarded as close relatives.

Based on the shortcomings found in current reputation systems, this thesis proposes and implements a reputation architecture called ORAS (online reputation aggregation system) Plus which provides a portable reputation mechanism for Web users. With ORAS Plus, users can search others' global reputation and obtain their own reputation cards which can be displayed at any website.

50|$|Newborns are {{exceptionally}} {{capable of}} facial discrimination and recognition shortly after birth.

At this stage, infants would focus their visual attention on pictures of their own mother for a longer period than <b>a</b> picture of <b>complete</b> <b>strangers.</b> Studies have shown that infants even as early as four days old look longer at their mothers’ face than at those of strangers only when the mother is not wearing a head scarf. This may suggest that hairline and outer perimeter of the face play an integral part in the newborn’s face recognition.
