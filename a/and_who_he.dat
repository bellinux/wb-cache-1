5|$|Feuchtwanger {{was horrified}} and incensed {{at the way}} in which his work had been {{manipulated}} and distorted, calling Harlan's film a Schandwerk ("a shameful work"). In 1941, he wrote an open letter to seven actors. Based on the sentiments expressed in the letter, it appears that Feuchtwanger was shocked that these men, whom he considered colleagues <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> knew were familiar with his work, would agree to participate in Goebbels' antisemitic propaganda film.|$|E

5|$|Convinced that Shogun is {{targeting}} him, {{he tries}} {{to distance himself from}} having witnessed the murder scene and avoid getting involved in New Gen, which draws the attention of the police. Between him being suspected, more New Gen murders occurring, and Shogun supposedly targeting him, Takumi finds himself experiencing hallucinations and paranoia, and is unsure of what is real <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> can trust. In one of his delusions, Shogun appears as an old man in a wheelchair and tells him that more people will die unless he wakes up.|$|E

5|$|Hergé {{retained}} the anti-German sentiment {{that he had}} first considered for King Ottokar's Sceptre through {{the inclusion of a}} German villain, Dr. Müller, who would go on to become a recurring character in the series. He based the character largely on Georg Bell, a Scottish forger who had been a vocal supporter of the Nazi regime, <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> had learned about from an article in anti-conformist Belgian magazine La Crapouillot (The Mortar Shell). Rather than Germans, Müller's henchmen were given the Russian names Ivan and Wronzoff, although the latter would be renamed Puschov by Michael Turner and Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper for the English translation.|$|E
5|$|Leader of the Opposition and Labour leader Ed Miliband, {{who knew}} Benn {{personally}} {{as a family}} friend, said:I think Tony Benn {{will be remembered as}} a champion of the powerless, as a conviction politician, as somebody of deep principle and integrity. The thing about Tony Benn is that you always knew what he stood for, <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> stood up for. And I think that's why he was admired right across the political spectrum. There are people who agreed with him and disagreed with him, including in my own party, but I think people admired that sense of conviction and integrity that shone through from Tony Benn.|$|E

25|$|Tevez has a {{distinctive}} burn scar that runs down his neck from {{his right ear}} to his chest. He was accidentally scalded with boiling water as a child, which caused third-degree burns and kept him hospitalised in intensive care for nearly two months.

25|$|The {{description}} {{of the young man}} with whom Beineman had last been seen alive was heard by a patrolman named Larry Mathewson, who believed the person described by Mrs. Goshe and others may be one John Norman Collins: a former fraternity member of his who had previously been interviewed but eliminated from police inquiries, <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> had himself seen riding his motorcycle around the Eastern Michigan University campus on the afternoon of July 23. When Mathewson questioned Collins on July 25 as to his movements two days earlier, he admitted that on the date in question he had been riding his Triumph Bonneville in the vicinity, and that he had stopped to converse with a former girlfriend of his while doing so (the point at which Mathewson had observed him). This former girlfriend was able to provide Mathewson with two recent photographs of Collins. When Mathewson showed these photographs to both Mrs. Goshe and her assistant, Patricia Spaulding, both women were adamant the man in the photographs was the same individual with whom Beineman had last been seen alive.|$|E
25|$|In October 2007, Roeder joined Championship side Norwich City, {{signing a}} {{contract}} until 2010, with Norwich {{bottom of the}} division and four points adrift of safety. His first game in charge was on 4 November in the East Anglian Derby against Ipswich Town, a match that ended 2–2 after Norwich had been 2–0 down at half-time. His first win came in the home game against Coventry City (24 November), which he followed up with a first away win of the season for Norwich in the 3-1 defeat of fellow strugglers Blackpool (27 November), who previously had not lost at home that season. He then guided the team out of the relegation zone with wins over Plymouth Argyle, Sheffield United, Scunthorpe United, Barnsley, Southampton, Preston North End and Cardiff City. The Canaries rose rapidly up the table {{as a result of}} this good run of form and, at one stage, it looked as though they could make a shock late burst into the play-offs, similar to the run under Nigel Worthington in the 2001/2002 season. Roeder began an overhaul of the squad in the January transfer window, releasing players such as Julien Brellier and David Strihavka who had been signed by his predecessor <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> did not consider to have a future at the club. He made the loan signing of Matty Pattison permanent and also renewed the loan deals for Ched Evans and Mo Camara. Roeder also made four loan signings including Matthew Bates, Keiran Gibbs, Alex Pearce and James Henry. Despite a poor run of form through February and March, Roeder kept Norwich in the Championship for another season, though survival was not confirmed until a 3-0 home win against QPR in the penultimate fixture of the season.|$|E

500|$|When Bellingham rose, {{he thanked}} the {{attorney}} general for rejecting the [...] "insanity" [...] strategy: [...] "I think {{it is far more}} fortunate that such a plea... should have been unfounded, than it should have existed in fact". He began his defence by asserting that [...] "all the miseries which it is possible for human nature to endure" [...] had fallen on him. He then read the petition that he had sent to the Prince Regent, and recalled his fruitless dealings with various government agencies. In his view the principal blame lay not with [...] "that truly amiable and highly lamented individual, Mr Perceval", but with Leveson-Gower, the ambassador in St Petersburg who he felt had originally denied him justice, <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> said deserved the shot rather than the eventual victim.|$|E
500|$|Lucas North {{appears to}} be a person divided between who he was prior to his incarceration <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> has become since.

[...] Following his release from prison, glimpses of him adjusting to the outside world—such as a scene in episode two in which Lucas lies on the floor rather than in a bed in order to sleep—reveal to the audience how much he is struggling, though he keeps it hidden from his teammates. Lucas also fights very hard to be accepted and to regain Harry's trust, but he does not always play by the rules. In the series seven finale, Lucas admits to having blamed Harry for his ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the second}} half of the war, {{political}} opposition within the Royalist senior leadership against Rupert continued to grow. Rupert's personality during the war had made him both friends and enemies. He enjoyed a [...] "frank and generous disposition", showed a [...] "quickness of... intellect", was prepared to face grave dangers, and could be thorough and patient when necessary. However, he lacked the social gifts of a courtier, and his humour could turn into a [...] "sardonic wit and a contemptuous manner": with a hasty temper, he was too quick to say who he respected, <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> disliked. The result was that, while Rupert could inspire great loyalty in some, especially his men, he also made many enemies at the Royal court. When he took Bristol, he also slighted the Marquess of Hertford, the lethargic but politically significant Royalist leader of the South-West. Most critically, Rupert fell out with George Digby, a favourite of both the King and the Queen. Digby was a classic courtier and Rupert fell to arguing with him repeatedly in meetings. The result was that towards the end of the war Rupert's position at court was increasingly undermined by his enemies.|$|E
