5|$|When Korea {{was split}} into two {{separate}} countries, North and South, along the 38th parallel tensions {{between the two countries}} were worsened when other countries began to get involved on both sides. The communist country of North Korea was supported by Russia, China and others, while the democratic South was supported by the United Nations and the United States. In 1950 the United States got involved and {{over the next three years}} more than 1.5 million US service members would serve in Korea. During the three years of the war 133 Medals of Honor were presented and although more than 150,000 Jewish <b>American</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women were serving in Korea at that time, not one received the Medal of Honor.|$|E

25|$|Starting in {{the first}} few years of the 2000 decade, Asian American {{earnings}} began exceeding all other racial groups for both men and women. For example, in 2008 Asian Americans had the highest median household income overall of any racial demographic. In 2012, Asian Americans had the highest educational attainment level and median household income of any racial demographic in the country. In 2015, Asian American men were the highest earning racial group as they earned 117% as much as white <b>American</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> Asian-American women earned 106% as much as white American women.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey of 1994 {{showed that}} 59.8% of <b>American</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> 51.2% of women had BMIs over 25. Morbid obesity—a BMI of 40 or more—was found in 2% {{of the men}} and 4% of the women. A survey in 2007 showed 63% of Americans are {{overweight}} or obese, with 26% in the obese category (a BMI of 30 or more). As of 2014, 37.7% of adults in the United States were obese, categorized as 35.0% of men and 40.4% of women; class 3 obesity (BMI over 40) values were 7.7% for men and 9.9% for women.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{military}} advice, {{the idea of}} China winning the war with Japan swiftly {{with only a few}} <b>American</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> planes was tempting to civilian leaders. It was adopted by top civilian officials including Treasury Secretary Morgenthau and President Roosevelt himself. However, the American attack never took place: The Nationalist Chinese had not built and secured any runways or bases close enough to reach Japan, just as {{the military}} had warned. The bombers and crews arrived after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, and were used for the war in Burma, as they lacked the range to reach Japan from the secure bases in China.|$|E

25|$|The {{neutrality}} of the United States {{was tested}} during the Napoleonic Wars. After the Chesapeake–Leopard affair, President Thomas Jefferson {{was faced with}} a decision to make regarding the situation at hand. In the end, he chose an economic option: the Embargo Act of 1807. Jefferson essentially closed all the ports overnight, putting a damper on the seaport town of Salem. The embargo of 1807 was the starting point on the path to the War of 1812 with Great Britain. Both Great Britain and France imposed trade restrictions in order to weaken each other's economies. This also had the effect of disrupting American trade and testing the United States' neutrality. As time went on, harassment of American ships by the British Navy increased. This included impressment and seizures of <b>American</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> goods.|$|E
25|$|Interracial {{marriage}} among Filipinos is common, as {{they have}} {{the largest number of}} interracial marriages among Asian immigrant groups in California, only Japanese Americans have a higher rate nationally. Compared to other Asian Americans, Filipinos Americans {{are more likely to have}} a Hispanic spouse. Statistically, Filipino American women are more likely to marry outside of their ethnicity (38.9 percent) than Filipino American men (17.6 percent); other Asian American populations have lower rates of marrying outside of their race than both Filipino <b>American</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women. Between 2008 and 2010, 48 percent of Filipino American marriages were with non-Asians. It is also noted that 21.8 percent of Filipino Americans are multiracial, second among Asian Americans. Depending on their parentage, multiracial Filipino Americans may refer to themselves as Mestizo, Tsinoy, Blackapino, and Mexipino.|$|E

[...] Hunter thanked the general for his service and then argued that the sole issue was [...] "unit cohesion," [...] mirroring a statement from former Secretary of State Colin Powell. After the debate, Kerr was found {{to be a member of}} Hillary Clinton's Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transsexual Americans For Hillary Steering Committee. Because of this, CNN removed footage of the question from future telecasts. The next day, Hunter sent a letter to Hillary Clinton that read: [...] "Dear Hillary Clinton, Regarding the [...] "plant", retired Brig. Gen. Keith H. Kerr, that you sent to ask me the question at the CNN-YouTube debate last night in Florida. Send more!!! Merry Christmas, Duncan Hunter."

2500|$|Throughout Hayakawa's career, many {{segments}} of American society {{were filled with}} feelings of the Yellow Peril due to circumstances surrounding World War I and World War II. This left Hayakawa constantly typecast as a villain or forbidden lover and unable to play heroic parts that would typically be given to white actors such as Douglas Fairbanks. Hayakawa's popularity and sex appeal ("his most rabid fan base was white women") upset many <b>American</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> exacerbated the Yellow Peril sentiments.|$|E
2500|$|AIDS {{was seen}} as a disease of gay, White, North <b>American</b> <b>men.</b> <b>And</b> people were really afraid of it. There were no {{treatments}} available in the Caribbean at the time, so AIDS really was a death sentence. You had people with Kaposi's sarcoma, people with violent diarrhea, who were just wasting away and then dying in really horrible and traumatic ways. To call what was going on here [...] "stigma and discrimination" [...] was really an understatement. In the ghettos they were putting tires around people who had AIDS and lighting the tires on fire. They were killing gay people because they thought AIDS was contagious. It was a very extreme environment, and really horrible things were happening.|$|E

[...] According to Anderson, such [...] "confusion" [...] between Native <b>American</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women was convenient to the Texians, who used it {{as an excuse to}} kill women and children. [...] According to the report by Col. Hugh McLeod, written March 20, 1840, of the 65 members of the Comanches' party, 35 were killed (30 adult males, three women, and two children), 29 were taken prisoner (27 women and children, and two old men), and one departed unobserved (described as a renegade Mexican).
