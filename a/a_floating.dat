50|$|<b>A</b> <b>float,</b> {{also called}} <b>a</b> bobber in the United States, is {{an item of}} angling {{equipment}} that {{is attached to the}} fishing line which serves several purposes. Firstly, it can suspend the bait at a predetermined depth; secondly, due to its buoyancy, it can carry the baited hook to otherwise inaccessible areas of water by allowing the float to drift in the prevailing current; and thirdly, <b>a</b> <b>float</b> also serves as a visual bite indicator. Fishing with <b>a</b> <b>float</b> is called float fishing.|$|R

5|$|Little {{is known}} about the ship's career other than that she was {{assigned}} to the newly formed Artillery Training Detachment in March 1870 and she was laid up each winter when the Gulf of Finland froze. Lava was reclassified as a coast defense ironclad on 13 February 1892 and turned over to the Port of Kronstadt for disposal on 6 July 1900, although she was not stricken until 17 August. The ship was used as <b>a</b> <b>floating</b> barracks by the Third Destroyer Division from 1902 to 1908 and was then used as an observation post during gunnery training. Lava was converted into a mine storage hulk in 1912 and renamed Blokshiv No. 1 on 14 April of that year. She was converted into <b>a</b> <b>floating</b> hospital in 1916 and may have received her old name at that time. She was abandoned by the Soviets in Helsingfors (Helsinki) when they were forced to withdraw from Finland in April 1918 according to the terms of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, but she was later returned by the Finns in 1922. The ship was supposedly broken up there around that time, but may have still been in existence in 1941.|$|E
