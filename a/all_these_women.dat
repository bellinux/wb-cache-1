5|$|The Indiana Woman's Suffrage Association {{was founded}} in 1851 by {{important}} suffrage leaders such as Agnes Cook, Mary B. Birdsall, Amanda M. Way, and Mary F. Thomas. With the exception of Way, <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>women</b> {{were the first to}} address the Indiana State Legislature on January 19, 1859, with petitions calling for women's suffrage, temperance, and equal rights. In 1854 Birdsall had purchased The Lily, the first U.S. newspaper edited by and for women, from its founder, Amelia Bloomer, and moved it to Richmond, Indiana. The newspaper had begun as a temperance newspaper but was later used to campaign for women's suffrage and rights.|$|E
5|$|The choreography for {{the ballet}} was {{elaborated}} by the ballerina's father, Filippo Taglioni. The audience's prurient delight in this scandalous scene is well conveyed by the reviewer for the Revue des Deux-Mondes: A crowd of mute shades glides through the arches. <b>All</b> <b>these</b> <b>women</b> cast off their nuns' costume, they {{shake off the}} cold powder of the grave; suddenly they throw themselves into the delights of their past life; they dance like bacchantes, they play like lords, they drink like sappers. What {{a pleasure to see}} these light women... The set for the ballet was an innovative and striking design by Henri Duponchel and Pierre-Luc-Charles Ciceri. Duponchel had also introduced technical innovations for the staging, including 'English traps' for the sudden appearance and disappearance of the ghosts. (Meyerbeer was led to complain that the spectacle was too much and was pushing his music into the background). Taglioni danced the Abbess only six times in Paris; she was replaced by Louise Fitzjames, (who danced the role 232 times).|$|E

For example, Mozart's later operas feature a series of memorable, strongly drawn female characters, in particular the so-called [...] "Viennese soubrettes" [...] who, in opera writer Charles Osborne's phrase, [...] "contrive to combine charm with managerial instinct". Music writer and analyst Gottfried Kraus has remarked that <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>women</b> were present, as prototypes, in the earlier operas; Bastienne (1768), and Sandrina (La finta giardiniera, 1774) are precedents for the later Constanze and Pamina, while Sandrina's foil Serpetta is the forerunner of Blonde, Susanna, Zerlina and Despina.|$|E

2500|$|Clinicians {{have responded}} that they are unwilling to {{consider}} the possibility of leaving potential deadly cancers alone because it is [...] "far-riskier" [...] than the alternative. Eric Winer, director of the breast cancer program at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, says, [...] "I don't know anyone who offers women the option of doing nothing." [...] Further complicating the issue of early diagnosis {{is the fact that it}} is currently impossible to distinguish malicious cancers from benign ones. Otis Brawley, a top official for the American Cancer Society, says that [...] "even if we overdiagnose 1 in 5, we have numerous studies showing that by treating <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>women,</b> we save a bunch of lives". For instance, a 2011 Cochrane review showed a sample of mammogram screening programs resulted in a 15% reduction in mortality rate despite over-diagnosis, indicating that mammography programs save lives regardless of over-diagnosis.|$|E

Adele and Duffy were the second wave of artists with a sound similar to Winehouse's.

In March 2011, the New York Daily News ran an article attributing the continuing wave of British female artists that {{have been successful in}} the United States to Winehouse and her absence. Spin magazine music editor Charles Aaron was quoted as saying, [...] "Amy Winehouse was the Nirvana moment for <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>women</b> [...] They can all be traced back to her in terms of attitude, musical styles or fashion."

Bunn said he was campaigning for the book following the conclusion of Fear Itself: The Fearless, when an editor pitched the idea of doing it as a Defenders title. However Bunn explained that beyond the name there is [...] "little connection" [...] to the Defenders. In November 2012, Marvel Comics teased the announcement of The Fearless Defenders by releasing an image of the word [...] "Fearless" [...] with the creative team of Bunn and artist Will Sliney. A week later, Marvel made the full announcement. Bunn said, [...] "The basic idea of the book is that Valkyrie is choosing a new team of Valkyrior, and she's been asked to choose <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>women</b> from the heroes of Midgard (Earth), instead of from Asgard". Bunn also said that Misty Knight co-stars in the series, [...] "They're our co-leads, {{and the rest of the}} team will build around them. I think it'll be interesting to see how the two of them see things differently. You've got Misty, who's a very street-level character. And you've got Valkyrie, who's a goddess". Dani Moonstar was revealed as the third member of team. Bunn said, [...] "She has such a connection to the Valkyrie. She was on the top of my list when I started putting together who I thought would be the core roster".|$|E

If you were the heir to great estates you would naturally rejoice in rendering services which might bring you into favour at court, and win for you honour and public standing; but you see you are the son of a master mariner, happily the owner of his own ship and of other properties which are sufficient to keep him in comfort, but which will naturally at the death of your mother and myself go to the girls, while you will have the Good Venture and my share in other vessels. But these are businesses that want looking after, and the income would go but a little way to support you in a position at court. You have now been two years away from the sea. That matters little; but if you were to continue in the royal service for a time you would surely become unfitted to return to the rough life of a master mariner. Fair words butter no parsnip, Ned.

Now I am not interested in how they died, or when they died, or whether they died. But I am interested in another analogous question--that of how they were born, and when they were born, and whether they were born. Do not misunderstand me. I do not dispute the existence of these women, or the veracity of those who have witnessed to them. I merely remark on the notable fact that only one of these victims, the Maidenhead girl, is described as having any home or parents.

She is all soul, and heart, and intellect, with never a bit of human nature to catch hold of her by. Her beauty, it appals one, it is so painfully indescribable.

You do not--and I thank you for it--impress me with the idea that you are the only women on earth. You, even you, possess tempers of your own. I am inclined to think you take an interest in your clothes. I would not be sure, even, that you do not mingle a little of [...] "your own hair" [...] (you know what I mean) with the hair of your head. There is in your temperament a vein of vanity, a suggestion of selfishness, a spice of laziness. I have known you a trifle unreasonable, a little inconsiderate, slightly exacting. Unlike the heroine of fiction, you have a certain number of human appetites and instincts; a few human follies, perhaps, a human fault, or shall we say two? In short, dear Ladies, you also, even as we men, are the children of Adam and Eve. Tell me, if you know, where I may meet with this supernatural sister of yours, this woman that one reads about. She never keeps any one waiting while she does her back hair, she is never indignant with everybody else in the house because she cannot find her own boots, she never scolds the servants, she is never cross with the children, she never slams the door, she is never jealous of her younger sister, she never lingers at the gate with any cousin but the right one.|$|E
