5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) {{is large}} and robust. The nasal bones are short, not {{extending}} further back than the lacrimals, and the premaxillaries extend <b>about</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> back as the nasals. The zygomatic plate is narrow and lacks a zygomatic notch, {{an extension of the}} plate at the front. The plate's back margin is level with the front of the first upper molar. The narrowest part of the interorbital region, located between the eyes, is to the front and its margins exhibit strong beading. Various crests develop on the long braincase, especially in old animals. The parietal bones form part of the roof of the braincase and, unlike in some other rice rats, also extend to the sides of the braincase.|$|E
5|$|The skull {{has a long}} rostrum (front part), broad interorbital region (between the eyes), and low braincase. It {{differs from}} that of T.bolivaris in various proportions, which are more {{apparent}} in adults than in juveniles. The skull of H.megacephalus is distinctly larger. The zygomatic plate is broad and includes a well-developed zygomatic notch at its front. Its back margin is level with the front of the first upper molar. The zygomatic arch (cheekbone) is heavy. The nasal and premaxillary bones extend <b>about</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> backward. The interorbital region is narrowest toward the front and shows weak beading at its margins; T.bolivaris is similar, but has stronger beading and H.megacephalus entirely lacks the beading. The parietal bone is usually limited to the roof of the braincase and does not extend to its side, as it does in most T.bolivaris. The interparietal bone, part of the roof of the braincase, is large.|$|E

5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is {{long and}} robust. The nasal bones are short, not {{extending}} further back than the lacrimals, and the premaxillaries extend <b>about</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> back as the nasals. The zygomatic notch, an extension {{at the front of}} the zygomatic plate, is present. The plate's back margin is level with the front of the first upper molar. A strong jugal bone is present in the zygomatic arch (cheekbone), so that the maxillary and squamosal bones, which form the front and back parts of the arch, respectively, do not overlap when seen from the side. The narrowest part of the interorbital region (located between the eyes) is to the front and the region's margins exhibit strong beading. Various crests develop on the rounded braincase, especially in old animals. The parietal bones form part of the roof of the braincase and, unlike in some other rice rats, also extend to the sides of the braincase. The interparietal bone at the back of the braincase is narrow and wedge-shaped, so that the parietal and occipital bones meet extensively.|$|E

25|$|Deinonychosaurs, {{named after}} the {{enlarged}} sickle-shaped second digit of the foot, {{are closely related to}} birds. They have two distinct families, Troodontidae and Dromaeosauridae. Troodontid fossils are known from 127 to 65Ma. They have a more slender build and longer limbs. The earliest named troodontid fossil known is Sinornithoides. Dromaeosaurid fossils are known from about 127 to 65Ma with the exception of Utahraptor. The skeletal remains of Utahraptor are about 127-144Ma. This is interesting because according to a recent cladistic analysis, Utahraptor is <b>about</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> from the ancestral Theropoda as it is possible to get, further than Archaeopteryx. Dromaeosaurids have a larger second digit; this family includes the well known dinosaurs Dromaeosaurus, Deinonychus and Velociraptor.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{some other}} places visited on Mars with landers (Viking and Pathfinder), {{nearly all the}} rocks near Phoenix are small. For <b>about</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> as the camera can see, the land is flat, but shaped into polygons between 2–3 meters in {{diameter}} and are bounded by troughs that are 20cm to 50cm deep. These shapes are due to ice in the soil expanding and contracting due to major temperature changes. The microscope showed that the soil {{on top of the}} polygons is composed of flat particles (probably a type of clay) and rounded particles. Also, unlike other places visited on Mars, the site has no ripples or dunes.O at the Phoenix Landing Site. 2009. Science:325. p58-61 Ice is present a few inches below the surface {{in the middle of the}} polygons, and along its edges, the ice is at least 8inches deep. When the ice is exposed to the Martian atmosphere it slowly sublimates. Some dust devils were observed.|$|E

500|$|Hal Hinson of The Washington Post was unimpressed {{with the}} film, calling it Jarmusch's [...] "least engaging, {{and the first}} in which his bohemian posturing {{actually}} becomes an irritant". Of the film's characters, critic Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader wrote that some were [...] "beautifully imagined and realized, while others seem drawn from a more familiar stockpile, designed for reuse rather than discovery". David Denby, concluding a mixed review of the film for New York Magazine, mused that [...] "one feels Jarmusch has pushed hipsterism and cool <b>about</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> as they can go, and that isn't nearly far enough." [...] This reproach was echoed by other reviewers who found that the film's style did not stray far {{from that of the}} director's earlier work – a critical backlash that would be amplified two years later following the release of Night On Earth (1991).|$|E
500|$|Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan (1998) uses {{hand-held}} camera, sound design, staging {{and increased}} audio-visual detail to defamiliarise viewers accustomed to conventional combat films, {{so as to}} create what film historian Stuart Bender calls [...] "reported realism", {{whether or not the}} portrayal is genuinely more realistic. Jeanine Basinger notes that critics experienced it as [...] "groundbreaking and anti-generic", with, in James Wolcott's words, a [...] "desire to bury the cornball, recruiting poster legend of John Wayne: to get it right this time"; and that combat films have always been [...] "grounded in the need to help an audience understand and accept war". Its success revived interest in World War II films. Others tried to portray the reality of the war, as in [...] Joseph Vilsmaier's Stalingrad (1993), which The New York Times said [...] "goes <b>about</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> as a movie can go in depicting modern warfare as a stomach-turning form of mass slaughter." ...|$|E

500|$|Rodriguez {{first came}} up with the idea for Planet Terror during the {{production}} of The Faculty: [...] "I remember telling Elijah Wood and Josh Hartnett, all these young actors, that zombie movies were dead and hadn't been around in a while, but that I thought they were going to come back in a big way because they’d been gone for so long. I said, 'We've got to be there first.' I had [...] I’d started writing. It was about 30 pages, and I said to them, 'There are characters for all of you to play.'

500|$|The South Drawing Room is at {{the front}} of the house on the West Wing. In earlier times the room had served as a dining room, despite it being <b>about</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> from the kitchen as possible. This section of the house was largely remodelled under Henry Holland, but it retains its Georgian elegance today, [...] "gilded to within an inch of its life", with walls painted in a duck egg blue colour with forest green drapery and peach-patterned sofas. A large mirror with an {{exquisite}} gold frame stands between the two windows. The fireplace was added by the Chelsea stonemason Lancelot Edward Wood in 1802, and the ceiling by master builder Benjamin Broadbent of Leicester in 1865. The ceiling in the Yellow Drawing Room, also known as the Rubens Room because of its four Rubens paintings, is also attributed to Broadbent. There are numerous paintings on the walls, including fifteen Joshua Reynolds portraits and a miniature portrait in one of the alcoves of Admiral Lord Nelson, an associate of George John, Second Earl Spencer. Although Higgerson, the night watchman, guarded the place from 8 pm to 8 am, in 1954 one of the lesser valuable paintings in the South Drawing Room was stolen in the night.|$|E
500|$|Garland {{began writing}} Dredd during {{post-production}} {{of his other}} writing credit Sunshine, and completed his first draft while serving as an executive producer during filming of 28 Weeks Later. Garland's draft revolved around one of Dredd's main enemies, the undead Judge Death. He described the story as a [...] "riff on the whole Judge system", but {{that it did not}} work because the Judge system had not yet been established and required too much knowledge about the Judge Dredd comic from the audience. He also considered the end result too surreal and extreme. From this script, Garland decided that the story needed to be more focused and grounded. He instead considered adapting some of the notable Judge Dredd storylines, including [...] "Democracy" [...] (1986) and [...] "Origins" [...] (2006). He decided to avoid these lengthy tales in favour of a shorter, day-in-the-life story about Dredd and his function as a cop in the dystopian environment of Mega-City One. When developing the Judge Dredd character, Garland tried to closely follow that of the comic-book character, who undergoes only small personality changes over a lengthy period of time. He said: [...] "I didn't think Dredd could have a great epiphany, but there is definitely a change in him {{over the course of the}} movie. He makes a very clear statement at the beginning of the film which he then contradicts at the end. That's <b>about</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> as the shift goes." [...] Garland intentionally gave the traditional character development to Anderson to compensate for Dredd's character stability.|$|E
