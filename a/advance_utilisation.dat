40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{addresses}} network architectures in {{a constellation}} of high altitude platforms (HAPs) with overlapping coverage areas, focusing on the additional network elements/functionalities required {{to make use of}} load balancing mechanisms. According to the location within the network and the complexity of additional equipment / functionality the paper proposes two different architectures. In the case of the basic utilisation of multiple HAPs a new equipment/functionality is installed only at the user premises, supporting load balancing only for the connections initialised from the HAP user network to the Internet (i. e. the outbound connections). In the case of <b>advanced</b> <b>utilisation</b> of multiple HAPs a new equipment/functionality is needed both at the user premises and in the HAP network, thus supporting load balancing in both directions. For the performance evaluation of load balancing mechanisms we built a simulation model supporting typical applications such as e-mail, file transfer, web browsing and IP telephony. Simulation results confirm {{that in the case of}} traffic load close to the congestion load balancing mechanism significantly improves the performance of selected reference applications. In order to asses the feasibility of the proposed network architectures in a multiple HAP system, and to confirm that carefully designed and pointed directional user antennas allow establishment of multiple access links for load balancing and to improve resilience of the network, we also investigate HAP visibility distribution across the coverage area for a single HAP system and a system comprising 4 HAPs.

Power generation using renewable energy gradually reduced carbon dioxide emission. Wind energy {{is one of the}} fast growing energy resources around the world. However, some assessments on the suitability of wind energy to be harnessed in Malaysia are needed before wind turbines can be established. In this research, a feasibility study of the utilisation of wind energy in Kudat has been conducted. Feasibility studies include the potential wind power site selection, wind speed prediction, wind turbine selection, economic and system assessment. A hybrid multi criteria decision making method with original values of the parameters has been introduced to identifl the suitable location for wind power plant. In recent years, Malaysia is moving towards sustainable energy growth by giving tax exemption and financial supports to green energy developers. The economic assessment on the Malaysian government's policies has been carried out by using system dynamics analysis. System dynamics can perform holistic analysis from the planning until establishment of the project and generate the desirable scenario by changing the values of parameters. Wind speed prediction is one of the criteria for future power planning. Wind speed prediction in Kudat in 2010 has been investigated among three methods, which are Mycs- 3, K-means clustering and Weibull analysis. Through the prediction of K-means clustering, the root mean square error is reduced 0. 5 % and more accurate if compared with Mycs- 3. Besides, the financial planning of the wind power project based on Green Technology Financial Scheme (GTFS) 2010 was successfully developed. By using Vestas 3 MW wind turbine as the study object, the return of investment is expected in between five to thirteen years. This is promising since the conventional power plant has typical ROI of ten years. In a nutshell, wind power plant is workable for the scenario in Malaysia...|$|R

It is imperative that senior managers, as change agents, have {{a good understanding of}} the psychological contract and how it influences employee behaviour and attitudes towards their job and their organisation. This paper explains the concept of psychological contract violation and presents the results of a survey of executive management personnel from the Australian Public Sector. The results of the survey revealed a negative relationship between psychological contract violation and both job satisfaction (r =-. 77) and organisational commitment (r =-. 67). Recommendations are given on how an organisation can minimise perceptions of violation through human resource strategies, policies and procedures that foster open communication and are reflective of distributive, procedural and interactional justice.

40|$|There is {{widespread}} implicit agreement {{within the field}} of psychotherapy about the therapeutic potential of mental imagery. A review of the literature indicates, however, a paucity of general theory. The literature on mental imagery is mainly concerned with its application i. e. procedures and techniques. Theorising, where it occurs, is usually informed by the specific psychological model espoused by the particular psychotherapeutic modality. In order to <b>advance</b> the <b>utilisation</b> of mental imagery as a therapeutic intervention, more attention needs to be paid to developing broader transtheoretical frameworks. In order to address this theory gap, research is required to identify common factors operating across all therapeutic schools with regard to the application of mental imagery. To this end a study was undertaken to inquire into potential category bases for developing generic typologies in mental imagery. A scoping exercise was undertaken of case studies of mental imagery in clinical practice published in academic journals in order to map out the field. A sample of suitable case vignettes drawn {{from a wide range of}} therapeutic approaches was selected. The imagery-related clinical material was abstracted and used as the data for a grounded theory style analysis. This analytic process disclosed one overarching category i. e. the therapeutic function of mental imagery and two core categories: 1. conveying information from the subconscious/wider mind-body system to the conscious mind, and 2. delivering directions from the conscious mind to the subconscious/wider mind-body system. These two categories were further differentiated into the following six specific functions: diagnostic; monitoring; processing; reparative; process management; and framing. It is proposed that this emerging functional typology of mental imagery has the potential to be the base of a coherent unifying transtheoretical model. These findings are discussed and critiqued in the light of the original unabridged data, and the researcher’s own clinical practice with mental imagery. The relevance and implications of these findings are considered with regard to the wider field of psychotherapeutic practice. Recommendations are made regarding the further testing out and refinement of this potential model of the therapeutic functionality of mental imagery.

40|$|The {{purpose was}} to study {{variations}} in utilisation rates of external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and brachytherapy (BT) for prostate cancer patients. We calculated the proportion and number of EBRT and BT given or planned within 6 months of diagnosis in 4 Dutch regions, according to stage and age in a population-based setting including 47, 259 prostate cancer patients diagnosed from 1997 until 2008. During this study period, the overall utilisation rate of EBRT remained stable at around 25 %, while the rate of BT for non-metastasized patients increased from 1 % (95 % CI: 0 - 1 %) to 12 % (11 - 13 %) in 2006 and slightly decreased towards 10 % (9 - 11 %) in 2008. From 2001 on, the overall utilisation rate of EBRT decreased significantly in one region (p < 0. 05). In this region, a sharp rise in the utilisation rate of BT for non-metastatic patients was noted to 17 % (14 - 20 %) in 2008 after a peak of 24 % (21 - 27 %) in 2006. For localised disease, BT was used more often {{at the expense of}} EBRT while for locally <b>advanced</b> disease the <b>utilisation</b> rate of EBRT increased. In the multivariate analysis, regional differences in the utilisation rate of EBRT persisted with odds ratios ranging from 0. 7 to 0. 9 compared to the reference region.

The utilisation rate of EBRT remained stable with limited variation between regions while BT was used increasingly with clear regional differences.

40|$|The {{collection}} of scales is common when fish communities are sampled within research and monitoring programmes in freshwater fisheries. Although used primarily to age individual fish, {{there is increasing}} evidence of their potential for application to other ecological methods, yet there is also considerable uncertainty in how this can be achieved. Thus, {{the purpose of this}} research was to examine how the use of scales within age and growth studies can be enhanced and investigate their application to freshwater trophic ecology, with a particular focus on <b>advancing</b> their <b>utilisation</b> within stable isotope analysis (SIA). The research used fishes of the Cyprinidae family as the focal species. Cyprinids are of substantial global, socio-economic importance as their communities are valued ecologically, commercially and recreationally. The research assessed current methodologies, highlighted extant gaps in knowledge and sought to resolve these issues. It covered work regarding the intrinsic error contained in estimating fish age from scales and improved scale application within SIA through the provision of key data that is currently lacking within the literature. An initial invasion ecology case-study provided new insights into the growth and trophic impacts of a model native and two non-native fishes under three distinct approaches of differing spatial scale and complexity. The results revealed a range of ecological consequences for the native species from the invaders, although the extent of these was also a function of spatial scale. Additionally, a number of procedural concerns relating to the {{collection of}} fish age data and current SIA methodologies were highlighted. The use of scales to derive estimates of the ages of fish is well established, with outputs used to address questions on aspects of fish and fisheries ecology, but the process remains prone to inherent errors. The research revealed that precision of growth estimates is significantly influenced by the sub-sampling regime applied. Where individuals are long-lived and slow-growing, sub-sampling strategies that result in few scales being analysed produced imprecise data and potentially erroneous outcomes. Additionally, uncertainty in the accuracy of ageing scales also potentially results from subjective interpretation of scale features. A statistical model was developed to incorporate this uncertainty into analyses, using Bayesian statistics and a bootstrapping methodology, to improve age and growth rate estimates. The model successfully produced error adjusted von Bertalanffy growth parameters. Food web and trophic analyses have traditionally been completed through stomach content analysis, but increasingly SIA is preferred, as it provides greater temporal perspectives and requires smaller sample sizes. In fish studies, dorsal muscle tissue is typically favoured, but this is often collected destructively. The research revealed that non-destructively collected tissues, such as scales, can act as a proxy for muscle and their isotopic values can be converted with minimal error when species-specific factors are used. When stable isotope data are applied to dietary studies, their use in statistical mixing models requires accurate step-wise enrichment values between diet and consumer (i. e. discrimination factors). There is considerable uncertainty in the variability of discrimination factors between species and the influence of their diet. Consequently, specific diet-tissue discrimination factors were produced for a range of cyprinid species and diet was shown to significantly affect diet-tissue discrimination. The application of species-specific values within mixing models can result in significant differences when compared with using standard values and consideration of the influence of diet needs to be made when investigating omnivorous species. The rate of turnover of carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes was also determined and variability between tissues was revealed, indicating that species- and tissue-specific half-lives should be considered when deciding upon experimental time-frames. In summary, the research has provided substantial information targeting extant knowledge gaps relating to the application of scales from cyprinid fishes to ecological studies. Regarding fish age and growth, issues surrounding accuracy and precision of estimates has been tackled, informing researchers of the influence on precision of applying sub-sampling regimes to subsequent growth analyses and providing an original statistical tool that can improve accuracy through producing growth parameters that better reflect inherent errors in fish age data. In contributing to the use of scales in SIA, novel data have been provided that will reduce the requirement for destructive sampling of fishes and enhance present understandings of the significance of species- and tissue-specific discrimination factors and turnover rates...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{essential}} physical skills attributed to a successful rugby league player is agility (5). Verstegen and Marcello (15) have suggested that agility is a quality that supports the ability to react to a stimulus, start quickly and efficiently, move in the correct direction, {{and be ready to}} change direction or stop quickly to make a play in a fast, smooth, efficient, and repeatable manner. Sheppard and Young (12) suggest that a more comprehensive definition of agility should include the physical demands (strength and conditioning), cognitive processes (motor learning) and technical skills (biomechanics) involved in these types of movements. They also propose that agility be defined as: a rapid whole body movement with change of velocity or direction in response to a stimulus. Sheppard and Young (12) identify two broad types of agility. These are: i) reactive agility, that includes physical and cognitive component that requires the athlete to react to some form of visual and or aural stimulus, and ii) change-of-direction speed (CODS), where the athlete negotiates a pre-planned movement requiring them to accelerate and decelerate while also changing direction. Reactive agility (RA) is the term used to distinguish between the traditional definition of agility and a more contemporary definition. With respect to rugby league some researchers have already attempted to develop a RA test specific to this sport (4, 5, 11). However, each of these differs slightly in some way with no gold standard method yet accepted within the literature. Further, one variable that is often neglected is the carrying of a ball. This may have an effect on such factors as acceleration, speed and agility performance due to arm movement restriction, resulting in less balance and reduced ground contact force (10). Previously, studies have been conducted in order {{to see if there is}} a quantifiable difference between 30 metre linear sprint times while in possession of a rugby ball and without (6, 17). In both these studies a slightly different research methodology was used but both still reported significantly slower times (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) between linear speed running with a ball and without. Importantly, these studies did not consider the effect of a two-handed ball carry on COD speed and RA times. Findings that suggest linear speed is slowed by the two-handed ball carry cannot be assumed to crossover to change-of-direction speed, as previous literature has shown the weak relationship between linear speed and COD performance (3). Another consideration when testing RA is the athlete’s ability to locate a target in a cluttered scene (visual search) or when looking for something when they are not sure where it is (14, 19). Clearly the ability to detect a visual stimulus early might be considered an important factor in superior sporting performance. Numerous studies have been completed in order to compare the differences between high level and low level performers in relation to their visual search qualities. Afonso et al. (2) studied visual search qualities of high-skilled and skilled volleyball players and found that the high-skilled players made a larger number of fixations of shorter duration to several locations in comparison to the skilled playing group. Similar results have been observed in cricket (7) and soccer (9). ‘Advance cue utilisation’ refers to a player’s ability to make accurate predictions based on information arising from an opponent’s posture and bodily orientation (18). The ability to anticipate an opponent’s actions based upon partial or advance sources of information is essential because of the time constraints placed on the performer, particularly in fast ball sports (1). One can assume that <b>advance</b> cue <b>utilisation</b> is crucial for rugby league since being able to anticipate an attacker’s movements, based on subtle body postural alterations, gives a defender a much greater chance of successfully getting into position to execute an effective tackle. In light of the above it appears that a closer examination of the impact of ball carriage and type of visual stimulus (i. e. sport specific or generic) on RAT performance is warranted. The aim of this research was to establish if a RA test, using two different forms of visual stimulus while running either without or with a rugby ball (two-handed carry) would negatively impacted upon RAT time (i. e. increased time over a given distance). A secondary aim was is to establish if a modified RAT specific to rugby league offensive play is a reliable test that could be used in this sport...|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) An {{increased}} demand worldwide for {{the reduction in}} pollutants emitted from coal-fired power stations has meant that <b>advanced</b> coal <b>utilisation</b> technologies are being sought as alternatives to pulverised fuel (pf) fired plants. The leading systems use coal gasification to produce a fuel gas which is cleaned and used in a combined-cycle gas turbine system. This produces electricity at high efficiencies and with significant reductions in the emissions of CO 2, N- and S- gases and particulates. These systems offer the emission levels approaching those of natural gas combined-cycle plants, with the low fuel cost of coal. Modern coal gasification technologies operate with high temperatures and at pressures many times that of pf boilers: the reliability and efficiency of gasification-based systems are strongly influenced by {{the performance of the}} coal used under these conditions. The high-intensity nature of these processes means that generating experimental coal performance data for coal assessment and reactor design is time consuming, expensive or even impossible {{due to the lack of}} suitable facilities. Using process models based on fundamental gasification phenomena, coal performance can be predicted over a range of conditions. This is beneficial for both the development of new gasification technologies and in the assessment of Australian coals for use in the evolving international market. The slowest stage of the coal gasification process, i. e. the conversion of the char, has been identified as an important parameter for the design and implementation of such models. In particular, the intrinsic reactivity—characterised by data measured under conditions where chemical processes alone control the reaction rates—is extremely important, as intrinsic data can be readily combined with char physical properties to predict the high-temperature reaction rates of coal chars. The lack of intrinsic data generated at pressures relevant to modern gasification systems has meant that kinetic input into process models has been somewhat unreliable. In particular, there are no high-pressure reactivity data—intrinsic or otherwise—available for Australian black coals. To address this need, work in this thesis has used a pressurised thermogravimetric analyser to measure the effects of pressure (up to 30 atm) on the intrinsic reactivities to O 2, CO 2 and H 2 O of several Australian black coal chars, at emperatures between 350 and 900 °C. These chars were made under a range of pressures and heating rates, and were in the size range 100 μm to 1. 0 mm. In particular, the experiments were performed under conditions where chemical processes alone controlled the reaction rates, and where inhibition of the respective reactions by the products was negligible. It was found (using chars made in bulk at atmospheric pressure with slow heating rates) that whilst the reaction rate increased with reactant pressure in all gases, at pressures above approximately 15 – 20 atm the rates of reaction with CO 2 and H 2 O ceased to increase with pressure. There was no such observation for the char–O 2 reaction up to 16 atm. Activation energies of the reactions were unaffected by pressure. Samples made at high pressures and with high heating rates were found to be orders of magnitude more reactive than the chars made at atmospheric pressure under slow heating rates. These differences were found to be largely due to an increased microporous surface area, such that the intrinsic reactivities (calculated using the CO 2 adsorption surface area) were similar. The effects of variations in pyrolysis pressure and parent coal petrography (and consequently char morphology) were also largely accounted for by char surface area, such that intrinsic rates were not greatly affected by these variables. These intrinsic reaction rate data were examined to produce a modified version of the nth order rate equation. This incorporated a pressure order that decreased as the reactant pressure increased, based on the physical process of available surface saturation. This model was compared with measured data and it was shown that the predictive capability of the nth order rate equation over a range of pressures was improved. There is scope for further refinement of this model by investigating the effects of reactant pressure on the development of the surface area of the char during conversion, since it was shown in this work that pressure has a strong effect on the such development. Moreover, this effect of pressure was not consistent between reactant and coal char type. This kinetic model was combined with measured char properties such as surface area, pore size, etc. to crudely predict the high temperature reactivity of a sample. This demonstrated the usefulness of reliable intrinsic data in the development of high temperature gasification models, and highlighted the need for experimental data obtained under process conditions of high temperature and pressure that can be used to validate such models...|$|R
40|$|As a {{cheap and}} {{abundant}} fuel, coal {{has been the}} single largest energy source for electricity generation (> 85 % in Victoria) in Australia. Such a situation will continue in the foreseeable future. However, irrespective of the utilisation process, coal conversion results in the emission of greenhouse gases (principally CO 2) {{and a variety of}} air pollutants including SOx,NOx and particulate matter. Burning low-rank lignite/brown coal is worse. The presence of abundant moisture in Victorian brown coal incurs a CO 2 emission rate of approximately 1. 2 - 1. 5 tonnes CO 2 -e/MWh sent out, relative to 0. 8 ~ 1. 1 for the high-rank bituminous coal. Ultra clean coal (UCC) is a coal-derived solid fuel with overall ash content in the order of 0. 1 wt %. It is supposed {{to be one of the}} promising solutions to achieve the near-zero emission utilisation of brown coal in the carbon-constraint future. As the mineral matter is removed significantly, UCC has the potential to burn directly in gas turbine combined cycle system and direct carbon fuel cell (DCFC), resulting in a net power generation efficiency of no less than 48 % and 60 %, respectively, on the higher heating value basis. Consequently, CO 2 emission mitigation by 25 – 35 % compared to conventional coal-fired power stations is plausible. With the removal of ash-forming metals, the requirement for post-combustion flue gas cleaning is also minimised and even eliminated. Its gasification-derived synthetic gas is more value-added, which can be used as a hydrogen source for high-efficiency electricity generation with zero-emissions and as a feedstock for the synthesis of value-added chemicals and liquid fuels. In summary, a successful use of UCC will significantly reduce the carbon footprint of brown coal industry and increase the quality and competitiveness of Victorian brown coal in national and international energy markets. The ultimate goal of this research is to discover a novel method to produce UCC from Victorian brown coal through the use of cheap/biodegradable reagents and mild leaching conditions for demineralisation. A variety of core technical/scientific issues underpinning the proposed novel upgrading process for Victorian brown coal have been investigated. A preliminary study on sulphur and mineral characterisation was carried out to provide better insight on their modes of occurrences in coal and selectively screen the suitable reagents for demineralisation. The chemical structures of individual ash-forming elements, their interactions with neighbouring inorganic elements and transformation upon demineralisation treatment and/or pyrolysis were extensively investigated, through an array of advanced instruments including synchrotron-based X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES), Computer-Controlled Scanning Electron Microscopy (CCSEM), X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), and Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES). Except for sodium and potassium, the modes of occurrence of major elements present in the coal are highly dependent on the coalification extent of the parent coal. For sodium and potassium in two of the brown coals tested, they are mainly water-soluble and organically bound. Their extraction from the coal is extremely rapid and easy. Potassium is also commonly found to have strong affinity with alumina-silicate compounds whose elution is more challenging and controlled by the intraparticle diffusion. The modes of occurrence of Ca, Mg, and Fe span from water soluble to crystallised oxides. The controlling-step of their extraction is consequently different. This study showed that for Ca and Mg in coal A, their activation energies were well above 40 kJ/mol, indicating the dominant control of surface reaction on the removal of water-soluble and organically bound Ca and Mg. Their extraction in coal B, however, was found to be a function of the surface reaction and intraparticle diffusion as their activation energies were reduced to approximately 20 kJ/mol. Al, Si, and Ti are more likely to be found in oxide forms, however, a considerable amount of chlorides, sulphate and ion-exchangeable Al, amorphous Si, and organo-Ti that are both water and weak acid soluble might also present in brown coal. Advanced synchrotron study on sulphur characterisation showed the prevalence of heterocyclic thiophene and sulphidic sulphur in Victorian brown coal. Upon hydrothermal treatment with acids, the sulphidic sulphur was reduced, as a result from the fragmentation of the light aliphatic hydrocarbons hosting the sulphidic sulphur. Sulphur vaporisation as a result of pyrolysis was initiated from the volatilisation of the mono/poly-sulphidic sulphur at 400 oC which is then followed by the more thermally stable thiophene as the pyrolysis temperature increases. Increasing the pyrolysis temperature to 800 oC favoured the sulphation of these volatilised sulphurs by the acid-soluble metals forming acid-soluble inorganic sulphate in the raw coal char. A prior acid washing of coal, on the other hand, restrained the formation of the inorganic sulphate. Upon understanding the detailed structures of ash-forming elements in brown coal, the study proceeds to conclude the optimum and most efficient condition for acid leaching to produce the targeted UCC, by addressing the key parameters that greatly affect the demineralisation performance. In this PhD, the author has successfully concluded the optimum leaching condition for UCC generation by varying a number of key parameters including particle size (i. e. < 53 μm, 106 - 153 μm, 153 - 300 μm, and 300 - 600 μm), leaching temperature (i. e. room temperature to 200 oC), leaching time (1, 2, 5, 30 minutes and 1, 2 and 3 h) and an array of leaching reagents (1 M citric acid, 1 M pyroligneous acid, and 0. 1 M Na-EDTA + 1 M pyroligneous acid). Two Loy Yang coals, annotated A and B, were investigated throughout this research study. For Coal A, a room temperature washing with 1 M citric acid for 5 min was proven capable to produce a UCC with an overall ash content of as low as 0. 12 db-wt %, non-detectable Na and ~ 20 mg/kg of Ca, thus, meeting the requirement for a gas turbine fuel. Coal B, on the other hand, a coal particle size between 153 and 300 μm and leaching temperature of 120 °C were found to be the optimum conditions to achieve the maximum demineralisation extent in 5 min. Although the ash content in the resulting fuel is still beyond the criteria (0. 2 wt %) for gas turbine fuel, the CCSEM study showed that the minerals remaining in the UCC were smaller than 5 μm and Na in the coal was completely removed. Accordingly, the corrosion and erosion of gas turbine blades may not be of concern for this coal. Alternatively, it may be suitable for diesel engines requiring ash content up to 2 % for very fine soft ash such as clay. This study has presented breakthrough findings of the potential use of weak acids as a cheap, biodegradable leaching reagent for the UCC generation derived from brown coal, which is an answer to a more sustainable electricity generation. Finally, the UCC produced was tested in a low-temperature catalytic gasification process to essentially assess its potential as a gasification fuel. Gasification at 750 oC was found to be the optimum temperature for the steam gasification of Victorian chars to achieve high gasification rate and hydrogen-rich syngas. A complete drying and upgrading of wet brown coal was also integrated in the proposed gasification technology via mild pyrolysis prior to entering the gasifier. Prior pyrolysis of the produced UCC at 400 oC was proven ideal to achieve gasification at high rate (i. e. similar to or higher than the chars derived from their respective raw coals) while minimizing the evolution of undesirable by-product gases to low or trace level. Such mild pyrolysis temperature was also proven to avoid sulphation reaction of the volatilised sulphur while maintaining minimum energy requirement. Acid washing also works favourably in promoting the water gas shift reaction leading to higher H 2 /CO ratio. Mass balance calculation from raw material to end product (i. e. hydrogen-rich syngas) was performed to provide an insight into the amount of energy generated from coal gasification with and without acid treatment. The calculation was performed on the basis of 1 tonne raw coal. Energy generated was based on the amount of hydrogen gas produced. Mass balance was performed across acid treatment, filtration, pyrolysis (400 oC), and catalytic steam gasification (750 oC). It is important to note that for Victorian chars, the AA washed- 400 oC char produces comparable amount of hydrogen in the syngas as its counter raw- 400 oC char. A total energy of 13. 7 MJ generated from this fuel is similar to the energy produced from char without prior acid treatment. Increasing pyrolysis temperature to 800 oC showed similar if not less energy generated. This PhD has confirmed the great potential of ammonium acetate washed chars derived at 400 oC as gasification feedstock whose low ash-precursor minerals content relative to the corresponding raw chars, has put this fuel as an alternative high quality feedstock for <b>advance</b> electricity generation. <b>Utilisation</b> of this fuel in place of raw coals is highly expected to increase the electricity generation efficiency to greater than 48 % while maintaining high gasification rate, high hydrogen content syngas, and high energy generation...|$|R
