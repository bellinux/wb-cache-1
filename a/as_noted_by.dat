5|$|As most {{explicitly}} {{noted by}} the first quatrain, the poem was originally intended to be sung. Indeed, <b>as</b> <b>noted</b> <b>by</b> Stephen Medcalf, Emeritus professor at Sussex University, the text itself seems to imply melody and verse. However, due to the oral tradition of the time, the original melody of the song was not notated and {{over the course of}} time was forgotten.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>noted</b> <b>by</b> {{astrophysicist}} Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar in his 1995 {{commentary on}} Newton's Principia, this theorem remained largely unknown and undeveloped {{for over three}} centuries. Since 1997, the theorem has been studied by Donald Lynden-Bell and collaborators. Its first exact extension came in 2000 {{with the work of}} Mahomed and Vawda.|$|E

5|$|By the 1890s {{food was}} still very limited in variety, with few vegetables. Porridge was given for breakfast, usually too fluid or overly solid, and the general {{standard}} of the prison's food was quite low, particularly in 1897 and 1898. However, the quality soon improved, <b>as</b> <b>noted</b> <b>by</b> the 1898 Royal Commission, which recommended decreasing rations to reduce costs.|$|E
5|$|In modern Polish historiography the battle's {{outcome is}} seen as a victory, if a very costly one, for the Polish and Soviet troops. <b>As</b> <b>noted</b> <b>by</b> historians such as Wawer and Komorowski, despite the heavy casualties, the Polish–Soviet {{frontline}} was not seriously breached, and thus the German offensive was a failure.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the game}} was praised as a reinvention of the Guitar Hero series, the game did not sell as well as Activision expected; due to lowered forecasts, Activision let go of about half of FreeStyleGames' developers.

5|$|Though {{the gold}} coins were {{certainly}} the most valuable issue, followed by the silver one, the exact relationship between the three issues (gold, silver, and bronze) is not known. The supply of gold was closely controlled by the Aksumite state, <b>as</b> <b>noted</b> <b>by</b> Cosmas Indicopleustes, and other precious metals were undoubtedly also closely controlled, allowing the Aksumite state to ensure the usage of its currency.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>noted</b> <b>by</b> Arthur M. Greenhall:If {{there is}} fur {{on the skin}} of the host, the common vampire bat uses its canine and cheek teeth like a barber's blades to shave away the hairs. The bat's razor-sharp upper incisor teeth then make a 7mm wide and 8mm deep cut. The upper incisors lack enamel, which keeps them {{permanently}} razor sharp. Their teeth are so sharp, even handling their skulls in a museum can result in cuts.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>noted</b> <b>by</b> Copernicus himself, {{the notion}} that the Earth rotates is very old, dating at least to Philolaus (c. 450 BC), Heraclides Ponticus (c. 350 BC) and Ecphantus the Pythagorean. Roughly a century before Copernicus, the Christian scholar Nicholas of Cusa also {{proposed}} that the Earth rotates on its axis in his book, On Learned Ignorance (1440). Al-Sijzi also proposed that the Earth rotates on its axis. Empirical evidence for the Earth's rotation on its axis, using the phenomenon of comets, was given by Tusi (1201–1274) and Ali Qushji (1403–1474).|$|E

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>noted</b> <b>by</b> Pavel Alexandrov and Hermann Weyl {{in their}} obituaries, Noether's {{contributions}} to topology illustrate her generosity with ideas and how her insights could transform entire fields of mathematics. In topology, mathematicians study {{the properties of}} objects that remain invariant even under deformation, properties such as their connectedness. A common joke is that a topologist cannot distinguish a donut from a coffee mug, since they can be continuously deformed into one another.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>noted</b> <b>by</b> a {{historical}} marker {{on the large}} hill in Central Campus, the site occupied by the school's first buildings once held fortifications built to protect Atlanta during the Atlanta Campaign of the American Civil War. The surrender of the city {{took place on the}} southwestern boundary of the modern Georgia Tech campus in 1864. The next twenty years were a time of rapid industrial expansion; during this period, Georgia's manufacturing capital, railroad track mileage, and property values would each increase by a factor of three to four.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>noted</b> <b>by</b> several {{critics and}} commentators, the film's story and style mirror {{elements}} from Gaston Leroux's The Phantom of the Opera. V and the Phantom both wear masks {{to hide their}} disfigurements, control others through the leverage of their imaginations, have tragic pasts, and are motivated by revenge. V and Evey's relationship also parallels many of the romantic elements of The Phantom of the Opera, where the masked Phantom takes Christine Daaé to his subterranean lair to re-educate her.|$|E

5|$|As the Polish troops {{entered the}} city, the first pogrom in modern Vilnius started, <b>as</b> <b>noted</b> <b>by</b> the Timothy D. Snyder, citing Michał Pius Römer. Dozens of people {{connected}} with the Lit-Bel were arrested, and some were executed; Norman Davies cites a death toll for all – Jews and non-Jews, under Polish rule – as 65. Jews constituted close to one-half of Vilnius's population, according to the German census of 1916, and many victims of fighting and subsequent repression in Vilnius were Jews. Henry Morgenthau, Sr. counted 65, Joseph W. Bendersky counted over a hundred.|$|E
5|$|Blöndal & Benedikz (2007) {{note that}} most of the Greece runestones are from Uppland and relate it {{to the fact that it}} was the most common area to start a journey to Greece, and the area from which most Rus' originated. However, <b>as</b> <b>noted</b> <b>by</b> Jansson (1987), the fact {{that most of}} these runestones were raised in Uppland and Södermanland does not {{necessarily}} mean that their number reflects the composition of the Scandinavians in the Varangian Guard. These two provinces are those that have the greatest concentrations of runic inscriptions.|$|E
5|$|Following Drygas' movie, Ryszard Siwiec was posthumously {{awarded a}} number of Czech, Slovak and Polish state decorations. Memorial plaques {{dedicated}} to his memory exist in Warsaw, Dębica and Przemyśl.

A street in Warsaw was named for him in 2011. Nonetheless, <b>as</b> <b>noted</b> <b>by</b> Kavaliauskas in 2010, he still is less known than other self-immolators of his time.|$|E

5|$|Paul Taylor’s {{review in}} The Independent hails American Idiot as “the Hair of its generation”. Yet, <b>as</b> <b>noted</b> <b>by</b> Harry Lou in The Indianapolis Business Journal, “ts female {{characters}} are sketched even {{lighter than the}} main men are”. Although intended to empower the disillusioned youth of early 21st century America, American Idiot excludes the female voice from this discourse. This disempowering of the female {{is evident in the}} fact that the female leads are denied identity, let alone agency. Just one of the three is given a name, and all represent a stereotypical form of ‘woman’; the mother, the artistic muse, and the object of the voyeuristic male gaze.|$|E
5|$|The auxilia were {{recruited}} from among the non-citizens. Organized in smaller units of roughly cohort strength, they were paid less than the legionaries, and after 25 years of service were rewarded with Roman citizenship, also extended to their sons. According to Tacitus there were roughly as many auxiliaries as there were legionaries. The auxilia thus amounted to around 125,000 men, implying approximately 250 auxiliary regiments. The Roman cavalry of the earliest Empire were primarily from Celtic, Hispanic or Germanic areas. Several aspects of training and equipment, such as the four-horned saddle, derived from the Celts, <b>as</b> <b>noted</b> <b>by</b> Arrian and indicated by archaeology.|$|E
