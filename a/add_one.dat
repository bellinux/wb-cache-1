5|$|Some brewers <b>add</b> <b>one</b> or more {{clarifying}} {{agents to}} beer, which typically precipitate (collect as a solid) {{out of the}} beer along with protein solids and are found only in trace amounts in the finished product. This process makes the beer appear bright and clean, rather than the cloudy appearance of ethnic and older styles of beer such as wheat beers.|$|E
5|$|There {{are plans}} to <b>add</b> <b>one</b> lane in each direction, {{as well as}} two {{reversible}} lanes, from I-15 to SR125. These plans were put on hold in 2008 due to a budget shortfall. Completion is scheduled to take place by 2040. Caltrans recommends adding two more lanes between I-5 and I-805, and two HOV lanes between I-805 and I-15.|$|E

5|$|As {{with each}} All-Star Game since 1970, the eight {{starting}} position players (with no designated hitter due to playing in an NL stadium) of each league were elected by fan balloting. The remaining players were selected by a players' vote, each league's team manager, {{and a second}} fan balloting to <b>add</b> <b>one</b> more player to each roster. In all, 32players were selected to each league's team, not including players who decline to play due to injuries or personal reasons.|$|E
5|$|During the 1990s, the Department of Transportation {{looked into}} the {{expansion}} of NY347 and NY454. The studies suggested that the state would <b>add</b> <b>one</b> additional traffic lane in each direction, giving most of the highway six lanes with eight travel lanes along the concurrency in Hauppauge. The new lanes would also be capable of holding rapid-commute vehicles for the Long Island Rapid Commute. The interchange where Routes 347 and 454 fork in Hauppague is slated to go from an at-grade fork to a grade-separated interchange. The project, which will cost $359 million (2009 USD) {{was scheduled to be}} completed between 2012 and 2015.|$|E
5|$|Missouri quarterback Chase Daniel was 23 for 44 with 248yards and no touchdowns, {{but he did}} throw three interceptions. Daniel rushed 20times for 75yards and a TD {{while the}} rest of the Tiger's offense was only able to <b>add</b> <b>one</b> rushing yard on seven carries. The Sooners' QB Paul Thompson went 11 for 19 with two touchdowns and no interceptions. He also ran for 28yards and a score while Allen Patrick added 162yards on 36carries. Meanwhile Malcolm Kelly became the fastest player in Oklahoma history to reach 1,000career {{receiving}} yards, after only his 19th game.|$|E

5|$|The Karlovac Operational Zone did not {{assist the}} 137th Infantry Brigade, instead {{directing}} subordinated units to lift JNA sieges of Slunj and Saborsko and securing the Karlovac–Slunj road. This prompted Katušin to request help from Zagreb Operational Zone commander Colonel Stjepan Mateša. Mateša, {{a native of}} Duga Resa, ordered the 7th Brigade of the Croatian TO to deploy a battalion to Karlovac. Although the General Staff approved the order (instructing the 8th Brigade of the Croatian TO to <b>add</b> <b>one</b> of its battalions), no 8th Brigade troops were sent.|$|E
5|$|Between levels, the Kid {{visits the}} Bastion, where the player can use fragments—the game's form of currency—that they have accrued to buy {{materials}} and upgrade weapons. With each core the player collects, they can <b>add</b> <b>one</b> of six structures to the Bastion, {{such as a}} shrine, an armory, or a distillery, and each shard allows the player to expand a structure. Each structure serves a different purpose; for example, the distillery lets the player select upgrades, and the shrine allows the player to choose idols of the gods to invoke, causing the enemies to become stronger and giving the player increased experience points and currency. Experience points are {{used to determine the}} Kid's ability level; higher values give the player more health and increase the number of upgrades they can select.|$|E
5|$|The primary freeway {{running through}} Lewisville is Interstate 35E, which runs north–south through the city. Before it was built, US Highway 77 (now Mill Street) {{was the main}} through route, {{connecting}} the city with Denton {{to the north and}} Dallas to the south. In 1998, the Texas Department of Transportation carried out a Major Investment Study to examine the possibility of expanding the section of Interstate 35E between Interstate 635 and U.S. Route 380, the primary focus being an stretch from Texas State Highway 121 to the bridge crossing Lewisville Lake. The project is scheduled to <b>add</b> <b>one</b> general-purpose lane in each direction, in addition to a managed toll lane. The project is expected to allow the city to substantially renovate its portion of the I-35 Corridor. Construction on {{the first phase of the}} project is projected to begin in summer 2013 and finish in late 2016.|$|E

5|$|As {{shown in}} the figure, and as {{originally}} described by , Rule 184 {{may be used to}} model deposition of particles onto a surface. In this model, one has a set of particles that occupy a subset of the positions in a square lattice oriented diagonally (the darker particles in the figure). If a particle is present at some position of the lattice, the lattice positions below and to the right, and below and {{to the left of the}} particle must also be filled, so the filled part of the lattice extends infinitely downward to the left and right. The boundary between filled and unfilled positions (the thin black line in the figure) is interpreted as modeling a surface, onto which more particles may be deposited. At each time step, the surface grows by the deposition of new particles in each local minimum of the surface; that is, at each position where it is possible to <b>add</b> <b>one</b> new particle that has existing particles below it on both sides (the lighter particles in the figure).|$|E

25|$|Insertions <b>add</b> <b>one</b> or more extra {{nucleotides}} {{into the}} DNA. They are usually caused by transposable elements, or errors during replication of repeating elements. Insertions in the coding region {{of a gene}} may alter splicing of the mRNA (splice site mutation), or cause {{a shift in the}} reading frame (frameshift), both of which can significantly alter the gene product. Insertions can be reversed by excision of the transposable element.|$|E
