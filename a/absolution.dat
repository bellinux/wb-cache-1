5|$|His {{break from}} writing lasted for five years, {{following}} the death of his wife, but after battling his illness he returned to print in 2000 with a new novel, Day of <b>Absolution.</b> Gardner also began a series of books with a new character, Suzie Mountford, a 1930s police detective.|$|E
5|$|Although central Leeds has few {{buildings}} {{from the}} Middle Ages, there are examples within the City of Leeds boundaries, including two at Wetherby. Wetherby Bridge {{dates from the}} Medieval period, but has been considerably altered, the pointed Gothic arches of different heights being replaced by semi-circular arches. It is said that the Bishop of York granted <b>absolution</b> of sins to local residents in return for building the bridge.|$|E
5|$|As {{bishop of}} Turin, Claudius {{found that men}} were often {{directed}} to go on pilgrimage to Rome for penance and that worshippers were accustomed to venerate Christ and the saints by bowing before images and relics. Claudius, coming from an educated background, was not greatly exposed to such provincial modes of worship. He made attacks {{on the use of}} images, relics, and crosses, he opposed pilgrimages to obtain <b>absolution,</b> and he had little regard for the authority of the pope due to his belief that all bishops were equal.|$|E
50|$|On {{completion}} of his Ph.D. Hughes {{worked as a}} food industry technical manager before forming his own company, <b>AbSolutions</b> Food Safety in 2001. <b>AbSolutions</b> Food Safety services ranged from consultancy to training, HACCP system development, cleaning chemicals, calibration to premises design. Hughes created food safety systems for hundreds of Irish companies including Jacob Fruitfield and has worked as an independently contracted trainer for the Food Safety Authority of Ireland. He retired from food safety in 2009.|$|R
50|$|All added that, as {{with any}} Roman Catholic, any transgressions of the Roman Catholic faith were fully confessed to a priest or bishop, penances made, and <b>absolutions</b> granted.|$|R

5|$|Before Becket {{returned}} to England, on 1 December 1170, he excommunicated Roger, {{as well as}} Gilbert Foliot the Bishop of Lincoln and Josceline de Bohon the Bishop of Salisbury. After Becket landed in England the three excommunicates went to Becket and asked for <b>absolution,</b> but while Becket was willing to absolve Gilbert and Josceline, he insisted that only the pope could absolve an archbishop. Roger persuaded the others that they should stick together, and all three went to King Henry in Normandy, to secure the king's permission for their appeals to Rome.|$|E
5|$|In 1873 New Mexico Territory, {{an unnamed}} loner (Daniel Craig) awakens {{injured in the}} desert with no memory and with a strange metal object on his wrist. He wanders into the town of <b>Absolution,</b> where preacher Meacham treats his wound. Sheriff Taggart recognizes the {{stranger}} as wanted outlaw Jake Lonergan and attempts to arrest him. Jake beats up the posse sent to take him in and nearly escapes, but a woman named Ella Swenson (Olivia Wilde) knocks him out. Taggart prepares to transport both Jake and volatile drunk Percy Dolarhyde to Santa Fe for trial.|$|E
5|$|On 17 September 1595 Clement VIII had {{accepted}} the decision of Henry IV of France to convert to the Catholic Church, which Henry had previously made to secure the French monarchy, and presided over a ceremony of papal <b>absolution.</b> This removed the excommunication order placed on him by Sixtus V. The Spanish faction had previously opposed the pope taking these actions, but the French negotiators had talked {{of the possibility of}} schism, which along with Henry's victories in the French Wars of Religion, overcame their opposition.|$|E
6000|$|But {{above all}} I disliked {{that most of}} them (the Independents) made the [...] people by {{majority}} of votes to be Church governors in [...] excommunications, <b>absolutions,</b> &c., which Christ hath made an act of [...] office; and so they governed their governors and themselves.|$|R
6000|$|Manuel, {{faithful}} {{son of the}} Church, appropriated all {{the blessings}} showered on her for her charity. [...] "That letta me out," [...] said he.

5000|$|The {{itinerant}} Joachimite preachers {{and many}} radical Franciscans, the Spirituals, supported Frederick. Against the interdict pronounced on his lands, the preachers condemned the Pope {{and continued to}} minister the sacraments and grant <b>absolutions.</b> Brother Arnold in Swabia proclaimed the Second Coming for 1260, at which time Frederick would then confiscate the riches of Rome and distribute them among the poor, the [...] "only true Christians".|$|R
5|$|Shortly after Richard {{took the}} throne he sought <b>absolution</b> for his sins in rebelling against his father, from Baldwin of Forde and Coutances. The two archbishops absolved Richard in a {{ceremony}} in Sees. Coutances also invested Richard as Duke of Normandy {{in a ceremony}} held in Rouen, before accompanying Richard to England, where he participated in the new king's coronation, on 3 September 1189.|$|E
5|$|According {{to church}} doctrine, the sacraments {{of the church}} require the proper form, matter, and intent to be validly {{celebrate}}d. In addition, the Canon Laws for both the Latin Church and the Eastern Catholic Churches govern who may licitly celebrate certain sacraments, as well as strict rules about who may receive the sacraments. Notably, because the Church teaches that Christ {{is present in the}} Eucharist, those who are conscious of being in a state of mortal sin are forbidden to receive the sacrament until they have received <b>absolution</b> through the sacrament of Reconciliation (Penance). Catholics are normally obliged to abstain from eating {{for at least an hour}} before receiving the sacrament. Non-Catholics such are ordinarily prohibited from receiving the Eucharist as well.|$|E
5|$|Baldwin {{was with}} King Henry {{shortly before the}} latter's death, taking part in {{unsuccessful}} efforts to negotiate a truce with Henry's heir, Prince Richard, who had rebelled against his father. After Henry's death, Richard sought and obtained <b>absolution</b> for the sin of disobedience to his father from both Baldwin and Walter de Coutances, Archbishop of Rouen. Baldwin, along with Coutances, was with Richard on 20 July 1189 at Rouen when the king was invested with the Duchy of Normandy. Baldwin crowned Richard at Westminster Abbey on 13 September 1189 in the first English coronation for which a detailed description survives.|$|E
50|$|As {{the town}} of Kalibo grew in {{importance}} {{it has become the}} hub where people gathered for important celebrations and where other municipalities pay their tribute money or taxes. Every Sunday people faithfully attended mass in Kalibo since the priests make church attendance compulsory especially during fiestas and other religious holidays. Fearing hell and the ire of the church authorities, the people were docile followers of the priests and hence, they found it necessary to hear mass and made confessions for the <b>absolutions</b> of their sins.|$|R
60|$|For himself, {{he would}} have died a {{thousand}} times rather than renounce his faith; but he told himself that Thekla was but a child, that women cared little for dogmas, {{and that she would}} learn to pray as sincerely in a Catholic as in a Protestant church, without troubling her mind as to whether there were gross abuses in the government of the church, in the sale of <b>absolutions,</b> or errors in abstruse doctrines. But to Thekla it had seemed impossible that she could become a Catholic.|$|R
50|$|Three tribunals {{exercise}} judicial power. The Roman Rota handles normal judicial appeals, {{the most}} numerous being those that concern alleged nullity of marriage. The Apostolic Signatura is the supreme appellate and administrative court concerning decisions {{even of the}} Roman Rota and administrative decisions of ecclesiastical superiors (bishops and superiors of religious institutes), such as closing a parish or removing someone from office. It also oversees the work of other ecclesiastical tribunals at all levels. The Apostolic Penitentiary deals not with external judgments or decrees, but with matters of conscience, granting <b>absolutions</b> from censures, dispensations, commutations, validations, condonations, and other favors; it also grants indulgences.|$|R
5|$|Neville {{supported}} the king during the Becket controversy between {{the king and}} Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury and was excommunicated by the archbishop twice. One excommunication occurred when Neville imprisoned one of Becket's chaplains, William of Salisbury, for six months in Corfe Castle in connection with Becket's actions against the king. Neville was absolved from this excommunication by Gilbert Foliot, the Bishop of London, after Neville decided to go on crusade. Becket was angered by the bishop's action, even though Foliot made the <b>absolution</b> contingent on Neville getting a penance from the pope {{on his way to}} the Holy Land.|$|E
5|$|Stephen found {{fault with}} Symeon {{especially}} for his charismatic approach, and {{his support of}} individual direct experience of God's grace. Symeon believed that direct experience gave monks the authority to preach and give <b>absolution</b> of sins, {{without the need for}} formal ordination—as practiced by his own teacher, Symeon the Studite. Church authorities also taught from a speculative and philosophical perspective, while Symeon taught from his own direct mystical experience. Symeon's teachings, especially those regarding the direct experience of God's grace, brought accusations of heresy from Stephen. Symeon responded to Stephen's charges by declaring that the real heresy was to teach {{that it is impossible to}} have direct experience of God (Disc. 29.4).|$|E
5|$|Catherine {{proved to}} be a zealous convert. She {{initiated}} and financed from her dowry the construction of churches throughout Bosnia, starting with one in Kupres in 1447, followed by churches in Krupa na Vrbasu and Jezero; a church in Jajce was built in 1458. In December 1458 she wrote to Pope Pius II to request that the church in Jajce, built along with a Franciscan monastery and a vicariate, be named after her namesake, Saint Catherine of Alexandria. Pius conceded her request in a bull issued on 13 December, granting <b>absolution</b> to anyone who visited Queen Catherine's church at Christmas or Easter, or on certain feast days. Another church built by Queen Catherine in Jajce and dedicated to Saint Catherine was a simple royal chapel. The churches built in Vrbanja, Vranduk, Tešanj and Vrila are attributed to both Catherine and her husband.|$|E
5|$|John was incensed {{about what}} he {{perceived}} as an abrogation of his customary right as monarch to influence the election. He complained both about the choice of Langton as an individual, as John felt he was overly influenced by the Capetian court in Paris, and about the process as a whole. He barred Langton from entering England and seized the lands of the archbishopric and other papal possessions. Innocent set a commission in place {{to try to convince}} John to change his mind, but to no avail. Innocent then placed an interdict on England in March 1208, prohibiting clergy from conducting religious services, with the exception of baptisms for the young, and confessions and <b>absolutions</b> for the dying.|$|R
50|$|A prefect apostolic is {{of lower}} rank than a vicar apostolic. The prefect's powers are more limited {{and do not}} {{normally}} possess the episcopal character, as is ordinarily the case with a vicar apostolic. The duties of a prefect apostolic consist in directing {{the work of the}} mission entrusted to his care; his powers are in general those necessarily connected with the ordinary administration of such an office, for instance: the assigning of missionaries and the making of regulations for the good management of the affairs of the mission. Until the Second Vatican Council, the prefect apostolic had extraordinary faculties for several cases reserved otherwise to diocesan bishops, such as <b>absolutions</b> from censures, dispensations from matrimonial impediments and the faculty of consecrating chalices, patens, and portable altars, with some having the power to administer Confirmation.|$|R
50|$|The Holy See {{does not}} {{dissolve}} upon a Pope's death or resignation. It instead operates {{under a different}} set of laws sede vacante. During this interregnum, the heads of the dicasteries of the Roman Curia (such as the prefects of congregations) cease immediately to hold office, the only exceptions being the Major Penitentiary, who continues his important role regarding <b>absolutions</b> and dispensations, and the Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church, who administers the temporalities (i.e., properties and finances) of the See of St. Peter during this period. The government of the See, and therefore of the Catholic Church, then falls to the College of Cardinals. Canon law prohibits the College and the Camerlengo from introducing any innovations or novelties in the government of the Church during this period.|$|R
5|$|Faced with a {{shortage}} of both funds and men, the Senate decided to send an embassy to Julius in order to negotiate a settlement. The terms insisted on by the Pope were harsh: the Republic lost her traditional power to appoint clergy in her territory, {{as well as all}} jurisdiction over Papal subjects in Venice, the Romagnan cities that had prompted the war were to be returned to Julius, and reparations were to be paid to cover his expenses in capturing them. The Senate argued over the terms for two months, but finally accepted them on February 24, 1510. Even before the Venetian ambassadors had presented themselves to Julius for <b>absolution,</b> however, the Council of Ten had privately resolved that the terms had been accepted under duress and were therefore invalid, and that Venice should violate them at the earliest opportunity.|$|E
5|$|Gaveston's {{body was}} simply left behind {{at the site}} of his execution. One chronicle tells of how four shoemakers brought it to Warwick, who refused to accept it, and ordered them to take it back outside his jurisdiction. Eventually, a group of Dominican friars brought it to Oxford. A proper burial could not be {{arranged}} while Gaveston was still excommunicate, and it was not until 2 January 1315, after the King had secured a papal <b>absolution</b> for his favourite, that he could have his body buried in an elaborate ceremony at the Dominican foundation of King's Langley Priory; the tomb is now lost. In 1823, a cross with inscription was erected at Blacklow Hill by local squire, Bertie Greathead, at the place believed to be the location of Gaveston's execution.|$|E
5|$|In 1319, the King and Lancaster {{fell out}} during a failed {{campaign}} against Scotland. The next year Lancaster refused {{to attend a}} parliament summoned by the King, and later the same year, Edward obtained papal <b>absolution</b> from his oath to follow the Ordinances. Meanwhile, an inheritance dispute had broken out in the Welsh Marches between the Despensers and certain marcher lords, including Humphrey de Bohun, Earl of Hereford. Lancaster now took the initiative with the discontented. In 1321 he summoned two meetings of magnates, one at Lancaster's residence of Pontefract in March, and the other at Sherburn in June. The meetings consisted of northern and marcher lords, as well as Lancaster's own retainers, but little assistance was forthcoming from the northerners. The marcher rebellion, {{and the threat of}} civil war, forced the King to exile the younger Despenser, but the favourite was recalled within weeks.|$|E
2500|$|The {{complaints}} {{of the two}} main preaching orders of the period, the Dominicans and the Franciscans, against the moral corruption of the Church, to some extent echoed those of the heretical movements, but they were doctrinally conventional, and were enlisted by Pope Innocent III {{in the fight against}} heresy. As a result, many Franciscans and Dominicans became inquisitors. For example, Robert le Bougre, the [...] "Hammer of Heretics" [...] (Malleus Haereticorum), was a Dominican friar who became an inquisitor known for his cruelty and violence. Another example was the case of the province of Venice, which was handed to the Franciscan inquisitors, who quickly became notorious for their frauds against the Church, by enriching themselves with confiscated property from the heretics and the selling of <b>absolutions.</b> Because of their corruption, they were eventually forced by the Pope to suspend their activities in 1302.|$|R
50|$|Overall {{the public}} life of leading church members began to {{resemble}} the lives of princes rather than members of the clergy. This splendor and corruption {{at the head of}} the Church found its way to the lower ranks: when a bishop had to pay up to a year's income for gaining a benefice, he sought ways of raising this money from his new office. This was taken to extremes by the pardoners who sold <b>absolutions</b> for all kinds of sins to the poor. While pardoners were hated but needed to redeem one's soul, the friars who failed to follow the Church's moral commandments by failing their vows of chastity and poverty were despised. This sentiment strengthened movements calling for a return to absolute poverty, relinquishment of all personal and ecclesiastical belongings, and preaching as the Lord and his disciples had.|$|R
5000|$|For Catholics, it {{is typical}} {{in the year}} of seminary {{training}} that a man will be ordained to the diaconate, which Catholics since the Second Vatican Council sometimes call the [...] "transitional diaconate" [...] to distinguish men bound for priesthood from permanent deacons. They are licensed to preach sermons (under certain circumstances a permanent deacon may not receive faculties to preach), to perform baptisms, and to witness Catholic marriages, but to perform no other sacraments. They assist at the Eucharist or the Mass, but are not able to consecrate the bread and wine. Normally, after six months or more as a transitional deacon, a man will be ordained to the priesthood. Priests are able to preach, perform baptisms, confirm (with special dispensation from their ordinary), witness marriages, hear confessions and give <b>absolutions,</b> anoint the sick, and celebrate the Eucharist or the Mass.|$|R
5|$|In 1198, Pope Innocent III {{broached}} {{the subject of}} a new crusade through legates and encyclical letters. The stated intent of the crusade was to conquer Egypt, now the centre of Muslim power in the Levant. The crusader army that arrived at Venice in the summer of 1202 was somewhat smaller than had been anticipated, and there were not sufficient funds to pay the Venetians, whose fleet was hired by the crusaders to take them to Egypt. Venetian policy under the ageing and blind but still ambitious Doge Enrico Dandolo was potentially at variance with that of the Pope and the crusaders, because Venice was closely related commercially with Egypt. The crusaders accepted the suggestion that in lieu of payment they assist the Venetians in the capture of the (Christian) port of Zara in Dalmatia (vassal city of Venice, which had rebelled and placed itself under Hungary's protection in 1186). The city fell in November 1202 after a brief siege. Innocent tried to forbid this political attack on a Christian city, but was ignored. Reluctant to jeopardise his own agenda for the Crusade, he gave conditional <b>absolution</b> to the crusaders—not, however, to the Venetians.|$|E
5|$|The New Laws {{were finally}} {{repealed}} on October 20, 1545, and riots broke out against Las Casas, with shots being fired against him by angry colonists. After a year {{he had made}} himself so unpopular among the Spaniards of the area {{that he had to}} leave. Having been summoned to a meeting among the bishops of New Spain to be held in Mexico City on January 12, 1546, he left his diocese, never to return. At the meeting, probably after lengthy reflection, and realizing that the New Laws were lost in Mexico, Las Casas presented a moderated view on the problems of confession and restitution of property, Archbishop Juan de Zumárraga of Mexico and Bishop Julián Garcés of Puebla agreed completely with his new moderate stance, Bishop Vasco de Quiroga of Michoacán had minor reservations, and Bishops Francisco Marroquín of Guatemala and Juan Lopez de Zárate of Oaxaca did not object. This resulted in a new resolution to be presented to viceroy Mendoza. His last act as Bishop of Chiapas was writing a confesionario, a manual for the administration of the sacrament of confession in his diocese, still refusing <b>absolution</b> to unrepentant encomenderos. Las Casas appointed a vicar for his diocese and set out for Europe in December 1546, arriving in Lisbon in April 1547 and in Spain on November 1547.|$|E
5|$|This Bull was {{confirmed}} by Pope Alexander's successor Pope Lucius III. Jocelin had obtained this confirmation while at Rome in late 1181 and early 1182. He had been sent there by King William, along with abbots of Melrose, Dunfermline and Kelso and the prior of Inchcolm, in order {{to appeal to the}} Pope regarding his stance in a struggle over the Bishopric of St Andrews and the sentence of excommunication and interdict the Pope had placed over the king and kingdom. The dispute concerned the election to the bishopric of John the Scot, which had been opposed by the king, who organised the election of his own candidate, Hugh. The mission was successful. The Pope lifted the interdict, absolved the king and appointed two legates to investigate the issue of the St Andrews succession. The Pope even sent the king a Golden Rose, an item usually given to the Prefect of Rome. The issue of the succession, however, did not go away. In 1186, Jocelin, along with the abbots of Melrose, Dunfermline and Newbattle, excommunicated Hugh on the instructions of Pope Lucius. Hugh travelled to Rome in 1188, and obtained <b>absolution,</b> but he died of the pestilence in that city a few days later, thus allowing the issue to be resolved.|$|E

50|$|It {{is now the}} vestment {{assigned}} to the celebrant, whether priest or bishop, for almost all functions except the Mass when the celebrant wears the chasuble instead. The cope is used, for example, in processions, in the greater blessings and consecrations, at the solemnly celebrated Liturgy of the Hours, in giving Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament, and the celebration of other sacraments outside of Mass. For most of these the celebrant may instead wear simply cassock and surplice or alb, both with the stole, for simpler celebrations. The chasuble, which is properly only worn for Mass, may also be worn during processions and other ceremonies that occur directly before or after Mass, such as the <b>absolutions</b> and burial of the dead, at the Asperges before Mass, and at the blessing and imposition of the ashes on Ash Wednesday, to avoid {{the need for the}} celebrant to change vestments.|$|R
