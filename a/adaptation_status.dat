40|$|Purpose: To {{examine the}} {{association}} of psychosocial <b>adaptation</b> <b>status</b> with vision-specific health-related quality of life (HRQOL) {{and the role of}} psychosocial adaptation in the linkage between visual impairment and vision-specific HRQOL outcomes among older adults with visual disorders. Design and methods: In this cross-sectional study, older urban adults with visual problems (N = 167) were interviewed using a structured questionnaire to assess their self-reported visual function, general health, psychosocial <b>adaptation</b> <b>status,</b> and vision-specific HRQOL. Performance-based measure of visual function marked by distance visual acuity was clinically conducted by ophthalmologists. Results: It was found in the study that psychosocial <b>adaptation</b> <b>status</b> was significantly associated with vision-specific HRQOL, including the domains of mental health symptoms due to vision and dependency on others due to vision. The results also showed that psychosocial <b>adaptation</b> <b>status</b> could buffer the effect of visual impairment on vision-specific HRQOL, including the domains of social function, mental health, and dependency. Conclusion: Psychosocial <b>adaptation</b> <b>status</b> is significantly associated with multiple domains of vision-specific HRQOL. The findings have significant implications for health education and psychosocial intervention for older adults with age-related vision loss. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.

40|$|The job {{satisfaction}} of live-in foreign domestic helpers (FDHs) may influence their caring motivation {{and the quality}} of care they provide, which may in turn affect the health status of care recipients. This study identifies the factors affecting {{job satisfaction}} of FDHs caring for people with dementia in Hong Kong, focusing especially on the role of FDHs' <b>adaptation</b> <b>status,</b> job self-efficacy and care recipients' situation. A total of 152 FDHs taking care of people with dementia were recruited from 6 day care centres for elderly people in Hong Kong when they attended with their care recipients. Data were collected from February to August 2011 and the response rate was 95 %. Participants completed questionnaires which included measures of care recipients' dementia severity and disruptive behaviours, FDHs' demographic factors, personal <b>adaptation</b> <b>status,</b> caregiving self-efficacy and job satisfaction. Hierarchical regression analysis was conducted to analyse the data. The results showed that longer stay in Hong Kong, better fluency in Cantonese (local dialect), greater satisfaction in living conditions, higher caregiving self-efficacy and less disruptive behaviour of care recipients were independently associated with stronger job satisfaction in FDHs looking after people with dementia. On the basis of these findings, we would suggest that employers should consider helpers who have been in Hong Kong {{for a longer period of}} time and speak fluent Cantonese, and have previous experience of taking care of people with dementia. In addition, FDHs caring for people with dementia may benefit from carer training which improves their self-efficacy in dementia care. Department of Applied Social Science...|$|E

The evaluation of discomfort glare has been hotly debated in the past decades. This article presents two experiments, with three visual task involved, i. e. reaction time, detection threshold and discrimination threshold, to inspect Lin-Liu model’s predicting effect of discomfort glare pilots encountered during nighttime flying, and also to explore how the discomfort glare affect the visual performance of the pilots. The results were analysed using repeated-measures ANOVA. It was confirmed that glare has a significant influence on the pilots ’ visual performance: under harsh luminous condition, visual performance got worse significantly. The evaluation result using Lin-Liu model, which expresses the perceived discomfort glare by means of deBoer rating (RdeBoer), showed a regressive relationship between deBoer rating and visual performance, which indicated a good prediction capability of Lin-Liu model in the influence of discomfort glare.

In the short-run (current year) a one standard deviation increase in status and 52 percent of one standard deviation in income are associated with similar increases in happiness. However 65 percent of the current year's impact of income on happiness is lost over the following four years whereas the impact of status remains intact, if anything growing over time. We also present different estimates of adaptation across sub-groups. For example, we find that those on the right (left) {{of the political spectrum}} adapt to status (income) but not to income (status). We can reject equal relative adaptation (to income versus status) for these two sub-groups. Happiness Psychology Adaptation to income <b>Adaptation</b> to <b>status...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyze the job {{adjustment}} situation of middle-aged women who are (re-) entering the labor market after a long break of job career and may be experiencing conflicts in the process of their settlement in the new workplace. Most of previous studies about female labor market have focused on the causes and the impact of ‘career interruptions’ of female workers pointing out the social and personal problems caused by the withdrawal of married female workers due to burden of housekeeping and child-raising. However, another important issue except preventing such withdrawal of female workers is how to encourage the return or new entrance of middle-aged female workers who are out of the labor market for a while and to help them smoothly settling down in new working environments. In this respect, this study was conducted to gather basic information on workplace <b>adaptation</b> <b>status</b> of middle-aged (re-) employed women.

Even though mites can feed on many plant species, local mite populations form host races that do not perform equally well on all {{potential}} hosts. An acquisition {{of the ability to}} evade plant defenses is fundamental for mite’s ability to use a particular plant as a host. Thus, understanding the interactions between the plant and mites with different host <b>adaptation</b> <b>status</b> allows the identification of functional plant defenses and ways mites can evolve to avoid them. Results: The grapevine genome-wide transcriptional responses to spider mite strains that are non-adapted and adapted to grapevine as a host were examined. Comparative transcriptome analysis of grapevine responses to these mite strains identified the existence of weak responses induced by the feeding of the non-adapted strain. In contrast, strong but ineffective induced defenses were triggered upon feeding of the adapted strain. A comparative meta-analysis of Arabidopsis, tomato and grapevine responses to mite feeding identified a core of 36 highly conserved genes involved in the perception, regulation and metabolism that were commonly induced in all three species by mite herbivory. Conclusions: This study describes the genome-wide grapevine transcriptional responses to herbivory of mite strains that differ in their ability to use grapevine as a host.

40|$|Selective 2 -photon {{excitation}} (TPE) of carotenoid dark states, Car S 1, {{shows that}} in the major light-harvesting complex of photosystem II (LHCII), the extent of electronic interactions between carotenoid dark states (Car S 1) and chlorophyll (Chl) states, φCouplingCar S 1 −Chl, correlates linearly with chlorophyll fluorescence quenching under different experimental conditions. Simultaneously, a linear correlation between both Chl fluorescence quenching and φCouplingCar S 1 −Chl with the intensity of red-shifted bands in the Chl Qy and carotenoid absorption was also observed. These results suggest quenching excitonic Car S 1 −Chl states as origin for the observed effects. Furthermore, real time measurements of the light-dependent down- and up-regulation of the photosynthetic activity and φCouplingCar S 1 −Chl in wild-type and mutant (npq 1, npq 2, npq 4, lut 2 and WT+PsbS) Arabidopsis thaliana plants reveal that also in vivo the quenching parameter NPQ correlates always linearly with the extent of electronic Car S 1 –Chl interactions in any <b>adaptation</b> <b>status.</b> Our in vivo measurements with Arabidopsis variants show that during high light illumination, φCouplingCar S 1 −Chl depends {{on the presence of}} PsbS and zeaxanthin (Zea) in an almost identical way as NPQ.

40|$|Nematodes are key {{components}} of soil biodiversity and represent valuable bio-indicators of soil food webs. Numerous community indices have been developed in order to track variations in soil ecosystem processes, but their use is mainly restricted to anthropogenic stresses. In this study, we propose to expand the use of nematode' derived ecological indices in order {{to shed light on}} soil ecosystem functioning along elevation gradients. For this purpose, we aimed at determining how elevation affects the abundance, the composition and the functional diversity of nematode communities. To understand the underlying ecological parameters driving these patterns we studied both abiotic factors (soil properties) and biotic factors (trophic links, relationships with plant diversity). Our results indicate that (1) nematode abundance increases with elevation, from lowland forests to alpine meadows; (2) differences in nematodes communities rely on habitat-specific functional diversity (e. g. local <b>adaptations,</b> "colonizer/persister" <b>status)</b> while most trophic groups are ubiquitous; and (3) variations in the metabolic footprint of the complete nematode community suggest that their contribution to soil ecosystem processes generally increases with elevation. The resulting cascading effects on the soil food web structure are discussed from an ecosystem functioning perspective. Overall, this study is in line with the literature highlighting the importance of nematodes in soil ecosystems and brings insights in their enhanced role at high elevation...|$|R
40|$|It is {{a common}} {{practice}} to grow winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) as a dual-purpose crop in the U. S. Southern Great Plains to decrease production risk and to increase profit margin through cattle (Bos taurus) production. Crop management of the dual-purpose wheat is complex because of the tradeoffs between beef production and wheat grain yield. A wheat grazing model helps in making optimal decision. The objective {{of this study was}} to develop and incorporate a grazing and metabolizable energy-based cattle growth module into the Decision Support Systems for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) to simulate beef and wheat grain production. The wheat grazing model was comprised of wheat growth, wheat-cattle interaction, and cattle growth components. Wheat growth was simulated by the cropping system model (CSM) of DSSAT. For the wheat-cattle interface, removals of canopy biomass and leaf area by grazing were estimated daily. Predicted grain yield was also reduced by 50 kg ha- 1 per day for each day of grazing past the first hollow stem stage. Cattle growth rate was based on a metabolizable energy intake. Maximum voluntary daily intake was estimated based on stocker body weight and forage quality, and is further adjusted for actual forage availability, temperature, and <b>adaptation</b> <b>status</b> during the first two week of grazing to estimate the actual daily intake.

The purpose of this thesis was to determine not only what means of inquiry are available to do so but also how good they are or, more specifically, how promising they are {{with respect to the}} research goal of giving a scientifically respectable evolutionary explanation of consciousness. Because no suitable or easily adaptable evaluation system or set of evaluative criteria was available, I constructed a systematic tool for evaluating the promise of means of inquiry. The evaluation tool has three dimensions [...] relevance, efficacy, and practicality [...] with two criteria each, which are assessed independently (except for the relevance criteria) and synthesised into dimensional and promise scores. This tool served to evaluate, and advise on, 23 means of inquiry that have been used in the investigation of the evolution of consciousness, including its <b>adaptation</b> <b>status</b> and evolutionary functions. The core of the thesis is formed by the evaluation tool and its application. After establishing the need for an evaluation of means of inquiry in this area and presenting the evaluation tool constructed for this purpose, I apply the tool to arguments that consciousness is an evolutionary adaptation, to general reasoning strategies, and to evolutionary strategies. This thesis core is preceded by a contextual introduction to consciousness and evolutionary theory and by the dismissal of some sceptical positions. It is followed by a comparative review of the evaluation results and an evaluation of the evaluation tool. The main contributions of this research consist of the promise evaluation tool for means of inquiry, which is underpinned by a new evaluative theory and available for use by other researchers; and, through the tool's application, an improved understanding of means of inquiry and recommendations about which of them to use for the present research goal...|$|E

30|$|Evolutionary {{psychology}} assumes {{further that}} humans have evolved a rich repertoire of (social) psychological mechanisms {{to reap the}} benefits of group living, while mitigating its costs. Humans have evolved specific psychological <b>adaptations</b> to negotiate <b>status</b> hierarchies, overcome coordination challenges, form cooperative coalitions, solve group decision-making problems, and deal with members of out-groups (Van Vugt and Kameda, 2012). These adaptations are domain-specific and context-dependent. Differences between group cultures and structures emerge as the same psychological mechanisms respond adaptively to different environmental conditions. In situations where (food) resources are predictable, concentrated, and contestable, hierarchical relations likely emerge as some individuals can dominate the rest by monopolizing resources. In contrast, in situations in which (food) resources are variable, dispersed and can only be obtained through collective effort (e.g., hunting a large game), more egalitarian structures emerge (Pierce and White, 1999).|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The size of {{the pupil}} {{diameter}} and its continuous fluctuations {{under the influence of}} factors of various origin has an important impact on the quality of vision, as well as in performing a variety of ophthalmological procedures. This seems to be of even greater importance in the case of refractive surgery, through the influence that the specific parameter has in the higher order aberrations of the eye. Additionally, the use of antiulcerative agents, of the H 2 -antagonist type, is quite often in patients demonstrating ophthalmic pathology. PURPOSE: With the present study, an attempt was made, to investigate, through a procedure as reliable as possible, the possible influence of ranitidine hydrochloride in the diameter of the pupil of the eye, under controlled environment of photopic and scotopic adaptation, as well as the possible clinical benefit, in relation to complication avoidance, or undesired side effects, after the administration of the specific pharmacological substance. METHODS: The specific prospective clinical study was conducted in a total of 565 patients and visitors of a large, urban primary care unit. In 362 of these persons, ranitidine hydrochloride was per os administered, by another 58, diclofenac sodium was simultaneously, per os again, used, while a separate group of 38 selected patients received the antisecretive agent esomeprazole, instead of ranitidine hydrochloride. The remaining 45 candidates formed the control group, while 62 diabetic patients were regarded as a special group that also underwent examination, through exactly the same investigative protocol. In the persons that participated in the study, the diameter of the pupil of both eyes was measured, in an averaging manner, by the use of the Colvard infrared electronic corometer, in two separate phases, under and without the influence of the untiulcerative drug, each time under photopic and scotopic <b>adaptation</b> <b>status.</b> All the measurements took place in the same location, at approximately the same time of day and were carried out by the same examiner. The conditions of ambient lighting were each time strictly controlled, while the exact values of Illuminance, extremely close to the examined eye, were continuously confirmed through the use of an electronic digital photometering device. On the other hand, during protocol application, attempt was made so that all the remaining personal and environmental parameters, that could possibly influence the measurements, were properly controlled, equalized and/or simulated. Pupil diameter values in the various prearranged phases, were each time, in -the-field, recorded, while a variety of other measurement parameters, as well as candidate characteristics, were also recorded and evaluated. The gathering data underwent further elaboration through the use of specific software in a portable personal computer. RESULTS: The various groups of patients that were selected, were comparable with regard to their demographic, clinical and other features, during the measurement procedure. The administration of ranitidine hydrochloride made it possible to obtain a, statistically significant, larger pupillary diameter, in patients examined under its influence, in comparison with the same group, examined, free from the specific drug activity, especially under scotopic conditions (we recorded 4, 32 ± 0, 52 mm, under the influence, photopic against 3, 46 ± 0, 78 mm, without the influence, photopic where p= 0, 0251 and 6, 87 ± 0, 39 mm, under the influence, scotopic against 5, 51 ± 0, 43 mm, without the influence, scotopic where p= 0, 0247, respectively). A similar deviation was also registered in a due comparison with the findings in the relative control group, in which the average pupil diameter values of the first measurement were, in a statistically significant degree, smaller (more specifically, we recorded 3, 28 ± 0, 25 mm, 1 st measurement, photopic, control against 4, 32 ± 0, 52 mm, under the influence, photopic where p= 0, 0301 and 5, 27 ± 0, 54 mm, 1 st measurement, scotopic, control against 6, 87 ± 0, 39 mm, under the influence, scotopic where p= 0, 0196), than the corresponding such, under drug influence in the main group, with the relative difference being augmented under scotopic conditions, while, on the contrary, they just failed to reach statistical significance, when the two measurements within the control group itself, were evaluated (analytically, we recorded 3, 28 ± 0, 25 mm, 1 stmeasurement, photopic, control against 3, 23 ± 0, 29 mm, 2 nd measurement, photopic, control with p= 0, 439 and 5, 27 ± 0, 54 mm, 1 st measurement, scotopic, control against 5, 74 ± 0, 22 mm, 2 nd measurement, scotopic, control with p= 0, 0528), under both of the undertaken Illumination levels. A similarly comparable condition, with differences between the average values of pupillary diameter failing to reach statistical significance (p> 0, 05 for a CI of 95 %), also prevailed amongst the measurements, when patients were treated with esomeprazole instead of ranitidine (the corresponding average values were 3, 27 ± 0, 31 mm, under PPI influence, photopic against 3, 34 ± 0, 28 mm, without PPI influence, photopic with p= 0, 632 and 5, 23 ± 0, 59 mm, under PPI influence, scotopic against 5, 52 ± 0, 24 mm, without PPI influence, scotopic with p = 0, 198).

30|$|DCA {{can improve}} channel utilization. However, DCA might cause an adverse effect {{when it is}} applied to {{transmission}} control protocol (TCP) flows. TCP is a reliable, robust, and connection-oriented protocol for data delivery that is commonly used over the Internet because of its flexibility and <b>adaptation</b> to network <b>status</b> change. TCP adopts a congestion control algorithm for each flow. The algorithm defines a congestion window (CWND) {{which is used to}} indicate how many packets should be sent. By dynamically adjusting the CWND, TCP can well adapt to the network change. In the algorithm, the sender must wait for a number of segments that already had been sent, before it sets the CWND and carries on with the next set of segments. According to the receiving acknowledgement info, the sender can increase or decrease CWND. When DCA is applied, its first parameter σ hampers the adjustment of CWND. For example, if the network status is good, the CWND is limited by σ so that more packets cannot be sent; on the other hand, if the network status is bad, the parameter σ prevents the sender from transmitting fewer packets immediately.|$|R

Finally, a cultural difference emerged: Fijians viewed happy displays as more deserving of high status than did North Americans, both implicitly and explicitly. Together, these findings suggest that the display and recognition of pride may be part of a suite of <b>adaptations</b> for negotiating <b>status</b> relationships, but that the high-status message of pride is largely communicated through implicit cognitive processes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Microbial mats are prokaryotic {{communities}} that provide model systems to analyze microbial diversity and ecophysiological interactions. Community diversity of microbial mat samples was assessed at 8 : 00 a. m. and 3 : 00 p. m. in a combined analysis consisting of 16 S rRNA-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles. The divergence index determined from PLFA and DGGE {{data showed that}} depth-related differences have a greater influence on diversity than temporal variations. Shannon and Simpson indices yielded similar values in all samples, which sug-gested the stable maintenance of a structurally diverse microbial community. The increased diversity observed at 3 : 00 p. m. between 2. 5 and 4 mm can be explained mainly by diversification of anaerobic microorganisms, especially sulfate-reducing bacteria. In the afternoon sampling, the diversity index reflected a higher diversity between 4 and 5. 5 mm depth, which suggested {{an increase in the}} diversity of strict anaerobes and fermenters. The results are consis-tent with the conclusion that hypersaline microbial mats are characterized by high degree of diversity that shifts in re-sponse to the photobiological <b>adaptations</b> and metabolic <b>status</b> of the microbial community...|$|R
40|$|Foster {{care is a}} {{protective}} intervention designed to provide out of home placement to children living in at-risk home environments. This study employs prospective longitudinal data ~N 189 ! to investigate the effects of foster care {{on the development of}} child behavior and psychological functioning taking into account baseline adaptation prior to placement and socioeconomic status at the time of placement. Comparisons were made among three groups: children who experienced foster care, those who were maltreated but remained in the home, and children who had not experienced foster care or maltreatment despite their similarly at-risk demographic characteristics. In the current sample, children placed in out of home care exhibited significant behavior problems in comparison to children who received adequate care, and using the same pre- and postplacement measure of adaptation, foster care children showed elevated levels of behavior problems following release from care. Similarly, children placed into unfamiliar foster care showed higher levels of internalizing problems compared with children reared by maltreating caregivers, children in familiar care, and children who received adequate caregiving. Findings suggest that outcomes related to foster care may vary with type of care and beyond the effects associated with maltreatment history, baseline <b>adaptation,</b> and socioeconomic <b>status.</b> The foster care social service system is de...|$|R
40|$|Valid and {{reliable}} assessment of pain is fundamental for both clinical trials and effective pain management. The nature of pain makes objective measurement impossible. Chronic musculoskeletal pain assessment {{and its impact}} on physical, emotional and social functions require multidimensional qualitative tools and healthrelated quality of life instruments. The recommendations concerning outcome measurements for pain trials are useful for making routine assessments that should include an evaluation of pain, fatigue, disturbed sleep, physical functioning, emotional functioning, patient global ratings of satisfaction, and quality of life. Despite the growing availability of instruments and theoretical publications related to measuring the various aspects of chronic pain, there is still little agreement and no unified approach has been devised. There is, therefore, still a considerable need {{for the development of a}} core set of measurement tools and response criteria, as well as for the development and refinement of the related instruments, standardized assessor training, the cross-cultural <b>adaptation</b> of health <b>status</b> questionnaires, electronic data capture, and the introduction of valid, reliable and responsive standardized quantitative measurement procedures into routine clinical care. This article reviews a selection of the instruments used to assess chronic musculoskeletal pain, including validated newly developed and well-established screening instruments, and discusses their advantages and limitations...|$|R

While the latter register focuses more on nation-state politics, there is a further transnational dimension in the Muslim experience in Europe, and this assumes an important trajectory in the ways discussed. It is argued that Muslim identities in Europe contain many social layers that are often independent of scriptural texts; such that the appellation of “Muslim” can be appropriated without any unanimity on Islamic matters. We conclude by observing how this point is understudied, and as a consequence the dynamic features of Muslims’ leadership in Europe remain unexplored. ...|$|R
50|$|There are two {{theories}} {{on the role}} of testosterone in aggression and competition among males. The first one is the Challenge hypothesis which states that testosterone would increase during puberty thus facilitating reproductive and competitive behaviour which would include aggression as a result of evolution. Thus it is the challenge of competition in relation to testosterone among males of the species that facilitates aggression and violence. Studies conducted have found direct correlation between testosterone and dominance especially among the most violent criminals in prison who had the highest testosterone levels. The same research also found dads (those outside competitive environments) had the lowest testosterone levels compared to other males. The second theory is also similar and is known as the evolutionary neuroandrogenic (ENA) theory of male aggression. Testosterone and other androgens have evolved to masculinize a brain in order to be competitive even as far as being a risk to harming others. By doing so, individuals with masculinized brains as a result of pre-natal and adult life testosterone and androgens enhance their resource acquiring abilities in order to survive, attract and copulate with mates as much as possible. Thus, crime can been seen as an extreme form of <b>adaptation</b> to gain <b>status</b> and acquire more resources. Many other researchers have agreed with this and have stated that criminal behavior is an expression of inter-male competition in mating efforts and resource seeking since there is a huge correlation between criminals and fathering children at younger ages.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{analyzes the}} relationship between comic-to-live-action adaptations and race from the 1940 s through the present. Comic-to-live-action adaptations are increasingly lucrative and appeal to mass audiences, and as such the representations of race contained in these texts circulate widely and impact and interact with other media representations. Multiple media industries, including the comics, film, and television industries {{are involved in the}} live-action adaptation process. Each of these industries has its own set of expectations about the adaptation and its intended audience, and these assumptions circulate throughout the industries. I consider historical examples of comic-to-live-action adaptations, archival material from Marvel Comics relating to ideas about live-action adaptation of their characters, interviews with comics professionals and promotional materials from other industry workers involved with adaptations, and contemporary representations of Asian American and Latina/os in comic-to-live-action adaptations. Comics professionals often feel disrespected by the live-action industries, experience a lack of agency in the adaptation of their work, and choose not to have their work adapted. This diminishes the pool of available representations in comics, which in turn results in less diverse live-action <b>adaptations.</b> The historical <b>status</b> of live-action comic adaptation as a lowbrow genre and how industries react to its increased prominence in the present day have also impacted how race is represented. Racial difference is often represented in higher-profile adaptations, but nuanced discussion of race and its meanings is rare. This dissertation contributes to existing work in media studies, ethnic studies, and media industry and production studies, particularly in examining how the processes involved at various levels of media production impact representations of race in media...|$|R
5000|$|A first {{example of}} mutual <b>adaptation</b> is the <b>status</b> of Catholics within the legal {{framework}} of the colony. Official policy following the incorporation of the first civil government of Quebec in 1763 mandated the imposition of all penal acts that formed the public law of Britain, including the 1558 Act of Supremacy which barred Catholics from holding remunerated government positions. This exclusionary sentiment is echoed in the Quebec grand jury presentment of October 1764, which objected {{to the presence of}} Catholic Jurors as an [...] "open Violation of our most sacred Laws and Libertys, and tending to the utter subversion of the protestant Religion and his Majesty’s power authority, right, and possession of the province to which we belong." [...] However, beyond this seemingly rigid religious ideology, the judicial framework presented ambiguities that permitted Governor Murray to make exceptions to accommodate practical realities. Nuanced language in the framing of the October 1764 presentment, which only excluded [...] "papists or popish recusant convicts" [...] and not papists in general, provided colonial administrators the leeway to account for the administrative necessities of running a country populated in majority by a foreign ethnic group. Indeed, the limited number of Protestant males in the colony (they numbered 200 in 1763 and crept to no more than 700 by 1775) meant that Carleton, and Murray before him, had to look elsewhere to staff the state apparatus, and the only available pool was the Canadien population. The shifting legal definition of Catholicism in the Province of Quebec represents not an instance of British cultural domination and paternal enforcement, but rather a propensity for mutual adaptation in the face of regional circumstances and challenges.|$|R
40|$|At present, {{the amount}} of water demanded exceeds the water {{quantity}} that remains as a resource and it becomes scarcer each year. When it comes to water consumption in buildings, apparel buildings consume a considerable amount of water for both production processes and to fulfil the requirements {{of a large number of}} occupants. However, there are different perceptions towards water efficiency. As an example, one party is aimed at adhering the green building concept in order to retrieve water efficiency while another perception focus towards achieving water efficiency through various methods without giving consideration for <b>adaptation</b> of green <b>status.</b> Therefore, this study looks at how water efficiency is addressed and what benefits have being received for green buildings compared to nongreen buildings. Initially, a comprehensive literature review was carried out with the purpose of getting familiarized with research areas. Case study method was used to compare water efficiency status in green and non-green buildings in apparel industry. Two cases are selected from each building type for the data collection purpose. Semi structured interviews were carried out with respective industrial personnel and findings of case study was analyzed using the Nvivo. Research findings revealed that both green and non-green building are having similar purviews on the consideration towards the water efficiency and integrated with high quality water efficient practices to enhance the water efficient performances of the buildings. However, certain good practices could be observed in green buildings compared to non- green buildings. That is, individual commitment of the organisation together with third party commitment is making the building more towards water efficient. Finally, the study provides recommendations for good practices towards water efficient practices in the apparel industry.
