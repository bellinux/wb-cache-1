5|$|Generally, {{companies}} want to retain creative {{control over their}} intellectual properties and <b>are</b> <b>wary</b> <b>of</b> fan-created works, like fan fiction. However, because machinima provides free marketing, they have avoided a response demanding strict copyright enforcement. In 2003, Linden Lab was praised for changing license terms to allow users to retain ownership of works created in its virtual world Second Life. Rooster Teeth initially tried to release Red vs. Blue unnoticed by Halos owners because they feared that any communication would force them to end the project. However, Microsoft, Bungie's parent company at the time, contacted the group shortly after episode 2, and allowed them to continue without paying licensing fees.|$|E
5|$|The Welsh Springer Spaniel is a {{breed of}} dog {{and a member}} of the spaniel family. Thought to be {{comparable}} to the old Land Spaniel, they are similar to the English Springer Spaniel and historically have been referred to as both the Welsh Spaniel and the Welsh Cocker Spaniel. They were relatively unknown until a succession of victories in dog trials by the breed increased its popularity. Following recognition by The Kennel Club in 1902, the breed gained the modern name of Welsh Springer Spaniel. The breed's coat only comes in a single colour combination of white with red markings, usually in a piebald pattern. Loyal and affectionate, they can become very attached to family members and <b>are</b> <b>wary</b> <b>of</b> strangers. Health conditions are limited to those common among many breeds of dog, although they are affected more than average by hip dysplasia and some eye conditions. They are a working dog, bred for hunting, and while not as rare as some varieties of spaniel, they are rarer than the more widely known English Springer Spaniel with which they are sometimes confused.|$|E

25|$|Beginning in the 1930s, {{opposition}} arose to {{the idea}} of a world government, as advocated by organizations such as the World Federalist Movement (WFM). Those who oppose global governance typically do so on objections that the idea is unfeasible, inevitably oppressive, or simply unnecessary. In general, these opponents <b>are</b> <b>wary</b> <b>of</b> the concentration of power or wealth that such governance might represent. Such reasoning dates back to the founding of the League of Nations and, later, the United Nations.|$|E
25|$|Guazzini's latest moves include renting the Parc des Princes, Stade de France, {{and most}} {{recently}} King Baudouin Stadium for big games, and using pink jerseys. Stade Français are heavily criticised by old-timers, especially in France's rugby bastions in the south, for their innovative spirit which tends to hurt traditional image and values of rugby such as humility and seriousness. Some people <b>are</b> <b>wary</b> <b>of</b> the club's relation {{to the world of}} media and show business (players are regularly invited as TV show guests). The critiques can also be explained by the historic Paris vs provinces divide and some form of acrimony {{in the rest of the}} country for everything that comes from the capital. Others consider it is good for rugby in its quest to maintain itself as France's second most popular sport after Association football and shed its image as a gross rural south-western form of fistfight.|$|E

25|$|Introduced predators, in {{particular}} foxes, {{are a significant}} threat to the ground-nesting colonial seabirds and shorebirds of the Summerland Peninsula. Foxes were introduced to Phillip Island in 1907 and while various control methods have been implemented since 1918 none were successful. Fox monitoring and control is difficult as foxes have high breeding productivity, <b>are</b> <b>wary</b> <b>of</b> humans, highly mobile, ecologically adaptable and their 'surplus kill' hunting behaviour can kill up to 30 penguins a night. In 2007 PINP established a dedicated fox eradication program {{with the aim of}} removing all foxes from Phillip Island and as a result there has been a decline in penguin moralities by foxes on the peninsula from 125 killed in 2007/2008 to five killed in the subsequent four years. In 2012 there was an estimated 11 foxes remaining across the whole of Phillip Island, if the program is successful Phillip Island will be the largest island from which red foxes have been eradicated.|$|E
25|$|Investors in Nintendo {{have been}} more {{cautious}} about the Switch, leading to a significant drop in its stock price, which had otherwise been trading at their highest values over the previous five years. The company's stock price, which rose by 4% {{on the day before}} the Switch's October 2016 announcement in anticipation, fell by 7% the next day. Analysts attribute the drop to the lack of surprise of the announcement given the prior year of product teases and information, giving investors no catalyst to invest further. Following the technical presentation of the Switch in January 2017, Nintendo's stock price fell by more than 5% the following day, with one analyst stating that the markets were concerned if the Switch would attract new gamers outside of the core Nintendo fan group. Nintendo's stock value continued to drop, and by early February 2017, had fallen below the September 2016 price. Fahey said that investors <b>are</b> <b>wary</b> <b>of</b> the new approach that Nintendo had taken with the Switch, along with its new mobile gaming initiative, representing significant and difficult-to-assess risks to the company's prospects in the future.|$|E

500|$|Ethan Gutmann, a {{journalist}} reporting on China {{since the early}} 1990s, has attempted to explain the apparent dearth of public sympathy for Falun Gong as stemming, in part, from the group's shortcomings in public relations. Unlike the democracy activists or Tibetans, who have found a comfortable place in Western perceptions, [...] "Falun Gong marched to a distinctly Chinese drum," [...] according to Gutmann. This, coupled with western skepticism of persecuted refugees, {{has resulted in a}} perception that Falun Gong practitioners tended to exaggerate, or [...] "spout slogans rather than facts." [...] Gutmann also observes that Falun Gong also lacks robust backing from the American constituencies that usually support religious freedom: liberals <b>are</b> <b>wary</b> <b>of</b> Falun Gong's conservative morality, Christian conservatives don't accord the practice the same space as persecuted Christians, and the political center is wary of disrupting commercial and political relations with the Chinese government. Thus, Falun Gong practitioners have largely had to rely on their own resources in responding to the persecution.|$|E
500|$|The {{meat and}} {{cartilage}} of the pelagic stingray are sometimes utilized, {{for example in}} Indonesia, {{but for the most}} part this species is considered worthless and discarded when caught. Susceptible to longlines, gillnets, purse seines, and bottom trawls, it is captured incidentally in large numbers throughout its range. Rays caught on longlines suffer high mortality, as fishers <b>are</b> <b>wary</b> <b>of</b> being stung and remove the rays from the hooks by smashing them against the side of the boat, causing severe damage to the mouth and jaws. The extent of this bycatch has yet to be quantified. Regardless, surveys in the Pacific suggest that pelagic stingray numbers have increased since the 1950s, possibly due to commercial fisheries depleting the dominant predators in the ecosystem, such as sharks and tuna. The lack of population declines, coupled with its wide distribution and high reproductive rate, has led the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to list this species under Least Concern. Recent research has been conducted into reducing pelagic stingray bycatch on longlines by switching to larger and/or [...] "C"-shaped hooks.|$|E
