5|$|In {{exploring}} {{the similarities between}} Sjair Abdoel Moeloek and Siti Akbari, Zaini-Lajoubert notes that {{the names of the}} individual kingdoms, save Barham (Barbam in Siti Akbari), are taken directly from the earlier work. Names of characters, such as Abdul Muluk (in Siti Akbari, Abdul Moelan) and Siti Rapiah (Siti Akbari), are simply replaced, although some minor characters are present in one story <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> The main plot elements in both stories are the same; some elements, such as the birth and childhood of Abdul Muluk and the later adventures of Siti Rapiah's son, are present in one story and not the other– or given more detail. The two differ greatly in their styles, especially Lie's emphasis on description and realism.|$|E
5|$|The {{previous}} North American {{calendar of}} the ELCA {{was different from}} its European counterparts in {{that it does not}} give equal weight (and sometimes gives no mention) to persons who may be commemorated in Scandinavian regions. One example would be the absence of St. Lucia on December 13, although she enjoys particular popularity in Sweden. But Lutheran calendars also differ amongst one another in North America, with some individuals commemorated on multiple calendars but on different days (e.g., St. Bernard of Clairvaux on August 19 in the LCMS and August 20 in the ELCA) or individuals commemorated on one calendar <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> (e.g., Martin Luther King, Jr. on January 15 for the ELCA and C. F. W. Walther on May 7 for the LCMS); with the 2006 publication of Evangelical Lutheran Worship (ELW) as a replacement to the Lutheran Book of Worship (LBW), some of these deficiencies in the ELCA calendar have been corrected. Within the ELCA, This Far by Faith and Libro de Liturgia y Cantico both prescribe calendars with additional commemorations specific to the ethnic communities they were intended to be used in (African Americans and Latinos respectively). The Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod has a different, somewhat minimized calendar when compared the LCMS and especially the ELCA.|$|E
30|$|Other models {{depending}} {{on a few}} number of parameters {{could be used as}} well. A more sophisticated example is given in Kimura et al (2003), with aggregates of 1 -compound monodispersed grains. Indeed, the optical properties of these numerical particles were shown to be fairly independent of the cluster shape and size, for the grain radius and refractive index expected for cometary dust particles. Then, after characterizing wavelength ranges and optical quantities which are sensitive to one of <b>the</b> parameters <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>others,</b> one should be able to build inverse-method tools for grain radius and refractive index determination from observational data.|$|R

25|$|One {{solution}} to the steering problem is to use two separate drivetrains, each driving one track. Steering is accomplished by changing gears on one <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> This maintains power to both tracks while steering, produces {{a wide range of}} turning circles, and even allows one track to be reversed while the other moves forward, allowing the tank to turn in place. This may be combined with brakes to further control the steering radius.|$|E
25|$|A simple step up {{from the}} dual drive concept {{is to use a}} single engine and split the power output into two transmissions. Steering is {{accomplished}} by changing the gear on one track <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> This reduces the complexity of the dual-drive system when combined with a modern engine. It also introduces a new behaviour; additional load on one track causes the other to slow as well. This is actually an improvement over the dual drive solution, as it causes the entire tank to slow, not turn towards the loaded track.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} to dissect the embryo at other stages so as to accordingly give rise to one lineage of cells from an embryo selectively <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> For example, subsets of blastomeres {{can be used to}} give rise to chimera with specified cell lineage from one embryo. The Inner Cell Mass of a diploid blastocyst for example {{can be used to make}} a chimera with another blastocyst of eight-cell diploid embryo; the cells taken from the inner cell mass will give rise to the primitive endoderm and to the epiblast in the chimera mouse.|$|E

25|$|There {{are also}} {{important}} differences between the Masoretic and Samaritan version of the Pentateuch in the readings of many sentences. Some distinctions seem motivated by (or reflect) actual philosophical differences between Judaism and Samaritanism. Some of these are glaringly obvious, like {{the inclusion of a}} passage in the Samaritan version of the Ten Commandments that restates the command to build an altar on Mt. Gerizim, and says plainly that Mt. Gerizim is the site where all future sacrifices must be offered. Since the location of God's holy site is probably the central original difference between Judaism and Samaritanism, it makes sense that this passage is in one version <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b>|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} of Stalin's death in 1953, the Central Committee had become largely a {{symbolic}} organ that was responsible to the Politburo, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> way around. The death of Stalin revitalised the Central Committee, and it became an important institution during the power struggle to succeed Stalin. Following Khrushchev's ascension to power, the Central Committee still played a leading role; it overturned the Politburo's decision to remove Khrushchev from office in 1957. In 1964, the Central Committee ousted Khrushchev from power, and elected Leonid Brezhnev as First Secretary. The Central Committee was an important organ {{in the beginning of}} Brezhnev's rule, but lost effective power to the Politburo. From then on, until the ascension of Mikhail Gorbachev, the Central Committee played a minor role in the running of the party and state– the Politburo was the highest political organ in the Soviet Union.|$|E
25|$|In a {{shocking}} twist however, the entire {{chain of events}} is revealed to have been engineered {{by none other than}} Argus Pytel himself: a top ranking intelligence officer and a Collaborationist, he engineered for both Resistance groups to embark on suicidal missions, confident of the Empire's chance to recover quickly from any damage via its control over the timeline. The rebel crew member aboard the Cobalt King was actually killed by Pytel <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> way around, a fact he took advantage of to trick his father's faction into action. The plan however took yet another unexpected turn when, surprising the attacker of the Domus and shooting him down with a barrage of missiles, he was horrified to discover he had just killed his own father. Meanwhile, approximately a thousand years later, Akyta was herself met with a defeat as the Ophan, upon critically malfunctioning, activated the Project's self-destruct system, detonating the facility and killing the Enkie slaves, effectively eradicating the entire Enkie race.|$|E
30|$|The {{second most}} {{important}} perception in determining the node selection was the eligibility of the resource. Eligibility of the resource refers to {{the degree to which}} a person believes that a node has the information needed or has the ability to solve the task. Both the self-efficacy and eligibility dimensions are two sides of the same coin, as both are referring to the nodes’ ability to achieve the task. However, the node in the self-efficacy dimension refers to oneself while the node in eligibility refers to other resources. According to participants’ statements, the eligibility dimension was graded from very strong to very weak. It is important to note that the categorization of the eligibility dimension is superficial and categorization was done using points on a continuum scale. Furthermore, it was difficult to decide if the participants’ behaviour in the experiment was referring to one category <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>others.</b>|$|R

25|$|The preparatory attentional {{and memory}} (PAM) theory proposes {{two types of}} {{processes}} involved in successful prospective memory performance. The first component of this theory involves a monitoring process that begins when a person constructs an intention that is then maintained until it is performed. This monitoring component involves a capacity-consuming process, {{similar to those used}} when maintaining attention, because {{there is a need for}} the intention to be stored and maintained in memory. The second component involves the use of elements of retrospective memory processes. These elements are used to differentiate between the wanted prospective memory intention and unwanted thoughts, in an attempt to keep focus on the goal <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> options surrounding it. Retrospective memory is also used to remember specifically what intention is supposed to be performed in the future, and the monitoring process is needed to be able to remember to perform this action at the correct condition or time.|$|E

500|$|Further {{work was}} carried out to {{the east side of}} the college, {{fronting}} onto Turl Street, in 1756 under Thomas Pardo (principal from 1727 to 1763). A new doorway replaced the previous Elizabethan one, and the front of the college was remodelled in the Palladian style– oblong sash windows were inserted at all levels and the original gables on the Turl Street side of the building were removed. Pardo himself gave £157 10s towards this work, although this only met the mason's bill of £156 18s 11d <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> large bills for the work.
