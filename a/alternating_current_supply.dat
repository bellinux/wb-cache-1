For example a machine with 8 physical pairs of poles, could be connected to allow running with either 4 or 8 pole pairs, giving two speeds - at 60 Hz, these would be 1800 RPM and 900 RPM. If speed changes are rare, the motor may be initially connected for one speed then re-wired for the other speed as process conditions change, or, magnetic contactors can be used to switch between the two speeds as process needs fluctuate.

In 1896 the company had 5,303 customers as well as public lighting including thirteen miles of streets within the City.

50|$|The {{company was}} {{originally}} founded on 1 November 1919 as Pelger in Rotterdam in the Netherlands by Mr. Willem D. Pelger, with a funding capital of 40 Dutch guilders The company {{started at the}} Zwanesteeg 4 in Rotterdam as a direct current electric motor repair shop. In 1920 the first employee was offered a job. Direct current motors were in use in Rotterdam, {{as a result of}} the direct current power supply instead of <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> <b>supply</b> in these early days of electric grid. In March 1926 the company moved to the Paardenstraat 5 and in May 1929 they moved on to the Van Speykstraat 86-102 in Rotterdam. In 1936 a centrifugal fan, brake motors and small induction motors program from another manufacturer named HSM (short for: Heinke-Schuitema-Musselkanaal) in Musselkanaal was bought and brought to Rotterdam. Mr. K.W. Heinke, one of the former owners and mechanical engineer of HSM also moved to work at the factory in Rotterdam. In the same year 40 off. patents were applied for, with reference to three inventions: the centrifugal switch, the centrifugal fan housing and the principle of a squirrel-cage rotor. The Pelger repair shop gradually evolved into a factory designing and manufacturing special electric motors and centrifugal fans. After some time the two original company names Pelger and HSM were changed into a variant of the existing names: Holland Special Machines Pelger or HSM-Pelger.|$|E

The only means of currently detecting TLOSRs is intra-luminal manometry and the probes themselves may stimulate TLOSRs. The squamo-columnar junction moves 4 - 5 centimeters proximally during TLOSRs and this provides a means of detecting such episodes. The objective of this work {{is to develop a}} sensor system capable of detecting the movement of a miniature magnet attached to the squamo-columnar junction from outside the body and thus allow detection of TLOSRs without the artifact associated with intraluminal detection probes. A GaAs Hall effect sensor was selected and an <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> <b>supply</b> was developed with a combination of filters and a Phase Sensitive Detector, to detect the magnet. The oscillation frequency of the current was chosen in order to reduce electronic noise, and filtering outside this frequency means the signal to noise ratio was greatly improved. The phase sensitive detector was employed to accurately convert the amplitude of the sensor's output to a DC signal. With the addition of paired Flux Concentrators increases the range up to 10. 2 centimetres, an improvement of 580 % over commercial Hall effect sensors. The AC circuit and flux concentrator device far exceeds the sensitivity of the current Hall effect sensors supplied in the market, by rejecting noise and providing accurate measurement over significantly larger distances. The development of this sensor has applications beyond this specific medical device...|$|E

40|$|In {{terms of}} cost and {{maintenance}} the polyphase induction motor has advantages compared with its direct current counterpart, but {{the control of}} the output torque and speed is more involved. The advent of high power thyristors has allowed a new appraisal of the induction motor for variable speed drives (e. g. winches, cranes, and traction), and some of the well established, but inefficient methods (in terms of cost, control, and power consumption) have been given a new look. This thesis compares some of these methods of control, namely variable frequency, stator voltage, and rotor control and suggests a combination of stator voltage and rotor control to increase the versatility of the machine and to extend the torque/speed envelope of operation without the complexity of a fall inverter system. It is shown that the harmonics produced by a square wave inverter output can be reduced by increasing the number of pulses per half cycle output if the individual pulses have a given relationship. The influence of this harmonic reduction in the output of the inverter fed induction motor is investigated. An equivalent circuit is developed to represent the induction motor when fed with voltage waveforms of high harmonic content. This equivalent circuit is solved using a finite difference technique and is shown to give first order results with a variety of voltage waveforms. First order performance predictions are shown to be possible of an induction motor system, stator fed from a three phase <b>alternating</b> <b>current</b> <b>supply</b> via "back-to-back" pairs of thyristors using a simple chart method. The chart in this method gives a "derated" value of current available from the production of output torque, based on the uncontrolled theoretical performance of the motor and the given firing angle of the thyristors and the power factor of the motor at the given speed. The prediction of the performance of an induction motor with a thyristor direct current chopper in the rotor circuits in both the motoring and braking regions is achieved using the concept of an effective rotor resistance. The procedure for the calculation of this resistance from given parameters of known values is given, and the theoretical performance compared with that of an experimental system...|$|E
