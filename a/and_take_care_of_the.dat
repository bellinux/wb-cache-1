Sometime later, Carlos visits a memorial to Laura, Simón and the orphans. Carlos returns to the orphans' old bedroom and finds a medallion that he had given to Laura. He turns to look as the door opens, and he smiles.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} the catastrophic flooding in Monterrey, an appeal {{was made to}} the United States and other nations for aid. Many residents and visitors in the city did all they could to help rescue those trapped in the flood waters <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> homeless. According to the New York Times, one person rescued 30 people stranded in flood waters. Numerous rescue operations were undertaken during the flood, saving many lives. However, survivors faced another issue after losing their homes: lack of food. Food was unavailable to most residents {{in the wake of}} the storm until August31 when the first relief supplies arrived. Even then, most only received a small amount of bread and beans. Once the flood along the Santa Catarina River receded, searches were conducted to attempt to locate the bodies of victims. However, reports indicated that the river bed was similar to quicksand and most bodies on it were likely underground.|$|E

25|$|The {{inhabitants}} of Lisbon {{then decided to}} erect a shrine on the site to house the relic; the shrine was begun on 24 March 1506 and dedicated on 25 February 1515. This early shrine was oriented from west to east, in the medieval tradition. A “Plague Courtyard” for the burial of plague victims adjoined the shrine and was formally dedicated on 24 May 1527 by Bishop D. Ambrósio. At {{about the same time}} a Brotherhood (or confraternity) of St. Roch was established to oversee <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shrine. Made up of people from all classes, the Brotherhood still exists today, and maintains the Chapel of St. Roch in the present church.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} stage of the colony founding, the queen Vespula vulgaris {{does most of the}} work, both {{building}} and foraging. After the nest is completely built, she expands her foraging resources from only pulps to pulps, fluids and insect flesh. The labor divides as the first batch of larvae is hatched. However, during {{the very beginning of the}} hatching, the workers do not take part of any labor. Rather, they remain motionless with their heads inside a cell. Workers actually start foraging actively after seven days. They both forage <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> broods by feeding the larvae, breaking down the insect flesh, dividing fluids collected by the foragers, removing trophallactic secretion from the larvae, and fixing the nests.|$|E
25|$|Only {{certain kinds}} of {{discrimination}} are covered by fair housing laws. Landlords are not {{required by law to}} rent to any tenant who applies for a property. Landlords can select tenants based on objective business criteria, such as the applicant's ability to pay the rent <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> property. Landlords can lawfully discriminate against tenants with bad credit histories or low incomes, and (except in some areas) do not have to rent to tenants who will be receiving Section 8 vouchers. Landlords must be consistent in the screening, treat tenants who are inside and outside the protected classes in the same manner, and should document any legitimate business reason for not renting to a prospective tenant. As of 2010, no federal protection against discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity is provided, but these protections do exist in some localities.|$|E

25|$|In {{the decades}} since 5/4 GR {{first arrived in}} Bakloh, in 1963, Bakloh has lost its sheen, and the officer and {{the men of the}} Regiment appear no longer as keen on Bakloh {{as they were in the}} fifties. They {{complain}} that it is on a limb, and small and boring. As a result of the constant gripe against Bakloh, it has lost its 'asterisk' status. This is a cause of big disappointment for the 4 GR pensioners in Bakloh. Many older officers, Junior Commissioned Officers(JCOs), and men, especially those who started their regimental careers in Bakloh, are unaffected by those who grumble about Bakloh, and remain fond and attachment to Bakloh; and committed to the idea that Bakloh should have a Battalion from the Regiment to sustain the Bakloh legacy <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> regimental properties, remains, and the sizeable population of regiment's pensioners, and widows.|$|E

According to the book Meet the Mertzes, Frawley often would visit the studio after his retirement. He did not hide his resentment of Demarest and was eventually asked not to return to the set.|$|E
2500|$|Traditional Jews {{commonly}} practice [...] "ma'aser kesafim," [...] tithing 10% {{of their}} income to support those in need. [...] The Rabbis decreed (against Essene practice, and against advice given in the New Testament) that one should not give away much, {{most or all of}} their possessions. They did not expect a supernatural savior to come <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poor, and so they held that one must not make oneself poor. [...] Given that nearly all Jews of their day were poor or middle-class (even the rich of that time were only rich relative to the poor), they ruled that one should not give away more than a fifth of his income to charity, while yet being obligated to give away no less than 10% of his income to charity.|$|E

[...] Sonny Barger, who also called into the KSAN forum, states: [...] "We were told {{by one of the}} (other Hells Angels) clubs if we showed up down there (and) sat on the stage and drink some beer ... that the Stones manager or somebody had bought for us." [...] In his lengthy call, Barger mentions the beer deal yet again: [...] "I ain't no cop, I ain't never going to ever pretend to be no cop. I didn't go there to police nothing, man. They told me if I could {{sit on the edge of}} the stage so nobody could climb over me, I could drink beer until the show was over. And that's what I went there to do." ...|$|E
