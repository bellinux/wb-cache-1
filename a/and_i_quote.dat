2500|$|The 7 RAR mascot and nickname, [...] "the Pigs", has a {{long and}} celebrated history within the {{battalion}}. According to Corporal Roy Savage:The single men of 3 RAR were sent to Puckapunyal {{to form a new}} battalion, 7 RAR. I arrived there on 11th November 1965. At first there were only regular soldiers. We used to keep the boozer open all weekend having the cooks bring our meals there. Anyway, on my second week there the new CO (Colonel Eric Smith) decided to inspect his new battalion area on a Sunday. He immediately closed the boozer. The next day he called a muster parade of the whole battalion and commenced to tell us what he thought of us. Half way through his speech he said <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>quote,</b> 'You are nothing but a mob of pigs'. Then from the back rank someone called out 'oink oink'. From that time onwards we became the Pig Battalion.|$|E
2500|$|A {{session of}} the United Nations Security Council was convened, in which UN Under-Secretary-General B. Lynn Pascoe gave a {{briefing}} about the refugee situation and Edmond Mulet briefed about the situation relating to the mandate of UNOMIG. Following statements by Georgia and the United States, the Russian ambassador said: [...] "Unfortunately, I have {{to point out that}} the content of the briefing by Mr. Pascoe shows that the Secretariat and its leadership have not been able to adopt an objective position showing a thorough grasp of the substance of this conflict, as should be expected from the leadership of such an authoritative international organization." [...] The Ambassador for the United States stated: [...] "Foreign Minister Lavrov told United States Secretary of State Rice that the democratically elected President of Georgia — <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>quote</b> — 'must go'. I quote again: 'Saakashvili must go'. This is completely unacceptable and crosses the line." [...] The Russian ambassador responded by saying, [...] "On Ambassador Khalilzad’s interesting reference to a confidential diplomatic telephone call between our Minister for Foreign Affairs and his Secretary of State, I must say at the outset that regime change is an American expression. We do not use such expressions." [...] After the meeting, CNN reported, [...] "But Churkin drew a rebuke from other Security Council members, including its current president, after he questioned the objectivity of a top U.N. official who briefed ambassadors on the conflict in Georgia". Sergey Lavrov later claimed that Russian [...] "peace enforcement" [...] operation was not linked to the removal of Saakashvili from office. He said Condoleezza Rice [...] "incorrectly interpreted" [...] the phone conversation between them. He added if an agreement on non-use of military force is signed, [...] "peace will be restored independently of the further fate of Saakashvili".|$|E

6000|$|It was the {{newspapers}} that {{were responsible for}} the next disaster that befell him. For the five years following the publication of his book he had remained silent, and silence for a lonely man is not good. One can conjecture sympathetically the awful solitude of Emil Gluck in that populous University; for he was without friends and without sympathy. His only recourse was books, and he went on reading and studying enormously. But in 1927 he accepted an invitation to appear before the Human Interest Society of Emeryville. He did not trust himself to speak, and as we write we have before us a copy of his learned paper. It is sober, scholarly, and scientific, and, it must also be added, conservative. But in one place he dealt with, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>quote</b> his words, [...] "the industrial and social revolution that is taking place in society." [...] A reporter present seized upon the word [...] "revolution," [...] divorced it from the text, and wrote a garbled account that made Emil Gluck appear an anarchist.

6000|$|Then thou goest on, page 12, and quotest {{the place}} where I say, page 37. How horribly are those deceived who look on Jesus (but thou leavest out those words, the Son of Mary) to be but a type; which thing you say, you know none that do. And again thou sayest, that I say, he is of {{something}} afterwards to be revealed. My words thou corruptest; thou wouldst fain gather thus much out of my words, by corrupting them. that though I denied Christ Jesus the Son of Mary to be a type, yet I myself say, He was a type, yet I myself say, He was a type of something afterward to be revealed. Which thing, as there in my book, so here again I do most positively deny, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>quote</b> the same words again, for a second confirmation of the same, saying as then I died; [...] "How horribly are those deceived, who look on Jesus the Son of Mary to be but a shadow, or type of something that was afterwards to be revealed." [...] Whereas the scriptures most lively hold him forth to be the Christ of God; and not a type or shadow of a Spirit, or body afterwards to be revealed, but himself was the very substance of all things that did any way hold forth, or type out, Christ to come: And when he was indeed come, then was an end put to the law for righteousness or justification to every one that believeth (Rom 10:4). And therefore, friend, though thou hast, or wouldest corrupt my words, yet have a care of corrupting Christ's words, lest thou dost even heap up wrath against the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgment of God. And whereas thou sayest, [...] "Thou deniest not but Jesus is the substance." [...] Answer, I doubt thou dost not speak thine heart plainly, but hidest thyself with so saying, as with an apron; if we inquire into {{what it is to}} hold froth Jesus the Son of Mary to be the substance. Therefor he that holds forth Jesus the Son of Mary to be indeed the substance, and not a type; holds forth and believes, that that Jesus that was born of the Virgin Mary, did in his own body of flesh fulfil the law, and impute the righteousness of his obedience unto them that he accomplished then without them; and that his blood that was shed without on the cross, doth, and hath washed away all sin past, present, and to come, from him that believeth his; as it is written, [...] "For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, (that is, through our flesh.) God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:" [...] That is, he was condemned in the flesh that he took on him of the Virgin Mary (Rom 8:3). And again, he bore our sins in his own body on the tree, which was the cross on Mount Calvary.|$|E
6000|$|This {{series of}} facts or laws, are mere {{statements}} {{of what is}} the condition of nature. They are facts or inferences which are generally known, generally admitted--but in discussing {{the subject of the}} [...] "Origin of Species"--as generally forgotten. It is from these universally admitted facts, that the origin of all the varied forms of nature may be deduced by a logical chain of reasoning, which, however, is at every step verified and shown to be in strict accord with facts; and, at the same time, many curious phenomena which can by no other means be understood, are explained and accounted for. It is probable, that these primary facts or laws are but results of the very nature of life, and of the essential properties of organized and unorganized matter. Mr. Herbert Spencer, in his [...] "First Principles" [...] and his [...] "Biology" [...] has, I think, made us able to understand how this may be; but at present we may accept these simple laws without going further back, and the question then is--whether the variety, the harmony, the contrivance, and the beauty we perceive in organic beings, can have been produced by the action of these laws alone, or whether we are required to believe in the incessant interference and direct action of the mind and will of the Creator. It is simply a question of how the Creator has worked. The Duke (<b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>quote</b> him as having well expressed the views of the more intelligent of Mr. Darwin's opponents) maintains, that He has personally applied general laws to produce effects, which those laws are not in themselves capable of producing; that the universe alone, with all its laws intact, would be a sort of chaos, without variety, without harmony, without design, without beauty; that there is not (and therefore we may presume that there could not be) any self-developing power in the universe. I believe, on the contrary, that the universe is so constituted as to be self-regulating; that as long as it contains Life, the forms under which that life is manifested have an inherent power of adjustment {{to each other and to}} surrounding nature; and that this adjustment necessarily leads to the greatest amount of variety and beauty and enjoyment, because it does depend on general laws, and not on a continual supervision and re-arrangement of details. As a matter of feeling and religion, I hold this to be a far higher conception of the Creator and of the Universe than that which may be called the [...] "continual interference" [...] hypothesis; but it is not a question to be decided by our feelings or convictions, it is a question of facts and of reason. Could the change, which Geology shows us has ever taken place in the forms of life, have been produced by general laws, or does it imperatively require the incessant supervision of a creative mind? This is the question for us to consider, and our opponents have the difficult task of proving a negative, if we show that there are both facts and analogies in our favour.|$|E

[156] For months {{past the}} reports of the health {{conditions}} in the Central Empires have been of such a character that the imagination is dulled, and one almost seems guilty of sentimentality in quoting them. But their general veracity is not disputed, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>quote</b> the three following, that the reader may not be unmindful of them: [...] "In {{the last years of}} the war, in Austria alone at least 35,000 people died of tuberculosis, in Vienna alone 12,000. Today we have to reckon with a number of at least 350,000 to 400,000 people who require treatment for tuberculosis.... As the result of malnutrition a bloodless generation is growing up with undeveloped muscles, undeveloped joints, and undeveloped brain" [...] (Neue Freie Presse, May 31, 1919). The Commission of Doctors appointed by the Medical Faculties of Holland, Sweden, and Norway to examine the conditions in Germany reported as follows in the Swedish Press in April, 1919: [...] "Tuberculosis, especially in children, is increasing in an appalling way, and, generally speaking, is malignant. In the same way rickets is more serious and more widely prevalent. It is impossible to do anything for these diseases; there is no milk for the tuberculous, and no cod-liver oil for those suffering from rickets.... Tuberculosis is assuming almost unprecedented aspects, such as have hitherto only been known in exceptional cases. The whole body is attacked simultaneously, and the illness in this form is practically incurable.... Tuberculosis is nearly always fatal now among adults. It is the cause of 90 per cent of the hospital cases. Nothing can be done against it owing to lack of food-stuffs.... It appears in the most terrible forms, such as glandular tuberculosis, which turns into purulent dissolution." [...] The following is by a writer in the Vossische Zeitung, June 5, 1919, who accompanied the Hoover Mission to the Erzgebirge: [...] "I visited large country districts where 90 per cent of all the children were ricketty and where children of three years are only beginning to walk.... Accompany me to a school in the Erzgebirge. You think it is a kindergarten for the little ones. No, these are children of seven and eight years. Tiny faces, with large dull eyes, overshadowed by huge puffed, ricketty foreheads, their small arms just skin and bone, and above the crooked legs with their dislocated joints the swollen, pointed stomachs of the hunger oedema.... 'You see this child here,' the physician in charge explained; 'it consumed an incredible amount of bread, and yet did not get any stronger. I found out that it hid all the bread it received underneath its straw mattress. The fear of hunger was so deeply rooted in the child that it collected stores instead of eating the food: a misguided animal instinct made the dread of hunger worse than the actual pangs.'" [...] Yet there are many persons apparently in whose opinion justice requires that such beings should pay tribute until they are forty or fifty years of age in relief of the British taxpayer.|$|E
