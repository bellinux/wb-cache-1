5|$|Despite DuPont's grand {{boulevard}} {{not coming}} to fruition, he was a visionary who implemented key practices before they became standard in the decades after he initiated his project. After his death in 1930, DuPont was recognized for foreseeing that traffic on highways would approach the speed and volume of railroads and planning with provisions for future needs. Based on that vision, he designed his highway with a wide right-of-way and curves <b>and</b> <b>grades</b> adequate for high-speed traffic. The DuPont Highway was also innovative {{as one of the}} earliest roads to be constructed on a new alignment that passed close to towns but not directly through them, a development that was more convenient for through traffic and less disruptive to a town's residents. Up to that point, the use of bypasses had been limited to the railroads. South of Milford, the DuPont Highway was constructed entirely on new alignment except from Bedford Street north of Georgetown to Old State Road at Redden. The portion of the highway north of Milford, which DSHD designed, mostly overlaid the existing MilfordDover highway. The two exceptions were through Frederica, where the State Road used Market Street, and between Milford and Frederica, where the State Road followed Jenkins Pond Road, Reynolds Road, Pritchett Road, and Milford Neck Road.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Classroom Action Research study was to: 1) refine the {{definition}} of the Learner Centered (LC) Learning Model, 2) develop LC Objectives based on this definition for exams <b>and</b> <b>grading,</b> 3) create a new form of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) examination <b>and</b> <b>grading</b> methodology which meet these LC Objectives, 4) measure the effectiveness of this LC exam <b>and</b> <b>grading</b> experience, <b>and</b> 5) compare the effectiveness of this LC experience with traditional exam <b>and</b> <b>grading</b> methods. 118 university undergraduate and graduate learners took a midterm exam (multiple choice or essay), were <b>graded</b> <b>and</b> then surveyed.

40|$|Sizing <b>and</b> <b>grading</b> {{are widely}} used to create {{products}} to fit selected populations. Currently, the sizing <b>and</b> <b>grading</b> rules are derived from anthropometric measures; however past researches have indicated {{that it is not}} very accurate. This study proposes a new technique to use principal component analysis (PCA) on 3 D surface points for sizing <b>and</b> <b>grading</b> wearable products. The accuracy of the proposed method is illustrated by developing a sizing <b>and</b> <b>grading</b> rule for the feet. After developing a model using the feet data of 60 participants and validating using the feet data of 10 different participants, results showed that sizing <b>and</b> <b>grading</b> using PCA is more accurate than traditional techniques. Compared with traditional foot sizing, PCA based sizing <b>and</b> <b>grading</b> showed an improvement of about 25 % in accuracy. In addition, results also indicated that the grading rule derived from PCA loading was better than the proportional grading. This research provides a new direction to consider when developing the sizing <b>and</b> <b>grading</b> rules.

40|$|The {{assessment}} {{reform movement}} {{has focused on}} classroom assessment <b>and</b> <b>grading</b> practices as a potential means to improving teaching and learning. Many researchers agree {{that the best way}} to enhance learning for a diverse range of students is through appropriate, reliable, and valid classroom assessment <b>and</b> <b>grading</b> practices. This is of particular importance in Saskatchewan because the inclusive philosophy has been mandated for all schools. Classroom teachers are responsible for the instruction, assessment, <b>and</b> <b>grading</b> of students with mild disabilities, learning, emotional, and behavioral challenges, and other needs that require specific attention. This study examined secondary classroom teachers’ assessment <b>and</b> <b>grading</b> practices in one urban school division. A survey instrument adapted from the work of Duncan and Noonan (2007) and McMillan (2001) asked current secondary teachers, within inclusive classrooms, to indicate their current assessment <b>and</b> <b>grading</b> practices. Evidence from the survey demonstrated that teachers in this division have diverse assessment <b>and</b> <b>grading</b> practices <b>and</b> that they have begun to explore the potential for assessment to assist all students in their learning. This study has provided data to move forward with some professional development opportunities for teachers and further research in assessment <b>and</b> <b>grading</b> with particular focus on students with special needs in inclusive classrooms...|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{qualitative}} research is to describe the learning experiences of assessment <b>and</b> <b>grading</b> of new teachers and to describe how teaching experience at a school can affect teachers' learning experience. Science method pre-service teachers from a university in New South Wales who gained fulltime employment on completion of their course {{were invited to participate}} in the research project during their first year of teaching. Data was collected from the interested participants to identify their conceptions, actual and intended practices of assessment <b>and</b> <b>grading</b> in three stages using a questionnaire and semi structured interviews in a longitudinal study. Data collected at different stages was compared to describe the learning experiences of new teachers. Furthermore, qualitative data from interviews was analysed to describe how school based teaching experience affect the learning of new teachers. It was found that new teachers experience changes in their conceptions and practices of assessment <b>and</b> <b>grading</b> during the first school semester of their teaching experience. There was minimal change in the teachers' conceptions about the general purpose of assessment <b>and</b> <b>grading.</b> However, there were noticeable changes in the teachers' conceptions about the quality of assessment <b>and</b> <b>grading</b> in terms of what constitutes as acceptable practices of assessment <b>and</b> <b>grading.</b> This suggests that school based teaching experience play a significant role in the learning of the new teachers about assessment <b>and</b> <b>grading,</b> although teachers did not attribute this change to their teaching experience at this school. Findings of this research study have implications for pre-service education programs offered by universities, indicating a need to include more explicit courses in the area of assessment <b>and</b> <b>grading.</b> New teachers also need to be provided with more support in the area of assessment <b>and</b> <b>grading</b> as part of their induction and mentoring systems offered at schools...|$|R
