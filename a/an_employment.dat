5|$|If an {{employee}} does {{make such a}} disclosure, Section 2 inserts a new Section 47B, providing that the employee shall suffer no detriment in their employment as a result. This includes both negative actions {{and the absence of}} action, and as such covers discipline, dismissal, or failing to gain a pay rise or access to facilities which would otherwise have been provided. If {{an employee}} does suffer a detriment, he is permitted to make a complaint before <b>an</b> <b>employment</b> tribunal under Section 3. In front of <b>an</b> <b>employment</b> tribunal, the law is amended in Sections 4 and 5 to provide compensation, and to reverse the burden of proof; if an employee has been dismissed for making a protected disclosure, this dismissal is automatically considered unfair. Similarly, under Section 6, an employee cannot be given priority when discussing redundancies simply because he made such a disclosure. These sections take into account Section 7, which notes that there is no requirement of age or length of employment before they come into effect.|$|E

Michael Doherty, the chairman of the Communication Workers Union, and his brother Tom took Royal Mail to <b>an</b> <b>Employment</b> Tribunal for unfair dismissal claiming they had been acting in self-defence. In 2001, the tribunal ruled in their favour, and ordered Royal Mail to reinstate them. In 2012, the editor of the Daily Mirror at the time, Piers Morgan apologised for printing the pictures.|$|E
