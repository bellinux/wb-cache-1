5|$|After {{the last}} ice age only large mammals such as mammoths, bison and woolly {{rhinoceros}} remained. Roughly 11,000years <b>ago,</b> <b>when</b> the ice sheets began to recede, humans repopulated the area; genetic research suggests they came from {{the northern part of the}} Iberian Peninsula. The sea level was lower than now and Britain was connected by land bridge to Ireland and Eurasia.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, the {{ancestor}} of Oryzomys peninsulae may have arrived by rafting {{during the late}} Miocene, about six million years <b>ago,</b> <b>when</b> {{the southern tip of}} the Baja California peninsula was an island located near what is now Nayarit and Jalisco in western Mexico. Some plants and birds from the area may have a similar biogeographic heritage.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{estimated}} that the group containing the dodo and the Rodrigues solitaire diverged from genera like Goura about 1.5 million years ago. However, that estimate appears highly unlikely. It was estimated that the relatives of the two species moved to the island about 35 million years <b>ago,</b> <b>when</b> a land bridge between Nazareth (Rodrigues) or St. Brandon banks and Mauritius formed.|$|E

5|$|Since the Cambrian {{explosion}} {{there have}} been five distinctly identifiable mass extinctions. The last mass extinction occurred some 66 million years <b>ago,</b> <b>when</b> a meteorite collision probably triggered the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs and other large reptiles, but spared small animals such as mammals. Over the past 66million years, mammalian life diversified.|$|E
5|$|The Khewra Salt Mine is {{also known}} as Mayo Salt Mine, in honour of Lord Mayo, who visited it as Viceroy of India. The mine is a part of a salt range that {{originated}} about 800 million years <b>ago,</b> <b>when</b> evaporation of a shallow sea followed by geological movement formed a salt range that stretched for about 300 kilometers (185 miles).|$|E

5|$|The first {{form of life}} {{to develop}} on the Earth were microbes, and they {{remained}} the only form of life until about a billion years <b>ago</b> <b>when</b> multi-cellular organisms began to appear.

It is sometimes treated as a distinct species, but {{did not differ significantly}} from the extant great spotted woodpecker, whose European subspecies are probably its direct descendants.|$|E
5|$|The mountainous {{terrain of}} the Chetco River {{watershed}} was created approximately 130million years <b>ago</b> <b>when</b> the microcontinent {{collided with the}} much larger North American continent. The process uplifted the complex and exotic terranes of the microcontinent to form the Klamath Mountains. Many glaciers carved U-shaped valleys and cirques during the last ice age, and several alpine lakes still exist today.|$|E

5|$|The present {{geography}} of the Gulf Coast was formed during an ice age approximately 30,000 years <b>ago</b> <b>when</b> dramatic lowering of the sea level occurred. As the ice later melted, it formed a flow through the Trinity and San Jacinto rivers and carved wide valleys in the soft sediments, resulting {{in the creation of}} the modern system of bays and lakes approximately 4500 years ago.|$|E
5|$|The rocks {{exposed in}} the park were formed in the Devonian and Carboniferous periods between 370and 340million years <b>ago,</b> <b>when</b> the land {{was part of the}} {{coastline}} of a shallow sea that covered a great portion of what is now North America. The high mountains to the east of the sea gradually eroded, causing a build-up of sediment made up primarily of clay, sand and gravel.|$|E
5|$|During the Mesozoic (245 to 66 {{million years}} ago) the {{conifers}} flourished and became adapted {{to live in}} all the major terrestrial habitats. Subsequently, the tree forms of flowering plants evolved during the Cretaceous period. These began to dominate the conifers during the Tertiary era (66 to 2 million years <b>ago)</b> <b>when</b> forests covered the globe. When the climate cooled 1.5 million years ago and {{the first of four}} ice ages occurred, the forests retreated as the ice advanced. In the interglacials, trees recolonised the land that had been covered by ice, only to be driven back again in the next ice age.|$|E

5|$|Receiving {{light and}} other signals from distant astronomical sources can even take much longer.

Those photographs, taken today, capture images of the galaxies as they {{appeared}} 13billion years <b>ago,</b> <b>when</b> the universe {{was less than a}} billion years old. The fact that more distant objects appear to be younger, due to the finite speed of light, allows astronomers to infer the evolution of stars, of galaxies, and of the universe itself.|$|E

5|$|Sometime in the Carboniferous Period, some 350 {{million years}} <b>ago,</b> <b>when</b> {{there were only}} two major land masses, insects began flying. How and why insect wings developed, however, is not well understood, largely due to the {{scarcity}} of appropriate fossils from the period of their development in the Lower Carboniferous. Three main theories on the origins of insect flight are that wings developed from paranotal lobes, extensions of the thoracic terga; that they are modifications of movable abdominal gills as found on aquatic naiads of mayflies; or that they developed from thoracic protrusions used as radiators.|$|E
5|$|The King Island emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae minor) is an extinct {{subspecies}} of emu {{that was}} endemic to King Island, which {{is situated in}} the Bass Strait between mainland Australia and Tasmania. Its closest relative may be the extinct Tasmanian emu (D. n. diemenensis), as they belonged to a single population until less than 14,000 years <b>ago,</b> <b>when</b> Tasmania and King Island were still connected. The small size of the King Island emu may {{be an example of}} insular dwarfism.|$|E
5|$|The Penokean Mountain Range {{formed in}} the Penokean orogeny 1880 to 1830 million years <b>ago,</b> <b>when</b> an oceanic island arc called the Pembine–Wausau terrane {{collided}} with the southern margin of the Superior craton. From 1880 to 1850 million years ago, the region was volcanically active. This volcanism ceased 1850 million years <b>ago</b> <b>when</b> a fragment of Archean crust arrived from the South at the subduction zone. Collision of this Archean crust in the south with the Superior craton in the North caused a period of intense crustal shortening. Rocks of the Pembine–Wassau terrane were thrust up over and onto the Superior craton, forming a mountain range that covered all but the northernmost portion of Lake Superior, crossed parts of three US states (south-central Minnesota, northern Wisconsin, and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan), and continued to the southernmost tip of Ontario, Canada. Loading of the lithosphere by these thrust sheets caused it to flex downwards, forming a foreland basin at around 1850 million {{years ago in the}} south and 1835 million years ago in the north. The Rove Formation was deposited in the northern basin. In the southern basin, crustal thickening caused high-grade metamorphism of the sedimentary fill by 1830 million years ago. A series of post-orogenic plutons intruded into the overlying rocks 1830 million years ago,; these plutons mark the end of the Penokean orogeny.|$|E
