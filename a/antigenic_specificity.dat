40|$|Eight antigens of 7 S γ 2 -immunoglobulins {{controlled}} by alleles {{at a single}} locus Ig- 1, {{have been identified in}} mice. This locus has previously been shown to determine <b>antigenic</b> <b>specificities</b> on the F fragments of 7 S γ 2 a-globulins. The reactions of these antigens with various isoantisera have shown that the antigens all cross react with one another. New methods for the analysis of <b>antigenic</b> <b>specificities</b> of soluble proteins are presented in detail. A sensitive method for detecting in the order of 0. 01 µg of these isoantigens has been developed, based on the quantitative inhibition of precipitation of I 125 -labeled antigen. Cross-reactions of the antigens were analysed in inhibition assays and the data is compatible with the existence of a minimum of eight <b>antigenic</b> <b>specificities.</b> Each of the antigens is composed of different combinations of these specificities, with only one antigen having a specificity not present in any other.

40|$|Background: The {{clinical}} {{relevance of}} anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) in inflammatory bowel diseases is unclear. Definition of their <b>antigenic</b> <b>specificities</b> may improve their diagnostic significance. Methods: We studied the target antigens of ANCA in 96 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 112 patients with Crohn disease (CD) by indirect immunofluorescence, antigen-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and immunodetection on Western blot. We related {{the presence of}} antibodies of defined specificity to clinical symptoms. Results: By indirect immunofluorescence, ANCA were present in 58 % of UC patients and in 21 % of CD patients. Major antigens were catalase, alpha-enolase, and lactoferrin. In UC, ANCA titers correlated with disease activity. In CD, both ANCA, by indirect immunofluorescence, and antibodies to lactoferrin were associated with colonic localization of the disease. Neither ANCA, by indirect immunofluorescence, nor antibodies of defined specificity were associated with duration of disease, use of medication, or a history of bowel resection. Conclusions: ANCA are useful as markers for UC and colonic localization in CD.

IgA antibody titres peaked for both <b>antigenic</b> <b>specificities</b> 2 weeks after the first dose of vaccine. 82 ± 7 % of anti-Vibrio cholerae and 72 ± 17 % of anti-Salmonella typhi IgA were in the polymeric form. These serum pIgA antibodies were mainly dimeric IgA, not complexed with the secretory component. They disappeared more rapidly from serum than mIgA antibodies. Anti-V. cholerae IgA responses were parallel in serum and milk samples, whereas anti-S. typhi responses were dissociated. In milk, IgA antibodies were secretory IgA for both <b>antigenic</b> <b>specificities,</b> being probably of local origin in the mammary gland. Our results indicate that both oral and parenteral vaccinations can induce pIgA antibodies in serum and secretions, confirming that the presence of pIgA in serum does not necessarily reflect an immune stimulation only at the mucosal level.

50|$|Alfred Nisonoff was {{introduced}} to the subject of antibodies while studying at the Roswell Park Memorial Institute in Buffalo with a man named David Pressman. David Pressman was working in one of Linus Pauling’s groups exploring the <b>antigenic</b> <b>specificity</b> of antibodies against haptenic determinants. This research took advantage of the technique of quantitative hapten inhibition, originally developed by Karl Landsteiner. While conducting these experiments in Pressman’s lab, Nisonoff contributed to an important paper explaining an idea that eventually led to important conclusions about the structure of the antibody molecule. In this early paper he demonstrated that the antibody molecule has two combining sites with the same specificity for an antigenic determinant. This helped to disprove the “instructional theories” of antibody formation.|$|E
50|$|The {{lipopolysaccharide}} (LPS) {{core region}} of P. penneri strains contains higher structural variability than that observed in other representatives of Enterobacteriaceae. These differences {{have been used}} to cluster P. penneri strains into serogroups based on their agglutinating activity when mixed with antibodies directed against specific species of LPS molecules. Presently, 15 O-serogroups have been proposed for P. penneri based on the chemical structure of the O-specific polysaccharide chain (O-antigen) of the lipopolysaccharide. Certain LPS epitopes have been examined to determine their function in <b>antigenic</b> <b>specificity.</b> The particular groups on the oligosaccharides found to play a dominant role in the specificity of P. penneri LPS are the amide of D-galacturonic acid with L-lysine α-D-GalA-(L-Lys) (and the amide of D-galacturonic acid with L-threonine α-D-GalA- L-Thr), respectively.|$|E

40|$|The formal {{genetics}} of immunoglobulins {{has been developed}} primarily {{through the use of}} markers that have been assigned to the constant parts of the immunoglobulin molecules (IgCL and IgCH). However, the functional antigen-binding parts of the immunoglobulins are located on the variable-region (V-region) 1 segments of the molecule and are controlled by a much larger number of IgVL and IgV ~ genes. Genetic analysis of V-region related functions is complicated by the vast numbers of different types of immunoglobulin molecules. Progress, however, has been made in this area by the use of homogeneous antibodies (1 - 5) or myeloma proteins that have known haptenbinding specificities (6 - 10). Here is has been possible to retrieve a specific functional group of immunoglobulins by their ability to bind the specific antigen. Further, the availability of homogeneous immunoglobulins in sufficient quantity has permitted both structural and antigenic studies.
