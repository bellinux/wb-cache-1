5|$|An {{example of}} a {{processed}} pizza cheese is Provel, which uses Cheddar, Swiss, and Provolone cheeses as flavorants. Some analogue types <b>are</b> <b>made</b> <b>with</b> casein, a by-product of milk, and vegetable oil, rather than milk fat. Casein-based Mozzarella-like imitation processed cheeses prepared using rennet are also used as a Mozzarella substitute on frozen pizzas.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, small privately owned dairies began to produce {{handmade}} cheeses from goat and sheep’s milk {{as well as}} cow’s milk, resembling traditional cheeses like those made in rural France, Spain and Italy. Many <b>are</b> <b>made</b> <b>with</b> organic milk. These are now also produced by kibbutzim and the national Tnuva dairy.|$|E

5|$|A large {{variety of}} {{eggplant}} salads and dips <b>are</b> <b>made</b> <b>with</b> roasted eggplants. Baba ghanoush, called salat ḥatzilim in Israel, {{is made with}} tahina and other seasonings such as garlic, lemon juice, onions, herbs and spices. The eggplant is sometimes grilled over an open flame so that the pulp has a smoky taste. A particularly Israeli variation of the salad is made with mayonnaise called salat ḥatzilim b'mayonnaise. Eggplant salads are also made with yogurt, or with feta cheese, chopped onion and tomato, or {{in the style of}} Romanian Jews, with roasted red pepper.|$|E
5|$|Chardonnay {{is a major}} white grape, used in the Vin de Pays d'Oc and the {{sparkling}} Crémant de Limoux.

In the Muscat de Rivesaltes AOC, fortified wines are made from Muscat of Alexandria grapes.|$|E
5|$|Modern steels <b>are</b> <b>made</b> <b>with</b> varying {{combinations}} of alloy metals to fulfill many purposes. Carbon steel, composed simply {{of iron and}} carbon, accounts for 90% of steel production. Low alloy steel is alloyed with other elements, usually molybdenum, manganese, chromium, or nickel, in amounts of up to 10% by weight to improve the hardenability of thick sections. High strength low alloy steel has small additions (usually < 2% by weight) of other elements, typically 1.5% manganese, to provide additional strength for a modest price increase.|$|E

5|$|Silver is very {{important}} in electronics for conductors and electrodes on account of its high electrical conductivity even when tarnished. Bulk silver and silver foils were used to make vacuum tubes, and continue to be used today in the manufacture of semiconductor devices, circuits, and their components. For example, silver is used in high quality connectors for RF, VHF, and higher frequencies, particularly in tuned circuits such as cavity filters where conductors cannot be scaled by more than 6%. Printed circuits and RFID antennas <b>are</b> <b>made</b> <b>with</b> silver paints, Powdered silver and its alloys are used in paste preparations for conductor layers and electrodes, ceramic capacitors, and other ceramic components.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} solo flights glider pilots are {{required}} to stay within gliding range of their home airfield. In addition to solo flying, further flights <b>are</b> <b>made</b> <b>with</b> an instructor until the student is capable of taking a glider cross-country and of handling more difficult weather. Cross-country flights are allowed when they have sufficient experience to find sources of lift away from their home airfield, to navigate, and to select and land in a field if necessary. In most countries pilots must take a written examination on the regulations, navigation, use of the radio, weather, principles of flight and human factors. Proposals are being made to standardise the training requirements across European countries.|$|E

5|$|Argon-helium {{mixtures}} {{are also}} frequently utilized in GTAW, since they can increase {{control of the}} heat input while maintaining the benefits of using argon. Normally, the mixtures <b>are</b> <b>made</b> <b>with</b> primarily helium (often about 75% or higher) and a balance of argon. These mixtures increase the speed {{and quality of the}} AC welding of aluminum, and also make it easier to strike an arc. Another shielding gas mixture, argon-hydrogen, is used in the mechanized welding of light gauge stainless steel, but because hydrogen can cause porosity, its uses are limited. Similarly, nitrogen can sometimes be added to argon to help stabilize the austenite in austenitic stainless steels and increase penetration when welding copper. Due to porosity problems in ferritic steels and limited benefits, however, it is not a popular shielding gas additive.|$|E
5|$|As {{a medical}} garment, metal corsets endured {{well into the}} 20th century. The Mexican painter Frida Kahlo was a notable wearer of such medical corsets, {{following}} ongoing problems {{as a result of}} a serious road crash she experienced as a teenager. By 1944, Kahlo's doctors had recommended that she wear a steel corset instead of the plaster ones she had mainly worn since the accident; and Kahlo, whose paintings were heavily autobiographical, used the new corset as the basis for one of her best known self-portraits, The Broken Column. In the painting, Kahlo portrays herself weeping with agony, her torso split open revealing that her spine is a crumbling Ionic column, and her damaged body held together by the steel corset. A form of metal corset or orthopaedic brace used in the second half of the 20th century is called a Harris brace after its inventor, R.I. Harris. Harris braces are designed to immobilise the waist whilst healing, and <b>are</b> <b>made</b> <b>with</b> two bendable metal bands worn above and below the waist, and connected with rigid metal supports.|$|E
5|$|Similar to its predecessor, Watch Dogs 2 is an action-adventure {{game with}} stealth {{elements}} and played from a third-person perspective as protagonist Marcus Holloway, a young hacker, the game features an open world environment {{set in a}} fictionalized version of the San Francisco Bay Area, an area {{more than twice as}} large as the Chicago setting from Watch Dogs. The Bay Area consists of four different areas: San Francisco, Oakland, Marin, and Silicon Valley, all of which have different characteristics and aesthetics. Players can navigate the game's world on-foot or by the various vehicles featured in the game, such as cars, trucks, buses, cable cars, motorcycles, quad bikes and boats. The driving mechanic was overhauled and designed to be more accessible. The players can shoot their weapons while driving. Marcus also has improved acrobatic skills, and the ability to parkour around the city. Players can use different methods to approach the game's missions, choosing between the aggressive approach, in which they defeat enemies with guns which <b>are</b> <b>made</b> <b>with</b> a 3D printer; explosives, like mines; or Marcus' own melee weapon, a billiard ball attached to a bungee cord. Alternatively, players can use the stealth approach, in which they can evade enemies or paralyze them temporarily with Marcus' taser. Players can also complete the game through hacking alone. When players commit too many crimes, the police officers will become alerted and will attempt to arrest the player. The game upgrades system is a returning feature, with items being divided into three categories: Ghost, Aggressor, and Trickster. Players can choose their upgrades in accordance with their own playstyle.|$|E
