40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a detailed characterization of a five-cell DMFC stack, obtained using a cubic experimental plan that was derived from design of experiments (DOE) methods. The results show that the operational behavior of a DMFC stack is mainly influenced by three independent input variables. Therefore four dimensional regression models were plotted against the input variables of temperature, electrical current density and the <b>anode</b> <b>circuit's</b> methanol concentration. The terms of these models were generated for the technically relevant operating range by applying a response surface methodology (RSM). The generated models constitute a suitable starting point for follow-up modeling work of complete DMFC systems. The detailed characterization of a DMFC stack with mathematical models as an output is not available in the literature, so a data base for DMFC modeling can be provided to the scientific community. Additionally an application-oriented method for the characterization of DMFC stacks is described, which is an important tool for simulation-based development of DMFC stacks and systems...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Microbial {{fuel cells}} (MFCs) rely on {{electrochemically}} active bacteria {{to capture the}} chemical energy contained in organics and convert it to electrical energy. Bacteria develop biofilms on the MFC electrodes, allowing considerable conversion capacity and opportunities for extracellular electron transfer (EET). The present knowledge on EET is centred around two Gram-negative models, i. e. Shewanella and Geobacter species, as {{it is believed that}} Gram-positives cannot perform EET by themselves as the Gram-negatives can. To understand how bacteria form biofilms within MFCs and how their development, structure and viability affects electron transfer, we performed pure and co-culture experiments. Results Biofilm viability was maintained highest nearer the <b>anode</b> during closed <b>circuit</b> operation (current flowing), in contrast to when the anode was in open circuit (soluble electron acceptor) where viability was highest on top of the biofilm, furthest from the <b>anode.</b> Closed <b>circuit</b> <b>anode</b> Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms were considerably thinner compared to the open <b>circuit</b> <b>anode</b> (30 ± 3 μm and 42 ± 3 μm respectively), which is likely due to the higher energetic gain of soluble electron acceptors used. The two Gram-positive bacteria used only provided a fraction of current produced by the Gram-negative organisms. Power output of co-cultures Gram-positive Enterococcus faecium and either Gram-negative organisms, increased by 30 - 70 % relative to the single cultures. Over time the co-culture biofilms segregated, in particular, Pseudomonas aeruginosa creating towers piercing through a thin, uniform layer of Enterococcus faecium. P. aeruginosa and E. faecium together generated a current of 1. 8 ± 0. 4 mA while alone they produced 0. 9 ± 0. 01 and 0. 2 ± 0. 05 mA respectively. Conclusion We postulate that this segregation may be an essential difference in strategy for electron transfer and substrate capture between the Gram-negative and the Gram-positive bacteria used here. </p...|$|R

50|$|In 1918, Edwin Armstrong {{used only}} triodes when he invented the {{superheterodyne}} receiver. One triode operated {{in a conventional}} oscillator circuit.

50|$|A Single Ended Push-Pull (SEPP, SRPP or mu-follower) output stage, {{originally}} {{called the}} Series-Balanced amplifier (US patent 2,310,342, Feb 1943). {{is similar to}} a totem-pole arrangement for transistors in that two devices are in series between the power supply rails, but the input drive goes only to one of the devices, the bottom one of the pair; hence the (seemingly contradictory) Single-Ended description. The output is taken from the cathode of the top (not directly driven) device, which acts part way between a constant current source and a cathode follower but receiving some drive from the plate (<b>anode)</b> <b>circuit</b> of the bottom device. The drive to each tube therefore might not be equal, but the circuit tends to keep the current through the bottom device somewhat constant throughout the signal, increasing the power gain and reducing distortion compared with a true single-tube single-ended output stage.|$|E
50|$|This type of tetrode was {{developed}} to correct deficiencies in the triode tube which became apparent when {{attempts were made to}} use triodes as small-signal radio-frequency amplifiers. In the triode, the control grid was next to the plate. Capacitance between these two electrodes caused instability and oscillation when both anode and grid were connected into tuned resonant circuits, {{as was the case in}} early radios, or in any application where the <b>anode</b> <b>circuit</b> presented an inductive reactive load to the valve. Oscillation could only be avoided by using very small stage gain at frequencies above about 100 kHz, and at frequencies above 1 MHz, triodes are virtually useless in tuned amplifiers in which both anode and grid circuits are tuned to the same frequency. A second advantage of the tetrode, which also arose from reduced anode-grid capacitance, was that, when the anode voltage was in a certain range, changing its value had much less effect on the anode current than was the case with triodes. This corresponds to an increased anode slope resistance, and allowed much higher voltage gain by permitting a larger external load resistance. At the time of the introduction of screen-grid valves (around 1927) a typical small triode used for small-signal amplification had an anode slope resistance of 20kOhms or less, and a grid-anode capacitance of 1 to 5pF, while the corresponding figures for a typical screen grid valve were 1MOhm and 0.004pF - in some cases much less capacitance.|$|E

40|$|The Pseudo Two Dimensional (P 2 D) porous {{electrode}} model is less preferred for real time calculations {{due to the}} high computational expense and complexity in obtaining {{the wide range of}} electro-chemical parameters despite of its superior accuracy.

The re-parametrisation is achieved by solving a quadratic form of the Butler-Volmer equation and modifying the <b>anode</b> open <b>circuit</b> voltage based on experimental values. Thus the only experimental result, needed to re-parametrise the cell, reduces to the measurement of discharge voltage for any C-rate. The proposed method is validated against the 1 C discharge data and an actual drive cycle of a NCR 18650 BD battery with NCA chemistry when driving in an urban environment with frequent accelerations and regenerative braking events.

5000|$|The anode {{characteristic}} of a screen-grid valve is thus quite unlike that of a triode. It includes a range of anode voltages, where the anode voltage is {{less than that of}} the screen grid, {{in which there is a}} distinctive negative resistance characteristic, sometimes called [...] "tetrode kink". This is usually undesirable, although it can be exploited as in the dynatron oscillator (Eastman, p 431). The approximately constant-current region of low slope at high anode voltage is also a distinctive characteristic of the tetrode. This is highly desirable, since it corresponds to a high source resistance in the <b>anode</b> <b>circuit,</b> and greatly enhances the voltage gain which the device can produce. Early screen-grid valves had amplification factors (i.e. the product of transconductance and anode slope resistance) ten times that of comparable small-signal triodes. [...] The high anode resistance (i.e. low slope) in the normal operating range is a consequence of the electrostatic shielding action of the screen grid, since it prevents the electric field due to the anode from penetrating to the control grid region, where it might otherwise influence the passage of electrons, increasing the electron current when the anode voltage is high, reducing it when low.In practice the negative-resistance kink of the {{anode characteristic}} limits the usefulness of the screen-grid valve to applications where only small signals are amplified, so that the variations in anode voltage are also correspondingly small, and the operating conditions never depart from the region of high positive impedance (low positive slope) at large anode voltage. The secondary emission can be prevented from contributing to the screen current (and thus detracting from the anode current) by adding a suppressor grid, making a pentode, or beam plates to make a beam tetrode/kinkless tetrode, which can be used in power amplifiers where the variations of anode voltage, due to the presence of a large signal voltage, are much greater. The anode characteristics of these tubes are very similar to pentodes. In both cases the anode current rises rapidly to an approximately constant value when the anode voltage rises to as little as a few tens of volts, and the region of high positive anode resistance (low slope) extends from this low value up to the maximum anode voltage which could be several hundred volts or more.|$|E

The beam load is up to 150 kW for the RFQ and up to 750 kW for the two drift tube tanks. An additional 36 MHz debuncher in the transfer line to the Synchrotron (SIS) will need 120 kW pulse power.

Tantalum oxide films prepared by anodic reactions in aqueous and nonaqueous electrolytes have been shown to contain impurities from the solution (1 - 3). Anodic oxide films prepared in an oxygen discharge (4 - 7) have been found to exhibit physical and elec-trical properties analogous to those found with films formed in l iquid electrolytes. Certain aspects of the growth of films by anodization in liquid electrolytes are similar to those observed during gas phase anodi-zation.

The energy flux {{due to the}} electron current {{is found to be}} the dominant mechanism. The net energy transfer to an anode is far noticeable to a cathode. Therefore a considerable effort has expended in attempt to achieve a good understanding of the anode-phenomena. The longitudinally segmented nozzle anode was used to examine the anode phenomena. This anode was composed of the mutually insulated four sections. Each segmented anode current was measured by the ammeter which was set in the individual <b>anode</b> <b>circuit,</b> and its waveform was observed by dual beam synchroscope. At the same time another synchroscope was used to examine the waveform of the arc voltage. In case of the total arc current being 10 amp., the arc current was concentrated at a downstream end of the anode throat. Its arc turminus fixed there steadily and its attachment area was small. It was shown that, increasing with the total arc current, the segmented anode current distribution shifts gradually its peak value to the upstream segments of the anode nozzle. For the arc current from 15 to 45 amp., the anode spot moved swiftly {{in the form of the}} restrike mode. The mean velocity of anode arc turminus which was determined from electrical measurement was of the order of 20 ? 150 m/sec. As the gas flow rate a increased, its velocity getting faster. Over 50 amp. the steady mode prevailed again, but the anode arc turminus expanded in its size and moved up to the adjacent upstream segments. In case the total current less than 45 amp. segmented anode current distribution was independent of the argon gas flow rate. When the total arc current increased over 50 amp., the influence of the gas flow rate became considerable, and with increasing the gas flow rate the segmented anode current distribution drifted to the downstream.

True space weather forecasting models require assimilation of space-based in situ data into physics-based models. Data collection of fundamental characteristics, such as plasma density and temperature, neutral wind and bulk ion velocity, and electric and magnetic field strengths is required at multiple grid points, similar to tropospheric weather stations that measure temperature, wind speed, humidity, etc. Recent breakthroughs in fabrication techniques have enabled the development of a suite of instruments that is comprised of 16 individual analyzers, each of which is capable of providing a unique measurement of a partially ionized space environment. The suite is designed to measure ion spectra differential in energy and angle, bulk ion velocities, bulk neutral velocities, and ion and neutral mass spectra.

A significant removal of naphthalene and 2 -methylnaphthalene was observed at early stages of incubation in all treatments and was attributed to their high volatility. In the case of phenanthrene, a significant removal (93. 83  ±  1. 68 %) was measured in the closed circuit SMFCs with the anode acting as the main TEA and under combined anode and sulfate reduction conditions (88. 51  ±  1. 3 %).

40|$|Operation {{of thermal}} spray zinc (Zn) anodes for {{cathodic}} protection (CP) of reinforced concrete structures {{was investigated in}} laboratory and field studies conducted by the Albany Research Center (ARC) {{in collaboration with the}} Oregon Department of Transportation. The purposes of the research presented in this report were: evaluate the need for preheating concrete to improve the adhesion of the anode; estimate the service life of thermal spray Zn CP anodes; determine the optimum thickness for Zn CP anodes; characterize the anode-concrete interfacial chemistry; and correlate field and laboratory results. Laboratory studies involved accelerated electrochemical aging of thermal sprayed Zn anodes on concrete slabs, some of which were periodically wetted while others were unwetted. Concrete used in the slabs contained either 1. 2 or 3 kg NaCl /m 3 (2 or 5 lbs NaCl /yd 3) as part of the concrete mix design. The Zn anodes were applied to the slabs using the twin wire arc-spray technique. Half of the slabs were preheated to 120 - 160 C (250 - 320 F) to improve the initial Zn anode bond strength and the other half were not. Accelerated aging was done at a current density of 0. 032 A/m 2 (3 mA/ft 2), 15 times that used on Oregon DOT Coastal bridges, i. e,. 0. 0022 A/m 2 (0. 2 mA/ft 2) Cores from the Cape Creek Bridge (OR), the Richmond San Rafael Bridge (CA), and the East Camino Underpass (CA) were used to study the anode-concrete interfacial chemistry, to relate the chemistry to electrochemical age at the time of sampling, and to compare the chemistry of the field anodes to the chemistry of anodes from the laboratory studies. Cores from a CALTRANS study of a silane sealant used prior to the application of the Zn anodes and cores with galvanized rebar from the Longbird Bridge (Bermuda) were also studied. Aged laboratory and field anodes were characterized by measuring {{some or all of the}} following parameters: thickness, bond strength, anode-concrete interfacial chemistry, bulk chemistry, <b>anode</b> resistance, <b>circuit</b> resistance, electrochemical age, and air and water permeability. Models are presented for the operation of periodically-wetted and unwetted thermal spray Zn anodes from the initial energizing of the anode to the end of its service life. The models were developed in terms of bond strength, circuit resistance, anode-concrete interfacial chemistry, electrochemical age, and anode condition. The most significant results of the research are: (1) preheating concrete surfaces prior to coating with Zn is unnecessary; (2) anodes generally fail due to loss of bond strength rather than Zn consumption; (3) Unwetted anodes fail more quickly than periodically-wetted anodes; (4) 0. 47 - 0. 60 mm (12 - 15 mil) anode thickness is adequate for most Oregon DOT coastal impressed current CP (ICCP) installations; (5) based on bond strength, thermal spray Zn ICCP anode service life is approximately 27 years at 0. 0022 A/m 2 (0. 2 mA/ft 2); (6) anode reaction products alter the anode-concrete interface by rejecting Ca from the cement paste, by replacing it with Zn, and by the accumulation of a Zn mineral layer that includes chloride and sulfur compounds; (7) CP system circuit resistance provides an effective means for monitoring the condition of Zn ICCP anodes as they age...|$|R

3000|$|This review {{tended to}} {{disclose}} unsolved mysteries of electron transfer phenomena for biomass energy applications with sustainability. Faced with increasingly scarce {{supply of energy}} and resources and gradually serious threats of ecological deprivation around the globe, top governing bodies of various nations have pushed forward with efforts for environmental decontamination and materials/energy renewability of the vulnerable ecology. That is, with strict measures for energy conservation and emission reduction, environmental/ecological protection/prevention and materials/energy recycling/reuses are of great importance to this resource-limited world. Making use of innovative features and environmental benefits of sustainable biomass energy extraction for applications would be inevitable. As a matter of fact, microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are bioelectrochemical devices that use electroactive microbes and mimicked bacterial interactions as biocatalysts to drive current of bioenergy from oxidation of organics for bioelectricity generation and wastewater treatment (Logan et al. 2006; Ren et al. 2012; Pant et al. 2010; Rabaey and Verstraete 2005; Rozendal et al. 2008, 2009). MFCs apparently would be promising platform to evaluate feasibility of bioresources for biorefinery/bioenergy practicability. At ambient temperature, anodic bacteria oxidize organic matter with direct current production for CO 2 production and pollutant decontamination. Meanwhile, protons migrated through separation of an ion exchange membrane (e.g., proton exchange membrane) toward cathode and electrons went through external circuit to the cathode simultaneously. Then, bioelectricity generation would be taken place at (bio)cathode coupled with water formation (i.e., 1 / 2 O_ 2 + 2 H^ + [...] + 2 e^ - →H_ 2 O). In fact, {{there were at least}} several mechanisms in levels of genomics and proteomics for biofilm formation, direct electron transfer, mediator electron transport, and direct interspecies electron transfer dealing with performance of power generation in MFCs (Kumar et al. 2016). Regarding (bio)cathode, selecting appropriate electron acceptor could significantly attenuate the potential loss present on the cathode, effectively augmenting power generation in MFCs (He et al. 2015). Moreover, comparative assessment upon various electron acceptors popularly used in MFCs was also identified. As biocatalysts, exoelectrogenic bacteria are capable to directly transport electrons from extracellular media that enable bacterial cells function in an MFC. Therefore, the electrons produced by oxidation via microbial metabolism are transported through the barriers of biofilm-and-liquid interface, anodic immobilized cells, and solid <b>anode,</b> external <b>circuit</b> to the cathode for effective power generation or further applications (Mohan et al. 2014; ElMekawy et al. 2014). To overcome interphase electron transfer resistance and significantly augment electron flux across the boundary layer on the anodic surface, effective concentrations of biologically secreted or artificially synthesized exogenous mediators (e.g., flavins, pyocyanin, gallic acid and aminophenol, decolorized amines, polyphenolics; Chen et al. 2017 a, b; Qin et al. 2016) in extracellular broth media and redox-active complexes (e.g., C type cytochrome) across the outer membrane of microorganisms apparently play crucial roles to attenuate electron transfer resistance across different media interfaces or phases for effective power generation. Exogenous mediators as “electrochemical catalysts” could shuttle electrons to the electrode surface or to electron acceptors or donors if appropriate environmental conditions were provided (e.g., suitable pHs, redox potentials; Chen et al. 2017 a). In particular, with assistance of electron shuttles (e.g., o- and p-aminophenol, humic acid, methyl viologen, neutral red), electron transfer from electrochemically inactive bacteria (e.g., Escherichia coli) to the electrode might be effectively facilitated to be mediator MFCs. In contrast, due to self-secreted ESs (e.g., riboflavin, pyocyanin), electrochemically active bacteria—inoculated microbial communities could be successfully acclimatized as anodophilic consortia to transfer electrons to the cathode in mediator-free environments. That is, appropriate exogenous supplementation or intracellular accumulation of redox mediators all could significantly increase fluxes of electron transfer to simultaneously augment reductive degradation and bioelectricity generation. That is, electron shuttles might somehow still act as catalytic center of mediating electric current in electroactive bacteria-bearing MFCs.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2010 Presentation date: 2009 - 08 - 18 The main {{objective}} of the research {{is to develop a}} prototype device that can determine the condition of the thermally sprayed zinc anode in cathodic protection systems. The device needs to meet the following requirements: applicability in the field, non-destructiveness or minimal destructiveness of the zinc anode, ease of use with little to no technical background, and the ability to determine anode condition. Two different technologies, ultrasound and resistance/permeability, were explored to examine their prospective in determining the localized anode condition. Ultrasound testing was performed on three different sets of samples. Analysis using time-of-flight was able to determine the thicknesses of the zinc sheet samples. Calculated thicknesses were essentially identical to the nominal thicknesses. Similar analysis resulted in negative results when applied to electrochemically aged and unaged samples. It is believed that the ultrasonic waves are being scattered by the roughness at the zinc/concrete interface or, perhaps, in the bulk of the thermally sprayed zinc. An alternative ultrasonic configuration using surface (Lamb) waves is recommended for future studies. Cyclic voltammetry was used to measure the resistance of the electrochemically aged samples. Dry resistance measurements were performed on five different electrochemically aged blocks. It was determined that the average resistance of the blocks increased rapidly up to approximately 5 bridge years, which corresponds, generally, to the maximum bond strength, and then gradually increased or leveled off. Individual resistance data was seen to vary with time, but changes were consistent from block to block. The resistance is shown to be inversely related to temperature and believed to be affected by environmental factors. Open circuit potential showed less variation with time when compared to the resistance measurements. Using a three electrode configuration, the potential of Zn generally tracked the resistance and bond strength measurements, while the potential of Fe increased with age. No dynamic changes in resistance were noticed with the addition of water. It is believed that the water was impeded due to lack of permeability in the samples. A noticeable decrease in resistance was observed when the water had a path to the zinc/concrete interface, either by a pin hole or bare concrete adjacent to the zinc. It is recommended that a simple field test be developed to monitor the response of a CP system for an applied voltage as a zone is sprayed with water, and that such a test may be aided by systematic creation of pin holes in the thermally sprayed zinc anode. It is therefore, recommended, that the created pin holes be studied in an accelerated aging environment. Preliminary data from this study suggest that not only will the creation of pin holes assist characterization of anode condition through electrical response, but may increase the service life of the zinc <b>anode</b> by decreasing <b>circuit</b> resistance of the electrochemical cell...|$|R
