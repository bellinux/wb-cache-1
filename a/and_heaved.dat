5|$|On {{the third}} afternoon, Johnson {{came to the}} crease at 5/294 in Australia's first innings when Harvey {{departed}} for 112, but he made only 10 before falling at 6/329. Lindwall replaced him and made 77 as Australia's tail pushed the score to 458 on the fourth morning, reducing the deficit to 38. In the second innings, the English batsmen continued to attack Johnson. Given Johnson's lack of economy in the first innings, Bradman declined to use him for {{the entirety of the}} first session of the fourth day. When Johnson was introduced after lunch, he was targeted, and Washbrook and Hutton both lofted him for sixes in quick succession, prompting Bradman to remove him from the attack. When Johnson returned, Hutton again hit him in the air, but this time Bradman took a running catch to dismiss the batsman for 57, leaving England at 2/129. Edrich and Compton came in and were initially pinned down, but after 45 minutes, Compton charged Johnson <b>and</b> <b>heaved</b> a delivery to the leg side for a boundary. Bradman promptly took the new ball as England reached 2/209 at tea. After the break, England continued to target Johnson. Edrich hit Johnson for three consecutive fours before lofting a fourth into the crowd for six. Compton took risks against Johnson, successfully cutting against the spin several times, and Bradman was forced to use a well-spread field to cut down the fast scoring off Johnson. England reached 2/232 before collapsing to be 8/362 {{at the end of the}} day, but Johnson was not responsible for any of these wickets.|$|E
25|$|Lehman's {{classification}} {{was developed}} by Abraham Gottlob Werner who thought that rock strata had been deposited from a primeval global ocean rather than by Noah's Flood, a doctrine called Neptunism. The idea of a young Earth was further undermined in 1774 by Nicolas Desmarest, whose studies of a succession of extinct volcanoes in Europe showed layers which would have taken long ages to build up. The fact that these layers were still intact indicated that any later Flood had been local rather than universal. Against Neptunism, James Hutton proposed an indefinitely old cycle of eroded rocks being deposited in the sea, consolidated <b>and</b> <b>heaved</b> up by volcanic forces into mountains which in turn eroded, all in natural processes which continue to operate.|$|E
500|$|A scuffle {{broke out}} {{when a woman}} in {{handcuffs}} was escorted from {{the door of the}} bar to the waiting police wagon several times. She escaped repeatedly and fought with four of the police, swearing and shouting, for about ten minutes. Described as [...] "a typical New York butch" [...] and [...] "a dyke–stone butch", she had been hit on the head by an officer with a baton for, as one witness claimed, complaining that her handcuffs were too tight. Bystanders recalled that the woman, whose identity remains unknown (Stormé DeLarverie has been identified by some, including herself, as the woman, but accounts vary), sparked the crowd to fight when she looked at bystanders and shouted, [...] "Why don't you guys do something?" [...] After an officer picked her up <b>and</b> <b>heaved</b> her {{into the back of the}} wagon, the crowd became a mob and went [...] "berserk": [...] "It was at that moment that the scene became explosive." ...|$|E

2500|$|Kidd {{killed one}} of his own crewmen on 30 October 1697. Kidd's gunner William Moore was on deck {{sharpening}} a chisel when a Dutch ship appeared. Moore urged Kidd to attack the Dutchman, an act not only piratical but also certain to anger Dutch-born King William. Kidd refused, calling Moore a lousy dog. Moore retorted, [...] "If I am a lousy dog, you have made me so; you have brought me to ruin and many more." [...] Kidd snatched up <b>and</b> <b>heaved</b> an ironbound bucket at Moore. Moore fell to the deck with a fractured skull and died the following day.|$|E
2500|$|Taking a snap {{from his}} own 6-yard line, Aikman dropped back into his own end zone <b>and</b> <b>heaved</b> a deep pass to Alvin Harper at midfield. [...] Harper took off past {{defensive}} backs George Teague and Terrell Buckley, made the catch, and raced {{all the way to}} the end zone, breaking a tackle attempt by Teague at the 14 on the way to a 94-yard touchdown reception. [...] Harper's score gave the Cowboys a 14-3 lead and set an NFL playoff record for the longest play from scrimmage, breaking the old record (93 yards) set by Daryle Lamonica to Elbert Dubenion in the 1963 AFL postseason.|$|E
2500|$|The first shells passed {{overhead}} and the mines were fired at [...] on 27 March, it [...] "appeared as if a long village was being lifted through flames into the air" [...] and [...] "there was an earth shake but no roar of explosion".

2500|$|The Patriots (18–0) {{entered the}} Super Bowl undefeated and were 12 point {{favorites}} going into game weekend. The Giants defeated the Patriots 17–14 in Super Bowl XLII, {{aided by the}} famous [...] "Manning to Tyree" [...] pass. On this famous play, Manning escaped the grip of several Patriots defensive linemen, {{stepped up in the}} pocket, <b>and</b> <b>heaved</b> the ball {{down the middle of the}} field to a double covered David Tyree. With Rodney Harrison, a Patriots defensive back, all over Tyree, David managed to hold on to the ball by holding it on his helmet until he fell to the ground. This catch set up a Manning to Plaxico Burress touchdown pass in the back of the end zone to put the Giants in the lead. It was the third biggest upset by betting line in Super Bowl history (the Baltimore Colts were favored by 17 over the New York Jets in Super Bowl III, and the St. Louis Rams were favored by 14 over the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XXXVI). Co-owner John Mara described it as [...] "the greatest victory in the history of this franchise, without question".|$|E
2500|$|Peter May won the toss for {{the third}} time in a row and again decided to bat {{regardless}} of the ill-omens as the wicket looked easy going and was expected to take spin. Stonewaller Trevor Bailey who had been promoted in the batting order from 6 to 3, then 2 and was now asked to go in first with Arthur Milton. They were both out for 8 to Ian Meckiff and Alan Davidson and England were 23/2. Once again the England opening partnership had failed and Bailey, a considerable stumbling block for the bowlers down the order had been sacrificed at the top of the order. Tom Graveney (33) and Peter May (42) restored the innings as the fast bowlers found little swing, but Benaud kept them on for over an hour and May edged a ball past Neil Harvey at slip. With the shine taken off the new ball the pacemen were taken off and the spinners brought on, Richie Benaud getting turn almost at once and appealed for leg before wicket against May, but it was turned down. Keith Slater's first Test wicket was May after he had been hit for 4 and 2 and the captain looked in fine form, Slater getting the ball to hang back and it was hit where Benaud had placed Ken Mackay in the covers a few balls before, where he took a fine catch. Graveney edged Benaud just past Harvey which he managed to take for another stunning catch and Dexter was l.b.w. offering no stroke to Slater (2/40) and England were 98/5. The debutant Roy Swetman joined Colin Cowdrey to a great ovation from the 50,000 in the stands and survived a difficult catch to Harvey and another to Colin McDonald who had replaced [...] "The Claw" [...] at leg-slip, both chances off Benaud. The young wicket-keeper used his feet to go down the wicket, so when he padded up he could not given l.b.w., and began to make some runs with Cowdrey stroking the ball through the covers. After tea the vice-captain (34) gave Harvey another catch off Benaud, but Swetman and Tony Lock saw England safely to stumps with 190/6. The next day's start was delayed to past tea because of rain, made worse by the inadequate covering of the infield. When they finally resumed Benaud was spinning the ball more than ever and declined to take the new ball. Lock was out l.b.w. to Mackay, who ended Swetman's fine innings of 41 with another great catch off Benaud. Harvey also accounted for Jim Laker when he knocked the ball up into the air on the first attempt and ran five yards to catch it. Seeing the end was near Fred Trueman scattered the close fielders with a few powerful strokes <b>and</b> <b>heaved</b> the ball into the stands, but he was caught by Burke off Benaud to give the Australian captain 5/83 and England were out for 219. The first day was watched by John Mills and Trevor Howard, who were acting in Australia at the time. Howard compared the England collapse to the final act of the play he was in, saying [...] "Hamlet was never like this".|$|E
