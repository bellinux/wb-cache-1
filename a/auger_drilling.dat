This Bureau of Mines report presents {{a review of the}} most widely used methods to detect and destress high-stress zones along coal faces and an investigation of stress-related bump problems and destressing techniques at a cooperating mine. Geotechnical instrumentation and microseismic methods were used to better understand bump occurrences in underground coal mines.

40|$|Retreat {{pillar mining}} {{concentrates}} stresses on workings directly outby gob areas, which {{can result in}} coal mine bumps. The development of bump-control design criteria by the U. S. Bureau of Mines was furthered by data from a novel bump control mining method at the Olga Mine, McDowell County, WY. The pillar splitting, retreat mining system induced large pillar pressure increases and roof-to-floor con-vergence. Roof-to-floor convergence monitoring {{proved to be a}} valuable tool in evaluating the pillar splitting mining method and localized destressing techniques. Maximum strain energy storage in chain pillars appears to have occurred just prior to the first of four split cuts. At that point a 15 -ft-wide, highly fractured perimeter confined the core of the 55 -by 70 -ft pillars, permitting the pillar core to support tremendous pressures. Splitting the chain pillars into two 17. 5 -by 70 -ft wings removed the confinement load, resulting in pillar yield. Thus, the pillar splitting mining method successfully redistributed the weight of the roof away from the pillar line.

Activities spanned two construction seasons and used both auger and pneumatic percussion drilling methods for pile placement. Pile drilling activities during construction resulted in sound pressure levels (SPL) ranging from 121. 0 to 184. 5 dB re 1 μPa. No {{significant difference was}} found for calculated source SPLs between the Season 1 and Season 2 methods of pile drilling (KW = 2. 28, p = 0. 15).

40|$|Deltaic {{aquifers}} {{are complex}} {{due to the}} important heterogeneity of their structure and their hydrogeological functioning. <b>Auger</b> <b>drilling</b> provides localized, but very robust geological and hydrogeological information, while geophysical surveys can provide integrated subsurface information. An effective, easy-to-use and low-cost methodology combining geological/hydrogeological information from Auger drillings and the results from three geophysical techniques (Electromagnetic mapping, Electrical Sounding and Electrical Resistivity Tomography) is being developed to characterize {{the structure of a}} typical Mediterranean deltaic aquifer. A first hypothesis about hydrodynamic properties of the aquifer is also obtained. The study area is located in the Rhone delta (Middle Camargue/southern France). Integration of geophysical and geological techniques allowed identifying the presence and lateral extension of the Saint-Ferreol paleochannel, the vertical contact between lagoonal-fluvial deposits and the marine clayed silt that separate the superficial aquifer from the deeper aquifer. Likewise, high north-south heterogeneity and east-west homogeneity were highlighted in the study area. Presence of clay in sandy deposits in the low areas implies changes in lateral hydraulic permeability. This fact, jointed to the low hydraulic gradient, suggests a slow groundwater flow in the local system. The Rhone delta presents a typical configuration of a Mediterranean deltaic aquifer, thus this methodological approach can be used for similar deltaic Mediterranean systems...|$|E
40|$|Dual wall reverse {{circulation}} (DWRC) drilling {{was used to}} drill 48 borings during a groundwater contaminant investigation at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant, Paducah, Kentucky. This method was selected {{as an alternative to}} conventional hollow stem <b>auger</b> <b>drilling</b> for a number of reasons, including the expectation of minimizing waste, increasing the drilling rate, and reducing the potential for cross contamination of aquifers. Groundwater samples were collected from several water-bearing zones during drilling of each borehole. The samples were analyzed for volatile organic compounds using a field gas chromatograph. This approach allowed the investigation to be directed using near-real-time data. Use of downhole geophysical logging, in conjunction with lithologic descriptions of borehole cuttings, resulted in excellent correlation of the geology {{in the vicinity of the}} contaminant plume. The total volume of cuttings generated using the DWRC drilling method was less than half of what would have been produced by hollow stem augering; however, the cuttings were recovered in slurry form and had to be dewatered prior to disposal. The drilling rate was very rapid, often approaching 10 ft/min; however, frequent breaks to perform groundwater sampling resulted in an average drilling rate of < 1 ft/min. The time required for groundwater sampling could be shortened by changing the sampling methodology. Analytical results indicated that the drilling method successfully isolated the various water bearing zones and no cross contamination resulted from the investigation...|$|E

40|$|Borehole {{geophysical}} {{techniques can}} be very useful for characterizing the physical and chemical characteristics of sedimentary deposits. A comparison of down-hole gamma-ray response to particle size and geochemistry shows that the down-hole gamma-ray logging technique effectively distinguished between intervals of varying composition at the Ochs Brick and Tile Company (OBT) Springfield clay mine in Brown County, Minnesota. Particle size (grain size) has a first order effect on the gamma activity; {{it is likely that}} mineralogy also is a significant contributor to variations of radioactivity. The naturally occurring radionuclides K, U, and Th in selected drill core samples show that K dominates the total gamma measurements obtained from borehole logging equipment. Consistency of the U and Th activities indicate no significant post-depositional migration of isotopes with the decay series for each nuclide and reflect the average crustal abundance for each. While the collection and laboratory testing of drill hole samples should be attempted whenever possible (especially during property exploration and development), the down-hole gamma-ray probe can provide additional valuable stratigraphic information. Therefore, gamma-ray logs would be especially beneficial where: 1) extensive drill hole sampling is impractical; or 2) the drilling method makes determining stratigraphic position and unit composition difficult or impossible, e. g., <b>auger</b> <b>drilling.</b> However, if gamma-ray logging is to be used extensively during exploration or property development, down-hole sampling should still be done to establish basic relationships between the "typical" gamma-ray profile and the type of material present at the property in question...|$|E

Several ground improvement methods were evaluated and the Rapid Impact Compaction (RIC) method was selected based upon the specific site requirements. The influence depth of RIC is typically around 5 to 6 m (16 to 20 ft) although this is depending on several issues such as soil type, degree of saturation, soil stiffness and other factors. A RIC pilot program was carried out to assess the specifications for the RIC method to achieve the required ground improvement. Based upon the presence of significant amounts of more granular material (e. g. gravel sized sediments), the BPT was selected as the in-situ evaluative tool. The quality control BPT program carried out after completion of the RIC pilot program indicated that the RIC method could meet the requirement for ground improvement with influence depth extending to almost 9 m (30 ft).

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{preliminary results}} {{of research on}} pre-Angkorian canals near the ancient settlement of Angkor Borei in the southern Mekong delta of southern Cambodia. The canals have been mapped by aerial photograph interpretation and investigated in the field by hand <b>auger</b> <b>drilling</b> of two canal traces and trenching of one of these. Luminescence profiling through the canal infill successfully identified {{the base of the}} canal as well as revealing distrubance and mixing of the canal infill that was not apparent from visual inspection or sedimentological analyses of the infill sediments. OSL dating of the canal bed indicates excavation (or re-excavation) of the canal bed between the first millennium BC and the middle of the first millenium AD. This date is consistent with the time of initial occupation of Angkor borei in the fourth century BC. Multiple charcoal samples with a pooled age of early fourth to early fifth century AD probably signal the onset of canal infilling. The apparent demise of the canal coincides with a major change in land-use signalled in pollen and diatom data from Angkor Borei, but this change cannot be taken to indicate de-population of the region. This tentative chronology will be refined when more canals are investigated and greater precision is achieved in OSL dating of the canals.
