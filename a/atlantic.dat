5|$|Alex was {{the first}} <b>Atlantic</b> {{hurricane}} {{in the month of}} June since Hurricane Allison in 1995, and the strongest in terms of wind speed since Hurricane Alma in 1966. Its barometric pressure recording of 946 mbar (27.96inches) is the most intense from any <b>Atlantic</b> hurricane in June, although Hurricane Audrey in 1957 ties this intensity. Alex is thus tied for the most intense June <b>Atlantic</b> hurricane on record overall. However, as Audrey's pressure was estimated, Audrey's actual pressure might be as low as 925 mbar.|$|E
5|$|Alice formed {{later in}} the {{calendar}} year than any <b>Atlantic</b> tropical cyclone on record, forming six hours {{later in the}} season than Tropical Storm Zeta in 2005. Alice was one of only eight <b>Atlantic</b> tropical cyclones to form in the month of December. Alice was the first of two <b>Atlantic</b> tropical cyclones to exist in two calendar years, the other being 2005's Zeta. The hurricane was also one of only six tropical or subtropical cyclones to exist in the month of January and the strongest to do so.|$|E

5|$|An <b>Atlantic</b> {{hurricane}} or {{tropical storm}} is a tropical cyclone that {{forms in the}} <b>Atlantic</b> Ocean, usually in the summer or fall. A hurricane differs from a cyclone or typhoon only {{on the basis of}} location. A hurricane is a storm that occurs in the <b>Atlantic</b> Ocean and northeastern Pacific Ocean, a typhoon occurs in the northwestern Pacific Ocean, and a cyclone occurs in the south Pacific or Indian Ocean.|$|E
5|$|An area of {{disturbed}} {{weather in}} the central <b>Atlantic</b> managed to gain enough organization to be designated Tropical Depression Two on July 31. The depression moved across the <b>Atlantic</b> without strengthening due to high upper-level wind shear, and dissipated near the Lesser Antilles on August 3.|$|E
5|$|An {{off-season}} <b>Atlantic</b> hurricane is {{a recorded}} tropical or subtropical cyclone {{that existed in}} the <b>Atlantic</b> basin outside of the official <b>Atlantic</b> hurricane season. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration currently defines the season as occurring between June 1 and November 30 each calendar year, which is when 97% of all <b>Atlantic</b> tropical cyclones occur. Peak activity is known to be between August and October. In the off-season, storms are most likely to occur in May, with approximately 60% of such storms occurring during that month. Occasionally, however, storms develop in or persist until December. As of , there have been 81 off-season cyclones in the <b>Atlantic</b> hurricane database, which began in 1851. In addition, there were six storms before 1851, and one hurricane in 1863 that {{is not part of the}} official database.|$|E

5|$|Analysis of {{mitochondrial}} DNA {{has also}} revealed two distinct lineages within this species, one occupying the western <b>Atlantic</b> {{and the other}} occupying the eastern <b>Atlantic,</b> Indian, and Pacific Oceans. This suggests that Indo-Pacific blacktip sharks are descended {{from those in the}} eastern <b>Atlantic,</b> while the western <b>Atlantic</b> sharks became isolated by the widening <b>Atlantic</b> Ocean {{on one side and the}} formation of the Isthmus of Panama on the other. Blacktip sharks from these two regions differ in morphology, coloration, and life history characteristics, and the eastern <b>Atlantic</b> lineage may merit species status. Fossil teeth belonging to this species have been found in Early Miocene (2316 Ma) deposits in Delaware and Florida.|$|E
5|$|As {{the first}} Category5 landfalling {{hurricane}} in 15years, {{and due to}} its widespread impact, the name Dean was officially retired on May 13, 2008 by the World Meteorological Organization during its annual meeting in Orlando, Florida, {{and will not be}} used for a future <b>Atlantic</b> hurricane.

5|$|Both species eat {{primarily}} squid. The whales make seasonal inshore {{and offshore}} movements {{in response to}} the dispersal of their prey. Fish that are consumed include <b>Atlantic</b> cod, Greenland turbot, <b>Atlantic</b> mackerel, <b>Atlantic</b> herring, hake, and spiny dogfish in the northwest <b>Atlantic.</b> In the Faroe Islands, whales mostly eat squid, but will also eat fish species such as greater argentine and blue whiting. However, Faroe whales do not seem to feed on cod, herring, or mackerel even when they are abundant.|$|E
5|$|Cochrane, by now a Vice Admiral, assumed his {{position}} as Commander-in-Chief of British forces on the North <b>Atlantic</b> station in April 1814 and ordered the recruitment of a body of Colonial Marines {{as he had done}} six years earlier on Marie Galante. Rear Admiral George Cockburn, Cochrane's second-in-command on the <b>Atlantic</b> coast, implemented Cochrane's order recruiting the second Corps of Colonial Marines.

50|$|Much of <b>Atlantic's</b> renewed {{success as}} a rock label in the late 1970s can be {{attributed}} to the efforts of renowned A&R manager John Kalodner. In 1974 the former photographer, record store manager and music critic joined <b>Atlantic's</b> New York publicity department. In 1975 Kalodner moved to the A&R department, rose rapidly through the ranks, and in 1976 he was promoted to become <b>Atlantic's</b> first West Coast director of A&R. Over the next four years he was instrumental in signing a string of major acts including Foreigner, AC/DC, Peter Gabriel and Phil Collins. Kalodner built his reputation by signing acts that other labels had turned down, and perhaps the most significant example of his achievements in this area was his championing of Anglo-American band Foreigner.|$|R
5|$|Construction of the <b>Atlantic</b> City Expressway {{started in}} the summer of 1962. The design was to feature a 300- to 400-foot-wide roadway with 12-foot-wide travel lanes and right {{shoulders}} as well as 3-foot-wide left shoulders. The portion between Route 42 in Turnersville and the Garden State Parkway in Egg Harbor Township was completed on July 31, 1964, and the portion between the Garden State Parkway and <b>Atlantic</b> City was finished in July 1965. Construction of the <b>Atlantic</b> City Expressway cost a total of $48.2 million. Tolls on the <b>Atlantic</b> City Expressway initially cost $0.75 at the Egg Harbor toll plaza and $0.15 at the Pleasantville toll plaza. In 1991, the South Jersey Transportation Authority was created by the New Jersey Legislature to operate the <b>Atlantic</b> City Expressway, the <b>Atlantic</b> City International Airport, and operations of the <b>Atlantic</b> County Transportation Authority.|$|E

5|$|During the year, a {{total of}} 17tropical cyclones, 15tropical storms, six {{hurricane}}s and two major hurricanes formed.

The season was one of only four on record for the <b>Atlantic</b> with more than one Category5 storm. It was the second on record in which an <b>Atlantic</b> hurricane, Felix, and an eastern Pacific hurricane, Henriette, made landfall on the same day. September had a record-tying eight storms, although the strengths and durations of most of the storms were low. Aside from Dean and Felix, none of the storms exceeded Category1 intensity.|$|E
