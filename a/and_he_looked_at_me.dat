25|$|I {{just want}} to say that when I was 16 or 17 years old, I went to see Buddy Holly play at Duluth National Guard Armory and I was three feet away from him… <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> And I just have some kind of feeling that he was – I don’t know how or why – but I know he was with us all the time we were making this record in some kind of way.|$|E
2500|$|According to Amy Lee, {{the song}} has several meanings, the first being an {{incident}} at a restaurant. During an interview from a tour stop in Tulsa she told The Boston Phoenix: [...] "I {{was inspired to}} write it when someone said something to me— I didn’t know him, and I {{thought he might be}} clairvoyant. I was in a relationship and I was completely unhappy. But I was hiding it. I was being completely abused and I was trying to cover it up; I wouldn’t even admit it to myself. So then I had spoken maybe 10 or 15 words to this guy, who was a friend of a friend. We were waiting for everyone else to show up, and we went into a restaurant and got a table. <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> and said, ‘Are you happy?’ And I felt my heart leap, and I was like, he totally knows what I’m thinking. And I lied, I said I was fine. Anyway, he's not really clairvoyant. But he is a sociology major." [...] Lee said in a VH1 interview: [...] "Open-mindedness. It's about waking up to all the things you've been missing for so long. One day someone said something that made my heart race for a second and I realized that for months I'd been numb, just going through the motions of life." [...] During an interview with Blender, Lee claimed that she wrote [...] "Bring Me to Life" [...] about her longtime friend, Josh Hartzler, whom she married in 2007.|$|E
60|$|There was {{an anxious}} pause. Then Monsieur Vigo's eyes twinkled, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|Kit {{told him}} <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> Jefferson, who knitted his brows.|$|R
60|$|Then {{she stopped}} short, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> {{her a little}} abruptly.|$|R
60|$|At last it was finished, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> {{his work}} with complacency.|$|R
60|$|The dark shade {{lifted from}} the ranger's face, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with the smile of the old fishing days.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly {{he threw}} {{back his head}} and glanced down the valley. Then he changed his {{position}} <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> more confidentially.|$|E
6000|$|... "Does it seem right," [...] asked Marais again, [...] "that a Christian {{man should}} be left to starve in the wilderness?" [...] <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|Christian lit the lamp; <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> her hungrily {{without a}} word.|$|R
60|$|Marie {{brought him}} {{the bill of}} fare, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> it gravely.|$|R
60|$|Hayward {{thought that}} Philip choked a sob, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> him with astonishment.|$|R
6000|$|It was a bold {{thing to}} say, and I quaked. <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> in his keen way, {{through and through}} [...] "You saved his life once before, didn't you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{he looked}} at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll have to go now, Walter, because of the train--and the children.' <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> It seems hard." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] Felix replied, {{with that}} weird sense of mystery {{creeping}} over him now more profoundly than ever. [...] "He was on guard by the tree <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> angrily." ...|$|E
60|$|The fellow's skin {{coat and}} cap were old, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> Deering with surprise.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the sky <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> {{the castle}} walls, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> {{took a step}} back towards the door.|$|R
60|$|I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> Harry, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> me; <b>and</b> then we both <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> this incomprehensible captain.|$|R
60|$|When the {{sickness}} passed over, {{he stood up}} away from the post, trembling and lugubrious. His eyelids drooped heavily over his eyes, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> and smiled a faint, sick smile.|$|E
6000|$|... "I deplore my {{business}} here," [...] he announced shortly. [...] "No doubt {{it will be}} known to you already." [...] <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> again, allowing his eyes to linger on my face.|$|E
60|$|Well, we came {{at last to}} Bazoches, {{where he}} {{was to take the}} {{southern}} road and I the northern. He half turned in his saddle before he left me, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with a singular expression of inquiry in his face.|$|E
60|$|She <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> Nicholas, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> her. 'Do {{you wish}} me to elope, Nic?' she asked.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> me, <b>and</b> I {{seen that}} he had got it in the neck, right enough.|$|R
60|$|Now Rames shook like a reed in {{the evening}} wind, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> her with glowing eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall {{write in}} my room," [...] I snarled like a thwarted animal, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> curiously. [...] "Very well," [...] he said; [...] "then I'll make some notes {{and think about}} that order of ours out under the magnolias." ...|$|E
60|$|As will be imagined, {{these words}} took the Sultan by surprise, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{to see how}} I should take the {{statement}} of the princess. As I was unable to speak, I placed my hand on my head {{to show that it}} was true.|$|E
6000|$|... "She does that." [...] <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> as {{with the}} sense of drawing from me, for his relief, some greater help than I was as yet {{conscious}} of the courage to offer. [...] "It is that she desires me. She likes it. And the extraordinary thing is that I like it." ...|$|E
60|$|Cliffe had not {{expected}} to be addressed in good English, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the man with surprise.|$|R
60|$|At {{this remark}} {{all of the}} other Rover boys <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> Fred, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> his cousins in return.|$|R
60|$|Jack had now {{managed to}} raise {{himself to a}} sitting position, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the Saw-Horse with much interest.|$|R
6000|$|... "I said to him," [...] {{answered}} the other, [...] "'Do {{you know a}} man from Nottingham named Morel?' <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> as if he'd jump at my throat. So I said: 'I see you know the name; it's Paul Morel.' Then I told him about your saying you would go and see him. 'What does he want?' he said, {{as if you were}} a policeman." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{was a big}} bearded {{capuchin}} in {{the yard}} at alms-time to-day--" [...] I was beginning, when the friar's knife clattered from his hand, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with eyes of positive fear out of a face from which the last drop of blood had abruptly receded. I checked my inquiry {{at the sight of}} him thus suddenly disordered, whilst my mother, who, as usual, observed nothing, made a foolish comment.|$|E
6000|$|... 'He {{no longer}} walked, but crawled on hand and knee through the snow. I came to him, and read death in his eyes. Even {{then it was}} {{not too late to}} eat of the ptarmigan. He cast away his rifle and carried the birds in his mouth like a dog. I walked by his side, upright. <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> during the moments he rested, and {{wondered}} that I was so strong. I could see it, though he no longer spoke; and when his lips moved, they moved without sound.|$|E
6000|$|Again his astonishment was obvious; <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> {{her with}} an {{expression}} of mingled incredulity and mortification. She went on: ...|$|R
60|$|But White Fang {{could not}} believe. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the master, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the dogs. Then <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> back eagerly <b>and</b> questioningly at the master.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ay! ay!' <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> {{his master}} for {{explanation}} from the {{stronger and more}} familiar voice. 'I be deaf, you see, ma'am.' ...|$|R
