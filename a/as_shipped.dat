500|$|DJ Hero 2 {{follows from}} its {{predecessor}} in simulating {{the performance of}} a disc jockey mixing one or two songs using a special turntable controller. The controller, the same unit <b>as</b> <b>shipped</b> previously with DJ Hero, includes a rotatable turntable to use for recording scratching, three [...] "stream" [...] buttons to match notes from the two music tracks and an effects track, and a slider to control the crossfade between tracks. These actions are presented to the players through on-screen notation that scrolls in time with the music. Players score points by performing the actions correctly, but are not penalized otherwise. By successfully completing a consecutive set of actions, the player can increase their scoring multiplier up to 4x; the multiplier returns to 1x should they miss any actions. Certain marked sections, when played correctly, fill a [...] "Euphoria" [...] (the [...] "Star Power" [...] for this game) meter which can be unleashed using another button on the controller and will temporarily double the scoring. The player can also earn the ability to rewind a song by a few seconds by playing a long string of consecutive notes. They can rewind the song by quickly spinning the turntable in reverse; the rewind effect can be used to either correct a mistake or further boost one's scoring.|$|E
500|$|Green Day: Rock Band {{includes}} 47 {{songs by}} Green Day (six {{of which are}} arranged in three two-song medleys, making the final setlist 44 songs long), spanning their career from 1994 to 2009. It is the first Rock Band game to feature a complete album in the game <b>as</b> <b>shipped,</b> with the entirety of Dookie (except for the hidden track [...] "All By Myself"), American Idiot, and 21st Century Breakdown playable. The inclusion of the album American Idiot was {{a key part of}} the setlist, according to Harmonix's Chris Foster, due to the nature of the album (which is meant to be listened to as a whole), as well as the album's success and stage adaptation. This led the team to also include 21st Century Breakdown, an album similar to American Idiot in that it is meant to be heard as a complete work. Since Harmonix already released six songs from the album as downloadable content, they did not want to make those who purchased the songs pay for them again in the full game, and designed the game to include those songs for players who previously downloaded them. Once these two albums were selected, Harmonix's CEO Alex Rigopulos determined they needed to include the Dookie album, the major label debut of the band and one of the most requested albums by Rock Band fans, in order to complete the experience.|$|E

500|$|Activision's {{original}} {{announcement of}} Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock indicated a planned release in their 2008 fiscal year, ending on March 31, 2008.; RedOctane later clarified a release {{in the last}} quarter of 2007, and further revealed that all versions of the game would feature wireless controllers as well as online multiplayer and downloadable content. The game was officially announced by Activision and RedOctane on May 23, 2007 for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Wii and Xbox 360. Budcat Creations ported the game to the PlayStation 2, and Vicarious Visions ported it to the Wii. In September 2007, Aspyr Media announced they would be publishing Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock for the Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X ports. Demos of Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock appeared in Tony Hawk's Proving Ground for the Xbox 360 in the Xbox Live Marketplace, and from the Internet as an ISO image. The demo features five songs ("Lay Down", [...] "Rock You Like a Hurricane", [...] "Even Flow", [...] "Hit Me with Your Best Shot", and [...] "The Metal") played within the Desert Rock Tour venue.s Proving Ground | publisher = Activision | date = 2008-08-23 | url = http://investor.activision.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=261370 | accessdate = 2008-12-03 }} <b>As</b> <b>shipped,</b> the game did not offer offline Co-Op Quickplay mode, a feature that was included in Guitar Hero II.

2500|$|The game is {{the first}} Harmonix game to feature a full album in the game <b>as</b> <b>shipped,</b> with the {{entirety}} of American Idiot, Dookie (except for hidden track [...] "All By Myself"), and 21st Century Breakdown being playable. The inclusion of the full album of American Idiot was {{the centerpiece of the}} game's development, according to Harmonix' Chris Foster, {{due in part to the}} thematic nature of the album which is meant to be listened as a whole, as well as the album's success and Broadway musical. This led the team to also including 21st Century Breakdown, an album similar to American Idiot that is meant to be heard as one complete work; as Harmonix had already released six songs from the album as downloadable content, they did not want to make those that had purchased the songs have to pay for them again in the full game, and instead designed the game to immediately incorporate those songs into the game if the player had already purchased them. Once these two albums were selected, Harmonix' CEO Alex Rigopulos determined that they needed to include the full Dookie album, the major label debut of the band and one of the most requested albums by Rock Band fans, in order to complete the experience. Though Harmonix had considered including material from the earliest Green Day albums, 1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours and Kerplunk, master multi-track recordings [...] required by the Rock Band game engine to provide proper feedback when playing were not readily available,. According to Cool, while the master tapes for Kerplunk exist, they are in poor shape and the process to digitize them would destroy the tape; as such, Cool stated [...] "We’re making sure we have the right dudes to do it" [...] as potential future downloadable content for the game. Harmonix opted against using live versions of songs on these albums, feeling that the game needed to stay with the studio versions of the songs. Once Harmonix had selected to focus on the three albums, they decided against including any additional non-Green Day songs, instead focusing on rounding out the group's history to present a complete Green Day experience.|$|E
