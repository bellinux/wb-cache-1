5000|$|Indirect {{comparison}} meta-analysis methods (also called network meta-analyses, {{in particular}} when multiple treatments are assessed simultaneously) generally use two main methodologies. First, is the Bucher method {{which is a}} single or repeated comparison of a closed loop of three-treatments such {{that one of them}} is common to the two studies and forms the node where the loop begins and ends. Therefore, multiple two-by-two comparisons (3-treatment loops) <b>are</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>compare</b> multiple treatments. This methodology requires that trials with more than two arms have two arms only selected as independent pair-wise comparisons are required. The alternative methodology uses complex statistical modelling to include the multiple arm trials and comparisons simultaneously between all competing treatments. These have been executed using Bayesian methods, mixed linear models and meta-regression approaches ...|$|E

Bhimu Patil, a professor of horticulture and director of the Vegetable and Fruit Improvement Center at Texas A&M University, agrees that microgreens may potentially have higher levels of nutrients than mature vegetables. But he says more studies <b>are</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>compare</b> the two side by side. [...] "This is a very good start, but there can be a lot of variation in nutrients depending on where you grow it, when you harvest, and the soil medium," [...] Patil says.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{report a}} case of {{systemic}} lupus erythematosus vaso-occlusive retinopathy with severe visual loss treated with intravenous pulsed cyclophosphamide. METHODS: Retrospective interventional case report. RESULTS: A 20 -year-old Cambodian woman with newly diagnosed systemic lupus erythematosus presented with acute visual loss. Fluorescein fundus angiography demonstrated occlusive retinal vasculitis. Treatment with pulsed intravenous cyclophosphamide, intravenous methylprednisolone, and anticoagulation resulted in recovery of vision from count fingers to 6 / 6 in both eyes.

The OKKAM {{initiative}} 1 {{has recently}} highlighted {{the need of}} moving from the traditional web towards a “web of entities”, where real-world objects descriptions could be retrieved, univocally identified, and shared over the web.

We claim that automatic techniques <b>are</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>compare</b> different RDF descriptions of a domain {{with the goal of}} automatically detect heterogeneous descriptions of the same real-world objects. Problems and techniques to solve them are discussed together with some experimental results on a real case study on web data. ...|$|E

Using Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA), the GII aggregates different dimensions of gender inequalities in order to determine endogenously the weight of each variable.

40|$|The {{treatment}} {{of patients with}} achalasia is complex due to a considerably high recurrence rate and risk of treatment-related complications. The per-oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) is a new endoscopic technique that combines {{the benefits of a}} minimally invasive endoscopic procedure with the efficacy of a surgical myotomy. Implementation of the POEM technique may lead to fewer complications, a lower recurrence rate and reduced costs. During the procedure, a myotomy of the circular muscle layer of the oesophagus is performed after creating a submucosal tunnel in the oesophagus. The first studies of this new technique show promising results. Experienced therapeutic endoscopists can learn to perform the POEM technique relatively easily.
