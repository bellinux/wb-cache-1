5000|$|... 2008 South Carolina Learjet 60 crash, another {{high-speed}} <b>aborted</b> <b>take-off</b> ...|$|E
5000|$|... 11 April 1977, Douglas C-47B C-FXXT of Superior Airways {{was damaged}} beyond {{economic}} repair in an <b>aborted</b> <b>take-off.</b>|$|E
50|$|On 7 May 1982, Douglas C-47A C-FQHF overran {{the runway}} at Calgary International Airport {{following}} an <b>aborted</b> <b>take-off.</b> The aircraft was damaged beyond economic repair.|$|E
50|$|The Volland {{competed in}} the Charles-Delesalle Cup on 15 August 1936 but had to <b>abort</b> <b>take-off</b> and retire.|$|R
5000|$|The NTSB {{published}} {{its report}} into the accident on July 16, 2010. It {{concluded that the}} cause of the accident was two-fold: (1) the tires were severely under-inflated, which resulted in several of them blowing-out during the take-off roll; (2) the captain <b>aborted</b> the <b>take-off</b> at high speed, 144 kn. Normal operating procedure for the Learjet 60 is to <b>abort</b> <b>take-off</b> above 80 kn only for serious problems that make the aircraft uncontrollable, and never to <b>abort</b> <b>take-off</b> above the [...] "go/no-go" [...] decision speed V1 (which for this particular take-off was 136 kn). The co-pilot could be heard on the CVR saying the appropriate [...] "go go go".|$|R
50|$|Lack of crew discipline, who did {{not make}} the logical {{reaction}} of <b>aborting</b> <b>take-off</b> and checking for errors when the alarm sounded as the engines started and as it continued to sound until the take-off attempt.|$|R
50|$|During the show, a HAL HJT-36 skidded off {{the runway}} when a tyre burst after the pilot <b>aborted</b> <b>take-off</b> as the aircraft's canopy {{inadvertently}} opened up. Fortunately, {{there was no}} fatality.|$|E
5000|$|At {{approximately}} 6:30 PM on Tuesday, December 27, 2011, Seattle-bound Southwest Airlines Flight 2287 <b>aborted</b> <b>take-off</b> due to two blown-out tires. The plane reportedly made a hard landing, and all 130 passengers aboard survived.|$|E
5000|$|September 13, 1982 - Spantax Flight 995, DC-10-30CF EC-DEG, was {{destroyed}} by fire after an <b>aborted</b> <b>take-off</b> at Málaga, Spain. A total of 50 passengers were killed and 110 injured due to the flames.|$|E
5000|$|... 6 December 2008 - Piper Cherokee <b>aborts</b> <b>take-off</b> {{after failing}} to reach {{required}} airspeed due to the pilot inadvertently leaving the carburettor heat on and overruns the runway. One person suffers minor injuries and the aircraft is significantly damaged.|$|R
25|$|On 28 August 1992, a Bouraq Vickers Viscount (registered PH-IVX) was {{destroyed}} in an engine fire at Syamsudin Noor Airport. The fire started during the take-off run, but the pilots noticed it in time to <b>abort</b> <b>take-off</b> and evacuate the 64 passengers (plus six crew), before the aircraft was engulfed by the flames.|$|R
50|$|In July 2009, a Kingfisher Airlines {{aircraft}} hit a stray pig on {{the runway}} of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar International Airport. In March 2010, a runway at Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport in Mumbai was shut for 20 minutes after a stray dog was spotted. In a similar incident at the same airport in January 2016, one domestic flight was forced to <b>abort</b> <b>take-off</b> while four others were made to hover in the skies for more than 15 minutes after a dog strayed into the runway.|$|R
5000|$|On June 17, 2003, Onur Air Flight 2263, an MD-88 (registration TC-ONP) {{overshot}} {{the runway}} at Groningen Airport Eelde following an <b>aborted</b> <b>take-off.</b> There were no injuries, but the airline {{was accused of}} security breaches.|$|E
5000|$|... 23 October 1973: a NAMC YS-11A {{registration}} PP-SMJ {{flying from}} Rio de Janeiro-Santos Dumont to Belo Horizonte-Pampulha during an <b>aborted</b> <b>take-off</b> overrun the runway and slid into Guanabara Bay. Of the 65 passengers and crew, 8 passengers died.|$|E
5000|$|On 29 September 1986, Indian Airlines flight IC 571, an Airbus A300b2-1c (registration VT-ELV), on {{a routine}} flight from Chennai to Mumbai, <b>aborted</b> <b>take-off</b> due to a bird-strike and {{suffered}} a runway excursion. No fatalities were reported. The aircraft was damaged beyond repair.|$|E
5000|$|On 28 August 1992, Vickers Viscount PK-IVX of Bouraq Indonesia Airlines {{was damaged}} beyond {{economic}} repair when an engine fire forced {{the crew to}} <b>abort</b> the <b>take-off.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{aeroplane}} {{which took}} the United players and staff home from Zemun Airport needed {{to stop in}} Munich to refuel. This {{was carried out in}} worsening weather, {{and by the time the}} refuelling was complete and the call was made for the passengers to re-board the aircraft, the wintry showers had taken hold and snow had settled heavily on the runway and around the airport. There were two <b>aborted</b> <b>take-offs</b> which led to concern on board, and the passengers were advised by a stewardess to disembark again while a minor technical error was fixed.|$|R
5000|$|It {{was quickly}} {{determined}} {{that the cause of}} the crash was the snow which had frozen to the aircraft's wings whilst G-AGZA was waiting to take-off, resulting in the aircraft not gaining any height and making an emergency landing on the roof of 46 Angus Drive. The house was subsequently nicknamed [...] "Dakota Rest". The pilot was also assigned a cause factor for failing to <b>abort</b> <b>take-off</b> after noticing it had been snowing and his aircraft being covered in snow. The crash landing on the houses earned the Captain the nickname [...] "Rooftop Johnson".|$|R
5000|$|On 3 January 2010, Air Berlin Flight 2450, {{operated}} by a Boeing 737-800 (D-ABKF) overran {{the end of the}} runway after an <b>aborted</b> <b>take-off</b> at high speed due to an airspeed discrepancy on the two pilots' instruments. There were no injuries among the 171 people on board.|$|E
50|$|On 7 November 2004 a Boeing 747-230 Freighter {{was damaged}} beyond repair due to an <b>aborted</b> <b>take-off</b> with {{insufficient}} runway remaining. None of the 4 crew were injured. The take-off was aborted after a report of smoke from the tower and hearing a loud bang in the cockpit.|$|E
50|$|Then {{the airline}} {{lost most of}} its medium-range charter {{contracts}} and the service problems that followed forced the travel operators to withdraw their contracts, hence, Excalibur shut down in June 1996. An incident with a DC-10 seen with smoke coming from the aircraft followed by an <b>aborted</b> <b>take-off</b> shattered {{public confidence in the}} airline.|$|E
50|$|Except {{for flight}} training, {{airplane}} testing, and aerobatics, a stall is usually an undesirable event. Spoilers (sometimes called lift dumpers), however, are devices that are intentionally deployed {{to create a}} carefully controlled flow separation over part of an aircraft's wing to reduce the lift it generates, increase the drag, and allow the aircraft to descend more rapidly without gaining speed. Spoilers are also deployed asymmetrically (one wing only) to enhance roll control. Spoilers {{can also be used}} on <b>aborted</b> <b>take-offs</b> and after main wheel contact on landing to increase the aircraft's weight on its wheels for better braking action.|$|R
50|$|As {{the plane}} {{accelerated}} on Runway 36, its starboard engine began to spool down. The pilots elected not to <b>abort</b> <b>take-off</b> and continued the take-off roll. Airborne, the plane veered {{to the right}} while flying at low altitude. The plane stalled, clipped trees, hit an electric power line and impacted the ground in an inverted attitude in a wheat field. It exploded and burst into flames. The plane lost contact with Multan International Airport control tower two minutes after takeoff. Everyone on board died instantly. It was reported that the post-impact fire was so intense that no-one on board could have survived.|$|R
50|$|Flight 865 {{was cleared}} for takeoff from Runway 16. Suddenly, {{the crew of the}} McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 {{attempted}} to <b>abort</b> <b>take-off</b> after the failure of the number 3 (right) engine. The abort occurred at speeds nearing V2, and after rotation of the nose. Following the abort, attempts were made to stop the aircraft on the runway by use of brakes, ground spoilers and thrust reversers, but the crew was unable to stop the aircraft within the boundaries of the runway, which exited the airport property. The captain stated that he feared that the aircraft might hit buildings or objects if he did not abort the takeoff.|$|R
5000|$|On October 23, 2004 a BETA Boeing 707 on a Cargo {{flight from}} Manaus-Eduardo Gomes International Airport, Brazil to São Paulo-Guarulhos International Airport, Brazil <b>aborted</b> <b>take-off</b> from Manaus {{due to a}} [...] "loud noise". The {{aircraft}} afterwards started tilting to the right. It appeared the landing gear ruptured the right wing. The 37-year-old aircraft (registration PP-BSE) was written-off.|$|E
50|$|British Airways Flight 2276 was a {{scheduled}} international passenger flight which caught fire during take-off from Las Vegas-McCarran International Airport on 8 September 2015, prompting an <b>aborted</b> <b>take-off</b> and {{the evacuation of}} all passengers and crew. The flight, bound for Gatwick Airport near London, had 157 passengers and 13 crew. The aircraft had suffered an uncontained engine failure in the left (#1) GE90 engine.|$|E
5000|$|On 19 January 2010, PSA Airlines Canadair CRJ-200 N246PS overran {{the runway}} at Yeager Airport, Charleston, West Virginia {{following}} an <b>aborted</b> <b>take-off.</b> The aircraft {{was stopped by}} the EMAS {{at the end of}} the runway, sustaining minor damage to its undercarriage. The information in the referenced article regarding [...] "substantial" [...] damage was premature and inaccurate. The aircraft was flown away within days of the incident after removal of a damaged landing gear cover.|$|E
50|$|On 29 July 2017, Antonov An-74TK100 UR-CKC of CAVOK Air {{crashed on}} {{take-off}} and was damaged beyond repair. A birdstrike was reported and the aircraft overran {{the end of}} the runway whilst attempting to <b>abort</b> the <b>take-off.</b>|$|R
50|$|When {{the pilot}} {{accelerated}} {{down the runway}} he noticed that when the aircraft lifted off, it could not gain any height. The ice on the wings disturbed the air flow, {{which resulted in the}} aircraft not gaining any height. It was however too late to <b>abort</b> <b>take-off</b> so the crew was forced {{to try to get the}} aircraft to climb. The aircraft flew only a few metres high straight down Angus Drive from the end of the runway until the left wing contacted some rooftops and the aircraft slewed through 90 degrees and came to rest on the roof of a house at 46 Angus Drive in the London suburb of Ruislip.|$|R
25|$|The pilots of the {{substantially}} damaged One-Eleven successfully <b>aborted</b> the <b>take-off</b> and {{the aircraft}} was evacuated using emergency slides, with no casualties. The Aztec was written off, but the One-Eleven was repaired {{and returned to}} service. Four recommendations were made following the accident.|$|R
50|$|Another {{incident}} {{occurred on the}} runway in March 1984, when Pacific Western Airlines Flight 501 attempted to take-off. A component of the left engine broke off and hit the fuel stores in the wing, resulting in a fire that spread over the left and back portions of the Boeing 737-200. The pilots <b>aborted</b> <b>take-off</b> and exited the runway onto a taxiway, where flight attendants evacuated all passengers. While some suffered severe injuries, none of the aircraft's occupants died.|$|E
50|$|On June 27, 1985, an American Airlines DC-10-10 {{registered}} N129AA operating Flight 633 to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport with 257 {{passengers on}} board <b>aborted</b> <b>take-off</b> from runway 8 after a loud rumbling sound was heard by the crew as the airplane approached V1. Unable to stop the aircraft on the runway, the aircraft ended up nose-first in the lagoon {{at the end of}} the runway. A nose gear tire blowout was suspected. There were no fatalities, and aircraft returned to service six months later.|$|E
5000|$|On 25 June 2017 a Primera Air Boeing 737-800 {{operating}} Jet2 flight LS602 from Palma, Mallorca to East Midlands, UK, <b>aborted</b> <b>take-off</b> {{just before}} entering the runway. This was reported by the flight crew as [...] "due to an engine oil pressure light being illuminated" [...] resulting in the aircraft being returned to the stand. After diagnostic work by an engineer, during which time passengers were held on board, a second attempt for departure was made approximately one hour forty minutes late. Take-off was abandoned mid-runway during acceleration for take-off, the fault this time reported as an engine air valve. The flight was abandoned resulting in passengers eventually being dispersed to local hotels eight hours after the scheduled flight time.|$|E
5000|$|On 2 August 1996, an Air Algérie Boeing 737-200 (registered 7T-VED) overran {{the runway}} at Tlemcen Airport {{in an attempt}} to <b>abort</b> the <b>take-off</b> for a {{scheduled}} flight to Algiers. There were no fatalities among the 100 passengers and 6 crew members on board, even though the aircraft was substantially damaged.|$|R
2500|$|Rayment {{moved the}} {{throttle}} forward slowly and released the brakes; the plane began to accelerate, and radio officer Bill Rodgers radioed the control tower {{with the message}} [...] "Zulu Uniform rolling". The plane threw up slush as it gathered speed, and Thain called out the plane's velocity in 10-knot increments. At 85 knots, the port engine began to surge again, and he pulled back marginally on the port throttle before pushing it forward again. Once the plane reached , he announced [...] "V1", at which {{it was no longer}} safe to <b>abort</b> <b>take-off,</b> and Rayment listened for the call of [...] "V2" [...] (...) , the minimum required to get off the ground. Thain expected the speed to rise, but it fluctuated around 117 knots before suddenly dropping to , and then [...] Rayment shouted [...] "Christ, we won't make it!", as Thain looked up to see what lay ahead.|$|R
5000|$|June 13, 1996 - Garuda Indonesia Flight 865, DC-10-30 PK-GIE, {{had just}} taken off from Fukuoka Airport, Japan when a {{high-pressure}} blade from engine #3 separated. The aircraft {{was just a few}} feet above the runway and the pilot decided to <b>abort</b> the <b>take-off.</b> Consequently, the DC-10 skidded off the runway and came to a halt 1600 ft past it, losing one of its engines and its landing gear.|$|R
