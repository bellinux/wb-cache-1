5|$|Gary Klein, born , {{attended}} the University of California at Davis before transferring to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). During the Independent Activities Period in 1973, {{a group of}} students including Klein worked together under Professor Buckley to produce <b>an</b> <b>aluminum</b> framed bicycle. After analyzing a number of contemporary steel frames, and examining ones that had broken in use, they were able to determine the stresses placed on a bicycle frame. Faced with limited available types of aluminum alloy tubing, the students chose to construct frames from 6061 aluminium alloy seamless drawn tube; alternatives such as the stronger 7075 aluminum alloy were discarded because of the tubing dimensions.|$|E

In the 1990s, the company began creating designer versions of the 1006 chair, such as the stackable Hudson chair and the 111 Navy Chair made from recycled plastic. Emeco also makes stools, tables, and other furniture. As of 2012, more than one million Emeco 1006 chairs have been produced.|$|E
40|$|Aluminum {{is present}} in several {{vaccines}} to improve the immune response. Some parents are concerned that aluminum in vaccines might be harmful to babies.

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} the present study was to discuss the effects of local {{solidification}} time and solidus velocity on porosity formation in high strength aluminum alloy casting. With systematic change in the riser size, together with variation of thickness and length, <b>A</b> 201 <b>aluminum</b> alloys were cast in 100 % silica sand molds. The porosity content of <b>A</b> 201 <b>aluminum</b> alloy was affected by the local solidification time and solidus velocity in this study. The correlation between porosity content and solidification time is found to be split into 2 bands, each being associated with one of the two thicknesses of plate castings. The longer the solidification time, the more the porosity content was measured in the <b>A</b> 201 <b>aluminum</b> alloy plate casting. And the faster the solidus velocity, the more the porosity content in this study. The porosity content of <b>A</b> 201 <b>aluminum</b> alloy was influenced by both of solidification time and solidus velocity at same time in this study. Basically, shorter local solidification time with slow solidus velocity seems get lower porosity content in <b>A</b> 201 <b>aluminum</b> alloy castings...|$|R

5|$|During the 1920s, the American Budd Company, at {{the time}} a {{relatively}} obscure auto-frame supplier, developed an extensive working relationship with the French firm Michelin, which was best known for its tires. In 1929, Michelin built its first rail car, and by 1932 nine of its cars were in operating service, all of which featured innovative and distinctive pneumatic tires. The company claimed that its application of tires on its rail cars afforded both a substantially more cushioned ride and increased the cars' traction by 35%. The design of Michelin's tired wheels included <b>an</b> <b>aluminum</b> safety ring and a flange that were only used {{in the event of a}} puncture or other type of tire failure; during normal operation, only the rubber tire made contact with the rail.|$|E
5|$|One unique feature {{found on}} most MP 38 and MP 40 submachine guns was <b>an</b> <b>aluminum,</b> steel, or {{bakelite}} resting bar or support under the barrel. This {{was used to}} steady the weapon when firing {{over the side of}} open-top armored personnel carriers such as the Sdkfz 251 half-track. A handguard, made of a synthetic material derived from bakelite, was located between the magazine housing and the pistol grip. The barrel lacked any form of insulation, which often resulted in burns on the supporting hand if it was incorrectly positioned. The MP 40 also had a forward-folding metal stock, the first for a submachine gun, resulting in a shorter overall weapon when folded. However, this stock design was at times insufficiently durable for hard combat use.|$|E
5|$|The SS190 FMJ, a {{refinement}} of the SS90, {{was introduced in}} 1993. It offered superior performance over the prototype projectile as well as slightly reduced length. The latter change allowed it to be used more conveniently in the Five-seven pistol, also being developed at that time. Fired from the P90, the SS190 propels a 2.0-g (31grain) bullet at a muzzle velocity of roughly 715m/s (2,350 ft/s). It has a steel penetrator and <b>an</b> <b>aluminum</b> core. The SS190 has been manufactured with a plain, black, and a black-on-white tip color. It is classified by the ATF as armor-piercing (AP) handgun ammunition, and its sale is currently restricted by FN to military and law enforcement customers.|$|E

5|$|Bismuth was {{purchased}} from the American Smelting and Refining Company {{of the highest}} purity that it could produce. It was sent to Hanford, where it was put in aluminum cans, and placed inside a reactor for 100 days. The canned slugs then shipped to Unit IV, where they were bathed in hydrochloric acid, which dissolved the aluminum. This formed <b>an</b> <b>aluminum</b> chloride solution that was disposed of, as it was highly radioactive due to iron and copper in the aluminum alloy. The bismuth slugs were then dissolved in aqua regia. This was too weak for electroplating the polonium, so the nitric acid was removed, and then the polonium deposited on bismuth by adding powdered bismuth. This resulted in a 100–1 concentration. This could then be repeated by dissolving in aqua regia again to achieve a 1000–1 concentration. This was again dissolved, and the polonium electroplated on platinum foils. The main problem with the process was that it required glass-lined containers due to the aqua regia, and mechanisms for safe handling of the radioactive material. The Dayton Project explored alternative purification methods that {{were found to be}} workable, but less efficient or safe.|$|E
5|$|The first {{hydropower}} plant {{was built in}} 1904 by a local entrepreneur. It was located {{in a small town}} outside of Reykjavík and produced 9 kW of power. The first municipal hydroelectric plant was built in 1921, and it could produce 1 MW of power. This plant single-handedly quadrupled the amount of electricity in the country. The 1950s marked the next evolution in hydroelectric plants. Two plants were built on the Sog River, one in 1953 which produced 31 MW, and the other in 1959 which produced 26.4 MW. These two plants were the first built for industrial purposes and they were co-owned by the Icelandic government. This process continued in 1965 when the national power company, Landsvirkjun, was founded. It was owned by both the Icelandic government and the municipality of Reykjavík. In 1969, they built a 210 MW plant on the Þjórsá River that would supply the southeastern area of Iceland with electricity and run <b>an</b> <b>aluminum</b> smelting plant that could produce 33,000tons of aluminum a year.|$|E
