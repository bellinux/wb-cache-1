However, so long as the Japanese posed a threat to New Zealand's security, there was still political will for the 3rd Division to be maintained. With the Japanese no longer a meaningful concern to the country, New Zealand's increasing shortage of manpower resulted in the disbandment of the 3rd Division. As well as providing reinforcements for the 2nd New Zealand Division, at the time engaged in fighting in Italy, it allowed men to return to vital industries in New Zealand.|$|E

5|$|April 15, 2005, was the 58th {{anniversary of}} Jackie Robinson's major league debut. Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig officially {{declared}} that every April 15 would be designated as Jackie Robinson Day {{and it would}} be celebrated each year throughout Major League Baseball. Every ballpark in Major League Baseball in the United States celebrated Jackie Robinson Day, unlike in 2004 when it was only celebrated in 13 ballparks. Each ballpark showed a video tribute to Robinson, and many brought out Jackie Robinson Foundation scholars onto the field before the games. In Cincinnati, Ohio, Ken Griffey, Jr. spoke of how much every African-American baseball player owes Robinson, who was chosen by manager Branch Rickey to break the color line because of Robinson's inner courage and <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> his temper in check.|$|E

He would test her <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> secrets by telling her that his life was in danger and she should tell no one. To increase her resistance to the cold, Day instructed Sabrina to wade into Stowe Pool until the water reached her neck, then lie in the nearby meadow until her clothes and hair had dried in the sun. Finally, to test her resistance to luxury, he gave her a big box of handmade silk clothes and had her throw them on a fire. Day had limited success with these techniques. Sabrina became able to endure hot wax dripped on her arm without flinching, but she did tell others of his secret techniques, and could not help screaming whenever he fired his gun at her.|$|E

5|$|In 1878, the English Cart Horse Society was formed, and in 1884 {{changed its}} name to the Shire Horse Society. The Society {{published}} a stud book, with the first edition in 1878 containing 2,381 stallions and records dating back to 1770. Between 1901 and 1914, 5,000 Shires were registered each year with the society. The first Shires were imported to the United States in 1853, with large numbers of horses being imported in the 1880s. The American Shire Horse Association was established in 1885 to register and promote the breed. The Shire soon became popular in the United States, and almost 4,000 Shires were imported between 1900 and 1918. Approximately 6,700 Shires were registered with the US association between 1909 and 1911. Around the time of Second World War, increasing mechanisation and strict regulations on the purchase of livestock feed reduced the need for and <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> draught horses. Thousands of Shires were slaughtered and several large breeding studs closed. The breed fell to its lowest point in the 1950s and 1960s, and in 1955 fewer than 100 horses were shown at the annual British Spring Show.|$|E

Shortly after being commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army Reserve in May 1926, Shoup applied, and was offered a commission in the Marine Corps. In August 1926 he resigned his commission in the Army and traveled from Camp Knox, Kentucky, to Chicago, Illinois, for physical exams. On 25 August 1926, {{he arrived at the}} Marine Corps barracks at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, where he was commissioned as a second lieutenant, and commenced Marine Officers Basic School. Shoup maintained that he had never previously considered a military career and had only chosen to become a military officer for the pay. Throughout his service, he excelled in athletics and marksmanship, and during his early career he would coach recreational athletic teams in addition to his regular assignments. He quickly established himself as an assertive and demanding leader, impressing both his commanders and his subordinates. Despite his no-nonsense demeanor, those he commanded later recalled his <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> morale with his sense of humor.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Thesis is to {{research}} the literature of thrust allocation, thruster modelling and maneuvering design, {{as well as to}} design and simulate various dynamic thrust allocation algorithms. Vessels with dynamic positioning (DP) systems are high in demand in multiple industries due <b>to</b> their good <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> position. An important component of the DP system is thrust allocation; algorithms which transform desired forces in surge, sway and yaw into thruster setpoints and rotation angles. Two dynamic thrust allocation algorithms are developed, and a simulation model of a model vessel is developed and used to test the thrust allocation algorithms. Findings indicate that the more complex the algorithms are, the more oscillatory the transients become. In addition, numerical instability is a significant concern because of the sensitivity of the barrier function used. Nonetheless, dynamic thrust allocation represents a powerful way to handle saturations. </p...|$|R

Among them include food stall and burger stall operators, night market hawkers, grocery store operators as well as construction and small service activities works. The study seeks to explore why some micro-entrepreneurs still lag in entrepreneurship and what needs to be rectified. This quantitative study is conducted on 173 Malay micro-enterprise owners (MEOs) and 58 Malay failed microenterprise owners (FMEOs) involved in all range of businesses throughout the state of Perak, Malaysia. The main aims are to identify the gaps between the failed micro-enterprise owners (FMEOs) and existing micro-enterprise owners (MEOs) and the problems faced among FMEOs. The results reveal that the MEOs had strong motivations and better marketing approaches as compared to FMEOs. Furthermore, the FMEOs failed in the business ventures mainly due to lack of management, sales and marketing skills and poor competitive <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> up with rivals.
