What types of conflicts and what consequences do teachers practice? This study is based on these following questions: Is there any difference for solving/measure for students with psychosocial problems or ADHD in a conflict or does teachers still works with the same methods? What types of conflict solving does schools use? What is important to consider with students in a small class who has psychosocial problems and ADHD to prevent conflicts? Summary: To answer my questions in this study, I´ve used qualitative methods, interviews and observations. I have used my cellphone for recording the interviews so that all content from the informers are accurate. My theoretical points concerns on having strict rules both inside and outside the classroom. Teachers in school use first one method in conflict solving, a need based approach, which means that teachers first listens to the involved students and interacts thereafter. Every school in Sweden has a document called Plan for equal treatment, which guides teachers on how to deal with conflicts. They also use other rapports such as <b>arrangement</b> <b>plan</b> and incident rapport. The conclusion of my study is that children with psychosocial problems do feel better harmony with strict rules. They need guidance and goals so they know what to do and what is expected of them. If the rules bend, it is more likely that conflicts and other disorder in the classroom emerges...|$|E
40|$|There {{are some}} {{expressions}} referring to future time in English because English has no 'future tense' {{equivalent to that}} of Latin or French. In general, English has six types of future expressions. However, all of the expressions do not indicate the same meaning. Each of the expressions has some different usages. The progressive aspect originally refers to 'action in progress' and when it expresses futurity the present progressive means 'future arising from present <b>arrangement,</b> <b>plan</b> or programme'. The combination of be going to with the infinitive generally has two meanings : 'future fulfilment of a present intention' and 'future result of a present cause'. In this paper we {{make it clear that}} be going to implies 'intention' and 'sign'. The modal auxiliary will always means 'modality'. The type of 'modality' can be divided into two : 'root' and 'epistemic'. Each type of 'modality' has a specific meaning; with respect to will the root modality means 'volition' and the epistemic modality means 'prediction'. The event expressed by the present progressive can never be changed by anyone. And be going to only indicates the present 'sign' that the event expressed by be going to will occur or the speaker's 'intention' of present time. It is least certain whether the event referred to by these two expressions will really happen. The construction be going to is regarded as 'present-oriented', whereas will as 'futureoriented'. In order to connect future time with present time be going to occurs first, and then will follows. The sentence containing will is considered as 'elliptical' without a conditional clause. The auxiliary will frequently occurs in the apodosis, because will needs some conditionally. While will is rare in the protasis, be going to is often used there. In this case, will or be going to expresses the meaning of root modality...|$|E

40|$|Unmanned {{ships are}} a new concept in the {{maritime}} sector. The concept of unmanned ships is driven by safety of life, cost and the shortage in seafarers. However, it is uncertain how the change from manned to unmanned ships in?uences the design and exploitation of the ship. Therefore, the in?uences on the ship will be researched in this thesis. The results from this thesis {{can be used by}} various organizations, researchers, and designers, to determine whether the concept of unmanned ships is feasible. The main question is: What are the in?uences of unmanned shipping on the design considerations and what cost saving can be achieved by removing crew related equipment and the crew itself from merchant ships? First, it has been researched how the design requirements change under international law. The design spiral has been used to identify the parts of the ship design that change, because of the changed requirements. These parts are: deadweight, lightweight, powering, machinery selection, general arrangement and costing. To quantify the change in deadweight, lightweight and powering, a parametric study has been carried out and applied to di?erent sized ships. Additionally, an analysis on what additional equipment should be installed on the ship, to make unmanned shipping possible, has been performed. Furthermore, a cost analysis has been carried out to quantify the cost savings associated with the removal of the equipment which is no longer needed for unmanned shipping. The change in cost is the budget for additional equipment required for unmanned shipping. For the cost analysis, building cost, maintenance cost, fuel saving, manning cost, insurance cost, depreciation cost and interest cost have been taken into account. The cost analysis has been applied to di?erent sizes of ships. Subsequently, the parametric study and cost analysis have been applied to a speci?c case. In addition the change in capacity, dimensions, trim, stability, seakeeping, general <b>arrangement</b> <b>plan</b> and tonnage have been analyzed. To check the sensitivity of the results, a sensitivity study for uncertain parameters has been performed. The di?erent analyses showed that the change in weight and power is minimal, but that the saving in cost is signi?cant. In conclusion, it can be stated that a signi?cant cost reduction can be achieved by removing the accommodation and related systems from ships.

40|$|The term Łódź region {{connected}} to the regional organization of the country appears in 1999 according to {{the organization of the}} EU countries. It refers to the Łódź voivodeship which has functioned, within a bit different borders however, since 1919 with a small break from 1975 to 1999. The above mentioned voivodeship is not a natural region of either physical or geographical properties as it is situated in the main watershed of Poland, in the keystone of the watersheds of three rivers: Bzura, Pilica and Warta. Nor is it a homogeneous historical unity. After all historical divisions corresponded with neither geographical nor cultural properties of regions. What is extremely interesting about the history of Łódź {{is the fact that it}} was established in such a place which created a center of rapidly developing economic region. The next historical paradox is that the administrative distinction of the region as well as a formal recognition of Łódź as its capital happened in a time when the conditions supporting the development of the city and region changed dramatically due to the World War I. Since then Łódź has been in a state of permanent restructuring linked with making up for the civilization losses occurred in the nineteenth-century city eruption. The insufficiency of the restructuring actions towards the historical part of the city as well as uncoordinated development of its outer area (which was the outcome of mistakes in planning and land development) led to a regression phase of the city and its region in the final period of industrial age (which was also the end of the communist regime). Study of conditions and urban arrangement directions of the city of Łódź accepted by the Łódź City Council in 2002 (main designer – Mirosław Wiśniewski), which the talk will touch upon, as well as the Voivodeship <b>arrangement</b> <b>plan</b> passed by the Same of Lodz Voivodeship in the same year describe not only the scale of the development problems but also the aims of the land policy. Apart from the problems of the material sphere, the most crucial point at present is, as the research shows (Krystyna Rembowska), the problem of low territorial consciousness, ( [...] .) feeling of our own territorial distinction and our own territorial group – the problem of lack of identity. The paper suggests that the material evidence (architectural heritage) as well as the elements of the „founding myth” of the city and region should be used in a greater degree in the process of building the regional identity. Those two points would help present the role which the strategy of the Polish Kingdom government played in the years 1815 – 1830 in the beginning of the development of industrial Łódź – especially an ingenious plan of the Head of Mazowieckie Voivodeship Committee (Voivode) - Rajmund Rembieliński. The paper also includes the thesis that Rembieliński, while establishing a set of industrial cities and creating the conditions for their development, very accurately predicted the future structure of the set. As a „background” of the region capital he used the already existing „colonies”, which were being established from the Poniatowski’s period to the times of the Prussian annexation (1793 - 1807) as well as private industrial cities build in the times of the Duchy of Warsaw (Ozorków) and the beginnings of the Polish Kingdom (Aleksandrów Łódzki and Zduńska Wola). He made the right choice of the place for the region capital by localizing its center first in Zgierz (1820) and right after that (in the years 1823 - 25) in Łódź. The choice was much better than the one by the Prussian authorities which wanted to make Nowosolna a capital. A very rapid development of Zgierz confirmed the correctness of the decision. Yet it was seen even better in Łódź, where its founder equipped the city in an unmatched assets based on a well-thought-of strategy and a finessed work. Among the most essential ones we can mention: spatial form of the city organism which was strictly subjected to the production needs and territorial immensity of the areas designed specifically for industry with specially arranged cascade of Jasień river to receive important clients. Moreover we must mention the invitation of important industrialists of those times since the very establishment of the city and, last but not least, taking into consideration the production of cotton fabrics in the city development plan. The author also advances a thesis that Rembieliński, having noticed the beginnings of the industrial region as well as having localized and adapted a place of the greatest potential for becoming a central point of the region, managed to anticipate and put into practice the ideas set in the theory (established over one hundred years later) by Walter Christaller (Die Zentralen Orte in Suddeutschland, Iena 1933) ...|$|E
