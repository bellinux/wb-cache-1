25|$|Norvasc (<b>amlodipine),</b> an {{antihypertensive}} drug of the dihydropyridine {{calcium channel blocker}} class. <b>Amlodipine</b> is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{a list of the}} most important medication needed in a basic health system.|$|E
25|$|In May 2014, Publix began {{offering}} <b>Amlodipine,</b> a {{calcium channel blocker}} used to treat {{high blood pressure and}} chest pain (angina) as a free medication. Customers can get a 90-day supply of this medication (up to 180 2.5-mg or 5-mg tablets, or 90 10-mg tablets) free of charge.|$|E
25|$|Simvastatin is {{contraindicated}} with pregnancy, breastfeeding, {{and liver}} disease. Pregnancy must be avoided while on simvastatin due to potentially severe birth defects. Patients cannot breastfeed while on simvastatin due to potentially disrupting the infant's lipid metabolism. High doses of simvastatin are also contraindicated with the widely used antihypertensive <b>amlodipine.</b> A lower dose is also recommended in people taking the calcium channel blockers, verapamil and diltiazem, {{as well as}} those taking amiodarone.|$|E
25|$|Vasodilators – {{calcium channel}} blockers, {{such as the}} dihydropyridines {{nifedipine}} or <b>amlodipine,</b> preferably slow release preparations – are often first line treatment. They have the common side effects of headache, flushing, and ankle edema; {{but these are not}} typically of sufficient severity to require cessation of treatment. The limited evidence available shows that calcium channel blockers are only slightly effective in reducing how often the attacks happen. Peoples whose RP is secondary to erythromelalgia often cannot use vasodilators for therapy as they trigger 'flares' causing the extremities to become burning red due to there being too much blood.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} {{a wide variety of}} drugs that can trigger dysgeusia, {{including}} zopiclone, H1-antihistamines, such as azelastine and emedastine. Approximately 250 drugs affect taste. The sodium channels linked to taste receptors can be inhibited by amiloride, and the creation of new taste buds and saliva can be impeded by antiproliferative drugs. Saliva can have traces of the drug, giving rise to a metallic flavor in the mouth; examples include lithium carbonate and tetracyclines. Drugs containing sulfhydryl groups, including penicillamine and captopril, may react with zinc and cause deficiency. Metronidazole and chlorhexidine have been found to interact with metal ions that associate with the cell membrane. Drugs that prevent the production of angiotensin II by inhibiting angiotensin converting enzyme, eprosartan for example, have been linked to dysgeusia. There are few case reports claiming calcium channel blockers like <b>Amlodipine</b> also cause dysguesia by blocking calcium sensitive taste buds.|$|E
25|$|The main {{goals of}} {{treatment}} in angina pectoris are relief of symptoms, slowing {{progression of the}} disease, and reduction of future events, especially heart attacks and death. Beta blockers (e.g., carvedilol, propranolol, atenolol) have {{a large body of}} evidence in morbidity and mortality benefits (fewer symptoms, less disability and longer life) and short-acting nitroglycerin medications have been used since 1879 for symptomatic relief of angina. Calcium channel blockers (such as nifedipine (Adalat) and <b>amlodipine),</b> isosorbide mononitrate and nicorandil are vasodilators commonly used in chronic stable angina. A new therapeutic class, called If inhibitor, has recently been made available: Ivabradine provides pure heart rate reduction leading to major anti-ischemic and antianginal efficacy. ACE inhibitors are also vasodilators with both symptomatic and prognostic benefit. Statins are the most frequently used lipid/cholesterol modifiers, which probably also stabilize existing atheromatous plaque. Low-dose aspirin decreases the risk of heart attack in patients with chronic stable angina, and was part of standard treatment. However, in patients without established cardiovascular disease, the increase in hemorrhagic stroke and gastrointestinal bleeding offsets any benefits and it is no longer advised unless the risk of myocardial infarction is very high.|$|E
2500|$|... {{calcium channel}} {{blockers}} (antihypertensives such as nifedipine, <b>amlodipine,</b> and verapamil). The dihydropyridine derivative isradipidine can replace nifedipine {{and does not}} induce gingival overgrowth.|$|E
2500|$|The {{effects of}} drug-related dysgeusia {{can often be}} {{reversed}} by stopping the patient's regimen of the taste altering medication. In one case, a forty-eight-year-old woman who was suffering from hypertension was being treated with valsartan. Due to this drug's inability to treat her condition, she began taking a regimen of eprosartan, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist. Within three weeks, she began experiencing a metallic taste and a burning sensation in her mouth that ceased when she stopped taking the medication. When she began taking eprosartan on a second occasion, her dysgeusia returned. In a second case, a fifty-nine-year-old man was prescribed <b>amlodipine</b> in order to treat his hypertension. After eight years of taking the drug, he developed a loss of taste sensation and numbness in his tongue. When {{he ran out of}} his medication, he decided not to obtain a refill and stopped taking <b>amlodipine.</b> Following this self-removal, he reported experiencing a return of his taste sensation. Once he refilled his prescription and began taking <b>amlodipine</b> a second time, his taste disturbance reoccurred. These two cases suggest that there is an association between these drugs and taste disorders. This link is supported by the [...] "de-challenge" [...] and [...] "re-challenge" [...] that took place in both instances. It appears that drug-induced dysgeusia can be alleviated by reducing the drug's dose or by substituting a second drug from the same class.|$|E
50|$|Several drugs {{interact}} with amplodipine to increase levels of <b>amlodipine</b> in the body. CYP3A inhibitors, by nature of inhibiting the enzyme that metabolizes <b>amlodipine,</b> CYP3A4, {{is one such}} drug. Others include the calcium-channel blocker diltiazem, the antibiotic clarithromycin, and possibly some antifungals. <b>Amlodipine</b> also causes several drugs to increase in levels, including cyclosporine, simvastatin, and tacrolimus (the increase in the last one being more likely in people with CYP3A5*3 genetic polymorphisms). When more than 20 mg of simvastatin, a lipid-lowering agent, is given with <b>amlodipine,</b> {{there is also an}} increased risk of myopathy. Giving <b>amlodipine</b> with Viagra increases the risk of hypotension.|$|E
50|$|<b>Amlodipine,</b> {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Norvasc among others, is a {{medication}} used to treat {{high blood pressure and}} coronary artery disease. While calcium channel blockers are not typically recommended in heart failure, <b>amlodipine</b> may be used if other medications are not sufficient for high blood pressure or heart related chest pain. <b>Amlodipine</b> is taken by mouth and has an effect for at least a day.|$|E
50|$|<b>Amlodipine</b> is used {{to treat}} {{hypertension}} in cats and dogs. In cats, it {{is considered to be}} the first line of treatment due to its high success rate and few side effects. Systemic hypertension in cats is often a sign of another illness, and <b>amlodipine</b> is most often given to cats with kidney disease, which causes high blood pressure by increase local RAAS activity <b>Amlodipine</b> decreases proteinuria in most cats with chronic kidney disease; and is sometimes given together with an ACE inhibitor, which prevents potential damage to the glomeruli. While <b>amlodipine</b> is used in dogs, it is often as add-on to ACE inhibitors, which are the first line of drugs for canine hypertension. <b>Amlodipine</b> is used more commonly to treat congestive heart failure in dogs, as well as mitral valve regurgitation. Side effects are quite rare, but cats on <b>amlodipine</b> have a possibility of developing azotemia (high concentration of nitrogen), hypokalemia, reflex tachycardia, lethargy, and weight loss. In dogs, it acts as a diuretic, and chronic use can lead to gingival hyperplasia.|$|E

50|$|Pfizer's patent {{protection}} on Norvasc lasted until 2007; total patent expiration occurred later in 2007. A number of generic versions are available. In the United Kingdom, tablets of <b>amlodipine</b> from different suppliers may contain different salts. The {{strength of the}} tablets is {{expressed in terms of}} <b>amlodipine</b> base, i.e., without the salts. Tablets containing different salts are therefore considered interchangeable. The efficacy and tolerability of a fixed-dose combination of <b>amlodipine</b> and perindopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, have recently been confirmed in a prospective, observational, multicentre trial of 1250 hypertensive patients.|$|E
50|$|The only {{absolute}} contraindication to <b>amlodipine</b> is {{an allergy}} to <b>amlodipine</b> {{or any other}} dihydropyridines. There are several other situations, however, where <b>amlodipine</b> generally should not be used. In patients with cardiogenic shock, where the heart's ventricles {{are not able to}} pump enough blood, calcium channel blockers exacerbate the situation by preventing the flow of calcium ions into cardiac cells, which is required for the heart to pump. While it is generally safe to use in patients with aortic stenosis (narrowing of the aorta where it meets the left ventricle) since it doesn't inhibit the ventricle's function, it can still cause collapse in cases of severe stenosis. In unstable angina (excluding variant angina), <b>amlodipine</b> can cause a reflex increase in cardiac contractility (how hard the ventricles squeeze) and heart rate, which together increase the demand for oxygen by the heart itself. Patients with severe hypotension can have their low blood pressure exacerbated, and patients in heart failure can get pulmonary edema. Those with impaired liver function are unable to metabolize <b>amlodipine</b> to its full extent, giving it a longer half-life.|$|E
50|$|<b>Amlodipine</b> {{has been}} studied in healthy volunteers {{following}} oral administration of 14C-labelled drug. <b>Amlodipine</b> is well absorbed by the oral route with a mean oral bioavailability around 60%; the half-life of <b>amlodipine</b> is about 30 h to 50 h, and steady-state plasma concentrations are achieved after 7 to 8 days of daily dosing. Its long half-life and high bioavailability are largely in part of its high pKa (8.6); it is ionized at physiological pH, and thus can strongly attract proteins. It is slowly metabolized in the liver by CYP3A4, with its amine group being oxidized and its side ester chain being hydrolyzed, resulting in an inactive pyridine metabolite. Renal elimination is the major route of excretion with about 60% of an administered dose recovered in urine, largely as inactive pyridine metabolites. However, renal impairment does not significantly influence <b>amlodipine</b> elimination.|$|E
50|$|Amlodipine/perindopril {{if using}} <b>amlodipine</b> alone caused edema. Perindopril is a {{long-lasting}} ACE inhibitor.|$|E

50|$|Various {{clinical}} {{studies have shown}} that levamlodipine has more selectivity and better efficacy than (R)-amlodipine. In pooled data, from three comparative studies conducted in 200 patients with mild to moderate hypertension, 2.5 mg of levamlodipine was found to be equivalent in its blood pressure lowing efficacy to 5 mg of <b>amlodipine.</b> The average reduction in systolic BP was 19±3 vs 19±4, 20±2 vs 19±3 and 20±2 vs 19±3 mm of Hg recorded in standing, supine and sitting position respectively for levamlodipine compared to racemic <b>amlodipine.</b> The studies also reported a significant reduction in total cholesterol and triglyceride levels with levamlodipine, which was not seen with <b>amlodipine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Levamlodipine (INN), {{also known}} as levoamlodipine or S-amlodipine is a {{pharmacologically}} active enantiomer of <b>amlodipine.</b> <b>Amlodipine</b> belongs to the dihydropyridine group of calcium channel blocker used as an antihypertensive and antianginal agent. Levamlodipine is currently marketed in Russia under the brand name EsCordi Cor (Actavis Pharma) and in India under the trade names Eslo (Zuventus Healthcare Ltd.), Asomex (Emcure Pharmaceutical Ltd.), and Espin (Intas Pharmaceuticals Ltd.).|$|E
50|$|The Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial {{showed the}} {{benefits}} of taking the two drugs perindopril and <b>amlodipine</b> together. About 9000 British patients aged 40 to 79 {{were involved in the}} five-year trial. Half were given the new drug combination; the rest were given traditional drugs. Perindopril and <b>amlodipine</b> were found to be so effective, the trial was stopped early so all patients could receive the combination.|$|E

50|$|Suspect drugs include isotab (isosorbide nitrate), lipitor (atorvastatin calcium), cardiovestin (simvastatin), alfagril (clopidogrel), concort (<b>amlodipine),</b> and soloprin (aspirin).|$|E
50|$|<b>Amlodipine</b> {{is used in}} the {{management}} of hypertension and coronary artery disease in people with either stable angina (where chest pain occurs mostly after physical or emotional stress) or vasospastic angina (where it occurs in cycles) and without heart failure. It can be used as either monotherapy or combination therapy for {{the management}} of hypertension or coronary artery disease. <b>Amlodipine</b> can be administered to adults and children 6-17 years of age.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Amlodipine</b> {{blocks the}} transmembrane influx of calcium into the {{vascular}} and cardiac smooth muscles resulting in vasodilation and hence a fall in blood pressure. Levamlodipine is an allosteric modulator and acts on the L-type of calcium channels. [...] Receptor binding {{studies have shown}} that out of the two forms only the (S)-enantiomer of <b>amlodipine</b> binds to and blocks L-type calcium channels whereas the (R)-enantiomer has no activity on these channels.|$|E
50|$|Examples include Class I agents (e.g., verapamil), Class II agents (e.g., <b>amlodipine,</b> nifedipine), or the Class III agent diltiazem.|$|E
