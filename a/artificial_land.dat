Soil water plays {{a critical role}} influencing vegetation-restoration processes, but varies with temporal and spatial characteristics, of concern to many researchers. However, few studies consider the influence of deep soil water and varied weather patterns in a semi-arid region. Four vegetation types chosen for this study include artificial caragana shrubland, artificial alfalfa grassland, naturally restored vegetation land (Artemisia capillaries, Agropyron chistatum, Heteropapus altaicus Novop, Stipa bungeana, Stipa breviflora griseb and Lespedeza davurica), and bare land. Soil-water content at the top 400 cm depth was monitored continuously from 2004 to 2007 using a neutron probe. Water and wind soil erosion were investigated gravimetrically. Results showed that soil water varied greatly during May through October with different land-use types and annual precipitations. Soil water reached a lower level in both <b>artificial</b> vegetation <b>lands</b> in dry years but recharged with great variation in normal years. Soil water in two other lands tended to have similar changes with less variation {{as compared with the}} <b>artificial</b> vegetation <b>lands.</b> Soil water was intensively consumed with depth and continuously decreased in the deeper layers under the two artificial vegetations. The consumption in the artificial caragana shrubland was more intensive, while that in the artificial alfalfa grassland took place at greater depths. The naturally restored vegetation land had less soil-water consumption (close to the level in the bare land) as compared with the <b>artificial</b> vegetation <b>lands.</b> Soil-water content and its variability were increased along the slope with less variation over time.

6000|$|On leaving Genoa I {{repaired}} to Spezia, chiefly {{with a view}} of [...] . accomplishing {{a sentimental}} pilgrimage, which I in fact achieved in the most agreeable conditions. The Gulf of Spezia is now the headquarters of the Italian fleet, and there were several big iron-plated frigates riding at anchor in front of the town. The streets were filled with lads in blue flannel, who were receiving instruction at a schoolship in the harbour, and in the evening-- there was a brilliant moon--the little breakwater which stretched out into the Mediterranean offered a scene of recreation to innumerable such persons. But this fact is {{from the point of view}} of the cherisher of quaintness of little account, for since it has become prosperous Spezia has grown ugly. The place is filled with long, dull stretches of dead wall and great raw expanses of <b>artificial</b> <b>land.</b> It wears that look of monstrous, of more than far-western newness which distinguishes all the creations of the young Italian State. Nor did I find any great compensation in an immense inn of recent birth, an establishment seated on the edge of the sea in anticipation of a passeggiata which is to come that way some five years hence, the region being in the meantime of the most primitive formation. The inn was filled with grave English people who looked respectable and bored, and there was of course a Church of England service in the gaudily-frescoed parlour. Neither was it the drive to Porto Venere that chiefly pleased me--a drive among vines and olives, over the hills and beside the Mediterranean, to a queer little crumbling village on a headland, as sweetly desolate and superannuated as the name it bears. There is a ruined church near the village, which occupies the site according to tradition) of an ancient temple of Venus; and if Venus ever revisits her desecrated shrines she must sometimes pause a moment in that sunny stillness and listen to the murmur of the tideless sea at the base of the narrow promontory. If Venus sometimes comes there Apollo surely does as much; for close to the temple is a gateway surmounted by an inscription in Italian and English, which admits you to a curious, and it must be confessed rather cockneyfied, cave among the rocks. It was here, says the inscription, that the great Byron, swimmer and poet, [...] "defied the waves of the Ligurian sea." [...] The fact is interesting, though not supremely so; for Byron was always defying something, and if a slab had been put up wherever this performance came off these commemorative tablets would be in many parts of Europe as thick as milestones.|$|E

Further, it is not well understood if the characteristics of AMF community assemblies differ for different habitat types, e. g., agricultural arable <b>land,</b> <b>artificial</b> forest <b>land,</b> natural grassland, and bush/wood land. Here, using the high-throughput technology by Illumina sequencing on the MiSeq platform, we explored the species diversity and composition of soil AMF communities among different habitat types in a semi-arid mountain (Taihang Mountain, Mid-western region of China). Then, we analyzed the effect of nutrient composition and soil texture on AMF community assembly. Our results showed that members of the Glomus genera were predominated in all soil types. The distance-based redundancy analysis indicated that the content of water, available phosphorus, and available potassium were the most crucial geochemical factors that significantly affected AMF communities (p <  0. 05). The analysis of the soil texture confirmed that AMF diversity was negatively correlated with soil clay content. The comparison of AMF diversity among the various habitat types revealed that the <b>artificial</b> forest <b>land</b> had the lowest AMF diversity in comparison with other land types. Our findings suggest that there were differences in species diversity and composition of soil AMF communities among different habitat types. These findings shed new light on the characteristics of community structure and drivers of community assembly in AMF in semi-arid mountains, and point to the potential importance of different habitat types on AMF communities...|$|R

The work focuses on issues related to Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) navigation, in particular in the areas of guidance and vision-based autonomous flight in situations of short and long term GPS outage. The thesis is divided into two parts. The first part presents a helicopter simulator and a path following control mode developed and implemented on an experimental helicopter platform.

Studies have shown that urban areas, compared to rural areas with less <b>artificial</b> <b>lands,</b> registered higher local temperatures as a result of Urban Heat Island (UHI) effects. Hong Kong {{is one of the most}} densely populated cities in the world with high portion of population residing in urbanized areas, hot/humid weather and densely built high-rise buildings created severe local thermal discomforts. To fully characterize the spatial and temporal aspects of UHI effects in Hong Kong, my study deployed 25 small, durable and low-cost logging sensors at various sites to take temperature/humidity measurements for 17 consecutive days throughout within a typical urban area of Hong Kong. With the aid of GIS and GPS, the measurements were mapped against the urban structures and land use to enable ratings of environmental settings at various sites. The respective meteorological conditions in duration were correlated with the sensors measurements for further evaluations and validations. This empirical study not only established the feasibility of employing the small and inexpensive logging sensors for widespread deployment but also confirmed the existence and the extent of microclimate variations of UHI in Hong Kong. These empirical data formed the bases of spatio-temporal examination of UHI effects in urbanized areas of Hong Kong. The study and the methodology have also paved a sound foundation and provided essential frameworks for further studies of UHI effects on local human comfort and environmental health of Hong Kong. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

This study {{was aimed at}} determining how agricultural landscape composition drives community diversity and composition of farmland birds in the characteristic bocage landscape in Brittany (NW France) on a broad scale. Using bird atlas data from the region (2004 – 2008; 10 x 10 km), we analyzed the importance of different components of agricultural landscape composition (types of crops, amount of semi-natural covers and elements, and <b>artificial</b> <b>lands)</b> on the alpha diversity and beta diversity of farmland birds of different functional groups, defined depending {{on the degree of}} farmland specialization and ecological requirements. Agricultural landscape composition features explained a small amount of variation in alpha and beta diversity, particularly for specialists and residents. Cereal crops were negatively correlated with alpha diversity of all the functional groups considered whereas rotational grasslands were negatively associated with migrant and insectivorous alpha diversity. Although shrublands are not common in Brittany, they were positively associated with the occurrence of some species and particularly with alpha diversity of all the functional groups but specialists and residents. At the spatial grain of analysis, community composition was mainly driven by a gradient of alteration of the bocage. To conclude, we claim for the consideration of regional idiosyncrasies in far-reaching planning schemes to prevent future biodiversity loss in agriculture-dominated landscapes due to agricultural intensification. In view of the observed large-scale trends gathered from atlas data analysis and the small amount of explained variation, we also advocate for subsequent finer scale bespoke surveys to determine the biodiversity status associated with the valuable bocage agricultural landscape...|$|R

40|$|Aim: To {{describe}} spatial {{patterns of}} Mediterranean butterfly species richness by functional groups, analyze their main landscape and climatic drivers, test {{the existence of}} extinction debt effects, and predict past species richness distributions using past climatic and landscape data. Location: A transect of 186 1 -km 2 quadrats in the Montseny region and surrounding plains {{in the area of}} Catalonia (NE Spain), located between the Mediterranean Sea and the Pyrenees mountains. Methods: From 2003 to 2010 we systematically recorded the presence of butterfly species in each quadrat for a total 123 different butterfly species. Times series data were analyzed for average monthly temperature and average monthly precipitation to determine significant trends in climate. Proportions of landscape types per quadrat were calculated for years 1956, 1993 and 2005. Using these geographic, climatic and landscape data for each quadrat, a generalized linear model was built to determine the significant factors affecting butterfly species richness patterns. Results: Butterfly species richness followed a hump-shaped pattern along the altitudinal gradient. The highest species richness occurred at an average elevation range between 600 and 800 m. Of the landscape and climatic data, species richness was best explained by the interaction of temperature and precipitation (quadratic effect) as well as the amount of <b>artificial</b> unproductive <b>land</b> (negative effect), natural unproductive land (positive effect), and meadows and pastures present (positive effect). No extinction debt was found using past climatic and landscape data from the 1950 s and 1990 s.

These effects could also be filtering out certain functional groups, selecting for species most suited to higher temperatures and urbanized areas (i. e. species with high temperature preference, high dispersal ability and most generalist in habitat specialization), particularly at lower elevations...|$|R
