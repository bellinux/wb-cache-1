First, we use geometric build-up and depth-first graph traversal. Next, we refine the solution by simulated annealing. For an exact but sparse distance matrix, the build-up method reconstructs the 3 D structures with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) {{in the order of}} 0. 1 Å. Small and medium structures (up to 10, 000 atoms) are computed in less than 10 seconds. For the largest structures (up to 100, 000 atoms), the build-up RMSE is 2. 2 A ̊ and execution time is about 540 seconds. The performance of our approach depends largely on the graph structure.

40|$|We {{observe that}} a nanostructured metal can be {{hardened}} by annealing and softened when subsequently deformed, {{which is in}} contrast to the typical behavior of a metal. Microstructural investigation points to an effect of the structural scale on fundamental mechanisms of dislocation-dislocation and dislocation-interface reactions, such that heat treatment reduces the generation and interaction of dislocations, leading to an increase in strength and a reduction in ductility. A subsequent deformation step may restore the dislocation structure and facilitate the yielding process when the metal is stressed. As a consequence, the strength decreases and the ductility increases. These observations suggest that for materials such as the nanostructured aluminum studied here, deformation should be used as an optimizing procedure instead of annealing.

To evaluate our heuristics we run simulations over real-world, large scale networks and compare them to our lower bound.
