5|$|A {{compound}} with antimicrobial {{activity was}} {{isolated from the}} ripening drupes of a hybrid of Persoonia linearis and P.pinifolia growing in the Australian National Botanic Gardens in 1994, <b>and</b> <b>identified</b> as 4-hydroxyphenyl 6-O--β--glucopyranoside.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} polyketide-type antioxidative compounds, cyathusals A, B, and C, and pulvinatal have been {{isolated}} <b>and</b> <b>identified</b> from the liquid culture of Cyathus stercoreus. Furthermore, the polyketides known as cyathuscavin A, B, and C (isolated from liquid culture) also have antioxidant activity, and have DNA protection activity.|$|E
5|$|Aqueous {{extracts}} of {{the fruit}} bodies contain polysaccharides that have been shown in laboratory tests to be highly efficient at inhibiting infection by tobacco mosaic virus. Several bioactive compounds have been isolated <b>and</b> <b>identified</b> from the mushroom, including allitol, stearic acid, furan-3-carboxylic acid, (22E,24R)-3β-hydroxyergosta-5,22-diene, 3β-hydroxy-5α,8α-epidioxy-24ξ-methylcholesta-6-ene, dihydrofuran-2,5-dione,3β-hydroxy-5α,8α-epidioxyergosta-6,22-diene, palmitic acid, uracil, cis-butenedioic acid, thioacetic anhydride, succinic acid, 1-ethylic-βD-glycoside, 2-acetamino-2-deoxy-β-D-glucose, and cerebrosideB.|$|E

5|$|In 1855, two English scientists, Joseph Dalton Hooker and Edward William Binney, {{made the}} first {{scientific}} description of coal balls in England, and the initial research on coal balls {{was carried out in}} Europe.

5|$|Mahalasa is {{also called}} Mhalsa, the consort of Khandoba, a local {{incarnation}} of Shiva. As the consort of Khandoba, her chief temple - the Mohiniraj temple - {{is located at}} Nevasa, where she is worshiped as a four-armed goddess <b>and</b> <b>identified</b> with Mohini. Mhalsa is often depicted with two arms and accompanying Khandoba on his horse or standing besides him.|$|E
5|$|Several {{bioactive}} secondary metabolites {{have been}} isolated <b>and</b> <b>identified</b> from Volvariella bombycina fruit bodies, mycelium, or pure culture. The compounds ergosta-4,6,8(14),22-tetraene-3-one, ergosterol peroxide, indole-3-carboxaldehyde, and indazole {{were found in}} liquid culture. In 2009, the novel compound isodeoxyhelicobasidin was identified from culture broth; this compound inhibits the enzyme human elastase. The fungus also produces compounds that have antioxidative activity.|$|E
5|$|Several {{chemical}} compounds—some {{with unique}} biological activity—have been isolated <b>and</b> <b>identified</b> from Hydnellum species. For example, Hydnellum peckii contains atromentin, a pigment with anticoagulant properties similar to heparin. Atromentin also possesses antibacterial activity, inhibiting the enzyme enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (essential for the biosynthesis of fatty acids) in the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae.|$|E

5|$|Three azo- and azoxyformamides {{compounds}} {{have been}} isolated <b>and</b> <b>identified</b> from the puffball and tested {{for their ability}} to inhibit the growth of plants: 4-methoxybenzene-1-ONN-azoxyformamide, 4-methoxybenzene-1-azoformamide, and 4-hydroxybenzene-1-azoformamide. Only the first compound was significantly inhibitory, suggesting that the presence of the azoxy moiety is required for growth inhibition.|$|E
5|$|A post-war {{review of}} rail {{transport}} in the London area produced {{a report in}} 1946 that proposed many new lines <b>and</b> <b>identified</b> the Morden branch as being the most overcrowded section of the London Underground, needing additional capacity. To relieve the congestion {{and to provide a}} new service south of Morden, the report recommended construction of a second pair of tunnels beneath the northern line's tunnels from Tooting Broadway to Kennington and an extension from Morden to North Cheam. Trains using the existing tunnels would start and end at Tooting Broadway with the service in the new tunnels joining the existing tunnels to Morden. The extension to North Cheam would run in tunnel. Designated as routes 10 and 11, these proposals were not developed by the London Passenger Transport Board or its successor organisations.|$|E
5|$|According to Richard Maxwell Eaton, {{author of}} A Social History of the Deccan, Vithoba was first worshipped as a {{pastoral}} god {{as early as}} the 6th century. Vithoba's arms-akimbo iconography is similar to Bir Kuar, the cattle-god of the Ahirs of Bihar, who is now also associated with Krishna. Vithoba was probably later assimilated into the Shaiva pantheon <b>and</b> <b>identified</b> with the god Shiva, like most other pastoral gods. This is backed by the facts that the temple at Pandharpur is surrounded by Shaiva temples (most notably of the devotee Pundalik himself), and that Vithoba is crowned with the Linga, symbol of Shiva. However, since the 13th century, the poet-saints like Namdev, Eknath and Tukaram identified Vithoba with Vishnu.|$|E

5|$|After the {{monument}} was discovered <b>and</b> <b>identified</b> {{in the twentieth}} century, a folk motif came {{to be associated with}} it. According to this story, the circle's stones had landed in their location after having been hurled at Corfe Castle by the Devil. This is a variant of a story that has also been connected to the Agglestone Rock near Studland. According to stories associated with this large sandstone block, it had been thrown by the Devil from The Needles on the Isle of Wight, with the intention of hitting either the castle, Sherborne Abbey, Bindon Abbey, or Salisbury Cathedral.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the metric}} system {{has changed and}} {{developed}} since its inception, its basic concepts have hardly changed. Designed for transnational use, it consisted of a basic set of units of measurement, now known as base units. Derived units were built up from the base units using logical rather than empirical relationships while multiples and submultiples of both base and derived units were decimal-based <b>and</b> <b>identified</b> by a standard set of prefixes.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the police}} were sure murder had taken place, and {{that at least one}} of the four was guilty, they were {{uncertain}} whether they could secure a conviction. Police also suspected there had been other murders committed, but the lack of bodies hampered this line of enquiry. As news of the possibility of other murders came to the public's attention, newspapers began to publish lurid and inaccurate stories of the crimes; speculative reports led members of the public to assume that all missing people had been victims. Janet Brown went to the police <b>and</b> <b>identified</b> her friend Mary Paterson's clothing, while a local baker informed them that Jamie Wilson's trousers were being worn by Constantine Burke's son. On 19 November a warrant for the murder of Jamie Wilson was made against the four suspects.|$|E
