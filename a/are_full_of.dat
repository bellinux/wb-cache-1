5|$|Johnson's {{publications}} {{were rarely}} luxury goods: he priced his merchandise competitively, but always within {{the reach of}} the middle class, the audience he most wanted to serve.

But as they were often printed extremely quickly to respond to a particular event, this was expected by his contemporaries.|$|E

In the evenings {{they went to}} small tavernas to enjoy the ambiance; {{all of which is}} {{recorded}} in the letters they sent home to Bauer's family. Bauer's sketchbooks <b>are</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> studies of antique objects and Renaissance art, some of which he used for his illustrations.
