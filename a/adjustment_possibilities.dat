In 1985, Rainer Küschall designed a completely new wheelchair which only weighed 14 {{instead of the usual}} 25 kilograms and had a volume that was 40% smaller. By reducing the weight and adding new <b>adjustment</b> <b>possibilities</b> for seated positions, Küschall increased the range of uses and the mobility of the wheelchair and established the now common monotube design. The product, which he called the Competition (known as Champion 3000 in the USA), was revolutionary at the time and {{is still one of the}} most copied basic designs for wheelchairs today. In 1986, Küschall received the award of the Museum of Modern Art. The Competition wheelchair was the first medical device added to the collection at the MoMA and is still exhibited there. One of its successor models weighs only 6.7 kilograms.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to empirically analyse the revenue-expenditure models of public finance by {{considering}} the possibility of non-linear and asymmetric adjustment. A long-run relationship between general government expenditure and revenues is identified for Italy. Following system-wide shocks, the estimated relationship adjusts slowly to equilibrium, mainly due to complex administrative procedures that add to the sluggishness of tax collection and undermine the effective monitoring of public spending. Exogeneity of public expenditure implies that taxes rather than spending, carry the burden of short-run adjustment to correct budgetary disequilibria. Allowing for non-linear <b>adjustment</b> and the <b>possibility</b> of multiple equilibria, our findings show evidence of asymmetric adjustment around a unique equilibrium. In particular, we find that when government expenditure is too high, adjustment of taxes takes places at a faster rate than when it is too low. Further, there is evidence of a faster adjustment when deviations from the equilibrium level get larger, pointing to a Leviathan-style, revenue-maximiser government...|$|R

Multiple equilibria are likely to occur, in particular if there are complementarities in the model. We demonstrate the existence of multiple discretionary equilibria by example.

Indeed, we argue that care policy reforms have been very closely linked to specific employment strategies, and the politics of welfare without work and subsequent attempts to shift away from such a labour-shedding strategy go a long way in explaining both the nature and the timing of child- and elder-care policy reforms in Bismarckian welfare systems. The article also shows how a focus on promoting ‘free choice’ in all four countries has justified the introduction of measures that have simultaneously reinforced social stratification in terms of access to the labour market – meaning that some women have much more ‘free choice’ than others – and weakened certain labour market rigidities. To conclude, we argue that care policy reforms have provided a backdoor for the introduction of labour-cheapening measures and for increasing employment flexibility in otherwise very rigid labour markets...|$|E

On the other hand, when the ranges of regions into which mobile individuals can move are expanded too much, all regions except the most productive region fall into coordination failure and the distributive inequality between immobile and mobile individuals increases very badly.

40|$|Much {{has been}} written about {{prospects}} for U. S. current account <b>adjustment,</b> including the <b>possibility</b> of what is sometimes referred to as a "disorderly correction": a sharp fall in the exchange rate that boosts interest rates, depresses stock prices, and weakens economic activity. This paper assesses some of the empirical evidence bearing on the likelihood of the disorderly correction scenario, drawing on the experience of previous current account adjustments in industrial economies. We examined the paths of key economic performance indicators before, during, and after the onset of adjustment, building on the analysis of Freund (2000). We found little evidence among past adjustment episodes of the features highlighted by the disorderly correction hypothesis. Although some episodes in our sample experienced significant shortfalls in GDP growth after the onset of adjustment, these shortfalls were not associated with significant and sustained depreciations of real exchange rates, increases in real interest rates, or declines in real stock prices. By contrast, it was among the episodes where GDP growth picked up during adjustment that the most substantial depreciations of real exchange rates occurred. These findings do not preclude the possibility that future current account adjustments could be disruptive, but they weaken the historical basis for predicting such an outcome.

40|$|PROBLEM This is my graduating thesis {{from the}} {{bachelor}} program in Industrial Design from Umeå Institute of design. In this project I {{have looked at}} in what way the future work wear for an extreme mine environment could improve safety, facilitate the workflow as well as increase the comfort for workers situated more than 1045 meters below ground. I have collaborated with LKAB in Kiruna, Sweden. LKAB is a mining company, exporting iron ore from the worlds largest underground iron ore mine. In the Kiruna mine, a new main level was recently opened {{at the level of}} 1365 meters. The extreme conditions down at this depth have created new challenges when it comes to work wear for the employees. METHODS AND FINDING RESULT During the project I have used several methods, all following a typical Industrial Design methodology. I started with visiting the mine, having a look at the entire process and talking to workes. After this I wrote a brief for the project, containing information on what the problem is today. I made an other trip to the mine to host a Pin-Point meeting and a workshop together with workers from different positions and work places within the mine. This to gain a further and more specific understanding in the problem -s. The workshop I hosted was to see what they themselves thought would be good solutions. Other methods I've used is survey, sketch ideation, evaluations with users, interviews, observations, visits to manufacturers, visit to the industrial wash / warehouse and mock-ups. I divided the problems in to categories: The fit of the clothes Ability to carry tools Material Functions / Adjustments The project has resulted in a concept of a new trouser and a new jacket for the workers at the LKAB iron or mine in Kiruna. The garments are of a lighter more durable material than the garments used today. The jacket and the trouser have now more specific pockets and are placed in better positions than earlier. I also tried to place seams better, this to avoid any discomfort and work related injuries. One of the problems today was that the jacket for some, created a pressure over the neck. I've added <b>adjustment</b> <b>possibilities</b> to the garments and inserted "softed" materials in some places to increase level of comfort. The result is portrayed as a full size model, in a women’s fit. RESULT The project has resulted in a concept of a new trouser and a new jacket for the workers at the LKAB iron or mine in Kiruna.

40|$|Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) {{has become}} an {{established}} approach for analyzing and comparing efficiency results of corporate organizations or economic agents. It has also found wide application in comparative studies on airport efficiency. The standard DEA approach to comparative airport efficiency analysis has two feeble elements, viz. a methodological and a substantive weakness. The methodological weakness originates from the choice of uniform efficiency improvement assessment, while the substantive weakness in airport efficiency analysis concerns the insufficient attention for short-term and long-term <b>adjustment</b> <b>possibilities</b> in the production inputs determining airport efficiency. The present paper aims to address both flaws by: (i) designing a data-instigated Distance Friction Minimization (DFM) model as a generalization of the standard Banker-Charnes-Cooper (BCC) model {{with a view to}} the development of a more appropriate efficiency improvement projection model in the BCC version of DEA; (ii) including as factor inputs also lumpy or rigid factors that are characterized by short-term indivisibility or inertia (and hence not suitable for short-run flexible adjustment in new efficiency stages), as is the case for runways of airports. This so-called fixed factor (FF) case will be included in the DFM submodel of DEA. This extended DEA – with a DFM and an FF component – will be applied to a comparative performance analysis of several major airports in Europe. Finally, our comparative study on airport efficiency analysis will be extended by incorporating also the added value of the presence of shopping facilities at airports for their relative economic performance.

40|$|The {{signs are}} {{increasing}} that the gain in {{greenhouse gas emissions}} {{since the beginning of}} the 20 th century causes the average global temperature to rise. Limiting the temperature rise to 2 °C should at least avoid the worst consequences of global warming. This would require the greenhouse gas emissions to reach their maximum value by no later than 2015 and to be dramatically reduced worldwide from that time until 2050. From the economic perspective, there are a number of important questions: In the first place, how can the initial situation be described in economic categories? Therefore, the emissions should first of all be identified by region and sector and thereupon, the <b>adjustment</b> <b>possibilities</b> are to be outlined. Which costs and which revenues are associated with climate policy? The bandwidth of the estimated damage is between 5 % and 20 % of global gross domestic product (GDP) annually in the case of unmitigated climate change. These estimates are compared to around 1 % of global GDP, which would be spent to stabilize the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. How are the global targets to be distributed regionally and sectorally, and which economic instruments are recommended for this purpose? Obviously, tradable permits are preferred. Here, the initial assignment and the nature of the allocation on the one hand and the tradability on the other play a prominent role. What politico-economic conflicts arise and what recommendations can economists give to solve these conflicts goal-oriented?

40|$|Andrew Fearne, Professor of Food Marketing and Supply Chain Management and a Director of the dunnhumby Academy of Consumer Research at Kent University, UK, is {{a current}} Thinker in the Adelaide Thinkers in Residence (ATIR) program. Professor Fearne is the 14 th person to {{undertake}} a Thinkers appointment. The residency theme, Food and Wine Value Chains: Prosperity through Collaboration, has provided a timely opportunity for partners, including wine companies, government agencies, universities, an industry association and a regional development board to review micro and macro strategies and policies from a value chain perspective. The residency was initiated to improve sustainable competitive advantage within South Australian food and wine value chains. Its timing has coincided with, and aligns with, community concern and national policy issues in grocery pricing, water policy, drought/climate change, health-wellbeing agendas, waste and food security; all converging and impacting on food and wine supply chains. The paper provides background about the Adelaide Thinkers in Residence program and partner objectives for the residency: it refers to other chain research involving Professor Fearne at dunnhumby and in Tasmania, where better insight to consumer behaviour {{is the basis for}} product and process <b>adjustment,</b> with the <b>possibility</b> of better outcomes for consumers and stakeholders; it outlines a major wine value chain analysis project in SA and identifies some main themes to emerge from this Thinker’s program. Professor Fearne will be reporting to the South Australian Government during 2009. value chain analysis, food and wine, planning and policy,...|$|R
40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the relationship}} between national climate change policy instruments and WTO rules with particular emphasis {{on the case of}} Germany. Our main finding is that national policies whose aim is to reduce greenhouse gases can be brought into compliance with international trade law. Compliance can be achieved, first, through various methods of labelling electricity from renewable resources. Second, it can be achieved through trading systems for green certificates that respect basic WTO principles. Third, it can be achieved through energy taxes. To offset the competitive impacts of such taxes, border tax <b>adjustments</b> are a <b>possibility.</b> Although WTO law has not yet clearly defined the eligibility of border tax adjustments for energy taxes, the balance of evidence suggests that it would support such adjustments under certain circumstances. Fourth, compliance with WTO rules can be achieved through financial incentives to the producers of energy from renewable sources which are conferred {{in such a way that}} they do not pass through the hands of the government. Hence, climate change policies can even rely on subsidies (in the economic sense) without getting into conflict with WTO rules. Fifth, when compliance cannot be achieved, national policies aiming at international environmental protection can claim an exception under GATT Article XX (b) or (g) if measures are not applied in an arbitrary or discriminatory manner. In addition, countries should further strive to find solutions to the global climate change problem in the Kyoto process. ...|$|R
