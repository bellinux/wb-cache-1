5|$|Mary Dudley {{said that}} if this were not true, I might be sure she would not {{say such a thing}} <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> cost her her life and she was acting now with the Queen's consent, but she (the Queen) would not speak to the Emperor's {{ambassador}} about it.|$|E
5|$|We are at {{this moment}} in doubt whether during the first shock we shall not say she is gone to Ireland to her aunts, a thing that had been in contemplation... What I have most of all in horror is the public papers; & I thank you for your caution <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> act on this.|$|E

5|$|After the conflict, Portland Castle was {{transferred}} to the Ministry of Works in 1949 and opened to the public in 1955. The Ministry decided to present the interior <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> have looked in the 16th century and removed most of the 19th- and 20th-century additions and changes. The Captain's House and the adjacent gardens were used by the neighbouring HMS Osprey helicopter base until 1999, but with the facility's closure, this part of the fort was also opened to visitors, the house being turned into a visitor facility.|$|E
5|$|English Heritage {{took over}} {{management}} of the castle in 1983, and stripped back 20th-century additions to present it <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> have appeared in 1914, including demolishing the old signal station tower. The site remains open to visitors and received 5,751 visitors in 2010. The castle is protected under UK law as a Grade II* listed building and as a scheduled monument. The air station's former hangars are still used as a recreation centre by Hampshire County Council.|$|E
5|$|Refined cuisine {{could be}} moralized {{as a sign}} of either civilized {{progress}} or decadent decline. The early Imperial historian Tacitus contrasted the indulgent luxuries of the Roman table in his day with the simplicity of the Germanic diet of fresh wild meat, foraged fruit, and cheese, unadulterated by imported seasonings and elaborate sauces. Most often, because of the importance of landowning in Roman culture, produce—cereals, legumes, vegetables, and fruit—was considered a more civilized form of food than meat. The Mediterranean staples of bread, wine, and oil were sacralized by Roman Christianity, while Germanic meat consumption became a mark of paganism, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> be the product of animal sacrifice.|$|E

5|$|Rolling {{a person}} with an active tonic-clonic seizure onto their side and into the {{recovery}} position helps prevent fluids from getting into the lungs. Putting fingers, a bite block or tongue depressor in the mouth is not recommended <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> make the person vomit or result in the rescuer being bitten. Efforts {{should be taken to}} prevent further self-injury. Spinal precautions are generally not needed.|$|E
5|$|The reentry {{phenomenology}} was {{of interest}} {{both to the}} Army, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> allow long-range decluttering to be carried out, and to the Air Force, whose own ICBMs might be at risk of long-range interception if the Soviets exploited a similar concept. A program to test these concepts was {{a major part of}} ARPA's Project Defender, especially Project PRESS, which started in 1960. This led to the construction of high-power radar systems on Roi-Namur, the northernmost point of the Kwajalein atoll. Although the results remain classified, several sources mention the failure to find a reliable signature of this sort.|$|E
5|$|The story survives {{through the}} Hundred Rolls, the great {{survey of the}} English {{hundreds}} made by Edward I, in 1274-5, on returning to his new kingdom from crusade. The scheme, impractical <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> seem, was supposedly based on contemporary sagas of Viking heroes. But the complaints of the local community {{were based on the}} fact that Southchurch had taken all the supplies home to his own manor of Southchurch, received 200 marks from the exchequer, yet never paid out any of what the owners of the goods were entitled to.|$|E

5|$|An Introduction was {{reviewed}} positively in several academic publications. The political philosopher Steve Cooke said that Cochrane's own approach showed promise, {{and that the}} book would have benefited from devoting more space to it. Robert Garner, a political theorist, praised Cochrane's synthesis of such {{a broad range of}} literature, but argued that the work was too uncritical of the concept of justice <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> apply to animals. Cochrane's account of interest-based rights for animals was subsequently considered at greater length in his 2012 book Animal Rights Without Liberation, published by Columbia University Press. An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory {{was one of the first}} books to explore animals from the perspective of political theory, and became an established part of a literature critical of the topic's traditional neglect.|$|E
5|$|The Fizeau {{interferometer}} {{is shown}} <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> {{be set up}} to test an optical flat. A precisely figured reference flat is placed {{on top of the}} flat being tested, separated by narrow spacers. The reference flat is slightly beveled (only a fraction of a degree of beveling is necessary) to prevent the rear surface of the flat from producing interference fringes. Separating the test and reference flats allows the two flats to be tilted with respect to each other. By adjusting the tilt, which adds a controlled phase gradient to the fringe pattern, one can control the spacing and direction of the fringes, so that one may obtain an easily interpreted series of nearly parallel fringes rather than a complex swirl of contour lines. Separating the plates, however, necessitates that the illuminating light be collimated. Fig6 shows a collimated beam of monochromatic light illuminating the two flats and a beam splitter allowing the fringes to be viewed on-axis.|$|E
5|$|The high-definition upgrade {{was not as}} {{difficult}} <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> have been as all the art assets had been created in high definition and reduced for the PS2 hardware. Other aspects for the visuals, such as character faces, needed to be redrawn by Kamitani as they remained in low definition. There were also graphic elements remade as the team considered them to be rather poor quality when compared to their current work. Added shadow effects were created, but special parameters needed {{to be set as}} there were no 3D environments to use as reference. The 2D perspective also meant that the way enemies behaved needed to be adjusted, so they would not attack the player character while still off screen. In general, the overall graphical quality was improved, the resolution was increased, and the aspect ratio was changed from the original 4:3 to 16:9. The shift to 16:9 meant that character models needed to be re-positioned so as not to leave blank spaces {{on either side of the}} central scene. As they needed to analyse the original software to make such changes but had lost the original software used to create the cutscenes, they needed to hurriedly create alternate editing software that ran on a PC. In addition to changes to scenery and model positioning, the text font was resized to match the larger screen and the text bubbles were smoothed out.|$|E

It has not developed trade and investment positions there as rapidly <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> have, and has shifted some Iran-related transactional flows into Renminbi to help the Obama administration avoid sanctioning Chinese banks (similarly, India now pays for some Iranian oil imports in rupees).|$|E

25|$|Both {{regulatory}} T {{cells and}} Th3 cells produce the cytokine transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) and IL-10. Both cytokines are inhibitory to helper T cells; TGF-β suppresses {{the activity of}} most of the immune system. There is evidence to suggest that TGF-β may not suppress activated Th2 cells as effectively <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> suppress naive cells, but it is not typically considered a Th2 cytokine.|$|E

However, on 25 May 2009 the party of Didier Ratsiraka withdrew from the talks.|$|E
25|$|Murdoch {{was more}} of an {{off-side}} player whose drives and cut strokes were regarded as among the best of his day; but his leg-side play was reputedly not so strong, and his ability against good spin bowling was not as impressive <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> be. Also, he was believed to be lacking in command against top-class pace bowling on difficult wickets; if conditions, were perfect, however, his batting often followed suit.|$|E
