5|$|Very {{little is}} known of Saint Padarn (or Paternus to use his Latin name), and almost nothing with <b>any</b> <b>degree</b> of certainty; the {{earliest}} literary reference to him is by Rhygyfarch in about 1097.

5|$|Due {{to lack of}} {{surviving}} documentation, {{it is difficult to}} attribute unsigned works from the period with <b>any</b> <b>degree</b> of certainty. The origin of the Crucifix has often been contested, but is generally thought to be by Cimabue based on stylistic traits and mentions by both Vasari and Nicolò Albertini. It is relatively primitive compared to his 1290s works and is thus believed to date from his early period. According to Vasari, the crucifix's success led to the commissions at Pisa, Tuscany that established his reputation.|$|E
5|$|Hale–Bopp was {{discovered}} on July 23, 1995 separately by Alan Hale and Thomas Bopp prior to it becoming naked-eye visible on Earth. Although predicting the maximum apparent brightness of new comets with <b>any</b> <b>degree</b> of certainty is difficult, Hale–Bopp met or exceeded most predictions when it passed perihelion on April 1, 1997. It was {{visible to the}} naked eye for a record 18months, twice as long as the previous record holder, the Great Comet of 1811. Accordingly, Hale–Bopp was dubbed the Great Comet of 1997.|$|E

5|$|Physeterids and Kogiids {{consist of}} sperm whales. Sperm whales consist {{the largest and}} {{smallest}} odontocetes, and spend {{a large portion of}} their life hunting squid. P. macrocephalus spends most of its life in search of squid in the depths; these animals do not require <b>any</b> <b>degree</b> of light at all, in fact, blind sperm whales have been caught in perfect health. The behaviour of Kogiids remains largely unknown, but, due to their small lungs, they are thought to hunt in the photic zone.|$|E
5|$|The care of {{offspring}} among amphibians {{has been}} little studied but, in general, the larger the number of eggs in a batch, the less {{likely it is that}} <b>any</b> <b>degree</b> of parental care takes place. Nevertheless, it is estimated that in up to 20% of amphibian species, one or both adults play some role in the care of the young. Those species that breed in smaller water bodies or other specialised habitats tend to have complex patterns of behaviour in the care of their young.|$|E
5|$|After he {{returned}} to the United States, 22-year-old Vonnegut married Jane Marie Cox, his high school girlfriend and classmate since kindergarten, on September 1, 1945. The pair relocated to Chicago; there, Vonnegut enrolled in the University of Chicago as an anthropology student (in an unusual five-year joint undergraduate/graduate program that only conferred the higher master's degree) on the G.I. Bill. He augmented his income by working as a reporter for the City News Bureau of Chicago at night. Jane accepted a scholarship from the university to study Russian literature as a graduate student. Jane dropped out of the program after becoming pregnant with the couple's first child, Mark (born May 1947), while Kurt also left the University without <b>any</b> <b>degree</b> (despite having completed his undergraduate education) when his master's thesis on the Ghost Dance religious movement was unanimously rejected by the department.|$|E

5|$|Although the collector's pieces sold well, the new dollars {{failed to}} {{circulate}} to <b>any</b> <b>degree,</b> except {{in and around}} Nevada casinos, where they took the place of privately issued tokens. There are no dollars dated 1975; coins from that year and from 1976 bear a double date 1776–1976, and a special reverse by Dennis R. Williams {{in honor of the}} bicentennial of American independence. Beginning in 1977, the Mint sought to replace the Eisenhower dollar with a smaller-sized piece. Congress authorized the Susan B. Anthony dollar, struck beginning in 1979, but that piece also failed to circulate. Due to their modest cost and the short length of the series, sets of Eisenhower dollars are becoming more popular among collectors.|$|E
5|$|Bristol notably {{does not}} award by title any bachelor's degrees in music, which is {{available}} for study but awarded B.A. (although it does award MMus and DMus), nor <b>any</b> <b>degree</b> in divinity, since divinity is not available for study (students of theology are awarded a B.A.). Similarly, the university does not award BLitt (Bachelor of Letters), although it does award both MLitt and DLitt. In regulations, the university does not name MD or DDS as higher doctorates, although they are in many universities as these degrees are normally accredited professional doctorates.|$|E

Alpha Phi's charter was immediately revoked and their chapter was placed on suspension. On November 13, the former Alpha Phi chapter formally reorganized as Mu Upsilon Alpha. On October 7, 2007, Mu Upsilon Alpha became a chapter of Mu Beta Psi.|$|E

5|$|She {{pointed out}} that when the {{discussion}} was reported to Washington, the leading US generals in the U.S. military lobbied Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, claiming {{that it was no}} longer feasible to work within the parameters laid out by Saigon and that the U.S. should simply take control of anti-communist military policy, thereby necessitating a coup. The Americans became increasingly concerned with Saigon's reluctance to intensify the war effort, and bombing rebuff was regarded as a critical point. The government's plans to win over the NLF were never implemented to <b>any</b> <b>degree</b> before the government was deposed.|$|E
5|$|The Solar System is chaotic over million- and billion-year timescales, {{with the}} orbits of the planets open to {{long-term}} variations. One notable example of this chaos is the Neptune–Pluto system, which lies in a 3:2 orbital resonance. Although the resonance itself will remain stable, it becomes impossible to predict the position of Pluto with <b>any</b> <b>degree</b> of accuracy more than 10–20million years (the Lyapunov time) into the future. Another example is Earth's axial tilt, which, due to friction raised within Earth's mantle by tidal interactions with the Moon (see below), will be incomputable at some point between 1.5 and 4.5 billion years from now.|$|E
5|$|Đính and {{the leading}} generals in the MRC {{also had a}} secret plan to end the {{communist}} insurgency, which called itself the National Liberation Front (NLF) and claimed to be independent {{of the government of}} North Vietnam. They claimed that most of them were first and foremost southern nationalists opposed to foreign military intervention and U.S. involvement and support of Diệm. The generals agreed with this viewpoint and thought that an agreement to end the war within South Vietnam was possible. The government also rebuffed American proposals to bomb North Vietnam on the grounds that such actions would cede the moral high ground, which they claimed on the basis of fighting in a purely defensive manner. However, the plans to bring the NLF into the mainstream were never implemented to <b>any</b> <b>degree</b> before the government was deposed.|$|E

5|$|In {{the fourth}} stratum, fragmentary remains of round or {{elliptical}} buildings were discovered. The potsherds {{found in this}} layer date it to Early Bronze Age. In the third stratum large elliptical buildings, {{very similar to the}} structures uncovered in the third stratum in an excavation near Kiryat Ata, were exposed. An abundance of broken storage vessels, in their original place, were found there. This pottery indicates that the building should be ascribed to an early phase of Early Bronze Age. In the second stratum, sections of minor construction and a few potsherds from diverse periods were found. The potsherds could not be attributed with <b>any</b> <b>degree</b> of certainty to the architectural remains. Early Bronze Age II, Intermediate Bronze Age, Middle Bronze Age and the Roman period stand out among the periods, to which these sherds are ascribed. A tomb attributed to the Middle Bronze Age was found; it contained scant remains of human bones and a bronze spearhead with a socket. The corner of a building that probably dated to the Early Roman period was discovered close to the surface {{in the eastern part of}} the excavation area.|$|E
5|$|The {{search by}} Europeans for a western {{shortcut}} by sea from Europe to Asia {{began with the}} voyages of Christopher Columbus in 1492 and continued through the mid-19th century with {{a long series of}} exploratory expeditions originating mainly in England. These voyages, when to <b>any</b> <b>degree</b> successful, added to the sum of European geographic knowledge about the Western Hemisphere, particularly North America, and as that knowledge grew larger, attention gradually turned toward the Arctic. Voyagers of the 16th and 17th centuries who made geographic discoveries about North America included Martin Frobisher, John Davis, Henry Hudson, and William Baffin. In 1670, the incorporation of the Hudson's Bay Company led to further exploration of the Canadian coasts and interior and of the Arctic seas. In the 18th century, explorers included James Knight, Christopher Middleton, Samuel Hearne, James Cook, Alexander MacKenzie, and George Vancouver. By 1800, their discoveries showed conclusively that no Northwest Passage navigable by ships lay in the temperate latitudes between the Pacific and the Atlantic Oceans.|$|E
5|$|Because And Yet It Moves was {{originally}} designed to be played with digital controls, the Wii Remote's analog motion controls needed to be implemented such that they felt natural and not intrusive. Broken Rules determined, following a number of tests, that allowing the player to freely rotate to <b>any</b> <b>degree</b> best suited motion controls; originally the player could only rotate in 90 degree intervals. Four different control schemes were implemented to satisfy a wide number of players, three of which either use motion control or the Wii Remote pointer. While the file size limit imposed on WiiWare games was not an issue, the visuals needed to be downsampled to cohere with the Wii hardware. A standard-definition television was used in development; Bohatsch felt the visuals looked nicer on the SDTV than on a PC or Mac with higher display resolution, but warned that some HDTVs might not upsample the Wii resolution properly, recommending that a component cable be used while playing the game. The online leaderboards were omitted from the Wii version because the PC version's leaderboards were not frequently used. Three new levels, unlocked when the player completes the main campaign mode, were added. The near {{final version of the}} game was submitted to Nintendo's Quality Assurance team in May 2010 to inspect and find bugs. And Yet It Moves was released on the Wii Shop Channel in North America on August 23, 2010 and then in Europe on August 27.|$|E
