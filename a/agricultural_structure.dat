50|$|The silver urn on the dexter (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) side {{refers to}} the true Celtic archaeological finds within Niederweiler’s limits. The ears of wheat on the {{sinister}} (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) side stand for the municipality’s <b>agricultural</b> <b>structure.</b> The “chequy” pattern in the middle is {{a reference to the}} village’s former allegiance to the County of Sponheim.|$|E
50|$|After the war, Breitenthal {{at first}} kept its rural, <b>agricultural</b> <b>structure.</b> With {{the growth of}} industrialization, though, farming came to be done only as a sideline; {{by the turn of}} the 21st century, there were only two {{full-time}} operations left. Although the village has expanded, the population figures have not changed much, despite the doubling of the number of residential buildings, including three designed for several families.|$|E
50|$|Albessen lies near Kusel in the Westrich - an {{historic}} region that encompasses areas in both Germany and France - {{on the state}} boundary with the Saarland, {{at the foot of}} the lengthy mixed forest area known as the Albesser Hain, after the municipality (Hain means “grove” in German). The municipality has a mainly <b>agricultural</b> <b>structure,</b> and is the smallest municipality within the Verbandsgemeinde of Kusel.|$|E

50|$|The {{building}} miraculously {{survived the}} French Revolution and the Revolt in the Vendée conserving its common buildings, <b>agricultural</b> <b>structures,</b> chapel and park. It also kept its archives and its furniture, which was studied by Pierre Verlet.|$|R
50|$|The rise of {{corporate}} <b>agricultural</b> <b>structures</b> directly affects small rural communities, resulting in decreased populations, decreased incomes for some segments, increased income inequality, decreased community participation, fewer retail outlets and less retail trade, and increased environmental pollution.|$|R
50|$|The ears {{of wheat}} {{refer to the}} municipality’s <b>agricultural</b> <b>structure,</b> while the spade recalls the {{hammermill}} called “Hammerbirkenfeld”, at which such articles were made. The lion charge below the line of partition is {{a reference to the}} village’s former allegiance to the Waldgraves and Rhinegraves, who had the greatest share of holdings in the village alongside the Electorate of Trier and the “Further” County of Sponheim.|$|E
50|$|Further {{countering}} {{accusations of}} anti-semitism {{is the fact}} that Allende entrusted two of the most important tasks of his government to Chilean Jews: Jacques Chonchol to direct and implemented the successful agrarian reform which completely transformed the country’s <b>agricultural</b> <b>structure,</b> and David Silberman Gurovich, {{who was in charge of}} consolidating the nationalization of the most important industry in the country, Codelco-Chuquicamata (the largest open-pit copper mine in the World).|$|E
50|$|Energy crops for {{biobutanol}} are grasses. Two leading non-food crops for {{the production}} of cellulosic bioethanol are switchgrass and giant miscanthus.There has been a preoccupation with cellulosic bioethanol in America as the <b>agricultural</b> <b>structure</b> supporting biomethane is absent in many regions, with no credits or bonus system in place. Consequently, a lot of private money and investor hopes are being pinned on marketable and patentable innovations in enzyme hydrolysis and the like.|$|E

50|$|In addition, Soviet {{authorities}} {{were met with}} resistance by the Korean elites - landlords, former colonial functionaries, and other figures who had previously enjoyed high social status during the Japanese occupation. Many of the landed elite with strong business influences were Christian nationalists. Farmers who were under Soviet protection gradually began to resist the landlords and the former <b>agricultural</b> <b>structure,</b> which aggravated the already heightened tensions between farmers and the landed elite.|$|E
50|$|Every year 64 {{students}} are admitted to B.Tech (Agriculture Engineering) {{course on the}} basis of their performance and ranking in the Common Entrance Test conducted by OUAT. The undergraduate course includes subjects on basic sciences like Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, English, Basic Engineering Courses, Computer Science and core engineering courses like Farm Machinery & Power, Soil & Water Conservation Engineering, Agricultural Processing & Food Engineering, <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Structure,</b> Civil & Environmental Engineering and Mechanical & Electrical Engineering etc.|$|E
50|$|The {{red cross}} on the dexter (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) side {{refers to the}} Electorate of Trier and the horn stands for the Imperial lordship of Beilstein. The axe is Saint Matthias’s attribute, thus {{representing}} the church’s patron saint. The green field tincture on which this charge appears refers to the municipality’s <b>agricultural</b> <b>structure.</b> The silver and red “chequy” pattern on the sinister (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) side is from the arms formerly borne by the “Hinder” County of Sponheim.|$|E
50|$|In 1985 in a {{campaign}} to reform the EC’s <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Structures</b> Directive, CPRE stopped funding for many damaging agricultural activities and secured the first “green” farm payments. In 1988 it helped persuade the Chancellor of the Exchequer to scrap tax incentives favouring blanket conifer plantations in scenic areas.|$|R
50|$|The Native Trust and Land Act, 1936 (Act No. 18 of 1936; {{subsequently}} {{renamed the}} Bantu Trust and Land Act, 1936 and the Development Trust and Land Act, 1936) in South Africa {{passed a law}} {{that served as the}} reorganization of its <b>agricultural</b> <b>structures.</b> This followed the recommendations of the Beaumont Commission.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{provides}} an overview and a comparison of land markets covering the three candidate countries for European Union membership: Croatia, the Former Yugoslav Republic (FYR) of Macedonia and Turkey. It analyses and compares <b>agricultural</b> land <b>structures</b> and factors driving land markets, based on the available cross-section and time-series evidence on <b>agricultural</b> land <b>structures</b> and land productivity (yields). The land productivity measured by production per hectare of agricultural land varies between the three countries. <b>Agricultural</b> land <b>structures</b> {{are the result of}} historical evolution in land markets and land-leasing developments with additional different institutional environments and agrarian and land reforms...|$|R
50|$|The {{charge on}} the dexter (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) {{side is a}} {{reference}} to the village’s former allegiance to the Waldgraves and Rhinegraves. The three lions rampant on the sinister (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) side are the arms formerly borne by the Lords of Senheim. As mentioned above, the latter ceded the village to the former on 14 June 1464. The endorse (vertical stripe, much thinner than a pale) was chosen to stand for the municipality’s <b>agricultural</b> <b>structure,</b> symbolized in the endorse’s tincture, vert (green).|$|E
5000|$|The {{emblem of}} Stephanskirchen {{was created in}} 1954 and {{indicates}} the historic dispartment: The holy Stephanus at the top symbolizes with his holy halo the area of Stephanskirchen. He holds a golden missal with tree golden stones in his left arm. The {{lower part of the}} emblem reminds of a dinghy, a so called [...] "Mutze". This is because in the past the major source of income in Schloßberg, Hofleiten and close to the inn-shore was fishing and shipping. The dominant green color within the emblem points to the <b>agricultural</b> <b>structure</b> of Stephanskirchen.|$|E
50|$|Another {{important}} economical {{and cultural}} {{factor is the}} three-level <b>agricultural</b> <b>structure</b> of the mountain-regions in Vorarlberg. It {{is also known as}} Alpine transhumance and describes a seasonal droving of grazing livestock between the valleys in winter and the high mountain pastures in summer. Many cultural habits like Yodel, Alphorn or Schwingen were developed during this time. This seasonal nomadism led to the rich culture, architecture and love for the nature in Vorarlberg. Moving the cattle to the high pasture and also retrieving them is always a big social highlight as the animals are richly decorated with flowers.|$|E

50|$|With military, religious, and <b>agricultural</b> <b>structures,</b> {{the site}} served {{at least a}} triple purpose. Researchers believe that Písac defended the {{southern}} entrance to the Sacred Valley, while Choquequirao defended the western entrance, and the fortress at Ollantaytambo the northern. Inca Pisac controlled a route which connected the Inca Empire with {{the border of the}} rain forest.|$|R
