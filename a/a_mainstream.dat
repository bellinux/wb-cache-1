5|$|A {{number of}} events in 2006 pushed {{renewable}} energy up the political agenda, including the US mid-term elections in November, which confirmed clean energy as <b>a</b> <b>mainstream</b> issue. Also in 2006, the Stern Review made a strong economic case for investing in low carbon technologies now, and argued that economic growth need not be incompatible with cutting energy consumption. According to a trend analysis from the United Nations Environment Programme, climate change concerns coupled with recent high oil prices and increasing government support are driving increasing rates of investment in the renewable energy and energy efficiency industries.|$|E
5|$|Beginning with Everybody's In Show-biz (1972), Ray Davies began {{exploring}} theatrical concepts on the group's albums; {{these themes}} became manifest on the 1973 album Preservation Act 1 and continued through Schoolboys In Disgrace (1976). The Kinks found little success with these conceptual works, and reverted {{to a traditional}} rock format throughout {{the remainder of the}} 1970s. Sleepwalker (1977), which heralded their return to commercial success, featured <b>a</b> <b>mainstream,</b> relatively slick production style that would become their norm.

5|$|Post-punk brought {{together}} a new fraternity of musicians, journalists, managers, and entrepreneurs; the latter, notably Geoff Travis of Rough Trade and Tony Wilson of Factory, helped {{to develop the}} production and distribution infrastructure of the indie music scene that blossomed in the mid-1980s. Smoothing the edges of their style {{in the direction of}} new wave, several post-punk bands such as New Order (descended from Joy Division) and the Cure. crossed over to <b>a</b> <b>mainstream</b> U.S. audience. Bauhaus was one of the formative gothic rock bands. Others, like Gang of Four, the Raincoats and Throbbing Gristle, who had little more than cult followings at the time, are seen in retrospect as significant influences on modern popular culture.|$|E

50|$|One {{potentially}} serious disadvantage to <b>mainstreaming</b> is that <b>a</b> <b>mainstreamed</b> {{student may}} require much more {{attention from the}} teacher than non-disabled students in a general class. Time and attention may thus {{be taken away from}} the rest of the class to meet the needs of a single student with special needs. The effect that <b>a</b> <b>mainstreamed</b> student has on the whole class depends strongly on the particular disabilities in question and the resources available for support. In many cases, this problem can be mitigated by placing an aide in the classroom to assist the student with special needs, although this raises the costs associated with educating this child.|$|R

5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet is <b>a</b> <b>mainstream</b> {{therapy that}} does not use pharmaceutical drugs, which was developed to reproduce the success and remove {{the limitations of the}} non-mainstream use of fasting to treat epilepsy. Although popular in the 1920s and 30s, it was largely abandoned in favour of new anticonvulsant drugs. Most individuals with epilepsy can successfully control their seizures with medication. However, 20–30% fail to achieve such control despite trying a number of different drugs. For this group, and for children in particular, the diet has once again found a role in epilepsy management.|$|E

The strike was called off after ten prisoners had starved themselves to death—including Sands, whose funeral was attended by an estimated 100,000people.

5|$|Grunge music hit the {{mainstream}} {{in the early}} 1990s with Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, and Nirvana being signed to major record labels. Grunge fashion began to break into mainstream fashion in mid-1992 for both sexes and peaked in late 1993 and early 1994. As it picked up momentum, the grunge tag was being used by shops selling expensive flannelette shirts {{to cash in on}} the trend. Ironically, the non-conformist look suddenly became <b>a</b> <b>mainstream</b> trend. In the fashion world, Marc Jacobs presented a show for Perry Ellis in 1992, featuring grunge-inspired clothing mixed with high-end fabrics. Jacobs found inspiration in the ‘realism’ of grunge streetwear; he mixed it with the luxury of fashion by sending models down the catwalk in beanies, floral dresses and silk flannel shirts. Unfortunately, this did not sit well with the brand owners and Jacobs was dismissed. Other designers like Anna Sui, also drew inspiration from grunge during the spring/summer 1993 season.|$|E
40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this study was to {{investigate}} attitudes of parents of school-aged and preschool aged children with and without handicaps, toward the issue of <b>mainstreaming.</b> <b>A</b> sample of 212 individuals responded to a parent questionnaire which was mailed to each household to be completed by both parents. This questionnaire examined attitudes and concerns of parents across 14 mainstreaming issues (Appendix 2). Of the total sample, 123 responses were used for the final analysis. Cases were discarded because some were missing the age of their child, some we::e not qualified because of their child 2 ̆ 7 s age, and others had not completed the survey. Regarding overall attitudes toward <b>mainstreaming,</b> there was <b>a</b> significant interaction between handicapping condition and sex of parent. Fathers of handicapped children disagreed more with the attitude questions than mother-s of handicapped childr-en. Also, the handicapping condition of the child affected parental attitudes about problems which a handicapped child might encounter in <b>a</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> situation. Parents of nonhandicapped children disagreed more with these issues than parents of handicapped children. Fathers of handicapped and nonhandicapped children agreed more than mothers that there might be problems encounter-ed by handicapped children in <b>a</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> situation. Mothers of nonhandicapped children and fathers of handicapped children disagreed more with these statements. The interaction between sex of parents and handicapping condition of the child was found to be significant for the dependent variables of overall mainstreaming attitudes and attitudes toward problems which a handicapped child might encounter in <b>a</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> situation. Another significant independent variable was handicapping condition of the child which was found to be significant on attitudes toward problems which a handicapped child might encounter in <b>a</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> situation and attitudes toward safety issues of both handicapped and nonhandicapped children in <b>a</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> situation. In other words, parents of handicapped children were more children were more concerned about school related problems and safety issues for handicapped children in a mainstLeaming situation. Age of the child was not found significant for- any of the dependent variables. In addition, the interaction of handicapping condition and age of the child was found to be significant for the dependent var-iable which dealt with attitudes toward safety of both handicapped and dealt with attitudes toward safety issues of both handicapped and nonhandicapped children. Families with school-aged handicapped children and families of nonhandicapped preschoolers disagreed mo e with the safety isses...|$|R

5|$|In {{the last}} two decades, {{photovoltaics}} (PV), also known as solar PV, has evolved from a pure niche market of small scale applications towards becoming <b>a</b> <b>mainstream</b> electricity source. A solar cell is a device that converts light directly into electricity using the photoelectric effect. The first solar cell was constructed by Charles Fritts in the 1880s. In 1931 a German engineer, Dr Bruno Lange, developed a photo cell using silver selenide in place of copper oxide. Although the prototype selenium cells converted less than 1% of incident light into electricity, both Ernst Werner von Siemens and James Clerk Maxwell {{recognized the importance of}} this discovery. Following the work of Russell Ohl in the 1940s, researchers Gerald Pearson, Calvin Fuller and Daryl Chapin created the crystalline silicon solar cell in 1954. These early solar cells cost 286USD/watt and reached efficiencies of 4.5–6%. By 2012 available efficiencies exceeded 20%, and the maximum efficiency of research photovoltaics was in excess of 40%.|$|E

30|$|Keeping this focus, I {{argue that}} <b>a</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> policy dismantles this {{narrative}} framework by incorporating {{the entire population}} (immigrants and citizens) into the policy focus.

The final {{goal is to create}} public services that are attuned {{to the needs of the}} whole population, regardless of their background. This mainstreaming policy has also been recently defined as an effort to reach people with a migration background through needs-based social programming and policies that also target the general population (Collet & Petrovic, 2014, p. 2).|$|R
