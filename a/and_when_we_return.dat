40|$|Many {{traditional}} {{theories of}} creativity put {{heavy emphasis on}} an incubation stage in creative cognitive processes. The basic phenomenon is a familiar one: {{we are working on}} a task or problem, we leave it aside for some period of time, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>return</b> attention to the task we have some new insight that services completion of the task. This feature, combined with other ostensibly mysterious features of creativity, has discouraged naturalists from theorizing creativity. This avoidance is misguided: we can maintain unconscious incubated cognition as (sometimes) part of the creative process and we can explain it in scientifically responsible ways. This paper, focusing on the effects of attention on the functional networking of the brain, attempts just such an explanation. It also serves to assuage the naturalist's scepticism about other features of creative cognition. The broad upshot, one would hope, is that philosophers of mind and cognitive scientists return some attention to the long neglected topic of creativit...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the goals}} of {{pervasive}} computing is the automatic personalization of computer infrastructure to create a customized user experience that’s better suited to the task at hand. The ideas presented in this article are a significant step toward that goal. The authors provide a convenient and accurate mechanism to convey a unique identifier using no more than a signet ring pressed against the capacitive touchscreen of a computer. It brings to mind the “secret decoder ring ” used by the fictional character, Dick Tracy—but this time it’s for real. � — Roy Want In this emerging era of pervasive computing, we interact with and rapidly switch among a diverse set of digital devices. We tend to transition from a smartphone to a notebook when arriving in the office, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>return</b> home, we often switch to a tablet. In between, we might use large wall-mounted displays, car navigation systems, selfcheckout kiosks at retail stores, and home security or smart home controls. Many of these devices—even if only used in the home—have multiple users. Over the next decade, this range of devices will likely increase, and our time with any single device will grow shorter. We argue that it’s time for touchbased personal tokens that let devices unobtrusively identify who is interacting with the device at any given time. This would let devices tailor services to users and apply authentication to control access to sensitive information and online services. Consider, for example, that a child reportedly spent more than $ 1, 000 on in-app purchases while playing games on his mother’s iPhone. 1 Devices that know their users could limit such spending from unauthorized users and serve age-appropriate content and media. Our approach is to use a wearable personal token to communicate an identification code through touch...|$|E

5000|$|Later that year, Romantsev {{returned}} to the club where he made his name as a player, and where he would spend {{the bulk of his}} managerial career, as he took up the post of Spartak Moscow manager.

50|$|On 24 November 1824 {{strong winds}} and a storm surge caused waves to breach Chesil Beach, {{and many of}} the {{buildings}} in the village were destroyed. Seventy-three years later an old man of the village described the events he had witnessed on that day as a boy:"At six o'-clock {{on the morning of the}} 23rd I was standing with other boys by the gate near the cattle pound when I saw, rushing up the valley, the tidal wave, driven by a hurricane and bearing upon its crest a whole haystack and other debris from the fields below.

Papa determined to spend the money in making a grand tour for the benefit of my health; and accordingly, in another fortnight--having arranged with some one to take his practice during his absence--he, Polly, and I started for a four months' tour. For that time we wandered through Switzerland, Germany, and the old cities of Belgium; and very greatly we enjoyed it. My health improved with the change of scene, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>returned</b> to our old home, at the end of November, I was really myself again, and was able to look forward cheerfully to the future, and to take my part again in what was going on round me.|$|R
60|$|Afterwards we {{went out}} in the town, Reynolds and I, and began our shopping. I was {{measured}} at the principal tailor's for more clothes than it seemed possible for me to wear out in a lifetime, from riding-breeches to a dress-coat; and the quantity and variety of hats, boots, shirts, and ties which Reynolds put down as indispensable filled me with half-amused astonishment, although I had made up my mind to be surprised at nothing. But our shopping was not finished even when Reynolds, to my inexpressible relief, declared my wardrobe to be as complete as could be furnished by a provincial town. The gunsmith's, the sporting emporium, and the horse-repository were all visited in turn. <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>returned</b> to the hotel about six o'clock I was the possessor of two guns, which were a perfect revelation to me, a cricket-bat, a tennis racquet, a small gymnasium, a set of foils, and, besides other things, a stylish, well-built dogcart and a sound, useful cob.|$|R

6000|$|As I {{knew he was}} to be hired, I {{resolved}} {{to be out of the}} way when he came to my husband; so about five o'clock I proposed to the Quaker to take a walk on the pier and see the shipping, while the tea-kettle was boiling. We went, and took Isabel with us, and as we were going along I saw my son Thomas (as I shall for the future call him) going to our inn; so we stayed out about an hour, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>returned</b> my husband told me he had hired the man, and that he was to come to him as a servant on the morrow morning. [...] "Pray, my dear," [...] said I, [...] "did you ask where he ever lived, or what his name is?" [...] "Yes," [...] replied my husband, [...] "he says his name is Thomas ----; and as to places, he has mentioned several families of note, and among others, he lived at my Lord ----'s, next door to the great French lady's in Pall Mall, whose name he tells me was Roxana." [...] I was now in a sad dilemma, and was fearful I should be known by my own son; and the Quaker took notice of it, and afterwards told me she believed fortune had conspired that all the people I became acquainted with, should have known the Lady Roxana. [...] "I warrant," [...] said she, [...] "this young fellow is somewhat acquainted with the impertinent wench that calls herself thy daughter." ...|$|R

60|$|Whitely and Olson were up <b>and</b> dressed <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>returned,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> all {{sat down}} to a good breakfast.

I received no response, though I finally pounded with all my strength; then I turned the knob and entered, only to find that she was not there. Her bed had been occupied, and her clothing lay where she had placed it the previous night upon retiring; but Lys was gone. To say that I was distracted with terror would be to put it mildly. Though I knew she could not be in camp, I searched every square inch of the compound and all the buildings, yet without avail.|$|R
60|$|And I will say, here, that I {{would rather}} travel with an {{excursion}} party of Methuselahs than {{have to be}} changing ships and comrades constantly, as people do who travel in the ordinary way. Those latter are always grieving over some other ship they have known and lost, and over other comrades whom diverging routes have separated from them. They learn to love a ship {{just in time to}} change it for another, and they become attached to a pleasant traveling companion only to lose him. They have that most dismal experience of being in a strange vessel, among strange people who care nothing about them, and of undergoing the customary bullying by strange officers and the insolence of strange servants, repeated over and over again within the compass of every month. They have also that other misery of packing and unpacking trunks--of running the distressing gauntlet of custom-houses--of the anxieties attendant upon getting a mass of baggage from point to point on land in safety. I had rasher sail with a whole brigade of patriarchs than suffer so. We never packed our trunks but twice--when we sailed from New York, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>returned</b> to it. Whenever we made a land journey, we estimated how many days we should be gone and what amount of clothing we should need, figured it down to a mathematical nicety, packed a valise or two accordingly, and left the trunks on board. We chose our comrades from among our old, tried friends, and started. We were never dependent upon strangers for companionship. We often had occasion to pity Americans whom we found traveling drearily among strangers with no friends to exchange pains and pleasures with. Whenever we were coming back from a land journey, our eyes sought one thing in the distance first--the ship --and <b>when</b> <b>we</b> saw it riding at anchor with the flag apeak, we felt as a returning wanderer feels when he sees his home. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> stepped on board, our cares vanished, our troubles were at an end--for the ship was home to us. We always had the same familiar old state-room to go to, and feel safe and at peace and comfortable again.|$|R
60|$|With their {{going it}} seemed as if some evil {{presence}} had departed, for the dogs frisked about and barked merrily as they made sudden darts at their prostrate foes, and turned them over and over and tossed them in the air with vicious shakes. We all seemed to find our spirits rise. Whether it was the purifying of the deadly atmosphere by the opening of the chapel door, or the relief which we experienced by finding ourselves in the open I know not, but most certainly the shadow of dread seemed to slip from us like a robe, and the occasion of our coming lost something of its grim significance, though we did not slacken a whit in our resolution. We closed the outer door and barred and locked it, and bringing the dogs with us, began our search of the house. We found nothing throughout except dust in extraordinary proportions, and all untouched save for my own footsteps when I had made my first visit. Never once did the dogs exhibit any symptom of uneasiness, <b>and</b> even <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>returned</b> to the chapel they frisked about as though they had been rabbit hunting in a summer wood.|$|R
60|$|Such {{things do}} not really matter; the guide-book's object of {{interest}} is seldom an object of human interest; you may miss it or ignore it without real personal loss; but if we had failed of that mystic progress of the silver car down the nave of San Pablo {{we should have been}} really if not sensibly poorer. So we should if we had failed of the charming experience which awaited us in our hotel at lunch-time. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> went out in the morning we saw a table spread the length of the long dining-room, <b>and</b> now <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>returned</b> <b>we</b> found every chair taken. At once we surmised a wedding breakfast, not more from the gaiety than the gravity of the guests; and the head waiter confirmed our impression: it was indeed a boda. The party was just breaking up, and as we sat down at our table the wedding guests rose from theirs. I do not know but in any country the women on such an occasion would look more adequate to it than the men; at any rate, there in Spain they looked altogether superior. It was not only that they were handsomer and better dressed, but that they expressed finer social and intellectual quality.|$|R
6000|$|Though September was bland as June at {{the foot}} of the mountain, we found its breath harsh and cold on these heights; and we remarked that though there were here and there breadths of wheat, the land was for the most part in sheep pasturage, and the grass looked poor and stinted of summer warmth. We met, at times, the shepherds, who seemed to be of Italian race, and were of the {{conventional}} type of shepherds, with regular faces, and two elaborate curls trained upon their cheeks, as shepherds are always represented in stone over the gates of villas. They bore staves, and their flocks went before them. Encountering us, they saluted us courteously, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> had <b>returned</b> their greeting, they cried with one voice,--"Ah, lords! is not this a miserable country? The people are poor and the air is cold. It is an unhappy land!" [...] And so passed on, profoundly sad; but we could not help smiling at the vehement popular desire to have the region abused. We answered cheerfully that it was a lovely country. If the air was cold, it was also pure.|$|R
60|$|But {{who shall}} {{describe}} the social charms of our dinner? All wedged together, as we were, in the snuggest little pigeon hole of a dining room, pretty little chattering children and all, whom papa held upon {{his knee and}} fed with bonbons, all the while impressing upon them the absolute necessity of their leaving the table! There the salad was mixed by acclamation, {{each member of the}} party adding a word of advice, and each, gayly laughing at the advice of the other. There a gay, red lobster was pulled in pieces among us, with infinite gout; and Madame Belloc pathetically expressed her fears that we did not like French cooking. She might have saved herself the trouble; for we take to it as naturally as ducks take to the water. <b>And</b> then, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>returned</b> to the parlor, we resolved ourselves into a committee of the whole on coffee, which was concocted in a trim little hydrostatic engine of latest modern invention, before the faces of all. And so we right merrily spent the evening. H. discussed poetry and art with our kind hosts to her heart's content, and at a late hour we drove to the railroad, and returned to Paris.|$|R
40|$|Keller {{criticizes the}} ideal of pure, value-free {{theoretical}} science by pointing to two senses in which science is value-laden: (i) the metaphor of science as a “great searchlight ” with its beam directed by specific interests rather than an “expanding sphere of light”; and (ii) ostensibly theoretical sciences like genetics and nuclear physics contain within them “not only the possibility but the expectation ” of eugenics and the bomb. The logical positivist “received view ” presumes that Keller’s critique would be readily handled by the distinction between contexts of discovery <b>and</b> justification; however, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>return</b> to Reichenbach’s 1938 formulation of that distinction, we find this is not so.

60|$|If {{things were}} going too smoothly, the eldest boy would come out with some tale about all the clocks in the house being five minutes slow, and of his having been late for school the {{previous}} day in consequence.
