40|$|The studied {{retail brand}} owning company has two {{problems}} related to the distributors’ ordering process. The first problem is that many developed products are cancelled and never produced. The second problem is high material handling cost for distributors, due to many received mixed packaging. Therefore, {{the aim of the}} study is to propose an ordering strategy that differentiates products based on their ordering characteristics, for the ordering process between the retail brand owning company and its distributors and suppliers, in order to decrease the material handling cost for distributors and the large <b>amount</b> of <b>cancelled</b> products. Generally, more strategies, for retailers’ ordering process than distributors’ ordering process, are presented in literature. Hence, the ordering process is also interesting to study from a research point of view. The process, to create a differentiated ordering strategy, was divided into four parts. Firstly, stakeholders’ requirements were identified for segmentation, order quantity restrictions, and implementation, to detect what aspects of ordering that are most relevant for the study. Secondly, a segmentation of the product assortment was made, to identify product segments that are suitable for having different ordering strategies. The segmentation consisted of four segments. The dimensions of the segmentation matrix are distributors’ risk and demand, which are areas primarily affecting the ordering. Each Ekldimension consisted of an underlying factor. The factor for risk is customer segment, and the factor for demand is first forecast on colour level. Thirdly, order quantity restrictions were examined. Order quantity restrictions, MOQs and multiples, were recommended for all four segments. Finally, the required changes to implement the differentiated ordering strategy were identified. As a result of the differentiated ordering strategy, different product segments will have different order quantity restrictions. By implementing multiples, new packaging instructions, and a higher MOQ for 85 % of the products, the amount of mixed packaging are decreased. As a result of less mixed packaging, the material handling cost for distributors is reduced. Moreover, by a differentiated MOQ and a first forecast on colour level, the large <b>amount</b> of <b>cancelled</b> products will decrease...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{promising}} technologies for LTE Evolution is full-duplex radio, an innovation {{is expected to}} double the spectral efficiency. To realize full-duplex in practice, the main challenge is overcoming self-interference, and to do so, researchers have developed self-interference cancellation techniques. Since most wireless transceivers use power amplifiers, especially in cellular systems, researchers have revealed the importance of nonlinear self-interference cancellation. In this article, we first explore several nonlinear digital self-interference cancellation techniques. We then propose a low complexity pre-calibration-based nonlinear digital self-interference cancellation technique. Next we discuss issues about reference signal allocation and the overhead of each technique. For performance evaluations, we carry out extensive measurements through a real-time prototype and link-/system-level simulations. For link-level analysis, we measure the <b>amount</b> of <b>cancelled</b> self-interference for each technique. We also evaluate system-level performances through 3 D ray-tracing-based simulations.

The YAFTA feature tracking algorithm {{is applied to}} GONG++ one-minute magnetograms for 77 X-class and M-class flares to analyze the evolution and interaction of the magnetic features and to estimate the <b>amount</b> of <b>canceled</b> magnetic flux. We find that significantly more magnetic flux decreases than increases occurred during the flares, consistent with a model of collapsing loop structure for flares. Correlations between both total (unsigned) and net (signed) flux changes and the GOES peak X-ray flux are dominated by X-class flares at limb locations. The flux changes were accompanied in most cases by significant cancellation, most of which occurred during the flares. We find that the field strength and complexity near the polarity inversion line are approximately equally important in the flux cancellation processes that accompany the flares. We do not find a correlation between the flux cancellation events and the stepwise changes in the magnetic flux in the region. Comment: Published in Solar Physic...|$|R

40|$|Sequences of {{line-of-sight}} (LOS) magnetograms {{recorded by}} the Michelson Doppler Imager are used to quantitatively characterize photospheric magnetic structure and evolution in three active regions that rotated across the Sun s disk during the Whole Heliosphere Interval (WHI), {{in an attempt to}} relate the photospheric magnetic properties of these active regions to flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Several approaches are used in our analysis, on scales ranging from whole active regions, to magnetic features, to supergranular scales, and, finally, to individual pixels. We calculated several parameterizations of magnetic structure and evolution that have previously been associated with flare and CME activity, including total unsigned magnetic flux, magnetic flux near polarity-inversion lines, <b>amount</b> of <b>canceled</b> flux, the "proxy Poynting flux," and helicity flux. To catalog flare events, we used flare lists derived from both GOES and RHESSI observations. By most such measures, AR 10988 should have been the most flare- and CME-productive active region, and AR 10989 the least. Observations, however, were not consistent with this expectation: ARs 10988 and 10989 produced similar numbers of flares, and AR 10989 also produced a few CMEs. These results highlight present limitations of statistics-based flare and CME forecasting tools that rely upon line-of-sight photospheric magnetic data alone...|$|R

40|$|A solar {{eruption}} {{that produces}} a coronal mass ejection (CME) together with a flare {{is driven by the}} eruption of a closed-loop magnetic arcade that has a sheared-field core. Before eruption, the sheared core envelops a polarity inversion line along which cool filament material may reside. The sheared-core arcade erupts when there is a breakdown in the balance between the confining downward-directed magnetic tension of the overall arcade field and the upward-directed force of the pent-up magnetic pressure of the sheared field in the core of the arcade. What triggers the breakdown in this balance in favor of the upward-directed force is still an unsettled question. We consider several eruption examples, using imaging data from the SoHO, TRACE and Hinode satellites, and other sources, along with information about the magnetic field of the erupting regions. In several cases, observations of large-scale eruptions, where the magnetic neutral line spans few x 10, 000 km, are consistent with magnetic flux cancellation being the trigger to the eruption's onset, even though the <b>amount</b> of flux <b>canceled</b> is only ~few percent of the total magnetic flux of the erupting region. In several other cases, an initial compact (small size-scale) eruption occurs embedded inside of a larger closed magnetic loop system, so that the smaller eruption destabilizes and causes the eruption of the much larger system. In this way, small-scale eruptive events can result in eruption of much larger-scale systems...|$|R

6000|$|Against the {{adoption}} of the earlier text, there is this fatal objection, that {{if it is to be}} done at all, it must be done throughout; and, in the earliest poems Wordsworth wrote--viz. 'An Evening Walk' and 'Descriptive Sketches',--the subsequent alterations almost <b>amounted</b> to a <b>cancelling</b> of the earlier version. His changes were all, or almost all, unmistakably for the better. Indeed, there was little in these works--in the form in which they first appeared--to lead to the belief that an original poet had arisen in England. It is true that Coleridge saw in them the signs of the dawn of a new era, and wrote thus of 'Descriptive Sketches', before he knew its author, [...] "Seldom, if ever, was the emergence of a great and original poetic genius above the literary horizon more evidently announced." [...] Nevertheless the earliest text of these 'Sketches' is, in many places, so artificial, prosaic, and dull, that its reproduction (except as an appendix, or in the form of footnotes) would be an injustice to Wordsworth. [10] On the other hand, the passages subsequently cancelled are so numerous, and so long, that if placed in footnotes the latter would in some instances be more extensive than the text. The quarto of 1793 will therefore be reprinted in full as an Appendix to the first volume of this edition. The 'School Exercise written at Hawkshead' in the poet's fourteenth year, will be found in vol. viii. Passing over these juvenile efforts, there are poems--such as 'Guilt and Sorrow', 'Peter Bell', and many others--in which the earlier text is an inferior one, which was either corrected or abandoned by Wordsworth in his maturer years. It would be a conspicuous blunder to print--in the place of honour,--the crude original which was afterwards repudiated by its author.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} {{acceleration}} of particles to super-thermal energies in explosive solar events {{as well as the}} magnetic changes in connectivity that may be responsible for changes in the morphology of quiescent filaments. Firstly a review of some of the observations of solar flare dynamics is given, as well as an introduction to the competing theories attempting to explain both particle acceleration and filament formation. An explanation of the numerical FORTRAN code that is used to calculate the trajectories of particle distribution functions in prescribed electromagnetic fields is given. Examples of known fields are used to test the accuracy of the code and the simple example of the well-known Litvinenko current sheet field is investigated. The results of charged particle orbit calculations in prescribed electric and magnetic fields motivated by magnetic reconnection models are then presented. The electromagnetic fields are chosen to resemble a current sheet with a localised reconnection region. The dependence of the model on the important physical parameters is considered. An introduction to the mathematical formulation of a collapsing magnetic trap is given. The same numerical code is used to calculate single electron orbits in this more complicated time dependent electromagnetic field. Consideration of important previous work is given before describing the best attempts to model the movement of flare loops in a realistic fashion. Finally the process of flux cancellation and filament formation is studied using a range of data including ground-based Hα and SoHO MDI magnetograms. It is found that the cancellation occurs at the ends of Hα sections of the filament and is accompanied by a noticeable increase in the Hα intensity and linkage of the sections. Measurements of the <b>amount</b> of flux <b>cancelled</b> at each site show it is in agreement with an estimate of the axial flux contained in the filament...|$|R
40|$|Email Print Request Permissions Summary form only given. Single laser {{chips that}} emit {{multiple}} wavelengths simultaneously are interesting {{for a range}} of applications including wavelength division multiplexing, optical instrument testing and optical sensing. A number of approaches have been proposed to achieve multiple wavelength emission (MWE) by e. g. using multiple lasers, but they tend to be bulky and/or expensive. Some of these structures need thermal tuning of the emission wavelengths, which is relatively slow and requires precise control of the chip temperature. In this work we report on a novel integrated approach in order to obtain MWE from a single semiconductor laser based on on-chip filtered optical feedback. The layout of our device is shown in Fig. 1 (a). It consists of semiconductor ring laser (SRL), two arrayed waveguide gratings which are used to split/recombine light into 4 different wavelength channels, four semiconductor optical amplifier gates and passive and active waveguides to connect these different components. We can select either triple wavelength emission, dual wavelength emission (DWE) or single longitudinal mode emission (SME) by properly adjusting the currents in the semiconductor optical amplifier gates of the feedback loop. An advantage of our device is that we can select the lasing longitudinal modes, and thus the emitted wavelengths, in a simple manner by changing the current in the feedback amplifiers. Wavelength selection is done in a non-thermal fashion, which can in principle be done fast. MWE is achieved in a SRL, which has the additional advantage that it can easily be integrated with other photonic components on a chip. Experimentally the device output without feedback is multi-mode above the threshold current (64 mA). SME can be achieved by pumping one gate with a suitable current [1]. When current is applied to two gates at the same time while the SRL is biased above threshold current, SRL shows DWE {{for a range of}} currents on gate 4 and gate 2. This DWE can b- observed in the optical spectrum shown in Fig. 1 (b), {{at the top of this}} figure we show a schematic plot of the filter passband of each of the gate channels. The selected longitudinal modes are spectrally positioned within the arrayed waveguide gratings filter passbands corresponding to gate 2 and gate 4 which are chosen to be pumped. The two peak wavelengths are ¿ 1 = 1580. 788 nm (gate 4 channel), ¿ 2 = 1583. 288 nm (gate 2 channel). This DWE can be explained by the fact that a suitable <b>amount</b> of feedback <b>cancels</b> the gain difference between the wavelength channels due to fabrication and material dichroism. By increasing or decreasing the current injected in one of the pumped gates, we notice switching from two modes in the output to one of them. By pumping three gates instead of two and by precise adjustment of the currents in the gates, triple wavelength emission was observed with similar switching behavior to DWE and then to SME just by changing one of the gate currents. In this contribution we will further discuss the precise behavior of the MWE from the device. We will also show results from numerical simulations based on two directional-mode model[2] extended with Lang-Kobayashi terms to take into account for optical feedback. Some of these numerical results are shown in Fig. 1 (c). We plot in this figure the maxima of the intensities of the three modes when the feedback phase is equal to 0. 5 p for each mode. The first modes feedback strength ¿ 1 is fixed while the feedback strength ¿ 2 and ¿ 3 of the second and third modes are kept equal ¿ 2 = ¿ 3 and are increased simultaneously. As can be seen from Fig 1. (c), the device output is changing from SME when (¿ 2 = ¿ 3) ¿ 1. The numerical results are in qualitative agreement with the...|$|R
