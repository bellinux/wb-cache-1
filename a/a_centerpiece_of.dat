5|$|The {{roadhouse}} {{is named}} after Rika Wallen, who acquired it from John Hajdukovich and operated it for many years. It became a hub of activity in that region of the interior. With {{the construction of the}} ALCAN (now Alaska) Highway and the replacement of the ferry with a bridge downstream, traffic moved away and patronage declined. The roadhouse was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976, and is now <b>a</b> <b>centerpiece</b> <b>of</b> Big Delta State Historical Park, also listed on the National Register.|$|E
5|$|The Moro River {{runs from}} the central {{mountain}} spine of Italy to the Adriatic coast south of Ortona. The German defences on the Moro were <b>a</b> <b>centerpiece</b> <b>of</b> the Winter Line, which guarded {{the eastern side of}} the Apennines along Route 5. Montgomery hoped to punch through the Winter Line, capture Ortona and Pescara and advance to Rome. The British 78th Infantry Division, which had been spearheading V Corps since the Volturno Line actions and had sustained over 7,000 casualties in less than six months, was relieved by the fresh 1st Canadian Infantry Division (Major-General Christopher Vokes), ready to renew the offensive on 5 December 1943. The 78th Infantry Division was sent into the mountains on the relatively quiet left wing of the army, joining the British 5th Infantry Division (Major-General Gerard Bucknall) under XIII Corps.|$|E

5|$|During {{the latter}} part of Diệm's rule, <b>a</b> <b>centerpiece</b> <b>of</b> the rural pacification {{campaign}} was the large-scale construction of strategic hamlets, whereby villagers were compelled to move into fortified camps in an attempt to lock out insurgents. However this failed as many were able to infiltrate the settlements, whereas a previous implementation of such principles in Malaya had been successful as the local communists were ethnic Chinese who were physically distinguishable from the anti-communist ethnic majority. It also angered the peasants, who were forced to abandon their ancestral lands and homes, and build new dwellings in the new villages. Many of these hamlets were subsequently overrun in communist attacks, something many villagers found to their liking. General Lê Văn Kim oversaw the future of the program for Minh and it was decided to liberalize the system to try to win over the peasants. They forecast that they could reduce the insurgency's support by 30% alone through these less restrictive arrangements, citing more cooperative attitudes in Mekong Delta regions heavily populated with Hòa Hảo and Cao Đài. However this upset and aroused suspicions among the Americans.|$|E
25|$|A {{slightly}} modified 50th Anniversary Edition Corvette {{was chosen to}} pace the Indianapolis 500 race in May 2002; then the production vehicle became <b>a</b> <b>centerpiece</b> <b>of</b> the subsequent 50th Anniversary Celebration, sponsored by Chevrolet.

Thousands of Corvettes and their owners arrived {{from all over the}} country to participate in the events marking the vehicle's 50th year of production.|$|E
25|$|Controversy {{arose in}} 2013, when CFA (Championship Fighting Alliance) fighter Fallon Fox {{came out as}} a {{transgender}} woman. The case became <b>a</b> <b>centerpiece</b> <b>of</b> debates concerning whether it was fair to have a transsexual woman compete against one born of the female sex in a contact sport. Neither the UFC nor Invicta FC say they will allow her to fight, and then-UFC Bantamweight champion Ronda Rousey says she will not fight her.|$|E

25|$|The work of Douady and Hubbard {{coincided with}} a huge {{increase}} in interest in complex dynamics and abstract mathematics, {{and the study of}} the Mandelbrot set has been <b>a</b> <b>centerpiece</b> <b>of</b> this field ever since.

25|$|On March 1, 1987, Channel 2 was relaunched {{with the}} live musical special, The Star Network: Ang Pagbabalík Ng Bituin (The Return of the Star) which noted for the then-brand-new {{numerical}} white tri-ribbon channel 2 logo {{with a white}} rhombidal star (from 1988 to 1993 the ribbons were tri-coloured in red, green and blue) as <b>a</b> <b>centerpiece</b> <b>of</b> the network's revival. By 1988, ABS-CBN had regained its foothold in Philippine TV ratings from dead last (#5) to being number 1 again nationally - {{as a result of}} the rebranding.|$|E
25|$|Inspired by neoclassical tastes, the short-waisted dresses sported soft, loose {{skirts and}} were often made of white, almost {{transparent}} muslin, which was easily washed and draped loosely like the garments on Greek and Roman statues. Since the fabric {{clung to the}} body, revealing what was underneath, it made nudity à la grecque <b>a</b> <b>centerpiece</b> <b>of</b> public spectacle. Thus during the 1795–1820 period, it was often possible for middle- and upper-class women to wear clothes that were not very confining or cumbersome, and still be considered decently and fashionably dressed.|$|E

50|$|The {{institution}} was chartered on September 24, 1886, as the Banco Hipotecario Nacional (National Mortgage Bank) by a bill (Law 1804) {{signed by}} President Julio Roca. The bank pioneered mortgage lending on extended, low-interest terms in Argentina, and thus contributed to consolidating a modern Argentine economy (<b>a</b> policy <b>centerpiece</b> <b>of</b> the Generation of '80, as Roca {{and his allies}} were known).|$|R
25|$|Commissioner Safir {{implemented}} a comprehensive Fugitive Strategy and established thirty-nine major anti-drug initiatives {{throughout the city}} including the Northern Manhattan Initiative. He created model blocks in each borough to prevent eradicated drug dealing from returning and he introduced closed circuit television {{to ensure the safety}} of housing development residents, park visitors and subway riders. Concerned for officer and public safety, Safir expanded firearms training and introduced Firearms Training Simulators. Under his leadership, firearms discharge incidents decreased from 344 in 1995 to 155 in 1999. He developed and implemented Operation Condor, a creative use of personnel resources, that continues to be <b>a</b> <b>centerpiece</b> <b>of</b> current NYPD crime reduction strategy. Safir served four years as Police Commissioner until he announced his resignation and retirement from government service in 2000.|$|E
25|$|As {{relations}} with the U.S. deteriorated, Perón made efforts to mitigate the misunderstandings, which was made easier after President Harry Truman replaced the hostile Braden with Ambassador George Messersmith. He negotiated the release of Argentine assets in the U.S. in exchange for preferential treatment for U.S. goods, followed by Argentine ratification of the Act of Chapultepec, <b>a</b> <b>centerpiece</b> <b>of</b> Truman's Latin America policy. He even proposed the enlistment of Argentine troops into the Korean War in 1950 under UN auspices (a move retracted {{in the face of}} public opposition). Perón was opposed to borrowing from foreign credit markets, preferring to float bonds domestically. He refused to enter the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (precursor to the World Trade Organization) or the International Monetary Fund.|$|E
25|$|He {{returned}} from Grenoble {{to take part}} in the 1926 elections, and ran as a candidate for the town of Focşani. He lost, and, although it had had a considerable success, the League disbanded in the same year. Codreanu gathered former members of the League who had spent time in prison, and put into practice his dream of forming the Legion (November 1927, just a few days after the fall of a new Averescu cabinet, which had continued to support Cuza). Codreanu claimed to had a vision of the Archangel Michael who told him he had been chosen by God to be Romania's savior. Right from the start, a commitment to the values of the Eastern Orthodox Church was core to the message of the Legion, and Codreanu's alleged vision was <b>a</b> <b>centerpiece</b> <b>of</b> his message.|$|E
50|$|The Ichiriki is over 300 years old, and {{has been}} <b>a</b> major <b>centerpiece</b> <b>of</b> Gion since the {{beginning}} of the entertainment district.

50|$|In the 1990s, {{he gave a}} {{groundbreaking}} emotionally charged performance of “Another Time, Another Place” with fellow artist Sandi Patty on NBC-TV’s The Tonight Show—an event that was deemed a defining moment in Christian music’s move to wider audiences.

25|$|Basic {{income has}} been {{discussed}} in modern Brazil {{at least since the}} 1980s. In 2001 a law was introduced by Senator Eduardo Suplicy of the Brazilian Workers Party which mandated the progressive institution of such a welfare system. By this move Brazil became the first country in the world to pass such a law. Suplicy had previously introduced a bill to create a Negative Income Tax, but that bill failed to pass. The new bill called for a national and universal basic income to be instituted, beginning with those most in need. The bill was approved by the Senate in 2002 and by the Chamber of Deputies in 2003. President Lula da Silva signed it into law in 2004, and according to the bill it is the president's responsibility to gradually implement the reform. Since then Brazil has started to implement the bill through the Bolsa Família-program, which was <b>a</b> <b>centerpiece</b> <b>of</b> President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's social policy, and is reputed to {{have played a role in}} his victory in the Brazilian presidential election, 2006.|$|E
500|$|Repeal and {{replacement}} of Obamacare (the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act) was <b>a</b> <b>centerpiece</b> <b>of</b> McCain's 2016 re-election campaign, and in July 2017 he said, [...] "Have no doubt: Congress must replace Obamacare, which has hit Arizonans {{with some of}} the highest premium increases in the nation and left 14 of Arizona’s 15 counties with only one provider option on the exchanges this year." [...] He added that he supports affordable and quality health care, but objected that the pending Senate bill did not do enough to shield the Medicaid system in Arizona.|$|E
500|$|The song {{appeared}} in two shows of 1918: Yip Yip Yaphank and Ziegfeld Follies of 1918. Yip Yip Yaphank opened on August 19 and Berlin made his entrance {{late in the}} show, being dragged from a pup tent by two other soldiers as he pretended to be asleep on his feet to sing [...] "Oh! How I Hate to Get Up in the Morning". The song was <b>a</b> <b>centerpiece</b> <b>of</b> the show; both it and Berlin's performance received favorable reviews. According to reviewers, Berlin's voice was thin but his timing was perfect and he presented a hilarious stage persona. 24 years later, the New York Times declared Yip [...] "an immediate hit." ...|$|E
50|$|Innovation: The Hall of Light {{featured}} a 15-meter screen that showed films highlighting the country's innovations and technological achievements. <b>As</b> the <b>centerpiece</b> <b>of</b> the pavilion, the Hall of Innovations presented an audiovisual show which allowed visitors {{to hear from}} Israeli children, scientists, doctors and inventors, via hundreds of screens.

2500|$|The plan {{to capture}} the generals failed when they did not receive President Sukarno’s {{statement}} of support. [...] The statement of support was meant to legitimate the plan’s goals {{for it to be}} immediately broadcast over the radio. [...] <b>As</b> the <b>centerpiece</b> <b>of</b> the movement, the abductions, failed, the consequent steps also failed. Sukarno could not support a group of junior officers killing their generals, and Sukarno told this to Supardjo in order to call off the killings.|$|R

As he completed his fifth trip to Iowa, party officials in the state remarked that he was [...] "making inroads" [...] in the state, commenting that [...] "Democrats are looking for somebody who is new and fresh." [...] The candidate revealed his economic goals during a speech, stating [...] "that creating opportunity for middle-class Americans will be <b>a</b> <b>centerpiece</b> <b>of</b> my campaign." [...] He then listed his objectives including: tax credits to pay for college tuition of low to mid-level income Americans, covering insurance costs of small businesses for its sickest employees, and incentives for saving and buying automobiles with [...] "good gas mileage."
