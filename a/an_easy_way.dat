IGN's Jose Otero found the inventory management system, which lacks <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>way</b> to sort items, to be problematic. Chris Carter from Destructoid noted that the game's intricacies are described in messages on the in-game phone, which he considered difficult to navigate and read, and that the messages were often insufficiently clear and detailed.|$|E
