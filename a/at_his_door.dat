Hanada snipes the first from behind a billboard's animatronic cigarette lighter, shoots the second from a basement up through a pipe drain when the latter leans over the sink and, ordered to finish quickly, blasts {{his way into the}} third's office and escapes on an advertising balloon. Misako then appears <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>door</b> and offers him a nearly impossible contract to kill a foreigner, which he cannot refuse having just been told the plan.|$|E

25|$|At {{the age of}} 27, Macleod {{was already}} {{considered}} somewhat {{too old to be}} a platoon commander. Once fit for duty again, he served as a staff captain with the 46th Division in Wye, under the Deputy Assistant Adjutant General (DAAG), Captain Dawtry. In 1941 a drunk Macleod almost killed Dawtry, as the latter had retired to bed rather than play stud poker with him. He shot <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>door</b> until his revolver ran out of bullets, and then passed out after smashing down the door with a heavy piece of furniture. He demanded an apology the next morning for his refusal to play, although the two men remained friends thereafter. Dawtry later became Chief Clerk of Westminster Council.|$|E

25|$|On 18 March 1861, the {{congregation}} moved permanently {{to the newly}} constructed purpose-built Metropolitan Tabernacle at Elephant and Castle, Southwark, seating 5000 people with standing room for another 1000. The Metropolitan Tabernacle was the largest church edifice of its day. Spurgeon continued to preach there several times per week until his death 31 years later. He never gave altar calls {{at the conclusion of}} his sermons, but he always extended the invitation that if anyone was moved to seek an interest in Christ by his preaching on a Sunday, they could meet with him at his vestry on Monday morning. Without fail, there was always someone <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>door</b> the next day.|$|E
25|$|In 1822, Ripley was {{a town of}} {{frequent}} street fights and shootouts where {{the most common type}} of business was a saloon. During the Rankins' first few months there, hecklers and protesters often followed the new preacher through town and gathered outside his cabin while their first permanent home was being built just yards from the river at 220 Front Street. When the local newspaper began publishing his letters to his brother on the topic of slavery (see next section), Rankin's reputation grew among both supporters and opponents of the anti-slavery movement. Slave owners and hunters often viewed him as their prime suspect and appeared <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>door</b> at all hours demanding information about fugitives. Soon, Rankin realized that the home was too accessible a place for him to properly raise his family.|$|E
25|$|Lee was {{an early}} {{influence}} on physician and human rights activist H. Jack Geiger. They met in 1940 when Geiger, a 14-year-old middle-class Jewish runaway, was backstage at a Broadway production of Native Son. Lee agreed to take Geiger in {{when he showed up}} <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>door</b> in Harlem asking for a place to stay. With the consent of his parents, Geiger stayed with Lee for over a year. Lee took on the role of surrogate father and introduced Geiger to Langston Hughes, Billy Strayhorn, Richard Wright, and Adam Clayton Powell. Geiger eventually became a journalist, then a doctor who co-founded the first community health center in the United States, Columbia Point Health Center in Dorchester, Massachusetts. He became a founder of Physicians for Social Responsibility and Physicians for Human Rights, and established community health centers in Mississippi and South Africa. Geiger says he would never have moved so deeply in these worlds so quickly if not for his experiences with Canada Lee.|$|E

In early drafts, Spock plays Polonius in a Vulcan version of Hamlet, while Sulu drives a taxicab in an overcrowded metropolis. The revised opening featured Captain Sulu bringing his friends out of their retirement: Spock's whereabouts are classified; Kirk was to have married Carol Marcus (played by Bibi Besch in The Wrath of Khan), the mother of his late son, leading a settled life before a special envoy arrives <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>door.</b> McCoy is drunk at a posh medical dinner; Scott is teaching Engineering while the Bird of Prey from The Voyage Home is pulled from San Francisco Bay; Uhura hosts a call-in radio show and is glad to escape; and Chekov is playing chess at a club.|$|E
500|$|Betances met {{his lifelong}} companion, Simplicia Isolina Jiménez Carlo, in 1864. Jiménez {{apparently}} {{was born in}} what would later become the Dominican Republic, on July 28, 1842. Her mother's last name, Carlo, rather common in Cabo Rojo, implies that her family had ties to the town. She worked for one of Betances' sisters between 1863 and 1864, and he met her once at his sister's house. Apparently she was infatuated with him strongly enough to appear <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>door</b> {{with a pair of}} suitcases, asking him to give her shelter, since [...] "no gentleman would leave a woman alone on the street at night." [...] Jiménez then became Betances' common-law wife for thirty-five years, and survived his death in 1898. They would not have any children. Their godchild, Magdalena Caraguel, was eventually adopted by the couple as their daughter. Little else is documented about Jiménez in history books, and Betances rarely mentions her in his works and correspondence.|$|E
500|$|In {{his history}} of Taunton, Joshua Toulmin {{suggested}} that the church adopted Unitarian worship in 1722. This form of worship remained outlawed, as the Act of Toleration did not extend to nontrinitarianism. Unitarianism believed in the [...] "One God and Father of all", rather than the Trinity of God as three consubstantial persons. Writing a series on [...] "Baptists in Taunton" [...] for the Taunton Courier, H. J. Channon disagreed, placing the change in 1733. Both agreed that the zeal with which Jeffries preached helped to swell his congregation, although {{a history of the}} Baptist church in Wellington notes that Jeffries was obstructive regarding a Baptist church being built in that town. Toulmin himself served as the pastor of the chapel from 1764 until 1803, during which time he [...] "experienced unremitted insult and misrepresentation." [...] At one time, an effigy was burned <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>door,</b> and it was said that Toulmin could have suffered the same fate, but for assistance from his friends. During Toulmin's ministry, the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge occasionally preached at the chapel while staying at Coleridge Cottage in Nether Stowey. In a letter, Coleridge wrote, [...] "I walked into Taunton (eleven miles) and back again, and performed the divine services for Dr. Toulmin." [...] The Doctrine of the Trinity Act 1813 legalised Unitarian worship.|$|E

2500|$|About 1611, {{the year}} in which he {{commenced}} M.A., he heard a sermon at St. Mary's from John Cotton, then fellow of Emmanuel, which opened to him a new career. Cotton had a great reputation as an elegant preacher; but this was a plain evangelical sermon, and disappointed his audience. He returned to his rooms, somewhat mortified by his reception, when Preston knocked <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>door,</b> and that close religious friendship began which permanently influenced the lives of both. Preston now gave himself to the study of scholastic divinity; Aquinas seems to have been his favourite he thoroughly mastered also Duns Scotus and William of Ockham.|$|E
