5|$|International {{airports}} have {{commercial relationships}} with and {{provide services to}} airlines <b>and</b> <b>passengers</b> from around the world. Many also serve as hubs, or places where non-direct flights may land <b>and</b> <b>passengers</b> may switch planes, while others serve primarily direct point-to-point flights. This affects airport design factors, including the number and placement of terminals {{as well as the}} flow of passengers and baggage between different areas of the airport. An airport specializing in point-to-point transit can have international and domestic terminals, each in their separate building equipped with separate baggage handling facilities. In a hub airport, however, spaces and services are shared.|$|E

At the time, all cargo <b>and</b> <b>passengers</b> to Troll had to either be transported by ship, or flown in via the airport at the Russian base Novolazarevskaya or Henriksenskjera.|$|E
