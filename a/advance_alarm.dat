The IMC-AESOP project aims at designing the next generation architecture of process automation systems. In order to ensure system scalability and modularity, the new architectural design follows the SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture) design principles. Moreover, the design assumes adoption of various technologies with the aim to enable the control systems to meet all functional and performance requirements. The CEP (Complex Event Processing) technology has been selected for being able to provide efficient asynchronous communication (within and across architecture layers) and the capability of temporal reasoning over large amounts of system-generated events.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of new technologies like adaptive automation systems and <b>advanced</b> <b>alarms</b> processing and presentation techniques in nuclear power plants is already {{having an impact on}} the safety and effectiveness of plant operations and also the role of the control room operator. This impact is expected to escalate dramatically as more and more nuclear power utilities embark on upgrade projects in order to extend the lifetime of their plants. One of the most visible impacts in control rooms will be the need to replace aging alarm systems. Because most of these alarm systems use obsolete technologies, the methods, techniques and tools that were used to design the previous generation of alarm system designs are no longer effective and need to be updated. The same applies to the need to analyze and redefine operators’ alarm handling tasks. In the past, methods for analyzing human tasks and workload have relied on crude, paper-based methods that often lacked traceability. New approaches are needed to allow analysts to model and represent the new concepts of alarm operation and human-system interaction. State-of-the-art task simulation tools are now available that offer a cost-effective and efficient method for examining the effect of operator performance in different conditions and operational scenarios. A discrete event simulation system was used by human factors researchers at the Idaho National Laboratory to develop a generic alarm handling model to examine the effect of operator performance with simulated modern alarm system.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} China’s and Vietnam’s {{performance in}} reducing under-five child mortality in a comparative perspective.

However, although the former grew faster and is more economically developed, Vietnam’s record in this area was markedly better than China’s. We show that this apparent paradox is due mainly to two reasons. One is related to the relative status of women, which is better in Vietnam than in China.

On that same night, the Romanian river torpedo boats Rândunica, Bujorescu and Catinca attacked the Austro-Hungarian Danube Flotilla at the Bulgarian port of Ruse, sinking one barge loaded with fuel and damaging the port's quay. Initially, the only opposing force was the Austro-Hungarian First Army, which was steadily pushed back toward Hungary. In a short time, the towns of Brașov, Făgăraș and Miercurea Ciuc were captured, and the outskirts of Sibiu were reached. In areas populated with Romanians, the Romanian troops were warmly welcomed, and the locals provided them considerable assistance in terms of provisions, billeting and guiding. However, the rapid Romanian <b>advance</b> <b>alarmed</b> the Central Powers, and within weeks sizable reinforcements began arriving at the scene. The Entente incorrectly assumed that Germany would be unable to respond to the invasion, as the Battle of the Somme and the Brusilov Offensive were at their height around this time and tied down significant German forces. Nevertheless, eight divisions and an Alpine Corps were deployed under the command of Erich von Falkenhayn. The Austro-Hungarians also sent four divisions to reinforce their lines, and by the middle of September, the Romanian offensive was halted. The Russians loaned them three divisions for operations in the north of Romania, but hampered their efforts by failing to provide much-needed supplies.|$|R
40|$|High Voltage Shunt Capacitor Banks (HV-SCBs) are {{critical}} substation assets that are primarily {{used to improve}} power factor and thus power transmission capability. Over temperature, over voltages, manufacturing defects can cause internal failures of capacitor elements. With today’s sensitive protection available in numerical relays these failures will be detected and SCBs will {{be taken out of}} service. But determining the phase and section in which capacitor elements have failed is important for utilities to decrease downtime of SCBs. This thesis proposes methods to address the challenges in fault location of SCBs. The proposed methods apply calibrating factors that compensate for pre-existing inherent unbalances, and system voltage unbalances. They can mitigate the gradual capacitance change due to temperature effects or natural aging. The presented fault location methods are further enhanced to detect the number of failed elements. The proposed methods can be integrated into common unbalance protection of the multi-functional numerical SCB relays and put forth solutions to condition monitoring of SCBs. <b>Advance</b> maintenance <b>alarms</b> for fuse saving in externally-fused SCBs, and reducing the search space for the faulty cans with fuseless or internally-fused designs are the significant outcomes of the proposed methods. The proposed methods are simulated in a relay modeled in MATLAB and the voltages/currents are played back from COMTRADE records of PSCAD electromagnetics transient simulations. Detecting consecutive failures, ambiguous failures, and delivering the number of failed elements for each alarm in fault reports are valuable to the utility community and have been verified for the proposed methods...|$|R

The next day, about the place {{where most of the}} old discoverers had been stopped, the RACEHORSE was beset with ice; but they hove her through with ice-anchors. Captain Phipps continued ranging along the ice, northward and westward, till the 24th; he then tried to the eastward. On the 30th he was in latitude 80d 13m; longitude 18d 48m E. among the islands and in the ice, with no appearance of an opening for the ships. The weather was exceedingly fine, mild, and unusually clear. Here they were becalmed in a large bay, with three apparent openings between the islands which formed it; but everywhere, as far as they could see, surrounded with ice.

60|$|It may be {{that the}} Boers wished once for all to have done at all costs with the {{constant}} menace to their rear, or it {{may be that}} the deliberate preparations of Buller for his second <b>advance</b> had <b>alarmed</b> them, and that they realised that they must act quickly if they were to act at all. At any rate, early in the New Year a most determined attack was decided upon. The storming party consisted of some hundreds of picked volunteers from the Heidelberg (Transvaal) and Harrismith (Free State) contingents, led by de Villiers. They were supported by several thousand riflemen, who might secure their success or cover their retreat. Eighteen heavy guns had been trained upon the long ridge, one end of which has been called Caesar's Camp and the other Waggon Hill. This hill, three miles long, lay to the south of the town, and the Boers had early recognised it as being the most vulnerable point, for it was against it that their attack of November 9th had been directed. Now, after two months, they were about to renew the attempt with greater resolution against less robust opponents. At twelve o'clock our scouts heard the sounds of the chanting of hymns in the Boer camps. At two in the morning crowds of barefooted men were clustering round the base of the ridge, and threading their way, rifle in hand, among the mimosa-bushes and scattered boulders which cover the slope of the hill. Some working parties were moving guns into position, and the noise of their labour helped to drown the sound of the Boer advance. Both at Caesar's Camp, the east end of the ridge, and at Waggon Hill, the west end (the points being, I repeat, three miles apart), the attack came as a complete surprise. The outposts were shot or driven in, and the stormers were on the ridge almost as soon as their presence was detected. The line of rocks blazed with the flash of their guns.|$|R
40|$|Excessive {{groundwater}} abstraction is a {{major problem}} in Oman, primarily in the Batinah coastal area where it results in seawater intrusion. The Government began to address the problem in the 1990 s by encouraging the use of more efficient irrigation systems, replacing date palms with winter vegetable crops and using treated wastewater for municipal irrigation. However, 15 years later, seawater intrusion in the Batinah aquifers is still <b>advancing</b> at an <b>alarming</b> pace. This paper analyses the relative merits of strategies to control groundwater pumping based on water quotas, electricity quotas and electricity pricing. A cost benefit approach is used to evaluate the feasibility of three strategies over a period of 25 years and to compare them to the "business as usual" option. Results show that the net present loss to the community when no active policy is implemented amounts to (-$ 288) million. Imposing water quotas on tubewells would give a net present benefit of $ 153 million. However, such quotas would give the lowest present benefit and create inequity among farmers. Other possible approaches would be to control the pumping of groundwater from all wells - tubewells and dug wells - by enforcing energy quotas and by increasing the price of electricity used to pump water. The net present benefits would be greater and the costs to farmers would be more fairly spread. The results of cost-benefit analysis show that enforcing an electricity quota, coupled with removal of the subsidy on the electricity price, is the easiest and most equitable solution to implement. ...|$|R
