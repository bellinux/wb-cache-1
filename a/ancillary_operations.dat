40|$|This {{dissertation}} uses laboratory economic {{experiments to}} test the incentive effects of regulatory policies and practices under asymmetric information conditions. Significant results and policy implications are obtained on the traditional use of rate-of-return regulation (RORR) to regulate natural monopolies, and on the practice of restricting such firms from entering ancillary markets. The objective of the first several chapters is {{to test the}} incentive effects of RORR on market performance. Results confirm long-standing theories of incentive malfunctions of RORR. One result shows that under voluntary compliance, RORR is completely ineffective for regulating single sellers when cost information is private to firms, allowing them to misrepresent costs and earn monopoly profits. When firm's do not know market demand, they capture less surplus, but still earn above RORR expected returns. When stochastic auditing is added varying penalty rates and audit probabilities, significant cost overestimates remain common. Theoretical analysis explains the potential source of this anomaly as being the use of historical cost information in rate setting when excess profits are used as the audit benchmark. Other results show that in perfect repeated static implementations of RORR, wasteful input use will occur manifested as rate base padding or Averch-Johnson type selection of inefficient input combinations. Another chapter addresses the consequences of deregulating RORR franchise firms allowing them to enter ancillary markets. A stylized model of the telecommunications industry is created and experimentally tested to determine if anti-competitive firm behavior results when entry restrictions are lifted. Results offer no support for the arguments that regulated firms will use monopoly market earnings to underwrite <b>ancillary</b> market <b>operations</b> ("deep pocket"), engage in predatory pricing, or unfair competition. Economic arguments for removing entry barriers to improve market performance (increased output and lower prices) are substantiated...|$|R

An integrated lab scale system is currently being designed and built. The next planned stage of development is a pilot plant with a thermal input of about 500 kW, equivalent to about 30, 000 standard liters per hour of hydrogen production. The sulfur-iodine process contains a variety of hazards, including temperatures up to 850 ºC and hazardous chemical species including SO 2, H 2 SO 4, HI, I 2, and of course H 2. The siting and design of a pilot plant must consider these and other hazards. This report presents an initial analysis of the hazards that might affect pilot plant design and should be considered in the initial planning. The general hazards that have been identified include reactivity, flammability, toxicity, pressure, electrical hazards, and industrial hazards such as lifting and rotating equipment. Personnel exposure to these hazards could occur during normal operations, which includes not only running the process at the design conditions but also initial inventory loading, heatup, startup, shutdown, and system flushing before equipment maintenance.

40|$|The all-digital {{transmission}} path {{is quite common}} in today’s FM radio broadcast facility: from contentsource on through to the modulation and RF generation stages. With the above system, stereo generation (MPX) must {{be done in the}} exciter, when it should be performed in the audio processor. Present systems, while they work electronically, pose problems with regards to modulation overshoots due to sample rate converters and the connection method of using AES/EBU. This has been researched and documented with numerous exciters and audio processors. This problem is not limited to just one type of configuration or specific product. This paper offers an in-depth look at these problems, and states their cause. Discussion will reveal a new concept for high performance MPX generation and interconnectivity to an audio processor. In addition, with the advent of HD Radio a new concept for a high performance digital path is presented. OVERVIEW The rollout of HD Radio presents a whole new level of challenge for digital FM exciters and related audio technology. What is the point of a clear, digital transmission if the source is “dirty”? Modulation performance of digital exciters for the analog, or conventional channel, continues to under-whelm broadcasters. We have found that using AES/EBU between the output of an FM audio processor and input to a digital exciter can cause modulation overshoots. This is not a unique problem to one specific processor or exciter. The fundamental problem with AES/EBU connectivity is that the audio is in separate left and right audio channels, forcing the exciter to perform the multiplex stereo generator function. When <b>ancillary</b> <b>operations</b> such as sample rate conversion, additional low pass filtering, and exciter based limiting, are added to the system, overshoots occur...|$|E
40|$|An {{improved}} cryostat {{has been}} developed for cooling a wide panel evenly over its surface to a temperature of - 423 F (approximately equal to - 253 C) by use of liquid helium. Originally, the cryostat was {{to be used in}} measuring apparent strains in wide aluminum/lithium panels as functions of temperature in order to develop data for temperature compensation of the readings of strain gauges on a tank containing liquid hydrogen. Relative to the cryostat used previously for this purpose, the improved cryostat can be prepared for a test in less time, and it loses less helium during each test. Each wide panel to be tested is instrumented with thermocouples in preparation for a test. The previous cryostat was made of two aluminum halves that, for each test, were sandwiched together and sealed around the instrumented wide panel to be tested. The panel was thus enclosed in a plenum. The cryostat and adjacent panel areas protruding from the cryostat were then coated with a thermally insulating foam. During a test, liquid helium was made to flow into the plenum through a port on the bottom. The helium vaporized and expanded, filling the plenum with cold helium gas, which eventually flowed out of the plenum through a port on the top. The nature of the flow was such that {{a significant portion of the}} helium did not come into contact with the wide panel; hence, cooling was less efficient than it might otherwise have been. After completion of each test, the foam and the cryostat were separated from the panel. The cryostat was cleaned and prepared for installation on another instrumented wide panel for the next test. It took 28 hours to install the cryostat onto the instrumented panel, apply the foam, and perform <b>ancillary</b> <b>operations</b> in preparation for a test. The volume of liquid helium consumed during each test was 750 liters. The improved cryostat (see figure) includes an upper section and a lower section, both of which include permanent housings made of a thermally insulating foam 2 -in. (approximately equal to 5 -cm) thick. A liquid-helium- injection manifold is attached to the inside of the top section. The bottom section includes an outlet for helium gas. The manifold contains slots that, when the cryostat is installed on the panel, are located approximately 1 in. (approximately equal to 2. 5 cm) from the wide panel. The array of slots spans a substantial portion of the area of the panel. The top and bottom sections of the cryostat are sealed to the panel by use of polytetrafluoroethylene cord and aluminum tape. Liquid helium is fed into the manifold from the top. The helium leaves the manifold through the slots and thus impinges directly on the panel. Hence, all the helium entering the cryostat must come into contact with the panel before leaving the cryostat. After a test, the cryostat is removed from the panel and reinstalled onto another panel for the next test. Installation of the cryostat on an instrumented panel takes a negligible amount of time, in comparison with the 28 hours associated with the previous cryostat. The amount of liquid helium consumed during a test in the improved cryostat is 500 liters - 250 liters less than before...|$|E
40|$|According to {{the type}} of <b>ancillary</b> service provisioned, <b>{{operation}}</b> mode of a power plant may change to part load operation. In this contribution, part load operation is understood as delivering a lower power output than possible at given ambient temperature because of gas turbine power output control. If it is economically justified, a power plant may operate in the part load mode for longer time. Part load performance of a newly built 80 Â MW combined cycle in Slovakia was studied in order to assess the possibilities for fuel savings. Based on online monitoring data three possibilities were identified: condensate preheating by activation of the currently idle hot water section; change in steam condensing pressure regulation strategy; and the most important gas turbine inlet air preheating. It may seem to be in contradiction with the well proven concept of gas turbine inlet air cooling, which has however been developed for boosting the gas turbine cycles in full load operation. On the contrary, in a combined cycle in the part load operation mode, elevated inlet air temperature does not affect the part load operation of gas turbines but it causes more high pressure steam to be raised in HRSG, which leads to higher steam turbine power output. As a result, less fuel needs to be combusted in gas turbines in order to achieve the requested combined cycle's power output.

40|$|This Determination of Importance Evaluation (DIE) {{applies to}} the Subsurface Exploratory Studies Facility (ESF), {{encompassing}} the Topopah Spring (TS) Loop from Station 0 + 00 meters (m) at the North Portal to breakthrough at the South Portal (approximately 78 + 77 m), the Enhanced Characterization of the Repository Block (ECRB) East-West Cross Drift Starter Tunnel (to approximate ECRB Station 0 + 26 m), and <b>ancillary</b> test and <b>operation</b> support areas in the TS Loop. This evaluation {{applies to the}} construction, operation, and maintenance of these excavations. A more detailed description of these items is provided in Section 6. 0. Testing activities are not evaluated in this DIE. Certain construction activities with respect to testing activities are evaluated; but the testing activities themselves are not evaluated. The DIE for ESF Subsurface Testing Activities (BAJ 3000000 - 01717 - 2200 - 00011 Rev 01) (CRWMS M&O 1998 a) evaluates Subsurface ESF Testing activities. The construction, operation, and maintenance of the TS Loop niches and alcove slot cuts is evaluated herein and is also discussed in CRWMS M&O 1998 a. The construction, operation, and maintenance of the Busted Butte subsurface test area {{in support of the}} Unsaturated Zone (UZ) Transport Test is evaluated in CRWMS M&O 1998 a. Potential test-to-test interference and the waste isolation impacts of testing activities are evaluated in the ESF Subsurface Testing Activities DIE and other applicable evaluation(s) for the Job Package (JP), Test Planning Package (TPP), and/or Field Work Package (FWP). The objectives of this DIE are to determine whether the Subsurface ESF TS Loop and associated excavations, including activities associated with their construction and operation, potentially impact site characterization testing or the waste isolation capabilities of the site. Controls needed to limit any potential impacts are identified. The validity and veracity of the individual tests, including data collection, are the responsibility of the assigned Principal Investigator(s) (PIs) and are not evaluated in this DIE...|$|R
40|$|Scavenging {{energy from}} {{environmental}} sources {{is an active}} area of research to enable remote sensing and microsystems applications. Furthermore, as energy demands soar, {{there is a significant}} need to explore new sources and curb waste. Vibration energy scavenging is one environmental source for remote applications and a candidate for recouping energy wasted by mechanical sources that can be harnessed to monitor and optimize operation of critical infrastructure (e. g. Smart Grid). Current vibration scavengers are limited by volume and <b>ancillary</b> requirements for <b>operation</b> such as control circuitry overhead and battery sources. This dissertation, for the first time, reports a mass producible hybrid energy scavenger system that employs both piezoelectric and electrostatic transduction on a common MEMS device. The piezoelectric component provides an inherent feedback signal and pre-charge source that enables electrostatic scavenging operation while the electrostatic device provides the proof mass that enables low frequency operation. The piezoelectric beam forms the spring of the resonant mass-spring transducer for converting vibration excitation into an AC electrical output. A serially poled, composite shim, piezoelectric bimorph produces the highest output rectified voltage of over 3. 3 V and power output of 145 uW using ¼ g vibration acceleration at 120 Hz. Considering solely the volume of the piezoelectric beam and tungsten proof mass, the volume is 0. 054 cm 3, resulting in a power density of 2. 68 mW/cm 3. Incorporation of a simple parallel plate structure that provides the proof mass for low frequency resonant operation in addition to cogeneration via electrostatic energy scavenging provides a 19. 82 to 35. 29 percent increase in voltage beyond the piezoelectric generated DC rails. This corresponds to approximately 2. 1 nW additional power from the electrostatic scavenger component and demonstrates the first instance of hybrid energy scavenging using both piezoelectric and synchronous electrostatic transduction. Furthermore, it provides a complete system architecture and development platform for additional enhancements that will enable in excess of 100 uW additional power from the electrostatic scavenger...|$|R
