50|$|The primary {{argument}} {{put forward}} by States for restricting ballot access has been the presumption that setting ballot <b>access</b> <b>criteria</b> too low would result in numerous candidates on the ballot, splitting the votes of similar minded voters. Example: With Plurality voting, an old but common way to pick the winner, the candidate with the most votes wins, even if the candidate {{does not have a}} majority of the votes. Suppose 55% liberals and 45% conservatives vote in a district. If two candidates appeal to liberals, but only one appeals to conservatives, the votes of liberals will likely split between the two liberal candidates, for example 25% may vote for one and 30% for the other, giving the conservative the office although 55% preferred to see a liberal in the office. Plurality races, also known as First past the post, tend to cause consolidation among political parties for this reason. However, proponents of ballot access reform say that reasonably easy access to the ballot does not lead to a glut of candidates, even where many candidates do appear on the ballot. The 1880s reform movement that led to officially designed secret ballots had some salutary effects, but it also gave the government control over who could be on the ballot. As historian Peter Argersinger has pointed out, the reform that empowered officials to regulate access onto the ballot, also carried the danger that this power would be abused by officialdom and that legislatures controlled by established political parties (specifically, the Republican and Democratic Parties), would enact restrictive ballot access laws to influence election outcomes to ensure re-election of their party's candidates.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{so-called}} 2 nd generation {{image coding}} methods segment images into homogenous regions {{of various sizes}} adaptively. Each region is then coded with an appropriate method according to its perceptual characteristics. One of our research aims is to extend 2 nd generation image coding methods to meet not only the traditional rate distortion criterion but also the new "easy content <b>access</b> " <b>criterion</b> [6] of image coding. Towards this end, we introduce the region and colour co-occurrence matrix (RACOM), an image content description feature easily computable directly (without decoding) from the compressed domain of 2 nd generation image coding methods, and use it for content-based image retrieval from large image databases. We show that RACOM is a very effective image content descriptor and has a comparable performance to {{state of the art}} techniques for content-based image retrieval. ...|$|R

40|$|Virtualization is an {{important}} enabling technology for many large private datacenters and cloud computing environments. Virtual machines often have complex expectations of their runtime environment such as access to a particular network segment or storage system.

40|$|Gatekeeping theory {{struggles to}} {{describe}} the rise of algorithms and users as information selectors in digital spaces. Algorithms and users may co-exist as decision-makers and reach high visibility through decentralised gatekeeping mechanisms. Classic gatekeeping theory is no longer adequate in describing contemporary news selection processes online and recent gatekeeping approaches at theory-building are isolated and have not been synthesised in a coherent gatekeeping theory. This theoretical paper addresses this issue and develops a digital gatekeeping model in three steps. First, four gatekeeper archetypes are identified that differ in <b>access,</b> selection <b>criteria</b> and publication choices. Second, gatekeeping frequently involves platforms on which gatekeepers operate. These platforms either apply gatekeeping mechanisms controlled by a central authority or rely on collaborations between many micro-level interactions to publish news. Third, a digital gatekeeping model is derived to model the four gatekeeper archetypes and their selection processes in relation to platforms employing collaborative gatekeeping mechanisms. This proposed digital gatekeeping model extends previous research on gatekeeping by synthesising classic gatekeeping theory with contemporary approaches and by providing a framework for future research on information control and dissemination...|$|R
