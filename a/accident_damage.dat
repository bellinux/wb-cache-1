5|$|Elsewhere, Force India {{committed}} {{an error}} when bringing their drivers in early. Liuzzi {{made contact with}} Sutil which damaged his front wing. The team had been expecting Liuzzi to pit before Sutil, but the latter {{was the first to}} arrive into the team's pit stall. It was only after both drivers had returned to the circuit that the team realised they had accidentally placed Liuzzi's tyres on Sutil's car and Sutil's tyres on Liuzzi's. Buemi was pushed back into his garage and became the race's first retirement with <b>accident</b> <b>damage</b> on the second lap. Hamilton was running close behind Vettel but despite his car's straight-line speed advantage, he was unable to affect an overtaking manoeuvre. Hamilton later dropped further away from Vettel. Trulli became afflicted with an gearbox issue which meant he was unable to select second gear, and his mechanics pushed his Lotus T127 back into his garage where they attempted to rectify the issue without success. Alonso recorded lap times faster than teammate Massa which reduced the gap to 1.1 seconds by the conclusion of lap six. Trulli was released from his garage by his team but drove slowly around the circuit and elected to retire on the next lap.|$|E
5|$|Webber passed Rast for sixth place, while Poulsen retired {{because of}} <b>accident</b> <b>damage</b> while {{attempting}} {{to return to the}} pit lane. Dumas held a 24-second advantage over Lotterer with di Grassi in third, while Evans moved back into the LMP2 lead. Both Toyota cars were battling for fourth position with Webber close behind. Webber overtook Davidson for fifth at the Radillion corner exit moving ahead of Sarrazin on the Kemmel straight one lap later. Di Grassi slowed with technical problems and limped into his garage for an engine control unit and front-left nose change. Toyota's No. 1 car was pushed into its garage with mechanical problems; it rejoined the circuit for a few laps until a throttle problem emerged, causing the car to run at a reduced pace. Lotterer retook the lead after the No. 18 Porsche driver switch took longer than expected. Rast passed Conway around the outside for fourth at the Bus Stop chicane. Vilander challenged Lietz for second in LMGTE Pro until Vilander was issued a track limit abuse penalty. Lotterer and Lieb battled each other for first place. Lotterer drove defensively after passing slower traffic going into Les Combes corner to keep the position. Lieb ran wide off the track at the Stavelot corner exit while lapping a slower car.|$|E

25|$|On June 10, 1995, Royal Majesty {{grounded}} on Rose and Crown Shoal about 10 {{miles east}} of Nantucket Island, Massachusetts, and about 17 miles from where the watch officers thought the vessel was. Investigators found that the officers failed to act on visual cues about the vessel's location, over-relying on the automated bridge system. The vessel, with 1,509 persons on board, was en route from St.George’s, Bermuda, to Boston, Massachusetts. There were no deaths or injuries {{as a result of}} this <b>accident.</b> <b>Damage</b> to the vessel and lost revenue, however, were estimated at about $7 million.|$|E
25|$|Following this race, two C41s {{were shipped}} to America {{for use in}} the IMSA GT Championship in 1996. Wheel Works Racing took one of the C41s, and {{selected}} Rick Sutherland, Jean-Paul Libert, and Steve Fossett to drive at the 24 Hours of Daytona. van de Poele joined the trio for the race, but the C41 was forced to retire due to <b>accident</b> <b>damage</b> after 209 laps, restricting them to 49th place. For the 12 Hours of Sebring, van de Poele left the team and switched to Doyle Racing; Dean Hall was selected to replace him. In addition to this, Scott Schubot entered himself and Jérôme Policand in his privately entered C41. The Wheel Works Racing C41 was forced to retire due to <b>accident</b> <b>damage</b> after 56 laps, whilst Schubot's car retired for the same reason after 239 laps; the two teams were classified 53rd and 30th respectively. Wheel Works Racing did not compete with the C41 again, leaving Schubot as the only C41 entrant at the Grand Prix of Atlanta; he took sixth overall in the race, six laps behind the leader. At the Exxon Superflo 500, Schubot crashed the C41 in practice, and drove Support Net Racing's Hawk C-8 instead in the race. He returned to the C41 for the Lime Rock Grand Prix, with the car now using an Oldsmobile engine; he finished the race in 14th place overall, and 11th in the World Sports Car class. At the California Grand Prix, Schubot finished in seventh place, before taking 14th overall, and ninth in class, at the Grand Prix of Dallas. At the Daytona Finale, Schubot's C41 overheated {{prior to the start of}} the race, resulting in him driving for Doyle Racing in the race.|$|E

25|$|For 2006, Thompson joined Jason Plato at SEAT Sport UK. He {{did this}} {{at the same time}} as {{competing}} in the WTCC, meaning he had to skip some BTCC rounds when they clashed with World touring car events. He competed in six of the ten meetings that the BTCC held that year. For most of the season he raced in the second SEAT Sport UK car, but at Silverstone for the final round he used his Red Bull-backed WTCC car. After competing in the first nine races, he was actually ahead of BTCC team leader Plato. Despite having to yield the victory to Plato at Croft, he finished sixth overall, scoring more points per entry than any other SEAT driver; although Plato failed to start two races due to <b>accident</b> <b>damage.</b>|$|E
25|$|In early 2003 Tom Walkinshaw Racing {{collapsed}} {{and the team}} was put up for sale by the administrator. Holden purchased the team, but because manufacturers were prohibited from owning teams, it was quickly sold to Mark Skaife. The K-Mart team was purchased by John and Margaret Kelly, continuing to be a customer of HRT {{until the end of}} 2008. Paul Weel Racing also became a HRT customer with Jason Bright moving to the team with Todd Kelly commencing a five-year stint as the driver of the second car. For the endurance races Jim Richards and Tony Longhurst rejoined the team. Skaife and Kelly won the Sandown 500 with Longhurst and Richards finishing in tenth. At the Bathurst 1000 Skaife and Kelly finished the race in eighth after being black flagged late in the race to repair <b>accident</b> <b>damage</b> with Richards and Longhurst fifth.|$|E
25|$|Following {{successful}} {{trials of}} the initial locomotives, a production run of 43 locomotives were built by English Electric at their Vulcan Foundry between 1965 and 1967. They were initially classified as Class JB and numbered E6007-E6049. They differed slightly from the six earlier machines, most notably having an increased tractive effort {{as well as a}} higher maximum speed (90mph as opposed to 80). Following the introduction of TOPS, they became Class 73/1 and were renumbered 73101-73142. One locomotive, E6027, had already been withdrawn following <b>accident</b> <b>damage</b> and so was not renumbered. Further changes were the use of large round Oleo buffers with a pneumatic withdrawal mechanism rather that the traditional coach style (oval) saddle buffer which relied on a pin and spring mechanism. As the JA examples came in for overhaul over the years, the saddle buffers were also replaced making visual identification of the differing machines almost impossible from a distance.|$|E

500|$|In 2004, Pescarolo Sport {{were the}} only team to use the C60, which they ran as the [...] "Pescarolo C60". The team's first race came in the 1000km of Monza, which formed {{part of the new}} Le Mans Endurance Series (LMES); here, Ayari and Emmanuel Collard took fourth overall, and were the fastest of the non-Audi entrants. For the 24 Hours of Le Mans, Collard partnered Bourdais and Minassian in one C60, whilst Ayari drove with Érik Comas and Benoît Tréluyer in the other. Although the C60 of Collard, Bourdais and Minassian succombed to engine trouble after 282 laps, the Ayari/Comas/Tréluyer {{finished}} fourth overall, and fastest of the non-Audi runners once more. Hélary was selected to partner Ayari at the 1000km of Nürburgring, and this time the pair brought the C60 home in fifth overall. Pescarolo's last race of the season came at the 1000km of Spa, where Gounon and Ayari lasted nine laps before being forced to retire due to <b>accident</b> <b>damage.</b> Pescarolo finished the LMES season in fifth place, level on points with Team Jota.|$|E
