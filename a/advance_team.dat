Ford {{attended}} Wayne State University and Grambling State University, from which he was expelled in 1969 before graduating for leading civil rights demonstrations. He was expelled by the university, despite it being historically black, because it relied on public funds which were controlled by a state government opposed to desegregation.

500|$|In {{the evening}} of 26 December 1941, Sibu people started to ransack an {{unguarded}} government rice storeroom. Some villagers staying along the Rajang River also came to steal for daily necessities. The situation soon got out of control. British Sime Darby company, Borneo Company Limited, and Chinese businessmen became {{the victims of the}} riots. The Chinese businessman decided to form a security alliance to calm down the chaos. On 29 January 1942, a Japanese <b>advance</b> <b>team</b> was invited from Kuching to restore order in Sibu. The <b>advance</b> <b>team</b> later fled Sibu and back to Kuching. The power vacuum continued to exist in the third division until 23 June 1942, when the Japanese headquarter in Kuching sent Senda-Ni-Jiro (千田倪次郎) to become the new Resident of the Third Division of Sarawak. After he took office, he immediately declared that Imperial Japanese Army would take total control of people's lives and property. On 8 August 1942, Sibu was renamed to [...] "Sibu-shu" [...] (志布州).|$|E
500|$|Red Butte ( [...] west) — Red Butte was {{the most}} tragic site of the Mormon Trail. After {{crossing}} the Platte River, the Martin Handcart Company camped near Red Butte as heavy snow fell. Snow continued to fall for three days, and the company {{came to a halt}} as many emigrants died. For nine days the company remained there, while 56 persons died from cold or disease. Finally, on October 28, an <b>advance</b> <b>team</b> of three men from the Utah rescue party reached them. The rescuers encouraged them that help was on the way and urged the company to start moving on.|$|E

They had voyaged {{to the new world}} on board the Sparrow, an English fishing-vessel which was sailing to the coast of modern-day Maine. After arriving at the coast of Maine, they traveled the final [...] in a shallop with three members of the Sparrows crew. These colonists stayed only briefly in Plymouth before scouting the coast in their shallop to find a site for their colony. After finding one, they negotiated with the sachem Aberdecest for the land and returned to Plymouth, sending the shallop and her small crew back to the Sparrow, and awaited the remainder of the colonists.|$|E

500|$|Emigration Canyon (Donner Hill) ( [...] west) — About a {{year before}} the Latter-day Saint emigrants, the Reed–Donner wagon train carved the first road through the final {{geographic}} obstacle between Big Mountain and the Salt Lake Valley. About halfway through, the group changed course and went up and around the final constriction near the valley's mouth. The resulting exhaustingly brutal climb over rock and sage most likely contributed to the historic tragedy that befell the travelers three months and [...] to the west.

At the same time, {{the members of the}} Willie Company reached the end of their supplies of flour. A small <b>advance</b> <b>team</b> from the rescue party found their camp and gave them a small amount of flour, but then pushed on to the east to try to locate the Martin Company. Captain James Willie and Joseph Elder went ahead through the snow to find the main rescue party and inform them of the Willie Company's peril. On October 23, {{with the help of the}} rescue party, the Willie Company pushed ahead through the biting wind and snow up Rocky Ridge, a rough [...] section of the trail that ascends to a ridge in order to bypass a section of the Sweetwater River valley that is impassable.|$|E

The city council was concerned that Zeckendorf commit to specifics, and feared that the developer would agree to build but then scale back his plans {{in ways that would}} fail to achieve the hoped-for redevelopment goals. Zeckendorf's mounting interest brought an agreement on these issues on August 15. He signed a contract with Mayor Celebrezze in which he agreed to build a 1,000-to-1,500 room hotel, a [...] office building, and a [...] "trade mart" [...] at a total cost of $45 million ($ in [...] dollars)—but only if voters approved the bond issue financing construction.
