5|$|Agricultural {{improvement}} and the Industrial Revolution came to Aberdaron in the 19th century. The Inclosure (Consolidation) Act 1801 {{was intended to}} make it easier for landlords to enclose and improve common land, introduce increased efficiency, bring more land under the plough, and reduce the high prices of agricultural production. Rhoshirwaun Common, following strong opposition, was enclosed in 1814; while the process was not completed in Aberdaron, Llanfaelrhys and Y Rhiw until 1861. On the industrial front, mining developed as <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>source</b> of employment, especially at Y Rhiw, where manganese was discovered in 1827.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1600s, the Sihanaka {{had already}} {{established}} themselves {{as one of}} the island's most important trading groups. Their location on the main trade route between the coast and the Merina capital of Antananarivo enabled them to become important trading partners beginning in the 18th century; slave trading was <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>source</b> of income until outlawed under Radama I in the 1810s. The Sihanaka women also produced pottery, which was baked using wood collected by men in the surrounding forests.|$|E
5|$|Coropuna is drained by deep gorges, {{with water}} {{eventually}} reaching the Arma and Majes rivers, {{both of which}} empty into the Pacific Ocean. During the dry season, Coropuna's glaciers are <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>source</b> of water for the region, and concern has been raised that their disappearance may result in water shortages {{at a time when}} population growth has increased water consumption and begun to create conflict over water distribution. 30,000 people depend on the Coropuna glacier in one way or the other, 8,000 of them just for their water supply.|$|E

5|$|Greater Manchester {{is mainly}} urban, {{and is one}} of the most densely {{populated}} regions in Europe. In the second half of the 18thcentury, the Industrial Revolution played an important role in the growth and development of Manchester and its surrounding area, and industry continues to be a major part of the region's economy. There are few buildings surviving from before the Industrial Revolution, but many from the 19th and 20thcenturies. The bedrock consists mainly of Carboniferous sandstones, including millstone grit, which is <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>source</b> of building material for the region's churches. The superficial deposits are of boulder clay, which provides material for making bricks.|$|E

The Bannock and the Northern Paiute suffered from violence during the conflict, and once the white settlers had won the war, the natives were allotted into various reservations.

5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, American musical theater was <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>source</b> for popular songs, {{many of which}} {{influenced}} blues, jazz, country, and other extant styles of popular music.

Theatrical composers and lyricists like the brothers George and Ira Gershwin created a uniquely American theatrical style that used American vernacular speech and music. Musicals featured popular songs and fast-paced plots that often revolved around love and romance.|$|E
