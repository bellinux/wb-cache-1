In the context of epilepsy surgery, this new approach has been performed and validated on 15 patients with depth electrode implantations...|$|E
30|$|Another {{option for}} imaging in the {{intervention}} room is proposed by Beijst et al. [122]. The authors propose a hybrid imaging system, consisting of an X-ray c-arm combined with gamma imaging capabilities for simultaneous real-time fluoroscopic and nuclear imaging. A slightly modified version of this prototype [123] was shown {{to be able to}} accurately estimate LSF of a 99 mTc-MAA scout dose in an interventional setting [124]. When this hybrid imaging modality becomes available in the <b>angiography</b> <b>room,</b> {{it may be possible to}} move towards 1 -day procedures by combining scout and therapy dose in one session.|$|E
30|$|We used a 64 multidetector-row CT (64 MDCT) scanner {{installed}} in an <b>angiography</b> <b>room.</b> The scanner and the angiography suite {{have a common}} tabletop, removing the need to transfer the patient between procedures. A 64 MDCT scanner (0.5  sec/rotation, pitch factor 1.484; INFX 8000 -C Aquilion CX, Toshiba Medical, Tochigi, Japan) with collimation and detector thickness each of 0.5  mm was used for MDCTAo. The arterial scans were reconstructed with slice thickness and slice interval each of 0.5  mm, and maximum intensity projection (MIP) and volume-rendered (VR) images were produced instantly using a three-dimensional (3 D) workstation (ZIO Station, ZIO Soft, Tokyo, Japan). Tube voltage was 120 kVp with tube mA determined automatically.|$|E

40|$|Colloque avec actes et comité de lecture. During an interventional neuroradiology exam, {{knowing the}} exact {{location}} of the catheter tip with respect to the patient can dramatically help the physician. An image registration between digital subtracted angiography (DSA) images and a volumic pre-operative image (magnetic resonance or computed tomography volumes) is a way to infer this important information. This mono-patient multimodality matching can be reduced to finding the projection matrix that transforms any voxel of the volume onto the DSA image plane. This modelization is unfortunately not valid in the case of distorted images, which is the case for DSA images. A classical <b>angiography</b> <b>room</b> can now generate 3 D X-ray angiography volumes (3 DXA). Since the DSA images are obtained with the same machine, {{it should be possible to}} deduce the projection matrix from the sensor data indicating the current machine position.

30|$|The {{concept of}} {{installing}} a CT scanner and angiography {{unit in the}} same room, utilizing a shared tabletop, originated in Japan for conducting CT during arterial portography (CTAP) and CT hepatic arteriography (CTHA) (Matsui et al. [1985]; Hayashi et al. [2002]; Honda et al. [2000]; Kitao et al. [2009]; Matsui et al. [2011]). The combined facility is termed angio CT or interventional radiology CT (IVRCT). Angio CT is particularly useful for investigating the hemodynamics of small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and has enabled improved understanding of the growth process from early HCC to mature HCC (Matsui et al. [1985]; Hayashi et al. [2002]; Honda et al. [2000]; Kitao et al. [2009]; Matsui et al. [2011]; Lee et al. [2002]). Hepatoma-feeding arteriograms that were created by MDCT during aortography (MDCTAo) were previously reported to be displayed on the monitor in the <b>angiography</b> <b>room</b> and used for catheterization of feeding arteries to a HCC (Minamiguchi et al. [2013]). Accordingly, {{it should be possible}} to apply MDCTAo to patients with acute arterial bleeding, to map the hemorrhage site and to navigate catheterization to the artery responsible for hemorrhage.|$|E
30|$|Possible {{adverse events}} {{following}} TAE for hemorrhagic duodenal diverticulum include ischemic damage, duodenal obstruction, pancreatitis, and re-bleeding. In an experimental swine study, embolization {{of three or}} fewer vasa recta with NBCA-Lp induced no damage or necrosis of the mucosal or submucosal layers in one-fourth of the intestinal circumference, while embolization of five or more vasa recta induced total necrosis of the whole intestinal circumference (Jae et al. 2008; Ikoma et al. 2010). The number of embolized vasa recta in the experimental study does not always assure the safety of embolization with NBCA-Lp in human. Kwon reported a case of duodenal obstruction caused by duodenal wall thickening and periventricular fibrosis that occurred 2 weeks after TAE had been conducted for duodenal diverticular hemorrhage (Kwon et al. 2009). In the present case, several vasa recta were occluded and a hemi-circumferential ulcer detected on the ventral wall of the ascending duodenum after TAE, was cured by conservative medicine. It took several minutes for HRA-VR image {{to come out on}} the monitor of <b>angiography</b> <b>room,</b> If HRA-VR derived from MDCT during aortography created more speedily, the embolization of the first jejnum artery would be avoided.|$|E

30|$|In {{the last}} 3  years at our institute, 71 {{patients}} {{suspected of having}} acute arterial bleeding underwent MDCTAo, using MDCT installed in the <b>angiography</b> <b>room.</b> Because most patients were in a critical state of shock, receiving continuous blood transfusion and requiring emergent hemostasis by embolization, CT angiography via the venous route was not always performed. Most patients retained consciousness and could perform breath holding. We generally did not conduct MDCTAo in unresponsive patients. However, when we did perform MDCTAo on unconscious, ventilated patients, the respirator was used to perform breath holding. No patients with pelvic fractures were included in this series, except one patient who had multiple fractures of bilateral iliac, ischial and pubic bones, causing hemorrhagic shock. Of the 71 patients, 69 received MDCTAo, and 2 received CT during superior mesenteric arteriography because the responsible arteries were already known to branch from the superior mesenteric artery. The origins of the acute arterial bleeding in the 71 patients were as follows: hemoptysis (n[*]=[*] 27); hemothorax (n[*]=[*] 2); bleeding post-pancreatectomy (n[*]=[*] 12); intraperitoneal bleeding (n[*]=[*] 3); gastrointestinal bleeding (n[*]=[*] 6); retroperitoneal bleeding (n[*]=[*] 9); uterine bleeding (n[*]=[*] 3); bleeding into the urinary bladder, (n[*]=[*] 3); pelvic fracture (n[*]=[*] 1); intra-pelvic hematoma (n[*]=[*] 1); and subcutaneous hematoma on the trunk (n[*]=[*] 4).|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Transcranial {{approaches}} for transsinusal endovascular therapy of DAVF have been sporadically reported by large craniectomies. Large craniectomies carry nevertheless {{a risk of}} postembolization extradural hematoma, reduced by delaying the endovascular procedure. We report a 1 -session technique of SIGC for percutaneous transvenous DAVF embolization. CASE DESCRIPTION: This 58 -year-old woman developed a right-sided cerebellar hematoma in relation with a high-grade left transverse and sigmoid sinus DAVF. The DAVF was fed by branches from the left vertebral artery, left internal, and left external carotid arteries, draining into the transverse sinus with retrograde flow in cortical veins. Transvenous retrograde embolization was not feasible either through the left internal jugular vein because of thrombosis, or through the right one because of torcular septa. During the same anaesthetic session, a 5 -cm-length selective craniectomy was shaped under magnetic resonance image guidance navigation according to the left transverse sinus with high-speed drill. Thereafter, back in the <b>angiography</b> <b>room,</b> the transverse sinus was taped and coiled resulting in a complete exclusion of the DAVF. CONCLUSION: Selective image-guided craniectomy is efficient and safe for direct percutaneous transvenous embolization of DAVF in a single anesthetic session. Leaving bone beside the sinus prevents a parenchymal traumatic puncture. This bone has nevertheless to be drilled to allow an adequate sharp puncture angle. Doing so, postoperative hematoma is prevented by the small bone opening, the natural adherence of the dura matter {{and the possibility of}} direct compression...|$|E
40|$|Background/purposeTo {{assess the}} risk factors for {{intractable}} and controllable postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) and to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and outcome of transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE). MethodsAn emergency PPH rescue system including the 24 -hour-available TAE was established in 2004. TAE with gelatine sponge particles placed on bilateral uterine or internal iliac arteries served as the first-line treatment for intractable PPH. Delivery methods, parity, causes of bleeding, clinical vital signs, coagulopathy, success rate, resumption of menstruation, and subsequent pregnancy outcome after TAE were recorded. ResultsFrom the years 2005 to 2013, 301 women experienced PPH, of whom 178 had controllable PPH and 123 intractable PPH. Tachycardia and disseminated intravascular coagulation were significant risk factors for intractable PPH. All of the women with intractable PPH underwent TAE, and 89 (72. 3 %) were transferred by ground transport to receive treatment in this system. The mean travel distance was 15  km ±  12. 5  km. The mean time of order to <b>angiography</b> <b>room</b> was 24. 9 minutes ±  14. 2 minutes. The mean blood loss before TAE was 2247  mL ±  1482  mL (range, 900 – 11, 110  mL). The first TAE successfully controlled bleeding in 118 of the 123 (95. 9 %) women with intractable PPH. Of the 70 women with complete follow-up, 69 (98. 6 %) recovered menstruation. Twenty-three women tried to get pregnant and 19 (82. 6 %) of them succeeded, giving birth to 12 full-term live infants. ConclusionTAE was safe and effective in treating intractable primary PPH with a high success rate and preservation of menstruation and fertility...|$|E
40|$|Thigh pseudoaneurysms {{are rare}} {{compared}} to pseudoaneurysms of the groin, and usually result from direct injury to an arterial branch. Direct open repair can {{be associated with}} a large volume blood loss. The authors describe a combined endovascular and surgical approach to a large, traumatic, pseudoaneurysm of the thigh. The patient was a 49 -year-old man with a history of left femur fracture treated by open reduction and internal fixation, who presented with a painfully swollen left thigh. Duplex ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) scan suggested a large (7. 7 x 5. 0 x 6. 3 cm) pseudoaneurysm that appeared to be associated with a branch of the deep femoral artery. In the operating <b>room,</b> <b>angiography</b> was used to identify and selectively access the feeding artery. This artery was then successfully coil embolized, allowing surgical decompression of the thigh with minimal effort and blood loss.

40|$|BackgroundCircumflex {{coronary}} artery (CCA) injury during mitral valve surgery {{is a rare}} but serious complication whit difficult diagnosis. The aim of our study was to describe the elements of diagnosis that could allow prevention of this complication. Method and resultsFrom 2006 to 2013 in Rouen University Hospital, 8 patients (1. 03 %) among 775 undergoing mitral valve surgery (repair or replacement) presented CCA occlusion confirmed by coronary angiography. Sex ratio was 5 men for 3 women {{with a mean age}} of 54. 2 years. Left main coronary dominance was present in 75 %. Mitral valve repair was performed in 5 patients and valve replacement in 3. The diagnosis was suspected by ECG in 7 / 8 patients: 6 patients (75 %) presented ST segment elevation, 1 had permanent AV block while EKG was normal in one. CCA occlusion led to a significant impairment of left ventricular function, median LVEF: decreased from 58 to 43 % (p= 0. 04) although coronary angiography was performed within one hour in 5 patients (62. 5 %). Five had complete revascularization (4 of those with immediate coronary angiography), while 3 were treated medically. Occlusion, assessed by coronary angiography, was preferentially located on the superolateral quarter of the mitral annulus next to the anterolateral commissure predominantly on its mid portion (75 %). As regards to the mechanism of CCA occlusion, 37. 5 % of patients had a stitch passing through the CCA, 50 % had a kinking of the vessel due to a stitch located close to the CCA and one of them had a compressive hematoma. Follow-up at day- 7 was uneventful in 7 patients with one in-hospital death one day after the surgery (cardiac tamponade). ConclusionCCA injury is a rare but serious complication of mitral valve surgery suspected on ECG, due to a stitch always located at the same point of mitral annulus. An eventual intraoperative <b>angiography</b> in hybrid <b>rooms</b> could be a specific solution for patients at risk (large mitral ring, left main coronary dominance) ...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE. Portal {{pressure}} is measured invasively as Hepatic Venous Pressure Gradient (HVPG) in the <b>angiography</b> <b>room.</b> Liver stiffness measured by Fibroscan {{was shown to}} correlate with HVPG values below 12 mmHg. This is not surprising, since in cirrhosis the increase of portal {{pressure is}} not directly linked with liver fibrosis and consequently to liver stiffness. We hypothesized that, given the spleen’s privileged location upstream to the whole portal system, splenic stiffness could provide relevant information about portal pressure. Aim {{of the study was}} to assess the relationship between liver and spleen stiffness measured by Virtual Touch™ (ARFI) and HVPG in cirrhotic patients. METHODS. 40 consecutive patients (30 males, mean age 62 y, mean BMI= 26, mean Child-Pugh A 6, mean platelet count= 92. 000 /mmc, 19 HCV+, 7 with ascites) underwent to ARFI stiffness measurement (10 valid measurements in right liver lobe both surface and centre, left lobe and 20 in the spleen) and HPVG, blindly to each other. Median ARFI values of 10 samplings on every liver area and of 20 samplings on spleen were calculated. RESULTS. Stiffness could be easily measured in all patients with ARFI, resulting a mean of 2, 61 ± 0, 76, 2, 5 ± 0, 62 and 2, 55 ± 0, 66 m/sec in the liver areas and 3. 3 ± 0, 5 m/s in the spleen. Median HPVG was 14 mmHg (range 5 - 27); 28 patients showed values ≥ 10 mmHg. A positive significant correlation was found between spleen stiffness and HPVG values (r= 0. 744, p 0, 05). AUROC was calculated to test spleen stiffness ability in discriminating patients with HVPG ≥ 10. AUROC = 0. 911 was obtained, with sensitivity of 69...|$|E
40|$|Elevated {{glucose level}} on {{admission}} {{in the number}} of emergency conditions, including acute myocardial infarction (AMI), is linked to worse outcomes, regardless of the current treatment. The introduction of primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) in therapy of AMI patients with ST segment elevation (STEMI) has improved the treatment of these patients. However, there are contradictory evidences regarding the impact of stressinduced hyperglycemia on the treatment outcome. The present study is aimed to indentify the effect of stress-induced hyperglycemia on in-hospital prognosis of patients with STEMI treated with AIM-PPCI. Prospective study included 116 patients with a diagnosis of first AMI-STEMI treated with PPCI at the Department of Cardiovascular Diseases, Clinical Center Niš in the period 2010 - 2011. Immediately after establishing the diagnosis, the patients with adequate medicament preparation were transferred into the <b>angiography</b> <b>room</b> for the coronary stent implantation. Laboratory analysis of the whole blood samples were done immediately after admission and in the next 24 hours. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed that stress-induced hyperglycemia (glucose 11. 2 mmol / L, an area under the curve of 0. 812) is a delimiting factor for distinguishing the outcome and survival of patients on admission. The group of patients without stress-induced hyperglycemia had mortality rate about five times less (1 / 79 - 1. 2 %) than the group of patients with stress-induced hyperglycemia (5 / 37 - 13. 5 %), p= 0. 041. Comparing these groups with the incidence of DM, stress-induced hyperglycemia had no significant effect on mortality in the group without DM (1 / 54 vs. 3 / 26, ns) and in the group with DM (1 / 25 vs. 1 / 11, ns). The cut-off value of glucose, obtained by ROC curve, is 11. 2 mmol/L for stressinduced hyperglycemia in patients with STEMI treated with PPCI. This value could determine a significant gradient of risk: patients with glycemia < 11. 2 mmol/L on admission had almost five times lower risk of mortality in hospital than those with the level of glucose ≥ 1. 2 mmol/L. Stress-induced hyperglycemia has an equally bad effect on hospital survival in the groups with and without DM...|$|E
