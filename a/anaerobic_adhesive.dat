40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to determine if <b>anaerobic</b> <b>adhesive</b> {{can be used as a}} prevailing torque locking feature. Maintaining preload in critical joints is the usual standard that anaerobic adhesives are held to in aerospace and other industry. To test if <b>anaerobic</b> <b>adhesive</b> can be used as a prevailing torque locking feature a test procedure was developed and implemented to measure the removal torque of threaded fasteners after an allotted cure time. In total, 191 threaded fasteners of different material and coatings were tested in the unseated and seated states with various strengths and varieties of <b>anaerobic</b> <b>adhesive.</b> A series of three tests were conducted: initial use, reuse with no added <b>anaerobic</b> <b>adhesive,</b> and a third test with added product to the bolt and nut to see how removal torque would behave in these conditions.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results from}} tests {{to assess the}} use of <b>anaerobic</b> <b>adhesive</b> for providing a prevailing torque locking feature in threaded fasteners. Test procedures are developed and tests are performed on three fastener materials, four anaerobic adhesives, and both unseated assembly conditions. Five to ten samples are tested for each combination. Tests for initial use, reuse without additional adhesive, and reuse with additional adhesive are performed for all samples. A 48 -hour cure time was used for all initial use and reuse tests. Test data are presented as removal torque versus removal angle with the specification required prevailing torque range added for performance assessment. Percent specification pass rates for the all combinations of fastener material, adhesive, and assembly condition are tabulated and reveal use of <b>anaerobic</b> <b>adhesive</b> as a prevailing torque locking feature is viable. Although not every possible fastener material and <b>anaerobic</b> <b>adhesive</b> combination provides prevailing torque values within specification, any combination can be assessed using the test procedures presented. Reuse without additional <b>anaerobic</b> <b>adhesive</b> generally provides some prevailing torque, {{and in some cases}} within specification.

40|$|By using reverse phase high {{performance}} liquid chromatography (HPLC) and chelating agents such as dithiocarbamates or 8 -hydroxyquinoline {{it was possible}} to separate a range of metal ions which are of importance in the polymerisation chemistry of anaeorbic adhesives. These metal-chelate complexes can be formed 2 ̆ 7 in-situ 2 ̆ 7 or externally. 2 ̆ 7 In-situ 2 ̆ 7 complexation involves incorporating the chelating agent into the mobile phase and external formation involves mixing the appropriate metal ions with the chelating agent prior to HPLC separation. Using sodium diethyldithiocarbamate as the chelating agent, {{it was possible to}} selectively separate metal ions such as Ni(II), Co(lII) and Fe(lll), using a C^g reverse phase system with ultraviolet detection at 254 nm. The main disadvantage of sodium diethyldithiocarbamate was that it does not have the selectivity to fully resolve Cu(II) and Fe(IIl). These are two most important metal ions in <b>anaerobic</b> <b>adhesive</b> chemistry, and it was therefore decided to investigate an alternative chelating agent. This alternative ligand was 8 -hydroxyquinoline, and using this it was possible to resolve Cu(II) and Fe(lII) as their oxinate complexes using reverse phase {{high performance}} liquid chromatography with a mobile phase of acetonitrile: 0. 02 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 6. 0), _ 3 (50 : 50, v/v) which was 5 x 10 M in 8 -hydroxyquinoline and 0. 1 M in KNO^ with ultra-violet detection at 400 nm. An extraction system was then developed which extracted the metal ions, namely Cu(II) and Fe(III), from <b>anaerobic</b> <b>adhesive</b> formulations and <b>anaerobic</b> <b>adhesive</b> raw materials. This extraction system showed that the raw materials used in the formulation contained levels of Cu(II) and Fe(III) which if not complexed by EDTA would cause premature polymerisation of adhesive. There was also Fe(III) present in the water which was throughout the analysis, so background corrections were needed to considered at every step. The extraction method was applied to anaeorbic adhesive products 290 and 270.

An introduction is given in chapter one into the general chemistry of adhesives and their analysis, with particular emphasis on anaerobic adhesives and the crucial role played by transition metals in the cure chemistry. In order to elucidate the role played by tertiary amines and saccahrin in anaerobic adhesives, polarography was used to monitor the concentrations of various transition metal species in the presence of selected cure components. In addition, cyclic voltammetry was used to measure the oxidation potentials of <b>anaerobic</b> <b>adhesive</b> accelerators at a range of pH values. A polarographic study of the reactions of elemental copper and iron in the presence of 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydroquinoline based cure systems was carried out in chapter three. The ability of iron and copper ions to decompose cumene hydroperoxide, and the influence of <b>anaerobic</b> <b>adhesive</b> accelerators on these reactions, was also studied. In chapter four, a brief introduction is given into the autoxidation of N-phenyl- 2 - propyl- 3, 5 -diethyl-l, 2 -dihydropyridine (DHP) and its potential as an initiator in rapid curing, surface insensitive one-part adhesives. A variety of analytical techniques were then used, including spectrophotometry and an enzyme-based biosensor, to conclusively prove that hydrogen peroxide is generated in the autoxidation of DHP.

40|$|Anaerobic {{adhesives}} are thermosetting {{acrylic polymers}} {{commonly used to}} improve the performance of most metal joints. Researches on the static strength of hybrid joints, available in the technical litera-ture, show scanty and contradictory results that do not explain the effect of <b>anaerobic</b> <b>adhesive</b> on the hybrid joint behaviour. An early study {{by one of the}} authors of the present study formulates a micro-mechanical model describing the shear power of anaerobic adhesives as a function of the intimate properties of adherends and adhesive at the interface.

These adhesives have shown a good performance with threaded components with Cr[VI] coatings. Hexavalent chromium is a carcinogenic material so its use is limited or prohibited by environmental regulations in several countries, such as the United States and the European Union. In order to avoid this problem, non-chromated zinc coatings are used. However, anaerobic adhesives are not very effective with these types of coatings.

40|$|The {{motivation}} {{of this research}} is to explore the viability of a method to directly verify whether or not an <b>anaerobic</b> <b>adhesive</b> within a threaded fastener assembly has cured sufficiently to provide secondary locking. Direct verification was implemented via the application of a test torque in the loosening direction of a fastener assembly with Loctite (given a 24 hour cure time). A three phase test plan was developed with the intent of identifying and utilizing this verification torque value which is unique to a given fastener assembly. It was proved that the direct verification method, as outlined in the test plan, was in fact a valid method of verification in some cases. Results were dependent on the materials and coatings of the fastener assemblies. The curing properties of the liquid locking compound (LLC) with plain steel specimens resulted in a verification test that could accurately predict sufficient locking and cure (using distributions in torque measurements). Tests with zinc coated and stainless steel specimens, however, did not produce the same level of predictability in cure as the plain steel specimens. The direct verification method as defined herein is not suited to certain materials and coatings. The less predictable curing properties of the stainless steel specimens caused complications in determining a verification torque that could reliably determine cure, resulting in dropping stainless steel from static and dynamic testing. The zinc coated specimen data was more consistent, but the adhesive did not add sufficient breakaway strength to the fastener assembly needed to define a usable verification value. These results led {{to the conclusion that the}} direct verification method as presented in this work is limited to more active material selections. One possibility to improve the secondary locking of less active materials is the use of a higher strength adhesive. Testing to observe the effect of application of verification torque on the secondary locking was also performed. Multiple verifications were found to be destructive to the point that just over a third of samples failed that might have otherwise passed a single verification test. The single verification testing, on the other hand, caused substantially less locking mechanism degradation, leading to the use of a single verification torque in further testing...|$|E

A key {{point of the}} method is that joining is vertically arranged and a forced air supply with a given amount of the airflow pressure and temperature is directed from the bottom end towards upper one. This method allows locking the adhesive composition in the gap and arrangement of conditions for curing an adhesive composition without its outflow.

In the course of experiments an empirical dependence of the critical shearing force on the gap value in the join has been derived, as well as the recommended conditions for air quality to hold the adhesive compositions depending on viscosity has been revealed. As a result of experimental research, it is found that for adhesive composition of low-viscosity from 20 to 1000 cSt, a range of air quality for holding the adhesive composition in the assembly gap is from 9. 8 to 196 Pa; for adhesive composition of middle-viscosity from 1000 to 2000 cSt, the recommended conditions lie in the range from 197 to 735. 5 Pa; for adhesive composition of high-viscosity from 2000 to 5000 cSt, the recommended assembly conditions are from 736 to 1471 Pa. The realized studies have shown that using a new joining method, the amount of used adhesive composition is by about 25 % less, the labor hours of the joining process are two times decreased, and the joining strength obtained is increased on average by 10 - 15 % as compared to the traditional assembly methods of the adhesive cylindrical joint.

Nemes paper gives an analytical solution for the different stresses that appear on the three elements of the cylindrical assembly (two tubes and the adhesive) over the whole joining surface.

From the mechanical and geometrical properties of the components and the axial loading applied on the system, it has been possible to obtain the intensity and distribution of stresses in the assembly graphically, using the mathematical program MathCAD. Consequently, it is possible to calculate the so far unknown value of maximum shear stress. So knowing the shear stress, the model allows (i) to predict the distribution of stresses in the adhesive bond and (ii) to carry out a parametric study of the bond; that is to say, it allows to evaluate the influence of geometrical parameters and the influence of the selected adhesive in the stress distribution within the bond. It is, therefore, a methodology, which will make possible to calculate, quickly and simply, the distribution of stresses and the maximum shear strength in the adhesive.

A minimum {{hydrolysis}} time {{is required}} to get an adequate crosslinking between a silane film and a metallic substrate and {{that depends on the}} contents of silane, ethanol, and water in the silane solution. The objectives for this work are: 1) to study the effect of different ratios of ethanol/water on the hydrolysis time for a 1 % bis-sulfur silane solution at pH 6, by attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy. The different solutions studied correspond to different ratios of silane/ethanol/water by volume. The study was done following appearance of the siloxane and silanol groups and the disappearance of the ethoxysilane groups. 2) Also studied was the adhesion and corrosion behaviour of bis-sulfur silane (bis[3 -(bis[3 -(triethoxysilyl) propyl]disulfide, DS) in solutions of ethanol/water at pH 4 and 6 and γ-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (MPS) coatings obtained by a two-step process on galvanized steel samples. This coated surface was analysed by reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy (FTIR-RA), scanning electron miscroscopy (SEM), and polarization curves. Results obtained at pH 6 were compared with the ones for pH 4. Single lap shear tests were used to contrast the behaviour of <b>anaerobic</b> <b>adhesives</b> on electrogalvanized steel silanized samples. It was observed that higher hydrolysis time was necessary to get good adhesion behaviour if the solution was prepared at pH 4, while at pH 6 the best behaviour was observed for short hydrolysis times...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study into the {{application}} of separation techniques {{to the analysis of}} both industrial and environmental sample matrices. Chapter 1 is a literature survey into the background of <b>adhesives</b> (both <b>anaerobic</b> and cyanoacrylic <b>adhesives).</b> The literature survey also details the composition of adhesives and their analysis. Chapter 2 details an analytical study into the decomposition of the key reducing agents found in <b>anaerobic</b> <b>adhesives,</b> including acetyl phenylhydrazine, tetrahydroquinoline, dimethyl-/?-toluidine and (p-toluene suphonyl) hydrazine. A suitable HPLC separation system was developed, which was then used to monitor any decomposition of the reducing agents. Investigation of the above was carried out in the presence of saccharin, maleic acid and cumene hydroperoxide (both in the presence and absence of the transition metals, copper and iron). Comparison of the rates of decomposition of the reducing agents revealed some information into the role of the acids and peroxide in the overall reaction mechanism. The products produced {{as a result of these}} reactions were also identified using preparative TLC and techniques such as IR, NMR and mass spectrometry. Chapter 3 details the development of a suitable method of anion separation using capillary electrophoresis. A suitable extraction technique was also developed which could extract the anions from the adhesive mixture (both crude and distilled preparations), into an aqueous medium. The method developed was amenable to the analysis of the full range of cyanoacrylate adhesive mixtures (methyl-, ethyl-, butyland methoxy ethyl-cyanoacrylates). Chapter 4 involved the development of an electrochemical system that was capable of detecting microcystins. The work also involved HPLC mobile phase optimisation, microcystin purification and microcystin extraction (both from ‘pure bacterial cultures’ and field samples). An electrochemical detector was developed which was capable of detecting microcystins, it was also capable of detecting other polypeptides (found in partially purified microcystins) which were not detected using UV detection. The main problem encountered was the detection of the microcystins in field samples as other proteins found in field samples were also electrochemically active. Conclusions drawn from the work carried out in the thesis, and suggestions for future research are outlined in Chapter 5...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} {{application}} of modern electroanalytical techniques to the determination of analytes in complex media. The recent large increase in publications applying electroanalytical techniques to environmental, pharmaceutical and clinical applications is discussed in Chapter 1, including a discussion of electrode materials and their applications, the use of modified electrodes to improve selectivity and reduce electrode passivation, in addition to an overview of the use of electrochemical detection in flowing solution analysis. Chapter 2 describes the use of polarography at a dropping mercury electrode to investigate the cure chemistry o f <b>anaerobic</b> <b>adhesives.</b> The influence of transition metal ions, in the presence of accelerators, on the catalytic decomposition of the free radical initiators /-Butyl perbenzoate, /-Butyl hydroperoxide and benzoyl peroxide is discussed. The determination of clenbuterol in bovine urine is discussed in Chapter 3. The electrochemical characteristics of the | 3 -agonist were investigated at a bare carbon paste electrode. The application of a thin Nafion film to the electrode surface permitted accumulation o f clenbuterol onto the electrode surface {{while at the same time}} selectively excluding anionic interferences present in the urine sample. Differential pulse voltammetry was used to detect low levels of clenbuterol in urine. Amperometric and voltammetric detection coupled to capillary electrophoresis, applied to the determination of anionic phenolic acids in beer and wine, is outlined in Chapter 4. The passivation of the carbon fibre working electrode by the large concentration of neutral molecules present in the sample was overcome by injecting a large volume of diluted sample into the capillary, reversing the polarity to remove cations and neutral molecules from the capillary, and separating the remaining anions under normal conditions. Hydrodynamic voltammetry obtained amperometrically by the step-wise increase in potential were compared to voltammetric detection in the production of i-E curves for analyte identification. Conclusions drawn from the work carried out in the thesis and suggestions for future research are outlined in Chapter 5...|$|R
40|$|The science o f {{transition}} metal chelation finds applicability in many analytical {{areas where the}} determination of agents which will chelate {{transition metal}} ions, or the determination of transition metal ions themselves, is desired. This thesis details the use of transition metal chelation in solving analytical problems encountered in the adhesives, fertiliser and biomedical laboratoiy. In the adhesives industry, transition metal ions in <b>anaerobic</b> <b>adhesives</b> can initiate the polymerisation process, resulting in premature setting o f products in their packaging. Addition o f a chelating agent such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, however, renders the metal ion inactive with respect to its catalytic properties. A novel method was developed for the simultaneous determination o f the seven metal cations Cu(II), Pb(II), Ni(II), Zn(II), Co(II), Cd(H), and Mn(H), with limits o f detection as low as 30 ppb for certain metal ions. The method {{has been shown to}} give no response in the presence of excess EDTA This was achieved by the development o f a solid-phase extraction procedure, and separation on a dynamically coated Cjg reversed-phase highperformance liquid chromatography column. In the fertiliser industry, chelates are added to commercial fertilisers for the supply of micronutrients to plants. The determination of the iron chelates of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), hydroxy- 2 - ethylenediaminetriacetic acid (HEEDTA), ethylenediaminedi(o-hydroxy-phenylacetic) acid (EDDHA), and ethylenediaminedi(o-hydroxy-p-methylphenyl) acetic acid (EDDHMA), and the Cu, Zn and Mn chelates of EDTA was investigated. The ionpairing reagent tetrabutylammonium hydroxide, gave a separation of all iron chelates on a Chromspher C jg column using a solvent switching system. Cu-, Zn-, and MnEDTA were separated using the ion-pairing reagent tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide. For the iron chelates both limit of determination and linear range studies, showed that the method is capable of analysing the concentration range found in commercial fertilisers. The capabilities of gel permeation chromatography for the separation and purification of the above chelates, was also investigated. Of the two gels Bio-Gel P 2 and Fractogel HW- 40 (S), Fractogel HW 40 (S) gave the best separation o f FeEDDHA, FeEDDHMA, FeDTPA and FeHEEDTA. CuEDTA, ZnEDTA and MnEDTA were found to co-elute with FeDTPA. Capillary electrophoresis (CE) has become very important in the analysis o f peptides, as it is a highly powerful mechanism of separation, and can analyse nanoliter sample quantities. However, detection methods employing UV, spectrofluorimetry, radiolabelling and mass spectrometry have limited sensitivity. A copper-coated capillary was developed for the determination of peptides by CE with electrochemical detection. A simple washing procedure produces a copper-coated column which is stable for 12 hours. Under alkaline conditions, peptides complex with Cu(II) from the walls of the column to form Cu(II) -peptide complexes which are subsequently oxidised at a carbon fibre electrode to form copper(III) -peptides. The system was shown to be applicable for the analysis of small peptides (five amino acids),and protected peptides, for which typical detection limits were in the lx lO 2 ̆ 7 range...|$|R
