5|$|The fisher (Pekania pennanti) {{is a small}} {{carnivorous}} mammal {{native to}} North America. It {{is a member of}} the mustelid family (commonly referred to as the weasel family) and is in the monospecific genus Pekania. The fisher is closely related to but larger than the <b>American</b> <b>marten</b> (Martes americana). The fisher is a forest-dwelling creature whose range covers much of the boreal forest in Canada to the northern United States. Names derived from aboriginal languages include pekan, pequam, wejack, and woolang. It is also called a fisher cat, although it is not a feline.|$|E
5|$|Other animals became locally extinct through overhunting. The last elk in Pennsylvania {{was killed}} in Elk County in 1867. The Pennsylvania Game Commission brought 177 animals from the Rocky Mountains to the state from 1913 to 1926; today the elk herd of over 600 animals can often be seen in Quehanna Wild Area. Between 1906 and 1925, Pennsylvania became so {{concerned}} about declining numbers of white-tailed deer that it imported nearly 1,200animals from Michigan to re-establish the species, and made it the official state animal in 1959. In the early 21st century, over-grazing by deer threatens plant diversity. By the early 20th century, the fisher, a small mammal similar to the European polecat or <b>American</b> <b>marten,</b> was hunted to extinction in Pennsylvania. Between 1994 and 1998, 190animals were released in five sites {{in the northern part}} of the state, including 23animals along Quehanna's Wykoff Run in 1995. Breeding populations of fisher appear to have been reestablished.|$|E

25|$|Mammal species differ {{between the}} various {{ecoregions}} of Saskatchewan. Members of six orders of placental mammals which inhabit Saskatchewan. They are the bats, carnivores (including the pinnipeds), artiodactyls, cetaceans, insectivores, and rodents (including the lagomorphs). There are fewer varieties of species as elevation increases which corresponds to the Taiga and Boreal Shield and Cypress Hills Uplands econzones. Mammals which endure the harsh environment in the far north Taiga shield, Boreal Shield and Boreal Plain ecozones are American black bear (Ursus americanus), barren-ground caribou (Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus), western moose (Alces alces anderson), hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus), wolverine (Gulo gulo), <b>American</b> <b>marten</b> (Martes americana), timber wolf (Canis lupus), Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus), mink (Neovison vison), snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus), and red-backed vole (Myodes).|$|E
5000|$|Their predators include <b>American</b> <b>martens,</b> bobcats, {{domestic}} cats, northern goshawks, and owls; {{although they}} quickly acclimatise to human presence, humans {{can be a}} threat to them, through robbing of their cone caches to find seeds for tree cultivation and through the destruction of old growth forest. However, the squirrels' numbers appear to be unaffected by commercial thinning of forests.|$|R
50|$|Predators include barn owls, great horned owls, long-eared owls, and short-eared owls. Prairie falcons {{are also}} {{reported}} as predators. Known or suspected mustelid predators of the long-tailed vole include ermines, long-tailed weasels, and <b>American</b> pine <b>martens.</b>|$|R
50|$|Pileated {{woodpeckers}} {{have been}} observed {{to move to another}} site if any eggs have fallen out of the nest—a rare habit in birds. The cavity is unlined except for wood chips. Both parents incubate three to five eggs for 12 to 16 days. The average clutch size is four per nest. The young may take a month to fledge. The oldest known pileated woodpecker was 12 years and 11 months old. Predators at the nest can include <b>American</b> <b>martens,</b> weasels, squirrels, rat snakes, and gray foxes. Free-flying adults have fewer predators, but can be taken in some numbers by Cooper's hawks, northern goshawks, red-tailed hawks, great horned owls, and barred owls.|$|R
25|$|Mammalian {{carnivores}} {{can compete}} {{for some of}} the same prey as golden eagles but can also themselves become prey, the main prey family of carnivores being the canids (dog family). 12 species of canid are known to have been hunted by golden eagles and they collectively make up about 2.8% of the diet from all surveyed golden eagle nests. For the most part, foxes are the preferred prey, usually as juveniles though foxes of any age or condition, including adult male red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) heavier than the eagles themselves, may be hunted. Across much of both species' ranges, red fox co-exist with golden eagles and eagles hunt them in small numbers. Red foxes make up 13.5% of nest remains in Sicily and 5.9% in the Republic of Macedonia. In a nest in Mongolia, Corsac fox (Vulpes corsac) were surprisingly the main prey species, making up 38% of sampled remains. Kit fox (Vulpes macrotis), swift fox (Vulpes velox), gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) and island fox (Urocyon littoralis) are readily predated in North America. The other family of carnivores that turns up with some regularity in the golden eagle's diet are the mustelids, at about 2.3% of the diet. Everything in this diverse family from least weasels (Mustela nivalis), the smallest mammalian carnivore, to wolverines (Gulo gulo), the largest terrestrial mustelid, have turned up as prey in golden eagle nests. The members of this family which are most regularly hunted are probably the martens, such as the <b>American</b> <b>marten</b> (Martes americanus), pine marten (Martes martes) and beech marten. The young of larger species are also occasionally hunted in Scotland and Ireland, including Eurasian otters (Lutra lutra) and Eurasian badgers (Meles meles). Similarly, amongst wolverines, “young and inexperienced” specimens are usually targeted as prey by golden eagles. In North America, full-grown large mustelids, including American badgers (Taxidea taxus) and fishers (Martes pennanti), have also turned up as prey. The largest percentage of mustelids was 13.2% in a nest in central Alaska. Mustelids, mainly martens, turned up in large numbers in the French Alps where they made up 10.1% of nest remains.|$|E

Within martens, two morphological groups (americana and caurina) have been recognized, though the level of distinction between them has been debated. We examined mitochondrial cytochrome b gene haplotypes from 680 martens to explore the colonization history of the Pacific Northwest and found two clades that correspond to the morphological groups. The widespread americana clade extends from interior Alaska south to Montana and eastward to Newfoundland and New England (i. e. northwestern, north-central and northeastern North America). The caurina clade occurs in western North America, minimally extending from Admiralty Island (southeastern Alaska) south to Oregon and Wyoming. Our data indicated two colonization events for the Pacific Northwest (one by members of each clade) and were consistent with the persistence of populations throughout past glacial periods in eastern and western refugia.

In the western United States, <b>American</b> <b>marten</b> distribution is limited to mountain ranges that provide preferred habitat. Over time, the distribution of <b>American</b> <b>marten</b> has contracted and expanded regionally, with local extirpations and successful recolonizations occurring in the Great Lakes region and {{some parts of the}} Northeast.

50|$|<b>American</b> <b>marten</b> may be {{important}} seed dispersers; seeds generally pass through the animal intact, and seeds are likely germinable. One study from Chichagof Island, southeast Alaska, found that Alaska blueberry (Vaccinium alaskensis) and ovalleaf huckleberry (V. ovalifolium) seeds had higher germination rates after passing through the gut of <b>American</b> <b>marten</b> compared to seeds that dropped from the parent plant. Analyses of <b>American</b> <b>marten</b> movement and seed passage rates suggested that <b>American</b> <b>marten</b> could disperse seeds long distances: 54% of the distances analyzed were >0.3 mile (0.5 km).|$|E
50|$|Adaptations to {{deep snow}} are {{particularly}} important {{in areas where the}} <b>American</b> <b>marten</b> is sympatric with the fisher, which may compete with and/or prey on <b>American</b> <b>marten.</b> In California, <b>American</b> <b>marten</b> were closely associated with areas of deep snow (>9 inches (23 cm)/winter month), while fishers were more associated with shallow snow (<5 inches (13 cm)/winter month).

50|$|Males measure 38 - 56 cm in body length, with a tail {{measuring}} 9 - 12 cm, {{and weighing}} 880 - 1800 g. Females {{have a body}} length of 35 - 51 cm, with a tail length of 7.2 - 11.5 cm. The winter pelage is longer and more luxurious than the summer coat. Different subspecies display geographic variation in fur colour: fur color ranges from light to dark brown, with individual fur color being lighter ventrally and darker {{on the back and}} legs. Japanese sables (known locally as クロテン or kuroten) in particular are marked with black on their legs and feet. Individuals also display a light patch of fur on their throat which may be gray, white, or a pale yellow. The fur is softer and silkier than that of <b>American</b> <b>martens.</b> Sables greatly resemble pine martens in size and appearance, but have more elongated heads, longer ears and proportionately shorter tails.

40|$|Despite their {{temperate}} to subarctic geographic range, <b>American</b> <b>martens</b> (Martes americana) {{possess a}} thermally inefficient morphology. The lack of morphological adaptations for reducing thermal costs suggests that marten may use behavioral strategies to optimize thermal budgets. During the winters of 1989 - 1990 and 1990 - 1991, we radio-collared and monitored the diel activity of 7 martens. A log-linear model {{suggested that the}} presence or absence of light was the only factor associated with marten activity patterns (p 3 ̆c 0. 001). A regression of the percentage of active fixes on ambient temperature failed to detect an association (b = - 4. 45, p = 0. 084, n = 12). Contents of marten seats suggested that their activity was consistent with the prey-vulnerability hypothesis. While martens must balance multiple life requisites, their activity patterns suggest that they accept increased thermal costs in order to increase foraging efficiency. However, the nocturnal activity of martens during winter was also consistent with the hypothesis that they may be able to limit their own exposure to predation risk. The nocturnal habits of Newfoundland martens in the winter were consistent with the hypothesis of avoidance of predation risk...|$|R

In order to clarify the relationship between <b>American</b> <b>martens</b> Martes americana (Turton, 1806), and roads in boreal forests, we tested the effect of distance from road on marten habitat use by comparing the frequency of occurrence, and the number of, marten snow tracks in 27 pairs of 300 and 400 m transect segments perpendicular to access roads, and corresponding segments 800 or 1000 m away from the road, for a total o f four spatial analyses. The number o f black spruce Picea mariana, stems was generally lower near roads (- 94. 0 0. 05). In all analyses, marten tracks were significantly fewer near roads (Wilcoxon test:- 74. 0 < Ts <- 62. 0, p < 0. 01) than away from roads. In segments with tracks, track density was significantly lower near roads than away from roads in three o f four spatial analyses (- 3. 3 < Ts <- 2. 9, p < 0. 01).

50|$|Where {{deep snow}} accumulates, <b>American</b> <b>marten</b> prefer cover types that prevent snow from packing hard and have {{structures}} near {{the ground that}} provide access to subnivean sites. While <b>American</b> <b>marten</b> select habitats with deep snow, they may concentrate activity in patches with relatively shallow snow. In north-central Idaho, <b>American</b> <b>marten</b> activity was highest in areas where snow depths were <12 inches (30 cm).

50|$|<b>American</b> <b>marten</b> are {{vulnerable}} to predation from raptors and other carnivores. The threat of predation {{may be an important}} factor shaping <b>American</b> <b>marten</b> habitat preferences, a hypothesis inferred from their avoidance of open areas and from behavioral observations of the European pine marten (Martes martes). Specific predators vary by geographic region. In Newfoundland, red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) were the most frequent predator, though coyote (Canis latrans) and other <b>American</b> <b>marten</b> were also responsible for some deaths. In deciduous forests in northeastern British Columbia, most predation was attributed to raptors. Of 18 <b>American</b> <b>marten</b> killed by predators in northeastern Oregon, 8 were killed by bobcats (Lynx rufus), 4 by raptors, 4 by other <b>American</b> <b>marten,</b> and 2 by coyotes. Throughout the distribution of <b>American</b> <b>marten,</b> other predators include the great horned owl (Bubo virginianus), bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), Canada lynx (L. canadensis), mountain lion (Puma concolor), fisher (M. pennanti), wolverine (Gulo gulo), grizzly bear (Ursus arctos horribilis), American black bear (U. americanus), and grey wolf (C. lupus).

Sixty-eight martens were trapped in the Waswanipi Cree Model Forest (Québec, Canada) from October to November 2005 and anesthetized with isoflurane in 100 % oxygen (1 l/min) using a face mask. Induction setting of isoflurane was 3 % for all animals. Mean (±SD) length of induction was 1. 8 ± 1. 2 min. Maintenance isoflurane settings ranged from 1 % to 4 %. Procedures lasted an average of 16. 4 ± 7. 1 min and were uneventful. Length of recovery, defined as the interval {{between the end of}} the procedure and animal release, was short (6. 3 ± 2. 8 min), and well below reported lengths of recovery using injectable anesthetics (≥ 70 min). As compared to open drop administration of isoflurane described in previous studies, the use of an anesthesia machine prevents the risk of potential fatal anesthetic overdose. We conclude that among anesthesia techniques currently available, isoflurane with oxygen as a gas carrier is a safe and useful field anesthetic in martens, when issues with equipment portability can be overcome...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development and}} application of a spatially explicit, individual based model of animal dispersal (J-walk) to determine the relative effects of landscape heterogeneity, prey availability, predation risk, and the energy requirements and behavior of dispersing organisms on dispersal success. Significant unknowns exist for the simulation of complex movement behavior within heterogeneous landscapes. Therefore, initial simulations with J-walk examined the relative effect of landscape patterns and species-specific characteristics on dispersal success. Differences in landscape pattern were simulated by random generation of fractal maps with average available energy (i. e. prey) and predation risk expressed {{as a function of}} habitat type. Variation in species-specific patterns were then simulated by a series of scenarios that varied the response of dispersing individuals to habitat heterogeneity, including: habitat selection to maximize energy intake, habitat selection to minimize predation risk, or habitat selection contingent on energy reserves. Results showed that significant shifts in dispersal could be related to (1) the unique spatial arrangement of habitat within each map, (2) changes in relative prey abundance, and (3) variation in the relationship between energy availability and predation risk. Hypothetical management scenarios were used to identify critical data needed to assure the persistence of reintroduced populations of <b>American</b> <b>martens</b> (Martes americana) ...|$|R

Four male and 8 female captive pine martens Martes americana (Turton, 1806) were observed for signs of mating. Behavioural changes associated with the breeding season began in mid-June. Subjective observation indicated that the frequency of abdominal scent marking and body contact {{between males and females}} increased from June through July and decreased during August. Aggression between females in creased markedly during the breeding season. The animals emitted diverse vocaliza tions, including a throaty chuckle that was associated with breeding and that was indistinguishable by observers from a call emitted when females appeared to be consoling young kits. Copulation was observed on 4 occasions during July in one pair of martens, and was typical of that described for Martes species in general. Two individual copulatory acts were timed and lasted 5 and 14. 5 min, respectively.
