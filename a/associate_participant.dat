Under the support of NSC and COA, the database and websites of TaiBIF, TaiBNET (TaiCOL), TaiBOL, and TaiEOL have been established separately and collaborate with the GBIF, COL, BOL, and EOL respectively. A cross-agency committee was thus established in Academia Sinica in 2008 to formulate policies on data collection and integration as well as the mechanism to make data available to the public.

40|$|The {{integration}} of Taiwan’s biodiversity databases started in 2001, {{the same year}} that both the Digital Archives Program (later renamed Taiwan e-Learning and Digital Archives Program; TELDAP) and Biodiversity Action Plan were launched and Taiwan joined the Global Biodiversity Information Facility(GBIF) as an <b>Associate</b> <b>Participant.</b> In 2002, Academia Sinica began the creation of the “Catalog of Life in Taiwan” database (TaiBNET). Taiwan’s node of GBIF, TaiBIF, established in 2004, integrates Taiwan’s biodiversitydata and shares it with the global community. Both TaiBNET and TaiBIF have broken through the barrier of Intellectual Property Rights and can collect and integrate data accumulated by TELDAP’s various sub-projects. However, raw data, especially those on ecological distribution, generated by different agencies or non-TELDAP projects are still dispersed due to parochialism. A cross-agency committee was thus established in Academia Sinica in 2008 to formulate policies on data collection and integration, as well as mechanismsto increase public availability of data. Any commissioned project will hereafter include these policy requirements in the contract.

40|$|Philosopher Marilyn Frye (1983) categorizes anger, a stereotypically male emotion, {{as a tool}} {{to declare}} one's own agency. This creates a problem when looking at the {{perceived}} justification, or uptake, of anger as it pertains to women. Frye hypothesizes that women's anger is generally not well received and therefore, women are marginalized and denied agency. Using a mixed model factorial design, participants' perceptions of anger were examined in three scenarios that varied by whether they were male-stereotypic, female-stereotypic, or not gender <b>associated.</b> <b>Participants</b> reported whether they believed the target's angry response was justified or was an overreaction. They also rated how likeable they found the target to be. Results showed {{a significant main effect for}} scenario on all three dependent measures, but ratings did not differ by target gender and the interaction between target gender and scenario was not significant. More research is needed to determine whether Frye's claims can be empirically supported...|$|R
40|$|Attempting to {{retrieve}} a target from memory via a retrieval cue can cause competition from the cue's associates, which might block the target. A 1994 study by Anderson, Bjork, and Bjork demonstrated retrieval-induced forgetting for competing associates and suggested that inhibitory control resolving competition causes the forgetting. A 2011 study by Storm, Angello, and Bjork found forgetting for incorrect associates following creative problem solving. This thesis investigated whether such forgetting is also the result of inhibitory control. Competition was manipulated by instructing participants to remember or forget incorrect associates before working on a Remote Associates Test problem. If problem-solving-induced forgetting is caused by inhibition, then to-be-remembered associates should suffer more forgetting than to-be-forgotten associates. Overall, forgetting occurred for incorrect <b>associates</b> <b>participants</b> were instructed to remember and forget. However, the first quartile of trials showed forgetting only for to-be-remembered associates following longer problem solving durations, suggesting a possible role of inhibitory control as an active means to overcome fixation in creative problem solving...|$|R

By contrast, providing some studied words as cues during recall reduced both recall of the remaining studied words and intrusions of the critical word. The results suggest that forgetting can increase or decrease false memories, depending on whether such forgetting reflects impaired access to an entire episode or retrieval competition among elements of an episode. During most of the history of memory research there has been a decided preference for studying accuracy in memory performance, but in recent years there has been growing interest in memory errors. Two types of memory errors that have drawn considerable attention—forgetting and false memory—are functional opposites...|$|R

40|$|International audienceSince {{the work}} of Casasanto (2009), it is now well {{established}} that valence and laterality are <b>associated.</b> <b>Participants</b> tend to prefer objects presented on their dominant side over items presented on their non-dominant side, and to place good items on their dominant side and bad items on the other side. Several studies highlight that those associations of valence and laterality are {{accounted for by the}} greater motor fluency of the dominant hand and various studies noted that these associations could be reversed depending on the way people interact with their environment. Consistently with the Theory of Event Coding, the aim of this work is to show that the consequences of motor actions could also reverse the associations between valence and laterality. Thus, if participants had to place two animals (one good, one bad) on two supports, one stable (no risk of falling), one unstable (risk of falling), we hypothesized that the good item would be placed on the stable support, regardless of the side where it would be put (i. e., on the dominant or non-dominant side). We expected the opposite for the bad item. The results of two experiments are consistent with this prediction and support the claim that the consequences of motor action bias the hedonic connotation of our dominant side...|$|R

Even though many children are in these types of child care arrangements, little is known about the relationships between parents and child care providers or the role of protective factors in these settings. The goal of this qualitative study was to explore strengths and challenges of parent-provider relationships and learn how protective factors might be strengthened through these relationships in the population of FFN Project REACH participants. Specifically, 5 protective factors from the Strengthening Families Protective Factors Framework from the Center for the Study of Social Policy (2012 b) were explored. The 5 protective factors that were explored include social connections, concrete support in times of need, parental resilience, knowledge of parenting and child development, and the social and emotional competence of children (Center for the Study of Social Policy, 2012 b).
