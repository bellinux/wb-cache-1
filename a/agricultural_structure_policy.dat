40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{expansion of}} large-scale Paddy field management entity and change of agricultural structure in Japan. Paddy agriculture has changed. Mid-size agricultural management entities have decreased and large-scale management entities have increased. This factor {{is due to}} downturn in rice price and <b>agricultural</b> <b>structure</b> <b>policy.</b> Those large-scale management entities have accumulated paddy fields {{more than half of}} agricultural commune. Sustainability and vison of such a farm management entities are vital for maintenance and development of regional agriculture. 　This paper takes up development of large-scale management. N Corporation, which manages 395 ha of farmland in Toyota, Aichi Prefecture, has been analyzed as a case study. The findings of the analysis are as follows : The speed of increasing the workforce to accompany the enlargement of the managed area depends on, which is the reason why N Corporation became organization change from cooperative to corporation. The conversion in the latter case has changed the status of workers, who used to be members of the cooperative, to employees and the management of workers from a horizontal system to a more vertical and sectional structure. 　From the above, this paper can draw the following conclusion : Large-scale management entities was changed by field scale expansion. They are face a decrease in yield and decrease in earnings of the paddy fields agriculture. As a result, they need to organization change. And <b>agricultural</b> <b>structure</b> <b>policy</b> is not only required to accumulate fields but also to overall management support...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a {{practical}} methodology for evaluating the sustainability of farms by means of composite indicators, and to apply it to two agricultural systems, the rain-fed agriculture of the Castilla y León countryside and the irrigated systems of the valley of the River Duero. We hope thus to operationalise the concept of sustainability as an element to support the "governance" of this sector. Our methodology is based on calculating 16 sustainability indicators that cover the three components of the concept (economic, social and environmental), and their subsequent aggregation into nine different types of sustainability indices. Our results enable us first to demonstrate the advantages and disadvantages of the various methods used to construct composite sustainability indicators, demonstrating the usefulness of analysing several of these indicators in conjunction, in order to obtain more robust results. They also enable us to visualise farm heterogeneity within a single agricultural system with respect to sustainability as well as to analyse the structural and decision-oriented variables that influence it. Such information could help to improve current agricultural policies (such as income policy, <b>agricultural</b> <b>structure</b> <b>policy</b> and rural development policy), with the aim of improving the sustainability of the sector.

30|$|Dynamics of main crops was {{strongly}} influenced by the socio-economic and political conditions of the post-communist period. This influence depended on the farming practices (the absence of functional irrigation systems, fewer natural and chemical fertilisers, poor mechanisation), inadequate farm <b>structure,</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>policies,</b> etc., and besides, the intensification of climate change-induced extreme phenomena (dryness and drought, heavy rainfall-floods, hail-storms, blizzards, etc.) annually affecting ever larger cultivated terrains (Sandu et al., 2010; MADR 2014). During that period, output variations in the main rain-fed crops (wheat, maize and sun-flower) were thus climate-related.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} focused on the "silent" {{agricultural}} revolution that occurred in rural West German society during the postwar period. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to provide a new framework by reviewing these recent studies in three research fields: (1) German rural social history, (2) the history of German agricultural policy, and (3) the ecological aspects of the land consolidation program ("Flurbereinigung"). First, social historical studies revealed that the mass influx of refugees from the former eastern territories of Germany heavily influenced rural society and caused a radical change in the local political culture and the "habitus" of rural residents. However, the pathways to rural modernization demonstrated regional diversity. Second, historical studies on the German agricultural policy revealed the following: (1) how people under occupation experienced the postwar food crisis; (2) the transition from a national agricultural policy to the European common agricultural policy in the 1950 s; and (3) how farmers revolted against the <b>agricultural</b> <b>structure</b> <b>policy</b> in the European Economic Community (EEC), known as the "Mansholt-Plan" (1968 – 1972). Third, we examined the postwar land consolidation program, with a focus on the discourse on the ecological elements of the rural landscape. We found conflicts between the "euphoria" of technological innovation and the social desire of making a new home village ("Heimat") ...|$|E
40|$|The {{sustainability}} discourse clearly gives {{priority to}} the so-called "three-pillar model", according to which sustainable development should equally try to reach ecological, economic, and social goals. An increasing variety of methods is being proposed {{to address the question}} of the measurement of sustainable development. The concept of sustainable development can be interpreted in many different ways, but at its core is an approach to development that looks to balance different, and often competing, needs against an awareness of the environmental, social and economic limitations we face as asociety. Submitting theses deal with measuring sustainable agriculture and introduces a practical methodology for evaluating the sustainability of agriculture system by means of composite indicators. This methodology was based on calculating seven sustainability indicators that cover the three components of the sustainability concept (economic, social and environmental). The methodological proposal implemented in theses allowed an integrated vision of agricultural sustainability and careful selection of sustainability indicators, carried out on the basis of reliability criteria and applicability. The evaluation of agricultural sustainability/production system sustainability using the methods suggested is a potentially useful tool for public decision-makers who are tasked with designing and implementing agricultural policy. The results demonstrated the usefulness of analyzing several sustainability indicators in conjunction, in order to obtain more robust results. Such information can help to improve current agricultural policies, such as income policy, <b>agricultural</b> <b>structure</b> <b>policy</b> and rural development policy, with the aim of improving the sustainability of the agricultural sector...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of competitive and efficient <b>agricultural</b> <b>structures</b> {{has been one}} of the central goals of agricultural policy making in addition to ensuring a fair standard of living for farmers. To achieve these goals, the agricultural sector in most industrialised nations has long been the subject of government interven­tions. However, many agricultural policies have worked counteractively to these goals by creating distortions in the use of resources. Against this background, the emergence of new and innovative modelling methods such as agent- based models, in addition to ever-in­creasing computing capacities has offered new possibilities to model adjustment reactions and to quantify the impact of agri­cultural policies. This thesis takes up these new methodologies and applies them to the modelling and evaluation of agricultural policy impacts on regional struc­tural change. At the centre of the thesis is the {{development of}} the spatial and dynamic simula­tion model of regional <b>agricultural</b> <b>structures</b> AgriPoliS (<b>Agricultural</b> <b>Policy</b> Simulator). The core of AgriPoliS is the understanding of a regional <b>agricultural</b> <b>structure</b> as an agent-based system, i. e., a system of interacting heterogeneous agents. The thesis contributes to a deeper un­derstanding of struc­tural change dynamics and factors causing structural change. It is studied whether and to what extent policy changes can facilitate structural adjustment towards a more efficient and competitive <b>agricultural</b> <b>structure.</b> agent-based modelling, structural change, agricultural policy, simulation, efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} decades, {{the number of}} farms has {{decreased}} while average farm size has increased in industrialised countries. We investigate whether these two concomitant trends have resulted in higher farmland concentration or not {{in the case of}} France. Deriving Gini coefficients as a measure of concentration from the estimation of parametric Lorenz curves, we show that this is not systematically the case at the sub-national scale of “départements”. When studying the role of possible explanatory variables for farmland concentration, we find that milk quotas, CAP 2 nd pillar subsidies and so-called structural measures (settlements and early retirement grants) have a significant impact. However, the availability and the price of agricultural land appear to be the most significant factors.

40|$|During {{the last}} decades, {{development}} of Danish agriculture was characterised by concentration of land on fewer and larger farms and consequently increasing farm sizes. On basis of three case studies supplemented by national data we explore relationships between farm size change and farmland nature {{in terms of}} field sizes and hedgerow densities. Data point to {{a significant relationship between}} farm enlargement and increases in mean field sizes. Furthermore, mean field size is negatively related to densities of hedgerows. For the coming decades, scenarios for Danish agriculture point to a continued increase in farm sizes. We argue for an increased focus on the effects of a continued scale enlargement on farmland nature in terms of changes in field size structure. In order to reduce harmful influences of scale enlargement, we suggest that in relation to changes in field <b>structure,</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>policies</b> should focus on restrictions on removal of old hedgerows and on subsidies for planting of ne...|$|R

Hence, the relevant countermeasures applied to increase farmers’ income are put forward in terms of optimizing the internal structure of agriculture, adjusting the internal structure of crop farming, adjusting the internal structure of animal husbandry and strengthening the support of farmers. <b>Agricultural</b> <b>structure,</b> Farmers’ net income, Contribution rate, China, Agribusiness,...|$|R
