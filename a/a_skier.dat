5|$|The son of {{a textile}} {{machinery}} manufacturer, Mertz studied patent law at the University of Bern, and science at the University of Lausanne, specialising in glacier and mountain formations. While a student, Mertz became active as <b>a</b> <b>skier,</b> competing in national competitions, and as a mountaineer, climbing many of the highest peaks in the Alps. In early 1911, Mertz was hired by geologist and explorer Douglas Mawson for his Australasian Antarctic Expedition. He was initially employed as a ski instructor, but in Antarctica Mertz instead joined Belgrave Edward Sutton Ninnis {{in the care of}} the expedition's Greenland Huskies.|$|E
5|$|As a young adventurer, Fossett {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{participants}} in the Worldloppet, a series of cross country ski marathons around the world. While he had little experience as <b>a</b> <b>skier,</b> he was in the first group of 'citizen athletes' to participate in the series debut in 1979. And in 1980, he became the eighth skier to complete all 10 of the long distance races, earning a Worldloppet medallion. He has also set cross-country skiing records in Colorado, setting an Aspen to Vail record of 59h, 53min, 30s in February 1998, and an Aspen to Eagle record of 12 hr, 29 min in February 2001.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{won four}} medals in 1992—one gold, one silver and two bronze. Michael Milton, an amputee alpine skier, won {{gold in the}} slalom and silver in the super-G. In {{paraplegic}} sit-skiing, David Munk won bronze in the super-G, and Michael Norton won bronze in the downhill. In 1994, Australia won three gold, two silver and four bronze medals. Milton won gold in the giant slalom, silver in the slalom and bronze in the downhill and super-G, and Norton won gold in the slalom and super-G. James Patterson, <b>a</b> <b>skier</b> with cerebral palsy, won silver in the downhill and bronze in the giant slalom. Munk won another bronze, {{this time in the}} giant slalom. In 1998, Australia won two medals, both through Paterson: gold in the downhill and bronze in the slalom.|$|E

5|$|Cross-country skiing has {{two basic}} {{propulsion}} techniques, which apply to different surfaces: classic (undisturbed snow and tracked snow) and skate skiing (firm, smooth snow surfaces). The classic technique {{relies on a}} wax or texture on the ski bottom under the foot for traction on the snow to allow the skier to slide the other ski forward in virgin or tracked snow. With the skate skiing technique <b>a</b> <b>skier</b> slides on alternating skis on a firm snow surface at an angle {{from each other in}} a manner similar to ice skating. Both techniques employ poles with baskets that allow the arms to participate in the propulsion. Specialized equipment is adapted to each technique and each type of terrain. A variety of turns are used, when descending.|$|E
5|$|Many humans enjoy {{venturing into}} the sea: {{children}} paddle and splash in the shallows, while others swim or relax on the beach. This {{was not always}} the case, with sea bathing becoming the vogue in Europe in the 18th century after Dr. William Buchan advocated the practice for health reasons. Surfing is a sport in which a wave is ridden by a surfer, {{with or without a}} surfboard. Other water sports include kite surfing, where a power kite propels a manned board across the water; windsurfing, where the power is provided by a fixed, maneuverable sail; and water skiing, where a powerboat is used to pull <b>a</b> <b>skier.</b>|$|E
25|$|Nannes was {{previously}} <b>a</b> <b>skier.</b> In 1995, {{he made his}} debut as a mogul skier, {{and went on to}} compete at FIS Freestyle Skiing World Cup events until 1999. He then turned to playing cricket for club side Hawthorn-Waverley and later Fitzroy Doncaster.|$|E
5000|$|A {{lift ticket}} or lift pass is an {{identifier}} usually attached to <b>a</b> <b>skier's</b> outerwear that indicates they have paid and can {{ride on the}} ski lift up a mountain to ski.|$|R

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>skier's</b> {{score is}} based upon the number of {{successful}} buoys cleared, the speed of the boat, and the length of the rope. In <b>a</b> tournament, <b>skiers</b> choose the starting boat speed and rope length (with a maximum length of 22.86 m). Professional water skiers will typically start at the max speed of 58 km/h with a rope that has already been shortened to 13 m. The skier with the most buoys wins the competition.|$|R
25|$|For {{standing}} competitors, outrigger skis {{can be used}} in some classifications. These are {{ski poles}} with small skis on the end. They assist <b>a</b> <b>skier</b> balancing as they ski down the slopes, and in moving uphill for short distances, enabling skiers to do things like a climb a slope to get on a chair lift.|$|E
25|$|For alpine events, <b>a</b> <b>skier</b> {{is allowed}} one push, without running, from the {{starting}} position {{at the start of}} the race. If the competitor skis off the course during a para-Nordic race, a race official may assist him or her back onto the course. Skiers cannot use their legs to break or steer during the race.|$|E
25|$|In para-alpine and para-Nordic skiing, {{guides for}} B2 and B3 skiers often {{position}} themselves differently as the skiers have some vision, {{which means the}} things a guide assists with will be different from what is required of <b>a</b> <b>skier</b> who has almost no sight. The guide may ski {{in front of the}} skier and use visual cues to inform the skier of what is ahead of them on the course.|$|E
5000|$|Alpine skiing {{made its}} first {{appearance}} in the winter Olympics as the combined, which added <b>a</b> <b>skier's</b> results in both the downhill and slalom. German athletes Franz Pfnür won men's alpine and Christl Cranz won women's alpine events.|$|R

25|$|At times, skiers in {{this class}} have injured {{themselves}} while skiing. Such injuries have occurred for some {{in this class}} of the German national para-Alpine skiing team between 1994 and 2006. One incident occurred in 1997 and was a femur-fracture caused {{as a result of}} a fall while skiing. Another incident occurred at the 1998 Winter Paralympics when <b>a</b> <b>skier</b> injured themselves, resulting in a partial ACL rupture.|$|E
25|$|Brian McKeever of Canada {{became the}} first athlete to be named in a Winter Paralympics and Winter Olympics team in the same year, {{although}} he did not compete in the Olympic Games. (At the 2010 Winter Olympics, he was scheduled to compete in the men's 50km cross-country race, but the coach replaced him with <b>a</b> <b>skier</b> who did well at an earlier event.) At the Paralympics, he competed in Cross-country skiing and Biathlon.|$|E
25|$|Skiers missing an arm use a {{technique}} that corrects lateral balance issues resulting from the missing arm. <b>A</b> <b>skier</b> with an above the knee amputation may have a better ability to complete turns on the opposite of their amputation. Skiers with hemiplegia have to be trained to use both sides of their body equally. If they do not, {{they are likely to}} fall over when their skis cross in front of them.|$|E

25|$|For alpine events, <b>a</b> <b>skier</b> is {{required}} to have their ski poles or equivalent equipment planted in the snow {{in front of the}} starting position {{before the start of the}} race. During competition, the para-Alpine skier cannot use a limb not in a ski for competitive advantage to gain speed or keep balance by putting it in the snow. If they do so, they rules state they will be disqualified from the event.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} 2016, Miller {{wanted to}} make another {{comeback}} to the tour and compete with Bomber skis. HEAD, however, blocked the attempt, stating that Miller agreed not to compete with other ski brands for 2 years from the moment their agreement had been terminated. While Miller thought it {{was not allowed to}} prevent <b>a</b> <b>skier</b> from competing to earn living, HEAD refused to accept that and showed disappointment in Miller for not honoring his word and trying to race with different skis.|$|E
25|$|The {{game was}} {{won in the}} first few overs. The pitch, as Surrey and Hampshire showed in a game played three days later, had a par score well in excess of 300. However, Glenn McGrath's first four overs were maidens, and his fifth over only failed to be because Jason Gillespie dropped <b>a</b> <b>skier,</b> much to the {{amusement}} of the crowd. With Brett Lee bowling well and picking up the early wicket of Marcus Trescothick for a duck, England were well behind on the run rate from the start.|$|E

25|$|Skiers use {{outriggers}} {{for balance}} and as leverage when they fall to right themselves. Outriggers {{are also used}} for turning, with the skier using the outrigger and their upper body by leaning into the direction they want to turn. In para-Nordic skiing, outriggers or ski poles are used top propel the skier forward. If <b>a</b> <b>skier</b> falls, they may require assistance in righting themselves {{to get back to}} the fall line. Doing this on their own, the skier needs to position their mono-ski facing uphill relative to the fall line.|$|E
25|$|LW6/8 skiers use two {{skis and}} one pole in both para-Alpine and para-Nordic skiing. The {{two types of}} skiing differ in that in para-Nordic <b>a</b> <b>skier</b> cannot use a {{prosthesis}} while use prostheses or orthoses are allowed in para-Alpine. FIS rules for ski boots and binding heights are followed for this class. Socks and other materials are used to pad and protect the stump of the arm {{as the use of}} a prosthesis is not allowed. Sometimes, a mitten or cork is used to protect the stump. If the limb is not properly protected, it may get frostbitten.|$|E
25|$|From this point, the English fielding {{began to}} go {{downhill}} in no uncertain fashion. Sheppard ran round and round <b>a</b> <b>skier</b> from Carmody and did not touch it and, from having the home men 50 for three, the Englishmen allowed them to get on top completely. This is the worst fielding I had seen from an M.C.C team. Bailey emulated Sheppard by running round and round a catch, and not touching it, and Brown seemed to despair of victory...Brown left Perth stating, in a most determined manner, that his fieldsmen would know that they had had fielding practice before very long.|$|E
