40|$|An {{industrial}} design concept {{can be adapted}} to manufacture and assembly by striving for visual design properties that are economical and time-efficient <b>to</b> produce <b>according</b> <b>to</b> specifications. <b>One</b> <b>aspect</b> of this is to assess whether the concept will be visually sensitive to distortions in structure, form, colour, gloss and texture. Visual appearance problems are often unrelated to the actual quality or functionality of a product. In the eyes of the customer, they may however serve as intrinsic quality cues, perceptions of quality attributes acquired by observing the product before purchase. Through interviews conducted at an automobile company and a mobile telecom company, factors considered important for the visual quality appearance of their products were identified. These factors are divided into groups, and examples are given. The result is an overview of visual quality appearance aspects, which demonstrates that design for perceived quality can be a trade-off between quality cues as deliberately placed styling features and quality cues stemming from complex assembly variation conditions...|$|R

40|$|Objectives. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the objective vocal quality in 36 prelingually deaf children using cochlear implant (CI) with a mean age of 9 years. An additional purpose was to compare the objective vocal quality of these 36 Cl users with 25 age-matched children with prelingual severe hearing loss using conventional hearing aids (HAs) and 25 normal hearing (NH) children. Study Design. The design for this cross-sectional study was a multigroup posttest-only design. Methods. The objective vocal quality was measured by means of the dysphonia severity index (DSI). Moreover, perceptual voice assessment using the GRBASI scale was performed. Results. CI children have a vocal quality by means of the DSI of + 1. 8, corresponding with a DSI% of 68 %, indicating a borderline vocal quality situated 2 % above the limit of normality. The voice was perceptually characterized by the presence of a very slight grade of hoarseness, roughness, strained phonation, and higher pitch and intensity levels. No significant objective vocal quality differences were measured between the voices of the CI children, HA users, and NH children. Conclusions. <b>According</b> <b>to</b> the results, <b>one</b> <b>aspect</b> of the vocal approach in children with CI and using HAs must be focused on the improvement of the strained vocal characteristic and the use of a lower pitch and intensity level...|$|R

40|$|The {{consequences}} of the extensive changes in age distribution now occurring in developed countries are different <b>according</b> <b>to</b> whether <b>one</b> considers <b>aspects</b> of production or consumption. Too {{little attention has been}} given to the former, especially in relation to the pace of technical change. This paper opens up that subject. Under fixed technology, experience is an asset to the individual and to the economy; under rapid change, experience can be a handicap to both. It is also shown how fewer entrants into the labor force makes for higher starting wages but slower promotion to more responsible work. Of the various consumption and redistribution aspects, social security is the most conspicuous. An earlier paper (Keyfitz, 1981) developed formulas for the implicit reserve of a social security scheme; here we carry these further in relation to social security wealth. The crisis in social security consists in the fact that schemes have been priced lower than sheer arithmetic shows to be their long-term cost. Because the public believed the costs to be lower than it now realizes they are, it bought a larger quantity than it really wanted. Yet it is reluctant to reduce the quantity [...] by raising the retirement age or lowering the replacement ratio [...] because the scheme seems so fragile that any tampering with it could be the opening wedge to total dismantling. We locate social security in the framework of intergenerational transfers, whose problems arise as a direct consequence of birth fluctuations. Lines of argument converge to show that the solidarity of the generations is strengthened by at least partial funding of social security...|$|R

40|$|The present {{application}} {{relates to}} a series of novel peptides and their use in therapy and diagnosis, in particular in relation to atherothrombosis and/or atherosclerosis. Atherothrombosis is characterised by an unpredictable, sudden disruption (rupture or erosion/fissure) of an atherosclerotic plaque, which leads to platelet activation and thrombus formation. Atherothrombosis is the underlying condition that results in events leading to myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke and death. Atherothrombosis is the main cause of death and disability within the population aged 45 or above in industrialized nations (currently 30 % of global deaths and 40 % of deaths in the UK are caused by Cardio Vascular Disease (CVD); this projection is expected to remain within the next 30 years). The development of atherosclerotic plaques starts during childhood and develops over a range of 50 - 60 years before the first symptoms of instability occur. Currently, prevention is based on the measurement of risk factors (family history, diabetes, high circulating cholesterol levels, etc). Patients who are at risk undergo early screening and this has been shown to reduce the incidence of complications. The follow up of patients who have suffered acute complications or you have a history of chronic cardiovascular disease is based on a combined approach that does not always reflect the development of the atherosclerotic lesions and the possible appearance of complications. The complex nature and long term development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases demands the development of novel biomarkers for early disease detection, risk assessment and evaluation of response to therapy. Traditional evaluation of patients attending to hospital accident and emergency services with chest pain or other signs or symptoms suggesting acute coronary syndrome is sometimes problematic, time-consuming {{and most of the time}} expensive. Moreover, current laboratory investigations designed to assess the status and prognosis of these patients rely on serological markers that provide a very narrow window of action to clinicians and health care professionals to act upon. There is, therefore, a need for improved methods of diagnosing and treating atherothrombosis and/or atherosclerosis.

According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for diagnosing atherothrombosis or atherosclerosis in a patient or for identifying a patient at risk of developing atherothrombosis or atherosclerosis, the method comprising: (a) determining an amount of a combination of two or more peptides, polypeptides and/or nucleic acid sequences of the present invention in a sample obtained from a patient; (b) comparing the amount of the determined peptides, polypeptides and/or nucleic acid sequences in the sample from the patient to the amount of the peptides, polypeptides and/or nucleic acid sequences in a normal control; wherein a difference in the amount of the peptides, polypeptides and/or nucleic acid sequences in the sample from the patient compared to the amount of the peptides, polypeptides and/or nucleic acid sequences in the normal control is associated with the presence of atherothrombosis or atherosclerosis or is associated with a risk of developing atherothrombosis or atherosclerosis. According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for monitoring the progression of atherothrombosis or atherosclerosis in a patient, the method comprising: (a) determining an amount of a peptide, polypeptide or nucleic acid sequence of the present invention in a sample obtained from a patient; (b) comparing the amount of the determined peptide, polypeptide or nucleic acid sequence in the sample from the patient to the amount of the peptide, polypeptide or nucleic acid sequence in a normal control; and (c) repeating steps (a) and (b) at two or more time intervals, wherein an increase in the amount of the peptide, polypeptide or nucleic acid sequence from the patient over time is associated with an increase in the progression of atherothrombosis or atherosclerosis and a decrease in the amount of the peptide, polypeptide or nucleic acid sequence from the patient over time is associated with a decrease in the progression of atherothrombosis or atherosclerosis. According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for monitoring the progression of atherothrombosis or atherosclerosis in a patient, the method comprising: (a) determining an amount of a combination of two or more peptides, polypeptides and/or nucleic acid sequences of the present invention in a sample obtained from a patient; (b) comparing the amount of the determined peptides, polypeptides and/or nucleic acid sequences in the sample from the patient to the amount of the peptides, polypeptides and/or nucleic acid sequences in a normal control; and (c) repeating steps (a) and (b) at two or more time intervals, wherein an increase in the amount of the peptides, polypeptides and/or nucleic acid sequences from the patient over time is associated with an increase in the progression of atherothrombosis or atherosclerosis and a decrease in the amount of the peptides, polypeptides and/or nucleic acid sequences from the patient over time is associated with a decrease in the progression of atherothrombosis or atherosclerosis. Accordingly, the methods of the present invention can be used to detect the onset, progression, stabilisation, amelioration and/or remission of atherothrombosis or atherosclerosis. Preferably, the control may be from the same patient from a previous sample, to thus monitor onset or progression. However, it is also preferred that the control may be normalised for a population, particularly a healthy or normal population, where there is no atherothrombosis or atherosclerosis. In other words, the control may consist of the level of a peptide, polypeptide or nucleic acid sequence of the present invention found in a normal control sample from a normal subject.

As discussed above, it is preferred that at least two detection and/or quantification steps are provided, spaced apart temporally. Preferably, the steps are spaced apart by a few days, weeks, years or months, to determine whether the levels of the peptides, polypeptides or nucleic acid sequences have changed, thus indicating whether there has been a change in the progression of atherothrombosis or atherosclerosis, enabling comparisons to be made between a level of the peptides, polypeptides or nucleic acid sequences in samples taken on two or more occasions, as an increase in the level of the peptides, polypeptides or nucleic acid sequences over time is indicative of the onset or progression of atherothrombosis or atherosclerosis, whereas a decrease in the level of the peptides, polypeptides or nucleic acid sequences may indicate amelioration and/or remission of atherothrombosis or atherosclerosis. Preferably, the difference in the level of the peptides, polypeptides or nucleic acid sequences is statistically significant, determined by using a "t-test" providing confidence intervals of preferably at least about 80 %, preferably at least about 85 %, preferably at least about 90 %, preferably at least about 95 %, preferably at least about 99 %, preferably at least about 99. 5 %, preferably at least about 99. 95 %, preferably at least about 99. 99 %.

Thus, the peptides, polypeptides, nucleic acid sequences and methods of the invention are particularly useful for confirming atherothrombosis or atherosclerosis when a patient has tested negative for atherothrombosis or atherosclerosis using conventional methods. It is preferred that the peptides, polypeptides or nucleic acid sequences of the present invention are indicative of the presence of atherothrombosis or atherosclerosis or the risk of developing atherothrombosis or atherosclerosis when present at a level of at least about 1. 5 -fold, preferably at least about 2 -fold, preferably at least about 5 -fold, preferably at least about 10 -fold, preferably at least about 20 -fold, preferably at least about 50 -fold, preferably at least about 100 -fold, preferably at least about 200 -fold, preferably at least about 300 -fold, preferably at least about 400 -fold, preferably at least about 500 -fold, preferably at least about 600 -fold that of a normal control.

Preferably, in the methods of the present invention, detection and/or quantification of the peptides, polypeptides or nucleic acid sequences is by one or more of MALDI-TOF, SELDI, via interaction with a ligand or ligands, 1 -D or 2 -D gel-based analysis systems, Liquid Chromatography, combined liquid chromatography and Mass spectrometry techniques including ICAT(R) or iTRAQ(R), thin-layer chromatography, NMR spectroscopy, sandwich immunoassays, enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), radioimmunoassays (RAI), enzyme immunoassays (EIA), lateral flow/immunochromatographic strip tests, Western Blotting, immunoprecipitation, particle-based immunoassays including using gold, silver, or latex particles, magnetic particles or Q-dots, and immunohistochemistry on tissue sections. Preferably, detection and/or quantification of the peptides, polypeptides or nucleic acid sequences is performed on a microtitre plate, strip format, array or on a chip. Preferably, detection and/or quantification of the peptides, polypeptides or nucleic acid sequences is by an ELISA comprising antibodies specific for the peptides, polypeptides or nucleic acid sequences, preferably linked to a reporter. Preferably, detection and/or quantification of the peptides, polypeptides or nucleic acid sequences is by a biosensor. Preferably, the sample comprises biological fluid or tissue obtained from the patient. Preferably, the biological fluid comprises urine. It is also preferred that the biological fluid is substantially or completely free of whole/intact cells. Preferably the biological fluid is free of platelets and cell debris (such as that produced upon the lysis of cells). Preferably the biological fluid is free of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Such samples can be obtained by any number of means known in the art, such as will be apparent to the skilled person. For instance, a patient can be asked to provide a urine sample during a routine consultation. Cell free or substantially cell free samples can be obtained by subjecting the sample to various techniques known to those of skill in the art which include, but are not limited to, centrifugation and filtration.
