Smith later said that, having supported transgender youth and Glamour decision to honor transgender actress Laverne Cox in 2014, he did not object because Jenner is transgender; he objected to Jenner's [...] "hardest part about being a woman" [...] commentary; this proved to him that Jenner [...] "is not truly <b>a</b> <b>woman.</b> <b>I</b> believe this comment and others he has made trivializes the transgender experience as I have witnessed it." ...|$|E
