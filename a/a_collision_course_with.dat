5|$|In the 16th {{century the}} Grand Duchy of Lithuania became {{increasingly}} interested in extending its territorial rule to Livonia, especially {{to gain control}} of Baltic seaports, such as Riga, and for other economic benefits. Livonia was by the 1550s largely Lutheran, traditionally ruled by the Brothers of the Sword knightly order. This put Poland and Lithuania on <b>a</b> <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> <b>with</b> Moscow and other regional powers, which had also attempted expansion in that area.|$|E
5|$|In captive Egyptian fruit bats, 70% of the {{directed}} calls {{could be}} identified as to which bat made it, and 60% could be categorised into four contexts: squabbling over food, jostling over position in their sleeping cluster, protesting over mating attempts and arguing when perched {{in close proximity to}} each other. The animals made slightly different sounds when communicating with different individuals, especially one of the opposite sex. Male hammerheaded bats produce deep, resonating, monotonous calls to attract females. Bats in flight make vocal signal for traffic control. Individual greater bulldog bats honk when on <b>a</b> <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> <b>with</b> each other.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, the Solar System {{is stable}} in {{that none of}} the planets are likely to collide with each other or be ejected from the system in the next few billion years. Beyond this, within fivebillion years or so Mars's {{eccentricity}} may grow to around 0.2, such that it lies on an Earth-crossing orbit, leading to a potential collision. In the same timescale, Mercury's eccentricity may grow even further, and a close encounter with Venus could theoretically eject it from the Solar System altogether or send it on <b>a</b> <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> <b>with</b> Venus or Earth. This could happen within a billion years, according to numerical simulations in which Mercury's orbit is perturbed.|$|E

5|$|Warning from Space {{influenced}} Toho's Gorath, a 1963 film which {{depicts a}} rogue planet on <b>a</b> <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> <b>with</b> Earth. The planet Paira in Warning from Space {{may have been}} an influence in the later Daiei film Gamera vs. Guiron, which features the planet Terra, another planet on the opposite of Earth's orbit. Critics have also noted plot similarities to the later Toho film Invasion of Astro-Monster, in that a friendly planet warns Japan of the atom bomb and subsequently assists in celestial defense. The Pairans' asteroidean appearance {{is similar to that of}} a later pentagrammic creation, Starro, a villain from DC Comics' Justice League.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of Toho's 1954 film Godzilla, which {{depicted}} a giant dinosaur attacking Tokyo, many Japanese film studios began to produce similar monster films, including Warning from Space. Along with other films such as Shintōhō's Terrifying Attack of the Flying Saucers and the American Forbidden Planet, Warning from Space became part of a fledgling subgenre of films based around science fiction creatures. The film also used the theme of atomic bombs that was present in many films at the time, but showed how the weapons, which devastated the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki a decade earlier, could be put to good use. Still others noted the film used another common theme of cosmic collisions {{in the style of}} earlier films such as the 1931 film End of the World, which depicted a comet on <b>a</b> <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> <b>with</b> the Earth.|$|E
5|$|The sudden {{loss of the}} {{flagship}} and the fleet admiral threw the already scattered Swedish line into confusion and sapped morale. Four ships from Creutz's and Uggla's squadrons immediately fled when they saw that {{the flagship}} was lost. Claes Uggla was next in command after Creutz and became the acting commander of the Swedish fleet. When the line came about, Uggla and his ship Svärdet came on <b>a</b> <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> <b>with</b> the still floating wreckage of Kronan, and were forced to jibe (turn the stern into the wind direction) to avoid it. Svärdets second turn was interpreted by many ships as a signal to turn again; others interpreted it {{as the beginning of}} a general retreat, leading to major disorder. Uggla reduced speed in an attempt to gather his forces, but instead was separated from his squadron.|$|E

5|$|As {{the group}} makes {{their way through}} the damaged ship, they swim through a flooded kitchen. They are chased by two xenomorphs. One is killed, while the other snatches Hillard. As they escape the kitchen, the xenomorph returns and blinds Christie, who sacrifices himself to kill the xenomorph so the others can escape. After Wren betrays the group, Call is {{revealed}} to be an auton, an improved version of a human created by synthetics. Using her ability to interface with the Aurigas systems, Call sets it on <b>a</b> <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> <b>with</b> Earth, hoping to destroy the xenomorphs in the crash. She cuts off Wren's escape route and directs the xenomorphs towards him. Ripley 8 is captured by a xenomorph, while the others head for the Betty. Wren, who is already aboard, shoots Purvis, takes Call hostage and demands that she abort the collision. An injured Purvis attacks Wren and forces Wren's head to his chest just as the xenomorph embryo he is carrying bursts through his ribcage, causing it to go through Wren's head too, killing them both. The survivors shoot and kill the juvenile xenomorph.|$|E
5|$|In {{the year}} 2001, {{the space station}} Silicon Valley was launched, housing {{numerous}} animals. Seven minutes after its launch, it vanished. Believed to have disappeared forever, it reappears in the year 3000, and the many expeditions sent to retrieve the space station vanished without explanation. Following this, the duo of Dan Danger and Evo were sent to investigate; they discover that the animal cargo has evolved and merged with the station's technology, resulting in animals such as an electronically-powered fox with motorised wheels, and a steam-powered hippopotamus. Evo sets out to fix the control station, which is on <b>a</b> <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> <b>with</b> Earth. Upon arriving at the control room, Evo confronts the Evil Brain, who is fascinated by Evo's abilities and wants to keep him to complete the collection of robotic animals. The Evil Brain threatens to destroy the Earth, but is quickly defeated by Evo. Despite this, Evo is unable to stop the space station from spinning out of control; it collides with Earth, landing in New York Harbor. The robotic animals escape and flee around New York City, and Evo sets out to terminate them before they terrorise the planet.|$|E
25|$|By 2010, rapidly rising {{wages and}} a general {{increase}} in {{the standard of living}} had put increased energy use on <b>a</b> <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> <b>with</b> the need to reduce carbon emissions in order to control global warming. There were diligent efforts to increase energy efficiency and increase use of renewable sources; over 1,000 inefficient power plants had been closed, but projections continued to show a dramatic rise in carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels.|$|E

However, Zandalee feels that she must never abandon her true love Thierry, and quickly ends her affair with Johnny after he forces himself on her in the confessional. She and Thierry re-commit {{themselves}} to each other, but Johnny, now obsessed with her, will not be brushed off that easily. He tracks them to their vacation spot in the Bayou.

5000|$|A {{group of}} astronauts {{set out to}} blow up the {{asteroid}} Flora, which is now on <b>a</b> rapid <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> <b>with</b> the Earth. They land on the asteroid, plant explosive charges, and destroy it, barely escaping being destroyed by the explosion's massive shockwave. Afterwards, they return to the mission's staging area, space station Gamma 3, in high Earth orbit. Unfortunately, a scientist from the mission has unwittingly carried back a luminous-green substance on the leg of his spacesuit, which quickly mutates into one-eyed, tentacled monsters with the ability to discharge lethal bolts of electricity.|$|R
5000|$|Kate Manzoni is a {{journalist}} who is credited with breaking {{the story of the}} [...] "Wormwood Discovery". First detected by a group of amateur astronomers, the Wormwood is a supermassive asteroid on <b>a</b> direct <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> <b>with</b> Earth, projected to arrive in approximately five hundred years with potentially cataclysmic consequences. News of the Wormwood has profound impacts on the world's political and social climate, coinciding with those brought on by advances in WormCam technology. Kate falls in love with Hiram's son Bobby and assists him in breaking free of his father's manipulation, while inadvertently allowing herself to be manipulated by Hiram.|$|R
25|$|Armageddon is a 1998 American {{science fiction}} {{disaster}} film directed by Michael Bay, produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, and released by Touchstone Pictures. The film follows {{a group of}} blue-collar deep-core drillers sent by NASA to stop a gigantic asteroid on <b>a</b> <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> <b>with</b> Earth. It features an ensemble cast including Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck, Billy Bob Thornton, Liv Tyler, Owen Wilson, Will Patton, Peter Stormare, William Fichtner, Michael Clarke Duncan, Keith David, and Steve Buscemi.|$|E
25|$|Various LSTs {{managed to}} move to safety under their own power or with {{assistance}} by tugboats. However others were abandoned and allowed to drift, spreading fires, before sinking in the channel. Leaking oil ignited on the water also spread fires to Tares 7 and 9 {{even though they had}} been unharmed after the first explosions at Tare 8. Eventually tugboats and foam-carrying salvage ships from Pearl Harbor arrived to fight the spreading fires. One ship managed to turn a drifting LST away from <b>a</b> <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> <b>with</b> an ammunition ship docked across the loch at the ammunition depot.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, {{two films}} were {{released}} in the United States {{on the subject of}} attempting to stop impact events: Paramount/DreamWorks' Deep Impact, about a comet, and Touchstone Pictures' Armageddon, about an asteroid. Both involved using Space Shuttle-derived craft to deliver nuclear weapons to destroy their targets. The 2008 American Broadcasting Company's miniseries Impact deals with a splinter of a brown dwarf hidden in a meteor shower which strikes the Moon and sends it on <b>a</b> <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> <b>with</b> Earth. The 2011 film Melancholia uses the motif of an impact event incorporated in the aesthetics of Romanticism.|$|E
40|$|A new {{aiming point}} {{guidance}} (APG) law in 3 -dimensional space is derived analytically. The guidance law {{is capable of}} guiding the missile (interceptor) to <b>a</b> straight <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> <b>with</b> respect to the target. The missile turning rate command proportional to the error angle between the current missile heading and the predicted aim point {{is calculated based on}} the predicted target position. Performance of the APG law is numerically evaluated and compared with the proportional navigation guidance (PNG) law. The result of numerical simulation shows that the APG law is superior to the PNG law in terms of miss distance, time of interception and final stage missile turning rate demand...|$|R
50|$|WAVPM, like later anti-pornography feminists, {{was also}} {{strongly}} opposed to BDSM, {{seeing it as}} ritualized violence against women, and took a particularly active role in opposing it within the lesbian community. This set them on <b>a</b> direct <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> <b>with</b> Samois, <b>an</b> early lesbian sadomasochist group who WAVPM strongly rebuked and whose functions they sometimes picketed. Samois members felt strongly that their way of practicing SM was entirely compatible with feminism, and held {{that the kind of}} feminist sexuality advocated by WAVPM was conservative and puritanical. Samois openly confronted WAVPM with their position, and the exchanges between Samois and WAVPM were among the earliest battles of what later became known as the Feminist Sex Wars.|$|R
5000|$|Subsequently, {{the enemy}} {{launched}} a second effort aimed at reinforcing their beleaguered outpost on Biak. Six Japanese destroyers—three with troops embarked and three towing landing barges—joined cruisers Aoba and Kinu north of Misool Island, {{west of the}} [...] "parrot beak" [...] of New Guinea. The enemy force was under Rear Admiral Naomasa Sakonju in destroyer Shikinami. Proceeding towards Biak, the Japanese reinforcement group remained undetected until 10 B-25 Mitchells, escorted by P-38 Lightnings, spotted them and launched a devastating attack which sank Harusame and damaged three of her sister destroyers. Resuming the run to Biak once the planes had departed, the Japanese continued on <b>an</b> unknowing <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> <b>with</b> Vice Admiral V.A.C. Crutchleys cruisers and destroyers prowling between Biak and Hollandia.|$|R
25|$|A {{public debate}} about {{the cause of the}} {{accident}} arose after the report, in part because of sightings of fighter jets. Such reports had been appearing in the media since shortly after the accident. Fremover reported in January 1987 that radar had observed an unidentified aircraft which was on <b>a</b> <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> <b>with</b> the Twin Otter. The issue escalated with the captain's brother, Widerøe's chief pilot John Hovring, stating that the crash must have occurred {{as a result of a}} collision with a fighter or missile. He further stated that General Mohr as an air force officer had a vested interest in covering up the real cause.|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, France was {{establishing}} {{a foothold in}} neighbouring Vietnam, putting it on <b>a</b> <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> <b>with</b> Siam. Under the orders of Napoleon III, French gunships under Rigault de Genouilly attacked the port of Da Nang in 1858, causing significant damage, and holding the city for a few months. de Gnouilly sailed south and captured the poorly defended city of Saigon in 1859. From 1859 to 1867, French troops expanded their control over all six provinces on the Mekong delta and formed a French Colony, Cochin China. In 1863, France and King Norodom of Cambodia signed a treaty of protection with France, which transferred the country from Siamese and Vietnamese overlordship to French colonial rule. A new treaty was signed between France and Siam on 15 July 1867.|$|E
25|$|The X-Men {{return from}} their {{confrontation}} with Blob and Pyro {{to find the}} mansion in ruins and the Professor and Kitty unconscious.

Magneto plans to redirect the passing Scorpio comet onto <b>a</b> <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> <b>with</b> Earth. This would send up {{a cloud of dust}} and debris, blocking out the Sun for years, plunging the planet into another Ice Age, which would leave normal humans weakened, allowing the mutants to take over. The X-Men leave at once for Magneto's orbiting sanctuary Asteroid M, but the X-Men instruct Kitty to stay, as the mission is far too dangerous and she has not been trained. Kitty, however, wanting to prove her worth and make amends for her previous failure, phases aboard the Blackbird and hides, with the Professor's blessing.|$|E
50|$|It {{shows that}} the pilots kept {{following}} their flight schedules and kept flying in a straight line. However the crew never noticed that the bad weather and the wind that was blowing from the West had blown the aircraft off course and straight to the mountain range. On certain points in the Italian mountains the wind can be so strong that the aircraft was blown on a different course and that the radio-navigation tools on the medium wave couldn't offer the usual assistance which also explained the weak radio signals. In the end, the severe storm together with faulty navigation and a crew which were unfamiliar to the terrain proved to be fatal and send Flight 503 on <b>a</b> direct <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> <b>with</b> the mountain range without anyone realising it.|$|R
5000|$|Shortly thereafter, sensors detect another {{spacecraft}} in fast {{pursuit of}} the Enterprise. Curiously, the craft remains invisible to all but sensors and sets itself on <b>a</b> direct <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> <b>with</b> the ship. Moments later, Spock reports that the invisible craft has disintegrated and deposited an [...] "alien presence" [...] aboard the ship. Captain Kirk turns to see the alien pilot who has beamed himself directly to the bridge. The second alien identifies himself as Bele. Like Lokai, Bele is half black and half white, with the color divided by a line through the exact center of his face. However, the sides of Bele's black and white skin are reversed from those of Lokai, a difference which seems inconsequential to the Enterprise crew, but of great importance to Bele, Lokai, and, apparently, their civilization.|$|R
5000|$|Measurement of {{the proper}} motion of this system show {{that it has a}} low {{transverse}} velocity relative to the Sun.

25|$|The {{imperial}} {{factor was}} a double-edged sword: Rhodes {{did not want}} the bureaucrats of the Colonial Office in London to interfere in the Empire in Africa. He wanted British settlers and local politicians and governors to run it. This put him on <b>a</b> <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> <b>with</b> many in Britain, as well as with British missionaries, who favoured what they saw as the more ethical direct rule from London. Rhodes prevailed because he would pay the cost of administering the territories to the north of South Africa against his future mining profits. The Colonial Office did not have enough funding for this. Rhodes promoted his business interests as in the strategic interest of Britain: preventing the Portuguese, the Germans or the Boers from moving into south-central Africa. Rhodes' companies and agents cemented these advantages by obtaining many mining concessions, as exemplified by the Rudd and Lochner Concessions.|$|E
25|$|The {{first major}} {{challenge}} to the NBA's eligibility rules came from Spencer Haywood. He {{graduated from high school}} in 1968, at a time when college Freshmen were not allowed to play varsity sports for NCAA member schools. He played 3 years at a Colorado junior college, followed by a season at the University of Detroit. After the 1970–71 season, he left college for the NBA's rival at the time, the ABA, which had no rule restricting college underclassmen from entering the league, and had a spectacularly successful rookie season with the Denver Rockets (the predecessor to today's Denver Nuggets), being named the ABA's Rookie of the Year and MVP. Near the end of the season, he turned 21; shortly after its end, he repudiated his contract with the Rockets, claiming he had been defrauded. Haywood then signed a contract with the Seattle SuperSonics, which put him and the Sonics on <b>a</b> <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> <b>with</b> the NBA, as he was only three years removed from his high school graduation.|$|E
25|$|Early in Sonic Adventure 2, Knuckles and Rouge {{argue over}} the Emerald; {{she wants the}} pieces for her {{personal}} collection. Eggman tries to steal it, so Knuckles shatters it aboard Eggman's hovercraft, sending the pieces every which way. He spends the game recollecting the pieces similarly to in Adventure. He later helps Sonic, Tails, and Amy find Eggman's base inside a giant pyramid, {{as well as a}} key to an inner chamber housing a giant space shuttle. He follows them to a giant space station called the ARK with it, where he again scuffles with Rouge over the Emerald. He saves her from falling into a constructed pit of lava; she decides the shards are worthless and dismissively lets him keep them, so he reassembles the Emerald and runs off. The game's antagonist Gerald Robotnik, Eggman's grandfather, initiates a program to send the ARK on <b>a</b> <b>collision</b> <b>course</b> <b>with</b> Earth as revenge for an attack on the ARK decades earlier, so Knuckles teams up with the other playable characters to reroute it.|$|E
40|$|The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment Report {{issued in}} April 2005 shows how {{severely}} our civilisation is degrading and overstressing the natural systems that support {{human life and}} all other lives on earth. An important critical challenge, especially for the eco-humanities, is {{to help us understand}} the conceptual frameworks and systems that disappear the crucial support provided by natural systems and prevent us from see-ing nature as a field of agency. This paper considers the currently popular concept of a cultural landscape {{as an example of a}} concept that downplays natural agency, and discusses the epistemology of nature scepticism and nature cynicism that often accompanies its vogue in the humanities.

5000|$|The National Assembly, {{now without}} the red Republicans and {{determined}} {{to keep them out}} forever, proposed a new election law that placed restrictions on universal male suffrage, imposing a three-year residency requirement.
