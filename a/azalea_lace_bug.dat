40|$|Differential thermal environments were {{examined}} for {{their influence on}} performance traits of a key ornamental pest, the <b>azalea</b> <b>lace</b> <b>bug,</b> Stephanitis pyrioides, in the presence and absence of a generalist predator, the green lacewing, Chrysoperla carnea. 	In laboratory studies, duration of development increased for nymphal instars of S. pyrioides as temperature decreased, producing significant developmental lags in cooler environments. Predation trials identified early nymphal stages as more susceptible to predation than older, dispersal-capable stages, specifically in warmer environments. Additionally, morphological characteristics attained at adulthood combined with behavioral defenses may mediate the reduction in consumption of later S. pyrioides stages by piercing-sucking arthropods such as C. carnea. Field studies confirmed development and life-stage vulnerability findings from the laboratory, however, differential thermal environments created by shading did not generally influence predation. In urban landscapes, S. pyrioides may attain a degree of enemy-free space by occupying a thermal refuge in sunny, exposed habitats...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2017 The <b>azalea</b> <b>lace</b> <b>bug</b> (Stephanitis pyrioides Scott) is a {{recently}} detected invasive pest to the Pacific Northwest {{and has become}} a major concern in Oregon. It feeds on azaleas as well as rhododendrons causing stippling on the top side of leaves. The damage is aesthetically displeasing and affects plant vigor and photosynthetic capabilities, and, in cases with severe damage, can kill plants. The objectives of this work were to: 1) monitor for the presence of potential natural enemies and life stages of S. pyrioides from 2014 to 2016 through sampling in the Willamette Valley in Oregon, 2) observe any resistant cultivars that may be present, and 3) examine biological control efficacy of S. pyrioides using a predator and pathogen. These three objectives were looked at to provide information on what natural enemies are present and what time of the year S. pyrioides control would be most effective, find potential plant characteristics that may confer resistance, and determine if biological control is a viable option to reduce S. pyrioides pest abundance. Two specialist natural enemies of S. pyrioides, Anagrus takeyanus Gordh and Stethoconus japonicus Schumacher were not found and only about 8...|$|E
40|$|Tingidae is {{a rather}} large family in the order Heteroptera {{containing}} approximately 250 genera and 2000 species worldwide. All are phytophagous (feeding on plants) and are host specific. In fact, despite the detailed key provided here, {{one of the most}} important pieces of information necessary for tingid identification is the name of the host plant. Thirty-nine species have been reported in Florida; however, only seven of those are commonly encountered. The most common species that occur in Florida include the <b>azalea</b> <b>lace</b> <b>bug</b> (Stephanitis pyrioides), the hawthorn lace bug (Corythucha cydoniae), the lantana lace bug (Teleonemia scrupulosa) and the sycamore lace bug (Corythucha ciliata). Other important species include the avocado lace bug (Pseudacysta perseae), the fringetree lace bug (Leptoypha mutica), and the oak lace bug (Corythucha floridana). Physical identification of tingids is done primarily through examination of the head, pronotum and hemelytra. Adult lace bugs get their name from the lace-like appearance of their dorsum. This is created by a reticulate network of ridges on the pronotum and hemelytra that divides the area into a series of cells of variable size and shape. Many tingids also bear a strongly developed bucculae. These are ventral flanges on either side of the head that border th...|$|E

40|$|The {{antimicrobial}} {{properties of}} essential oils have been documented, {{and their use}} as “biocides” is gaining popularity. The aims {{of this study were}} to analyze the chemical composition and assess the biological activities of Hedychium essential oils. Oils from 19 Hedychium species and cultivars were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) techniques. The antifungal and insecticidal activities of these oils were tested against Colletotrichum acutatum, C. fragariae, and C. gloeosporioides, and three insects, the <b>azalea</b> <b>lace</b> <b>bug</b> (Stephanitis pyrioides), the yellow fever mosquito (Aedes aegypti), and the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta). Hedychium oils were rich in monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, especially 1, 8 -cineole (0. 1 %– 42 %), linalool (< 0. 1 %– 56 %), a-pinene (3 %– 17 %), b-pinene (4 %– 31 %), and (E) -nerolidol (0. 1 %– 20 %). Hedychium oils had no antifungal effect on C. gloeosporioides, C. fragariae, and C. acutatum, but most Hedychium oils effectively killed azalea lace bugs. The oils also show promise as an adult mosquito repellent, but they would make rather poor larvicides or adulticides for mosquito control. Hedychium oils acted either as a fire ant repellent or attractant, depending on plant genotype and oil concentration...|$|E
