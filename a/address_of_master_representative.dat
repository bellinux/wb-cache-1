We present mechanisms for eavesdropping Bluetooth, there-fore eliminating all the data confidentiality properties of the protocol.

30|$|A final, {{alternative}} configuration {{known as}} the Distributed Nagios Executor (DNX) introduces the concept of worker nodes [36]. In this configuration, a master Nagios server dispatches the service checks from its own schedule {{to a series of}} worker nodes. The master maintains all configuration, workers only require the IP <b>address</b> <b>of</b> the <b>master.</b> Worker nodes can join and leave in an ad hoc manner without disrupting monitoring services. This is beneficial for cloud monitoring; allowing an elastic pool of workers to scale in proportion to the monitored servers. If, however, the master fails all monitoring will cease. Thus, for anything other than the most trivial deployments additional failover mechanisms are necessary.|$|R
50|$|With {{the advent}} of the A Series in the early 1980s, the meaning of this field was changed to contain the <b>address</b> <b>of</b> a <b>master</b> descriptor, which means that 1 Meg data blocks can be allocated, but that the machine memory could be greatly {{expanded}} to gigabytes or perhaps terabytes. This architecture was named ASD (Advanced Segment Descriptors) memory. This required a new common microcode specification, referred to as Beta. The main visionary behind ASD memory is John McClintock. Later the 3-bit memory tag was increased to a 4-bit specification, allowing the segment descriptor to grow from 20 to 23 bits in size, allowing even more memory to be addressed simultaneously. This microcode specification became known as level Gamma.|$|R

Retailers and manufacturers have started improving their master data quality on a syntactical level.

Doctors <b>of</b> theology, <b>masters</b> and <b>representatives</b> <b>of</b> chapters, monks and clerks of inferior orders constantly outnumbered the prelates in it, and the influence of the superior clergy had less weight because instead of being separated into [...] "nations", as at Constance, the fathers divided themselves according to their tastes or aptitudes into four large committees or [...] "deputations" [...] (deputationes). One was concerned with questions of faith (fidei), another with negotiations for peace (pacis), the third with reform (reformatorii), and the fourth with what they called [...] "common concerns" [...] (pro communibus). Every decision made by three [...] "deputations" [...] (the lower clergy formed the majority in each) received ratification for the sake of form in general congregation and, if necessary led to decrees promulgated in session. Papal critics thus termed the council [...] "an assembly of copyists" [...] or even [...] "a set of grooms and scullions". However, some prelates, although absent, were represented by their proxies.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper <b>addresses</b> {{the problem}} <b>of</b> <b>mastering</b> the {{complexity}} <b>of</b> interacting {{with a large}} set of applications on smartphones. In one hand, number of applications increases. In the other hand, screen size reduces. To tackle this paradoxical evolution, we investigate adaptive user interfaces. We assume {{that it is possible}} to predict the applications of interest for a user in a given situation. Based on this hypothesis, our challenge is to accelerate user interaction when prediction is correct, without penalizing it when prediction is wrong. The paper proposes the concept of Evanescent Adaptation. The principle is a two-layer based representation: the predicted items (first layer) are displayed above the full list of items (second layer). The first layer is said to be evanescent in the sense that it automatically disappears progressively. The paper claims for putting this disappearing process under the control of the end-user. Thereby the user can close the first-layer as soon as s/he perceives prediction as irrelevant...|$|R

40|$|The article <b>addresses</b> {{the issue}} <b>of</b> <b>master</b> plans {{and their role}} in {{advancing}} the goals of sustainable development at the local level. The research objectives are threefold: to examine the role of sustainability planning among other strands of planning and to assess the importance of sustainable local development plans/strategies as an important tool for contemporary planners based on literature produced at the international level; to examine how the evolutions {{in the field of}} international planning theory and practice fit with the Romanian context; and to empirically test the perception of local planners with regard to the role sustainability planning and plans play in the future development of their communities. The empirical research is based on two complementary methods: interviews with planners and the assessment <b>of</b> <b>master</b> plans based on a set of pre-determined criteria. The conclusion of the article is that despite the widespread evolution <b>of</b> <b>master</b> plans, they are perceived as a goal in themselves rather than a means. Sustainability considerations are often part of these plans; however, planners themselves seem to have difficulties in labeling a certain policy/program as sustainable or not. In addition, sustainability is defined based on existing definitions rather than being context-driven. The master plans rarely reflect if certain issues are on the public agenda and how the community will address them; thus, in our opinion, the plans by themselves, cannot represent a good indicator of how seriously communities take sustainability. </p...|$|R

Overall, this study explored the willingness of textile and apparel business and industry employers to hire Master 2 ̆ 7 s graduates, and the types of skills, coursework, and experience needed and wanted in employees with a Master 2 ̆ 7 s degree;Data were collected with a mail survey of human resource representatives from 100 textile and apparel manufacturers, store retailers, and catalog retailers with an annual organizational revenue of over 25 million;Results indicated that the possession <b>of</b> a <b>Master</b> 2 ̆ 7 s degree was not considered valuable by most employers in the textile and apparel industry. However, if a Master 2 ̆ 7 s graduate possessed the resources of previous work experience, high interpersonal skills, and high intellectual skills and had an emphasis in marketing or production management, the overall value to some textile and apparel employers increased. Textile and apparel Master 2 ̆ 7 s graduates were rated relatively high in intellectual abilities, but in comparison, lower on interpersonal skills and knowledge gained from work experience. Contrasted against the qualifications that human resources personnel weighted most strongly when making hiring decisions, textiles and apparel Master 2 ̆ 7 s graduates are only perceived to be well qualified in one of three important areas. Textiles and apparel Master 2 ̆ 7 s graduates are perceived as possessing more design and merchandising knowledge; however, employers indicated that business-related knowledge was more desireable for their employees to have;Results indicate that Master 2 ̆ 7 s programs in textiles and apparel should be evaluated to determine if they are providing effective education for students wanting to go into industry. For applied programs, curricular requirements should incorporate possible work experience credit or internship credit to ensure that Master 2 ̆ 7 s students are obtaining some previous work experience. Emphasis in designing curricula to develop interpersonal skills <b>of</b> <b>Master</b> 2 ̆ 7 s graduates should also be <b>addressed.</b> Advisors <b>of</b> <b>Master</b> 2 ̆ 7 s students in applied textiles and apparel programs should counsel students on program emphasis, work experience, and the types of knowledge, skills, and abilities most valued in employees by textile and apparel employers...|$|R
5000|$|Seneca <b>addresses</b> the {{question}} <b>of</b> <b>mastering</b> anger in three parts: 1. {{how to avoid}} becoming angry {{in the first place}} 2. how to cease being angry and 3. how to deal with anger in others. Seneca suggests, to avoid becoming angry in the first place, that the many faults of anger should be repeatedly remembered. One should avoid being too busy or deal with anger-provoking people. Unnecessary hunger or thirst should be avoided and soothing music be listened to. To cease being angry, Seneca suggests [...] "one to check speech and impulses and be aware of particular sources of personal irritation. In dealing with other people, one should not be too inquisitive: It is not always soothing to hear and see everything. When someone appears to slight you, you should be at first reluctant to believe this, and should wait to hear the full story. You should also put yourself in the place of the other person, trying to understand his motives and any extenuating factors, such as age or illness." [...] Seneca further advises daily self-inquisition about one's bad habit. To deal with anger in others, Seneca suggests that the best reaction is to simply keep calm. A certain kind of deception, Seneca says, is necessary in dealing with angry people.|$|R
