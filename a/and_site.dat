5|$|Progress {{was made}} towards the team's new arena on March 22, when the former St. Francis Hospital, {{across the street}} from Mellon Arena, was imploded. Following debris removal <b>and</b> <b>site</b> preparation, {{groundbreaking}} for construction began in the summer.|$|E
5|$|Sophisticated {{techniques}} {{were used to}} delay {{the construction of the}} road. Sit-ins <b>and</b> <b>site</b> invasions were combined with sabotage to stop construction work temporarily. This led to large numbers of police and constant security patrols being employed to protect the construction sites, at great expense. By December 1994, the total cost of construction had been estimated at £6 million and rising by £500,000 every month.|$|E
5|$|By May 1942, Conant {{felt that}} the S-1 Committee had become too unwieldy. It had not met since the March meeting. When he needed expert advice in May, he had called upon a smaller group, and he {{recommended}} that this supervise the OSRD work, mainly the technical and contractual aspects of the project, while the Army handled engineering, construction <b>and</b> <b>site</b> selection. Procurement was an OSRD responsibility, but it could turn to the Army for help in case of difficulties. Bush obtained the president's approval for this, and on June 19, 1942, he abolished the S-1 Section {{and replaced it with}} the S-1 Executive Committee. Conant was appointed as its chairman, and Briggs, Compton, Lawrence, Eger Murphree, and Urey as its other members.|$|E

5|$|Choughs are monogamous, {{and show}} high partner <b>and</b> <b>site</b> fidelity. Both species build a bulky nest of roots, sticks and plant stems lined with grass, fine twiglets or hair. It is {{constructed}} on a ledge, {{in a cave}} or similar fissure in a cliff face, or in man-made locations like abandoned buildings, quarries or dams. Red-billed will also sometimes use occupied buildings such as Mongolian monasteries. The choughs are not colonial, although in suitable habitat several pairs may nest in close proximity.|$|E

5|$|On Allward's {{urging the}} Canadian Battlefields Memorials Commission hired Oscar Faber, a Danish {{structural}} engineer, in 1924 to prepare foundation plans and provide general {{supervision of the}} foundation work. Faber had recently designed the substructure for the Menin Gate at Ypres, and he selected a design that employed cast-in-place reinforced concrete to which the facing stone would be bonded. Major Unwin Simson served as the principal Canadian engineer during {{the construction of the}} memorial and oversaw much of the daily operations at the site. Allward moved to Paris in 1925 to supervise construction and the carving of the sculptures. Construction commenced in 1925 and took eleven years to complete. The Imperial War Graves Commission concurrently employed French and British veterans to carry out the necessary roadwork <b>and</b> <b>site</b> landscaping.|$|E
5|$|Other {{projects}} {{that have not}} begun construction are another Early Childhood/Pre-K Childhood center, classroom and gymnasium additions, and a Student Services Center Parking Lot.

There will also be technology additions (such as 1:1 computers at newly built Klein Cain High School in 2017) and multiple facility capital projects. High School Career and Technology Education programs, music instruments, furniture, and buses are also receiving funding in the 2015 bond.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} few years, Lima shared the turmoil caused by struggles between {{different}} factions of Spaniards. At {{the same time it}} gained prestige as it was designated capital of the Viceroyalty of Peru <b>and</b> <b>site</b> of a Real Audiencia in 1543. Latin America and Lima's first university, the National University of San Marcos was established in 1551 and its first printing press in 1584. Lima also became an important religious center, a Roman Catholic diocese was established in 1541 and converted to an archdiocese five years later. In 1609, the city held celebrations for the beatification of Ignatius of Loyola.|$|E

At the Notch, a {{northern}} {{pass into the}} city <b>and</b> <b>site</b> of a previous battle, the 35th Infantry Regiment encountered 500 North Korean infantry, defeating them. The force surged forward to Pansong, inflicting another 350 casualties on the North Koreans. There, they overran the North Korean 6th Division's headquarters. However {{the rest of the}} task force was slowed by North Korean resistance. Task Force Kean pressed on the Chindong-ni area, resulting in a confused battle where the fragmented force had to rely on air strikes and airdrops to keep it effective.

5|$|The {{history of}} Lima, {{the capital of}} Peru, began with its {{foundation}} by Francisco Pizarro on January 18, 1535. The city was established on {{the valley of the}} Rímac River in an area populated by the Ichma polity. It became the capital of the Viceroyalty of Peru <b>and</b> <b>site</b> of a Real Audiencia in 1543. In the 17th century, the city prospered as the center of an extensive trade network despite damage from earthquakes and the threat of pirates. However, prosperity came to an end in the 18th century due to an economic downturn and the Bourbon Reforms.|$|E
5|$|The only {{surviving}} {{buildings of}} RAF Handforth are the government pay offices {{adjacent to the}} Total Fitness gym on Dairyhouse Lane. These buildings were the Headquarters of the depot and have survived in military/MoD use to this day. The depot had satellite sites within Cheadle Hulme, these being Site Number 5, general storage (beneath the Eden Park road housing development which, until the housing development began still maintained the internal road layout and building foundations) <b>and</b> <b>site</b> number 6 (motor transport storage area) which is now covered by part of the Hursthead housing estate. Three large (150ft × 250ft) steel built, vehicle storage sheds stood at the junction of Malmesbury Road and Lyncombe Close/Tintern Road. The last of these sheds survived well into the 1980s and was latterly used by the local council as a rubbish dump. This stood between Tollard Close and Tintern Road. The houses on May Avenue were built by the RAF as married quarters and exist to this day.|$|E

5|$|The procellariids are {{the most}} {{numerous}} family of tubenoses, and the most diverse. They {{range in size from}} the giant petrels, which are almost as large as the albatrosses, to the prions, which are as small as the larger storm petrels. They feed on fish, squid and crustacea, with many also taking fisheries discards and carrion. All species are accomplished long-distance foragers, and many undertake long trans-equatorial migrations. They are colonial breeders, exhibiting long-term mate fidelity <b>and</b> <b>site</b> philopatry. In all species, each pair lays a single egg per breeding season. Their incubation times and chick-rearing periods are exceptionally long compared to other birds.|$|E
5|$|The red-billed chough breeds {{from three}} years of age, and {{normally}} raises only one brood a year, although the age at first breeding is greater in large populations. A pair exhibits strong mate <b>and</b> <b>site</b> fidelity once a bond is established. The bulky nest is composed of roots and stems of heather, furze or other plants, and is lined with wool or hair; in central Asia, the hair may be taken from live Himalayan tahr. The nest is constructed in a cave or similar fissure in a crag or cliff face. In soft sandstone, the birds themselves excavate holes nearly a metre deep. Old buildings may be used, and in Tibet working monasteries provide sites, as occasionally do modern buildings in Mongolian towns, including Ulaanbaatar. The red-billed chough will utilise other artificial sites, such as quarries and mineshafts for nesting where they are available.|$|E
