5|$|All in all, a GRB {{within a}} few parsecs, with its energy {{directed}} towards Earth, will mostly damage life by raising the UV levels during the burst itself {{and for a few}} years thereafter. Models show that the destructive effects of this increase can cause up to 16 times the normal levels of DNA damage. It has proved difficult to <b>assess</b> <b>a</b> reliable evaluation of the consequences of this on the terrestrial ecosystem, because of the uncertainty in biological field and laboratory data.|$|E

5|$|One of the hardest-hit counties, Curry County, {{introduced}} a ballot measure {{to add a}} 3% sales tax to pay for county services. Oregon {{is one of only}} five states in the United States with no county or state sales tax, and the tax has been voted down regularly by voters whenever it has been proposed (though some areas <b>assess</b> <b>a</b> gas tax, and two cities in tourist areas, Ashland and Yachats, <b>assess</b> <b>a</b> local tax on prepared food). In Josephine County, after a proposed property tax increase to pay for law enforcement was defeated in May 2012, the sheriff's office reduced its staff by 2/3 and released inmates from the county jail to reduce spending. Lane County released 96 prisoners from its prisons and laid off 40 law enforcement personnel to cut costs.|$|E
5|$|Fine {{reckoned}} Lasker {{paid little}} attention to the openings, but Capablanca thought Lasker knew the openings very well but disagreed with a lot of contemporary opening analysis. In fact before the 1894 world title match, Lasker studied the openings thoroughly, especially Steinitz's favorite lines. He played primarily e4 openings, particularly the Ruy Lopez. He opened with 1.d4 relatively rarely, although his d4 games had a higher winning percentage than his e4 ones. With the Black pieces, he mainly answered 1.e4 with the French Defense and 1.d4 with the Queen's Gambit. Lasker also used the Sicilian Defense fairly often. In Capablanca's opinion, no player surpassed Lasker in the ability to <b>assess</b> <b>a</b> position quickly and accurately, in terms of who had the better prospects of winning and what strategy each side should adopt. Capablanca also wrote that Lasker was so adaptable that he played in no definite style, and that he was both a tenacious defender and a very efficient finisher of his own attacks.|$|E
5|$|The Yukon Quest's rules allow race {{officials}} latitude {{on whether}} to <b>assess</b> <b>a</b> time penalty or monetary fine on mushers who violate one or more regulations. The most serious penalties can be assessed for mistreating dogs. Racers have been forcibly removed from the race for inadequate dog care; the most recent instance of this took place in 2008, when Donald Smidt was removed. More common are minor time and monetary penalties. For example, Dan Kaduce was fined $500 of his eventual $9,000 winnings for missing roll call at a mandatory meeting in 2007. Fines of $500 also have been levied for not attending the finish banquet, littering, not wearing start and finish bibs, or losing veterinary records. These minor penalties can {{have an effect on}} the race. In 2009, Hugh Neff, then in second place, was penalized two hours for mushing on the Circle Hot Springs road. As a result, he finished four minutes behind Sebastian Schnuelle, the winner.|$|E

Any car taking between 1:00.001 and 3:00.000 past the six-minute limit will be <b>assessed</b> <b>a</b> two-lap penalty. Any car taking between 3:00.000 to 4:00.000 will be <b>assessed</b> <b>a</b> three-lap penalty, with the final penalty, ten laps, being <b>assessed</b> for <b>a</b> car taking between 4:00.001 to 9:00.000 over the limit. The maximum final lap is now 15 minutes. Under the 2017 rules, {{there would have been a}} ten-lap penalty for the #5 car.|$|R

5|$|The cardiac {{examination}} includes inspection, {{feeling the}} chest with the hands (palpation) and listening with a stethoscope (auscultation). It involves assessment of signs {{that may be}} visible on a person's hands (such as splinter haemorrhages), joints and other areas. A person's pulse is taken, usually at the radial artery near the wrist, {{in order to assess}} for the rhythm and strength of the pulse. The blood pressure is taken, using either a manual or automatic sphygmomanometer or using a more invasive measurement from within the artery. Any elevation of the jugular venous pulse is noted. A person's chest is felt for any transmitted vibrations from the heart, and then listened to with a stethoscope. A normal heart has two hearts sounds – additional heart sounds or heart murmurs may also be able to be heard and may point to disease. Additional tests may be conducted to <b>assess</b> <b>a</b> person's heart murmurs if they are present, and peripheral signs of heart disease such as swollen feet or fluid in the lungs may be assessed.|$|E
