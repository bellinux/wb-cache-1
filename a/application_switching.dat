5000|$|Classic Mac OS did not {{display a}} taskbar onscreen by default. <b>Application</b> <b>switching</b> prior to Mac OS 8.5 {{was done by}} {{clicking}} on an application's window or via a pull-down menu at the right end of the menu bar.

Version 8.5 introduced the ability to optionally also display the application name and to [...] "tear off" [...] the menu by dragging the title with the mouse. The torn off menu was displayed as a palette. The palette window could be configured using AppleScript to appear much like a taskbar, with no title bar and fixed to one edge of the screen. No control panel was provided by Apple to access this functionality, but third-party developers quickly wrote applications that allowed users unfamiliar with AppleScript to customize their application palettes. Third party taskbars such as DragThing were a popular category of shareware on these systems.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Wireless sensor {{networks}} are built from highly resource constrained embedded systems. Supporting multiple applications on the sensor network is a desirable goal, however, these constraints make supporting multiple concurrent applica-tions on each node difficult. Therefore, we propose a dynamic <b>application</b> <b>switching</b> approach where {{only a single}} application is active on each sensor node at a time. In this paper we present a dynamic <b>application</b> <b>switching</b> framework that can automat-ically reprogram the sensor node in response to application requests. We implement our framework on the TelosB platform and evaluate its performance using a 52 -node sensor network testbed. The implementation of a two-stage bootloader reduces the memory requirements to only 1 KiB of program memory and 8 bytes of RAM on this platform. We evaluate the implementation using two different modes of application switching; asynchronous and synchronous. Extensive performance studies indicate that dynamic <b>application</b> <b>switching</b> using our two-stage bootloader is a useful approach to support multiple applications in wireless sensor networks.

40|$|Abstract—The {{aspect of}} {{handling}} interruption plays {{a vital role}} in human computer interaction. Interruptions become disruptive when they occur at inappropriate times. This is the reason that researchers are paying more attention towards predicting interruptions and their effects over the past few decades. We came up with an idea of finding self-initiated intermission to realize fewer distraction in human-computer interaction. Self-initiated intermission is an initiation to report oneself as being available for interaction. It gives the privilege of choosing appropriate time to handle interruptions, so that it would not hamper the current active tasks. Along with self-initiated intermission, interruptibility levels at the time of <b>application</b> <b>switching</b> and at regular intervals are studied. Then, the interruptibility levels in these three conditions are compared to find the most appropriate moment for handling interrupting events. The study shows that self-initiated intermission is the best moment for interrupting user which is less annoying than at the time of <b>application</b> <b>switching</b> and at regular intervals.

40|$|Experiments {{performed}} in controlled environments {{have revealed that}} interruptions occurring at <b>application</b> <b>switching</b> (AS), which correspond to task breakpoints in the computer field, are more subjectively acceptable and require shorter resumption lags (RL), which indicate the cognitive cost. Therefore, in this study, we investigate RLs in uncontrolled office environment. The interruptions at more acceptable ASs were expected to show shorter RLs, because the cognitive costs of the interruption are less. However, contrary to the expected result, the RLs were longer. This implies that factors other than cognitive cost may affect interruptibility in a realistic environment.

We present a user study exploring users ’ abilities to reliably apply twisting and bending forces to various degrees, and draw implications from this study for future forcebased interfaces...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a novel approach}} to generating a general speech user interface to different applications by combining the existing speech user interfaces of the applications automatically. A general speech user interface enables the user to access different applications via speech simultaneously. One key issue of constructing such an interface is how different applications should be integrated. The approach represented in this paper integrates different applications into a general speech user interface by automatic merging their dialogue specifications into a unified dialogue specification, which provides necessary information for a multi-application supported dialogue system to enable the general speech user interface to these applications. In doing so, three issues in general speech user interfaces are addressed – transparent <b>application</b> <b>switching,</b> task sharing and information sharing. 1...|$|E

40|$|The {{resistive}} switching {{effect has}} been studied {{in a set of}} organic polymer - based structures of a different composition and size scale from macro to micro. It is shown that scaling down reduces both the threshold switching voltage Vth and the respective effective electric field Eth. Furthermore, introduction of metal micro particles into a macro scale polymer matrix provides the same effect. Therefore the metal particle incorporation may be regarded as an alternative method of effective scaling, depending on an <b>application.</b> <b>Switching</b> speed of less than 15 ns, threshold voltage Vth ~ (2 – 25) V, 105 cycle endurance, no significant moisture dependence and high retention time 3. 5 months for scaled down samples aswell as for metal doped macro samples have been demonstrated.

40|$|Most {{interfaces}} {{for switching}} between tasks require slow, visual searches of candidates, where each candidate must be scanned in turn. We developed a logging tool for task switching actions and undertook a log-based study with eleven participants to empirically characterise task-switching behaviour, finding Zipfian distributions for window and <b>application</b> <b>switching,</b> and {{significant differences in}} interface use between single and dual monitor users. We then used this data to assist in designing a new interface (Spatially COnsistent Thumbnail Zones or SCOTZ) to allow rapid task-switching performance by utilising spatial memory. In a formal evaluation against three mainstream interfaces under four workspace conditions, SCOTZ attained the lowest mean times for all conditions and scaled better with workspace load, obtaining a significant difference under high workspace load. We conclude with a recommendation for using SCOTZ at all workspace loads, and suggest it be implemented and tested in a real-world environment. Acknowledgment...|$|E
