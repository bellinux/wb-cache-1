40|$|<b>Acetohexamide</b> {{is a drug}} used {{to treat}} type II {{diabetes}} and is tightly bound to the protein human serum albumin (HSA) in the circulation. It has been proposed that the binding of some drugs with HSA can {{be affected by the}} non-enzymatic glycation of this protein. This study used highperformance affinity chromatography to examine the changes in acetohexamide-HSA binding that take place as the glycation of HSA is increased. It was found in frontal analysis experiments that the binding of <b>acetohexamide</b> to glycated HSA could be described by a two-site model involving both strong and weak affinity interactions. The average association equilibrium constant (Ka) for the high affinity interactions was in the range of 1. 2 – 2. 0 × 105 M− 1 and increased in moving from normal to HSA with glycation levels that might be found in advanced diabetes. It was found through competition studies that <b>acetohexamide</b> was binding at both Sudlow sites I and II on the glycated HSA. The Ka for <b>acetohexamide</b> at Sudlow site I increased by 40 % in going from normal HSA to minimally glycated HSA but then decreased back to near-normal values in going to more highly glycated HSA. At Sudlow site II, the Ka for <b>acetohexamide</b> first decreased by about 40 % and then increased in going from normal HSA to minimally glycated HSA and more highly glycated HSA. This information demonstrates the importance of conducting both frontal analysis and site-specific binding studies in examining the effects of glycation on the interactions of a drug with HSA...|$|E

40|$|Sulfonylurea {{drugs are}} often {{prescribed}} {{as a treatment}} for type II diabetes to help lower blood sugar levels by stimulating insulin secretion. These drugs are believed to primarily bind in blood to human serum albumin (HSA). This study used high-performance affinity chromatography (HPAC) to examine the binding of sulfonylureas to HSA. Frontal analysis with an immobilized HSA column was used to determine the association equilibrium constants (Ka) and number of binding sites on HSA for the sulfonylurea drugs <b>acetohexamide</b> and tolbutamide. The results from frontal analysis indicated HSA had a group of relatively high affinity binding regions and weaker binding sites for each drug, with average Ka values of 1. 3 (± 0. 2) × 105 M− 1 and 3. 5 (± 3. 0) × 102 M− 1 for <b>acetohexamide</b> and values of 8. 7 (± 0. 6) × 104 and 8. 1 (± 1. 7) × 103 M− 1 for tolbutamide. Zonal elution and competition studies with site-specific probes were used to further examine the relatively high affinity interactions of these drugs by looking directly at the interactions that were occurring at Sudlow sites I and II of HSA (i. e., the major drug binding sites on this protein). It was found that <b>acetohexamide</b> was able to bind at both Sudlow sites I and II, with Ka values of 1. 3 (± 0. 1) × 105 and 4. 3 (± 0. 3) × 104 M− 1, respectively, at 37 °C. Tolbutamide also appeared to interact with both Sudlow sites I and II, with Ka values of 5. 5 (± 0. 2) × 104 and 5. 3 (± 0. 2) × 104 M− 1, respectively.

Aliphatic ketones, except for benzylacetone, had molar ab-sorptivities similar to that of creatinine, but all of these compounds had equilibrium constants approximately a tenth or less that of creatinine. The common structure for all of the compounds reacting with picrate is the carbonyl group. The variable magnitude of interference for aliphatic and cyclic ketones is ascribable to the different rate constants, molar absorptivities, and equilibrium constants as compared with creatinine. Structuresadjacento the carbonyl group signifi-cantly affect the absorptivity and equilibrium constant, but steric hindrance is the major factor affecting the rate of reaction. We postulate that the carbonyl group is required for the Jaff#{ 233 }reaction, and we suggest a mechanism for the reaction. The requisite structure for interference with the Jaif#{ 233 } method for creatinine has not been determined.

40|$|BACKGROUND: As {{metastasis}} is {{the prime}} cause of death from malignancies, there is vibrant interest to discover options {{for the management of}} the different mechanistic steps of tumour spreading. Some approved pharmaceuticals exhibit activities against diseases they have not been developed for. In order to discover such activities that might attenuate lymph node metastasis, we investigated 225 drugs, which are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. METHODS: A three-dimensional cell co-culture assay was utilised measuring tumour cell-induced disintegrations of the lymphendothelial wall through which tumour emboli can intravasate as a limiting step in lymph node metastasis of ductal breast cancer. The disintegrated areas in the lymphendothelial cell (LEC) monolayers were induced by 12 (S) -HETE, which is secreted by MCF- 7 tumour cell spheroids, and are called 'circular chemorepellent induced defects' (CCIDs). The putative mechanisms by which active drugs prevented the formation of entry gates were investigated by western blotting, NF-κB activity assay and by the determination of 12 (S) -HETE synthesis. RESULTS: <b>Acetohexamide,</b> nifedipin, isoxsuprine and proadifen dose dependently inhibited the formation of CCIDs in LEC monolayers and inhibited markers of epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transition and migration. The migration of LECs is a prerequisite of CCID formation, and these drugs either repressed paxillin levels or the activities of myosin light chain 2, or myosin-binding subunit of myosin phosphatase. Isoxsuprine inhibited all three migration markers, and isoxsuprine and <b>acetohexamide</b> suppressed the synthesis of 12 (S) -HETE, whereas proadifen and nifedipin inhibited NF-κB activation. Both the signalling pathways independently cause CCID formation. CONCLUSION: The targeting of different mechanisms was most likely the reason for synergistic effects of different drug combinations on the inhibition of CCID formation. Furthermore, the treatment with drug combinations allowed also a several-fold reduction in drug concentrations. These results encourage further screening of approved drugs and their in vivo testing...|$|E

40|$|Sulfonylureas arewidely used oral {{drugs in}} the {{treatment}} of diabetesmellitus. They function by the inhibition of ATP-sensitive K+ channels in pancreatic β-cells, which are thus considered the ‘classical ’ sulfonylurea receptor. Next to the ATP-sensitive K+ channels, additional sulfonylurea-interacting proteinswere identified, which might contribute to the physiological effects of this drug family. Most recently, Epac 2 (exchange protein directly activated by cAMP 2) was added to the list of sulfonylurea receptors. However, this finding caused controversy in the literature. The critical discussion of the present paper comes to the conclusion that sulfonylureas are not able to activate Epac 2 directly and are unlikely to bind to Epac 2. Increased blood glucose levels after food intake result in the secretion of insulin from pancreatic β-cells. Glucose levels are detected ‘indirectly ’ by β-cells: owing to increased glycolysis rates, the ratio of cellular ATP/ADP increases and causes the closure of ATP-sensitive K+ channels. In consequence, cells depolarize and voltage-dependent Ca 2 + channels open to cause an increase in the cellular Ca 2 + concentration. Finally, Ca 2 + induces the fusion of insulin-containing granules with the plasma membrane. Sulfonylureas, such as tolbutamide, glibenclamide or <b>acetohexamide,</b> form a class of orally applicable drugs used {{in the treatment of}} non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus...|$|E

In in vivo experiments, rats were given a 100 mg/kg dose of drugs (10 mg/kg for glibenclamide) orally or intraperitoneally. When each drug was administered singly immediately after an oral administration of 1. 5 g/kg ethanol, only carmofur, an antineoplastic, produced marked increases in blood acetaldehyde concentrations. This action was also noted when ethanol was ingested 15 h after administration. The remaining drugs did not increase blood acetaldehyde concentrations. When rats were treated with carmofur at 12 h intervals for 3 consecutive days and were given 1. 5 g/kg ethanol after the final treatment, blood acetaldehyde concentrations were elevated more significantly than with a single administration of carmofur. Furthermore, daily administration of cephem antibiotics containing the MTT group, latamoxef, cefamandole, cefoperazone and cefbuperazone, significantly increased blood acetaldehyde concentrations. Daily administration of sulfonylurea antidiabetics, chlorpropamide and <b>acetohexamide,</b> slightly increased blood acetaldehyde concentrations. Drugs causing increases in blood acetaldehyde concentrations when administration was combined with ethanol ingestion also inhibited ALDH activity in vitro.

The effect of chlorpropamide, its two principle breakdown products and two other sulphonylurea drugs has been studied both alone and in combination with vaso-pressin and dibutyryl cyclic AMP on water transport across the bladder wall of the marine toad, Bufo marinus (Bentley, 1958). A hemi-bladder from each toad acted as control to that used experimentally (sides A and B in Table 1) and the internal bladder solution was 10 mM-choline chloride. When added to various concentrations of vasopressin in Ringer's solution on the serosal surface of the bladder, chlorpropamide (3 =. =x 0 =-mol/l) caused a significant increase in water transport across the bladder wall. However, the drug alone had no effect (expt A). Chlorpropamide did not significantly increase water transport after the addition of dibutyryl cyclic AMP to the serosal surface (expt B) but there was a significantly greater response to the addition of 10 mmol/ 1 theophylline to the bladder in the presence of chlorpropamide. An interesting feature is that the response to chlorpropamide plus theophylline was significantly greater when chlorpropamide rather than theophylline was included in the incubation immediately before both drugs were present in the medium (expt C). A preliminary experiment showed a steady rate of water transport in three separate incubations with 10 mmol/ 1 theophyl¬ line. Experiment D showed that ^-chlorobenzenesulphonylurea (CBSU) and _p-chloro-benzenesulphonamide (CBSA) will potentiate the effect of vasopressin as does chlorpropamide, but this effect was not shared by two other sulphonylurea drugs, glibenclamide and <b>acetohexamide</b> (expt E).

40|$|The {{presence}} of elevated glucose concentrations in diabetes is a metabolic change {{that leads to}} an increase in the amount of non-enzymatic glycation that occurs for serum proteins. One protein that is affected by this process is the main serum protein, human serum albumin (HSA), which is also an important carrier agent for many drugs and fatty acids in the circulatory system. Sulfonylurea drugs, used to treat type 2 diabetes, are known to have significant binding to HSA. This study employed ultrafiltration and high-performance affinity chromatography {{to examine the effects of}} HSA glycation on the interactions of several sulfonylurea drugs (i. e., <b>acetohexamide,</b> tolbutamide and gliclazide) with fatty acids, whose concentrations in serum are also affected by diabetes. Similar overall changes in binding were noted for these drugs with normal HSA or glycated HSA and in the {{presence of}} the fatty acids. For most of the tested drugs, the addition of physiological levels of the fatty acids to normal HSA and glycated HSA produced weaker binding. At low fatty acid concentrations, many of these systems followed a direct competition model while others involved a mixed-mode interaction. In some cases, there was a change in the interaction mechanism between normal HSA and glycated HSA, as seen with linoleic acid. Systems with only direct competition also gave notable changes in the affinities of fatty acids at their sites of drug competition when comparing normal HSA and glycated HSA.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} use of high-performance affinity chromatography (HPAC) and monolithic columns to study drug-protein interactions. The first project studied the binding of imipramine to human serum albumin (HSA) by using HPAC. Frontal analysis and zonal elution competition studies determined that imipramine had one major binding site and a second group of weaker, non-specific binding regions on HSA. ^ The overall objective of {{the remainder of this}} dissertation was to develop microaffinity columns for use in HPAC and drug-protein binding studies. The second project used silica monoliths in affinity microcolumns for the high-throughput analysis of drug-protein interactions. It was found that HSA silica monoliths in affinity microcolumns as short as 1 to 3 mm could be used to provide reliable estimates of retention factor and plate height. A comparison between silica monoliths and silica particles in microcolumns showed that silica monoliths allowed for {{the use of}} faster flow rates because of their better mass transfer properties, which decreased analysis times. ^ The third project used silica particles in columns with lengths from 1 mm to 2 cm to compare affinity microcolumns to traditional longer affinity columns in HPAC. Zonal elution studies showed that retention factor, plate height, and peak asymmetry measurements were fairly consistent across all of the tested flow rates. However, there was a decrease in precision as shorter column lengths were used. Frontal analysis studies determined that association equilibrium constant measurements for all column lengths were consistent. In these studies, using affinity microcolumns for frontal analysis studies to decrease analysis times did not compromise the accuracy of these measurements. ^ The last project used the noncompetitive peak decay method with HSA silica monolith affinity microcolumns to measure the dissociation rate constants of several drugs from HSA. Work with flow rates as high as 10 mL/min made it possible to provide dissociation rate constants for warfarin in less than 40 s. This method was then extended to other drugs known to bind to HSA, including diazepam, imipramine, <b>acetohexamide,</b> and tolbutamide. ...|$|E
