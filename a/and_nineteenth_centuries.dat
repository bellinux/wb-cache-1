5|$|Beyond Julian Park, it {{has been}} conjectured that the {{structure}} originally continued to the Roman garrison fort at Lease Rigg, south west of Sleights, based on reports from antiquarians in the eighteenth <b>and</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>centuries</b> that fragments were visible at numerous points along this course. Hayes and Rutter appear confident of the structure's extent as far as Lease Rigg, but admit that its extent is conjectural from well short of that point, from Dowson Garth Quarry northwards.|$|E

5|$|The Hôtel d'Alluye is a hôtel particulier in Blois, Loir-et-Cher, France. Built for Florimond Robertet {{when he was}} {{secretary}} and notary to Louis XII, the residence bears {{the name of his}} barony of Alluyes. On Rue Saint-Honoré near Blois Cathedral and the Château de Blois, it is now significantly smaller than it was originally as the north and west wings were destroyed between the seventeenth <b>and</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>centuries.</b>|$|E
5|$|The west wing's {{design is}} known only from archival records, {{since it was}} almost totally {{destroyed}} between the seventeenth <b>and</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>centuries.</b> The {{first part of the}} wing consisted of stables, a spiral staircase leading to the exterior façade, a corridor linking the courtyard to the street and a large pantry. During the seventeenth century, the second part held an indoor jeu de paume court and a chapel; its first floor had three large bedrooms.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{excavation}} {{also revealed}} evidence for modern activity around the site. Three post-medieval pits {{were identified in}} and around the barrow, as well as a post-medieval attempt to dig into the chamber. Finds from this period included ceramic sherds, clay pipes dated from between the seventeenth <b>and</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>centuries,</b> stone and clay marbles, brick tile, and bottles dated from between the eighteenth and twentieth centuries. Alexander suggested that this evidence confirmed local accounts that it had been used as a popular spot for picnics. There are also accounts that it came {{to be used as a}} well-known rabbit warren in the local area.|$|E

5|$|In Scotland {{there was}} {{a revival of the}} castle in the late eighteenth <b>and</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>centuries</b> as part of the wider Gothic Revival movement, as new houses were built and {{existing}} buildings remodeled in the Gothic and Scots Baronial styles. Inveraray Castle, constructed from 1746 with design input from William Adam, displays the incorporation of turrets and is among the first houses in the revived style. His son Robert Adam's houses in this style included Mellerstain and Wedderburn in Berwickshire and Seton House in East Lothian, but it is most clearly seen at Culzean Castle, Ayrshire, remodelled by Adam from 1777. These were largely conventional Palladian style houses that incorporated some external features of the Scots baronial style.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th {{century the}} gorge was quarried to produce {{building}} stone for the city. Stone {{was taken by}} boat into the floating harbour. In the 19th century celestine was discovered in Leigh Court estate and the Miles family authorised quarrying. Between 1880 and 1920 Bristol was producing 90% of the world's Celestine, but the enterprise {{did not last long}} into the 20th century. Bristol Diamonds, brilliant quartz crystals found in geodes in dolomitic conglomerate in the gorge, were popular souvenirs for visitors to the Hotwells spa in the eighteenth <b>and</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>centuries.</b> Quarries on the Bristol side of the gorge are now popular with climbers and are a habitat for Peregrine falcons and other wildlife.|$|E
5|$|Inside the church, an {{intricate}} five-tier icon screen funded by Hetman Pavlo Skoropadsky and executed by Hryhoryi Petriv from Chernigov {{was installed in}} 1718.

Some restoration work on the mosaics and frescoes that remained unpainted was carried out {{towards the end of the}} nineteenth century. However, there were no major and serious investigations of the walls done, so it is possible that medieval frescoes or mosaics were preserved under the newer coats of plaster.|$|E

5|$|The {{structure}} {{has been the}} subject of folklore in the surrounding area for several hundred years and possibly more than a millennium. Its construction was commonly attributed to a giant known as Wade, a figure from Germanic or Norse mythology. In the 1720s the causeway was mentioned in a published text and became known outside the local area. Within a few years it became of interest to antiquarians who visited the site and exchanged commentary on its probable historicity. They interpreted the structure as a causeway across marshy ground, attributing its construction to the Roman military, an explanation largely unchallenged throughout the eighteenth <b>and</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>centuries.</b>|$|E
5|$|During {{the eighteenth}} <b>and</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>centuries,</b> {{the mound of}} Cubzac was slashed all around to provide stone for Bordeaux's {{construction}} and the ballast of some river banks, creating deep excavations in the limestone. In 1898, André Cousteau, uncle of the researcher and ecologist Jacques Cousteau, started using the caves to make a sparkling wine based on traditional Champagne-making techniques. The wine, treated in a closed tank, bottled, and kept neck down many months at constant temperature, became bubbly and had its impurities accumulate near the cap. Once this deposit was removed, the bottles were resealed by force, and the corks muzzled. In 1920, the Cousteau property was sold to the Société Anonyme Gay-Mousse. In 1966, the caves where entrusted to Monsieur Lateyron who, one year later, created the Café de Paris.|$|E
