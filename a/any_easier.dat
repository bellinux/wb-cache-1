25|$|Things didn't get <b>any</b> <b>easier</b> {{in their}} next game, away versus Manchester United. Wheater, Cattermole and Aliadière {{returned}} to the starting lineup, but the match began {{the same way as}} Middlesbrough's previous four: conceding a goal within the opening ten minutes. However, Aliadière soon equalised with his first Boro goal, and the first home league goal United had conceded that season. A Downing error gifted Manchester United their second, and Tevez added two more goals in the second half. The 1–4 defeat meant Middlesbrough had then conceded sixteen goals in six league games, while scoring only four.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of the GPALS system’s inception, the tension between the United States and the Soviet Union was lower and the {{perceived}} risk for all-out nuclear war was lower. However, this did not make the design of the system <b>any</b> <b>easier.</b> The GPALS system sought to provide perfect protection from more limited strikes, which made it difficult to design. As stated in a report sent to the Chairman on Governmental Affairs in the Senate, the level of protection outlined in the GPALS system would require excellent performance in multiple different defense functions, including tracking, detecting, and communicating.|$|E

She is looking much healthier than the family has been accustomed to, and they remark frequently on her improved appearance. However, she still retains the haggard facial features of a long-time addict. As a recovering addict, she is restless and anxious. She also suffers from insomnia, which is not made <b>any</b> <b>easier</b> by her husband and children's loud snoring. When Edmund, her younger son, hears her moving around at night and entering the spare bedroom, he becomes alarmed, {{because this is the}} room where, in the past, she would satisfy her morphine addiction. He questions her about it indirectly. She reassures him that she just went there to get away from her husband's snoring.|$|E

500|$|It's {{something}} that's {{very difficult}} for me. Because it is lines on paper when I {{do it in the}} comic book series. It's like, 'Oh, okay, Charlie Adlard [...] doesn’t have to draw that arrangement of lines anymore, that person is dead.' But it's very uncomfortable for me to be on set, because I see these actors that are there and, in the source material, I have killed all but two of them. I walk through the set and I'm like, 'Yep, killed that one, killed that one, killed that one.' And it is firing those people. I feel really bad for Emma Bell, just because she was great and I {{would have liked to have}} had her in the show. But, you know, this is The Walking Dead, characters have got to die. Thankfully, Emma was brought onto the show with the understanding that she was only going to be in a certain number of episodes and she knew that she was going to die from the very beginning. But it doesn’t really make it <b>any</b> <b>easier.</b> When they were shooting those scenes, I had to fly to Comic-Con and so I wasn’t actually there for when she died. But it was very emotional on set and I know that she was very upset about having to leave the crew and the actors. You kind of become a family when you're doing a TV show and it’s a little upsetting to have to get rid of somebody.|$|E
500|$|Ninja Gaiden II was {{reviewed}} again in 2007 {{when the game}} was released for the Virtual Console and received some praise as well as criticism from reviewers. Austin Shau from GameSpot compared the game with the first Ninja Gaiden game as examples of [...] "mean-spirited games" [...] on the NES with high, unforgiving difficulty and excellent controls and gameplay. He applauds Tecmo's artistic detail in the cutscenes, saying that it enhances the storyline and offsets the tedious dialogue. He said that the visuals are better {{than those in the}} first game with the usage of [...] "dynamic environments" [...] such as speeding trains, and he praises the game's fast-paced sound. He and IGN's Lucas Thomas praised the improvement in the controls from its predecessor, more specifically Ryu's ability to freely climb up and down walls and use special weapons while on the walls. Thomas enjoyed the game's [...] "chief innovation" [...] of Ryu's ability to clone himself and use them to take care of enemies – something in which he says [...] "make progressing through levels and taking down bosses much easier and quicker". Reviewers said that the game's difficulty remains high for players as with the previous Ninja Gaiden game. Shau noted that the game is still difficult as was its predecessor but said that the sequel is slightly easier. Thomas stated that the sequel is not <b>any</b> <b>easier</b> to beat than its predecessor and that players will still get frustrated, especially with new environmental features such as blowing wind and rain and absolute darkness in which flashes of lightning illuminates the platforms. Thomas' only criticism of the game was that the storyline was not as good as its predecessor, saying that the plot seemed more predictable and that the cutscenes seemed more generic the second time around. Overall, he noted the lasting appeal of the game, saying that Ninja GaidenII is [...] "a challenging experience the likes of which gamers in the 8-bit era lived and died for".|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} negative {{reviews from}} critics. A writer from Entertainment Weekly gave [...] "Teso Dos Bichos" [...] a C, and sardonically wrote, [...] "No es bueno!" [...] Reviewer Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode a C− and criticized the laziness of the writing, saying, [...] "Maybe I'm missing something here. There {{could be some}} subtext in, um, yeah, I got nothing. The dead rats in the toilet were freaky, right? And they did kill that dog off, so that's hardcore. Really, though, I'm just too disappointed to say much else. This is paint-by-numbers at its most tedious, and while it's nice to have evident proof of how far the show has come since it started, that doesn't make it <b>any</b> <b>easier</b> to sit through." [...] Critical Myth's John Keegan gave the episode a scathing review, only awarding it 1/10. He criticized {{the seriousness of the}} plot and wrote, [...] "Overall, this has {{to be one of the}} worst episodes of the series. In nearly every possible way, the episode fails to live up to the usual expectations. Perhaps aware of how silly the whole thing sounds, the cast and crew seem weary of it all from beginning to end. Even some of the bad ideas in the later seasons don’t fall to this level of inadequacy." [...] Cyriaque Lamar from i09 called the Jaguar Spirit one of [...] "The 10 Most Ridiculous X-Files Monsters" [...] and wrote, [...] "In this fairly ridiculous Season 3 episode, an Ecuadorian artifact possessed by a Jaguar Spirit (or something) causes tabbies to go bonkers and murder people. This scene of Scully fighting a cat deserves the GIF treatment. Make it happen, folks!" [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one stars out of five, calling the premise [...] "achingly unambitious". The two roundly criticized the plot, calling it a [...] "retread of a cursed mummy movie without a mummy", as well as the performances of Trevino, Duchovny, and Anderson. Despite the overall negativity, Shearman and Pearson noted that the [...] "much derided" [...] cat sequence was not [...] "that badly handled." ...|$|E
