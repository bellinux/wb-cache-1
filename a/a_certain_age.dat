5|$|In adults, {{widespread}} {{screening of}} the general population is a matter of debate. Some organizations (such as the United States Preventive Services Task Force) state that evidence is insufficient to support routine screening, while others (such as the American Thyroid Association) recommend either intermittent testing above <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>age</b> in both sexes or only in women. Targeted screening may be appropriate in a number of situations where hypothyroidism is common: other autoimmune diseases, a strong family history of thyroid disease, those who have received radioiodine or other radiation therapy to the neck, those who have previously undergone thyroid surgery, those with an abnormal thyroid examination, those with psychiatric disorders, people taking amiodarone or lithium, and those with a number of health conditions (such as certain heart and skin conditions). Yearly thyroid function tests are recommended in people with Down syndrome, as they are at higher risk of thyroid disease.|$|E
5|$|A krsnik or kresnik {{was a man}} {{born with}} a caul, who could leave his body in spirit {{transformed}} into an animal. He fought demonic men called vukodlak (werewolves) and other evil agents. His victory meant that his village would have the abundance {{of all sorts of}} agricultural products. The krsnik was recorded in Istria, Gorski Kotar, the Kvarner Gulf, and parts of Slovenia. The benandanti were men born with a caul recorded in the region of Friuli in north-eastern Italy. They periodically fought for the fertility of the fields against male and female witches. The táltos, recorded in Hungary, were men and women born with teeth or some other physical peculiarity. They periodically fought each other in the shape of animals or flames. Their battles were often accompanied by storms. The winner would ensure abundant harvest for his village. The benandanti and the táltos were initiated at <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>age</b> into their vocation by an older member of the same group, who visited them in a vision.|$|E
5|$|Some animals {{could also}} be {{regarded}} as dragonlike, such as rams. It was said that a rooster, a gander, or a turkeycock could grow a pair of little wings beneath their natural wings, thus becoming powerful dragons. A dragon rooster dug a hole beneath the threshold of his owner's house. As soon as dark clouds appeared, the rooster {{would go into the}} hole, and his spirit would fly out from his body into the clouds to fight with ale. One day the owner killed the rooster, and immediately went mad. Another dragon rooster, with two combs, would fall to the ground and lie as if dead during thunderstorms. The Aesculapian snake (smuk in Serbian and smok in Bulgarian) was regarded as a very beneficial animal. People avoided disturbing it in any way. The Aesculapian snake which inhabited a crop field or a vineyard was seen as its guardian. The snake was said to fly into the hail clouds and drive them away from its field or yard, or it dispersed the clouds by raising its head high in the air and hissing as strong as it could. In the region of Niš, the Aesculapian snakes were said to help the dragon boy in his fights against ale. If an Aesculapian snake attained <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>age,</b> it would grow wings and become a dragon.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} enhance the {{mechanical}} properties of wet gels for aerogel production, aging studies by using three different routes was performed. The wet gels were prepared from a polyethoxydisiloxane precursor by using HF as a catalyst. The three different aging routes studied were i) aging in sealed mould, ii) aging in solvent and iii) aging in simulated pore liquid, i. e. a solvent with small amounts of water and HF resembling the mother liquor. All aging processes gave stronger and stiffer wet gels however, a maximum in strength and stiffness was observed after <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>aging</b> time. The simulated pore liquids allowed short aging time {{in the range of}} 8 h to achieve the maximum mechanical strength, however the maximum in strength was lower than for the other two aging routes. From the wet gels, monolithic and transparent aerogels were obtained by supercritical drying at small-, mid- and large-scale. The aging strengthening process was successfully transferred to larger scales giving both lower density and higher transparency compared to small-scale...|$|R

40|$|When a {{spin glass}} is cooled down, {{a memory of}} the cooling process is {{imprinted}} in the spin structure. This memory can be disclosed in a continuous heating measurement of the ac-susceptibility. E. g., if a continuous cooling process is intermittently halted during <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>aging</b> time at one or two intermediate temperatures, the trace of the previous stop(s) is recovered when the sample is continuously re-heated [1]. However, heating the sample above the aging temperature, but keeping it below Tg, erases {{the memory of the}} thermal history at lower temperatures. We also show that a memory imprinted at a higher temperature can be erased by waiting a long enough time at a lower temperature. Predictions from two complementary spin glass descriptions, a hierarchical phase space model and a real space droplet picture are contested with these memory phenomena and interference effects.

40|$|Filtration {{effects of}} turkey egg white {{lysozyme}} solution (TEWL) prior to subjecting it to crystallization conditions are investigated. Filtering TEWL solution and crystallizing it in ungelled media significantly decreased {{the number of}} conditions yielding crystals. This decrease dependent on the membrane cut-off used for filtration. From this, the postulated factors aiding in nucleation {{are estimated to be}} 0. 17 microns in diameter. The existence of these factors was verified by the procedure of reversed filtration: filtered solutions passed through their inverted filter membrane a second time lead to improved crystallization results. The effect of aging of the TEWL solution prior to subjecting it to ungelled crystallization conditions was also verified. We did not find any time-dependent change in the size or the number of crystals per drop. Repeating the filtration experiments in agarose-gelled crystallization media showed that the influence of filtration on the crystallization outcome was significantly diminished. Far better crystallization results were obtained compared to ungelled media. However, there is <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>aging</b> effect linked to filtration in gelled media. Different crystallization results were obtained depending on whether filtration was performed before or after aging and subsequent crystallization.

This project focuses on object-based segmentation and four approaches: multiresolution segmentation of eCognition Professional 4. 0, along with edge-based segmentation, marker controlled segmentation and efficient graph-based segmentation of python. They were investigated in terms of their performances and a comparison was made between them. Results showed that the quality of multiresolution segmentation is the best of the four.

The result of marker controlled segmentation was good to segment <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>aged</b> heather stands. This is due to the limited number of user-defined markers. Efficient graph-based segmentation showed the closest result to that of multiresolution segmentation of eCognition Professional 4. 0.

For edge-based segmentation, the time consumed was about 13 seconds, followed by efficient graph-based (16 seconds) and marker controlled segmentation (26 seconds).
