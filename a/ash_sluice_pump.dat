40|$|In this study, we {{simulated}} {{water flow}} {{in a water}} conservancy project consisting of various hydraulic structures, such as <b>sluices,</b> <b>pumping</b> stations, hydropower stations, ship locks, and culverts, and developed a multi-period and multi-variable joint optimization scheduling model for flood control, drainage, and irrigation. In this model, the number of <b>sluice</b> holes, <b>pump</b> units, and hydropower station units to be opened were used as decision variables, and different optimization objectives and constraints were considered. This model was solved with improved genetic algorithms and verified using the Huaian Water Conservancy Project as an example. The {{results show that the}} use of the joint optimization scheduling led to a 10 % increase in the power generation capacity and a 15 % reduction in the total energy consumption. The change in the water level was reduced by 0. 25  m upstream of the Yundong Sluice, and by 50 % downstream of pumping stations No. 1, No. 2, and No. 4. It is clear that the joint optimization scheduling proposed in this study can effectively improve power generation capacity of the project, minimize operating costs and energy consumption, and enable more stable operation of various hydraulic structures. The results may provide references for the management of water conservancy projects in complex river networks...|$|R
40|$|This {{revision}} (Rev. 1) updates {{the schedule}} and designation of responsibilities for the Old Hydrofracture Facility (OHF) tanks contents removal project. Ongoing and planned future activities include: cold {{testing of the}} <b>sluicing</b> and <b>pumping</b> system; readiness assessment; equipment relocation and assembly; isotopic dilution of fissile radionuclides; sluicing and transfer of the tanks contents; and preparation of the Removal Action Completion Report. The most significant change is that the <b>sluicing</b> and <b>pumping</b> system has been configured by and will be operated by CDM Federal Programs Corporation. In addition, a new technical lead and a new project analyst have been designated within Lockheed Martin Energy Systems, Inc. and Lockheed Martin Energy Research Corp. The schedule for tanks contents removal has been accelerated, with transfer of the final batch of tank slurry now scheduled for March 31, 1998 (instead of November 10, 1998). The OHF <b>sluicing</b> and <b>pumping</b> project is proceeding as a non-time-critical removal action under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. The purpose of the project is to remove the contents from five inactive underground storage tanks, designated T- 1, T- 2, T- 3, T- 4, and T- 9.

50|$|The lock {{opened up}} nearly 12 mi of waterway. As {{part of the}} upgrade, new 48-hour {{moorings}} were constructed on The Haven, for boats {{about to enter the}} Drain, and on the South Forty-Foot Drain near the Black <b>Sluice</b> <b>pumping</b> station at Boston, at Swineshead Bridge and at Hubbert's Bridge.The upper limit of navigation was initially Donington High Bridge, where the Swaton Eau joins the South Forty-Foot Drain and provides a wider section where boats can be turned. Beyond the bridge, the drain was officially only suitable for canoes and kayaks.However, eight narrow boats cruised on the waterway at Easter 2009, and although the channel was narrower and not as deep after Donington Bridge, all of them successfully reached Kingston's Bridge, some 3.7 mi further on, where the outlets from Dowsby Fen and Gosberton pumping stations provided enough width to turn a 70 ft boat. Further progress was blocked by scaffolding erected so that the bridge could be re-decked, rather than by lack of water.|$|R
40|$|This Operations Plan {{summarizes}} the operating activities for transferring contents of five low-level (radioactive) liquid waste storage tanks {{associated with the}} Old Hydrofracture Facility (OHF) to the Melton Valley Storage Tanks (MVST) for secure storage. The transfer will be accomplished through <b>sluicing</b> and <b>pumping</b> operations which are designed to pump the slurry in a closed circuit system using a sluicing nozzle to resuspend the sludge. Once resuspended, the slurry will {{be transferred to the}} MVST. The report documenting the material transfer will be prepared after transfer of the tank materials has been completed. The OBF tanks contain approximately 52, 600 gal (199, 000 L) of low-level radioactive waste consisting of both sludge and supernatant. This material is residual from the now-abandoned grout injection operations conducted from 1964 to 1980. Total curie content is approximately 30, 000 Ci. A <b>sluicing</b> and <b>pumping</b> system has been specifically designed for the OHF tanks contents transfer operations. This system is remotely operated and incorporates a sluicing nozzle and arm (Borehole Miner) originally designed for use in the mining industry. The Borehole Miner is an in-tank device designed to deliver a high pressure jet spray via an extendable nozzle. In addition to removing the waste from the tanks, the use of this equipment will demonstrate applicability for additional underground storage tank cleaning throughout the U. S. Department of Energy complex. Additional components of the complete <b>sluicing</b> and <b>pumping</b> system consist of a high pressure pumping system for transfer to the MVST, a low pressure pumping system for transfer to the recycle tank, a ventilation system for providing negative pressure on tanks, and instrumentation and control systems for remote operation and monitoring...|$|R

Oil and paraffin engines began to replace steam and wind engines from 1910, and by 1935 there were 15 such engines pumping water into the South Forty-Foot Drain. The passing of the Land Drainage Act 1930 resulted in the Commissioners being replaced by the Black Sluice Internal Drainage Board, while responsibility for the rivers in the area passed to the Witham and Steeping Rivers Catchment Board. With war imminent, the Rivers Board took over the Black Sluice and the South Forty-Foot Drain in 1939, and although progress was interrupted by the Second World War, a £374,000 scheme to construct the Black <b>Sluice</b> <b>pumping</b> station and to widen [...] of the drain from Boston to Donington Bridge was completed in 1946.

40|$|Lecturepg. 85 A {{systematic}} {{investigation was}} started within the Texas Utilities Generating Company Power station feedwater pump systems due to unsatisfactory unit availability, frequent equipment breakdown, high maintenance costs, and high replacement parts costs. This action was greatly encouraged by successful corrective {{actions taken by}} other utilities [1, 2, 3], results of failure surveys across the U. S. A [4, 5), and systematic long range research and development, field testing and troubleshooting by the authors, and close cooperation and exchange of ideas and results with at least on oil company [6]. A total of 36 pumps was modified in the Texas Utilities system as described in this paper. This included 16 boiler feed pumps (BFP), 7 high pressure (HP) booster pumps, 6 low pressure (LP) booster pumps, and 7 other pump applications. The operating behavior of all pumps improved exactly as expected, {{with the exception of}} one high pressure booster pump, which is described as a special case, with the emphasis on the importance or re-assembly and maintenance procedures.

40|$|This report {{details the}} {{development}} of a reconfigurable in-tank robotic cleanup system called Houdini{trademark}. Driven by the general need to develop equipment for the removal of radioactive waste from hundreds of DOE waste storage tanks and the specific needs of DOE sites such as Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Fernald, Houdini{trademark} represents one of the possible tools {{that can be used to}} mobilize and retrieve this waste material for complete remediation. Houdini{trademark} is a hydraulically powered, track driven, mobile work vehicle with a collapsible frame designed to enter underground or above ground waste tanks through existing 24 inch riser openings. After the vehicle has entered the waste tank, it unfolds and lands on the waste surface or tank floor to become a remotely operated mini-bulldozer. Houdini{trademark} utilizes a vehicle mounted plow blade and 6 -DOF manipulator to mobilize waste and carry other tooling such as <b>sluicing</b> <b>pumps,</b> excavation buckets, and hydraulic shears. The complete Houdini{trademark} system consists of the tracked vehicle and other support equipment (e. g., control console, deployment system, hydraulic power supply, and controller) necessary to deploy and remotely operate this system at any DOE site. Inside the storage tanks, the system is capable of performing heel removal, waste mobilization, waste size reduction, and other tank waste retrieval and decommissioning tasks. The first Houdini{trademark} system was delivered on September 24, 1996 to Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). The system acceptance test was successfully performed at a cold test facility at ORNL.

40|$|Abstract: Obstacles like weirs, watermills {{and locks}} are a barrier for migratory fish in our watercourses.

Although much numerous fish passes have been designed to solve this problem, these fish passes don’t always work optimal. More insight into fish behavior is needed to improve fish pass efficiency, and acoustic telemetry allows such detailed observation of spatio-temporal migration patterns. We present novel findings on fish behavior at anthropogenic structures based on acoustic telemetry. The impact of several constructions like <b>sluices,</b> weirs, <b>pumping</b> stations and small-scale hydropower plants will be assessed and potential solutions to enhance fish migration at these structures will be discussed. This approach will allow to identify crucial information needs for effective fish passage management and reveals a promising range of opportunities for fish passage research...|$|R
50|$|The {{presence}} of barriers across waterways {{has been identified}} as one of the factors behind the decline in eel populations, and following new regulations introduced in 2009, a study was carried out to assess which catchments bordering the Humber could provide suitable habitat for eels.

On Adlingfleet drain, the entrance sluice acted as a barrier, and there was a second barrier at the <b>sluice</b> and <b>pumping</b> station by Cowlane Bridge. Although rectification was deemed to be difficult, the drain was ranked fourth in a list of tributaries that could support the migration of eels and other migratory fish. By May 2011, an innovative fish-flap had been fitted, which does not compromise the flood protection, but allows fish to pass at certain states of the tide.|$|R

The <b>sluiced</b> <b>ash</b> had an initial pH value of 9. 1 (1 : 1 H 2 O) and contained an equivalent CACO 3 content of 11. 5 % (+ 0. 2 %) based on total content of Ca and Mg in the ash. Fly ash was applied at rates of up to 167 tonnes ha- 1 to samples of the surface horizon (0 - 15 cm) of an acidic clay textured soil found local to the power plant. Application of fly ash increased soil pH values but a high concentration of boron in the added ash limited plant growth. Results indicated that the <b>sluiced</b> <b>ash</b> could be used as a liming material at application rates of up to 110 tonnes ha- 1, on acidic, clay textured soils provided boron tolerant crops such as alfalfa were grown.

40|$|Abstract The river delta in The Netherlands {{consists}} of interconnected rivers and large water bodies. Structures, such as large <b>sluices</b> and <b>pumps,</b> {{are available to}} control the local water levels and flows. The national water board {{is responsible for the}} management of the system. Its main management objectives are: protection against overtopping of dikes due to high river flows and high sea tides, supply of water during dry periods, and navigation. The system is, due to its size, divided into several subsystems that are managed by separate regional divisions of the national water board. Due to changes in local land-use, local climate, and the need for energy savings, the currently existing control systems have to be upgraded from local manual control schemes to regional model predictive control (MPC) schemes. In principle, the national objectives for the total delta require a centralized control approach integrating all regional MPC schemes. However, such centralized control is on the one hand not feasible, due to computational limitations, {{and on the other hand}} unwanted, due to the existing regional structure of the organization of the national water board.

500|$|The {{effect of}} {{drainage}} {{on the light}} peaty soils was that further shrinkage occurred, and land levels continued to fall. By the late 1920s, gravity discharge alone {{could no longer be}} relied upon to provide an adequate level of flood protection, and a change to pumped drainage began. A new <b>sluice</b> and <b>pumping</b> station were constructed at St Germans, which was completed in 1934. The sluice was built in the centre of the old syphon sluice channel, with a pumping station on either side of it. Three pump sets were installed, with space for a fourth. Each consisted of a [...] Crossley diesel engine coupled to an [...] Gwynnes pump, which could pump 840 tons per minute (1,234 megalitres per day [...] ). Once completed, the syphon sluice was demolished, while Hawkshaw's replacement sluice and its channel were abandoned. The new works were paid for by a grant, given on condition that three quarters of the workforce were from the local area. The capacity of the station was increased in 1951, when a [...] Crossley diesel engine was fitted into the spare bay, and again in 1969–70, when the two pumps {{on the north side of}} the sluice were rebuilt, and the engines replaced by [...] electric motors.|$|R
25|$|The {{banks of}} the river below Bawtry have been raised so that the river acts as a high level carrier for the {{drainage}} of the surrounding land. The area between {{the river and the}} Chesterfield Canal to the south and the Warping Drain to the north is drained by a network of drainage ditches, which are connected to the river by a number of <b>sluices</b> and <b>pumping</b> stations. Water is pumped from the ditches to avoid flooding of the agricultural land, although the pumping station at Gringley can operate in reverse, supplying water to the ditches for irrigation when required. The outflow into the River Trent is controlled by a pumping station and two sluices. A vertical sluice gate protects the entrance to the Idle, and the pumping station and another sluice are situated further back. When the water level in the Trent is low, the sluice gates allow water to leave the Idle by gravity, but at high tide, four electric pumps are used to pump the outflow into the space between the sluice gates until it can again discharge by gravity. The pumping station was commissioned in 1981, and was the largest all-electric pumping station in Britain at the time. When all four pumps are operating, it can discharge 2,124 tons per minute (3,059 Mld).|$|R

The station could discharge 800 tons per minute (1175 Mld) when all three pumps were running. Once the station was complete, the old sluice was blocked off. Further improvements to the drainage of the area occurred {{in the next few}} years, with a pumping station being built at Wrangle Horseshoe, at the [...] eastern edge of the district, in 1959, and the first electric pump being installed at Lade Bank pumping station in 1963. The electric motor drove a [...] pump. Two new pumping stations at Leverton and Benington were completed in 1976, again on the eastern edge and pumping directly into The Wash. The pumping station at Thorpe Culvert was managed by the Anglian Water Authority, but a replacement in 1983 was partly funded by the Fourth District. The Hobhole pumping station was modified in 1988, when the old sluice channel was reopened and the sluices were fitted with four [...] submersible electric pumps, manufactured by Flygt. The number of electric pumps at Lade Bank was increased to three in 1990.
