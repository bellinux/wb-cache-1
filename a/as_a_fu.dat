40|$|Z CMa is {{a binary}} system which {{consists}} of two young stars: A Herbig AeBe component "Z CMa NW" embedded in a dust cocoon and a less massive component "Z CMa SE", which is classified <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>FU</b> Orionis type star. Recently, the system showed the largest outburst reported during the almost 90 years of available observations. During the recent outburst we detect that the Z CMa system is polarized by 2. 6 % in the continuum and emission line spectrum, with a position angle still perpendicular to the jet. From {{the high level of}} polarization we conclude that the outburst is associated with the dust embedded Herbig AeBe NW component. The main result of our studies is that the bolometric luminosity of Z CMa remained surprisingly constant during the recent "outburst". We conclude that either the geometry of the cavity through which the light escapes from the cocoon has opened a new path, or that the screen of dust, which reflects the light toward the observer became more efficient causing the observed increase of the visual brightness by about 2. 5 magnitudes.

40|$|We {{present a}} multi-epoch {{infrared}} photometric {{study of the}} intermediate-mass star forming region G 173. 58 + 2. 45. Photometric observations are obtained using the near-infrared JHKL'M' filters and narrow-band filters centered at the wavelengths of H_ 2 (1 - 0) S(1) (2. 122 μm) and [FeII] (1. 644 μm) lines. The H_ 2 image shows molecular emission from shocked gas, implying the presence of multiple star formation and associated outflow activity. We see evidence for several collimated outflows. The most extended jet is at least 0. 25 pc in length and has a collimation factor of ∼ 10, which {{may be associated with}} a binary system within the central cluster, resolved for the first time here. This outflow is found to be episodic; probably occurring or getting enhanced during the periastron passage of the binary. We also find that the variable star {{in the vicinity of the}} outflow source, which was known <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>FU</b> Ori type star, is probably not a FU Ori object. However, it does drive a spectacular outflow and the variability is likely to be related to accretion, when large clouds of gas and dust spiral in towards the central source. Many other convincing accretion-outflow systems and YSO candidates are discovered in the field. Comment: 15 pages, 9 figures, accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{highlights}} the im portance of feedback in work - integrated learning (WIL), the key role of workplace supervisors, {{and the importance}} of continuous improvement in systems to support feedback processes. The paper proposes a definition of feedback and formative feedback, as well as approaches for providing industry feedback in W I L. It further reports on a case analysis based on workplace supervisors providing feedback to students in engineering and urban development, yielding certain insights into student pe rformance in the workplace, and m ore importantly, hi ghlighting the need to enhance the use of feedback processes. This is requir ed in a context where delivering feedback in WIL is generally acknowledge d to be complex, and where the role of the industry supervisor in appraising the performance of the student in the workplace needs to be very c learly defined in order for supervisor s ’ feedback to have optimal impact. F eedback in WIL i s set against the bac kdrop of recognizing the importance and complexity of stakeholder engagement in WIL in general, and the intricacy associated with the provision of feedback from industry supervisors in particular.

40|$|Interfacial {{delamination}} {{is known}} as one of the root causes of failure in microelectronic industry. In order to explore the risk of interface damage, FE simulations for the fabrication steps as well as for the testing conditions are generally made in the design stage. In order to be able to judge the risk for interface fracture, the critical fracture properties of the interfaces being applied should be available, for the occurring combinations of temperature and moisture preconditioning. As a consequence there is an urgent need to establish these critical interface fracture parameters. For brittle interfaces such as between epoxy molding compound (EMC) and metal (-oxide) substrates the critical energy release rate (or delamination toughness, Gc) can be considered as the suitable material parameter. This material parameter is strongly dependent on the temperature, the moisture content of the materials involved and on the so-called mode mixity of the stress state near the crack tip. The present study deals with experimental investigation of the delamination toughness of EMC-Copper lead-frame interfaces as can directly be obtained from the production line. The experimental set-up as designed for this purpose was previously reported [1], together with some measurement results and toughness evaluations for room temperature fracture tests. This study deals with the experimental and simulation procedures to establish the interfacial fracture toughness from fracture test results at different temperatures, especially in the glass transition temperature region of epoxy molding compound. In order to calculate accurate fracture toughness, the viscoelastic material properties of molding compound are measured and considered. A special test procedure used to investigate the fracture properties in the glass transition temperature region of EMC will be introduced. The FE model used to simulate the viscoelastic material behavior will be discussed. The delamination toughness <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>fu...</b>|$|E
40|$|Global {{stores of}} {{radioactive}} waste {{are housed in}} surface stores where actinides are susceptible to environmental release. It is imperative that waste disposal facilities are built to safely contain this waste. However, to do this we must ensure that the e ngineered and natural barriers are sufficient to prevent the buried materials from migrating through to the surface. Solutions migrating from repositories (ILW and LLW) will have {{a wide range of}} chemical compositions and conceptual models constraining the key mineral - water interactions with realistic lithologies are urgently needed. To this end, we conducted experiments to study U removal from solution via mineral - surface interactions with quartz, sandstone, and volcanic rock over a pH range of 2 - 12, with varying concentrations of U (10 ppb, 0. 1 ppm, 1 ppm, and 10 ppm) and with and without bicarbonate added (2 mM) with 0. 1 M NaCl electrolyte. We observed that the U concentration in solution had little effect on the extent of U removal from solution <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>fu</b> nction of pH or bicarbonate concentration 2 with quartz and sandstone but was important for volcanic rocks, where removal of U, due to adsorption, decreased with increasing U concentration between pH 4 and 8. When bicarbonate was added to solution then the quartz, sandstone, and volcanic rock geomaterials acted similarly in their abilities to immobilize uranium, with an adsorption envelope from pH 4 - 8 followed by an increase in U removal, likely via precipitation, at high pH. When bicarbonate was not added, the removal of U from solution was more controlled by the geomaterial. Bicarbonate addition at pH 6 - 10 lowered adsorption. However, the addition of bicarbonate in experiments with 10 ppm U at pH 10 - 12 allowed for precipitation of U at the rock surface, making bicarbonate an immobilizing factor. Therefore, our conceptual model shows that U is immobilised from radioactive waste - like solutions in a bimodal distribution, both at low (6) and high (11) pH...|$|E

40|$|We present pre- and post-outburst {{observations}} of the new FU Orionis-like young stellar object PTF 10 qpf (also known as LkHa 188 -G 4 and HBC 722). Prior to this outburst, LkHa 188 -G 4 was classified <b>as</b> <b>a</b> classical T Tauri star {{on the basis of}} its optical emission-line spectrum superposed on a K 8 -type photosphere, and its photometric variability. The mid-infrared spectral index of LkHa 188 -G 4 indicates a Class II-type object. LkHa 188 -G 4 exhibited a steady rise by ~ 1 mag over ~ 11 months starting in Aug. 2009, before a subsequent more abrupt rise of > 3 mag on a time scale of ~ 2 months. Observations taken during the eruption exhibit the defining characteristics of FU Orionis variables: (i) an increase in brightness by > 4 mag, (ii) a bright optical/near-infrared reflection nebula appeared, (iii) optical spectra are consistent with a G supergiant and dominated by absorption lines, the only exception being Halpha which is characterized by a P Cygni profile, (iv) near-infrared spectra resemble those of late K [...] M giants/supergiants with enhanced absorption seen in the molecular bands of CO and H_ 2 O, and (v) outflow signatures in H and He are seen in the form of blueshifted absorption profiles. LkHa 188 -G 4 is the first member of the FU Orionis-like class with a well-sampled optical to mid-infrared spectral energy distribution in the pre-outburst phase. The association of the PTF 10 qpf outburst with the previously identified classical T Tauri star LkHa 188 -G 4 (HBC 722) provides strong evidence that FU Orionis-like eruptions represent periods of enhanced disk accretion and outflow, likely triggered by instabilities in the disk. The early identification of PTF 10 qpf <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>FU</b> Orionis-like variable will enable detailed photometric and spectroscopic observations during its post-outburst evolution for comparison with other known outbursting objects.
