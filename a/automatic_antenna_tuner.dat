50|$|The basic circuit {{required}} when lumped capacitances and inductors {{are used}} is shown below. This circuit {{is important in}} that many <b>automatic</b> <b>antenna</b> <b>tuners</b> use it, and also because more complex circuits can be analyzed as groups of L-networks.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the lower}} shortwave {{frequencies}} e.g. 1.8 MHz, the antennas {{need to be}} physically large to enable good coupling to [...] "space" [...] and hence efficient radiation. As an example, at 5 MHz a half wave dipole antenna is around 30 meter in length and 2 MHz it is 75 meter long. Half wave horisontal dipoles are efficient radiators, if they are high above ground in terms of electromagnetic waves wavelengths - if not then half wave horisontal dipoles are inefficient radiators. Half wave dipoles are narrow band (only work over a very small frequency range) before serious impedance mismatch occurs. This mismatch can be accommodated using an <b>antenna</b> <b>tuner</b> but these add to costs and modern shortwave communication often uses frequency hopping techniques. Even <b>automatic</b> <b>antenna</b> <b>tuners</b> will not work with frequency hopping signals.|$|R
40|$|The {{impedance}} of {{an antenna}} changes heavily with changing EM environments, while RF power amplifiers (PAs) are optimized for driving a well-defined load impedance. As a solution, switchable matching networks {{are used in}} <b>automatic</b> <b>antenna</b> <b>tuners</b> to match the antenna impedance to (about) the desired PA load impedance. This paper presents a theoretical treaty of the minimum number of required states for switchable matching networks to achieve sufficient matching from a certain load VSWR to a sufficiently low input VSWR. First for an arbitrary passive lossless switchable matching network, the mathematical minimum required number of states {{as a function of}} the required input VSWR and of the required load VSWR is derived. Several variants are analyzed and benchmarked: single-stage one-ring configuration, single-stage two-ring configuration, two-stage one-ring configuration and three-stage one-ring configuration showing that single-ring configurations are optimum. An extension towards the required number of states for lossy matching networks is also provided...|$|R

40|$|Abstract— The {{operating}} environment of mobile phones fluctuates continuously, due to changing handling onditions and nearby objects. The resulting fluctuations in antenna impedance cause both {{a decrease in}} link quality and a higher standing wave ratio, that requires more robust and hence less efficient PA implementations. In this paper an <b>automatic</b> <b>antenna</b> <b>tuner</b> system for handheld applications is presented that uses two series reactances combined with 3 simple RF-peak detectors to sense both reactive and real impedance mismatches. The control loop only requires low-frequency electronics which makes it low cost,low power and relatively easy to integrate. Measurements on a demonstrator system show correct behaviour for VSWR up to 10...|$|E

50|$|As a {{broadband}} antenna, the T2FD will normally {{display a}} reasonably low {{standing wave ratio}} (SWR) across its entire frequency range. However, at some frequencies the loading element may be moderately reactive, so {{the use of an}} <b>antenna</b> <b>tuner</b> may be needed when using modern solid-state transmitters at anything approaching their rated power output. Also, “low SWR” does not mean high antenna efficiency. This antenna is not recommended for those wanting to make serious weak signal contacts. A dipole cut for the lowest used frequency, fed with ladder line, and matched with an <b>antenna</b> <b>tuner</b> would perform better than the T2FD over the HF region of frequencies.|$|R

40|$|Two-way {{communications}} using 3 to 30 MHz, high-frequency (HF) radio, {{also known}} as shortwave radio, provides worldwide coverage with no infrastructure required between stations. Amateur or “Ham” radio operators apply this advantage to long distance communications and to provide disaster relief communications. Optimum frequencies for long distance propagation are time-of-day variant necessitating an operating frequency range of 3 to 30 MHz. HF half wave dipole antenna length varies from 15 to 150 ft over this range. Fixed-length antenna impedance varies with frequency due to physical dimension dependent capacitance and inductance. Maximum transmitter to antenna power transfer occurs when the transmission line and antenna impedances are matched to the standard 50 Ω radio impedance. For transmitter to antenna impedance matching, antenna length can be adjusted depending on frequency. Alternately, an <b>antenna</b> <b>tuner</b> utilizing a variable inductance and capacitance matching network can compensate for the frequency dependent impedance of a fixed-length antenna. A dipole antenna designed for one frequency can function over a broader frequency range with a manually or automatically adjusted <b>antenna</b> <b>tuner.</b> The project objective {{is to develop a}} microcontroller-based automatic tuner for a fixed length dipole antenna. In high frequency transmission lines, an antenna impedance mismatch causes power reflection back to the transmitter. This corresponds to a greater than unity voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR), the ratio of maximum to minimum transmission line voltage amplitude. A directional wattmeter provides forward and reflected power values to an Atmel ATmega 32 microcontroller, which calculates VSWR and adjusts a capacitor - inductor matching network using stepper motors to reduce VSWR to less than 1. 5 : 1 (4 % reflected power relative to incident). The <b>antenna</b> <b>tuner</b> system can match loads of up to 26 : 1 initial VSWR within a frequency range of 3. 5 MHz to 30 MHz. The system was tested using a 100 W transceiver connected to a 90 ft, 450 Ω balanced transmission line and a 120 ft dipole antenna 30 ft above ground. Commercial <b>antenna</b> <b>tuners</b> have VSWR matching capabilities from 3 : 1 to 100 : 1...|$|R
50|$|A {{variable}} capacitor is a capacitor whose capacitance may be intentionally and repeatedly changed mechanically or electronically. Variable capacitors {{are often used}} in L/C circuits to set the resonance frequency, e.g. to tune a radio (therefore it is sometimes called a tuning capacitor or tuning condenser), or as a variable reactance, e.g. for impedance matching in <b>antenna</b> <b>tuners.</b>|$|R
50|$|An <b>antenna</b> <b>tuner,</b> a matchbox, transmatch, {{antenna tuning}} unit (ATU), or antenna coupler is a device {{connected}} between a radio transmitter or receiver and its antenna to improve power transfer between them by matching {{the impedance of}} the radio to the antenna's feedline. Similar matching networks are used in other equipment (such as linear amplifiers) to transform impedance.|$|R

5000|$|An {{impedance}} matching (<b>antenna</b> <b>tuner)</b> circuit {{to match the}} impedance of the transmitter to the impedance of the antenna (or the transmission line to the antenna), to transfer power efficiently to the antenna. If these impedances are not equal, it causes a condition called standing waves, in which the power is reflected back from the antenna toward the transmitter, wasting power and sometimes overheating the transmitter.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{a variety}} of devices used between a source of energy and a load that perform [...] "impedance matching". To match {{electrical}} impedances, engineers use combinations of transformers, resistors, inductors, capacitors and transmission lines. These passive (and active) impedance-matching devices are optimized for different applications and include baluns, <b>antenna</b> <b>tuners</b> (sometimes called ATUs or roller-coasters, because of their appearance), acoustic horns, matching networks, and terminators.|$|R
50|$|Butterfly {{capacitors}} {{are used}} in symmetrical tuned circuits, e.g. RF power amplifier stages in push-pull configuration or symmetrical <b>antenna</b> <b>tuners</b> where the rotor needs to be “cold”, i.e. connected to RF (but not necessarily DC) ground potential. Since the peak RF current normally flows from one stator to the other without going through wiper contacts, butterfly capacitors can handle large resonance RF currents, e.g. in magnetic loop antennas.|$|R
5000|$|A transmatch matches {{transmitter}} impedance to feedline impedance, so {{that signal}} {{power from the}} radio transmitter smoothly transfers into the antenna’s feed cable; a properly adjusted transmatch prevents transmitted power from being reflected back into the transmitter (‘backlash’ current [...] ). Some <b>antenna</b> <b>tuner</b> circuits can both impedance match and preselect, for example the Series Parallel Capacitor (SPC) tuner, and most circuits for balanced line (BLT) tuners can be adjusted to also function as band-pass filters.|$|R
5000|$|The {{challenge}} {{for many years}} has been to devise an antenna which is an efficient radiator, compact, andalso inexpensive.
