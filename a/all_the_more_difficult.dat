5|$|Between his two matches against Janowski, Lasker {{arranged}} another World Chess Championship in January–February 1910 against Carl Schlechter. Schlechter was {{a modest}} gentleman, who was generally unlikely {{to win the}} major chess tournaments by his peaceful inclination, his lack of aggressiveness and his willingness to accept most draw offers from his opponents (about 80% of his games finished by a draw). The conditions of the match against Lasker are still debated among chess historians, but it seems Schlechter accepted to play under very unfavourable conditions, notably that {{he would need to}} finish two points ahead of Lasker to be declared the winner of the match, and he would need to win a revenge match to be declared World Champion. The match was originally meant to consist of 30 games, but when it became obvious that there were insufficient funds (Lasker demanded a fee of 1,000 marks per game played), the number of games was reduced to ten, making the margin of two points <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult.</b>|$|E

The Athenians general Chares {{was already in the}} vicinity with 40 ships, and was sent to support Byzantion; furthermore, Byzantion's other allies, Chios, Rhodes and Kos also sent aid to the city. Since he still did not control the seas, Philip already faced a difficult task to besiege Byzantion, made <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> by the outside support. Again, Philip's engineers set to work, and created a breach; a night assault was then made, but was repulsed. Frustrated in the two sieges, Philip now lost patience with the Athenians, and wrote to them, declaring war. In Athens, Demosthenes proposed that the Athenians should respond by declaring war on Philip; the motion was passed, and the stone tablet recording the peace of Philocrates destroyed. The Athenians prepared another fleet under the command of Phocion, and dispatched it to Byzantion.|$|E

In addition, several activities were undertaken: including the collection of unpublished manuscripts in Arabic and Ajami (manuscripts in African languages written with Arabic alphabet), the compilation of archival inventories and the preparation of a Guide to the Sources of the History of Africa, culled from the archives and libraries of a number of European and Asian countries and later published in nine volumes.|$|R

5|$|Townsend {{subsequently}} then {{reported that}} he was facing a force of at least battalion-strength with support weapons—likely D445 Battalion—while the level of proficiency indicated that it might also include North Vietnamese Army (NVA) elements. However, due to earlier warnings that the Viet Cong were preparing to attack Nui Dat that evening, {{prior to the start}} of the operation Graham had ordered Townsend to return to base that afternoon, and this restriction remained extant. Likewise, with Operation Renmark scheduled to start the following morning, A Company 5 RAR—then at Dat Do protecting the artillery—would also need to be released before nightfall, adding to the requirement to conclude the operation that afternoon. Regardless, this restriction had only served to make B Company's task <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult,</b> with Mackay facing demands to complete the action while at the same time not become decisively engaged and unable to withdraw his company. At 16:17 Townsend was ordered to prepare his battalion for a helicopter extraction which was due to begin an hour later, while at 17:15 he was ordered to break contact immediately, however this proved impossible as 5 Platoon remained in heavy contact. Mackay now estimated that he would be unable to get forward to support the beleaguered platoon for a further 30 minutes; however, by 17:50 he realised that the Viet Cong had moved between them and A Company. Yet even while the Viet Cong continued to heavily engage both A and B Companies, the remainder of the Australian battalion and the APCs were beginning to line up on the landing zone in preparation for returning to Nui Dat. The order was finally rescinded when it became clear that both companies were unable to break-off the engagement. Meanwhile, a number of bush fires were now burning through the area, detonating discarded ammunition and adding to the noise of the battle.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the common}} wisdom that {{lessons learned from}} small {{experimental}} speech recognition tasks often do not scale to larger tasks, many important algorithms used in larger tasks were first developed with small systems applied to small tasks. In this paper we report experiments with the OGI Numbers task {{that led to the}} adoption of a number of engineering decisions for the design of an acoustic front end. We then describe a three-stage process of scaling to the larger conversational telephone speech (CTS) task. Much of the front end design required no change at <b>all</b> for <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> task, yielding significant improvements over our baseline front end. 1. BACKGROUND Small tasks (such as digit or number recognition) are commonly used in the development of novel algorithms. This is true even when larger tasks are the ultimate goal, since the larger tasks can require enormous computational resources for training or recognition, severely limiting the range of possible experiments that can be run. However, {{it is well known that}} huge improvements can sometimes be shown for small tasks that do not carry over to the larger tasks. Sometimes this is simply due to the fact that larger, more complex systems are generally used for the larger tasks, and other mechanisms are already in place to remove many of the grosser errors. Another complicating factor is that diagnostics can be more complete for small tasks, so that specific word or subword confusions can sometimes be focused on and handled; this micro-analysis can seldom be so helpful for large tasks. Finally, when experiments are quick to run, it is often tempting to conduct a large number of experiments with almost random settings, taking the best values as the “learned ” parameters for an approach. Indeed this makes sense for the setting of some parameters given a development test set that has similar character to that of the final evaluation. However, for an ultimate evaluation on a fmorgan, byc, qifeng...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{advances}} {{a simple}} thesis that {{runs counter to}} much public-law scholarship. Holding <b>all</b> else constant, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult,</b> or costly, constitutional rulings are to obtain, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> durable <b>the</b> resulting precedent; conversely, the easier, or cheaper, such rulings are to obtain, the less durable the resulting precedent. Most public-law scholarship implicitly rests on the opposite premise that the relative ease or difficulty of obtaining constitutional rulings should correlate positively, not negatively, with the relative importance or unimportance of the asserted right. Within a public-rights adjudicatory model, important constitutional rights justify relaxing traditional constraints on constitutional decisionmaking, including ripeness, mootness, and, most notably, standing. Conversely, within a private-rights adjudicatory model, judicial rulings, however important, are legitimated {{by the need to}} resolve actual cases or controversies presumptively arising from circumstances beyond the claimant’s control. The public-rights model produces an unintended consequence for those seeking durable constitutional precedent. To the extent that the timing of constitutional litigation is driven by the happenstance of ideological sympathies of deciding jurists, the normative justification for affording the resulting precedent durable status is compromised once those conditions change, favoring the other side. By contrast, the private-rights adjudicatory model makes constitutional precedent more costly to obtain on all sides, thereby enhancing the normative foundation for affording precedent durable status. The analysis holds important implications for several notable bodies of law, including the historical status of Brown v. Board of Education; the stare decisis analysis in the jointly authored plurality opinion in the 1992 decision, Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey; and Supreme Court doctrine concerning agency deference rules...|$|R
40|$|Following the transformations {{through which}} {{national}} economies {{have been going}} through recently, we note {{that there has been}} a change in the type of economic development. Basically, the shift is made from the traditional economy to the "new economy" that focuses on long-term sustainable economic development. This economy pursues human and technological development. In this context, the contribution of the human capital to economic development should be analysed in terms of its qualitative side. Considering that Europe is heading towards a new type of economic development based on the quality of the human factor, the main factors (education, research - development, health, but also labour-related incentives) determining a certain level of quality of the human capital should be subject to analysis. In order to identify and understand the current state of affairs, the trends in the evolution of Romanian economy, in the context of European development strategies, a broad approach perspective is needed, to combine the historical approach with the economic and sociological ones. For Romania, this process is <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> important and <b>difficult</b> to carry out the longer the period of time (the communist period) was, during which the human resource was seen as a production potential, not as a beneficiary of the economic activities.

Restriction set on 22. 05. 2017 by SC, Graduate schoolThis {{thesis is}} an attempt to explore the Jordanian community of today with its multi-ethnic fusion and its social practices that often appear rooted in the past. It is an examination of what possible series of symbols could be formed from a collective view of the diverse ethnicity in Jordan and that could be culturally relevant to the seven-pointed star of the Jordanian flag. This has been an investigation structured around Design Thinking processes using a mixture of qualitative methods integrated with a social science methodology. The qualitative data collection methods involved close contact between the research participants and the author {{in such a way that}} emergent topics could be explored. Accordingly, the first major practical contribution of the research provided a series of prototypes that established ‘terminologies’ that were discovered, evaluated and reflected upon through design processes and supporting documentation. This was followed by a testing stage designed to show the cultural diversity and acceptability of both the symbols/ and the final artefacts. Three main tests were conducted in 2016 : 1. 	Semi-structured interviews with participants selected at random from seven different ethnic groups according to country of origin. 2. 	Public exhibitions in Jordan and Plymouth with audiences from diverse research backgrounds (e. g. users or consumers of designs). 3. A workshop with Jordanian designers (students and practitioners). The methodology adopted during each test included the sharing of the author’s work and personal experiences and invited feedback that could be used to validate and build on the Research Question. The stories and discourse produced a wide array of social patterns that are referred to as ‘findings’. The results emphasised a relationship between social communal values and the historic stories related by the participants. It was hoped that by having the opportunity to involve users throughout the process and by discussing open-ended questions, that the most objective valuations possible would be achieved. However, a deficiency occurred during the process of testing prototypes, which had the effect of decreasing the reliability of the test. It also emerged that correlating <b>all</b> <b>the</b> data proved <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to produce answers as accurately and consistently as possible. Subsequently the author is proposing a number of follow-on design research methodologies, investigating and exploring further the significant values embodied in the Jordanian flag. Namely: Faith in one God Humanity Humility National spirit Virtue Social justice Aspiration Despite these difficulties, however, this research-based activity proved to be an invaluable achievement in terms of personal practice and recorded data as a result of testing the open ended-questions and demonstrated the ability to produce design documentation with its own unique features...|$|R
