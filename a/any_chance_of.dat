5|$|Begun in 1939, {{plans were}} far enough along that tests were {{conducted}} with the main armament and against the underwater protection. Even though the ships were approved for construction under a 1942 fleet replenishment program, the prioritizing of aircraft carriers and smaller ships due to the war, followed by Japan's defeat, killed <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> the B-65's construction.|$|E
5|$|Dortmund {{started off}} their {{campaign}} in the third qualifying of the Champions League round defeating Shakhtar Donetsk 5–1 over two legs. Borussia needed to win their last group game against Liverpool to have <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> {{making it to the}} second group stage, but they lost 2–0 and were eliminated from Group B on goal difference, after finishing on the same points as Boavista.|$|E
5|$|Fresno State {{was able}} to run a 7-play, 72-yard drive to begin the fourth quarter that culminated with a 32-yard field goal by Breshears making the score 29-10. <b>Any</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> a Bulldog {{comeback}} was quashed after Carr threw two interceptions returned for touchdowns to Reed and Hayden Greenbauer, the latter of which came with just 1:14 to play. The final score was 43-10, the Mustangs victorious.|$|E
50|$|In 2017, Kidd {{retired from}} wrestling due to injures ending <b>any</b> <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> Kidd and Cesaro teaming again.|$|R

5|$|In the June 1977, Wark was {{selected}} for the Scotland squad for the first time, for a friendly match against East Germany; however, a torn hamstring sustained in pre-season training ended <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> an international debut. The injury also {{kept him out of}} first-team football until January 1978, when he returned for a match against Cardiff City in the third round of the 1977–78 FA Cup.|$|E
5|$|The royalists rose in May 1648, igniting the Second Civil War, and {{as agreed}} with Charles, the Scots invaded England. Uprisings in Kent, Essex, and Cumberland, and a {{rebellion}} in South Wales, were put {{down by the}} New Model Army, and with {{the defeat of the}} Scots at the Battle of Preston in August 1648, the royalists lost <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> winning the war.|$|E
5|$|Their {{opponents in}} the second round were English team Ipswich Town. The first leg, at Ipswich's home ground Portman Road, was won 3–0 by the English team. Brugge needed to score at least three goals to have <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> staying in the competition. They won the second leg 4–0, to win the tie 4–3 on {{aggregate}} and progress to the third round.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I'll {{see that}} that duffer holds his tongue!" [...] and Bill {{started toward the}} would-be detective in a {{threatening}} manner; but the latter was not minded to take <b>any</b> <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> an encounter.|$|R
50|$|Cornforth was {{eligible}} {{to play for}} the Wales national football team due to his paternal grandmother, who was from Llantrisant. He gained two caps before a cruciate ligament injury hampered <b>any</b> <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> further caps.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's quite evident {{they had}} too much trouble getting him to take <b>any</b> <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> losing him," [...] he said. [...] "I wish the fellow would turn his head. I fancy I should know him." ...|$|R
5|$|A {{modus vivendi}} had been {{achieved}} between Warwick {{and the king}} for some months, but the restoration of Henry Percy to Montagu's earldom of Northumberland prevented <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> full reconciliation. A trap was set for the king when disturbances in Lincolnshire led him north, where he could be confronted by Warwick's men. Edward, however, discovered the plot when Robert, Lord Welles, was routed at Losecote Field, and gave away the plan.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 2000s, their {{population}} was feared to have declined {{past the point}} of recovery in Vietnam, with some conservationists estimating as few as three to eight rhinos, and possibly no males, survived. Conservationists debated whether or not the Vietnamese rhinoceros had <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> survival, with some arguing that rhinos from Indonesia should be introduced in an attempt to save the population, with others arguing that the population could recover.|$|E
5|$|In March 2015, Bruce {{signed a}} three-year {{contract}} extension. A run of poor form left Hull {{near the bottom of}} the table going into the final game of the 2014–15 season and needing to defeat Bruce's former club Manchester United to stand <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> avoiding relegation. They could only manage a 0–0 draw and were relegated to the Championship. The poor performances of a number of players signed by Bruce, including club record signing Abel Hernández, were identified as key factors in the club's failure to remain in the Premier League.|$|E

50|$|Functional {{programs}} do not have assignment statements, that is, {{the value of a}} variable in a functional program never changes once defined. This eliminates <b>any</b> <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> side effects because any variable can be replaced with its actual value at any point of execution. So, functional programs are referentially transparent.|$|R
5|$|On 12 July 1943, the Soviets {{launched}} their own counter-offensives, thereby dispelling <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> German victory or even stalemate in the east. The Soviet victory at Kursk {{marked the end}} of German superiority, giving the Soviet Union the initiative on the Eastern Front. The Germans tried to stabilise their eastern front along the hastily fortified Panther–Wotan line, but the Soviets broke through it at Smolensk and by the Lower Dnieper Offensives.|$|E
5|$|Seventh-century Muslim armies had no siege equipment, and {{typically}} employed siege tactics {{only when there}} were no other options. Without the necessary siege equipment, armies of the early Muslim expansion would surround a city, denying it supplies until the city's defenders surrendered. Meanwhile <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> breaking into the city would be availed, if possible, using stealth and espionage. Muslim armies would usually isolate the city {{from the rest of the}} region and deploy scouts along vital routes.|$|E
5|$|The Burgess Shale {{animals were}} {{probably}} killed {{by changes in}} their environment either immediately preceding or during the mud-slides that buried them. Proposed killing mechanisms include: changes in salinity; poisoning by chemicals such as hydrogen sulfide or methane; changes in the availability of oxygen; and changing consistency of the sea floor. The death event was not necessarily related to the burial, and {{there may have been}} multiple death events between burial events; but only organisms killed immediately before a burial event would stand <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> being fossilised, instead of rotting or being eaten.|$|E
50|$|However, in opposition, {{this result}} {{reinforced}} the moderate government ruling the country: the Socialist Party of Prime Minister Bettino Craxi had maintained its vote, and its major ally, the defeated Christian Democracy, {{did not want}} to take <b>any</b> <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> a political crisis that could lead to dangerous general election.|$|R
6000|$|Flinging {{the blanket}} {{over her and}} {{smoothing}} it carefully, I tossed the light saddle to her back and cinched it tight, so tight that she grunted. [...] "I can't take <b>any</b> <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> a spill," [...] I explained to her, and she accepted the bit willingly. She was always ready for action and fully dependable.|$|R
50|$|At {{the close}} of his junior season, Motley {{declared}} his eligibility for the 2017 NBA draft but did not hire an agent, leaving open the option to return to college. He would later hire an agent before signing up for the 2017 NBA Draft Combine, thus ending <b>any</b> <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> returning for his senior year at Baylor.|$|R
5|$|The TsKB-17 design bureau {{proposed}} {{variants of}} the design with both cruise and ballistic missiles. The ballistic missiles would have been launched from vertical tubes replacing the forward turrets, and in one version, the entire main armament. The proposal was dropped because both types would have needed a fully stabilized launching platform to give them <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> hitting their targets and that the ballistic missiles would need three hours of preparation time.|$|E
5|$|With his win, Michael Schumacher reduced Häkkinen's {{advantage}} in the Drivers' Championship to just two points. Coulthard remained in third with 61 points. Barrichello's retirement at the Grand Prix ruled out <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> him claiming the title and Ralf Schumacher retained fifth place with 24 points. In the Constructors' Championship, Ferrari's victory allowed them to reduce McLaren's lead to four points. Williams remained in third place with 34 points. Benetton increased the gap over Jordan in fifth place to a seven-point advantage, with three races of the season remaining.|$|E
5|$|Albert Bouchard {{had been}} {{completely}} excluded from the retooling of the album for contractual reasons, but hoped to have his long work rewarded with a credit as co-producer, and to be paid accordingly. After the disbandment of Blue Öyster Cult, he contacted the other band members {{in an attempt to}} organize a 1987 reunion tour, with the original line-up, to promote Imaginos. His economic and membership requests were both rejected, due to resistances within the label and within the band, so he filed a lawsuit in 1989 against the management of Blue Öyster Cult and Columbia Records to receive payment for his work. The lawsuit was settled out of court, but his resentment towards Sandy Pearlman for what he felt was a theft of his work never eased, eliminating <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> future collaborations for the completion of the Imaginos saga.|$|E
50|$|However, {{the signing}} of Joel Piñeiro diminished <b>any</b> <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> Palmer in the {{starting}} rotation, and {{he returned to the}} bullpen for the 2010 season. In 3 seasons in the Angels organization, Palmer pitched in 57 games (17 as starter) with a 4.22 ERA and 13-5 record. He also spent substantial time with the AAA Salt Lake Bees.|$|R
50|$|<b>Any</b> <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> {{remaining}} {{a cabinet}} minister vanished in February 1937 {{when one of}} his love affairs went sour, and a 32-year-old teacher threw acid at him, scarring his handsome face and impairing the sight in his left eye. The scandal did not hurt him locally, and he was re-elected in the October 1937 election, but not re-appointed to cabinet.|$|R
5000|$|Live, {{the band}} {{featured}} Jason Bieler on guitar (Saigon Kick), Jakob [...] "Jake Samuel" [...] Samuelsson on drums and Thomas Vikström (Talk of the town, Candlemass) on keyboards and backing vocals. Talisman {{were one of}} the top ten drawing acts in Sweden in the summer. Unfortunately, the label went bust - ending <b>any</b> <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> international exposure for the album.|$|R
5|$|Along {{with the}} renewal {{of the civil war}} in 1352, these factors {{destroyed}} <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> even a modest recovery similar to that experienced under Andronikos III. Thereafter, Byzantium remained under the menacing threat of stronger neighbours, unable to pursue an independent foreign policy, handicapped by a shortage of resources and riven by internal strife. Nevertheless, through a combination of fortuitous external circumstances and adroit diplomacy, it survived for another century, until finally conquered by the Ottomans in 1453. Only the Byzantine exclave in the Morea remained prosperous, having been spared the ravages of the civil war because of its relative isolation. The appointment of Manuel Kantakouzenos as its despotes in 1349 heralded the creation of the semi-independent Despotate of the Morea, which experienced the last economic and cultural flowering of the Byzantine world before it too fell to the Ottomans in 1460.|$|E
5|$|Despite the boasting of Mussolini and {{the fury}} of Churchill, the loss of Tug Argan and {{consequently}} Somaliland was not of the greatest strategic importance. Certainly it was a blow to British prestige and pride, but Somaliland was one of Britain's lesser regions of value and could be affordably lost. In fact, Britain incurred monetary gains after being relieved of the necessity to station an expensive garrison there. But the impact could have been far greater if the Italians had managed to move faster after the battle. Heavy rains and difficulties supplying the troops damaged these efforts, as well as removed <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> a sizable strategic victory.|$|E
5|$|Diệm {{had long}} distrusted his generals and {{frequently}} played them {{against each other}} in a divide and conquer strategy to weaken <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> a coup attempt. The army also contained substantial numbers of soldiers of Buddhist backgrounds, thus heightening skepticism that they would have attacked the pagodas and monks in such a violent manner. The synchronized military operations throughout the country, the speed at which banners were erected declaring the ARVN resolve to defeat communism, and doctored propaganda photos purporting to show Việt Cộng infiltration of the Buddhists suggested that the actions were long premeditated. In an attempt to maintain secrecy, special printing presses had produced propaganda materials only hours before the raids.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} {{the fifth}} day, the Australian bowlers, Bill Johnston and Ian Johnson showed that they could exploit the {{conditions}} just as well, reducing the Indians to seven down; but with a lead of 142, which was a high target on this wicket, the match seemed set for a thrilling finish. However, rain on the final day dispelled <b>any</b> <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> play.|$|R
