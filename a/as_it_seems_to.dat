5|$|In the Life of Probus, {{the author}} 'Flavius Vopiscus of Syracuse' {{states that the}} Emperor's {{descendants}} (posteri) fled from Rome and settled near Verona. There a statue of Probus was struck by lightning, a portent according to soothsayers 'that future generations of the family would rise to such distinction in the senate they all would hold the highest posts', though Vopiscus (supposedly writing under Constantine) says this prophecy has not yet come to pass. This {{is one of the}} strongest indications of the History's late 4th-century date, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be a fairly transparent allusion to the rich and powerful senator Sextus Claudius Petronius Probus (consul in 371) whose two sons held the consulship together in 395. Petronius Probus was born in Verona.|$|E
5|$|This is not {{the place}} to pass judgements, but perhaps I may say that, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> me, both the monks and Tischendorf deserve our deepest gratitude, Tischendorf for having alerted the monks to the {{importance}} of the manuscript, and the monks for having undertaken the daunting task of searching through the vast mass of material with such spectacular results, and then doing everything in their power to safeguard the manuscript against further loss. If we accept the statement of Uspensky, that he saw the codex in 1845, the monks must have worked very hard to complete their search and bind up the results in so short a period.|$|E
5|$|Amazing {{began as}} a bedsheet format {{magazine}} and remained so until October 1933, when it switched to pulp size. With the April–May 1953 issue Amazing became a digest. Seven issues in the early 1980s, from November 1980 to November 1981, were a half-inch taller than the regular digest size, but thereafter the magazine reverted to the standard digest format. In May 1991 the magazine returned to a large format, but this lasted only until the Winter 1994 issue, and the next three issues were digest-sized again. When the magazine reappeared in 1998, it was in bedsheet format and remained that size until the very end. The last issue, March 2005, was distributed only as a PDF download, never as a physical magazine. The volume numbering contained some irregularities: the numbering given in the tables above {{appears to be in}} error for the period from 1979 to 1983, but in fact it is given correctly in the table. Note also that vol. 27 no. 8 was a single issue, not two, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be from the table; it was dated Dec 1953/Jan 1954.|$|E

25|$|The {{purpose of}} {{multiple}} handle arrangements is {{depending on the}} bit, control is easier with different configurations. For example, when shaping {{the edge of a}} fine table top, many users prefer a D handle, with variable speed, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> permit better control and burning the wood can be minimized.|$|E
25|$|Eunuchs were {{familiar}} {{figures in the}} Assyrian Empire (ca. 850 until 622 BC) and {{in the court of}} the Egyptian Pharaohs (down to the Lagid dynasty known as Ptolemies, ending with Cleopatra),(30 BC). Eunuchs sometimes were used as regents for underage heirs to the throne, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be the case for the Neo-Hittite state of Carchemish.|$|E

25|$|The {{house of}} representatives can not only refuse, but they alone can propose the {{supplies}} requisite {{for the support of}} government. They in a word hold the purse; that powerful instrument by which we behold, {{in the history of the}} British constitution, an infant and humble representation of the people, gradually enlarging the sphere of its activity and importance, and finally reducing, as far <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have wished, all the overgrown prerogatives of the other branches of the government. This power over the purse, may in fact be regarded as the most compleat and effectual weapon with which any constitution can arm the immediate representatives of the people, for obtaining a redress of every grievance, and for carrying into effect every just and salutary measure.|$|E
25|$|Dennett's {{thesis is}} that our modern {{understanding}} of consciousness is unduly influenced by the ideas of René Descartes. To show why, he starts {{with a description of}} the phi illusion. In this experiment, two different coloured lights, with an angular separation of a few degrees at the eye, are flashed in succession. If the interval between the flashes is less than a second or so, the first light that is flashed appears to move across to the position of the second light. Furthermore, the light seems to change colour as it moves across the visual field. A green light will appear to turn red <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> move across to the position of a red light. Dennett asks how we could see the light change colour before the second light is observed.|$|E
500|$|The design {{attracted}} {{comments from}} {{those interested in}} coins. Frank Duffield, editor of the ANA's journal The Numismatist, noted in the October 1936 issue that the coin had been awaited with anticipation by hobbyists because of an announcement that it would bear the likeness of Foster, but [...] "when it finally appeared many expressions of approval of the designs were heard and a few criticisms... Foster deserved a better bust than the one the artist has given us...the toy four-string lyre [...] holds in her hand is not {{in keeping with the}} times or the occasion... After all these years, Music deserved something better." [...] Coin dealer B. Max Mehl, in his monograph on commemorative coins published in 1937, agreed with the criticism of the reverse, [...] "apparently this lyre must have been bought at a 5¢ and 10¢ store <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be only a toy".|$|E

500|$|... 'Parthian frontality', {{as we are}} now {{accustomed}} to call it, deeply differs both from ancient Near Eastern and from Greek frontality, though it is, no doubt, an offspring of the latter. For both in Oriental art and in Greek art, frontality was an exceptional treatment: in Oriental art it was a treatment strictly reserved for {{a small number of}} traditional characters of cult and myth; in Greek art it was an option resorted to only for definite reasons, when demanded by the subject, and, on the whole, seldom made use of. With Parthian art, on the contrary, frontality becomes the normal treatment of the figure. For the Parthians frontality is really nothing but the habit of showing, in relief and in painting, all figures full-face, even at the expense (<b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> us moderns) of clearness and intelligibility. So systematic is this use that it amounts to a complete banishment de facto of the side-view and of all intermediate attitudes. This singular state of things seems to have become established {{in the course of the}} 1st century A.D.|$|E
2500|$|Central to Steiner's thinking, he has stated, [...] "is my astonishment, naïve <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> people, {{that you}} can use human speech both to love, to build, to forgive, and also to torture, to hate, to destroy and to annihilate." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, it {{has been}} said that the Singapore {{judiciary}} has a conservative attitude when interpreting the Constitution <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be [...] "more protective of executive interests than individual freedoms". This is in line with the locally held judicial philosophy which features deference to the Parliament and a strong presumption of constitutional validity.|$|E

2500|$|The {{idea that}} God chose the Jewish people for any purpose, in any way, is [...] "morally untenable", because {{anyone who has}} such beliefs [...] "implies {{the superiority of the}} elect {{community}} and the rejection of others". [...] This puts Reconstructionist Jews at odds with all other Jews, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> accuse all other Jews of being racist. Jews outside of the Reconstructionist movement strenuously reject this charge.|$|E
2500|$|The famous Odunke festival {{which served}} as {{inspiration}} and name giver to a talented group of Biafran artists, including Chinua Achebe and Christopher Okigbo (Odunke community of Artists), [...] is worthy of special mention <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be peculiar to Awka-Etiti. It {{is one of the}} festivals that had no religious basis. It was rather a carnival with grand ceremony, feasting, as well as a display of material wealth, opulence and social status incorporating all the arts of the community in a harmonious relationship. The Odunke was last performed in 1955.|$|E
2500|$|In September 1915, Love, {{referred}} to as [...] "the 'Eiffel tower' slabster of the Los Angeles club", was drafted by the New York Yankees in exchange for $2,300 ($ in current dollar terms). [...] At the time, Sporting Life reported that the Yankees had [...] "obtained the tallest pitcher in captivity" [...] at six feet {{seven and a half}} inches tall. [...] When Love returned his signed contract to the Yankees, Sporting Life opined that his addition [...] "will {{go a long way toward}} putting New York on the map" [...] and made mention of his [...] "special ball, known as the aeroplane bomb, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> descend to the batter from somewhere in the celestial region." ...|$|E

2500|$|Research is {{beginning}} to determine the causes of CCD, {{with the weight of}} evidence leaning towards CCD being a syndrome rather than a disease, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be caused by a combination of various contributing factors rather than a single pathogen or poison. However, in April 2013, after [...] by the European Food Safety Authority identifying the significant risks of the class of pesticides called neonicotinoids, the European Union called for a two-year restriction on neonicotinoid pesticides. In 2015, an 11-year British study showed a definitive relationship between increasing agricultural use of neonicotinoid and escalating honey bee colony losses at a landscape level. This is the first field study to establish a link between neonicotinoids and CCD.|$|E
2500|$|The {{theory of}} Forms (or theory of Ideas) {{typically}} {{refers to the}} belief that the material world <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> us is not the real world, but only an [...] "image" [...] or [...] "copy" [...] of the real world. In some of Plato's dialogues, this is expressed by Socrates, who spoke of forms in formulating {{a solution to the problem}} of universals. The forms, according to Socrates, are archetypes or abstract representations of the many types of things, and properties we feel and see around us, that can only be perceived by reason (...) [...] (That is, they are universals.) In other words, Socrates was able to recognize two worlds: the apparent world, which constantly changes, and an unchanging and unseen world of forms, which may be the cause of what is apparent.|$|E
2500|$|The {{importance}} of the seal {{as a means of}} authentication necessitated that when authority passed into new hands the old seal should be destroyed and a new one made. When the pope dies it is the first duty of the Cardinal Camerlengo to obtain possession of the Ring of the Fisherman, the papal signet, and to see that it is broken up. A similar practice prevailed in the Middle Ages and it is often alluded to by historians, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have been a matter of some ceremony. For example, on the death of Robert of Holy Island, Bishop of Durham, in 1283, the chronicler Robert Greystones reports: [...] "After his burial, his seal was publicly broken up in the presence of all by Master Robert Avenel." [...] Matthew Paris gives a similar description of the breaking of the seal of William of Trumpington, Abbot of St Albans, in 1235.|$|E
