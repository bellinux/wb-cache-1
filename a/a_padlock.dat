25|$|Mystery/puzzle caches require one to {{discover}} information or solve a puzzle {{to find the}} cache. Some mystery caches provide a false set of coordinates with a puzzle that must be solved to determine the final cache location. In other cases, the given location is accurate, but {{the name of the}} location or other features are themselves a puzzle leading to the final cache. Alternatively, additional information is necessary to complete the find, such as <b>a</b> <b>padlock</b> combination to access the cache. Finally, Challenge Caches, (a subtype of the Mystery cache) require a geocacher to complete a reasonably attainable geocaching-related task before being able to log the find. Examples include finding a number of caches that meet a category, completing a number of cache finds within a period of time, or finding a cache for every calendar day, etc.|$|E
25|$|At first, Android {{did not use}} a gesture-based lock screen, electing to just {{require the}} user to press the phone's Menu button. On Android 2.0, a new gesture-based lock screen was introduced, {{displaying}} two icons: one for unlocking the phone, and one for setting the volume mode, activated by dragging the relevant icon {{to the center of}} the screen on a curve (similarly to a rotary dial). On Android 2.1, the rotary dial was replaced by two tabs on either end of the screen. Android 3.0 introduced a new design: a ball with <b>a</b> <b>padlock</b> icon is dragged to the outside of a circular area. On 4.0, the option to unlock straight to the camera is provided, while 4.1 adds the ability to unlock into a Google Search screen by dragging up. Android 4.2 makes additional changes to the lock screen, allowing users to add widgets to pages accessible on the lock screen by swiping from the left edge of the screen. The camera is accessed in a similar manner by swiping from the right edge of the screen. Android also allows devices to be locked using a password, passcode, a pattern on a grid of 9 circles, fingerprint sensing, or with facial recognition.|$|E

500|$|During {{his first}} years in WWE, Cena portrayed a vastly {{different}} character. This character, a white rapper who wore jerseys, backwards hats, and a chain with <b>a</b> <b>padlock</b> around his neck, {{was known as}} the [...] "Doctor of Thuganomics". Cena sometimes used underhanded tactics to score victories, such as using his chain as a weapon behind the referee's back. Cena often rapped before his matches, insulting his opponents, events that happened in the media, and even the crowd on occasion. Cena also regularly performed [...] "rap battles", where he and his opponent took turns rapping on each other. Cena reverted to this persona once during his feud with The Rock. In 2005, shortly after his first debut film, The Marine, his wrestling character was shifted from a white rapper to that of a young private.|$|E
500|$|At 19:40, {{the whole}} prison {{compound}} erupted into small arms fire when Murphy {{and his men}} fired on the guard towers and barracks. Within the first fifteenseconds, all of the camp's guard towers and pillboxes were targeted and destroyed. Sgt. Ted Richardson rushed to shoot <b>a</b> <b>padlock</b> off of the main gate using his [...]45 pistol. The Rangers at the main gate maneuvered to bring the guard barracks and officer quarters under fire, while the ones at the rear eliminated the enemy near the prisoners' huts and then proceeded with the evacuation. A bazooka team from F Company ran up the main road to a tin shack which the Scouts had told Mucci held tanks. Although Japanese soldiers attempted to escape with twotrucks, the team was able to destroy the trucks and then the shack.|$|E
500|$|Mennekes:On {{the right}} hand {{side of the car}} is the “fast” and “slow” AC {{charging}} point, accessed in a similar way to the DC charge point. This is a five pin [...] point. Three large pins are the line, neutral and earth/ground. The two small pins are a control circuit. This circuit enables the charge current to be cut off when charging is complete, cuts off power if the plug is removed from the vehicle (the plug and socket are both unshuttered), prevents both rapid and fast charging being done simultaneously and also prevents the vehicle from being driven while the plug is inserted. For “fast charging”, the control box (mounted at the roadside) is limited to 20 amps enabling a charge time (from depletion) of four hours. For “slow charging”, [...] a non-captive lead/cord is provided with the car. It is intended for use in the home or other domestic places. This has a local plug at one end and a Mennekes connector at the other. [...] The Mennekes plug has a retaining trigger with a hole for <b>a</b> <b>padlock</b> to prevent the plug from being removed from the car if deemed necessary. There is a “floating” [...] control box {{in the middle of this}} lead/cord that functions similarly to the fast charger but limits current to 10 amps so enabling an eight-hour charge time (from complete depletion on 230 volts) ...|$|E

Papageno happily takes the credit – claiming he strangled it with his bare hands. The three ladies suddenly reappear and instead of giving him wine, cake and figs, they give him water, a stone and place <b>a</b> <b>padlock</b> over his mouth as a warning not to lie.

2500|$|The Wranglers are {{the only}} team to hold a game that was played at midnight.

Their 2011/12 home opener was a promotion for [...] "Rapture Day", as this game coincided with the Rapture prediction of Oakland radio host Harold Camping, and on New Years Day, to parody how the 2012 NHL lockout forced the NHL Winter Classic to be cancelled that year, the Wranglers held an [...] "Indoor Winter Classic", that even gave a trophy with a chain and <b>a</b> <b>padlock.</b>|$|E
2500|$|William Taylor QC, {{leading the}} defence, {{said at the}} appeal's opening on 23 January 2002 that the three trial judges sitting without a jury had failed to see the {{relevance}} of [...] "significant" [...] evidence and had accepted unreliable facts. He argued that the verdict was not one that a reasonable jury in an ordinary trial could have reached if it were given proper directions by the judge. The grounds of the appeal rested on two areas of evidence where the defence claimed the original court was mistaken: the evidence of Maltese shopkeeper, Tony Gauci, which the judges accepted as sufficient {{to prove that the}} [...] "primary suitcase" [...] started its journey in Malta; and, disputing the prosecution's case, fresh evidence would be adduced to show that the bomb's journey actually started at Heathrow. That evidence, which was not heard at the trial, showed that at some time in the two hours before 00:35 on 21 December 1988 <b>a</b> <b>padlock</b> had been forced on a secure door giving access air side in Terminal 3 of Heathrow airport, near to the area referred to at the trial as the [...] "baggage build-up area".
