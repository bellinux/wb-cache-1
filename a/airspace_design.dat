40|$|Air {{traffic demand}} is growing. New methods of <b>airspace</b> <b>design</b> are {{required}} that can enable new designs, do {{not depend on}} current operations, and can also support quantifiable performance goals. The main goal of this thesis is to develop methods to model inherent safety and control cost so that these can be included as principal objectives of <b>airspace</b> <b>design,</b> in support of prior work which examines capacity. The first contribution of the thesis is to demonstrate two applications of airspace analysis and design: assessing the inherent safety and control cost of the airspace. Two results are shown, a model which estimates control cost depending on autonomy allocation and traffic volume, and the characterization of inherent safety conditions which prevent unsafe trajectories. The effects of autonomy ratio and traffic volume on control cost emerge from a Monte Carlo simulation of air traffic in an airspace sector. A maximum likelihood estimation identifies the Poisson process {{to be the best}} stochastic model for control cost. Recommendations are made to support control-cost-centered <b>airspace</b> <b>design.</b> A novel method to reliably generate collision avoidance advisories, in piloted simulations, by the widely-used Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) is used to construct unsafe trajectory clusters. Results show that the inherent safety of routes can be characterized, determined, and predicted by relatively simple convex polyhedra (albeit multi-dimensional and involving spatial and kinematic information). Results also provide direct trade-off relations between spatial and kinematic constraints on route geometries that preserve safety. Accounting for these clusters thus supports safety-centered <b>airspace</b> <b>design.</b> The second contribution of the thesis is a general methodology that generalizes unifying principles from these two demonstrations. The proposed methodology has three steps: aggregate data, synthesize lean model, and guide design. The use of lean models is a result of a natural flowdown from the airspace view to the requirements. The scope of the lean model is situated at a level of granularity that identifies the macroscopic effects of operational changes on the strategic level. The lean model technique maps low-level changes to high-level properties and provides predictive results. The use of lean models allows the mapping of design variables (route geometry, autonomy allocation) to design evaluation metrics (inherent safety, control cost). Ph. D...|$|E

The study evaluated the benefits and feasibility of flexible airspace reconfiguration in response to traffic overload caused by weather deviations, and compared them to those in a baseline condition without the airspace reconfiguration. The test airspace consisted of either four sectors in one Area of Specialization or seven sectors across two Areas.

Despite numerous studies from the FAA and EASA, none of them decided on a regulation for UASs. The reliability of the flight {{is considered to be}} one of the main obstacles for UAVs integration. This is not an easy topic considering the unknowns of the systems, environment and possible failures. We believe the flexibility required for such solutions calls for open architectures. More specifically, this paper shows how the use of the Paparazzi open source auto-pilot system can ease the integration of low altitude UAS. To ensure safety, this integration needs to be achieved through airspace management and UAS reliability. Preliminary <b>airspace</b> <b>designs,</b> e. g. Amazon's, identify different zones depending on the UAS capabilities, population density and altitude. Plus, national rules evolution push to cope with a variety of requirements. Open source and modular architectures are key to adapt to these requirements.

Concerning reliability, current regulations focus on flight constraints but might be expected to involve regulations on software and hardware components as well. In such case, the increased cost will be inevitable for the demands of certification. In the Paparazzi software case, parts of the code have been formally proved and stable versions have thousands of flight hours.

40|$|Future {{air traffic}} {{management}} (ATM) systems are expected to handle the increasingly heavy demand on air traffic, especially in the highly constrained terminal manoeuvring area (TMA). However, the realizable capacity of current TMA is a challenge for future air transportation development. This {{is due to the}} limitations in accommodating safe and efficient travel under the highly limited airspace configuration strategies and pre-defined terminal trajectories. Therefore, making the TMA resources flexible and available corresponding to different traffic scenarios is the key to enhance the practical ATM efficiency in future TMAs. Improving the TMA airspace configuration to balance capacity and demand is a challenging task, since a TMA system inherently involves high uncertainties and multiple interactions among many different components. The inherent complexity of the TMA necessitates a system-level analysis approach, in which each component is investigated through modelling the complex interactions among other parts of the environment in which it operates. Hence, the process of understanding (through modelling), evaluating and dynamically designing TMA airspace configurations, while considering dynamic constrained ground resources, is becoming crucial for enhancing the practical ATM efficiency in future TMAs.

Taking a more analytic approach, this thesis proposes that airspace complexity {{can be described in}} terms of how the airspace (together with the traffic inside it and the traffic control algorithm) responds to disturbances. The response of the airspace to a disturbance is captured by the degree of control activity required to accommodate such disturbance. Furthermore, since the response of the airspace depends on the disturbance, this thesis introduces a complexity map which shows how an airspace responses to a set of different disturbances. Among the many possible types of disturbances, this thesis considers an aircraft entering into the airspace, and the proposed method of describing airspace complexity is illustrated with examples. The time evolution of a complexity map is investigated using a statistical approach.
