5000|$|Rogers' {{reputation}} {{among the}} British birding community was {{of someone who}} took {{the scientific study of}} birds extremely seriously, and believed that [...] "serious" [...] ornithology should take precedence over [...] "popular" [...] approaches at all times. As an illustration, following the publication in British Birds magazine of an account by Robin Chittenden of the finding of a northern parula on the Isles of Scilly in October 1983 (Chittenden 1986), in which Chittenden wrote effusively about his excitement at this find, which was then only the fourth record for Britain, Rogers wrote to the British Birds letters page criticising both Chittenden for <b>an</b> <b>article</b> <b>consisting</b> <b>of</b> [...] "60 lines full of irrelevances", and the journal's editors for [...] "letting editorial standards slip ... perhaps in an attempt to widen journal's circulation" [...] (Rogers 1987). Providing information and encouragement to casual birding visitors to Portland Bill was low on Rogers' list of priorities compared with the day-to-day running of the observatory; as a result, many birders visiting Portland for the first time felt that they were not welcome there.|$|E
40|$|To many, {{although}} {{certainly not}} all, of us {{working in the}} history and philosophy of science in the mid- 1990 s Alan Sokal is a hero. Inspired by the book, Higher Superstition: The Academic Left and its Quarrels with Science, by Paul Gross and Norman Levitt (1994), Sokal tried an experiment. He asked, ‘‘Would the leading North American journal of cultural studies—whose editorial collective includes such luminaries as Fredric Jameson and Andrew Ross—publish <b>an</b> <b>article</b> <b>consisting</b> <b>of</b> utter nonsense if (a) it sounded good and (b) it flattered the editors ’ ideological preconceptions? The answer is unfortunately yes (Sokal 2010, p. 115). ’ ’ Sokal’s essay, ‘‘Transgrssing the Boundaries: Toward a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity,’ ’ is, I believe, unreadable, at least {{to those of us}} who try to make sense of what we are reading. As Sokal writes, ‘‘My article is a mélange of truths, half-truths, quarter-truths, falsehoods, non sequiturs, and syntactically correct sentences that have no meaning (p. 93). ’ ’ 1 The article was published in a special issue devoted to the ‘‘Science Wars’ ’ of Social Text (1996, Volumes 46 – 47), the aforementioned leading cultural studies journal, 2 without the benefit of refereeing by anyone who knew something about quantum gravity. The hoax was revealed some weeks later in another journal, Lingu...|$|E
60|$|We {{have already}} remarked (and the very example {{out of which}} the {{difficulty}} arose presupposes it) that the cost <b>of</b> production <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>article</b> <b>consists</b> generally <b>of</b> two parts,--the wages of the labour employed, and the profits of those who, in any antecedent stage of the production, have advanced any portion of those wages. An article, therefore, may be the produce of the same quantity of labour as before, and yet, if any portion of the profits which the last producer has to make good to previous producers can be economized, the cost of production of the article is diminished.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} identifying on the Web compound documents (cDocs) – groups of web pages that in aggregate constitute semantically coherent information entities. Examples of cDocs are <b>a</b> news <b>article</b> <b>consisting</b> <b>of</b> several html pages, or a set of pages describing specifications, price, and reviews of a digital camera. Being able to identify cDocs would be useful in many applications including web and intranet search, user navigation, automated collection generation, and information extraction. In the past, several heuristic approaches have been proposed to identify cDocs [1][5]. However, heuristics fail to capture the variety of types, styles and goals {{of information on the}} web, and do not account {{for the fact that the}} definition of a cDoc often depends on the context. This paper presents an experimental evaluation of three machine learning-based algorithms for cDoc discovery. These algorithms are responsive to the varying structure of cDocs and adaptive to their application-specific nature. Based on our previous work [4], this paper proposes a different scenario for discovering cDocs, and compares in this new setting the local machine learned clustering algorithm from [4] to a global purely graph based approach [3] and a Conditional Markov Network approach previously applied to noun coreference task [6]. The results show that the approach of [4] outperforms the other algorithms, suggesting that global relational characteristics of web sites are too noisy for cDoc identification purposes...|$|R

40|$|The {{article focuses}} {{on the topic of}} {{correlation}} between a word and a gesture in standard and the most frequent constructions with negation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> predicate. The <b>article</b> <b>consists</b> <b>of</b> two parts. The first part discusses negative constructions “ne [not] + predicate” and analyzes consistent patterns typical for choosing negative gestures. The second part describes constructions with deep negation, i. e. contexts without a negative construction on the surface, but accompanied with negative gestures. The research has been conducted using the Multimodal Russian Corpus (MURCO). The research procedure is based on defining linguistic features in negative constructions and constructions with deep negation: a) semantics of lexical units related to gestural negation, b) syntactic structures, c) morphological components d) rhythmic features. Thus we assign every sample from the gestural database with a number of its linguistic characteristics in an utterance accompanying the gestures or the lack of such. With the help of statistical parameters, we determine which linguistic characteristics are essential for the presence or the lack of gestural negation and its quality (the body organ that performs it), and interpret all the statistical consistencies. </p...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} {{to what extent}} Russia's increasing reliance on foreign capital could potentially kick-start the economy and generate growth. The analysis highlights more fundamental issues of governance and institutional arrangements, for which the focus on foreign economic activities serves merely as an example to reflect on pathologies of the Russian economy as <b>a</b> whole. The <b>article</b> <b>consists</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> theoretical framework, discussing the change of institutional arrangements {{in the first section}} and analysing crucial issues of corporate governance and property rights in the last, while empirical information is compiled for Russia as a whole and its constituent regions {{in the second and third}} core sections. The article concludes that the Russian map of high foreign trade activities will be shaped only by patchy growth spots, located either where the domestic market is largest or opportunities for export exist, mainly in large urban agglomerations (economies of scale) and commercial hubs, resource-rich and gateway territories (gravitation to international trading blocs). Major investment disincentives will remain as long as the existing system of taxation has not been substantially changed, property rights are not protected, land and bankruptcy legislation is not properly enforced and local authorities are not prevented form rent-seeking activities.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} experiments {{performed in}} an altitude chamber at the National Research Council of Canada (NRC) {{as the first}} step towards developing altitude scaling laws and procedures that will possibly allow aero-engines to be certified for operation in ice crystal clouds at high altitude by testing in sea level facilities. The principal objective was to test the hypothesis that accretion within a compressor due to ice crystal ingestion occurs when the local ratio of freestream liquid water content (LWC) to total water content (TWC) lies within a critical range at an accretion-susceptible location. If this hypothesis is correct, the local LWC/TWC ratio is the key parameter that must be matched in tests at low and high pressures to match accretions. Experiments were conducted in a small wind tunnel with <b>an</b> axisymmetric test <b>article,</b> <b>consisting</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hemispherical nose attached to a conical afterbody, at a fixed TWC over a range of LWC/TWC ratios at (absolute) pressures of 34. 5 kPa and 69 kPa to test the hypothesis. The LWC/TWC ratio was varied by changing the wet bulb temperature. Accretion steady-state volumes and growth rates measured at the two pressures were compared at conditions which were analytically predicted to produce matched LWC/TWC ratios. Good agreement was achieved in all cases. Accretion growth was greatest for LWC/TWC ratios in the range 10 - 25...|$|R
40|$|This <b>article,</b> {{based upon}} <b>a</b> lecture {{delivered}} at the University of Alcalá de Henares in May 1990, during a Jornadas para la enseñanza del español como lengua extranjera, examines constructions that, in their emission, are characterized by an intonation peculiar to the Spanish interrogative scheme; and which, in their transcription, are denoted by interrogative marks, even though their production is not due to a desire to obtain information. The author's interest in these constructions originates in {{the reading of the}} doctoral dissertation of Mª V. Escandell (Madrid, Universidad Complutense, 1986). When these emissions are produced, both interlocutors identify the kind of speech act in which they are engaging: a suggestion (¿y si fueras al médico?), a warning or a threat (¿tú te crees que yo soy tonto?), or an incitement to action (¿y si yo te dijera que sé dónde está tu reloj?). These are structures which, almost apparently interrogatives, in fact do not ask <b>a</b> question. This <b>article</b> <b>consists</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pragmatic analysis of the strategies used by the producer of such questions, with particular attention to introductory elements. It is proposed that we produce such questions when: 1. We anticipate a possible attitude or response. 2. We elicite a response or a reaction. 3. We react to what has been said to us. It is suggered that the physical presence of the interlocutors is not indispensable (Juan es un cara. ¿Pues no me pide que le preste el coche con el depósito lleno?). It is concluded that the analysis of the circumstances in which these constructions are used does not help to distinguish them from real questions. A more detailed analysis of intonation in these constructions would perhaps be more fruitful...|$|R

These countries are: Australia, Canada, France, Great Britain, Holland, Italy, Japan, Sweden, United States and West Germany. The analysis covers {{the period of}} 1960 - 1989 and {{it is based on}} international statistics compiled by such organizations as the OECD and the EC. The aim of the article is to show the scale, growth trends, and main structural problems connected with industrial unemployment in the above countries - individually and as <b>a</b> group. The <b>article</b> <b>consists</b> <b>of</b> three parts. The first part discusses the main terminological issues, and especially the concepts of unemployment, labour resources, employment, unemployment rate etc. The author points out certain differences between definitions used by international and national statistics. In the second part there are analyzed dynamics of labour rescourccs and unemployment. A special attention has been paid here to determining the proportions оf growth rates of: labour rescources, employment and unemployment. In his studies, the author used also relative measures of unemployment, i. e. rates of unemployment. The problems of unemployment structure are analyzed in the third part of the article. The analysis covers the main demographic and socio-occupational characteristics of the unemployment and the lenght of time during which they remain without work. The performed analysis allows to formulate at least three significant conclusions: 1) unemployment continues to rank high among three main problems of the highly developed economies (inflation, stagnation, unemployment); 2) {{despite the fact that the}} scale of unemployment has diminished in recent years about 7 persons from among every 100 economically active persons are without jobs; 3) among the unemployment seeking jobs the biggest chances have men aged 25 - 54, followed by women of the same age, and young persons under 24 years of age; the representatives of ethnic-racial minorities.
