25|$|The light-front coupled cluster (LFCC) {{method is}} a {{particular}} form of truncation for the infinite coupled system of integral equations for light-front wave functions.

25|$|There <b>are</b> <b>ways</b> {{in which}} {{autoimmunity}} caused by molecular mimicry can be avoided. Control of the initiating factor (pathogen) via vaccination {{seems to be}} the most common method to avoid autoimmunity. Inducing tolerance to the host autoantigen in this way may also be the most stable factor. The development of a downregulating immune response to the shared epitope between pathogen and host may be the best way of treating an autoimmune disease caused by molecular mimicry. Alternatively, treatment with immunosuppressive drugs such as ciclosporin and azathioprine has also been used as a possible solution. However, in many cases this {{has been shown to be}} ineffective because cells and tissues have already been destroyed at the onset of the infection.|$|E

25|$|Many {{sports are}} practised in São Vicente, {{and many have}} spread to the {{remaining}} islands.

Cycling, walking trails and horseback riding <b>are</b> <b>ways</b> to explore the island. São Vicente has an excellent 18-hole golf course. For these reasons, tourism has excellent growth potential on São Vicente and in the rest of the Cape Verde archipelago. Travel between the diverse localities of the island is provided by a system of public transportation operated by five private companies: Transcor.SA, Morabeza Transport, Transport Joy, Friendship, Sotral and Automindelo. However, especially for places farthest from the city of the Mindelo, namely Baía das Gatas, Calhau, and São Pedro, van and bus leasing are the usual forms of transportation.|$|E

25|$|Applying a pinch {{current in}} a plasma {{can be used}} to {{counteract}} expansion and confine the plasma. A simple {{way to do this is}} to put the plasma in a linear tube and pass a current through it using electrodes at either end, like a fluorescent lamp. This arrangement still produces no confinement along the length of the tube, so the plasma flows onto the electrodes, rapidly eroding them. This is not a problem for a purely experimental machine, and there <b>are</b> <b>ways</b> to reduce the rate. Another solution is to place a magnet next to the tube; when the magnetic field changes, the fluctuations cause an electric current to be induced in the plasma. The major advantage of this arrangement is that there are no physical objects within the tube, so it can be formed into a torus and allow the plasma to circulate freely.|$|E
25|$|Homeless shelters {{can become}} grounds for {{community}} {{organization and the}} recruitment of homeless individuals into social movements for their own cause. Cooperation between the shelter and an elected representative from the homeless community at each shelter can serve as the backbone of this form of initiative. The representative presents and forwards problems, raises concerns and provides new ideas to the director and staff of the shelters. A few examples of possible problems <b>are</b> <b>ways</b> to deal with {{drug and alcohol use}} by certain shelter users and resolve interpersonal conflicts. SAND, the Danish National Organization for Homeless People, is one example of an organization that uses this empowerment approach. Issues reported at the homeless shelters are then addressed by SAND at the regional or national level. To open further dialogue, SAND organizes regional discussion forums where staff and leaders from the shelters, homeless representatives, and local authorities meet to discuss issues and good practices at the shelters.|$|E
25|$|IOPS {{performance}} of a ZFS storage pool can suffer if the ZFS raid is not appropriately configured. This applies to all types of RAID, {{in one way or}} another. If the zpool consists of only one group of disks configured as, say, eight disks in RAIDZ2, then the IOPS performance will be that of a single disk (write speed will be equivalent to 6 disks, but random read speed will be similar to a single disk). However, there <b>are</b> <b>ways</b> to mitigate this IOPS performance problem, for instance add SSDs as L2ARC cache— which can boost IOPS into 100.000s. In short, a zpool should consist of several groups of vdevs, each vdev consisting of 8–12 disks, if using RAIDZ. It is not recommended to create a zpool with a single large vdev, say 20 disks, because IOPS performance will be that of a single disk, which also means that resilver time will be very long (possibly weeks with future large drives).|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} simple {{methods such as}} priming, prompt delivery, picture schedules, peer tutoring, and {{cooperative}} learning, that have been proven to help autistic students to prepare for class and to understand the material better. Priming is done by allowing the students to see the assignment or material before they are shown in class. Prompt delivery consists of giving prompts to the autistic children in order to elicit {{a response to the}} academic material. Picture schedules are used to outline the progression of a class and are visual cues to allow autistic children to know when changes in the activity are coming up. This method has proven to be very useful in helping the students follow the activities. Peer tutoring and cooperative learning <b>are</b> <b>ways</b> in which an autistic student and a nonhandicapped student are paired together in the learning process. This has shown be very effective for “increasing both academic success and social interaction.” There are more specific strategies that have been shown to improve an autistic’s education, such as LEAP, Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children, and Non-Model-Specific Special Education Programs for preschoolers. LEAP is “an intensive 12-month program that focuses on providing a highly structured and safe environment that helps students to participate in and derive benefit from educational programming” and focuses on children from 5-21 who are on the have a more severe case of autism. The goal of the program is to develop functional independence through academic instruction, vocational/translational curriculum, speech/language services, and other services personalized for each student. While LEAP, TEACCH, and Non-Model Specific Special Education Programs are all different strategies, there has been no evidence that one is more effective than the other.|$|E
