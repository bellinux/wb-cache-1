In particular, we pay atte ntion to the pseudogap in the normal state and the phase transition from the pse udogap state to the superconducting state. The pseudogap phenomena observed in cuprates are naturally understood <b>as</b> <b>a</b> precursor of the strong coupling superconductivity.

Once t he superconducting phase transition occurs, the superconducting order parameter rapidly grows rather than the result of BCS theory.

40|$|This {{paper is}} about Wadler's {{deforestation}} [17, 66, 68], an algorithm eliminating intermediate data structures from first-order functional programs in which (i) no definition contains an argument {{which is not}} a variable; (ii) no definition contains a selector {{which is not a}} variable; (iii) no definition nor the main term contains a non-linear variable. We call a program treeless if it satisfies (i-ii), and linear if it satisfies (iii). In a treeless program the right hand sides do not construct intermediate data structures; this property guarantees termination of deforestation. In a linear program no duplication occurs; this ensures that the new program is at least as efficient as the original. For instance, the first program in Example 1 is treeless and linear, and can be translated to the second automatically by deforestation. Wadler also introduced blazed deforestation, a variant where the input program 's main term and right hand sides have certain marks, and where the algorithm skips over marked subterms. The act of putting such marks on a program is blazing. The problem remains to blaze each program so that (i) blazed deforestation of the blazed program terminates; (ii) the resulting program is no less efficient than the original one. A technique for blazing is termination-safe and efficiency-safe if it satisfies (i) and (ii), respectively, for all programs, and safe if it satisfies both (i) and (ii) for all programs. Since transformation skips over marked subterms, intermediate data structures produced by such subterms will not be removed. Thus, as few subterms as possible should receive marks, but enough subterms should receive marks to ensure safety. Wadler blazes programs on the basis of types. For instance, a subterm of integer type does not produce <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>resu</b> [...] ...|$|E
40|$|We {{explore the}} {{evolution}} of the cold gas (molecular and neutral hydrogen) and the star-formation activity during galaxy interactions, using a merging galaxy sequence comprising both pre- and post-merger candidates. Firstly, we find that the ratio of far-infrared luminosity to molecular hydrogen mass (LFIR =M (H 2); star-formation efficiency) is, on average, increasing close to nuclear coalescence. After the merging of the two nuclei there is evidence that the star-formation efficiency declines again to values typical to ellipticals. This trend is in agreement with previous studies and is attributed to M (H 2) depletion due to interaction induced star-formation. However, there is significant scatter, likely to arise from differences in the interaction details (e. g. disk-to-bulge ratio, geometry) of individual systems. Secondly, we find that the central molecular hydrogen surface density, Σ H 2, is also increasing close to the final stages of the merging of the to nuclei. Such a trend, indicating gas inflows due to gravitational instabilities during the interaction, is also predicted by numerical simulations. Furthermore, there is evidence for a decreasing fraction of cold gas mass from early interacting systems to merger remnants, attributed to neutral hydrogen conversion into other forms (e. g. stars, hot gas) and molecular hydrogen depletion due to on-going starformation. The evolution of the total-radio to blue-band luminosity ratio, estimating the total (disk and nucleus) star-formation activity, is also investigated. Although this ratio is on average higher than that of isolated spirals, we find a marginal increase along the merging sequence, attributed to the relative c fl 0000 RAS insensitivity of disk star-formation to interactions.
