40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects of {{detailed}} job characteristics on job satisfaction, job search <b>and</b> <b>quits</b> {{using data from the}} German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP) in a fixed effects framework. Using a factor analysis, seventeen job characteristics are reduced to seven factors that describe different aspects of a job, which are qualified as status, physical strain, autonomy, advancement opportunities, social relations at the work place, work time and job security. The effects of these factors on job satisfaction, job search <b>and</b> <b>quits</b> differ. For example, job insecurity reduces job satisfaction, increases the subjective probability of job search but it decreases quits. In circumstances of higher job insecurity it seems to be hard to find a job to quit into. Regressing job satisfaction, job search <b>and</b> <b>quits</b> on the detailed job characteristics shows that, when judging from the number of statistically significant coefficients, the job characteristics explain satisfaction best, while it is harder to explain job search <b>and</b> <b>quits</b> by these characteristics. Job satisfaction, however, is confirmed as a strong predictor of job search <b>and</b> <b>quits</b> after controling for both, individual fixed effects and a set of detailed job characteristics. job satisfaction, job mobility, quits, job search, fixed effects...|$|R

5|$|Few {{teams were}} {{interested}} in Pujols because of uncertainty about his age, which position he would play, and his build. Tampa Bay Rays scout Fernando Arango recommended that his team sign Pujols, <b>and</b> <b>quit</b> his job when Tampa Bay failed to do so. Pujols was not drafted until the 13th round of the 1999 Major League Baseball (MLB) Draft, when the St. Louis Cardinals selected him with the 402nd overall pick.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} alternative approaches to employment systems <b>and</b> <b>quits,</b> dismissals <b>and</b> customer service, based on cross-sectional and longitudinal data from nationally representative surveys of call center establishments. Contrary to prior literature, the antecedents <b>and</b> consequences of <b>quits</b> <b>and</b> dismissals are quite similar. Comparing three dimensions of employment systems, we find that high involvement work organization and long-term investments and inducements are associated with significantly lower <b>quit</b> <b>and</b> dismissal rates, while short term performance-enhancing expectations are related to significantly higher <b>quit</b> <b>and</b> dismissal rates. Establishments with higher <b>quit</b> <b>and</b> dismissal rates have significantly lower customer service, as reported by managers...|$|R
