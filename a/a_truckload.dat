5|$|Casualties {{during the}} 25th Battalion's {{campaign}} in Greece amounted to nearly 30 killed and wounded with 150 personnel captured and made prisoners of war. The {{majority of the}} captured personnel were from the battalion's reinforcement company, which had been left in Athens when the 6th Brigade moved up to the Aliakmon Line, as well as <b>a</b> <b>truckload</b> of infantrymen that had been misdirected to Kalamata during the retreat. One soldier managed to escape and eventually make his way to Turkey by sea, an act {{for which he was}} later awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal.|$|E
5|$|Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) Chairman Gordon Dean {{appointed}} Libby to its influential General Advisory Committee (GAC) in 1950. In 1954, he {{was appointed}} an AEC commissioner by President Dwight D. Eisenhower {{on the recommendation of}} Dean's successor, Lewis Strauss. Libby and his family moved from Chicago to Washington, D.C. He brought with him <b>a</b> <b>truckload</b> of scientific equipment, which he used to establish a laboratory at the Carnegie Institution there to continue his studies of amino acids. Staunchly conservative politically, {{he was one of the}} few scientists who sided with Edward Teller rather than Robert Oppenheimer during the debate on whether it was wise to pursue a crash program to develop the hydrogen bomb. As a commissioner, Libby played an important role in promoting Eisenhower's Atoms for Peace program, and was part of the United States delegation at the Geneva Conferences on Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy in 1955 and 1958.|$|E
5|$|On 28 June, {{the rebels}} ambushed <b>a</b> <b>truckload</b> of Italian soldiers, {{prompting}} the Italian Army {{commander in the}} NDH to warn the NDH government {{that he would take}} unilateral action to secure communication routes. A further gendarmerie post was destroyed by the rebels, and in the evening the rebels captured the village of Avtovac, looting and burning it, and killing dozens of non-Serb civilians. The following day an Italian column cleared the rebels from Avtovac and relieved the hard-pressed NDH garrison in the town of Gacko. From 3 July, an NDH force of over 2,000 fanned out from Nevesinje, clearing towns, villages and routes of rebels. The rebel forces did not put up any significant opposition to the clearing operation, and either retreated into nearby Montenegro, or hid their weapons in the mountains and went home. By 7 July, NDH forces had regained full control of all towns and major transport routes in eastern Herzegovina.|$|E

The next {{most efficient}} method would be to ship <b>a</b> full <b>truckload</b> to <b>a</b> distribution center, unload full pallets of products, and immediately load the pallets onto trucks destined for individual stores. Both of these methods can only be used on very high-volume items. Most products cannot be delivered in this manner, and pallets or even individual boxes must be broken down and divided.|$|R

5|$|In 1919, Frederick V. Coville called {{attention}} to the threatened state of the plant in an article in Science. While investigating the species for horticultural purposes, he only found two herbarium specimens, those of Baird and Canby. (Coville apparently did not locate Kinn's West Virginia specimen, preserved at the Muhlenberg Herbarium.) Upon examination of the New Bloomfield site in 1918, he discovered the entire colony, except for one patch cut off by cultivation, was connected by roots, and that no seedlings were in evidence anywhere around the margins of the colony. Coville concluded that the plant was self-sterile and reproduced by extending rootstocks. After commercial nurserymen removed <b>a</b> <b>truckload</b> of box huckleberry from the New Bloomfield site in 1918, Coville was particularly anxious to preserve the species, as the New Bloomfield site was the only one then thought extant. (It was protected by the state from 1929, becoming the Hoverter and Sholl Box Huckleberry Natural Area.) However, Edgar T. Wherry was able to locate the Delaware colony, thought lost, in 1919, and send specimens for cross-pollination with specimens from the Pennsylvania colony.|$|E

25|$|Once commingled recyclates are {{collected}} and delivered {{to a central}} collection facility, {{the different types of}} materials must be sorted. This is done in a series of stages, many of which involve automated processes such that <b>a</b> <b>truckload</b> of material can be fully sorted in less than an hour. Some plants can now sort the materials automatically, known as single-stream recycling. In plants, a variety of materials is sorted such as paper, different types of plastics, glass, metals, food scraps, and most types of batteries. A 30 percent increase in recycling rates has been seen in the areas where these plants exist.|$|E

25|$|As the {{battalion}} trained {{at its base}} in Helwan in preparation for {{the battalion}}'s impending move to Greece, reinforcements from New Zealand arrived to fill the ranks, depleted by illness. Baker was placed in command of the excess troops, which had been formed into a reinforcement company. When the battalion arrived in Greece on 27 March 1941, Baker's company was responsible for the battalion's advance base outside of Athens. Attached to the 5th Infantry Brigade, the battalion made a good account of itself defending its assigned portion of the Olympus Pass against elements of the 9th Panzer Division but were forced to withdraw from its positions on 17 April. Baker, having been tasked by Brigadier Edward Puttick, the commander of the 4th Infantry Brigade, with the collection of stragglers, was captured by German paratroopers. He managed to escape and, falling in with <b>a</b> <b>truckload</b> of Greeks, returned to Puttick's headquarters. He was once more ordered to collect stragglers (this time with infantry support) and direct them to the Porto Rafti beaches in preparation for embarkation for Crete.|$|E

50|$|The {{nature of}} road {{transportation}} of goods depends, apart from the degree of development of the local infrastructure, on the distance the goods are transported by road, the weight and volume of an individual shipment, {{and the type of}} goods transported. For short distances and light, small shipments a van or pickup truck may be used. For large shipments even if less than <b>a</b> full <b>truckload</b> <b>a</b> truck is more appropriate. (Also see Trucking and Hauling below). In some countries cargo is transported by road in horse-drawn carriages, donkey carts or other non-motorized mode. Delivery services are sometimes considered a separate category from cargo transport. In many places fast food is transported on roads by various types of vehicles. For inner city delivery of small packages and documents bike couriers are quite common.|$|R

500|$|The Gadget was hoisted {{to the top}} of a [...] steel tower. The height {{would give}} a better {{indication}} of how the weapon would behave when dropped from a bomber, as detonation in the air would maximize the amount of energy applied directly to the target (as the explosion expanded in a spherical shape) and would generate less nuclear fallout. The tower stood on four legs that went [...] into the ground, with concrete footings. Atop it was an oak platform, and a shack made of corrugated iron that was open on the western side. The Gadget was hauled up with an electric winch. <b>A</b> <b>truckload</b> of mattresses was placed underneath in case the cable broke and the Gadget fell.

Deusner added that the track sounds like [...] "it's conjuring several of Madonna's younger selves" [...] in its modest goal to just make people move. Sarah Crompton from The Daily Telegraph said that the song is infinitely forgettable. Popjustice named the song one of the best 100 singles of 2009.

Either the origin or destination of empty container transport requests is unknown in advance. A two-phase solution algorithm using deterministic annealing is presented to solve the bi-objective problem, minimizing the number of vehicles used and minimizing total distance travelled.

This heuristic is utilized both, to initialize the pheromone information and to construct solutions in the ACO procedure. The main idea is to use information about the required fleetsize, by initializing the system with a number of vehicles rather than opening vehicles one at a time as needed. Our results show the advantages of this new approach over more traditional, i. e. sequential, approaches. ...|$|R
