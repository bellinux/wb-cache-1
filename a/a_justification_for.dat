5|$|Even though Thiệu {{used the}} defeat of the South Vietnamese forces as <b>a</b> <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> the arrest of those generals, his real {{intention}} behind the arrests was to avert an imaginary military coup against him.

40|$|The lottery paradox {{occurs when}} we combine two {{plausible}} claims about epistemic justification: Probability claim: If A’s evidence makes p exceedingly likely, then <b>A</b> has <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> believing p. Conjunction claim: If <b>A</b> has <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> believing p, and <b>A</b> has <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> believing q, then <b>A</b> has <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> believing p&q. 1 Clarification: I use “A has <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> believing p ” and “A can justifiably believe p” equivalently {{to refer to}} the fact that A has ordinary outright (propositional) <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> ordinary outright belief in p. The lottery paradox (Kyburg 1961, 197) : A knows that he is confronted with a fair lottery with a large number of tickets n one and only one of which will win. Assuming both the probability and the conjunction claim, we are forced to accept the paradoxical conclusion that even though A knows that one ticket will win, <b>A</b> has <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> believing that all tickets will lose: (1) JBl 1 &…&JBln, from probability claim (2) (JBp&JBq) →JB(p&q), conjunction claim (3) JB(l 1 &…&ln), from (1) and iterated applications of (2) Since (3) is clearly false, either (1) or (2) must be rejected.

5|$|Testimony in {{the trial}} {{concluded}} on May 15, 1826; summations concluded four days later. Despite the lack of physical evidence, the jury deliberated only an hour before convicting Beauchamp of Sharp's murder. He {{was sentenced to death}} by hanging on June 26 of that year. Beauchamp requested a stay of execution to write <b>a</b> <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> his actions. The stay was granted, and the execution was rescheduled for July 7, 1826. Though Anna Beauchamp was questioned, a charge against her for being an accessory to the crime was dismissed.|$|E
5|$|The {{arterial}} bubble assumption {{can introduce}} {{variability in the}} decompression outcome through the lung function. The first variable is individual susceptibility. The filtering capacity of the lung may be assumed to vary between individuals, and for a given individual, from day to day, and {{may account for the}} inter-personal and intra-persona variability which have been observed in DCS susceptibility. Basically, a good diver is a good bubble filter. This is <b>a</b> <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> divers who seek top physical fitness for severe decompression exposures.|$|E
5|$|The {{expedition}} quickly {{descended into}} a debacle. Aristagoras fell out with Megabates {{on the journey}} towards Naxos, and Herodotus says that Megabates then sent messengers to Naxos, warning the Naxians of the force's intention. It is also possible, however, that this story was spread by Aristagoras after the event, by way of <b>a</b> <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> the subsequent failure of the campaign. At any rate, the Naxians were able to prepare properly for a siege, and the Persians arrived to a well-defended expedition. The Persians laid siege to the Naxians for four months, but eventually they and Aristagoras both ran out of money. The force sailed back to the mainland without a victory.|$|E

5|$|Ultimately the Gallipoli {{campaign}} was a disastrous failure. It did not achieve {{any of the}} objectives that had been given as <b>a</b> <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> it, and due to the inexperience of high commanders and mismanagement there were an unacceptably high number of casualties amongst the participating troops, not only from {{as a result of}} combat, but also due to widespread disease that resulted from poor sanitation and hygiene in the front lines and a breakdown in the casualty clearance and resupply and logistics systems. It has been estimated that {{over the course of the}} campaign there were 26,111 Australian casualties with 8,141 killed. Other Allied casualties—killed and wounded—included: 7,571 New Zealanders, 120,000 British and 27,000 French.|$|E
5|$|The first {{recorded}} works of Shakespeare are Richard III {{and the three}} parts of Henry VI, written in the early 1590s during a vogue for historical drama. Shakespeare's plays are difficult to date precisely, however, and studies of the texts suggest that Titus Andronicus, The Comedy of Errors, The Taming of the Shrew, and The Two Gentlemen of Verona may also belong to Shakespeare's earliest period. His first histories, which draw heavily on the 1587 edition of Raphael Holinshed's Chronicles of England, Scotland, and Ireland, dramatise the destructive results of weak or corrupt rule and have been interpreted as <b>a</b> <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> {{the origins of the}} Tudor dynasty. The early plays were influenced by the works of other Elizabethan dramatists, especially Thomas Kyd and Christopher Marlowe, by the traditions of medieval drama, and by the plays of Seneca. The Comedy of Errors was also based on classical models, but no source for The Taming of the Shrew has been found, though it is related to a separate play of the same name and may have derived from a folk story. Like The Two Gentlemen of Verona, in which two friends appear to approve of rape, the Shrew's story of the taming of a woman's independent spirit by a man sometimes troubles modern critics and directors.|$|E
5|$|The {{movement}} towards Christianity {{began again}} in the late 6th and 7th centuries, helped by {{the conversion of the}} Franks in Northern France, who carried considerable influence in England. Pope Gregory I sent a team of missionaries to convert King Æthelberht of Kent and his household, starting the process of converting Kent. Augustine became the first Archbishop of Canterbury and started to build new churches across the South-East, reusing existing pagan shrines. Oswald and Oswiu, kings of Northumbria, were converted in the 630s and 640s, and the wave of change carried on through the middle of the 7th century across the kingdoms of Mercia, the South Saxons and the Isle of Wight. The process was largely complete {{by the end of the}} 7th century, but left a confusing and disparate array of local practices and religious ceremonies. This new Christianity reflected the existing military culture of the Anglo-Saxons: as kings began to convert in the 6th and 7th centuries, conversion began to be used as <b>a</b> <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> war against the remaining pagan kingdoms, for example, while Christian saints were imbued with martial properties.|$|E
