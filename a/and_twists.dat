5|$|During {{a welcome}} dinner at Barton Park, Sir John {{introduces}} the Dashwoods to his wife, Lady Middleton (Rosanna Lavelle); her mother, Mrs. Jennings (Linda Bassett); {{and their family}} friend, Colonel Brandon (David Morrissey). Brandon instantly {{falls in love with}} Marianne, but she believes he is too old for her. While out walking with Margaret, Marianne falls <b>and</b> <b>twists</b> her ankle. She is rescued by a young man, who carries her back to the cottage. He introduces himself as John Willoughby (Dominic Cooper), and states that he will return to check on Marianne the following day. Brandon also comes to visit, but upon seeing Willoughby, he quickly departs. Willoughby and Marianne grow close through their mutual love of poetry, and he later takes a lock of her hair. Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor begin to speculate on whether they have become secretly engaged.|$|E
5|$|The {{species can}} hunt singly, in pairs, and in groups, relying on sharp {{eyesight}} to locate prey. In some cases, supposed cooperative hunting may be incidental, {{a result of}} group members fishing individually in close proximity; truly coordinated hunting may only occur where the prey cannot be taken by a single giant otter, such as with small anacondas and juvenile black caiman. The giant otter seems to prefer prey fish that are generally immobile on river bottoms in clear water. Prey chase is rapid and tumultuous, with lunges <b>and</b> <b>twists</b> through the shallows and few missed targets. The otter can attack from both above and below, swiveling at the last instant to clamp the prey in its jaws. Giant otters catch their own food and consume it immediately; they grasp the fish firmly between the forepaws and begin eating noisily at the head. Carter and Rosas have found captive adult animals consume around 10% of their body weight daily—about , in keeping with findings in the wild.|$|E

Equations of motion <b>and</b> <b>twist</b> wave propagation {{are used to}} obtain the numerical solutions of yarn path, yarn tension <b>and</b> <b>twist</b> distribution in steady state. It is observed that yarn path in the twisting zone has several classic modes corresponding to the yarn tension, {{and all of the}} yarn paths are approximately planar curves rather than spatial curves. The angular velocities of yarn at the twisting device are given as well as the twist of yarn in the modified ring spinning system. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the yarn paths <b>and</b> <b>twist</b> distributions under consideration. The theoretical and experimental results have a good agreement.

40|$|<b>Twist</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Twist</b> 2 {{are highly}} conserved {{members of the}} Twist {{subfamily}} of bHLH proteins responsible for the transcriptional regulation of the developmental programs in mesenchymal cell lineages. The regulation of such processes requires that <b>Twist</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Twist</b> 2 function as molecular switches to activate and repress target genes by employing several direct and indirect mechanisms. Modes of action by these proteins include direct DNA binding to conserved E-box sequences and recruitment of coactivators or repressors, sequestration of E-protein modulators, and interruption of proper activator/repressor function through protein–protein interactions. Regulatory outcomes of <b>Twist</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Twist</b> 2 are themselves controlled by spatial-temporal expression, phosphoregulation, dimer choice and cellular localization. Although these two proteins are highly conserved and exhibit similar functions in vitro, emerging literature have demonstrated different roles in vivo. The involvement of <b>Twist</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Twist</b> 2 in {{a broad spectrum of}} regulatory pathways highlights the importance of understanding their roles in normal development, homeostasis and disease. Here we focus on the mechanistic models of transcriptional regulation and summarize the similarities <b>and</b> differences between <b>Twist</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Twist</b> 2 in the context of myogenesis, osteogenesis, immune system development and cancer...|$|R

25|$|It is not {{possible}} to speak of St Boswells village without thinking of the river which bends <b>and</b> <b>twists</b> on its swift flowing course north of the village. Famous for its salmon and brown trout it has given satisfaction to anglers over the years. Many of the local houses were built of stones from the river bed. The riverside walks are at all times pleasant and sometimes spectacular. Walkers on St Cuthbert's Way through the village on pilgrimage from Melrose to Lindisfarne see the same view of the Eildon Hills as was seen by such men as Modan who established a religious cell at Dryburgh; Aidan who brought twelve young monks from Lindisfarne to Old Melrose as missionaries; Cuthbert who became prior and bishop and Boisil who, after a life of holiness and healing gave his name to the village and parish of St Boswells.|$|E
25|$|A {{certain number}} of seats used for {{domestic}} purposes are of great interest. A {{good example of the}} long bench placed against the wall, with lofty panelled back and canopy over, is in the Musée Cluny, Paris. In the Museum at Rouen is a long seat of a movable kind with a low panelled back of pierced tracery, and in the Dijon Museum there {{is a good example of}} the typical chair of the period, with arms and high panelled and traceried back. There was a style of design admirably suited to the decoration of furniture when made of softwood such as pine. It somewhat resembled the excellent Scandinavian treatment of the 10th-12th centuries already referred to. A pattern of Gothic foliage, often of beautiful outline, would be simply grounded out to a shallow depth.

A Swiss door of the 15th century in the Berlin Museum, and some German, Swiss and Tirolese work in the Victoria and Albert Museum, offer patterns that might well be imitated today by those who require simple decoration while avoiding the hackneyed Elizabethan forms.|$|E

25|$|At the Manor Christmas party, Will {{once again}} sees Dawson and Old George {{who seem to}} know him well. Miss Greythorne and Merriman debate about {{when and how to}} {{approach}} Will about his destiny. Maggie Barnes (Amelia Warner), an attractive local girl appears at the party and Will becomes upset when one of his older brothers approaches her and begins chatting to her. Will leaves the Manor, and an ominous figure mounted on a white horse and accompanied by dogs chases Will. As the ominous figure prepares to kill Will, who is currently no match for him, Miss Greythorne, Merriman, Dawson, and Old George suddenly appear and save Will. Merriman names the threatening figure as The Rider (Christopher Eccleston), who warns them all that in five days' time his power – The Dark – will rise. The four adults are the last of the Old Ones – ancient warriors who serve The Light – and take Will on a walk through time and space to a place called the Great Hall, which in the present day is the church the Stantons attend. Will is the last of the Old Ones to have been born: he is the seventh son of a seventh son whose power begins to ascend on his fourteenth birthday, though Will disputes this idea because he believes he is the sixth son. Will is The Seeker: the sign-seeker who must locate six Signs whose possession will grant The Light power over The Dark. The Rider is also seeking them. Will returns home to his attic room and falls <b>and</b> <b>twists</b> his ankle. The doctor who calls is The Rider in disguise but he is recognized by Will. The Rider demonstrates his powers on Will’s ankle by alternately healing it and making it much worse before restoring it to its injured state; he offers Will the chance to have any desire he wants fulfilled in exchange for giving him the signs. Will discovers he has a lost twin brother named Tom, who, as a baby, mysteriously disappeared one night and was never found. Merriman instructs Will on his powers, which include sensing the Signs, summoning superhuman strength, commanding light and fire, telekinesis, stepping through time, and the unique knowledge to decipher an ancient text in the Book of Gramarye. Unfortunately, Will learns he can't fly, a power he wanted.|$|E

500|$|The {{theme of}} tyranny and {{alienation}} shows how a dictatorship not only alienates and [...] "others" [...] {{the people in}} the country, but also prevents the country itself from achieving European modernization. In a 1967 essay, literary critic Ariel Dorfman argues that [...] "dictatorship, which in [...] manifested itself in the political realm, is now a dictatorship of fire of the word, but always a tyranny that men themselves ask for, adore, and help to build". Dorfman also notes that [...] "The 'little human bundles' of Asturias's world end up destroying themselves, being disintegrated by the very forces that they themselves spoke." [...] By this he means that the characters are undone by their own actions and words as the President uses <b>and</b> <b>twists</b> them. The tyranny of language perversely parallels the political oppression which is omnipresent in Asturias's world. Richard Franklin argues that [...] "in a philosophical sense, Asturias has eloquently affirmed the validity of individual experience".|$|E
