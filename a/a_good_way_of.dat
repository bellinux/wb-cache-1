25|$|Modern {{historians have}} put forward many views and {{explanations}} {{of the civil war}} era. The contemporary sources, the sagas, strongly emphasise the personal nature of the conflicts—wars arose {{as a result of the}} struggle between different people for the possession of the throne. The unclear succession laws, and the practice of power-sharing between several kings simultaneously, gave personal conflicts the potential to become full-blown wars. More recently historian Narve Bjørgo has suggested that the practice of power-sharing was actually <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> governing the kingdom in the first period after its unification, and that tendencies towards centralization, and a unitary kingdom, were important factors in triggering the wars. Edvard Bull has also emphasized geographical animosities as a factor, pointing to the fact that different pretenders often found their main support in certain parts of the country. Also important was the involvement of foreign powers: Danish and, to a lesser extent, Swedish kings were always ready to lend their support to factions in the Norwegian wars, with an eye to extending their own influence, particularly in the Viken (Oslofjord) area.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the show}} aired, Holland and Smith {{had already decided}} that Sue and her husband would be parents to a young baby named Hassan. However, as further {{characters}} were invented they realised {{that there would be}} a total of four babies in the show: Annie Smith, Martin Fowler, Vicki Fowler and Hassan. It was decided that it would be impossible for the studios to cope with four babies, and so they invented a storyline to eliminate one of the young babies from the cast. During this time in the 1980s, the issue of cot death was extremely prominent in the British press, partly due to an increase in casualties, but also because a doctor had gone public with the accusation that parents were to blame for the tragic occurrence. Holland and Smith decided that covering this subject in the soap would be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> 'setting the record straight', and so it was decided that Sue and Ali's baby would die from cot death in the early months of the show. This was the first of many controversial storylines in EastEnders history. After the storyline aired in June 1985, the show was praised by audience and press alike for the sensitive and unsensational way this harrowing subject was treated. The sudden tragedy came as a surprise to the audience, especially since the bereaved parents were a couple whose feuding, fighting ways had made them appear rather comic in the early episodes of the show. The British Cot Death Foundation initially feared that a soap opera would trivialise the subject and frighten new parents. They tried to stop the episodes from airing, but in the end they were pleased with the way the subject was handled, and provided back-up support after transmission to many viewers who wanted more information on the subject.|$|E

It sees Hayley Atwell reprise her role as Peggy Carter, along with Dominic Cooper, Neal McDonough, and Chris Evans reprising their roles as Howard Stark, Timothy [...] "Dum Dum" [...] Dugan, and Steve Rogers / Captain America, respectively, the latter via archive footage. The short film introduces Bradley Whitford as Agent John Flynn and Shane Black as the Disembodied Voice. It was directed by Louis D’Esposito and written by Eric Pearson. The short was filmed over five days, and reused visual effects shots of 1940s New York from Captain America: The First Avenger to save money. Christopher Lennertz collaborated with D'Esposito again on the short, composing music for it. He also composes the music for the MCU television series Marvel's Agent Carter, which {{is directly related to the}} short.|$|E

In adopting the 'Kinks' as their name at that time, they were participating in a time-honoured pop ritual—fame through outrage." [...] Manager Robert Wace related {{his side of the}} story: [...] "I had a friend... He thought the group was rather fun. If my memory is correct, he came up with the name just as an idea, as <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> getting publicity...

GameSpot's Greg Kasavin called it [...] "a game that can be recommended wholeheartedly". Both Eurogamer and Official PlayStation Magazine positively compared the game's aesthetics and presentation to Ico. Francesca Reyes of Official Xbox Magazine gave the game a good review, praising the story and general gameplay, but finding the combat difficult at times and lack of new skills. In closing, she praised the game's lasting appeal: [...] "When {{the whole thing is}} over, it's perfectly timed to leave you wanting more. It's a stunning and rare achievement that makes you feel happy to be a gamer."

[...] In a separate interview with Michael Logan of TV Guide, Scott stated: [...] "Nikki thinks she has come up with <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> having everyone informed in the kindest way possible.

[...] Speaking of how the revelation would affect Nicholas, Scott added, [...] "She feels very badly about Nick losing Avery but not bad enough that she doesn't expect Nick to play nice and accept this man — not necessarily as a brother but still as a member of the family. She expects him to find a way to be civil. She wants everyone to be happy together." [...] Speculation also arose that Nikki's son could be Dylan's best friend Stitch Rayburn (Sean Carrigan), to which Scott teased, [...] "Maybe that's coming. Nikki had cult twins! You never know.
