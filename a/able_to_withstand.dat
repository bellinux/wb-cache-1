5|$|Peléan eruptions are {{characterized}} most prominently by the incandescent pyroclastic flows that they drive. The mechanics of a Peléan eruption {{are very similar}} to that of a Vulcanian eruption, except that in Peléan eruptions the volcano's structure is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> more pressure, hence the eruption occurs as one large explosion rather than several smaller ones.|$|E
5|$|The {{design for}} Chaoyong was advertised by its designer, British naval {{architect}} Sir George Wightwick Rendel, {{as an example}} of a low-cost cruiser <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> larger ironclad warships. The design was later seen as an intermediate concept between his flat-iron gunboats and the protected cruiser. In theory, the ship would rely on its small size and higher speed, along with a higher muzzle velocity main battery to attack larger, less maneuverable ships.|$|E
5|$|Benthic in nature, {{the plain}} maskray feeds mainly on caridean shrimp and polychaete worms, {{and to a}} lesser extent on small bony fishes. It is viviparous, with females {{producing}} litters of one or two young that are nourished during gestation via histotroph ("uterine milk"). This species lacks economic value but is caught incidentally in bottom trawls, which it is thought to be less <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> than other maskrays due to its gracile build. As it also has a limited distribution and low fecundity, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it as Near Threatened.|$|E

50|$|The {{second type}} of goaltender mask is a {{fiberglass}} mask with a cage attached in the middle. It can also be made out of carbon fiber, or a fiberglass and kevlar mix. These masks are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> better <b>withstand</b> the impacts of hockey puck at higher speeds and are used {{at all levels of}} organized ice hockey. These masks are considered safer since they disperse the impact of the puck better than the helmet/cage combination. Former goaltender Tim Thomas of the Boston Bruins wore a newer style one piece called a Sportmask Mage RS, which is made like the newer fiberglass mask, but resembles the helmet/cage combination.|$|R
5|$|England {{then started}} their reply, and Lindwall took the new ball and felt {{pain in his}} groin again after {{delivering}} his first ball to Hutton. Despite this, Lindwall persevered through the pain. Seeing that Lindwall was able to bowl through the pain, Bradman tossed the ball to Miller for the second over to see if Miller could bowl. However, Miller threw the ball back, indicating that his body would not be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> it. This resulted in media consternation that Bradman and Miller had quarrelled.|$|E
5|$|The Pipeline Authorization Act {{required}} the pipeline to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> the maximum earthquake ever {{recorded in the}} area it was built. When crossing the Denali Fault, Teflon-coated sliders were designed to allow the pipeline to move side-to-side in an earthquake. To protect against forward-and-backward shocks and to allow for thermal expansion, the pipeline wasn't designed as a straight line. Instead, {{it was intended to}} be laid in an S-shape, and the bends would allow for expansion and movement without breaking.|$|E
5|$|Unlike other insects, fleas do {{not possess}} {{compound}} eyes but instead only have simple eyespots with a single biconvex lens; some species lack eyes altogether. Their bodies are laterally compressed, permitting easy movement through the hairs or feathers on the host's body (or {{in the case of}} humans, under clothing). The flea body is covered with hard plates called sclerites. These sclerites are covered with many hairs and short spines directed backward, which also assist its movements on the host. The tough body is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> great pressure, likely an adaptation to survive attempts to eliminate them by scratching.|$|E

Surviving proportions of each competitor were {{calculated from the}} broth culture at 24 and 96 h and the biofilm culture at 96 h, with species differentiation done on CHROMagar Candida medium. C. albicans had a competitive advantage over C. dubliniensis in broth culture and under biofilm growing conditions; however, {{with the presence of}} a supporting structure for biofilm formation, C. dubliniensis was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> better <b>withstand</b> the competitive pressures from C. albicans...|$|R
50|$|On March 27, land {{communication}} with the Yishuv was severed completely when the Nabi Daniel Convoy was ambushed on its return journey to Jerusalem. In the following months, Arab irregular forces continued small-scale attacks against the bloc, which the Haganah was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> effectively <b>withstand.</b> At times, the Haganah forces, commanded by Uzi Narkiss, ambushed Arab military convoys — and, according to Morris, also Arab civilian traffic and British military convoys —, on the road between Jerusalem and Hebron. The defenders of Gush Etzion and the central command in Jerusalem mulled evacuation, but, although they had very few arms, {{a decision was made}} to hold out due to their strategic location as the only Jewish-held position on Jerusalem's southern approach from Hebron.|$|R
5|$|Unlike semiaquatic temnospondyls, {{terrestrial}} temnospondyls have skulls {{that are}} adapted for biting land-living prey. The sutures between {{the bones of}} the skull in the dissorophoid Phonerpeton are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> a high degree of compression. Compressive forces would have been experienced when biting down on prey. Earlier aquatic tetrapods and tetrapod ancestors differ from temnospondyls like Phonerpeton in that their skulls were also built to withstand tension. This tension would have been experienced during suction feeding underwater. Temnospondyls like Phonerpeton were among the first tetrapods that were almost exclusively terrestrial and fed by biting.|$|E
5|$|Developed in the United States, the American Water Spaniel is the Wisconsin state dog. The breed {{originated}} in the areas along the Fox River and its tributary the Wolf River during the early 19th century. Hunters needed a dog that could work on both land and water, a versatile hunter skilled at bringing {{in a variety of}} game. Hunters also wanted a hunting dog compact enough to be transported in a small skiff, one that was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> Wisconsin's cold water temperatures. Breeds involved {{in the creation of the}} American Water Spaniel are thought to have included the English Water Spaniel, Irish Water Spaniel, Curly Coated Retriever, native Indian Dogs, the Poodle, and either the Sussex Spaniel or another type of field spaniel.|$|E
5|$|Following post-storm surveys, it was {{determined}} that most of the severely damaged schools were built improperly and the upper-floors were not designed to bear typhoon-force winds. According to building codes in Thailand, structures are mandated to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> up to 120kgf/m2 of pressure from winds. In the years following the typhoon, studies by engineers were conducted in the hardest hit regions to determine how to best rebuild structures in the country. With many of the destroyed structures being constructed from wood, reinforced concrete structures were the suggested replacement. The new buildings could last up to 50 years with proper construction; however, sub-standard building would result in a need for repairs within five years.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} change form, Adrianna must be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> say [...] "I Am Isis", thereby invoking spells {{involving}} the energies of the extra-dimensional being {{once known as}} Isis on Earth. This spell adds almost a hundred pounds of impervious godly muscle and tissue to her frame. This spell seems to be solely vocal; she cannot access this spell if she is gagged or hampered in some way from talking. The precision of this spell is somewhat askew. All Adrianna has to say is [...] "I Am Isis" [...] and she is mystically transformed and instilled with {{the powers of the}} goddess. It was later revealed that the powers that Adrianna draws from Isis are the most powerful of the Eight Egyptian Gods. When her powers were possessed by Black Adam, he was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> fight off most of the superheroes on Earth alone. When Black Adam transferred both his and Isis' powers to Mary, she was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> easily <b>withstand</b> Darkseid's Omega Beams.|$|R
50|$|This species is, {{with the}} {{possible}} exception of a single specimen found north of Kyogle, as of yet unidentified and most probably belonging to a distinct species, unique amongst known Australian hydrobiids in being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> aestivate and <b>withstand</b> drying. The type series were found in dry soil in a small, dry creek bed on the landward side of a small hill, in a small coastal rainforest remnant in Burleigh Head National Park, Queensland. Several days after collection they were placed in water, after which they soon emerged and crawled about actively.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} Germany’s {{position of}} power in the European Union. Germany has gone from ‘the sick man of Europe’ to being the, by far, leading economic power in Europe. The paper will take a look at Germany’s new role, how it achieved it and discusses if Germany is becoming an economic hegemon in the European Union. Further it will examine Greece through a case study, which will illuminate how Germany is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> affect other, weaker, countries in the European Union. The analysis of this paper is conducted via extensive document analysis of scientific articles and expert sources, which gives a wide array of perspectives on the issues presented in this paper. It is concluded that Germany, though largely dependent on the European Coal and Steel Community, have attained it’s economic power through a large production and subsequent export of goods. The economic crisis has only made the gap between Germany and the weaker nations bigger, as Germany’s economy has made them <b>able</b> <b>to</b> better <b>withstand</b> the effects of the crisis...|$|R
5|$|However, it {{is highly}} {{unlikely}} that single-story structures such as mobile homes can have a substantial effect on tornado development or evolution. More people are killed in trailer parks because mobile homes are less <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> high winds than permanent structures. Winds which can demolish or roll a mobile home may only cause roof damage to a typical one- or two-family permanent residence. Another likely contributing factor to the continued propagation of this myth is confirmation bias: whenever a new instance of a tornado hitting a mobile home park occurs, media outlets report on it more extensively, ignoring damage to the surrounding area which may not have produced as many casualties.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, Austrian {{paleontologist}} Georg Haas {{concluded that}} despite the large size of ankylosaur skulls, the associated musculature was relatively weak. He also thought jaw movement was limited to up and down movements. Extrapolating from this, Haas suggested that ankylosaurs ate relatively soft non-abrasive vegetation. Later research on Euoplocephalus indicates that forward and sideways jaw movement was possible in these animals, the skull being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> considerable forces. A 2016 study of the dental occlusion (contact between the teeth) of ankylosaur specimens found that the ability for backwards (palinal) jaw movement evolved independently in different ankylosaur linages, including Late Cretaceous North American ankylosaurids like Ankylosaurus and Euoplocephalus.|$|E
5|$|In his discourses {{recorded}} in the Vachanamrut, Swaminarayan mentions that humans would not be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> meeting god in his divine form, hence God takes human form (simultaneously living in his abode) so people can approach, understand and love him {{in the form of}} an Avatar. While no detailed statistical information is available, most of the followers of Swaminarayan share a belief that Swaminarayan is the complete manifestation of Narayana or Purushottam Narayana - the Supreme Being and superior to other avatars. A Swaminarayan sectarian legend tells how Narayana from the Nara Narayana pair, was cursed by sage Durvasa to incarnate on the earth as Swaminarayan.|$|E

Young female workers are preferred over older females or males for several reasons. First, as married women are less mobile, female migrant workers are younger and more likely to be single than their male counterparts. Young rural women are preferred for these jobs primarily because {{they are less likely to}} get pregnant, and are <b>able</b> and willing <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> longer working hours, have [...] "nimble fingers, and will be less experienced in asking for their statutory rights.

50|$|A {{ball screw}} is a {{mechanical}} linear actuator that translates rotational motion to linear motion with little friction. A threaded shaft provides a helical raceway for ball bearings which {{act as a}} precision screw. As well as being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> apply or <b>withstand</b> high thrust loads, they can do so with minimum internal friction. They are made to close tolerances and are therefore suitable for use in situations in which high precision is necessary. The ball assembly acts as the nut while the threaded shaft is the screw.In contrast to conventional leadscrews, ballscrews tend to be rather bulky, due {{to the need to}} have a mechanism to re-circulate the balls.|$|R
40|$|A {{complex system}} of {{spacecraft}} and ground tracking stations, {{as well as}} a constellation of satellites or spacecraft, has <b>to</b> be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> reliably <b>withstand</b> sudden environment changes, resource fluctuations, dynamic resource configuration, limited communication bandwidth, etc., while maintaining the consistency of the system as a whole. It is not known in advance when a change in the environment might occur or when a particular exchange will happen. A higher degree of sophistication for the communication mechanisms between different parts of the system is required. The actual behavior has to be determined while the system is performing and the course of action can be decided at the individual level. Under such circumstances, the solution will highly benefit from increased on-board and on the ground adaptability and autonomy. An evolvable architecture based on intelligent agents that communicate and cooperate with each other can offer advantages in this direction. This paper presents an architecture of an evolvable agent-based system (software and software/hardware hybrids) as well as some plans for further implementation...|$|R
