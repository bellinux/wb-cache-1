50|$|A {{soldier was}} killed and 18 protesters wounded in clashes between {{security}} forces and UDD members on Wednesday, 28 April. The clashes had started when troops and riot police blocked UDD protesters from going to Talad Thai to campaign for the anti-government rally. Protesters had attempted to <b>advance</b> <b>on</b> the <b>Security</b> forces, but were repelled by troops and police officers using tear gas and rubber bullets. Security forces then began to push forward, and drive protesters back down the highway using live ammunition, and fighting resumed after a temporary calm. After several hours, Security forces regained control of the area, and dispersed the protest.

Relying on physically isolated networks and on “Security by Obscurity”, as it is still common today, {{is by no means}} an adequate solution. To be reliable and robust against malicious manipulations, the used communication services must support advanced security mechanisms that counteract potential security threats. This paper identifies important security requirements and challenges within the building automation domain. Based on this analysis, state-of-the-art technologies are carefully examined.

40|$|International audienceThis chapter focuses <b>on</b> recent <b>advances</b> <b>on</b> {{medical data}} <b>security</b> based <b>on</b> the {{combination}} of watermarking and encryption {{which can be used}} in healthcare so as to offer a more complete and continuous protection of digital data. Indeed, if encryption can be considered as an ``a priori" protection mechanism since once data are decrypted they are no longer protected, it should be completed by an ``a posteriori" protection, a protection watermarking can provide. Basically, when it is applied to images, watermarking modifies or modulates in an imperceptible way the image pixels' gray level values in order to insert a message. This message can be used to assess the origins as well as the integrity of the image. As defined, watermarking provides an ``a posteriori" protection as the image content is still available for interpretation while remaining protected. In order to benefit from the complementarity of these two mechanisms in terms of a priori/a posteriori protection different approaches have been proposed. In this chapter, we present the different purposes their combination have been suggested for in the healthcare domain. We also depict one practical joint watermarking encryption algorithm well adapted to telemedicine application frameworks...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{adoption of}} Cloud storage poses {{a number of}} privacy issues. Users wish to preserve full control over their sensitive data and cannot accept that it to be accessible by the remote storage provider. Previous research was made on techniques to protect data stored on untrusted servers; however we argue that the cloud architecture presents a number of open issues. To handle them, we present an approach where confidential data is stored in a highly distributed database, partly located on the cloud and partly on the clients. Data is shared in a secure manner using a simple grant-and-revoke permission of shared data and we have developed a system test implementation, using an in-memory RDBMS with row-level data encryption for fine-grained data access controlComment: 13 pages, International Journal <b>on</b> <b>Advances</b> in <b>Security</b> 2011 vol. 4 no 3 & 4. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv: 1012. 0759, arXiv: 1109. 355...|$|R

Generating patches could overcome this problem. Patches are usually generated with human intervention, {{which is very}} time-consuming and {{needs a lot of}} experience. A few heuristic methods can generate patches automatically. But they usually have high false negative and/or false positive rate. We proposed a novel solution and implemented a real system called PatchGen that can automatically generate patches for vulnerabilities. PatchGen innovatively combines several techniques: (1) It can automatically generate patches for Windows x 86 binaries without any need for source code, debugging information or human intervention. (2) Attribute-based taint analysis method (ATAM) is proposed to find attack point and overflow point with no need to record or analyze program execution traces, which saves both analysis time and memory. (3) PatchGen automatically tunes the candidate position to find the most suitable position to patch. We made several experiments on PatchGen. The results show that PatchGen can successfully generate patches for buffer overflow vulnerabilities in several minutes. The running overhead of the patched applications is less than 1 % in average. © 2010 Springer-Verlag...|$|R

40|$|Guaranteeing the {{security}} of information transmitted through the Internet, against passive or active attacks, is a major concern. The discovery of new pseudo-random number generators with a strong level of security is a field of research in full expansion, {{due to the fact}} that numerous cryptosystems and data hiding schemes are directly dependent on the quality of these generators. At the conference Internet` 09, we described a generator based on chaotic iterations which behaves chaotically as defined by Devaney. In this paper which is an extension of the work presented at the conference Internet` 10, the proposal is to improve the speed, {{the security}}, and the evaluation of this generator, to make its use more relevant in the Internet security context. In order to do so, a comparative study between various generators is carried out and statistical results are improved. Finally, an application in the information hiding framework is presented with details, to give an illustrative example of the use of such a generator in the Internet security field.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to explore how European changes in the view <b>on</b> <b>security</b> relates to the view on {{immigration}} and vice versa. The answer to that question is based upon collected data from three separate time periods; the 1950 s, 1970 s and 1990 s. These time periods are seen as important historic decades when political changes, assumed to have affected the views <b>on</b> <b>security</b> and immigration, have occurred. According to certain criteria each time period has been labelled in terms of narrowed/widened view <b>on</b> <b>security</b> as well as restrictive/open view on immigration. The hypothesis of the study is that, when compared, a constant pattern can be seen between the historical labels of each phenomenon, where a narrow view <b>on</b> <b>security</b> goes hand in hand with an open view on immigration and similarly a wide security view relates to a restrictive view on immigration.
