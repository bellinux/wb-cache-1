We present dust {{features}} and masses observed in young supernova remnants (SNRs) with Spitzer IRS mapping and staring observations of four youngest supernova remnants: SNR 1 E 102. 2 - 7219 (E 0102) in the SMC, Cas A and G 11. 2 - 0. 3 in our Galaxy, and N 132 D in the LMC. The spectral mapping data revealed {{a number of}} dust features which include 21 micron-peak dust and featureless dust in Cas A and 18 -micron peak dust in E 0102 and N 132 D. The 18 micron-peak feature is fitted by a mix of MgSiO 3 and solid Si dust grains, while the 21 -micron peak dust is by a mix of silicates and FeO; we also explore dust fitting using Continuous Distribution of Ellipsoid grain models. We report detection of CO fundamental band from Cas A in near-infrared. We review dust features observed and identified in other SNRs. The dust emission is spatially correlated with the ejecta emission, showing dust is formed in SN ejecta. The spectra of E 0102 show rich gas lines from ejecta including strong ejecta lines of Ne and O, including two [Ne III] lines and two [Ne V] lines which allow us to diagnostic density and temperature of the ejecta and measure the ejecta masses.

With a symmetry analysis and interpolation of Born-von Karman force constants, the complete phonon spectra are obtained for the cubic systems <b>Ar,</b> <b>Si,</b> Ge, and diamond, and for the stacked hexagonal system, graphite. The phonon spectra for the polar materials GaAs and GaP, in which the degeneracy between longitudinal and transverse optical modes is lifted, are also calculated. The splitting {{is a consequence of}} the macroscopic field associated with long-range Coulombic interactions and longitudinal displacements. Diagramatically-derived expressions for the finite lifetime of the Raman mode arising from phonon-phonon interactions are calculated for Si, Ge, and diamond from first principles, and agree with experiment to within uncertainty. The infrared absorption spectra of GaAs and GaP are calculated from first principles through the phonon anharmonic self-energy (phonon-phonon interaction) and the Born effective charges (photon-phonon interaction). Several aspects of the spectra are in detailed agreement with the experimental spectra, including the strong temperature dependence of the far-infrared absorption due to the onset of difference processes; the linewidth and asymmetric lineshape of the reststrahlen; the spectral structure of the absorption by two-phonon modes, and overall oscillator strengths. The theory allows for the identification of narrow spectral transmission bands with an ionic mass mismatch in the case of GaP. Analytic and complete calculations are performed for the ion-ion displacement correlation function in solid Ar, and agree well. The correlations are evaluated for arbitrary lattice vector and Cartesian displacement directions, and their pressure dependence leads to the conjecture that anharmonic effects are less prominent at higher pressures...|$|E

Ši tema šiai dienai aktuali, nes Lietuvoje pastebima, kaip daugėja nusikalstamų bankrotų, kurių siekiai būna ne tiksukelti bankrotą, bet kartu pasipelnyti bei išvengti susikaupusių skolų išieškojimo. Oatsiradusteismų praktikoje tokiai problemai pastebėtina, jog nėra vieningos nuomonės sprendžiant šiuos klausimus. Nusikalstamo bankroto dispozicijoje veika apibrėžta kaip “sąmoningai blogas įmonės valdymas”, kurio pasekmės – įmonės bankrotas ir didelė turtinė žala kreditoriams. Dažniausiai per šią veiką yra padaromos kitos nusikalstamos veikos. Todėl šiame darbe nagrinėjama, <b>ar</b> <b>ši</b> nusikalstama veika gali būti kaltininkui inkriminuojama papildomai kaip sukčiavimas išvengiant turtinės prievolės. Pirmoje šio darbo dalyje buvo analizuojamas tyčinio bankroto turinys, aptarta teismų praktika bei jo reglamentavimas įmonių bankroto įstatyme. Didesnis dėmesys buvo skiriamas LR BK 209 str. analizei. Aptarti nusikalstamo bankroto objektyvieji ir subjektyvieji požymiai, jų reglamentavimas Lietuvoje, išanalizuota sąvoka, kuo pasireiškia - „sąmoningai blogas valdymas“. Antroje šio baigiamojo darbo dalyje buvo aptartos sukčiavimo dispozicijoje suformuluotos keturios alternatyvos veikos, jų padariniai, priežastinis ryšys bei kiti objektyvieji ir subjektyvieji požymiai. Trečioje magistro baigiamojo darbo dalyje dėmesys buvo skiriamas vienai sukčiavimo veikai –turtinės prievolės išvengimui, kuris pasireiškiantis nusikalstamo bankroto metu veikos padarymo būdu – apgaule. Teismų praktikoje pastebima, jogteismams yra sunku inkriminuoti sukčiavimąišvengiant turtinės prievolės, nes nusistovėjusiaiteoriniai klasikinio sukčiavimo praktikai iškyla daug problemų, kaip tinkamai pritaikyti sukčiavimą išvengiant turtinės prievolės. Sunkios ekonominės padėties įmonės vadovas priima sprendimus, dėl kurių bendrovė tampa nemoki ir būtent šito siekia. Šiuo atveju darbe buvo nagrinėjama, kokie kaltininko veiksmai atskleidžia jo norą išvengti turtinės prievolės, koks kaltininko tyčios turinys - ar ji susiformavo būtent tam, kad išvengtų mokėjimų kreditoriams, kokie apgaulės panaudojimo būdai norint išvengti turtinės prievolės, kuri pasireiškia tuo, kad iki bankroto bylos iškėlimo apgaule sukuriama fiktyvi teisinė padėtis, kadbendrovė tampa beturtė, o jau po bankroto procedūros visos skolos yra nurašomos. This {{topic is}} {{relevant}} today, {{because it has}} been noticed that in Lithuania there are increasing number of criminal bankruptcies, whose purpose is not only to profit, but also to avoid accumulated debts exaction. The case – law studies show that when this problem occurs nobody qualifies it as fraud avoiding material obligations, because applying Lithuania’s highest Court theoretical explanation, there appears many problems in practice which prevents applying it. Often there is debate on whether the offense meets all the characteristics of fraud, so this paper analyzes the possibility of additional qualification. When bankruptcy is determined not by failing of business, but by deliberate actions of company which is intermediate consequence, because of poor management occurring bankruptcy status has to be the reason of serious cause damage to the creditors. Given the rate of criminal bankruptcy, we notice that this in this composition the legislators priority was to protect the interests of creditors. Creditor protection of the interests of the debtor's insolvency {{has been the subject of}} legal regulation since immemorial times. Therefore, taking into account the modern criminal law regulation, is no exception. In the Republic of Lithuania Criminal Code Article 209, it is indicated: those who deliberately poorly managed the company, led company to bankruptcy and caused significant property damage to creditors. At the disposal of this articleact defined as "deliberately bad business management", which consequences are company bankruptcy and great material damage to creditors. During this criminal activity, material liability is usually avoided. Therefore criminal bankruptcy may be closely associated with fraud. According to the Republic of Lithuania Criminal Code Article 182, paragraph 1 : those, who gained another’s property or property right by fraud, for his own or another’s benefit, avoided property liability or revoked it. However, to further incriminate the offense it is necessary to identify all the attributes of Criminal Code Article 182 which occur during fraudulent bankruptcy, because during fraudulent bankruptcy the most common violated value of Criminal Code Article 182 through property liability avoidance using deceit, as the method of fraud. In case law, there are defined criteria, which are suitable for classical fraud, therefore in this article I will try to dissociate classical fraud and avoiding property liability. When the company is in a difficult economical position, manager makes decisions on which the company becomes insolvent, and that’s exactly what they seek. In this case, its intentionally formed in order to avoid paying creditors. Avoidance of property liability shows that deception was used which consists in the fact that before the bankruptcy fraudulently creates fictitious legal position that the company would become penniless and it would be unable to be directed, and after the bankruptcy procedures all of the debts are written off. The first part of the thesis analyzed the contents of criminal bankruptcies as well as court of law regulations put into practice in a company‘s bankrupt law. However more attention will be given to the Republic of Lithuania Criminal Code Article 209 analysis. Furthermore the objective and subjective indications of criminal bankruptcy and their regulations in Lithuania with the addition of analyzing how the concept „consciously bad govern rule“ manifests. The second part of the paper will discuss four alternative fraud acts which were formed in the disposition of swindling and will also include their consequences and causal association in addition to other objective and subjective indications. The third part of this master‘s graduate thesis will emphasize on a single fraud act - avoiding material obligations during criminal bankruptcy and also the makings of a criminal deed in a fraud. From the practical experience of the court of law it can be deduced that it is difficult for the court to incriminate the fraud of avoiding material obligations, because the well-established theoretical classical fraud application faces a lot of problems while trying to correctly apply the fraud of avoiding material obligations. While the company is in a poor economical condition the executive of the company has to approve certain decisions which lead to the company becoming insolvent and this insolvency is exactly what they want. In the case described in the thesis it was investigated which actions of the culprit unfold the avoidance of material obligations, furthermore what is the culprits purposive content and if it was formed solely for the reason of bypassing the payment to the creditors. As well as what fraud methods are utilized while avoiding material obligations, this tendency manifests itself in a way so that even before the bankruptcy case begins, a fictitious legal situation is established so that the company would become insolvent thus making it insusceptible to a requisition and after the bankruptcy procedure all these debts are dismissed. According to the scientist O. Fedosiuk, in case of criminal bankruptcy the actions of the perpetrator in all cases should be classified as fraud. In the review of Lithuanian Supreme court it is indicated, that fraud can be imputed together with fraudulent bankruptcy, but you need to analyze what causes the fraud, because fraud without material obligation is not identical to the classic fraud. Applying Lithuania’s Highest Court theoretical explanation, many problems arise in practice preventing it to properly adapt. In order to adjust the composition of criminal bankruptcy fraud cases it is important to analyze the actions of the perpetrator. For example, who makes the fraud in this case – natural or legal person (the question of whether an individual has acquired some kind of material obligation, or it was acquired by legal person, which went bankrupt), what kind of fraudulent content was used, what were the perpetrators objectives and content of intention, whose financial status (natural or legal person) must be assessed to determine property liability avoidance, indicated by deliberate insolvency etc. Therefore these are the reasons, why you can agree or disagree with the interpretation of Lithuanian Highest Court...|$|E

Nagrinėjama individualizavimo, teisingumo principo reikšmė, skiriant bausmę. Analizuojamos teisės aktų nuostatos, reglamentuojančios bausmės tikslus, laisvės apribojimo bausmės skyrimą ir vykdymą, probacijos tarnybų paskirtį taikant šią bausmę. Tiriami praktiniai atvejai, kuomet skiriama laisvės apriojimo bausmė ir kaip užtikrinamas teisingumas – bausmės paskirties įgyvendinimas, taip pat situacijos, kuomet ji keičiama kita bausme (nepavykus įgyvendinti bausmės tikslų), analizuojama statistika ir šios bausmės vieta valstybės teisinėje sistemoje. Europos bausmių politika eina kryptinga linkme mažinant realios laisvės atėmimo bausmės skyrimą nuteistiesiems, taip mažindami kalinių skaičių ir siekdami efektyvios nuteistųjų socializacijos, integracijos į visuomenę, kurie pripažįsta teisinių normų egzistavimą, vykdant bausmę priimtinoje aplinkoje su tam tikrais suvaržymais. Įpareigojimai padeda taisyti elgesį ir požiūrį, daugeliu atveju – įgalūs užtikrinti, bausmės tikslų įgyvendinimą. Buvo analizuojama, kokiu būdu siekiama kiekvieną bendrąjį bausmės tikslą įgyvendinti taikant šią bausmę. Siekiant užtikrinti proporcingumo ir teisingumo principus, dažniausiai asmenims teisiamiems pirmą kartą už ne tokius sunkius nusikaltimus, teismas pagrįstai renkasi laisvės apribojimo bausmės rūšį, taikydamas įpareigojimus ir draudimus, kurie nukreipti į konkretaus asmens elgesio koregavimą. Dažnai susiduriama su problema, kad dalies nuteistųjų ši bausmė neveikia ir tenka keisti griežtesne bausme – areštu, kuri pati kaip bausmė – trumpalaikis sulaikymas nėra veiksminga. Kai bausmė netinkamai vykdoma ar nevykdoma – teismai keisdami bausmės rūšį turi teisę laisvai interpretuoti sąvoką „vengimas“ atlikti bausmę, todėl vertėtų nustatyti labiau apibrėžtus kriterijus, kada probacijos tarnyboms kreiptis dėl bausmės keitimo, nes šiuo metu daugelis teikimų lieka netenkinti. Išanalizavus mokslinę literatūrą, užsienio bei Lietuvos teisės aktus, Lietuvos teismų praktiką, daroma išvada, kad sutartinai daugelyje šalių bausmė nukreipta į: nubaudimą, bendrąją prevenciją ir reabilitaciją, todėl ne tokių sunkių nusikalstamų veikų atvejais galime taikyti bausmę, kuri labiau orientuota į asmens ankstesnio gyvenimo keitimą, imantis realių veiksmų (gydomųjų programų kitos pagalbos, individualizuotų įpareigojimų nustatymo). Nustatyta, kad viena pažangiausių kriminalinių bausmių, veikianti kaip savotiška nuteistųjų resocializacijos priemonė – laisvės apribojimo bausmė, Baudžiamajame kodekse egzistuoja pagrįstai, nes nuteistiesiems teikiant pagalbą ir taikant įpareigojimus galima pasiekti bausmės tikslus, nors ir ne pilna apimtimi, nes neįmanoma užtikrinti absoliutaus bausmės įgyvendinimo visų nuteistųjų atvejais, bet remiantis duomenimis matoma, kad didžioji dalis asmenų įvykdo bausmę pilna apimtimi ir realu tikėtis, jog jos vykdymas padeda padaryti išvadas dėl veiksmų ateityje. The {{aim of the}} Master {{thesis is}} to {{determine}} whether the application of custodial or non-custodial penalty of restriction of liberty is adequate and sufficient measure to achieve the common goals of punishment in various offenses cases, and whether this punishment is effective and reasonably exists in the Criminal Code of the Republic of Lithuania. The thesis analyzes the concept of punishment, the meaning of individualization and equity principles when sentencing. The Master thesis also analyzes the legislative provisions governing the objectives of the penalty established in Article 41 of the Criminal Code, the punishment of restriction of liberty set forth in Article 48 of the Criminal Code and the enforcement provided for in Article 47 of the Penal Code. The thesis provides a comparison of the general objectives of punishment and the objectives of the punishment of restriction of liberty, the thesis analyzes whether all the objectives can be achieved. The thesis studies practical cases in which a penalty of restriction of liberty has been imposed and how it has been enforced, the thesis also studies the situations when such penalty is replaced by another penalty (in case of the failure to implement the objectives of punishment), the Master thesis analyses statistics and the place of this punishment in the state legal system. The aim of the thesis is to answer the question whether the purpose for punishment of restriction of liberty ensures the implementation of the goals of punishment. The European penal policy is going in the purposeful direction towards reducing the punishment of an actual custodial sentence, thus reducing the number of prisoners and seeking the effective socialization of convicted persons and their integration into society. The individuals who recognize the existence of legal norms carry out the punishment in an acceptable environment with certain restrictions, which both help to correct the behavior and attitudes, and are able to ensure the realization of the objectives of punishment. Therefore, the thesis has analyzed the manner in which each of the common purposes of the punishment has been implemented when applying this penalty. In order to ensure the principles of proportionality and fairness, in most cases the court reasonably chooses the types of penalties for restriction of liberty for the accused persons, who are being sentenced for the first time for less serious crimes, by applying obligations and prohibitions directed at the particular individual’s correction and adequate implementation of the punishment goals. The most often problem {{is that some of the}} convicted persons are not affected by this punishment and it has to be replaced by a severe penalty – arrest, which as the punishment - a short-term detention, is not efficient. When the penalty is executed improperly or is not executed at all, changing the type of penalty the courts are free to interpret the concept of “avoidance” to carry out the sentence, therefore it would be advisable to set some more specific criteria based on which the probation service should apply for sentence modification, because currently many submissions remain not satisfied. The analysis of scientific literature, foreign and Lithuanian legislation, case law, leads to the conclusion that in many countries the punishment is directed to: punishment, general prevention and rehabilitation, therefore in cases of less serious offences we can apply a punishment that is more focused on the change of the person's previous life by taking real actions (healing programs, other assistance, determination of individualized obligations). It has been found out that one of the most advanced criminal penalties acting as a sort of re-socialization measure of the convicts - the penalty of restriction of liberty – reasonably exists in the Criminal Code of the Republic of Lithuania because by providing aid and applying obligations to the convicts the punishment goals can be achieved, though not to the full extent, because it is impossible to guarantee the absolute implementation of the punishment in all cases, but the information shows that most of the convicts execute the sentence to the full extent and it is realistic to expect that its implementation helps to draw conclusions for the future actions. Recommendations: in order to ensure that the punishment goals are achieved at the higher extent as possible, that the sentence has a real impact on convicts, it is suggested to establish in the Criminal and Penal Codes that in case of failure to carry out the sentence of restriction of liberty or in case of realizing that it is not effective, or that other measures would be more effective, the prohibitions or restrictions to the convict shall be revised or supplemented, if the obligations are carried out offhandedly, when it is possible to extend their implementation. What is more, to provide the possibility to change the penalty of restriction of liberty into not only arrest, but also into a fine. It is believed that it would be a more effective measure as it has been proven that a short-term arrest is not an effective punishment, while at least some people are concerned about their financial situation, therefore it is likely that they would make a greater effort to dutifully carry out the prohibitions and obligations imposed by the penalty of restriction of liberty. It is also advisable to clearly define the concept of what is considered to be “avoidance” to carry out the penalty of restriction of liberty, including the cases when there are other offenses, which also clearly show that the punishment objectives designed to influence a person to comply with the law cannot be fully achieved if a person is offhandedly looking at the nature of the punishment. It would be useful to establish in the Criminal Code the obligation to participate in the social rehabilitation programs as determined at the discretion of the court, to expand the variety of the existing programs (social - rehabilitation work), such as: emotions and anger management, aggressive behavior, etc. programs for persons convicted of violent crimes in order to prevent the recurrence of crimes. The mere supervision does not help to implement the goals of punishment, there has to be a direct work with convicted persons in order to ensure safe environment for the society in which the sentenced person lives both during the execution time of the sentence and after it...|$|E

Indeed, because of the high spatial concentration and continuous temporal distribution of perfectly preserved fossil marine vertebrate specimens, the Pisco Fm. is classified as a Konservat-Lagerstätte; this term identifies a place or a quarry characterised by exceptional preservation of fossils. Focusing on the sites of Cerro Colorado and Cerro Los Quesos, Ica Desert, Peru, this Thesis aims to understand which mechanisms brought to the formation of the Pisco Lagerstätte and whether the deposition of diatoms contributed to it in any way. Taking into consideration the geology of the area, three hypotheses on the formation of the Pisco Lagerstätte are advanced and investigated in this Thesis: 1) high sedimentation rates: rapid burial is listed in all the paleontology books as the main process that lead to the preservation of fossils. This hypothesis has been already taken into consideration by previous authors as the cause of the formation of the Pisco Lagerstätte. In particular, sedimentation rates of diatom frustules were advocated as responsible for the burial of whale carcasses by these authors. In this Thesis also the hypothesis that volcanic ashes could increase sedimentation rates by enhancing primary production is advanced. 2) anoxic/disossic environment: along the modern eastern Pacific continental margin, high amounts of organic matter produced during upwelling lead to a great consumption of oxygen. In the intermediate waters dissolved oxygen is < 1 ml/L. This same condition may have persisted during the deposition of the Pisco Fm., therefore inhibiting the aerobic decomposition of carcasses on the sea floor. 3) Harmful algal blooms (HABs) : HABs are phenomena known to kill large amounts of marine species. Those blooms are related to different planktonic groups and are known to kill marine organisms either by: a) the production of a large amount of toxins; b) the lowering of dissolved O 2 in the water column (anoxia of the water column). To verify the high sedimentation rates hypothesis, a detailed stratigraphic framework of the sites of Cerro Colorado and Cerro Los Quesos has been carried out, both by means of diatom biostratigraphy and by means of 39 Ar/ 40 Ar ages. Sedimentation rates have been subsequently calculated and discussed. Moreover, because diatomites are often laminated, a lamina-scale study has been carried out on the sediments underlying fossil whales to unravel the seasonality of diatom species deposition and consequently of the water column. This study also provided additional information on yearly sedimentation rates of the Pisco Fm. During the development of both biostratigraphic and lamina-scale studies, particular attention was paid to the identification of potential HABs. Field observations highlighted that most of the fossils at Cerro Colorado and Cerro Los Quesos are wrapped up in carbonatic concretions; analyses revealed that all of them are dolomite nodules. Therefore, a specific investigation on dolomite nodules was undertaken in order to understand whether they {{played a role in the}} formation of the Lagerstätte. Beside the study on the formation of the Lagerstätte, this Thesis aimed to study the role of volcanic ashes deposition on the fertilisation of the ocean surface. Indeed, scientists have recently become aware of the fertilizer role played by volcanic ash: following major volcanic eruptions, airborne volcanic ash may fall onto the ocean surface, where it releases nutrients (NH+ 4, NO- 3, NO- 2, PO 3 - 4, Si) and Fe. The Pisco Fm. is characterized by a great number of ash layers, making the Pisco Fm. a natural laboratory to study this phenomenon in the Neogene. This Thesis aimed to contribute to the development of an investigation method relevant to fossil contexts. Therefore, observations were made both on the field and in the laboratories. The importance of volcanic ashes in increasing primary production takes much more relevance in the general context of this Thesis if this capability is interpreted as the role of ashes in increasing sedimentation rates (therefore further favouring rapid burial of carcasses). Results Results obtained by diatom stratigraphy and tephrochronology converged in stating that the sites of Cerro Colorado and Cerro Los Quesos are late Miocene in age. Results highlight that sedimentation rates in the Pisco Fm. spanned between 19 cm/ka ± 1 to ca. 33 cm/ka (0. 2 mm/a to 0. 3 mm/a). These sedimentation rates are calculated for compacted sediment and can be transformed into ‘real sedimentation rates’ (sedimentation rates for non compacted sediment) applying a compaction factor equal to 60 %; applying this factor, sedimentation rates equal to 32 cm/ka and 55 cm/ka, respectively, are obtained. Taking into account only the yearly sequence of diatom laminae, sedimentation rates reach a peak of 150 cm/ka (1. 5 mm/a) for compacted sediments, equal to a ‘real’ sedimentation rate of 250 cm/ka (2. 50 mm/a). All the listed sedimentation rates are in line with those calculated for Quaternary sediments in high-productivity basins, confirming that sedimentation rates during the deposition of the Pisco Fm. were high but not exceptional. Investigations conducted on laminae were also used to interpret the seasonal stratification that characterised the water column during the deposition of the Pisco Fm. The sequence of terrigenous lamina – Coscinodiscus ooze – mixed lamina (Chaetoceros RS/Thalassionema plus terrigenous material) has been interpreted as the yearly turnover of diatom species in an upwelling environment. The terrigenous lamina represents the austral summer sediment input. Coscinodiscus oozes are the product of the summer flourishing of this genus at the thermo/nutricline and of its subsequent late summer/early autumn sedimentation (the so-called ‘fall dump’) which follows the breakage of the summer water column stratification. The mixed lamina represents the spring bloom. Many clues suggest that sediments of the Pisco were not completely anoxic: 1) the presence of mollusc; 2) the pervasive bioturbations recognised both in the diatom laminae and at the top of tephra; 3) the coupling of fossil vertebrates with dolomite nodules surrounding the fossils themselves. Indeed, if the sediments of the Pisco had been anoxic, due to the high amounts of organic material (diatom cells) exported to the sea floor, dolomite would have precipitated also far from the vertebrate carcasses. On the contrary, dolomite nodules are always coupled to fossils. This means that only in correspondence of the carcasses, oxygen levels were reduced to a point that lead to sulphate-reduction and methanogenesis with consequent precipitation of dolomite. Dolomite nodules have had a pivotal role in preserving the marine vertebrates in the fossils record: rapid dolomitisation prevented the skeletons from being disarticulated and protected bones from chemical and mechanical erosive agents. Therefore fast dolomitisation processes played a pivotal role in the formation of the Pisco Lagerstätte. However, although not exceptional, also high sedimentation rates favoured the complete burial of carcasses under the sea bottom surface, where sulphate reduction, methanogenesis and, consequently complete dolomitisation, were favoured. Sediment porosity, may have favoured rapid burial and dolomitisation of carcasses as well. Indeed, sediment structures underlying some carcasses suggest that carcasses ‘sank’ into the sediment as they arrived at the sea bottom. Finally, I cannot exclude that the high concentration of carcasses in the Pisco Fm. is due to high density of the marine mammal populations in the Pisco Basin during the late Miocene; to answer this question a dedicated study with a more biological approach should be developed. For what the HABs hypothesis is concerned, no evidence harmful diatoms has been found during the development of this Thesis; similarly, the study concerning the enhancing of primary production due to volcanic ashes needs to be further developed and no conclusions can be drawn on at the moment for this hypothesis. As a final statement, I can affirm that the formation of the Pisco Lagerstätte was caused by the concurrence of many diverse ecological factors; however, the geochemical conditions of the sea bottom and high sedimentation rates were certainly two of the most important ones. Dolomite nodules frequently cemented siliciclastic sediments, not only diatomaceous ones, confirming that sedimentation of diatom frustules to the sea floor is to be considered just one of the many factors concurring in the formation of the Pisco Lagersätte, not its principal cause. Obiettivi La Formazione diatomica Mio-Pliocenica di Pisco, in Perù, si è depositata nel bacino del Pisco, uno dei tanti bacini forearc che caratterizzano la costa peruviana, in condizioni di upwelling. Questa formazione è particolarmente popolare tra i paleontologi dei vertebrati grazie al suo contenuto in fossili. Infatti, a causa dell’elevata concentrazione spaziale di esemplari fossili perfettamente conservati e del loro record temporale continuo, la Pisco Fm. è classificata come un Konservat-Lagerstätte; questo termine identifica un luogo o una formazione caratterizzati da un’eccezionale conservazione dei fossili. Ponendo il fuoco sui siti di Cerro Colorado e Cerro Los Quesos (deserto di Ica, Perù), questa Tesi si propone di capire quali meccanismi hanno portato alla formazione del Pisco Lagerstätte e se la deposizione delle diatomee ne abbia in qualche modo favorito la formazione. Prendendo in considerazione la geologia della zona, sono state avanzate e studiate tre ipotesi: 1) alti tassi di sedimentazione: il rapido seppellimento è elencato in tutti i libri di paleontologia, come il processo principale che porta alla conservazione dei fossili. Questa ipotesi è già stata presa in considerazione dai precedenti autori come la causa della formazione del Pisco Lagerstätte. In particolare, è stato ipotizzato che siano stati i tassi di sedimentazione dei frustoli delle diatomee a favorire il rapido seppellimento delle carcasse. In questa Tesi viene avanzata anche l'ipotesi che le ceneri vulcaniche possano aver aumentato la produzione biosilicea incrementando, di conseguenza i tassi di sedimentazione delle diatomee stesse. 2) ambiente anossico / disossico: lungo il moderno margine continentale del Pacifico orientale, elevate quantità di materia organica prodotte a causa dell’upwelling portano ad un grande consumo di ossigeno. Nelle acque intermedi ossigeno disciolto è < 1 ml / L. Questa stessa condizione può essere persistita durante la deposizione della Pisco Fm., inibendo quindi la decomposizione aerobica delle carcasse sul fondo del mare. 3) fioriture algali velenose (Harmful algal blooms, HABs) : gli HABs sono fenomeni noti per uccidere grandi quantità di organismi marini. Tali fioriture sono tipiche di diversi gruppi planctonici e sono note per uccidere organismi marini attraverso: a) la produzione di una grande quantità di tossine; b) l'abbassamento di O 2 disciolto nella colonna d'acqua (anossia della colonna d'acqua). Per verificare l'ipotesi relativi ai tassi di sedimentazione è stato realizzato un dettagliato quadro stratigrafico dei siti di Cerro Colorado e Cerro Los Quesos, sia attraverso la biostratigrafia a diatomee, sia per mezzo delle datazioni 39 Ar / 40 <b>Ar.</b> <b>Si</b> è quindi potuto calcolare e discutere i tassi di sedimentazione per i due siti. Dal momento che le diatomiti risultano spesso laminate, è stato intrapreso uno studio a scala di singole lamine per studiare la stagionalità della deposizione delle diverse specie di diatomee, conseguentemente, dei movimenti verticali a cui era sottoposta la colonna d’acqua. Questo studio, che ha preso in considerazione i sedimenti sottostanti i fossili di balena, ha anche fornito ulteriori informazioni sui tassi di sedimentazione annuali della Pisco Fm. Oltre alle osservazioni sui tassi di sedimentazione, sulle condizioni di ossigenazione del fondo del mare e sugli HABs, osservazioni sul campo hanno evidenziato che la maggior parte dei fossili a Cerro Colorado e Cerro Los Quesos sono avvolti in concrezioni carbonatiche; le analisi hanno rivelato che tutti i noduli sono noduli dolomitici. Pertanto, è stata svolta anche un'indagine specifica sui tali noduli per verificarne l’eventuale influenza sulla formazione del Lagerstätte. Accanto allo studio sulla formazione del Pisco Lagerstätte, in questa Tesi si è tentato di evidenziare il ruolo della deposizione delle ceneri vulcaniche nel fertilizzare la superficie dell’oceano. Recentemente, alcuni studi hanno infatti evidenziato il ruolo di fertilizzante della cenere vulcanica: dopo grandi eruzioni, le ceneri possono cadere sulla superficie dell'oceano, dove rilasciano sostanze nutritive (NH+ 4, NO- 3, NO- 2, PO 3 - 4, Si) e Fe. La Formazione di Pisco. è caratterizzata da numerosi di livelli di cenere, rendendo la Pisco Fm. un laboratorio naturale per studiare questo fenomeno nel Neogene. A riguardo, l’obiettivo di questa tesi è stato quello di sviluppare un metodo di indagine applicabile ai contesti fossili. Pertanto, sono state effettuate osservazioni sui livelli di cenere sia sul campo che in laboratorio. Nel contesto generale di questa tesi, uno studio sulla capacità di fertilizzazione delle ceneri vulcaniche acquista rilevanza se si considera la potenziale influenza di questo fenomeno sull’incremento della velocità di sedimentazione delle diatomee (favorendo quindi ulteriormente il rapido seppellimento delle carcasse). Risultati I risultati ottenuti dalla biostratigrafia a diatomee e dalla tefrocronologia convergono nell'affermare che i siti di Cerro Colorado e Cerro Los Quesos sono di età tardo miocenica. I risultati mettono in evidenza che i tassi di sedimentazione della Pisco Fm. oscillano tra i 19 cm / ka ± 1 e ca. 33 cm / ka (0, 2 mm / a 0, 3 mm / a). Questi tassi di sedimentazione sono calcolati per sedimenti compattati e possono essere trasformati in 'tassi di sedimentazione effettivi' (velocità di sedimentazione per i sedimenti non compattati) applicando un fattore di compattazione pari al 60 %; in questo modo si ottengono rispettivamente tassi di sedimentazione pari a 32 cm / ka e 55 cm / ka. Tenendo conto solo la sequenza annuale di deposizione delle diatomee (studiata attraverso le lamine), i tassi di sedimentazione raggiungono un picco di 150 cm / ka (1, 5 mm / a) per sedimenti compattati, pari a un tasso di sedimentazione 'reale' di 250 cm / ka (2, 50 mm / a). Tutti i tassi di sedimentazione elencati sono in linea con quelli calcolati per sedimenti quaternari in bacini sedimentari ad alta produttività primaria, confermando che i tassi di sedimentazione durante la deposizione del Pisco Fm. erano alti, ma non eccezionali. Le indagini condotte sulle lamine sono state utilizzate per interpretare la stratificazione stagionale che caratterizzava la colonna d'acqua durante la deposizione della Pisco Fm. La sequenza lamina terrigena - Coscinodiscus ooze - lamina mista (Chaetoceros RS / Thalassionema e materiale terrigeno) è stata interpretata come la sequenza annuale di deposizione del sedimenti in un ambiente di upwelling. La lamina terrigena rappresenta l'input di sedimenti nel bacino durante l’estate australe. Gli oozes a Coscinodiscus sono il prodotto della fioritura estiva di questo genere a livello del nutri/termoclino e della successiva deposizione durante la fine dell’estate / inizio autunno (il cosiddetto fenomeno del 'fall dump') che consegue alla rottura della stratificazione della colonna d'acqua. La lamina mista rappresenta infine la fioritura primaverile. Molti indizi suggeriscono che i sedimenti del Pisco non erano completamente anossici durante la deposizione della formazione stessa. Infatti si è osservato: 1) la presenza di molluschi; 2) diffuse bioturbazioni sia nelle laminazioni a diatomee, sia al top dei livelli di ceneri; 3) l'associazione dei vertebrati fossili ai noduli dolomitici che circondano i fossili stessi. Infatti, se i sedimenti del Pisco fossero stati anossici, l’elevata quantità di materia organica (diatomee) esportata al fondo dell’oceano, avrebbe causato la precipitazione della dolomite anche lontano dalle carcasse dei vertebrati. Al contrario, i noduli dolomitici sono sempre associati ai fossili. Ciò significa che solo in corrispondenza delle carcasse i livelli di ossigeno venivano ridotti al punto tale da attivare i processi che causano la precipitazione della dolomite, vale a dire riduzione dei solfati e metanogenesi. Gli studi condotti sui noduli dolomitici hanno rivelato che questi hanno favorito la preservazione dei vertebrati marini nel record fossile: la rapida dolomitizzazione ha infatti inibito la disarticolazione delle scheletri e li ha protetti dagli agenti erosivi, chimici e meccanici, che agiscono sul fondo dell’oceano. Pertanto, i rapidi processi di dolomitizzazione hanno svolto un ruolo fondamentale nella formazione del Pisco Lagerstätte. A questi hanno contribuito gli alti tassi di sedimentazione che, seppur non eccezionali, hanno favorito la completa sepoltura delle carcasse sotto la superficie di fondo del mare, dove hanno luogo riduzione dei solfati e metanogenesi,favorendo, di conseguenza, una rapida dolomitizzazione. La porosità dei sedimenti può aver a sua volta favorito una rapida sepoltura e dolomitizzazione delle carcasse. Infatti, le strutture sedimentarie sottostanti alcune carcasse suggeriscono che queste ‘affondarono’ nel sedimento una volta arrivate sul fondo...|$|E

On the other hand, under the incidence of large Ar cluster ions, the dominant secondary ions were Sin + (2 ≤n≤ 11). It has become clear that the yield ratio of secondary Si cluster ions was determined by the velocity of the incident cluster ions, and this strong dependence of the yield ratio on incident velocity should be related to the mechanisms of secondary ion emission under large Ar cluster ion bombardment...|$|R
40|$|Measurement of the abundances of the nuclei C, N, O, Ne, Mg, <b>Si,</b> <b>Ar,</b> and Ca and {{the group}} Cr-Co {{relative}} to oxygen from seven solar energetic-particle events in the energy range from about 14 to 61 MeV per nucleon with a solid-state detector telescope on the OGO- 5 satellite, 1968 - 1971. The differential energy spectra of O (14 to 29 MeV per nucleon) and Cr-Co (3 to 61 MeV per nucleon) have a spectral index of about (- 3) for a power law in kinetic energy. The relative abundances of C, N, O, and Ne are in excellent agreement with emulsion studies. However, {{when compared with the}} solar photospheric and coronal abundances, the OGO- 5 measurements show a large enhancement of relative abundances beginning with Si, and extending to the Cr-Co group. The enhancement over the solar and universal abundances is in rough agreement with the composition of the galactic cosmic radiation...|$|R
40|$|Four ECR ion {{sources have}} been {{operated}} in National Institute of Radiological Sciences (NIRS). Two ECR ion sources supply various ion species for the Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba (HIMAC). The 10 GHz NIRS-ECR ion source mainly produces C 2 + ions for the heavy-ion therapy. Ions of <b>Si,</b> <b>Ar,</b> Fe, Kr and Xe are usually {{produced by the}} 18 GHz NIRS-HEC ion source for physical and biological experiments. The other two compact ECR ion sources with all permanent magnet configuration {{have been developed for}} the new generation carbon therapy facility. One of these, the Kei-source, is a prototype which has been installed to the NIRS- 930 cyclotron for axial injection. The other source, Kei 2 -source, is a demonstration source and utilized for the new generation Linac. In addition, both Kei sources have been used to study fundamental properties. In this paper, present status of the ion sources and recent developments are reported...|$|R
40|$|In {{spite of}} the high success in {{understanding}} of human cells interaction with bone replacing bioimplants in a human there are still biocompatibly problems. These often are connected with eligible human cells incapability for attachments to the implant surface that influence regeneration of bone tissue. Following the general adhesion theory attachment of the cell to the bioimplant is controlled in particulary by an electrostatic force contributing interaction between the cell and the implant. Generally the electrical communication could be engineered owing to a surface electrical potential of the implant. The potential could be supplied by the both external sources and the surface itself. Hydroxyapatite (HAP) is the popular material for the bioimplants. The technologies that are typically in use to engineer the electrical charge of the HAP employ its electrical polarization due to the external electrical field or because of radiation. In both cases the opposite surfaces of the HAP based implant are acquiring the unlike (in sign) charges. Therefore differently charged implant surfaces could induce cell processes in the opposite directions, that is undesirable. Therefore the considered technologies are restricted. However to reach the uniformity of the electrical charge distribution a reconstruction of the HAP ion subsystem of the entire surface layer could provide polarization vectored from/to the bulk. By this way the uninformety of the charge distribution could be reached. To improve biocompatibility and stability of HAP properties the doping is applied. The article is targeted to demonstrate a possibility of technology for electrically functionalization of the surfaces of differently doped HAP (<b>Ar,</b> Sr, <b>Si)</b> ...|$|R
