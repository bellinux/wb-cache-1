He was a man of considerable intellectual brilliance and one of the finest debaters in the House of Commons. He was the first professional gambler to become Chancellor…” His successor Anthony Barber was much less of a political heavyweight and Heath was able to dictate economic policy.|$|E

2500|$|Prince Henry's {{death was}} widely {{regarded}} as <b>a</b> <b>tragedy</b> <b>for</b> the nation. According to Charles Carlton, [...] "Few heirs to the English throne have been as widely and deeply mourned as Prince Henry." [...] His body lay in state at St. James's Palace for four weeks. On 7 December, over a thousand people walked in the mile-long cortege to Westminster Abbey to hear a two-hour sermon delivered by George Abbot, the Archbishop of Canterbury. As Henry's body was lowered into the ground, his chief servants broke their staves of office at the grave. An insane man ran naked through the mourners, yelling {{that he was the}} boy's ghost.|$|E

2500|$|According to Montefiore, [...] "The {{darkness}} {{began to}} descend upon Yezhov's family where his silly, sensual wife was unwittingly {{to play the}} terrible role of black widow spider: most of her lovers were to die. She herself was too sensitive a flower for Yezhov's world. Both she and Yezhov were promiscuous but by then {{they lived in a}} world of high tension, dizzy power over life and death, and dynamic turmoil as men rose and fell around them. If there was justice in Yezhov's fall, it was <b>a</b> <b>tragedy</b> <b>for</b> Yevgenia and little Natasha, to whom he was a kind father. A pall fell on Yevgenia's literary salon. When a friend walked her home to the Kremlin after a party, she herself reflected that Babel was in danger because he had been friends with arrested Trotskyite generals: 'Only his European fame could save him.' She herself was in greater danger." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{example of}} {{deviance}} {{from the source}} material is how Shakespeare characterises the rule of Antony and Cleopatra. While Plutarch singles out the [...] "order of exclusive society" [...] that the lovers surrounded themselves with – a society with a specifically defined and {{clear understanding of the}} hierarchies of power as determined by birth and status – Shakespeare's play seems more preoccupied with the power dynamics of pleasure as a main theme throughout the play. Once pleasure has become a dynamic of power, then it permeates society and politics. Pleasure serves as a differentiating factor between Cleopatra and Antony, between Egypt and Rome, and can be read as the fatal flaw of the heroes if Antony and Cleopatra is <b>a</b> <b>tragedy.</b> <b>For</b> Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra, the exclusivity and superiority supplied by pleasure created the disconnect between the ruler and the subjects. Critics suggest that Shakespeare did similar work with these sources in Othello, Julius Caesar, and Coriolanus.|$|E
2500|$|Peter Lam, {{chairman}} of Media Asia {{and of the}} Hong Kong Tourism Board, said: [...] "The fact that the film got the prize is <b>a</b> <b>tragedy</b> <b>for</b> Hong Kong's movie industry [...] politics has kidnapped the profession and politicised film-awarding events." [...] Lam added that, from a film investor's perspective: [...] "The movie did not possess the qualities of best film, {{as you can see}} that it was not nominated for best actress or best actor awards, nor was it a blockbuster." [...] Crucindo Hung, former {{chairman of}} the Federation of Motion Film Producers of Hong Kong, criticised the award as [...] "an out-of-your-mind and outrageous decision." [...] Lam further defended his remark from criticism, but earned further rebuke to his statement implying that a wonton noodles shop ought never {{to be able to be}} voted the best restaurant in Hong Kong. Some members of the Chamber of Films said that they would submit a proposal to the Hong Kong Film Awards Association to change the voting mechanism of the awards. [...] Daniel Lam, Chamber of Films member and owner of Universe Films, whose film Little Big Master lost out to Ten Years, said that current voting mechanism [...] "can be easily manipulated to produce an irrational result".|$|E
