30|$|The most {{important}} feature {{is that the}} wire driven mechanism can achieve higher <b>allowable</b> <b>torque</b> density (<b>allowable</b> <b>torque</b> of reduction mechanism [Nm] / weight of reduction mechanism [kg]) comparing to other reduction mechanisms. In case of a gear reduction mechanism, the power can be reliably transmitted. However the output torque is supported by {{one or two of}} the gear teeth, and in order to output high torque, the module of the gear must be large or material of the gear need to have high yield strength which generally makes a mechanism heavy such as steel. The same is true in the case of a timing belt, which can transmit power to a separate axis just like wire. In the case of the wire driven mechanism, strength of wire that transmits torque between pulleys, limits <b>allowable</b> <b>torque.</b> On the side of pulley in which wire wound, since wire tension is attenuated along with winding onto the pulley surface, even plastic material can endure wire tension.|$|E

The present work {{is devoted to}} the problem of {{adjustable}} compliance implementation during the human friendly robots design. A new solution of a compliant joint with passive compliance adjustment based on a leaf torsion spring with variable length is presented. It allows independent positioning and stiffness regulation in a wide range. Some basic characteristics of the leaf torsion spring such as: stiffness, compliance, <b>allowable</b> <b>torque,</b> angle of elastic deformation and generated potential energy are analyzed. Thereafter numerical simulations are performed and the influence of the structural parameters on the basic compliant joint characteristics is estimated. Tests with a specially realized prototype of adjustable compliant joint are carried out and the basic characteristics of the prototype are evaluated. The results from the experimental assessment show a very good correlation with the numerical ones...|$|E
30|$|The biggest {{advantage}} of Smartborer is manifested in its reaction bar design. No other device developed {{so far has}} the reaction bar designed to absorb reaction force with the operator’s leg and/or the ground (Fig.  2). For example, if we assume core sampling at the breast height (1.3  m) with the maximum <b>allowable</b> <b>torque</b> for the device (980  N m), the leg of the operator has to support 754  N (77  kg) of force {{at the lower end}} of the expandable bar (Fig.  2 d). Mechanical increment boring inevitably generates reaction torque equaling to the large driving torque. Trying to support such a strong reaction force by arm can lead to injury of the operator’s arm or wrist, as previously documented (ITRDB Dendrochronology Forum posting on 04 / 21 / 2014 by M. Devall) [12]. Alternatively, such a big reaction force can be absorbed by mounting the power unit on a frame fixed to the tree/ground [10, 11], however, such a frame increases the weight of the system and the assembly/disassembly of the frame takes time.|$|E

The emerging progress will allow the design of new power plants capable of providing a step change in engine fuel burn and noise. As part of the VITAL project a Technoeconomic, Environmental and Risk Assessment tool, the TERA 2020, is being developed.

Sensitivities relating parameters traditionally used to describe component performance, such as <b>allowable</b> shaft <b>torque,</b> low pressure turbine stage loading, fan blade weight and system level parameters have previously been published. The current paper makes an assessment of the impact of failing to deliver specific technology advancements, as researched under the VITAL project.

40|$|In FY 04 - 05, the STScI has {{completed}} five studies on angular momentum management. This report compares {{the results of}} these studies and identifies the maximum <b>allowable</b> solar <b>torque</b> architecture for JWST. This dimensionless parameter, P, is given by a characteristic time (~ sqrt(minimum days between dump*effective visit time in days)) multiplied by the appropriate RMS sunshield torque and divided by the effective wheel capacity. For parameter values P> 0. 5, the STScI cannot reliably execute the nominal JWST mission at 95 % scheduling efficiency while limiting the angular momentum buildup. Even at that level, the STScI must develop procedures and software tools achieve high scheduling efficiency while managing JWST angular momentum and station-keeping fuel. The most recent torque tables, which have higher torques than reported in 2004, coupled with the potential ability to dump every 11 days and run the reaction wheels through zero, result in an architecture parameter, P ~ 0. 43, that lies just below the recommended upper limit...|$|R
40|$|The {{dynamic torque}} of a wind turbine drive train with a direct-driven {{permanent}} magnet synchronous generator is analyzed in this paper. A simplified multi-mass {{model for the}} whole drive train- from the flexible turbine blades to the rotor of the generator- is presented. Dynamic torque is analyzed for both steady state and transient cases. In the mechanical model, torsional electromagnetic forces called “cogging torque ” and “torque ripple ” are used as excitation forces. The magnitude of electromagnetic excitation is highly related to the shape and placement of the magnets. Four different permanent magnet installations are analyzed. It can be noticed that during start-up only cogging torque affects the generator rotor. <b>Allowable</b> cogging <b>torque</b> {{in this case is}} 1. 5 – 2 percent of the rated torque even when the corresponding resonance frequency does not occur in the operational speed range of the wind turbine. Furthermore, it was perceived that the resonance caused by the excitation torque should occur at the lowest possible speed to minimize dynamic torque during the start-up. Several excitations, both cogging torque and torque ripple harmonics, occur in the operational speed range. However, it was detected that the dynamic responses in the operational speed range are not critical to the operation of the wind turbine...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{predictive}} {{digital control}} of the synchronous reluctance motor drive is presented. The proposed control, implemented in rotor coordinates, {{is based on a}} recursive algorithm in which the reference values of d and q current components are imposed. The digital control system directly synthesizes the output vector which allows the timing {{control of the}} inverter by means of on/off state of the switches. This results in avoiding the implementation of the traditional PI controllers and PWM technique. Under transient operation, both the reference d-q current components are set by imposing the maximum <b>allowable</b> <b>torque</b> variation, during the actual sampling interval, taking into account the inverter voltage saturation. In this way, the optimal (fastest) torque trajectory can be followed. The proposed algorithm guarantees optimal torque step response. The d-q current values, corresponding to steady state torque, do not guarantee any other additional condition. Hence, after reference torque is reached, the drive can be controlled by means of an additional predictive algorithm which assures minimum Joule losses. A computer simulation study, using Matlab Simulink tool, is conducted on the drive with the aim of highlighting the good performance of the proposed algorithms compared to traditional and to predictive (not optimal) ones...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{approach}} to investigate the transformation curve of gearing safety. Two types of tooth failures are known to happen to spur gears. There are tooth bending failure (breakage) and tooth surface pitting failure. The focus of this study however {{will be on the}} JGMA and AGMA standards of gearing. Different methods were used to gather relevant data from both standards. JGMA data were gathered from a source in the internet while AGMA data were calculated with the aid of Autodesk Inventor spur gear component generator 2013. The most important data is the <b>allowable</b> <b>torque</b> applied on the gear tooth which can be distinguished into causing either one of the tooth failures mentioned above. Several materials selected from the JGMA and AGMA standards with high value of allowable contact stress compared to its allowable bending stress have a transformation curve from surface durability to bending strength when its torque values are plotted against number of teeth. This allows the forming of a combination threats curve for the material. The curves are useful in determining the maximum torque that can be applied on the spur gear before failures occur. The threat combination curves are then further developed into charts that include other parameters like power, angular velocity and pitch diameters...|$|E

This specification contains the equations {{used by the}} Acme/Stub Acme AutoProgram. All assumptions should be understood and applied in the proper context. In the event of actual test data, the test results {{should be used in}} lieu of these theoretical equations. Designs are to be based at all times on sound engineering practices and judgment.

40|$|Many {{differences}} in postural responses {{have been associated}} with age and Parkinson's disease (PD), but until now there has been no quantitative model to explain these differences. We developed a feedback control model of body dynamics that could reproduce the postural responses of young subjects, elderly subjects, and subjects with PD, and we investigated whether the postural impairments of subjects with PD can be described as an abnormal scaling of postural feedback gain. Feedback gains quantify how the nervous system generates compensatory joint torques based on kinematic responses. Seven subjects in each group experienced forward postural perturbations to seven different backward support surface translations ranging from 3 - to 15 -cm amplitudes and with a constant duration of 275 ms. Ground reaction forces and joint kinematics were measured to obtain joint torques from inverse dynamics. A full-state feedback controller with a two-segment body dynamic model was used to simulate joint kinematics and kinetics in response to perturbations. Results showed that all three subject groups gradually scaled postural feedback gains as a function of perturbation amplitudes, and the scaling started even before the maximum <b>allowable</b> ankle <b>torque</b> was reached. This result implies that the nervous system takes body dynamics into account and adjusts postural feedback gains to accommodate biomechanical constraints. PD subjects showed significantly smaller than normal ankle feedback gain with low scaling and larger hip feedback gain, which led to an early violation of the flat-foot constraint and unusually small (bradykinetic) postural responses. Our postural feedback control model quantitatively described the postural abnormality of the patients with PD as abnormal feedback gains and reduced ability to modify postural feedback gain with changes in postural challenge...|$|R
40|$|The {{possibility}} of increasing overload capability and reducing power loss in a frequency-controlled synchronous electric drive {{operating in a}} continuous periodic mode is considered. A definition of a “continuous periodic mode” is given. A functional diagram of vector control system of synchronous electric drive is presented. The statement of {{a problem in the}} study of electric drives is formulated. A modeling method of a synchronous electric drive making it possible to recognize the maximum loads upon heating of a synchronous motor is described. Results of computer modeling of the continuous periodic operational mode of a salient pole motor with continuous and optimal regulation of armature magnetic flux are presented. The resource of synchronous motor is determined {{on the basis of the}} criterion of motor <b>torque</b> <b>allowable</b> upon heating. A comparative analysis of power loss of synchronous motor in the continuous periodic mode with continuous and optimal regulation of armature magnetic flux is carried out. The conclusion is drawn that the use of optimal regulation of armature magnetic flux in vector control systems of synchronous electric drives operating in continuous periodic mode is efficient. © 2016, Allerton Press, Inc...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Object {{grasping}} {{is commonly}} followed by {{some form of}} object manipulation – either when using the grasped object as a tool or actively changing {{its position in the}} hand through in-hand manipulation to afford further interaction. In this process, slippage may occur due to inappropriate contact forces, various types of noise and/or due to the unexpected interaction or collision with the environment. In this paper, we study the problem of identifying continuous bounds on the forces and torques that can be applied on a grasped object before slippage occurs. We model the problem as kinesthetic rather than cutaneous learning given that the measurements originate from a wrist mounted force-torque sensor. Given the continuous output, this regression problem is solved using a Gaussian Process approach. We demonstrate a dual armed humanoid robot that can autonomously learn force and torque bounds and use these to execute actions on objects such as sliding and pushing. We show that the model can be used not only for the detection of maximum <b>allowable</b> forces and <b>torques</b> but also for potentially identifying what types of tasks, denoted as manipulation affor-dances, a specific grasp configuration allows. The latter can then be used to either avoid specific motions or as a simple step of achieving in-hand manipulation of objects through interaction with the environment. I...|$|R
40|$|Methods {{for resolving}} {{kinematic}} redundancies of manipulators by {{the effect on}} joint torque are examined. When the generalized inverse is formulated in terms of accelerations and incorporated into the dynamics, the effect of redundancy resolution on joint torque can be directly reflected. One method chooses the joint acceleration null-space vector to minimize joint torque in a least squares sense; when the least squares is weighted by <b>allowable</b> <b>torque</b> range, the joint torques tend to be kept within their limits. Contrasting methods employing only the pseudoinverse with and without weighting by the inertia matrix are presented. The results show an unexpected stability problem during long trajectories for the null-space methods and for the inertia-weighted pseudoinverse method, but rarely for the unweighted pseudoinverse method. Evidently a whiplash action develops over time that thrusts the endpoint off the intended path, and extremely high torques are required to overcome these natural movement dynamics.

40|$|Fast {{movement}} along a predefined path {{is important}} for many robot applications, especially in cluster tool robots, requires utilization of the maximum <b>allowable</b> <b>torque</b> range. Robot running along the time-optimal path brings many benefits such as higher productivity. In this paper, moving a delicate object from an initial point to a specified location along a predefined path within the minimum time under a damage-free condition is studied, To achieve this goal, the dynamics of robot is first described as the formulation using arc differential of the predefined path in Cartesian coordinates. Then, the range of acceleration is deducted from the torque limitations, and the method of computing the maximum and minimum acceleration is given. This range can be modified by consideration of the geometrical constraints. Considering the torque constraint on the object, the range of maximum acceleration and velocity are obtained to preserve object safety while the manipulator is carrying it along the curved path. After that, a method to solve the time-optimal problem is presented, and the detailed process is explained. In this way time-optimal trajectory is planned within the maximum allowable range of acceleration and velocity. This algorithm is implemented on a 2 -arm, 2 -dof cluster tool robot and its validity is proven by simulation result.

40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} the design and {{analysis}} for failure at three different drill pipes. When drilling boreholes, for example in the Oil & Gas industry, a hole is drilled into the ground which can be several kilometers long. One of main type of problem that can occur while drilling is the torque on the drill pipe can cause it to break (called twist-off). This problem results in drilling delays. Twist-offs also usually results in loss of expensive equipment. Therefore, ALGOR software has been use as the FEA tool to do the analysis to reduce this problem. Six different values of torque range from 2000 N. m to 3000 N. m {{is applied to the}} end of the pipe stand which is consist of three assembly of pipes. The materials of the pipe have been chosen are AISI 1010, ASTM A 36 and AISI 4150 steels that have different mechanical properties the see the differences. The test results show that AISI 4150 is the most suitable material to use which gives 2800 N. m torque value before it starts to fail. Meanwhile, a constant pattern of failure has determined for these three pipes at the same location of the second engaged thread of the pipe assembly, between the male and female thread at the joint. For improvement, to see the differences from another point of view, the analysis for this drill pipe design is suggested to do with different thickness and length in order to analyze how much the maximum <b>allowable</b> <b>torque</b> value can be applied to the pipe before it starts to fail...|$|E
