40|$|Notwithstanding its {{pivotal role}} in the thought of Indian early grammarians, the exact mean‐ ing of the term śabda remains vague and hard to {{determine}} for an inexperienced student. The di culty is not simply due to polysemy or ambiguity. The <b>ancient</b> <b>user</b> of the term śabda seems entirely unaware of any distinctions within the semantic range of the word, taking its meaning for granted. The objective of the present paper is to investigate various contexts of the word in order to elucidate its meaning as understood by Indian grammarians, with particular emphasis laid on the followers of the śabdādvaita school...|$|E
40|$|Software {{archives}} {{are vital}} parts in long-term preservation strategies of digital artifacts because almost every digital preservation strategy depends on additional software components. At this point a software archive becomes important. Such a repository {{should not only}} store ancient applications and special object dependencies like fonts or required helper tools, but also meta data like operation manuals, license keys and knowledge of operating <b>ancient</b> <b>user</b> environments. This article describes the challenges of establishing and managing software archives and presents a constructive approach which can be integrated in existing preservation frameworks. Furthermore, the suggested approach offers the possibility to interactively ingest software components into the archive and enrich it with sufficient meta data...|$|E
40|$|Architecture {{is perhaps}} one of the most {{important}} elements in the archaeology of Bronze Age Crete. It is employed as the archaeologist’s lens through which this society, its members and its social structures are viewed. While there are certain general laws concerning architecture and its relation to society, an approach is advocated here in which the visual perception of the <b>ancient</b> <b>user</b> is considered to be the key to the interpretation of the architecture. The human perception of architecture is significant in the mode of construction and the subsequent contextualization of a building within the social network. This principle is illustrated with a discussion of the visual impact of the palaces within Minoan society, possibly enhancing their monumentality and their ability to function as a stage for various performances...|$|E

It is the burial place of the <b>Ancient</b> Egyptian <b>User,</b> who was a scribe and steward of king Tuthmosis I during the early eighteenth Dynasty. User's wife was named Bakt.|$|R

When the Legion fought Evillo, two mysterious [...] "new" [...] members, [...] "Sir Prize" [...] and [...] "Miss Terious", (actually Star Boy and Dream Girl) cast a spell that restored her to her true form. It was later revealed that this transformation had been worked by the villainous wizard Mordru.|$|R
5000|$|The {{singing of}} psalms was {{included}} in the synagogue service at the time of Jesus. Early Christians appropriated this tradition, as well as many other elements of synagogue worship. The whole congregation may have sung, or {{there may have been a}} cantor who would sing each verse with the congregation responding by singing [...] "Hallelujah." [...] Such a pattern appears outside the psalms; each song in the obscure early Christian poetry collection known as the Odes of Solomon concludes with a [...] "Hallelujah", indicating a similar liturgical purpose for its <b>ancient</b> <b>users.</b> [...] The Psalms of David formed the core of liturgical music for the early church, to which other songs from the Old and New Testaments (canticles) were added. In addition, early Christians wrote original compositions for singing in worship alongside biblical texts. Soon after the New Testament period, psalmody took a preferred position in the worship of the church. There was some hymn-writing in Eastern churches, but in the West psalms and canticles were used almost exclusively until the time of Ambrose of Milan at the end of the fourth century. Even then, the psalms were never completely replaced by original hymns.|$|R

One {{of the benefits of}} foodways studies is their potential to reach into the domestic realm: how do the daily behaviors of individuals express their personal identity, and how does this relate to changes and expressions of cultural identity in the public realm? This dissertation uses the examination of food and dining in Republican Italy to illuminate the nature of cultural change in central Italy. Methods of studying the cultural effects of Roman contact and conquest have focused primarily on the observations of changes in the public realm: that is, city planning, architecture, and monumentality through inscriptions and art. While such evidence informs our understanding of the cultural associations desired by both individuals and entire cities, these outward displays of cultural affiliation often differ from people’s more private practices. Using two sites in central Italy as case studies, I undertake a systematic morphological examination and use-alteration analysis of ceramics from domestic contexts used for cooking, preparing, and serving food and I compare trends in the use of ceramics to trends in the faunal record from the same locations. I use statistical analyses to compare changing vessel sizes, proportions of vessel types, and associations between different patterns of wear in order to determine how ceramics were being employed by <b>ancient</b> <b>users.</b> I examine changing proportions of animal species, cuts of meat, and processing methods. Through detailed study, it becomes possible to deduce cooking methods and the types of foods being prepared and consumed. I also consider how contemporary Latin authors, all of whom originated from outside of Rome, articulate cultural identity through foodways. I conclude that food behaviors in this period suggest a complexification of Roman Italy over time and I highlight the importance of regional variation and the continuity of local environments. Ultimately, this project nuances how we understand the expansion of Rome in Italy by adding an important dimension to the methods employed in studying inter-cultural contact...|$|R
40|$|For {{the last}} fifteen years the Faculty of Architecture at the University of Roma Tre, has been working on the famous Villa Adriana in Tivoli, {{studying}} its ruins and its ancient paths, in order to better understand how the villa was originally laid out. In this paper, we will talk about one of these studies, which reconnect previous works and creates a new GIS based map of Villa Adriana. The goal {{of this study is to}} create a cultural heritage evaluation. In order to achieve this aim, we have created a multimedia guide with text, drawings, 3 D reconstructions and augmented reality. This work can be summarized in five steps; first of all, a new georeferenced plan was created. This drawing is based on an orthophoto and brings together all existing surveys (from historical drawings to recent surveys). In this new work we show the current status of the ruins and the original layout of Villa Adriana according to the most recent study. The second step was a 3 D survey, with extensive use of photogrammetry to verify and upgrade drawings. The next and third step involved creating the Database, within which to store, edit, analyze, share, and display linked data relating to both ancient and contemporary buildings and pathways. This GIS is based on the new plan and gathers together different orders of information: original function, paving, the old paths of each original user (Hadrian, his wife Sabina, the retinue, guests and servants) as well as the ancient system of underground tunnels. It collects all the existing data relating to Villa Adriana relevant to solving the "what/where" question. The fourth step was to create a complete 3 D model of Villa Adriana. The 3 D reconstruction started from the existing surveys, the documentation of recent excavation and the input of the hypothetical reconstruction of lost or buried buildings. Finally we created a multimedia guide, based on a mobile app, which took information from the database to show, in real time, during the tour, where you are and what you can see around you. With this app it's possible to read information about the villa's original layout, or you can access information about the <b>ancient</b> <b>users</b> (their lives and paths). You can also see 3 D reconstructions of the buildings around you...|$|R
