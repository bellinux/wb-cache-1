5|$|It’s {{a deadly}} time {{in so many}} ways to be in a band; you can have so much control over your work if you’re clever; you can release it how <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> like and in our opinion, right now, Ireland is the healthiest it’s ever been in terms of talent and diversity.|$|E
5|$|Corman later said, I’m {{weary of}} {{prepackaged}} formulas, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> try {{out a new}} idea, you necessarily think about shooting a hackneyed scene {{in a funny way}} without resorting to parody. This wasn’t a parody, it was “Good God, how can I find a different sort of gunslinger?” Right away, I thought of a woman gunslinger, and the idea for the script came to me all of a sudden. It was the sheriff’s wife. He’s killed and she takes over for her husband. It was logical when it wasn’t, but that was enough for a six-or seven-day western.|$|E
5|$|What is a boy? He is {{a person}} who is going to carry on what you have started, to sit where you are sitting <b>and,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> are gone, attend to those things you think are so important. You can adopt all the {{policies}} you please, but how they will be carried on depends on him. Even if you make leagues and treaties, he will have to manage them. He will assume control of your cities and nations. He is going to move on and take over your prisons, churches, schools, universities and corporations.|$|E

They worked on the opera for a week, then Verdi and his wife Giuseppina Strepponi went to Genoa. No more work was done for some time.|$|E

500|$|The {{critical}} {{response to}} Christina Milian was mixed; critics who gave a positive review enjoyed the catchy tracks and lead single [...] "AM to PM", while others {{found that it}} lacked original ideas.

500|$|Gilbert {{was mostly}} {{collaborative}} with Dahl's work, as the writer declared: [...] "He not only helped in script conferences, but {{had some good}} ideas and then left you alone, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> produced the finished thing, he shot it. Other directors have such an ego {{that they want to}} rewrite it and put their own dialogue in, and it's usually disastrous. What I admired so much about Lewis Gilbert was that he just took the screenplay and shot it. That's the way to direct: You either trust your writer or you don't." ...|$|E

500|$|During Agnew's playing career, {{a dispute}} with team-mate Phillip DeFreitas {{attracted}} media attention: when DeFreitas poured salt over Agnew's lunch, Agnew responded by throwing DeFreitas' cricket bag and kit from the dressing room balcony.

500|$|I {{needed to}} {{maintain}} a very strong relationship with Tommy [...] During that period, {{the beginning of their}} end, I had to stay away more than normal from her because she was going through a rough time. She felt that shutting her relationship with Tommy was also a cleansing of who she was. She felt that part of what she was dropping was the shmaltzy pop singer ballad kind of stuff he was adamant about. I had to make my exit and say 'Mariah, you need to redefine yourself, that's fine. I'm here doing what I do and if <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> want to come back and do it again, I'm here.|$|E
