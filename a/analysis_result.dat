50|$|The example {{shows an}} ideal data set: The species data is in rows, samples in columns. For each sample along the gradient, {{a new species}} is {{introduced}} but another species is no longer present. The result is a sparse matrix. Ones indicate {{the presence of a}} species in a sample. Except at the edges each sample contains five species. The plot of the first two axes of the correspondence <b>analysis</b> <b>result</b> on the right hand side clearly shows the disadvantages of this procedure: the edge effect, i.e. the points are clustered {{at the edges of the}} first axis, and the arch effect.|$|E
50|$|Kendall (1971) applied multidimensional scaling to the {{cemetery}} data of Münsingen. The resulting scatterplot showed {{the form of a}} horse-shoe where the graves were arranged on the curve according to their chronological order. Similarly, a mapping of the component scores for the first two axes of the correspondence <b>analysis</b> <b>result</b> will display a parabola if the design styles considered are controlled by one factor only (like chronology). This is called the arch effect by Hill and Gauch (1980). Both Kendall and Jensen & Høilund Nielsen (1997) created artificial data sets to show that the parabola results in ideal circumstances. Therefore, it is recommended inspecting the scatterplot of the first two axes of correspondence analysis to find out if other factors play a role as well (see Examples 2 and 3).|$|E
5000|$|The {{pressure}} {{of a sample}} stream can be lowered by a pressure reducing valve, particularly since many analysers are not designed to withstand high pressure. Such pressure reducing or similar valves {{may be used to}} control the flow rate to the online analyser. If the process pressure is insufficient to allow a sample stream to flow by itself to the analyser, a small pump may be used to move it there. The temperature of a hot sample may be lowered by use of an online sample cooler. The sampling and analysis can be done at the command of an operator, periodically (for example, every 15 minutes), or continuously - providing an <b>analysis</b> <b>result</b> vs. time graph on a chart recorder, computer, or other device. For periodic sampling, valves (or other devices) can be switched open to allow a fluid sample stream to flow to the analyser and shut when not sampling.|$|E

5000|$|Because {{blood flow}} in the brain is tightly coupled to local brain {{metabolism}} and energy use, the 99mTc-HMPAO tracer (as well as the similar 99mTc-EC tracer) is used to assess brain metabolism regionally, {{in an attempt to}} diagnose and differentiate the different causal pathologies of dementia. Meta-analysis of many reported studies suggests that SPECT with this tracer is about 74% sensitive at diagnosing Alzheimer's disease vs. 81% sensitivity for clinical exam (cognitive testing, etc.). More recent studies have shown the accuracy of SPECT in Alzheimer's diagnosis may be as high as 88%. In meta analysis, SPECT was superior to clinical exam and clinical criteria (91% vs. 70%) in being able to differentiate Alzheimer's disease from vascular dementias. This latter ability relates to SPECT's imaging of local metabolism of the brain, in which the patchy loss of cortical metabolism seen in multiple strokes differs clearly from the more even or [...] "smooth" [...] loss of non-occipital cortical brain function typical of Alzheimer's disease. Another recent review article showed that multi-headed SPECT cameras with quantitative <b>analysis</b> <b>result</b> in an overall sensitivity of 84-89% and an overall specificity of 83-89% in cross sectional studies and sensitivity of 82-96% and specificity of 83-89% for longitudinal studies of dementia.|$|E
