The 1997 additions also required bulkers with restrictions (for instance, forbidden from carrying certain types of cargoes) to mark their hulls with large, easy-to-see triangles.|$|E
5|$|A lighter {{alternative}} to the turret, particularly popular with the French navy, was the barbette. These were fixed armored towers which held a gun on a turntable. The crew was sheltered from direct fire, but vulnerable to plunging fire, for instance from shore emplacements. The barbette was lighter than the turret, needing less machinery and no roof armor—though nevertheless some barbettes were stripped of their armor plate to reduce the top-weight of their ships. The barbette became widely <b>adopted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1880s, and {{with the addition of}} an armored 'gun-house', transformed into the turrets of the pre-Dreadnought battleships.|$|E
5|$|Another method <b>adopted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past {{to tackle}} the phumdis was by way of {{diverting}} them towards the Khordak River. However, as this approach had not been very successful, the State Government planned to construct a canal at Tera Khunou Khong Ahanbi to divert the phumdis to Manipur River. Other methods adopted by the Loktak Development Authority (LDA) to control phumdis and water hyacinth include introducing weevils for the biological control of water hyacinth, which {{was carried out in}} collaboration with the Horticulture Institute of Bangalore. Reports have shown this to be an effective method in controlling water hyacinth.|$|E

5|$|As more {{virgin forest}} {{was lost to}} tavy, {{communities}} increasingly planted and cultivated permanent plots of land. By 600CE, groups of these early settlers had moved inland and begun clearing the forests of the central highlands. Rice was originally dry planted or cultivated in marshy lowland areas, which produced low yields. Irrigated rice paddies were <b>adopted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> highlands around 1600, first in Betsileo country in the southern highlands, then later in the northern highlands of Imerina. By the time terraced paddies emerged in central Madagascar over the next century, the area's original forest cover had largely vanished. In its place were scattered villages ringed with nearby rice paddies and crop fields a day's walk away, surrounded by vast plains of sterile grasses.|$|E
5|$|As the Ottoman Empire did {{not force}} Muslim {{conversion}} on its conquered western territories, reformed ideas were quickly <b>adopted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> two-thirds of Hungary they occupied (the Habsburg-ruled third part of Hungary remained Catholic).

5|$|Castles {{continued}} to grow in military sophistication and comfort during the 12th century, leading to {{a sharp increase in}} the complexity and length of sieges in England. While in Ireland and Wales castle architecture {{continued to}} follow that of England, after the death of Alexander III the trend in Scotland moved away from the construction of larger castles towards the use of smaller tower houses. The tower house style would also be <b>adopted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> north of England and Ireland in later years. In North Wales Edward I built a sequence of militarily powerful castles after the destruction of the last Welsh polities in the 1270s. By the 14th century castles were combining defences with luxurious, sophisticated living arrangements and heavily landscaped gardens and parks.|$|E

5|$|Due to Calvin's {{missionary work}} in France, his {{programme}} of reform eventually reached the French-speaking provinces of the Netherlands. Calvinism was <b>adopted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Electorate of the Palatinate under Frederick III, {{which led to}} the formulation of the Heidelberg Catechism in 1563. This and the Belgic Confession were adopted as confessional standards in the first synod of the Dutch Reformed Church in 1571. Several leading divines, either Calvinist or those sympathetic to Calvinism, settled in England (Martin Bucer, Peter Martyr, and Jan Laski) and Scotland (John Knox). During the English Civil War, the Calvinistic Puritans produced the Westminster Confession, which became the confessional standard for Presbyterians in the English-speaking world.|$|E
5|$|Early {{improvement}} {{was carried out}} with the traditional tools, but new technology was increasingly important. Lighter ploughs were adopted, including from 1763 James Small's cast iron and curved mould board.

From 1788 Andrew Meikle's automated threshing mill speeded up {{a vital part of the}} harvesting process. There was increasing regional specialisation.

30|$|As {{the next}} {{generation}} standard of the mobile communications, a long-term evolution (LTE)-Advanced is standardized [1]. LTE-Advanced supports broadband data services with the maximum transmission rate of about 0.1 – 1 Gbps. In a LTE-Advanced, single carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) has been <b>adopt</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> uplink communication, and orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) has been <b>adopt</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> downlink communication [2]. SC-FDMA can achieve a low peak average power ratio (PAPR) compared with OFDMA [3 – 5]. Since a low PAPR of SC-FDMA can reduce the cost and the power consumption of communication, SC-FDMA is suitable transmission method for the uplink communication.|$|R

5|$|Hygrophoropsis was {{originally}} circumscribed in 1888 by German mycologist Joseph Schröter as a subgenus of Cantharellus. It contained a single species, the widespread H.aurantiaca, {{commonly known as}} the false chanterelle. German naturalist Bernhard Studer-Steinhäuslin concluded in 1900 that the fungus was more appropriately placed in the genus Clitocybe, based on its white spores, decurrent gills, and lack of a ring on the stipe. This classification was <b>adopted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early writings of influential mycologist Rolf Singer, who in 1943 proposed that Hygrophoropsis should be a subgenus of Clitocybe.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the pocket}} boroughs {{abolished}} by the Reform Act belonged to the Tory Party. These losses were somewhat offset by {{the extension of the}} vote to tenants-at-will paying an annual rent of £50. This clause, proposed by the Tory Marquess of Chandos, was <b>adopted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House of Commons despite opposition from the Government. The tenants-at-will thereby enfranchised typically voted as instructed by their landlords, who in turn normally supported the Tory party. This concession, together with the Whig Party's internal divisions and the difficulties faced by the nation's economy, allowed the Tories under Sir Robert Peel to make gains in the elections of 1835 and 1837, and to retake the House of Commons in 1841.|$|E
