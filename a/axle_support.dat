50|$|In 1993, the S2 {{received}} some cosmetic updates, including new AVUS style alloy wheels, elipsoid beam (projector) headlamps and clear front indicator lenses. This {{coincided with the}} introduction of the five-door S2 Avant, along with a limited run of four-door S2 sedan models, of which 306 were produced. The S2 saloon and Avant are actually based on the next generation B4 platform, and feature a lot of similarities in the rear <b>axle</b> <b>support</b> system to the later B5 A4 quattro. The B4 platform S2 Avant was also used between 1993 and 1995 as the basis for Audi's RS2 Avant super-sports estate, which was modified for Audi with assistance from Porsche.|$|E
50|$|The Nieuport NiD 48 was {{designed}} for a French 1926 light fighter competition. Unlike many Nieuport designs of the period {{it was not a}} sesquiplane but a monoplane, its wing mounted like those of the sequiplanes over the fuselage in parasol wing configuration. It looked much like a NiD 42 with its ancillary wing removed but had smaller dimensions and only was half the loaded weight. It had a straight-edged, parallel chord wing with blunt tips, full span ailerons with slightly curved trailing edges and a small cutout in the trailing edge over the cockpit for better pilot visibility. As on the NiD 42, the wing was braced with Y-form struts from the undercarriage <b>axle</b> <b>support</b> structure, assisted by a cabane of two transverse inverted Vs from the fuselage in front of the cockpit.|$|E
50|$|The major {{disadvantage}} {{of the multiple}} sprocket freewheel design is that the drive-side bearing is located inboard of the freewheel, and as sprockets were added over time, moved the bearing farther from the drive-side <b>axle</b> <b>support.</b> This resulted in more flexing stress being placed on the axle, which can bend or even break. Multiple speed freewheels were common on quality high end bikes until the late 1980s. Suntour — Maeda Industries (Japan) introduced a compact 6 speed freewheel which reduced the spacing between the sprockets and was the same width as a standard 5 speed freewheel but required a narrower chain than the standard. The concept was copied by European freewheel manufacturers Regina (Italy) and Maillard (France). As the number of sprockets on a multiple freewheel increased clusters became physically wider, the freehub design overcame the axle/bearing problem with threaded hubs and began to supersede the freewheel design. Today it is rare to find a freewheel on a new bicycle with more than seven speeds. Some new single-speed — especially BMX and utility bikes — and lower-end multi-geared bicycles continue to be manufactured and sold with freewheels.|$|E

50|$|Millat Tractors was {{initially}} incorporated as Rana Tractors and Equipment Limited to import and market Massey Ferguson Tractors. In 1965, facilities {{were created in}} Karachi to assemble tractors from semi knocked down kits. In 1967, operations were shifted from Karachi to Lahore and in 1972, under the Economic Reforms Order, the company was nationalized and started assembling and marketing tractors {{on behalf of the}} Pakistan Tractor Corporation (PTC). In 1980, the Government decided on indigenization of the tractors and entrusted this task to Pakistan Tractor Corporation. Pakistan Tractor Corporation transferred this role of indigenization in 1981 to Millat Tractors Limited. In just one year, the company took a giant step towards self-sufficiency by setting up the first engine assembly plant in Pakistan. In 1984, sophisticated manufacturing facilities for the machining of intricate components were set up. These were previously not available in Pakistan. Currently, critical components like the engine block, sump, transmission case, axle housing, hydraulic lift cover, front <b>axle</b> <b>support</b> and center housing are all being machined successfully in-house at Millat Tractors from locally sourced castings. In 1992, the company was privatized, and Millat Tractors plant started its in house production. The establishment of this modern plant not only increased production capacity to 16,000 tractors per year on a single-shift basis. In the 2007-2008 financial year, production shot up to 27,260 tractors, the highest sales of tractors ever in Pakistan for any company at the time.|$|E
40|$|Computational and {{experimental}} methods {{were applied to}} the design and optimization of a semitrailer <b>axle</b> <b>support</b> subjected to fatigue loads. Numerical results based on the finite element method (FEM) were correlated with extensometric tests to assess {{the accuracy of the}} computational method. This paper is focused on the “minimum radius manoeuvre. ” This situation represents the highly critical load case occurring in a semitrailer operation where the tractor vehicle pulls the semitrailer's kingpin at approximately 90 ° with respect to its longitudinal axis, and high stress and strain phenomena take place in the axle supports’ structure. Loads and boundary conditions that correspond to this load case were first adjusted by means of experimental tests and could be later applied to each semitrailer <b>axle</b> <b>support</b> in the numerical model. In this analysis, the stress-strain elastic-plastic curves of the base material, the welding, and the HAZ have been incorporated to the numerical models. Fatigue S-N curves combined with the maximum Von Mises equivalent stresses obtained in the computational analysis provided a maximum number of cycles that the semitrailer <b>axle</b> <b>support</b> could reach in case of the minimum radius manoeuvre being applied to the vehicle in a repeated manner.

40|$|A robotic dog toy {{designed}} to help those with limited mobility play with their beloved pets. They say dog is man’s best friend; for the elderly this is exceptionally true. Finding a way to allow those who have pets but are unable to interact with them do to limited mobility is the whole goal of the Stray Pooch Dog Toy. The Stray Pooch Toy itself comprises of micro-controllers, two hobby motors, a gearbox, and a single <b>axle</b> <b>support</b> frame. To {{be included in the}} overall process is the XBee transmitter and receiver set; this allows the toy to be controlled by a laptop or desktop computer system. For the software, there are two programs: one for the micro-controller and the other for the computer to send commands to the ball via the XBee set (i. e. push the “s” button for forward movement and the “w” button for the opposite direction). It is the idea that this new concept of interacting with a dog will work on an acceptable level given the right breed combination, (meaning the size of toy is not intimidating to the dog,) and some encouragement from the dog’s owner. Interest in the Stray Pooch design has been addressed among family and friends of the designers and improvements have been acknowledged and not yet implemented based on the comments provided to the designers...|$|E
40|$|The rachis is {{a complex}} {{cinematic}} system, constituted by a series linked of anfiartrosis that joins to the chains of abarthrosis of the superior and inferior limbs to guarantee the static activity and dynamics of the trunk and the general mobility of the human body.
