Data were collected from 127 working professional employed on at least a part-time (20 hours per week) basis. Results of an exploratory factor analysis retained 24 items and indicated that the WAI consists of three underlying factors. The WAI subscale and total scores showed adequate internal consistency reliabilities. Convergent and discriminant validity was initially supported by the relationship between WAI scores, <b>an</b> <b>existing</b> <b>measure</b> of workaholism, and social desirability.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to {{validate}} the Work Addiction Inventory (WAI). The WAI is designed to assess individuals' addiction to work via self-report. Data were collected from 244 working professionals employed on at least a part-time (20 hours per week) basis. Results failed to replicate the three factor model found in the initial validation study (Bryan, 2009). A follow up exploratory factor analysis on {{the first half of the}} sample retained 15 items and suggested that the WAI consists of two underlying factors.

This novel measure is relevant for shared frailty models.

We introduce a method of estimation and standard errors for this measure. We discuss its properties and compare it to <b>an</b> <b>existing</b> <b>measure</b> of association applicable to current status data. Small sample performance of the measure in realistic scenarios is investigated using simulations.

The results indicated that the internal consistency of the HIT-IDs was acceptable, and the test-retest reliability was good. The HIT-IDs discriminated well between offenders and non-offenders, and as expected, correlated positively with a measure of moral development and negatively with a measure of empathy.

40|$|Discriminatory {{related party}} {{transactions}} (DRPTs) are non-arm’s length transactions with related parties of controlling shareholders for private benefit {{at the cost of}} other shareholders. This is a governance issue between controlling shareholders and minority shareholders in both developed and developing countries. However, most studies on DRPTs are in developed countries with the few exceptions of studies in China, India and Mexico. In 2006, listed companies in Bangladesh were subjected to corporate governance reforms through an order issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Bangladesh. The reforms have potential to curb DRPTs. However, prior studies on the effectiveness of corporate governance reform in protecting minority shareholders from DRPTs in a developing country have been limited. Considering the limited research on DRPTs, this thesis develops two objectives. The first objective is to develop a new improved measure for DRPTs. The second objective of the thesis is to investigate the effectiveness of Bangladesh’s 2006 reforms for protecting minority shareholders from DRPTs. This thesis develops and tests a measure that seeks to distinguish the proportion of transactions in total RPTs that is discriminatory from the proportion that is based on legitimate business motives. Type 1 and Type 2 error rates and power of the new measurement are compared with <b>an</b> <b>existing</b> <b>measure</b> using computer simulated and real data. The capital market sensitivity of the new measure is also tested and compared with <b>an</b> <b>existing</b> <b>measure.</b> The new measure is found to be superior to the <b>existing</b> <b>measure.</b> The thesis also reveals the perspectives of key players about flaws in the selection of independent directors and inexperience of independent directors in their role. It finds that most of the independent audit committee members are either retired bureaucrats or academics and many independent directors do not speak out to protect minority shareholders’ interests mainly because of their friendly relationship with the chair or controlling shareholders group who recruited him/her to the board. The result of the thesis suggests that a lack of accounting education and experience hinders the audit committee’s activities. It further reveals that independent directors are motivated to learn the job in concern for their social reputation. This motivation does indicate potential improvement in their performance over coming years. The inference from the findings is that independent directors in Bangladesh are currently in learning phase and have the potential to become effective in protecting minority shareholders from DRPTs in the future...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE:  In the {{treatment}} research literature on other psychological disorders, {{there is a}} move towards session-by-session symptom measurement. The necessary measures need to be brief, focused on core features since the last session, and readily available to clinicians. There is no measure in the eating disorders that meets those criteria. This research reports the development and validation of such a self-report questionnaire. METHOD:  The authors generated and refined a brief set of attitudinal and behavioral items. The resulting questionnaire (the ED- 15) and <b>an</b> <b>existing</b> <b>measure</b> (Eating Disorders Examination-Questionnaire; EDE-Q) were completed by a large nonclinical adult sample (N[*]=[*] 531), a group of self-reported eating disorder sufferers (N[*]=[*] 63), {{and a group of}} women (N[*]=[*] 33) diagnosed with bulimia nervosa or atypical bulimia nervosa and undertaking cognitive-behavioral therapy. RESULTS:  Factor analysis identified two scales (Weight and Shape Concerns; Eating Concerns), with strong internal consistency and test-retest reliability. Correlations with the EDE-Q (r[*]=[*] 0. 889) indicates that the ED- 15 and EDE-Q measure near-identical constructs. The ED- 15 differentiated self-reported eating-disordered and nonclinical groups to the same degree as the longer EDE-Q. Session-by-session analysis of the CBT treatment group demonstrated that the different ED- 15 scales changed in different patterns across therapy. DISCUSSION:  The ED- 15 is not proposed as <b>an</b> alternative to <b>existing</b> <b>measures,</b> but as <b>a</b> complementary tool, used to measure session-by-session change for clinical and research purposes. Future research will track changes in ED- 15 scores across therapy, to determine the importance of very early response to therapy and sudden changes. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

40|$|Introduction: For {{survival}} data {{the coefficient of}} determination cannot be used to describe how good a model fits to the data. Therefore, several measures of explained variation for {{survival data}} have been proposed in recent years. Methods: We analyse <b>an</b> <b>existing</b> <b>measure</b> of explained variation with regard to minimisation aspects and demonstrate {{that these are not}} fulfilled for the measure. Results: In analogy to the least squares method from linear regression analysis we develop a novel measure for categorical covariates which is based only on the Kaplan-Meier estimator. Hence, the novel measure is a completely nonparametric measure with an easy graphical interpretation. For the novel measure different weighting possibilities are available and a statistical test of significance can be performed. Eventually, we apply the novel measure and further measures of explained variation to a dataset comprising persons with a histopathological papillary thyroid carcinoma. Conclusion: We propose a novel measure of explained variation with a comprehensible derivation as well as a graphical interpretation, which may be used in further analyses with survival data...|$|R
