25|$|Lipid {{formulations}} of <b>amphotericin</b> B are usually recommended instead of <b>amphotericin</b> B deoxycholate {{because of a}} better adverse-effect profile. <b>Amphotericin</b> B {{can be used for}} severe infection during pregnancy. For children with disseminated or severe disease, <b>amphotericin</b> B deoxycholate can be used initially, followed by itraconazole.|$|E
25|$|Conventional <b>amphotericin</b> B desoxycholate (AmB: {{used since}} the 1950s {{as a primary}} agent) {{is known to be}} {{associated}} with increased drug-induced Nephrotoxicity (Renal toxicity) impairing Renal function. Other formulations have been developed such as lipid soluble formulations to mitigate such side-effects as direct proximal and distal tubular cytotoxicity. These include liposomal <b>amphotericin</b> B, <b>amphotericin</b> B lipid complex such as Abelcet (brand) <b>amphotericin</b> B phospholipid complex also as AmBisome Intravenous, or Amphotec Intravenous (Generic; <b>Amphotericin</b> B Cholesteryl Sul) and, <b>amphotericin</b> B colloidal dispersion, all shown to exhibit a decrease in nephrotoxicity. The later was not as effective in one study as <b>amphotericin</b> B desoxycholate which had a 50% murine morbidity rate versus zero for the AmB colloidal dispersion.|$|E
25|$|Clinical infections due to Sporobolomyces salmonicolor {{are rare}} {{and there are}} {{currently}} no standard therapies for infection. Treatment with <b>amphotericin</b> B alone, and <b>amphotericin</b> B followed by either ketoconazole or fluconazole have been successful. In one case of endophthalmitis (mentioned in case report below), treatment with voriconazole was likewise successful. A small number of isolates however demonstrate resistance to fluconazole and micafungin.|$|E
25|$|In case of sporotrichosis meningitis, {{the patient}} {{may be given}} a {{combination}} of <b>Amphotericin</b> B and 5-fluorocytosine/Flucytosine.|$|E
25|$|Leishmania braziliensis :Treatment with {{pentavalent}} antimonials or <b>amphotericin</b> is necessary, {{because of}} the risk of developing disfiguring mucocutaneous lesions.|$|E
25|$|The World Health Organization {{has gotten}} a reduced cost for {{liposomal}} <b>amphotericin</b> B at $18 a vial, but many vials may be needed for treatment {{and it must be}} kept cool.|$|E
25|$|In some countries, such as Switzerland, {{flucytosine}} {{has been}} licensed to treat cats, dogs and birds (in most cases together with <b>amphotericin</b> B) {{for the same}} indications as in humans.|$|E
25|$|Serious {{fungal infections}} may occur {{in those who}} are immunocompromised. These people benefit from {{combination}} therapy including flucytosine, but the incidence of side-effects of a combination therapy, particular with <b>amphotericin</b> B, may be higher.|$|E
25|$|Flucytosine may {{increase}} the toxicity of <b>amphotericin</b> B and vice versa, although the combination may be life-saving and should be used whenever indicated (e.g., cryptococcal meningitis). The cytostatic cytarabine inhibits the antimycotic activity of flucytosine.|$|E
25|$|For visceral {{leishmaniasis}} in India, South America, and the Mediterranean, liposomal <b>amphotericin</b> B is the recommended treatment {{and is often}} used as a single dose. Rates of cure with a single dose of <b>amphotericin</b> have been reported as 95%. In India, almost all infections are resistant to pentavalent antimonials. In Africa, a combination of pentavalent antimonials and paromomycin is recommended. These, however, can have significant side effects. Miltefosine, an oral medication, is effective against both visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis. Side effects are generally mild, though it can cause birth defects if taken within 3 months of getting pregnant. It {{does not appear to}} work for L. major or L. braziliensis.|$|E
25|$|The {{treatment}} of choice for visceral leishmaniasis acquired in India is now <b>Amphotericin</b> B in its various liposomal preparations. In East Africa, the WHO recommended treatment is SSG (sodium stibogluconate and paromomycin) developed by Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi)in 2010.|$|E
25|$|The {{conventional}} treatment method is an intravenous injection with antimony compounds, such as pentostam. Unfortunately, these chemotherapeutics are so poisonous that about 15% {{of the patients}} die from the treaments. To compound the situation, drug resistance has evolved in the parasites against the traditional antimonials. According to rough estimates, about 40% of patients in India are already resistant to this therapy. Another antimicrobial drug <b>amphotericin</b> B is also commonly used. Liposomal <b>amphotericin</b> B (L-AmB) has been a drug of choice in India, but is practically useless in Africa because of low effectiveness in the African strain of the parasite. Further, <b>amphotericin</b> B has severe adverse effects. Its acute effects includes nausea, vomiting, rigors, fever, hypertension or hypotension, and hypoxia, and its chronic effect is nephrotoxicity. In 1999 an anticancer drug miltefosine was demonstrated to be highly effective (95% cure rate) among Indian patients. This {{was the first time}} an oral drug is effective for visceral leishmaniasis. Clinical trials showed that the new drug is relatively harmless. The most adverse effects were only vomiting and diarrhoea in 20â€“28% patients, which were rather mild. The drug has been officially approved in India. The recommended dosage is 100mg per day over a period of four weeks.|$|E
25|$|Flucytosine, {{also known}} as 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC), is an {{antifungal}} medication. It is specifically used, together with <b>amphotericin</b> B, for serious Candida infections and cryptococcosis. It may be used by itself or with other antifungals for chromomycosis. Flucytosine is used by mouth and by injection into a vein.|$|E
25|$|Efforts {{to prevent}} infections {{of the mouth}} {{include the use of}} {{chlorhexidine}} mouth wash in those with poor immune function and washing out the mouth following the use of inhaled steroids. Little evidence supports probiotics for either prevention or treatment even among those with frequent vaginal infections. For infections of the mouth, treatment with topical clotrimazole or nystatin is usually effective. By mouth or intravenous fluconazole, itraconazole, or <b>amphotericin</b> B may be used if these do not work. A number of topical antifungal medications may be used for vaginal infections including clotrimazole. In those with widespread disease, an echinocandin such as caspofungin or micafungin is used. A number of weeks of intravenous <b>amphotericin</b> B may be used as an alternative. In certain groups at very high risk, antifungal medications may be used preventatively.|$|E
25|$|In vitro {{antifungal}} susceptibility {{tests of}} the entire genus Apophysomyces have revealed that <b>amphotericin</b> B and posaconazole are the most effective against A. variabilis infections when compared to itraconazole, ravuconazole, and voriconazole. Testing data has also showed that caspofungin and anidulafungin are inactive antifungal agents against all strains of the genus Apophysomyces.|$|E
25|$|Mohan Mishra is an Indian physician, {{known for}} his studies on Visceral leishmaniasis, (Kala Azar) and its {{treatment}} using <b>Amphotericin</b> B, regarded by many as a pioneering attempt. The Government of India honoured him, in 2014, with the award of Padma Shri, the fourth highest civilian award, for his contributions to the fields of medicine.|$|E
25|$|Both <b>amphotericin</b> B and {{doxorubicin}} {{have been}} investigated as potentially effective against CJD, but as {{yet there is no}} strong evidence that either drug is effective in stopping the disease. Further study has been taken with other medical drugs, but none are effective. However, anticonvulsants and anxiolytic agents, such as valproate or a benzodiazepine, may be administered to relieve associated symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that posaconazole has in vitro {{activity}} similar to that of <b>amphotericin</b> B and itraconazole; therefore, it shows promise as an alternative therapy. However, voriconazole susceptibility varies. Because the correlation between in vitro data and clinical response has not been demonstrated, there is insufficient evidence to recommend either posaconazole or voriconazole for treatment of sporotrichosis at this time.|$|E
25|$|This species shows {{elevated}} {{resistance to}} antifungal drugs; however, four classes of drugs (itraconazole (a triazole), voriconazole, caspofungin and <b>amphotericin</b> B) demonstrate fungicidal effectiveness {{that is most}} pronounced in combination. One promising regimen combines voriconazole and caspofungin. Although disseminated infection carries a high mortality rate, the response of skin to treatment varies depending {{on the degree of}} drug susceptibility exhibited by the particular strain.|$|E
25|$|Leishmaniasis can {{be partly}} {{prevented}} by sleeping under nets treated with insecticide. Other measures include spraying insecticides to kill sandflies and treating {{people with the}} disease early to prevent further spread. The treatment needed is determined by where the disease is acquired, the species of Leishmania, {{and the type of}} infection. Some possible medications used for visceral disease include liposomal <b>amphotericin</b> B, a combination of pentavalent antimonials and paromomycin, and miltefosine. For cutaneous disease, paromomycin, fluconazole, or pentamidine may be effective.|$|E
25|$|Where {{available}} and tolerated by the patient, antifungal drugs are indicated {{as the primary}} treatment of sporotrichosis. For cutaneous infection itraconazole or terbinafine are the primary treatment with fluconazole being recommended if primary antifungals are not well-tolerated. When infection is disseminated throughout the body, <b>Amphotericin</b> B is the drug of choice. To completely clear the fungus, the course of treatment generally lasts from 3 to 6 months. In vitro susceptibility to antifungal drugs {{has been shown to}} be dependent on the growth phase (hyphal or yeast) of the fungus.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, several {{compounds}} (antifungals, fungicides, and biocides) where {{shown to}} effectively inhibit {{the growth of}} P.destructans including benzalkonium chloride, chloroacetoxyquinoline, chloroxine, ciclopirox olamine, econazole, phenylmercuric acetate, pyrithione zinc and sulconazole. The same study showed that P.destructans was sensitive to <b>Amphotericin</b> B, itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole and voriconazole, while the fungus had some resistance to anidulafungin, caspofungin, flucytosine and micafungin. A recent study (2014) identified several volatile organic compounds (benzaldehyde, benzothiazole, decanal, nonanal, N,N-dimethyloctylamine, and 2-ethyl-1-hexanol) that were previously identified from fungistatic soils, which demonstrated inhibition of both mycelial extension and growth from conidia.|$|E
25|$|Mishra's {{studies on}} Visceral {{leishmaniasis}} are {{considered by many}} as his most notable contribution. Leishmaniasis, the second largest parasitic killer after Malaria and known locally as Kala Azar, was a common disease in the area and, after extensive research funded by the World Health Organization, Dr. Mishra proposed the use of <b>Amphotericin</b> B (Fungizone) to combat the disease through an article he published in Lancet in 1991. The proposal {{is regarded as a}} pioneering one and the drug is the one most commonly used the world over to treat Kala Azar.|$|E
25|$|In 2002 a small {{outbreak}} of systemic E. dermatitidis infection occurred in North Carolina hospitals, involving five women who received steroid injections for pain management. In one of women the infection wasn't evident until 152 days after injection of the contaminated solution. Isolates from these patients were {{found by the}} FDA to be susceptible to all of voriconazole, itraconazole, and <b>amphotericin</b> B. In one patient the infection caused sacroiliitis, while the remaining four developed meningitis. Meningitis eventually caused death in one patient, while voriconazole was successful in treating infection in the four other patients. The outbreak was traced back to a single compounding pharmacy, which was found by the FDA to have inadequately controlled for sterility of its products.|$|E
25|$|Flucytosine by {{mouth is}} used for the {{treatment}} of serious infections caused by susceptible strains of Candida or Cryptococcus neoformans. It can also be used for the treatment of chromomycosis (chromoblastomycosis), if susceptible strains cause the infection. Flucytosine must not be used as a sole agent in life-threatening fungal infections due to relatively weak antifungal effects and fast development of resistance, but rather in combination with <b>amphotericin</b> B and/or azole antifungals such as fluconazole or itraconazole. Minor infections such as candidal cystitis may be treated with flucytosine alone. In some countries, treatment with slow intravenous infusions for no more than a week is also a therapeutic option, particular if the disease is life-threatening.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} aspect of treatment is improving denture hygiene, i.e. removing the denture at night, cleaning and disinfecting it, and storing it overnight in an antiseptic solution. This is important as the denture is usually infected with C. albicans which will cause re-infection if it is not removed. Substances which are used include solutions of alkaline peroxides, alkaline hypochlorites (e.g. hypochlorite, which may over time corrode metal components of dental appliances), acids (e.g. benzoic acid), yeast lytic enzymes and proteolytic enzymes (e.g. alcalase protease). The other aspect of treatment involves resolution of the mucosal infection, for which topical antifungal medications are used (e.g. nystatin, <b>amphotericin,</b> miconazole, fluconazole or itraconazole). Often an antimicrobial mouthwash such as chlorhexidine is concurrently prescribed. Possible underlying disease (diabetes, HIV) should be treated where possible.|$|E
25|$|Mucormycosis is {{commonly}} contracted via inhalation of spores resulting in rhinocerebral and pulmonary mucormycoses but infection with Apophysomyces variabilis is contracted cutaneously. Apophysomyces species cause infections {{of the skin}} and soft-tissue following injuries such as burns, automotive accidents, surgeries, and injections both intramuscular and subcutaneous. Cutaneous mucormycosis is acquired when the sporangiospores from contaminated soil and water {{come into contact with}} broken skin. For this reason, disease is seen in burn patients, injured persons, and injection-drug users. The infection may take clinical forms such as necrotizing fasciitis, cerebritis, rhinoorbital infections, and kidney infections. Successful treatment depends on early detection of infection, surgical debridement of necrotic tissues, and anti-fungal therapy with drugs such as posaconazole and <b>amphotericin</b> B. Members of the order Mucorales generally infect immunocompromised patients but A. variabilis infections tend to occur in immunocompetent healthy hosts.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Amphotericin</b> B is {{the most}} potent {{antifungal}} drug available to treat mucormycosis. When given intravenously in the deoxycholate form, <b>amphotericin</b> B is associated with toxic side effects. For this reason, it is often replaced with liposomal <b>amphotericin</b> B, a lipid-based formulation with fewer adverse side effects. Treatment of A. variabilis infections usually involves aggressive antifungal therapy and often surgical removal of necrotic tissue. In mouse models of infection, posaconazole has shown efficacy both in vivo and in vitro. <b>Amphotericin</b> B may {{also be used to}} reduce fungal load. In the mouse study, both drugs decreased the amount of hyphae in infected tissues but posaconazole had better survival outcomes than <b>amphotericin</b> B.|$|E
2500|$|Antibiotics (i.e. aminoglycoside, <b>amphotericin,</b> pentamidine, gentamicin, tobramycin, viomycin) block {{resorption}} in {{the loop}} of Henle. 30% of patients using these antibiotics have hypomagnesemia.|$|E
2500|$|This {{antifungal}} {{medication is}} delivered intravenously. [...] Many patients, however, cannot tolerate <b>Amphotericin</b> B {{due to its}} potential side effects of fever, nausea, and vomiting.|$|E
2500|$|On the whole, oral {{fluconazole}} and intravenous <b>amphotericin</b> B {{are used}} in progressive or disseminated disease, or in immunocompromised individuals. <b>Amphotericin</b> B {{used to be the}} only available treatment, although now there are alternatives, including itraconazole or ketoconazole may be used for milder disease. Fluconazole is the preferred medication for coccidioidal meningitis, due to its penetration into CSF. Intrathecal or intraventricular <b>amphotericin</b> B therapy is used if infection persists after fluconazole treatment. Itraconazole is used for cases that involve treatment of infected person's bones and joints. The antifungal medications posaconazole and voriconazole have also been used to treat coccidioidomycosis. [...] Because the symptoms of valley fever are similar to the common flu and other respiratory diseases, it is important for public health professionals {{to be aware of the}} rise of valley fever and the specifics of diagnosis. [...] Greyhound dogs often get valley fever as well, and their treatment regimen involves 6â€“12 months of Ketoconazole, to be taken with food.|$|E
2500|$|A {{diagnosis}} of E. dermatitidis {{infection of the}} CNS can only be reliably achieved following biopsy. For systemic infections there are few treatment options, and E. dermatitidis is described as [...] "notoriously resistant" [...] to antifungal drugs. During the North Carolina outbreak, treatment with voriconazole was effective in four out of the five patients, and all of voriconazole, itraconazole, and <b>amphotericin</b> B {{were found to be}} effective in vitro. Terbinafine has also been found to be effective in vitro, and combinations of antifungal drugs can have a synergistic effect against E. dermatitidis. A 2012 article found that of reported cases, 44% of patients responded to <b>amphotericin</b> B treatment, 50% responded to voriconazole treatment, and 71.4% responded to itraconazole therapy.|$|E
2500|$|Effective {{clinical}} {{treatments of}} infections caused by Exserohilum {{are still very}} scarce. Recent cases of sinusitis and cutaneous infections report successful results when treated with <b>amphotericin</b> B, itraconazole and/or voriconazole. Although E. rostratum is sensitive to <b>amphotericin</b> B, a common antifungal agent, the severe and potentially lethal side-effects of this drug have limited its use in certain patients, particularly those of older age. A recent drug repurposing screening of antifungal agents suggests the triazoles posaconazole and lanoconazole as useful alternative agents for treating E. rostratum infection. Posaconazole is highly potent and can be taken orally for the prolonged treatment of non-CNS infections like septic joints. It {{has also been shown}} to cross the blood-brain barrier and thus has potential as a treatment for CNS infections as well, though not reaching levels as high as the azoles.|$|E
2500|$|The drug {{development}} pipeline is lacking significantly, and no novel drug targets are expected for approval {{in the next}} 5 years. In the meantime, new combination therapies, and well as improvements to existing drugs targets, are under development. [...] Single-dosage administrations of liposomal <b>amphotericin</b> B {{have been shown to}} be effective, and oral formulations are currently under development to increase access and facilitate distribution of the efficacious drug in the field.|$|E
2500|$|The serendipitous {{discovery}} and subsequent clinical success of penicillin prompted a large-scale search for other environmental microorganisms that might produce anti-infective natural products. [...] Soil and water {{samples were collected}} {{from all over the}} world, leading to the discovery of streptomycin (derived from Streptomyces griseus), and the realization that bacteria, not just fungi, represent an important source of pharmacologically active natural products. [...] This, in turn, {{led to the development of}} an impressive arsenal of antibacterial and antifungal agents including <b>amphotericin</b> B, chloramphenicol, daptomycin and tetracycline (from Streptomyces spp.), the polymyxins (from Paenibacillus polymyxa), and the rifamycins (from Amycolatopsis rifamycinica).|$|E
2500|$|Meningitis is an {{inflammation}} of the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord (these membranes are known as meninges). Meningitis is most commonly caused by infections with various pathogens, examples of which are Streptococcus pneumoniae [...] and Haemophilus influenzae. When the meninges are inflamed, the bloodâ€“brain barrier may be disrupted. This disruption may increase the penetration of various substances (including either toxins or antibiotics) into the brain. Antibiotics used to treat meningitis may aggravate the inflammatory response of {{the central nervous system}} by releasing neurotoxins from the cell walls of bacteria - like lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Depending on the causative pathogen, whether it is bacterial, fungal, or protozoan, treatment with third-generation or fourth-generation cephalosporin or <b>amphotericin</b> B is usually prescribed.|$|E
