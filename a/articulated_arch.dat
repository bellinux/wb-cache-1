Paradigmático del trabajo de Soteras fue el Altar Mayor del XXXV Congreso Eucarístico Internacional de Barcelona (1952), y ya en colaboración, el Palacio Municipal de Deportes de Barcelona (1954 - 1955) y el destruido Palacio de Deportes de Madrid (1955 - 1960). Es posible reseguir en estas obras una secuencia evolutiva, función de la relación entre forma y geometría de la estática; transformando la obligada austeridad económica del momento en virtud espacial. José Soteras Mauri and Lorenzo García-Barbón {{played a}} privileged {{role in the}} {{hierarchy}} of the Barcelona architectural scene in the 50 ’s and 60 ’s. They both developed a prolific work, mostly omitted by the specialized post-francoist critics. Their public designs were mainly characterized by the expressive use of structural elements. Thus, this form generative system settles back the typological questions. It has been selected three public building works, all three were characterized by the relation in between statics, geometry and interior space. The first case of study, the XXXV Eucharistic Congress Major Altar was developed in Barcelona in 1952. This design starts a new structural experimentation process based on counterweights and tensor systems. The second case is the Barcelona Municipal Sports Arena (1954 - 1955). It was solved through a triple <b>articulated</b> <b>arch</b> system. This structural and spatial system was pragmatically developed to solve the tight construction schedule. Meanwhile, they were developing together with Francisco Mitjans the Camp Nou tribune canopy. Its structure was again characterized by a counterbalance and tensors static system. On his own, Soteras designed the San Pio x Church in the Congreso Eucarístico neighbourhood in Barcelona. This spin off work explores a nerved vault structure. Final case of study is Madrid Sports Arena (1955 - 1960). It was built together again by Soteras and García-Barbón. This work combines all the previous structural systems, tensors, counterweights and arches. Thus, it could be detected a structural solution process of continuity and change. In an austere economic period, this defines an evolutionary sequence where form and statics geometry intertwine in a new spatial richness...|$|E
5000|$|Since 2011, it {{has been}} located at an {{extension}} of Hren Street (...) between the Krakovo Embankment (...) and the Gruden Embankment (...) , connecting the Trnovo District and the Prule neighbourhood in the Center District. It has three <b>articulated</b> <b>arches,</b> each of them made of two parts, joined with a bolt by {{the principle of the}} charnier arch at the highest point of the arch. Technically, it quite surpasses the Iron Bridge in England. The elements are joined with screws instead of wedges, and reinforcing bars and hollow elements were used instead of full pylons, which has enabled the bridge to be much lighter, but stable.|$|R
50|$|It {{differs from}} other baths {{in that it}} has a large {{interior}} and the dressing room and the baths are square in shape. Architectural composition of the structure is <b>articulated</b> in pointed <b>arches</b> and domes, divided into proportional layers.|$|R
40|$|This work {{performed}} a comparative analysis between the construction process carried out when building the dome at the Temple of Santa Lucía, in Ambalema-Colombia and the typical process of an octagonal dome. Additionally, the structural stability is assessed {{of the dome}} of the case study against service and dynamic loads. To compare with the case study, known domes were taken as examples from structures in Italy and Spain. The analysis includes a study on the dome’s geometry and the constructive errors found. Methodology: The dome’s stability was evaluated through structural analysis software for which the dome was simplified into a system of four <b>articulated</b> <b>arches.</b> Conclusions: As a result, it was found that {{the dome of the}} temple of Santa Lucía does not have a system to counteract lateral thrusts (a drum or its similar), which permitted the appearance and widening of meridional cracks. These cracks propagate from the base to the crown, but do not compromise the structure’s stability for service loads. The analysis for seismic loads indicates that the dome is at risk of collapse upon seismic events, even of moderate magnitudes. Originality: The study is aimed at architects and engineers interested in the theme of restoration of historical structures...|$|R
2500|$|Louchheim {{wrote that}} {{although}} the arch [...] "has a simplicity which should guarantee timeliness", it is entirely modern as well because of the innovative design and its scientific considerations. In The Dallas Morning News, architectural critic David Dillon opined that the arch exists not as a functional edifice but {{as a symbol of}} [...] "boundless American optimism". He <b>articulates</b> the <b>arch's</b> multiple [...] "moods"—"reflective in sunlight, soft and pewterish in mist; crisp as a line drawing one moment, chimerical the next"—as a way the arch has [...] "paid for itself many times over in wonder".|$|R
50|$|The U.S. Custom House is an {{exemplary}} {{display of the}} Italian Renaissance Revival style of architecture, exhibiting Baroque and Mannerist features. The building's first-story walls are brick masonry sheathed in light-gray granite, with rusticated joints and quoins at the corners, and are pierced by window and door openings headed with <b>articulated</b> semicircular <b>arches.</b> A continuous granite stringcourse carved with Vitruvian scrolls and a balustrade above divide {{the first and second}} floors. The upper stories are composed of Roman brick with terra-cotta detailing and crowned with a dentil cornice molding supported by scrolled consoles. The flanking pavilions are capped with slate-covered pyramidal roofs, prominently featuring two ornamental vent stacks clad in terra cotta atop a rusticated stone base.|$|R
5000|$|The theatre's facade is <b>articulated</b> by classic <b>arches</b> made of {{travertine}} marble. The {{building has}} four levels that, {{in addition to}} the two main halls, house the administrative offices, a reception hall, the Sala de la Cultura (Culture Hall) and a bar. The Sala de la Cultura, with a capacity of 220 spectators, was created for piano concerts, chamber concerts, symposia, seminars, and cultural events of similar scale.|$|R
50|$|Rotaryus {{is known}} {{only from the}} holotype MNG 10182, {{articulated}} partial well-preserved skull and both mandibles and a closely associated partial postcranial skeleton. The postcranial skeleton includes several <b>articulated</b> neural <b>arches</b> with ribs, most of the left shoulder girdle, humeri, right radius and ulna, and a femur. It was collected from the uppermost part of the Tambach Formation, dating to the Artinskian stage of the Late Cisuralian Series (or alternatively upper Rotliegend), about 284-279.5 million years ago. It {{was found in the}} lowermost formational unit of the Upper Rotliegend Group or Series of the Bromacker Quarry, the middle part of the Thuringian Forest, near the village of Tambach-Dietharz. Rotaryus is only the second trematopid species to be reported from the Bromacker locality, and outside of United States, alongside Tambachia.|$|R
25|$|Two {{identical}} streets {{lead from}} {{the east and west}} gates to the centre of the courtyard. They are lined by verandahed colonnades <b>articulated</b> with cusped <b>arches</b> behind which cellular rooms were used to sell goods from when the Taj was built until 1996. The tax revenue from this trade was used for the upkeep of the Taj complex. The eastern bazaar streets were essentially ruined {{by the end of the}} 19th century and were restored by Lord Curzon restored 1900 and 1908.|$|R
50|$|The {{apartment}} building at 49-51 Spring Street {{is one of}} two residential apartment blocks standing {{on the west side of}} Spring Street between Garden and Myrtle Streets. The setting is now one of urban renewal, the buildings surrounded by parking lots on three sides, and Interstate 84 passing not far to the east, separating the buildings from Downtown Hartford. This building is three stories in height, built out of brick with brownstone trim. It is five bays wide, with the entrance at the center, recessed under a Syrian arch. The outer bays and center bay are topped visually by large round-arch panels, with polygonal bay windows on the first and second floors of the outer bays, and on the second floor above the entrance in the center. The building's cornice has brick corbelling, with built-out bracket-like brickwork <b>articulating</b> the <b>arched</b> panels.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} {{contains many}} ornate, richly finished spaces. A stunning plaster coffered ceiling tops the 23 ft {{space of a}} courtroom in the original portion of the building. Decorative bands and motifs are distinguished by vivid shades of paint, which were commonly used during the Victorian era when the original portion of the building was constructed. When the ceiling was repainted {{as part of the}} 1994 to 1997 restoration, meticulous paint analysis revealed that more than 25 different colors were originally used and these were replicated. The courtroom also features <b>articulated</b> segmental <b>arches</b> over large windows separated by pilasters. Historic wood wainscot surrounds the lower portion of the room. A courtroom in the 1897 portion is clad in pink and gray Tennessee marble. The judge's bench is flanked by marble Ionic columns. Most of the original hardware, including brass window pulls and bronze ventilation grilles, remain.|$|R
40|$|North facade. Facing south.; Two- story, six bay (100 - 110), brick Italianate {{commercial}} {{block with}} dentillated brickwork topped by ornamental bracketed cornice. The cornice once had iron cresting, {{but only the}} finial-like projections remain. Second story fenestration on the two west bays is <b>articulated</b> with segmental <b>arched</b> brick window hoods with stone keystones over rectangular windows, whereas the four east bays have simple arched brick over rectangular windows. Each bay is separated by capped brick pilasters. Store fronts have large plate glass windows with recessed entries; stained glass having {{been added to the}} upper window area of the two middle bays. Renovation has altered materials covering the store fronts and eliminated the bracked cornice between stories...|$|R
5000|$|The Thomas Street façade {{is similar}} to that on Broadway. It has three bays; the outer two {{containing}} five window openings per story and the center bay with four, each bay separated by Corinthian piers. With the exception of the two western openings and the eastern opening, <b>articulated</b> by flattened <b>arches,</b> the first floor has been enlarged since the building's construction. At the base of the service entrance, a metal plaque reads [...] "Architectural Iron Works / 14th Street between / A B & C NY." [...] Above the service entrance, each window contains an arched transom with paired wood sash windows. The rear wall, adjacent to the Thomas Street façade, is covered with gray stucco.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of an angled view of {{the front}} {{entrance}} of the Exhibition Building, [s. d. ]. This Romanesque-style building stands about three stories tall. Some of its unique features include decorative arches near the roof, massive <b>articulated</b> walls, large <b>arches</b> surrounding the entryways, and barrel vaulted doorways. The three visible entrances have highly decorated porticos with decorative panels above the door. Above each entrance, a sculpture of two infant children holding onto an engraved seal can be seen. The seal above the center entrance has a flag pole extending from behind it. A rope originating from the flagpole is tied {{to one of the}} decorative lamps that flank the central doorway. Two small bushes sit in the foreground at left...|$|R
