5|$|In {{the same}} year that Anstey (and his friend William Hayward Roberts) were working on their Elegia Scripta in Coemeterio Rustico, Latine reddita (1762), another Latin version was {{published}} by Robert Lloyd with the title Carmen Elegiacum. Both were subsequently included in Irish collections of Gray’s poems, accompanied not only by John Duncombe’s “Evening Contemplation”, <b>as</b> <b>noted</b> <b>earlier,</b> but in the 1775 Dublin edition by translations from Italian sources as well. These included another Latin translation by Giovanni Costa and two into Italian by Abbate Crocci and Giuseppe Gennari. The pattern of including translations and imitations together continued into the 19th century with an 1806 bilingual edition in which a translation into French verse, signed simply L.D., appeared facing the English original page by page. However, the bulk of the book was made up of four English parodies. Duncombe’s “Evening contemplation” was preceded by a parody of itself, “Nocturnal contemplations in Barham Down’s Camp”, which is filled, like Duncombe’s poem, with drunken roisterers disturbing the silence. Also included were Jerningham’s “The Nunnery” and J.T.R’s “Nightly thoughts in the Temple”, the latter set in the gated lawyer’s quarter in London.|$|E

25|$|Some of Plato's famous {{works are}} Phaedo, the Crito, and, <b>as</b> <b>noted</b> <b>earlier,</b> the Meno.

Plato's teacher and mentor, Socrates, always plays a significant and formative role in these dialogues.|$|E

25|$|Mendenhall {{took the}} {{language}} {{to be very}} early ("Old Coastal") Semitic, from before the split between the Northwest Semitic (Phoenician, Hebrew) and South Semitic (Old South Arabian) language groups.

25|$|Regular {{inspection}} of the ballast shoulder is important; <b>as</b> <b>noted</b> <b>earlier,</b> the lateral stability of the track depends upon the shoulder. The shoulder acquires some amount of stability over time, being compacted by traffic; maintenance tasks such as replacing ties, tamping, and ballast cleaning can upset this stability. After performing these tasks, {{it is necessary for}} either trains to run at reduced speed on the repaired routes, or to employ machinery to compact the shoulder again.|$|E
25|$|Secured and {{unsecured}} creditors {{constitute the}} creditor body. Both secured and unsecured creditors {{are ahead of}} shareholders <b>as</b> <b>noted</b> <b>earlier.</b> A secured creditor is a creditor, who has a priority claim on an asset or assets of a company. A lien on the specific asset or assets places the secured creditor's claim ahead of the unsecured creditor. Once a secured creditor is satisfied, the unsecured creditor is then the next priority. This is again the normal order of priority in a bankruptcy.|$|E

25|$|Hero sailed {{in company}} with Baleine, of Le Havre, Captain Reuben Baxter. Between 10 July and 15 August they cruised the coast, but after having {{gathered}} only 200 barrels of oil, they sailed first to St Helena {{and then to}} St Catherine, Brazil. Swallow captured both Hero and Baleine. Swallow {{was reported to have}} arrived at Rio de Janeiro on 17 August 1804. <b>As</b> <b>noted</b> <b>earlier,</b> Swallow took Hero back to Britain. Swallow apparently abandoned Baleine, though in what state, and what happened to her subsequently, is not clear.|$|E
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>noted</b> <b>earlier,</b> the Palas built {{a number}} of monasteries and other sacred structures. The Somapura Mahavihara in present-day Bangladesh is a World Heritage Site. It is a monastery with 21 acre (85,000 m²) complex has 177 cells, {{numerous}} stupas, temples and {{a number of}} other ancillary buildings. The gigantic structures of other Viharas, including Vikramashila, Odantapuri, and Jagaddala are the other masterpieces of the Palas. These mammoth structures were mistaken by the forces of Bakhtiyar Khalji as fortified castles and were demolished. The art of Bihar and Bengal during the Pala and Sena dynasties influenced the art of Nepal, Burma, Sri Lanka and Java.|$|E
25|$|Sadly, the {{conditions}} of Ælfgifu's return to fortune remain unclear. It would have been important to know, for instance, how and what on terms she came to hold the estates mentioned in her will. Those at Newnham Murren and Linslade were previously granted to her by King Edgar and now returned to the royal family, but {{it is impossible to}} determine which of the other estates were part of her dower property and which were inherited or acquired otherwise. <b>As</b> <b>noted</b> <b>earlier,</b> a case has been made for Princes Risborough as having been passed on through the maternal line. If the other holdings were likewise her own, the rehabilitation of her position may have come at a great price, one which considerably enriched the royal family with land north of the Thames.|$|E

25|$|The {{chemical}} {{composition of the}} white dwarf depends upon its mass. A star of a few solar masses will ignite carbon fusion to form magnesium, neon, and smaller amounts of other elements, resulting in a white dwarf composed chiefly of oxygen, neon, and magnesium, provided that it can lose enough mass to get below the Chandrasekhar limit (see below), and provided that the ignition of carbon is not so violent as to blow the star apart in a supernova. A star of mass {{on the order of}} magnitude of the Sun will be unable to ignite carbon fusion, and will produce a white dwarf composed chiefly of carbon and oxygen, and of mass too low to collapse unless matter is added to it later (see below). A star of less than about half the mass of the Sun will be unable to ignite helium fusion (<b>as</b> <b>noted</b> <b>earlier),</b> and will produce a white dwarf composed chiefly of helium.|$|E

500|$|<b>As</b> <b>noted</b> <b>earlier,</b> {{even among}} writers who {{consider}} consciousness to be a well-defined thing, {{there is widespread}} dispute about which animals other than humans {{can be said to}} possess it. Edelman has described this distinction as that of humans possessing higher-order consciousness while sharing the trait of primary consciousness with non-human animals (see previous paragraph). Thus, any examination of the evolution of consciousness is faced with great difficulties. [...] Nevertheless, some writers have argued that consciousness can be viewed from the standpoint of [...] evolutionary biology as an adaptation {{in the sense of a}} trait that increases fitness. [...] In his article [...] "Evolution of consciousness", John Eccles argued that special anatomical and physical properties of the mammalian cerebral cortex gave rise to consciousness (" [...] psychon ... linked to [...] dendron through quantum physics"). [...] Bernard Baars proposed that once in place, this [...] "recursive" [...] circuitry may have provided a basis for the subsequent development of many of the functions that consciousness facilitates in higher organisms. Peter Carruthers has put forth one such potential adaptive advantage gained by conscious creatures by suggesting that consciousness allows an individual to make distinctions between appearance and reality. This ability would enable a creature to recognize the likelihood that their perceptions are deceiving them (e.g. that water in the distance may be a mirage) and behave accordingly, and it could also facilitate the manipulation of others by recognizing how things appear to them for both cooperative and devious ends.|$|E

30|$|But, <b>as</b> was <b>noted</b> <b>earlier,</b> the {{diversity}} in sectoral bargaining arrangements means that any classification of bargaining structure {{based solely on}} the bargaining level is hazardous and assuredly insufficient to address decentralization. Visser’s amplification of bargaining structure next turns to a distinction between two-level or two-tier bargaining and single-level bargaining. This distinction does not apply only to sectoral bargaining, however, since centralized agreements may involve just a single level or allow for additional bargaining on pay.|$|R
