40|$|A {{sample of}} 16 {{previously}} "unknown" mutants of Neurospora crassa was studied. Five {{of these were}} shown to be double mutants. The growth requirements of 19 of the 21 single-gene mutants available then from these "unknowns" were at least partially defined chemically. Of these 19, three have been classified <b>as</b> serineless, <b>two</b> <b>as</b> asparagineless, <b>two</b> <b>as</b> pyramidineless, <b>two</b> <b>as</b> succinicless, and one each as aceticless, arginineless, aromaticless, asparticless, homoserineless, leucineless, methionineless, methionine-adenine-cystineless, p-aminiobenzoicless, and slow-grower. These had been classified as "unknowns" apparently for various reasons, such as: (1) inhibitions from normal metabolites, (2) complex requirements for double-mutant "unknowns," and (3) absence of active compound from chemically defined mixtures previously used. Some of these mutant genes have been located genetically. These results have been discussed briefly {{with reference to the}} hypothesis of the "unifunctionality" of the gene...|$|R
