500|$|Britten's early musical {{life was}} {{dominated}} by the classical masters; his mother's ambition was for him to become the [...] "Fourth B" [...] – after Bach, Beethoven and Brahms. Britten was later to assert that his initial development as a composer was stifled by reverence for these masters: [...] "Between the ages of thirteen and sixteen I knew every note of Beethoven and Brahms. I remember receiving the full score of Fidelio for my fourteenth birthday... But I think in a sense I never forgave them for having led me astray in my own particular thinking and natural inclinations". He developed a particular animosity towards Brahms, whose piano music he had once held in great esteem; in 1952 he confided that he played through all Brahms's music from time to time, [...] "to see if I <b>am</b> <b>right</b> about him; I usually find that I underestimated last time how bad it was!" ...|$|E

In an interview after Ocean's open letter, Malay called him [...] "the new hybrid of what an MC {{used to be in}} the '80s or '90s ... the true storyteller" [...] and said of the lyrics, [...] "I don't think anyone during any given point during the creative process knew what was happening ... when he's singing maybe from a female perspective or whatever, it's a story, it's a world that he created. It's not necessarily his personal—like something that he's experiencing. Maybe it is and it's a metaphor the way he did it". They finished writing Channel Orange in two to three months. Ocean said of the album's development in an interview for Rap-Up, [...] "It succinctly defines me as an artist for where I <b>am</b> <b>right</b> now and that was the aim. It's about the stories. If I write 14 stories that I love, then the next step is to get the environment of music around it to best envelop the story and all kinds of sonic goodness." ...|$|E

500|$|Milian wrote So Amazin {{based on}} her own life, and each record pertained to a {{different}} aspect, especially focused on relationships. During early production of the album, Milian was dealing with her break-up with actor Nick Cannon and wrote several records based on that. While writing the mid-tempo track [...] "My Lovin' Goes", Milian felt she turned a new leaf. She said, [...] "you see the change in So Amazin where life was just really coming into place. I was finally becoming the woman that I feel that I <b>am</b> <b>right</b> now. Also, I was leaving old love behind and learning about new types of love. Which is great, whether it be life, and also the dating scene is really nice." [...] Two tracks which Milian wrote about Cannon were [...] "Gonna Tell Everybody" [...] and [...] "Who's Gonna Ride". When Milian and Cool & Dre had discussions, her break-up with Cannon was regularly mentioned. Milian felt a need to express herself, and writing became therapeutic for Milian; {{she was able to}} get through the break-up by writing songs. The production by Cool & Dre also inspired Milian to write the tracks, as she felt comfortable with them and was able to be open.|$|E
500|$|On November 9, 1942, {{soon after}} making his reports to Roosevelt and the American people, Willkie argued {{the case of}} Schneiderman v. United States before the Supreme Court. William Schneiderman, {{secretary}} of the California Communist Party, was a naturalized American until the government revoked his citizenship, stating that he had concealed his membership on his application for naturalization in 1927. Two lower federal courts upheld the denaturalization. Representing a communist, even in wartime, did nothing to shore up Willkie's diminishing support in the Republican Party, but he wrote to a friend saying, [...] "I am sure I <b>am</b> <b>right</b> in representing Schneiderman. Of all the times when civil liberties should be defended, it is now." [...] In his argument Willkie quoted Lincoln and Jefferson {{by saying that the}} people could, if they deemed it necessary, remake the government, and he stated that Marx's view of revolution was mild by comparison. In 1943, the Supreme Court ruled for Schneiderman, 5—3, restoring his citizenship. Although Willkie refrained from criticizing Roosevelt's internment of Japanese Americans, he stated in a speech that war was no excuse for depriving groups of people of their rights. He spoke out against those who blamed the Jews for the war, warning against [...] "witch-hanging and mob-baiting". For his activities, he received the American Hebrew Medal for 1942.|$|E

2500|$|The single [...] "Cannonball" [...] {{was written}} by Sia Furler. Originally, this song wasn't meant for Michele; it was {{introduced}} to her a month after her boyfriend's death and she had an instant connection with its lyrics because they encapsulated her feelings in that moment. Michele has stated, [...] "I just felt that [...] "Cannonball" [...] was the perfect first song for people to hear from this record. It just really explains where I <b>am</b> <b>right</b> now and it's been such an inspirational song for me. The minute I heard the song, I had a physical reaction to it. For me, it's been my strength. I listen to it every day. I know it was brought into my life for a reason. It's really been so helpful for me and I hope it's the same for other people as it's been for me." [...] Because of this, Furler gave the song to her. Furler also wrote the song [...] "Battlefield" [...] especially for Michele, and co-wrote [...] "If You Say So" [...] with her. [...] "If You Say So" [...] was confirmed to be dedicated to Cory Monteith, Michele's Glee co-star and late boyfriend, who died in July 2013.|$|E
