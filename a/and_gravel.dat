5|$|The geology of {{the borough}} is unremarkable; the bedrock is mainly {{composed}} of sand with patches of clay {{to the east}} and west, and superficial deposits (drift) of sand <b>and</b> <b>gravel</b> cover the entire area. The extraction of sand <b>and</b> <b>gravel</b> for construction purposes is carried out in the borough and the opening of more sites is planned.|$|E
5|$|Near its mouth, the {{surficial}} geology in {{the vicinity}} of Nanticoke Creek mainly consists of alluvium (which mainly consists of stratified silt, sand, <b>and</b> <b>gravel,</b> with some boulders), Wisconsinan Outwash (which contains stratified sand <b>and</b> <b>gravel),</b> and urban land (which is highly disrupted by cut and fill). Further upstream, the surficial geology mainly consists of coal dumps and surface mining land (both of which are rich in rick waste), as well as a glacial or resedimented till known as Wisconsinan Till, and bedrock consisting of sandstone and shale. The upper reaches of the creek mainly are around surficial geology consisting of surface mining land, bedrock, and Wisconsinan Till.|$|E
5|$|The {{channel of}} Muncy Creek is sinuous with high streambanks and the creek has cobble <b>and</b> <b>gravel</b> bars. There {{are a few}} {{strainers}} on the creek.|$|E
5000|$|The Purisima Formation {{surrounds}} the San Benito <b>Gravels,</b> <b>and</b> was {{a primary source}} of the silt <b>and</b> <b>gravels</b> deposited in them.|$|R
50|$|The soil is {{composed}} {{in part of}} Eocene and Oligocene sands, clays <b>and</b> <b>gravels,</b> <b>and</b> in part of chalk of the Campanian period.|$|R
50|$|Also common are {{patches of}} locally derived {{materials}} such as clay-with-flints and head, the latter including clays, sands <b>and</b> <b>gravels</b> which in the dry valleys of the Downs have a chalky and flinty composition. Along the coastal zone, wind-blown deposits of brick earth, mostly silt, are widespread as are sands <b>and</b> <b>gravels</b> whose age <b>and</b> origin are uncertain.|$|R
5|$|The {{reserve is}} also the {{headquarters}} of the Warwickshire Wildlife Trust. Formerly used for sand <b>and</b> <b>gravel</b> quarrying, the 92 hectare (228 acre) site is owned by French industrial company LaFarge Industries and is leased to the Trust.|$|E
5|$|Although much of {{the upper}} reaches are now {{designated}} as leisure routes, there is still significant commercial traffic on the navigation. 300,000 tons were carried in 2007, {{although most of the}} traffic is now petroleum <b>and</b> <b>gravel,</b> rather than the coal which kept the navigation profitable for 150 years.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the Green Line near Berwyn Heights, Maryland {{resulted}} {{in the creation of}} Lake Artemesia. In 1976, WMATA removed sand <b>and</b> <b>gravel</b> needed for construction from open space adjacent to the Green Line. In exchange, WMATA paid to develop the area as a lake surrounded by a park.|$|E
30|$|Unit 3 (20 – 25 cm) was {{a massive}} layer of coarse sand <b>and</b> <b>gravels.</b>|$|R

30|$|An {{experimental}} study is imperative {{for a better}} understanding of the interaction between fine constituents and coarse aggregates. Some authors (Rossignolo et al. 2003; Beaucour et al. 2003) have studied the behavior of granular mixtures to obtain an optimal concrete formulation. For ternary mixtures, the interactions among the sand, fines, <b>and</b> <b>gravels</b> need to be analyzed. Binary mixtures of fines <b>and</b> <b>gravels</b> can confirm the behavior of these interactions.|$|R
5|$|Fifty-seven {{percent of}} the Nescopeck Creek {{watershed}} is composed of deciduous forest. Areas of perennial herbaceous vegetation make up 11 to 12 {{percent of the}} creek's watershed. Additionally, there are scattered patches of mixed vegetation and annual herbaceous vegetation in the northwestern part of the Nescopeck Creek watershed. Four to seven percent of the Nescopeck Creek watershed consists of mines, quarries, <b>and</b> <b>gravel</b> pits.|$|E
5|$|George Tillson, his sons, and his {{brother-in-law}} Benjamin Van Norman were the principal stockholders of the Ingersoll and Port Burwell Road Company, which they formed along with approximately 200 shareholders in September1849. Proceeding quickly, the company established eight toll booths along the new route, which {{became known as}} the Plank <b>and</b> <b>Gravel</b> Road due to the materials with which it was constructed.|$|E
5|$|Progress in {{clearing}} and covering the burial ground was slow, {{and it was}} not until 28 October 1880 that the churchyard was reopened as a public park. Laid out with flower beds <b>and</b> <b>gravel</b> paths, the park became a popular place for local workers to spend breaks.|$|E
50|$|Trinidad Head is {{composed}} of metamorphosed gabbro embedded in the surrounding Franciscan melange, topped with Pleistocene sands <b>and</b> <b>gravels.</b>|$|R
50|$|Soils of the {{immediate}} streambed and its vicinity are classified as the riverwash series, recent deposition of sands <b>and</b> <b>gravels.</b>|$|R
50|$|Winner Creek joins Glacier Creek {{just below}} the mouth of Crow Creek. Its valley, bedrock, <b>and</b> <b>gravels</b> {{resemble}} those of California Creek.|$|R
5|$|The National Development Plan for the Utilisation of Oil Shale 2008–2015 {{describes}} {{oil shale}} {{as a strategic}} energy resource. Other mineral resources in Estonia that are mined currently are peat, dolostone, clays, limestone, sand <b>and</b> <b>gravel.</b> Potentially mineable resources include granite, iron ore and phosophorite.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of soil in the Languedoc varies from the chalk, limestone <b>and</b> <b>gravel</b> based soils inland to more alluvial soils near the coast. Some of the more highly rated vineyards are laid on top of ancient riverbed stones {{similar to those of}} Châteauneuf-du-Pape.|$|E
5|$|The rocks {{exposed in}} the park were formed in the Devonian and Carboniferous periods between 370and 340million years ago, when the land {{was part of the}} {{coastline}} of a shallow sea that covered a great portion of what is now North America. The high mountains to the east of the sea gradually eroded, causing a build-up of sediment made up primarily of clay, sand <b>and</b> <b>gravel.</b>|$|E
25|$|Deposits of glacial and fluvial sands <b>and</b> <b>gravels</b> {{have been}} <b>and</b> {{continue}} to be worked in numerous areas, principally for the construction industry.|$|R
50|$|The area lies on Matangi soils, {{formed on}} the edge of the Komakorau Bog and the Waikato's {{alluvial}} plains of sands <b>and</b> <b>gravels.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{underlying}} geology of {{the forest}} area is mostly clay or sands <b>and</b> <b>gravels.</b> There are also peatland bogs {{to the south of}} Feckenham.|$|R
5|$|Chadderton's modern {{commercial}} centre lies {{close to}} the boundary with Oldham; the expansion of Oldham in the mid-19th century caused urbanisation along the eastern boundary of Chadderton, which spread outwards {{into the rest of}} the township. Continued growth in the late-19th and early-20th centuries gave rise to a densely populated, industrial landscape of factories and rows of terraced housing, typical of mill towns in Northern England. There is a mixture of high-density urban areas, suburbs and semi-rural locations in Chadderton, but overwhelmingly the land use in the town is urban. The soils of Chadderton are sand based, with subsoils of clay <b>and</b> <b>gravel.</b>|$|E
5|$|Generally {{the bedrock}} of {{the west of the}} town {{consists}} of coal measures, which were exploited by the coal mining industry, while the east is mainly millstone grit. Overlying the bedrock are deposits of glacial sand <b>and</b> <b>gravel,</b> clay, and some alluvial deposits. Ashton Moss, a peat bog, lies {{to the west of the}} town and was originally much larger. The River Tame forms part of the southern boundary, dividing the town from Stalybridge and Dukinfield, and the River Medlock runs to the west.|$|E
5|$|In {{its lower}} reaches, the {{surficial}} geology {{in the vicinity}} of Shickshinny Creek consists of urban land highly disrupted by cut and fill, alluvium, alluvial terrace, fill, Wisconsinan Ice-Contact Stratified Drift containing stratified sand <b>and</b> <b>gravel,</b> Wisconsinan Ice-Contact Delta containing sand <b>and</b> <b>gravel,</b> Wisconsinan Bouldery Till (a glaicial or resedimented till containing boulders, and bedrock consisting of sandstone and shale. The bedrock mainly occurs on the mountains {{in this part of the}} watershed. In the middle reaches of the creek, the surficial geology mainly features bedrock consisting of sandstone and shale, alluvium, and a glacial or resedimented till known as Wisconsinan Till. Some Wisconsinan Outwash and alluvial terrace is also present near Koonsville. Some patches of Wisconsinan Bouldery Till and wetlands are also present. In its upper reaches, the creek is almost entirely dominated by Wisconsinan Till, bedrock, and some lakes. However, there is a patch of alluvial fan immediately north of Shickshinny Lake and some Wisconsinan Bouldery Till and Wisconsinan Outwash not far from the creek's source.|$|E
30|$|Grain forms {{appeared}} to have an influence on the void ratio, corroborated {{with the effects of}} the plates and the interference of the aggregates. Thus, an experimental study is imperative to achieve greater understanding of the interaction between fine and coarser aggregates. This behavior can be observed for a scoriaceous form such as coarse scorias. For ternary mixtures (sand river + scoria + cement), the interactions between the sands, fillers, <b>and</b> <b>gravels</b> have to be analyzed. Typically, fillers <b>and</b> <b>gravels</b> behave as binary mixtures (scoria + cement).|$|R
5000|$|Sediments {{associated}} with the Anglian glaciation are collectively termed the Albion Glacigenic Group, having formerly gone under other names. Amongst these the Lowestoft Formation (formerly known by various names: Lowestoft Boulder Clay, Cromer Till (in part), Lowestoft Till Group, Lowestoft Till Formation) comprises deposits of glacial origin along with the Aldeby sands <b>and</b> <b>gravels.</b> Likewise the Happisburgh Glacigenic Formation [...] is a modern name for an assemblage of sediments including the former ‘Corton Formation’ {{and a part of}} the Cromer Till. The tract of country around Lowestoft, Belton and Blundeston is formed by sands, along with sandy clays <b>and</b> <b>gravels,</b> formerly assigned to the Corton Formation. This is overlain in many places by the Corton Woods sands <b>and</b> <b>gravels</b> which are of glaciofluvial origin. The national park boundaries encompass the margins of this tract and hence of these sediments.|$|R
50|$|Softer sandy {{deposits}} {{occur within}} the Corallian, found for example at Faringdon, Shellingford and Hatford in Oxfordshire, where the sands <b>and</b> <b>gravels</b> are extensively quarried.|$|R
5|$|Meanders are sinuous bends in rivers {{or other}} channels, which form as a fluid, most often water, flows around bends. As {{soon as the}} path is {{slightly}} curved, the size and curvature of each loop increases as helical flow drags material like sand <b>and</b> <b>gravel</b> across the river {{to the inside of}} the bend. The outside of the loop is left clean and unprotected, so erosion accelerates, further increasing the meandering in a powerful positive feedback loop.|$|E
5|$|Presque Isle is a recurved, sand spit {{that formed}} {{during the last}} glacial period, or ice age, when the Laurentide Ice Sheet {{advanced}} into the basin now occupied by Lake Erie, and, when it retreated to the north between 12,370BC and 12,790BC, left behind a moraine consisting of clay, sand, <b>and</b> <b>gravel</b> that initially formed the Presque Isle peninsula. The deposits are constantly being re-worked by wave action and are gradually migrating to the northeast due to longshore drift.|$|E
5|$|Smythe is {{also known}} for having served in both World Wars, {{organizing}} his own artillery battery in the Second World War. The horses of Smythe's racing stable won the Queen's Plate twice among 145 stakes race wins during his lifetime. Smythe started and ran a successful sand <b>and</b> <b>gravel</b> business. He was a big supporter of the Ontario Society for Crippled Children and the Variety Club and founded the Conn Smythe Foundation philanthropic organization.|$|E
50|$|The geology of Suffolk {{in eastern}} England largely {{consists}} of a rolling chalk plain overlain in the east by Neogene clays, sands <b>and</b> <b>gravels</b> <b>and</b> isolated areas of Palaeocene sands. A variety of superficial deposits originating {{in the last couple}} of million years overlie this 'solid geology'.|$|R
50|$|The {{formation}} of Kaitorete Barrier {{began at the}} end of the Last Glacial Maximum 20,000 years ago valley glaciers advanced in Canterbury and subsequent glacial outwash rivers delivered vast quantities of sand, <b>gravel</b> <b>and</b> silt to the coast. Sea level in Canterbury was 130 meters lower than the present day due to glaciation and the coast was as far as 50 km east of its present-day position, meaning the Canterbury plains were double their present width. Subsequent rapid sea-level rise then drowned what is now the continental shelf, causing rapid westward migration of the coast. 10,000 years ago the Canterbury coast was approaching the area presently occupied by Lake Ellesmere / Te Waihora. The coast consisted then, as it does now of the unconsolidated sands <b>and</b> <b>gravels</b> of the fans of major rivers in the area such as the Rakaia and Waimakariri. The Canterbury Bight was exposed to powerful southerly waves. The combination of weakly resistant unconsolidated sands <b>and</b> <b>gravels</b> <b>and</b> high energy wave action caused rapid coastal erosion and strong net northward transport of the resulting load of sands <b>and</b> <b>gravels</b> fed to the shore.|$|R
50|$|The Turlock Lake Formation {{is a fan}} {{deposit of}} dominantly {{granitic}} alluvium covering the westward extension of the North Merced Pediment <b>and</b> <b>Gravels</b> formation, <b>and</b> directly overlying the Mehrten Formation.|$|R
