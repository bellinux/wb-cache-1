Nevertheless, {{at the end of}} each period the total time recorded is added up allowing for quicker processing by human resources or payroll. These machines sometimes have other functions such as <b>automatic</b> <b>stamping,</b> dual-colour printing, and automated column shift.|$|R

In this work, we propose a shape based approach for <b>automatic</b> <b>stamp</b> verification/detection in document images using an unsupervised feature learning. Given a small set of training images, our algorithm learns an appropriate shape representation using an unsupervised clustering. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in challenging scenarios...|$|R
5000|$|In his 1973 diagram {{showing the}} {{development}} and scope of Fluxus, George Maciunas included mail art among the activities pursued by the Fluxus artist Robert Filliou. Filliou coined the term the [...] "Eternal Network" [...] that has become synonymous with mail art. [...] Other Fluxus artists have been involved since the early 1960s {{in the creation of}} artist's postage stamps (Robert Watts, <b>Stamp</b> <b>Dispenser,</b> 1963), postcards (Ben Vautier, The Postman's Choice, 1965: a postcard with a different address on each side) and other works connected to the postal medium. [...] "Indeed, the mail art network counts many Fluxus members among its earliest participants. While Johnson did not consider himself directly {{as a member of the}} Fluxus school, his interests and attitudes were consistent with those of a number of Fluxus artists.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{conveying}} manipulator is {{an indispensable}} transmission system of JM 31 - 160 <b>automatic</b> <b>stamping</b> production line, and structural {{characteristics of the}} manipulator directly affect the productivity of auto stamping production line. Using virtual prototyping technology, basing on the Multi-body dynamics theory, explored the technical line of dynamic design theory to apply on the transmission system. Reaching a conclusion the function of optimized structure is improved, and manufacturing cost brings down...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: According to its {{structure}} and dimension, the original stamping forming {{process of the}} lipstick casing pipe was analyzed. In view of such drawbacks as dispersed working procedures, lower efficiency and unstable product quality in the original manufacturing process, wall thickness of the lipstick casing pipe was modified and became thinner than its original size with the premise of ensuring utility performance. A new manufacturing process for the modified lipstick casing pipe was provided and a fully <b>automatic</b> <b>stamping</b> die, which is more secure in operation, lowers raw material expense and has higher production efficiency, was designed...|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} years, from 1840 until 1850, all stamps were issued imperforate, {{and had to}} be cut from the sheet with {{scissors}} or knife. This was time-consuming and error-prone (as mangled stamps of the era attest).Once reliable separation equipment became available, nations switched rapidly. Imperforate stamps have been issued occasionally since then, either because separation equipment was temporarily unavailable (in newborn nations for instance), to makers of <b>automatic</b> <b>stamp</b> vending equipment (the United States did this in the 1900s and 1910s), as novelties for stamp collectors (particularly when stamps are issued in souvenir sheets), or as errors.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. When {{transporting}} {{the large}} and medium-sized <b>stamping</b> parts on <b>automatic</b> <b>stamping</b> production line, robotic end picking-up device(tooling) needs reasonable clamping positions to ensure smooth precision transmission and safe production. Based on UG platform, this paper has used the secondary development technique to develop a stamping process CAD system on automatic production line for robot manipulation with UG/Open API functions in Visual c++ 6. 0 environment, the system can quickly analyze the stamping process and the clamping positions for robots and generate a three-dimensional entity mould, which effectively shorten the production line product development cycle, improve the quality and production efficiency of stamping parts...|$|R
5000|$|A stamp {{vending machine}} (SVM) is a mechanical, {{electrical}} or electro-mechanical device {{which can be}} used to automatically vend postage stamps to users in exchange for a pre-determined amount of money, normally in coin. Most SVMs were positioned in public places to provide a useful service to customers when other sources of postage stamps, such as Post Offices were closed. The term is often applied to the entire object as found attached to a pillar box or sited in a wall. The name Stamp Vending Machine only applies to the internal mechanism, the housing is described by the UK Post Office as a [...] "case" [...] and was supplied, installed and maintained separately. Many postal administrations around the world have used <b>automatic</b> <b>stamp</b> vending machines including the United States, where private manufacturers began vending stamps from coils in 1908. Most countries of the Commonwealth of Nations have issued stamps for use in Stamp Vending Machines, including Hong Kong, New Zealand and Malta.|$|R

This session led to the establishment of the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board and its system of state-run liquor stores, reflecting Pinchot's desire to [...] "discourage the purchase of alcoholic beverages by making it as inconvenient and expensive as possible." [...] Pinchot argued that under the new system of state controlled liquor stores [...] "hisky will be sold by civil service employees with exactly the same amount of salesmanship as is displayed by an <b>automatic</b> postage <b>stamp</b> vending machine." ...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{problems}} of the component simulation method application in the problems of the automation of the mechanical system model formation with the further possibility of their CAD-realization. The purpose of the investigations mentioned consists in the automation of the CAD-model formation of high-speed mechanisms in automatic machines and in the analysis of dynamic processes occurred in their units taking into account their elasto-inertial properties, power dissipation, gaps in kinematic pairs, friction forces, design and technological loads. As an example in the paper there are considered a formalization of stages in the computer model formation of the cutting mechanism in cold <b>stamping</b> <b>automatic</b> machine AV 1818 and methods of for the computation of their parameters {{on the basis of its}} solid-state model...|$|R
5000|$|A prorogation of {{parliament}} took place on December 4, 2008, when Prime Minister Stephen Harper advised Governor General Michaëlle Jean to do so after the opposition Liberal and New Democratic parties formed a coalition {{with the support of}} the Bloc Québécois party and threatened to vote non-confidence in the sitting minority government, precipitating a parliamentary dispute. The Governor General, however, did not grant her prime minister's request until after two hours of consultation with various constitutional experts. Upon the end of her tenure as vicereine, Jean revealed to the Canadian Press that the delay was partly to [...] "send a message—and for people to understand that this warranted reflection." [...] It was also at the same time said by Peter H. Russell, one of those from whom Jean sought advice, that Canadians ought not regard as an <b>automatic</b> rubber <b>stamp</b> the Governor General's decision to accept Harper's advice concerning prorogation; Russell disclosed that Jean granted the prorogation on two conditions: parliament would reconvene soon and, when it did, the Cabinet would present a proposed budget, a vote on which is a confidence matter. This, Russell said, set a precedent that would prevent future prime ministers from advising the prorogation {{of parliament}} [...] "for any length of time for any reason." [...] Nelson Wiseman, a political science professor at the University of Toronto, wrote of Harper that [...] "no Prime Minister has so abused the power to prorogue." ...|$|R
