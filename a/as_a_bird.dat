5|$|There are {{two types}} of slope posture, a pre-copulatory one and an {{ordinary}} one. The pre-copulatory behavior of scaly-breasted munia includes a sequence of actions. The first involves either the male or female playing with nest-material. As soon <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>bird</b> has arranged the nest material in its bill, it begins to fly around in a zig-zag path. Once a bird lands close to its partner, the male bends towards the female and wipes its bill. The male then sings with movements of the body. The female invites mounting with tail quivering.|$|E
5|$|Birdy {{builds a}} new aviary {{in his bedroom}} and {{purchases}} two canaries. He names the female Perta and the male Alfonso after his friend. Upon returning to school, Birdy encounters a classmate, Doris Robinson, and Al encourages him to ask her out on a date. At the prom, Birdy dances unenthusiastically with Doris, leaving her confused and humiliated. Afterwards, Doris drives him to a secluded spot, where Birdy lightly rejects her sexual advances. Birdy returns home to his bedroom and lies down naked in the aviary. In a semi-conscious state, he expresses {{that he wants to}} die and be born again <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>bird.</b> He then imagines himself flying like a bird around his room, throughout the house and outside in the neighborhood.|$|E

5|$|Raptor is a steel {{inverted}} {{roller coaster}} designed by Bolliger & Mabillard at Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio, United States. When built in 1994, it broke many records and held many firsts when it opened. Instead {{of having a}} short layout designed {{to fit into a}} compact area like , Raptor was designed with a larger, 3,790-foot (1,160m) layout, making it the tallest, fastest and longest inverted roller coaster in the world when it opened. It features six inversions, including a cobra roll, a first for inverted roller coasters. At its opening, it was the largest investment in Cedar Point history. The ride is themed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>bird</b> of prey.|$|E
5|$|The {{black vulture}} {{appears in a}} variety of Maya hieroglyphics in Mayan codices. It is {{normally}} connected with either death or <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>bird</b> of prey. The vulture's glyph is often shown attacking humans. This species lacks the religious connections that the king vulture has. While some of the glyphs clearly show the black vulture's open nostril and hooked beak, some are assumed to be this species because they are vulture-like but lack the king vulture's knob and are painted black. This vulture has appeared on two stamps: those of Guyana in 1990 and Nicaragua in 1994.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} of farm animals seldom occurs spontaneously but is managed by farmers {{with a view}} to encouraging certain traits that are seen as desirable. These include hardiness, prolificness, mothering abilities, fast growth rates, low feed consumption per unit of growth, better body proportions, higher yields, better fibre qualities and other characteristics. Undesirable traits such as health defects, aggressiveness or lack of docility are selected against. Selective breeding has been responsible for some large increases in productivity. In 2007, a typical broiler chicken at eight weeks old was 4.8 times as heavy <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>bird</b> of similar age in 1957. In the thirty years to 2007, the average milk yield of a dairy cow in the United States nearly doubled.|$|E

The Tunku Abdul Rahman National Park is a group of five islands of Gaya, Manukan, Mamutik, Sapi and Sulug.

The Tun Mustapha Marine Park is the largest marine park located in the north of Sabah. It covers the three major islands of Banggi, Balambangan and Malawali. Another marine park is the Tun Sakaran Marine Park located in the south-east of Sabah.

5|$|E.V.O.: Search for Eden is a side-scrolling {{platformer}} action {{game where}} players must navigate {{a creature of}} their own design across a number of environments resembling Earth's past. The game is divided into five distinct geological periods: the Cambrian Period and the Ordovician Period of the Paleozoic Era ("The World Before Land") from 500 million years ago to 450 million years ago, then the Carboniferous period ("Early Creatures of Land"), the Mesozoic Era ("Age of Dinosaurs"), the late Neogene period ("Ice Age"), and finally the early Quaternary period ("Early Man"). Each period has its own map screen, which is divided into various levels. While each era takes historical liberties with both its inhabitants and time frames, the player's choices for evolution are dependent on the current era of play, ranging from aquatic bodies during the Age of Fish to mammalian physiology during the Age of Man. During the first two eras you are forced to gain a new body to progress, but once you reach the Age of Dinosaurs, a side quest {{will give you the}} option to remain as a reptile, or become a bird, gaining the ability of flight. As you enter the Ice Age <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>bird</b> or reptile, you are immediately given the option to become a mammal. You can finish the game as a reptile, bird, or mammal and the outcome is still the same, only the interaction dialogue is affected by your choices.|$|E

25|$|However, this {{description}} of Protoavis assumes that Protoavis has been correctly interpreted <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>bird.</b> Almost all palaeontologists doubt that Protoavis is a bird, or that all remains assigned to it even {{come from a}} single species, because of the circumstances of its discovery and unconvincing avian synapomorphies in its fragmentary material. When they were found at a Dockum Group quarry in the Texas panhandle in 1984, in a sedimentary stratum of a Triassic river delta, the fossils were a jumbled cache of disarticulated bones that may reflect an incident of mass mortality following a flash flood.|$|E

25|$|The Najafgarh drain {{has been}} much widened {{over the years to}} drain all the water which in earlier decades used to collect in the Nagafgarh lake or Jheel basin.

It has trees planted on both its embankments and an inspection road running on one embankment. During the winter months it attracts vast quantities of migratory birds, and supports local wildlife year-round. Due to the rich wildlife observed in and around the less polluted stretch of the drain outside of congested populated areas, it has been proposed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>bird</b> sanctuary for Delhi.|$|E
25|$|The braincase of Protoavis {{is similar}} in some respects to Troodon, with an {{enlarged}} cerebellum that shifted the optic lobes ventrolaterally, and also has a large floccular lobe. The inner ear is also pretty similar and bird-like in both taxa. The canalicular systems and the cochlear process differ in both taxa, and the vestibular region is relatively small and located in a ventral position {{to most of the}} anterior and posterior semicircular canals. The anterior semicircular canal is significantly longer than the others, and the cochlear process is a relatively long, vertically oriented tube. However, Protoavis is also remarkedly non-bird like in that it possess only a single exit for the trigeminal. However, these characters are not robust enough to identify Protoavis <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>bird.</b>|$|E
