5|$|Although {{there has}} been {{speculation}} <b>about</b> <b>earlier</b> works, Sorabji's earliest known (albeit lost) composition is a transcription dating from 1914 of Delius's In a Summer Garden. His early works are predominantly piano sonatas, songs and piano concertos. Of these, Piano Sonatas Nos. 1–3 (1919; 1920; 1922) are compositionally the most ambitious and significant. They are characterised mainly by {{their use of the}} single-movement format and by their athematism. The main criticism levelled at them is that they lack stylistic consistency and organic form. Sorabji himself developed a largely unfavourable view of his early works, to the extent that late in his life he even considered destroying many of their manuscripts.|$|E

25|$|Solutions of {{the heat}} {{equation}} are characterized by a gradual smoothing of the initial temperature distribution by the flow of heat from warmer to colder areas of an object. Generally, many different states and starting conditions will tend toward the same stable equilibrium. As a consequence, to reverse the solution and conclude something <b>about</b> <b>earlier</b> times or initial conditions from the present heat distribution is very inaccurate except over the shortest of time periods.|$|E

The poet [...] John Davidson wrote two works in the late 19th century titled the Fleet Street Eclogues. Arthur Ransome has a chapter in his Bohemia in London (1907) <b>about</b> <b>earlier</b> inhabitants of the street: Ben Jonson, the Doctor (Samuel Johnson), Coleridge, Hazlitt and Lamb; and about Temple Bar and the Press Club.|$|E
2500|$|In hadith studies, Isra'iliyyat (اسرائیلیات [...] "of the Israelites") is {{the body}} of {{narratives}} originating from Jewish and Christian traditions, rather than from other well-accepted sources that quote the Islamic prophet Muhammad. These narratives are found mainly in works of Qur'anic commentaries and history compilations. They contain information <b>about</b> <b>earlier</b> prophets mentioned in the Bible and the Qur'an, stories about the ancient Israelites, and fables allegedly or actually taken from Jewish sources.|$|E

Trump had previously said in 1997, [...] "I owed the banks as much as $9 billion". The Washington Post later wrote, [...] "It appeared that Trump had exaggerated the lows, to make his comeback seem even more impressive." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hipper {{suspected}} that the British had received advanced warning <b>about</b> <b>earlier</b> operations of the HSF from spy ships mingling with British and Dutch fishing boats, operating near the German Bight and the Dogger Bank, to observe German fleet movements. Hipper considered that with the Dogger Bank mid-way on the short route to the English coast, a signal from a trawler could reach the British {{in time for the}} British battlecruisers to intercept a German sortie, certainly on the return journey. Hipper ordered German ships vigorously to enforce search and seizure rules, bringing fishing boats into Cuxhaven to be searched. Buoyed by the success of the raid on the English coast, Admiral Hipper planned an attack for next month on the British fishing fleet on the Dogger Bank.

2500|$|Kumiko is {{revealed}} to be missing {{at the start of}} the second part, [...] "Bird as Prophet." [...] Shortly after, Toru finds out through a meeting with Noboru and Malta that Kumiko has apparently been spending time with another man and wants to end her relationship with Toru. Confused, Toru tries several things to calm himself and think through the situation: talking and taking up work with May Kasahara, hiding at the bottom of the well, and loitering around the city looking at people. Work with May involves tallying up people with some degree of baldness at a subway line for a wig company. While at the bottom of the well (of the abandoned house), Toru reminisces <b>about</b> <b>earlier</b> times with Kumiko, including their first date to an aquarium where they looked at jellyfish. He also experiences a dreamlike sequence where he enters a hotel room and speaks with a woman, and notices a strange blue mark on his cheek after he leaves the well. While loitering in the city, he spends most of the day sitting outside a donut shop and people-watching. Through this activity Toru encounters a well-dressed woman and also a singer he recognizes from his past, whom he follows and beats with a bat after getting ambushed by him.|$|E

2500|$|Estrada began {{training}} for his professional wrestling {{career in the}} nearby town of Villahermosa, Tabasco training under Indio Azteca, Maciste, El Remington I and El Chacal for his professional wrestling career. While {{training for}} a professional wrestling career he also learned the basics of Olympic style wrestling and also competed in bodybuilding competitions. His in ring debut came <b>about</b> <b>earlier</b> than expected as a local wrestling promoted asked Estrada to fill in for a wrestler who could not make that night's show. He made his debut that night working as the enmascarado (Masked wrestler) El Universitario ("The Academic" [...] or College Student), a name that reflected that he was still in wrestling school. As Universitario he teamed up with Ángel Azul and fought against the team of El Profeta and El Chilango Garcia. Later when he was ready to make his full-time debut Estrada bought a spare mask, boots and tights from Ángel Azul and began working as Príncipe Azul ("The Blue Prince"). As Príncipe Azul he found a lot of initial success, combining his mat skills with his very muscular physique, something less common in those days and ended up unmasking Ultratumba after defeating him in a Luchas de Apuestas, or bet match and later on would also force Ultratumba to be shaved bald. Later on he also won the hair of El Noruego as well. His early success as Príncipe Azul led to him being named the Villahermosa rookie of the year in 1972. In early 1973 Estrada decided he needed a new image, a unique image not based on the mask of his former partner. Inspired by the Mayan Indian warrior leader Jacinto Canek came up with the name of [...] "El Canek", complete with a redesigned mask and tights that incorporated mayana patterns and symbols. He worked his first match as [...] "El Canek" [...] (billed as [...] "Kanek" [...] for that one match only) in the Torero de Quatro Caminos ("The Four Cornered Bullfighting Ring") in Naucalpan, Mexican State, an arena he would sell out repeatedly later in his career.|$|E
