25|$|In September 2010, Silver King and Último Gladiador, {{two thirds}} of the stable Los Maniacos, {{announced}} they were joining La Sociedad, and although their stablemate Electroshock made no official announcement on whether or not he would be following them, he agreed to represent the group at Héroes Inmortales IV in order to get his hands on longtime rival Heavy Metal, who would represent AAA in the steel cage match between the two groups. After the event, during which Heavy Metal suffered an injury, which would sideline him for four months, Electroshock officially announced that he was not part of La Sociedad and urged Silver King and Último Gladiador to leave the group. At the November 18 event in Naucalpan he once again turned down an offer to join La Sociedad and was as a result beaten down by Silver King, Último Gladiador and La Milicia, turning him técnico in the process. When Heavy Metal returned from his injury on February 4, 2011, he and Electroshock entered a Best of Five series, with the loser having his hair shaved off. During the series, King and Gladiador tried to recruit Heavy Metal as the newest member of Los Maniacos and even interfered in several of the matches, but Heavy Metal made clear {{that he did not want}} to join them. The fifth match, a best two-out-of-three falls Bull Terrier match, took place on March 18 at Rey de Reyes, where Heavy Metal was victorious after a guitar shot, forcing Electroshock to have his hair shaved off. After the match both Electroshock and Heavy Metal were attacked by members of La Sociedad, bringing the former rivals together to fight a common enemy. Just two days later, Los Maniacos surprisingly lost the AAA World Tag Team Championship to Extreme Tiger and Jack Evans, after which Silver King and Último Gladiador were seemingly <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> up, but were brought back together by La Legión Extranjera member Chessman, with whom they would re–form Los Maniacos under the new name La Maniarquía. La Maniaquía was booked to settle their grudge with Electroshock and Heavy Metal at Triplemanía XIX in a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match, for which the técnicos recruited a veteran of hardcore wrestling, Joe Líder, whose partner, Nicho el Millonario, La Maniarquía had injured, as the third member of their team.|$|E

500|$|In {{seeking a}} {{temporary}} restraining order, government lawyers argued that The Progressive was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> the law, causing irreparable harm. The {{data in the}} article was born classified, so {{it did not matter}} that it was an original work of the author. They noted that prior restraint had been upheld by the courts before in matters of national security, and argued that the Pentagon Papers decision did not apply as the Atomic Energy Act specifically allowed for injunctive relief. Moreover, the Pentagon Papers were historical, whereas the hydrogen bomb was a current military weapon. Finally, they pointed out that the government had obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty not to assist non-nuclear states in acquiring nuclear weapons. In granting the temporary restraining order on March 9, Warren said that he would have [...] "to think long and hard before I gave the hydrogen bomb to Idi Amin." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, [...] "Together When..." [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} most music critics.

Call me sadistic, but the best moments in an Ayumi song are the parts where it sounds like she’s <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> ("Memorial Address"). This song is full of those moments." [...] In a similar review, a staff member at Channel-Ai awarded it five stars out of five, and believed that the song is one [...] "of her strongest ballads". The reviewer further explained, [...] "The emotion within the ballad is so infectious that the audience cannot help but feel empathy towards Ayumi." [...] A staff member at CD Journal enjoyed the song, labeling it a [...] "beautiful performance" [...] by Hamasaki; the reviewer also complimented the instrumentation and production, and how it [...] "melted together comfortably".|$|E
500|$|Frederick {{decided to}} raise the Duchy of Prussia to a kingdom. [...] Within the Holy Roman Empire, no one could call himself king except the emperor and the king of Bohemia. [...] However, Prussia was outside the empire, and the Hohenzollerns were fully {{sovereign}} over it. The practicability of this plan was doubted by some of his advisors, {{and in any case}} the crown was only valuable if recognized by the European nobility, most important the Holy Roman Emperor. In 1699, negotiations [...] were renewed with emperor Leopold I, who in turn was in need of allies since the War of the Spanish Succession was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> out. On 16 November 1700, the emperor approved Frederick's coronation in the Krontraktat ("Crown tract"). With respect to Poland-Lithuania, who held the provinces of Royal Prussia and Ermland, it was agreed that Frederick would call himself King in Prussia, instead of King of Prussia. Great Britain and the Dutch Republic, for similar reasons as the emperor, accepted Frederick's elevation prior to the coronation.|$|E
3000|$|What are the {{consequences}} of these two strategies? Substituting new multi-purpose crops when an old one falls short of expectations could become an endlessly repeating cycle. Decisions <b>about</b> how <b>to</b> <b>break</b> down a multi-purpose crop into separate ways to achieve separate things may end up conforming to economic pressures to pursue the products that generate the most financial reward—at the expense {{of some of the}} ideals of the bioeconomy. The future of cotton in Mpeketoni and of other post-jatropha projects elsewhere may provide clues of what is to come if the search for new ‘silver bullets’ and the strategic narrowing of objectives accompany efforts to pursue a plant-based economy.|$|R
