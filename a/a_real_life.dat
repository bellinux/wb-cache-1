5|$|Although {{the stories}} and {{characters}} were fictional, a number of elements had <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>life</b> background, taken from people whom Fleming knew or events he was aware of. These included the spy's name, which Fleming took from the American ornithologist James Bond, and the code number—007—which referred to the breaking of a World War I German diplomatic code. Some aspects of Bond's character and tastes replicate those of Fleming himself.|$|E

5|$|The plot of Lemon Tree {{was based}} on <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>life</b> incident. Israeli Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz moved to the border within Israel and the {{occupied}} territories and security forces began cutting down the Lemon trees beside his house, arguing {{that it could be}} used by terrorists as a hiding place. The Palestinian family who owned the trees sued the minister and took the case {{all the way to the}} Israeli Supreme Court. They lost, and their trees had to be cut down. Riklis watched a news blurb about the case online. He then developed the story further in a fictional setting. Riklis explicitly designed the protagonist's part for actress Hiam Abbass.|$|E
5|$|The other {{predominant}} rivalry {{heading into}} the event was between Matt Hardy and Edge, <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>life</b> issue transformed into a storyline. At SummerSlam, Edge defeated Hardy after dropping him onto {{the top of a}} ring post. This was scripted to caused Hardy to bleed heavily, which forced the referee to end the match and declare Edge the winner because Hardy could not continue. The next night on Raw, Hardy had a match with Rob Conway, in which Conway pinned Hardy for the win. After the match, Edge attacked Hardy. On the August 29 episode of Raw, Edge and Hardy were scheduled to compete in a Street Fight, a match where there are no disqualifications, no countouts, and scoring conditions can occur anywhere in the arena. The match ended in a no-contest after Hardy and Edge brawled at the stage ramp. Hardy grabbed Edge by the side and threw both himself and Edge off the stage and into electrical equipment. Both Hardy and Edge laid motionless on the floor as sparks flew everywhere. Trainers and emergency medical technicians rushed to the scene and took both men away in ambulances for medical attention. The following week, Bischoff booked Hardy and Edge in a steel cage match at Unforgiven, where the ring would be enclosed by a steel cage. Following the announcement, Bischoff scheduled a match between Hardy and Snitsky, which Hardy lost. After the match, Snitsky threatened to hit Hardy with a ring bell but The Big Show came down. He was unable to stop Snitsky, and as a result, Snitsky succeeded in hitting Hardy with the bell.|$|E

This is echoed {{by the fact that}} a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame was awarded to Pee-wee Herman rather than Paul Reubens.|$|E

500|$|Finally, in {{an essay}} called Origin of a Hero {{discussing}} his novel the Rector of Justin, author Louis Auchincloss says the main character was not based on a headmaster; certainly not as was often speculated Groton's famous Endicott Peabody. [...] "If you want to disguise <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>life</b> character," [...] Auchincloss advised fellow novelists, [...] "just change his profession."

The episode received a mostly positive response from critics, who praised Joss Whedon's involvement and Richards' performance, but were disappointed that the episode did not reach the standard of the MCU films. The use of the name 'Rising Tide' for the hacktivist group received backlash from <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>life</b> group of the same name.|$|E

500|$|In {{preparation}} for this episode, Mark Kirkland watched several boxing films and is satisfied with how it turned out. Whenever designing rooms, Kirkland tries to show a bare lightbulb because he feels that it makes things more depressing. In the scene in Moe's office, there is a brief shot of a poster advertising [...] "Szyslak Vs. Oakley" [...] and [...] "Kirkland Vs. Silverman", referring to then-executive producer Bill Oakley and The Simpsons directors Mark Kirkland and David Silverman.

Trapper John Fitzgerald refers to the area of modern-day Texas as if it is a part of the Union or an aligned territory.
