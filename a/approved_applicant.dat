40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Securing transportation systems and facilities requires balancing security to address potential threats while facilitating the flow of people and goods that are critical to the U. S. economy and necessary for supporting international commerce. As we have previously reported, these systems and facilities are vulnerable and difficult to secure given their size, easy accessibility, large number of potential targets, and proximity to urban areas. To help enhance the security of these systems and facilities, the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (MTSA) required the Secretary of Homeland Security to prescribe regulations preventing individuals from having unescorted access to secure areas of MTSA-regulated facilities and vessels unless they both possess a biometric transportation security card and are authorized to be in such an area. MTSA further tasked the Secretary with the responsibility to issue biometric transportation security cards to eligible individuals unless the Secretary determines that an applicant poses a security risk warranting denial of the card. The Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) {{program is designed to}} implement these biometric maritime security card requirements. The program requires maritime workers to undergo a background check to obtain a biometric identification card. This card is required for an individual to be eligible for unescorted access to secure areas of vessels and facilities. It is still the responsibility of facility and vessel owners to determine who should be granted access to their facilities or vessels. Within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and the United States Coast Guard are responsible for implementing and enforcing the TWIC program. TSA's responsibilities include enrolling TWIC applicants, conducting background checks to assess individuals' potential security threat, and issuing TWICs. In January 2007, TSA contracted out TWIC enrollment center operations to enroll applicants and issue TWICs to approved applicants. This contract expires in June 2012. The Coast Guard is responsible for developing TWIC-related security regulations and ensuring that MTSA-regulated maritime facilities and vessels are in compliance with these regulations. In addition, DHS's Screening Coordination Office (SCO) facilitates coordination among the various DHS components involved in TWIC, such as TSA and the Coast Guard, as well as the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), which, through an interagency agreement, personalizes the credentials and ships them to enrollment centers, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which administers grant funds in support of the TWIC program. Section 818 (b) (1) of the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2010 provides that the Comptroller General shall submit a report to the House Committee on Homeland Security and the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation assessing the costs, technical feasibility, and security measures associated with procedures to (1) deliver a transportation security card (i. e., a TWIC) to an approved applicant's place of residence in a secure manner or (2) allow an <b>approved</b> <b>applicant</b> to receive the card at an enrollment center of the individual's choosing [...] ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} a housing assistance program on school enrollment, child labor and poverty reduction among poor families in Ecuador.

Results show that the program improves enrollment into post-compulsory education, decreases the probability that a child participates in the labor market and reduces the likelihood to live in poverty. Potential mediating factors are increased access to sanitation, better quality materials of the house and a reduced probability to live overcrowded...|$|R

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) Adjudication Center performance data show mixed results, and the center's performance measurement practices have limitations. The Adjudication Center relies on contractors to adjudicate security threat assessments and uses three primary measures to evaluate their performance [...] timeliness for completing adjudication, adjudication accuracy, and caseload status. GAO found that the Adjudication Center contractor met its timeliness and accuracy measures, but faced challenges in meeting its caseload measure. The Adjudication Center's timeliness and accuracy measures did not capture key data. According to TSA officials, the Adjudication Center's accuracy rate {{is based on a}} review of all cases where adjudicators had disqualified an applicant. However, this calculation generally does not include the accuracy rate for those <b>applicants</b> adjudicators had <b>approved</b> [...] which account for roughly 90 percent of the Adjudication Center's caseload. In this way, the accuracy rate provides a limited assessment of adjudicator performance.

40|$|This paper {{builds on}} the credit-scoring {{literature}} and proposes a method to calculate portfolio credit risk. Individual default risk estimates are used to compose a value-at-risk (VaR) measure of credit risk. In general, credit-scoring models suffer from a sample-selection bias. The starting point is therefore to estimate an unbiased scoring model using the bivariate probit approach. The paper uses a large data set with Swedish consumer credit data that contains extensive financial and personal information on both rejected and <b>approved</b> <b>applicants.</b> We study how marginal changes in a default-risk-based acceptance rule would shift {{the size of the}} bankÕs loan portfolio, its VaR exposure and average credit losses. Finally, we compare the risk in the sample portfolio with that in an efficiently provided portfolio of equal size. The results show that {{the size of a small}} consumer loan does not affect associated default risk, implying that the bank provides loans in a way that is not consistent with default-risk minimization. VaR calculations indicate that an efficient selection (by means of a default-riskbased rule) of loan applicants can reduce credit risk by up to 80 %...|$|R
