5|$|A common {{plot device}} is referenced, where a {{shoulder}} angel (represents conscience) and a shoulder devil (representing temptation) appear near a character. This concept is spoofed in the episode, {{as both the}} devil and the angel suggest to Mackey that he should drink the beer. When Stan tells Kyle what he thinks a bris means, a dolly zoom is used, which is <b>an</b> <b>unsettling</b> filmmaking effect often used {{to show that a}} character is undergoing a major realization. The hallucinogenic effects of certain drugs are portrayed by different means. When inhaling cannabis, the alley that Mr. Mackey is in suddenly turns very colorful. After taking LSD, Mackey's head inflates like a giant balloon, and then literally detaches from his body, and floats away (the boys interact with Mackey by looking up at his head as it floats over them).|$|E

5|$|Photography was {{provided}} by Willy Hameister, {{who went on to}} work with Wiene on several other films. The camera does not play a large part in Caligari, and is used primarily to show the sets. The cinematography tends to alternate only between medium shots at straight-on angles and abrupt close-ups {{to create a sense of}} shock, but with few long shots or panning movement. Likewise, there is very little interscene editing. Most scenes follow the other without intercutting, which gives Caligari a more theatrical feel than a cinematic one. Heavy lighting is typically absent from the film, heightening the sense of darkness prevalent in the story. However, lighting is occasionally used to intensify the uneasiness created by the distortions of the sets. For example, when Cesare first awakens at the fair, a light is shone directly on a close-up of his heavily made-up face to create <b>an</b> <b>unsettling</b> glow. Additionally, lighting is used in a then-innovative way to cast a shadow against the wall during the scene in which Cesare kills Alan, so the viewer sees only the shadow and not the figures themselves. Lighting techniques like this became frequently used in later German films.|$|E

Also the intake manifold was changed to include a dual length system which involved intake runners of two different lengths and a valve to switch between the two. Changes were also made to the suspension with the aim of providing a more supple ride, but drew criticism for producing nervous handling and <b>an</b> <b>unsettling</b> feeling of roll oversteer (a problem not corrected until the EL facelift).|$|E

In charge of the game's fifty sound effects, Yamaoka wanted to surprise the player with different sounds and create <b>an</b> <b>unsettling</b> environment.

500|$|The {{critical}} {{response to}} The Turn of the Screw was mixed. The film was praised by Matt Baylis, writing in The Express, {{as one of}} the better adaptations of James's story. The Timess David Chater, although he did not consider the film [...] "terrifying" [...] or [...] "suppurate in evil", found it [...] "never less than absorbing", suspecting this would be particularly so for viewers unfamiliar with the story. The Daily Telegraphs Simon Horsford felt that The Turn of the Screw [...] "might not work on all levels but it is <b>an</b> <b>unsettling</b> interpretation nonetheless". By contrast, Tom Sutcliffe, writing in The Independent, was unimpressed with the film, considering James's novel to have been [...] "comprehensively vandalised", while Richard Whittaker, writing in The Austin Chronicle, felt that the film was [...] "a particular and peculiar misfire" [...] from Welch. The Turn of the Screw was chosen as [...] "pick of the day" [...] in The Sunday Times, despite the reviewer, Victoria Segal, expressing her view that the film was [...] "far from perfect". But she added that the flaws could be overlooked, and although there are times [...] "when it grinds through the gears with a clunk and clatter", the [...] "spirit" [...] of James's story is retained.|$|E

For Debnath, [...] "the best was saved till last", but the whole episode was [...] "tightly written". Patrick Mulkern (Radio Times), too, said that [...] "this dark tale soon works a devilish spell". Christine Brandel, writing for {{entertainment}} website PopMatters, particularly praised the episode's [...] "beautifully done" [...] dialogue, saying that [...] "it feels authentic in its phrasing, even during the more bizarre (and hilarious) court scenes". Owen, similarly, said [...] "the dialogue was also frequently hilarious, with Shearsmith and Pemberton having a fine ear for the rhythms of Olde English {{and how best to}} have characters deadpan their way through some ridiculous sentences." [...] Hawksley praised Warner's [...] "effortlessly batty" [...] performance as Sir Andrew Pike, and claimed that Sheen [...] "brought <b>an</b> <b>unsettling</b> complexity" [...] to the title character. Gerard Gilbert, of The Independent, claimed Warner was clearly [...] "having a ball" [...] as Pike, and Wright (The Guardian) said [...] "Warner quite brilliantly makes the most of every line he's given".

The video refuses to take sides, as there's no winner when a conflict turns to violence." [...] Young men are beaten, choked, sprayed with mace and dragged across the concrete as Frank Ocean soulfully croons, [...] "Will he make it out alive?" [...] in time with the staged anarchy. [...] By the end of the five-minute video, [...] "the freedom fighters seem to have notched a victory of some sort, standing in triumph in the face of their oppressors. But even if a single battle is won, there is no conclusive ending, meaning that the war still rages on." [...] Popping up at the end of the clip is an actual elephant, chained at the neck and trying to resist getting choked to death. Pitchfork gave the clip a positive review, however noted [...] "Kanye's [...] "you will not control the threesome"/"never fuck nobody without telling me" [...] verse seems pretty out of place when you're watching a cop get set on fire." ...|$|E
500|$|In August 2010, Games {{stated that}} That We Can Play would be {{released}} in late September or early October 2010. However, when the release date and track list were announced on September 9 the release date had been pushed back to November 2. The EP, distributed by Hippos in Tanks with cover artwork by Christian [...] "Megazord" [...] Oldham and cover design by Rasmus Emanuel Svensson, was positively received by critics. In a November 3, 2010 review Steve Shaw praised That We Can Play for its accurate references to 1980s music, writing that the EP [...] "resides in a both unsettled and <b>an</b> <b>unsettling</b> state, with hints of something very strong and unique perhaps being tied down by exploring more recognisable formats". Shaw recommended it to his readers, giving it a rating of four out of five. In a Boston Globe review Michael Brodeur described the EP as [...] "unrelentingly retro, but intriguingly interstitial", with a smoothness which [...] "sounds like a familiar future". Joe Colly of Pitchfork Media called That We Can Play [...] "a quirky and technical treat" [...] but criticized the EP's brevity, lamenting the omission of previous Games singles [...] "Everything Is Working" [...] and [...] "Heartlands". That We Can Play was ranked eighth on Gorilla vs. Bear's list of the top 30 albums of 2010; according to Chris Cantalini, [...] "The run time here is slight, but the EP's brevity works in its favor, as there's not a wasted second on this thing." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1965, Warner {{surprised}} many industry observers when {{he purchased}} {{the rights to}} Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, Edward Albee's searing play about a destructive marriage. [...] From the beginning, the project was beset by controversy. Ernest Lehman's script, which was extremely faithful to Albee's play, stretched the U.S. film industry's Production Code to the limit. [...] Jack Valenti, who just assumed leadership of the Motion Picture Association of America, recalled that a meeting with Warner and studio aide Ben Kalmenson left him [...] "uneasy". [...] "I was uncomfortable {{with the thought that}} this was just the beginning of <b>an</b> <b>unsettling</b> new era in film, in which we would lurch from crisis to crisis without any suitable solution in sight," [...] Valenti wrote. Meanwhile, Lehman and the film's director, Mike Nichols, battled with studio executives and exhibitors who insisted that the film be shot in color rather than black and white. [...] These controversies soon faded into the background while Jack Warner challenged the validity of the production code by publicly requiring theaters showing the film to post an [...] "Adults only" [...] label and restrict tickets sales accordingly, all as a marketing tease to entice audiences to see what warranted that restriction. At this, the MPAA — wary of a repeat of the embarrassment it had trying to censor the highly acclaimed film, The Pawnbroker — gave in and approved the film as a special exception because of its quality, which led to other filmmakers to challenge the code themselves even more aggressively. Upon its release, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? was embraced by audiences and critics alike. [...] It secured 13 nominations from the Academy including one for Best Picture of 1966.|$|E
500|$|Dek Hogan of Digital Spy stated he [...] "really enjoyed" [...] {{the episode}} {{and it was}} [...] "beautifully dark". He later {{described}} it as [...] "a chilling tale" [...] and [...] "a cracker". Now Playing magazine reviewer Arnold T Blumburg gave [...] "The Unquiet Dead" [...] a grade of A-, describing it as [...] "spectacular", though he noted there were [...] "a few hiccups, such as the weak and convenient plot point that forces the Gelth ... to be drawn out of their human hosts by {{the mere presence of}} gas". He also criticised Eccleston for making the Doctor appear an [...] "ineffectual goof", and noted that he played no role in the resolution. In 2013, Mark Braxton of Radio Times described the episode as [...] "a sparkling script, as crisp and inviting as a winter wonderland", praising the magical atmosphere and the treatment of Dickens. However, he felt that [...] "the spectral swirlings are all a bit Raiders of the Lost Ark". In Who Is the Doctor, a guide to the revived series, Graeme Burk felt that [...] "The Unquiet Dead" [...] was [...] "terribly, terribly disappointing" [...] on first viewing, as Rose and the Doctor's characterisation did not drive the plot and the story was reduced to playing it safe and being [...] "ordinary", as it just made the aliens evil instead of discussing their morality. Despite this, he wrote that the story was still enjoyable, with a [...] "delightfully ludicrous" [...] set-up, [...] "vividly realized" [...] period setting, and the characterisation of Dickens. Burk's coauthor, Robert Smith? , called the episode a [...] "complete mess". He felt that Gatiss was attempting to recreate the classic series, but that it came across as [...] "half-hearted". He felt that there was no moral dilemma and Sneed underwent <b>an</b> <b>unsettling</b> character change. While he noted that Eccleston and Piper were [...] "excellent", he felt that Rose and the Doctor's developing relationship was not subtle.|$|E
