40|$|The {{pharmaceutical}} companies {{are getting more}} inclined towards patient support programs (PSPs) which assist patients and/or healthcare professionals (HCPs) in more desirable disease management and cost-effective treatment. The utmost objective of these programs is patient care. The PSPs may include financial assistance to patients, medicine compliance programs, <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>HCPs</b> via phone or online chat centers, etc. The PSP has {{a crucial role in}} terms of customer acquisition and retention strategies. During the conduct of these programs, Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) may receive information related to concerned medicinal products, which is usually reported by patients or involved HCPs. This information may include suspected adverse reaction(s) during/after administration of medicinal products. Hence, the MAH should design PSP to comply with regulatory reporting requirements and avoid non-compliance during PV inspection. The emergence of wireless health devices is lowering the burden on patients to manually incorporate safety data, and building a significant option for patients to observe major swings in reference to drug safety. Therefore, to enhance the adoption of these programs, MAH not only needs to aware patients about advantages of the program, but also recognizes the importance of time of patients and commitments made in a constructive manner. It is indispensable that strengthening the public health is considered as the topmost priority in such programs, and the MAH is compliant to Pharmacovigilance (PV) requirements along with regulatory obligations...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Healthcare {{providers}} (HCPs) {{can play}} an important role in supporting the sexual health of older adults; however, we know little about the experiences of older people in talking <b>to</b> <b>HCPs</b> about sex. This article examines older adults' experiences and perceptions of talking <b>to</b> <b>HCPs</b> about sex. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 30 men and 23 women aged 60 and older recruited from a national, online survey of older Australians. Data were analysed using a thematic approach. RESULTS: Most participants did not discuss sex with their HCP, and their HCP did not raise it. For those who did discuss sex with a HCP, negative and stigmatising responses were common. Positive responses could facilitate <b>access</b> <b>to</b> sexual health care.

40|$|Background: Analgesics {{are used}} in the {{management}} of chronic non-malignant pain (CNMP), a condition which is highly prevalent among older adults. CNMP may not only be physically distressing but also complicated by psychosocial and economic factors. An individual’s perception and use of analgesics may be influenced by a range of factors such as perceptions of risk or benefits, ability to purchase medication or <b>access</b> <b>to</b> non-pharmacological therapies or specialist care. Objective: The aim {{of this study was to}} describe the perceptions and experiences of analgesics by ageing and elderly individuals with CNMP and identify factors that influence their use. Setting: Telephone interviews with 28 members of Chronic Pain Ireland aged ≥ 50. Method: In-depth semi-structured interviews; audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and thematically analysed. Main outcome measure Experiences and perceptions of ageing and elderly individuals with CNMP taking analgesics. Results: A combination of factors specific to the patient and arising from outside influences informed perceptions and experiences of analgesics. Pain severity, perceived efficacy of analgesics, occurrence of adverse-effects and concerns about addiction/dependence were identified as internal factors influencing medication use. External factors included views of family members, <b>access</b> <b>to</b> specialised care and the individual’s interaction with healthcare professionals (HCPs). Conclusion: Individuals with CNMP regard analgesics as an important method for managing pain and are relied upon when other interventions are difficult <b>to</b> <b>access.</b> <b>HCPs</b> in primary care, who are the main point of contact for patients, need to take into account the various factors that may influence analgesic use when consulting with this patient group...|$|R

This result improves upon the previously best known approach which results in cubic growth {{in the size of the}} instance. We further prove that the quadratic function is reduced to a linear function if the maximum initial degree is bounded above by a constant. Motivated by this result, we describe an algorithm <b>to</b> convert general <b>HCP</b> <b>to</b> <b>HCP</b> of bounded degree and prove that it results in only linear growth.

40|$|Abstract. The {{exceptional}} high hardness of {{lath martensite}} in quenched Fe-C steels {{is explained by}} the Engel-Brewer valence electron theory for crystal structures. The theory predicts the transformation sequence FCC-HCP-BCC with FCC iron as Fe 3 v, HCP iron as Fe 2 v, BCC iron as Fe 1 v and carbon as C 4 v. Electronic compatibility requires transformation from FCC <b>to</b> <b>HCP</b> <b>to</b> form two separate components. Carbon-rich clusters of C 4 v with 8 Fe 3 v atoms are distributed uniformly in a carbon-free matrix of HCP Fe 2 v atoms. The carbon-iron clusters are viewed as particle-like, calculated as 0. 63 nm in size, and {{is responsible for the}} high strength of martensite. The carbon-free region experiences shear deformation during FCC <b>to</b> <b>HCP</b> transformation leading <b>to</b> work hardened fine grains. Subsequent transformation to BCC iron maintains the same size carbon cluster with additional shearing deformation during <b>HCP</b> <b>to</b> BCC formation in the carbon-free region. Tempering studies of quenched martensite are shown to support the carbon-iron cluster model...|$|R

The aim of this study was <b>to</b> investigate whether <b>HCP</b> was associated with discernible alterations in gray matter volume (GMV) using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Methods: 1455 young adults (18 – 25 years) were screened to identify 23 with exposure <b>to</b> <b>HCP</b> (minimum 3 years duration, 12 episodes per year, frequently involving objects) and 22 healthy controls. High-resolution T 1 -weighted MRI datasets were obtained using Siemens 3 T trio scanner. Results: GMV was reduced by 19. 1 % in the right medial frontal gyrus (medial prefrontal cortex; MPFC, BA 10) (P= 0. 037, corrected cluster level), by 14. 5 % in the left medial frontal gyrus (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; DLPFC, BA 9) (P= 0. 015, uncorrected cluster level) and by 16. 9 % in the right anterior cingulate gyrus (BA 24) (Pb 0. 001, uncorrected cluster level) of HCP subjects.
