40|$|ABSTRACT. The “self, ” or “person ” is an {{intriguing}} but challenging {{topic in the}} social sciences.

Here, the person or “self ” emerges not as a reified, static attribute, but as part of a dynamic process.

40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} germs of holomorphic vector fields {{near the}} origin of C 2 with a saddle-node singularity, and the induced singular foliations. In a previous article we described the invariants addressing the <b>analytical</b> <b>classification</b> of these vector fields. They split into three parts: a formal, an orbital and a tangential component. For a fixed formal class, the orbital invariant (associated to the foliation) was obtained by Martinet and Ramis; we give it an integral representation. We then derive examples of non-orbitally conjugated foliations {{by the use of}} a “first-step” normal form, whose first-significative jet is an invariant. The tangential invariant also admits an integral representation, hence we derive explicit examples of vector fields, inducing the same foliation, that are not mutually conjugated. In addition, we provide a family of normal forms for vector fields orbitally equivalent to the model of Poincaré–Dulac...|$|E

The role and efficiency played by painting to determine the plastic language of photography have always been defended in all related researches and arguments done so far.

40|$|Any robust {{classification}} system {{depends on its}} purpose and must refer to accepted standards, its strength relying on predictive values and a careful consideration of known factors that can affect its reliability. In this context, a molecular classification of human cancer must refer to the current gold standard (histological classification) and try to improve it with key prognosticators for metastatic potential, staging and grading. Although organ-specific examples have been published based on proteomics, transcriptomics and genomics evaluations, the most popular approach uses gene expression analysis as a direct correlate of cellular differentiation, which represents the key feature of the histological classification.

One of the most important class of three-dimensional singularities is terminal singularities, which arise within minimal models programm.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a methodology for the computational learning and classification of a Systemic Functional Grammar. A {{machine learning algorithm}} is developed that allows {{the structure of the}} classifier learned to be a representation of the grammar. Within Systemic Functional Linguistics, Systemic Functional Grammar is a model of language that has explicitly probabilistic distributions and overlapping categories. Mixture modeling is the most natural way to represent this, so the algorithm developed {{is one of the few}} machine learners that extends mixture modeling to supervised learning, retaining the desirable property that it is also able to discover intrinsic unlabelled categories. As a Systemic Function Grammar includes theories of context, syntax, semantics, function and lexis, it is a particularly difficult concept to learn, and this thesis presents the first attempt to infer and apply a truly probabilistic Systemic Functional Grammar. Because of this, the machine learning algorithm is benchmarked against a collection of state-ofthe- art learners on some well-known data sets. It is shown to be comparably accurate and particularly good at discovering and exploiting attribute correlation, and in this way it can also be seen as a linearly scalable solution to the Naïve Bayes attribute independence assumption. With a focus on function at the level of form, the methodology is shown to infer an accurate functional grammar that classifies with above 90 % accuracy, even across registers of text that are fundamentally very different from the one that was learned on. The discovery of unlabelled functions occurred with a high level of sophistication, and so the proposed methodology has very broad potential as an <b>analytical</b> and/or <b>classification</b> tool in a functional approach to Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing...|$|R

40|$|The {{acceleration}} of relativistic particles due to repeated scattering across a shock wave {{remains the most}} attractive model {{for the production of}} energetic cosmic rays. This process has been analyzed extensively {{during the past two decades}} using the ``two-fluid'' model of diffusive shock acceleration. It is well known that 1, 2, or 3 distinct solutions for the flow structure can be found depending on the upstream parameters. The precise nature of the critical conditions delineating the number and character of shock transitions has remained unclear, mainly due to the inappropriate choice of parameters used in the determination of the upstream boundary conditions. We derive the exact critical conditions by reformulating the upstream boundary conditions in terms of two individual Mach numbers defined with respect to the cosmic-ray and gas sound speeds, respectively. The gas and cosmic-ray adiabatic indices are assumed to remain constant throughout the flow, although they may have arbitrary, independent values. Our results provide for the first time a complete, <b>analytical</b> <b>classification</b> of the parameter space of shock transitions in the two-fluid model.

40|$|Supernova neutrinos can {{exhibit a}} rich variety of flavor {{conversion}} mechanisms. In particular, they can experience "fast" self-induced flavor conversions almost immediately above the core. Very recently, a novel method {{has been proposed}} to investigate these phenomena, {{in terms of the}} dispersion relation for the complex frequency and wave number (Ï 8 ̆ 9,k) of disturbances in the mean field of the Î½eÎ½x flavor coherence. We discuss a systematic approach to such instabilities, originally developed in the context of plasma physics, and based of the time-asymptotic behavior of the Green's function of the system. Instabilities are typically seen to emerge for complex Ï 8 ̆ 9 and can be further characterized as convective (moving away faster than they spread) and absolute (growing locally), depending on k-dependent features. Stable cases emerge when k (but not Ï 8 ̆ 9) is complex, leading to disturbances damped in space, or when both Ï 8 ̆ 9 and k are real, corresponding to complete stability. The <b>analytical</b> <b>classification</b> of both unstable and stable modes leads not only to qualitative insights about their features but also to quantitative predictions about the growth rates of instabilities. Representative numerical solutions are discussed in a simple two-beam model of interacting neutrinos.
