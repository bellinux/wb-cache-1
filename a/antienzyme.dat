40|$|Abstract: Wild {{mushrooms}} traditionally {{are considered}} one of the sources of food fibers, vegetable proteins, macro-and- micronutrients, and also flavor components. However, the composition of mushrooms includes antinutritional substances capable to selectively reduce the absorption of certain nutrients. These are primarily <b>antienzymes</b> or proteinase inhibitors, which reduce the absorption of proteins. Previous studies have indicated applicability of vacuum-pulse drying to improve the nutritional value in the edible mushrooms (Cantharellus cibarius Fr.) autohydrolysis of bodies biopolymers of the mushrooms and increase of the rate of swelling in hot water. The possibility of applying a vacuum-pulse drying for increasing the content of free amino acids and reduction of the activity of trypsin inhibitors in edible mushrooms: chanterelles and autumn agarics (Cantharellus cibarius Fr.) is shown in this study. In addition, it is established, that the vacuum-pulse method of drying leads to reduction of flavor components content in the edible mushrooms. To study human body digestibility of vacuum-dried product further research is required. The effect of vacuum-pulse drying on flavor properties of mushrooms continues to be a controversial question...|$|R
40|$|When {{influenza}} virus was mixed with antisera to its surface subunits before inoculation of cell cultures, anti-hemagglutinin antibodies neutralized infectivity but anti-neuraminidase did not. When the antisera were added after infection of cell cultures, anti-hemagglutinin and anti-neuraminidase antibodies were equally {{effective in reducing}} virus titers in culture fluids. Decreased virus titers were not due to interference of antibody with assay and were not accompanied by {{a reduction in the}} synthesis of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase subunits. Both antisera also effectively prevented in vitro virus spread. Inhibition of virus release by neuraminidase antibody appeared unrelated to its <b>antienzyme</b> property. Hydrolysis of N-acetyl neuraminic acid residues of infected host cells proceeded unimpaired in the presence of subunit antisera. Anti-hemagglutinin and anti-neuraminidase antibodies may act to prevent virus release by binding newly formed virus subunits {{to each other and to}} anti-genically altered cell membranes...|$|E
40|$|An {{apparent}} {{inhibition of}} induction of mouse hepatic tryptophan oxygenase by endotoxin {{has been reported}} previously, as evidenced by low catalytic activity. This could be due either to decreased tryptophan oxygenase levels or to inactivation of existing enzyme molecules. To resolve this question, the enzyme was quantitated immunologically in control and endotoxin-poisoned mice. Tryptophan oxygenase was purified and used as an antigen to prepare <b>antienzyme</b> antibodies. The antiserum was shown to be monospecific by immuno-electrophoresis. Addition of the antiserum to high-speed supernatant fluids of liver homogenates of control or endotoxin-poisoned mice resulted in precipitation of the enzyme. Radial immunodiffusion assays revealed that there was less enzyme in livers of mice that received 1 mean lethal dose of endotoxin. It was concluded that endotoxin interfered with the synthetic process that results in enhanced levels of tryptophan oxygenase...|$|E

Novel subcellular fractionation procedures {{were developed to}} study, by the pulse-chase technique and by internalization assays, the pathway along which two microvillar hydrolases, sucrase-isomaltase and dipeptidylpeptidase IV, are transported to lysosomes in the differentiated colon adenocarcinoma cell line Caco- 2. 7 - 9 % of metabolically labeled sucrase-isomaltase of dipeptidylpeptidase IV were present in lysosomes after 7 - 8 h of chase as intact complex- glycosylated molecules. Appearance of these enzymes in lysosomes was biphasic. Endocytosis studies with radioiodinated <b>antienzyme</b> monoclonal antibodies (monovalent antigen-binding fragments) and by means of cell surface iodination revealed only slow transport of the enzymes to lysosomes at a low level. However, both enzymes were internalized with different efficiencies and recycled to the cell surface via endosomes.

40|$|The enzyme renin, {{found in}} the kidney (1) and {{extracts}} of other organs and blood vessels (2), {{has been shown to}} induce an elevation in blood pressure (3), by acting on a plasma protein substrate to release a decapeptide, angiotensin I, which is subsequently converted to the potent pressor Substance, angiotensin II (4). In addition, this enzyme system has been shown {{to play a role in}} the control of aldosterone secretion (5). Developing knowledge of the physiologic role of renin has been summarized in a recent symposium (6). Impeding progress in this area is the lack of a sensitive, practical assay for renin. The several assays which have emerged measure, in the main, angiotensin and are complicated and the results obtained contradictory (6).

40|$|Long-term type 2 {{diabetes}} {{can lead}} to numerous biological complications, such as hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Key enzymes involved in the enzymatic breakdown of complex carbohydrates, pancreatic α-amylase and intestinal α-glucosidase, have been targeted as potential avenues for modulation of {{type 2 diabetes}}-associated post-prandial hyperglycemia through mild inhibition of their enzymatic activities so as to decrease meal-derived glucose absorption. Further, inhibition of hypertension-linked angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) was targeted as a potential approach for modulation of diabetes-linked hypertension. Watersoluble extracts of soybean optimized for phenolic content via sprouting or bioprocessing by dietary fungus (Rhizopus oligosporus, Lentinus edodes) were investigated for inhibitory activity against porcine pancreatic α-amylase (PPA), yeast α-glucosidase, and rabbit lung ACE in vitro. PPA was allowed to react with each phenolic-optimized extract and the derivatized enzyme-phytochemical mixtures obtained were characterized for residual amylase activity. α-Glucosidase and ACE activities were determined {{in the presence of}} each phenolic-optimized extract. All of the soybean extracts possessed marked anti-amylase activity, with extracts of R. oligosporus-bioprocessed soybean having the strongest inhibitory activity, but only slight anti-glucosidase activity.

40|$|BACKGROUND Diabetic neuropathy, {{retinopathy}} and nephropathy are {{the chronic}} complications of diabetes mellitus. Neuropathy, retinopathy and nephropathy are microvascular complication of diabetes mellitus. Antioxidant status is reduced in DM-induced retinopathy and nephropathy. Present study is undertaken {{to evaluate the}} degree of oxidative stress in diabetic neuropathy patients. The aim {{of the study is}} to study on oxidative stress as measured by lipid peroxidation marker, malondialdehyde and <b>antienzyme</b> status in type II DM patients with neuropathy and compared them with a controlled nondiabetic group. MATERIALS AND METHODS The study included 100 subjects from Sapthagiri Medical College, Bangalore, from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2015, of age group 50 to 70 yrs. out of which 50 patients were non-insulin-dependent DM with neuropathy and rest 50 age and sex matched apparently healthy individuals (control group). Antioxidant status was assessed by measuring superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), Catalase and Reduced Glutathione (GSH). RESULTS It showed a significant increase p< 0. 001 in FBS, PPBS, TC, TG, LDL, VLDL, CAT, MDA, while HDL, GSH, GPX, GR and SOD were found to be decreased significantly (p 0. 001). CONCLUSION MDA was significantly elevated in diabetic group, whereas antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and reduced glutathione were significantly decreased, which might be helpful in risk assessment of various complications of DM. The data suggests that alteration in antioxidant status and MDA may help to predict the risk of diabetic neuropathy. ...|$|E
40|$|Orally and {{intravenously}} administered glucose yields comparable {{levels of}} glucose in plasma but different responses of insulin-release. Specialised mucosa cells react to glucose contents in chyme with release of glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1) into the portal bloodstream, a peptide hormone, that makes beta-cells {{more sensitive to}} the subsequent glucose stimulus and thereby enhances the insulin-release exclusively under increased blood glucose levels without causing the insulin-release directly. The capacity of this entero-insular axis is limited primarily by the endogenous enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV). Prevailingly the most progressive approach to therapy of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) in human medicine is targeted on the inhibition of DPP-IV, in order to raise GLP- 1 concentration in plasma and to increase consequently the insulin-release in dependence on elevated blood glucose levels. In the limelight of discussion are the advantages of certain avoidance of insulin-caused hypoglycaemia {{on the one hand and}} the possibility of oral administration of the <b>antienzyme</b> on the other hand. In contrast to the condition in dogs, where the disease manifests almost exclusively in the form of secondary (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus, the type 2 (NIDDM) predominates in humans as well as in cats, whence it comes that the employment of oral antidiabetics in the latter species is quite promising, as the experience with the sulfonyl urea derivative glipizide has shown. As however the residual capacity of beta-cells of feline diabetics with regard to the release of endogenous insulin is subject to considerable variation, the risk of inducing hypoglycaemia is given by use of both insulin and sulfonyl urea derivatives, whereas this threat is circumvented by use of DPP-IV-inhibitors. In the present thesis the effect of DPP-IV inhibition on the elimination kinetics of GLP- 1 is described by means of systematically combined infusion of the enzyme’s substrate (GLP- 1) and its <b>antienzyme</b> in the rat model. The maximum effective dose of DPP-IV inhibitor is determined and the portion of hepatic clearance and whole blood clearance of total elimination of GLP- 1 without concurrent DPP-IV inhibition is quantified approximately by means of isolated perfused rat livers and in-vitro-experiments. Finally the dependence of results on the respective experimental design is demonstrated. The total clearance of GLP- 1 as substrate of DPP-IV without concurrent inhibition amounts to at least 57 ± 17 (mL/min) /kg and under influence of the DPP-IV-inhibitor to at least 22 ± 2 (mL/min) /kg. The value of clearance is highly dependent on the respective substrate concentration in plasma, so that the values range from 139 ± 57 (mL/min) /kg to 73 ± 15 (mL/min) /kg within the bounds of physiological GLP- 1 concentrations in plasma. The maximum increase of GLP- 1 levels in plasma (factor 3. 4) on average of all GLP- 1 infusion rates was attained by a DPP-IV inhibitor concentration in plasma of 0. 4 µmol/L. The liver as central detoxication-organ figures out at 57 % (34 / 60) of total clearance, the soluble DPP-IV fraction in plasma however accounts for only about 1 % (0. 7 / 60) of total clearance. The relatively low hepatic extraction ratio of 30 ± 11 % reversely allows seven out of ten GLP- 1 molecules to enter the systemic circulation in spite of the first-pass-effect and thereby to reach possibly the receptors on the beta-cells (70 % bioavailability). The half-life of GLP- 1 (7 - 36 amide) in the isolated perfused rat liver amounts to 5. 0 ± 1. 3 minutes, hereby differing statistically not significantly (p = 0. 114) from the half-life of GLP- 1 (7 - 37) with 6. 1 ± 1. 6 minutes...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical references(pages 90 - 105) The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} fifty se??lected studies with respect to adequacy of research design; and secondly, to analyze the degree of agreement among these selected studies as they detail the effects of L. S. D. - 25. Fifty studies published during the past ten years were reviewed,discussed and critiqued. As will be seen,these studies vary considerably in adequacy of scien??tific approach as well as in degree of acceptability of conclusions reached. In most of these studies, L. S. D. - 25 was found to have a profound effect on the central nervous system; however, the manner in which these effects were produced are still unsolved. Some studies suggest that the drug functions as an enzyme,while others show its action as an <b>antienzyme.</b> Among the studies on the effect of L. S. D. - 25 on the electroencephalogram (EEG. There were conflicts between the EEG results of studies in animals and the observations of the effects in man as well as interspecies conflicts. The drug could be found to effect cerebral functions in both directions of efficacy as its serum level either rose or fell. One study showed a functioning retina was prerequisite to the appearance of L. S. D. - 25 triggered hallucinations;while another found that a functioning retina was not necessary for projection of hallucinations. L. S. D. - 25 does not appear to be physio??logically addicting but tolerance to the drug appears to develop rapidly in human subjects and in some animals. Among studies investigating side effects, one case study demonstrated chromosomal damage in human leukocytes induced by L. S. D. - 25; while another case study concluded that the drug may have induced seizures in one human subject. In another study seizure -like activity was produced in animals with a very low dose of L. S. D. - 25. From the reports reviewed, it appears that objec??tivity is hard to achieve in studies investigating the effects of L. S. D. - 25. Some of those actively in investigating the drug have themselves become users. In most of the studies reviewed, the samples were small and frequently the method of sample selection was not stated in the report. In some reports the impression derived from data presented did not support the conclusions the investigators reached in their reports. Many theories developed in these studies have not been sufficiently supported by collaborative studies. The true clinical potential of L. S. D. - 25 remains masked by a lack of well designed and well controlled research...|$|E
40|$|We have {{attempted}} {{in the preceding}} experiments {{the beginning of an}} analysis of bacterial anaphylaxis and its relation to the occurrences in the animal body during an infectious disease. We have shown that the sensitization of the tissues of guinea pigs, as indicated by the isolated uterus, required 3 to 5 days even when passive sensitization was employed, and that in these relations conditions with bacterial sensitization were entirely analogous to those revealed for serum anaphylaxis by Dale and Weil especially. It has become apparent that the sensitized uterus reacted not at all with whole bacteria or whole red cells, or, in other words, that before reaction with sensitized organs could occur an extraction or solution of the bacterial cell must take place. That bacteria yield some of their substance to the circulating blood during the course of infection was to be expected, but it has been definitely indicated, we think, by our complement fixations. The mechanism of injury in the sensitized animal or in the human being so far along in typhoid fever that antibodies have begun to develop is in part one in which antigen, derived from the bacilli and brought into solution, or rather suspension, in the blood stream, reacts with antibodies which are from the beginning, or have subsequently become, integral parts of the cell protoplasm, the entire process taking place within the cell. This last point is indicated by the failure to sensitize by simply soaking the normal uterus in antiserum. This, however, cannot be the entire story of injury. We know that typhoid antigen injected into normal animals in moderate amounts will render them gradually sick and eventually kill them. Also, a sufficient amount injected into a normal animal will occasionally produce acute symptoms, in every respect similar to the reaction produced in sensitized animals by smaller doses. We have shown that such acute symptoms in normal animals were not due in any degree to tissue sensitiveness, since even very large quantities of antigen will produce no response {{on the part of the}} normal uterus. It is reasonable to suppose, therefore, that the injury, gradual or acute, in the normal animal, is in no respect referable to tissue sensitiveness to the whole antigen, but rather must be referred to some series of phenomena which occur in the circulation. The acute shock of normal animals may possibly, therefore, be entirely due to an intravascular reaction. Whether this is one of antigen-splitting, or of <b>antienzyme</b> removal in the sense of Jobling is a point on which these experiments throw no light. It is true that we have never succeeded in producing acute toxic symptoms either in the whole animal or in the isolated uterus with serum from animals acutely ill. This we eliminate as negative evidence inasmuch as we believe that the toxic substances need at no given time be present in the blood stream in sufficient concentration to render such an experiment successful. They are probably absorbed and do their injury almost as rapidly as formed, an assumption which is based on the speed with which symptoms develop. It is possible, and not to be denied on the basis of any experiment that we can devise at present, that the gradual illness of the normal animal and the occasional acute shock of these animals may be based on entirely different mechanisms. In both cases, however, in normal animals, they seem to be intravascular. And since the symptoms of acute shock which can be produced in sensitized animals with moderate doses can also, though only occasionally, be produced in normal animals with larger doses, it is reasonable to suppose that the poisons produced intracellularly in the one may be similar to those produced intravascularly in the other. It does not seem likely that the specific circulating antibodies are in any way sources of increased injury to an animal spontaneously infected with bacteria. If sufficiently powerful at the beginning they may even prevent tissue injury, first by increasing phagocytosis, then by producing intravascular agglutination, and finally, as indicated by our experiments, even by removing a part of the antigen from possible reaction with the cell, though in this last respect our experiments indicate that they functionate imperfectly. It is more probable that their chief protective action to the sensitized body lies in removing the whole bacteria from the possibility of intravascular disintegration, which, as we have shown, is prerequisite to anaphylactic injury of the tissues of the host. We would tentatively summarize our opinion as to the occurrences in the typhoid-infected body as follows: Early injury is probably due to disintegration of part of the bacteria in the course of which albumose-like bodies are liberated, and, following which, intravascular reactions result in the formation of toxic substances, perhaps by some form of proteolysis. Since the accumulation of bacteria during these stages is relatively slight, this form of injury probably plays little part in producing symptoms. Indeed, the experiment by which acute injury is produced in the normal guinea pig by the sudden injection of several times the lethal dose of partly dissolved bacteria, finds no analogy in the spontaneously diseased body. At this time the tissues are not sensitive, but as antigen absorption progresses and the tissues are stimulated to react, sensitiveness develops, which renders them much more delicately amenable to injury by direct reaction with even small amounts of dissolved but otherwise unaltered antigen. This process is directly counteracted by circulating antibodies which tend to remove the bacteria from the possibility of yielding their antigen to solution by agglutinating them, aiding phagocytosis, and to a slight extent even neutralizing dissolved antigen. It seems likely, therefore, that the symptoms which appear as the incubation time ends are largely those due to cellular sensitization which probably begins before any considerable amount of circulatory antibodies is present. The circulating antibodies would seem to have little or nothing to do with intravascular injury, the ferments responsible for this, however much it may occur, probably consisting of the non-specific proteases studied in this connection by Jobling. Finally it appears that highly sensitized animals are more easily killed by typhoid antigen than are normal animals, provided they do not dispose over unusually large amounts of circulating antibodies. Cure would consist of a gradual checking of growth and final destruction of the bacteria, and the consequent cessation of antigen liberation, but delicate hypersusceptibility would probably persist for some time after cure and immunity have been established. Just what the relation between tissue hypersusceptibility and immunity is remains a problem for further study...|$|E
