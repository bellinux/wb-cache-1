5|$|A {{group of}} most of the top riders in the GC, paced by the race leader himself, caught every one of the twelve initial leaders, and {{subsequently}} Garzelli just before the day's last climb, Prà Martino. Di Luca's aggressive descent of Prà Martino gave him a gap over the elite group of riders who had been able to hold his wheel to that point, and the stage win.

On January 14, Miller posted 21 points as Baylor (4 AP/4 Coaches) defeated Oklahoma State, raising their record to 170.

Prior to the season, the Big East had {{signed an agreement with}} the new San Francisco Bowl, giving that bowl the fifth pick of bowl-eligible teams in the Big East. But with the Gator Bowl (second pick of Big East teams) selecting Notre Dame instead of a Big East team, all the Big East's selections were pushed back one slot. Second-place West Virginia University was pushed to the Continental Tire Bowl (third pick) and third-place Pittsburgh was selected by the Insight Bowl (fourth pick), leaving Virginia Tech to be selected by the San Francisco Bowl with the fifth pick.|$|E
5|$|Set in {{the grounds}} of Cobdown Park, the Cobdown Sports and Social Club evolved from the former social club for Reeds International, the paper-maker. A new clubhouse was built in 1985 for Reed International Sports and Social Club and in 1989 the club became the Cobdown Sports & Social Club when it {{was taken over by}} the club members. Although it {{remained}} a members club, with many of the same activities, the club was opened up to the general public and new activities were added. Sports form an important part of these activities, and the club is an important local centre {{with a wide range of}} facilities to cater for groups and organisations, such as schools and businesses. Membership is also open to sports teams that wish to use the club. Facilities include a bar, with snooker and pool tables, a darts board, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> screen for major sporting events. There is a dedicated function room that is used for social and business events and can accommodate a maximum of 100 people seated.|$|E
5|$|The {{black-throated blue warbler}} {{enjoys a}} large range <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> {{population}}. Its population trend is currently increasing. This species was ranked as Least Concern by the IUCN in 2012. Deforestation and habitat fragmentation are threatening the black-throated blue warbler in its tropical wintering areas. A report in 2000 discussed the impact {{of global climate change}} on the population dynamics of the black-throated blue warbler by an observation from 1986 to 1998. In particular, the effect of El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) was studied in relation to the survival, fecundity and recruitment of this migratory bird. It was found that El Niño years (the warm South Pacific oceanic phase) were associated with lower adult survival rate in their wintering ground, Jamaica, lower fecundity in the breeding habitats in New Hampshire of the United States, and lower annual recruitment of yearlings and juveniles to both breeding and wintering grounds. All the three factors were relatively higher during La Niña years (cold South Pacific Ocean) when the weather was wetter and the food availability was much more abundant. Long-term global warming can aggravate the ENSO effect, adding to the fluctuation of the black-throated blue warbler population.|$|E

Yokozuna next performed a leg drop and placed The Undertaker in the casket. Before Yokozuna could close the lid, however, The Undertaker attacked him and the two wrestlers fought while standing in the casket. The Undertaker performed a clothesline from the top rope and placed Yokozuna in the casket. King Kong Bundy and Bam Bam Bigelow came down the aisle toward the ring, but Chuck Norris blocked their path. While Norris was distracted, however, Irwin R. Schyster entered the ring {{from the other side}} and attacked The Undertaker. He placed The Undertaker in the casket, but The Undertaker recovered before Yokozuna could close the lid. Jeff Jarrett tried to interfere on Yokozuna's behalf, but Norris stopped him with a superkick. The Undertaker performed a DDT <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> boot on Yokozuna. He then rolled his opponent in to the casket and closed the lid to gain the victory.|$|E
