40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. All-optical {{networks}} {{are the most}} promising architecture for building large-size, hugebandwidth transport networks that are required for carrying the exponentially increasing Internet traffic. Among the existing switching paradigms in the literature, the optical burst switching is intended to leverage the attractive properties of optical communications, {{and at the same}} time, take into account its limitations. One of the major problems in optical burst switching is high blocking probability that results from one-way reservation protocol used. In this thesis, this problem is solved in wavelength domain by using smart wavelength <b>assignment</b> <b>algorithms.</b> Two heuristic wavelength <b>assignment</b> <b>algorithms</b> prioritizing available wavelengths according to reservation tables at the network nodes are proposed. The major contribution of the thesis is the formulation of the wavelength assignment problem as a continuous-time, average cost dynamic programming problem and its solution based on neuro-dynamic programming.

5000|$|VADAR {{identifies}} and assigns protein {{secondary structure}} using 3 different algorithms. These three methods are then combined {{to create a}} consensus secondary structure assignment. Only 3 types of secondary structure are identified: Helices are indicated with an [...] "H", beta-strands are indicated with a [...] "B" [...] and coil or unstructured regions are identified with a [...] "C". Secondary structure assignments for each residue are listed under the column labeled SCND STRUC. The first secondary structure identification method (which appears in column 1) uses a geometric masking approach that was first described by Richards and Kundrot [...] with slight modifications. The second method (which appears in column 2) uses backbone dihedral angles to identify secondary structure elements in a manner initially described by Levitt and Greer [...] as well as Chou and Fasman. [...] The third secondary structure identification method uses hydrogen bonding patterns (in association with measured dihedral angles) to identify helices, beta strands and coil regions. This third method is somewhat similar to the method originally described by Kabsch and Sander. [...] The net result or consensus secondary structure is a weighted combination {{of each of the}} three methods. VADAR’s method of secondary structure identification generally identifies a higher fraction of secondary structure elements than the DSSP algorithm (64% helices and beta strands for VADAR versus 51% helices and beta strands for DSSP). In particular, VADAR’s secondary structure assignments appear to agree more closely with secondary structures identified by visual inspection (i.e. author assignments), by STRIDE (another secondary structure <b>assignment</b> <b>algorithm)</b> or via independent methods (i.e. NMR-based NOE methods).|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Most routing and {{wavelength}} <b>assignment</b> <b>algorithms</b> for all-optical networks do {{not consider}} the potential problem of reservation confliction, which occurs when two or more reservation requests compete for the same wavelength. Confliction can happen even if the network is only lightly loaded. In this paper, we propose a new reservation protocol Markov-based Backward Reservation (MBR) based on Markov modeling of the network traffic on optical links for resolving wavelength reservation confliction. Our simulations show that this new protocol can improve network performance as measured by decreased blocking probability. The MBR algorithm works best in small-hop-count networks with a comparatively small number of wavelengths per fiber compared to other frequently considered algorithms.

40|$|The {{cognitive}} radio is an emerging technology that enables dynamic spectrum access in wireless networks. The {{cognitive radio}} {{is capable of}} opportunistically using the available portions of a licensed spectrum to improve the application performance for unlicensed users. The opportunistic use of the available channels in the wireless environment requires dynamic channel assignment to efficiently utilize the available resources while minimizing the interference in the network. A challenging aspect of such algorithms is the incorporation of the channels' diverse characteristics, highly dynamic network conditions with respect to primary users' activity, and different fragmented sizes of the available channels.

40|$|Abstract—Operating on a {{frequency}} band occupying several nonoverlapping channels, IEEE 802. 11 is now {{widely used in}} Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs). Many multichannel MAC protocols are proposed to improve the spatial reuse in the network {{under the assumption that}} the transmissions on nonoverlapping channels do not interfere with each other. Some joint routing and channel <b>assignment</b> <b>algorithms</b> are also designed to increase the network throughput {{based on the premise that}} we can switch between different channels freely. Although simulations show that great improvements on network throughput can be observed in both cases, two fundamental questions remain: 1) Can we really use multiple nonoverlapping channels freely in WMNs? 2) If we can, what will be the cost when we switch channels dynamically and frequently? In this paper, by conducting extensive experiments on our testbed, we attempt to answer these questions. We find that in spite of interference between both overlapping and nonoverlapping channels, we can still use multiple channels in mesh networks under certain conditions but with care. We also show that the channel switching cost is actually very significant in WMNs. We recommend not to switch the channels too frequently when designing the channel <b>assignment</b> <b>algorithms,</b> and those channel <b>assignment</b> <b>algorithms</b> selecting one channel for each packet are not really beneficial.

40|$|Abstract — In all-optical packet switching, packets may {{arrive at}} an optical switch in an uncoordinated fashion. To prevent packet loss in the switch, fiber delay lines (FDLs) are used as optical buffer to store optical packets. However, {{assigning}} FDLs to the arrival packets to achieve high throughput, low delay, and low loss rate is not a trivial task. In our companion paper, we have proposed several efficient scheduling algorithms for singlestage shared-FDL optical packet switches. To further enhance the switch’s scalability, we have extended our work to a multistage case. Here, we propose two scheduling algorithms: (1) sequential FDL assignment and (2) multi-cell FDL <b>assignment</b> <b>algorithms</b> for a 3 -stage optical Clos-Network switch (OCNS).
