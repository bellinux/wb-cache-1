5|$|During the 201415 offseason, Gyorko {{worked to}} regain the muscle he lost during the {{previous}} offseason. With Matt Kemp and Justin Upton added to the Padres' lineup, Black hoped to reduce the pressure on Gyorko to perform. By late April, with Gyorko off to a 7-for-47 (.147) start to the season, he began to lose playing time to Yangervis Solarte, and to Cory Spangenberg in May and June <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> struggle.|$|E
5|$|Following his release, O'Keefe {{spent one}} month on trial at Aston Villa and {{impressed}} the club's coaching staff, including youth coach Gordon Cowans, but {{was forced to}} leave the club, who were only willing to offer him a one-year youth contract, after struggling to travel to the Midlands-based club on a regular basis <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> prepare for his GCSEs. He was also offered a trial with Nottingham Forest, scoring during a friendly match with the club but O'Keefe again moved on after the club stalled over offering him a contract, with Forest only willing to offer him a one-year youth deal.|$|E
5|$|As {{the rift}} between {{the players and}} Brown and between Modell and Brown grew, Modell fired Brown on January 7, 1963. A {{controversy}} developed over {{the timing of the}} decision amid a local newspaper strike, which limited discussion of the move. A printing company executive, however, got together a group of sportswriters and published a 32-page magazine fielding players' views on the firing. Opinions were mixed; Modell came in for his share of criticism, but tackle and team captain Mike McCormack said he did not think the team could win under Brown. Blanton Collier, Brown's longtime assistant, was named the team's new head coach, and Brown began to plan his next move <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> receive an $82,500 salary under his eight-year contract.|$|E

5|$|Cotto and Judah {{delivered}} an all-action brawl, {{but after}} weathering some difficult early rounds as he figured out Judah's southpaw style and adjusted to his speed, Cotto {{took over the}} bout. In round seven, both fighters went toe-to-toe and in round eight he hurt Judah several times. In round nine, Judah took a knee to gain a breather from Cotto's aggressive style. By the tenth round, Judah was bleeding from a cut over his right eye and was hurt by an uppercut from Cotto that sent him retreating to the ropes, but Judah stayed upright. Early in the eleventh round, Cotto landed a combination that dropped Judah to the canvas. He managed {{to get to his}} feet, but Cotto went after Judah with a relentless attack, turning him sideways along the ropes <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> throw punches. That forced the referee to stop the fight.|$|E
5|$|Ralf Schumacher {{took his}} first pit stop on lap 28, {{emerging}} in seventh position. Barrichello pitted one lap later. Race leader Häkkinen took his pit stop on lap 31 and came out behind teammate Coulthard. Häkkinen regained the lead after Coulthard made his pit stop on lap 32, who came out in third position. Fisichella retired with further brake problems on lap 32. Häkkinen set the fastest lap of the race, a 1:20.028 on lap 33, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> stretch his lead over Michael Schumacher. Coulthard, who was on fresh tyres, gradually began {{to close the gap}} to Michael Schumacher by lap 39. Michael Schumacher increased the gap when Coulthard lost two seconds; the result of being held up by Genè who was later issued a 10-second stop-go penalty. Barrichello pitted for the second time on lap 47. Michael Schumacher and Ralf Schumacher made their pit stops on lap 50, one lap ahead of Coulthard.|$|E
5|$|Tension grew {{between the}} Pelham {{ministry}} and George, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> take advice from Carteret and rejected pressure from his other ministers to include William Pitt the Elder in the Cabinet, {{which would have}} broadened the government's support base. The king disliked Pitt because he had previously opposed government policy and attacked measures seen as pro-Hanoverian. In February 1746, Pelham and his followers resigned. George asked Lord Bath and Carteret to form an administration, but after less than 48 hours they returned the seals of office, unable to secure sufficient parliamentary support. Pelham returned to office triumphant, and George was forced to appoint Pitt to the ministry.|$|E

5|$|Morison {{played the}} opening five {{games of the}} club's 2004–05 campaign, but failed to score. He {{featured}} two more times for the club, scoring Northampton's equaliser away at Darlington in September 2004. The following month, Morison joined Conference South side Bishop's Stortford for an undisclosed fee. He scored on his debut in a 1–1 draw against Redbridge, and scored in the following game in Stortford's 3–1 loss at Bognor Regis Town. He also helped Stortford reach the FA Trophy semi-final and Morison finished the season as the club's top goalscorer, as well as finishing as the 2004–05 FA Trophy top goalscorer. The following season, Morison struggled for form {{at the start of}} the club's league campaign, and was subsequently used as a substitute during the first two months of the season. He started in a game against Histon in November 2005, scoring a hat-trick in a 5–0 win. He followed this up with goals against St Albans City and Eastbourne Borough respectively, as well as scoring Stortford's fourth in a 5–2 victory over Dorchester Town. He ended the season by scoring twice against Eastleigh, meaning he scored a total of 15 goals <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> impress at Woodside Park.|$|E
5|$|Ryzhkov was {{an early}} {{supporter}} of the Gorbachev policy calling {{for an increase in}} {{the quantity and quality of}} goods planned for production during the period of the Twelfth Five-Year Plan (19861990). To achieve these goals, the government pumped money into the machine-building sector but as time went by, Gorbachev increasingly diverged from his original stance. He now wanted to increase overall investment in nearly all industrial sectors; a move which Ryzhkov knew was a budgetary impossibility. However, Ryzhkov's economic policies were not much better <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> advocate an unreasonable increase in the production of consumer goods. Gorbachev and Ligachev's anti-alcohol campaign was opposed by Ryzhkov, who agreed with the State Planning Committee and the Ministry of Trade that such a drive would deprive from the state billions of rubles in income. Nevertheless, the campaign went ahead, losing the Soviet Government millions in revenues. Ryzhkov's opposition to the campaign was strengthened by his belief that both Gorbachev and Ligachev placed ideology before practical considerations, and he instead advocated an alternative long-term program rather than one designed to have immediate effect.|$|E
5|$|Stoke {{qualified}} for Europe again in 1974–75, {{and managed to}} draw both legs with Dutch side Ajax, only to exit the competition on the away goals rule. However Conroy again struggled with injuries, and was limited to just 16 league appearances. He played most of these games as a centre-forward, as regular striker John Ritchie missed much {{of the season with}} a broken leg and Geoff Hurst was nearing {{the end of his career}} and was unable to play every game. Conroy scored his two career hat-tricks during the campaign, against Halifax Town in the League Cup on 11 September, and then against Carlisle United in a 5–2 league win on 22 March. At the end of the season Stoke had three games to play against mid-table sides and needed to win all three in order to win the league, however they lost at Sheffield United and had goalless draws with Newcastle United and Burnley, leaving the club with another fifth-place finish. Conroy was again limited to just 16 league appearances <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> suffer injury problems in the 1975–76 season, and underwent an operation to remove all the remaining cartilage from his knees. The club also suffered a disaster, as a strong gale blew a section of the roof off the Victoria Ground's Butler Street Stand on 2 January, and as the correct insurance was not in place the club were forced to sell key players such as Jimmy Greenhoff, Mike Pejic, Alan Hudson, John Mahoney and Geoff Salmons in order to finance stadium repairs.|$|E

He made 126 {{in the second game}} after not having to bat in the first test. In a rain affected match, Prior only made 4, but he did take five catches as England won the series 1–0. This meant that England had the chance to become the number one ranked test team when they played India. Prior hit 71 and 103 in the first test <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> stake a claim for being the best wicket keeper batsman in the world. He made another score of 73 in the second test, as England took a 2–0 lead in the series. England {{went on to win the}} series 4–0, and became the number one team in the world.|$|E
