5|$|There is no creator God, {{according}} to Mahavira's teachings, and existence has neither beginning nor end.

The goal of spiritual practice is to liberate the jiva from all karmic accumulation, and thus enter {{the realm of the}} siddhas who are never reborn again.

Not all sorority members live with their chapters, though, as membership exceeds house space. Eight National Pan-Hellenic Council (historically African American) fraternities and sororities also hold chapters at Duke. In addition, there are seven other fraternities and sororities that <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Inter-Greek Council, the multicultural Greek umbrella organization.

SLGs are residential groups similar to fraternities or sororities, except they are generally co-ed and unaffiliated with any national organizations. Fraternity chapters and SLGs frequently host social events in their residential sections, which are often open to non-members.|$|E
