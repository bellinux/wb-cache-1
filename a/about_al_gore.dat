In 2001, she made a page in Finnish <b>about</b> <b>Al</b> <b>Gore,</b> hoping to show him how much she admired his values, {{not to mention his}} looks. For the next ten years she studied philosophy, business, French and engineering but maintained an interest in programming. When she was 23, she once again became interested in the web. She co-founded Rails Girls, a site designed to help women learn basic programming. Thanks to her involvement, the approach has become a worldwide success, leading to workshops in over 160 cities. Liukas also works with the online training platform Codecademy which provides courses free of charge.|$|E
5000|$|In an August 2012 {{interview}} with Bloomberg Businessweek, Siegel elaborated on his claims, {{and it turned}} out his fears were groundless: [...] "Whenever I saw a negative article <b>about</b> <b>Al</b> <b>Gore,</b> I put it in with the paychecks of my 8,000 employees. I had my managers do a survey on every employee. If they liked Bush, we made them register to vote. But not if they liked Gore. The week before election we made 80,000 phone calls through my call center—they were robo-calls. On Election Day, we made sure everyone who was voting for Bush got to the polls. I didn’t know he would win by 527 votes. Afterward, we did a survey among the employees to find out who voted who wouldn’t have otherwise. One thousand of them said so." ...|$|E

Gore stated in the interview, [...] "During my service in the United States Congress I took the initiative in creating the internet. I took the initiative in moving forward a whole range of initiatives that have proven to be important to our country's economic growth and environmental protection, improvements in our educational system."

50|$|That's My Bush! was a {{short-lived}} live-action political satire/sitcom from South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone. It aired on Comedy Central in first run from April through June 2001. Despite being about the fictional exploits of the president, it instead mostly satirized 1970s, 1980s, and workplace sitcoms; indeed, {{it was originally}} pitched as being <b>about</b> <b>Al</b> <b>Gore,</b> implying that jokes about George Bush were never really meant to be the show's main feature. The show often portrayed Bush dealing with both a sitcom-type situation and a political one at the same time, such as having a romantic dinner with Laura the same night as a major dinner with {{both sides of the}} abortion debate. George W. Bush was generally portrayed as being somewhat dim (as were most of the characters) yet essentially sincere in his efforts. The show was eventually canceled due to high production costs and insufficient ratings.After the attacks of September 11, Comedy Central stopped showing reruns of the show. The complete series was released on DVD in 2006.|$|E
