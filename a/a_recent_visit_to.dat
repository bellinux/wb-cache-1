25|$|Edward F. Carlson, {{chairman}} of the 1962 World's Fair in Seattle, originally had an idea for erecting a tower with a restaurant at the World's Fair. Carlson was then president of a hotel company and not previously known for art or design, but he was inspired by <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> the Stuttgart Tower of Germany. John Graham, an architect who had won praise for designing the Northgate Mall in Seattle, soon became involved. Graham's first move was to alter the restaurant featured in the plans to a revolving restaurant, {{in the same manner}} as on a tower (La Ronde) he had previously designed for the Ala Moana Shopping Center.|$|E

[...] This allowed John Tiltman and his colleagues to crack the code and decrypt, for a few years, messages between Moscow {{and some of its}} foreign parties, such as the CPGB. [...] They revealed the Comintern's close supervision of the Communist Party and Pollitt. Among other things, Pollitt was instructed to refute news leaks about a Stalinist purge. [...] Some messages were addressed to code names, while others were signed by Pollitt himself. In his transmissions to Moscow, Pollitt regularly pleaded for more funding from the Soviet Union. One 1936 coded instruction advised Pollitt to publicise the plight of Ernst Thälmann, a German communist leader who had been arrested by the Nazis and who later died at Sachsenhausen concentration camp. Pollitt replied that he was 'having difficulties' getting English statesmen to make public declarations supporting Thälmann but that they promised they would speak privately with German officials in London. In one of the more amusing dispatches, Pollitt (1936) informed his Soviet contact about <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> France to make campaign appearances for candidates from the French Communist Party.

We say unwilling, because Billy, during his long period of convalescence, had been so won by the kindness of Nora, that the last thing in the world he would have consented to bear was separation from her; but, on thinking over it, he was met by this insurmountable difficulty--that the last thing in the world he would consent to do was to disobey her!

Some believe that more can be achieved through tightly managed research — as if we can predict the future. I believe this is an unfortunate misconception that affects and infects research funding. I hear repeatedly, particularly in developing countries: "Applied research is what we need.

6000|$|In {{a note to}} the [...] "Advertisement" [...] to the Siege of Corinth (vide post, p. 447), Byron puts it {{on record}} that during the years 1809-10 he had crossed the Isthmus of Corinth eight times, and {{in a letter to}} his mother, dated Patras, July 30, 1810, he alludes to <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> the town of Corinth, in company with his friend Lord Sligo. (See, too, his letter to Coleridge, dated October 27, 1815, Letters, 1899, iii. 228.) It is {{probable}} that he revisited Corinth more than once in the autumn of 1810; and we may infer that, just as the place and its surroundings--the temple with its [...] "two or three columns" [...] (line 497), and the view across the bay from Acro-Corinth--are sketched from memory, so the story of the siege which took place in 1715 is based upon tales and legends which were preserved and repeated by the grandchildren of the besieged, and were taken down from their lips. There is point and meaning in the apparently insignificant line (stanza xxiv. line 765), [...] "We have heard the hearers say" [...] (see variant i. p. 483), which is slipped into the description of the final catastrophe. It bears witness to the fact that the Siege of Corinth is not a poetical expansion of a chapter in history, but a heightened reminiscence of local tradition.|$|E
60|$|It must be confessed, also, {{that another}} matter, a simple affair of gallantry, {{was giving him}} an equally unusual, unexpected, and absurd annoyance, which he had never before {{permitted}} to such trivialities. In <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> a fashionable watering-place, he had {{attracted the attention of}} {{what appeared to be a}} respectable, matter of fact woman, the wife of a recently elected rural Senator. She was, however, singularly beautiful, and as singularly cold. It was perhaps this quality, and her evident annoyance at some unreasoning prepossession which Jack's fascinations exercised upon her, that heightened that reckless desire for risk and excitement which really made up the greater part of his gallantry. Nevertheless, as was his habit, he had treated her always with a charming unconsciousness of his own attentions, and a frankness that seemed inconsistent with any insidious approach. In fact, Mr. Hamlin seldom made love to anybody, but permitted it to be made to him with good-humored deprecation and cheerful skepticism. He had once, quite accidentally, while riding, come upon her when she had strayed from her own riding party, and had behaved with such unexpected circumspection and propriety, not to mention a certain thoughtful abstraction,--it was the day he had received Sophy's letter,--that she was constrained to make the first advances. This led to a later innocent rendezvous, in which Mrs. Camperly was impelled to confide to Mr. Hamlin the fact that her husband had really never understood her. Jack listened with an understanding and sympathy quickened by long experience of such confessions. If anything had ever kept him from marriage it was this evident incompatibility of the conjugal relations with a just conception of the feminine soul and its aspirations.|$|E
60|$|Sometimes one {{can pick}} them out; thus, on {{the borders of}} a marsh where redshanks bred, I have heard the call of that bird {{distinctly}} given by the thrush. And again, where the ring-ouzel is common, the thrush will get its brief song exactly. When thrushes taken from the nest are reared in towns, where they never hear the thrush or any other bird sing, they are often exceedingly vocal, and utter a medley of sounds which are sometimes distressing to the ear. I have heard many caged thrushes of this kind in London, but the most remarkable instance I have met with was at the little seaside town of Seaford. Here, in the main shopping street, a caged thrush lived for years in a butcher's shop, and poured out its song continuously, the most distressing throstle performance I ever heard, composed of a medley of loud, shrill and harsh sounds--imitations of screams and shouts, boy whistlers, saw filing, knives sharpened on steels, and numerous other unclassifiable noises; but all, more or less, painful. The whole street {{was filled with the}} noise, and the owner used to boast that his caged thrush was the most persistent as well as the loudest singer that had ever been heard. He had no nerves, and was proud of it! On <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> Seaford I failed to hear the bird when walking about the town, and after two or three days went into the shop to enquire about it. They told me it was dead--that it had been dead over a year; also that many visitors to Seaford had missed its song and had called at the shop to ask about the bird. The strangest thing about its end, they said, was its suddenness. The bird was singing its loudest one morning, and had been at it for some time, filling the whole place with its noise, when suddenly, in the middle of its song, it dropped down dead from its perch.|$|E

The classroom teachers in the school are all hearing, and the language of instruction is Burmese, either in written form or in spoken form with some signed support. Sign language is not formally part of the curriculum. The fingerspelling alphabet poster displayed {{on the wall in}} each classroom is one adapted from ASL fingerspelling. In this system, the ASL sign used for a Burmese letter is the one which matches the sound, e. g. ASL ‘L’ for Burmese lá, ASL ‘W’ for Burmese wá, with some additions and adaptations. For example ASL ‘N’ is used for Burmese ná-ngeh; the orientation of the hand is changed to make the sign for ná-jì. It is not clear how systematically this ASL-derived system is taught in the school, or how widely it is known amongst the pupils. An indigenous system which preceded this one was in use in the school in the 1970 s and 1980 s and is still known and used by Deaf signers in Yangon who were in the school at that time. It is based on the graphic forms of the Burmese script. This presentation demonstrates the older system, including examples of whole-word spellings, from film made in Yangon in June 2010...|$|R
