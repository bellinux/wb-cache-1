40|$|Abstract: Discriminating quark jets from gluon jets is an {{important}} but challenging prob-lem in jet substructure. In this paper, we use the concept of mutual information to illuminate the physics of quark/gluon tagging. Ideal quark/gluon separation requires only one bit of truth information, so even if two discriminant variables are largely uncorrelated, they can still share the same “truth overlap”. Mutual information {{can be used to}} diagnose such sit-uations, and thus determine which discriminant variables are redundant and which can be combined to improve performance. Using both parton showers and analytic resummation, we study a two-parameter family of generalized <b>angularities,</b> which includes familiar infrared and collinear (IRC) safe observables like thrust and broadening, as well as IRC unsafe variants like pDT and hadron multiplicity. At leading-logarithmic (LL) order, the bulk of these variables exhibit Casimir scaling, such that their truth overlap is a universal function of the color factor ratio CA/CF. Only at next-to-leading-logarithmic (NLL) order can one see a difference in quark/gluon performance. For the IRC safe <b>angularities,</b> we show that the quark/gluon per-formance can be improved by combining <b>angularities</b> with complementary angular exponents.

500|$|This comment {{illustrates}} {{well the}} general nature of Szigeti's reception by both critics and fellow musicians: while his musical insights, intellect, {{and depth of}} interpretation were almost universally lauded, the purely technical aspect of his playing was awarded a more mixed reaction. His tone in particular {{seems to have been}} occasionally uneven from performance to performance. A 1926 recital review in The New York Times, for example, laments that ... his performance was stiff and dry in its observance of letter and its absence of spirit ... Mr. Szigeti was not only inclined to dryness of tone and <b>angularity</b> of phrase, but there were also passages of poor intonation. In contrast, a review from the previous year in the same journal remarked after a performance of the Beethoven concerto that Mr. Szigeti has a rather small but beautiful tone, elegance, finish. He played with a quiet sincerity which grew upon the audience, though not with the virility and sweep that other violinists find ... it is clear that Mr. Szigeti is a player to command esteem and respect for his musicianship, for the genuineness of his interpretations, and his artistic style.|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} {{efficient}} way to calculate the effect of soft QCD radiation at one loop, which is needed for predictions at next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. We use rapidity coordinates and isolate the divergences in the integrand. By performing manipulations with cumulative variables, we avoid complications from plus distributions. We address rapidity divergences, divergences with an azimuthal dependence, complicated jet boundaries and multi-differential measurements. The process and measurements can be easily adjusted, as we demonstrate by reproducing many existing soft functions. The results for a general LHC process with multiple Wilson lines are obtained by treating Wilson lines that are not back-to-back using a boost. We also obtain, for the first time, the N-jettiness soft function for generic jet <b>angularities,</b> and the collinear-soft function for the measurement of two <b>angularities...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Broadening is {{a classic}} jet {{observable}} that probes the transverse momentum structure of jets. Traditionally, broadening has been measured {{with respect to the}} thrust axis, which is aligned along the (hemisphere) jet momentum to minimize the vector sum of transverse momentum within a jet. In this paper, we advocate measuring broadening with respect to the “broadening axis”, which is the direction that minimizes the scalar sum of transverse momentum within a jet. This approach eliminates many of the cal-culational complexities arising from recoil of the leading parton, and observables like the jet <b>angularities</b> become recoil-free when measured using the broadening axis. We derive a simple factorization theorem for broadening-axis observables which smoothly interpolates between the thrust-like and broadening-like regimes. We argue that the same factorization theorem holds for two-point energy correlation functions as well as for jet shapes based on a “winner-take-all axis”. Using kinked broadening axes, we calculate event-wide <b>angularities</b> in e+e − collisions with next-to-leading logarithmic resummation. Defining jet regions using the broadening axis, we also calculate the global logarithms for <b>angularities</b> within a single jet. We find good agreement comparing our calculations both to showering Monte Carlo programs and to automated resummation tools. We give a brief historical perspective on the broadening axis and suggest ways that broadening-axis observables could be used in future jet substructure studies at the Large Hadron Collider. ar X i...|$|R
