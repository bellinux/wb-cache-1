5|$|Several {{natural causes}} (diseases) have been suggested, {{including}} malaria and typhoid fever. A 1998 {{article in the}} New England Journal of Medicine attributed his death to typhoid fever complicated by bowel perforation and ascending paralysis. <b>Another</b> <b>recent</b> analysis suggested pyogenic (infectious) spondylitis or meningitis. Other illnesses fit the symptoms, including acute pancreatitis and West Nile virus. Natural-cause theories also tend to emphasize that Alexander's health {{may have been in}} general decline after years of heavy drinking and severe wounds. The anguish that Alexander felt after Hephaestion's death may also have contributed to his declining health.|$|E
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>recent</b> custom {{has been}} to fly a burgee and/or a {{cruising}} or power squadron flag from the starboard spreader. This custom has arisen because many sailboats today place a racing flag or wind indicator at the masthead.|$|E
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>recent</b> {{controversy}} {{surrounds the}} Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS), which the United States Air Force upgraded {{in recent years}} to a phased array radar. Opponents argue that the system presents a threat to the local population, as it would be targeted in the event of nuclear war.|$|E

25|$|Many design {{problems}} {{can also be}} expressed as optimization programs. This application is called design optimization. One subset is the engineering optimization, and <b>another</b> <b>recent</b> and growing subset of this field is multidisciplinary design optimization, which, while useful in many problems, has in particular been applied to aerospace engineering problems.|$|E
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>recent</b> project {{managed by}} the Air Vehicles Directorate is the Advanced Composite Cargo Aircraft program begun in 2007. This is an experimental, {{composite}} aircraft program with a goal of demonstrating the feasibility {{of the development of}} a cargo airframe constructed primary of light-weight composite materials. AFRL intends to gain X-plane designation for the program once flight tests begin.|$|E
25|$|More recently, many {{different}} DNA {{studies have shown}} that many African Americans have European admixture, reflecting the long history in this country of the various populations. Proportions of European admixture in African-American DNA have been found in studies to be 17 % and between 10.6% and 22.5%. <b>Another</b> <b>recent</b> study found the average to be 21.2%, with a standard error of 1.2%.|$|E
50|$|<b>Another</b> more <b>recent</b> {{predictive}} {{learning theory}} is Jeff Hawkins' memory-prediction framework, which {{is laid out}} in his On Intelligence.|$|R

25|$|Until recently, The Neiman Marcus Group owned {{majority}} interest in Kate Spade LLC, {{a manufacturer of}} handbags and accessories. In October 2006, the company purchased all minority interest for approximately $59.4 million, and in November 2006 sold 100% ownership to Liz Claiborne, Inc. for approximately $121.5 million. <b>Another</b> <b>recent</b> divestiture was a {{majority interest}} in Gurwitch Products LLC, which manufactures Laura Mercier cosmetics, to Alticor Inc., for approximately $40.8 million.|$|E
25|$|A recent version {{including}} the authentic music by Offenbach has been reinstated by the French Offenbach scholar Jean-Christophe Keck. A successful performance of this version was produced at the Lausanne Opera (Switzerland). <b>Another</b> <b>recent</b> edition by Michael Kaye has been {{performed at the}} Opéra National de Lyon and the Hamburg State Opera with Elena Moșuc singing the roles of Olympia, Antonia, Giulietta, and Stella in the 2007 production.|$|E
25|$|After her {{victory in}} the 2012 General Election, Park's {{approval}} rating increased significantly. In a national-level survey by Mono Research on 30 August Park was the top presidential candidate with an approval rating of 45.5% when competing with all potential candidates, and according to <b>another</b> <b>recent</b> national survey result, had a higher approval rating (50.6%) than Ahn (43.9%) in a two-way competition with him as of 11 September.|$|E
50|$|<b>Another</b> {{relatively}} <b>recent</b> book by Soares de Azevedo is Occultism and Religion in Freud, Jung, and Mircea Eliade, co-authored {{with the}} Australian author and professor Harry Oldmeadow.|$|R
50|$|A large SAR {{study of}} {{mecamylamine}} and its analogs {{was reported by}} a group from Merck in 1962. <b>Another,</b> more <b>recent</b> SAR study was undertaken by Suchocki et al.|$|R
50|$|Post-postmodernism is {{a wide-ranging}} set of {{developments}} in critical theory, philosophy, architecture, art, literature, and culture which are emerging from and reacting to postmodernism. <b>Another</b> similar <b>recent</b> term is metamodernism.|$|R
25|$|Research {{regarding}} {{the human brain}} has also become a major focus at the university. The Brain and Mind Institute focuses on research in cognitive neuroscience at Western. and the Institute recently discovered that the blind may echolocate by using the visual cortex of the brain. <b>Another</b> <b>recent</b> study at Western has suggested people deaf from birth {{may be able to}} reassign the area of their brain used for hearing to boost their sight.|$|E
25|$|Results from <b>another</b> <b>recent</b> {{study suggest}} that fetuses were able to form both {{short and long term}} memories. This {{conclusion}} was drawn from the fact that habituation rates (number of stimuli needed to habituate) were higher in babies in the neonatal stage that had not previously undergone fetal stimulations when compared to those who had: therefore demonstrating the memory of the stimulus in its fetal stage being carried into the neonatal stage.|$|E
25|$|Today, with {{increased}} {{competition from the}} private sector, and the privatization of Tekel in 2004, several new brands and types of raki have emerged, {{each with its own}} distinct composition and production method, although the overall qualities of the drink have generally been kept consistent. These include Efe Rakı, Çilingir Rakı, Mercan Rakı, Fasıl Rakı, Burgaz Rakı, Ata Rakı, and Anadolu Rakı. Sarı Zeybek Rakısı, <b>another</b> <b>recent</b> brand, is aged in oak casks, which gives it a distinctive golden color.|$|E

50|$|Several of the egrets {{have been}} {{reclassified}} from one genus to <b>another</b> in <b>recent</b> years: the great egret, for example, has been {{classified as a}} member of either Casmerodius, Egretta or Ardea.|$|R
50|$|Today, cola {{has been}} {{composed}} in <b>another</b> form by <b>recent</b> composers.|$|R
25|$|The biggest {{technical}} {{change after}} 1950 {{has been the}} development of sieve methods, particularly in multiplicative problems. These are combinatorial in nature, and quite varied. The extremal branch of combinatorial theory has in return been greatly influenced by the value placed in analytic number theory on quantitative upper and lower bounds. <b>Another</b> <b>recent</b> development is probabilistic number theory, which uses methods from probability theory to estimate the distribution of number theoretic functions, such as how many prime divisors a number has.|$|E
25|$|People can {{be trained}} to have their {{suspicion}} aroused if the message does not contain any specific personal information. Phishing attempts in early 2006, however, used personalized information, which makes it unsafe {{to assume that the}} presence of personal information alone guarantees that a message is legitimate. Furthermore, <b>another</b> <b>recent</b> study concluded in part that the presence of personal information does not significantly affect the success rate of phishing attacks, which suggests that most people do not pay attention to such details.|$|E
25|$|This first {{successful}} evolution of catalytic DNA from a non-catalytic precursor could {{provide support for}} the RNA World hypothesis. In <b>another</b> <b>recent</b> study, an RNA ligase ribozyme was converted into a deoxyribozyme through in vitro evolution of the inactive deoxyribo-analog of the ribozyme. The new RNA ligase deoxyribozyme contained just twelve point mutations, two of which {{had no effect on}} activity, and had a catalytic efficiency of approximately 1/10 of the original ribozyme, though the researches hypothesized that the activity could be further increased through further selection.|$|E
5000|$|Rummel's early {{research}} found that democracies are less warlike, even against non-democracies. Many other researchers hold only that democracies {{are far less}} warlike with one <b>another.</b> Some <b>recent</b> studies have supported Rummel's position.|$|R
50|$|The {{salary scale}} is national, so pay does not vary from one {{university}} to <b>another.</b> A <b>recent</b> reform {{allows for the}} possibility of salary modulation in the universities, but for now this remains to be implemented.|$|R
3000|$|... [...]. In [18] it {{is shown}} that this {{inequality}} can be embedded {{into a larger}} class of inequalities by applying a class of certain differential equations. <b>Another</b> interesting <b>recent</b> paper on isoperimetric properties of polygons is [19].|$|R
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>recent</b> {{development}} in revolver {{technology is the}} Rhino, a revolver introduced by Italian manufacturer Chiappa in 2009 and first sold in the U.S. in 2010. The Rhino, built with the U.S. concealed carry market in mind, is designed so that the bullet fires from the bottom chamber of the cylinder instead of the top chamber as in standard revolvers. This is intended to reduce muzzle flip, allowing for faster and more accurate repeat shots. In addition, the cylinder cross-section is hexagonal instead of circular, further reducing the weapon's profile.|$|E
25|$|However {{recent studies}} of {{starling}} flocks have shown that each bird modifies its position, relative to the six or seven animals directly surrounding it, no matter how close or how far away those animals are. Interactions between flocking starlings are thus based on a topological rule rather than a metric rule. It {{remains to be seen}} whether this applies to other animals. <b>Another</b> <b>recent</b> study, based on an analysis of high speed camera footage of flocks above Rome and assuming minimal behavioural rules, has convincingly simulated a number of aspects of flock behaviour.|$|E
25|$|Providing {{barriers}} to entry. The drawing of boundaries around certain {{food and drink}} produce prevents other actors entering particular markets. On this point the PGS framework can potentially deny (or make extremely difficult) entry into the agro-food sector. For example, there are stringent geographical, productive, facilitative, planning, temporal and skilled constraints to entry into the Stilton cheese market in the UK. The successful application to protect the Cornish pasty is <b>another</b> <b>recent</b> example; with Ginsters of Cornwall central to the bid (itself owned by the ‘extra-local’, Leicestershire-based Samworth Brothers – also makers of fellow PGS protected Melton Mowbray Pork Pies).|$|E
50|$|<b>Another</b> major <b>recent</b> {{development}} is the Serowe Stadium and surrounding sports complex. This project, which cost the Botswana government P30 million, was opened in mid-2003. It currently provides the Central District with its only major sports facility.|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> more <b>recent</b> {{production}} filed {{there was}} Creed, the 7th Rocky film starring Sylvester Stallone and Michael B Jordan as Apollo Creed's son which filmed at Sun Center Studios throughout February {{and up to}} 3 March 2015.|$|R
50|$|<b>Another,</b> more <b>recent,</b> {{extension}} {{was made}} by researchers at NEC Corporation called Multi-Modal Definite Clause Grammars (MM-DCGs) in 1995. Their extensions were intended to allow the recognizing and parsing expressions that include non-textual parts such as pictures.|$|R
