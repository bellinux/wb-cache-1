25|$|Upon {{completion}} of feeding, the mosquito will withdraw her proboscis, {{and as the}} gut fills up, the stomach lining secretes a peritrophic membrane that surrounds the blood. This membrane keeps the blood separate from <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stomach. However, like certain other insects that survive on dilute, purely liquid diets, notably many of the Hemiptera, many adult mosquitoes must excrete unwanted aqueous fractions even as they feed. (See the photograph of a feeding Anopheles stephensi: Note that the excreted droplet patently is not whole blood, being far more dilute). As {{long as they are}} not disturbed, this permits mosquitoes to continue feeding until they have accumulated a full meal of nutrient solids. As a result, a mosquito replete with blood can continue to absorb sugar, even as the blood meal is slowly digested {{over a period of several}} days. Once blood is in the stomach, the midgut of the female synthesizes proteolytic enzymes that hydrolyze the blood proteins into free amino acids. These are used as building blocks for the synthesis of egg yolk proteins.|$|E
25|$|Membership has {{varied from}} the {{original}} nine banjo players to well over a hundred. It includes both banjo and gut bucket (washtub bass) players plus a Band Auxiliary. From its humble beginnings {{in the basement of}} the Cupertino Music Store, the PBB did not have an official public venue until 1966. Having outgrown the music store, a gentleman by the name of Ward Pinther offered to host the band at his Straw Hat Pizza Palace in Campbell, California. This hospitality lasted for the next 24 years until Pinther's retirement and the closing of the restaurant. Not to be deterred, the band moved to yet another Straw Hat Pizza restaurant in the nearby San Jose neighborhood of Willow Glen. So from 1966 until Tuesday, June 16, 2009, the band entertained crowds every Tuesday evening at a Straw Hat Pizza restaurant. During the band's heyday in the 1970s and 1980s, it was not unusual to have four rows of twenty to twenty five banjo players performing plus as many as eight gutbucket players and a tuba. The sound produced by a hundred or more banjos is unique and unlike <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world of acoustic performances.|$|E

Konnan introduced himself and explained how he was brought here by his manager/agent, John Roberts. Roberts had already bragged to de los Santos that Carlos had been a wrestler in Florida. Suddenly, a big roar (laughter) went up from another wrestler, Miguel Lopez, who wrestled as Rey Mysterio. Lopez/Mysterio explained to Carlos that Roberts was just a nutty fan, always in the front row, but that he did nothing involved with managing or agent-ing or <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> business.

On 26 September 1927 Churchill composed the first of his Chartwell Bulletins, which were lengthy letters to Clementine, written to her while she was abroad. In the bulletins, Churchill described in great detail the ongoing works on the house and the gardens, and aspects of his life there.

500|$|After {{months of}} acting and singing auditions, Hal Prince offered the still {{relatively}} unknown Paige {{the title role}} of Eva Perón {{in the first stage}} production of the Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber musical, Evita. Her performance won her critical acclaim and brought her into public prominence at the age of 30. Julie Covington, who played the role on the original concept album, had turned down the opportunity of playing the role on stage leading to a long search for a new star. Paige eventually competed against Bonnie Schoen, an American initially favoured by Prince for the role. She later said, [...] "Bonnie was already a big name on Broadway. In a way, she didn't have anything to prove. She was smoothly, silkily professional. But I saw this as my big chance and, like Eva when she clapped eyes on Peron, I grabbed with both hands.

[...] For her performance in Evita, she won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Performance in a Musical, which at that time was called the Society of West End Theatre Award.

She also released her first studio album in 1978, titled Sitting Pretty. Just prior to her success in Evita, Paige had strongly considered becoming a nursery nurse, but after she sang for Dustin Hoffman, he made her promise that she would continue in theatre work.

500|$|Giving a {{partially}} negative {{review of the}} film was Joshua Rothkopf of Time Out New York, who said the [...] "movie has a centerfold sheen to it—and some lesbianic soft-core flirtation to match—as its plot dives deeply into Twilight-esque heavy-melo meltdown in the last act" [...] and that [...] "Cody throws one too many losses at Needy; the screenwriter loses her satiric way about halfway through.

Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post said, [...] "There's a certain kooky, kinky fun to be had with Jennifer's Body" [...] but that [...] "dmittedly, this {{is the stuff of}} lurid adolescent distraction, not great cinema" [...] and [...] "is strictly a niche item but provides a goofy, campy bookend to Drag Me to Hell on the B-movie shelf. Watch it, forget it, move on". San Francisco Chronicle Peter Hartlaub stated, [...] "Enjoy the film for its witty dialogue and fun performances, but know that there isn't a single good scare. An episode of Murder, She Wrote has more thrills." [...] Hartlaub felt the film is not bad, is [...] "almost always pleasing" [...] and that Fox [...] "proves that she has some [...] range" [...] but [...] "the chances that it will be somebody else's pop culture reference 27 years from now are slim to none". Joe Neumaier of New York Daily News said, [...] "Fox merely needs to look either vacant or evil, which the Transformers boy-toy does spookily well" [...] but [...] "ords and story are still the lifeblood of a movie, and Jennifer's Body is filled like a Twinkie with half-fleshed-out ideas". Disagreeing with Fox's performance, Chicago Tribune's Michael Phillips called Fox [...] "a pretty bad actress" [...] who [...] "doesn't seem to get Cody's sense of humor. At all".

500|$|O'Toole {{relished the}} {{opportunity}} {{that came with}} Jonathan's passing, {{even though she was}} saddened to see a friend leave the show. Martha taking the senate seat was a chance to explore more adult stories with her character beginning midway through season five, which was important for the actress since Clark was becoming an adult on the show. It also allowed for O'Toole the chance to depict [...] "strong emotions" [...] over Jonathan's death. Al Gough feels that Jonathan's passing allowed for them to explore more of Martha's smart and strong side, as well as her relationship with Lionel. The idea was to show that there was some form of attraction between Martha and Lionel, but that Martha would never have any romantic relationship with the billionaire, especially after all that he had done to her family. O'Toole likens Martha's interest in Lionel with that of watching a dangerous animal: [...] "It's that attraction you have for a very beautiful, dangerous animal. You know you can't stop watching it, {{but at the same time}} you feel, 'Oh my God, he's going to kill me.'" [...] The actress believes that Martha's ultimate motivation was to get close enough to Lionel to know what he is planning to do to Clark. When it came time for Martha to leave the show, writer Todd Slavkin contends that they wanted to give the character [...] "more of a send-off" [...] than they achieved on film. Slavkin explains that they could not do anything equivalent to what they gave John Schneider, as there were already so many storylines going on by the season six finale that they could not fit <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> <b>in.</b> <b>The</b> writers also realized that they could not kill off the character, and so chose to send her to the US Senate, creating a parallel to Clark where Martha fights injustice on the political stage.|$|E

Ellingwood also reviewed following volumes and found the last plot revelations intriguing; she enjoyed that a strong connection is revealed between characters from Tsubasa and xxxHolic. Critics have described the artwork as [...] "keeping up the standards expected of Clamp" [...] with its high level of detail, though perhaps too much detail, especially during action sequences. The artstyle is [...] "stylish" [...] and [...] "dynamic", characterized by a large number of [...] "sweeping lines curlicues that look unlike <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> genre" [...] that help bring the action scenes to life for exciting experiences.
