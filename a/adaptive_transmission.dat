40|$|Abstract — In this {{contribution}} <b>adaptive</b> rate <b>transmissions</b> are {{investigated in}} the context of DS-CDMA systems using variable spreading factors (VSF). In contrast to conventional <b>adaptive</b> rate <b>transmission</b> schemes, where the transmission rate is usually adapted in response to the channel fading, in this contribution the transmission rate is adapted in response to the multiuser interference (MUI) level. We present the philosophy of the proposed <b>adaptive</b> rate <b>transmission</b> scheme and analyze the effective throughput as well as the resultant bit error rate (BER) performance, when communicating over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels. Our study shows that when the number of active users in a DS-CDMA system can be modelled {{with the aid of a}} Markov chain and when the conventional matched filter based receiver is employed, the VSF-assisted <b>adaptive</b> rate <b>transmission</b> scheme is capable of substantially increasing the system’s effective throughput. Specifically, our results show that the effective throughput may be increased by up to 40 %, when compared to that of DS-CDMA systems using constant spreading factors. This increased throughput is achieved without wasting power, without imposing extra interference upon other users and without increasing the BER. I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- We {{describe}} and evaluate an energy-efficient protocol for routing traffic in frequency-hop (FH) store-and-forward packet radio net-works that employ an <b>adaptive</b> <b>transmission</b> protocol. The adaptive trans-mission protocol allows the radios {{to adjust the}} power in the transmitted signal {{and the rate of}} a Reed-Solomon code to respond to variations in partial-band interference and propagation loss. Routing is accomplished using least-resistance routing (LRR) with a new metric that provides a quantitative assessment of the ability of a radio to receive and forward packets and includes a measure of the energy that is expected to be re-quired for successful transmission. The new energy metric and LRR are integrated with the <b>adaptive</b> <b>transmission</b> protocol, and the performance of the new protocol suite is evaluated for a distributed FH network. The performance results presented in this paper are obtained from a simula-tion of wireless FH radio networks in which the characteristics of the links vary with time. Our results demonstrate that in FH networks that employ an <b>adaptive</b> <b>transmission</b> protocol, the new method for routing can adapt quickly to changes in interference conditions. We find that LRR with the energy metric works with the <b>adaptive</b> <b>transmission</b> protocol to improve the information throughput and energy efficiency of the network. I...|$|E
