50|$|The Republic of Kosovo is a {{democracy}} {{working under the}} Rule of Law, respect for its Constitution and laws, and the recognition of international law. The production of laws has grown considerably, and basic laws essential to {{the operation of the}} justice system have been adopted. As provided in the Law on Legislative Initiatives, laws in Kosovo are initiated either by the President, the Government, members of the Assembly or initiatives of 10, 000 citizens. The vast majority of laws originate with the Executive Branch of the Government, where Ministries are responsible for proposing legislation as well as overseeing drafts and amendments of primary and secondary laws. Members of the Assembly can propose amendments to legislation by submitting a motion to the <b>Assembly</b> <b>Table</b> and the government for its opinion. Ministry drafts are sent to the Office of Legal Support Services (OLSS) within the Prime Ministers Office (PMO). The laws undergo a second tier of review at the Government level, from the OLSS, Ministry of Finance (MoF)and Agency for European Integration (AEI). After their review and approval the law is sent to the Coordinating Group of the Government and finally proceeds to the Assembly for review and adoption.|$|E

There are many more applications for manufacturing companies such as logistics, evaluation of workshop layout, prototyping and virtual training.

There is a characteristic marker on the <b>assembly</b> <b>table.</b> The software environment can define a plane and transpose data according to the position of this marker in the real world space. The proposed software solution processes the webcamera image data and adds virtual 3 D model instructions to the real image. The final image is presented on a monitor placed in front of the worker.

The JIG is used in constructing a new Formula SAE race-car frame each year and is used throughout the racing season to check the production frame for twists, bends and potential stresses. The industrial JIG table required two survey approaches, firstly determination of the overall flatness throughout its’ steel base surface. Secondly was the validation of verticality of the steel uprights used to support and hold the race-car frame in place during construction and checking alignment for key suspension components. In addition the investigation brings realisations that there are far more accurate, efficient and economical technologies to be harnessed in industrial metrology...|$|E
40|$|Freely moving {{systems in}} space {{conserve}} linear and angular momentum. As moving systems collide, the velocities get altered due to transfer of momentum. The development of strategies for assembly in a free-floating work environment requires {{a good understanding}} of primitives such as self motion of the robot, propulsion of the robot due to onboard thrusters, docking of the robot, retrieval of an object from a collection of objects, and release of an object in an object pool. The analytics of such assemblies involve not only kinematics and rigid body dynamics but also collision and impact dynamics of multibody systems. In an effort to understand such assemblies in zero gravity space environment, we are currently developing at Ohio University a free-floating assembly facility with a dual-arm planar robot equipped with thrusters, a free-floating material table, and a free-floating <b>assembly</b> <b>table.</b> The objective is to pick up workpieces from the material table and combine them into prespecified assemblies. This paper presents analytical models of assembly primitives and strategies for overall assembly. A computer simulation of an assembly is developed using the analytical models. The experiment facility will be used to verify the theoretical predictions...|$|E
5000|$|Starting in 1977, Geoff Boothroyd, {{supported}} by an NSF grant at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, developed the Design for Assembly method (DFA), {{which could be}} used to estimate the time for manual assembly of a product and the cost of assembling the product on an automatic assembly machine. [...] Recognizing that {{the most important factor in}} reducing assembly costs was the minimization of the number of separate parts in a product, he introduced three simple criteria {{which could be used}} to determine theoretically whether any of the parts in the product could be eliminated or combined with other parts. These criteria, together with <b>tables</b> relating <b>assembly</b> time to various design factors influencing part grasping, orientation and insertion, could be used to estimate total assembly time and to rate the quality of a product design from an assembly viewpoint. For automatic <b>assembly,</b> <b>tables</b> of factors could be used to estimate the cost of automatic feeding and orienting and automatic insertion of the parts on an assembly machine.|$|R

30|$|Step 5 : Repair {{the second}} {{parts of the}} {{offspring}} chromosomes. Unlike the crossover 1, it is required to repair the children chromosomes after the crossover 2 applied as they are usually infeasible because of hard precedence constraints involved and other issues. For example, after crossover 2 applied, there are two Parts number 3, 10, 14 or 21 in the part 2 of the offspring chromosome {{as shown in the}} first sub-table in Table  7. The repair principle used in this paper has been proposed by Marian et al. (2000, 2006; Marian 2003) as follows: Every gene after the cut point must be checked against the feasibility based on recorded information about all of the previous assembly operations, not just the adjacent one. If feasible, a gene is accepted; otherwise a new one is randomly generated based on the precedence constraints in the <b>Assembly</b> <b>Table</b> and the previous assembly operations, and then a new suitable manufacturing agent is randomly selected to produce the Part in this new gene (the third parts of the offspring chromosomes will be updated accordingly). After repair operation applied, the offspring chromosomes are feasible and look like as shown in Table  8. It is noted that differences between the infeasible and feasible offspring can be seen when comparing Table  7 with Table  8.|$|E
