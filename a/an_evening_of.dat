25|$|One notable would-be {{baseball}} player and {{student who was}} cut during tryouts was writer John Grisham. In 2008, Grisham returned to the campus to join Ferriss in <b>an</b> <b>evening</b> <b>of</b> baseball tales, raising more than $100,000 for the athletic program.|$|E
25|$|Star Spangled Springfield: {{annually}} on July 4, Springfield stages <b>an</b> <b>evening</b> <b>of</b> patriotism, pageantry and pyrotechnics. The evening begins in Court Square with a patriotic concert by the Springfield Symphony Orchestra and concludes with an elaborate fireworks display from the Memorial Bridge. Numerous hills and bluffs in Springfield afford {{views of the}} fireworks.|$|E
50|$|Some {{circuit designs}} {{naturally}} output antimetric networks. For instance, a low-pass Butterworth filter implemented as a ladder network with <b>an</b> <b>even</b> number <b>of</b> elements will be antimetric. Similarly, a bandpass Butterworth with <b>an</b> <b>even</b> number <b>of</b> resonators will be antimetric, as will a Butterworth mechanical filter with <b>an</b> <b>even</b> number <b>of</b> mechanical resonators.|$|R
50|$|In a sum of integers, the parity of the sum is not {{affected}} by the even terms in the sum; the overall sum is even when there is <b>an</b> <b>even</b> number <b>of</b> odd terms, and odd {{when there is an}} odd number of odd terms. Since one side of the degree sum formula is the even number 2|E|, the sum on the other side must have <b>an</b> <b>even</b> number <b>of</b> odd terms; that is, there must be <b>an</b> <b>even</b> number <b>of</b> odd-degree vertices.|$|R
50|$|The state S1 {{represents}} {{that there}} has been <b>an</b> <b>even</b> number <b>of</b> 0s in the input so far, while S2 signifies an odd number. A 1 in the input does not change the state of the automaton. When the input ends, the state will show whether the input contained <b>an</b> <b>even</b> number <b>of</b> 0s or not. If the input did contain <b>an</b> <b>even</b> number <b>of</b> 0s, M will finish in state S1, an accepting state, so the input string will be accepted.|$|R
25|$|While {{habitual}} drunkenness was rare, intoxication at banquets and festivals was not unusual. In fact, the symposium, {{a gathering}} of men for <b>an</b> <b>evening</b> <b>of</b> conversation, entertainment and drinking typically ended in intoxication. However, {{while there are no}} references in ancient Greek literature to mass drunkenness among the Greeks, there are references to it among foreign peoples. By 425 BC, warnings against intemperance, especially at symposia, appear to become more frequent.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the hardships}} he {{suffered}} during World War I {{and the ensuing}} Russian Civil War, Glazunov remained active as a conductor. He conducted concerts in factories, clubs and Red Army posts. He played a prominent part in the Russian observation in 1927 of the centenary of Beethoven's death, as both speaker and conductor. After he left Russia, he conducted <b>an</b> <b>evening</b> <b>of</b> his works in Paris in 1928. This was followed by engagements in Portugal, Spain, France, England, Czechoslovakia, Poland, the Netherlands, and the United States.|$|E
25|$|As producer, he {{has brought}} the drama Blasphemy, {{starring}} Cil Stengel, to the Portland, Oregon stage and also he also co-produced two separate productions of A.R. Gurney's hit Broadway play Love Letters. Wynn also produced {{the world premiere of}} Doug Grissom's one-act drama Contact starring Ryan Case and Barry Morse. Other live events he has produced include <b>An</b> <b>Evening</b> <b>of</b> Song With Nichelle Nichols, The Star Trek Anniversary Celebration with Robin Curtis and Paul Carr, and Out on Broadway with Grethe Cammermeyer.|$|E

50|$|Taking the odd {{permutations}} of {{the above}} coordinates with <b>an</b> <b>even</b> number <b>of</b> plus signs gives another form, the enantiomorph of the other one. Though {{it may not be}} immediately obvious, the figure obtained by taking the <b>even</b> permutations with <b>an</b> <b>even</b> number <b>of</b> plus signs is the same as that obtained by taking the odd permutations with an odd number of plus signs. Similarly, the mirror image has either an odd permutation with <b>an</b> <b>even</b> number <b>of</b> plus signs or <b>an</b> <b>even</b> permutation with <b>an</b> odd number of plus signs.|$|R

25|$|Tyne Tees went on air at 5pm on 15 January 1959, {{three years}} after the first British {{independent}} television station. The then-prime minister Harold Macmillan, who had been the Member of Parliament for the nearby Stockton-on-Tees for two decades, was interviewed live on the opening night. This was followed by a live variety show, named The Big Show, broadcast from a small studio. However, this local content was followed by an episode of the American police series Highway Patrol and <b>an</b> <b>evening</b> <b>of</b> entertainment programmes including I Love Lucy and Double Your Money.|$|E
25|$|In America Fein played Caroline of Brunswick to the Prince Regent of Walter Slezak in Norman Ginsbury’s The First Gentleman, but {{had left}} over {{creative}} differences {{by the time}} the show made its Broadway debut on 25 April 1957. The following year she was engaged to play Miriam in Christopher Fry's The First Born, but was replaced by Mildred Natwick a month before its April 30 debut on Broadway. Fein remained in United States for several years giving one-woman shows called <b>An</b> <b>Evening</b> <b>of</b> European Theatre in which she performed scenes taken from plays by noted European playwrights.|$|E
25|$|In 1949 Weekes {{accepted}} {{an offer of}} £500 to play as the professional for Bacup in the Lancashire League. When he first arrived in Bacup, Weekes was greatly affected by the cold and took to wearing an army great coat everywhere, to the extent it became part of his League image. His homesickness for Barbados was tempered by his landlady's potato pies {{and the presence of}} Worrell and Walcott, who were playing for League clubs Radcliffe and Enfield respectively. The three Ws would regularly meet at Weekes's house midweek for <b>an</b> <b>evening</b> <b>of</b> piano playing and jazz singing.|$|E
25|$|Marking the Rubik's Cube's centres {{increases}} its difficulty {{because this}} expands {{the set of}} distinguishable possible configurations. There are 46/2 (2,048) ways to orient the centres, since <b>an</b> <b>even</b> permutation <b>of</b> the corners implies <b>an</b> <b>even</b> number <b>of</b> quarter turns of centres as well. In particular, when the Cube is unscrambled apart from the orientations of the central squares, {{there will always be}} <b>an</b> <b>even</b> number <b>of</b> centre squares requiring a quarter turn. Thus orientations of centres increases the total number of possible Cube permutations from 43,252,003,274,489,856,000 (4.3×1019) to 88,580,102,706,155,225,088,000 (8.9×1022).|$|R
50|$|In an {{exceptionally}} difficult puzzle, one {{may use the}} Jordan curve theorem, which states that any open curve that starts and ends outside of a closed curve must intersect the closed curve <b>an</b> <b>even</b> number <b>of</b> times. In particular, this means that any row of the grid must have <b>an</b> <b>even</b> number <b>of</b> vertical lines and any column must have <b>an</b> <b>even</b> number <b>of</b> horizontal lines. When only one potential line segment {{in one of these}} groups is unknown, you can determine whether {{it is part of the}} loop or not with this theorem.|$|R

25|$|In {{the first}} quarter of 2014, Ellis {{performed}} in West End Anthems at the Watford Colosseum and also returned to 20th anniversary concert tour of RENT for dates across the UK in January and February. She also went back on the road with Brian May on The Candlelight Concerts tour between February and March as well as returning to London's Pheasantry, performing in A Night in the West End with the London Philharmonic Orchestra at the Royal Concert Hall, Nottingham, singing in a solo concert Live at the Gaiety Theatre on the Isle of Man, and performing at <b>An</b> <b>Evening</b> <b>of</b> Movies and Musicals with Joe McElderry in Scotland.|$|E
25|$|During {{the colonial}} period of North Carolina, the state capital was New Bern. For several years {{during and after the}} Revolutionary War there was no capital, and the General Assembly met in various locations. Fayetteville was the state capital from 1789 to 1793, when Raleigh became the {{permanent}} state capital. In 1792, a commission was appointed to select a site to build a permanent state capital. The commission members favored land owned by Colonel John Hinton across the Neuse River, but the night before the final vote the committee adjourned to the home of Joel Lane for <b>an</b> <b>evening</b> <b>of</b> food and spirits. The next day, the vote went in Lane's favor.|$|E

25|$|Barda {{was born}} in 1945 and spent his early {{childhood}} in Alexandria, Egypt, where {{his father was a}} lawyer and his mother a painter. The family returned to England in 1956. Barda attended Bryanston School and graduated from Birkbeck College, University of London (BA Hons Modern Langs), aspiring to apply his knowledge of modern languages as a commodities broker in the City. His early interest in photography was mostly documentary; while studying for his degree, he travelled to Romania to photograph the painted monasteries of Moldavia. When he was twenty, following a friend's suggestion, he attended his first concert of classical music: <b>an</b> <b>evening</b> <b>of</b> Viennese music conducted by John Barbirolli. Soon after, he started attending concerts several times per week, and listening regularly to BBC Radio 3.|$|E
25|$|On 20 April 1964, BBC2 {{planned to}} launch <b>an</b> <b>evening</b> <b>of</b> {{programmes}} beginning at 19.20. However, 35 {{minutes before the}} new channel went on air, a power failure spread through most of London, affecting BBC Television Centre, where BBC2's programme control was based. BBC1 and BBC News were unaffected as they were still based at Alexandra Palace. The first signs of the new identity were slides containing the BBC2 box logo with the caption 'Will start shortly'. The first night's transmission consisted of this slide interspersed with new bulletins, presented by Gerald Priestland, from the news room at Alexandra Palace, which featured the new logo in the background. At 22.00, the launch night was abandoned and the programme line-up was aired the following evening. The first programme aired was Play School at 11am.|$|E
25|$|Thornlea also {{boasts a}} {{thriving}} artistic community, with many prominent Canadian musicians among its alumni, including the groups The Philosopher Kings, Prozzak, By Divine Right, Kick Butt! Stop Smoking, hHead, Flutterboard, Hayden, and Moxy Früvous. Some {{of its more}} active extracurricular organizations are arts-oriented, {{in addition to other}} influential athletics-oriented organizations, two prominent ones being the Drama Club and the Music Council. The two organizations have been known to collaborate on intra-scholastic events and concerts. Notable quasi-annual examples of such events are known as Thornstock, and <b>An</b> <b>Evening</b> <b>of</b> the Arts. The Thornlea Lights Sets Sound (TLSS) committee also plays an instrumental role in the organization and orchestration of the school's extracurricular activities, as it is accountable for the technical work that many of the aforementioned events necessitate: for instance, the operation of audio-visual equipment, stage set-ups, mechanical labour and assistance, and so on.|$|E
