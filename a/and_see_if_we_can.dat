Perry Nemiroff of Cinema Blend speculated that Tron 3 could be the first installment in a new trilogy. On January 13, 2011, Ain't It Cool News reported that the film was close to having its sequel announced as part of Disney's plan for Tron future. On January 21, 2011, Tron-Sector reported an unsourced rumor that a sequel to Tron: Legacy had been green-lit and a teaser trailer would debut on the DVD and Blu-ray Disc releases of Tron and Tron: Legacy. Harry Knowles reported on the teaser, calling it a [...] "DVD Extra" [...] and noting that it had been filmed before Thanksgiving (i.e. before November 2010). On April 8, 2011, director Joseph Kosinski talked about the sequel: [...] "We're working on the story right now. Once we get a script we're all really happy with, we'll take it to the powers that be <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> go back to the grid. I think we will pick up with where Tron: Legacy left off with Sam and Quorra in the real world and what does that mean and the possibilities it opens up for the next chapter. It's that relationship between the two of them that's the next step." [...] On March 31, Kosinski said that the film's script was expected to be finished in two weeks and its working title is Tr3n.|$|E
2500|$|Discontent with Diệm and Nhu {{exploded}} into mass protest during mid-1963 when nine Buddhists {{died at the}} hand of Diệm's army and police on Vesak, the birthday of Gautama Buddha. In response, the US government {{was concerned about the}} possibility [...] "for the Dim/Nhu government to succeed and for us [...] to continue to support them." [...] The response by Ambassador Nolting was, [...] "We should take it slow and easy <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> live with the Diem government." [...] As a result of this potential inability to support the Diem/Nhu government, the United States government discussed a proposed coup. In a telegram to the American Embassy in Saigon, Mr. Hilsman expresses that at some point should we need [...] "political liquidation" [...] we should also [...] "urgently examine all possible alternative leadership and make detailed plans as to how we might bring about Diem's replacement if this should become necessary." [...] In May 1963, a law against the flying of religious flags was selectively enforced; the Buddhist flag was banned from display on Vesak while the Vatican flag was displayed to celebrate the anniversary of the consecration of Archbishop Pierre Martin Ngô Đình Thục, Diệm's brother. Many Buddhists defied the ban and a protest was ended when government forces opened fire. With Diệm remaining intransigent in the face of escalating Buddhist demands for religious equality, sections of society began calling for his removal from power.|$|E
