25|$|The aim of {{the game}} is to throw a {{different}} items <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> into a series of blenders before the time runs out. The player is given apples and bananas at the start. When the second level is reached, tomatoes are added. Level 3 adds cantaloupes, level 4 pineapples, level 5 strawberries and level 6 adds Fred FiggleCorns.|$|E
60|$|Mother sat <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> {{table from}} him, pretending {{to read the}} Grimsby Recorder, but really {{watching}} him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Me-ow!" [...] wailed the cat, {{and started}} <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> on a run, nearly {{upsetting}} Mrs. Green in its {{hurry to get}} away from more trouble.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> walled <b>kitchen</b> garden lies to the {{south-west}} of the House and to {{the south}} of the Mount Garden. The rectangular area with its perimeter walk was originally subdivided into three sections by two internal walls running from east to west <b>across</b> it. <b>The</b> <b>kitchen</b> garden walls contain further recessed arcading for fruit trees. The north wall has been demolished. The present wall which screens the garden from George Lane is a late C20 reconstruction, necessitated by widening of the road beyond.|$|R
6000|$|He {{opened his}} eyes, and there, {{hovering}} in the air, he saw as it were a little flame, crystal clear below, but mounting to the colour of rose, and shaped like a little pear. As soon {{as he looked at}} it it began softly to stir and float away from him <b>across</b> <b>the</b> glowery <b>kitchen.</b> And again <b>the</b> mysterious voice he had heard called softly: [...] "Follow, Prince of Tishnar, follow!" [...] With shining eyes he hobbled warily after the little flame that, burning tranquil in the air, about a span above his head, was floating quietly on.|$|R
500|$|The second Marquess {{preferred}} {{to live on}} the Isle of Bute in Scotland and only used Cardiff Castle occasionally. The castle saw little investment and only four full-time servants were maintained on the premises, meaning that cooked food had to be brought <b>across</b> from <b>the</b> <b>kitchens</b> at a nearby hotel. The castle remained at the centre of the Butes' political power base in Cardiff, however, with their faction sometimes termed as [...] "the Castle party". During the violent protests of the Merthyr Rising of 1831, the Marquess-based himself at Cardiff Castle, from where he directed operations and kept Whitehall informed of the unfolding events. The governance of the city of Cardiff was finally reformed by an act of Parliament in the 1835, introducing a town council and a mayor, severing the link with the castle constable.|$|R
60|$|The blow {{they had}} dreaded had fallen, {{and for several}} seconds neither spoke. Then Randy, who had pulled off one boot, flung it <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> floor.|$|E
60|$|Salome obeyed. She walked <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> and back, slowly, stiffly, falteringly, {{now that}} the {{stimulus}} of frantic fear was spent; but still she walked. The doctor nodded his satisfaction.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sara Stanley!" [...] Felicity flew <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b> [...] "Do {{you mean}} that you put the bread right into the oven after you kneaded it without leaving it to rise a second time?" ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{plans were}} {{drawn up by}} an Australian {{architect}} called Mr Smith working for the Watkins Partnership in Bristol. The most striking feature is the fin structure (to {{the left of the}} frontage) that spreads upwards into the air above the cinema. The size of this fin runs about 23 feet into the building, (about the depth of the foyer). Originally, there was a glass lit central feature rising the full height and according to the plan had the words [...] "cinema & café" [...] detailed into it. This feature today has been boxed over.Inside, the foyer executes a visual trick. The auditorium is set at a different angle to the façade by roughly 25 degrees. By creating a circular foyer the architect has disguised this fact, as without obvious side and back walls the patrons were unlikely to notice the change in direction. From the foyer were doors to a small lounge (off to the left - originally they had gold coloured rattan chairs and glass topped rattan tables) and stairs to the café, above the foyer. Light gained entry to the café by the large windows running <b>across</b> <b>the</b> frontage, <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> was placed under the large fin structure with a single window beyond the fin.|$|R
50|$|The FareStart Board and {{community}} have begun {{a movement to}} create a national network to enable best practice sharing among similar social entrepreneurial, food-based life skills training nationwide. In 2011, FareStart launched Catalyst Kitchens to help bring the success of FareStart to communities <b>across</b> <b>the</b> country. Catalyst <b>Kitchens</b> is a collaborative network of organizations with a vision to empower lives through job training, and self-generate revenue through social enterprise. Catalyst Kitchen's network members include Life's Kitchen (Boise, Idaho), Liberty's Kitchen (New Orleans, La.), Inspiration Corporation (Chicago, Ill.), and DC Central Kitchen (Washington, D.C.).|$|R
50|$|The food at Buca di Beppo {{is served}} family style, each item served à la carte and shared among the dining party. Some {{locations}} {{also have a}} lunch menu, featuring individual-sized portions. Each room at Buca is themed, and all restaurants have a Pope table—the largest single table, round, in a room by itself, with a bust of the Pope as centerpiece. Also, most locations have a table, usually inset to <b>the</b> wall, directly <b>across</b> from <b>the</b> main <b>kitchen,</b> at which <b>the</b> waiter and chefs will converse with you and allow you to sample many dishes.|$|R
60|$|Hetty {{was moving}} <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> with the currants, so her uncle {{did not see}} the little toss of the head with which she {{answered}} him. To ride in a spring-cart seemed a very miserable lot indeed to her now.|$|E
6000|$|He {{clutched}} it with quivering fingers. [...] "Hat!" [...] he repeated. Then {{he flung}} {{it to the}} ground, and kicked it with extraordinary fury <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b> It flew up against the door and {{dropped to the ground}} with its ribbon band half off.|$|E
60|$|With {{these words}} a person entered--a middle-aged man, in black. He walked {{straight}} <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> to an inner door, opened it, {{inclined his head}} forward, and stood listening. There was something to listen to, for the noise above was just then louder than ever.|$|E
6000|$|It led him {{past the}} gaunt black spit and the dying fire. It wafted <b>across</b> <b>the</b> great <b>kitchen</b> to <b>the</b> {{fifth of the}} gloomy arches, and stealthily as a shadow Nod stole after it. Under this arch and up the {{shelving}} gallery gently slid the guiding flame. And now Nod saw again the furry Earth-mulgars, lying on their stomachs in their sandy beds, whimpering and snuffling in their sleep. On glided the flame; after it crept Nod, scarcely daring to breathe. [...] "Softly, now softly," [...] he kept muttering to himself. And now this gallery began to slope downward, and he heard water dripping. A thin moss was growing on the stony walls. It felt colder as he descended. But Nod kept {{his eyes fixed on}} the clear, unswerving flame. And in the silence he heard a muffled groan, and a harsh voice muttered drowsily, [...] "Oo mutchee, nanga," [...] and he knew Thumb must be near.|$|R
5000|$|A breakfast {{area was}} created {{on the south}} end of <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> by framing in an {{existing}} enclosed patio. The original breakfast area had shared space with the laundry. At the same time, <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> cabinetry was slightly modified and <b>the</b> stove moved <b>across</b> <b>the</b> room, closer to the new breakfast area.|$|R
50|$|<b>Across</b> <b>the</b> bailey, {{along the}} eastern wall between the {{south-east}} tower and the water gate would have been <b>the</b> <b>kitchens.</b> <b>The</b> lightly built foundations suggest that the buildings were timber, built up against the curtain wall, with stone fireplaces, hearths, and ovens.|$|R
6000|$|His {{daughter}} interfered, {{and stopped}} {{him at the}} critical moment when he was actually offering his arm to conduct me in state <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b> Cristel had just put her pretty brown hand over his mouth, and said, [...] "Oh, father, do pray be quiet!" [...] when we were all three disturbed by another interruption.|$|E
60|$|HOTCHKISS. If I {{were your}} husband's {{superior}} here I should be his superior in heaven or hell: equality lies deeper than that. The coal merchant and I {{are in love}} with the same woman. That settles the question for me for ever. [He prowls <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> to the garden door, deep in thought].|$|E
60|$|But in {{the shadow}} of the narrow alley between the two houses she stood still and pleasured in the ring of his foot falls down the cement sidewalk. Not until they had quite died away did she go on. She crept up the back stairs and <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> to her room, {{registering}} her thanksgiving that Sarah was asleep.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>kitchen</b> machine {{remains very}} popular <b>across</b> <b>the</b> UK and Europe, and is slowly working into the US market where the KitchenAid, {{which is a}} similar kitchen tool, has a greater market share.|$|R
60|$|She was pleased. They went <b>across</b> <b>the</b> dark yard to <b>the</b> gate. Looking <b>across,</b> he {{saw through}} the uncurtained window of <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>the</b> heads of Mr. and Mrs. Leivers {{in the warm}} glow. It looked very cosy. The road, with pine trees, was quite black in front.|$|R
50|$|Cora {{appeared}} in Nicolas Humbert and Werner Penzel's 1990 documentary film on Fred Frith, Step <b>Across</b> <b>the</b> Border, in which Cora and Frith are filmed rehearsing at <b>The</b> <b>Kitchen,</b> New York City in February 1989.|$|R
6000|$|She could see, as {{she moved}} <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> that he had already searched there for {{something}} that he might eat, {{but that he had}} searched in vain. With the close economy common among his class in the islands, all comestibles were kept under close lock and key in the house of Mr. Bergen. Their daily allowance was given day by day to the negro servants, and even the fragments were then gathered up and locked away in safety. She moved <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> to the accustomed cupboard, taking the keys from her pocket, and he followed close upon her. There was a small oil lamp hanging from the low ceiling which just gave them light to see each other. She lifted her hand to this to tare it from its hook, but he prevented her. [...] "No, by Heaven!" [...] he said, [...] "you don't touch that till I've done with it. There's light enough for you to drag out your scraps." ...|$|E
60|$|I put out my {{hand and}} felt the meat chopper hanging to the wall. In a flash I was after him. I was fierce with fear. Before he was halfway <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> I had {{overtaken}} him. With one last touch of humanity I turned the blade back and struck him with the butt. He went headlong forward and lay stretched on the ground. I stumbled over him and stood panting. He lay still.|$|E
6000|$|Anne gently put Mrs. Lynde's arms {{away from}} her, walked blindly <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> through the hall, {{up the stairs}} to her old room. At its window she knelt down, staring out unseeingly. It was very dark. The rain was beating down over the {{shivering}} fields. The Haunted Woods was full of the groans of mighty trees wrung in the tempest, and the air throbbed with the thunderous crash of billows on the distant shore. And Gilbert was dying! ...|$|E
50|$|In {{this half}} of the season a baptist reverend named Jeremiah Cloutier comes to Oz for embezzlement. Cloutier is really a good person who is in Oz for {{stealing}} money, so Glynn privileges him more than the other prisoners. As a result Cloutier has a positive impact on several of Oz's inmates but is threatened by Catholic convert Timmy Kirk who is out to cause trouble. Kirk uses his conversion as an excuse to bully several Catholic inmates and then {{with the help of the}} Bikers gets Reverend Cloutier trapped into a wall that is being constructed. This gets worse when O'Reilly accidental leaves the gas stove turned on which is then ignited by a CO lighting a cigarette. The resulting explosion destroys the cafeteria leaving Cloutier with third degree burns <b>across</b> his body. <b>The</b> <b>kitchen</b> and Em City are both destroyed and Glynn must send all the inmates to Gen Pop.|$|R
60|$|The {{next minute}} {{he heard her}} {{stepping}} briskly about <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> shooing out intruding cats, and humming a darky air to herself. He went reluctantly back to the shore and rowed <b>across</b> <b>the</b> river in a brown study.|$|R
6000|$|He {{gathered}} the half-frightened, half-trusting boy {{into his arms}} for a moment, then, hand in hand, they fled <b>across</b> <b>the</b> yard, out of the gate, and down the street. They heard <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> door open, and the last they heard was: ...|$|R
60|$|Davy Spink rose, {{swallowed}} the beverage, {{and left the}} cottage. The captain returned, and stood for some time irresolute {{with his hand on}} the handle of the door of his sister's room. As he listened, he heard a sob, and the tones of Minnie's voice as if in prayer. Changing his mind, he walked softly <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> into his own room, where, having trimmed the candle, refilled and lit his pipe, he sat down at the table, and, resting his arms thereon, began to meditate.|$|E
60|$|Curly Jim sweated and fumed {{and poured}} out the whisky. He found {{himself with a}} score of {{arguments}} on his hands, not one of which {{had anything to do}} with the gold-mine he wanted to buy. The longer they talked the farther away they got from that gold-mine, and at two in the morning Curly Jim acknowledged himself beaten. One by one he led his helpless guests <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> floor and thrust them outside. O’Brien came last, and the three, with arms locked for mutual aid, titubated gravely on the stoop.|$|E
60|$|It was Marilla who spoke, alarm {{in every}} jerky word. Anne {{came through the}} hall, her hands full of white {{narcissus}},--it was long before Anne could love the sight or odor of white narcissus again,--in time to hear her and to see Matthew standing in the porch doorway, a folded paper in his hand, and his face strangely drawn and gray. Anne dropped her flowers and sprang <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> {{to him at the}} same moment as Marilla. They were both too late; before they could reach him Matthew had fallen across the threshold.|$|E
60|$|After milking, Caroline threw a shawl {{over her}} head and ran <b>across</b> <b>the</b> field. The house looked lonely and deserted. As she fumbled at the latch of <b>the</b> gate <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> door opened, and Christopher Holland {{appeared}} on the threshold.|$|R
60|$|He {{paused at}} the rough gate and leaned over it while he scanned the house and its {{surroundings}} eagerly. As he looked, <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> door opened and Min, clad in the old overcoat, came out and walked swiftly <b>across</b> <b>the</b> yard.|$|R
60|$|On {{the fourteenth}} day I went into <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> and I was {{surprised}} to find that the fronds of the red weed had grown right <b>across</b> <b>the</b> hole in the wall, turning the half-light of the place into a crimson-coloured obscurity.|$|R
