Case {{studies have been}} used to provide an insight into the practical issues associated with the assessment of marine ecosystem goods <b>and</b> <b>services</b> at specific locations. The aim of this research was to validate the definitions of goods <b>and</b> <b>services,</b> <b>and</b> to identify knowledge gaps and likely difficulties of quantifying the goods <b>and</b> <b>services.</b> A validated theoretical framework for the assessment of goods <b>and</b> <b>services</b> is detailed, <b>and</b> examples of the goods <b>and</b> <b>services</b> at a variety of case study areas are documented. These results will enable future assessments of marine ecosystem goods <b>and</b> <b>services.</b> It is concluded that the utilisation of this goods <b>and</b> <b>services</b> approach has the capacity to play a fundamental role in the Ecosystem Approach, by enabling the pressures and demands of society, the economy and the environment to be integrated into environmental management...|$|R
