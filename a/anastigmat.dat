40|$|This thesis {{describes}} an analytical {{approach to the}} optical design of four-mirror anastigmatic optical systems. In all cases investigated here the object is at infinity. In the introduction the field of reflecting, or "catoptric", optical system design is discussed and given some historical context. The concept of the "simplest possible reflecting anastigmat" is raised in connection with Plate Diagram analysis. It is shown that four-plate systems are in general the simplest possible <b>anastigmats,</b> and that four-plate systems comprised of four spherical mirrors are the last family of "simplest possible reflecting anastigmats" for which the complete solution set remains unknown. In chapter 2 third-order aberration coefficients in wavefront measure are derived {{in a form that}} is particularly suitable for Plate Diagram analysis. These coefficients are subsequently used to describe the Plate Diagram, and to detail the application of the Plate Diagram to the survey of all possible solutions for four-spherical-mirror <b>anastigmats.</b> The Plate Diagram technique is also generalized to investigate its use as an optical design tool. In the example given a generalized Plate Diagram approach is used to determine solutions for four-mirror <b>anastigmats</b> with a prescribed first-order layout and a minimum number of conicoids. In chapter 3 results are presented for the survey of four-spherical-mirror <b>anastigmats</b> in which all elements are required to be smaller than the primary mirror. Two novel families of four-spherical-mirror <b>anastigmats</b> are presented and these are shown to be the only examples of four-spherical-mirror systems that exist under the given constraints. Chapter 4 gives an example of the application of Plate Diagram analysis to the design of an anastigmatic system with a useful first-order layout and a minimum number of conicoid mirrors. It is shown that systems with useful first-order layouts and only one conicoid mirror can be obtained using this method. In chapter 5 results are presented of the survey of all remaining four-spherical-mirror anastigmatic systems: that is systems in which elements are allowed to exceed the diameter of the entrance pupil, which includes systems with concave and convex primary mirrors. A wide variety of solutions are presented and classified according to both the underlying geometry of the solutions and the first-order layouts. Of these systems only one has been reported in previously published literature. The results presented in this thesis complete the set of "four-plate" reflecting <b>anastigmats,</b> and it can now be said that all possible solutions for four-spherical-mirror anastigmatic systems have been determined...|$|R

50|$|The {{amount of}} {{aberration}} due to astigmatism {{is proportional to}} the square of the angle between the rays from the object and the optical axis of the system.

40|$|TMA, {{or three}} mirror <b>anastigmats,</b> {{have already been}} used {{successfully}} for various space missions. In the frame of earth observation, ProbaV satellite uses 3 TMAs to cover a total 102. 4 ° field-of-view; ground sampling distance is about 100 m {{at the center of}} field-of view and 370 m at the edge. For future earth observation missions, the goal would be to reach 100 m spatial resolution all over the 102. 4 ° FOV. This would require to up-scale optical specifications, thus increasing geometrical aberrations. FMA, or four mirror <b>anastigmats,</b> could thus be a good candidate for future missions, as a fourth mirror would allow better correction of optical aberrations. In this work, TMA and FMA have been optimized over different fields-of view. Performance limitations are then derived, which show that FMA seems promising for future missions. Radiometry aspects are discussed and preliminary tolerance analysis is carried out...|$|R
40|$|An image {{stabilization}} optical system using deformable freeform mirrors is proposed {{that enables the}} ray sets to couple dynamically in the object and image space. It aims to correct image blurring and degradation when there is relative movement between the imaging optical axis and the object. In this method, Fermat’s principle and matrix methods are {{used to describe the}} optical path of the entire optical system with a shift object plane and a fixed corresponding image plane in the carrier coordinate system. A constant optical path length is determined for each ray set, so the correspondence between the object and the shift free image point is used to calculate the solution to the points on the surface profile of the deformable mirrors (DMs). Off-axis three-mirror <b>anastigmats</b> are used to demonstrate the benefits of optical {{image stabilization}} with one- and two-deformable mirrors...|$|R

40|$|Three mirror <b>anastigmats</b> (TMA) are {{telescopic}} optical {{systems with}} only plane symmetry, {{that allow for}} good image quality without any central obscuration. The complexities of manufacturing and alignment can be reduced by fabricating the first mirror and the third mirror in one piece and defining a common axis of all the mirrors. It is attractive to use off-axis used aspheres and {{to come to an}} acceptable performance with the smallest number of freeform surfaces. In this paper, different types of freeform surfaces are considered to evaluate their potential. In the performed case study, the correction of spherical aberration and coma is best corrected in the pupil with the second mirror and to select the Zernike representation with remaining x-symmetry {{is one of the best}} ways to do this. The use of the Chebyshev polynomials also gives good results. Furthermore it is found, that the first mirror and the third mirror are quite beneficial to be modelled as off-axis aspheres of the Q-type. The result shows that a combination of two Q-aspheres with a Zernike surface at the second mirror is one of the most favorable combinations...|$|R
5000|$|Glass with weaker {{dispersive}} power (greater [...] ) is named crown glass; that with greater {{dispersive power}}, flint glass. For {{the construction of}} an achromatic collective lens ( [...] positive) it follows, by means of equation (4), that a collective lens I. of crown glass and a dispersive lens II. of flint glass must be chosen; the latter, although the weaker, corrects the other chromatically by its greater dispersive power. For an achromatic dispersive lens the converse must be adopted. This is, at the present day, the ordinary type, e.g., of telescope objective; the values of the four radii must satisfy the equations (2) and (4). Two other conditions may also be postulated: one is always the elimination of the aberration on the axis; the second either the Herschel or Fraunhofer Condition, the latter being the best vide supra, Monochromatic Aberration). In practice, however, it is often more useful to avoid the second condition by making the lenses have contact, i.e. equal radii. According to P. Rudolph (Eder's Jahrb. f. Photog., 1891, 5, p. 225; 1893, 7, p. 221), cemented objectives of thin lenses permit the elimination of spherical aberration on the axis, if, as above, the collective lens has a smaller refractive index; on the other hand, they permit the elimination of astigmatism and curvature of the field, if the collective lens has a greater refractive index (this follows from the Petzval equation; see L. Seidel, Astr. Nachr., 1856, p. 289). Should the cemented system be positive, then the more powerful lens must be positive; and, according to (4), to the greater power belongs the weaker dispersive power (greater [...] ), that is to say, crown glass; consequently the crown glass must have the greater refractive index for astigmatic and plane images. In all earlier kinds of glass, however, the dispersive power increased with the refractive index; that is, [...] decreased as [...] increased; but some of the Jena glasses by E. Abbe and O. Schott were crown glasses of high refractive index, and achromatic systems from such crown glasses, with flint glasses of lower refractive index, are called the new achromats, and were employed by P. Rudolph in the first <b>anastigmats</b> (photographic objectives).|$|R

In 1902, he realized that reversing the two rear elements of the Unar and returning to a cemented doublet would improve performance; he named the result [...] "Tessar", from the Greek word τέσσερα (téssera, four) to indicate a four-element design.|$|E
