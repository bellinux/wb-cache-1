40|$|For a {{long time}} basic <b>accommodation</b> {{capacities}} represented the dominant type of <b>accommodation</b> in tourist offer, {{while at the same}} time complementary <b>accommodation</b> capacities were neglected. However, recently there has been a growing interest for complementary, substitute types of tourist <b>accommodation,</b> both in the Republic of Croatia and in Dubrovnik, where since 2000 a significant increase of over night stays has been registered, especially in private <b>accommodation.</b> In this paper rooms, apartments, studio apartments and holiday houses owned by physical entities are referred to as private <b>accommodation.</b> Private <b>accommodation</b> enables tourists to engage in everyday life of local residents, learn about history, tradition and culture of a destination. Thus, a tourist may experience and taste the beauties and attractions of a place, truly enjoy autochthonous products and services, as well as obtain genuine knowledge on authentic attractions and tourist offer of a destination. Inadequate offer of private tourist <b>accommodation</b> has negative influence when forming the overall tourist offer of a destination. Poor quality of <b>accommodation</b> units, unprofessional conduct of holders of tourist <b>accommodation</b> offer towards consumers and lack of interest for the needs and wishes of the consumer of this complementary <b>accommodation</b> have all contributed in creating a bad image on this kind of <b>accommodation</b> in tourist offer. Consequently, this paper aims, by analysing the consumers of private tourist <b>accommodation,</b> to point out the importance of private <b>accommodation</b> in overal tourist offer of a destination, to prove that private <b>accommodation</b> tourist offer attracts an increasing number of tourists, and propose to local tourist administration directives on how to create a more efficient procedure in order to ensure a more efficient and better quality administration of tourist private <b>accommodation</b> offer, aiming to improve the overall tourist offer at a destination...|$|R
