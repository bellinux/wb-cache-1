The two water molecules were held differently in the crystal lattice. This dihydrate desolvated readily under low relative humidities to form the monohydrate which had a different diffraction pattern. The monohydrate desolvated with no major differences in the powder pattern. The solid state (2 ̆ 713) C NMR and the IR-spectra of the dihydrate and monohydrate were very similar. ^ The crystal structure of cefazolin pentahydrate was determined by X-ray crystallography.

40|$|International audienceExcessive placental {{inflammation}} {{is associated}} with several pathological conditions, including stillbirth and fetal growth restriction. Although infection is a known cause of inflammation, {{a significant proportion of}} pregnancies have evidence of inflammation without any detectable infection. Inflammation can also be triggered by endogenous mediators, called damage associated molecular patterns or alarmins. One of these damage-associated molecular patterns, uric acid, is increased in the maternal circulation in pathological pregnancies and is a known agonist of the Nlrp 3 inflammasome and inducer of inflammation. However, its effects within the placenta and on pregnancy outcomes remain largely unknown. We found that uric <b>acid</b> (<b>monosodium</b> urate [MSU]) crystals induce a proinflammatory profile in isolated human term cytotrophoblast cells, with a predominant secretion of IL- 1 β and IL- 6, a result confirmed in human term placental explants. The proinflammatory effects of MSU crystals were shown to be IL- 1 -dependent using a caspase- 1 inhibitor (inhibits IL- 1 maturation) and IL- 1 Ra (inhibits IL- 1 signaling). The proinflammatory effect of MSU crystals was accompanied by trophoblast apoptosis and decreased syncytialization. Correspondingly, administration of MSU crystals to rats during late gestation induced placental inflammation and was associated with fetal growth restriction. These results make a strong case for an active proinflammatory role of MSU crystals at the maternal-fetal interface in pathological pregnancies, and highlight a key mediating role of IL- 1. Furthermore, our study describes a novel in vivo animal model of noninfectious inflammation during pregnancy, which is triggered by MSU crystals and leads to reduced fetal growth...|$|R

Chemically, amoxicillin trihydrate is (2 S, 5 R, 6 R) - 6 -[(R) -(-) - 2 -Amino- 2 -(phydroxyphenyl) acetamido]- 3, 3 -dimethyl- 7 -oxo- 4 -thia- 1 -azabicyclo[3. 2. 0]heptane- 2 -carboxylic acid trihydrate and may be represented structurally as: The amoxicillin sodium molecular formula is C 16 H 18 N 3 NaO 5 S, and the molecular weight is 387. 39. Chemically, amoxicillin sodium is [2 S-[2 α, 5 α, 6 β(S*) ]]- 6 -[[Amino(4 hydroxyphenyl) acetyl]amino]- 3, 3 -dimethyl- 7 -oxo- 4 -thia- 1 -azabicyclo[3. 2. 0]heptane- 2 -carboxylic <b>acid</b> <b>monosodium</b> salt and may be represented structurally as: Clavulanic acid is produced by the fermentation of Streptomyces clavuligerus. It is a β-lactam structurally related to the penicillins and possesses the ability to inactivate a wide variety of β-lactamases by blocking the active sites of these enzymes. Clavulanic acid is particularly active against the clinically important plasmid-mediated β-lactamases frequently responsible for transferred drug resistance to penicillins and cephalosporins. The clavulanate potassium molecular formula is C 8 H 8 KNO 5, and the molecular weight is 237. 25. Chemically, clavulanate potassium is potassium (Z) -(2 R, 5 R) - 3 -(2 -hydroxyethylidene) - 7 -oxo- 4 -oxa- 1 -azabicyclo[3. 2. 0]-heptane- 2 carboxylate, and may be represented structurally as: NDA 50 - 785 /S- 01...|$|R
40|$|Pleurotus eryngii (DC. : Fr.) Ouel. {{was used}} in {{solid-state}} fermentation to develop novel mushroom products with a high amount of ergothioneine. The correlation coefficients between ergothioneine content and biomass were 0. 8878 and 0. 9206 for fermented adlay and buckwheat, respectively. Using optimal conditions, Pleurotus-fermented adlay and buckwheat (PFA and PFB) with the ergothioneine contents of 795. 5 and 786. 1 mg/kg, respectively, were prepared. However, mycelia contained the highest ergothioneine content of 1514. 6 mg/kg. As a result of SSF by P eryngii, PFA and PFB contained more taste components than ad lay and buckwheat, as evidenced by higher contents of total sugars and polyols, total free amino <b>acids</b> and <b>monosodium</b> glutamate like components, and total and flavor 5 '-nucleotides. In addition, PFB and buckwheat showed comparable equivalent umami concentration (EUC) values, whereas PFA showed a higher EUC value than adlay. Overall, Pleurotus-fermented products with a high amount of ergothioneine will be a novel functional food...|$|R
30|$|Glu is {{the primary}} natural ligand of iGluRs in {{the central nervous system}} in animals (Traynelis et al. 2010). In this research, the {{effectiveness}} of different amino acids was tested using the rice expressing aequorin. Of all the amino acids tested, Glu was clearly the most effective agonist to evoke the [Ca 2 +]i increase in rice roots. This is different from the previous reports that a broad range of agonist of amino acids were able to induce Ca 2 + responses in Arabidopsis (Qi et al. 2006; Vincill et al. 2012; Zhu et al. 2013). We tested the six amino acids which were reported to induce Ca 2 + responses in aequorin-based luminescence system in Arabidopsis (Zhu et al. 2013). None of them, except Glu, induced induce Ca 2 + in rice. It is worth noting that our aequorin-based luminescence imaging system was only able to reflect the [Ca 2 +]i level in rice roots in contrast with the whole seedlings in Arabidopsis (Zhang et al. 2015). It is possible that other amino acids instead of Glu are able to induce [Ca 2 +]i increase in rice shoots. Alternatively, rice may have evolved different approaches to cope with amino acid signals in different environmental conditions after the divergence of monocots and dicots. It was reported that acidic pH could also cause [Ca 2 +]i increase (Zhu et al. 2013). In our experiment, we used glutamic <b>acid</b> <b>monosodium</b> salt solution for glutamate treatments, and the pH value was very close to 7 and would not cause a pH effect in our experiment. In addition, according to our time course experiment, the [Ca 2 +]i response was very rapid (within 20  s). This is different from the pH effect, which lasts for several minutes (Zhu et al. 2013). According to our previous results, 100  mM of NaCl had no significant effect to [Ca 2 +]i increase in rice roots (Zhang et al. 2015). While in our experiment, the concentration of Na+ was only 10  mM. Therefore, the [Ca 2 +]i increase in rice roots was caused by glutamate, not by pH or salt stress effects.|$|R
40|$|Gout is {{the most}} common form of {{inflammatory}} arthritis in the elderly. In the last two decades, both hyperuricemia and gout have increased markedly and similar trends in the epidemiology of the metabolic syndrome have been observed. Recent studies provide new insights into the transporters that handle uric acid in the kidney as well as possible links between these transporters, hyperuricemia, and hypertension. The treatment of established hyperuricemia has also seen new developments. Febuxostat and PEGuricase are two novel treatments that have been evaluated and shown to be highly effective in the management of hyperuricemia, thus enlarging the therapeutic options available to lower uric <b>acid</b> levels. <b>Monosodium</b> urate (MSU) crystals are potent inducers of inflammation. Within the joint, they trigger a local inflammatory reaction, neutrophil recruitment, and the production of proinflammatory cytokines as well as other inflammatory mediators. Experimentally, the uptake of MSU crystals by monocytes involves interactions with components of the innate immune system, namely Toll-like receptor (TLR) - 2, TLR- 4, and CD 14. Intracellularly, MSU crystals activate multiple processes that lead to the formation o...|$|R
40|$|Commercial soup bases, in {{the form}} of broth cubes {{available}} in the market, include chicken, mushroom, pork and seafood broth cubes. The non-volatile taste components of four broth cubes were studied. Equivalent umami concentration (EUC) values of these broth cubes were evaluated and compared with their sensory results from hedonic tests. Only two soluble sugars, lactose and sucrose, were found. Contents of total free amino <b>acids</b> and <b>monosodium</b> glutamate (MSG) -like components ranged from 0. 51 to 1. 04 mg g(- 1) and 0. 48 to 0. 56 mg g(- 1), respectively. Contents of 5 '-nucleotides and flavour 5 '-nucleotides ranged from 2. 67 to 3. 66 mg g(- 1) and 2. 58 to 3. 33 mg g(- 1), respectively. EUC values were low and the umami intensities of one gramme of four soup bases were equivalent to those given by 0. 14 - 0. 32 g MSG. Mushroom and pork soups were more preferred, whereas seafood soup was less preferred. Correlations of EUC values with sensory scores were established for chicken, pork and seafood soups.

40|$|DEVELOPMENT OF A GLUTAMATE ELECTROCHEMICAL BIOSENSOR Julie Doležalová (Department of Analytical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Charles University in Prague) In {{cooperation}} with: Sofia A. L. P. Gomes, Alberto N. Araújo (Department of Physical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Porto) L-Glutamic <b>acid</b> and <b>monosodium</b> glutamate {{are used}} to enhance flavour in food prepared at home, restaurants, and by the food processing industry [1]. Glutamate also {{plays an important role}} in many metabolic processes. Nevertheless its use is being kept under certain limits as some people have experienced adverse effects, such as stiffness and tension, after its ingestion. Moreover, some studies demonstrate its connection with the appearance of neurological manifestations, such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. The determination of L-glutamic acid is therefore of major importance. In this work a novel L-glutamate biosensor was developed using a dehydrogenase enzyme (L-glutamate dehydrogenase). These redox enzyme requires for its activity nicotinamide (NAD(P) + /NAD(P) H) coenzyme, which reduced form was electrochemically regenerated by the water-soluble dye, methylene green. Graphite electrodes were modified with a poly(methylene green) thin film by means of methylene green electrochemical polymerization [...] ...|$|R
