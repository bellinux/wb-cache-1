5|$|Due to {{increasing}} {{concerns about the}} use of chess engines and outside communication, in 2014 FIDE banned all mobile phones from the playing area during chess competitions, under penalty of forfeiture of the game or even expulsion from the tournament. However, the rules <b>also</b> <b>allow</b> for less rigid enforcement in amateur events.|$|E
5|$|Eliza died in childbirth, leaving Low {{with his}} daughter. The {{loss of his}} wife had a {{profound}} effect on Low: in his later career of piracy, he would often express regret for the daughter he left behind, and refused to press-gang married men into joining his crews. He would <b>also</b> <b>allow</b> women to return to port safely. At first working honestly as a rigger, in early 1722 he joined a gang of twelve men on a sloop headed for Honduras, where they planned to collect a shipment of logs for resale in Boston.|$|E

5|$|Having {{established}} {{control of}} the islands, between 1651 and 1652 Blake constructed Cromwell's Castle on Tresco, named after Oliver Cromwell, the Parliamentary leader. It was intended to protect the deep water entrance to New Grimsby harbour {{on the west side}} of the island, a route which could <b>also</b> <b>allow</b> enemy vessels access through to the other Scilly Isles. The Parliamentarian forces were particularly concerned about any potential Dutch attack.|$|E
5|$|In July 2009 it was {{announced}} that traces of ammonia had been found in the plumes during flybys in July and October 2008. Reducing the freezing point of water with ammonia would <b>also</b> <b>allow</b> for outgassing and higher gas pressure, and less heat required to power the water plumes. The subsurface layer heating the surface water ice could be an ammonia–water slurry at temperatures as low as , and thus less energy is required to produce the plume activity.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} before the FairTax is implemented, {{there could be}} a strong {{incentive}} for individuals to buy goods without the sales tax using credit. After the FairTax is in effect, the credit could be paid off using untaxed payroll. If credit incentives do not change, opponents of the FairTax worry it could exacerbate an existing consumer debt problem. Proponents of the FairTax state that this effect could <b>also</b> <b>allow</b> individuals to pay off their existing (pre-FairTax) debt more quickly, and studies suggest lower interest rates after FairTax passage.|$|E

5|$|In the report, Hamilton {{felt that}} the {{securities}} should be paid at full value to their legitimate owners, including those who took the financial risk of buying government bonds that most experts thought would never be redeemed. He argued that liberty and property security were inseparable {{and that the government}} should honor the contracts, as they formed the basis of public and private morality. To Hamilton, the proper handling of the government debt would <b>also</b> <b>allow</b> America to borrow at affordable interest rates and would also be a stimulant to the economy.|$|E
5|$|Information {{about other}} {{subjects}} besides revenues also {{is contained in}} the rolls, including the movement of prisoners, which helps to identify which medieval castles were used as prisons. The Pipe rolls <b>also</b> <b>allow</b> {{the identification of the}} custodians of royal lands and castles. The clerks writing the rolls also used them as places to deride officials of the government, such as William Longchamp, who was the object of derision in the 1194 Pipe roll.|$|E

Rogers owns a 47% stake in WLYK's licensee, Border International Broadcasting.|$|E

5|$|Most Nahuatl {{varieties}} have {{a number}} of ways to alter the valency of a verb. Classical Nahuatl had a passive voice (also sometimes defined as an impersonal voice), but this is not found in most modern varieties. However the applicative and causative voices are found in many modern dialects. Many Nahuatl varieties <b>also</b> <b>allow</b> forming verbal compounds with two or more verbal roots.|$|E

5|$|The {{chemical}} reactions of metabolism are organized into metabolic pathways, {{in which one}} chemical is transformed {{through a series of}} steps into another chemical, by a sequence of enzymes. Enzymes are crucial to metabolism because they allow organisms to drive desirable reactions that require energy that will not occur by themselves, by coupling them to spontaneous reactions that release energy. Enzymes act as catalysts that allow the reactions to proceed more rapidly. Enzymes <b>also</b> <b>allow</b> the regulation of metabolic pathways in response to changes in the cell's environment or to signals from other cells.|$|E
5|$|The Østfold Line is {{the railway}} that connects Norway to Continental Europe, and 80% of all land-based, {{international}} freight transport goes through Østfold. Until the Follo Line opens, there cannot be a capacity increase on international freight trains to Norway. The Rail Administration {{has set a}} goal of tripling the amount of rail freight by 2040, which for the South Corridor is equal to the removal of 750 trucks per day from European Route E18. The Follo Line will <b>also</b> <b>allow</b> freight trains to pass during rush hour.|$|E
5|$|To avoid injury during descent, divers must be {{competent}} at equalising the ears, sinuses and mask; {{they must}} also learn not to hold their breath while ascending, to avoid barotrauma of the lungs. The speed of ascent must be controlled to avoid DCS, which requires buoyancy control skills. Good buoyancy control and trim <b>also</b> <b>allow</b> the diver to manoeuvre and move about safely, comfortably and efficiently, using swimfins for propulsion.|$|E

5|$|A {{successful}} {{invasion of}} Egypt would have several further advantages for the Byzantine Empire. Egypt {{was a rich}} province, and {{in the days of}} the Roman Empire it had supplied much of the grain for Constantinople before it was lost to the Arabs in the 7th century. The revenues that the Empire could have expected to gain from the conquest of Egypt would have been considerable, even if these would have to be shared with the Crusaders. Furthermore, Manuel may have wanted to encourage Amalric's plans, not only to deflect the ambitions of the Latins away from Antioch, but also to create new opportunities for joint military ventures that would keep the King of Jerusalem in his debt, and would <b>also</b> <b>allow</b> the Empire to share in territorial gains.|$|E
5|$|COBOL {{supports}} three file formats, or : sequential, indexed and relative. In sequential files, {{records are}} contiguous {{and must be}} traversed sequentially, similarly to a linked list. Indexed files have one or more indexes which allow records to be randomly accessed and which can be sorted on them. Each record must have a unique key, but other, , record keys need not be unique. Implementations of indexed files vary between vendors, although common implementations, such as C‑ISAM and VSAM, are based on IBM's ISAM. Relative files, like indexed files, have a unique record key, {{but they do not}} have alternate keys. A relative record's key is its ordinal position; for example, the 10th record has a key of 10. This means that creating a record with a key of 5 may require the creation of (empty) preceding records. Relative files <b>also</b> <b>allow</b> for both sequential and random access.|$|E
