He received his bachelor's degree but financial problems {{after his father}} became ill prevented him obtaining a master's degree. He returned to Bahrain to find employment. During his college years, he remained independent of political affiliations. According to Rajab, despite lacking <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> what constitutes a culture of human rights or knowledge of human rights standards and norms, he was active within the general Bahraini students union, speaking out against all forms of injustice. He also became involved in international campaigning on specific issues.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} writing came to Japan from the Korean kingdom of Baekje {{in the form}} of {{classical}} Chinese books likely written on paper and {{in the form of}} manuscript rolls (kansubon). This probably happened {{at the beginning of the}} 5th century (around 400), and certainly during the 6th century. According to legend the scholar Wani introduced the Chinese writing system as well as Confucianism to Japan. The oldest texts of Japanese origin, which show <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the concept of writing, date to the 5th century and are—like most texts from before 700—inscriptions on stone or metal.|$|E

25|$|The Founding Father who {{perhaps most}} studied and valued Machiavelli as a {{political}} philosopher was John Adams, who profusely commented on the Italian's thought in his work, A Defence of the Constitutions of Government of the United States of America. In this work, John Adams praised Machiavelli, with Algernon Sidney and Montesquieu, as a philosophic defender of mixed government. For Adams, Machiavelli restored empirical reason to politics, while his analysis of factions was commendable. Adams likewise agreed with the Florentine that human nature was immutable and driven by passions. He also accepted Machiavelli's belief that all societies were subject to cyclical periods of growth and decay. For Adams, Machiavelli lacked only <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the institutions necessary for good government.|$|E
25|$|While glacier {{variations}} {{are likely}} to have minimal effects upon global climate, their recession may have contributed one third to one half of the observed 20th Century rise in sea level (Meier 1984; IPCC 1996). Furthermore, it is extremely likely that such extensive glacier recession as is currently observed in the Western Cordillera of North America, where runoff from glacierized basins is used for irrigation and hydropower, involves significant hydrological and ecosystem impacts. Effective water-resource planning and impact mitigation in such areas depends upon developing a sophisticated knowledge of the status of glacier ice and the mechanisms that cause it to change. Furthermore, <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the mechanisms at work is crucial to interpreting the global-change signals that are contained in the time series of glacier mass balance records.|$|E
