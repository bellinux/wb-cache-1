5|$|Almost {{nothing is}} known about the {{behaviour}} of Newton's parakeet, but it is probable that it was similar to that of other members of its genus. Leguat mentioned that the parrots of the island <b>ate</b> <b>the</b> nuts of the bois d'olive tree (Cassine orientalis). Tafforet also stated that the parrots <b>ate</b> <b>the</b> seeds of the bois de buis shrub (Fernelia buxifolia), which is endangered today, but was common all over Rodrigues and nearby islets during his visit. Newton's parakeet may have fed on leaves as the related echo parakeet does. The fact that it survived long after Rodrigues had been heavily deforested shows that its ecology was less vulnerable than that of, for example, the Rodrigues parrot.|$|E
5|$|In his First Summer in the Sierra, John Muir {{notes that}} the Digger Indians of California <b>ate</b> <b>the</b> tickling, acid gasters of the large jet-black {{carpenter}} ants. The Mexican Indians eat the replete workers, or living honey-pots, of the honey ant (Myrmecocystus).|$|E
5|$|Gaylussacia brachycera {{is easily}} {{distinguished}} from {{other members of}} its genus by its leaves: they resemble those of boxwood (hence its name) and lack the resin glands typical of huckleberries. Like its relatives, it bears white urn-shaped flowers in the early summer, which develop to blue, edible berries in late summer. It is mostly found in Appalachia; many of its stations there were known to natives, who picked and <b>ate</b> <b>the</b> berries, before botanists became aware {{of them in the}} 1920s.|$|E

5|$|In the past, Native Americans <b>ate</b> <b>the</b> {{flesh of}} {{horseshoe}} crabs, {{and used the}} tail spines as spear tips and the shells to bail water out of their canoes. More recent attempts to use horseshoe crabs as food for livestock were abandoned when {{it was found that}} this gave the meat a bad taste. Horseshoe crab blood contains a clotting agent, limulus amebocyte lysate, which is used to test antibiotics and kidney machines to ensure that they are free of dangerous bacteria, and to detect spinal meningitis and some cancers.|$|E
5|$|Tafforet also {{mentioned}} that the parrots <b>ate</b> <b>the</b> seeds of the Fernelia buxifolia shrub ("bois de buis"), which is endangered today, but was common all over Rodrigues and nearby islets during his visit. Due to a large population of introduced rats on Rodrigues, the parrots, the Rodrigues starling (Necropsar rodericanus), and the Rodrigues pigeon (Nesoenas rodericanus), frequented and nested on offshore islets, where the rats were absent.|$|E
5|$|The {{mainstay}} of the Ancient Greek diet was bread, and this was accompanied by goat's cheese, olives, figs, fish, and occasionally meat. The vegetables grown included onions, garlic, cabbages, melons, and lentils. In Ancient Rome, a thick porridge was made of emmer wheat or beans, accompanied by green vegetables but little meat, and fish was not esteemed. The Romans grew broad beans, peas, onions and turnips and <b>ate</b> <b>the</b> leaves of beets rather than their roots.|$|E

5|$|The puffball is edible {{when the}} gleba is still firm and white. They are {{reportedly}} {{consumed by the}} tribal people of Madhya Pradesh. In Mexico, a large collection was consumed by several people who confused the species with Calvatia, a puffball genus containing popular edible members. Of the five who <b>ate</b> <b>the</b> fungus, two had gastrointestinal symptoms including stomachache, flatulence, and diarrhea; the other three did not have symptoms. The large European bird great bustard (Otis tarda) has been recorded feeding on the puffball.|$|E
5|$|The small Asian {{mongoose}} (Herpestus javanicus) {{was introduced}} to Hawaii {{in order to control}} the rat population. However the mongoose was diurnal, and the rats emerged at night; so it preyed on the endemic birds of Hawaii, especially their eggs, more often than it <b>ate</b> <b>the</b> rats, and now both rats and mongooses threaten the birds. This introduction was undertaken without understanding the consequences of such an action. No regulations existed at the time, and more careful evaluation should prevent such releases now.|$|E
5|$|They {{have created}} some dishes and desserts based on {{perfumes}} such as Calvin Klein's Eternity, Carolina Herrera, Lancôme and Bulgari. This {{has resulted in}} a perfume being released by the restaurant itself, called Nuvol de Ilimona. It was based on a dessert served at the restaurant called Lemon Distillation, and was developed to spray as a mist over the diners as they <b>ate</b> <b>the</b> dish. The wine list is split into separate lists for red and white, and is delivered on a trolley to each table.|$|E

5|$|A {{key part}} of the Recovery Plan is the {{supplementary}} feeding of females. The kakapo breeds only once every two to five years, when a certain type of plant species, primarily Dacrydium cupressinum (rimu), produces protein-rich fruit and seeds. Observations of the relationship between intermittent breeding and the plant's mast year help biologists choose which suitable supplementary foods to increase kakapo breeding frequency. In 1989, six preferred foods (apples, sweet potatoes, almonds, Brazil nuts, sunflower seeds and walnuts) were supplied ad libitum each night to 12 feeding stations. Males and females <b>ate</b> <b>the</b> supplied foods, and females nested on Little Barrier Island in the summers of 1989–91 {{for the first time since}} 1982, although nesting success was low.|$|E
5|$|Another {{tradition}} {{says that}} the Black Stone was originally an angel that had been placed by God in the Garden of Eden to guard Adam. The angel was absent when Adam <b>ate</b> <b>the</b> forbidden fruit and was punished by being turned into a jewel — the Black Stone. God granted it the power of speech and placed it {{at the top of}} Abu Qubays, a mountain in the historic region of Khurasan, before moving the mountain to Mecca. When Ibrahim took the Black Stone from Abu Qubays to build the Kaaba, the mountain asked Ibrahim to intercede with God so {{that it would not be}} returned to Khurasan and would stay in Mecca.|$|E
5|$|Both the Rodrigues {{solitaire}} and the dodo are now extinct. A common {{threshold of}} the extinction of the dodo is 1662, but some possible sightings had been made as late as 1688. The last sighting with a description was in 1662, but a statistical analysis by Roberts and Solow found that the extinction of the dodo was in 1693. The Rodrigues solitaire was killed off later than the dodo. The IUCN uses an extinction date of 1778 for the solitaire, although a more probable date {{would be in the}} 1750s or 1760s. Both birds became extinct as a consequence of human hunting and the introduction of mammals that <b>ate</b> <b>the</b> birds and their eggs.|$|E

5|$|Greenway {{suggested}} {{that both the}} French settlers and their slaves <b>ate</b> <b>the</b> Guadeloupe amazon, as well as destroying its habitat. The supposedly related imperial amazon survives in the steep mountain forests of Dominica, whereas Guadeloupe is less mountainous and more suitable for farming, and has a larger population of humans. Because of this, {{there would have been}} a greater pressure on the Guadeloupe amazon, and it appears to have become extinct by the end of the 18th century. The amazons still surviving on the West Indian islands are all endangered since they are trapped for the pet-trade, overhunted for food, and because of destruction of their habitat.|$|E
5|$|The Wiyot {{tribe of}} California {{say that the}} condor recreated mankind after Above Old Man wiped {{humanity}} out with a flood. However, other tribes, such as California's Mono, viewed the condor as a destroyer, not a creator. They say that Condor seized humans, cut off their heads, and drained their blood {{so that it would}} flood Ground Squirrel's home. Condor then seized Ground Squirrel after he fled, but Ground Squirrel managed to cut off Condor's head when Condor paused to take a drink of the blood. According to the Yokut tribe, the condor sometimes <b>ate</b> <b>the</b> moon, causing the lunar cycle, and his wings caused eclipses. The Chumash tribe of Southern California believed that the condor was once a white bird, but it turned black when it flew too close to a fire.|$|E
5|$|A {{different}} {{version of}} this tale narrates that when the youngest daughter-in-law was pregnant, she secretly <b>ate</b> <b>the</b> food-offerings ritually dedicated to Shashthi and then blamed the theft on the black cat. Angered by the dishonour of its mistress and the unjust accusation of theft, the cat pledged to teach the young mother a lesson. In {{this version of the}} tale, the cat not only stole her six children, but also ate them. But when the seventh child was born, the mother caught the cat fleeing with her child and followed it but tripped in middle of the chase and fainted. The cat took the infant to Shashthi's abode, where she told the goddess the whole tale of her insult. The benign goddess, however, was annoyed with the cat and rushed to the aid of the mother. The goddess explained the reason of her suffering, and after the mother had begged the cat for forgiveness and had sworn to worship Shashthi on anointed days, all seven of her children were returned to her.|$|E

5|$|Other mammals can be destructive. Possums {{tend not}} to <b>eat</b> <b>the</b> leaves of the tree, but are very fond of <b>eating</b> <b>the</b> sugar-rich {{flowering}} stalks as they emerge. They also like using the tree as a sleeping place. Rabbits can be more destructive, especially during periods of drought, when they have been seen to <b>eat</b> through <b>the</b> base until a tree falls, and then <b>eating</b> <b>the</b> fallen tree completely. Horses can also fell a tree by <b>eating</b> through <b>the</b> trunk.|$|R
50|$|Eucalyptus saligna regenerates by regrowing from epicormic buds on {{the trunk}} and lower {{branches}} after bushfire. Trees live for over two hundred years. The grey-headed flying fox (Pteropus poliocephalus) <b>eats</b> <b>the</b> flowers, the koala (Phascalarctos cinereus) <b>eats</b> <b>the</b> leaves, and crimson rosella (Platycercus elegans) <b>eats</b> <b>the</b> seed. The longhorn beetle species Paroplites australis, Agrianome spinicollis and Tessaromma undatum have been recorded from the Sydney blue gum.|$|R
5|$|Courville and Percy {{decided to}} test Tarrare's {{capacity}} for food. A meal {{had been prepared}} for 15 labourers near the hospital gates; although generally hospital staff restrained Tarrare {{in the presence of}} food, on this occasion Courville allowed him to reach the table undisturbed. Tarrare <b>ate</b> <b>the</b> entire meal of two large meat pies, plates of grease and salt and four gallons of milk, and then immediately fell asleep; Courville noted that Tarrare's belly became taut and inflated like a large balloon. On another occasion Tarrare was presented with a live cat. He tore the cat's abdomen open with his teeth and drank its blood, and proceeded to eat the entire cat aside from its bones, before vomiting up its fur and skin. Following this, hospital staff offered Tarrare a variety of other animals including snakes, lizards and puppies, all of which were eaten; he also swallowed an entire eel without chewing, having first crushed its head with his teeth.|$|E
25|$|People who <b>ate</b> <b>the</b> most subsidized food had a 37% {{higher risk}} of being obese {{compared}} to people who <b>ate</b> <b>the</b> least amount of subsidized food. This brings up the concern that minority communities {{are more prone to}} risks of obesity due to financial limitations. What the government subsidies results in those commodities being cheap to the public, however what is recommended by the dietary guidelines are foods that are made unaffordable.|$|E
25|$|Cannibalism {{has also}} been implicated as a {{transmission}} mechanism for abnormal prions, causing the disease known as kuru, once found primarily among women and children of the Fore people in Papua New Guinea. While {{the men of the}} tribe <b>ate</b> <b>the</b> body of the deceased and rarely contracted the disease, the women and children, who <b>ate</b> <b>the</b> less desirable body parts, including the brain, were eight times {{more likely than men to}} contract kuru from infected tissue.|$|E
