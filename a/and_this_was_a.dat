5|$|Meyerbeer's costly operas, {{requiring}} grand casts {{of leading}} singers, were gradually {{dropped from the}} repertoire in the early 20th century. They were banned in Germany from 1933, and subsequently in subject countries, by the Nazi regime because the composer was Jewish, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> major factor in their further disappearance from the repertory.|$|E
5|$|Also, {{the absence}} of starchy {{historical}} content in Robert doubtless {{played a part in}} attracting the bourgeoisie to the opera, until then regarded as primarily an aristocratic entertainment. The success of the opera also justified the government's policy of 'privatization' in selling the management to Véron, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> landmark in the dilution of state control and patronage in the fine arts. Although Véron had not commissioned it (having taken control only after the Revolution), Robert was his first new production as manager of the Opéra, and its success underwrote his policy of commissioning similar works. These were to include Meyerbeer's Les Huguenots, Fromental Halévy's La Juive, and Daniel Auber's Gustave III. However, while they used 'the same dazzling theatrical rhetoric' as Robert, they led to 'uniformly horrific dénouements' with 'gripping moral urgency', their more sophisticated plot-lines reflecting the changes in taste of the new opera clientele.

5|$|The Polish {{mathematician}} Stanislaw Ulam, {{his wife}} Francoise Ulam, who performed the calculations, and their collaborator, Cornelius Everett, {{worked on the}} Super design through 1949. There was no push from the military for the weapon, because the AEC regarded it as too secret to inform either its own Military Liaison Committee or the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project about it. In September 1949, the Soviet Union detonated a nuclear device. It fell to Oppenheimer, {{as chairman of the}} AEC General Advisory Committee (GAC), to decide whether the United States should develop the Super in response. The Super design used large quantities of tritium, which could only be manufactured in a reactor, and therefore at the expense of plutonium production for smaller weapons, so the GAC advised against it. Nonetheless, Truman approved the Super on January 31, 1950. Because of the secrecy surrounding the decision, accounts published in the 1950s incorrectly portrayed Oppenheimer as obstructing its development on political grounds, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> factor in the Oppenheimer security hearing in 1954.|$|E

25|$|Such crackdowns {{related to}} many people's {{dissatisfaction with the}} church in pre-revolutionary Russia.

25|$|Although the Scandinavians became {{nominally}} Christian, it took considerably {{longer for}} actual Christian beliefs to establish themselves among the people. The old indigenous traditions that had provided security and structure were challenged by ideas that were unfamiliar, such as original sin, the Incarnation, and the Trinity. Archaeological excavations of burial {{sites on the}} island of Lovön near modern-day Stockholm have shown that the actual Christianization of the people was very slow and took at least 150–200 years, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> very central location in the Swedish kingdom. Thirteenth-century runic inscriptions from the merchant town of Bergen in Norway show little Christian influence, and one of them appeals to a Valkyrie.|$|E
25|$|Since it {{was closer}} and {{slightly}} cheaper than Six Flags Great Adventure, Action Park attracted many visitors from urban enclaves of the New York metropolitan area.

25|$|The {{end of the}} Cold War {{presented}} an opportunity to reshape the international system. This opportunity was afforded to the Cold War's victor's-- that is to say—the United States and other western capitalist states governed by liberal-democratic values that put a premium on basic human rights and democratization. In the preceding decades the state was the only entity to receive special status. While there were exceptions, such as groups struggling against colonial powers, the state possessed the ultimate degree of legitimacy. As a result, the international community rarely meddled with the internal machinations of a given country. Sovereignty {{was not to be}} violated <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> system which benefited both superpowers, their allies, as well as third world governments.|$|E

25|$|The {{situation}} was desperate in January 1574 with Middelburg still besieged, the Duke of Alba was recalled by the Spanish king {{and was replaced}} by Don Luis de Requesens. De Requesens ordered the relief of Middelburg and he assembled a fleet of seventy ships under Julian Romero at Bergen op Zoom in addition from Antwerp, Sancho d'Avila with a hundred ships would join Romero. The operation however was a fiasco; they departed but before they even got to Middelburg they were set upon by the Sea Beggars who boarded all sides of the ships. Not one ship managed to make it to Middelburg <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> huge blow to the Spanish.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{difference}} between the form of Anglo-Cornish spoken in west Cornwall and that found in areas further east. In the eastern areas, the form of English that the formerly Cornish-speaking population learnt was the general south-western dialect, picked up primarily through relatively local trade and other communications {{over a long period of}} time. In contrast, in western areas, the language was learned from English as used by the clergy and landed classes, some of whom had been educated at the English universities of Oxford and Cambridge. English was learned relatively late across the western half of Cornwall (see map above) <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> more Modern English style of language, since the standard form itself was undergoing changes. Particularly in the west, the Cornish language substrate left characteristic markers in the Anglo-Cornish dialect.|$|E
25|$|This {{success was}} {{tempered}} by a difficult {{period in the}} mid 80s after Grappelli suffered a heart attack. Although he made a full recovery, it was some time before he could tour again. Taylor {{found it difficult to}} replace the Grappelli gig with other work, and fell into a period of financial hardship, selling his guitars to survive. He became disenchanted with music, and virtually didn't touch guitar for almost a year. He finally agreed on a price for his one remaining guitar, a gift from mentor Isaacs, but, on the way to close the deal he pulled his car over to allow himself a final play of the instrument and suddenly found his passion for playing re-ignited. He called off the deal, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> catalyst in the next stage of his career.|$|E

Citing the pressure this would have put on signal staff to maintain the service, it also argued that the local train would not have even been on the main line if the passing loops had not been being used as storage sidings to store extra trains. It also criticised the railway company and the government for using the older wooden stock for the troop train, arguing that it was already known it was unsafe {{and in the process}} of withdrawal, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> risk that was not justified even in the environment of war.|$|E
25|$|Howard started {{circulating}} {{the story}} that his corps' failure had actually been triggered {{by the collapse of}} Maj. Gen. Abner Doubleday's I Corps to the west, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> partial reason for Doubleday's removal from command of the corps. However, this excuse was not accepted by history—the reverse was actually true—and the reputation of the XI Corps was ruined. Some argue that Howard should get some credit for the eventual success at Gettysburg because he wisely stationed one of his divisions (Maj. Gen. Adolph von Steinwehr's) on Cemetery Hill as a reserve and critical subsequent defensive line. For the remainder of the three-day battle, the corps remained on the defensive around Cemetery Hill, withstanding assaults by Maj. Gen. Jubal Early on July 2 and participating at the margin of the defense against Pickett's Charge on July 3. Also at Gettysburg, Howard's younger brother, Major Charles Henry Howard, served as his aide-de-camp.|$|E
25|$|If all looting is wrong, as {{in theory}} it is, {{then they have}} been to blame: {{but there are times}} when the laws of nature assert {{themselves}} over the laws of civilization, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> case in point.

Had they come to me and said, 'Give us money and food,' I could only have replied in the negative, or, at all events, to the effect that I could not feed their converts, and so they took the law into their own hands. It has been a case of poetical or primitive justice. But, granted that this sort of justice was admissible, I do not admit that the missionaries abused it. I have not heard of a single instance of a missionary looting for any purpose other than that of feeding themselves and their converts who were dependent on them.|$|E
