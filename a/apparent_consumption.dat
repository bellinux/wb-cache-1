50|$|Aside from {{calculating the}} net {{additions}} to stock (NAS) as a balancing item, flows within the economy {{are not considered}} (advances are currently being made {{in the field of}} dynamic stock modelling). MFA covers all solid, gaseous, and liquid materials, mobilized by humans or by their livestock, with the exception of bulk water and air. The unit of measurement is most commonly (metric) tonnes per year (t/a). Flows are distinguished by whether they are extracted domestically (domestic extraction, DE) or are trade flows (imports or exports). Materials are most commonly grouped according to four main material categories: biomass, fossil energy carriers, metals, and non-metallic minerals. The former category may be further differentiated by type of use into industrial and construction minerals. It is very important to note that MFA seeks to provide a complete picture of an economy’s material use so that materials are included in these accounts irrespective of whether or not they have direct market value. The most prominent non-market flows covered by MFA are grazed biomass and used crop residues as well as waste rock extracted during mining activities. In 2010, these material flows accounted for 21% of global extraction.The data collected in MFA is used to calculate several different standardized indicators:Direct Material Input (DMI) {{is a measure of the}} total material inputs into an economy and is calculated as the sum of domestic extraction (DE) and imports.The Physical Trade Balance (PTB) is a measure of net-imports and is calculated as the difference between imports and exports. Reflecting that material and money flow in opposite directions during trade, this is a contrast to the monetary trade balance which calculates net-exports.Domestic Material Consumption (DMC) is a measure of <b>apparent</b> <b>consumption</b> and calculated from domestic extraction plus imports minus exports (or DE plus PTB).Economy-wide MFA is a satellite system to the system of national accounts and provides a rich empirical database for analytical studies. More information on how the statistics are collected, under what legal framework and how they are defined is available on Economy-wide material flow accounts.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{rise in the}} {{prevalence}} of obesity, diabetes, and other risk factors for cardiovascular diseases and cancer observed in Chile over the past decades {{may be related to}} changes in dietary patterns of the population. Aim: To report changes in household <b>apparent</b> food-nutrients <b>consumption</b> (HAFNC) for Metropolitan Santiago-Chile 1988 - 97. Material and Methods: The analysis is based on data from household expenditure surveys conducted by the Instituto Nacional de Estadísticas (INE) on a representative sample of the population to define changes in food prices. Information on food and drink purchases were grouped by specific items and expen-ditures standardized across the two surveys. HAFNC was determined based on unit consumed at home and out of home by the total group and by income quintile using national food composition tables. Results: <b>Apparent</b> energy <b>consumption</b> increased over the study period by 25 %, this was mainly explained by increased consumption of meat and dairy (rich in saturated fats of animal origin) and of processed foods (fat spreads, sweets and pastries) and foods rich in added sugars (sugary drinks and juices). Dietary fiber derived from whole grains, legumes and cereals decreased. The HAFNC of items protective against nutrition related chronic diseases, such as vegetables, fruits and other fiber rich foods remained stable or frankly decreased (legumes and non-starchy vegetables) Fish and other marine foods rich in omega- 3 fats remained low. Conclusions: The changes in <b>apparent</b> food <b>consumption</b> patterns can be characterized by an increase in energy dense, fat and sugar rich foods with a low consumption of fi sh, whole grains, legumes, vegetables and fruits...|$|R

The scheme would destroy the distinctive charm of Thirlmere which was 'entirely free from modern erections out of harmony with the surroundings', raising the level would destroy the many small bays which gave the west shore its character, the 'picturesque windings' of the existing road {{on the east side}} were {{to be replaced by a}} dead level road, at the northern end 'one of the sweetest glens in Cumberland' was to be the site of an enormous embankment. Worst of all, in a dry season, the lake would be drawn down to its old level, exposing over three hundred acres of 'oozy mud and rotting vegetation'. [...] "Few persons, whose taste is not utterly uneducated, are likely to share the confidence of the water committee in their power to enhance the loveliness of such a scene, or will think that the boldest devices of engineering skill will be other than a miserable substitute for the natural beauties they displace." [...] Furthermore, the scheme was unnecessary: Manchester already had an ample supply of water; its <b>apparent</b> <b>consumption</b> was so high because it was selling water to industrial users, and to areas outside Manchester [...] and Manchester sought to increase such sales because they were profitable. [...] Manchester could easily get more (and of a superior quality) from wells tapping the New Red Sandstone aquifer; if they were still unsatisfied there were vast untouched collecting grounds in the moorlands of Lancashire. There was also a more general point; the Thirlmere scheme if approved would set a precedent for municipalities to buy up whole valleys in the Lake District, leaving them at the mercy of [...] "bodies of men, skilful and diligent enough in managing local affairs, but having little capacity to appreciate the importance of subjects beyond their daily sphere of action" [...] with painful consequences for their natural beauty.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{serves to}} fill a gap in the {{existing}} literature by mapping the current seafood supply flows from various sources (local, U. S. domestic, and foreign) in Hawai‘i. Not since the earlier works of Hudgins (1980) and SMS Research (1983), have we seen any attempts to update estimates on the <b>apparent</b> <b>consumption</b> of seafood in Hawai‘i. We estimated the <b>apparent</b> <b>consumption</b> of seafood in Hawai‘i from all commercial sources at an annual average of 29 edible pounds per capita in the 10 -year period from 2000 to 2009. When non-commercial catch is included, the <b>apparent</b> <b>consumption</b> of seafood in Hawai‘i increases to an estimated annual average of 37 edible pounds per capita for the same time period. These results suggest non-commercial fishing is an important source of seafood supply in Hawai‘i. Overall, fresh tuna is the single largest consumed species, followed by salmon. The top species caught from non-commercial fishing are the yellowfin tuna and mahimahi. When measured in edible weight, the majority of Hawai‘i’s commercial seafood supply comes from foreign sources (57 percent) versus local (37 percent) and U. S. domesti...|$|E
