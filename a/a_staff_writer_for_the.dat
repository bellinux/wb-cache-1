25|$|Sandi Bacaloglu {{carried on}} a LANC activist and then joined the {{successor}} National Christian Party, serving {{as one of its}} Bucharest leaders in 1937. In this capacity, he also led street battles with a more minor LANC splinter group, the Fire Swastika. By then, Elena's son by Densusianu was also entering public life. Educated in Italy and Romania, Ovid Jr trained as a schoolteacher and then became a press officer at the Interior Ministry. He also had prospects of becoming a writer, and is especially remembered for a 1937 novel, Stăpânul ("The Master"). He adhered to his mother and uncle's fascist ideology: he was <b>a</b> <b>staff</b> <b>writer</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Iron Guard paper Porunca Vremii, translated the political essays of Mussolini and Antonio Beltramelli, and campaigned in support of Italy during the Ethiopian War. In May 1936, he helped Mihail Manoilescu establish the local network of Fascist Action Committees (CAUR).|$|E
500|$|Series creator Chris Carter {{claimed to}} have been {{inspired}} to write the episode based on three incidents; his dog having worms, his readings about Chernobyl, and the extinction of species during the 1990s. The Flukeman character was portrayed by Darin Morgan, brother of executive producer Glen Morgan. Darin Morgan would become <b>a</b> <b>staff</b> <b>writer</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> show later in the second season. In addition, [...] "The Host" [...] also introduced the character of X, the successor of Mulder's former Syndicate informant Deep Throat.|$|E
500|$|Both Margaret Salinger and Maynard {{characterized}} the author as a devoted film buff. According to Margaret, his favorite movies include Gigi (1958), The Lady Vanishes (1938), The 39 Steps (1935; Phoebe's favorite movie in The Catcher in the Rye), and the comedies of W.C. Fields, Laurel and Hardy, and the Marx Bros.. Predating VCRs, Salinger had an extensive collection of classic movies from the 1940s in 16mm prints. Maynard wrote that [...] "he loves movies, not films", and Salinger argued that her father's [...] "worldview is, essentially, {{a product of}} the movies of his day. To my father, all Spanish speakers are Puerto Rican washerwomen, or the toothless, grinning-gypsy types in a Marx Brothers movie". Lillian Ross, <b>a</b> <b>staff</b> <b>writer</b> <b>for</b> <b>The</b> New Yorker and longtime friend of Salinger's, wrote following his death, [...] "Salinger loved movies, and he was more fun than anyone to discuss them with. He enjoyed watching actors work, and he enjoyed knowing them. (He loved Anne Bancroft, hated Audrey Hepburn, and said that he had seen Grand Illusion ten times.)" ...|$|E

500|$|The writers later {{noted that}} the episode divided fans. Essentially, those who loved it were those who {{realized}} that the writing was intentionally bad {{as a way of}} parodying bad television writing, while others who did not understand this distinction were less enthusiastic. Matt Groening feared that the fans would interpret the episode in a negative light and was uneasy about the episode when it was in production. He later {{went on to say that}} the episode [...] "turned out great". The writers of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood called it, [...] "A very clever spin on the alternates offered by the Treehouse of Horrors run. Each of the spin-offs is very clever in its own way." [...] It has also appeared as one of the favorite episodes on a number of [...] "best of" [...] lists. Entertainment Weekly placed the episode 19th in their top 25 Simpsons episode list. In an interview for Star-News, The Simpsons writer Don Payne revealed that the episode was in his personal top six of the best The Simpsons episodes. Additionally, Gary Mullinax, <b>a</b> <b>staff</b> <b>writer</b> <b>for</b> <b>The</b> News Journal, picked the episode as part of his top-ten list.|$|E
500|$|After Fox {{picked up}} the show, it {{acquired}} the working title Chasing Zebras, Circling the Drain ("zebra" [...] is medical slang for an unusual or obscure diagnosis, while [...] "circling the drain" [...] refers to terminal cases, patients in an irreversible decline). The original premise of the show was {{of a team of}} doctors working together trying to [...] "diagnose the undiagnosable". Shore felt it was important to have an interesting central character, one who could examine patients' personal characteristics and diagnose their ailments by figuring out their secrets and lies. As Shore {{and the rest of the}} creative team explored the character's possibilities, the program concept became less of procedure and more focused upon the lead role. The character was named [...] "House", which was adopted as the show's title, as well. Shore developed the characters further and wrote the script for the pilot episode. Bryan Singer, who directed the pilot episode and had a major role in casting the primary roles, has said that the [...] "title of the pilot was 'Everybody Lies', and that's the premise of the show". Shore has said that the central storylines of several early episodes were based on the work of Berton Roueché, <b>a</b> <b>staff</b> <b>writer</b> <b>for</b> <b>The</b> New Yorker between 1944 and 1994, who specialized in features about unusual medical cases.|$|E
500|$|The Flukeman—also known affectionately as [...] "Flukey" [...] by {{the cast}} and crew—was portrayed by Darin Morgan, brother of {{executive}} producer Glen Morgan. He would become <b>a</b> <b>staff</b> <b>writer</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> show later in the second season. The Flukeman suit used by Morgan, which included flipper-like feet, yellow contact lenses, and fake teeth, took six hours to put on; this process was eventually sped up. Morgan wore the suit as much as 20 consecutive hours during shooting. As a result, {{he was forced to}} go to the bathroom while still wearing the suit. Morgan was rarely on set without being in full costume, and recalled that when he met up with David Duchovny again upon joining the series' writing staff, the actor had no idea who he was, despite having enjoyed an amiable relationship with the costumed Morgan previously. The suit dissolved in water, forcing special effects artist Toby Lindala to reconstruct the suit each day. Because the suit did not permit Morgan to breathe through his nose, he was unable to eat while wearing it. Carter described the character as [...] "the embodiment of everyone's sense of vulnerability, the idea of something that exists in the underworld of the sewer system and might in fact come to bite you in the least elegant of places". The original intention was showing even less of the Flukeman, but some angles and lighting ended up revealing more of the creature's design. Carter still felt it helped to [...] "get more creepy", as the Flukeman is not shown fully until the final scenes.|$|E

2500|$|... dril tweets often riff on his {{relationships}} with family members—particularly an unnamed wife, ex-wife, and multiple sons—in a manner reminiscent of father figures in American sitcoms like Married… With Children. Jia Tolentino, <b>a</b> <b>staff</b> <b>writer</b> <b>for</b> <b>The</b> New Yorker, credited dril as an originator of the [...] "large adult son" [...] trope. The trope, which Tolentino noted is common {{on social media}} and online sports journalism, involves particular observations of hapless male behavior that is [...] "endlessly excusable: though [...] does nothing right, he can do no wrong." [...] The character of dril repeatedly refers to his [...] "sons," [...] who are usually involved {{in the kind of}} [...] "classic large-adult-son behavior" [...] Tolentino describes as [...] "alarming, with a whiff of the surreal." [...] The sons are compared to Trump's sons, particularly Eric Trump and Donald Jr., and Mike Huckabee's sons, David and John Mark.|$|E
