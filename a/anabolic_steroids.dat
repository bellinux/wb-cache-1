5|$|On September 11, 2009, Hardy {{was arrested}} on charges of {{trafficking}} in controlled prescription pills and possession of <b>anabolic</b> <b>steroids,</b> after a search of his house yielded 262 Vicodin prescription pills, 180 Soma prescription pills, 555 milliliters of <b>anabolic</b> <b>steroids,</b> a residual amount of powder cocaine, and drug paraphernalia. Over a year later, the district attorney announced that Hardy would plead guilty to the charges. On September 8, 2011, Hardy was sentenced to ten days in jail, 30 months of probation, and a fine of $100,000. Hardy served his jail sentence from October 3 to 13, 2011.|$|E

40|$|Aims: The aim of {{the paper}} was to {{identify}} changes in the extent and patterns of <b>anabolic</b> <b>steroid</b> use in the United Kingdom {{to better understand the}} public health implications {{within the context of the}} current health-related evidence base. Methods: Using the two time points of 1995 (prior to legislation changes in the United Kingdom) and 2015, a review of the evidence related to health harms was conducted, in conjunction with needle and syringe programme (NSP) data in Cheshire & Merseyside (UK) relating to <b>anabolic</b> <b>steroid</b> users. Findings: Dramatic increases in the numbers of <b>anabolic</b> <b>steroid</b> users accessing NSPs, 553 in 1995 to 2446 in 2015, now accounting for 54. 9 % of clients. With the inclusion of pharmacy NSPs, this rose to 5336 individual <b>anabolic</b> <b>steroid</b> users. Conclusions: Key changes in our knowledge during the 20 years, in particular in relation to HIV prevalence, changes in the market and patterns of use make <b>anabolic</b> <b>steroid</b> use a public health concern. In the context of increasing numbers of injectors, there is a need for comprehensive interventions...|$|R
5|$|Doping {{has played}} a {{significant}} part in the modern history of track and field. State-sponsored doping in East Germany with hormones and <b>anabolic</b> <b>steroids</b> marked the rise of women from the German Democratic Republic {{in track and field}} from the late 1960s to the 1980s. A number of these women, such as Marita Koch, broke world records and were highly successful at international competitions. Some athletes, who were following a doping plan from their teenage years, suffered significant health problems {{as a result of the}} regime. Ben Johnson ran a new world record in the 100metres at the 1988 Seoul Olympics but was later banned for using <b>anabolic</b> <b>steroids.</b> In the mid-first decade of the 21st century, the BALCO Scandal eventually resulted in the downfall of prominent sprinters such as Marion Jones and Tim Montgomery, among others, through their usage of banned substances. Doping problems have also been associated with sprinters such as Tyson Gay, Michael Rogers, and Justin Gatlin, all from the United States. Doping has also affected entire nations, such as Russia, which has been banned from competing at both the Indoor World Championships and the Olympics in 2016. This ban was imposed in 2016 after major allegations of doping and covering up were discovered in 2015.|$|E
5|$|Medical {{conditions}} that commonly cause a high-androgen state, such as polycystic ovary syndrome, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and androgen-secreting tumors, can cause acne in affected individuals. Conversely, people who lack androgenic hormones or are {{insensitive to the}} effects of androgens rarely have acne. An increase in androgen and oily sebum synthesis can be seen during pregnancy. Acne can be a side effect of testosterone replacement therapy or of anabolic steroid use. Over-the-counter bodybuilding and dietary supplements are commonly found to contain illegally added <b>anabolic</b> <b>steroids.</b>|$|E

For example, use of <b>anabolic</b> <b>steroids</b> by bodybuilders and other athletes {{can result in}} significant enlargement of the clitoris in concert with other masculinizing effects on their bodies. Abnormal enlargement of the clitoris may also {{be referred to as}} clitoromegaly, but clitoromegaly is more commonly seen as a congenital anomaly of the genitalia.|$|E

40|$|Social capital: {{implications}} from {{an investigation}} of illegal <b>anabolic</b> <b>steroid</b> networks Numerous studies have linked the constructs of social capital with behaviours that are health enhancing. The factors of social trust, social cohesion, sense of belonging, civic involvement, volunteer activity, social engagement and social reciprocity are all associated with social capital and their existence is often linked with communities or settings where health enhancement is high. Utilizing an interpretive perspective, this paper demonstrates how the existence of social capital may enhance the transition into drug use, the experience of using an illegal drug and decrease the risk of detection. It highlights how social capital may contribute to behaviours which are not health enhancing. Using a variety of data, including participant observation of 147 male <b>anabolic</b> <b>steroid</b> users and 98 semi-structured in-depth interviews with male <b>anabolic</b> <b>steroid</b> users, dealers and distributors {{it was found that}} social capital facilitated the operation of the illegal <b>anabolic</b> <b>steroid</b> distribution network. The subcultural norms and social trust that existed within the network allowed <b>anabolic</b> <b>steroid</b> dealers to sell the drug to others with reduced risk of detection. It is argued that socia...|$|R
5|$|In 2003, Bonds {{first became}} {{embroiled in a}} scandal when Greg Anderson of the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative (BALCO), Bonds's trainer since 2000, was indicted by {{a federal grand jury}} in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and charged with {{supplying}} <b>anabolic</b> <b>steroids</b> to athletes, including a number of baseball players. This led to speculation that Bonds had used performance-enhancing drugs during a time when there was no mandatory testing in Major League Baseball. Bonds declared his innocence, attributing his changed physique and increased power to a strict regimen of bodybuilding, diet, and legitimate supplements.|$|E
5|$|Track {{and field}} athletes are banned from ingesting or using certain {{substances}} by governing bodies for the sport, {{from the national}} to the international level. The IAAF's constitution incorporates the World Anti-Doping Code among other anti-doping measures. Practices such as blood doping {{and the use of}} <b>anabolic</b> <b>steroids,</b> peptide hormones, stimulants, or diuretics can give athletes a physical competitive advantage in track and field. The use of such substances in track and field is opposed on both ethical and medical grounds. Given that the sport functions by measuring and comparing athletes' performances, performance-enhancing substances create an uneven playing field — athletes who do not use doping substances have a disadvantage over rivals who do. Medically, the use of banned substances may have an adverse effect upon athletes' health. However, some exemptions are made for athletes who take banned substances for therapeutic use, and athletes are not sanctioned for usage in these cases, such as Kim Collins' failed drug test due to asthma medication.|$|E
