500|$|On 26 January 2009, Rehman {{signed a}} loan deal with League Two club Bradford City, {{which was to}} last {{until the end of}} the 2008–09 season. Rehman had turned down a chance to move to Luton Town and team up with Mick Harford, who was {{previously}} the assistant manager at QPR, and said he was only prepared to drop down to League Two if he joined Bradford City. Rehman said of the move, [...] "I was only prepared to drop down the leagues to play for this club. I spoke to the manager and chairmen <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> want to get Bradford back up to where they belong. I've been involved in relegation battles in the past and it's nice to be joining a club pushing for promotion – that's a good pressure to have." [...] He made his debut the following day in a 1–0 defeat to Bury at Gigg Lane, and in doing so became the first British Asian to play in all four divisions of professional football in England. He made his home debut on 31 January, playing at right back, in a 2–0 home win over Grimsby Town at Valley Parade. In March he turned down the chance to play for Pakistan in the Asian Football Confederation Challenge Cup qualifiers in order to help Bradford's push for promotion.|$|E
2500|$|Invalid Channel said, [...] "Bajo and Hex are hilarious to watch, {{they have}} so many funny moments. You can tell they know their shit, too, they've been around the block {{when it comes to}} games and they use {{terminology}} without it sounding super lame and out of place. At the same time, they make it easy for non-gamers, or people who wish they were gamers (ie: me) to understand. Bits and pieces feel really awkward though, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> put in awkward moments for comedic effect sometimes, but I find that these don't always have the comedic effect that they're probably going for, and end up going full circle just being plain awkward". It argues the [...] "small size and down-to-earth-ness" [...] of the show adds to its charm, by saying [...] "a commercial version of the show would be way too polished and just wouldn't feel right". It ended its review by saying [...] "all in all, Good Game is a good show [...] the reviews are quite good". While it thought there was room for improvement, it said [...] "the show's got it's [...] niche and it should stick to it".|$|E

6000|$|... 'Have {{you nothing}} to say?' she continued. 'Your {{footsteps}} were audible {{to me from}} the very bottom, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> were yours. You look almost restored.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dears," [...] said Aunt Viney placidly, [...] "Mrs. Amador <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{have always}} nodded to each other, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> were only {{waiting for the}} {{slightest}} encouragement. <b>I</b> gave it, <b>and</b> they're coming." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will never}} see them again--they are destroyed. They came from Satan. I saw the hell-brand on them, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> were sent to betray me to sin." [...] Then he fell to gabbling strange and dreadful things which were not clearly understandable, and which the doctor admonished them to keep to themselves.|$|R
6000|$|... "And they won, you said? The world's judgment! I {{have told}} you, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know.</b> <b>They</b> won {{as you are}} winning, here in your hills." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have never}} seen a railroad," [...] said Amita, {{slightly}} coloring; [...] "but you are an engineer, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> must be some thing very clever." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "These hopes uphold me, my dear Esther, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> will. Though {{sometimes}} even they depart from me before a dread that arises when I look at Richard." ...|$|E
60|$|We had {{of course}} joined {{the crowd in}} pushing forward; people always do, though they promise {{themselves}} to wait till the last one is out. I got caught in a dark eddy on the first stair-landing; but I could see them farther down, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> would wait for me outside the door.|$|R
6000|$|... "About {{ten o'clock}} the silver dollars {{dropping}} {{on the bar}} slowed down to playing two-steps and marches instead of jigs. But I {{looked out the window}} and saw a hundred or two of our customers standing in line at Bird City Savings and Loan Co., <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> were borrowing more money to be sucked in by the clammy tendrils of the octopus.|$|R
2500|$|... "I {{was shocked}} and sad", Thomas {{recalled}} in the Chicago Tribune. [...] "I {{saw a lot of}} guys I played against get drafted, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> couldn't do what I could do. But I've had people all my life saying you can't do this, you can't do that. It scars you. No matter how well I've done. People have misunderstood me for some reason. I was always one of the most competitive kids around." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll take my chances!" [...] {{returned}} Uncle Barney. [...] "I've {{got those}} deeds, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> are all O. K. Now, you clear out--and don't you dare {{to come here}} again!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "None hath {{taught me}} any lesson, madam. I {{know what my}} mother's enemies have, as they say, proved against her, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> say that while she lives your Grace cannot be in security." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your word is sufficient, Mr. Pendennis," [...] {{the other}} {{said in his}} sad tone. [...] "You {{say they are not}} here, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> are not. And I hope they never have been here, and never will come." ...|$|E
5000|$|In the semi-finals The Zimmers again {{performed}} a pop song; LMFAO's [...] "Sexy <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>Know</b> It". <b>They</b> {{made it to}} the top three.|$|R
6000|$|... "By their {{manner of}} saluting me. I have been these seven years under their direction, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> who <b>they</b> were because they told me." ...|$|R
60|$|MRS MARCH. Excuse me, Johnny. I worked {{three years}} among factory girls, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> how <b>they</b> manage to resist things when they've got stuff in them.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do {{you think}} they will not?' said Phoebe, with slower and graver steps. 'Do you really think so? But no! It can't lead to coming out; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> like me to be happy when it interferes with nobody.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What do {{you think}} of {{continuing}} your recitals of travel?" [...] Walkirk said to me later in the day. [...] "I should think they would interest you, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> were vastly interesting to me. You must have a great deal more to tell." ...|$|E
60|$|These, my worthy friend, are my ideas; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> are not far {{different}} from yours. It becomes a man of sense to think for himself, particularly in a case where all men are equally interested, and where, indeed, all men are equally in the dark.|$|E
6000|$|... '1. I will persuade Mansoul {{to receive}} thee for their Lord; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that <b>they</b> {{will do it}} the sooner when they shall {{understand}} that I am thy deputy.|$|R
5000|$|Today I {{will tell}} you about a time when I was living {{in a small town in}} India with a {{population}} of about 25,000. I had been posted in the (government) service there for four or five years, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> asked my Master to come to that town to give a satsang. <b>I</b> was well <b>known</b> in that area <b>and,</b> although <b>I</b> was the only initiate of my Master, I had some influence with the many aspirants and seekers after truth, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> would come to listen to him...|$|R
5000|$|He {{joined the}} Klan {{when he was}} 18. His reason for joining the {{organization}} was {{because he did not}} believe in mixing the races, particularly in marriage. Griffin claimed that the African-American customers he served at the gas station would ask for his services personally despite their awareness of his KKK membership: “As much as I’m on TV, I’m sure everyone of them <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> was in the Klan. <b>They</b> <b>knew</b> what <b>I</b> was. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> was in the N.A.A.C.P. What they do is their business.” ...|$|R
60|$|I {{have never}} had {{anything}} to do with duels since. I thoroughly disapprove of duels. I consider them unwise, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> are dangerous. Also, sinful. If a man should challenge me now, I would go to that man and take him kindly and forgivingly by the hand and lead him to a quiet retired spot, and kill him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{worry about}} me," [...] replied Sammy [...] "I {{know just how}} far those terrible guns can shoot, and I don't take any chances. By the way, Lightfoot, the Green Forest is full of hunters looking for you. I've {{seen a lot of}} them, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> are looking for you because they do not shoot at anybody else even when they have a chance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What new {{nonsense}} is this?" [...] cried Vane. [...] "I know there's {{some crazy}} yarn about the trees spreading fever, though every educated man knows why these epidemics return occasionally. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> {{say you can}} tell the noise of them among other trees in a gale, and I dare say you can. But even Cornwall isn't a lunatic asylum, and a tree that dines on a passing tourist--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘I am Medeia, {{daughter}} of Aietes, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> saw my countrymen here to-day; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that <b>they</b> are {{come to find}} me, and take me home to die some dreadful death.’ ...|$|R
60|$|Dominick {{had never}} seen an infant of such heroic calibre. Twice again he {{refilled}} the tumbler, each time to the brim, and watched it disappear down my throat. By this time my exploits were attracting attention. Middle-aged Italian labourers, old-country peasants who did not talk English, and who could not dance with the Irish girls, surrounded me. They were swarthy and wild-looking; they wore belts and red shirts; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> carried knives; <b>and</b> they ringed me around like a pirate chorus. And Peter and Dominick made me show off for them.|$|R
60|$|They changed {{clothes at}} the cottage. I could repeat {{the words in}} my mind, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> what <b>they</b> meant of themselves, but I {{attached}} no meaning to them in any other connexion.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Tis {{the soul}} only," [...] said Isabella. [...] "My sex and {{strength}} have denied me the dearest of privileges. But to you, Captain Lawton, nature {{has been more}} bountiful; you have {{an arm and a}} heart to devote to the cause; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> are in arm and a heart that will prove true to the last. And George--and--" [...] she paused, her lip quivered, and her eye sank to the floor.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No,' said Honora, sadly; 'papa said I was too young, and {{he wished}} I had heard nothing about it. We are {{to go on}} {{as if nothing had}} happened, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> think we shall forget all about it! As if we could! Not that I wish it to be different. I know it would be wicked to desert papa and mamma while she is so unwell. The truth is, Humfrey,' and her voice sank, 'that it cannot be while they live.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Boo!" [...] {{he exclaimed}} contemptuously, [...] "it {{is of no}} use your talking so much. I too {{have been to the}} Whale River, and have seen the fire-spouters, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> are not nearly alive. They are dead-- quite dead. Moreover, they will not spout at all, and are quite useless, unless they are filled with a kind of black sand which is {{supplied}} by the white men who sell the spouters. Go to the Whale River if you will, but don't fight with any one--that is my advice, and my hair is grey." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{have got}} such a {{perfectly}} delightful razor. I have a notion to buy some for Charley, Theodore <b>and</b> Slee--for <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> have no such razors there. I have got a neat little watch-chain for Annie--$20.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And where's the Lord Mayor?' Melmotte, {{in spite}} of royalty, was now sitting with his face turned round upon the hall. 'I know all their places, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> where <b>they</b> were put. Have you seen the Lord Mayor?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Even then I did not understand, till I saw that--that no man {{stepped on}} my shadow; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>they</b> thought {{me to be}} a God, like the God Tyr, who gave his right hand to conquer a Great Beast.' ...|$|R
