5|$|Virginia Tech's offense, led by quarterback Sean Glennon, {{began their}} first {{possession}} <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> 37-yard line. However, a sack, a tackle for loss, and an incomplete pass denied the Hokies' offense positive yardage {{and they were}} forced to punt. Tech punter Brent Bowden managed a 54-yard kick that forced the Eagles to start <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> 14-yard line, but three big plays of 16, 19, and 19yards drove the Eagles deep into Virginia Tech territory. As before, however, Virginia Tech's defense stiffened and Boston College was forced into a fourth down. Instead of attempting a long field goal, the Eagles instead attempted to convert the fourth down but were foiled by an incomplete pass.|$|E
5|$|After the kickoff, Virginia Tech's offense again {{failed to}} advance the ball. After a three-and-out, the Hokies again punted. The ball {{traveled}} 44yards, forcing the Eagles to start <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> 21-yard line. As the quarter came to a close, the Eagles drove the ball deep into Virginia Tech territory.

5|$|On {{the ensuing}} Tech possession, Tech's quarterback {{continued}} to play poorly. On the third play following the kickoff, Glennon was intercepted {{for the fourth time}} in the game. The downfield interception set up Georgia <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> 11-yard line. Georgia rushed the ball three times, forcing Virginia Tech to use twotimeouts in order to stop the clock.

5|$|Virginia Tech won the {{ceremonial}} pre-game coin toss to select first possession and deferred its option {{to the second}} half; Louisville elected to receive the opening kick. The Cardinals began the game's opening drive <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> 18-yard line after the opening kickoff. Running back Michael Bush rushed for 12yards on the game's opening play, netting the game's first first down. Subsequent plays, however, saw Louisville struggle to gain another. Facing fourth down and six yards <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> 34-yard line, the Cardinals seemingly prepared to punt. Instead, the Cardinals executed a trick play by running back Kolby Smith, who ran with the ball. Smith surprised the Tech defense and broke free for a 30-yard run, converting the first down and continuing the Louisville drive. Eight plays later, Louisville quarterback Hunter Cantwell connected on an 11-yard pass to Mario Urrutia for a touchdown and the game's first points. The extra point kick was good, and with 10:42 remaining in the first quarter, Louisville took a 7–0 lead.|$|E

A new wave of Ottoman conquest began in 1521, after which a good portion of Croatia was conquered or pillaged.|$|E
5|$|Appalachian State {{continued}} their drive but {{were forced to}} punt after being stopped on 3rd down. Michigan began their drive at the Appalachian State 34-yard line, but a Henne pass was intercepted by Mountaineer defender Leonard Love on the fourth play of the drive. Love returned the ball 26-yards, and Appalachian State began the drive <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> 41-yard line, but were forced to punt after going three-and-out. Michigan got the ball <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> 24-yard line and mounted a nine-play, 43-yard drive to the Appalachian State 33-yard line. On the final play, a fourth and five, Henne's pass fell incomplete, turning the ball over to Appalachian State, who were again quickly forced to punt. After returning the punt to their own 46-yard line, Hart ran the ball 54yards for a touchdown, giving Michigan the lead 32–31 with 4:36 left. Michigan chose to go for two, but the conversion attempt failed. Edwards was picked off on the first play of the ensuing drive, giving Michigan control of the ball at the Appalachian State 43-yard line. Michigan ran five plays before attempting a 43-yard field goal. The attempt was blocked, however, giving Appalachian State control of the ball with 1:37 left. With no timeouts left, the Mountaineers drove 69yards down the field in just over a minute in game time, setting up a Rauch field goal from 24yards out with 26seconds left. The attempt was good, giving Appalachian State a 34–32 lead. Michigan regained control of {{the ball on the}} ensuing kickoff, and a 46-yard pass from Henne to Mario Manningham gave the Wolverines a 37-yard field goal attempt with six seconds left on the clock. The attempt was blocked by Corey Lynch, securing a 34–32 win by the Mountaineers.|$|E
5|$|Appalachian State {{returned}} the opening kickoff {{of the second}} half to their own 36-yard line, but Michigan defender Morgan Trent intercepted an Edwards throw on the second play of the drive. Michigan took possession at the Appalachian State 40-yard line, driving to the 25-yard line before kicking a field goal to decrease the Mountaineer lead to eight points. Appalachian State began play after the kickoff <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> 24-yard line, driving 64yards in 11 plays and scoring a 31-yard field goal to make the score 31–20 Appalachian State. After the ensuing kickoff, Michigan ran four plays before Minor fumbled the ball on the fifth. The fumble was recovered by Appalachian State defender Pierre Banks at the Michigan 28-yard line. However, Appalachian State failed to get a first down on the ensuing drive, and Rauch missed a 46-yard field goal attempt. Michigan went three-and-out on their next drive and had to punt, but a fumble by Edwards on the following Appalachian State drive was recovered by Michigan defender John Thompson, giving them control of the ball at the Appalachian State 31-yard line. Michigan drove 31yards over six plays, scoring a touchdown on a four-yard run by Hart. The Wolverines went for a two-point conversion, but failed to convert, making the score 31–26 in favor of Appalachian State. Appalachian State received the kickoff <b>at</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> 26-yard line with 19seconds left in the third quarter, and the quarter ended following a six-yard completion by Edwards to Batichon.|$|E
