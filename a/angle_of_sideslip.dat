40|$|An {{investigation}} {{at medium}} to high subsonic speeds {{has been conducted}} in the Langley low-turbulence pressure tunnel to determine the static stability and control characteristics and to measure the fin normal forces and moments for {{a model of a}} wingless fin-controlled missile. The data were obtained at Reynolds number of 2. 1 x 10 (6) based on the missile maximum diameter or 17. 7 x 10 (6) based on missile length; this Reynolds number was found to be large enough to avoid any large scale effects between the test and the expected flight Reynolds number. With the horizontal-fin deflection limited to a maximum of 6 degrees, longitudinally stable and trimmed flight could not be maintained beyond an <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> attack of 17 degrees for a Mach number of 0. 88 and beyond 20 degrees for a Mach number of 0. 50 for any center-of-gravity location without the use of some auxiliary stability or control device such as jet vanes. Mach number had no appreciable effect on the center-of-pressure positions and only a slight effect on neutral-point position. There was a shift in neutral-point position of about 1 caliber as the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> attack was varied through the range for which the neutral point could be determined. Yawing the model to <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>sideslip</b> up to 7 degrees had little effect on the longitudinal stability at <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> attack up to 15 degrees; however, above 15 degrees, the effect <b>of</b> <b>sideslip</b> was destabilizing. With the vertical fins at a plus-or-minus 6 degree roll deflection, the rolling moment caused by yawing the model at high <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> attack could be trimmed out up to <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>sideslip</b> <b>of</b> 6. 5 degrees and an <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> attack of 26 degrees for a Mach number of 0. 50; this range <b>of</b> <b>sideslip</b> <b>angles</b> was reduced to 3 degrees at a Mach number of 0. 88. The data indicated that, at lower <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> attack, the trim range extended to higher <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>sideslip.</b> The total normal-force and hinge-moment coefficients for both horizontal fins were slightly nonlinear with both angle-of-attack and fin deflection. The effect of Mach number was to reduce the slopes of the hinge-moment coefficient with <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> attack and deflection angle. In general, the effort <b>of</b> increasing the <b>sideslip</b> <b>angle</b> was to reduce the values of the fin normal-force and hinge-moment coefficients...|$|R

40|$|Wind tunnel {{tests of}} a 15 -foot-span {{model of a}} two-engine low wing {{transport}} airplane were made as a preliminary study of the emergency arising from the failure of one engine in flight. Two methods of reducing the initial yawing moment resulting from the failure of one engine were investigated and the equilibrium conditions were explored for two basic modes on one engine, one with zero <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>sideslip</b> {{and the other with}} several degrees of sideslip. The added drag resulting from the unsymmetrical attitudes required for flight on one engine was determined for the model airplane.
