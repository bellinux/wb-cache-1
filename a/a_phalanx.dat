5|$|Fossils {{from other}} parts of the UK and Iberia, mostly {{isolated}} teeth, have subsequently been attributed to Baryonyx or similar animals. Isolated teeth and bones from the Isle of Wight, including hand bones and a vertebra, have been attributed to this genus. A maxilla fragment from La Rioja, Spain, was attributed in 1995. In 1999 a postorbital bone, a squamosal bone, a tooth, vertebra remains, metacarpals, and <b>a</b> <b>phalanx</b> from the Sala de los Infantes deposit in Burgos Province, Spain, were attributed to an immature Baryonyx (though some of these elements are unknown in the holotype), and dinosaur tracks near Burgos have been identified as those of Baryonyx or a similar theropod. In 2011 a specimen (ML1190) from the Papo Seco Formation in Boca do Chapim, Portugal, with a fragmentary dentary, teeth, vertebrae, ribs, hip bones, a scapula, and <b>a</b> <b>phalanx</b> bone, was attributed to Baryonyx, the most complete Iberian remains of the animal. The skeletal elements of this specimen are also represented in the more complete holotype NHM R9951, except for the mid-neck vertebrae.|$|E
5|$|A 2007 report {{described}} pathologies in {{the bones}} of Majungasaurus. Scientists examined the remains of at least 21 individuals and discovered four with noticeable pathologies. While pathology had been studied in large tetanuran theropods like allosaurids and tyrannosaurids, {{this was the first}} time an abelisauroid had been examined in this manner. No wounds were found on any skull elements, in contrast to tyrannosaurids where sometimes gruesome facial bites were common. One of the specimens was <b>a</b> <b>phalanx</b> (toe bone) of the foot, which had apparently been broken and subsequently healed.|$|E
5|$|Militarily, a major {{lesson for}} the Greeks was the {{potential}} of the hoplite phalanx.

Marathon was the first time <b>a</b> <b>phalanx</b> faced more lightly armed troops, and revealed how effective the hoplites could be in battle. The phalanx formation was still vulnerable to cavalry (the cause of much caution by the Greek forces at the Battle of Plataea), but used in the right circumstances, it was now shown to be a potentially devastating weapon.|$|E

The Persians seem to have more-or-less disregarded the military lessons of Marathon. The composition of infantry for the second invasion seems to have been the same as during the first, despite the availability of hoplites and other heavy infantry in Persian-ruled lands. Having won battles against hoplites previously, the Persians may simply have regarded Marathon as an aberration.|$|E
5|$|On 7 January 1983 amateur fossil hunter William J. Walker {{discovered}} a large claw, <b>a</b> <b>phalanx</b> bone, {{and part of}} a rib in Smokejacks Pit, a clay pit near Ockley in Surrey, England. The tip of the claw was missing, but Walker found it a week later. British palaeontologists Alan J. Charig and Angela C. Milner examined the finds at the Natural History Museum of London and found more bones at the site on 7 February, but the entire skeleton could not be collected until May and June due to conditions at the pit. A team of eight museum staff members and several volunteers excavated two tonnes of matrix. Walker donated the claw to the museum, and the Ockley Brick Company (owners of the pit) donated the rest of the skeleton and provided equipment. The area had been explored for 200 years, but no similar remains had been found before.|$|E
5|$|The Lesser Antillean macaw or Guadeloupe macaw (Ara guadeloupensis) is a {{hypothetical}} extinct species of macaw that {{is thought to}} have been endemic to the Lesser Antillean island region of Guadeloupe. In spite of the absence of conserved specimens, many details about the Lesser Antillean macaw are known from several contemporary accounts, and the bird is the subject of some illustrations. Austin Hobart Clark described the species {{on the basis of these}} accounts in 1905. Due to the lack of physical remains, and the possibility that sightings were of macaws from the South American mainland, doubts have been raised about the existence of this species. <b>A</b> <b>phalanx</b> bone from the island of Marie-Galante confirmed the existence of a similar-sized macaw inhabiting the region prior to the arrival of humans, and was correlated with the Lesser Antillean macaw in 2015. Later that year, historical sources distinguishing between the red macaws of Guadeloupe and the scarlet macaw (A. macao) of the mainland were identified, further supporting its validity.|$|E

These defeats, plus those at the hands of Leo III of the Byzantine Empire in Anatolia, were the last great attempt at expansion by the Umayyad Caliphate before the destruction of the dynasty at the Battle of the Zab, and the rending of the Caliphate forever, especially the utter destruction of the Umayyad army at River Berre near Narbonne in 737.|$|E
25|$|The triarii (sing. triarius) {{were the}} veteran soldiers, {{to be used}} in battle only in extreme situations; they rested one knee down when not engaged in combat. The triarii served {{primarily}} as reserves or barrier troops designed to backstop the hastati and principes, and were equipped with long hastae (spears) rather than the pilum and gladius (the hastati and principes stopped using spears in 387 BC). Thus armed, they fought in <b>a</b> <b>phalanx</b> formation. The sight of an advancing armored formation of triarii legionaries frequently discouraged exultant enemies in pursuit of retreating hastati and principes troops.

25|$|Charles {{analysed}} {{what would}} be necessary for him to withstand a larger force and superior technology (the Muslim horsemen had adopted the armour and accoutrements of heavy cavalry from the Sassanid warrior class, which made the armored mounted knight possible). Not daring to send his few horsemen against the Islamic cavalry, he had his army fight in a formation used by the ancient Greeks to withstand superior numbers and weapons by discipline, courage, {{and a willingness to}} die for their cause: <b>a</b> <b>phalanx.</b> He had trained a core of his men year round, using mostly Church funds, and some had been with him since his earliest days after his father's death. It was this hard core of disciplined veterans that won the day for him at Tours.|$|E

25|$|These {{soldiers}} {{fought in}} close-ranked rectangular or square formations, {{of which the}} smallest tactical unit was the 256 men strong syntagma or speira. This formation typically fought eight or sixteen men deep and in a frontage of thirty-two or sixteen men accordingly. Each file of 16 men, a lochos, was commanded by a lochagos {{who was in the}} front rank. Junior officers, one at the rear and one in the centre, were in place to steady the ranks and maintain the cohesion of the formation, similar to modern-day NCOs. The commander of the syntagma theoretically fought {{at the head of the}} extreme far-right file. According to Aelian, a syntagma was accompanied by five additional individuals to the rear: a herald (to act as a messenger), a trumpeter (to sound out commands), an ensign (to hold the unit's standard), an additional officer (called ouragos), and a servant. This array of both audial and visual communication methods helped to make sure that even in the dust and din of battle orders could still be received and given. Six syntagmata formed a taxis of 1,500 men commanded by a strategos, six taxeis formed <b>a</b> <b>phalanx</b> under a phalangiarch.|$|E
500|$|During the campaign, Missouri was {{involved}} in a friendly fire incident with the Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigate [...] According to the official report, on 25 February, Jarretts Phalanx CIWS engaged the chaff fired by Missouri as a countermeasure against enemy missiles, and stray rounds from the firing struck Missouri, one penetrating through a bulkhead and becoming embedded in an interior passageway of the ship. Another round struck the ship on the forward funnel, passing completely through it. One sailor aboard Missouri was struck in the neck by flying shrapnel and suffered minor injuries. Those familiar with the incident are skeptical of this account, however, as Jarrett was reportedly over [...] away at the time and the characteristics of chaff are such that <b>a</b> <b>Phalanx</b> would not normally regard it as a threat and engage it. There is no dispute that the rounds that struck Missouri did come from Jarrett, and that it was an accident. The suspicion is that <b>a</b> <b>Phalanx</b> operator on Jarrett may have accidentally fired off a few rounds manually, although {{there is no evidence to}} support this.|$|E
