5|$|Although {{the high}} blood {{solubility}} of methoxyflurane is often undesirable, this property makes it useful in certain situations—it persists in the lipid compartment {{of the body}} for a long time, providing sedation and analgesia well into the postoperative period. There is substantial data to indicate that methoxyflurane is an effective <b>analgesic</b> and sedative agent at subanesthetic doses. Supervised self-administration of methoxyflurane in children and adults can briefly lead to deep sedation, {{and it has been}} used as a patient controlled <b>analgesic</b> for painful procedures in children in hospital emergency departments. During childbirth, administration of methoxyflurane produces significantly better analgesia, less psychomotor agitation, and only slightly more somnolence than trichloroethylene.|$|E

50|$|<b>Analgesics</b> are {{drugs that}} relieve pain. There {{are two main}} types: non-{{narcotic}} <b>analgesics</b> for mild pain, and narcotic <b>analgesics</b> for severe pain.|$|R
5000|$|Compound <b>analgesics</b> {{are those}} with {{multiple}} active ingredients; they include {{many of the}} stronger prescription <b>analgesics.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Analgesics</b> are a {{class of}} {{biochemicals}} that cause hypoalgesia. <b>Analgesics</b> can act on both the peripheral and central nervous systems to decrease pain. Certain <b>analgesics</b> also work to decrease {{the source of the}} pain by working to decrease swelling and inflammation, {{as in the case of}} NSAIDs.|$|R
5|$|An {{intrathecal}} pump infuses an opioid such as morphine {{directly into}} the fluid-filled space (the subarachnoid cavity) between the spinal cord and its protective sheath, providing enhanced analgesia with reduced systemic side effects. This can reduce the level of pain in otherwise intractable cases. An anxiolytic or a nonopioid <b>analgesic,</b> and local anesthetics may also be infused along with the opioid.|$|E
5|$|Narcosis {{is known}} to be {{additive}} to even minimal alcohol intoxication, and also to the effects of other drugs such as cannabis (which is more likely than alcohol to have effects that last into a day of abstinence from use). Other sedative and <b>analgesic</b> drugs, such as opiate narcotics and benzodiazepines, add to narcosis.|$|E
5|$|Perovskia atriplicifolia has a {{long history}} of use in {{traditional}} medicine, especially as an antipyretic.

40|$|SummaryFlores MP, Castro APCR, Nascimento JS – Topical <b>Analgesics.</b> Background and objectivesPain {{treatment}} {{involves the}} usage of common and opioid <b>analgesics,</b> nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and adjuvant <b>analgesics.</b> Traditionally, these drugs are administered systemically or into the neuraxis. However, when <b>analgesics</b> are applied through these pathways, they are associated with significant side effects, which can hinder its use. Topical administration of <b>analgesics</b> is an alternative. The objective {{of this paper is}} to discuss topical <b>analgesics,</b> the mechanisms of action and clinical efficacy. ContentThis is a review paper addressing {{the usage of}} the topical local anesthetics: capsaicin, clonidine, tricyclic antidepressants, ketamine, opioids and cannabinoids, discussing mechanism of action and effectiveness. ConclusionsTopical <b>analgesics</b> are promising as a strategy for pain treatment, as they are associated with lower incidence of side effects. The benefit of local anesthetics, NSAID's and capsaicin is well established. However, the efficacy of clonidine, tricyclic antidepressants, ketamine, opioids and cannabinoids is still questionable. Studies have shown that the multimodal approach is an alternative, but studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis...|$|R
25|$|Adjuvant <b>analgesics,</b> {{also called}} {{atypical}} <b>analgesics,</b> include nefopam, orphenadrine, pregabalin, gabapentin, cyclobenzaprine, hyoscine (scopolamine), {{and other drugs}} possessing anticonvulsant, anticholinergic, and/or antispasmodic properties, {{as well as many}} other drugs with CNS actions. These drugs are used along with <b>analgesics</b> to modulate and/or modify the action of opioids when used against pain, especially of neuropathic origin.|$|R
5|$|The C-term-EH catalyzes the {{addition}} of water to an epoxide to yield a vicinal diol (reaction 1). The Nterm-phos hydrolyzes phosphate monoesters, such as lipid phosphates, to yield alcohols and phosphoric acid (reaction 2). The C-term-EH hydrolyzes one important class of lipid signaling molecules that includes many epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) that have vasoactive, anti-inflammatory and <b>analgesic</b> properties.|$|E
5|$|With {{a minimum}} {{alveolar}} concentration (MAC) of 0.16%, methoxyflurane {{is an extremely}} potent anesthetic agent. It is a powerful <b>analgesic</b> agent at well below full anesthetic concentrations. Because of its low volatility and very high boiling point (104.8°C at 1atmosphere), methoxyflurane has a low vapor pressure at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure. It is therefore quite difficult to vaporize methoxyflurane using conventional anesthetic vaporizers.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{incidence}} of respiratory depression/arrest is low (0.1–0.5%) when midazolam is administered alone at normal doses, the concomitant use with CNS acting drugs, mainly <b>analgesic</b> opiates, may increase the possibility of hypotension, respiratory depression, respiratory arrest, and death, even at therapeutic doses. Potential drug interactions involving at least one CNS depressant were observed for 84% of midazolam users who were subsequently required to receive the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil. Therefore, efforts directed toward monitoring drug interactions and preventing injuries from midazolam administration {{are expected to have}} a substantial impact on the safe use of this drug.|$|E
40|$|I {{measured}} {{the role of}} opioid <b>analgesics</b> in drug abuse–related deaths in a consistent panel of 28 metropolitan areas from the Drug Abuse Warning Network. The number of reports of opioid <b>analgesics</b> increased 96. 6 % from 1997 to 2002; methadone, oxycodone, and unspecified opioid <b>analgesics</b> accounted for 74. 3 % of the increase. Oxycodone reports increased 727. 8 % (from 72 to 596 reports). By 2002, opioid <b>analgesics</b> were noted more frequently than were heroin or cocaine. Dramatic increases in the availability of such opioids have made their abuse a major, growing problem...|$|R
40|$|The {{usefulness}} of anti-inflammatory drugs in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is beyond dispute. The role of simple <b>analgesics</b> {{is less clear}} and has been disputed. A survey of 21 rheumatologists indicated that a majority sometimes supplemented anti-inflammatory treatment of RA with simple <b>analgesics.</b> A random sample of 120 RA patients treated by the same doctors revealed that 47 % ranked pain relief as the most desirable objective of their treatment and 54 % were taking <b>analgesics</b> regularly. Of those receiving <b>analgesics</b> as well as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 48 % considered the former to be the more effective preparations. Almost half the patients on <b>analgesics</b> were taking drugs without {{the knowledge of the}} rheumatologists, who may have underestimated their patients' desire for pain relief...|$|R
25|$|When {{choosing}} <b>analgesics,</b> {{the severity}} {{and response to}} other medication determines the choice of agent; the World Health Organization (WHO) pain ladder specifies mild <b>analgesics</b> as its first step.|$|R
5|$|Aspirin is an {{effective}} <b>analgesic</b> for acute pain, but is generally considered inferior to ibuprofen for the alleviation of pain because aspirin {{is more likely to}} cause gastrointestinal bleeding. Aspirin is generally ineffective for those pains caused by muscle cramps, bloating, gastric distension, or acute skin irritation. As with other NSAIDs, combinations of aspirin and caffeine provide slightly greater pain relief than aspirin alone. Effervescent formulations of aspirin, such as Alka-Seltzer or Blowfish, relieve pain faster than aspirin in tablets, which makes them useful for the treatment of migraines. Topical aspirin may be effective for treating some types of neuropathic pain.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{is readily}} broken {{down in the}} body to {{salicylic}} acid, which itself has anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and <b>analgesic</b> effects. In 2012, salicylic acid was found to activate AMP-activated protein kinase, which has been suggested as a possible explanation {{for some of the}} effects of both salicylic acid and aspirin. The acetyl portion of the aspirin molecule has its own targets. Acetylation of cellular proteins is a well-established phenomenon in the regulation of protein function at the post-translational level. Aspirin is able to acetylate several other targets in addition to COX isoenzymes. These acetylation reactions may explain many hitherto unexplained effects of aspirin.|$|E
5|$|Methoxyflurane is an {{extremely}} potent and highly lipid-soluble anesthetic agent, characterized by very slow induction (onset of action) and emergence (offset or dissipation) times. It is non-flammable, has relatively mild hemodynamic effects, {{and it does not}} predispose the heart to rhythm disturbances. It is, however, a significant respiratory depressant. Methoxyflurane has powerful <b>analgesic</b> (pain-relieving) properties at well below full anesthetic doses. It was utilized in self-administration devices for obstetric analgesia, in a manner that foreshadowed the patient-controlled analgesia infusion pumps of today.|$|E
50|$|Nevertheless, initial therapy of {{the major}} rheumatological {{diseases}} is with <b>analgesics,</b> such as paracetamol and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), members of which are ibuprofen and naproxen. Often, stronger <b>analgesics</b> are required.|$|R

Education may be more helpful to people with stage I cancer and their carers, and coping-skills training may be more helpful at stages II and III.|$|E
5|$|Several {{subsequent}} studies put aspirin's effectiveness as a heart drug on firmer ground, but {{the evidence}} was not incontrovertible. However, in the mid-1980s, with the relatively new technique of meta-analysis, statistician Richard Peto convinced the U.S. FDA {{and much of the}} medical community that the aspirin studies, in aggregate, showed aspirin's effectiveness with relative certainty. By the end of the 1980s, aspirin was widely used as a preventive drug for heart attacks and had regained its former position as the top-selling <b>analgesic</b> in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|The {{essential}} oil has displayed antimicrobial properties in vitro, and can {{function as a}} biopesticide, especially regarding Tropidion castaneum beetles and Camponotus maculatus carpenter ants.

The isorinic acid derivative perovskoate may also contribute to an anti-inflammatory effect as an arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor.

40|$|ADOLESCENTS´ VIEWS ON SELF MEDICATION WITH OTC ANALGESICS INVESTIGATED BY FOCUS GROUP INTERVIEWS Background: The use of OTC <b>analgesics</b> among {{adolescents}} is widespread. Little {{is known about}} why they use it. Objective: This study aims at {{a better understanding of}} why adolescents use OTC <b>analgesics,</b> the availability of the drugs, and how young people are informed about the use. This information is valuable in designing a quantitative survey on the same subject. Material and methods: Pupils aged fourteen to sixteen years, from two junior high schools in central Oslo, were interviewed in four focus groups, each sex separately. The interviews were audio taped, transcribed and analyzed by systematic text condensation. Results and Interpretation: A total of 29 adolescents participated. The adolescents used <b>analgesics</b> {{on a wide range of}} indications. Most common were headache, menstruation, fever, earache, injuries during sport and pain associated with braces. Some adolescents reported using <b>analgesics</b> to prevent pain in stressful situations, to use <b>analgesics</b> against sleeplessness and to increase the effect of alcohol. Systematic information on OTC <b>analgesics</b> was rarely attained. The pattern of use was according to the adolescents mainly acquired from parents. The adolescents knew little about side-effects. Some were worried that continuous use or high doses might bring down the effect. OTC <b>analgesics</b> were easily accessible at home and they also bought it themselves. They gradually started to administrate their own medication without consulting adults. We found that there is a need for more information about OTC <b>analgesics</b> {{among adolescents}}...|$|R
5|$|Amphetamine {{stimulates the}} {{medullary}} respiratory centers, producing faster and deeper breaths. In {{a normal person}} at therapeutic doses, this effect is usually not noticeable, but when respiration is already compromised, it may be evident. Amphetamine also induces contraction in the urinary bladder sphincter, the muscle which controls urination, which can result in difficulty urinating. This effect {{can be useful in}} treating bed wetting and loss of bladder control. The effects of amphetamine on the gastrointestinal tract are unpredictable. If intestinal activity is high, amphetamine may reduce gastrointestinal motility (the rate at which content moves through the digestive system); however, amphetamine may increase motility when the smooth muscle of the tract is relaxed. Amphetamine also has a slight <b>analgesic</b> effect and can enhance the pain relieving effects of opioids.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the poor}} quality of most studies of {{complementary}} and alternative medicine {{in the treatment of}} cancer pain, {{it is not possible to}} recommend integration of these therapies into the management of cancer pain. There is weak evidence for a modest benefit from hypnosis; studies of massage therapy produced mixed results and none found pain relief after 4 weeks; Reiki, and touch therapy results were inconclusive; acupuncture, the most studied such treatment, has demonstrated no benefit as an adjunct <b>analgesic</b> in cancer pain; the evidence for music therapy is equivocal; and some herbal interventions such as PC-SPES, mistletoe, and saw palmetto are known to be toxic to some people with cancer. The most promising evidence, though still weak, is for mind-body interventions such as biofeedback and relaxation techniques.|$|E
5|$|However, Sterling Products did not market Panadol in the United States {{or other}} {{countries}} where Bayer Aspirin still dominated the aspirin market. Other firms began selling acetaminophen drugs, most significantly, McNeil Laboratories with liquid Tylenol in 1955, and Tylenol pills in 1958. By 1967, Tylenol was available without a prescription. Because {{it did not}} cause gastric irritation, acetaminophen rapidly displaced much of aspirin's sales. Another <b>analgesic,</b> anti-inflammatory drug was introduced in 1962: ibuprofen (sold as Brufen in the U.K. and Motrin in the U.S.). By the 1970s, aspirin had a relatively {{small portion of the}} pain reliever market, and in the 1980s sales decreased even more when ibuprofen became available without prescription.|$|E
40|$|Background: Approximately {{one half}} of the {{patients}} with chronic daily headaches report a regular use of <b>analgesics,</b> making it an important issue for public health matters. However, factors contributing to the dependency and overuse of <b>analgesics</b> for chronic tension type headaches have been little understood. We investigated the role of chronic <b>analgesics</b> exposure in the natural course and clinical phenotype of headaches in patients with chronic tension type headaches. We also evaluated genetically determined innate factor that could exert a profound influence on a development of <b>analgesics</b> overuse using a serotonin transporter protein polymorphism and serotonergically related harm avoidance (HA) personality dimension. Methods: We analyzed the headache characteristics using a standardized questionnaire from 38 patients with chronic tension type headache with <b>analgesics</b> overuse (CTTH-AO), from 40 patients with chronic tension type headache without <b>analgesics</b> overuse (CTTH-NO) and from 100 healthy controls. We performed the serotonin transporter protein gene linked to the polymorphic region (5 -HTTLPR) genotype, polymorphism analyses and investigated the serotonin related personality trait by evaluating the HA dimension in tri-dimensional personality questionnaires (TPQ).
