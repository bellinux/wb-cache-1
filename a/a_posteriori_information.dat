40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} {{the use of}} selective-retransmission automatic repeat request (ARQ) protocols to improve communication performance on partial-time jamming channels. The schemes that we propose are based on reliability-based hybrid ARQ (RB-HARQ), in which the set of bits to be retransmitted is adaptively selected based on the estimated <b>a</b> <b>posteriori</b> probabilities at the output of a soft-input, soft-output decoder. For channels with bursty partial-time jamming, the RB-HARQ techniques are particularly appropriate because these techniques can identify which symbols need to be retransmitted, and the bursty nature of the jamming reduces the overhead required to relay this information to the source. We extend our reliability measure to incorporate not only <b>a</b> <b>posteriori</b> probability <b>information</b> but also estimates of {{the probability that a}} bit was jammed. We compare the performance of the proposed scheme with that of conventional approaches, in which a predetermined set of bits is retransmitted in response to a packet failure. The results show that RB-HARQ schemes can achieve higher throughput than these conventional approaches in several scenarios.

Accounting for IOV in the FIMMAP markedly affected the designs compared to ignoring IOV and, as evaluated by stochastic simulation and estimation, resulted in superior precision in the individual parameters.

30|$|In {{iterative}} decoding algorithms, {{the underlying}} turbo principle relies on extrinsic information exchanges and iterative processing between different Soft-Input Soft-Output (SISO) modules. Using input {{information and a}} priori extrinsic information, each SISO module computes <b>a</b> <b>posteriori</b> extrinsic <b>information.</b> This constitutes the a priori information for the other modules and is exchanged via interleaving and deinterleaving processes. For convolutional turbo codes, the SISO modules process the BCJR or forward-backward algorithm [2] which is the optimal algorithm for the maximum <b>a</b> <b>posteriori</b> (MAP) decoding of convolutional codes. So, a BCJR SISO firstly computes branch metrics (or γ metrics), which represent {{the probability of a}} transition occurring between two trellis states. Then a BCJR SISO computes forward and backward recursions. Forward recursion (or α recursion) computes a trellis section (i.e., the probability of all states of the trellis) using the previous trellis section and branch metrics between these two sections, while backward recursion (or β recursion) computes a trellis section using the future trellis section and branch metrics between these two sections. Finally, extrinsic information is computed from the forward recursion, the backward recursion and the extrinsic part of the branch metrics. Therefore, turbo decoders, because of iterative decoding process and BCJR complexity (bidirectional recursive computing), imply optimal parallelism exploitation in order to achieve high-data rates required in present and future applications.|$|R
