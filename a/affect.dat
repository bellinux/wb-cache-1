40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} on four sibling pairs <b>affected</b> by cystic fibrosis. Of each sibling pair, one was more <b>affected</b> than the other. The {{results show that the}} lymphoblastic response to the antigen Pseudomonas aeruginosa of the most <b>affected</b> patient was strongly reduced in comparison to the response of the less <b>affected</b> one. The plasma from the most <b>affected</b> patient contains an inhibitory factor which reduces the lymphoblastic response of the less <b>affected</b> one. On the other hand, plasma fom the less <b>affected</b> patient improves the lymphoblastic response of the most <b>affected</b> one (although not significantly). One notes a better lymphoblastic response when the most <b>affected</b> patient's lymphocytes are put {{in the presence of the}} less <b>affected</b> one's antigens and plasma. These findings suggest a phenomenon of lymphocyte tolerance in the most <b>affected</b> patient towards P. aeruginosa. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

(2) In families with unaffected parents and HLA half-identical <b>affected</b> sibs, well siblings more often receive the single haplotype not found in the <b>affected</b> sibs than is expected by chance (P less than. 05). (3) In families with one <b>affected</b> parent, well siblings of <b>affected</b> individuals may share with the <b>affected</b> child a haplotype from the unaffected parent less than 50 % of the time (P less than. 10).

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, we have {{proposed}} statistical methods for detecting and classifying fungal disease. The classification is done based on disease severity levels. In this work, we have considered fungal disease symptoms <b>affected</b> on fruits like mango, pomegranate and grape. In this study, images of fruits <b>affected</b> by different fungal symptoms are collected and categorized based on disease severity as partially <b>affected,</b> moderately <b>affected,</b> severely <b>affected</b> and normal. Statistical features using block wise, Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), Gray Level Run-length Matrix (GLRM) are extracted from these images. The Nearest Neighbor classifier using Euclidean distance {{is used to}} classify images as partially <b>affected,</b> moderately <b>affected,</b> severely <b>affected</b> and normal. The average classification accuracies are 91. 37 % and 86. 715 % using GLCM and GLRM features. The average classification accuracy has increased to 94. 085 % using block wise features...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Genetic and {{environmental}} factors have important roles in multiple sclerosis (MS) susceptibility. The precise nature of these factors and mode of inheritance remains unknown. A female predominance is universally found. Recently, offspring of <b>affected</b> fathers were reported to {{be more likely to}} have MS than those of <b>affected</b> mothers. This was attributed to the Carter effect, which is seen in polygenic disorders. The Carter effect predicts that <b>affected</b> parents of the sex lesser <b>affected</b> by a disease/trait are more genetically loaded for risk alleles and thus transmit these more often to their offspring. This hypothesis was tested in a population-based Canadian MS cohort. METHODS: Using the longitudinal Canadian database, we identified 3, 088 nuclear families with one <b>affected</b> parent and a total of 8, 401 offspring, of which 798 had MS. Transmission to daughters and sons from <b>affected</b> mothers and fathers was compared. RESULTS: There was equal transmission of MS from <b>affected</b> fathers vs <b>affected</b> mothers (9. 41 % vs 9. 76 %). Stratifying by gender of <b>affected</b> parent there were no differences in the female:male sex ratio of <b>affected</b> (2. 46 % vs 2. 41 %, p = 0. 88) or unaffected offspring (0. 91 % vs 0. 95 %, p = 0. 46). CONCLUSIONS: We observed equal disease transmission to offspring from <b>affected</b> mothers and <b>affected</b> fathers, no difference in the female:male sex ratio of <b>affected</b> offspring, and previously no difference in sibling recurrence risk by gender of parent <b>affected.</b> These findings show no evidence for the Carter effect and do not support the hypothesis of polygenic inheritance of multiple sclerosis susceptibility by parent...|$|R
