We offer real-time slicing on the Web by partitioning the application between a Java applet (the client) and the Web server. Two approaches for partitioning the work between the client and the server are presented and compared. In the first approach, we transfer complete compressed slices from the server to the client. In the second approach, we successively build a local cache on the client by transferring small subvolumes of increasing resolution from the server to the client.

40|$|Abstract Background Publicly {{accessible}} EST libraries contain {{valuable information}} that can be utilized for studies of tissue-specific gene expression and processing of individual genes. This information is, however, confounded by multiple systematic effects arising from the procedures used to generate these libraries. Results We used alignment of ESTs against a reference set of transcripts to estimate the size distributions of the cDNA inserts and sampled mRNA transcripts in individual EST libraries and show how these measurements can be used to inform quantitative comparisons of libraries. While significant {{attention has been paid to}} the effects of normalization and substraction, we also find significant biases in transcript sampling introduced by the combined procedures of reverse transcription and selection of cDNA clones for sequencing. Using examples drawn from studies of mRNA 3 '-processing (cleavage and polyadenylation), we demonstrate effects of the transcript sampling bias, and provide a method for identifying libraries that can be safely compared without bias. All data sets, supplemental data, and software are available <b>at</b> <b>our</b> supplemental <b>web</b> <b>site</b> 1. Conclusion The biases we characterize in the transcript sampling of EST libraries represent a significant and heretofore under-appreciated source of false positive candidates for tissue-, cell type-, or developmental stage-specific activity or processing of genes. Uncorrected, quantitative comparison of dissimilar EST libraries will likely result in the identification of statistically significant, but biologically meaningless changes. </p...|$|R

40|$|Single {{nucleotide}} polymorphism (SNP) arrays {{are powerful}} tools to delineate genomic aberrations in cancer genomes. However, {{the analysis of}} these SNP array data of cancer samples is complicated by three phenomena: (a) aneuploidy: due to massive aberrations, the total DNA content of a cancer cell can differ significantly from its normal two copies; (b) nonaberrant cell admixture: samples from solid tumors do not exclusively contain aberrant tumor cells, but always contain some portion of nonaberrant cells; (c) intratumor heterogeneity: different cells in the tumor sample may have different aberrations. We describe here how these phenomena impact the SNP array profile, and how these can be accounted for in the analysis. In an extended practical example, we apply our recently developed and further improved ASCAT (allele-specific copy number analysis of tumors) suite of tools to analyze SNP array data using data {{from a series of}} breast carcinomas as an example. We first describe the structure of the data, how it can be plotted and interpreted, and how it can be segmented. The core ASCAT algorithm next determines the fraction of nonaberrant cells and the tumor ploidy (the average number of DNA copies), and calculates an ASCAT profile. We describe how these ASCAT profiles visualize both copy number aberrations as well as copy-number-neutral events. Finally, we touch upon regions showing intratumor heterogeneity, and how they can be detected in ASCAT profiles.

40|$|Figure 4 : Animation of {{orientation}} tuning map under blurring. Example frame of animation depicting the orientation map shown in Fig. 2 of the accompanying report under blurring of successively broader low-pass filters. The filter {{applied to the}} in vivo map was an isotropic Cauchy kernel parameterized by its FWHM. The blurring filter is increased in 20 25 -µm steps from 0 µm (which corresponds to the initial or in vivo pattern) to 500 µm, resulting in twenty-one frames of animation. Positive chirality (i. e., right-handed) pinwheels are indicated by white circles and negative chirality by black squares, both placed at the pinwheel centers. The solid and dashed black lines trace out zero-crossing contours of the real and imaginary components of the complex orientation map, respectively. Note that the orientation singularities occur at intersections of the two families of zero-crossings, {{as described in the}} accompanying report. It has been shown that left- and right-handed orientation singularities are nearest neighbors (both in simulation and using actual optical recording data; see ref. 1) along the zero-crossing lines of the complex orientation map. In addition, the Voronoï diagram [2] of the pinwheel centers has been provided as white lines to aid in the visualization of the pinwheel migration and annihilation. Each frame is 256 × 256 pixels, and each pixel represents about 15 µm, therefore each frame represents just under 3. 9 × 3. 9 mm. The scale bar in the lower left corner of each frame represents 1 mm of cortex, and the pseudo-color map {{of orientation}} labels is displayed on the right.

Sound signals were recorded using mono-directional and omni-directional loudspeakers because musical instruments have their own directivity. The experiments were conducted using two or three sound sources from instruments (flute, vi-olin, and piano) generated by a synthesizer, and these results indicated that the performance was influenced by the direc-tivity of the instrument and the initial reverberation time.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the implementation of}} a fast and accurate particle level set library. Level sets are very effective for representating dynamic surfaces and have been crucial to recent research within computer graphics, perhaps most significantly within fluid simulations. However, implementating a particle level set method is involved and requires significant effort. This paper aims to provide a publicly available library that implements a particle level set method as a blackbox. The users mainly need to provide a velocity field through which the level set is moved. The paper is self-contained. We first describe the particle level set method and the subtleties of a robust implementation. We then demonstrate the use and the effectiveness of the library with a few simple examples. The source code of the library and working examples are publicly available <b>at</b> <b>our</b> <b>web</b> <b>site.</b> ...|$|E

However, {{the first step is to}} study the behavior of the noise. Once we establish a mathematical model of noise, we can obtain an optimal solution under that model by doing statistical analysis.

40|$|Abstract Background Successful {{realization}} of a "systems biology" approach to analyzing cells {{is a grand}} challenge for our understanding of life. However, current modeling approaches to cell simulation are labor-intensive, manual affairs, and therefore constitute a major bottleneck {{in the evolution of}} computational cell biology. Results We developed the Genome-based Modeling (GEM) System for the purpose of automatically prototyping simulation models of cell-wide metabolic pathways from genome sequences and other public biological information. Models generated by the GEM System include an entire Escherichia coli metabolism model comprising 968 reactions of 1195 metabolites, achieving 100 % coverage when compared with the KEGG database, 92. 38 % with the EcoCyc database, and 95. 06 % with iJR 904 genome-scale model.

40|$|Introduction BONSAI is {{a machine}} {{learning}} system for knowledge acquisition from {{positive and negative}} examples of strings. It is reported that the system has discovered knowledge which can classify amino acid sequences of transmembrane domains and randomly chosen amino acid sequences located {{in other parts of}} the PIR database, with over 90 % accuracy [4]. A hypothesis generated by the system is a pair of a classification of symbols called an alphabet indexing, and a decision tree over regular patterns, which classifies given examples with high accuracy. The whole algorithm of the system consists of two parts: a learning algorithm for constructing a decision tree over regular patterns, and a searching algorithm for finding an alphabet indexing to produce a better decision tree.
