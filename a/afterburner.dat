5|$|XF6U-1: Three prototypes, {{two with}} an Westinghouse J34-WE-22 {{turbojet}} engine (BuNo 33532, 33533), {{one with an}} J34-WE-30 with <b>afterburner</b> (BuNo 33534).|$|E
5|$|A {{project to}} improve the {{performance}} of the J 34 resulted in one Hunter being fitted with a Swedish-designed <b>afterburner</b> in 1958. While this significantly increased the engine's thrust, there was little improvement in overall performance, thus the project was shelved. The last of the J 34s was retired from service in 1969.|$|E
5|$|The Vought F6U Pirate was the Vought company's first jet fighter, {{designed}} for US Navy during the mid-1940s. Although pioneering {{the use of}} turbojet power as the first naval fighter with an <b>afterburner</b> and composite material construction, the aircraft proved to be underpowered and was judged unsuitable for combat. None were ever issued to operational squadrons and they were relegated to development, training and test roles before they were withdrawn from service in 1950.|$|E
50|$|Players {{achieve their}} ship's top speed by {{maintaining}} thrust. Each ship is also equipped with <b>afterburners</b> (Shift+Up/Down) which allow {{the ship to}} exceed its typical top speed; however, this gradually drains the ship's energy. When <b>afterburners</b> are disengaged, the ship's inertia returns to its normal top speed, not its speed with <b>afterburners.</b>|$|R
50|$|Most {{military}} aircraft use <b>afterburners</b> (or reheat) to occasionally travel at supersonic speeds and cannot reach supersonic speeds using the dry engine thrust. In these cases <b>afterburners</b> are highly inefficient compared to conventional jet engine operation {{due to the}} low pressures typically found in the exhaust section, but their engines are more efficient when the <b>afterburners</b> are not operational, although also less powerful.|$|R
50|$|Supercruise is {{sustained}} supersonic {{flight of}} a supersonic aircraft with a useful cargo, passenger, or weapons load performed efficiently, which typically precludes {{the use of}} highly inefficient <b>afterburners</b> (reheat). Many well known supersonic military aircraft are not capable of supercruise as they are only able to maintain supersonic flight in short bursts (typically with <b>afterburners)</b> while they cruise at subsonic speeds. Aircraft such as the SR-71 Blackbird are designed to cruise at supersonic speed with <b>afterburners</b> enabled.|$|R
5|$|WS-110 was {{redesigned}} as {{an aircraft}} flying Mach3 {{for the entire}} mission. Zip fuel was retained for the engine's <b>afterburner</b> to increase range. Both North American and Boeing returned new designs with very long fuselages and large delta wings. They differed primarily in engine layout; the NAA design arranged its six engines in a semi-circular duct under the rear fuselage, while the Boeing design used separate podded engines located individually on pylons below the wing, like the Hustler.|$|E
5|$|Consequently, on 13April1961, HSA {{decided to}} conduct {{preliminary}} {{work on a}} supersonic derivative of the P.1127 {{under the guidance of}} Ralph Hooper. This would result in a new design, designated P.1150, which was 50% larger than the preceding P.1127; it was proposed that a new performance enhancing feature be adopted {{in the form of the}} plenum chamber burning (PCB)– essentially an <b>afterburner</b> – in the engine. The P.1150 proposal broadly resembled its P.1127 predecessor despite major changes being made, including its revised fuselage, the adoption of a thinner wing, and an advanced version of the Pegasus engine. The Bristol Siddeley BS100 engine was equipped with a similar arrangement of four swivelling exhaust nozzles, the front nozzles of which were to be equipped with PCB. According to aviation author Derek Wood, the P.1150 was to have been capable of Mach 1.3.|$|E
5|$|The USN {{operated}} the F4H-1 (re-designated F-4A in 1962) with J79-GE-2 and -2A engines of 16,100lbf (71.62kN) thrust and later builds receiving -8 engines. A total of 45 F-4As were built and none saw combat and most {{ended up as}} test or training aircraft. The USN and USMC received the first definitive Phantom, the F-4B which was equipped with the Westinghouse APQ-72 radar (pulse only), a Texas Instruments AAA-4 Infra-red search and track pod under the nose, an AN/AJB-3 bombing system and powered by J79-GE-8,-8A and -8B engines of 10,900lbf (48.5kN) dry and 16,950lbf (75.4kN) <b>afterburner</b> (reheat) with the first flight on 25 March 1961. 649 F-4Bs were built with deliveries beginning in 1961 and VF-121 Pacemakers receiving the first examples at NAS Miramar.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{temperature}} limitations {{with the}} gas turbines, jet engines do not consume all the {{oxygen in the}} air ('run stoichiometric'). <b>Afterburners</b> burn the remaining oxygen after exiting the turbines, but usually do so inefficiently due to the low pressures typically found at {{this part of the}} jet engine make the subsequent nozzle inefficient at extracting the heat energy; however <b>afterburners</b> still gain significant thrust, which can be useful. Engines intended for extended use with <b>afterburners</b> often have variable nozzles and other details.|$|R

5|$|When {{the first}} {{prototype}} Jaguar flew on 8September1968, {{it was also}} the first flight for the engine. In its initial development the Adour engine had complications with the stability of the <b>afterburner</b> system, and shipboard testing showed slow throttle response times, problematic in the situation of an aborted landing; engine improvements rectified these problems prior to the Jaguar coming into service. In French service, the Jaguars were introduced using the original Mk.101 engine. RAF Jaguars entered service using the Mk.102 engine, mainly featuring better afterburner-throttle control over the Mk.101. The RAF later had its Jaguars re-engined around 1981 with the improved Adour Mk.104, and again in 1999 with the Mk.106, each providing greater performance.|$|E
5|$|The major {{difference}} between the F-4J and the British Phantoms was {{the absence of the}} Rolls-Royce Spey turbofan, the former being fitted with the GE J79-10B. This produced less power than the British engine, but had a faster <b>afterburner</b> light up, giving it better performance at high altitude, at the expense of slightly poorer acceleration at low level. The high-altitude performance was helped by the reduced drag from its smaller air intakes. Initially delivered capable of carrying the AIM-7 Sparrow and AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles (AAM), they were soon made compatible with the Skyflash and SUU-23A gun pod, bringing them into line {{with the rest of the}} RAF's Phantoms. Despite modifications to allow them to operate with the rest of the fleet, the F-4Js retained the vast bulk of the equipment they were originally fitted with, even requiring their crews to use American flying helmets.|$|E
5|$|The Phantom FG.1 and FGR.2 {{as built}} were similar, being fitted with broadly the same engines and avionics, {{although}} there were minor differences. The FGR.2 was fitted with the Mark 202 version of the Rolls-Royce Spey turbofan, while the FG.1 had the Mark 203; this was fundamentally the same, but the 203 had a modified control system for the <b>afterburner,</b> allowing it to light faster and enable power to be applied quickly {{in the event of}} a bolter on the small decks of the Royal Navy's aircraft carriers. Both variants were fitted with a licence built version of the Westinghouse AN/AWG-10 avionics package; the FG.1 was fitted with the AN/AWG-11, which differed primarily in having a nose radome that was hinged and able to fold backwards against the aircraft's fuselage to allow for storage in the hangar of an aircraft carrier; the system was designed to be integrated with both the AGM-12 Bullpup missile and WE.177 as required. The AN/AWG-12 fitted to the FGR.2 was not foldable, and featured a better ground mapping mode, to take into account the strike role for which the type was originally procured; allied to this was a Ferranti inertial navigation/attack system (removed when the type converted to the air defence role). It was also configured to be able to control the SUU-23A gun pod, which the Royal Navy's FG.1s lacked.|$|E
50|$|<b>Afterburners</b> are {{generally}} only used in military aircraft and are considered standard equipment for fighter aircraft. The handful of civilian planes that have used them include some NASA research aircraft, the Tupolev Tu-144 and Concorde, and the White Knight of Scaled Composites. Concorde and the Tu-144 had this capability and flew long distances at supersonic speeds. Sustained high speeds {{would be impossible}} with the high fuel consumption of reheat, and these aircraft used <b>afterburners</b> at takeoff and to minimise {{time spent in the}} high drag transonic flight regime. Supersonic flight without <b>afterburners</b> is referred to as supercruise.|$|R

5|$|Montoya {{made his}} pit stop on lap 22. However, his pit stop proved problematic: the signal lights at his pit box stopped working, causing the Williams refuller {{to switch to}} the fuel rig for Ralf Schumacher and Montoya {{remained}} stationary for 20 seconds longer than usual. Montoya was also fuelled for longer than his team planned. Ralf Schumacher thus inherited the lead with Michael Schumacher behind him and Montoya re-emerged in fourth place. One lap later, Michael Schumacher took his pit stop and he {{came out with a}} fuel pressure problem which meant he pulled {{to the side of the}} main straight and retired. Burti spun off and beached his car in the gravel trap at Nordkurve on the same lap. Ralf Schumacher made his pit stop on lap 24 and rejoined with a 10-second advantage. Villeneuve, Button and Alonso all followed Ralf Schumacher into the pit lane on the same lap. Alonso encountered a problem when leaving his pit box: the Minardi refuelling valve had a problem, and his car's <b>afterburner</b> remained on, though the flames extinguished themselves when Alonso accelerated out of the pit lane. Montoya pulled over to the side of the track on lap 25, with smoke billowing from his engine, and retired. Fisichella made a pit stop from fourth on lap 26 and re-emerged in fifth behind Villeneuve. Marques retired from the race with a gearbox problem on the same lap. Coulthard made a pit stop on lap 27 and immediately became the race's next retirement when he acclerated away from his pit box with a blown engine. The resulting event meant he pulled to the side of the circuit. Panis made his pit stop on lap 31 and came out behind Button and Alesi. Barrichello became the final driver to make a scheduled pit stop on the 32nd lap.|$|E
25|$|Had the {{aircraft}} met its design expectations, it was planned that {{the aircraft}} would reach Mach 1.65 (1,750km/h, 1,087mph) without <b>afterburner,</b> and Mach 1.88 with <b>afterburner.</b>|$|E
25|$|The primary {{difference}} between the XF3-400 and the standard F3-30 is the inclusion of an <b>afterburner.</b> Adding the <b>afterburner</b> is the primary reason why the maximum thrust of the -400 {{is much higher than}} the -30. Other changes included compressor and turbine blades that were aerodynamically optimized using 3D computational fluid dynamics techniques, and improved temperature performance in the high-pressure turbine.|$|E
50|$|The {{control of}} organic vapors is {{achieved}} by either destruction or collection. <b>Afterburners</b> are used downstream of rotary dryers and conveyor furnaces to destroy organic contaminants and oxidize carbon monoxide. Conventional <b>afterburners</b> are designed so that exit gas temperatures reach 1,400 °F to 1,600 °F. Organic destruction efficiency typically ranges from 95% to greater than 99%.|$|R

50|$|Due {{to their}} high fuel consumption, <b>afterburners</b> are usually used {{as little as}} possible; a notable {{exception}} is the Pratt & Whitney J58 engine used in the SR-71 Blackbird. <b>Afterburners</b> are generally used only when {{it is important to}} have as much thrust as possible. This includes during takeoff from short runways, assisting catapult launches from aircraft carriers, and during air combat situations.|$|R
