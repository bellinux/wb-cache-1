The expected results of the research will help prevent abnormal events effectively, capture the first scene of incidents and the abnormal source point quickly, and play a decision support role in the proactive national security strategy...|$|E

The results of the study indicate that both the quantity of radioactivity released in a severe accident as well as the likelihood of a release are lower than those predicted in earlier studies. The accident risks using the simplified source terms are examined at a series of generic plant sites, that vary in population distribution, meteorological conditions, and exclusion area boundary distances. Sensitivity calculations are performed to evaluate the effects of emergency protective action assumptions on the risk of prompt fatality and latent cancers fatality, and population relocation. The study finds that based on the new source terms the prompt and latent fatality risks at all generic sites meet the QHOs of the NRC`s Safety Goal Policy by margins ranging from one to more than three orders of magnitude. 4 refs., 17 figs., 24 tabs...|$|E

40|$|Representative <b>accident</b> <b>source</b> terms {{patterned}} after the NUREG- 1465 Source Term {{have been developed}} for high burnup fuel in BWRs and PWRs and for MOX fuel in a PWR with an ice-condenser containment. These source terms have been derived using nonparametric order statistics to develop distributions for the timing of radionuclide release during four accident phases and for release fractions of nine chemical classes of radionuclides as calculated with the MELCOR 1. 8. 5 accident analysis computer code. The accident phases are those defined in the NUREG- 1465 Source Term - gap release, in-vessel release, ex-vessel release, and late in-vessel release. Important differences among the <b>accident</b> <b>source</b> terms derived here and the NUREG- 1465 Source Term are not attributable to either fuel burnup or use of MOX fuel. Rather, differences among the source terms are due predominantly to improved understanding of the physics of core meltdown accidents. Heat losses from the degrading reactor core prolong the process of in-vessel release of radionuclides. Improved understanding of the chemistries of tellurium and cesium under reactor accidents changes the predicted behavior characteristics of these radioactive elements relative to what was assumed in the derivation of the NUREG- 1465 Source Term. An additional radionuclide chemical class has been defined to account for release of cesium as cesium molybdate which enhances molybdenum release relative to other metallic fission products...|$|E

40|$|The risks {{associated}} with the transport of spent nuclear fuel by truck and rail have been reexamined and compared to results published in NUREG-O 170 and the Modal Study. The full reexamination considered transport of PWR and BWR spent fuel by truck and rail in four generic Type B spent fuel casks. Because they are typical, this paper presents results only for transport of PWR spent fuel in steel-lead steel casks. Cask and spent fuel response to collision impacts and fires were evaluated by performing three-dimensional finite element and one-dimensional heat transport calculations. Accident release fractions were developed by critical review of literature data. Accident severity fractions were developed from Modal Study truck and rail accident event trees, modified to reflect the frequency of occurrence of hard and soft rock wayside route surfaces as determined by analysis of geographic data. Incident-free population doses and the population dose {{risks associated}} with the accidents that might occur during transport were calculated using the RADTRAN 5 transportation risk code. The calculated incident-free doses were compared to those published in NUREG-O 170. The calculated accident dose risks were compared to dose risks calculated using NUREG- 0170 and Modal Study <b>accident</b> <b>source</b> terms. The comparisons demonstrated that both of these studies {{made a number of}} very conservative assumptions about spent fuel and cask response to accident conditions, which caused their estimates of <b>accident</b> <b>source</b> terms, accident frequencies, and accident consequences to also be very conservative.

40|$|This {{report is}} about {{accidents}} {{with the potential}} to release radioactive materials into the environment surrounding the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS). As shown in Chap. 2, the inventories of radioactivity at the SNS are dominated by the target facility. Source terms {{for a wide range of}} target facility accidents, from anticipated events to worst-case beyond-design-basis events, are provided in Chaps. 3 and 4. The most important criterion applied to these <b>accident</b> <b>source</b> terms is that they should not underestimate potential release. Therefore, conservative methodology was employed for the release estimates. Although the source terms are very conservative, excessive conservatism has been avoided by basing the releases on physical principles. Since it is envisioned that the SNS facility may eventually (after about 10 years) be expanded and modified to support a 4 -MW proton beam operational capability, the source terms estimated in this report are applicable to a 4 -MW operating proton beam power unless otherwise specified. This is bounding with regard to the 1 -MW facility that will be built and operated initially. See further discussion below in Sect. 1. 2...|$|E
