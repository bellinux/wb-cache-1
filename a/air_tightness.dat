He would have been ugly, he substantively granted, had he not been happy; he would have been dangerous had he not been warranted.

His bright familiarity was that of a young prince whose confidence had never had to falter, and the only thing that at all qualified the resemblance was the equal familiarity excited in his subjects.|$|R

The relationship between the weft density, <b>tightness,</b> <b>air</b> permeability and downproofness was achieved. From the test results, following conclusions can be gotten. 1) Within a certain range, the air permeability is enhanced as weft density and tightness of fabrics are decreased; 2) The downproofness is good for fabrics with higher weft density; 3) The downproofness is good for fabrics with larger tightness; 4) From the analysis of linear regression, the downproofness and air permeability of the fabrics are negatively related, which means that good air permeability indicates poor downproofness of the fabrics...|$|R

30|$|Installation of {{production}} equipment may be preceded by additional evaluation steps, namely Factory Acceptance Testing (FAT) and Site Acceptance Testing (SAT). FAT/SAT are particularly useful {{in case of}} complex and/or bulky equipment, or when the intended instrument has been specifically designed, based on URS. A good example is represented by hot cells, {{whether or not they}} include automated systems. Hot cells are indeed bulky, and sometimes require some degree of customization, especially in case they have to be used for non-standard processes. During FAT, functionality of major components (buttons, fan, filters, etc.) may be tested, as well as parameters typically verified during OQ such as <b>air</b> velocity, leak <b>tightness</b> or particle contamination. The above tests might help to reveal possible malfunctions or deviations, that may be fixed directly at the Factory, before the shipment. FAT are usually repeated on Site (SAT), and they can be considered as part of the whole qualification.|$|R

50|$|Airborne {{transmission}} - a {{noise source}} {{in one room}} sends air pressure waves which induce vibration {{to one side of}} a wall or element of structure setting it moving such that the other face of the wall vibrates in an adjacent room. Structural isolation therefore becomes an important consideration in the acoustic design of buildings. Highly sensitive areas of buildings, for example recording studios, may be almost entirely isolated from the rest of a structure by constructing the studios as effective boxes supported by springs. <b>Air</b> <b>tightness</b> also becomes an important control technique. A tightly sealed door might have reasonable sound reduction properties, but if it is left open only a few millimeters its effectiveness is reduced to practically nothing. The most important acoustic control method is adding mass into the structure, such as a heavy dividing wall, which will usually reduce airborne sound transmission better than a light one.|$|E
50|$|There is dispute among players {{about whether}} comb {{material}} affects {{the tone of}} a harmonica.

Among those saying yes {{are those who are}} convinced by their ears. Few dispute, however, that comb surface smoothness and air-tightness when mated with the reedplates can greatly affect tone and playability. The main advantage of a particular comb material over another one is its durability. In particular, a wooden comb can absorb moisture from the player's breath and contact with the tongue. This can cause the comb to expand slightly, making the instrument uncomfortable to play, and to then contract, potentially compromising <b>air</b> <b>tightness.</b> Various types of wood and treatments have been devised to reduce the degree of this problem.|$|E

Therefore, the aim of this work is to improve the methodology for the calculation of energy efficiency of buildings, while taking into account the <b>air</b> <b>tightness</b> of the buildings. In order to achieve this aim, the sum energy consumption of investigated buildings was calculated, energy efficiency classes were determined, <b>air</b> <b>tightness</b> of the buildings was measured, and reasons for insufficient <b>air</b> <b>tightness</b> were analyzed. Investigation results show that the average value of <b>air</b> <b>tightness</b> of A energy efficiency class buildings is 0. 6 h− 1. The results of other investigated buildings, corresponding to B and C energy efficiency classes, show insufficient <b>air</b> <b>tightness</b> (the average n 50 value is 6 h− 1); herewith, energy consumption for heating is higher than calculated, according to the energy efficiency methodology.

40|$|The {{decision}} {{to write a}} dissertation on <b>air</b> <b>tightness</b> came from the authors experiences from {{living and working in}} both “draughty” and “airtight” houses. After living in a house that recently had been upgraded in terms of thermal insulation, it was still difficult to heat due to the amount of cold air seeping in through the buildings envelope. Also after working in houses that where advertised as “airtight” and seeing at firsthand how they were constructed and finished, the importance of <b>air</b> <b>tightness</b> in dwellings and how existing dwellings could be upgraded, came into question. The purpose of this dissertation is to investigate the affects of air leakage in dwellings and how it can be reduced in existing dwellings. This paper also demonstrates the difficulties in upgrading existing dwellings for <b>air</b> <b>tightness.</b> This paper concludes that there are very few examples of upgrading dwellings specifically for <b>air</b> <b>tightness.</b> It is usually carried out when upgrading the thermal insulation in a dwelling which makes it more cost effective.
