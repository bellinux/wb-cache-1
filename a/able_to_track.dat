5|$|By the summer, 1940, the Chain Home radar {{stations}} {{along the}} English and Scottish coasts was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>track</b> incoming aircraft from continental Europe {{at all but}} the lowest altitudes. The best detection altitude was 20,000 feet. Aircraft at this height could be detected over 100 miles away. To assess their identity, IFF (Identification Friend or Foe) could, {{by means of a}} distinctive blip on radar screens, distinguish German and British aircraft.|$|E
5|$|It is {{difficult}} to ascertain {{how much of the}} Prayer Book is actually Cranmer's personal composition. Generations of liturgical scholars have been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>track</b> down the sources that he used, including the Sarum Rite, writings from Hermann von Wied, and several Lutheran sources including Osiander and Justus Jonas. More problematic is determining how Cranmer worked on the book and with whom he worked. Despite the lack of knowledge of who might have helped him, however, he is given the credit for the editorship and the overall structure of the book.|$|E

5|$|Measurement of {{predictive}} visual tracking {{is being}} studied as a screening technique to identify mild traumatic brain injury. A head-mounted display unit with eye-tracking capability shows a moving object in a predictive pattern {{for the person}} to follow with their eyes.

5|$|The {{capture of}} the code books proved to provide a {{significant}} advantage for the Royal Navy. The Admiralty had recently created a deciphering department known as Room 40 to process intercepted German wireless signals. With the code books and cipher key, the British were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>track</b> the movements of most German warships; this information could {{be passed on to}} the Admiral John Jellicoe, the commander of the Grand Fleet. This allowed the British to ambush parts of or the entire German fleet on several occasions, most successfully at the Battles of Dogger Bank in January 1915 and Jutland in May 1916.|$|E

5|$|Black {{struggles to}} find {{anything}} useful while investigating the abduction. However, he begins to experience seemingly-psychic visions which lead him to believe she {{is being held in}} their former home. The police raid the address but find it empty; Black finds a polaroid of another house inside. He is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>track</b> down the address of this house, but goes alone this time. Reaching it, he finds Catherine in the basement, bound to a rafter. He goes to untie her but is blinded by a camera flash.

5|$|In {{the midst}} of the growing debate over Zeus' abilities, the US {{conducted}} its first high yield, high altitude tests – Hardtack Teak on 1 August 1958, and Hardtack Orange on 12 August. These demonstrated a number of previously unknown or underestimated effects, notably that nuclear fireballs grew to very large size and caused all of the air in or immediately below the fireball to become opaque to radar signals, an effect that became known as nuclear blackout. This was extremely worrying for any system like Zeus, which would not be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>track</b> warheads in or behind such a fireball, including those of the Zeus' own warheads.|$|E

The agents meet with Lauren at her home and after initially denying it, she admits to the incident but knows nothing about the murders. Upon leaving, the agents find their car going out of control on its own, leading it to crash into another car. At a repair shop, the car is found to have no evidence of tampering, but an electrical charge is detected within it.|$|E

Later, they learn that he is planning {{to pick up the}} diamonds from an ally (Willem Van Der Vegt) at a night club. While waiting to intercept him, Tony dances with Ziva both to help her get a better view of the area and to calm her agitated state of mind. Bodnar seems to appear, but when Ziva approaches him, she is stunned to see that it is Ilan's brother, Yaniv (Iddo Goldberg).|$|E
5|$|The crew are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>track</b> the Osaarian vessel, {{finding a}} large 1,000-year-old sphere {{constructed}} {{out of a}} single alloy. Archer and his away team discover a series of habitat modules containing most of the stolen items. The crew also finds a cargo manifest, and Ensign Sato soon learns they had also recently attacked a Xindi ship. Archer once again confronts Orgoth, demanding {{to know everything about}} the Xindi. He then drags the Osaarian to an airlock, initiating the decompression cycle. Orgoth soon relents, revealing they downloaded the Xindi database, while providing the access codes to their computer. When the alien ship returns, Mayweather maneuvers Enterprise close enough for Sato to download the bulk of it. Archer sends Orgoth back to his people.|$|E

5|$|When Garbage {{began to}} collate the {{material}} for Absolute Garbage, it transpired that the analog masters of their eponymous debut album had been lost. Neither of the band's record labels had them, and after further searching, the band established {{that none of}} the mastering facilities they had used had stored them either. Vig and audio engineer Billy Bush were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>track</b> down an archived, but rather incomplete and damaged, set of 16bit 44.1kHz safety DAT mixes. Despite the backups being far from an optimal situation, mastering engineer Emily Lazar at The Lodge in New York City was able to reverse engineer the missing songs from the damaged archive. Lazar used some alternate versions of the songs when completing the final master. Her assistant, Joe LaPorta, mastered and edited the remixes for the special edition.|$|E

5|$|A {{corporation}} called RX Tech excavates {{the crash}} site of a meteorite that impacted on Antarctica {{millions of years ago}} and finds strange Rapa Nui-like statues alongside the grave of one of HMS Beagle's sailors. Meanwhile, archaeologist-adventurer Lara Croft is searching for an artefact known as the Infada Stone in the ruins of an ancient Indian Hindu temple once inhabited by the Infada tribe. After taking the artefact from a researcher working for RX Tech, Lara is approached by RX Tech scientist Dr. Willard, who explains that polynesians came across a meteorite crater in Antarctica thousands of years ago and found that it held incredible power. Using rock from the meteorite, they crafted four crystalline artefacts, one of which is the Infada Stone. They then fled Antarctica for unknown reasons, but in the 19th century a group of sailors travelling with Charles Darwin came to Antarctica and rediscovered the artefacts. The four artefacts were then distributed across the globe. Dr. Willard has been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>track</b> the artefacts by using the diary of one of the sailors. Lara agrees to help him find the other three.|$|E
