5|$|At higher {{temperatures}} tellurium {{is sufficiently}} plastic to extrude. It melts at 449.51°C. Crystalline tellurium has a structure consisting of parallel infinite spiral chains. The bonding between adjacent atoms {{in a chain}} is covalent, but {{there is evidence of}} a weak metallic interaction between the neighbouring atoms of different chains. Tellurium is a semiconductor with <b>an</b> <b>electrical</b> conductivity of around 1.0S•cm−1 and a band gap of 0.32 to 0.38eV. Liquid tellurium is a semiconductor, with <b>an</b> <b>electrical</b> conductivity, on melting, of around 1.9 × 103S•cm−1. Superheated liquid tellurium is a metallic conductor.|$|E
5|$|For instance, pure diamond is <b>an</b> <b>electrical</b> insulator, but diamond with boron added is <b>an</b> <b>electrical</b> {{conductor}} (and, in some cases, a superconductor), {{allowing it}} {{to be used in}} electronic applications. Nitrogen impurities hinder movement of lattice dislocations (defects within the crystal structure) and put the lattice under compressive stress, thereby increasing hardness and toughness.|$|E
5|$|Germanium is a shiny grey-white solid. It has a {{density of}} 5.323 g/cm3 and is hard and brittle. It is mostly unreactive at room {{temperature}} but is slowly attacked by hot concentrated sulfuric or nitric acid. Germanium also reacts with molten caustic soda to yield sodium germanate Na2GeO3 and hydrogen gas. It melts at 938°C. Germanium is a semiconductor with <b>an</b> <b>electrical</b> conductivity of around 2 × 10−2S•cm−1 and a band gap of 0.67eV. Liquid germanium is a metallic conductor, with <b>an</b> <b>electrical</b> conductivity {{similar to that of}} liquid mercury.|$|E

5|$|Incidentally, the {{harmonic}} telegraph directly suggested to Bell {{the idea of}} the telephone.

5|$|Lightning is <b>an</b> <b>electrical</b> {{discharge}} {{that occurs}} in a thunderstorm. It {{can be seen in}} the form of a bright streak (or bolt) from the sky. Lightning occurs when <b>an</b> <b>electrical</b> charge is built up within a cloud, due to static electricity generated by supercooled water droplets colliding with ice crystals near the freezing level. When a large enough charge is built up, a large discharge will occur and can be seen as lightning.|$|E

5|$|A signal {{travelling}} along <b>an</b> <b>electrical</b> {{transmission line}} will be partly, or wholly, reflected {{back in the}} opposite direction when the travelling signal encounters a discontinuity in the characteristic impedance of the line, or if {{the far end of the}} line is not terminated in its characteristic impedance.

5|$|After its closure in 1917, the bay {{platform}} {{was converted}} into rooms for use, at various times, as offices, air-raid shelters, store rooms, <b>an</b> <b>electrical</b> sub-station and a war-time hostel.

Once the connection is made, the caller's voice is transformed to <b>an</b> <b>electrical</b> signal using a small microphone in the caller's handset.
