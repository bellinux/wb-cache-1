Concurrently, NSS <b>agents</b> realized they've been duped: the presumed dead IRIS <b>agents</b> at the mall crisis was actually the hostages. The true IRIS <b>agents</b> escaped and infiltrated the summit to kill all delegates. IRIS <b>agents</b> killed and replaced various security <b>agents</b> for a massacre. Unfortunately, it failed with Seung-hee's interference. She pretended to be an IRIS agent and used the confusion to stop them. This created mass panic as IRIS <b>agents</b> make their stand against all security forces. Ultimately, the SK president and NK forces survived the assault and Hyun-jun saved the day again.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The mobile <b>agent</b> {{security}} against malicious hosts {{is one of}} {{the most}} important subjects in mobile <b>agent</b> technology. An extended requirement for an <b>agent</b> security in different applications is to provide it with anonymity property in such a way that the <b>agent</b> can travel in the network without exposing its owner identity and its itinerary. For this purpose, an <b>agent</b> anonymity protocol is proposed to maintain the anonymity of the <b>agent</b> owner and the <b>agent</b> itinerary. The introduced anonymous <b>agent</b> is also applied to disarm the host against the <b>agent</b> instead of using an armed <b>agent,</b> that is, an <b>agent</b> equipped with protection mechanisms. The analytical discussion demonstrated that this protocol preserves the autonomy of the <b>agent</b> in choosing the migration path and is also resistant against known traffic analysis attacks in mobile <b>agent</b> systems with plausible assumption. Moreover, it is feasible and adjustable regarding the required level of anonymity. ...|$|R
