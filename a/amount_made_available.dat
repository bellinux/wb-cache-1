50|$|Gledden {{retired in}} 1900 and {{spent much time}} {{travelling}} with his wife before settling at Caulfield near Melbourne. After his wife died about 1921, Gleddon continued to travel, but kept his interest in Western Australia and {{spent a good deal}} of his time there. Gledden died at Perth on 5 November 1927, there were no children. He was a good business man and made money largely out of investing in land in Western Australia. His will provided that the whole of his estate, subject to three annuities, should go to the University of Western Australia to provide scholarships in applied science, beginning 10 years after his death. The <b>amount</b> <b>made</b> <b>available</b> to the university was about £55,000, and the income is used mainly to provide the Robert Gledden and Maud Gledden travelling fellowships of £750 a year. In addition there are Gledden studentships to enable engineers or surveyors to travel to other parts of Australia, and Gledden scholarships to assist students in engineering, surveying or the applied sciences generally. The Gledden Building in Perth was named in his honour.|$|E
50|$|Some $36 {{billion in}} Production Flexibility Contract {{payments}} made to farmers for contract crops for fiscal years 1996-2002 under Title I of the 1996 farm bill (P.L. 104-127), {{known as the}} Agricultural Market Transition Act (AMTA). The total <b>amount</b> <b>made</b> <b>available</b> for each fiscal year was specified in the Act and allocated to commodities each fiscal year using a set of percentages also specified in the Act. These percentages were based on CBO’s February 1995 baseline forecast of what deficiency payments {{would have been if}} provisions in effect for the 1995 crop had been extended. For example, for fiscal 1997, the total allocation for wheat was 26% of total annual payments of $5.385 billion, or $1.414 billion. The annual payment rate for wheat equaled total spending ($1.414 billion) divided by the sum of all individual wheat payment contract quantities for the year. As with other program commodities, an individual farm’s payment quantity equaled the farm’s program payment yield multiplied by 85% of the farm’s wheat contract acreage. Program yields under the 1996 Act were determined {{in the same manner as}} under the 1949 Act for 1995 crops. An individual farmer’s PFC payment was the payment quantity times the annual payment rate. The payment was made by September 30 of each of the fiscal years 1996 through 2002. Producers also could choose to receive 50% of the contract payment in December or January of the fiscal year. Farmers had near total planting flexibility on the contract acres (the exception being fruits and vegetables) as well as on the remainder of the farm. PFC contract payments were replaced by Direct and Counter-cyclical Program (DCP) payments beginning with crop year 2002 under the 2002 farm bill (P.L. 101-171, Sec. 1101-1108).|$|E
40|$|Four biomass materials, namely peach pips, pine wood, bamboo and Napier grass, and {{one example}} of {{chemical}} waste, lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF 6), were studied. The biomass types were selected because they were easily accessible locally. The LiPF 6 waste is solidified in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). Gasification of this solid is of interest to industry. Prior to the gasification studies, TGA-FTRI analyses were conducted on the biomass samples. This was done to study their thermal behaviour under nitrogen as well as under oxygen. The results indicated that, in general, pyrolysis of biomass takes place in three stages, namely hydration, active pyrolysis, and passive pyrolysis. These stages occur at different temperatures {{depending on the type}} of biomass as well as the heating rate used. The conversion efficiency of these materials is increased under oxygen, due to the fact that combustion takes place in the presence of oxygen, either partially or fully, depending on the <b>amount</b> <b>made</b> <b>available.</b> TGA results obtained under nitrogen were used to compute the kinetic parameters of each biomass material. Because their fluffy nature led to feed problems, bamboo and Napier grass were excluded from the plasma gasification experiments. Results obtained during the gasification of peach pips and pine wood indicated that conversion efficiency slightly increases with an increase in temperature. Feed rate seemed to have minimal effect on both conversion efficiency and gas concentration; the energy conversion efficiency did, however, improve. The conversion efficiencies obtained by TGA and by the plasma system, were roughly similar. Due to the higher temperatures, ~ 1000 °C, of the plasma reactor, the gaseous products obtained were predominantly carbon monoxide and hydrogen. On the other hand, carbon dioxide predominated in the TGA-FTIR experiments. Only a slight trace of monoxide was observed. Plasma treatment of PMMA encapsulated waste LiPF 6 also yielded carbon monoxide and hydrogen as main products. The energy conversion efficiency observed for the plasma process was 30 40 %. This value is ratio of the combustion enthalpy of syngas yield and the electrical energy input into the plasma torch. The main heat loss was via the torch anode. This may be corrected by an improved thermo-mechanical design. Dissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2017. Chemical EngineeringMScUnrestricte...|$|E
