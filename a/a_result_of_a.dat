In order to rectify this situation UN logisticians were forced to hastily create a plan as the need arose.|$|E

5|$|During the afternoon's {{practice}} session on Friday, June 17, 2005, Ralf Schumacher, driving for Toyota, crashed badly in Turn 13 of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway road course, apparently as <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> left-rear tyre failure. He {{was unable to}} continue racing, {{and was replaced by}} the team's test driver, Ricardo Zonta, {{for the rest of the}} weekend. Schumacher had crashed in the same spot as <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tyre failure the previous year, while driving for the Williams team. Turn 13 on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway road course is a high speed banked turn, unique in Formula One racing, which causes a greater than usual tyre loading. On June 18, Michelin reported that it did not understand why the tyres it had provided for its seven customer teams– BAR, McLaren, Red Bull, Renault, Sauber, Toyota, and Williams– had failed in this turn, and announced its intention to fly in tyres of a different specification from its Clermont-Ferrand headquarters. Unfortunately, the replacement tyres flown in, which were of the type used in the Spanish Grand Prix earlier that year, turned out to have the same problem when tested.|$|E
