500|$|This episode {{marked a}} change in the {{presentation}} of Black's [...] "flashback" [...] visions, a hallmark of the series. Previously they had been depicted with a series of rapid and vague images; director Wright felt that it would be beneficial to slow these down and linger on imagery for longer, [...] "so we could see <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> what was happening".|$|E

[...] "In the past, it was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> 'this {{is what you need}} to do, now go out and do it.'

500|$|The duet aria {{is written}} for soprano and alto voice: [...] "" [...] (Blessed Christians, enraptured flock, come, dwell with Jesus with thankfulness!). It is a da capo aria in triple time with long ritornello episodes. The musicologist Julian Mincham {{describes}} it as [...] "retaining <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> {{the spirit of the}} rustic dance". The Bach scholar Klaus Hofmann called it a passepied. The movement was probably already a pastorale in the secular model, and suits the image of the Good Shepherd and his flock. John Eliot Gardiner, who conducted the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage in 2000, believes that the music was actually danced to in the secular version heard in Köthen.|$|E

Fred Sablan – guitarist for Twiggy's side-project Goon Moon – joined the band in July, and in October Twiggy described the upcoming album as being [...] "almost done", saying: [...] "It's our best record yet. I mean, everyone always says that, but I think this is our best work so far. It's kind of like <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a punk rock Mechanical Animals, without sounding too pretentious." [...] Manson attested that its lyrical content would be [...] "more romantic" [...] yet [...] "self-abusive", and described its sonic elements as being [...] "suicide death metal".|$|E
500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} by {{television}} critics were mostly positive, calling it [...] "refreshing." [...] Ahsan Haque of IGN praised the episode's extended chicken fight scene, going on to note, [...] "Like every other encounter with the Giant Chicken, this was highly entertaining, incredibly creative and just the type of sequence the Family Guy needs more of." [...] In contrast, Brett Love of TV Squad found the chicken scene to be too long, stating, [...] "there are only 22 minutes per episode [...] Taking a quarter of that for the chicken fight is just ridiculous." [...] Love did enjoy the scenes involving Chris's time at Morningwood Academy, however, going on to mention that he [...] "would have liked to see <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> Chris and Carter bonding over Skull and Bones adventures." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite {{his success}} in {{advancing}} Nixon's career, Chotiner was respected, but was not universally popular among the Vice President's backers. Frank Jorgensen, one of Nixon's first backers in the Voorhis race, said of the attorney, [...] "I knew that Murray was very impatient with people who didn't have the IQ that he had. He had the habit of {{a man like that}} of tramping on them. He'd move ahead. He'd just leave the wreckage behind him, but he would get the job done." [...] Nixon family friend and Whittier College trustee Herman Perry stated, [...] "When Murray develops <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> the techniques of public relations, I {{will be one of the}} first to recognize it and one of the first to give him credit...

500|$|People writer Chuck Arnold {{wrote that}} Spears [...] "never really hit her old stride [...] {{there was a}} lot more {{strutting}} than real choreographic feats from [...] ". Jeff Montgomery of MTV both praised and dismissed Spears's performance saying, [...] "Yes, welcome to Britney's Circus, a big, huge, loud, funny, nonsensical three-ring affair... She looks great in her myriad of outfits, and she can still move with the best of them. [...] It's just, well, she's almost lost in the sheer hugeness of the production around her". Jane Stevenson of Toronto Sun gave Spears's performance three out of five stars stating there was [...] "so much was going on– there were also martial artists, bicyclists, etc.– there was no time to really assess Spears other than to note that she looked great. [...] She could lip-synch the words (one can assume) and strut around the stage well enough, but there was little in the way of genuine passion, joy, or excitement on her part". The Hollywood Reporters Craig Rosen claimed that [...] "in the end, Britney and company delivered an entertaining spectacle, but one couldn't help but wish that she would strip it all down and show <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> herself". Sean Daly of St. Petersburg Times summed up all the reviews by stating, [...] "When Britney, touring behind her new Circus album, plays the Times Forum, there will be as many people rooting for her success as her failure. [...] But in the end, we're all envious and thankful, jealous and applauding. We like them/us and hate them/us for the very same reasons".|$|E
500|$|... "Wet Hot Demonic Summer" [...] {{was written}} by Daniel Powell and {{directed}} by Aaron Augenblick. Series creator Devin Clark said that they planned on giving it a summer theme since they knew it would air in the summer. Clark further elaborated on the decision to incorporate summer and Harry Potter themes into the episode, stating: [...] "We went, 'alright, those are two little nuggets of ideas we can incorporate into that.' We can't be as relevant to pop culture as some other shows, but it just means we have <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a challenge of making jokes that {{are a little more}} evergreen and poking fun of the genre in a much broader spectrum." [...] Screenwriter Powell explained that it is difficult for the series to do [...] "topical stuff" [...] as it takes up to nine months to complete an episode, but they were {{aware of the fact that}} the Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 would premiere shortly after the episode was set to air. [...] "So it would seem like we were hyper-topical, even though we had a good nine months advance notice", he said. Powell said that they included famous wizards from many other sources, including The Lord of the Rings and The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. In an interview with Charles Webb of MTV, Clark elaborated: [...] "We make it a hodgepodge of the wizard references and obviously the main one is, and the most prominent one and the one that's most relevant to pop culture is the Harry Potter spoof that we've thrown in there.|$|E
500|$|The {{day before}} the operation, Pine Coffin and his staff began {{to plan for the}} mission. The twentynine Dakotas that were to {{transport}} the battalion would take off from Maison Blanche and follow the coast until they reached the harbour at Bône. The leading Dakota would then turn southeast and fly low over the airfield to ascertain its status. If it was unoccupied the paratroopers would be dropped onto the airfield, but if the Fallschirmjaeger were present then the Dakotas would drop the companies a mile away; there they would form up and launch an attack on the airfield. The planning was completed by 16:30, and at 20:00 the American pilots were briefed on the operation, which was briefly interrupted when a German aircraft flew over the area and dropped a stick of bombs. The aircraft took off at 08:30 the next day and experienced an uneventful flight to the airfield, although two aircraft experienced mechanical problems and ditched into the ocean, causing three casualties. The lead Dakota flew over the airfield, and after observing the airfield to be unoccupied, dropped its paratroopers, followed in succession by the remaining transport aircraft. The drop was reasonably accurate, with a few containers and paratroopers being dropped three miles from the airfield. Thirteen men were injured during the drop, primarily when they landed, and one was killed when he accidentally shot himself with his Sten gun. One officer was knocked unconscious during landing and remained so for the next four days, on occasion being heard to murmur [...] "I'll have <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> the turbot, waiter!". Unknown to the British force, their drop had been observed by a flight of German Junkers Ju 52 transport aircraft, carrying the battalion of Fallschirmjaegers; having seen that the airfield was already occupied, the aircraft turned back towards Tunis. When it had secured the airfield, the battalion came under attack from Stuka divebombers, and was initially defenceless. However, once No.6 Commando had secured Bône a number of Oerlikon antiaircraft guns were salvaged from sunken vessels in the port's harbour and these, in combination with a squadron of Spitfires that arrived on the evening of 11 November, were used to fend off future attacks. [...] The battalion held the airfield in conjunction with No.6 Commando until 15 November, when it withdrew and linked up with 'A' Company and the rest of 1st Parachute Brigade at Maison Blanche.|$|E

2500|$|The milieu is {{identified}} by the author as science fantasy. As L'Engle explains in her book The Rock That Is Higher: Story as Truth: [...] "If we limit ourselves to the possible and provable... we render ourselves incapable of change and growth, {{and that is something}} that should never end. If we limit ourselves to the age that we are, and forget all the ages that we have been, we diminish our truth." [...] Later in the same book, she further explains her use of the science fantasy genre: [...] "Writing A Wrinkle in Time... was my first effort in a genre now called 'science fantasy', and science fantasy is not far from fairy tale, that world which delves deep into the human psyche, struggling to find out at least <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> what we are all about." ...|$|E
2500|$|Smerage's mother {{learned of}} her son's {{expulsion}} {{when she opened}} Greenough's letter {{and the next day}} initiated a yearlong series of letters on his behalf. She spoke of her [...] "stricken home" [...] and her son's history of illness. Ultimately, she questioned the Court's entire approach: [...] "I feel now that you men could have done much good had you perhaps had a little less sense of justice and <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> the spirit of Jesus in your hearts." [...] Wolff's father asked the Dean to recognize that helping his son to reform was more important than punishment: [...] "I am taking the liberty of appealing to you, not in your official capacity, but as a man, to do what you can to assist him. You know all are subject to mistakes, and the blessing is in those who can aid and advise in correcting and saving rather than otherwise." ...|$|E
2500|$|This {{also leads}} to {{understanding}} a third feature, that fractals as mathematical equations are [...] "nowhere differentiable". In a concrete sense, this means fractals cannot {{be measured in}} traditional ways. To elaborate, in {{trying to find the}} length of a wavy non-fractal curve, one could find straight segments of some measuring tool small enough to lay end to end over the waves, where the pieces could get small enough to be considered to conform to the curve in the normal manner of measuring with a tape measure. But in measuring a wavy fractal curve such as the Koch snowflake, one would never find a small enough straight segment to conform to the curve, because the wavy pattern would always re-appear, albeit at a smaller size, essentially pulling <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> the tape measure into the total length measured each time one attempted to fit it tighter and tighter to the curve.|$|E
5000|$|Ben Bridwell {{described}} {{the sound of}} Cease to Begin, [...] "I guess the first record {{had some kind of}} country-ish leanings...I think there's maybe <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit <b>more</b> <b>of</b> that feeling on it, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> down-home...not so much indie rock." ...|$|R

2500|$|Fellow crime writer Anthony Berkeley Cox, writing {{under the}} nom de plume of Francis Iles, {{reviewed}} the novel in the 6 December 1957 issue of The Guardian, {{in which he}} confessed to being disappointed with the work: [...] "I have only pity for those poor souls who cannot enjoy the sprightly stories of Agatha Christie; but though sprightliness is {{not the least of}} this remarkable writer's qualities, there is another that we look for in her, and that is detection: genuine, steady, logical detection, taking us step by step nearer {{to the heart of the}} mystery. Unfortunately it is that quality that is missing in 4.50 from Paddington. The police never seem to find out a single thing, and even Miss Marples (sic) lies low and says nuffin' to the point until the final dramatic exposure. There is the usual small gallery of interesting and perfectly credible characters and nothing could be easier to read. But please, Mrs Christie, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> that incomparable detection next time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon parting with Interscope, Manson said [...] "a {{lot of the}} {{creative}} control on which my hands were tied [...] ", while stating that the band had been writing new material while touring their previous album.

Manson attested that its lyrical content would be [...] "more romantic" [...] yet [...] "self-abusive", and described its sonic elements as being [...] "suicide death metal". That April, Manson expressed interest in releasing the record in a different way from previous ones. Fred Sablan – bassist for Twiggy and Masters of Reality vocalist Chris Goss' project Goon Moon – joined the band in July.
