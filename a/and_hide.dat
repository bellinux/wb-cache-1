5|$|As {{it became}} {{apparent}} that, not only were conditions in the ghettos terrible (hunger, diseases, etc.), but that the Jews were being singled out for extermination at Nazi concentration camps, they increasingly tried to escape <b>and</b> <b>hide</b> {{in order to survive}} the war. Many Polish Gentiles concealed hundreds of thousands of their Jewish neighbors. Many of these efforts arose spontaneously from individual initiatives, but there were also organized networks dedicated to aiding the Jews.|$|E

The upper estimates of the Lyapunov dimension of self-excited <b>and</b> <b>hidden</b> attractors were obtained analytically. Comment: submitted to EP...|$|R
5|$|Adults have {{forewings}} {{that are}} yellowish brown {{in color and}} have a dark spot located {{in the center of}} their body.
