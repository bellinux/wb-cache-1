40|$|Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist {{therapy to}} induce medical {{castration}} {{has become the}} most common form of hormonal therapy for advanced and metastatic prostate cancer. When treatment is started, LHRH agonists initially stimulate the release of LH, causing a surge in serum testosterone that can precipitate a “flare” phenomenon or worsening of disease, particularly in patients with bone metastatic disease. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonism represents a newer approach to medical castration. <b>Abarelix</b> is a pure GnRH receptor antagonist that is devoid of any LHRH agonist activity. Results from 1 phase II and 3 phase III clinical trials demonstrate that <b>abarelix</b> produces medical castration more quickly and without causing testosterone surge, as compared with LHRH agonists with or without a nonsteroidal antagonist.

40|$|The {{last decade}} has seen {{explosive}} {{growth in the}} therapy of prostate cancer. Three areas of therapeutics are emerging: 1) new compounds with novel uses; 2) available compounds with new applications; and 3) new compounds applied to established indications. The novel compounds target specific receptor sites of cancer pathways and attack cancer cells with less effect on normal tissue. Earlyphase trials with compounds targeting the endothelin-A and EGF receptors have shown encouraging results in hormone-refractory prostate cancer. In addition, the Early Prostate Cancer Trial of over 8000 men is currently underway to determine the benefit of adjuvant androgen ablation with bicalutamide in men with localized prostate cancer. Early results show a significant 42 % reduction in the progression of the disease in the bicalutamide treatment arm. Further, in large, phase 3 clinical trials in patients needing androgen ablation, the GnRH antagonist <b>abarelix</b> caused no testosterone surge and demonstrated a significantly more rapid decline in serum testosterone to the castrate level than did an LHRH agonist analogue. <b>Abarelix</b> should thus have application as a monotherapy in patients who need a rapid onset of action or {{are at high risk}} of complications from the clinical flare seen with LHRH agonists. <b>Abarelix</b> also uniquely caused a sustained decline in serum FSH levels, which have been shown in vitro to stimulate prostate cancer cell growth.

40|$|We {{describe}} the pharmacological profile in rats and monkeys of degarelix (FE 200486), {{a member of}} a new class of long-acting gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonists. At single subcutaneous injections of 0. 3 to 10 microg/kg in rats, degarelix produced a dose-dependent suppression of the pituitary-gonadal axis as revealed by the decrease in plasma luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone levels. Duration of LH suppression increased with the dose: in the rat, significant suppression of LH lasted 1, 2, and 7 days after a single subcutaneous injection of degarelix at 12. 5, 50, or 200 microg/kg, respectively. Degarelix fully suppressed plasma LH and testosterone levels in the castrated and intact rats {{as well as in the}} ovariectomized rhesus monkey for more than 40 days after a single 2 -mg/kg subcutaneous injection. In comparative experiments, degarelix showed a longer duration of action than the recently developed GnRH antagonists <b>abarelix,</b> ganirelix, cetrorelix, and azaline B. The in vivo mechanism of action of degarelix was consistent with competitive antagonism, and the prolonged action of degarelix was paralleled by continued presence of radioimmunoassayable degarelix in the general circulation. In contrast to cetrorelix and similarly to ganirelix and <b>abarelix,</b> degarelix had only weak histamine-releasing properties in vitro. These results demonstrate that the unique and favorable pharmacological properties of degarelix make it an ideal candidate for the management of sex steroid-dependent pathologies requiring long-term inhibition of the gonadotropic axis...|$|E

40|$|It is well {{recognized}} that testosterone {{has a number}} of untoward effects on prostatic carcinoma and that castration is associated with significant tumor shrinkage and resolution of symptoms of advanced prostatic carcinoma. Approaches to hormonal therapy have evolved significantly over the last several decades. Initially castration was utilized, which provided effective reduction of testicular androgens, but with adverse psychological factors. The next approach was utilization of diethylstilbestrol, but with significant cardiovascular toxicity in higher doses. The development of the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists provided an improvement in pharmacologic castration; however, they are associated with a transient testosterone surge and the potential for exacerbation of clinical manifestations of advanced prostate carcinoma (the so-called “testosterone flare”). Recently, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonists have been investigated. <b>Abarelix</b> is a pure GnRH antagonist that blocks the anterior pituitary receptor, resulting in prompt and significant reduction not only of luteinizing hormone but also follicle-stimulating hormone. This results in castrate levels of testosterone while avoiding the testosterone surge...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Manipulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis via {{androgen}} deprivation {{therapy has}} been in use since the 1940 ’s {{for the treatment of}} advanced prostate cancer. Androgen deprivation may be achieved via surgical castration or pharmacological castra-tion. Pharmacological castration is preferred by patients due to its decreased psychological impact on body image and potential revers-ibility. Gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists have been a mainstay in androgen suppression. Recently degarelix, a GnRH antagonist, has been proven to be as effective and not inferior to GnRH analogues, such as leuprolide, in a phase III trial. Degarelix was found to have no initial testosterone surge, reach castrate levels of testosterone by day three, have no testosterone microsurges, have the ability to keep follicle stimulating hormone suppressed and have lower histaminogenic potency compared to its predecessor <b>abarelix.</b> A review of the pharmacokinetics, clinical trial findings, safety and ongoing debates as to the best application of degarelix is presented...|$|E
40|$|Gonadotropin-releasing hormone {{agonists}} and antagonists provide androgen-deprivation therapy for prostate cancer. Unlike agonists, gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonists {{have a direct}} mode of action to block pituitary gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptors. There are two licensed gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonists, degarelix and <b>abarelix.</b> Of these, degarelix is the more extensively studied and has been documented {{to be more effective}} than the well-established, first-line agonist, leuprolide, in terms of substantially faster onset of castration, faster suppression of prostate-specific antigen, no risk for testosterone surge or clinical flare, and improved prostate-specific antigen progression-free survival, suggesting a delay in castration resistance. Other than minor injection-site reactions, degarelix is generally well tolerated, without systemic allergic reactions and with most adverse events consistent with androgen suppression or the underlying condition. In conclusion, degarelix provides a rational, first-line androgen-deprivation therapy suitable for the treatment of prostate cancer, with faster onset of castration than with agonists, and no testosterone surge. Furthermore, data suggest that degarelix improves disease control compared with leuprolide, and might delay the onset of castration-resistant disease. In view of these clinical benefits and the lack of need for concomitant anti-androgen treatment, gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonists might replace gonadotropin-releasing {{hormone agonists}} as first-line androgen-deprivation therapy in the future. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|An {{update on}} the use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonists in {{prostate}} cancer Laurent Boccon-Gibod, Egbert van der Meulen and Bo-Eric Persson Abstract: Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the main treatment approach in advanced prostate cancer and in recent years has primarily involved the use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists. However, despite their efficacy, GnRH agonists have several drawbacks associated with their mode of action. These include an initial testosterone surge and testosterone microsurges on repeat administration. GnRH antagonists provide an alter-native approach to ADT with a more direct mode of action that involves immediate blockade of GnRH receptors. Antagonists produce a more rapid suppression of testosterone (and prostate-specific antigen [PSA]) without a testosterone surge or microsurges and appear to offer an effective and well tolerated option for the hormonal treatment of prostate cancer. Comparisons with GnRH agonists have shown GnRH antagonists to be at least as effective in achieving and maintaining castrate testosterone levels in patients with prostate cancer. Furthermore, with antagonists, the lack of an initial testosterone surge (which may cause clinical flare) may allow more rapid relief of symptoms related to prostate cancer, avoid the need for concomitant antiandrogens to prevent clinical flare (so avoiding any antiandrogen-associated adverse events) and allow GnRH antagonist use in patients with high tumour burden and/or acute problems such as spinal cord compression. Although several antagonists have been investi-gated, only degarelix and <b>abarelix</b> are currently available for clinical use in prostate cancer. Currently, degarelix is the most extensively studied and widely available agent in this class. Degarelix is one of a newer generation of antagonists which, in a comprehensive and ongoing clinical development programme, has been shown to provide rapid, profound and sustained testosterone suppression without the systemic allergic reactions associated with earlier antagonists.

40|$|A {{series of}} antagonists of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) {{of the general}} formula Ac-D 2 Nal-D 4 Cpa-D 3 Pal-Ser- 4 Aph/ 4 Amf(P) -D 4 Aph/D 4 Amf(Q) -Leu-ILys-Pro-DAla-NH 2 was synthesized, characterized, and {{screened}} for duration of inhibition of luteinizing hormone release in a castrated male rat assay. Selected analogues were tested in a reporter gene assay (IC 50 and pA 2) and an in vitro histamine release assay. P and Q contain urea/carbamoyl functionalities designed to increase potential intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonding opportunities for structural stabilization and peptide/receptor interactions, respectively. These substitutions resulted in analogues with increased hydrophilicity and a lesser propensity to form gels in aqueous solution than azaline B [Ac-D 2 Nal-D 4 Cpa-D 3 Pal-Ser- 4 Aph(Atz) -D 4 Aph(Atz) -Leu-ILys-Pro-DAla-NH 2 with Atz = 3 '-amino- 1 H- 1 ', 2 ', 4 '-triazol- 5 '-yl, 5], {{and in some cases}} they resulted in a significant increase in duration of action after subcutaneous (s. c.) administration. Ac-D 2 Nal-D 4 Cpa-D 3 Pal-Ser- 4 Aph(L-hydroorotyl) -D 4 Aph(carbamoyl) -Leu-ILys-Pro-DAla-NH 2 (acetate salt is FE 200486) (31) and eight other congeners (20, 35, 37, 39, 41, 45 - 47) were identified that exhibited significantly longer duration of action than acyline [Ac-D 2 Nal-D 4 Cpa-D 3 Pal-Ser- 4 Aph(Ac) -D 4 Aph(Ac) -Leu-ILys-Pro-DAla-NH 2] (6) when administered subcutaneously in castrated male rats at a dose of 50 microg in 100 microL of phosphate buffer. No correlation was found between retention times on a C 18 reverse phase column using a triethylammonium phosphate buffer at pH 7. 0 (a measure of hydrophilicity) or affinity in an in vitro human GnRH report gene assay (pA 2) and duration of action. FE 200486 was selected for preclinical studies, and some of its properties were compared to those of other clinical candidates. In the intact rat, ganirelix, <b>abarelix,</b> azaline B, and FE 200486 inhibited plasma testosterone for 1, 1, 14, and 57 days, respectively, at 2 mg/kg s. c. in 5 % mannitol (injection volume = 20 microL). Based on the information that 31, 33, 35 and 37 were significantly shorter acting than acyline or azaline B after intravenous administration (100 microg/rat), we surmised that the very long duration of action of the related FE 200486 (for example) was likely due to unique physicochemical properties such as solubility in aqueous milieu, comparatively low propensity to form gels, and ability to diffuse at high concentrations {{in a manner similar to}} that described for slow release formulations of peptides. Indeed, in rats injected s. c. with FE 200486 (2 mg/kg), plasmatic concentrations of FE 200486 remained above 5 ng/mL until day 41, and the time after which they dropped below 3 ng/mL and plasma LH levels started rising until full recovery was reached at day 84 with levels of FE 200486 hovering around 1 ng/mL.
