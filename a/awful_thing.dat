500|$|Shortly {{after this}} episode was broadcast, NBC {{announced}} {{their decision to}} cancel Awake, due to declining ratings, although NBC still decided to air the remaining two episodes in the show's original time slot. Isaacs found [...] "Say Hello to My Little Friend" [...] {{the most difficult to}} shoot, and had to imagine an <b>awful</b> <b>thing</b> happening to his family. It was filmed in Los Angeles, California, and continued and introduced key thematic elements to the series.|$|E
500|$|The film's most-quoted line of dialogue, {{spoken by}} Octave, is [...] "You see, in this world, {{there is one}} <b>awful</b> <b>thing,</b> {{and that is that}} {{everyone}} has his reasons." [...] Renoir's sentiment of objective humanism for the film's characters is articulated by Octave's remark and shows his empathy for the people he was simultaneously criticizing. Richard Roud praised Renoir's role in the film, observing that Renoir's honesty compelled him to include his own role in his social criticism: [...] "he did not wish to stand outside. And Renoir/Octave serves as the standard against which reality and fiction can be measured." [...] In his original outline for the film, Renoir said he intended all the characters to be sincere and that the film would have no villains.|$|E
500|$|Those in the {{lifeboats}} were {{horrified to}} {{hear the sound of}} what Lawrence Beesley called [...] "every possible emotion of human fear, despair, agony, fierce resentment and blind anger mingled– I am certain of those– with notes of infinite surprise, as though each one were saying, 'How is it possible that this <b>awful</b> <b>thing</b> is happening to me? That I should be caught in this death trap? Jack Thayer compared it to the sound of [...] "locusts on a summer night", while George Rheims, who jumped moments before Titanic sank, described it as [...] "a dismal moaning sound which I won't ever forget; it came from those poor people who were floating around, calling for help. It was horrifying, mysterious, supernatural." ...|$|E

500|$|President Clinton {{stated that}} after seeing images of babies being {{pulled from the}} wreckage, he was [...] "beyond angry" [...] and wanted to [...] "put [...] fist through the television". Clinton and his wife Hillary {{requested}} that aides talk to child care specialists about how {{to communicate with the}} children regarding the bombing. President Clinton spoke to the nation three days after the bombing, saying: [...] "I don't want our children to believe something terrible about life and the future and grownups in general because of this <b>awful</b> <b>thing...</b> most adults are good people who want to protect our children in their childhood {{and we are going to}} get through this". On April 22, 1995, the Clintons spoke in the White House with over 40federal agency employees and their children, and in a live nationwide television and radio broadcast, addressed their concerns.|$|E
500|$|During {{the run of}} Sunset Boulevard at the West End's Adelphi Theatre in 1995, Paige {{discovered}} a lump in her breast, prompting her to consult her doctor, who at first reassured her {{there was nothing to}} be concerned about. She returned twice, and her doctor subsequently sent her for tests that confirmed the lump was cancerous, nine months after she discovered it. Continuing her role in the production Paige did not miss a show, and stated, [...] "When I did the show I became very emotional. Some of the lyrics suddenly took on an entirely different meaning. Words like, 'as if we never said goodbye' became more real". [...] Paige went in for day surgery on a Sunday due to her theatre commitments, had five years of medical treatment and completed a radiation programme. She spoke for the first time of her encounter with breast cancer in a 2004 interview, and has since described the period as [...] "the most <b>awful</b> <b>thing</b> that's happened to me in my life".|$|E
500|$|Steph {{appeared}} to [...] "finally [...] happiness" [...] when {{she fell in}} love with Max Cunningham (Matt Littler). Although attracted to her, Max initially resisted Steph as he believed her to be a [...] "ditzy, air-headed blonde", only interested in [...] "bad boys." [...] When his younger brother Tom (Ellis Hollins) developed a crush on her, the [...] "kind, sensitive way" [...] Steph handled it altered his impression. Littler explained, [...] "Max begins to realise there's more to her than her looks. He begins to think she's actually really nice and they become friends." [...] Littler quit the series in 2008, and producers planned his exit around Max's wedding to Steph. He was killed off on their wedding day, as he pulled Tom out of the path of a car. Before she filmed the aftermath of Max's death, Stenson listened to depressing music to reach her character's bereaved mindset. Stenson believed it was a mistake to kill Max off, and [...] "such an <b>awful</b> <b>thing</b> to happen to Steph", until she received [...] "amazing feedback" [...] about the storyline. In the aftermath, Tom asked Steph to be his mother, in a scene that then-executive producer Bryan Kirkwood deemed his favourite of the year. The interaction between the two was intended to represent [...] "what Hollyoaks is all about - lots of heart, relationships, friendships, love and loss." [...] Kirkwood praised Stenson's performance throughout the storyline, particularly during in that scene.|$|E

5000|$|Ziva is scripted {{as someone}} who [...] "has had to do <b>awful</b> <b>things</b> and watch <b>awful</b> <b>things</b> in her life"; she has [...] "seen 12-year-old suicide bombers in Israel" [...] and gone hungry long enough to resort to eating maggots. In the third season, she recounts an {{incident}} in which {{one of her friends}} from Mossad had been beheaded after infiltrating a Hamas cell in Ramallah; Hamas terrorists sent his head back on the overnight express, leading her to view captivity as worse than death.
