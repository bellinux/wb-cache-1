40|$|New {{questions}} in a changing economy demands development of both contemporary and historical national accounts. One such question concerns economic and environmental relationships. From a national accounting perspective this issue has been approached in terms of environmental accounting. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate how proposals for integrated environmental and economic accounting can be used for an extension of the Historical National Accounts for Sweden and for examining the long-term relationship between economic growth and environmental degradation and resource depletion. This issue is approached through methodological considerations and estimates of iron ore and timber depletion and discharge of pollutants. The conclusions are that it is possible to construct environmental historical national accounts, but that the lack of historical data and theoretical difficulties cause a high level of abstraction and other problems concerning the series. The empirical investigations show that the 19 th century can be considered a period of depletion intensive growth. Furthermore, there seems to be evidence of a correlation between changes in the natural resource net prices and previous periodizations of Swedish economic development. Concerning pollutants, the analyses shows an increase of the <b>aggregated</b> <b>discharges</b> until the late 1960 s. However, the pollution intensity of growth has fallen throughout the period, possibly in a pattern of long trend periods. digitalisering@um...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{nervous system}} uses two basic types of formats for {{encoding}} information. The parameters of many sensory �and some premotor) signals {{are represented by}} the pattern of activity among an array of neurons {{each of which is}} optimally responsive to a di€erent parameter value. This type of code is commonly referred to as a place code. Motor commands, in contrast, use rate coding: the desired force of a muscle is speci®ed as a monotonic function of the <b>aggregate</b> rate of <b>discharge</b> across all of its motor neurons. Generating movements based on sensory information often requires converting signals from a place code to a rate code. In this paper I discuss three possible models for how the brain does this. ...|$|R
40|$|After its formation, a rill {{may remain}} {{in the field for}} months, often {{receiving}} lower flow rates than the formative discharge. The objective of this work was to evaluate the rill flow transport capacity of soil <b>aggregates</b> at <b>discharges</b> unable to erode the rill, and to analyse the influence of the rill macro-roughness on this transport process. A non-erodible rill was built in which roughness was reproduced in detail. In order to assess only the rill macroroughness, a flat channel with a similar micro-roughness to that in the rill replica was built. Rill and channel experiments were carried out at a slope of 8 degrees and at six discharges (8. 3 x 10 (- 5) to 5. 2 x 10 (- 4) m(3) s(- 1)) in the rill, and eight discharges (1. 6 x 10 (- 5) to 5. 2 x 10 (- 4) m(3) s(- 1)) in the channel. Non-erodible aggregates of three sizes (1 - 2, 3 - 5 and 5 - 10 mm) were released at the inlet of the rill/channel. The number of aggregates received at the outlet was registered. The number and position of the remaining aggregates along the rill/channel were also determined. The rill flow was a major sediment transport mechanism only during the formation of the rill, as during that period the power of the flow was great enough to overcome the influence of the macro-roughness of the rill bed. At lower discharges the transport capacity in the previously formed rill was significantly less than that in the flat channel under similar slope and discharge. This was determined to be due to local slowing of flow velocities at the exit of rill pools. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we provide a ® eld account of {{some aspects of}} the {{behavioural}} biology of Goniosoma longipes (Roewer), a harvestman which commonly occurs in caves in South-east Brazil. During daytime, solitary and aggregated individuals can be found resting on the cave walls. Just after sunset, however, many individuals leave the cave to forage for live and dead arthropods. Foraging individuals return to the cave before dawn. Aggregations of G. longipes contain on average 34 individuals (range 7 ± 200), and the groups are usually found close to the water source and away from the cave entrance. The main predators of G. longipes are the spider Ctenus fasciatus Mello-LeitaÄ o (Ctenidae) and the opossum Philander opossum (L.) (Didelphidae). Upon disturbance solitary and aggregated individuals may either ¯ ee, or drop from the cave wall or vegetation. The harvestmen can also release a repugnatory liquid upon manipulation, and <b>aggregated</b> individuals collectively <b>discharge</b> this secretion toward the aggressor before ¯ eeing. The activity schedule of G. longipes shows that individuals need to leave the cave periodically to forage, and therefore the population can be considered trogloxene. Data on the food items collected by G. longipes indicate that the harvestman is a generalist predator which also feeds on dead animal matter. Gregarious behaviour is considered relatively common among harvestmen and has been interpreted in several ways. We suggest that gregarious behaviour in G. longipes may be related with the choice of more suitable microconditions in the cave habitat and/or with group chemical defence...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Under the {{provisions}} of the Affordable Care Act, insurance coverage will markedly increase with the Congressional Budgetary Office estimating the number of insured to increase by approximately 13 million in 2014 and 25 million in 2016. However, approximately 31 million non-elderly US citizens are expected to remain without health insurance in 2016. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) remains a source of significant morbidity and mortality, as well as cost to society. No prior studies have examined temporal rates of uninsured among patients presenting with an AMI using a nationally representative database. Hypothesis: We tested the hypothesis that the proportion of uninsured individuals with AMI and cost of uninsured to society will vary by year. Methods: We used the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS), which contains estimates from approximately 8 million hospital visits and information related to number of <b>discharges,</b> <b>aggregate</b> charges, and principal diagnoses of all patients discharged in the US. We calculated the percentage of acute myocardial infarction by insurance status, and the sum of all charges of hospital stays in the US adjusted for inflation. Results: The cost to society due to acute myocardial infarction in the uninsured increased substantially from 1997 to 2012, with total cost in 1997 of $ 852, 596, 272 and $ 3, 446, 893, 954 in 2012 after adjustment for inflation. In addition, although rates of AMI decreased in the general population (from 268. 6 / 100, 000 individuals in 1997 to 193. 8 / 100, 000 individuals in 2012), the proportion of individuals with AMI who were uninsured increased (from 3. 83 % in 1997 to 7. 37 % in 2012). Conclusions: The proportion of those experiencing AMI who are uninsured is rising, as is cost to society. It remains to be seen what the effects of expanding health insurance will have on the rate of AMI as well as proportion of AMI represented by the uninsured...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} achieve the goals of 'Sustainable Development', {{alternative}} (secondary) materials are being increasingly used as bulk-fill aggregate within pavement construction as substitutes for traditional aggregates. This finds an end-use for stockpiles of industrial by-products (and hence the allowing the land on which they stand to be reclaimed for other uses) and protects finite, natural resources which they replace from over-extraction. Previously, there has been very little research concerned with the leaching of contaminants from alternative materials in pavement construction and the subsequent risks to water bodies from pavement drainage. It is this topic which is addressed here. Two flow regimes within a pavement have been studied in order to predict contaminant movement: (1) vertical flow through the aggregate and pavement and then vertically through the natural subgrade to ground water below and (2) horizontal flow through the <b>aggregate</b> to be <b>discharged</b> through pavement sides drains. Using these analyses a generic user-friendly risk assessment guide by which contractors may assess an aggregate prior to use is presented. A case-study is provided to illustrate {{some of the issues}} of concern. Guidelines in the risk assessment guide recommend the suitability of different physical parameters of a potential aggregate at a proposed pavement construction site for both water flow directions. If the subgrade at the site does not allow sorption by the soil to enable any contaminants in vertical flow to be below Water Quality Standards (WQS), the use of a geotextile clay liner to further increase sorption is recommended. If the concentrations of contaminants in water discharged from side drains is not below WQS for horizontal flow, guidelines determine whether the site rainfall and surface runoff allow sufficient dilution. In most situations alternative materials appear to be acceptable for use if pavement construction is on clay subgrades, with an exception of sites where the subgrades are shallower than those recommended or where they are close to areas of higher sensitivity, such as those in close proximity to protected groundwater.

40|$|As a {{consequence}} of climate change, increased precipitation in winter and longer periods of decreased precipitation in summer are expected to cause more frequent episodes of very high or very low river discharge in the Netherlands. To study the impact of such extreme river discharge conditions on water quality, toxicity profiles and pollutant profiles were determined of suspended particulate matter (SPM) collected from Rivers Meuse and Rhine. Archived (1993 - 2003) and fresh (2009 - 2011) SPM samples were selected from the Dutch annual monitoring program of the national water bodies (MWTL), representing episodes with river discharge conditions ranging from very low to regular to very high. SPM extracts were tested in a battery of in vitro bioassays for their potency {{to interact with the}} androgen receptor (AR), the estrogen receptor (ER), the arylhydrocarbon receptor (AhR), and the thyroid hormone transporter protein transthyretin (TTR). SPM extracts were further tested for their mutagenic potency (Ames assay) and their potency to inhibit bacterial respiration (Vibrio fischeri bioluminescence assay). Target-analyzed pollutant concentrations of the SPM samples and additional sample information were retrieved from a public database of MWTL results. In vitro toxicity profiles and pollutant profiles were analyzed in relation to discharge conditions and in relation to each other using correlation analysis and multivariate statistics. Compared to regular discharge conditions, composition of SPM during very high River Meuse and Rhine discharges shifted to more coarse, sandy, organic carbon (OC) poor particles. On the contrary, very low discharge led to a shift to more fine, OC rich material, probably dominated by algae. This shift was most evident in River Meuse, which is characterized by almost stagnant water conditions during episodes of drought. During such episodes, SPM extracts from River Meuse demonstrated increased potencies to inhibit bacterial respiration and to compete with thyroid hormone to bind to TTR, possibly due to the presence of fycotoxins. Meanwhile concentrations of polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs) in SPM were also increased. Very high River Meuse discharges on the other hand corresponded to increased androgenic and AhR agoniztic responses, which coincided with increased PAH levels and PAH-related in vivo risk estimates (i. e. multi-substance potentially affected fraction of species; msPAF). In River Rhine, very high discharges also corresponded to increasing androgenic potencies in SPM. Concentrations and corresponding msPAF values of PAHs (and metals), however, decreased with very high discharges in River Rhine in contrast to River Meuse. Mutagenicity was observed for SPM extracts from River Rhine collected during all discharge conditions, except during regular <b>discharge.</b> <b>Aggregated</b> toxicity index values, which were useful to identify toxicity profiles deviating from the generally observed pattern, did not correlate with river discharges, probably due to opposite effects of discharge conditions on different bioassay responses. In conclusion, SPM quality and related in vivo risk estimates changed during very low or very high discharge conditions but the changes were specific for the different toxic endpoints and pollutants in the different rivers. Moreover, bioassay responses to a series of consecutively collected samples from River Rhine during the Christmas flood of 1993 indicated that SPM quality is variable within a single episode of extreme discharge...|$|R
