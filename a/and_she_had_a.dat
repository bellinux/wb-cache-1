John English was her master <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> crew of five men.|$|E
5|$|Charles and Zita were crowned in Budapest on 30 December 1916. Following the {{coronation}} {{there was a}} banquet, but after that the festivities ended, as the emperor and empress thought it wrong to have prolonged celebrations {{during a time of}} war. At the beginning of the reign, Charles was more often than not away from Vienna, so he had a telephone line installed from Baden (where Charles's military headquarters were located) to the Hofburg. He called Zita several times a day whenever they were separated. Zita had some influence on her husband and would discreetly attend audiences with the Prime Minister or military briefings, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> special interest in social policy. However, military matters were the sole domain of Charles. Energetic and strong-willed, Zita accompanied her husband to the provinces and to the front, as well as occupying herself with charitable works and hospital visits to the war-wounded.|$|E

5|$|In late 1952, the National Trust {{moved the}} {{collection}} of keyboard instruments to Fenton House, and {{the family moved to}} Brondesbury Road, and then, in 1953, to a house they bought in Oxgate Gardens. Robert worked for the BBC as a studio manager for The Goon Show and the BBC World Service, and then for EMI, where he was involved with the development of stereophonic sound and the LP record. Her health deteriorated after Stephen's birth, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> hysterectomy. Her aunt Phyl took care of the children while she recovered. In 1955, her husband, unable to reconcile his lifestyle with his homosexuality, returned to the United States, and she became a single mother. She returned to work, initially in a biscuit factory, and then in a series of clerical jobs.|$|E
5|$|Sinop {{was named}} after the Russian victory in the Battle of Sinop in 1853. She was built by the Russian Steam Navigation Company (RoPIT) at Sevastopol. She was laid down in late June 1883, {{launched}} on 1 June 1887, and completed in 1889. Sinop began her trials {{in the middle of}} 1889 <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> boiler accident the following year that killed eight and severely burned 10 more. Her machinery was upgraded between 1899 and May 1904 with 20 new Belleville water-tube boilers, but the ship suffered a boiler explosion in 1903 that left seven sailors badly burned. Plans for a radical reconstruction were made to be done while she was docked for replacement boilers. It involved cutting her down by one deck and replacing her armament with two twin-gun turrets equipped with 12-inch 40-caliber guns and ten 6-inch 45-caliber guns between the turrets in an armored citadel that used Krupp armor. However, this proved to be too expensive and was cancelled.|$|E
25|$|On 27 January 1794 Tarleton and Gilbody {{received}} a new letter of marque. Now she carried slightly fewer guns, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> crew of 36 men, {{half the size}} of her earlier crew, suggesting that she had stopped privateering.|$|E

Langtry later had a second Cesarewitch winner with Yentoi, and a third place with Raytoi. An imported horse from New Zealand called Uniform, won the Lewes Handicap for her.|$|E

25|$|Hepburn met {{her second}} husband, Italian {{psychiatrist}} Andrea Dotti, on a Mediterranean cruise {{with friends in}} June 1968. She believed she would have more children and possibly stop working. They married on 18 January 1969; their son, Luca Dotti, was born on 8 February 1970. While pregnant with Luca in 1969, Hepburn was more careful, resting for months before delivering the baby via caesarean section. She {{wanted to have a}} third child, but had another miscarriage in 1974. Dotti was unfaithful <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> romantic relationship with actor Ben Gazzara during the filming of the 1979 movie Bloodline.

The play toured Hastings, Eastbourne, Littlehampton and Brighton, before opening for a short run at the St. James Theatre. During her career, more than 400 different postcards with Jay's image were issued.|$|E
25|$|In 1950, Lawrence's {{business}} manager and attorney Fanny Holtzmann {{was looking for}} a new property for her client when the 1944 Margaret Landon book Anna and the King of Siam was sent to her by the William Morris agent who represented Landon. He thought a stage adaptation of the book would be an ideal vehicle for the actress. Holtzmann agreed, but proposed a musical version would be better. Lawrence wanted Cole Porter to write the score, but when he proved to be unenthused by the suggestion, Holtzmann sent the book to Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II. Rodgers initially demurred because he felt Lawrence's vocal range was limited <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> tendency to sing flat. But he realised the story had strong potential, and the two men agreed to write what ultimately became The King and I.|$|E

25|$|Through her back-story {{we learn}} that her {{religious}} vows didn't stop her physical urges, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> relationship with an evil aristocrat, Egidio, who pushed her to become his accomplice {{in the murder of}} a nun: this is her tormenting secret. The principal female characters, Agnese and Lucia, meet Gertrude (The Nun of Monza) while escaping from the villain Don Rodrigo. They shelter in her convent, looking for hospitality. Gertrude becomes close to Lucia. Egidio asks her to help him to kidnap Lucia on behalf of the bandit Innominato, who is working for Rodrigo. She at first refuses, then gives in, and later confesses her crimes. Her decision is difficult for her, emphasizing Manzoni's view of her as a weak tool of evil, unable to resist threats and temptations, but basically not cruel. Later in the novel, at the end of Chapter 37, Lucia learns of Gertrude's repentance, confession of guilt, and consequent sentence.|$|E
25|$|Jane Emily Goward {{was born}} in Wakefield in Yorkshire in 1964, the sixth of ten {{children}} of a dentist. When she was aged 11, the family emigrated to Australia but returned after three years. In 1990, Tomlinson applied to study Mathematics at the University of Leeds. However, when she found a lump in her breast and had a lumpectomy, she enrolled instead at Leeds General Infirmary and trained as a radiographer. By this time, she had married Mike Tomlinson and had two daughters, Suzanne and Rebecca. They later had a son, Steven. Qualifying in 1993, Tomlinson later studied to postgraduate level and became a paediatric radiographer. Three years after having a lumpectomy the cancer returned <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> second mastectomy, and two rounds of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In 2000, Jane Tomlinson {{was told that the}} cancer had spread to her bones and lungs, and was given about 12 months to live.|$|E
25|$|She was {{a family}} orientated character, {{particularly}} opposed to change and determined {{to hold on to}} the ever-diminishing traditions of the East End. Most of her storylines were family based, which included various feuds, most notably with Pat Wicks (Pam St. Clement), the ex-wife of her son who showed up in Walford in 1986. Various scandals and hardships were thrown at the character and her family, which she stoically battled through in order to keep the close-knit family that she presided over, together. The character was also used for comedy, most regularly with the other older characters, Dot Cotton (June Brown) and Ethel Skinner (Gretchen Franklin), <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> tendency to take to her bed and feign sickness if she didn't get her own way. Her relationship with son-in-law Arthur (Bill Treacher) was another on-going sub-plot often used for comical effect — Lou portraying the stereotypical nagging mother-in-law and Arthur being the main protagonist for most of her displeasure, although they did share moments of closeness as well.|$|E
