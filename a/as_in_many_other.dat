5|$|The {{government}} of Japan is a constitutional monarchy {{in which the}} power of the Emperor is limited and is relegated primarily to ceremonial duties. <b>As</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> states, the Government is divided into three branches: the Executive branch, the Legislative branch and the Judicial branch.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> African societies, prebendalism {{and high}} rates of {{corruption}} continue to constitute major challenges to Nigeria. All major parties have practised vote rigging and other means of coercion to remain competitive. In 1983, the policy institute at Kuru concluded that only the 1959 and 1979 elections to that time were conducted with minimal vote rigging. In 2012, Nigeria was estimated to have lost over $400 billion to corruption since independence.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> ISSF events, {{the target}} for air pistol was reduced in size in 1989, also {{lowering}} the scores (although not by much), and thereby resetting all records. The development after this shows {{a contrast to}} that of air rifle shooting: whereas in air rifle the winning score of the 1989 World Championships would not have reached the final 17 years later, the same result increase has not occurred in air pistol, and Sergei Pyzhianov's world record of 593 points, set in the first World Cup Final with the new targets, remained unbeaten for almost 20 years.|$|E
50|$|Some localities {{described}} by Homer, {{in particular the}} farthest ones from the Greek world, such <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>others</b> literary works, would not be close reports to reality, but fantasy inventions.|$|R
50|$|Generally, the Joker is {{left out}} of {{solitaire}} card games <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>others</b> of its type. But there are variations of solitaire games where a Joker does take part, most often as a wild card.|$|R
50|$|In the Akodontini, Oxymycterus and Lenoxus {{have a low}} {{zygomatic}} plate, {{similar to}} that of Lophuromys. Scapteromys shares a low plate. In Akodon, the plate is narrow, <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>others</b> akodontine; this is extremely so in Blarinomys.|$|R
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> insects, {{the lift}} {{generated}} by butterflies {{is more than}} can {{be accounted for by}} steady-state, non-transitory aerodynamics. Studies using Vanessa atalanta in a wind tunnel show that they use a wide variety of aerodynamic mechanisms to generate force. These include wake capture, vortices at the wing edge, rotational mechanisms and the Weis-Fogh 'clap-and-fling' mechanism. Butterflies are able to change from one mode to another rapidly.|$|E
5|$|By 1977, {{a second}} wave of the punk rock {{movement}} was breaking in the three countries where it had emerged, as well <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> places. Bands from the same scenes often sounded very different from each other, reflecting the eclectic state of punk music during the era. While punk rock remained largely an underground phenomenon in North America, Australia, and the new spots where it was emerging, in the UK it briefly became a major sensation.|$|E
5|$|Churchmen such as Erasmus and Luther {{proposed}} {{reform to}} the Church, {{often based on}} humanist textual criticism of the New Testament. In October 1517 Luther published the 95 Theses, challenging papal authority and criticizing its perceived corruption, {{particularly with regard to}} instances of sold indulgences. The 95 Theses led to the Reformation, a break with the Roman Catholic Church that previously claimed hegemony in Western Europe. Humanism and the Renaissance therefore played a direct role in sparking the Reformation, as well <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> contemporaneous religious debates and conflicts.|$|E
50|$|The {{style is}} {{supposed}} to have its origin in old palace architecture Another example of this style is Sumiyoshi Jinja, part of the Sumiyoshi Sanjin complex in Fukuoka Prefecture. <b>In</b> both cases, <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>others,</b> there is no veranda.|$|R

5|$|Like Le Guin's earlier novel The Word for World Is Forest, {{this story}} {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} humans and their natural environment. The story also makes repeated references to the poetry of Andrew Marvell, including in the title. The story was republished in Le Guin's collections The Wind's Twelve Quarters and Buffalo Gals and Other Animal Presences, as well <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> anthologies. It was nominated for the Hugo Award in 1972.|$|E
5|$|MSU has {{a number}} of other team sports. <b>As</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> NCAA institutions, Michigan State has a {{baseball}} team for men and a softball team for women. Jake Boss Jr. is head coach of the MSU baseball team. Former Michigan State players in Major League Baseball include Kirk Gibson, Steve Garvey, Robin Roberts and Mark Mulder. Since 2007, the baseball team plays a popular annual exhibition game against the nearby minor-league Lansing Lugnuts.|$|E
5|$|Outside the {{breeding}} season, mourning doves roost communally in dense deciduous trees or in conifers. During sleep, the head rests between the shoulders, {{close to the}} body; it is not tucked under the shoulder feathers <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> species. During the winter in Canada, roosting flights to the roosts in the evening, {{and out of the}} roosts in the morning, are delayed on colder days.|$|E
60|$|He had {{a certain}} air of being a {{handsome}} man--which he was not; and a certain air of being a well-bred man--which he was not. It was mere swagger and challenge; but <b>in</b> this particular, <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>others,</b> blustering assertion goes for proof, half over the world.|$|R
50|$|In 1992 he {{published}} his first novel, The Light of fools, {{with the help}} of Daniel Pennac. He had a great success in 1995, with The Field of people. <b>In</b> this book, <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>others,</b> he recounts his childhood in a novel. He played himself in the film Imposture (2005).|$|R
60|$|In a word, he {{was ready}} to show that those who could, after such a full and fair exposure, {{continue}} to countenance the French insanity were not mistaken politicians, but bad men; but he thought that <b>in</b> this case, <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>others,</b> ignorance had been the cause of admiration.|$|R
5|$|The major {{competitions}} are the Olympic Games {{every four}} years and the ISSF World Shooting Championships {{every four years}}. In addition, the event {{is included in the}} ISSF World Cup and in continental championships, as well <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> international and national competitions. It is an indoor sport, and on the highest level electronic targets are used instead of the traditional paper targets.|$|E
5|$|Though it {{had large}} {{nostrils}} and a fleshy snout, Nigersaurus had an underdeveloped olfactory region of its brain and thus {{did not have}} an advanced sense of smell. Its brain-to-body-mass ratio was average for a reptile, and smaller than those of ornithischians and non-coelurosaurian theropods. The cerebrum comprised about 30% of the brain volume, <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Flies have {{a mobile}} {{head with a}} pair of large {{compound}} eyes {{on the sides of the}} head, and in most species, three small ocelli on the top. The compound eyes may be close together or widely separated, and in some instances are divided into a dorsal region and a ventral region, perhaps to assist in swarming behaviour. The antennae are well-developed but variable, being thread-like, feathery or comb-like in the different families. The mouthparts are adapted for piercing and sucking, as in the black flies, mosquitoes and robber flies, and for lapping and sucking <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> groups. Female horse-flies use knife-like mandibles and maxillae to make a cross-shaped incision in the host's skin and then lap up the blood that flows. The gut includes large diverticulae, allowing the insect to store small quantities of liquid after a meal.|$|E
50|$|Soccer is {{the most}} popular sport between the Hondurans, the country arrived <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>others</b> at the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, until was properly organized and Honduras national football team was created in the early 1960s. Honduras have played in three world cups, Spain 82, South Africa 2010, Brazil 2014.|$|R
50|$|Mainly used {{in combat}} {{sports such as}} boxing and kickboxing, below the belt refers to all {{the area of the}} body that lies below the line of the opponent's navel, {{including}} the genital area, legs, and crotch. <b>In</b> these sports, <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>others,</b> punches must not be struck below the opponent's navel, as it is deemed unfair and contrary to sportsmanship.|$|R
5000|$|Official {{deliveries}} of arms by the French {{government to}} other governments are regulated by well-defined rules, {{but in the}} case of Rwanda - <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>others</b> - the rules were rarely followed. According to the National Assembly investigative commission, thirty-one of thirty-six deliveries of weapons to Rwanda during the years 1990 to 1994 were made [...] "without following the rules." ...|$|R
5|$|In the {{mandible}} (lower jaw), {{the upper}} and lower masseteric ridges come close together below the first molars, but do not fuse. The back end of the lower incisor root is in a capsular process, a raising of the mandibular bone behind the molars. The upper incisors have yellowish enamel and are opisthodont, with the cutting edge inclined backwards. The molars are relatively small and are brachydont (low-crowned) and bunodont (with the cusps higher than the connecting crests). They {{are similar to those of}} the marsh rice rat in structural details. The upper and lower first molars have small accessory roots, <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> oryzomyines, and the second and third lower molar each have two roots only.|$|E
5|$|Many {{teeth are}} widest at their midsections and narrow {{closer to the}} jaws, giving them the {{appearance}} of a teardrop. Teardrop-shaped teeth are unique to Dimetrodon and other closely related sphenacodontids, and help distinguish them from other early synapsids. <b>As</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> early synapsids, the teeth of most Dimetrodon species are serrated at their edges. The serrations of Dimetrodon teeth were so fine that they resembled tiny cracks. The dinosaur Albertosaurus had similarly crack-like serrations, but, at the base of each serration was a round void, which would have functioned to distribute force over a larger surface area and prevent the stresses of feeding from causing the crack to spread through the tooth. Unlike Albertosaurus, Dimetrodon teeth lacked adaptations that would stop cracks from forming at their serrations. The teeth of D.teutonis lack serrations, but still have sharp edges.|$|E
5|$|The {{referendum}} {{that was}} held to adopt the state symbols took place on May 14, 1995. With a voter turnout of 64.7%, the new flag was approved by {{a majority in the}} ratio of three to one (75.1% to 24.9%). The other three questions were also passed by the voters. The way of carrying out the referendum as well as the legality of questioning the national symbols on a referendum was heavily criticized by the opposition. Opposition parties claimed that only 48.7% of the entire voting population (75.1% of the 64.7% who showed at the polling stations) supported the adoption of the new flag, but Belarusian law (<b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> countries) states that only a majority of voters is needed to decide on a referendum issue. Upon the results going in favor of President Lukashenko, he proclaimed that the return of the Soviet-style flag brought a sense of youth and pleasant memories to the nation.|$|E
60|$|However, <b>in</b> this instance, <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>others</b> of my experience, the morrow took {{plenty of}} thought for itself.

In both of these, <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>others</b> of his self-portraits, his costume is <b>in</b> <b>many</b> ways more from Titian's period than his own.|$|R
