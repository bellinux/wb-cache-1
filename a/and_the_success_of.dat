5|$|Almé Z (1966–1991), {{while not}} a {{successful}} international competitor himself, was a sire of huge {{importance to the}} international show jumping world. Among his numerous successful progeny was I Love You (a World Cup winner) and Galoubet A (1972–2005), part of the gold-medal winning French show-jumping team at the World Championships in 1982. Galoubet A, in turn, is known for both his competition career <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> his offspring.

5|$|By {{the end of}} the decade, {{alternative}} rock's mainstream prominence declined due to {{a number}} of events that caused grunge and Britpop to fade and led to the hiatus of the Lollapalooza festival. Nevertheless, post-grunge remained commercially viable into the start of the 21st century, with the commercial success of Creed and Matchbox Twenty; Radiohead's critical acclaim, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> some post-Britpop groups like Coldplay. Emo attracted attention in the larger alternative rock world, and the term was applied to a variety of artists, including multi-platinum acts. During the late 1990s and 2000s, other alternative rock bands emerged, including The White Stripes, The Strokes and Arcade Fire.|$|E
5|$|Clock Tower was commercially successful, selling {{close to}} half a million copies. Kono {{attributed}} some of this success to Resident Evil generating interest in horror games <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> the PlayStation. Critical reviews of Clock Tower were mixed. The game's horror atmosphere and storyline were praised, although most other aspects {{were found to be}} mediocre. Most of the negative critique was directed towards the game's slow pace, which was compared unfavorably to other PlayStation games of the era, particularly the more action-oriented and fast-paced Resident Evil. These factors influenced some critics to recommend Clock Tower purely for point-and-click adventure fans.|$|E

5|$|The {{river is}} a {{highland}} carrier, {{as it is}} embanked and the water level is often higher than the land through which it flows. Water from the surrounding countryside does not therefore drain into the river naturally, and drainage schemes have relied on pumping to remove the water. The pumping station at Westonzoyland was built in 1830, the first mechanical pumping station on the Somerset Levels. It was designed to drain the area around Westonzoyland, Middlezoy and Othery, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> the drainage system {{led to the formation}} of Internal drainage boards and the construction of other pumping stations.|$|E
5|$|Although a British frigate {{squadron}} under Josias Rowley {{was under}} orders {{to eliminate the}} French raiders, Rowley was distracted by the planned invasion of Île Bonaparte, which began the following week. Combined with limited British resources in the region, this allowed the French frigates significant freedom to attack British interests across the Ocean. The attack on Île Bonaparte was however part of a wider British strategy to seize and capture French raiding bases, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> the operation severely limited future French operations as Hamelin's squadron was required for the defence of Île de France. As a result, {{this was the last}} successful attack on a British merchant convoy in the Indian Ocean during the Napoleonic Wars.|$|E

He wrote two articles a week: the first a review of non-literary books, the other a feature-style article about whatever he wanted.

5|$|By 2017, {{the series}} had sold over 8.5 million units worldwide, outselling even its parent Megami Tensei franchise, which has sold over 7.2 million since its inception. The first Persona was {{referred}} to {{at the time as}} a sleeper hit, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> it and Eternal Punishment helped establish both Atlus and Megami Tensei in North America. In Europe, the series did not become established prior to the release of Persona 3 and 4, both of which were highly successful in the region. According to Atlus CEO Naoto Hiraoka, the main turning point for the franchise was the release of Persona 3, which was a commercial success and brought the series {{to the attention of the}} mainstream gaming community. Persona 4 received an even better reception. The Persona series' success has allowed Atlus to build a strong player base in the West, contributing to the success of other titles such as Catherine.|$|E
5|$|Cage {{dedicated}} Sonatas and Interludes to Maro Ajemian, {{a pianist}} and friend. Ajemian performed the work many times since 1949, {{including one of}} the first performances of the complete cycle on January 12, 1949, in Carnegie Hall. On many other occasions in the late 1940s and early 1950s, Cage performed it himself. Critical reaction was uneven, but mostly positive, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> Sonatas and Interludes led to a grant from the Guggenheim Foundation, which Cage received in 1949, allowing him to make a six-month trip to Europe. There he met Olivier Messiaen, who helped organize a performance of the work for his students in Paris on June 7, 1949; and he befriended Pierre Boulez, who became an early admirer of the work and wrote a lecture about it for the June 17, 1949 performance at the salon of Suzanne Tézenas in Paris. While still living in Paris, Cage began writing String Quartet in Four Parts, yet another work influenced by Indian philosophy.|$|E
5|$|In {{light of}} the poor results of the {{precision}} bombing campaign <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> the 25February raid on Tokyo, and considering that many tons of incendiaries were now available to him, LeMay decided to begin firebombing attacks on Japan's main cities during early March 1945. This was in line with Arnold's targeting directive for XXIBomber Command, which specified that urban areas were to be accorded the second-highest priority for attacks after aircraft factories. The directive also stated that firebombing raids should be conducted once M-69 bombs had been tested in combat {{and the number of}} B-29s available was sufficient to launch an intensive campaign. LeMay did not seek Arnold's specific approval before launching his firebombing campaign, however, to protect the USAAF commander from criticism if the attacks were unsuccessful. The Twentieth Air Force's Chief of Staff, Brigadier General Lauris Norstad, was aware of the change in tactics though and provided support. The decision to use firebombing tactics represented a move away from the USAAF's previous focus on precision bombing, and was believed by senior officials in the military and US Government to be justified by the need to rapidly bring the war to an end.|$|E
