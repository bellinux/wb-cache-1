40|$|Context: Variations in palatal bone {{thickness}} (PBT) {{at various}} locations have caused considerable problems when using these sites for anchorage purposes. Aims: To find the comparative {{thickness of the}} palatal bone at different locations and to validate its morphology for anchorage purposes using mini-implants (MI). Settings and Design: This investigation was undertaken to compare the mean PBT and level of significance of differences {{between male and female}} subjects and between two different age-groups. Materials and Methods: The computed tomography (CT) data for 60 patients (30 males and 30 females) in two different age-groups (group A: 15 - 24 years; group B: 25 - 35 years) were imported into CAD-based medical software, (MIMICS®; Materialise, Belgium) for multiplanar reconstruction. The measurements were made in two planes- transverse and sagittal-and at different positions in each of the planes. Statistical Analysis: The mean and standard deviations of the PBT at different points were calculated. The Student′s t-test and Mann-Whitney U test were used for comparisons between the groups. Results: Significant variations were observed in the thickness of the palatal bone for both groups tested, with the anterior region at 4 mm behind the incisive papilla showing the maximum thickness. Conclusions: Despite the palatal bone being thickest in the mid-palatal suture (MPS) region, this is not the ideal site for <b>anchorage</b> purposes <b>due</b> to inadequate calcification and interposition of connective tissue, especially in young growing children.

40|$|Studies {{have shown}} that the {{connection}} details used for cable anchorage blocks on cable-stayed bridges have the potential for fatigue damage due to fluctuating stresses generated by the cyclic traffic loads passing over the bridge. To investigate the fatigue damage and determine the remaining fatigue life of a cable anchorage block used on a cable-stayed bridge, finite element (FE) analyses were undertaken by using the Fatigue Load Model 4 (FLM 4) proposed by the Eurocodes to identify the most fatigue-critical locations within the details. One of the main objectives of this research was to identify the critical area prone to fatigue in the <b>anchorage</b> block <b>due</b> to the response in traffic loads. Therefore, two types of numerical models of a typical cable anchorage block were analysed as a three dimensional sub-model which was driven by global cable forces obtained from the global analysis of a three-span cable-stayed bridge. These models are of the cable anchorage block without the longitudinal girder modelled and the cable anchorage block with the longitudinal girder modelled. The cable anchorage blocks without the longitudinal girder model were classified into three categories of model types namely; model types 0, A and B. Similarly, the cable anchorage blocks with the longitudinal girder model were classified as model types A-G, B-G and C-G. These model classifications are based on several boundary conditions simulated in the analyses. In addition to this, the fatigue behaviour of the cable anchorage block was analysed by using three different approaches namely; by using the nodal stresses at the location of the stress concentration (node stress concentration), by using a stress averaged over an area {{in the vicinity of the}} stress concentration (average elements) and by using the hot-spot method, in order to identify the stress ranges that adversely affect the remaining fatigue life of cable anchorages. Each approach was analysed with three different mesh sizes; 5 mm by 5 mm, 10 mm by 10 mm and 20 mm by 20 mm in order to carry out a mesh sensitivity analysis of the resulting stresses and associated stress ranges. The 10 mm by 10 mm mesh size was found to be most appropriate for this fatigue appraisal. This finding is supported because the 10 mm by 10 mm mesh size is specified in several code of practices such as the International Institute of Welding (IIW) and BS 7608 as guidance for use when determining hot-spot stress when using the hot-spot method for the fatigue analyses of a welded detail. The critical stresses from model type C-G were used in the fatigue appraisal as the behaviour of this model represented more accurately the actual cable anchorage block on the cable-stayed bridge compared to the other types of models used. Model type C-G were selected for further fatigue appraisal as this model include the correct boundary conditions and applied load that represented the actual condition of the anchorage behaviour on the cable-stayed bridge. This included the movement of the top <b>anchorage</b> block <b>due</b> to the displacement of the cable and in addition the deck movement. Also, non-uniform pressure was applied on the bearing plate which was included to model possible construction tolerances which was one of the important properties of the model type C-G. In evaluating the possible fatigue damage in the cable anchorage block, the cumulative model for fatigue failure expressed in terms of Miner’s rule was used. In addition to this, the condition of the structural detail due to fatigue with increasing traffic loading was determined by projecting traffic volume increases of up to 20...|$|R

According to the milliner the crown almost never reached Gaga since the entire shipment was seized in <b>Anchorage,</b> Alaska <b>due</b> to the feathers on the piece being subjected to wildlife import issues with US customs officials. After much paperwork for five days the millinery designs were finally released and arrived {{just in time for}} the Cheek to Cheek promotional photo shoot. Vogels recalled, [...] "It was nerve racking and exciting at the same time and a relief when the shipment was finally released from customs." [...] Maxwell said that he and his team did the wardrobe for the dancers and Gaga, and first took references from Wilson regarding the set and lighting designs. The team then started with eight full racks of clothing, between 200 and 300 dresses, and afterwards zeroed in on eight costumes for the show, along with its accessories. Regarding the absence of jewellery, Maxwell explained that most of the outfits [...] "were more about the silhouette and structure of gowns" [...] and too much of accessories would have been a distraction. He wanted the emphasis on Gaga's vocals, hence the jewellery usage was reduced. Designers used for the costumes include Roberto Cavalli, Michael Costello, Mathieu Mirano, Valentino as well as David Samuel Menkes, who created the leather jumpsuit. Gaga had wanted costumes with teal or turquoise colours and flowing gowns, belted in the middle. Maxwell took care to ensure that the dresses were not too tight in Gaga's abdomen area, since it would have been difficult for her to sing.

40|$|As the {{petroleum}} industry enhances {{their efforts to}} locate and produce fields {{in more and more}} challenged areas, bigger and deeper boreholes are required. The hydraulics of the borehole suddenly becomes the major power consumer of the drilling process. The proposed system where circulation occurs through hoses is a response to these increased hydraulic power requirements. A drilling system where mud circulation occurs in hoses instead of through the annulus is under development. Testing has been performed 3 times. The 2 first was drilled in 1990 - 92 and the third in 2009. The ones drilled during the 90 s experienced no problems <b>due</b> to an <b>anchorage</b> system. The anchorage kept {{the upper part of the}} BHA stationary, absorbing the present mechanical lift. The anchorage did not have the ability to measure the resulting lift. The third attempt had no such anchorage. It was believed an <b>anchorage</b> was unnecessary <b>due</b> to a new refraction method. This new method was expected to not need excessive weight on bit. However, the third attempt was unsuccessful. An excel spreadsheet program have been modeled to calculate the lift forces. The program is built to be user friendly, where the user can input key parameters to simulate lift forces at different scenarios. An estimate of the present lift forces at a given scenarios can thus be calculated. The largest lift contributors to the system are the stagnation force and the frictional force in the return hose. Frictional forces can be reduced by increased return hose diameter, or lower flow rate. The stagnation force decreases with increased nozzle angle, and increases with decreased nozzle outlet area. Lift will occur in the range of 6 to 80 tons depending on the scenario. A slight change in parameters can increase the lift by 10 to 30 tons. This program gives a good estimate of the lift forces, and design of the system should be based on a preliminary analysis. </p...|$|R
40|$|The brick masonry veneer wall is {{a common}} type of {{cladding}} in Norwegian buildings. The veneer wall system is a composite structure, which in essence consists of an exterior masonry wall and an interior backup (bracing) wall, separated by an air cavity with regularly spaced metal ties connecting the exterior masonry wall to the interior backup wall. Backup walls can be made of masonry, concrete, wood or steel, {{in the form of}} panels or frames. A common type in Norway is the wooden backup wall, with vertical wooden studs covered by external and internal sheets.         Previously, anchorage ties were essentially designed to withstand wind loading. The common practice in Norway is to support the veneer wall vertically, at its base only. This makes it especially important to ensure that the joint action of the inner and outer wall, which relies on the connection ties, is capable of resisting horizontal loadings from wind and earthquake excitations. From April 1 st 2010, the Norwegian national standards in series NS 34 xx have been withdrawn by Standards Norway and replaced by the Eurocodes, which are now the valid Norwegian Standards for structural design. The main objective of the study is to investigate the structural capacity of anchorage ties in masonry veneer walls subjected to earthquake excitations. In particular, to assess the capacity of a typical and modern Norwegian wall system in view of the newly implemented Eurocodes for structural design. The anchorage connection depends on the tensile strength and the buckling strength of the tie, {{as well as of the}} pull-out strength from mortar joint and backup wall. For common types of ties, the pull-out strength from joints is decisive. Background information from earlier studies and development of masonry veneers that have been tested and analyzed under simulated earthquake and wind pressure loads, are summarized. Accidents and damage experiences mainly due to earthquake are presented. Requirements for anchored veneers from guidelines in Norway are discussed. Relevant code requirements in the USA are introduced and compared with the requirements in Norway. The out-of-plane seismic performance of anchored brick veneer wall systems supported by wooden backup walls, representing prescriptive design requirements and current construction practice, is investigated. Prescriptive requirements for the design and construction of anchored brick veneers are currently given by the Eurocodes. The nature of earthquake and the seismicity in Norway is discussed, with special attention on the applicability of the code for the veneer wall as a non-structural element. The analysis methods allowed by Eurocode 8 are dealt with. Artificially generated accelerograms, representative for the area under consideration, are made and modified by the necessary base line correction technique. Despite Norway being considered a country with low seismic activity, there are regions where earthquake resistance is the governing design criteria for veneer ties. The simplified method suggested in Eurocode 8, clause 4. 3. 5. 2 (2), for design check of non-structural elements, is not applicable for typical veneer walls in Norway, where they are vertically supported only at their base. Experimental test results are used to validate FEM analysis. Simplified 2 D FEM analyses are performed to assess the capacity of <b>anchorage</b> ties <b>due</b> to seismic excitations at selected locations in Norway. The analyses results indicate that the resistance of typical veneer walls, connected to a backup wall in wood with 4 ties/m 2, seems to be inadequate, except for areas with low seismicity. It should however be noticed that this consideration is based on the assumption of a tie capacity of 0. 6 kN/tie, as recommended by the Masonry Catalogue (2005) and the Building Research Institute (2009), whereas testing performed by Madso (1980) indicates a capacity in the range 1. 55 - 2. 0 kN/tie. If even the lower limit of Madso’s measurements are taken as basis, the 2 D FEM results suggest that 4 ties/m 2 provides sufficient earthquake resistance of typical veneer walls in all areas of Norway. Design guides, codes, and current construction practice is evaluated in light of the overall findings of the current study. Supporting the veneer wall by brackets attached to the main structure at floors’ levels, as in the USA is a solution when increasing the number of ties per m 2 is not reducing ties forces to the allowable limit. This solution has the cost of introducing thermal bridges to the building. It is recommended that veneer walls together with their ties should be verified for the seismic design situation wherever seismic check is mandatory according to Eurocode 8. A detailed seismic analysis (time history analysis) should be performed in order to check and determine the number and layout anchorage ties. A quality assurance system is necessary, with respect to installation of ties. Experimental seismic/dynamic tests for pull-out capacity of different types of anchorage ties from timber as well as from mortar are required.
