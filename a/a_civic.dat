40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss the idea of {{national}} education in Singapore. National education, broadly speaking, is <b>a</b> <b>civics</b> programme which seeks to instil a sense of place, identity and history in young Singaporeans {{with a view to}} developing national pride and commitment. We set this discussion against the backdrop of globalization and the idea of wired communities and argue that any civics programme needs to be more than simply a nationalistic agenda. To do this we have framed national education in Singapore as <b>a</b> <b>civics</b> literacy informed by the idea of multiliteracies. In doing so, we suggest that the pedagogical work of such an approach can help to sustain the nation state of Singapore yet place the <b>civics</b> agenda on <b>a</b> global stage where national education might be seen more appropriately as global education...|$|R

5|$|According to our {{surviving}} narratives, {{the three}} kings of Rome during the Etruscan occupation were Tarquinius Priscus, Servius Tullius, and Tarquinius Superbus. During this period the army underwent a reformation into a centurial army based on socio-economic class. This reformation is traditionally attributed to Servius Tullius, {{the second of}} the Etruscan kings. Tullius had earlier carried out the first Roman census of all citizens. Livy tells us that Tullius reformed the army by transplanting onto it the structure derived originally for civil life {{as a result of this}} census. At all levels, military service was, at this time, considered to be <b>a</b> <b>civic</b> responsibility and a way of advancing one's status within society.|$|E
5|$|The pier {{opened in}} 1869 {{and served as}} an {{embarkation}} point for paddle steamer excursions for almost exactly 100 years.

5|$|After its {{use as a}} {{courthouse}} in the early 19th century, Congress Hall, like other buildings in the area, had fallen into disrepair. In 1870, the Pennsylvania General Assembly ordered the demolition of all the buildings surrounding Independence Hall. However, the law was never enforced and was officially repealed in 1895. Under the leadership of <b>a</b> <b>civic</b> organization known as The Colonial Dames of America, the architect George Champlin Mason, Jr. began restoring Congress Hall in 1895-96, though this work was mostly limited to the Senate chamber. In 1900, the Philadelphia chapter of the American Institute of Architects (AIA) began a study of Congress Hall and initiated a funding drive for the building's complete restoration. After funds were secured, the City of Philadelphia approved the restoration project in 1912 {{under the supervision of}} the AIA. Work on Congress Hall was completed the following year when President Woodrow Wilson rededicated the building. Additional work to refurbish the House chamber was completed in 1934. In 1942, over 50 civic and patriotic groups met at the American Philosophical Society and joined to create the Independence Hall Association. The association lobbied for the creation of Independence National Historical Park, which was initially approved by Congress in 1948 and formally established on July 4, 1956.|$|E
