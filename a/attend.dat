5|$|Although {{the number}} of Spanish bishops who {{attended}} is unknown, the Archbishop of Toledo, Raymund, did <b>attend.</b> King Alfonso VII of León and Castile interceded with the pope to lift the sentences against those bishops who did not <b>attend.</b> King Stephen of England refused permission {{for any of the}} English bishops to <b>attend,</b> except for the bishops of Hereford, Norwich and Chichester. It was the papal summons which caused the Archbishop of Canterbury, Theobald of Bec, to quarrel with his king, after Stephen refused the archbishop permission to go to the council. Theobald instead managed to evade the guards placed on him and hired a fishing boat to take him across the English Channel to <b>attend</b> the council.|$|E
5|$|Campbell was unapologetic. He {{said that}} he {{considered}} it his duty as president to <b>attend</b> the game.

Years later, Canadiens player Jean Béliveau stated that, although he disagreed with Campbell's decision to <b>attend</b> the game, as well as feeling Campbell might have been using his appearance to make a statement, he concluded that Campbell may have felt that if he did not <b>attend</b> he could appear to be hiding. He also noted that Campbell's absence might not have made much of a difference.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} teacher {{attention}} on the <b>attending</b> behavior of two boys seated at adjacent desks were investigated. Baseline records were obtained of the appropriate <b>attending</b> behavior of two boys who were described as the most disruptive pupils in a second-grade classroom of a poverty area school. During the first experimental phase, the teacher systematically increased {{the amount of attention}} for appropriate <b>attending</b> in one of the pair, Edwin. This resulted in a dramatic increase in his <b>attending</b> rate and a lesser, though significant, increase in <b>attending</b> behavior of the second boy, Greg. During the second experimental phase, systematic attention for <b>attending</b> was instituted for Greg and was discontinued for Edwin. This resulted in further increases in <b>attending</b> by Greg and a reduction in <b>attending</b> by Edwin. A brief withdrawal of reinforcement for <b>attending</b> in both Greg and Edwin reduced <b>attending</b> levels for both. Following this reversal appropriate <b>attending</b> for both boys was systematically reinforced and <b>attending</b> returned to high levels...|$|R
