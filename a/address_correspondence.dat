40|$|Abstract An {{experimental}} study of alternatives to the current U. S. decennial census questionnaire shows that shortening the questionnaire and respondent-friendly questionnaire design im-prove response, whereas asking a potentially difficult and/or objectionable question, that is, social security number, lowers response. This national study of 17, 000 household addresses also demonstrates that relatively high mail survey response can be achieved without <b>addressing</b> <b>correspondence</b> to individual names of residents. Four potential influences on mail survey response rates are jointly examined in this study. They include: (1) questionnaire length, (2) respondent-friendly questionnaire design, (3) the asking of a potentially difficult and/or objectionable question (social security numbers), and (4) <b>addressing</b> <b>correspondence</b> to the occupant households {{as opposed to a}} specific person's name.
