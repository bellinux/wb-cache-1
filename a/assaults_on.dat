5|$|Beginning on 24 October and {{continuing}} over two consecutive nights, Maruyama's forces conducted numerous, unsuccessful frontal <b>assaults</b> <b>on</b> the southern {{portion of the}} U.S. Lunga perimeter. More than 1,500 of Maruyama's troops {{were killed in the}} attacks while the Americans lost about 60 killed.|$|E

2500|$|The SADF shelved {{the plan}} for Operation Bruilof and {{planning}} for a new operation, Operation Reindeer, began. Reindeer was composed of three main actions; the airborne <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> Cassinga, a mechanised <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> the Chetaquera complex at [...] - that also involved SAAF defence-suppression strikes - and an <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> the Dombondola complex at [...] by a light infantry force.|$|R
5|$|According {{to human}} rights organisations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch the {{government}} of Zimbabwe violates the rights to shelter, food, freedom of movement and residence, freedom of assembly {{and the protection of}} the law. There have been alleged <b>assaults</b> <b>on</b> the media, the political opposition, civil society activists, and human rights defenders.|$|E
5|$|Both ships {{participated in}} the Italo-Turkish War of 191112. Vettor Pisani {{supported}} operations in the Adriatic and Aegean Seas and in the Dardanelles while Carlo Alberto {{took part in the}} <b>assaults</b> <b>on</b> Tripoli and Zuara and thereafter provided gunfire support to Italian forces in North Africa.|$|E
5|$|The Germans swiftly mobilised {{to expel}} the Allied forces and {{launched}} heavy air <b>assaults</b> <b>on</b> Kos and Leros. Without fighter support, the islands' defence was soon precarious; the LRDG {{and the rest}} of the troops on Kalymnos were withdrawn to Leros on 4 October after the Germans won the Battle of Kos. German air <b>assaults</b> <b>on</b> Leros intensified during late October, and at dawn on 12 November 1943 the Germans attacked Leros by sea and air. During the ensuing Battle of Leros, the LRDG Rhodesians at Point 320, commanded by Rhodesian Captain JR Olivey, spiked their position's guns and withdrew before counter-attacking and retaking the point the next day. They held that position for three more days, during which they learned that the Germans were winning the battle. On 16 November, Olivey decided that holding the point any longer was pointless and ordered his men to split up, escape by any means possible and re-assemble in Cairo. Over half of the unit reached Egypt.|$|E
50|$|To the {{surprise}} of the U.S. Navy, an <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> Midway Island reveals the Japanese have completely abandoned their garrison there. Many suspect that the Japanese are concentrating their resources for an <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> British-held Malaya and Singapore, abandoning the alliance. An amphibious <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> Wake Island in the western Pacific some months later regains U.S. control of the island but also finds no signs of the Japanese.|$|R

5|$|The JNA {{launched}} repeated <b>assaults</b> <b>on</b> Vukovar {{but failed}} to make any progress. Its armour, designed for combat in open country, was barely able to enter Vukovar's narrow streets. Support from regular infantry was lacking, and the TO's poorly trained and motivated troops were inadequate substitutes. The JNA's soldiers appeared to have little {{understanding of how to}} conduct urban operations and its officers displayed slow and reactive decision-making on the ground.|$|E
5|$|After the {{generally}} failed <b>assaults</b> <b>on</b> the bridges, the German divisions began crossing attempts over the rivers IJssel and Maas. The first waves typically were destroyed, due to insufficient preparatory {{fire on the}} pillboxes. At most places a secondary bombardment destroyed the pillboxes and the infantry divisions crossed the river after building pontoon bridges; but at some, as Venlo, the attempt was aborted. At Arnhem, Leibstandarte Der Fuehrer led the assault and that day advanced to the Grebbe Line, followed by 207. Infanteriedivision.|$|E
5|$|At 03:00, the 8th Heavy Company, 192nd Panzergrenadier Regiment with 75mm SP guns, 20mm AA guns, and mortars {{attacked}} 'A' and 'C' Companies, 7th Parachute Battalion, {{from the}} south. The paratroops were forced {{back and the}} Germans established their own positions in Bénouville, but were unable to break the British line. They dug in and waited for tank support before moving forward again. The Germans fired mortar bombs and machine guns at the paratroopers and attempted small <b>assaults</b> <b>on</b> their positions throughout the night.|$|E

5|$|David Gilbertson, {{a former}} {{assistant}} inspector {{who had worked for}} the Home Office formulating policing policy, told The New York Times that the British police used to act with the sanction of the public, but that tactics had changed after a series of violent <b>assaults</b> <b>on</b> officers in the 1990s. Now dressing in military-style uniforms and equipped with anti-stab vests, extendable metal batons and clubs that turn into handcuffs, an entire generation of officers has come to regard the public as the enemy, the newspaper said.|$|E
5|$|In 1932twelve {{years after}} the ACLU was foundedit had {{achieved}} significant success; the Supreme Court had embraced the free speech principles espoused by the ACLU, {{and the general public}} was becoming more supportive of civil rights in general. But the Great Depression brought new <b>assaults</b> <b>on</b> civil liberties; the year 1930 saw a large {{increase in the number of}} free speech prosecutions, a doubling of the number of lynchings, and all meetings of unemployed persons were banned in Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|In the engagement, U.S. Marines {{from the}} 7th Marine Regiment and U.S. Army {{soldiers}} from the 164th Infantry Regiment under the tactical command of William H. Rupertus and Edmund B. Sebree, attacked a concentration of Japanese Army troops, most of whom belonged to the 230th Infantry Regiment, commanded by Toshinari Shōji. Shōji's troops had marched to the Koli Point area after the failed Japanese <b>assaults</b> <b>on</b> U.S. defenses during the Battle for Henderson Field in late October 1942.|$|E
50|$|Preparations {{for a new}} <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> Palignar ford began {{sometime}} in late May (or possibly June.) 30,000 troops were assembled for the new <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> Palignar. The artillery was moved into pre-prepared trench-lines, where the batteries would be better shielded from Portuguese return-fire.|$|R
5000|$|In December, the 75th {{had been}} moved to Vimy Ridge , {{immediately}} after {{taking part in the}} <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> REGINA TRENCH, where they, {{with the rest of the}} Canadian Army dug in, prepared for, and waited until the great <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> 9 April 1917.|$|R

5|$|Later, {{he opened}} {{negotiations}} with the Portuguese. As {{a result of the}} agreement, the suspicion against the clergy and the Christians was removed. During Hyder's regime, the Mangalorean Catholic community continued to flourish. After Hyder's death in the Second Anglo-Mysore War on 7 December 1782, the British captured the fort again. Hyder was succeeded by his son Tipu Sultan. Tipu laid several <b>assaults</b> <b>on</b> the Mangalore fort until January 1784, all of which resulted in failure. The fort was finally delivered to Tipu when the British capitulated on 30 January 1784.|$|E
5|$|Napoli saw {{action in}} the Italo-Turkish War in 1911 and 1912; she {{took part in the}} attack on Derna, Libya, and the amphibious <b>assaults</b> <b>on</b> the islands of Rhodes and the Dodecanese in the Aegean Sea. Napoli {{remained}} in service during World War I in 191518, but saw no action {{as a result of the}} cautious policies of both the Italian and Austro-Hungarian navies. She remained in the Italian inventory until she was stricken from the naval register in August 1926 and was subsequently broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{incidents}} of harassment and hate crimes against Muslims and South Asians {{were reported in}} the days following the attacks. Sikhs were also targeted because Sikh males usually wear turbans, which are stereotypically associated with Muslims. There were reports of attacks on mosques and other religious buildings (including the firebombing of a Hindu temple), and <b>assaults</b> <b>on</b> people, including one murder: Balbir Singh Sodhi, a Sikh mistaken for a Muslim, was fatally shot on September 15, 2001, in Mesa, Arizona.|$|E

5|$|On {{the second}} day of battle, most of both armies had assembled. The Union line was laid out in a {{defensive}} formation resembling a fishhook. In the late afternoon of July 2, Lee launched a heavy assault on the Union left flank, and fierce fighting raged at Little Round Top, the Wheatfield, Devil's Den, and the Peach Orchard. On the Union right, Confederate demonstrations escalated into full-scale <b>assaults</b> <b>on</b> Culp's Hill and Cemetery Hill. All across the battlefield, despite significant losses, the Union defenders held their lines.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Orthez (27 February 1814) saw the Anglo-Portuguese Army under Field Marshal Arthur Wellesley, Marquess of Wellington attack an Imperial French army led by Marshal Nicolas Soult in {{southern}} France. The outnumbered French repelled several Allied <b>assaults</b> <b>on</b> their right flank, but their center and left flank were overcome and Soult {{was compelled to}} retreat. At first the withdrawal was conducted in good order, but it eventually ended in a scramble for safety and many French soldiers became prisoners.
