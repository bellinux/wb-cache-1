40|$|Investigations of {{hydraulic}} {{operating conditions}} of <b>air</b> <b>lift</b> pump with {{three types of}} air-water mixers. The paper presents the analysis of results of the investigations concerning the influence of various constructive solutions of the air-water mixers on hydraulic operating conditions of the <b>air</b> <b>lift</b> pump. The scope of the investigations encompassed the determination of characteristics of delivery head and delivery rate for three types of air-water mixers applied in the constructed <b>air</b> <b>lift</b> pump. Using the obtained results, {{the efficiency of the}} three types of air-water mixers applied in this <b>air</b> <b>lift</b> pump was determined. The analysis was carried out and there was checked whether the improved analytical Stenning-Martin model can be used to design <b>air</b> <b>lift</b> pumps with the air-water mixers of these types. The highest capacity in the water transport was reached by the <b>air</b> <b>lift</b> pump with the 1 st type air-water mixer, the lowest one – with the 3 rd type air-water mixer. The water flow in the <b>air</b> <b>lift</b> pump increases along with the rise in the air flow. The lower are the hydraulic losses generated during flow of the air flux by the air-water mixer, the higher is the <b>air</b> <b>lift</b> pump capacity. Along with the rise in the water delivery head, the capacity of the <b>air</b> <b>lift</b> pump decreases. The highest efficiency is reached by the <b>air</b> <b>lift</b> pump with the 1 st type air-water mixer, the lowest – with the 3 st type air-water mixer. The efficiency of the <b>air</b> <b>lift</b> pump for the three investigated types of air-water mixers decreases along with the rise in air flow rate and water delivery head. The values of submergence ratio (h/L) of the delivery pipe, calculated {{with the use of the}} improved analytical Stenning-Martin model, coincide quite well with the values of h/L determined from the measurements...|$|R

50|$|Stotting (also called pronking or pronging) is a {{behavior}} of quadrupeds, particularly gazelles, {{in which they}} spring into the <b>air,</b> <b>lifting</b> all four {{feet off the ground}} simultaneously. Usually, the legs are held in a relatively stiff position and the back may be arched with the head pointing downward. Many explanations of stotting have been proposed; there is evidence that at least in some cases it is an honest signal to predators that the stotting animal would be difficult to catch.|$|E
50|$|Also {{known as}} the X-Factor. This {{is the most common}} {{variation}} of the standard facebuster in which the attacker grabs hold of the opponent by his/her head then jumps in the <b>air,</b> <b>lifting</b> the opponent and landing with their legs spread apart, driving the opponent's face into the mat. Another variation of this move is to grab the opponent by the hair, perform the same jump and landing but lift only the opponent's head, giving a harder effect when the opponent's face is driven into the mat. This move was popularized by Sean Waltman.|$|E

50|$|The {{cooler and}} denser air wedges under the less-dense warmer <b>air,</b> <b>lifting</b> it. This upward motion causes lowered {{pressure}} along the cold front {{and can cause}} {{the formation of a}} narrow line of showers and thunderstorms when enough moisture is present. On weather maps, the surface position of the cold front is marked with the symbol of a blue line of triangles/spikes (pips) pointing in the direction of travel. A cold front's location is at {{the leading edge of the}} temperature drop off, which in an isotherm analysis would show up as the leading edge of the isotherm gradient, and it normally lies within a sharp surface trough. Cold fronts move faster than warm fronts and can produce sharper changes in weather. Since cold air is denser than warm air, it rapidly replaces the warm air preceding the boundary.|$|E

50|$|Also {{known as}} the Norcross {{viscometer}} after its inventor, Austin Norcross. The principle of viscosity measurement in this rugged and sensitive industrial device {{is based on a}} piston and cylinder assembly. The piston is periodically raised by an <b>air</b> <b>lifting</b> mechanism, drawing the material being measured down through the clearance (gap) between the piston and the wall of the cylinder into the space which is formed below the piston as it is raised. The assembly is then typically held up for a few seconds, then allowed to fall by gravity, expelling the sample out through the same path that it entered, creating a shearing effect on the measured liquid, which makes this viscometer particularly sensitive and good for measuring certain thixotropic liquids. The time of fall is a measure of viscosity, with the clearance between the piston and inside of the cylinder forming the measuring orifice. The viscosity controller measures the time of fall (time-of-fall seconds being the measure of viscosity) and displays the resulting viscosity value. The controller can calibrate the time-of-fall value to cup seconds (known as efflux cup), Saybolt universal second (SUS) or centipoise.|$|E
50|$|Another {{series of}} explosions {{occurred}} 1981, including {{one at the}} National Airport. These were attributed to the BCP's banned militaristic wing, the Lesotho Liberation Army (LLA). In retaliation the PMU reportedly broke into the home of Benjamin Masilo, chair of the Christian Council of Lesotho. He narrowly escaped death and fled abroad, but his grandson was killed. The PMU then abducted and killed Edgar Motuba, {{an outspoken critic of}} the government and editor of the weekly Leselinyana la Lesotho newspaper. He was found lying with the corpses of two friends. A visit by AI late that year revealed that other citizens had been killed. 1982 saw reports of torture against political detainees and {{the emergence of a new}} political death squad, known as the Koeeoko. In December the South African Defence Force entered Maseru at night and killed many officials of the African National Congress, as well as twelve citizens of Lesotho. At least forty extrajudicial killings were reported to have been carried out, and most were against unarmed persons. The government, concerned of potential further attacks by the South Africans, began <b>air</b> <b>lifting</b> refugees to Mozambique. Reports of torture and arbitrary arrest continued to leak to the outside world through the next two years.|$|E

40|$|The {{universal}} instability mechanism in an ascending moist air flow is theoretically proposed and analyzed. Its origin {{comes to the}} conflict between two processes: the increasing of pressure forcing applied to the boundary layer and the decelerating of the updraft flow due to air heating. It is shown that the intensification of tropical storm with the redistribution of wind velocities, pressure and temperature can result from the reorganization of the dissipative structure which key parameters are the moist <b>air</b> <b>lifting</b> velocity and the temperature of surrounding atmosphere. This reorganization can lead to formation of hurricane eye and inner ring of convection. A transition of the dissipative structure in a new state can occur when the temperature lapse rate in a zone of <b>air</b> <b>lifting</b> reaches certain critical value. The accordance of observational data with the proposed theoretical description is shown. Comment: 15 pages, 7 figure...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} is to create an ex vivo model to examine the {{expression}} of major heat-shock protein (HSP) families; HSP 60, HSP 72, and HSP 90, and heat-shock cognate 70 (HCS 70) at the mRNA and protein level in differentiating corneal cells from limbal stem cells (LSC) following air exposure. Methods: Limbal biopsies taken from cadaveric normal human limbus were cultivated as explants on human amniotic membrane (HAM) and plastic dish (PD). Corneal differentiation was induced by <b>air</b> <b>lifting</b> for 16 days. The expression of putative LSC markers (P 63 and ATP-binding cassette G 2 [ABCG 2]), corneal markers (keratin 3 [K 3 / 12] and connexin 43 [CX 43]), and HSP 60, HSP 72, HSP 90, and HSC 70 were tested by RT–PCR, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometry pre- and post-air exposure. Fresh limbal and corneal tissues were used as control groups. Results: <b>Air</b> <b>lifting</b> induced corneal differentiation with a decrease in the number of P 63 + cells and an increase in the number of K 3 + /CX 43 + cells, which characterized transient amplifying cells (TACs). Moreover, denuded HAM provided a superior niche for LSC proliferation and phenotype maintenance in vitro. Additionally, we have evidence that expressions of HSC 70 as well as HSP 72 were enhanced through corneal differentiation and HSP 90 post-air lifting in vitro and in vivo. HSP 60, however, was not detected in either LSC or corneal cells, in vivo and in vitro. Conclusions: These results suggest that corneal differentiation following air exposure may regulate HSP 72 and HSC 70 expression. In addition, HSP 72 and HSP 90 may protect LSC and corneal cells against oxidative stress...|$|E
