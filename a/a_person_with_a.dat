5|$|Sultan Iskandar is {{reputed to}} have been a staunch disciplinarian, with {{willingness}} to occasionally voice personal opinions on governmental issues. On the personal side, subjects who have personally approached the Sultan in his later years described him as <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> warm and generous personality. However, past critics had also argued that Sultan Iskandar was <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> turbulent temper. These claims were made by citing records of past notorious incidents, which include an experience of being disinherited from being the Tunku Mahkota of Johor (or Crown Prince in English) by his father, in 1961, as well as a series of alleged criminal acts occurring between the 1970s and the 1990s which were published in the press and provoked widespread moral outrage within the Malaysian public.|$|E

5000|$|According to Whitley and Kite, <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> Intrinsic Religious Orientation {{sincerely}} {{believes in}} their religion {{and all its}} teachings and attempt {{to live their lives}} as their religion preaches that they should (Whitley & Kite, 2010).

5|$|The initial {{steps for}} {{evaluating}} <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> suspected subarachnoid hemorrhage are obtaining a medical history and performing a physical examination.

5|$|Goffman's book Stigma: Notes on the Management of Spoiled Identity (1963) {{examines}} how, {{to protect}} their identities when they depart from approved standards of behavior or appearance, people manage impressions of themselves – mainly through concealment. Stigma pertains to the shame that a person may feel {{when he or she}} fails to meet other people's standards, and to the fear of being discredited – which causes the individual not to reveal his or her shortcomings. Thus, <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> criminal record may simply withhold that information from fear of being judged by whomever that person happens to encounter.|$|E

5|$|Several press {{accounts}} {{reported that}} Timoshenko {{was shot by}} an unlicensed gun that came from Virginia. Previous reports indicated that the gun dealer had previously been indicted for his illegal gun sales, and that all the weapons found in the BMW were illegally obtained. The gun shop in question is now closed, and the dealer has been stripped of his license. Because the gun was used by <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> criminal history, and because the NYPD was denied requests to look up the seller of the gun, legislators sought {{to make it easier}} for law enforcement to carry out their investigative duties.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{ketogenic}} diet {{alters the}} body's metabolism, it is a first-line therapy {{in children with}} certain congenital metabolic diseases such as pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) deficiency and glucose transporter 1 deficiency syndrome, which prevent the body from using carbohydrates as fuel, leading to a dependency on ketone bodies. The ketogenic diet is beneficial in treating the seizures and some other symptoms in these diseases and is an absolute indication. On the other hand, it is absolutely contraindicated {{in the treatment of}} other diseases such as pyruvate carboxylase deficiency, porphyria and other rare genetic disorders of fat metabolism. <b>A</b> <b>person</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> disorder of fatty acid oxidation is unable to metabolise fatty acids, which replace carbohydrates as the major energy source on the diet. On the ketogenic diet, their body would consume its own protein stores for fuel, leading to ketoacidosis, and eventually coma and death.|$|E
5|$|Both {{environmental}} factors and genetics {{are associated with}} alcoholism with about half the risk attributed to each. <b>A</b> <b>person</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> parent or sibling with alcoholism is {{three to four times}} more likely to be alcoholic themselves. Environmental factors include social, cultural, and behavioral influences. High stress levels, anxiety, as well as inexpensive easily accessible alcohol increases risk. People may continue to drink partly to prevent or improve symptoms of withdrawal. A low level of withdrawal may last for months following stopping. Medically, alcoholism is considered both a physical and mental illness. Both questionnaires and certain blood tests may detect people with possible alcoholism. Further information is then collected to confirm the diagnosis.|$|E

Meanwhile, Roxas, Sora's Nobody, is trapped in a virtual simulation of Twilight Town, created by DiZ to merge Roxas with his original self to restore Sora's power. DiZ's plans are threatened when Nobodies led by Axel, Roxas's former friend in Organization XIII, infiltrate the virtual town. However, Roxas is able to repel the Nobodies and finally merges with Sora. Sora, Donald, and Goofy wake up in the real Twilight Town and meet King Mickey and Yen Sid, who send them on another journey. Their goal is to find Riku and figure out the plans of Organization XIII, who control the Nobodies—the empty shell left over when <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> strong heart is turned into a Heartless.

5|$|The idea of {{it being}} a simpler project due to the {{original}} art being reusable {{turned out to be}} untrue: because so much time had passed since the original's release, there were multiple parts that had to be reworked, leading to a process similar to creating a whole new game from scratch. All character graphics were redone, special effects were changed, and certain animations were added, such as sleeping animations. Some item placements were changed, the overall difficulty was adjusted, and some characters' battle statistics were altered; one such instance was making Kechi stronger than Oryu, due to it being perceived as illogical that <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sword would be weaker than a person fighting with her bare hands.|$|E
