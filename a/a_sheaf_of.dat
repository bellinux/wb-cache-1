He is sometimes depicted riding a man. The description of deformities like the broken teeth, three legs, three heads and four arms appear only in the later Puranic texts. Kubera holds a mace, a pomegranate or a money bag in his hand. He may also carry <b>a</b> <b>sheaf</b> <b>of</b> jewels or a mongoose with him. In Tibet, the mongoose is considered a symbol of Kubera's victory over Nāgas—the guardians of treasures. Kubera is usually depicted with a mongoose in Buddhist iconography.|$|E

Her father, Charles Doolittle, was professor of astronomy at Lehigh University and her mother, Helen (Wolle), was a Moravian with {{a strong interest in}} music. H.D. was their only surviving daughter in a family of five sons. In 1896, Charles Doolittle was appointed Flower Professor of Astronomy at the University of Pennsylvania, and the family moved to a house in Upper Darby. She attended Philadelphia's Friends' Central High School, at Fifteenth and Race streets, graduating in 1905. In 1901, she met and befriended Ezra Pound, who was {{to play a major role}} both in her private life and her emergence as a writer.

5|$|Between 1892 and 1895 the Agapemonites {{built the}} Church of the Good Shepherd in Upper Clapton, London. It was {{designed}} by Joseph Morris in a Gothic style. Although it is fairly conventional in floor plan, {{the outside of the}} church is a riot of statuary and symbolism. The main doorways sport large carvings of angels and the four evangelists symbolised by a man, an eagle, a bull and a lion. The same four figures, cast in bronze, look out over the four quarters of the Earth {{from the base of the}} steeple. The two flanking weather vanes show a certain symbolic debt to William Blake's Jerusalem depicting, as they do, a fiery chariot and <b>a</b> <b>sheaf</b> <b>of</b> arrows (presumably of desire), while the main steeple is clearly surmounted by a spear. The stained glass windows, designed by noted children's book illustrator Walter Crane, and made by J. S. Sparrow, betray the unconventional nature of the sect as they illustrate the 'true station of womankind'. The church was abandoned after 1956 and now is used by the Georgian Orthodox Church.|$|E

Linderman apparently selected the designs from two different patterns.

At her back is <b>a</b> <b>sheaf</b> <b>of</b> wheat, expressing, with the bales of goods, the commercial character of the coin: the right hand extended holds the olive branch."

The eagle has three arrows in the right claw and an olive branch in the left, a reversal to most other U.S. silver coins of the era.

500|$|The {{entrance}} to an Inari shrine is usually marked {{by one or}} more vermilion torii and some statues of kitsune, which are often adorned with red yodarekake (votive bibs) by worshippers out of respect.

[...] The main shrine is the Fushimi Inari Shrine in Fushimi, Kyoto, Japan, where the paths up the shrine hill are marked in this fashion. [...] The kitsune statues are at times taken for a form of Inari, and they typically come in pairs, representing a male and a female. [...] These fox statues hold a symbolic item in their mouths or beneath a front paw—most often a jewel and a key, but <b>a</b> <b>sheaf</b> <b>of</b> rice, a scroll, or a fox cub are all common. [...] Almost all Inari shrines, no matter how small, will feature at least a pair of these statues, usually flanking or on the altar or in front of the main sanctuary. [...] The statues are rarely realistic; they are typically stylized, portraying a seated animal with its tail in the air looking forward. [...] Despite these common characteristics, the statues are highly individual in nature; no two are quite the same.|$|E
