40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to evaluate the performance history of continuous bridge decks in the State of Georgia, to determine why the current design detail works, to recommend a new design <b>detail</b> <b>if</b> <b>necessary,</b> and to recommend the maximum and/or optimum lengths of continuous bridge decks. The continuous bridge decks have continuous reinforcement over the junction of two edge beams with a construction joint for crack control. The current technical literature and current practices and design procedures were synthesized and summarized. GDOT maintenance reports were reviewed, and field evaluations were conducted to determine the performance of the continuous deck detail. The effects of bridge movement due to thermal strains, shrinkage, and live loads were considered in the analytical studies to better understand the demands placed on the GDOT continuous deck detail. A summary of the design and length recommendations was provided upon completion of the research. M. S.

40|$|For {{supersonic}} airline operations, {{significantly higher}} environmental temperature {{is the primary}} new factor affecting structural service life. Methods for incorporating the influence of temperature in detailed fatigue analyses are shown along with current test indications. Thermal effects investigated include real-time compared with short-time testing, long-time temperature exposure, and stress-temperature cycle phasing. A method is presented which allows designers and stress analyzers to check fatigue resistance of structural design details. A communicative rating system is presented which defines the relative fatigue quality of the detail so that the analyst can define cyclic-load capability of the design detail by entering constant-life charts for varying <b>detail</b> quality. <b>If</b> <b>necessary</b> then, this system allows the designer to determine {{ways to improve the}} fatigue quality for better life or to determine the operating stresses which will provide the required service life...|$|R

This work presents flow-map-based techniques for the comparative visualization of user flows at different time frames, in order to enable dialog designers to analyze and improve the user interaction with these systems. Natural Language Systems in Voice Portals: More sophisticated voice portals use natural language systems (NLS), giving users the option to actually talk to the system in whole sentences. The system tries to interpret these sentences and interactively asks the user for <b>detailed</b> information, <b>if</b> <b>necessary.</b> Portals using NLS are rather large and complex, making it difficult to analyze their performance.

50|$|In {{the plant}} design, the units are sized for the maximum {{capacity}} each {{may have to}} handle. Similarly, sizes for pipes, pumps, compressors, and associated equipment are chosen for the flow capacity they have to handle. Utility systems such as electric power and water supply should also {{be included in the}} plant design. Additional piping lines for non-routine or alternate operating procedures, such as plant or unit startups and shutdowns, may have to be included. Fluid systems design commonly includes isolation valves around various units or parts of a plant so that a section of a plant could be isolated in case of a problem such as a leak in a unit. If pneumatically or hydraulically actuated valves are used, a system of pressurizing lines to the actuators is needed. Any points where process samples may have to be taken should have sampling lines, valves, and access to them included in the <b>detailed</b> design. <b>If</b> <b>necessary,</b> provisions should be made for reducing high pressure or temperature of a sampling stream, such including a pressure reducing valve or sample cooler.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{prevalence}} of {{type 2 diabetes}} is rising, {{and most of these}} patients also have hypertension, substantially increasing the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The majority of these patients do not reach target blood pressure levels {{for a wide variety of}} reasons. When a literature review provided no clear focus for action when patients are not at target, we initiated a study to identify characteristics of patients and providers associated with achieving target BP levels in community-based practice. Methods We conducted a practice- based, cross-sectional observational and mailed survey study. The setting was the practices of 27 family physicians and nurse practitioners in 3 eastern provinces in Canada. The participants were all patients with type 2 diabetes who could understand English, were able to give consent, and would be available for follow-up for more than one year. Data were collected from each patient's medical record and from each patient and physician/nurse practitioner by mailed survey. Our main outcome measures were overall blood pressure at target (Results Fifty-four percent were at target for both systolic and diastolic pressures. Sixty-two percent were at systolic target, and 79 % were at diastolic target. Patients who reported eating food low in salt had higher odds of reaching target blood pressure. Similarly, patients reporting low adherence to their medication regimen had lower odds of reaching target blood pressure. Conclusions When primary care health professionals are dealing with blood pressures above target in a patient with type 2 diabetes, they should pay particular attention to two factors. They should inquire about dietary salt intake, strongly emphasize the importance of reduction, and refer for <b>detailed</b> counseling <b>if</b> <b>necessary.</b> Similarly, they should inquire about adherence to the medication regimen, and employ a variety of patient-oriented strategies to improve adherence. </p...|$|R
40|$|Renewable {{energies}} like {{wind energy}} and {{concentrated solar power}} systems have a fluctuating energy production - for example {{when there is no}} wind or sun available. But it is the approach to provide a continuous power supply. For that reason, energy storage systems have to be included. State of the art for concentrated solar power systems are molten salt storages where the heat is stored as sensible heat. A prom-ising approach is the thermochemical energy storage because it stores sensible heat and chemical energy on top of that as well. Metal oxides are used as storage medi-um due to their reversible redox reaction which offers several benefits like high stor-age capacities and a high temperature range depending on the used oxide. In this thesis a reducing reactor is both technically and thermally designed. This reac-tor operates continuously and is directly irradiated for heating a metal oxide and store the heat in a redox reaction and also as sensible heat. Firstly, the theoretical back-ground of concentrated solar power systems, heat transfer phenomena, energy stor-ages and redox reactions of metal oxides are explained. Different reactor types are introduced, but the rotary kiln is the most promising one because it offers great ver-satility. The main part of this thesis focuses on the reactor design. A morphological box is used to demonstrate the method for each feature of the kiln. Thereby, topics such as thermodynamics, mechanics and material science are considered. Every feature is discussed in <b>detail</b> and, <b>if</b> <b>necessary,</b> FEM analyses are performed, i. e. to evaluate the mechanical stress. A designed plant layout in form of a P&I diagram is used as reference to develop a control software and analysing all process parame-ters. Finally, preliminary experiments are conducted for providing all necessary data to perform the thermal and chemical tests...|$|R

The budget is being prepared at an annual level, which means each next year a new one is prepared. In order {{to determine whether the}} budget has met some basic requirements, that is, whether it has been: efficient, effective, legal and purpose-used, consistent etc., each year the State Audit Office performs financial audit, success audit and audit of the regularity. 	After the performed audit, the conclusions of the conducted audit are sent to the Ministry of Finance, in written form, where they are explained in <b>detail</b> and, <b>if</b> <b>necessary,</b> appropriate recommendations are provided. From the performed audit, reports were prepared for: the system of internal controls in the procedure of the planning of the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia and the financial reports of the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia for the year preceding the year, subject to revision. If we make an analysis {{of the results of the}} conducted audits of the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia we could realize: whether the recommendations provided in the final report for the system of internal controls in the procedure of planning the budget of the Republic of Macedonia are conducted, whether there are controls that will ensure legality, completeness, accuracy and timeliness in the process of collecting the source revenues of the Budget of the Republic of Macedonia, whether the control procedures are functioning efficiently and properly, in relation to the prevention or the detection of errors in the process of the Budget execution, whether the financial report expresses the result of the financial activities truthfully and objectively, in accordance with the applied legislation.

40|$|A geostatistical {{method for}} the {{production}} of abiotic maps on a national scale has been proposed and successfully applied. Reference maps for moisture, acidity/alkalinity, nitrogen and salinity conditions were obtained on the basis of related Ellenberg F, R, N and S values averaged from plant species present in field samples. Actual and historical data were interpolated to illustrate the actual and historical abiotic situations in the Netherlands, resulting in grid maps of 250 x 250 m 2 and 1000 x 1000 m 2 resolution, respectively. Prior to interpolation, data were selected from two time periods (1930 to 1970 and 1991 to 1997) and stratified {{on the basis of the}} dominant soil types underlying the vegetation records. Interpolation was done through local ordinary block kriging. This method allows us to produce unbiased estimates with their respective estimation errors at different geographical scales. The resulting maps were compared to other available information and discrepancies analysed. Overall, our results agree with other abiotic maps and expert knowledge. There are, however, inaccuracies in the interpolation results, caused mainly by sampling (design), stratification and the assumptions chosen for the interpolation. Inferences about the results and especially comparison of abiotic site conditions in time will require <b>detailed</b> analysis and, <b>if</b> <b>necessary,</b> corrections of these inaccuracies. We suggest further detailed examination of the maps presented and correction of obvious errors in the maps prior to their application for reference...|$|R
