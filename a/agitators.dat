5|$|The Anti-Hindi {{imposition}} agitations in Tamil Nadu {{also had}} a considerable impact on the neighbouring states of Andhra Pradesh, Mysore and Kerala. The 1965 agitations evoked a strong response from the Tamils of Bangalore city. In Mysore, over 2000 <b>agitators</b> gathered to protest Hindi and the police had to launch a lathi charge when the agitation grew violent. In Andhra Pradesh, trains were damaged and colleges were shut down.|$|E
5|$|Historians hold differing {{views as}} to whether the mounted police were neutral in these {{disputes}} or sided with the employers, although all agree that the position of the police in managing the strikes became more difficult as organised labour became better established. The mounted police disliked labour <b>agitators</b> and strikers with eastern or southern European backgrounds, but they also had some sympathy for the difficulties faced by ordinary workers, and were often unwilling to actively assist the company owners if there was a risk it might cause disturbances to break out.|$|E

50|$|During {{the wash}} cycle, the outer tub {{is filled with}} water {{sufficient}} to fully immerse and suspend the clothing freely in the basket. The movement of the <b>agitator</b> pushes water outward between the paddles towards {{the edge of the}} tub. The water then moves outward, up the sides of the basket, towards the center, and then down towards the <b>agitator</b> to repeat the process, in a circulation pattern similar to the shape of a torus. The <b>agitator</b> direction is periodically reversed, because continuous motion in one direction would just lead to the water spinning around the basket with the <b>agitator</b> rather than the water being pumped in the torus-shaped motion. Some washers supplement the water-pumping action of the <b>agitator</b> with a large rotating screw on the shaft above the <b>agitator,</b> to help move water downwards {{in the center of the}} basket.|$|R

Frantz is appointed the war leader for pledging to kill the most people.|$|E
5|$|An {{investigation}} by the Metropolitan and City of London Police forces identified Gardstein's accomplices, {{most of whom were}} arrested within two weeks. The police were informed that the final two members of the gang were hiding at 100 Sidney Street in Stepney. The police evacuated local residents from the environs, and on the morning of 3 January a firefight broke out. Armed with inferior weapons, the police sought assistance from the army. The siege lasted for about six hours. Towards the end of the stand-off, the building caught fire; no single cause has been identified. One of the <b>agitators</b> in the building was shot before the fire took control. While the London Fire Brigade were damping down the ruins—in which they found the two bodies—the building collapsed, killing a fireman, Superintendent Charles Pearson.|$|E
50|$|In the 1970s, Whirlpool {{developed}} a dual-action washing machine <b>agitator</b> that utilized the bottom {{portion of the}} shaft for the usual oscillating motion but added an upper sleeve {{that was designed to}} work as an auger. The auger propelled water and clothing downwards toward the <b>agitator's</b> oscillating vanes so as to produce more uniform scrubbing. Whirlpool secured three Canadian patents for this work. In the first patent, the dual <b>agitator</b> was powered by a drive shaft. A second patent (known as the '803 patent) substituted a clutch mechanism for the drive shaft. Both patent specifications described the <b>agitator's</b> vanes as being rigid. Whirlpool's third patent, known as the '734 patent, featured flexible vanes on the lower <b>agitator</b> instead of rigid vanes.|$|R

The results of the trials clearly indicated that at a churning temperature of 18 degree C, the average fat content of the butter milk was about 1. 4 percent using the traditional method compared with 0. 3 percent using the <b>agitator.</b> The average percentage of fat recovered was about 60 percent, compared with 76 percent when using the <b>agitator.</b> The length of time required for churning was 65 minutes for the <b>agitator</b> method...|$|R
5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the second}} day of the strike, which has spread to Buffland's rival city of Clearfield , the mood among the laborers has turned ugly. Temple warns that the attacks on Algonquin Avenue are imminent, and aids Farnham's force in turning back assaults on the captain's house and on the Belding residence. Bott and Sleeny are {{captured}} by the force; the former is sent to prison but Farnham has pity on Sleeny as a good workman, and the carpenter serves only a few days. The settlement of the strike in Clearfield takes the wind out of the Buffland action, and soon most are back at work, though some <b>agitators</b> are dismissed.|$|E
5|$|Coakley {{summed up}} his {{prosecution}} case on September 22. His {{aim was to}} show the court that a conspiracy had taken placethe mass of accounts from officers and men appeared to support the conclusion that ringleaders and <b>agitators</b> had forced a rebellion against authority. Veltmann pointed out that few of the accused had been ordered to load ammunition, meaning {{that they could not}} all be guilty of the charge of disobeying orders. Veltmann stressed that much of the testimony was hearsay and failed to establish a conspiracy or a mutiny. The court, however, seemed to side with Coakley on all points, settling each objection in favor of the prosecution.|$|E
5|$|During 1946–50, {{there were}} {{sporadic}} agitations against Hindi by the Dravidar Kazhagam (DK) and Periyar. Whenever the government introduced Hindi as a compulsory language in schools, anti-Hindi protests happened and succeeded in stopping the move. The largest anti-Hindi imposition agitations {{in this period}} occurred in 1948–50. After India obtained independence in 1947, the Congress Government at the Centre urged all states to make Hindi compulsory in schools. The Congress Government of Madras Presidency under Omandur Ramasamy Reddiar complied and made Hindi compulsory from the academic year 1948–49. It also introduced a minimum mark qualification in Hindi {{for the promotion of}} students to higher classes. Periyar once again launched an anti-Hindi imposition agitation. The 1948 agitation was supported by former Congress nationalists like M. P. Sivagnanam and Thiru. Vi. Ka, who recanted their earlier pro-Hindi policies. On 17 July, the DK convened an all party anti-Hindi conference to oppose the compulsory Hindi teaching. As in the agitation of 1938–40, this agitation was also characterized by strikes, black flag demonstrations and anti-Hindi processions. When Rajaji (then the Governor-General of India) visited Madras on 23 August, the DK staged a black flag demonstration protesting against his visit. On 27 August, Periyar and Annadurai were arrested. The Government did not change its position on Hindi and the agitation continued. On 18 December, Periyar and other DK leaders were arrested again. A compromise was reached between the government and <b>agitators.</b> The government stopped the legal action against the <b>agitators</b> and they in turn dropped the agitation on 26 December 1948. Eventually, the government made Hindi teaching optional from the academic year 1950–51. Students {{who did not want to}} learn Hindi were allowed to participate in other school activities during Hindi classes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Agitator</b> {{as a key}} {{component}} of fracturing unit, its dynamic characteristic has great influence on performance of fracturing fluid and operation of sand blender, so it is necessary to get the dynamic characteristic of <b>agitator.</b> In this study, we conduct the experimental modal test of <b>agitator</b> by using uTeKL dynamic signal analysis system. The modal test system structure, the procedure and the technique of modeling and testing is presented in detail. Also the finite element modal analysis of <b>agitator</b> is carried out with SolidWorks software. Modal test and finite element analysis reveal similar results with the maximum natural frequency error is 5. 15 % and corresponding modal shapes are nearly same, which means the method and technique of modal test proposed in this paper is correct, the result is confident, and the finite element modal analysis of the <b>agitator</b> is feasible...|$|R

The growing dissemination and popularity of conspiracy theories has also created an alliance between right-wing populist <b>agitators</b> (such as Alex Jones) and hip hop music's left-wing populist rappers (such as KRS-One, Professor Griff of Public Enemy and Immortal Technique), thus illustrating how anti-elitist conspiracism can create unlikely political allies in efforts to oppose a political system.|$|E
5|$|On December 29, 1876, {{a bridge}} over Ohio's Ashtabula River collapsed. The bridge {{had been built}} from metal cast at one of Stone's mills, and was {{carrying}} a train {{owned and operated by}} Stone's Lake Shore and Michigan Railway. Ninety-two people died; it was the worst rail disaster in American history up to that point. Blame fell heavily on Stone, who departed for Europe to recuperate and left Hay in charge of his businesses. The summer of 1877 was marked by labor disputes; a strike over wage cuts on the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad soon spread to the Lake Shore, much to Hay's outrage. He blamed foreign <b>agitators</b> for the dispute, and vented his anger over the strike in his only novel, The Bread-Winners (1883).|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1960s, the Iberian-type {{horse was}} called the Andalusian in both Portugal and Spain. In 1966, the Lusitano name was adopted by Portugal after a {{studbook}} separation by the two countries. The revolutions of Portugal's African colonies resulted in the near economic collapse of Portugal. The landed class attracted political <b>agitators,</b> estates were vacated, and stud farms were broken up and their horses sold to Spain. However, the best lines were saved {{through the efforts of}} breeders, and breeding soon increased. Today, Lusitanos are bred mainly in Portugal and Brazil, but maintain a presence in many other countries throughout the world, including Australia, the United States, Great Britain, South Africa, and other European countries. Crossbred horses of partial Lusitano blood are popular, especially when crossed with Andalusian, Arabian or Thoroughbred blood.|$|E

5000|$|As with {{front-loading}} washers, clothing {{should not}} be packed tightly into a top-loading washer. Although wet fabric usually fits into a smaller space than dry fabric, a dense wad of fabric can restrict water circulation, resulting in poor soap distribution and incomplete rinsing.

5|$|Soviet Russia, {{while at}} the time {{publicly}} supporting Polish and Lithuanian independence, sponsored communist <b>agitators</b> working against {{the government of the}} Second Polish Republic, and considered that its eastern borders should approximate those of the defunct Congress Poland. Poles and Lithuanians, on the other hand, inspired by memories of the greatness of the erstwhile Grand Duchy of Lithuania, part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, saw their borders as lying much farther east. The leader of the Polish forces, Józef Piłsudski, discerned an opportunity for regaining territories that were once the part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, and since then were part of the Prussian Empire, shaken by the 1917 Revolution and the ongoing Russian Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Van der Byl {{was born}} and raised in Cape Town, the son of the South African {{politician}} P V van der Byl, and served in the Middle East and Europe during the Second World War. After a high-flying international education, he moved to the self-governing British colony of Southern Rhodesia in 1950 to manage family farms. He went into politics in the early 1960s through his involvement with farming trade bodies, and became a government minister responsible for propaganda. One of the leading <b>agitators</b> for Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence in 1965, Van der Byl was afterwards responsible for introducing press censorship. He was unsuccessful in his attempt to persuade international opinion to recognise Rhodesia, but was popular among members of his own party.|$|E
5|$|ZAPU members {{attempted}} to bomb or burn down {{the houses of}} blacks who joined or supported white-led political parties, {{as well as the}} churches they attended. Rival nationalists also used violence against each other as they jostled for prominence.

The British government, worried that Southern Rhodesia might issue a unilateral declaration of independence (UDI) rather than continue with negotiations, placed troops in Aden on alert.|$|E

40|$|In {{support of}} the HB-Line Engineering <b>agitator</b> mixing project, flow pattern {{calculations}} have been made for a 45 degrees pitched three-blade <b>agitator</b> submerged in a flat rectangular tank. The work is intended to determine <b>agitator</b> speeds that provide acceptable mixing performance for various tank liquid levels based on flow rates past solids deposited on the bottom surface of the flat tank. The modeling results will help ensure the acceptable suspension of solid particles {{as a function of}} <b>agitator</b> speed and tank liquid level during precipitation operations. The numerical modeling and calculations have been performed using a computational fluid dynamics approach. Three-dimensional steady-state momentum and continuity equations were used as the basic equations to estimate fluid motion driven by an <b>agitator</b> with three 45 degrees pitched blades. Hydraulic conditions were fully turbulent (Reynolds number about 2 x 104). A standard two-equation turbulence model (k-e), was used to capture turbulent eddy motion. The commercial finite volume code, Fluent [7], was used to create a prototypic geometry file with a non-orthogonal mesh. Hybrid meshing was used to fill the computational region between the round-edged tank bottom and <b>agitator</b> regions. At high rotational speeds and low tank levels, a surface vortex can reach the <b>agitator</b> blades and allow air to be drawn into the solid-fluid mixing zone. This is not desirable in terms of mixing performance. The analysis results show that the lowest liquid level among the four considered, 4. 5 inches, is higher than the critical liquid height for air entrainment for <b>agitator</b> speeds up to 600 rpm. All the analysis results demonstrate that about 600 rpm provides adequate solids mixing capability for various tank levels (12, 8. 5, 7, and 4. 5 inches) containing 20 -micron solids with a specific gravity of 2. 5...|$|R

5|$|On 25 January, a {{clash between}} {{agitating}} students and Congress party workers in Madurai went {{out of control and}} became a riot. Rioting soon spread {{to other parts of the}} State. Police responded with lathi charges and firing on student processions. Acts of arson, looting and damage to public property became common. Railway cars and Hindi name boards at railway stations were burned down; telegraph poles were cut and railway tracks displaced. The Bhaktavatsalam Government considered the situation as a law and order problem and brought in para military forces to quell the agitation. Incensed by police action, violent mobs killed two police men. Several <b>agitators</b> committed suicide by self-immolation and by consuming poison. In two weeks of riots, around 70 people were killed (by official estimates). Some unofficial reports put the death toll as high as 500. A large number of students were arrested.

Their numbers continued to grow and with restless energy the group began to march. More women from other nearby marketplaces joined in, many bearing kitchen blades and other makeshift weapons, as the tocsins rang from church towers throughout several districts. Driven by a variety of <b>agitators,</b> the mob converged on the Hôtel de Ville where they demanded not only bread, but arms.
