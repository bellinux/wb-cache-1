5|$|The Blonde Bear {{was one of}} the world's {{greatest}} football players, {{who never}} missed an open field block. When one considers he made Walter Camp's All-America team when he was backing up the line on defense and blocking <b>and</b> <b>catching</b> passes on offense, his greatness is realized.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{immediately}} {{after the start of}} the second-half Hearts were awarded a penalty kick. Kujabi fouled Suso by pulling his jersey <b>and</b> <b>catching</b> his heel, but television replays showed that the foul had taken place outside the penalty area. Hibs were also reduced to ten men as Kujabi received his second yellow card, resulting in a red. Danny Grainger converted the penalty, which was also his first goal for Hearts. Soon afterwards, Ryan McGowan scored with a header after Hibs keeper Brown had initially saved from Stephen Elliott. Skácel finished the scoring with another shot from just outside the box to make it 5-1 for Hearts.|$|E
50|$|Pondexter {{missed a}} short jumper, <b>and</b> <b>Catchings</b> {{went for the}} rebound. She tried to call timeout, but Willingham tied her up and a jump ball was called.|$|R
5|$|Holdsclaw led Tennessee with 22 points, {{although}} Liberty's Sharon Wilkerson led all scorers with 26. Four other Lady Vols reached double figures, {{and both}} Holdsclaw <b>and</b> <b>Catchings</b> had double-doubles.|$|R

5|$|Black-backed and side-striped jackals, and African golden wolves {{will feed}} {{alongside}} hyenas, though {{they will be}} chased if they approach too closely. Spotted hyenas will sometimes follow jackals and wolves during the gazelle fawning season, as jackals and wolves are effective at tracking <b>and</b> <b>catching</b> young animals. Hyenas do not take to eating wolf flesh readily; four hyenas were reported to take half an hour in eating a golden wolf. Overall, the two animals typically ignore each other {{when there is no}} food or young at stake.|$|E
5|$|Drafted by the Baltimore Colts in {{the twentieth}} round as the 203rd overall pick of the 1954 NFL Draft, Berry was {{considered}} a long-shot {{to make the team}} roster. After being used sparingly as a rookie, catching only 13 passes, he became a permanent starter on the team by his second NFL season when the Colts acquired quarterback Johnny Unitas. Over the next 12 seasons together, the two {{became one of the most}} dominant passing <b>and</b> <b>catching</b> duos in NFL history. Berry, who did not miss a single game until his eighth year in the league, led the NFL in receptions and receiving yards three times and in receiving touchdowns twice.|$|E
5|$|For the defense, Virginia Tech cornerback Jimmy Williams {{was the top}} performer. Williams had 10tackles, {{including}} 3.5tackles for loss, and one interception. Tech's Mikal Baaqee {{had eight}} tackles and one fumble recovery, making him the game's second-leading tackler. Auburn defender Derrick Graves was the most prolific tackler for the Tigers, making seven tackles <b>and</b> <b>catching</b> one interception of an errant Bryan Randall pass. Three players had one sack—two for Virginia Tech and one for Auburn.|$|E

50|$|Hoffman's {{long shot}} from the left corner put Indiana ahead in the final minute. Pondexter rushed downcourt and missed a layup, <b>and</b> <b>Catchings</b> rebounded. Then Indiana missed twice in close, but got the {{offensive}} rebound. January dribbled {{the ball out of}} bounds with 22 seconds left, though, to give Phoenix a final chance.|$|R

5|$|Having assumed this {{formation}} {{upon the}} giving of a prearranged signal, the Allied ships moved suddenly outwards from this position {{at a second}} signal, rowing into the Persian ships <b>and</b> <b>catching</b> them off guard. Their superior seamanship negated, the Persians came off worst from the encounter with 30 of their ships captured or sunk. During the battle a Greek ship, captained by Antidorus of Lemnos, defected to the Allies. Nightfall then ended the battle, with the Allies having fared better than they possibly expected to.|$|E
5|$|Hussein Saeed {{started playing}} {{football}} {{in the streets}} before joining Al-Iskan's youth center. He led them to an Iraq Youth Centers' Championship, scoring a hat-trick in a 4–2 win against Al-Zawra'a youth team <b>and</b> <b>catching</b> the eye of Dawoud Al-Azzawi, {{the manager of the}} Iraq national under-17 football team and Iraq national varsity football team. Al-Azzawi called him up to the varsity team and, in his first competitive tournament with the team, he won the gold medal in the 1975 Arab Schools Games in Egypt.|$|E
5|$|Netball Australia {{also runs}} a {{modified}} game called Netta aimed at 8- to 11-year-olds. The goal height and ball size {{are the same}} as for adults, but players rotate positions during the game, permitting each player to play each position. Netta was created to develop passing <b>and</b> <b>catching</b> skills. Its rules permit six seconds between catching and passing the ball, instead of the three seconds permitted in the adult game. Most players under 11 play this version at netball clubs.|$|E

50|$|Publius Sittius was a Roman {{mercenary}} who {{allied with}} Julius Caesar {{in the civil}} war between Pompey <b>and</b> Caesar, ultimately <b>catching</b> <b>and</b> killing Faustus Cornelius Sulla.|$|R
50|$|Foster <b>and</b> <b>Catchings</b> {{rejected}} traditional laissez-faire {{economics and}} called for aggressive federal involvement to balance the economy lest destabilizing forces upset prosperity. The main problem was underconsumption, which could be overcome by strategic government spending in public works. The theory strongly influenced the anti-depression programs of Herbert Hoover, and Franklin D. Roosevelt, as well as Federal Reserve Board Chairman Marriner Eccles.|$|R
5|$|Once a male {{has found}} a mate, he selects a territory, marking the {{boundaries}} by warbling as he flies from perch to perch. After circling the perimeter, he performs two flight displays, first repeating a low, flat flight, then flying in an exaggerated version of normal flight, tucking his wings close to his body, plummeting earthwards <b>and</b> <b>catching</b> himself as he spreads his wings to glide upward {{in a series of}} loops. Two or three pairs may group their territories together in a loose colony, perhaps to aid in defense against predators.|$|E
5|$|Points {{are awarded}} for each color change (25), {{defeating}} Coily with a flying disc (500), remaining discs {{at the end}} of a stage (at higher stages, 50 or 100) <b>and</b> <b>catching</b> green balls (100) or Slick and Sam (300 each). Bonus points are also awarded for completing a screen, starting at 1,000 for the first screen of Level 1 and increasing by 250 for each subsequent completion. Extra lives are granted for reaching certain scores, which are set by the machine operator.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{commented that}} the imaginative {{character}} designs and use of advanced graphics technology, such as hardware transform and lighting, and bump mapping, made the graphics of the game unrivaled in its time; ActionTrip was so impressed by the game's visuals that they thought their graphics card was supporting the complex hardware environmental bump mapping it was incapable of. The animation of Kabuto's antics such as elbow dropping onto tiny enemies, and tossing up <b>and</b> <b>catching</b> food with his mouth, in particular, won the praises of reviewers. Many critics, however, were disappointed that the computer versions of the game could not run smoothly at full details on the recommended system specifications.|$|E
5000|$|Academic {{economists are}} ready to ignore the 'crackpots', {{especially}} the monetary reformers. Johannsen, Foster <b>and</b> <b>Catchings,</b> Hobson <b>and</b> Gesell all had brilliant contributions to make in our day, but could receive no audience. It is hoped, {{that in the future}} economists will give a sympathetic ear to those who possess great economic intuition. Prof. Dr. Lawrence Klein, economist, University of Pennsylvania ...|$|R

50|$|Fish and {{shellfish}} that inhabit the water {{around the island}} include: king salmon, red salmon, silver salmon, pink salmon, chum salmon, halibut, lingcod, Pacific cod, a variety of rock fish, greenling, rat fish, dog sharks, dungeness crab, tanner crab, king crab, shrimp, prawns, scallops, abalone, clams, and jellyfish. There have also been reported sightings <b>and</b> <b>catchings</b> of great white sharks that have traveled up on warm currents.|$|R
5|$|The Canadiens {{played the}} Chicago Black Hawks in Montreal on January 28, 1937. In the first period, Morenz {{went after the}} puck in the Chicago end while being chased by Black Hawks defenceman Earl Seibert. Morenz lost his balance {{and fell to the}} ice, {{crashing}} into the boards <b>and</b> <b>catching</b> his left skate in the wooden siding. Seibert, unable to stop, landed on him with full force. The resulting impact snapped Morenz's left leg, creating a noise heard throughout the rink. Helped to the Canadiens bench by his teammates, Morenz was taken to Hôpital St-Luc, where it was found that his leg was fractured in four places.|$|E
5|$|The bat's upperparts are reddish-brown or grey, {{while the}} {{underside}} is generally paler. The wings are relatively large and darker in colour, with long tips {{that allow the}} bat to hover. Despite having two caudal vertebrae, Kitti's Hog-nosed Bat has no visible tail. There is a large web of skin between the hind legs (the uropatagium) which may assist in flying <b>and</b> <b>catching</b> insects, {{although there are no}} tail bones or calcars to help control it in flight.|$|E
5|$|The retreat {{was made}} even more serious {{by the fact that}} the gendarmes, tasked with {{stabilising}} the front <b>and</b> <b>catching</b> deserters, also fled in panic. The town itself was badly damaged, and the commanding officer of the 46th Regiment, Colonel Bronisław Krzywobłocki, was forced to order the retreat of the remainder of his forces south-west from the town. The rest of the division had no option but to fall back to the line of First World War trenches. During the chaotic withdrawal all the artillery sub-units got lost. By 19:00 hours the town was in Russian hands.|$|E

5|$|Bearing a nice narrow pointed bill {{adapted for}} probing <b>and</b> <b>catching</b> insects, the red-winged fairywren is {{primarily}} insectivorous; it forages {{and lives in}} the shelter of scrubby vegetation in temperate wetter forests dominated by the karri (Eucalyptus diversicolor), remaining close to cover to avoid predators. Like other fairywrens, it is a cooperative breeding species, with small groups of birds maintaining and defending small territories year-round. Groups consist of a socially monogamous pair with several helper birds who assist in raising the young. There is {{a higher proportion of}} female helpers recorded for this species than for other species of fairywren. A variety of vocalisations and visual displays have been recorded for communication and courtship in this species. Singing is used to advertise territory, and birds can distinguish other individuals on song alone. Male wrens pluck yellow petals and display them to females as part of a courtship display.|$|E
5|$|In 1150, {{it looked}} like Caithness and the whole earldom of Orkney {{were going to come}} under {{permanent}} Scottish control. However, David's plans for the north soon began to encounter problems. In 1151, King Eystein II of Norway put a spanner in the works by sailing through the waterways of Orkney with a large fleet <b>and</b> <b>catching</b> the young Harald unaware in his residence at Thurso. Eystein forced Harald to pay fealty as a condition of his release. Later in the year David hastily responded by supporting the claims to the Orkney earldom of Harald's rival Erlend Haraldsson, granting him half of Caithness in opposition to Harald. King Eystein responded in turn by making a similar grant to this same Erlend, cancelling the effect of David's grant. David's weakness in Orkney was that the Norwegian kings were not prepared to stand back and let him reduce their power.|$|E
5|$|Lace {{confessed to}} the murder on 17 September 1983. He gave a {{statement}} to police that he had stolen a rucksack and cash on 4December 1979 from the care home in Portsmouth {{where he had been}} living and then walked to Southampton. He was present {{at the rear of the}} Tom Tackle pub when DeSimone was dropped off by Savage, and then approached DeSimone when she got into her own vehicle. He first knocked on the window and asked the time but then forced his way into the driver's seat beside her and locked the doors to prevent her escaping. Once inside he sexually assaulted her and strangled her using the passenger seatbelt in the car. He then took her handbag and jewellery, and hid for approximately 10minutes before heading to Southampton Central station <b>and</b> <b>catching</b> a train back to Portsmouth.|$|E
