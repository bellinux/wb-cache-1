50|$|While {{generating}} {{a lot of}} hatred from fans and users on the internet, the video is {{only the tip of}} the iceberg when it comes to the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>subsidies</b> Emirates is receiving from the government “If you're Emirates, based in Dubai, you can install showers, butlers and bars on your A380s because your government owners deliver wheelbarrows of subsidy cash”. Whereas American airlines such as American Airlines, Delta Airlines, United Airlines, or their European counterparts must take costs into consideration and spend prudently, as they themselves do not have access to state treasuries. Emirates has spent over $11 billion in the purchase of goods and services, $2.4 billion from government assumption of fuel hedging losses and $2.3 billion from subsidised airport infrastructure. This mass subsidising creates an increasingly tilted playing field in which airlines compete. Not to mention, it violates the provisions of the two “Open Skies” agreements, which allowed the UAS open access to the U.S aviation market in exchange for fair competition, between the United States and the United Arab Emirates. This results in not only the violation of the agreement but also harms American jobs.|$|E
5000|$|The {{impact of}} {{agricultural}} subsidies {{in developed countries}} upon developing-country farmers and international development is well documented. Agricultural subsidies can help drive prices down to benefit consumers, but also mean that unsubsidised developing-country farmers have a more difficult time competing in the world market; and the effects on poverty are particularly negative when subsidies are provided for crops that are also grown in developing countries since developing-country farmers must then compete directly with subsidised developed-country farmers, for example in cotton and sugar. The IFPRI has estimated in 2003 {{that the impact of}} subsidies costs developing countries $24 billion in lost incomes going to agricultural and agro-industrial production; and more than $40Bn is displaced from net agricultural exports. [...] Moreover, the same study found that the least developed countries have a higher proportion of GDP dependent upon agriculture, at around 36.7%, thus may be even more vulnerable to the effects of subsidies. It has been argued that subsidised agriculture in the developed world {{is one of the greatest}} obstacles to economic growth in the developing world; which has an indirect impact on reducing the income available to invest in rural infrastructure such as health, safe water supplies and electricity for the rural poor. [...] The total <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>subsidies</b> that go towards agriculture in OECD countries far exceeds the amount that countries provide in development aid.

40|$|To motivate {{more people}} to {{participate}} in vaccination campaigns, various subsidy policies are often supplied by government and the health sectors. However, these external incentives may also alter the vaccination decisions of the broader public, and hence the choice of incentive needs to be carefully considered. Since human behavior and the networking-constrained interactions among individuals significantly impact the evolution of an epidemic, here we consider the voluntary vaccination on human contact networks. To this end, two categories <b>of</b> typical <b>subsidy</b> policies are considered: (1) under the free subsidy policy, the total <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>subsidy</b> is distributed to a certain fraction of individual and who are vaccinated without personal cost, and (2) under the partial-offset subsidy policy, each vaccinated person is offset by a certain <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>subsidy.</b> A vaccination decision model based on evolutionary game theory is established to study the effects <b>of</b> these different <b>subsidy</b> policies on disease control. Simulations suggest that, because the partial-offset subsidy policy encourages {{more people to}} take vaccination, its performance is significantly better than that <b>of</b> the free <b>subsidy</b> policy. However, an interesting phenomenon emerges in the partial-offset scenario: with limited <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> total <b>subsidy,</b> a moderate subsidy rate for each vaccinated individual can guarantee the group-optimal vaccination, leading to the maximal social benefits, while such an optimal phenomenon is not evident for the free <b>subsidy</b> scenario.

A sizable literature studies the relationship between general government spending and the proximity of elections, mostly documenting a positive link.

We focus on one type of government spending that can be quite vulnerable to becoming ‘targeted spending’, i. e. subsidies to firms. We empirically test the relationship between the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>subsidies</b> granted to firms at the local level and local support for incumbent parties in the regional government.

40|$|AbstractFor {{the open}} {{electricity}} market, {{the price of}} distributed generation (DG) will directly affect power producers and power supply enterprises operating costs. Generation cost of DG is higher than conventional power, {{in the absence of}} policy support and financial subsidies, there is not enough power to buy electric from DG; However, because of its characteristics, DG could reduce transmission losses to a certain extent, thereby reducing the cost of power grid. So generation cost difference between DG and conventional power generation does not accurately reflect the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>subsidies,</b> the pricing and subsidy policies is essential. In this paper, only considering transmission losses, on this premise, DG pricing critical value is proposed and calculated aiming at the transmission cost does not increase after fixing DG basing on node transmission cost analysis based on power dependency trace. If DG price is equal to the critical value, which indicate that benefits by reducing the transmission loss is enough to compensate for the losses caused by higher costs. If the price is higher than the critical value price, power system should be subsidized, and accurately calculate the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>subsidies.</b> Finally, IEEE 9 node system example shows the feasibility of the method...|$|E

This paper deals with the new {{issues raised by the}} PPP system or, more generally, by any system in which the new infrastructure is partially financed by its users. Is there, in this case, a new economic rationality of public authorities? Particularly, is there an optimal way to rank projects? Before proposing some answers to these questions, we briefly present a historical perspective of this new trend, showing that there is a paradox. After this, we calculate the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>subsidies</b> needed to transform any project into a profitable project. We then show that, when public subsidies are reduced, the priority of a given project is not adequately given by its Socio Economic Internal Rate of Return (IRRse), but by a combination of its Socio Economic Net Present Value and the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>subsidies</b> it needs to become profitable. We demonstrate the relevance of our criterion by optimization algorithms previously developed for physical systems...|$|E
