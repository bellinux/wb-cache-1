30|$|In this study, we {{employed}} an {{in vitro}} interactive cell co-culture model {{to demonstrate that}} adipose-derived MSCs could ameliorate the key pathological characteristics of cardiac fibrosis mediated by mFBs mainly in a direct cell-to-cell contact manner, namely direct intercellular communication. Consistent with previous studies, we obtained the inhibitory effects of conditioned medium from MSCs on the viability and α-SMA expression of mFBs, however, the effects were more significant in the direct co-culture system. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), one of the known factors that reduce fibrosis in multiple organs, was demonstrated {{to be a major}} contributor for MSCs’ anti-fibrosis function. Moreover, using the engineered co-culture platform, the paracrine activity was found to be dependent on the distance between the two cell populations <b>and</b> <b>be</b> <b>efficient</b> <b>at</b> a narrow gap width (500  μm). Proper therapeutic benefits of MSCs to myocardial infarction should be based on the amelioration of fibrosis condition, in order to provide a favorable microenvironment for cell survival and factor diffusion. The study here, for the first time, elucidated that MSCs could exert better therapeutic effects by directly communicating with pathogenic cells (i.e. mFBs in cardiac fibrosis). We anticipated that this study could provide novel insight and more precise guidance for cell therapy based on MSCs, e.g. to introduce MSCs sufficiently close to the disease foci. Systematic investigations into anti-fibrosis molecules that were involved during the therapy process were necessary to provide better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms for the regenerative capacity of MSCs and could lead to establishment of novel therapeutic approaches.|$|E

Reconstitution of membrane fusion in vitro proved that SNAREs constitute the minimal fusion machinery.

40|$|We {{present a}} case study on the {{verification}} of {{the design of a}} commercial multi-threaded task server (MTTS), developed by the Novabase company, used for massively parallelizing computational tasks. In a first stage, we employed the Plural tool, which is designed to perform lightweight verification of Java programs using a data-flow analysis (DFA) framework, to specify and verify the MTTS. We wrote the Plural specification for the MTTS based on the code developed by Novabase, its informal documentation, and our discussions with Novabase engineers, who validated our understanding of the MTTS application. The Plural specification language is based on typestates and access permissions. In a second stage, we developed the Pulse tool, which enhances the analysis performed by Plural, and used the tool on the MTTS specifications. Pulse translates Plural specifications into an abstract state-machine model that captures the semantics of all the possible concurrent programs implementing the given specifications, and uses the evmdd-smc symbolic model checker to verify the machine model.

40|$|Automated {{public health}} {{surveillance}} of disease counts for rapid outbreak, epidemic or bioterrorism detection using conventional control chart methods can be hampered by over-dispersion and background ('in-control') mean counts that vary over time. An adaptive cumulative sum (CUSUM) plan is developed for signalling unusually high incidence in prospectively monitored time series of over-dispersed daily disease counts with a non-homogeneous mean. Negative binomial transitional regression is used to prospectively model background counts and provide 'one-step-ahead' forecasts of the next day's count. A CUSUM plan then accumulates departures of observed counts from an offset (reference value) that is dynamically updated using the modelled forecasts. The CUSUM signals whenever the accumulated departures exceed a threshold. The amount of memory of past observations retained by the CUSUM plan {{is determined by the}} offset value; a smaller offset retains more memory <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>efficient</b> <b>at</b> detecting smaller shifts.

40|$|Cultured {{melanoma}} {{cell lines}} despite exhibiting similar in vitro morphology, display significant phenotypic and growth rate differences when propagated as in vivo xenografts.

The oncolytic activity of CVA 21 against in vivo melanoma xenografts, which possess rapid growth rates and more extensive vascular structure than SK-Mel- 28 xenografts warrants further investigation. In the present study we evaluated the oncolytic action of CVA 21 against rapidly growing melanoma xenografts (ME 4405) which exhibit a highly vascular phenotype. Flow cytometric analysis indicated that in vitro cultures of ME 4405 cells expressed comparable levels of the CVA 21 cellular receptors, ICAM- 1 (intercellular adhesion molecules- 1) and DAF (decay accelerating factor) to SK-Mel- 28 cells. Despite similar levels of CVA 21 receptor expression, SK-Mel- 28 cells {{appear to be more}} susceptible to viral lysis than ME 4405 cells, even though the kinetics of virus replication in both lines was comparable. Intratumoral, intraperitoneal or intravenous administration of CVA 21 were equally effective in reducing the tumor volume of ME 4405 xenografts in immunodeficient mice, and provides further evidence for the use of CVA 21 as a novel oncolytic agent against varying phenotypes of malignant melanoma...|$|R

Yet histology provides little insight into the underlying biology of gliomas <b>and</b> <b>is</b> limited in its ability to identify and guide new molecularly targeted therapies. We have performed large-scale gene expression analysis using the Affymetrix HG U 133 oligonucleotide arrays on 85 diffuse infiltrating gliomas of all histologic types to assess whether a gene expression-based, histologyindependent classifier is predictive of survival and to determine whether gene expression signatures provide insight into the biology of gliomas. We found that gene expression-based grouping of tumors is a more powerful survival predictor than histologic grade or age. The poor prognosis samples could be grouped into three different poor prognosis groups, each with distinct molecular signatures. We further describe a list of 44 genes whose expression patterns reliably classify gliomas into previously unrecognized biological and prognostic groups: these genes are outstanding candidates for use in histology-independent classification of high-grade gliomas. The ability of the large scale and 44 gene set expression signatures to group tumors into strong survival groups was validated with an additional external and independent data set from another institution composed of 50 additional gliomas.

Small numbers of clustered cells, 1 - 10 /culture well, could then be expanded as antigen-specific lines in presence of either antigen or mitogen, sodium periodate. Few antigen-specific lines could be isolated from the nonclustered fraction. When T cell lines derived from the dendritic T cell clusters were maintained without antigen, i. e. using second party (syngeneic antigen-presenting cells (APC] or irrelevant antigen bearing APC, i. e. third-party (HLA-mismatched) stimulator cells plus mitogen, the T cells retained their specificity for the original stimulating alloantigen over the time course tested, several weeks to months.
