40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{determine}} the tropane alkaloid content of genetically transformed hairy root cultures of <b>Atropa</b> <b>belladonna</b> <b>L.</b> Determination of alkaloids was performed by HPLC method. Samples were extracted with chloroform - methanol - cc. ammonia 15 : 5 : 1 (v/v/v). Crude extracts were purified on Extrelut columns. HPLC separation was performed on Luna C 8 reversed phase column. An isocratic mixture of acetonitrile - 30 mM phosphate buffer - methanol 12. 2 : 79. 7 : 8. 1 (v/v/v) was used as eluent. Peaks were identified by addition of standards and diode-array detection. Hyoscyamine, scopolamine and apoatropine were determined by external standard method at 210 nm. We measured the alkaloid content of genetically transformed in vitro cultures (hairy roots and reorganised plants) cultivated on Gamborg B 5 basic media. The highest hyoscyamine and scopolamine content was found in hairy root clone #K- 5 (0, 223 m/m%) and in hairy root clone #K- 4 (0, 018 m/m%) respectively.

40|$|Background: Some {{species from}} the Solanaceae family {{are still the}} cause of serious {{poisoning}} among youth in Slovenia. Usually intoxication is due to abuse of these plants to provoke hallucinations. There is still not enough data about the alkaloid content of these plants growing in Slovenia. Methods: Different plant samples were analyzed for the content of atropine and scopolamine with capillary electrophoresis after solid phase extraction of alkaloids. Plants were gathered from different areas of Slovenia between April and September 2004. Results: Results were compared and possible correlations between the alkaloid content and species, plant parts, growth conditions, and time of harvest were suggested. Atropine and scopolamine contents were assessed in deadly nightshade (<b>Atropa</b> <b>belladonna</b> <b>L.),</b> thorn apple (Datura stramonium L.), scopolia (Scopolia carniolica Jacq.) and angel trumpet. The common name angel trumpet is used for Datura inoxia Mill. {{as well as for}} different Brugmansia Pers. species. The most intriguing results were the variable alkaloid content in various Brugmansia species and generally great differences in alkaloid content among various plants and their plant parts. Conclusions: All investigated plants have noticeable atropine and/or scopolamine content. The content is variable between various plants and their plant parts and therefore special care should be taken in cases of possible intoxication. It was shown that smaller or greater amounts of ingested drug can cause the same level of intoxication due to the variability in alkaloid content. </p...|$|E
40|$|Callus {{cultures}} established from seedlings of <b>Atropa</b> <b>belladonna</b> <b>L.</b> and Atropa belladonna cultivar lutea Doll show {{no visible}} organ formation on a culture medium containing coconut milk and a-naphth-aleneacetic acid (NAA) as growth components. However, on transfer to medium without NAA they initiate both roots and shoots and continuous cultures of excised roots {{have been established}} from such roots and plants from such shoots. Segments of cultured excised roots derived from callus cultures and from seedlings were used to reestablish callus cultures on a synthetic medium and the calluses thus obtained used to initiate suspension cultures. The ability of cells in suspension cultures to exhibit morphogenesis via root or shoot or embryo-like structure formation has been exposed and examined by light microscopy. Root development is enhanced by supplementing an auxin (NAA) -free medium with either tropic or a-naphthoxyacetic acids and both these compounds can promote root initiation {{in the presence of}} inhibitory auxin levels. Callus and cell suspension cultures in the absence of visible organization contain choline but no tropane alkaloids. Atropine (hyoscyamine) can be detected in cultured excised roots, in roots initiated from suspension cultures and in plants and plantlets derived from such cell cultures. The nature and frequency of morphogenesis, and thus the alkaloid content of cell cultures, is dependent upon the composition of the culture medium, the length and number of previous culture passages through which the cultures have been propagated and (upon) the cultural techniques. The factors affecting morphogenetic expression and the suppression of alkaloid biosynthesis in organ-free cultures are discussed in relation to theories of morphogenesis in cell cultures...|$|E
40|$|Plant {{alkaloids}} {{are one of}} {{the largest}} groups of natural products and pharmacologically important compounds. The Solanaceae plants produce a range of biologically active alkaloids including nicotine and the tropane alkaloids, such as hyoscyamine (atropine) and scopolamine (hyoscine). Nicotine is known as a major alkaloid produced in the roots of many Nicotiana species. The pyridine ring of nicotine is synthesized by way of the pyridine nucleotide pathway, whereas its pyrolidine ring is derived from the diamine putrescine. Putrescine can also be metabolized to polyamines such as spermidine and spermine. The N-methylation of putrescine, catalyzed by putrescine N-methyltransferase (PMT), is the first and also the key step in the biosynthesis of nicotine and tropane alkaloids. It is known that nicotine is synthesized exclusively in the roots of tobacco plants. After being synthesized, nicotine and other tobacco alkaloids are translocated from the roots through the xylems to the leaves, where they accumulate to high levels (Katoh et al. 2005). The PMT cDNAs were cloned from tobacco (Hibi et al. 1994), <b>Atropa</b> <b>belladonna</b> <b>L.,</b> Hyoscyamus niger L. (Suzuki et al. 1999) and Solanum tuberosum L. (Stenzel et al. 2006). In Nicotiana sylvestris, three PMT genes (NsPMT 1, NsPMT 2 and NsPMT 3) were isolated and found to encode proteins highly homologous to each other. PMT transcripts are expressed and accumulate exclusively in the roots of tobacco, specifically in the cortex, endodermis and xylem (Shoji et al. 2000). In tobacco, the PMT expression level is well correlated with that of nicotine accumulation in the above-ground tissues. It has been shown that several distinct viral vectors can be used for the transient expression of foreign genes in plants, encoding for example peptides, antigen proteins (Porta et al. 2003; Fitchen et al. 1995; Sugiyam...|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Atropa</b> <b>belladonna</b> (Engl. deadly nightshade, Cro. velebilje, bunika) is a plant {{containing}} pharmacologically active, potentially toxic alkaloids: atropine, hyocyamine and scopolamine. The risk of poisoning {{in children}} {{is important because}} of possible confusion of black/dark blue belladonna fruit berries with other edible berries. There are many reports in literature of accidental intoxication but no report on traditional intentional usage to achieve hallucinogenic effects. Subjects and methods: Here we report purposeful ingestion of <b>Atropa</b> <b>belladonna</b> berries for hallucinatory effects among adolescents in Bjelovar region in north part of Croatia. This has been happening among children/adolescents while they were grazing animals. We visited a dozen villages {{in the region and}} spoke to the oldest mostly to the elderly residents. Results: The existence of such abuse of <b>Atropa</b> <b>belladonna</b> berries {{in the first part of}} XX century was confirmed by eight narrators from five distinct places in the region. Interestingly this type of behavior had a specific name "bunanje", unknown in Croatian language, but clearly associated with local plant name bun or bunika.

At the regional hospital in Bjelovar in the Pediatric department, there is no record of poisoning with <b>Atropa</b> <b>belladonna.</b> To our knowledge this is the first report of intentional consumption of belladonna berries to achieve the hallucinogenic effect.
