50|$|Vatutin {{was born}} in Chepuhino village in Voronezh Governorate (now Vatutino in Belgorod Oblast), into a peasant family of Russian ethnicity. Commissioned in 1920 to the Red Army, he fought against the Ukrainian peasant partisans of Nestor Makhno. The {{following}} year, he {{became a member of}} the Communist party, and served diligently in junior command positions. Starting in 1926, he spent the next decade <b>alternating</b> <b>service</b> with studies in the elite Frunze Military Academy and the General Staff Academy. The 1937-1938 purge of Red Army commanders opened the road to promotion - in 1938, he received the rank of Komdiv, and was appointed Chief of Staff of the important Kiev Special Military District. Throughout this period, Vatutin combined military service with intensive Party activities.|$|E

50|$|In long-distance {{passenger}} traffic, the Thuringian Railway {{represents an}} important part of the Frankfurt-Berlin and the Frankfurt-Dresden corridors. Even during the division of Germany until 1989, transit trains ran between Frankfurt and Berlin and express trains ran between Frankfurt and Dresden, Leipzig, Cottbus or Chemnitz. Since the end of Communism, the main line has been served by Intercity services. The former line 9 operated at two-hour intervals from Saarbrücken via Frankfurt and continuing to Erfurt, Leipzig and Dresden. The EuroCity train pair Goethe, which ran from Paris to Prague, also ran over the Thuringian Railway. These trains stopped only in Eisenach, Erfurt and Weimar on the Thuringian Railway. In addition to the IC services, two InterRegio services were added In 1993. The first line (36) ran from Frankfurt via Erfurt and Halle to Berlin, with some services continuing to the Baltic coast. The second line (20) ran from Aachen via Paderborn, Kassel and Erfurt, continuing to Gera and Chemnitz. The electric locomotives of these trains were substituted with diesel locomotives in Weimar, since the following line, the Weimar-Gera railway was not electrified. Both InterRegio lines served in addition to the stops of the Intercity services, the stations in Bebra, Gotha, Naumburg and Weißenfels. With the upgrade of the main line for the use of tilting trains, the IC 9 service was converted in the summer of 2000 to operation by ICE T as the new ICE 50 (Wiesbaden/Saarbrücken-Frankfurt-Erfurt-Leipzig-Dresden) service. The journey times were shortened by about 20 minutes and for the first time large parts of the main line could be operated at a top speed of 160 km/h. The InterRegio traffic on the Bebra-Halle railway ended in 2002. IR 36 service was replaced by IC 15 and IR 20 was replaced by the new IC 51 service, with services now beginning and ending in Weimar. In 2004, IC 15 service was converted to ICE-T operation and integrated into line 50, which now ran hourly between Frankfurt (Main) and Dresden. The IC 51 service, which previously ended in Weimar, was extended to Berlin and Stralsund. In 2008, due to a problem with axles, the tilt technology of the ICE-T sets had be taken out of service. The timetable was revised in order to be able to better absorb the resulting extensions of travel time. From 2010 to 2015, a mixed cycle of Intercity and ICE services operated on the Thuringian Railway, each with the number 50. The running distances and the train types of the services were changed several times during this period. Basically, the timetable was provided a service every two hours, with all trains stopping in Eisenach, Gotha, Erfurt, Weimar and Naumburg, while an <b>alternating</b> <b>service</b> also ran every two hours but only stopped in Eisenach and Erfurt and as a result achieved the approximately 15 minute shorter running times of the tilting-train period. Services on line 15 between Frankfurt and Berlin and line 50 between Frankfurt and Dresden are again operated exclusively with ICEs and have used the newly-opened Erfurt-Leipzig/Halle high-speed railway from Erfurt since December 2015. The trains of line 15 stop on the Thuringian Railway only in Erfurt. In addition, three IC train pairs of the former IC line 51 remain, which, coming from Kassel, stop in Bebra, Eisenach, Gotha, Erfurt and Weimar. One train pair continues from Weimar via Großheringen on the Saal Railway to Jena-Göschwitz, another train runs from Weimar via Naumburg to Halle. These are operated with the new double sets. From 12 January to September 2016, ICE line 28 between Berlin and Munich was redirected over the Erfurt-Bebra section (using the Berlin Curve) due to a blockade on the direct route. In addition, several night trains run over the line to Basel and Prague.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{an extension of}} the standard G/G/ 1 queue, described by the equation WD={ 0, B-A+YW}, where P[Y= 1]=p and P[Y=- 1]= 1 -p. For p= 1 this model reduces to the classical Lindley equation for the waiting time in the G/G/ 1 queue, whereas for p= 0 it describes the waiting time of the server in an <b>alternating</b> <b>service</b> model. For all other values of p this model describes a FCFS queue in which the service times and interarrival times depend linearly and randomly on the waiting times. We derive the distribution of W when A is generally distributed and B follows a phase-type distribution, and when A is exponentially distributed and B deterministic.

40|$|We {{consider}} a system {{consisting of a}} server alternating between two service points. At both service points there is an infinite queue of customers that have to undergo a preparation phase before being served. We {{are interested in the}} waiting time of the server. The waiting time of the server satisfies an equation very similar to Lindley's equation for the waiting time in the GI/G/ 1 queue. We will analyse this Lindley-type equation under the assumptions that the preparation phase follows a phase-type distribution while the service times have a general distribution. If we relax the condition that the server alternates between the service points, then the model {{turns out to be the}} machine repair problem. Although the latter is a well-known problem, the distribution of the waiting time of the server has not been studied yet. We shall derive this distribution under the same setting and we shall compare the two models numerically. As expected, the waiting time of the server is on average smaller in the machine repair problem than in the <b>alternating</b> <b>service</b> system, but they are not stochastically ordered.

40|$|The {{build-up}} and {{redistribution of}} residual stresses obtained by stress coining of aluminium plates containing a hole {{have been studied}} experimentally and numerically. The foil strain gauge technique has been employed to measure strains at the bore of a hole {{during and after the}} coining process. The finite element method has been applied for the computations of displacements, strains and stresses. Both axi-symmetric and fully three-dimensional models were used in the finite element analyses. The coining process was found to create compressive residual hoop stresses at the bore of the hole with a magnitude primarily depending on the diameter of the mandrel used for the coining. Parameters of secondary importance were found to be the coining depth and the friction coefficient. Good agreement was obtained between the experimentally measured strains and the numerically calculated strains. A slight redistribution of the residual hoop stresses, leading to lower compressive values, at the bore of the hole was observed when the aluminium plates were subjected to a simulated <b>alternating</b> <b>service</b> load. The possible beneficial effect of coining on the fatigue life has been quantified by calculating the propagation of a quarter elliptical corner crack and a half elliptical central crack at the bore of a stress coined hole. Results for the crack growth obtained from the empirically based and frequently used Paris law were compared with results from a more complex relation which also models the observed crack growth near the threshold value. Pertinent stress intensity factors were derived by the use of the weight function technique. A significant reduction of the crack propagation rate was found for quarter elliptical corner cracks growing from a coined hole. The application of the coining technique is demonstrated on a typical ship structure. The finite element method was used to calculate the residual stresses at the corner of a longitudinal stiffener cut-out in a web-frame after fillet welding of the web-frame to the ship hull plating and after the coining process. It was found that the tensile residual welding stresses at the cut-out were reduced to almost zero by the coining process. Engineering estimations show that growth of edge cracks {{at the corner of the}} cut out will be reduced...|$|E

40|$|WS-BPEL {{is widely}} used {{nowadays}} for specifying and executing composite business processes within the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). During the execution however, of such business processes, a number of faults stemming from the nature of SOA (e. g. network or server failures) may occur. The WS-BPEL scenario designer must therefore use the provisions offered by WS-BPEL to catch these exceptions and resolve them, usually by invoking some equivalent web service {{that is expected to}} be reachable and available. System fault handler specification is though an additional task for the WS scenario designer, while the presence of such handlers within the scenario necessitates extra maintenance activities, as new <b>alternate</b> <b>services</b> emerge or some of the specified ones are withdrawn. In this paper, we propose a middleware-based framework for system exception resolution, which undertakes the tasks of failure interception, discovery of <b>alternate</b> <b>services</b> and their invocation. The process of selecting the <b>alternate</b> <b>services</b> to be invoked can be driven by process consumer-specified QoS policy, specifying lower and upper bounds for each QoS attribute as well as the importance of each QoS parameter. Moreover, the middleware arranges for bridging syntactic differences between the originally invoked services and functionally equivalent replacements to it, by employing XSLT-based transformations. The middleware is deployed and maintained independently of the WS-BPEL scenarios, removing thus the need for specifying and maintaining system fault handlers within the scenarios.
