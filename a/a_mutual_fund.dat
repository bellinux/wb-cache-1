Investment accounting, however, is a different system, unrelated to government and nonprofit fund accounting.|$|E

25|$|An ETF {{combines}} the valuation feature of <b>a</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>fund</b> or unit investment trust, {{which can be}} bought or sold {{at the end of}} each trading day for its net asset value, with the tradability feature of a closed-end fund, which trades throughout the trading day at prices that may be more or less than its net asset value. Closed-end funds are not considered to be ETFs, even though they are funds and are traded on an exchange. ETFs have been available in the US since 1993 and in Europe since 1999. ETFs traditionally have been index funds, but in 2008 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission began to authorize the creation of actively managed ETFs.|$|E
25|$|ETFs are {{structured}} for tax efficiency {{and can be}} more attractive than mutual funds. In the U.S., whenever <b>a</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>fund</b> realizes a capital gain that is not balanced by a realized loss, the mutual fund must distribute the capital gains to its shareholders. This can happen whenever the mutual fund sells portfolio securities, whether to reallocate its investments or to fund shareholder redemptions. These gains are taxable to all shareholders, even those who reinvest the gains distributions in more shares of the fund. In contrast, ETFs are not redeemed by holders (instead, holders simply sell their ETF shares on the stock market, as they would a stock, or effect a non-taxable redemption of a creation unit for portfolio securities), so that investors generally only realize capital gains when they sell their own shares or when the ETF trades to reflect changes in the underlying index.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} {{benefit of}} an ETF is the stock-like features offered. <b>A</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>fund</b> is bought or {{sold at the}} end of a day's trading, whereas ETFs can be traded whenever the market is open. Since ETFs trade on the market, investors can carry out the same types of trades that they can with a stock. For instance, investors can sell short, use a limit order, use a stop-loss order, buy on margin, and invest as much or as little money as they wish (there is no minimum investment requirement). Also, many ETFs have the capability for options (puts and calls) to be written against them. Covered call strategies allow investors and traders to potentially increase their returns on their ETF purchases by collecting premiums (the proceeds of a call sale or write) on calls written against them. Mutual funds do not offer those features.|$|E

Then, it has been investigated whether <b>mutual</b> <b>fund</b> managers have market timing ability. Turkish Institutional Investment Managers’ Association A and B Type Fund Indexes are firstly used as benchmark portfolios. The challenging question is whether Turkish <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> have performance persistency over the {{short and long term}} or not. This study uses both parametric and non-parametric techniques to examine performance persistence. The overall conclusion is that Type <b>A</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> managers do not have stock selection and market timing ability. However, Type B <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> managers do have stock selection ability. Type <b>A</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> show evidence of relative and absolute persistence in the short term while Type B <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> show significant results of relative and absolute persistence in both of the terms. Although there are various results in performance persistence of <b>mutual</b> <b>funds,</b> the repeat winner phenomenon is stronger over shorter periods of evaluation. Consequently, it seems that Turkish <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> have performance persistency at least for the short term...|$|R

2500|$|An {{example of}} illegal use of {{undisclosed}} soft dollars might be when <b>a</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>fund</b> manager pays commissions to a broker-dealer {{and in return}} the broker-dealer provides furniture for the fund adviser's use.

Such brokerage arrangements, where favors are traded in exchange for institutional clients' excess commissions have been criticized by securities regulators. Full-service brokerage bundled commission arrangements involving the exchange of brokerage firms' undisclosed proprietary services provided for institutional clients' brokerage commissions (paid in excess of a fully negotiated execution-only commission rate) can create conflicts of interest. The lack of transparency in these full-service brokerage arrangements may shield abuses from immediate detection.|$|E

Some of the investors blamed the organizers, including Corsi, for their investment in the former Communist country. [...] Two investors sued Corsi and his partners on the basis that the organizers had given their personal guarantee backing up the investment, and won judgments against them. They did not collect from Corsi because, as one investor claimed, the money [...] "had been moved into his wife's name... There was nothing to get out of him". The FBI found no basis for bringing criminal charges. Until his 2004 book, Corsi was a financial services marketing specialist.|$|E
2500|$|An {{example that}} has both hedge and {{speculative}} notions involves <b>a</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>fund</b> or separately managed account whose investment {{objective is to}} track {{the performance of a}} stock index such as the S 500 stock index. The Portfolio manager often [...] "equitizes" [...] cash inflows in an easy and cost effective manner by investing in (opening long) S 500 stock index futures. This gains the portfolio exposure to the index which is consistent with the fund or account investment objective without having to buy an appropriate proportion of each of the individual 500 stocks just yet. This also preserves balanced diversification, maintains a higher degree of the percent of assets invested in the market and helps reduce tracking error in the performance of the fund/account. When it is economically feasible (an efficient amount of shares of every individual position within the fund or account can be purchased), the portfolio manager can close the contract and make purchases of each individual stock.|$|E
