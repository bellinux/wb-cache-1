5|$|Other strong quakes {{occurred}} on January 26, 1700 (estimated at 9magnitude), December 14, 1872 (7.3 or 7.4), April 13, 1949 (7.1), and April 29, 1965 (6.5). The 1965 quake caused three deaths in Seattle directly {{and one more}} by heart failure. Although the Seattle Fault passes {{just south of the}} city center, neither it nor the Cascadia subduction zone has caused <b>an</b> <b>earthquake</b> since the city's founding. The Cascadia subduction zone poses the threat of <b>an</b> <b>earthquake</b> of magnitude 9.0 or greater, capable of seriously damaging the city and collapsing many buildings, especially in zones built on fill.|$|E
5|$|<b>An</b> <b>earthquake</b> at 8:32:17a.m. PDT (UTC−7) on Sunday, May 18, 1980, {{caused the}} entire {{weakened}} north face to slide away, creating the largest landslide ever recorded.

30|$|It is {{well known}} that a {{subduction}} zone is divided into several discrete segments marked by <b>a</b> megathrust <b>earthquake</b> rupture. While the segment boundary limits the rupture area of <b>an</b> individual <b>earthquake,</b> sometimes <b>a</b> great <b>earthquake</b> across <b>a</b> segment boundary occurs, causing strong shaking and devastating tsunamis, e.g., Nankai (Ando, 1975), Cascadia (Satake et al., 1996), Chile (Campos et al., 2002), Kuril (Sawai et al., 2004), Sumatra (Lay et al., 2005), and Japan Trench (Ide et al., 2011). However, except for recent earthquakes such as the 2004 Sumatra (M 9.2), whether or not <b>a</b> great <b>earthquake</b> occurred across <b>a</b> segment boundary may be controversial, because it often depends solely on historical documents.|$|R

Black warns Watts that the Group is dangerous; Watts neither confirms nor denies this, but predicts the arrival of <b>an</b> <b>earthquake,</b> urging Black that should this prediction come to pass, he should accept full membership of the Group. That night, Black answers a telephone call from Means, who tells him that the Group mean no harm.

Black moves through his home, noticing that his pet bird is dead in its cage, covered in blood.|$|E
