5|$|In 2006, Vargas Llosa wrote The Bad Girl (Travesuras de la niña mala), which {{journalist}} Kathryn Harrison argues is a rewrite (rather {{than simply}} <b>a</b> <b>recycling)</b> of Gustave Flaubert's Madame Bovary (1856). In Vargas Llosa's version, the plot relates the decades-long obsession of its narrator, a Peruvian expatriate in Paris, {{with a woman}} with whom he first fell in love when both were teenagers.|$|E
5|$|Consolidated Edison {{provides}} {{electric power}} {{and natural gas}} to the village, and the Briarcliff Manor Department of Public Works supplies water from the Catskill Aqueduct to the village's water system. The department also maintains the sewer system, village vehicles, roads, and grounds, operates <b>a</b> <b>recycling</b> center, and removes snow. In 2012 the village tied for fourth place (out of 48 Westchester municipalities) {{in the percentage of}} recycled waste (71percent, above the county average of 52percent). The department, primarily rooted in the 1941 sale of Walter Law's Briarcliff Table Water Company, began with a state-mandated street commissioner. The commissioner in 1914 was Arthur Brown; asked by village officials if he needed an automobile, Brown replied that he preferred a horse but would use an automobile if the village purchased it (it did not). The department has about thirty vehicles and employs twenty-nine people.|$|E
5|$|Consuming 75% of production, {{the primary}} use for {{strontium}} is in glass for colour television cathode ray tubes, where it prevents X-ray emission. This application for strontium is declining because CRTs are {{being replaced by}} other display methods. This decline has a significant influence on the mining and refining of strontium. All parts of the CRT must absorb X-rays. In the neck and the funnel of the tube, lead glass is used for this purpose, but this type of glass shows a browning effect due to {{the interaction of the}} X-rays with the glass. Therefore, the front panel is made from a different glass mixture with strontium and barium to absorb the X-rays. The average values for the glass mixture determined for <b>a</b> <b>recycling</b> study in 2005 is 8.5% strontium oxide and 10% barium oxide.|$|E

5|$|On 12 November 1940 Colchester {{was bombed}} by German air raids, causing {{damage in the}} {{vicinity}} of Ipswich Road. In the early hours of 30 April 1944, a crew of seven on board a Lancaster UM-K2 were returning from a bombing raid on Karlsruhe, Germany, when the engines caught fire, causing a fatal crash landing at what is now Space Makers Safestore on Ipswich Road. In 2015, a memorial service was held {{at the site of the}} crash. In December 2014, 24 World War II bombs weighing approximately 600 lbs in total were discovered at <b>a</b> <b>recycling</b> centre on the road.|$|E
5|$|Scully theorizes that Gates {{has brought}} Kevin to <b>a</b> <b>recycling</b> plant he owns in Jerusalem, Ohio. Mulder {{thinks that he}} has headed to the airport, as a man {{matching}} Gates' description was reported headed there. Mulder thinks Scully believes that she's been chosen to protect Kevin. Scully arrives at the recycling plant where Gates tells Kevin that he must die for the 'New Age' to come. Gates attempts to jump into a paper shredding machine with Kevin, but Kevin grabs onto the side as Gates falls into the shredder. Scully is able to pull Kevin to safety. Two days later, Scully and Kevin say goodbye. Kevin tells Scully he'll see her again. Scully goes to the confessional {{for the first time}} in years, wondering if God is speaking, but that no one is listening.|$|E
5|$|In June 2007, {{they shot}} the bridge battle near Bovec in the Soča Valley, Slovenia. The {{location}} {{was chosen for}} its resemblance to New Zealand. A large bridge was built, which was modelled on the one Julius Caesar built to cross the Rhine. Whereas Caesar supposedly built his bridge in ten days, the filmmakers had around forty. The schedule was short though, but the authorities would only allow them this build time to not completely disrupt normal summer activities on the lake. The filmmakers made a trench to change the river's course, so they could deepen the drained sides of the riverbed so it looked like one could drown in it. The crew also cut down 100 trees for shots of the Telmarines building the bridge; the trees were moved to another {{side of the river}} for decoration. The bridge stood for two months before being dismantled. As part of the clean-up, the cut-down trees and parts of the bridge were sent to <b>a</b> <b>recycling</b> plant, while other portions of the bridge were sent to the studio for close-ups shot against bluescreen.|$|E
