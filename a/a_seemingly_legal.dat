50|$|As to the Meaning of Words is a stage play {{written by}} Mark Eichman, a {{slightly}} fictionalized {{account of a}} 1975 court {{case in which a}} physician who had performed <b>a</b> <b>seemingly</b> <b>legal</b> abortion was afterwards charged with manslaughter. The play premiered in New York in 1981, and while the names of the people involved had been changed, {{the facts of the case}} very much remained intact in this courtroom drama.|$|E
40|$|This article pays {{tribute to}} {{the voices of the}} 1970 s who helped enunciate a vision of Environmental Law in New South Wales. These voices {{included}} an Australian High Court Justice, Prime Minister, Foundation Law Dean and Vice-President of the NSW Bar Association. The article, through its "Did we? Should we?" 2001 snapshots, underscores how we must continually strengthen action at appropriate institutional levels, with shared global insights, and shun complacent "been there, done that" and dismissive "that was then" attitudes insinuated by <b>a</b> <b>seemingly</b> mature <b>legal</b> system. 18 page(s...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{in-depth}} analysis of <b>a</b> <b>seemingly</b> uncomplicated <b>legal</b> relationship. The relationship between two very significant acts - the Obligatory Relations Act and the Maritime Code, {{out of which}} the Obligatory Relations Act certainly falls {{under the category of}} general and the Maritime Code of special acts. The complexity {{stems from the fact that}} the Maritime Code although, in essence, determined by international agreements, is likewise relevant for establishing whether a provision of the Obligatory Relations Act, although unregulated either by the Maritime Code or binding international agreements, is acceptable for application in maritime contracts. In other words, it is a matter of the application of a provision of the Obligatory Relations Act to maritime contracts “in an appropriate manner”...|$|R
50|$|Sarmiento {{successfully}} vied for the mayorship of San Jose del Monte in 2004 {{but lost}} his re-election bid to then Representative and former two-term Municipal Mayor {{and the first}} City Mayor Eduardo V. Roquero (who ran under the Kampi banner) in 2007, amid allegations of cheating and bomb threats. In 2009, after <b>a</b> <b>seemingly</b> lengthy <b>legal</b> battle on the resolution of his election protest which affected even {{the residents of the}} city (the Comelec earlier ruled that Sarmiento is the duly-elected mayor, thus nullifying Roquero's election), he returned to his mayoralty seat after the Supreme Court dismissed the petition of Acting Mayor Reynaldo S. San Pedro to stop Sarmiento from assuming the seat. San Pedro became the Acting Mayor of the city when Mayor Eduardo V. Roquero died on August 24, 2009.|$|R
25|$|Subsequent to {{this the}} ICC {{received}} data from laboratory based analyses, {{on the basis that}} these measurement environments are more controlled, involving more sophisticated measurement technologies such as the Vicon Motion Analysis system. These were subject to less measurement error. Data was provided by the Australian Institute of Sport, the University of Western Australia and the Motion Analysis Corporation system from the University of Auckland. The ICC also carried out further video based three-dimensional analyses on all bowlers during the 2004 Champions Trophy in England. Regardless of the biomechanical measurement protocol used, a strikingly similar pattern emerged: the normal biomechanics of cricket bowling, whether it be spin or pace, features an element of elbow extension. The average extension of <b>a</b> normal, <b>seemingly</b> <b>legal</b> delivery was 8-10 degrees for all bowler types. There were virtually zero instances of no elbow extension at all in accordance with the original laws.|$|R
40|$|It {{could be}} argued that since the dawn of the peace-building era in the early 1990 s, public {{participation}} in constitution-making processes has developed into a transnational legal norm. International organizations, NGOs, CSOs, scholars and think tanks around the globe repeatedly stress the value of including ordinary citizens in the making of their founding laws. As a consequence, the practice of participatory constitution-making has also increased. Though this is <b>a</b> <b>seemingly</b> established transnational <b>legal</b> norm, it is still a norm that has been more or less successfully adopted in different contexts. This article takes an interest in exploring why this is so. How is it that this norm is institutionalized in some contexts, internalized in others, institutionalized and internalized in yet other contexts, and simply rejected in still other contexts...|$|R
40|$|The GNU General Public Licence (GPL) {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used {{licences}} in the field of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). Principally a legal document drafted to facilitate the development, use and transfer of software, the licence also embodies a strong ideological character that seeks to challenge the paradigmatic representation of software as property. At its core, the GPL places great emphasis on the licensee’s freedom to view, use, modify and distribute a covered work. However, for all its claims to openness and freedom, the GPL functions by way of restrictions. These restrictions are primarily designed to prohibit privatisation of the work by downstream licensees, but they also restrict other forms of conduct deemed contrary to the established practices of FOSS development. This paper asks <b>a</b> <b>seemingly</b> simple <b>legal</b> question, yet it is one that is deeply entangled in the ideological and strategic complexities of a field that has received little in the way of judicial clarification. The question is whether the GPL’s restrictive provisions are contractual in nature or merely property-based restrictions that act unilaterally to define the scope of the granted rights. Focusing almost exclusively on Anglo-American jurisprudence, this paper will consider a variety of licensing issues relating to formalities, the nature and scope of rights, and remedies in order to determine on which side of the property/contract divide the GPL's restrictive provisions reside, or perhaps should reside. This thesis is not currently available in ORA...|$|R

40|$|Climate {{change may}} soon have its “lawmaking moment” in the United States. The {{inherent}} problem with such lawmaking moments, however, is just that: they are moments. What Congress and the President do with much fanfare can quickly and quietly slip {{away in the}} ensuing years. This is famously so for environmental law. Subsequent legislative amendments, limited budgets, appropriations riders, interpretive agency rulings, massive delays in rulemaking, and simple nonenforcement are more than capable of converting <b>a</b> <b>seemingly</b> uncompromising <b>legal</b> mandate into {{nothing more than a}} symbolic aspirational statement. Climate change legislation is especially vulnerable to being unraveled over time for a variety of reasons, but especially because {{of the extent to which}} it imposes costs on the short term for the realization of benefits many decades and sometimes centuries later. To be successful over the long term, climate change legislation will need to include institutional design features that insulate programmatic implementation to a significant extent from powerful political and economic interests propelled by short-term concerns. Such design features should include a variety of asymmetric precommitment strategies, which deliberately make it hard (never impossible) to change the law in response to some kinds of concerns while simultaneously providing avenues for change in response to other longer term concerns that are in harmony with the law’s central purpose—to achieve and maintain greenhouse gas emissions reductions over time. The traditional objection to lawmaking precommitment strategies—that the present should not be allowed to bind future lawmakers—also has little force in the climate change context, where the purpose of such strategies is not to protect the present at the expense of the future, but the precise opposite: to protect the future at the expense of the present...|$|R

A free vote, however, was not what others were planning. British agents had fanned out across the country, bribing candidates, and the regional bosses who controlled them.
