5|$|The {{fan base}} went wild, and a riotous celebration {{gathered}} at Ebisu Bridge in Dōtonbori, Osaka. There, {{an assemblage of}} supporters yelled the players' names, and with every name, a fan resembling {{a member of the}} victorious team leaped from the bridge into the waiting canal. However, lacking a Caucasian person to imitate MVP Randy Bass, the rabid crowd seized a plastic statue of Colonel Sanders (like Bass, the Colonel had a beard and was not Japanese) from a nearby KFC <b>and</b> <b>tossed</b> <b>it</b> off the bridge as an effigy.|$|E
5|$|The First Test at Brisbane was {{dominated}} by Australia, a pattern {{that was to be}} a feature of the series, although Barnes contributed only 31 to the total of 645 which brought an innings victory. Barnes displayed his liking for slightly aggressive practical jokes in this match: during a break for a particularly ferocious thunderstorm, he got a huge block of ice out of the tub in which our drinks were kept, staggered {{to the side of the}} dressing-room <b>and</b> <b>tossed</b> <b>it</b> on to the roof over the English dressing-room. It caused a noise for a start that brought all the Englishmen running and then it came over the side of the gutter, crashed on to the lawn and slithered down the grass. Those English eyes certainly did stand out.|$|E
25|$|An old Irish story {{tells how}} Lough Neagh was formed when Ireland's legendary giant Fionn mac Cumhaill (commonly anglicised to Finn McCool) ripped up {{a portion of}} the land <b>and</b> <b>tossed</b> <b>it</b> at a Scottish rival. He missed, and the chunk of earth landed in the Irish Sea, thus {{creating}} the island.|$|E

25|$|Nerman {{graduated}} from Norrköping gymnasium (secondary school) in 1903 {{at the age}} of 17. On his graduation day he took his school bible <b>and</b> <b>tossed</b> <b>it</b> in the Motala ström river. In his autobiography, Nerman describes this as his first revolutionary action. Some years later when he was asked by the Swedish Social Democratic Party's leader Hjalmar Branting what had made him a socialist, Nerman answered that it had been the questioning of religion.|$|E
25|$|Charles II {{tried to}} impose a charter on Newcastle to give the king the right to appoint the mayor, sheriff, {{recorder}} and town clerk. Charles died before the charter came into effect. In 1685, James II tried to replace Corporation members with named Catholics. However, James' mandate was suspended in 1689 after the Glorious Revolution welcoming William of Orange. In 1689, {{after the fall of}} James II, the people of Newcastle tore down his bronze equestrian statue in Sandhill <b>and</b> <b>tossed</b> <b>it</b> into the Tyne. The bronze was later used to make bells for All Saints Church.|$|E
25|$|Seán O'Casey's 1926 play The Plough and the Stars {{attracted}} controversy for its critical {{view of the}} Easter Rising, {{in particular}} {{a scene in which}} a tricolour is brought into a pub frequented by a prostitute. On 7 May 1945, the day before V-E Day, celebrating unionist students in Trinity College Dublin raised the flags of the victorious Allies over the college; when onlookers in College Green began jeering, some took down the flag of neutral Ireland, set fire to it <b>and</b> <b>tossed</b> <b>it</b> away, provoking a small riot. In response, nationalist students from University College Dublin, including future Taoiseach Charles Haughey, burned the British flag in Grafton Street. The Provost of Trinity College apologised for the incident, which was not reported in Irish newspapers owing to wartime censorship.|$|E
50|$|Joan abuses Doreen {{after finding}} {{out she was}} pregnant. Joan then tries to get Doreen to blame Will on being the father. When Doreen refuses, Ferguson murders Doreen’s pet bird <b>and</b> <b>tosses</b> <b>it</b> into her cell.|$|R

60|$|LADY. Yes; but {{you know}} you have THE letter in your pocket. (He smiles; takes a letter from his pocket; <b>and</b> <b>tosses</b> <b>it</b> {{on the top of the}} heap. She holds it up and looks at him, saying) About Caesar's wife.|$|R
25|$|Singles {{were taken}} to end the over, but McGrath was to bowl the last over of the game, with England still needing ten to win. Things got easier for England when McGrath overstepped with the first ball of the over, Gough making contact and running the single to cut the target by two – the no-ball for {{overstepping}} and the run single – and the no-ball meant McGrath still had to bowl six balls in the over. Giles then played and missed, before hitting a single, and then Gough drove the two next balls to cover for two. Suddenly, England only needed three off two – and were, incredibly, in a winning position again. But Gough's next shot was right back to McGrath, who took it up well <b>and</b> <b>tossed</b> <b>it</b> at the stumps, running out Gough and meaning that McGrath would bowl to Ashley Giles – and England still required three to win. The ball hit Giles' pads, ran away down the off side, and Giles and Harmison ran all they could to scamper two leg byes – and tie the game.|$|E
25|$|One {{day during}} our lunch {{hour in the}} last week of filming, the craft service man handed out slices of {{watermelon}} to each of us. Richard, the whole camera crew, and I sat together in a big sound studio eating a number of watermelon slices, talking and joking. As a gag, some members of the crew used a piece of watermelon as a Frisbee, <b>and</b> <b>tossed</b> <b>it</b> back and forth to each other. One piece of watermelon landed at Richard's feet. He got up and went home. Filming stopped. The next day, Richard announced that he knew very well what the significance of watermelon was. He said that he was quitting show business and would not return to this film. The day after that, Richard walked in, all smiles. I wasn't privy to all the negotiations that went on between Columbia and Richard's lawyers, but the camera operator who had thrown that errant piece of watermelon had been fired that day. I assume now that Richard was using drugs during Stir Crazy.|$|E
500|$|On 15 September 1935, {{one year}} after the death of Reich President Paul von Hindenburg and Hitler's {{elevation}} to the position of Führer, the dual flag arrangement was ended, with the exclusive use of the Nazi flag as the national flag of Germany. One reason may have been the [...] "Bremen incident" [...] of 26 July 1935, in which a group of demonstrators in New York City boarded the ocean liner SS Bremen, tore the Nazi Party flag from the jackstaff, <b>and</b> <b>tossed</b> <b>it</b> into the Hudson River. When the German ambassador protested, US officials responded that the German national flag had not been harmed, only a political party symbol. The new flag law was announced at the annual party rally in Nuremberg, where Hermann Göring claimed the old black-white-red flag, while honoured, was the symbol of a bygone era and under threat of being used by [...] "reactionaries".|$|E
5000|$|In [...] "Saturday Night Shaun" [...] Shaun rips off {{his coat}} <b>and</b> <b>tosses</b> <b>it</b> away as he is dancing, only to have <b>it</b> <b>tossed</b> back. This is {{reminiscent}} of the scene in the 1980 movie Airplane!, where Robert Hays tosses his white sport-coat away, only to have <b>it</b> <b>tossed</b> back in his face.|$|R
25|$|Tāfau - Usually {{stationed}} {{behind the}} 'ava mixer, ready {{to catch the}} fau strainer tossed behind over the right shoulder by the 'ava mixer. The tāfau shakes out the excess root fibre <b>and</b> <b>tosses</b> <b>it</b> back to the 'ava mixer's waiting hand over the right shoulder.|$|R

500|$|In the quarter-finals Lee {{defeated}} O'Sullivan 5–4 in a {{match that}} lasted 3 hours and 32 minutes. O'Sullivan came from 2–3 down to lead 4–3 before Lee leveled the match. In the final frame O'Sullivan led 36–0, before Lee made a 46 break and fluked a snooker that {{enabled him to}} claim victory. O'Sullivan said his performance was very poor, while Lee said he was quietly confident. White defeated Robertson 5–3 to reach his third semi-final of the season. White led 4–1 and was 56 points ahead in the sixth but missed a straightforward green, allowing Robertson to win on the black with a 67 break. Robertson took the next frame before a risky long pot in the eighth allowed White to win the match. White—who last won a ranking title 12 years ago prior at this event—said, [...] "Everyone knows I've been in front {{so many times in}} the past <b>and</b> <b>tossed</b> <b>it</b> away so I was having nightmares out there". Drago quickly won the first four frames of his match against Hann, conceding the fifth, before completing a 5–1 victory, after which he said the crowd support helped him. Maguire caused an upset when he beat Higgins 5–3, a match that saw Maguire lose the first two frames before winning the next four. After the match Maguire he said he had [...] "starting to think about winning it now".|$|E
2500|$|Lee Smart had {{tossed the}} {{gasoline}} as Jerry Myles lit {{a match to}} a torch he had constructed from a mop. [...] He thrust the mop at the guard, who froze in fear. [...] Smart and Alton lit a broom <b>and</b> <b>tossed</b> <b>it</b> onto the catwalk behind Byars, who, with his vision blurred by the gasoline, saw {{he was surrounded by}} fire. [...] He quickly surrendered his keys and rifle and allowed himself to be led to the hole.|$|E
2500|$|American {{troops had}} overrun two smaller targets, and {{spotters}} described them as [...] "surrounded by dead Germans". The strong currents off Normandy slowed the battleships behind minesweepers drifting off {{course in the}} current. Arkansas established radio contact with its shore fire control party, closed range to [...] and opened fire on Battery Hamburg with her antiquated fire control system. Texas could not connect with her shore party and so stayed {{in line with the}} minesweepers. Arkansass salvos did no damage, so as Group 2 steamed into the battery's arc of fire, the German guns were able to fire. The minesweepers were all bracketed. The destroyer Barton was holed with a ricochet dud from another battery that landed in her aft diesel room. She returned fire on the disclosed battery without air or shore spotting. All minesweepers were splashed with near misses. The destroyer Laffey took a dud in her port bow by the anchor. The damage control party pried it loose <b>and</b> <b>tossed</b> <b>it</b> overboard.|$|E

2500|$|They murdered Mrs Rival {{before she}} could tell the police who hired her. Mr Bland and his {{sister-in-law}} thought their plan would baffle the police, while Mrs Bland felt she was a pawn in their schemes. Mr Bland took care to dispose of Duguesclin's passport {{on a trip to}} Boulogne, which trip he mentioned to Colin in casual conversation. Poirot holds that people reveal much in simple conversation. Poirot had assumed this trip took place, so the man's passport would be found in a country different from where he was murdered, and long after friends and family in Canada had missed him on his holiday in Europe. The missing clock, with Rosemary written on it, was traced. Colin realised that Sheila had taken it <b>and</b> <b>tossed</b> <b>it</b> in the neighbour's dustbin, seeing it was her very own clock, mislaid {{on the way to a}} repair shop. But the clock was taken by Miss Martindale, not mislaid by Sheila.|$|E

50|$|Battles were fought by {{randomly}} {{selecting a}} figure <b>and</b> <b>tossing</b> <b>it</b> into battle. As {{in the game}} Rock, Paper, Scissors, one alien figure would always beat (and be beaten by) another alien figure. If the 2 figures were of the same race, the victor {{was the one with}} the highest point value printed on the bottom of their foot.|$|R
50|$|As of 2005, he {{headlines}} at the Luxor Hotel in Las Vegas and performs various comedy engagements {{when his}} show is not playing. His comedy routine incorporates dozens of props stored in large trunks on stage; his prop jokes commonly consist simply of his {{pulling out a}} prop, describing it in a one-liner, <b>and</b> <b>tossing</b> <b>it</b> away.|$|R
5000|$|Gadget {{accepts the}} mission, usually with the exclamation [...] "You {{can count on}} me/Don't worry, Chief, I'm always on duty!" [...] He then crumples the message up <b>and</b> <b>tosses</b> <b>it</b> back toward Quimby, {{apparently}} forgetting the self-destruct warning. The message blows up in Quimby's face, after which he usually asks himself, [...] "Why do I put up with him?" ...|$|R

50|$|Broadway runs off, but vows to get revenge and, {{after an}} {{attempted}} robbery {{later in the}} day where he shoots and kills a woman at a drive-through, he wipes off his gun <b>and</b> <b>tosses</b> <b>it</b> into the backseat of Cashmere's open convertible when he is out of the car, which looks similar enough to Broadway's car to be mistaken for it.|$|R

This causes a brief argument between Elaine, Mr. Lippman, & Testikov.
