The private sector was to invest {{money in the}} project, help design and build the network, and be given the franchise to operate the trains (known as design-build-maintain-operate, or DBOM). Trains would be privately owned, similar to how the airline industry operates in a publicly financed airport.|$|E

25|$|Italian {{designer}} Michelotti—who {{had already}} penned the Herald—was commissioned {{for the new}} project, <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> traditional, swooping body. Wind-up windows were provided (in contrast to the Sprite/Midget, which still featured side screens, also called curtains, at that time), {{as well as a}} single-piece front end which tilted forwards to offer unrivalled access to the engine. At the dawn of the 1960s, however, Standard-Triumph was in deep financial trouble, and unable to put the new car into production; {{it was not until the}} company was taken over by the Leyland organization that funds became available and the car was launched. Leyland officials, taking stock of their new acquisition, found Michelotti's prototype hiding under a dust sheet in a corner of the factory and rapidly approved it for production.|$|E
25|$|However, the War Office {{judged the}} Tett turret {{to be too}} cramped and not {{bulletproof}} against heavy fire, its isolated nature did not allow adequate command and control and the open top was vulnerable to a well-thrown grenade. The most striking feature was {{that the only way}} in and out was through the top – {{there was no way to}} escape without being exposed to enemy fire – it was to be a fight to the death. Burbridge went back to the drawing board <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> new version that instead of being positioned over a pipe was placed on a concrete slab over an underground chamber of brick or concrete slabs. This allowed access from a tunnel or slit trench to the rear. The company's brochure shows a wooden seat suspended from the turret by a metal frame.|$|E
25|$|The {{son of a}} watchmaker, Spark had a {{literary}} education {{in his hometown of}} Elgin, learnt to speak and studied French, and acquired an interest in astronomy. In the June 1811, after he had had some experience in business, Spark went to London, where he became the founder of a small literary society. Despite himself, Spark found living on £50 a great difficulty, and opted to contact his parents for financial support. His father, at first reluctant to offer his son any sum of money to help him to deal with his sinking financial situation, gave him the money he requested only after Alexander had found a supply of low-priced watches <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> design for what Spark called a 'Patent Warning Clock', and not before lecturing Alexander about over-spending and the poor grammar and writing in the letter which Alexander had sent to his father asking for money.|$|E

25|$|The {{healthcare}} reform {{debate in the}} United States has been a political issue focusing upon increasing medical coverage, decreasing costs, insurance reform, and the philosophy of its provision, funding, and government involvement. Following the election of Barack Obama as president, who campaigned heavily on accomplishing health care reform, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) was enacted in March 2010. However, {{in the next election}} of Donald Trump as president, he campaigned to repeal and replace Obamacare <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> seven-point plan for {{healthcare reform}}. With this seven point plan President Trump discussed that the healthcare system would work based on free market principles. According to Ballotpedia, he stated that he would repeal Obamacare, reduce barriers to the interstate sale of health insurance, institute a full tax deduction for insurance premium payments for individuals, make Health Saving Accounts inheritable, require price transparency, block-grant Medicaid to the states, and allow for more overseas drug providers through lowered regulatory barriers. Trump added that enforcing immigration laws could reduce healthcare costs. However, this seven point plan has not taken the place of Obamacare, and it is possible that Obamacare will not be repealed but instead it will be modified so that all parts of this plan work accordingly.|$|E
25|$|In the US, {{the long}} curing time {{of at least}} a month for Rosendale cement made it unpopular after World War One in the {{construction}} of highways and bridges and many states and construction firms turned to the use of Portland cement. Because of the switch to Portland cement, {{by the end of the}} 1920s of the 15 Rosendale cement companies, only one had survived. But in the early 1930s it was discovered that, while Portland cement had a faster setting time it was not as durable, especially for highways, to the point that some states stopped building highways and roads with cement. Bertrain H. Wait, an engineer whose company had worked on the construction of the New York City's Catskill Aqueduct, was impressed with the durability of Rosendale cement, <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> blend of both Rosendale and synthetic cements which had the good attributes of both: it was highly durable and had a much faster setting time. Mr. Wait convinced the New York Commissioner of Highways to construct an experimental section of highway near New Paltz, New York, using one sack of Rosendale to six sacks of synthetic cement. It was proved a success and for decades the Rosendale-synthetic cement blend became common use in highway and bridge construction.|$|E
25|$|On 13 January 2016, 56 deputies of the {{parliamentary}} coalition formed around PD proposed controversial businessman Vlad Plahotniuc {{for the position}} of prime minister. The proposal was immediately rejected by President Nicolae Timofti, invoking integrity reasons. Timofti asked coalition representatives to propose another name until 14 January at 12 a.m. In the evening of 13 January, the coalition announced that will propose again Plahotniuc, thus escalating the constitutional conflict. The same day, two rallies took place in Chișinău, one that supports Vlad Plahotniuc for the position of prime minister and another that opposes the nomination. Next day, protests continued, {{with tens of thousands}} of people demonstrating in central Chișinău against Plahotniuc. By night, Timofti nominated the Secretary General of the Presidency, Ion Păduraru, candidate for this position, defying PD's proposal. However, Ion Păduraru announced his withdrawal from the race in less than 24 hours after the announcement of his nomination. He justified his gesture by the fact that {{the parliamentary}} majority has already nominated another proposal of premier, and President Timofti will consider it as a compromise solution. On 16 January, the parliamentary coalition grouped around the Democratic Party of Vlad Plahotniuc announced that disagrees with the proposal of President Timofti <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> new proposal for premier, instead of Plahotniuc – Pavel Filip. Later that day, up to 20,000 people joined three different rallies that were organized by both the left Socialist Party of Moldova and the centre-right Civic Platform DA. The protesters called on the Moldovan president and chief prosecutor to resign, demanding early elections and prompt measures against corruption. They also opposed the nomination of Pavel Filip to the post of Prime Minister.|$|E

500|$|Going {{into the}} fifth season of The X-Files, series creator Chris Carter noted, [...] "we {{knew we were}} going to be hitting these very {{dramatic}} marks which were the mythology episodes, and we wanted to lighten, or leaven, the season with quirky episodes." [...] Carter wanted to write a Frankenstein-inspired episode, but found it difficult to reconcile Mary Shelley's unbelievable tale with the style of the show. To achieve his vision, he wrote a script that blurred the real world with the X-Files reality and that had a distinct fantasy element. Carter combined elements of the original story with fairy tales and elements of folk tales. In order to make the episode [...] "as moving" [...] as possible, Carter sought to echo elements of James Whale's 1931 film version of Frankenstein. He later noted that, by [...] "using modern science, I took an old style, which is black and white, and an old approach, which is a kind of James Whale approach to science fiction, <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> story about a love-lorn monster".|$|E

Life in Hell {{caught the attention of}} James L. Brooks. In 1985, Brooks contacted Groening with the proposition of working in animation for the Fox variety show The Tracey Ullman Show. Originally, Brooks wanted Groening to adapt his Life in Hell characters for the show. Fearing the loss of ownership rights, Groening decided to create something new <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> cartoon family, the Simpson family, and named the members after his own parents and sisters—while Bart was an anagram of the word brat. The shorts would be spun off into their own series The Simpsons, which has since aired [...] In 1997, Groening and former Simpsons writer David X. Cohen developed Futurama, an animated series about life in the year 3000, which premiered in 1999, running for four years on Fox, then picked up by Comedy Central for additional seasons. Groening is currently developing a new series for Netflix titled Disenchantment, which is set to premiere in 2018.|$|E
500|$|Unlike the {{stop-start}} {{sessions for}} The Uplift Mofo Party Plan, where Kiedis would frequently disappear to seek drugs, pre-production for Mother's Milk went smoothly. Many {{of the songs}} were already written, some even recorded ("Taste the Pain" [...] was recorded prior to Chad joining and featured Philip [...] "Fish" [...] Fisher on drums) {{by the time the}} band started pre-production in January 1989. [...] The band recorded basic tracks at Hully Gully studios in Silver Lake; songs like [...] "Knock Me Down" [...] were formed from jam sessions without any input from returning producer Michael Beinhorn. According to Flea, the Hully Gully sessions bore fruit: [...] "We played hard and fast more than [...] any other time in our career, I think.

[...] Kiedis and Flea recognized that Frusciante's presence had become a significant influence on the band's new material as the Hully Gully sessions were proving to be extremely productive; Flea recalled that [...] " [...] was an immense new element to the sound of our band and a big opening up for us." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{designing}} for Treasure Planet, {{the crew}} operated on rule {{they call the}} [...] "70/30 Law" [...] (an idea that art director Andy Gaskill has credited to Ron Clements), which meant that the overall look of the film's artwork should be 70% traditional and 30% sci-fi. The overall look of Treasure Planet {{was based on the}} art style promoted by illustrators associated with the Brandywine School of Illustration (such as Howard Pyle and N.C. Wyeth), whose illustrations have been described by the film's crew as being the [...] "classic storybook illustration," [...] having a painterly feel to it, and being composed of a warm color palette. The animators took Deep Canvas, a technology which they had initially developed for Tarzan (1999), <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> process they called [...] "Virtual Sets," [...] wherein they created entire 360 degree sets before they began staging the scenes. They combined this process with traditionally-drawn characters in order to achieve a [...] "painted image with depth perception" [...] and enabled the crew to place the camera anywhere in the set and maneuver it as they would maneuver a camera for a live-action film. In order to test how a computer-generated body part (specifically John Silver's cyborg arm) would mesh with a traditionally animated character, the crew took a clip of Captain Hook from Peter Pan and replaced his arm with the cyborg arm.|$|E
