Edward was grief-stricken. [...] "To lose our eldest son", he wrote, [...] "is one of those calamities one can never really get over". Edward told Queen Victoria, [...] " [...] have given my life for him, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> no value on mine". Albert Victor was the second of Edward's {{children}} to die. In 1871, his youngest son, Alexander John, had died just 24 hours after being born. Edward had insisted on placing Alexander John in a coffin personally with [...] "the tears rolling down his cheeks".|$|E

He used these words to {{describe}} his years of instruction: [...] " [...] The maister of the scholl, was a lerned, honest, kynd man, whom also for thankfulness I name, Mr. Andro Miln. I never got a stroke of his hand; howbeit, I committed twa stupid faults, as it were with fire and sword :â€”Having the candle in my hand, on a winter night, before six o'clock, in the school, sitting in the class, bairnly and negligently playing with the bent, with which the floor was strewed, it kindled, so that we had much ado to put it out with our feet. The other was being molested by a condisciple, who cut the strings of my pen and ink-horn with his pen-knife I aiming with my pen-knife to his legs to fley him he feared, and lifting now a leg and now the other, rushed on his leg upon my knife, and struck himself a deep wound in the shin of the leg, which waa a quarter of a year in curing. In the time of the trying of the matter, he saw me so humble, so feared, so grieved, yield so many tears, and by fasting and mourning at the school all day, that he said he could not find in his heart to punish me farther. But my righteous God let me not slip that fault, but gave me a warning, and remembrance what it was to be denied with blood, although negligently; for within a short space, after I had caused a cutler, newly come to the town, to polish and sharp the same pen-knife, and had bought a pennyworth of apples, and cutting and eating the same in the links, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> the slice in my mouth, I began to lope up upon a little sand brae, having the pen.knife in my right hand, I fell, and struck myself, missing my belly, an inch deep in the inward side of the left knee, even to the bean, whereby the equity of God's judgment, and my conscience struck me so, that I was the more wary of knives all my days." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, now, who's {{going to}} convict them? I can't do it. I'm {{going to pull}} out <b>as</b> soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can <b>put</b> my books in shape, and you'd better go too." ...|$|R
60|$|I believe I was {{extremely}} offensive <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> the question, but the lawyer paid no heed.|$|E
60|$|<b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> my hand {{upon the}} door-knob, I heard steps upon the stairs, {{and looking up}} saw Duncan Woodward descending.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Hark to me, Nyleptha,' I said, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> {{down the}} empty tankard. 'Hast thou here among these thy waiting-ladies any two of discretion?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why {{of course}} it can," [...] <b>I</b> agreed, with <b>as</b> much relief in my tone <b>as</b> <b>I</b> could <b>put</b> into it. After all, what simpler way of moving the Ballplatz than that? ...|$|R
60|$|After parting from him, {{it being}} three o'clock or thereabouts, I resumed my wanderings about the city, of which <b>I</b> never weary <b>as</b> long <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can <b>put</b> one foot before the other.|$|R

6000|$|... "Catch another horse--there {{are plenty}} {{good enough for}} a light weight like you, Salamander," [...] said I, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> my horse to its utmost speed.|$|E
6000|$|<b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> {{a pencil}} under the hand, it was seized {{in a very}} {{singular}} way, and almost instantly Mrs. Cameron gasped, [...] "That's very strange!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{not what}} I asked you," [...] shouted the consul, growing brave quite fast; [...] "answer my {{questions}} <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> them, or I'll {{find a way}} to make you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Put {{away your}} heart-ache, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> will <b>put</b> away mine; for you wounded me a little, Lucy. Now, when {{the pain is}} gone, I more than forgive: <b>I</b> feel grateful, <b>as</b> to a sincere well-wisher." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "'There,' I said, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> the parings {{into her}} hand. 'Just {{to show you}} what I think of it. There's bait and to spare. Go on and anaana me if you can.' ...|$|E
60|$|Indeed, I was {{beginning}} to think I would better leave, though where I should go was more than I could say. With a quick intuition she caught my hand <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> foot in the stirrup.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Mr. Wilkinson {{is in your}} watch, and <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> you in {{his charge}} to start with, I will tell him to act as your {{instructor}} in these matters. Please ask him to step here.|$|E

6000|$|... "There, miss," [...] he said, {{as he led}} the {{way down}} into the cabin; [...] "there is not a barge afloat with such a {{comfortable}} cabin <b>as</b> this. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> up two or three more cupboards, for as they will sleep in the next room there is plenty of space for them." ...|$|R

60|$|Tom {{had often}} seen this light before, no doubt, {{but he had}} never given himself the trouble {{to find out what it}} could be. Fortunately the captain came up just <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> the question, and he enlightened me on the subject.|$|E
60|$|I {{turned and}} got my hat; Glendenning came in for his, but seemed unable to find it, though he stood before the table where it lay. I had to laugh, though I felt so little like it, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> it in his hand.|$|E
6000|$|On Zulime's {{birthday}} <b>as</b> <b>I</b> was <b>putting</b> {{the last}} chapter in final shape, I {{received a letter from}} father which said, [...] "I am coming East. Meet me in Washington on the 21st." [...] To this request there was but one answer: [...] "I'll be there." ...|$|R

60|$|Paul Ruttledge. That is not all. These {{things may}} be {{accomplished}} and yet nothing be accomplished. The Christian's {{business is not}} reformation but revelation, and the only labours he can put his hand to can never be accomplished in Time. He must so live that all things shall pass away. [He stands {{silent for a moment}} and then cries, lifting his hand above his head.] Give me wine out of thy pitchers; oh, God, how splendid is my cup of drunkenness. We must become blind, and deaf, and dizzy. We must get rid of everything that is not measureless eternal life. We must put out hope <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> out this candle. [Puts out a candle.] And memory <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> out this candle. [As before.] And thought, the waster of Life, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> out this candle. [As before.] And at last we must put out the light of the Sun and of the Moon, and all the light of the World and the World itself. [He now puts out the last candle, the chapel is very dark. The only light is the faint light of morning coming through the window.] We must destroy the World; we must destroy everything that has Law and Number, for where there is nothing, there is God.|$|E
60|$|I accepted, for I was thirsty, {{and half}} emptied at a draught the tumbler which he handed me. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> down the glass I caught a grim smile on de Cartienne's sallow face. But {{what it meant}} I could not tell, {{although}} it made me strangely uneasy.|$|E
60|$|<b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> {{my glass}} to my lips, he glanced with {{surprise}} {{at the end of}} his neckerchief, dropping from his mouth when he opened it, and stretched out his hand. I gave him mine, and then he drank, and drew his sleeve across his eyes and forehead.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Always so much older, so much rougher, and so {{much less}} worthy, even what I was must be {{dismissed}} by both of us, and you must see me only <b>as</b> <b>I</b> am. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> this parting kiss upon your cheek, my child--who {{might have been more}} near to me, who never could have been more dear--a ruined man far removed from you, for ever separated from you, whose course is run while yours is but beginning.

"Thank you so {{much for}} coming, Mr. Cranley," [...] she said; [...] "and, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>put</b> off luncheon till two, do tell me that you know someone who will suit me for my dear Bun-house.

6000|$|... "That {{is a very}} cold-blooded way {{of putting}} it," [...] said Lawrence, [...] "and I don't believe at all that she will look upon it in that light.
