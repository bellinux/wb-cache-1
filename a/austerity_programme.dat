5|$|The {{public sector}} {{is a major}} {{employer}} in Northern England. Between 2000 and 2008, the majority of new jobs created in Northern England were {{for the government and}} its suppliers and contractors. All three Northern regions have public sector employment above the national average, and North East has the highest level in England with 20.2% of the workforce in the public sector as of 2016 – down from 23.4% a decade earlier. The <b>austerity</b> <b>programme</b> under the government of David Cameron saw significant cuts to public services, and the reduction in public sector employment resulted in job losses for around 3% of the Northern England workforce with significant impact on the regional economy.|$|E

The Conservatives claimed credit for the upswing, promising to keep taxes low and reduce the deficit as well as promising an In/Out referendum on the UK's relationship with the European Union. The rival Labour party called for a higher minimum wage, and higher taxes on the rich. In Scotland, the SNP attacked the <b>austerity</b> <b>programme,</b> opposed nuclear weapons and demanded that promises of more autonomy for Scotland made during the independence referendum be delivered.|$|E
25|$|Fiscal {{conservatism}} in the UK {{was arguably}} most popular during the premiership of Margaret Thatcher, who, {{after a number}} of years of deficit spending under the previous Labour government, advocated spending cuts and selective tax increases to balance the budget. In 2010, {{as a result of the}} deterioration in the UK's public finances—according to fiscal conservatives caused by another spate of deficit spending under the previous Labour government, the late-2000s recession and by the European sovereign debt crisis—the Liberal Democrat-Conservative Coalition embarked on an <b>austerity</b> <b>programme,</b> featuring a combination of spending cuts and tax rises, in an attempt to halve the deficit and completely eliminate the structural deficit over the five-year parliament.|$|E

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version {{is available from the}} publisher via the DOI in this record. During the European debt crisis, numerous states launched <b>austerity</b> <b>programmes.</b> The International Monetary Fund (IMF) evaluates and forecasts the likelihood of member states’ success in implementing these programmes. Although IMF evaluations influence country risk perceptions on capital markets, little is known about their reasoning. This article uses fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to explore on what grounds the IMF evaluated the success prospects of <b>austerity</b> <b>programmes</b> during the European debt crisis. Results reveal that IMF evaluations are heavily influenced by the programme's implementation credibility. They require a tractable policy problem, a country's institutional capacity to structure implementation, and favour expenditure reduction over revenue measures. By acting as a strict guide on the road to fiscal adjustment, the IMF indirectly influences member states’ scope of policy making through its surveillance activities. Extensive <b>austerity</b> <b>programmes</b> that need to be implemented swiftly are evaluated negatively if the country is not involved in an IMF programme...|$|R
40|$|European <b>austerity</b> <b>programmes</b> have {{dismantled}} {{the mechanisms}} that reduce inequality and enable equitable growth. With inequality and poverty on the rise, Europe {{is facing a}} lost decade. An additional 15 to 25 million people across Europe could {{face the prospect of}} living in poverty by 2025 if austerity measures continue. Oxfam knows this because it has seen it before. The <b>austerity</b> <b>programmes</b> bear a striking resemblance to the ruinous structural adjustment policies imposed on Latin America, SouthEast Asia, and sub-Saharan African in the 1980 s and 1990 s. These policies were a failure: a medicine that sought to cure the disease by killing the patient. They cannot be allowed to happen again. Oxfam calls on the governments of Europe to turn away from austerity measures and instead choose a path of inclusive growth that delivers better outcomes for people, communities, and the environment...|$|R

In the absence of employment or redeployment policies to redress such problems, he wrote, the effects of the <b>austerity</b> <b>programmes</b> might create circumstances that could derail the PNDC recovery agenda.|$|R
2500|$|In {{response}} to the Great Recession, Cameron undertook the <b>austerity</b> <b>programme.</b> This was a deficit reduction programme consisting of sustained reductions in public spending, intended to reduce the government budget deficit and the welfare state in the United Kingdom. The National Health Service and education have been [...] "ringfenced" [...] and protected from direct spending cuts. Together with Chancellor George Osborne, Cameron aimed to eliminate the structural deficit (i.e. deficit on current spending as opposed to investment) and to have government debt falling {{as a percentage of}} GDP. By 2015 the deficit, as a percentage of GDP, had been reduced to half of what it was in 2010, and the sale of government assets (mostly the shares of banks nationalised in the 2000s) had resulted in government debt as a proportion of GDP falling.|$|E
2500|$|On 18 March 2016, Duncan Smith {{unexpectedly}} {{resigned from}} Cameron's cabinet. He {{stated that he}} was unable to accept the government’s planned cuts to disability benefits. He broadened this position, in a following interview on The Andrew Marr Show, launching an attack on the [...] "government’s <b>austerity</b> <b>programme</b> for balancing the books {{on the backs of the}} poor and vulnerable", describing this as divisive and [...] "deeply unfair", and adding: [...] "It is in danger of drifting in a direction that divides society rather than unites it." [...] Duncan Smith had opposed Cameron over the EU referendum but sources close to Duncan Smith said his resignation was not about Europe.

50|$|In {{exchange}} for European funding Greece {{was forced to}} impose strict fiscal austerity. As early as 2010 some economists expressed fears that {{the negative impact of}} tighter fiscal policy could offset the positive impact of lower borrowing costs and social disruption could have a significantly negative impact on investment and growth in the longer term. In a 2003 study that analysed 133 IMF <b>austerity</b> <b>programmes,</b> the IMF's independent evaluation office found that policy makers consistently underestimated the disastrous effects of rigid spending cuts on economic growth.|$|R
30|$|Nowadays, shortcuts in the {{educational}} and labour market policy are discussed. Based on our analysis, this policy has two negative effects: it increases the NEET risk and deepens the gap between young Austrians and young non-Austrians. It {{is important to be}} aware of both effects, as they may endanger social cohesion in Austria. These results support the current critiques at the EU level (Matsumoto et al. 2012; Hüttl et al. 2015) concerning the <b>austerity</b> <b>programmes</b> that impair the policy room in which the EU member states are able to combat youth unemployment.|$|R

5000|$|The {{rationale}} behind {{the need for}} achieving a balanced budget in the financial climate following the Great Recession has been questioned by some Keynesian economists. Andrew Gamble writing in Parliamentary Affairs in 2015 commented: Most macroeconomists now agree that the <b>austerity</b> <b>programme</b> pursued by the Coalition Government in its first two years was both too severe and unnecessary and set back the economic recovery which was underway {{in the first half}} of 2010. The Office of Budget Responsibility confirmed that the <b>austerity</b> <b>programme</b> reduced GDP, while the Oxford economist Simon Wren-Lewis has calculated that the Coalition Government's <b>austerity</b> <b>programme</b> cost the average household £4000 over the lifetime of the Parliament and severely damaged those public services which were not ring-fenced. [...] Ha-Joon Chang, writing in 2017, observed that [...] "in today’s UK economy, whose underlying stagnation has been masked only by the release of excess liquidity on an oceanic scale, some deficit spending may be good - necessary, even".|$|E

50|$|The {{result was}} seen as leading to a {{possible}} roll back of some <b>austerity</b> <b>programmes</b> initiated by the previous government amidst the European sovereign debt crisis. The new majority for the leftist block deprived the Danish People's Party of the kingmaker role it held under the previous government and used to tighten Danish immigrations policy. However, fundamental changes were not expected, as the Danish political consensus would maintain the welfare system in Denmark that is financed by high taxes. The {{state of the economy}} was also seen as a key factor for the anti-incumbent vote.|$|R
50|$|The International Monetary Fund (IMF) {{admitted}} that its forecast about Greek economy was too optimistic: in 2010 it described Greece's first bailout programme as a holding operation {{that gave the}} eurozone time to build a firewall to protect other vulnerable members, but in 2012 the unemployment rate of Greece became about 25 percent, compared to IMF's projection of about 15 percent. IMF conceded that it underestimated the damage that <b>austerity</b> <b>programmes</b> would do to the Greek economy, adding that, in terms of Greece's debt, IMF should have considered a debt restructuring earlier.|$|R

40|$|Austerity is an {{increasingly}} important feature of urban society in Western countries, both as a site interwoven with the crisis tendencies of capitalism and as spaces mitigating <b>austerity</b> <b>programmes</b> instigated by nation states. Cities have therefore become key spaces in the mediation of ‘austerity urbanism’, but where such processes involve deliberation, making the production of consensus highly problematic. Such tendencies require far greater intellectual sensitivity towards the practices of agents as they seek to enact social control and coordination, as well as subordinate resistance and critique. ‘Pragmatist Sociology’ is utilised in this paper to examine the construction and deployment of discursive institutions seeking to control the behaviour of actors, including reducing critique, {{with the intention of}} legitimising <b>austerity</b> <b>programmes.</b> Such discursive institutions establish semantic links between the discursive aims of those seeking to control and the pragmatics of the everyday lives of those subject to such institutions. The paper seeks to examine, first, through a case study of an English city, how key decision-makers construct discursive institutions in the implementation of austerity and subordination of resistance and, second, the actual practices of resisting austerity. In conclusion, the paper finds that austerity governance is characterised by discursive austerity institutions based on market and bureaucratic values, where large-scale critique has been marginalised, resulting in minor forms of critique in the everyday, and compounded by constant efforts at the reconfirmation of discursive institutions...|$|R
