This class of compounds {{could be viewed}} as synthetic equivalents of natures building block [...] 1, 3 -dihydroxyacetone and could be used in construction of many polyoxygenated natural products. A general, simple, cheap and easy to scale-up synthesis of 2 -substituted- 1, 3 dioxan- 5 -ones was developed. The yields of this three-step procedure, starting form commercially available tris(hydroxymethyl) nitromethane, ranged from 40 to 90 %. The exploration of the chemistry of 2 -substituted- 1, 3 -dioxan- 5 -ones was focused on carboanion chemistry of these compounds. 2 -Substituted- 1, 3 -dioxan- 5 -ones were shown to easily form corresponding lithium, boron and titanium enolates. The 2 -'tert'-butyl- 2 -methyl- 1, 3 -dioxan- 5 -one was deprotonated enantioselectively in 90 % e. e. with the aid of chiral lithium amide derived from (R) - or (S) -'N'-(2, 2, 2 -trifluoroethyl) - 1 -phenylethylamine. This successful outcome was a result of extensive methodological studies. The enolates reacted readily with electrophiles: reactions with aldehydes provided 'anti' <b>aldols</b> in modest to high selectivities in cases of lithium and boron enolates and 'syn' <b>aldols</b> in case of titanium enolate.
