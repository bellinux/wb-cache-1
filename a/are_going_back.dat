25|$|Ceramic {{capacitors}} {{may experience}} changes to their electrical parameters due to soldering stress. The {{heat of the}} solder bath, especially for SMD styles, can cause changes of contact resistance between terminals and electrodes. For ferroelectric class 2 ceramic capacitors, the soldering temperature is above the Curie point. The polarized domains in the dielectric <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> and the aging process of class 2 ceramic capacitors is starting again.|$|E

25|$|Discussions about Fahrenheit 451 often {{center on}} its story {{foremost}} {{as a warning}} against state-based censorship. Indeed, when Bradbury wrote the novel during the McCarthy era, {{he was concerned about}} censorship in the United States. During a radio interview in 1956, Bradbury said:I wrote this book at a time when I was worried about the way things were going in this country four years ago. Too many people were afraid of their shadows; there was a threat of book burning. Many of the books were being taken off the shelves at that time. And of course, things have changed a lot in four years. Things <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> in a very healthy direction. But at the time I wanted to do some sort of story where I could comment on what would happen to a country if we let ourselves go too far in this direction, where then all thinking stops, and the dragon swallows his tail, and we sort of vanish into a limbo and we destroy ourselves by this sort of action.|$|E
500|$|At 09:39, {{two minutes}} after Flight 77 {{impacted}} the Pentagon, {{air traffic controllers}} overheard Jarrah say, [...] "Here's the captain: I {{would like to tell}} you all to remain seated. We have a bomb aboard, and we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> to the airport, and we have our demands. So please remain quiet." [...] Air traffic controllers did not hear from the flight again. Passengers and crew began making phone calls to officials and family members starting at 09:30 using GTE airphones and mobile phones. Altogether, the passengers and crew made 35 airphone calls and two cell phone calls from the flight. Ten passengers and two crew members were able to connect, providing information to family, friends, and others on the ground.|$|E
500|$|At 08:33:59, Atta announced, [...] "Nobody move, please. We <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> to the airport. Don't try to {{make any}} stupid moves." [...] At 08:37:08, the pilots of United Airlines Flight 175 {{verified}} Flight11's location and heading to flight control. Boston ARTCC bypassed standard protocols and directly contacted the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) Northeast Air Defense Sector (NEADS) in Rome, New York. NEADS called on two F-15 fighter jets at Otis Air Force Base in Mashpee, Massachusetts, to intercept. Officials at Otis spent a few minutes getting authorization for the fighters to take off. Atta completed the final turn towards Manhattan at 08:43. The order to dispatch the fighters at Otis was given at 08:46, and the F-15s took off at 08:53, roughly seven minutes after American Airlines Flight11 had already crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center. Of the four hijacked aircraft on 9/11, the nine minutes of advance notification about the hijacking of Flight11 was the most time that NORAD had to respond before the aircraft crashed into its target.|$|E

I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> to Beatrice and my real life again--out of this well into which I had fallen. It would have needed something more than sea-sickness and quap fever to prevent my spirits rising.|$|R
2500|$|Provocations {{also took}} the form of fomenting racial strife. The Sherman Service Company, Inc., of Chicago sent {{instructions}} to an operative to [...] "stir up as much bad feeling as you possibly can between the Serbians and the Italians... The Italians <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> to work. Call up every question you can in reference to racial hatred between these two nationalities." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, {{the school}} began to remove {{asbestos}} {{from the walls}} and ceilings of the school, and added an elevator - luckily - apparently, the old {{part of the school}} was built on dirt, with no foundation beneath, so before the elevator was installed by Delta Elevators, a foundation was poured. [...] The construction is finally over and the artworks <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> up on the walls. [...] Another new piece of information is that the school has bought a piece of land across the street, formerly the Elmira Raceway, and now has a new sports field including a new track and field facility. There is also a large scoreboard at the new field.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the fact}} many bands from {{previous}} decades are still active, like DDT, Korol i Shut and Splean, {{due to the}} lack of new bands gaining significant attention there is a common view that Russian rock is in decline. Ilya Chert from the band Pilot said: [...] "I can see the decline of Russian rock. We <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> to the times, when those who are really talanted and wise are operating in basements and clubs with the capacity of 50 people, as they don't commercialize themselves and no one commercializes them". Artemy Troitsky, the famous Russian rock critic, wrote an article called [...] "Rock died a long time ago, but the funeral was impressive", where he brought up the lack of new faces in the Russian rock scene, and accused bands like Mashina Vremeni and Garik Sukachev for [...] "selling out" [...] and not protesting against the current government. Already in 2008 MTV Russia cancelled the nomination [...] "Best Rock Project", with the resulting headlines being [...] "MTV Recognized the Death of Russian Rock".|$|E

60|$|His {{eyes were}} dark and deep with unfathomable courage. Yet he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> in the morning. He <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>back.</b> All he had courage for {{was to go}} back. He would go back, though he died by inches. Why not? It was killing him, it was like living loaded with irons. But he {{had the courage to}} submit, to die that way, since it was the way allotted to him.|$|R
2500|$|The {{hijacking}} {{began at}} 8:14am—15 {{minutes after the}} flight departed—when beverage service would be starting. At this time, the pilots stopped responding to air traffic control, and the aircraft began deviating from the planned route. At 8:18am, flight attendants Betty Ong and Madeline Amy Sweeney began making phone calls to American Airlines to report what was happening. Ong provided information about lack of communication with the cockpit, {{lack of access to}} the cockpit, and passenger injuries. At 8:24:38am, a voice believed to be Atta's was heard by air traffic controllers, saying: [...] "We have some planes. Just stay quiet and you will be OK. We are returning to the airport." [...] "Nobody move, everything will be OK. If you try to make any moves you'll endanger yourself and the airplane. Just stay quiet." [...] "Nobody move, please. We <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> to the airport. Don't try to make any stupid moves." [...] The plane's transponder was turned off at 8:28am. At 8:46:40am, Atta flew the plane into the North Tower of the World Trade Center.|$|E
