40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine whether country (Australia or Japan) and client type (public sector or private sector) impact the auditor's client risk assessments, {{subsequent}} <b>audit</b> <b>planning</b> decisions (<b>planned</b> <b>audit</b> hours) and <b>audit</b> <b>planning</b> responsiveness to client risk assessments. Design/methodology/approach – The study is based on previously developed <b>audit</b> <b>planning</b> models and uses working paper-sourced data of planned auditor effort and nine client risk assessments. The study samples are taken from public and private sector audit engagements of two major audit firms in Australia and Japan, respectively. Findings – Evidence is found that country and client type do have an impact on the auditor's client risk assessments and <b>planned</b> total <b>audit</b> hours, but they do not moderate <b>audit</b> <b>planning</b> responsiveness to client risk assessments. Research limitations/implications – The test variable is confounded by the country and client type characteristics inherent in the study's samples. If the differences are caused by country, this suggests that <b>audit</b> <b>planning</b> decisions vary across countries, even when the same auditing standards are adopted. However, if they are caused by client type, this suggests that the same audit approach (i. e. the audit risk model) is applied differently depending on client characteristics. Practical implications – These findings are useful to international standard setters, audit practice quality control and training, and audit research. Originality/value – No prior study has examined the role of country and client type on the auditor's client risk assessments and <b>audit</b> <b>planning</b> decisions. Further, no prior study has examined whether the relationship between the auditor's client risk assessments and <b>audit</b> <b>planning</b> decisions is moderated by country and client type. <b>Audit</b> <b>planning,</b> <b>Audit</b> risk model, Australia, Client risk assessments, Country and client-type, Japan, Private sector, Public sector...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to increase our understanding of the manner in which auditors integrate information about management tone-at-the-top with other information when making <b>audit</b> <b>planning</b> decisions related to extent of substantive testing. <b>Audit</b> <b>planning</b> is an area that requires considerable professional judgment and involves the evaluation and integration of a wide range of information, such as the client’s internal environment including both tone-at-the-top and internal controls, planning phase analytical procedures (PPAP), and characteristics of the client’s business and the industry in which it operates. This research provides evidence that auditors do consider tone-at-the-top during the <b>audit</b> <b>planning</b> process and that this information is integrated with other relevant factors in extent-of-substantive-testing judgments. We use a complex task (Bonner 1994; Kennedy, et al. 1997) providing cues across several dimensions, including client tone-at-the-top, results of internal control tests and PPAP, and various client characteristics to study planned extent-of-substantive-testing judgments made by auditors. One goal is to determine whether auditors integrate information about tone-at-the-top during <b>audit</b> <b>planning</b> into subsequent extent-of-substantive-testing judgments. In addition, we determine how tone-at-the-top interacts with other relevant factors in <b>audit</b> <b>planning.</b> To our knowledge, this is the first study to specifically address tone-at-the-top as a planning consideration within the audit risk model and to operationalize this variable within an experiment along with tests of controls.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the relationship between the amounts obtained using professionally accepted quantitative benchmarks of <b>audit</b> <b>planning</b> materiality and the size of accounting misstatements corrected by financial statements restatements. Design/methodology/approach – The paper uses a sample of 136 companies (237 company years) that have restated such financial statements and compare the amounts of the restatements with planning materiality benchmarks (rules of thumb) established to aid auditors in arriving at <b>audit</b> <b>planning</b> levels. Findings – It was found that, depending on the method of analysis selected and the materiality benchmark followed, as high as approximately 62 per cent of the restatements involve income levels less than the planning materiality level. Research limitations/implications – The results lead to questions as to the appropriate relationship between the scope of audit procedures, which is in part determined by these quantitative materiality benchmarks, and subsequent financial statement restatements. Originality/value – The issue addressed in this study is important because if <b>audit</b> <b>planning</b> levels for materiality are in excess of the amounts subsequently restated due to accounting misstatements, this might serve as an explanation for a number of recent restatements. Furthermore, it might suggest the need to consider decreasing acceptable materiality planning levels, thus resulting in a recalibration of the audit process.
