40|$|An {{experimental}} and numerical {{study of the}} aerodynamics of a cyclist in a typical racing position is presented. The study aims to provide understanding of the fundamental aerodynamic char-acteristics which underpin variations of drag with changes to rider shape and position. Experimentally, for a mannequin (with static crank/leg position) in a wind tunnel, velocity fields at sev-eral streamwise stations are measured by traversing the plane with a probe. The structure of the wake depends strongly on the leg position, {{is associated with the}} flow around the hips and can lead to large variations in the drag. Numerically, the same mannequin geometry is modeled and the flow simulated using a commercial fluid flow solver (ANSYS–CFX). Similar variation with crank <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>drag</b> and flow topology is observed. Tran-sient flow simulations are found to match better with the mean velocity experimental measurements. It is found that for some crank angles, the wake is defined by a relatively strong vortex pair, and for others the wake is more oscillatory...|$|E

40|$|The present work {{attempts}} {{to characterize the}} flow of shear-thinning power-law fluids past a flat plate as the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> attack is varied. The effects of Reynolds number, shear-thinning characteristics and <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> attack on <b>drag</b> and lift <b>of</b> the flat plate were investigated, both experimentally and numerically. Carbopol 940 solutions of various strengths were used to approximate purely viscous shear-thinning non-Newtonian fluids for the experiments. An important finding is that at small <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> attack when the wall shear forms the dominant contribution to the drag, the non-Newtonian shear-thinning property leads to drag reduction, whereas for large <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> attack, when pressure-induced form drag is dominant, shear-thinning results in drag augmentation.

40|$|An {{experimental}} study of surface pressure distributions on a family of blunt and sharp large angle cones was made in hypersonic flows of helium, air, and tetrafluoromethane. The effective isentropic exponents of these flows were 1. 67, 1. 40, and 1. 12. Thus, the effect of large shock density ratios such as might be encountered during planetary entry because of real-gas effects could be studied by comparing results in tetrafluoromethane with those in air and helium. It was found that shock density ratio had a large effect on both shock shape and pressure distribution. The differences in pressure distribution indicate that for atmospheric flight at high speed where real-gas effects produce large shock density ratios, large-angle cone vehicles {{can be expected to}} experience different trim <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> attack, <b>drag</b> coefficient, and lift-drag ratios than those for ground tests in air wind tunnels...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{interest}} in the induced <b>drag</b> characteristics <b>of</b> crescent-shaped wings {{has led to a}} closer look at the methods used for determination <b>of</b> induced <b>drag</b> from computational aerodynamic methods. Induced drag may be computed by integration of surface pressure, or by evaluation of a contour integral in the Trefftz plane. A high-order panel method was used to study the induced <b>drag</b> <b>of</b> crescent and elliptical wings using both techniques. Induced drag computations using surface-pressure integration were strongly affected by panel density and <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> attack. Accurate <b>drag</b> computations for the crescent wing were obtained only when the spanwise as well as chordwise panel density was extremely high. Trefftz-plane results for the two wing planforms do not show this sensitivity to panel density or <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> attack. Span efficiencies of 0. 994 for the crescent wing and 0. 987 for the elliptical wing were computed by the Trefftz-plane technique. Substitution of a force-free, rolled-up wake geometry on the crescent wing did not change the pressure-integrated drag significantly. The slightly higher span efficiency of the crescent wing is attributed to a more nearly elliptical spanwise lift distribution. The chord distribution of the elliptical wing was modified to produce an elliptical span-loading on a wing with an unswept quarter-chord line. This wing demonstrated a span efficiency equal to that of the crescent wing...|$|R
