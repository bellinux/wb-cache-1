5|$|From {{the point}} of view of physics, spirals are lowest-energy {{configurations}} which emerge spontaneously through self-organizing processes in dynamic systems. From {{the point of}} view of chemistry, a spiral can be generated by a reaction-diffusion process, involving both activation and inhibition. Phyllotaxis is controlled by proteins that manipulate the concentration of the plant hormone <b>auxin,</b> which activates meristem growth, alongside other mechanisms to control the relative angle of buds around the stem. From a biological perspective, arranging leaves as far apart as possible in any given space is favoured by natural selection as it maximises access to resources, especially sunlight for photosynthesis.|$|E
5|$|In plants, {{signaling}} by auxins, or phytohormones {{that order}} {{the direction and}} tropism of plant growth, induces the targeting of a class of transcription factor repressors known as Aux/IAA proteins for proteasomal degradation. These proteins are ubiquitinated by SCFTIR1, or SCF in complex with the <b>auxin</b> receptor TIR1. Degradation of Aux/IAA proteins derepresses transcription factors in the auxin-response factor (ARF) family and induces ARF-directed gene expression. The cellular consequences of ARF activation depend on the plant type and developmental stage, but are involved in directing growth in roots and leaf veins. The specific response to ARF derepression {{is thought to be}} mediated by specificity in the pairing of individual ARF and Aux/IAA proteins.|$|E
25|$|Surrounding <b>auxin</b> maxima are {{cells with}} low <b>auxin</b> troughs, or <b>auxin</b> minima. For example, in the Arabidopsis fruit, <b>auxin</b> minima {{have been shown}} to be {{important}} for its tissue development.|$|E

Broad-leaf plants (dicots), such as dandelions, {{are much more}} susceptible to <b>auxins</b> than narrow-leaf plants (monocots) such as grasses and cereal crops, so these synthetic <b>auxins</b> are valuable as synthetic herbicides.|$|R
40|$|Chloroindole <b>auxins</b> {{are useful}} tools in {{understanding}} the signal transduction pathways of the <b>auxins.</b> However, their presence is not acclaimed in majority of the plants. This gives an impression that these <b>auxins</b> could be having certain roles in plants enriched with them. Therefore, the seeds of Solanum melongena (L.) cv. Pusa were soaked in 0, 10 - 8 or 10 - 6 M aqueous solutions of IAA, 4,Cl-IAA, 5,Cl-IAA, 6,Cl-IAA, 7,Cl-IAA, 4, 6,Cl 2 -IAA and 4, 7,Cl 2 -IAA for 8 h and cultivated in clay pots. All the <b>auxins</b> improved the growth and NR activity compared with water soaked control. 4,Cl-IAA was most prominent in its effect, generating 29, 54, 30, 34 and 47 % higher values for shoot and root length, fresh and dry mass and NR activity, respectively, in 15 day old plants.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the role of}} cytokinins and <b>auxins</b> in somatic embryogenesis of the West Australian nickel hyperaccumulating shrub, Hybanthus floribundus. Nodal segments from micropropagated shoots were inoculated on to callus induction media consisting of basic MS medium supplemented with <b>auxins</b> (2, 4 -D, dicamba or picloram at 0, 1 or 5 µM), cytokinins (zeatin or Kn at 0, 0. 1, 0. 5 or 1. 0 µM) or combinations of both <b>auxins</b> and cytokinins. Four weeks after culturing calli were observed. Callus pieces were subcultured on to fresh MS medium without any plant growth regulators. Explants produced both calli and shoots in all combinations of cytokinins and <b>auxins.</b> Development of somatic embryos was moderate and highly dependent upon the type and concentration of plant growth regulators used.

25|$|The {{regulation}} of PIN protein localisation {{in a cell}} determines the direction of <b>auxin</b> transport from cell, and concentrated effort of many cells creates peaks of <b>auxin,</b> or <b>auxin</b> maxima (regions having cells with higher <b>auxin</b> – a maximum). Proper and timely <b>auxin</b> maxima within developing roots and shoots are necessary to organise {{the development of the}} organ.|$|E
25|$|<b>Auxin</b> stimulates cell {{elongation}} by stimulating wall-loosening factors, such as elastins, {{to loosen}} cell walls. The effect is stronger if gibberellins are also present. <b>Auxin</b> also stimulates cell division if cytokinins are present. When <b>auxin</b> and cytokinin {{are applied to}} callus, rooting can be generated if the <b>auxin</b> concentration is higher than cytokinin concentration. Xylem tissues can be generated when the <b>auxin</b> concentration {{is equal to the}} cytokinins.|$|E
25|$|This process, polar <b>auxin</b> transport, is directional, very {{strictly}} regulated, {{and based}} in uneven distribution of <b>auxin</b> efflux carriers on the plasma membrane, which send auxins {{in the proper}} direction. While PIN-FORMED (PIN) proteins are vital in transporting <b>auxin</b> in a polar manner, the family of AUXIN1/LIKE-AUX1 (AUX/LAX) genes encodes for non-polar <b>auxin</b> influx carriers.|$|E

50|$|A {{class of}} plant hormones called <b>auxins</b> {{coordinates}} this root growth process. <b>Auxins</b> {{play a key}} role in bending the plants root towards the water because they cause one side of the root to grow faster than the other and thus the bending of the root.|$|R

25|$|Fruits form {{abnormal}} morphologies when <b>auxin</b> transport is disturbed. In Arabidopsis fruits, <b>auxin</b> {{controls the}} release of seeds from the fruit (pod). The valve margins are a specialised tissue in pods that regulates when pod will open (dehiscence). <b>Auxin</b> must {{be removed from the}} valve margin cells to allow the valve margins to form. This process requires modification of the <b>auxin</b> transporters (PIN proteins).|$|E
25|$|<b>Auxin</b> induces shoot apical dominance; the {{axillary}} buds are inhibited by <b>auxin,</b> as a {{high concentration}} of <b>auxin</b> directly stimulates ethylene synthesis in axillary buds, causing inhibition of their growth and potentiation of apical dominance. When the apex of the plant is removed, the inhibitory effect is removed and the growth of lateral buds is enhanced. <b>Auxin</b> is sent to the part of the plant facing away from the light, where it promotes cell elongation, thus causing the plant to bend towards the light.|$|E
25|$|<b>Auxin</b> {{participates in}} phototropism, geotropism, hydrotropism and other {{developmental}} changes. The uneven distribution of <b>auxin,</b> due to environmental cues, such as unidirectional light or gravity force, results in uneven plant tissue growth, and generally, <b>auxin</b> governs {{the form and}} shape of plant body, direction and strength of growth of all organs, and their mutual interaction.|$|E
40|$|Peroxidase {{secretion}} {{by three}} sugarbeet cell {{lines in the}} absence of Ca 2 + was unaffected by the addition of <b>auxins</b> of different chemical structures. The six <b>auxins</b> tested had no effect on the Ca 2 + -promoted peroxidase secretion by habituated non-organogenic cells (HNO), but they enhanced the secretion by normal non-organogenic cells (NNO) and three of them inhibited it {{in the case of the}} habituated organogenic line. A 5 -week subculture of the auxinindependent HNO callus on auxin-containing media increased the sensitivity of cells to Ca 2 + and their responsiveness to <b>auxins</b> in suspension cultures. Conversely, subculture of the auxin-requiring NNO callus on auxin-deficient medium induced a decreased sensitivity to Ca 2 + and a complete loss of response to <b>auxins.</b> The possible regulation of peroxidase secretion by Ca 2 +- and auxin-receptors is discussed. © 1983.

40|$|Spermidine and {{ornithine}} {{given to}} normal auxin-requiring cell suspensions of sugarbeet inhibited peroxidase secretion {{in the absence}} of Ca 2 +. Habituated (organogenic or not) cells did not respond. Both compounds counteracted the Ca 2 + - promoted enzyme secretion by three cell lines. <b>Auxins</b> (2, 4 -D and BSAA) did not modify the extracellular level of peroxidase activity {{in the absence of}} Ca 2 + When Ca 2 + was added, <b>auxins</b> increased its effect in normal cells and had practically no effect in habituated cells. The inhibitory effect of spermidine and ornithine was somewhat reduced by <b>auxins</b> in normal cells and increased in habituated cells. It was hypothesized that the effect of <b>auxins</b> did not involve the mediation of polyamines and that both types of compounds directly interacted with Ca 2 + at the membrane level. © 1985 Springer-Verlag.

25|$|On the {{molecular}} level, all auxins are compounds with an aromatic ring and a carboxylic acid group. The most important {{member of the}} <b>auxin</b> family is indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), which generates the majority of <b>auxin</b> effects in intact plants, and is the most potent native <b>auxin.</b> And as native <b>auxin,</b> its stability is controlled in many ways in plants, from synthesis, through possible conjugation to degradation of its molecules, always {{according to the requirements}} of the situation. However, molecules of IAA are chemically labile in aqueous solution, so it is not used commercially as a plant growth regulator.|$|E
25|$|To cause gall formation, the T-DNA encodes {{genes for}} the {{production}} of <b>auxin</b> or indole-3-acetic acid via the IAM pathway. This biosynthetic pathway is not used in many plants {{for the production}} of <b>auxin,</b> so it means the plant has no molecular means of regulating it and <b>auxin</b> will be produced constitutively. Genes {{for the production of}} cytokinins are also expressed. This stimulates cell proliferation and gall formation.|$|E
25|$|Auxins promote root initiation. <b>Auxin</b> induces both {{growth of}} {{pre-existing}} roots and adventitious root formation, i.e., branching of the roots. As more native <b>auxin</b> is transported down the stem to the roots, the overall {{development of the}} roots is stimulated. If the source of <b>auxin</b> is removed, such as by trimming the tips of stems, the roots are less stimulated accordingly, and growth of stem is supported instead.|$|E
30|$|The {{algorithm}} is basically composed of three processes. The {{first is the}} growth of the leaf. Alongside, the other two happen: the development of the venation pattern, which is directly influenced by the distribution of the sources of <b>auxins</b> in the leaf (representing free spaces), and the generation of new <b>auxins,</b> which in turn is affected by the development of veins.|$|R

25|$|On the {{cellular}} level, <b>auxin</b> {{is essential for}} cell growth, affecting both cell division and cellular expansion. <b>Auxin</b> concentration level, together with other local factors, contributes to cell differentiation and specification of the cell fate.|$|E
25|$|<b>Auxin</b> {{molecules}} {{present in}} cells may trigger responses directly through stimulation or inhibition of {{the expression of}} sets of certain genes or by means independent of gene expression. <b>Auxin</b> transcriptionally activates four different families of early genes (aka primary response genes), so-called because the components required for the activation are preexisting, leading to a rapid response. The families are glutathione S-transferases, <b>auxin</b> homeostasis proteins like GH3, SAUR genes of currently unknown function, and the Aux/IAA repressors.|$|E
25|$|The (dynamic and {{environment}} responsive) pattern of <b>auxin</b> distribution within {{the plant is}} a key factor for plant growth, its reaction to its environment, and specifically for development of plant organs (such as leaves or flowers). It is achieved through very complex and well coordinated active transport of <b>auxin</b> molecules from cell to cell throughout the plant body — by the so-called polar <b>auxin</b> transport. Thus, a plant can (as a whole) react to external conditions and adjust to them, without requiring a nervous system. Auxins typically act in concert with, or in opposition to, other plant hormones. For example, the ratio of <b>auxin</b> to cytokinin in certain plant tissues determines initiation of root versus shoot buds.|$|E

25|$|TIR1 {{proteins}} are F-box {{proteins that}} have three different domains {{giving them the}} ability to bind to three different ligands: an SCFTIR1 ubiquitin ligase complex (using the F-box domain), <b>auxin</b> (so TIR1 proteins are <b>auxin</b> receptors), and Aux/IAA proteins (via a degron domain). Upon binding of <b>auxin,</b> a TIR1 protein's degron domain has increased affinity for Aux/IAA repressor proteins, which when bound to TIR1 and its SCF complex undergo ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by a proteasome. The degradation of Aux/IAA proteins frees ARF proteins to activate or repress genes at whose promoters they are bound.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} {{principle of}} plant organization based upon <b>auxin</b> distribution is apical dominance, {{which means the}} <b>auxin</b> produced by the apical bud (or growing tip) diffuses (and is transported) downwards and inhibits the development of ulterior lateral bud growth, which would otherwise compete with the apical tip for light and nutrients. Removing the apical tip and its suppressively acting <b>auxin</b> allows the lower dormant lateral buds to develop, and the buds between the leaf stalk and stem produce new shoots which compete to become the lead growth. The process is actually quite complex, because <b>auxin</b> transported downwards from the lead shoot tip has to interact with several other plant hormones (such as strigolactones or cytokinins) in the process on various positions along the growth axis in plant body to achieve this phenomenon. This plant behavior is used in pruning by horticulturists.|$|E
25|$|<b>Auxin</b> plays also a minor {{role in the}} {{initiation}} of flowering and development of reproductive organs. In low concentrations, it can delay the senescence of flowers. A number of plant mutants have been described that affect flowering and have deficiencies in either <b>auxin</b> synthesis or transport. In maize, one example is bif2 barren inflorescence2.|$|E

50|$|In {{plant tissue}} culture IBA and other <b>auxins</b> are used to {{initiate}} root formation in vitro in a procedure called micropropagation. Micropropagation of plants {{is the process of}} using small samples of plants called explants and causing them to undergo growth of differentiated or undifferentiated cells. In connection with cytokinins like kinetin, <b>auxins</b> like IBA can be used to cause the formation of masses of undifferentiated cells called callus. Callus formation is often used as a first step process in micropropagation where the callus cells are then caused to form other tissues such as roots by exposing them to certain hormones like <b>auxins</b> that produce roots. The process of callus to root formation is called indirect organogenesis whereas if roots are formed from the explant directly it is called direct organogenesis.|$|R
