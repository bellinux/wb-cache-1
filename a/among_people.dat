5|$|A {{supportive}} {{environment and}} family generally gives those with Tourette's {{the skills to}} manage the disorder. People with Tourette's may learn to camouflage socially inappropriate tics or to channel the energy of their tics into a functional endeavor. Accomplished musicians, athletes, public speakers, and professionals {{from all walks of}} life are found <b>among</b> <b>people</b> with Tourette's. Outcomes in adulthood are associated more with the perceived significance of having severe tics as a child than with the actual severity of the tics.

5|$|As for Casler's third {{possible}} explanation for nominative determinism, genetics, researchers Voracek, Rieder, Stieger, and Swami found some evidence for it in 2015.

5|$|In general, {{people with}} Birt–Hogg–Dubé {{syndrome}} are at roughly seven times {{the risk of}} kidney cancer compared to the unaffected population. Estimates of the incidence <b>among</b> <b>people</b> with the disease range from 14%–34%. Rarely, it is associated with clear cell renal cell carcinoma and papillary renal cell carcinoma. If it develops in someone with BHD, renal cell carcinoma occurs later in life and has a poor prognosis. Though the types of tumor typically associated with BHD are considered less aggressive, cases of advanced or metastatic kidney cancer have been observed in people with the syndrome. Both benign and cancerous tumors can reduce kidney function over time as they grow larger.|$|E

5|$|An unusual {{feature of}} this {{pandemic}} was that it mostly killed young adults. In 1918–1919, 99% of pandemic influenza deaths in the U.S. occurred in people under 65, and nearly half in young adults 20 to 40years old. In 1920, the mortality rate <b>among</b> <b>people</b> under 65 had decreased sixfold to half the mortality rate of people over 65, but still 92% of deaths occurred in people under 65. This is noteworthy, since influenza is normally most deadly to weak individuals, such as infants (under age two), the very old (over age 70), and the immunocompromised. In 1918, older adults may have had partial protection caused by exposure to the 1889–1890 flu pandemic, known as the Russian flu.|$|E
