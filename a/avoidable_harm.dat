40|$|Objectives: Injection {{drug users}} (IDUs) {{are at high}} risk for HIV, hepatitis, {{overdose}} and other harms. Greater drug treatment availability has been shown to reduce these harms among IDUs. Yet, little is known about changes in drug treatment availability for IDUs in the U. S. This paper investigates change in drug treatment coverage for IDUs in 90 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) during 1993 - 2002. Methods: We define treatment coverage as the percent of IDUs who are in treatment. The number of IDUs in drug treatment is calculated from treatment entry data and treatment census data acquired from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration, divided by our estimated number of IDUs in each MSA. Results: Treatment coverage was low in 1993 (mean 6. 7 %; median 6. 0 %) and only increased to a mean of 8. 3 % and median of 8. 0 % coverage in 2002. Conclusions: Although some MSAs experienced increases in treatment coverage over time, overall levels of coverage were low. The persistence of low drug treatment coverage for IDUs represents a failure by the U. S. health care system to prevent <b>avoidable</b> <b>harms</b> and unnecessary deaths in this population.

40|$|Against the {{backdrop}} of new research evidence suggesting breast screening causes <b>avoidable</b> <b>harms</b> and that women are not being given enough information to make informed decisions, we sought to explore the positions on breast screening adopted by a range of stakeholders and the coverage of this debate in the media. We sampled material from national newspapers, charity bodies’ websites and official bodies’ websites over a two-year period, and analysed this using thematic content analysis. Charities’ and official bodies’ positions were similar in that they were supportive of the NHS breast screening programme, and tended to defend it against its critics. They acknowledged, and partially explained the imperfect nature of breast screening but often omitted important information such as simple frequency statistics. There was a tendency for newspapers to cover the screening debate in an oblique way – presenting case studies of ‘real’ women and celebrities. These were mostly positive accounts of women who believed they had benefited from screening and supported the programme. Engagement with the debate in terms of discussion of the criticisms of the programme was lacking. The debate about breast cancer screening, and the increasing focus on its potential harms, received less coverage in the popular media than might have been expected. Interested stakeholder groups do make publicly available information about their positions on the relative value of screening, but these {{tend to focus on}} emphasising the potential benefits and less on the possible harms.

40|$|The {{situation}} of {{children whose parents}} are involved in adult criminal proceedings is emerging as a pressing public policy concern. There is {{a growing body of}} empirical evidence recognizing the adverse effects for dependent children both as direct and indirect victims of their parents’ criminal behaviour and in relation to criminal justice decisions about their parents, especially when a court is remanding or sentencing a parent who is a primary or sole caregiver to custody. At the same time, the empirical research shows that both formal and informal support and interventions can mitigate the negative effects of such an adverse experience on children, especially when activated early in the criminal justice decision-making process. In this report, we highlight the growing influence of an evolving international legal standard establishing a yet to be fully defined requirement for criminal courts to systematically recognize and consider the best interests of a child when sentencing a parent or a legal guardian as a specific and independent legal consideration in order to mitigate foreseeable and <b>avoidable</b> <b>harms</b> to the child. We also examine how selected, mainly common law, countries, including Canada, are interpreting and applying this standard in their domestic policy and laws and review someof the innovative child and family focused criminal justice practices that are being adopted in various jurisdictions. Finally, we briefly discuss the implications of these various developments for sentencing reform in Canada and point to some opportunities for Canadian legal and institutional reforms to move forward on this important child and family rights issue.

40|$|Progress in {{improving}} patient safety in hospitals has been frustratingly slow, for several reasons. There are, for example, few proven effective improvement interventions available. Evaluation {{of the effectiveness}} of safety interventions is complicated by the complexity and variability of these interventions due to local differences and preferences of care providers. In addition, a reduction in <b>avoidable</b> <b>harm</b> is difficult to measure due to the requirement for a large number of patients and lack of reliable instruments for measuring effectiveness. Also, problems experienced by care providers when implementing safety interventions are not being systematically addressed. For these reasons, the aim of the Dutch national safety programme in hospitals - to reduce the incidence of <b>avoidable</b> <b>harm</b> by 50 % in 5 years - will not be feasible or measurable.

40|$|Abstract Background: Futile CPR has the {{potential}} to inflict significant, <b>avoidable</b> <b>harms</b> on dying patients. Futile CPR is widely debated in the literature, but there is little research into futile CPR in the context of nursing. There are no published studies exploring student nurses’ understanding of futile CPR. Aim: To explore student nurses’ understanding of futile CPR Methods: A mixed methods study, using questionnaires to establish background data and identify prominent issues. These issues were then explored in greater depth using semi-structured interviews. The interview transcripts were coded and analysed thematically. Results: Students were aware of some issues related to CPR, and felt that CPR was not compatible with a good death. However, they identified a number of factors that limited their ability to prevent futile CPR. These included a lack of support in policy for nurses’ decision making, a lack of knowledge regarding the reality of CPR and social pressures on nurses to perform CPR. Conclusions: Student nurse CPR training should address the wider sociocultural context of CPR, and provide student nurses with enough knowledge of issues related to CPR (such as survival rates) to allow them to make informed decisions and communicate these effectively with patients, relatives and staff. Attitudes influence actions, and therefore it is vital that student nurses’ attitudes towards CPR are based on accurate clinical information and reflect the reality of CPR in practice. Because very few students in this study had experienced CPR, it is vital that CPR education delivers this. There is also a need for clarification of policy to support those who feel able to identify when CPR would be inappropriate or futile, but feel pressured to perform CPR nonetheless due to fear of repercussion...|$|R

A survey collected data from 2238 individuals living in flood-affected areas of England (South Yorkshire and Worcestershire) in 2007. We used Bayesian structural equation modeling to assess factors relating to the latent variables of resilience (years in area, family nearby, and social cohesion) and vulnerability (disruption of essential services, flood risk, and previous flood experience). Results. Flooding was strongly associated with poor mental health; however, resilience factors (associated with the ability to cope with natural disasters), but not vulnerability, were strongly associated with a reduction in psychological distress. Conclusions. Resilience and social cohesion were important influences on the risk of developing poor mental health following flooding.

40|$|Reducing avoidable {{time delays}} in {{immediate}} medication administration-learning from a failed intervention Sachin Nagar, nicola davey University Hospitals Leicester NHS Trust Stat medications are regularly prescribed on hospital wards {{as part of}} the ongoing care for patients. Because they are prescribed at variable times that do not coincide with regular nursing drug administration times, they rely on good communication and vigilance on staff to ensure they are administered in a timely manner. Delays in drug administration can lengthen patient recovery times, prolong admission, and can lead to <b>avoidable</b> patient <b>harm</b> and suffering. While working on a geriatrics ward I noticed that there were often significant delays in administration of stat medications which occurred on a regular basis. I therefore investigated this by collecting data over a two week period to assess the situation based on our current practice. After root cause analysis (figure 1), it became clear that communication between staff was a significant factor in delayed administration. A solution was implemented in the form of "ward bay wall charts " to aid documentation and communication of stat medication requirements between nursing and medical staff with the intention to reduce delays by improving communication.

A complex design cannot be easily leaned out in production; therefore, the production of affordable and sustainable products requires effective lean design considerations at the conceptual level. The research presented in this thesis investigates and demonstrates the application of lean design for product enhancement. The aim of the research was to develop a novel lean design framework that would support the generation of product design with attributes such as maximise value, manufacturable, and operable with minimum waste and resources ensuring <b>avoidable</b> <b>harm</b> is eliminated. The framework consists of a systemised process which is organised in to phases and activities that provides a unique practical manner to lean out a design. The construction of the framework initiated with an extensive literature review and proceeded with an industrial field study which consisted of 34 interviews with 11 manufacturing companies in Europe. The findings were amalgamated to generate a lean design definition and principles which would form the foundations of the framework. A real-life industrial case study of an offshore oil/water separator was used to validate the framework. In conclusion, the lean design framework provides the necessary means by which a lean design {{can be achieved}}. As a result a functionally viable and enhanced design that is cheaper to manufacture through controlling waste and eliminating <b>avoidable</b> <b>harm</b> occurrence can be realised with minimal effort.

There is little known regarding statin myotoxicity in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians who are at high cardiovascular risk and likely to receive statins. AIMS To describe features of serious statin-associated myotoxicity (SSAM) occurring in Indigenous Australians and increase awareness of this condition. METHODS Observational case series of SSAM in Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islanders. Cases were identified from personal clinical experience, referrals, reports to the Therapeutic Goods Administration, medical literature, an Internet search and reports from a histopathology laboratory. Information was collected onto a standardised data collection form. RESULTS Fifteen cases of serious myotoxicity in Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islanders exposed to statins were identified from 2006 to 2012. The mean age was 55 (range 35 – 69). Painless weakness {{was the most common}} presentation. Interacting drugs were involved in seven cases. Biopsies were done in eight cases, three showed inflammatory polymyositis and five necrotising myositis. Three patients died and two had permanent severe disability.

40|$|Rationale, {{aims and}} objectives: Reducing {{preventable}} harm from repeat medication prescriptions is a patient safety priority worldwide. In the United Kingdom, repeat prescriptions items issued {{has doubled in}} the last 20 years from 5. 8 to 13. 3 items per patient per annum. This has significant resource implications and consequences for <b>avoidable</b> patient <b>harms.</b> Consequently, we aimed to test a risk management model to identify, measure, and reduce repeat prescribing system risks in primary care. Methods: All 48 general medical practices in National Health Service (NHS) Lambeth Clinical Commissioning Group (an inner city area of south London in England) were recruited. Multiple interventions were implemented, including educational workshops, a web-based risk monitoring system, and external reviews of repeat prescribing system risks by clinicians. Data were collected via documentation reviews and interviews and subject to basic thematic and descriptive statistical analyses. Results: Across the 48 participating general practices, 62 unique repeat prescribing risks were identified on 505 occasions (eg, practices frequently experiencing difficulty interpreting medication changes on hospital discharge summaries), equating to a mean of 8. 1 risks per practice (range: 1 - 33; SD = 7. 13). Seven hundred sixty-seven system improvement actions were recommended across 96 categories (eg, alerting hospitals to illegible writing and delays with discharge summaries) with a mean of 15. 6 actions per practice (range: 0 - 34; SD = 8. 0). Conclusions: The risk management model tested uncovered important safety concerns and facilitated the development and communication of related improvement recommendations. System-wide information on hazardous repeat prescribing and how this could be mitigated is very limited. The approach reported may have potential to close this gap and improve the reliability of general practice systems and patient safety, which should be of high interest to primary care organisations internationally...|$|R
40|$|Patient {{safety is}} a central issue in healthcare. In the United Kingdom, where there is more {{accurate}} information on National Health Service (NHS) hospitals than on primary care or the private sector, the evidence on adverse incidents shows that <b>avoidable</b> medical <b>harm</b> is a major concern. This paper looks at the occurrence of medical harm and argues that {{in the construction of}} patient safety reforms, {{it is important to be}} aware of alternative narratives about issues of power and accountability from harmed patients and self-help groups, that challenge dominant perspectives on the issues. The paper draws upon evidence from two sources. First, the paper draws on experiences of self-help groups set up as a result of medical harm and part of a campaigning network, where evidence was gathered from 14 groups over more than 2 years. In addition, data were obtained from 21 individuals affected by harm that attended a residential workshop called the Break Through Programme; 18 questionnaires were completed from participants and a written narrative account of their experiences and observational data were gathered from a range of workshop sessions. Looking at the issues from harmed patients' perspectives, the research illustrates that a model of medical harm focussing predominantly upon the clinical markers and individual agency associated with a medical model operates to obscure a range of social processes. These social processes, connected to the power and dominance of the medical profession and the activities of a wider state, are seen to be a major part of the construction of harm that impacts upon patients, which is further compounded by its concealment. Understanding the experiences of harmed patients is therefore seen as an important way of generating knowledge about the medical and social processes involved in harm, that can lead to a broader framework for addressing patient safety.

40|$|Introduction: Newly {{qualified}} {{doctors are}} frequently {{first to the}} scene in managing acutely unwell in-patients. Failures in clinical assessment, basic management and early escalation of care lead to avoidable patient morbidity and mortality. Analyses of adverse events have highlighted the importance of non-technical skills training to improve patient safety. These are a combination of cognitive (such as decision making) and social skills (such as team working), which complement knowledge and technical ability, and contribute to safe and effective care. In order to train and assess junior doctors in these skills, we must first have an accurate understanding of what they involve. This research project was designed to identify the critical non-technical skills required by junior doctors to manage acutely unwell patients safely and effectively. It aimed to develop a tool to observe these skills {{that could be used}} in training, assessment and research. Method: A literature review was used to develop an initial framework to categorise the non-technical skills required in this domain. Twenty-nine in depth semi-structured interviews were then completed with junior doctors. A critical incident technique was utilised: Junior doctors were asked to recall a challenging case in which they managed an acute medical emergency. Interviews were transcribed and coded using template analysis. A panel of subject matter experts were then consulted in order to refine this framework and develop an assessment tool for observing these skills. This involved two focus groups and an iterative process, returning to the original data to verify any changes. Results: Four categories of critical non-technical skills were identified: Situation awareness, decision-making, task management and teamwork. Each of these had between three and four sub-categories. Descriptors, exemplar behaviours and an assessment scale were developed to allow these non-technical skills to be observed and rated using a behavioural marker system. During the development of this tool, exploration of the data revealed the influence of factors such as hierarchy and culture on the behaviour of junior doctors.
