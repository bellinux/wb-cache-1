5|$|Although she has {{campaigned on}} her husband's behalf since {{early in his}} {{political}} career by handshaking and fund-raising, she did not relish the activity at first. When she campaigned during her husband's 2000 run for United States House of Representatives, her boss at the University of Chicago {{asked if there was}} <b>any</b> <b>single</b> thing about campaigning that she enjoyed; after some thought, she replied that visiting so many living rooms had given her some new decorating ideas. Obama opposed her husband's run for the congressional seat, and, after his defeat, she preferred he tend to the financial needs of the family in what she deemed a more practical way.|$|E

The latter became as important as Illyria {{as a source of}} auxiliary recruits, especially cavalry and archers. Britain in mid-2nd century contained the largest number of auxiliary regiments in <b>any</b> <b>single</b> province: about 60 out of about 400 (15%). By the rule of Nero (54–68), auxiliary numbers may have reached, by one estimate, about 200,000 men, implying about 400 regiments.|$|E

5|$|The Moon {{has long}} been {{associated}} with insanity and irrationality; the words lunacy and lunatic (popular shortening loony) are derived from the Latin name for the Moon, Luna. Philosophers Aristotle and Pliny the Elder argued that the full moon induced insanity in susceptible individuals, believing that the brain, which is mostly water, must {{be affected by the}} Moon and its power over the tides, but the Moon's gravity is too slight to affect <b>any</b> <b>single</b> person. Even today, people who believe in a lunar effect claim that admissions to psychiatric hospitals, traffic accidents, homicides or suicides increase during a full moon, but dozens of studies invalidate these claims.|$|E

5|$|The {{presence}} {{of a combination of}} several hazards simultaneously is common in diving, and the effect is generally increased risk to the diver, particularly where the occurrence of an incident due to one hazard triggers other hazards with a resulting cascade of incidents.

5|$|The words protein, polypeptide, and peptide are {{a little}} {{ambiguous}} and can overlap in meaning. Protein is generally {{used to refer to}} the complete biological molecule in a stable conformation, whereas peptide is generally reserved for a short amino acid oligomers often lacking a stable three-dimensional structure. However, the boundary between the two is not well defined and usually lies near 20–30 residues.
