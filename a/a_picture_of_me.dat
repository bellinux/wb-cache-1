2500|$|Clarkson {{has spoken}} highly of the Czech-made Škoda Yeti, calling it {{possibly}} the best {{car in the}} world, and used 20 minutes of a Top Gear episode putting the Yeti {{through a number of}} challenges to support his point. Clarkson called the Brera, Alfa's latest sports car, [...] "Cameron Diaz on wheels". Clarkson has expressed fondness for late-model V8 Holdens, available in the UK rebadged as Vauxhalls. Of the Monaro he said, [...] "It's like they had <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> on their desk and said [...] 'Let's build that bloke a car!'" [...] and [...] "I can't believe it... I've fallen in love... with a Vauxhall!" [...] Clarkson suffered two slipped discs that he attributed to driving the Monaro, which he described as being [...] "back-breakingly marvellous". Clarkson considers the Lexus LFA as the best car he has ever driven.|$|E

2500|$|On November 28, 2006, at a White House {{reception}} for those newly elected to Congress, Webb {{did not choose}} {{to wait in the}} line to have his picture taken with the president, whom Webb often criticized during the campaign. The president approached Webb later and asked him, [...] "How's your boy?", referring to Webb's son, a Marine serving in Iraq. Webb replied [...] "I'd like {{to get them out of}} Iraq, Mr. President." [...] Bush responded, [...] "That's not what I asked you. How's your boy?", Webb responded, [...] "That's between me and my boy, Mr. President."

2500|$|... "I {{spoke to}} Alex Ferguson and {{the deal was}} close to being done. I then went on holiday, and my agent at the time, Ambrose Mendy, said it wasn't worth me coming back to do a picture in a United shirt when the deal was completed, so I should do one before I left, {{and it would be}} {{released}} when the deal was announced. Lawrence Luster of the Daily Star took the picture and put in the library. Soon after, their sister paper, the Daily Express, were looking for <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> playing for West Ham, and found the one of me in the United shirt in the pile. They published it and all hell broke loose. [...] "I came back from holiday to discover West Ham fans were going mad. It wasn't really my fault.

2500|$|I {{remember}} Maurice Garin well. I met him {{and talked}} to him almost every day because {{we lived in the}} same area, 200m from each other, at Lens. Le Père Garin, as my father and grandfather called him used to bring out a chair in fine weather and sit {{in the doorway of the}} little office of the service station he owned at 116 rue de Lille in [...] Lens, under the sign for Antar fuel and oil. My barber was in the neighbouring house and I used to go there once a month to have a crew cut, [...] which was the fashion in those days. My friends and I were aged seven to ten and on our one-speed bikes we used to pin numbers on our back... and we never missed riding past Maurice Garin in a tight group so that he would see. It's strange that nobody thought to take <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>me,</b> the little kid, alongside the first great champion of the biggest race in the world. But life's like that.|$|E

In 1966, {{she joined the}} École normale de musique de Paris, which she left in 1970 for the Centre musical {{international}} of Annecy before the Tōhō Gakuen called her. She stayed there until 1974, when she joined the City of Basel Music Academy, while continuing her studies at the ENM in Paris and becoming the first woman named cello teacher (CNSM de Lyon). She ceased all teaching activities in 1995. That same year, she gave her last concerts in Japan, preferring to withdraw.

5000|$|The {{fact that}} Reddy was divorcing Jeff Wald, {{who had also}} been her manager since the late 1960s, {{and that they were}} in a custody dispute over their 10-year-old son became of greater {{interest}} to entertainment reporters.

I had gone to their photographer's studio to have pictures taken to accompany the story." [...] Later when she flew to New York for what was to be a promotional appearance on Good Morning America, the news of the divorce got out. [...] "While I was in the air, the latest edition of People magazine was hitting the stands.

Still, I'm sorry for all of you, especially those whom that flabby scoundrel Lane seems to be squeezing. He's been driving {{to and from the}} railroad a good deal of late, and it's curious that twice when I struck his trail two traveling photographers turned up soon after him.

60|$|But it was {{a strangely}} {{exhausting}} experience. I was inexpressibly relieved when it was over; when the tent-flap descended for the last time, and I could rest from my labours, puffed up, no doubt, with far too rich a conceit of myself, but immeasurably grateful and happy. Comparative quiet descended on the meadows. From a neighbouring tent broke shattering bursts of music, clapping and thumping, the fretful growling of the beasts, the elephant's trumpeting, the firing of guns, whoops, caterwauling, and the jangling of harness. The Grand Circus was in progress, and fantasy made <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> for <b>me</b> <b>of</b> every sound.|$|R
5000|$|Also in 2007, {{he signed}} to Curb Records, {{releasing}} his debut single [...] "She Ain't Right", which peaked at number 29 {{on the country}} chart.

All three songs were to have been included on <b>an</b> album entitled <b>Picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>Me,</b> which was never released. He continued to write songs for others, including Canadian singer Adam Gregory's singles [...] "Crazy Days" [...] and [...] "What It Takes". He appeared on Cledus T.

Besides, what on earth could Lady Underhill find to object to in me? I've plenty of money, and I'm {{one of the most}} charming and attractive of Society belles. You needn't take my word for that, and I don't suppose you've noticed it, but that's what Mr. Gossip in the Morning Mirror called me when he was writing about my getting engaged to Derek. My maid showed me the clipping. There was quite a long paragraph, with <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> that looked like a Zulu chieftainess taken in a coal-cellar during a bad fog. Well, after that, what could anyone say against me? I'm a perfect prize! I expect Lady Underhill screamed with joy when she heard the news and went singing all over her Riviera villa." ...|$|E
6000|$|So he gave Taffy the shark's tooth, and she {{lay down}} flat on her tummy with her legs in the air, like some people on the drawing-room floor {{when they want to}} draw pictures, and she said, 'Now I'll draw you some {{beautiful}} pictures! You can look over my shoulder, but you mustn't joggle. First I'll draw Daddy fishing. It isn't very like him; but Mummy will know, because I've drawn his spear all broken. Well, now I'll draw the other spear that he wants, the black-handled spear. It looks as if it was sticking in Daddy's back, but that's because the shark's tooth slipped and this piece of bark isn't big enough. That's the spear I want you to fetch; so I'll draw <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> myself 'splaining to you. My hair doesn't stand up like I've drawn, but it's easier to draw that way.

5000|$|... "Sainte ORLAN" [...] {{came from}} a {{character}} that I created for [...] "Le baiser de l'artiste" [...] from a text called [...] "Facing a society of mothers and merchants." [...] The first line of this text was: [...] "At {{the bottom of the}} cross were two women, Maria and Maria Magdalena." [...] These are two inevitable stereotypes of women that are hard to avoid: the mother and the prostitute. In [...] "Le baiser de l'artiste" [...] there were two faces. One was Saint ORLAN, <b>a</b> cutout <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> dressed as Madonna glued onto wood. One could buy a five francs church candle and I was sitting on the other side behind the mock-up of the vending machine. One could buy a French kiss from me for {{the same amount of money}} one could buy a candle. The idea was to play on the ambivalence of the woman figure and the desire of both men and women towards those biblical and social stereotypes. Being showcased in the Paris International Contemporary Art Fair, the artwork was somehow both an installation and a performance," [...] said ORLAN, in her interview with Acne Paper.|$|R
5000|$|The nightlight {{then goes}} on to {{proclaim}} its identity ("my name is 'blue canary;' one note, spelled 'L-I-T-E'"), and that it will always serve its intended purpose to the listener and their room. It references <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> in the room, probably a lighthouse ("There's <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> opposite <b>me</b> <b>of</b> my primitive ancestry, which stood on rocky shores and kept the beaches shipwreck-free"), and states that while it respects the job a lighthouse does, it would cause shipwrecks if it tried to serve as a lighthouse itself ("Though I respect that a lot, I'd be fired if that were my job, after killing Jason off and countless screaming Argonauts").

5000|$|In an {{interview}} for Digital Spy, Ellis-Bextor claimed she recorded four duets for the album, however, decided not to include any of them on request of her record label. Despite this, Dan Gillespie Sells provides backing vocals for two songs on the album, and Fred Schneider provides backing vocals on another. Originally, Ellis-Bextor claimed she would not appear on the album's cover, however, she later claimed that she had changed her mind. She commented, [...] "It's sparkly, but hopefully it's got a bit more depth than just <b>a</b> nice <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> on the cover!" [...] Ellis-Bextor worked on the album with someone she regarded as [...] "a French guy named Dimitri", who was rumoured to be Dimitri from Paris, but {{turned out to be}} Dimitri Tikovoi. She also worked on the album with her ex-band mate Kerin Smith, of theaudience. The opening line in [...] "If I Can't Dance" [...] is, according to Ellis-Bextor in {{an interview}} for The Times website, a famous quote by feminist anarchist Emma Goldman. She also revealed that she wrote around eighty songs for the album, and later admitted, [...] "That's how many demos exist. Overall, it's probably knocking on for triple figures I'd say." [...] She revealed that she had plans to release a song called [...] "Hype", which sampled Kraftwerk's [...] "The Model", but the record label denied her permission. Following its release in Australia, the album went to the top ten on the Australian iTunes pop albums chart and the top 40 on the main albums chart, but failed to chart on the ARIA Charts.|$|R

He would go to live with George and Margaret; their home would be his home, and he would always have both of them {{to take care of him}} and to make him happy in every possible way in which anybody could make him happy. In my mind's eye I could see him in the best room in the house, with all sorts of comforts and luxuries about him--our present comforts and luxuries would make a great show gathered together in one room; and then I saw Margaret and George standing at the open door, asking if there were anything he would like, and what they could do for him.
