30|$|Knowledge-aided space-time {{adaptive}} processing (KASTAP) {{using multiple}} coherent processing interval (CPI) radar data is described. The approach {{is based on}} forming earth-based clutter reflectivity maps to provide improved knowledge of clutter statistics in nonhomogeneous terrain environments. The maps are utilized to calculate predicted clutter covariance matrices {{as a function of}} range. Using a data set provided under the DARPA knowledge-aided sensor signal processing and expert reasoning (KASSPER) Program, predicted distributed clutter statistics are compared to measured statistics to verify the accuracy of the approach. Robust STAP weight vectors are calculated using a technique that combines covariance tapering, adaptive estimation of gain and phase corrections, knowledge-aided prewhitening, and eigenvalue rescaling. Techniques to suppress large discrete returns, expected in urban areas, are also described. Several performance metrics are presented, including signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) loss, target detections and false <b>alarms,</b> <b>receiver</b> operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and tracking performance. The results show more than an order of magnitude reduction in false alarm density when compared to standard STAP processing.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{a proposed}} methodology for using combinations of physical modeling of an inspection process along with laboratory and production data to estimate Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE) capability. The physical/statistical prediction model {{will be used}} to predict Probability of Detection (POD), Probability of False <b>Alarm</b> (PFA) and <b>Receiver</b> Operating Characteristic (ROC) function curves. These output functions are used to quantify the NDE capability. The particular focus of this work is on the use of ultrasonic methods for detecting hard-alpha and other subsurface flaws in titanium using gated peak detection. This is a uniquely challenging problem since the inspection must detect very complex subsurface flaws with significant “material” noise. However, the underlying framework of the methodology should be general enough to apply to other NDE methods...|$|R

30|$|Over-the-horizon radar (OTHR) {{exploits}} skywave {{propagation of}} high-frequency signals {{to detect and}} track targets, which {{are different from the}} conventional radar. It has received wide attention because of its wide area surveillance, long detection range, strong anti-stealth ability, the capability of the long early warning time, and so on. In OTHR, a significant problem is the effect of multipath propagation, which causes multiple detections via different propagation paths for a target with missed detections and false <b>alarms</b> at the <b>receiver</b> [1 – 6]. Nevertheless, the conventional tracking algorithms, such as probabilistic data association (PDA) [7 – 9], presume that a single-measurement per target, it may consider the other measurements of the same target as clutter, and multiple tracks are produced when a single target is present. Therefore, these methods cannot effectively solve the multipath propagation problem.|$|R
30|$|The match {{filtering}} based {{approach can}} deliver the optimal detection {{performance in the}} sense that it maximizes the received SNR. On the other hand, match filtering detection comes at the cost of demanding synchronization and high computational complexity. Additionally, note that both cyclostationary detection and matched filtering require prior knowledge of the transmitted signal at the receiver. Thus, in scenarios with lack of signal information both methods are not applicable anymore. In the case of unknown signal information so-called blind spectrum sensing techniques are needed to provide a spectral estimate. However, blind spectrum sensing techniques require proper noise power estimation in order to determine the spectrum occupancy [29]. Blind sensing techniques thus operate ideally in scenarios of stationary noise, whereas in practice [30] most of the noise turns out to be non-stationary (i.e., noise uncertainty). Furthermore, the non-stationary noise may lead to a SNR wall and high probability of false <b>alarm</b> at the <b>receiver</b> site [31, 32].|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{problem of}} {{detecting}} underwater targets from Electro-optical (EO) images is considered in this paper. A block-based log-likelihood ratio test {{has been developed}} for detection and segmentation of underwater mine-like objects in the EO images captured with a CCD-based image sensor. The main focus {{of this research is}} to develop a robust detection algorithm {{that can be used to}} detect low contrast and partial underwater objects from the EO imagery with low false alarm rate. The detection method involves identifying frames of interest (FOI) containing the potential targets. Once the FOI have been identified, regions of interest (ROI) within the FOI are segmented from the back-ground. Performance of the detection method is tested in terms of probability of detection, false <b>alarm</b> rate, and <b>receiver</b> operating characteristic (ROC) curves for FOI in the selected data runs. The algorithm shows promising results in target detection and generation of good silhouettes for subsequent classification.

40|$|A new {{generation}} of massive-scale sensor networks suitable {{for a range of}} commercial and military applications is brought forth by advances in MEMS (micro electro mechanical system technology).

40|$|International audienceinspection by {{non-destructive}} testing (NDT) techniques of existing structures {{is not perfect}} {{and it has become}} a common practice to model their reliability in terms of probability of detection (PoD), probability of false <b>alarms</b> (PFA) and <b>receiver</b> operating characteristic (ROC) curves. These results are generally the main inputs needed by owners of structures in order to achieve inspection, maintenance and repair plans (IMR). The assessment of PoD and PFA is even deduced from intercalibration of NDT tools or from the modelling of the noise and the signal. In this last case when the noise and the signal depend on the location on the structure PoD and PFA are spatially dependent. This paper presents how to define PoD and PFA when damage and detection are stochastic fields or spatially dependent. Corrosion of coastal structures in harbours is considered for illustration and ROC curves are deduced. Identification of probability density functions on polynomial chaos is shown to be more suitable than predefined probability distribution functions (pdf) in view of fitting noise and signal plus noise distributions...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} it is shown that cyclostationary {{spectrum}} sensing for Cognitive Radio networks, applying multiple cyclic frequencies for single user detection {{can be interpreted}} (with some assumptions) in terms of optimal incoherent diversity addition for “virtual diversity branches” or SIMO radar. This approach allows proposing, by analogy to diversity combining, suboptimal algorithms which can provide near optimal characteristics for the Neyman-Pearson Test (NPT) for single user detection. The analysis {{is based on the}} Generalized Gaussian (Klovsky-Middleton) Channel Model, which allows obtaining the NPT noise immunity characteristics: probability of misdetection error (PM) and probability of false <b>alarm</b> (Pfa) or <b>Receiver</b> Operational Characteristics (ROC) in the most general way. Some quasi-optimum algorithms such as energetic receiver and selection addition algorithm are analyzed and their comparison with the noise immunity properties (ROC) of the optimum approach is provided as well. Finally, the diversity combining approach is applied for the collaborative spectrum sensing and censoring. It is shown how the diversity addition principles are applied for distributed detection algorithms, called hereafter as SIMO radar or distributed SIMO radar, implementing Majority Addition (MA) approach and Weighted Majority Addition (WMA) principle...|$|R
40|$|The major {{advantages}} of pulse compression are low pulse-power {{which makes it}} suitable for solid-state devices, higher maximum range, good range resolution and better jamming immunity. The matched filter is the optimal linear filter for maximizing the {{signal to noise ratio}} (SNR) in the presence of additive stochastic noise. Pulse compression is an example of matched filtering. But this matched filter output consists of unwanted but unavoidable side lobes. For multiple-target radar, the side lobes of the compressed pulse must be considered in the system design because of the likelihood of false <b>alarms.</b> At the <b>receiver</b> the signal processor uses weighting filters which are not matched to the transmitted waveform. When this filter is not matched to the transmitted waveform then filter output consists of unwanted but unavoidable side lobes. In this paper a new technique is proposed to suppress the side lobes of radar signals that result from standard matched filtering. This technique produces better peak side lobe ratio than all other conventional side lobe reduction techniques. In simulation the results of this filter technique for compound Barker codes is compared with the other side lobe reduction techniques...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} {{demonstrates that}} tufted capuchin monkeys use terrestrial predator alarm {{calls in a}} functionally deceptive manner to distract conspecifics when feeding on contestable resources, although {{the success of this}} tactic is limited because listeners frequently ignore these calls when given in such situations. While this decreased response rate is suggestive of a counterstrategy to deception by receivers, the proximate factors underpinning the behavior are unclear. The current study aims to test if the decreased response rate to alarm calls in competitive contexts is better explained by the perception of subtle acoustic differences between predator-elicited and deceptive false <b>alarms,</b> or by <b>receivers</b> varying their responses based on {{the context in which the}} signal is received. This was tested by first examining the acoustic structure of predator-elicited and deceptive false alarms for any potentially perceptible acoustic differences, and second by comparing the responses of capuchins to playbacks of each of predator-elicited and false alarms, played back in noncompetitive contexts. The results indicate that deceptive false alarms and predator-elicited alarms show, at best, minimal acoustic differences based on the structural features measured. Likewise, playbacks of deceptive false alarms elicited antipredator reactions at the same rate as did predator-elicited alarms, although there was a nonsignificant tendency for false alarms to be more likely to elicit escape reactions.

40|$|Alarm {{calls are}} emitted by Richardson's ground {{squirrels}} Urocitellus richardsonii {{in response to}} avian and terrestrial predators. Conspecifics detecting these calls respond with increased vigilance, promoting predator detection and evasion, but in doing so, lose time from foraging. That loss can be minimized if alarm call recipients discriminate among signalers, and weight their response accordingly. For juvenile ground squirrels, we predicted that the trade-off between foraging and vigilance could be optimized via selective response to alarm calls emitted by their own dam, and/or neighboring colony members over calls broadcast by less familiar conspecifics. Alarm calls of adult female Richardson's ground squirrels were elicited in the field using a predator model and recorded on digital audio tape. Free-living focal juveniles were subjected to playbacks of a call of their mother, and on a separate occasion a call from either another adult female from their own colony, or an adult female from another colony. Neither immediate postural responses and escape behavior, nor the duration of vigilance manifested by juveniles differed with exposure to alarm calls of the three adult female signaler types. Thus, juveniles did not respond preferentially to alarm calls emitted by their mothers or colony members, likely reflecting {{the high cost of}} ignoring <b>alarm</b> signals where <b>receivers</b> have had limited opportunity to establish past signaler reliability [Current Zoology 58 (5) : 773 – 780, 2012]...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the many}} {{environmentally}} deleterious effects of industrialization is the acidification of freshwater, which results in part from precipitative inputs of anthropogenic pollutants. Considerable effort has been allocated to the study and remediation of severely acidified aquatic systems, {{with the effects of}} weak levels of acidification (pH 6 – pH 7) on biological communities having received less attention. One effect that has been studied is the chemical mediation of predator-prey interactions in freshwater and marine fishes. Following mechanical damage to the epidermis, as would likely occur during a predation event, many taxa release chemical alarm cues which elicit antipredator responses from conspecifics and other opportunistic receivers subject to similar levels of predation risk and potentially enhance the survival of <b>alarm</b> cue <b>receivers</b> during subsequent interactions with predators. Under weakly acidic conditions (pH < 6. 6), these chemical alarm cues are rendered non-functional and do not elicit alarm responses from conspecific or heterospecific receivers. Weak acidification effectively deprives prey fishes of one source of chemosensory information on ambient risk levels. 	Here, I describe a series of field experiments designed to evaluate the effects of this environmentally-mediated loss of information on wild populations of juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in four acidic and five neutral streams in the Miramichi River system, New Brunswick, Canada. Acid-impacted Atlantic salmon in these experiments demonstrated a loss of response to conspecific and heterospecific chemical alarm cues, as well as significantly greater responses to remaining (visual) threat cues than salmon under neutral conditions. Fish in neutral streams appeared to demonstrate additive responses to multiple risky cues consistent with dynamic threat-sensitivity and the sensory complementation hypothesis, whereas fish in acidic streams demonstrated non-threat-sensitive responses consistent with the absence of sensory complementation and greater value being assigned to information received through visual cues. Contrary to predictions, juvenile salmon do not appear to suffer increased mortality through predation {{as a result of this}} loss of information, nor do they experience negative growth effects resulting from temporal trade-offs between antipredator and foraging behaviours. Rather, acid-impacted Atlantic salmon demonstrated behavioural compensation through increased preference for complex habitats which offer greater abundance of physical refugia and limit line-of-sight for visually foraging predators, effectively mitigating the increased risk of predation associated with limited information. ...|$|R
