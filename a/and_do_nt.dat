40|$|The {{possible}} {{involvement of}} endogenous vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), cholecystokinin (CCK) and neurotensin (NT) {{in the control}} of thymocyte proliferation has been investigated in vivo in the immature rat. For this task, we have studied {{the effects of the}} administration of selective antagonists of the receptors of the three neuropeptides on the mitotic index (% of metaphase-arrested cells after vincristin injection) of thymocytes. Both CCK- and TN-receptor antagonists were ineffective. In contrast, two VIP receptor antagonists (VIP-As) enhanced the mitotic index of thymocytes. VIP reversed the effect of VIP-As, but when administered alone it did not alter the mitotic activity of thymocytes. In light of these findings, we conclude that endogenous VIP exerts a maximal tonic inhibitory influence on the basal proliferative activity of rat thymocytes, while endogenous CCK <b>and</b> <b>NT</b> <b>do</b> not play a relevant modulatory role in this process...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to assess the ability of three methods, {{alkaline}} elution (AE), nick translation (NT), and single-cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE), to detect DNA single-strand breaks (ssb) in human peripheral blood lymphocytes (HPBL) exposed in vitro to three genotoxic agents: -rays, ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) and benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide (BPDE). The ultimate objective is to select the most feasible, sensitive, and reproducible method for the monitoring of populations exposed to genotoxic agents. AE <b>and</b> <b>NT</b> <b>do</b> not seem suitable assays. AE is able to detect DNA lesions induced by the three compounds, but only at relatively high doses (2 Gy, 5 mM EMS and 20 μM BPDE). With NT, DNA alterations induced by γ-rays are not detected and ssb are only evidenced after exposure to EMS (80 mM), which already alters the viability of the lymphocytes. Nick translation is able to detect ssb induced by 10 μM BPDE. Compared to the other assays, the sensitivity of the SCGE assay is significantly higher since statistically significant changes were detected after incubation with 0. 5 mM EMS and 1. 25 μM BDPE. SCGE is a relatively simple method, not time-consuming and applicable to a large number of samples per working day. In conclusion, on the basis of the results of this in vitro comparison, SCGE seems a promising method for the monitoring of populations exposed to genotoxic chemicals.

Neurite outgrowth from explants of 8 -d chick embryo dorsal root ganglia was achieved at very low NGF concentrations with heart conditioned medium during overnight culture. Quickly incrasing the NGF concentration in the growth medium dramatically affected GC and neurite morphology: the majority of GCs and neurites collapsed and retracted towards the cell body over a course of approximately 2 - 5 min. Retraction was elicited by increasing NGF levels from 0 to 0. 05 ng/ml to as little as 0. 5 ng/ml but did not occur if the NGF concentration during the initial overnight culture period exceeded 0. 8 ng/ml, regardless of how much the concentration was elevated. Similar concentration changes of cytochrome c or insulin <b>did</b> <b>nt</b> result in retraction. Neurites that had been separated from their cell bodies by cutting close to their exit from the explant still retracted when NGF levels were raised.

The aim of this study was to evaluate different forms of aluminum in a Oxisol in an experiment conducted by IAPAR (Southwest of Paraná) for 23 years. In the region, which was originally covered by Atlantic Forest, two systems of tillage (no-tillage (NT) and Conventional Planting System (CPS) were employed using the cultivation of six different species of winter plants (lupine blue, hairy vetch, black oats, turnip, wheat and fallow) in sequence to soybean and corn in the summer. In October 2009, there was the collection of soil samples at five different depths (0 - 5, 5 - 10, 10 - 20, 20 - 30 and 30 - 40 cm). The forms of aluminum present in the soil were determined using various extractants: ammonium oxalate and 0. 2 M sodium dithionite, sodium bicarbonate, for forms of aluminum present in the mineral fraction of soil; 1 M potassium chloride, for the exchangeable form of aluminum in the soil, copper chloride 0. 5 M lanthanum chloride and 0. 33 M for the aluminum complexed forms of the active sites of soil organic matter (MOS), and 0. 1 M sodium pyrophosphate. Three different methods were used for determining the aluminum content in the extracts: titration with 0. 0125 M NaOH followed by back titration, atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) and fluoride ion selective electrode (ESIF) *, and the three methods have presented limitations.

40|$|The thesis {{examines}} {{the use of}} Ps 62 : 13 (61 : 13 LXX) {{in the context of}} judgement according to works in early Jewish literature and the NT.   The objective of this thesis is to challenge the majority view about the theme of judgement according to works in early Judaism and the NT.   According to this view, the literature of early Judaism <b>and</b> the <b>NT</b> <b>does</b> not use any particular OT passage(s) when they refer to the idea of divine judgement according to works:  they draw on a theological conviction which is rooted in the OT or simply use expressions or concepts from the OT.   However, we argue that most of the passages under investigation allude to Ps 62 : 13 (Ψ 61 : 13) and the whole body of the psalm.   Accordingly, this study argues that the references to judgement according to works in the passages studied here are to be understood as scriptural interpretation, interpretation of Ps 62 (61 LXX) in particular. In part 1 (‘Prolegomena’), we begin by establishing the need for and significance of our study.   We look into two areas in which Ps 62 has not received sufficient treatment:  studies on judgement according to works and similar topics, and studies {{on the use of the}} OT in the NT.   Also, the present thesis highlights the significance of the topic ‘judgement according to works’ in Pauline scholarship, especially in the light of the challenge by the New Perspective.   After starting the limitations of our study, we employ two tools to examine the use of Ps 62 : 13 in the context of judgement accordingly to works:  intertextuality, and Jewish mediation of scripture.   In addition, this study uses five criteria to determine the presence of Ps 62 : 13 in later writings.   Then, Chapter 1 {{examines the}} Hebrew text of P 2 62 and its Greek translation (Ψ 61), focusing on the major themes. Part 2 (chapters 2 - 7) looks into the use of Ps 62 : 13 (61 : 13 LXX) in early Jewish literature up to the end of the first century BC.   We deal with five works from the Second Temple period:  Sirach, 1 Enoch, Apostrophe to Zion (11 Q 5 22 : 1 - 15), Psalms of Soloman and Pseudo-Philo’s LAB.

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of prolonged application time of primers on the marginal adaption after extended times for demineralising enamel or dentin surfaces with phosphoric acid. Additionally, the influence of thermocycling procedures was investigated. 144 human caries free premolars were subjected to 576 marginal adaption examinations. Standardized class V cavities were prepared into caries-free human premolars. All cavities were conditioned by phosphoric acid for either 15 s, 30 s or 60 s, rewetted and then treated with one of the following etch & rinse adhesives OptiBond FL, Prime&Bond NT, Excite by applying the primer for either 30 s or 60 s. The composite resin Filtek Z 250 was incrementally placed in the cavities. After polishing the samples were stored in water for 21 days and then thermocycled (2000 cycles between 5 °C and 55 °C, exposure time 30 s). Before and after the thermocycling procedure replica were taken for the margin analysis in the SEM at a magnification of 200 x using defined criteria. Statistical evaluation of the quantitative margin analysis using SPSS for enamel showed neither significant differences between the different primer application periods nor between the different etching times regarding “margin quality 1 ”. Analysis of dentin obtained the following results: Excite showed significantly better results when the primer was applied for 60 s compared to the results for 30 s. OptiBond FL <b>and</b> Prime&Bond <b>NT</b> <b>did</b> not show any significant differences in marginal adaptation regardless of the phosphoric acid etching and priming times.

The results showed, that a combination of 15 s phosphoric acid etching and 30 s of priming is sufficient for all tested adhesives in enamel. Extended priming time did not improve the marginal adaption, even if enamel is conditioned up to 60 s. For dentin the sufficient priming time depended on the adhesive system used. For Excite a prolonged priming time for 60 s improved the margin quality after phosphoric acid etching for 15 s and 30 s.

In total eleven dummy tests were conducted in the three collision angles, while film and instrument data were generated and compared with those of PMHS data from Törnvall (2008). For the 45 ° far-side impact, the THOR SD- 1 NT dummy retained the shoulder belt on the shoulder during on-loading, as did the PMHSs, whereas the THOR <b>NT</b> <b>did</b> not. In the 30 ° near-side impact...|$|R

They advocated broad coalitions of oppressed groups, and ushered {{in an era of}} 'identity politics'. (Indeed, much of Hall's subsequent work was concerned with questions of identity.) NT repudiated the project of abolishing capitalism, ascribing the failure of Bolshevism to 'voluntarism.' NT held instead to a decidedly reformist project: the left should adapt to the world, rather than seeking to change it.|$|R
40|$|AbstractExpanded CAG {{diseases}} are progressive neurodegenerative disorders in which specific proteins have an unusually long polyglutamine stretch. Although these proteins share no other sequence or structural homologies, they all aggregate into intracellular inclusions that {{are believed to}} be pathological. We sought to determine what impact the position and number of glutamines have on the structure and aggregation of the host protein, apomyoglobin. Variable-length polyQ tracts were inserted either into the loop between the C- and D-helices (QnCD) or at the N-terminus (QnNT). The QnCD mutants lost some α-helix and gained unordered and/or β-sheet in a length-dependent manner. These mutants were partially unfolded and rapidly assembled into soluble chain-like oligomers. In sharp contrast, the QnNT mutants largely retained wild-type tertiary structure but associated into long, fibrillar aggregates. Control proteins with glycine-serine repeats (GS 8 CD and GS 8 NT) were produced. GS 8 CD exhibited similar structural perturbations and aggregation characteristics to an analogously sized Q 16 CD, indicating that the observed effects are independent of amino acid composition. In contrast to Q 16 NT, GS 8 <b>NT</b> <b>did</b> not form fibrillar aggregates. Thus, soluble oligomers are produced through structural perturbation <b>and</b> <b>do</b> not require polyQ, whereas classic fibrils arise from specific polyQ intermolecular interactions in the absence of misfolding...|$|R

40|$|Background—Reports demonstrating {{sympathetic}} hyperactivity in hypertension {{with the}} use of microneurography have been inconsistent. One possible reason is that previous studies have assessed muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) from integrated voltage waves (“bursts”) recorded from multiunit discharges. We studied single units with defined vasoconstrictor properties (s-MSNA) to further characterize sympathetic output in hypertensive disease. Methods and Results—We examined 74 subjects {{with a wide range of}} arterial blood pressure that were considered to be either normal (NT), high normal (HN), or stages 1 to 3 essential hypertension (EHT- 1, EHT- 2 / 3). All had their peripheral sympathetic activity measured from both multiunit bursts and single-unit vasoconstrictor impulses. There was a significant correlation between s-MSNA and MSNA, and results of variability studies were similar. The EHT- 1 and EHT- 2 / 3 groups had greater s-MSNA <b>and</b> MSNA than <b>did</b> the matched <b>NT</b> group (always P, 0. 01). The HN group als...|$|R
