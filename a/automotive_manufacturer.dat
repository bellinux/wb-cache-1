25|$|By 1961, British {{specialist}} teams such as Lotus, Cooper and BRM, {{and later}} McLaren, Tyrrell and Williams- organizations created purely for producing, developing and competing purpose-built open-wheel racing cars had overtaken the industrial manufacturing powers such as Ferrari, Mercedes, Maserati and Alfa Romeo. The only major <b>automotive</b> <b>manufacturer</b> {{with a full}} works effort was Ferrari- which was really a manufacturer that made road cars to fund its racing in F1 and endurance racing. Whereas the big continental manufacturers, with lots of money to spend built the whole car including the drivetrain systems themselves, (excluding BRM), the British teams, with only limited amounts of money only built their chassis; they bought their engines and gearboxes from independent manufacturers such as Coventry-Climax and later Ford/Cosworth engines, and Hewland gearboxes. The only British team that was also a manufacturer of road cars like Ferrari was Lotus; but even so that company grew considerably but never {{to the size of}} Mercedes or Alfa Romeo. From 1957 to 1961, Formula One had transformed from a scattershot industrial manufacturer sideshow of technology to a seriously competitive business for team owners and engineers wanting to come up with new technologies to out-do the opposition and also to sell their technology to big manufacturers or other interested parties. People like Cooper and Lotus founders John Cooper and Colin Chapman proved that competitiveness and developing new automotive technology was about fresh thinking, not industrial might. These British teams were regularly beating manufacturer teams like Ferrari, whom company founder Enzo Ferrari referring to these new British teams as garagistes- Italian for garage teams- which is effectively how all these British teams operated- their cars were built in small sheds or garages.|$|E

40|$|Although recent {{worldwide}} {{sales figures}} of the major German <b>automotive</b> <b>manufacturers</b> (Volkswagen, Daimler, BMW) are excellent, the European sales level has not been recovered post to the crisis (Statista 2015 a and ICCT 2014). Multiple reasons are responsible for this sluggish recovery. The most significant factors are the continuously decreasing levels of real income, changes of mindset, the emerging importance of sustainability, the compliance with the increasingly stringent emission rules set by governments of developed countries, and the increasing costs of vehicle ownership run by internal combustion engine. German <b>automotive</b> <b>manufacturers</b> have seen the modifications of the market environment. Hence, {{they have tried to}} find the appropriate response by both introducing electric vehicles (EVs) and services that specifically target the younger generations. The main goal of this case study is to analyze how and why German <b>automotive</b> <b>manufacturers</b> and their competitors, e. g., the German railway company, respond to these challenges by extending their value chains and how they attempt to transform from classical <b>automotive</b> <b>manufacturers</b> to mobility providers...|$|R
