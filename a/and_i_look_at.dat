[...] Furthermore, the site noted that [...] "the sound that takes you by surprise may be your own crying." [...] Novelist Lev Grossman, {{in an interview with}} NPR, praised the backstory of the Ice King and the exploration of his condition, noting that his origin is [...] "psychologically plausible." [...] Grossman praised {{the way the}} series was able to tackle the issues of mental illness, saying: [...] "It's very affecting. My dad has been going through having Alzheimer's, and he's forgotten so much about who he used to be. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him and think this cartoon is about my father dying." ...|$|E
500|$|I {{remember}} {{not just}} because it was a win, but also because it was a big fight right into the last night. Fabrizia reminded me the other night that we had a problem with the brake pads, so we lost a lot of time. We finished three days rallying (with one day to go), night and day, 32 seconds in front of Ari Vatanen. We drove the last special stage for the night, came back to the hotel and I could not sleep at all, four hours {{in front of me and}} no sleep. Then I arrive at the special stage, it's about 42km long, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> Fabrizia and I said [...] "OK, we forget everything, and we are at the first stage of the rally again, because one of us will crash." [...] And so Ari hit a rock, and we won the rally.|$|E
2500|$|The jazz {{pianist and}} {{educator}} Kenny Barron commented, [...] "I have every record [...] ever made—and I try never {{to listen to}} them ... If I did, I'd throw up my hands and give up!" [...] Jean Cocteau dubbed Tatum [...] "a crazed Chopin". Count Basie called him the eighth wonder of the world. [...] Dave Brubeck observed, [...] "I don't think there's any more chance of another Tatum turning up than another Mozart." [...] Pianist Mulgrew Miller, commented on personal growth by saying, [...] "When I talk to the people I admire, they're always talking about continuous growth and development <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> them and say, 'Well... what are YOU going to do?' But, as Harold Mabern says, 'There's always Art Tatum records around'". Dizzy Gillespie said, [...] "First you speak of Art Tatum, then take a long deep breath, and you speak of the other pianists." ...|$|E

2500|$|In an October 2007 {{preliminary}} hearing {{for the case}} of Dr. Maurice Wolin, Dr. Wolin's attorney Blair Berk argued that Perverted Justice's founder has a financial incentive to badger suspects. Von Erck testified in the hearing that he is paid an annual salary of $120,000 stemming from Perverted Justice's deal with NBC. Said Berk, [...] "Xavier Von Erck had a problem. He had a television show to get on and a fancy cancer doctor to ensnare in his web, and he wouldn't let it go." [...] The prosecutor in the case, Brian Staebell, stated, [...] "The whole business of this {{preliminary hearing}} has been {{an attack on the}} Petaluma Police Department and Perverted Justice. But every time I go back to the chats <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> how he was grooming this 13-year-old girl." [...] After the hearing, Judge Raima Ballinger held Wolin over for trial, ruling that there was sufficient cause to believe Wolin committed the crime.|$|E

Ah, well, ours is a lordly history, and though we may be doomed to pass, in our time we shall have trod on the faces of all peoples, disciplined them to obedience, taught them government, and dwelt in the palaces we have compelled them by the weight of our own right arms to build for us.|$|E
60|$|I go up into my {{own little}} attic. My cot stands in the corner, and my bricks lie tumbled out upon the floor (I was always an untidy child). An old man enters--an old, bent, {{withered}} man--holding a lamp above his head, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> his face, {{and it is my}} own face. And another enters, and he also is myself. Then more and more, till the room is thronged with faces, and the stair-way beyond, and all the silent house. Some of the faces are old and others young, and some are fair and smile at me, and many are foul and leer at me. And every face is my own face, but no two of them are alike.|$|E
6000|$|There is a pile {{of these}} arrears very soon, and it swells like a rolling snowball. The bigger it gets, the more stupid I get. The case is so hopeless, and I feel that I am wallowing in such a bog of nonsense, that I give up all idea of getting out, and abandon myself to my fate. The despairing way in which my mother <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> each other, as I blunder on, is truly melancholy. But the {{greatest}} effect in these miserable lessons is when my mother (thinking nobody is observing her) tries {{to give me the}} cue by the motion of her lips. At that instant, Miss Murdstone, who has been lying in wait for nothing else all along, says in a deep warning voice: ...|$|E

6000|$|I {{think it}} most admirable.[44] Full of character, strong in interest, rich in capital situations, and certain to go nobly. You know how highly I thought of [...] "Money," [...] but I {{sincerely}} think these three acts finer. I {{did not think}} of the slight suggestions you make, but I said, en passant, that perhaps the drunken scene might do better on the stage a little concentrated. I don't believe it would require even that, with the leading-up which you propose. I cannot say too much of the comedy to express what I think and feel concerning it; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it, too, remember, with the yellow eye of an actor! I should have taken to it (need I say so!) con amore in any case, but I should have been jealous of your reputation, exactly as I appreciate your generosity. If I had a misgiving of ten lines I should have scrupulously mentioned it.|$|E
60|$|Hence I look at {{individual}} differences, though of small {{interest to the}} systematist, as of the highest importance for us, as being the first step towards such slight varieties as are barely thought worth recording in works on natural history. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> varieties which are in any degree more distinct and permanent, as steps toward more strongly marked and permanent varieties; and at the latter, as leading to sub-species, and then to species. The passage from one stage of difference to another may, in many cases, be the simple result {{of the nature of}} the organism and of the different physical conditions to which it has long been exposed; but with respect to the more important and adaptive characters, the passage from one stage of difference to another may be safely attributed to the cumulative action of natural selection, hereafter to be explained, and to the effects of the increased use or disuse of parts. A well-marked variety may therefore be called an incipient species; but whether this belief is justifiable must be judged by the weight of the various facts and considerations to be given throughout this work.|$|E

Hence I believe a well-marked variety may be justly called an incipient species; but whether this belief be justifiable must be judged of by the general weight of the several facts and views given throughout this work.|$|E

6000|$|The {{security}} of the British monarchy lies in such a courageous severance of its destinies from the Teutonic dynastic system. Will it make that severance? There I share an almost universal ignorance. The loyalty of the British is not to what kings are too prone to call [...] "my person," [...] not to a chosen and admired family, but to a renascent mankind. We have fought in this war for Belgium, for France, for general freedom, for civilization and the whole future of mankind, far more than for ourselves. We have not fought for a king. We are discovering in that spirit of human unity that lies below {{the idea of a}} League of Free Nations the real invisible king of our heart and race. But we will very gladly go on with our task under a nominal king unless he hampers us in the task that grows ever more plainly before us. ... That, I think, is a fair statement of British public opinion on this question. But every day when I am in London I walk past Buckingham Palace to lunch at my club, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> that not very expressive façade and wonder--and we all wonder--what thoughts are going on behind it and what acts are being conceived there. Out of it there might yet come some gesture of acceptance magnificent enough to set beside President Wilson's magnificent declaration of war. ...|$|E
6000|$|A poor devil {{of a man}} is most lucky when, loving, he is loved. Grievous indeed must be {{the fate}} of the lover who is unloved. And I, for one, and for still other reasons, congratulate myself upon the vastitude of my good fortune. For see, were Margaret any other sort of a woman, were she [...] . well, just the lovely and lovable and adorably snuggly sort who seem made just {{precisely}} for love and loving and nestling into the strong arms of a man--why, there wouldn't be anything remarkable or wonderful about her loving me. But Margaret is Margaret, strong, self-possessed, serene, controlled, a very mistress of herself. And there's the miracle--that such a woman should have been awakened to love by me. It is almost unbelievable. I go {{out of my way to}} get another peep into those long, cool, gray eyes of hers and see them grow melting soft as she looks at me. She is no Juliet, thank the Lord; and thank the Lord I am no Romeo. And yet I go up alone on the freezing poop, and under my breath chant defiantly at the snorting gale, and at the graybeards thundering down on us, that I am a lover. And I send messages to the lonely albatrosses veering through the murk that I am a lover. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the wretched sailors crawling along the spray-swept bridge and know that never in ten thousand wretched lives could they experience the love I experience, and I wonder why God ever made them.|$|E
6000|$|I {{have now}} {{described}} that belief in magic which has set me all but unwilling among those lean and fierce minds {{who are at}} war with their time, who cannot accept the days as they pass, simply and gladly; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> what I have written with some alarm, for I have told more of the ancient secret than many among my fellow-students think it right to tell. I {{have come to believe}} so many strange things because of experience, that I see little reason to doubt the truth of many things that are beyond my experience; {{and it may be that}} there are beings who watch over that ancient secret, as all tradition affirms, and resent, and perhaps avenge, too fluent speech. They say in the Aran Islands that if you speak overmuch of the things of Faery your tongue becomes like a stone, and it seems to me, though doubtless naturalistic reason would call it Auto-suggestion or the like, that I have often felt my tongue become just so heavy and clumsy. More than once, too, as I wrote this very essay I have become uneasy, and have torn up some paragraph, not for any literary reason, but because some incident or some symbol that would perhaps have meant nothing to the reader, seemed, I know not why, to belong to hidden things. Yet I must write or be of no account to any cause, good or evil; I must commit what merchandise of wisdom I have to this ship of written speech, and after all, I have many a time watched it put out to sea with not less alarm when all the speech was rhyme. We who write, we who bear witness, must often hear our hearts cry out against us, complaining because of their hidden things, and I know not but he who speaks of wisdom may not sometimes in the change that is coming upon the world, have to fear the anger of the people of Faery, whose country is the heart of the world--'The Land of the Living Heart.' Who can keep always to the little pathway between speech and silence, where one meets none but discreet revelations? And surely, at whatever risk, we must cry out that imagination is always seeking to remake the world according to the impulses and the patterns in that great Mind, and that great Memory? Can there be anything so important as to cry out that what we call romance, poetry, intellectual beauty, is the only signal that the supreme Enchanter, or some one in His councils, is speaking of what has been, and shall be again, in the consummation of time? ...|$|E
