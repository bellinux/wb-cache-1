5|$|Upon completion, {{the team}} felt that Alien Crossfire was somewhere between an {{expansion}} and a full-blown sequel. In {{the months leading}} {{to the release of}} Alien Crossfire, multimedia producer Michael Ely wrote the 9episodes of Centauri: Arrival, introducing the Alien Crossfire factions. The game initially had a single production run. Electronic Arts bundled Alpha Centauri <b>and</b> <b>Alien</b> Crossfire in the Alpha Centauri Planetary Pack in 2000 and included both games in The Laptop Collection in 2003. In 2000, both Alpha Centauri <b>and</b> <b>Alien</b> Crossfire were ported to Classic Mac OS by Aspyr Media and to Linux by Loki Software.|$|E
5|$|Alien {{has been}} {{released}} in many home video formats and packages over the years. The first of these was a seventeen-minute Super-8 version for home projectionists. It was also released on both VHS and Betamax for rental, which grossed it an additional $40,300,000 in the United States alone. Several VHS releases were subsequently issued both separately and as boxed sets. LaserDisc and Videodisc versions followed, including deleted scenes and director commentary as bonus features. A VHS box set containing Alien and its sequels Aliens <b>and</b> <b>Alien</b> 3 was released in facehugger-shaped boxes, and included some of the deleted scenes from the Laserdisc editions. When Alien Resurrection premiered in theaters, another set {{of the first three}} films was released including a Making of Alien Resurrection tape. A few months later the set was re-released with the full version of Alien Resurrection taking the place of the making-of video. Alien was released on DVD in 1999, both separately and, as The Alien Legacy, packaged with Aliens, Alien 3 <b>and</b> <b>Alien</b> Resurrection. This set, which was also released in a VHS version, included a commentary track by Ridley Scott. The first three films of the series have also been packaged as the Alien Triple Pack.|$|E

5|$|New {{gameplay}} features distinguish Shadow the Hedgehog {{from previous}} Sonic games. For example, Shadow can use guns to combat enemies, adding {{an element of}} third-person shooter gameplay. Parts of the scenery, such as traffic signs, {{can also be used}} as weapons. Another new feature is the ability to drive vehicles, such as motorcycles <b>and</b> <b>alien</b> aircraft. Although Shadow can outrun the game's vehicles, the latter have unique capabilities, such as crushing enemies and traversing otherwise impassible acid-covered areas.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} flip-screen and isometric gameplay, {{in similar}} vein to its predecessors, Knight Lore <b>and</b> <b>Alien</b> 8.

5|$|The {{player is}} {{required}} to build an environment that will attract patients with comical diseases and then treat them while tending to their needs. The game has a somewhat dark sense of humour, {{similar to that of}} its predecessor, Theme Park. Diseases include Bloaty Head (which swells the patient's head), King Complex (which forces the patient to impersonate Elvis Presley), <b>and</b> <b>Alien</b> DNA (which transforms the patient into an alien).|$|E
5|$|The team {{considered}} several ideas, {{including a}} return to a post-apocalyptic earth and the conquest of another planet in the Alpha Centauri system, before deciding to keep the new title on Planet. The premise allowed them to mix and match old and new characters and delve into the mysteries of the monoliths <b>and</b> <b>alien</b> artifacts. The backstory evolved quickly, and the main conflict centered on the return of the original alien inhabitants. The idea of humans inadvertently caught up in an off-world civil war focused the story.|$|E
5|$|Although initial {{box office}} {{reception}} was positive {{both in the}} United Kingdom and overseas, Inseminoid has since failed to impress a majority of critics, who have faulted Warren's film for perceived poor acting, special effects and set design. Despite praise for actress Judy Geeson's depiction of the lead character, Sandy, approval of the film in general has been tarnished due to its concept of an extraterrestrial insemination, which has been viewed negatively {{in comparison to the}} premise of Alien (1979). Both Warren <b>and</b> <b>Alien</b> distributors 20th Century Fox have rejected claims that the script of Inseminoid was influenced by that of the earlier film.|$|E

Archer demands that Daniels should never visit or bother Enterprise again. With their mission completed, Enterprise finally arrives back in its proper time period, where the crew are welcomed and escorted by an entire squadron of Starfleet <b>and</b> <b>alien</b> vessels.|$|E
5|$|Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary and the original, , are {{identical}} in gameplay and plot.

5|$|Jeunet hired French {{special effects}} {{supervisor}} Pitof and cinematographer Darius Khondji, {{both of whom}} he had worked with on The City of Lost Children. Jeunet and his crew watched the latest science fiction <b>and</b> <b>Alien</b> films as reference material, and obtained production reports from the Alien films to study the camera setups. Jeunet was given creative control, contributing several elements to the script including five different endings, although the expensive ones were dismissed. He also opted to make the film a dark comedy and was encouraged to include more violence. In June 1996, Jeunet's frequent co-director, conceptual artist Marc Caro had drawn rough sketches of characters' costumes, which were shown to veteran costume designer Bob Ringwood. Ringwood made several modifications for the final design.|$|E
