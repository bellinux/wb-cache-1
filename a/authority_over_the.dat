5|$|Before he died, López Salcedo {{appointed}} contador Andrés de Cerezeda as his successor. Cerezada {{was unable}} to impose his <b>authority</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> residents of Trujillo, with two rival claimants struggling for power. Vasco de Herrera {{was supported by the}} town council, and was strong enough to force Cerezeda to agree to a power-sharing compromise. In reality, it was Vasco de Herrera who wielded true <b>authority</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> province.|$|E

5|$|Hall {{initially}} {{sought to}} appeal to the State Council of the LCL. Although the body had no binding <b>authority</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> parliamentary caucus, which chose the leader, Hall and his followers saw it as an opportunity for a media victory. The motion went narrowly against Hall, but it generated much attention and potential embarrassment for the conservatives.|$|E
5|$|Hermann Göring {{founded the}} Gestapo in 1933 as a Prussian police force. When Göring {{transferred}} full <b>authority</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Gestapo to Himmler in April 1934, it immediately became {{an instrument of}} terror under the SS's purview. Himmler named Heydrich to head the Gestapo on 22 April 1934. On 9 June 1934, Rudolph Hess declared the SD the official Nazi intelligence service.|$|E
5|$|Llywelyn the Great {{initially}} {{controlled the}} princedom of Gwynedd, but grew more powerful {{over the course}} of his reign, extending his influence over much of Wales during the early years of the 13th century.

5|$|Rædwald's power became great {{enough for}} Bede to {{recognise}} {{him as the}} successor to the imperium of Æthelberht. Bede also called him Rex Anglorum, the 'King of the Angles', a term that Rædwald's contemporaries would have used for their overlord. It is unclear where his power was centred or even how he established his <b>authority</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Angles of eastern England.|$|E

5|$|There is some {{confusion}} {{as to who}} actually produced The Velvet Underground & Nico. Although Andy Warhol was the only formally credited producer, he had very little direct influence or <b>authority</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> album beyond paying for the recording sessions.

5|$|With {{the central}} {{government}} collapsing in <b>authority</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> various regions of the empire, it was recorded in 845 that bandits and river pirates in parties of 100 or more began plundering settlements along the Yangtze River with little resistance.

5|$|A series frontiersmen {{assemblies}} {{were held}} {{over several years}} across the Willamette Valley, with many on the French Prairie at Champoeg. The death of prominent settler Ewing Young on 9 February 1841, who left neither a will or had an heir in Oregon Country, left the future of his property uncertain. Jason Lee chaired the first meeting organised {{to discuss the matter}} on the 17th. He proposed the creation of an <b>authority</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> pioneers centered on a governor. French-Canadian settlers blocked the measure and instead a probate judge and a few other positions were appointed.|$|E
5|$|A {{side effect}} of Baldwin's tour of Wales was the implied {{assertion}} of royal authority in a section of Henry's domains that had always been somewhat fractious. Baldwin was also asserting his ecclesiastical <b>authority</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Welsh bishops, especially when he {{made a point of}} celebrating mass at every Welsh cathedral; he was the first Archbishop of Canterbury to celebrate mass at St Asaph's Cathedral. Baldwin excommunicated the only Welsh prince who refused to appear before him and take the cross, Owain Cyfeiliog.|$|E

5|$|According to {{historian}} John V. A. Fine, Shishman {{may have}} established his <b>authority</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Vidin region {{as early as}} the 1270s, after the death of the previous lord of that area, Jacob Svetoslav. He was perhaps elevated to the position of despot of Vidin soon after the accession of another Bulgarian noble of Cuman origin, George Terter I (r. 1280–1292), to the Bulgarian throne in 1280. Shishman was likely a close relative, perhaps even a brother, of George Terter I.|$|E
5|$|After being {{promoted}} to colonel on 2 December 1839, Luís Alves {{was sent by}} the Reactionary cabinet to the province of Maranhão to quell a rebellion which {{became known as the}} Balaiada.

5|$|After the Norman Conquest, Gisa {{supported}} William, the {{new king}} of England. He helped consecrate Lanfranc as Archbishop of Canterbury in 1070, and attended the Council of Windsor in 1072 and the Council of London in 1075. At a later church council, Giso asserted his <b>authority</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> abbots of Muchelney and Athelney, {{but failed to}} uphold the same claim in regards to Thurstan, Abbot of Glastonbury. Previously, he was credited {{as the author of}} Historiola de primordiis episcopatus Somersetensis, a history of the bishops of Wells, but he is no longer considered the author of that work.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, Barre's regime had become {{increasingly}} unpopular. The authorities became ever more totalitarian, and resistance movements, encouraged by Ethiopia's communist Derg administration, sprang {{up across the}} country. This eventually led in 1991 to {{the outbreak of the}} civil war, the toppling of Barre's government, and the disbandment of the Somali National Army. Many of the opposition groups subsequently began competing for influence in the power vacuum that followed the ouster of Barre's regime. Armed factions led by United Somali Congress commanders General Mohamed Farah Aidid and Ali Mahdi Mohamed, in particular, clashed as each sought to exert <b>authority</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> capital.|$|E
5|$|Casimir IV died on 7 June 1492. One of {{his younger}} sons, Alexander, succeeded him in Lithuania, and John Albert was elected king of Poland in late August. Ivan III of Moscow broke into Lithuania {{to expand his}} <b>authority</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> principalities along the borderlands. During the {{following}} years, Ivan and Stephen coordinated their diplomacy, which enabled Ivan to persuade Alexander to acknowledge the loss of significant territories to Moscow in February 1494.|$|E
5|$|Corrector totius orientis (governor of {{the entire}} East): it is {{generally}} accepted by modern scholars that he bore this title. The corrector had an overall command of the Roman armies and <b>authority</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Roman provincial governors in the designated region. There are no known attestations of the title during Odaenathus' lifetime. Evidences for the king bearing the title are two inscriptions in Palmyrene dialect; one posthumous dedication describing him as MTQNNʿ of the East (derived from the Aramaic root TQN, meaning to set in order), and the other describing his heir Vaballathus with the same title albeit using the word PNRTTʿ instead of MTQNNʿ.|$|E
