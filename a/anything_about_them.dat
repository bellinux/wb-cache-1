Perhaps, {{since you}} have not heard <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>them</b> lately, you have been afraid, dear readers, that {{something}} bad had happened to them? Nothing of the sort! Tintin and Snowy were simply waiting for our excellent associate and friend Hergé to return to better health, as he was sick for a few weeks.|$|E
5|$|Twilight confronts Discord, {{accusing him}} of {{cheating}} since he destroyed the labyrinth before they {{could get to the}} end of the game. However, Discord counters this by reminding her that, while he had hinted at where the Elements were, he never said <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>them</b> being in the labyrinth. As he disappears and teases the ponies with another storm of chocolate rain, Twilight realizes that a line from Discord's riddle actually refers to Ponyville itself.|$|E
500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} were mostly mixed, calling the storyline a [...] "much less extreme reversal" [...] of the season two episode [...] "The Story on Page One", in which Peter {{attempts}} to seduce actor Luke Perry. Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club wrote {{of the episode}}, [...] "It was disappointing to see Family Guy bury a guest star like Kaitlin Olson in the background for much of her episode as Quagmire's sister last week, but it was even worse {{to see the show}} waste Ryan Reynolds." [...] He continued, [...] "He may not fit an empirical definition of a movie star, but I think he’s worth more as a guest than a tired trope like playing himself as a sexual predator towards Peter." [...] McFarland also criticized the episode's two storylines, noting, [...] "Both plots paint themselves into a corner with no time to get out. In the third act, Stewie is trapped at Consuela's house and Peter hadn't succumbed to Reynolds' repetitive and slowly escalating advances or done <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>them,</b> so the show snaps its fingers and ends each one prematurely." [...] He graded the episode as a C-. In a much more positive review, Terron R. Moore of Ology criticized the episode for not featuring Griffin family siblings Chris and Meg, but praised the series for adopting a Stewie-centric storyline. Moore noted of the storyline involving Reynolds, [...] "All pretty funny stuff, but Ryan Reynolds' entire guest slot is {{based on the fact that}} you like Ryan Reynolds and his occasionally homoerotic humor, which I can definitely appreciate." [...] He concluded his review by writing, [...] "Not the best Family Guy, but a definite improvement on the week before, using some of the elements it knows best." [...] Andy Neuenschwander of Yidio also gave mixed reaction to the episode, writing, [...] "Something happens whenever a celebrity shows up on [...] "Family Guy" [...] and plays themselves. I can't quite put my finger on it, but everything just feels a bit off. This episode, which featured Ryan Reynolds as Ryan Reynolds, only confirmed that feeling." [...] He also compared it to The Simpsons, noting, [...] "Maybe it's the way the celebrity is treated as a character: in shows like The Simpsons, celebrities who play themselves appear as a relatively normal version of themselves [...] But on Family Guy, celebrities tend to appear as some bizarro version of themselves." ...|$|E

50|$|Some critics, however, were {{disappointed}} with the film, complaining that it fell well short of the hype surrounding it, that it tried to tackle too many themes without saying <b>anything</b> unique <b>about</b> <b>them,</b> and that the overall story was weak.|$|R
5000|$|The {{attitudes of}} Surya's mother and Lakshmi towards their husbands are ironic in {{different}} ways. Both are fiercely defensive {{of their husbands}} and forbid Surya to say <b>anything</b> negative <b>about</b> <b>them.</b> Yet, Surya's mother has suffered as the landlord prefers Kaushalya to his legitimate wife, and Lakshmi continues to defend Kishtayya after {{having an affair with}} Surya.|$|R
2500|$|The government's {{activities}} aroused controversy at {{home and}} strong criticism abroad. A visiting delegation of US Congressmen led by Representative Steny Hoyer reported that there were [...] "severe human rights problems within the present new government, which {{is not willing to}} address them or admit them or do <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>them</b> yet." [...] American commentators cited the human rights issue as being {{one of the main reasons}} for Georgia's inability to secure widespread international recognition. The country had already been granted recognition by a limited number of countries (including Romania, Turkey, Canada, Finland, Ukraine, the Baltic States and others) but recognition by major countries, including the U.S., Sweden, Switzerland, France, Belgium, Pakistan, India, came only during Christmas of 1991.|$|E
2500|$|Various {{artists have}} cited Ege Bamyası as an influence. Stephen Malkmus of Pavement has been {{quoted as saying}} [...] "I played Can's Ege Bamyası album every night before I went to sleep for about three years."

I didn't see {{anything}} written about Can, I didn't know <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>them</b> except this okra can on the cover, which seemed completely bizarre. I finally picked that record up, and I completely wore it out. It was so alluring. Something about it made Can seem to be playing outside of rock 'n' roll. It was unlike anything else I was hearing at the time." ...|$|E
2500|$|We do {{not know}} <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>them,</b> except some work in the LEP. We first heard of them when Commander Root [...] "doused his cigar in the coffee cup of a passing gremlin" [...] just before he saw the footage of Captain Holly Short's kidnap in the first book. Also, as Root was in the {{terminal}} {{on his way to}} Fowl Manor, the attendant is being mobbed by a large amount of gremlins. [...] It's also possible that in the graphic novel a gremlin is seen attaching an arm patch to Root as they prepare to head to Fowl Manor. They have also been mentioned when Commander Root slapped at a paramedic gremlin who was applying burn salve to his forehead after being burnt on a whaling ship in book one page 123. Gremlin could also be another name for goblin as gremlins only appear in the first book. It Is also likely that they are related to goblins, but more intelligent.|$|E

However, he immediately confessed this involvement to his team-mates, and promised never to report <b>anything</b> negative <b>about</b> <b>them.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Clark cites a 1973 {{encounter}} {{as perhaps}} the earliest suggestion that the U.S. government was involved with ETs. That year, Robert Emenegger and Allan Sandler of Los Angeles, California were in contact with officials at Norton Air Force Base {{in order to make}} a documentary film. Emenegger and Sandler report that Air Force Officials (including Paul Shartle) suggested incorporating UFO information in the documentary, including as its centerpiece genuine footage of a 1971 UFO landing at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico. Furthermore, says Emenegger, he was given a tour of Holloman AFB and was shown where officials conferred with EBEs. This was supposedly not the first time the U.S. had met these aliens, as Emenegger reported that his U.S. military sources had [...] "been monitoring signals from an alien group with which they were unfamiliar, and did their ET guests know <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>them?</b> The ETs said no" [...] (Clark 1998, 144). The documentary was released in 1974 as UFO's: Past, Present and Future (narrated by Rod Serling) containing only a few seconds of the Holloman UFO footage, the remainder of the landing depicted with illustrations and re-enactments.|$|E
2500|$|Since the mid-1990s, {{the program}} {{production}} company {{and in some}} cases the executive producer (both Barker and Richards, the executive producer since September 2009) have been sued by numerous women. Most of the lawsuits involved models and other staff members in cases of sexual harassment, wrongful termination and racial discrimination. Allegations of sexual harassment brought by Parkinson led to Barker calling a press conference to admit a past consensual sexual relationship with her, while denying any harassment and alleging instead that she was only angry with him for calling off the relationship. Barker was widowed in 1981 following the death of his wife, Dorothy Jo. It has also been alleged that Barker and senior staff created a hostile work environment, particularly to those who testified for the plaintiffs suing Barker. Responding to the controversy just before his retirement, Barker told William Keck of USA Today, [...] " [...] been such a problem. I don't want to say <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>them.</b> They [...] disgusting; I don't want to mention them." [...] The Barker-era lawsuits, except for one, were settled out of court. After Barker dropped his slander suit against Hallstrom, she eventually countersued and received millions in settlement. There are two lawsuits in litigation: a pregnancy discrimination suit involving Sherwood and a sexual harassment suit involving Lanisha Cole, filed in September 2011.|$|E
2500|$|By 0530 on 6 June 1944, {{the first}} wave of attackers {{approached}} the beach, the 741 Tank Battalion (Duplex drive (DD) Sherman amphibious tanks destined for the eastern half of Omaha were guided by LCC-20). At 0542, {{the first wave}} was dispatched. At 0641 PC-552 reported to [...] that the entire first wave foundered. The waves were too high and many DDs destined for Omaha were swamped and sank while still well off shore. On other beaches the commanders realized the danger and brought their DDs much closer inshore before launching allowing them to reach the shore. PC-552 spent the next 45 minutes picking up survivors, but watched many of the soldiers drown in front of them, helpless to do <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>them.</b> Crewmen Ted Guzda described the scene saying, [...] "We were the control vessel for {{the first wave of}} the invasion, they all went down, we picked up all the survivors and threw them on deck." [...] Ted Guzda recalled, [...] "Later we had to sink most of ," [...] he said. [...] "We took off whatever identification they had, put weights on them and sank them. There was nothing else we could do." [...] Some soldiers were so weak from exposure, sailors from PC-552 were required to be lowered by rope to the water to place ropes around the soldiers to pull them from the water. Those soldiers did not have the strength to raise their arms to grab hold of the rope.|$|E

From that day the Japanese village folk never heard <b>anything</b> more <b>about</b> <b>them,</b> and they are still a much-talked-of mystery. As the Russian government never said <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> the incident, the United States is still ignorant of the whereabouts of the lost poacher, nor has she ever heard, officially, {{of the way in which}} some of her citizens [...] "shanghaied" [...] five subjects of the tsar.
