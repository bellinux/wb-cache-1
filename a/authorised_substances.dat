50|$|EU {{philosophy}} on food additives, food enzymes, {{and food}} flavourings and ingredients intended {{for human consumption}} is that none should be put on the market unless they are included on a published Community list of <b>authorised</b> <b>substances,</b> in accordance with the conditions laid down in relevant food law. This approach is intended to bring food producers into compliance with the provisions of Regulation (EC) 1334/2008 that pertain to the safety of food flavourings. As part of the approval process, the EC will require full disclosure of study data, safety issues, and toxicological findings for all such additives.|$|E
40|$|On 18 February 2016, the European Ombudsman {{delivered}} a decision (case 12 / 2013 /MDC) {{that has the}} potential to thoroughly shake up {{the manner in which the}} European Commission authorises plant protection products (PPPs). Pesticide Action Network Europe (PAN-Europe) brought the case before the Ombudsman. It alleged that the Commission approves potentially unsafe PPPs and disregards data gaps in the risk assessment, thereby ignoring concerns raised by the European Food and Safety Authority. PAN-Europe also argued that the Commission fails to set appropriate risk mitigation measures and to check Member States’ compliance with those measures. The Ombudsman largely agreed with PAN-Europe. She found that the Commission indeed <b>authorised</b> <b>substances,</b> even when it was unclear whether a substance met the legal health and environmental safety requirements. The Ombudsman made several recommendations to the Commission for bringing its approval practice, which constitutes maladministration, in conformity with EU pesticide law...|$|E
40|$|Plant {{protection}} in organic farming has to simultaneously comply with {{two sets of}} regulations: regulations on organic production and pesticide legislation. This chapter describes the organic approach to plant protection, including the role of systems management versus direct interventions, the range of <b>authorised</b> <b>substances</b> and the procedures for authorising new substances and the withdrawal of old substances. External factors not related to organic farming also influence the availability of plant protection products. Scientific, regulatory and economic aspects may limit the registration of substances in a given country. On the other hand, {{there is an alternative}} route for the registration of fertilisers and plant strengtheners in some countries. As a result, the range of plant protection products available to organic farmers varies from one country to another. The history of the authorisation of sodium bicarbonate, spinosad, copper fungicides, clay minerals and granulosis viruses illustrates how the two sets of regulations can interact in very different ways, creating different patterns of availability. The practice of plant protection is illustrated for the prevention and control of apple scab, fire blight and codling moth in organic apple orchards. At the end of the chapter, research perspectives for a ‘self-regulating’ apple orchard where plant protection fully relies on systems management are presented. The level of environmental friendliness already achieved by organic plant protection is discussed, and approaches with the potential for improvement are identified...|$|E
40|$|The ERICA Integrated Approach and its {{associated}} tool and databases provide a method by which the likely impact of radioactive discharges on the environment can be evaluated, see Fig. 1. The various factors, which {{should be taken into}} account when making decisions both during and after an assessment has been made, are discussed for each stage in the assessment process for a hypothetical case study. The assessment will demonstrate the issues associated with the decision- making process at Tiers 1 and 2 within the ERICA Tool and how they may vary. The case study, set in England, evaluates the environmental impact of radioactive substances released under authorisation in response primarily to conservation legislation, because of the need to demonstrate that no adverse impacts will occur on Natura 2000 sites {{as a result of the}} release of an <b>authorised</b> <b>substance...</b>|$|R

40|$|Objective: The 1995 - 2005 {{balance of}} EMEA {{activities}} {{in the field of}} paediatric medicines was evaluated, taking into account the number both of drugs authorised for children and paediatric studies supporting the Marketing Authorisation (MA). Methods: Data on drugs authorised by EMEA were extracted from EPARs (European Public Assessment Reports). Active substance, year of approval, anatomical, therapeutic and chemical (ATC) code, indication, orphan status, ages, and registrative clinical studies characteristics were assessed. Results: The percentage of <b>authorised</b> <b>substances</b> for paediatrics is 33. 3 %. This percentage decreased or increased when different subsets of medicines were considered [medicines for children under 2 years (23. 4 %), N-ATC code drugs (6 %) and orphan drugs (46. 4 %) ]. A total of 165 trials were included in the MA dossiers of 51 drugs at the time of approval, and additional 22 studies were added to the dossiers of 12 active substances submitted for paediatric variations. PK and Efficacy/Safety studies were performed for 32 (52 %) active substances, while either one PK or one Efficacy/Safety study was carried out for 43 (69 %) and 45 (73 %) substances, respectively. Conclusions: This report demonstrates that the total number of paediatric medicines approved by EMEA is stable over the 10 -year period, while an increase in drugs to treat serious or orphan diseases has been observed. In addition, under the Centralised Procedure, a valuable number of paediatric trials have been submitted to support drug approval. © 2006 Springer-Verlag. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Nanomaterials {{are already}} {{used in many}} {{products}} in daily life. One area is consumer prod-ucts like fridges, packaging films or cutlery that comes into contact with food. So far {{there is no clear}} evidence of the addition of inorganic nanoparticles to foods. Nanotechnology is used to produce structures and materials with at least one dimension of between 1 and 100 nanometres (nm). A nanometre is a billionth of a metre. Because of their size nanoparticles have different properties from larger particles of the same substance. According to a representative BfR survey, nanotechnology is mainly viewed positively by consumers at the present time. However, consumers adopt a far more critical attitude to-wards the use of nanotechnology in food and food-contact articles. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) bases its assessment of the application area on the research strat-egy on the health and environmental risks of nanotechnologies already developed in 2007 together with the Federal Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (BAuA) and the Fed-eral Environmental Agency (UBA). BfR comes {{to the conclusion that the}} toxicological data available on the assessment of nanomaterials and the data on exposure assessment are not sufficient to undertake a risk assessment of the use of nanomaterials in foods. Regarding the use of nanomaterials as food additives and in food-contact articles, BfR points out that already <b>authorised</b> <b>substances</b> intended for use in the nanorange, should also be reviewed prior to their use from the health angle unless the particle size was already taken into account in the initial assessment...|$|E
40|$|Food {{is a big}} {{business}} in the EU and nanofood products are beginning {{to be placed on}} the market. It is still unclear whether the absence of minimum regulation at a global level promotes or prevents the growth of a market in nanofood. However, the development of an adequate risk management policy in relation to food safety is a key concern for consumers. Importantly, the European Parliament in its 2009 Resolution on “Legal aspects on nanomaterials” called for more in-depth scientific research on the toxicity of compounds in nanomaterials, and for the adoption of an EU definition of nanomaterials for regulatory purposes. Unfortunately, in 2011, nanotechnology led to inconclusive debates {{in the context of the}} revision of Novel Food Regulation. General Food Law applies to nanofood in terms of safety requirements, and specific rules also apply to food contact materials containing nanoparticles as well as to to additives, vitamins and minerals. The EU legislator also introduced mandatory labelling in respect of products derived from nanotechnologies. The legal framework is evolving according to the so-called “incremental approach”, a governance model that creates the risk of fragmentation. But the main problem is the inconsistent definition of the terms “nanotechnology” and “nanomaterials” when looking at the enforcement of regulations and the provision of a wide range of specific tools for different nanofoods: for example the use of positive lists of <b>authorised</b> <b>substances</b> applying only to food contact materials, additives and supplements. This contribution aims to review the regulations in force in respect to nanofood and novel foods and to highlight the problems that are still unresolved...|$|E
30|$|Tolyfluanid The {{authorisation}} of PPPs containing this fungicidal {{active substance}} was withdrawn in 2007. The {{reason for this}} was the “delayed” discovery that a metabolite (N,N-dimethylsulfamide) which can {{find its way into}} groundwater, though previously classified as toxicologically harmless, can be transformed into a genotoxic and carcinogenic substance (N-nitrosodimethylamine) during the preparation of drinking water by ozonisation. The use of the active substance was prohibited as a precautionary measure for the protection of drinking water [24]. However, residues of other active substances such as atrazine, which has long been banned in Germany, are still found in groundwater and other currently <b>authorised</b> active <b>substances</b> (e.g., bentazon, isoproturon, and chloridazon), and their metabolites are frequently found in groundwater at concentrations above the limit levels [25]. There have recently been intensive debates in Germany about the pollution of groundwater and the problems faced by water utilities endeavouring to maintain the high quality of German drinking water. The position of the water utilities is “that the active substances in plant protection products and their metabolites should be kept away from the water cycle at the first opportunity for the sake of precaution” [26].|$|R
40|$|Cerebrospinal {{fluid leak}} (CSF), {{clinical}} {{sign of a}} dural lesion of the skull base, is a relatively rare event that can present {{with a variety of}} symptoms. Every craniosinus fistula should be considered a serious, potentially life-threatening situation (even those cases with hidden CSF leak). Reports of experience concerning diagnosis and treatment of craniosinus fistulae have appeared in the Literature. In the last few years, the endoscopic nasal approach is proving effective as it makes diagnosis much easier and is the least invasive surgical approach, with the greatest percentage of success. Various classifications are being proposed to improve clinical evaluation of CSF leaks and to simplify the diagnostic and therapeutic approach. The most common parameters of classification are: aetiology (traumatic, iatrogenic, non-traumatic, etc.) site, type of flow (high or low pressure) and, as far as concerns treatment, the type of graft used, all of which have contributed to various diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms being proposed. Therefore, the subject seems to be widely schematized and the therapeutic attitude widely agreed. However, one of the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches is now being questioned. For some, it {{is the heart of the}} clinical approach, while for others, it is a useful tool yet too dangerous to be used on account of potential side effects: namely, the fluorescein test. This procedure, consisting of intrathecal injection of a colorant (fluorescein), is well known by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) which neither explicitly prohibits it, nor allows it, intrathecal administration is, therefore. an off label use. As far as the Authors know, authorization of this procedure has not been forthcoming anywhere in the world although the procedure itself is widely employed. As far as concerns the use of intrathecal fluorescein, many scientific papers have been written, clearly supporting its clinical usefulness. One limit to the use of fluorescein derives from frequent reports of complications, often related to the intrathecal administration; such complications are, however, always due to an incorrect dosage. In order to perform correct monitoring of any complication related to the use of intrathecal fluorescein and to investigate in a strictly scientific fashion, the legal problem related to the off label use (intrathecal administration) of an <b>authorised</b> <b>substance,</b> the Authors coordinated an Italian multicentre study aimed at establishig the tolerability of the lumbar intrathecal administration of fluorescein. Aim of the study was to review the literature focusing on CSF leaks, to set up to date diagnostic and therapeutic indications of fluorescein and to report the preliminary results of the Italian multicentre study...|$|R

40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} study {{to investigate the}} sensitivity of selected pathogenic bacteria isolated from food-producing animals (dairy cows, fattened pigs) against antimicrobial substances was performed. The hereby established database will be the rational to tackle the problem of development and spread of resistance in the future. In the year 2001, the bacterial species/genera Escherichia (E.) coli, Staphylococcus (S.) aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. (CNS) and Streptococcus spp. (at least S. agalactiae, S. dysgalactiae, S. uberis) were selected as organisms for the indication "acute mastitis of dairy cattle" and P. multocida as well as M. haemolytica for the indication "respiratory disease of fattening pigs". To guarantee a representative data set, the cooperating institutions involved in the sample collection and the isolation of bacteria, had to stick to a randomized sampling plan. Thus, only one representative bacterial isolate per each animal herd was collected by the participating institutions and than investigated in the Bundesinstitut für Verbraucherschutz und Lebensmittelsicherheit (BVL), former BgVV. Bacterial species were identified, and the minimum inhibiting concentration (MIC) {{was determined by the}} microbroth dilution method in line with recommendations of the National Committee for Laboratory Standards (NCCLS). Evaluating the MIC values as sensitive or resistant was determined according to veterinary breakpoints given by the NCCLS and the Danish Integrated Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring and Research Programme (DANMAP). The examined antibiotics were selected based on three criteria: <b>substances</b> <b>authorised</b> for the veterinary field, <b>substances</b> <b>authorised</b> for the medical field (or equivalent in veterinary medicine), and substances corresponding to the bacterial spectrum to be tested. A maximum of 14 substances and two dual active substance combinations were examined in 12 dilution steps. A total of 39 laboratories in 13 different German federal states took part in this nationwide monitoring study. 1058 bacterial strains were investigated, including 214 of the species E. coli, 404 of the genus Staphylococcus, 243 of the genus Streptococcus, 176 of the species P. multocida and 21 of the species M. haemolytica. Regarding E. coli strains from mastitis milk samples, similar resistance rates were determined for ampicillin (8. 9 %) and first generation cephalosporins (8. 4 %). Only one E. coli strain was found to be resistant to ceftiofur, a third generation cephalosporin. Resistance rates against aminoglycoside antibiotics decreased in relation to the time period since the permission of the respective antibiotics (streptomycin 10. 2 %, neomycin 5. 1 % and gentamicin 1. 8 %). 5 - 10 % of the bacterial strains were resistant against tetracycline, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and florfenicol. No resistances were found against amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, colistin, enrofloxacin, flumequine, nalidixic acid or nitrofurantoin. 24 % of the Staphylococcus strains from mastitis milk samples proved to be resistant against penicillin. Some 21 % of the S. aureus strains, but only 12 % of the CNS, showed clinical resistance against ampicillin, respectively. This was due to the different activities of bacterial &# 946;-lactamases. While the S. aureus strains showed complete sensitivity against oxacillin, within the CNS species only a small resistance development of 0, 5 % was measured. None of the staphylococcal strains was found resistant against active substance combinations such as amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, or against cephalosporin (first generation) and glycopeptides (vancomycin). Fluoroquinolone and aminoglycoside (gentamicin) resistance rates up to 0. 2 % are judged as insignificant. An exception was the older aminoglycoside, streptomycin, with a resistance rate of approx. 7 %. By contrast, the staphylococcal strains from mastitis milk samples showed far higher resistance rates of around 46 % to avilamycin. While all Staphylococcus strains showed resistance against chloramphenicol of approx. 3 %, the rates against tetracycline and the active substances of the MLS antibiotics were lower in S. aureus than in the CNS species. 117 of the 243 Streptococci investigated were assigned to the species S. uberis, 69 to the species S. dysgalatiae and 48 strains to the species S. agalactiae. The other 9 strains belonged to the species S. bovis, S. mitis and S. acidominus. In contrast to the Staphylococcus spp. from mastitis milk samples, the tested Streptococcus spp. proved to be far more resistant to tetracycline (32 %) and to the macrolide erythromycin (16 %). All streptococci were completely sensitive against penicillin and ampicillin. Regarding the bacterial species P. multocida (n = 176) and M. haemolytica (n = 21), investigated as model organisms for the indication of "respiratory disease", M. haemolytica strains in general expressed higher resistance levels than P. multocida species. Both bacterial species displayed no resistance against ceftiofur, florfenicol, gentamicin or the combination, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. Due to the lack of valid recommended MIC values concerning the resistance against ampicillin, cefquinom, enrofloxacin, flumequine, nalidixic acid, oxacillin and streptomycin, those resistance rates can not be defined in this thesis. The quantitative sensitivity results (MIC) from the tested bacterial species determined in this study revealed that in comparison to data previously published on the resistance rates of bacteria in Germany, a lower resistance prevalence is to be expected. Reasons for major differences between this study and those published previously amongst other details are, a) investigation of a representative sample collection, b) a different method of resistance determination (MIC), c) an evaluation based on different criteria (NCCLS, DANMAP). These data obtained here by standardised methods indicate that the prevalences of resistances against antibiotics of the examined bacterial species against the tested substances is relatively low. Therefore, the therapeutical use of antibiotics to treat bacterial infections with these pathogens is presumably still highly effective. However, to confirm this assumption, further data have to be generated and evaluated. The need of a national resistance monitoring based on standardized methods is emphasized. Such a monitoring is useful both to determine changes in the resistance situation over time and to readily implement intervention strategies when increasing resistances are detected. In addition, the data should become available to practising veterinary surgeons enabling a more calculated and responsible antibiotic therapy. Consequently the acquired data will ensure continues use of antibiotics in veterinary medicine...|$|R
