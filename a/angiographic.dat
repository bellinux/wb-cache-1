25|$|By radiographic, i.e. X-Ray, methods, after arteries have {{developed}} advanced calcified atherosclerotic plaque, IMT {{can also be}} semi-estimated by {{the distance between the}} outer edges of calcification (actually this leaves out most of the media) and the outer edges of an <b>angiographic</b> dye column within the artery lumen. This is a far more complex technique; it is invasive to the body due to the use of X-Ray radiation, catheters and <b>angiographic</b> contrast agents.|$|E
25|$|Also, {{the shift}} towards {{endovascular}} treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms pushed {{the spread of}} <b>angiographic</b> systems in vascular OR environments. Particularly for complex endografts, a hybrid operating theater should be a basic requirement. Also, it is well-suited for emergency treatment.|$|E
25|$|To {{increase}} the yield rate, advanced interventional imaging with <b>angiographic</b> C-arms {{has proven to}} be beneficial. The advantage of intra-procedural imaging is that the patient and the diaphragm are in exactly the same position during 2D/3D imaging and the actual biopsy. Hence the accuracy is usually much higher than using pre-operative data.|$|E
25|$|Modern <b>angiographic</b> {{systems are}} not just used for imaging, but support the surgeon also during the {{procedure}} by guiding the intervention based on 3D information acquired either pre-operatively or intra-operatively. Such guidance requires that the 3D information is registered to the patient. This is done using special proprietary software algorithms.|$|E
25|$|Colonoscopy {{is useful}} for the {{diagnosis}} and treatment of lower GI bleeding. A number of techniques may be employed including: clipping, cauterizing, and sclerotherapy. Preparation for colonoscopy takes a minimum of six hours which in those bleeding briskly may limit its applicability. Surgery, while rarely used to treat upper GI bleeds, is still commonly used to manage lower GI bleeds by cutting out the part of the intestines that is causing the problem. <b>Angiographic</b> embolization may be used for both upper and lower GI bleeds. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting (TIPS) may also be considered.|$|E
25|$|Trans-Aortic Valve Implantation {{requires}} exact {{positioning of}} the valve in the aortic root to prevent complications. A good fluoroscopic view is essential, whereby an exact perpendicular angle to the aortic root {{is considered to be}} optimal for the implantation. Recently, applications have been released which support the surgeon in selecting this optimal fluoroscopy angulation or even drive the C-arm automatically into the perpendicular view to the aortic root. Some approaches are based on pre-operative CT images, which are used to segment the aorta and calculate optimal viewing angles for valve implantations. CT images must be registered with C-arm CT or fluoroscopic images to transfer the 3D volume to the actual <b>angiographic</b> system. Errors during the registration process might result in diversification from the optimal angulations of the C-arm and must be manually corrected. Additionally, anatomical variations between the acquisition of the pre-operatively CT image and surgery are not accounted for. Patients are generally imaged with hands-up in a CT scanner while surgery is performed with arms aside the patient, which leads to substantial errors. Algorithms purely based on C-arm CT images acquired in the OR by the <b>angiographic</b> system are inherently registered to the patient and show the present anatomy structures. With such an approach, the surgeon does not rely on pre-operative CT images acquired by the radiological department which simplifies the workflow in the OR and reduces errors in the process.|$|E
25|$|Generally, {{unless the}} {{placenta}} {{can be easily}} tied off or removed, it may be preferable to leave it in place and allow for a natural regression. This process may take several months and can be monitored by clinical examination, checking human chorionic gonadotropin levels and by ultrasound scanning (in particular using doppler ultrasonography. Use of methotrexate to accelerate placental regression is controversial as {{the large amount of}} necrotic tissue is a potential site for infection, mifepristone has also be used to promote placental regression. Placental vessels have also been blocked by <b>angiographic</b> embolization. Complications of leaving the placenta can include residual bleeding, infection, bowel obstruction, pre-eclampsia (which may all necessitate further surgery) and failure to breast feed due to placental hormones.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} in another study that a maximal CIMT value of 0.956mm had 85.7% sensitivity and 85.1% specificity to predict <b>angiographic</b> CAD. The study group consisted of patients admitted to the cardiology outpatient clinic with symptoms of stable angina pectoris. The study showed CIMT was higher in patients with significant CAD than in patients with non-critical coronary lesions. Regression analysis revealed that thickening of the mean intima-media complex more than 1.0 was predictive of significant CAD our patients. There was incremental significant increase in CIMT with the number coronary vessel involved. In accordance with the literature, it was found that CIMT was significantly higher in the presence of CAD. Furthermore, CIMT was increased as the number of involved vessels increased and the highest CIMT values were noted in patients with left main coronary involvement. However, human clinical trials have been slow to provide clinical & medical evidence, partly because the asymptomatic nature of atheromata make them especially difficult to study. Promising results are found using carotid intima-media thickness scanning (CIMT can be measured by B-mode ultrasonography), B-vitamins that reduce a protein corrosive, homocysteine and that reduce neck carotid artery plaque volume and thickness, and stroke, even in late-stage disease.|$|E

2500|$|Terminologia Anatomica in 1998 {{subdivided}} {{the artery}} into four parts: [...] "cervical", [...] "petrous", [...] "cavernous", and [...] "cerebral". However, in clinical settings, the classification {{system of the}} internal carotid artery usually follows the 1996 recommendations by Bouthillier, describing seven anatomical segments of the internal carotid artery, each with a corresponding alphanumeric identifierâ€”C1 cervical, C2 petrous, C3 lacerum, C4 cavernous, C5 clinoid, C6 ophthalmic, and C7 communicating. The Bouthillier nomenclature remains in widespread use by neurosurgeons, neuroradiologists and neurologists. The segments are subdivided based on anatomical and microsurgical landmarks and surrounding anatomy, more than <b>angiographic</b> appearance of the artery. [...] An alternative embryologic classification system proposed by [...] and colleagues is invaluable {{when it comes to}} explanation of many internal carotid artery variants. An older clinical classification, based on pioneering work by Fischer, is mainly of historical significance.|$|E
