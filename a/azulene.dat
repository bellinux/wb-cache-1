40|$|Highly {{convergent}} annulation {{strategies have}} been developed for the synthesis of <b>azulenes</b> and polycyclic nitrogen heterocycles. Specifically, substituted <b>azulenes</b> have been synthesized via a ring expansion-annulation strategy based on n-halo diazo ketones. The method employs the use of readily available benzenoid starting materials and achieves the synthesis of <b>azulenes</b> substituted on both the five- and seven-membered rings regioselectively. The synthetic utility of the ring expansion annulation products, in particular azulenyl halides and triflates, has been demonstrated by their successful application in transition metal-mediated carbon-carbon bond forming reactions. These reactions have been used to further functionalize the five- and seven-membered rings and also in the synthesis of oligoazulenes and azulenylamino acid derivatives. In addition, polycyclic nitrogen heterocycles have been synthesized via a tandem ring forming strategy. The strategy employs a novel benzannulation reaction of substituted cyclobutenones with ynamides, which are synthesized via the strategy for the N-alkynylation of amides strategy developed in the Danheiser laboratory. The products of these benzannulation reactions, highly-substituted anilines, then participate in ring closing metathesis reactions to form various nitrogen heterocycles. In particular dihydroquinolines, hydrobenzoazepines, and hydrobenzoazocines were synthesized via this tandem ynamide benzannulation ring closing metathesis strategy. by Aimee Lynn Crombie.

40|$|Background: We have {{previously}} reported that azulene-related compounds can protect cells from UV-induced cytotoxicity. However, {{due to their}} high water insolubility, their anti-UV activity could not be accurately determined. In the present study, we newly-synthesized a total of nine derivatives with higher water solubility, and re-investigated their anti-UV activity. Materials and Methods: Cytotoxicity of these compounds against three human normal oral and three human oral cells squamous cell carcinoma cell lines (OSCCs) was evaluated by the 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) method. The concentration that reduced the viable cell number by 50 % (CC 50) and the concentration that increased the viability of UV-irradiated cells to 50 % (EC 50) were determined by the dose-response curves. Anti-UV activity (SI) {{was determined by the}} ratio of CC 50 to EC 50. The tumor specificity was determined by the ratio of the mean CC 50 value for the normal cells to that for OSCC cells. Apoptosis induction was evaluated by DNA fragmentation and caspase activation. Results: All compounds except one (sodium 7 -isopropyl- 3 -ethylazulene- 1 -sulfonate) were new compounds, and showed some tumor specificity (TS value= 1. 4 to 3. 5), without induction of hormesis or apoptosis at lower and higher concentrations, respectively.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although {{numerous}} {{articles have}} dealt with the biological activities of <b>azulenes,</b> studies of benzo[b]cyclohept[e][1, 4]oxazines are limited. In the present study, we investigated a total of 14 newly-synthesized benzo[b]cyclohept[e][1, 4]oxazines for their growth stimulation at low concentrations (so-called 'hormesis'), cytotoxicity at higher concentrations and apoptosis-inducing activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cytotoxicity of these compounds against human normal gingival fibroblast (HGF) and human oral squamous cell carcinoma cell lines derived from gingival tissue (Ca 9 - 22), was evaluated by the 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) method. The tumor specificity (TS) was determined by the ratio of the 50 % cytotoxic concentration (CC??) value for HGF cells to that for Ca 9 - 22 cells. Apoptosis induction was evaluated by DNA fragmentation and caspase- 3 activation. RESULTS: Compounds 10 -(2 -methoxyethylamino) benzo[b] cyclohept[e][1, 4]oxazine and 10 -(3 -methoxypropylamino) benzo[b]cyclohept[e][1, 4] oxazine, but not other compounds, induced hormesis only in HGF cells. Compound 10 -(6 -hydroxyhexylamino) benzo[b] cyclohept[e][1, 4]oxazine [4] showed the highest cytotoxicity against Ca 9 - 22 cells, followed by 10 -(4 -hydroxybutylamino) benzo[b]cyclohept[e] [1, 4]oxazine and 10 -(5 -hydroxypentylamino) benzo[b]cyclo-hept[e][1, 4]oxazine. Compound [4] did not induce apoptosis markers, but rather induced necrotic cell death (characterized by a smear pattern of DNA fragmentation). CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that the OH group and a certain length of methylene group are necessary for maximal cytotoxicity, and substitution of fluoride in the benzene ring enhances cytotoxicity. 1 st author : Ohno Masanori → Ohno, Tsunenori 大野, 雅紀（オオノ, ツネノリ...|$|R
40|$|Background: The dihydroazulene (DHA) /vinylheptafulvene (VHF) system (with two cyano {{groups at}} C 1) {{functions}} as a photo-/thermoswitch. Direct ionic bromination of DHA has previously furnished a regioselective route to a 7, 8 -dibromide, which by elimination was converted to a 7 -bromo-substituted DHA. This compound {{has served as a}} central building block for functionalization of the DHA by palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions. The current work explores another bromination protocol for achieving the isomeric 3 -bromo-DHA and also explores the outcome of additional bromination of this compound {{as well as of the}} known 7 -bromo-DHA. Results: Radical bromination on two different VHFs by using N -bromosuccinimide/benzoyl peroxide and light, followed by a ring-closure reaction generated the corresponding 3 -bromo-DHAs, as confirmed in one case by X-ray crystallography. According to a 1 H NMR spectroscopic study, the ring closure of the brominated VHF seemed to occur readily under the reaction conditions. A subsequent bromination&# 8211;elimination protocol provided a 3, 7 -dibromo-DHA. In contrast, treating the known 7 -bromo-DHA with bromine generated a very labile species that was converted to a new 3, 7 -dibromoazulene, i. e., the fully unsaturated species. <b>Azulenes</b> were also found to form from brominated compounds when left standing for a long time in the solid state. Kinetics measurements reveal that the 3 -bromo substituent enhances the rate of the thermal conversion of the VHF to DHA, which is opposite to the effect exerted by a bromo substituent in the seven-membered ring. Conclusion: Two general procedures for functionalizing the DHA core with a bromo substituent (at positions 3 and 7, respectively) are now available with the DHA as starting material...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We have {{previously}} reported the cytotoxicity {{and type of}} cell death induced by twenty trihaloacetylazulenes in human tumor cell lines. We determined {{for the first time}} the most-stable chemical structures from their reported structures, using the semiempirical molecular—orbital method (CONFLEX/PM 5), and then delineated the relationship between their cytotoxicity (evaluated by 50 % cytotoxic concentration, CC 50) and a total of twelve parameters. The parameters used are the molecular weight and eleven chemical descriptors: the heat of formation (COSMO, non-COSMO), stability of hydration (=COSMO – nonCOSMO (ΔH)), dipole moment (D), hydrophobicity (log P), highest occupied molecular orbital energy (EHOMO), lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy (ELUMO), absolute hardness [η=(ELUMO–EHOMO) / 2], absolute electron negativity [χ=–(ELUMO+EHOMO) / 2], reactivity index (ω=χ 2 / 2 η) and surface area (Å 2), and volume of the molecule (Å 3). There was good correlation between the CC 50 value and all descriptors except for absolute hardness in HL- 60 cells. There was also a good correlation between the CC 50 value and EHOMO, χ, ω, surface area, volume and molecular weight in HSC- 2, HSC- 3 and HSC- 4 cells. The descriptors determined by the present method are useful in evaluating the biological activity of trihaloacetylazulenes. Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) represents the quantitative relationship between the structure and biological (pharmaceutical or toxicological) activity of chemical substances. The purpose of QSAR is to predict the pharmacological potency of structurally-related compounds by this mathematical relationship between the two. It is generally accepted that QSAR analyses are performed based on previously published experimental data, and treated as separated papers. <b>Azulenes</b> have shown antibacterial activity (1), anti-ulcer activity (2), and chemotherapeutic activity against mucous membrane diseases (3).

40|$|The {{formation}} of the Wheland or Meisenheimer cr-complexes- the wellknown phenomena in chemistry of aromatics and heteroaromatics [1, 2]- is a key step in the both classical SE 2 Ar and SN 2 Ar substitution. The ability of arenes and hetarenes to form predominantly the cationic or the anionic type of s-complexes is, in general, determined by the p-excessive or p-deficient character of aromatic nucleus (cf. known C-protonation of <b>azulenes,</b> indoles, donor-substituted benzenes or vice versa addition of nucleophiles to nitroazines and polynitroarenes). To our knowledge the simple aromatics, capable of undergoing easy transformation in the both directions- into the anionic, {{as well as the}} cationic s-complexes- are still unknown. The simplest possible aromatics of this type would be expected to contain two condensed rings together with a high asymmetry of the p-electron density. With the indolizines la,b, we found the first example of the bicyclic arenes, which easily form cationic and anionic s-complexes on carbon atoms with a simple variation in the pH of the solvent system. Thus, indolizines la,b [3] are reversibly transformed in the strong acids (CF 3 COOH, HCI, H 2 SO 4) into the cations lla,b and in the alkaline solution (NaOH/aq EtOH, MeOH/MeONa) into the anions llla,b.
