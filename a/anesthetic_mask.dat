5000|$|In the United States, {{vinyl ether}} was sold under the trade name Vinethene. In {{addition}} to the normal inhibitors, vinyl ether intended for anesthetic use contained some ethanol (1.5-5%) to prevent frosting of the <b>anesthetic</b> <b>mask.</b> (Major, 1937) Despite inhibitors manufacturers warned that once opened vinyl ether should be used quickly.

50|$|To avoid a scandal, Gaby's {{managers}} and entourage call in Roberto to exonerate her, and Gaby realizes that she's loved Roberto all along. Gaby then finds out the Roberto married her sister Anna, after {{meeting at the}} auction of his father's house. Gaby commits suicide, leaving a note detailing her loneliness that persisted through her stardom. At {{the end of the}} film, the <b>anesthetic</b> <b>mask</b> is removed, the doctors confirm her death, and the printing presses stop printing the poster for her film.|$|E
40|$|Kasabach-Merritt {{syndrome}} presents {{various problems}} for anesthetic management, which include thrombocytopenia, bleeding tendency, and problems {{arising from the}} hemangioma mass itself. A 20 -month-old female was scheduled for cryosurgery of a hemangioma on the face. Massive bleeding from the tumor was easily induced even by slight contact. The hematologic examination revealed a low platelet count and anemia. Anesthesia was induced carefully by applying an adult <b>anesthetic</b> <b>mask</b> to avoid the large tumor mass on the face and maintained with halothane and nitrous oxide/oxygen. Additional doses of prednisolone were administered before and during anesthesia to compensate for possible adrenal insufficiency due to steroid therapy which she had been receiving. Neither excessive bleeding nor any other particular complications occurred during anesthesia and surgery, and the postoperative course was also uneventful...|$|E
40|$|Systolic {{anterior}} {{motion of}} the mitral valve is usually associated with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy that results in left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. This is sometimes treated by volume loading or negative inotropics such as beta blockers. We report a rare case of dynamic systolic anterior {{motion of the}} mitral valve, in which a beta blocker did not diminish but <b>anesthetic</b> agents <b>masked</b> intraoperatively. The patient underwent mitral valve replace-ment, and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction was successfully treated...|$|R
40|$|The article {{concerns}} the computer-assisted vision system {{created for the}} detection of the disposable <b>anesthetic</b> respiratory <b>masks.</b> This article provides the classification of defects which may be common to both rubber and plastic parts of the masks. The defects were divided into groups and the nature of them was investigated. The algorithms and methods {{for the detection of}} defective products were based on the segmentation of image and the detection of uneven contours. The experiment results are presented in this work. With reference to the results, the most effective masks’ filters were identified. The achieved specificity of the computer vision system is 100 % and the sensitivity is 100 %...|$|R
40|$|Various lesions {{have been}} {{described}} as post-intubation complications: injuries, usually of minor degree, of the pharynx and larynx, oedema of the larynx, ulcerations of the pharynx and larynx with pseudomembranes and bleeding, chondromalacia of the larynx, granulomata, oesophago-tracheal fistula, stenosis of the larynx or trachea, paralysis and synechia of the vocal cords, paralysis of the tongue. Etiologic factors of these complications are mainly chemical, in relation with the material of the tube and with the sterilization agents, or mechanical due to pressure on neighbouring tissues. Post-intubation sore throat seems independent from traumatic laryngoscopy. Although intubation is meant to provide safer ventilation, interference with respiration may occur by compression of the tube or accidental obstruction from various causes. It should not be forgotten that in anesthesia cases, for which intubation is not really required, it may be advantageous to administer the <b>anesthetic</b> by <b>mask.</b> 27 references are cited.

40|$|Through {{the use of}} an {{automatic}} photo tube dew-point hygrometer, the author succeeded in measuring dew point of gas flows continuously in anesthetic circuits. Simultaneous thermometries were done on the nasal or oral mucosa, on the respiratory gas flows in the <b>anesthetic</b> <b>mask</b> or the endotracheal tube, and on the gas in the inhaling conduit. Experiments were performed on ten adults patients undergoing various types of surgery under general inhalation anesthesia. Anesthetic technics were varied intentionally during the measurements. Thus, both absolute and relative humidities of exhaled and inhaled gases, and respiratory water and heat losses were calculated under various anesthetic conditions, and physiological and clinical considerations were discussed. The conclusions obtained from this research are as follows: (1) When a non-rebreathing system is applied, moisture content of exhaled gas is minimal, and respiratory losses of both water and heat are maximum. With a semi-closed circle method, according to decreasing fresh gas flows, the humidity of the inspiratory and expiratory gases becomes higher, and both heat and water losses through respiration are lessened. When a closed circle method, with carbon dioxide absorption, is employed, temperature and humidity of gas in the inhaling conduit are highest, and the expired gas offers the maximum temperature and moisture contenL Both water and heat losses from anesthesia become minimal when administered in a closed system. (2) While the water and heat that a patient loses through respiration increase with increasing breathing capacity, they are still small parts of the total water and heat losses of the patient. Water and heat losses via anesthesia systems are not so predominant in maintaining water balance and heat regulation of patients during anesthesia and surgery. </p...|$|E
40|$|Publicly {{available}} internal {{tobacco industry}} documents were analyzed to explore questions regarding menthol cigarettes and cessation behavior, {{using the following}} as initial questions: 1) Compared to non-menthol smokers, do menthol smokers {{have a harder time}} quitting, report more or fewer quit attempts, and/or have higher or lower quit rates? 2) Compared to non-menthol smokers, are menthol smokers more or less likely to relapse or delay quitting, and/or to experience different odds of maintaining abstinence long-term? Tobacco companies largely considered reviews of the academic literature on these questions; therefore, documentary evidence was employed to refine research questions. More than 500 relevant documents were identified on 1) perceived sensory and taste rewards of menthol and potential relation to quitting; 2) motivation or desire to quit among menthol users; and 3) socio-demographic correlates of both menthol usage and cessation patterns. Menthol’s cooling and <b>anesthetic</b> effects <b>mask</b> the short-term negatives of smoking such as throat pain, burning, and cough. This may provide superficial physical relief as well as psychological assurance against concerns about health that would otherwise motivate smokers to quit. Menthol smokers, particularly women, also perceive the minty aroma of menthol cigarettes to be more socially acceptable than non-menthol cigarettes, a perception that lessens the impact of smoking denormalization on quitting motivation. Relative to the overall smoking market, menthol smokers tend to be younger, female, and non-white; this description also fits those smokers who have a harder time of quitting and staying quit. Document analysis suggests that menthol in cigarettes may encourage experimenters who find non-mentholated cigarettes too harsh, including young or inexperienced users, to progress to regular smoking rather than quitting, and may inhibit the desire to quit among established menthol smokers who have become accustomed to the taste and sensation of menthol cigarettes...|$|R
