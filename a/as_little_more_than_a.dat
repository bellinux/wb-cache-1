5|$|Duke of Marmalade {{was owned}} during his racing career by Sue Magnier and Michael Tabor, winning {{his first two}} races as a two-year-old in June 2006. He did not win again until the spring of his four-year-old season, almost twenty-two months later. During this winless period he was {{sometimes}} regarded <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> pacemaker for more celebrated stable companions such as Dylan Thomas. In his final year of racing he recorded wins in the Prix Ganay, the Tattersalls Gold Cup, the Prince of Wales's Stakes, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes and International Stakes. He was retired in October 2008 after running in the Breeders' Cup Classic. Duke of Marmalade sired four European Classic winners in 2015, namely Nutan, Star of Seville, Simple Verse and Sound of Freedom.|$|E
25|$|The 1979 film Angels Revenge, {{featured}} a similar concept with seven women joining {{to stop a}} drug operation. This film was poorly received and viewed by many <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> cheap knockoff and was even mocked in a 1995 episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000.|$|E
25|$|Pánfilo de Narváez gave Havana – {{the sixth}} town {{founded by the}} Spanish on Cuba – its name: San Cristóbal de la Habana. The name {{combines}} San Cristóbal, patron saint of Havana. Shortly after the founding of Cuba's first cities, the island served <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> base for the Conquista of other lands.|$|E

25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1917, the Russian {{sculptor}} Chana Orloff introduced him to a beautiful 19-year-old art student named Jeanne Hébuterne who had posed for Tsuguharu Foujita. From a conservative bourgeois background, Hébuterne was renounced by her devout Roman Catholic family for her liaison with Modigliani, whom they saw <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> debauched derelict. Despite her family's objections, soon they were living together.|$|E
25|$|The Avro Type 688 Tudor was a British piston-engined {{airliner}} {{based on}} Avro's four-engine Lincoln bomber, itself {{a descendant of}} the famous Lancaster heavy bomber, and was Britain's first pressurised airliner. Customers saw the aircraft <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> pressurised DC-4 Skymaster, and few orders were forthcoming, important customers preferring to buy US aircraft. The tailwheel undercarriage layout was also dated and a disadvantage.|$|E
25|$|In {{his first}} two years for Surrey, with George Lohmann and John Sharpe doing all that was required, Lockwood was {{regarded}} <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> capable batsman. However, with some support bowling wanted as Sharpe began a sudden decline, Surrey turned to Lockwood and on the treacherous wickets of August 1891 he proved quite irresistible. His 7 for 19 against Kent was seen as the most difficult bowling of the year by Wisden.|$|E
50|$|Captain Mike Across America premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival to lackluster reviews. Most critics {{alleged that}} it served <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> self-promotion for Moore.|$|R
5000|$|In [...] "Intelligence {{and the war}} in Bosnia, 1992-1995", Cees Wiebes {{writes that}} US {{intelligence}} had [...] "exposed many media reports from Sarajevo <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> Bosnian propaganda." ...|$|R
50|$|Although {{this was}} the largest popular {{uprising}} of the Meiji period, {{or perhaps because of}} it, the government sought to dismiss it by describing the rebels <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> hooligans.|$|R
25|$|As {{most of the}} Assembly still favoured a {{constitutional}} monarchy rather than a republic, the various groups reached a compromise which left Louis XVI <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> figurehead: {{he was forced to}} swear an oath to the constitution, and a decree declared that retracting the oath, heading an army for the purpose of making war upon the nation, or permitting anyone to do so in his name would amount to abdication.|$|E
25|$|In 1933, Brown {{was persuaded}} by his cousin, {{who was the}} captain of Huddersfield Town at the time, to join the club as a trainee. Brown hoped that the club would sponsor his further education, {{although}} he soon realised that he was regarded <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> member of the ground staff at Huddersfield and that the club {{had no interest in}} funding his study. Unable to settle, he left the club and spent the following {{two and a half years}} as a policeman.|$|E
25|$|A {{publication}} from 2005 {{argued that}} goals related to maternal mortality, malaria and tuberculosis {{are impossible to}} measure and that current UN estimates lack scientific validity or are missing. Household surveys are the primary measure for the health MDGs but may be poor and duplicative measurements that consume limited resources. Furthermore, countries with {{the highest levels of}} these conditions typically have the least reliable data collection. The study also argued that without accurate measures, it is impossible to determine the amount of progress, leaving MDGs <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> rhetorical call to arms.|$|E
5000|$|The {{protocol}} {{is controversial}} {{and has been}} attacked by anti-euthanasia campaigner Wesley J. Smith, Senior Fellow at the Discovery Institute, who described it <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> an attempt to legalize infanticide.|$|R
50|$|Giants - {{standing}} {{at an average}} of twelve feet tall, giants form no civilized society, living <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> wild animals in the Northlands. The moredhel were known to recruit giants into their army.|$|R
50|$|Though the {{simplest}} phosphazene superbase, P1-Me, was first synthesized in 1975, chemists {{assumed that the}} compounds were highly unstable, like their alkyl-substituted derivatives. The species was regarded at that time <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> an academic curiosity.|$|R
25|$|Food {{rationing}} in England {{came to an}} end in {{the year}} of publication, but its effect is still felt in the egg shortages that are mentioned in the novel. Throughout, there is a strong sense of the hardships of the post-war period, including the conniving Miss Gilchrist's heartache at losing her cherished teashop due to food shortages, and being forced into a life of dependence, in which she is regarded <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> servant. There are also comments on the increased burden of taxation associated with Clement Attlee's government.|$|E
25|$|I confess that, as {{a student}} unaware {{of the history of}} the subject and unaware of the {{connection}} with cyclotomy, I did not find the law or its so-called elementary proofs appealing. I suppose, although I would not have (and could not have) expressed myself in this way that I saw it <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> mathematical curiosity, fit more for amateurs than for the attention of the serious mathematician that I then hoped to become. It was only in Hermann Weyl's book on the algebraic theory of numbers that I appreciated it as anything more.|$|E
25|$|While the USA had FIFA sanction, {{the foreign}} teams which were rebranded as American {{for the summer}} 1967 season viewed the league <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> {{training}} exercise for their off-season, and most did not field their best players. The NPSL had a two-year national television contract in the U.S. with the CBS television network...referees were instructed to whistle fouls and delay play to allow CBS to insert commercials. The ratings for matches were unacceptable even by weekend daytime standards and the arrangement with CBS was soon terminated. Bill MacPhail, head of CBS Sports, attributed NPSL's lack of TV appeal to empty stadiums with few fans, and to undistinguished foreign players who were unfamiliar to American soccer fans.|$|E
25|$|Nikkatsu hired AV queen Hitomi Kobayashi (debut 1986 - see list below) {{to star in}} her own {{theatrical}} film {{series in}} 1987, but these films were judged <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> AVs on film, and were not popular.|$|R
5000|$|The Socialist Alliance {{has been}} highly {{critical}} of the Australian Labour Party's industrial policy for not returning enough rights to workers and for retaining the ABCC, describing the Rudd government’s Fair Work Australia <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> [...] "WorkChoices-lite".|$|R

25|$|In {{the early}} days of gaming, the idea of love and romance was used <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> plot point to urge the hero to {{complete}} the set of tasks put before him. Mario, hero of the Super Mario series of games, has Princess Peach to rescue from the main villain. Link and Princess Zelda from The Legend of Zelda series made gamers wonder why the two were not romantically together while rooting for the couple. Double Dragon features the protagonist Billy Lee, as he attempts to rescue his girlfriend (Maria) from his evil twin brother (Jimmy), leader of a sinister street gang. This era of game-playing was not well known for equal opportunity in gender roles.|$|E
25|$|During {{the night}} two events {{occurred}} {{that would force}} Pope to change his mind. A staff officer arrived from the Germantown position to report that a heavy force of cavalry had shelled the intersection before retreating. Fortunately for Lee and Stuart, Pope dismissed the cavalry <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> patrol. But when, hours later, two Union cavalrymen reported seeing a large mass of infantry marching east down the Little River Turnpike, Pope realized that his army was in danger. He countermanded actions preparing for an attack and directed the army to retreat from Centreville to Washington; he also sent {{out a series of}} infantry probes up the roads that Lee might use to reach his troops as they pulled back.|$|E
25|$|As {{with many}} Victorian era {{football}} facilities, the Saltergate {{end of the}} ground spent many years <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> sloping mound. In the early 1920s, the construction of Cross Street {{at the opposite end}} of the ground led to earth and remnants of the cinder running track being used to build up the banking of the Kop. Terraced steps were cut into the cinder in the summer of 1931. At the turn of the 1950s, this was replaced by concrete terracing, cut to go below pitch level. Metal crush barriers were also fitted, replacing the old wooden ones. The Kop was roofed in 1960/1, at a cost of £10,000, paid for entirely by fundraising by the supporters club.|$|E

25|$|Massachusetts has 351 {{cities and}} towns. Every {{part of the}} state is within an {{incorporated}} city or town, but many towns include large rural areas. The state's 14 counties have few government functions and serve <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> judicial districts.|$|R

25|$|At the Columbia University, Stublić started {{training}} in earnest {{for the first}} time, and improved her 5000-meter results by two minutes {{in the first two}} years. In the third and fourth year of college, she switched from 5000 meters to 10,000 meters and steeplechase. She {{was a member of the}} women's cross country team that won conference championship titles in each of the four years she competed. Stublić's team qualified for the NCAA Nationals in cross country every year she ran for them, and she earned the All-American honors once, in her senior year, placing 33rd. Despite her athletic achievements, at that time Stublić's primary interest was art – music, poetry and drawing – and she still saw running <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> hobby.|$|E
25|$|The Nootka Crisis of 1789 almost {{led to a}} {{war between}} Britain and Spain, when Britain {{rejected}} Spanish claims to lands in British Columbia and Spain seized some British ships. The crisis was resolved by the Nootka Convention, which provided that the northwest coast {{would be open to}} traders of both Britain and Spain, that the captured British ships would be returned and an indemnity paid. It was a victory for Britain and Spain effectively withdrew from the North Pacific. It transferred its claims in the region to the United States in the Adams-Onís Treaty of 1819. Today, Spain's Alaskan legacy endures <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> few place names, among these the Malaspina Glacier and the towns of Valdez and Cordova.|$|E

50|$|Brownies {{appear as}} small, leather-skinned humans and enjoy helping out with {{domestic}} chores around the home.
