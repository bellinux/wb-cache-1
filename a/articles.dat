5|$|The {{origins of}} the Statement that {{eventually}} became the Forty-Two <b>Articles</b> are equally obscure. As early as December 1549, the archbishop was demanding from his bishops subscription to certain doctrinal <b>articles.</b> In 1551 Cranmer presented a version of {{a statement to the}} bishops, but its status remained ambiguous. Cranmer did not devote much effort into developing the <b>articles,</b> most likely due to work on the canon law revision. He became more interested once the hope for an ecumenical council began to fade. By September 1552, draft versions of the <b>articles</b> were being worked on by Cranmer and John Cheke, his scholarly friend who was commissioned to translate them into Latin. When the Forty-Two <b>Articles</b> were finally published in May 1553, the title-page declared that the <b>articles</b> were agreed upon by the Convocation and were published by the authority of the king. This was not in fact the case and the mistake was likely caused by miscommunications between the archbishop and the Privy Council. Cranmer complained about this to the council, but the authorities responded by noting that the <b>articles</b> were developed {{during the time of the}} Convocation—hence evading a direct answer. The council gave Cranmer the unfortunate task of requiring subscription to the <b>articles</b> from the bishops, many of whom opposed them and pointed out the anomaly of the title-page. It was while Cranmer was carrying out this duty that events unfolded that would render the subscriptions futile.|$|E
