40|$|Pair of grips for tensile and {{compressive}} {{test specimens}} operate at temperatures up to 1, 500 degrees F. Grips include wedges holding specimen inside furnace, where heated to uniform temperature. Hydraulic pistons drive wedges, {{causing them to}} exert clamping force. Hydraulic pistons and hydraulic fluid remain outside furnace, at room temperature. Cooling water flows through parts of grips to reduce heat transferred to external components. Advantages over older devices for gripping specimens in high-temperature tests; no need to drill holes in specimens, maintains constant gripping force on specimens, and heated to same temperature as that of specimen without risk of heating hydraulic fluid and <b>acuator</b> components...|$|E
40|$|To {{overcome}} {{the inability of}} the Tuned Mass Damper (TMD) system, which has linear properties and limitations on the weight, this paper suggests a multi story Semi-Active Tuned Mass Damper (SATMD) building system using a structure’s upper portion as the tuned mass damper and resettable actuator as a semi-active (SA) control device. For this purpose, it is proposed to segregate the building’s upper story(s) with rubber bearings, and employ SA resettable actuator and viscous damper to the story(s) of upper segment to lower structural elements. The optimal frequency tuning ratio and damping ratio is considered for large mass ratio, for which previously proposed equation was used and the practical optimal stiffness was allocated to the <b>acuator</b> stiffness and rubber bearing stiffness. 2 DOF model, including SATMD, is adopted to verify the principal efficacy of the suggested structural control concept and 6 and 12 story moment resisting benchmark frames are investigated to assess the viability and effectiveness of the system that aims at reducing the response of buildings to earthquakes. This research determines the feasibility, design methods and effectiveness of the proposed multi story SATMD building system by numerically analyzing and comparing the response with no control and passive TMD system...|$|E
40|$|Magnetorheological (MR) fluids {{can be used}} in {{a variety}} of smart {{semi-active}} systems. The MR damper shows an especially great potential to mitigate environmentally induced vibration and shocks. Another aspect of MR fluids is the construction of MR valve networks in conjunction with a hydraulic pump resulting in a fully active actuator. Conventional hydraulic pumps, however, are bulky, contain many moving parts, and do not scale favorably with decreasing size motivating development of high energy density piezohydraulic pumps. These devices are simple, have few moving parts and can be easily miniaturized to provide a compact, high energy density pressure source. The present study describes a prototype MR-piezo hybrid actuator that combines the piezopump and MR valve actuator concepts, resulting in a self-contained hydraulic actuation device without active electro-mechanical valves. Durability and miniaturization of the hybrid device are major advantages due to its low part count and few moving parts. An additional advantage is the ability to use the MR valve network in the <b>acuator</b> to achieve controllable damping. The design, construction and testing of a prototype MR-piezo hybrid actuator is described. The performance and efficiency of the device is derived using ideal, biviscous and Bingham-plastic representations of MR fluid behavior, and is evaluated with experimental measurements. This will provide a design tool to develop an actuator for a specific application. The prototype actuator achieved an output velocity of 5. 34 mm/sec against a mass load of 5. 15 kg with a piezopump weighing 300 gm...|$|E
40|$|In robotics, {{differential}} {{mechanisms are}} widely used when lightweightness and compactness are a requisite for the robot design. Moreover, the last decades have seen the rise of (variable) compliant <b>acuators</b> as important elements to perform safe interaction and dynamic tasks. This paper introduces a Variable Stiffness Differential Drive (VSDD), i. e., a differential transmissions with variable stiffness actuators (VSAs), and presents a dynamic analysis. The analysis shows that, when variable stiffness actuators are used in coupled differential transmissions, the allowable stiffness range at {{the output of the}} system depends on the position of the springs inside the device. In particular, independent output joint stiffness can be obtained by dislocating the actuation from the elastic elements...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new control architecture for fast, accurate force control of antagonistic pairs of {{shape memory alloy}} wires. The main components are: a differential-mode controller which controls the output force, an anti-slack mechanism, a rapid-heating mechanism and an anti-overload mechanism. The closed-loop response is fast and accurate, even {{in the presence of}} large external motion distur-bances. There is no sign of limit cycles, and the performance is unaf-fected by large load inertias. This paper also {{presents a}}n architecture for position control, in which a position feedback loop is added to the force control architecture. Experimental results show force con-trol accuracies as high as 1 mN in a 3 N range, force output rates as high as 50 N s 1, and highly accurate position control with steady-state errors below the resolution of the position encoder.

40|$|Multiferroics and magnetoelectric {{materials}} show interesting scientific {{challenges and}} technnologial applications in sensors, <b>acuators</b> and data storage. In {{view of the}} fact that only a small number of materials show this kind of properties, exhaustive research activity is being pursued towards the development of new composite materials. Multiferroic nanocomposites films composed of piezoelectric poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and magnetostrictive nano-size CoFe 2 O 4, NiFe 2 O 4 or NiZnFe 2 O 4 ferrites were prepared by a solution method. Those ferrite nanoparticles have the ability to nucleate the electroactive -phase of the polymer, providing in this way an easy route for the preparation of magnetoelectric particulate composites. The fact that the different nanoparticles promotes different amount of -phase nucleation for different concentrations of nanoparticles indicates that filler size is not the most important parameter determining phase nucleation but the filler-matrix surface interaction. Further, when the polymer-ferrite surface interaction is modified through surfactation, the electroactive phase is not nucleated.

40|$|This {{research}} aims to {{the development}} of an externally powered myoelectric (EMG) controlled robot hand fit for daily life activities. The myoelectric upper limb prosthesis is a function recovery device for the hand, which demands lightweight, high torque, many degrees of freedom, and viscoelasticity. The hand uses twisting spring wire drive system for drive system, and two wires in parallel configuration for the interference driven joint mechanisms for articulated mechanism. 1. Twisting Spring Wire Drive System Proposition technique generates movement by twisting a wire by the motor loaded outside the hand(Fig. 1). The motors loaded outside the hand, so it’s possible to make the hand light. And the wire has the nature of spring by twisting double wires, so this can expect the realization of viscoelasticity actuator. 2. Joint mechanisms The hand uses the wire driven mechanism at the fingers (Fig. 2 (a)) imitating the human hand structure. The wire W 1 passes through the wire guide that corresponds to the fiber sheath, so the wire W 1 can curl not only the DIP joint and PIP joint but also the MP joint. This mechanism allows us to provide MP joint with a high grip power. And, we developed an interference drive joint mechanism at the wrist joint and the thumb MP joint. Fig. 2 (b) shows the mechanism developed in our laboratory with oil less bearing for the rotating axis forming a guide for the <b>acuators</b> wires, resulting in high torque...|$|R
