500|$|At 23:14, Muirhead-Gould {{ordered all}} ships to observe {{blackout}} conditions. Just after 23:30, {{he set off}} on a barge towards the boom net, to make a personal inspection. The Admiral reached Lolita at about midnight and indicated to her crew {{that he did not}} take the reports of enemy submarines seriously, reportedly saying: [...] "What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>all</b> playing at, {{running up and down the}} harbour dropping depth charges and talking about enemy subs in the harbour? There's not one to be seen." [...] The crew reiterated that a submarine had been seen, but Muirhead-Gould remained unconvinced and before he left, added sarcastically: [...] "If you see another sub, see if the captain has a black beard. I'd like to meet him." ...|$|E
500|$|During the Iraq War Jackson {{admitted}} {{that the war was}} putting the service under strain, but called the claim that the Army was [...] "at breaking point", [...] "nonsense". Jackson was dismissive of claims that the Army was under-equipped, recalling his conversation with a soldier: [...] "There's a bit of a fuss going on about boots and bog rolls and whatnot. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>all</b> right for boots?" [...] He later conceded that this could be seen as [...] "cavalier", and that he [...] "had no intention of belittling the gravity of the situation", but that he [...] "didn't want {{to send a message to}} the enemy that we were in any way not ready". Known for speaking his mind, Jackson attracted media attention towards the end of his tenure as CGS in 2006, when he criticised Norman Kember for Kember's apparent lack of gratitude to the soldiers who freed him from Iraqi kidnappers.|$|E

I {{went over to}} one lady who was {{unconscious}} and said <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>all</b> right and someone said 'you just get away from them', then I thought with the other fellas on the road, you know, I {{better get out of}} here.
