40|$|Pelvic {{bones from}} {{the right side of}} twenty five beef {{carcasses}} were collected and analyzed to characterize the variation in bone shape. Two heifer and two steer carcasses were selected from five 100 -pound weight ranges, starting at 600 lb. Aitch and hip bone pelvic pieces were weighed and 12 linear measurements collected. Weight of the hip bone, <b>aitch</b> <b>bone,</b> and total pelvic bone increasedwith increasing carcass weight. <b>Aitch</b> <b>bone</b> and pelvic lengths were longerfor steers than heifers. Location of the cut separating beef sides had a major impact on shape of the exposed <b>aitch</b> <b>bone.</b> Inconsistencies in carcass splitting make it difficult to use differences in <b>aitch</b> <b>bone</b> shape as anatomical landmarks for altered carcass fabrication...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1982 Electrical {{stimulation}} of beef carcasses (n= 18) {{did not cause}} {{a significant reduction in}} microbial population on three different sampling positions immediately following slaughter. In constrast, significant microbial reduction (P > 0. 05) was found at position 2 (muscle above <b>aitch</b> <b>bone),</b> but not at position 1 (inside of neck) or position 3 (fat on outside of round) after 72 h. of chilling storage. Nina bacterial species from eight different genera were inoculated on three different agar media which varied in electrical conductivity. Electrical {{stimulation of}} these media caused a reduction in recoveries of microorganisms under various voltage and time treatments. Spore-forming bacteria were the most resistant to the electrical treatment. Among the non-spore-formers, gram negative bacteria were more resistant to electrical treatment than gram positive bacteria. Also, microorganisms inoculated on the lower resistance medium A revealed greater reduction in the recoveries than that of the other media with higher resistance. A five log number reduction (99. 999...|$|E
40|$|Tenderness is {{the most}} {{important}} characteristic to define acceptability of products by consumers. In this paper three different methods, Calcium infusion (Ca), Very Fast Chilling (VFC) and pelvic suspension hanging from <b>aitch</b> <b>bone</b> (PS) or the Achilles tendon (AT) are applied in pre-rigor phase on Maremmana meat. Ca injection has reported the lowest shear force on cooked meat compared to control group (5. 09 vs. 16. 33 kg) instead VFC group has underlined intermediate values. Pelvic hanging has shown significant difference on shear force and sarcomere length on Longissimus thoracis muscle (4. 13 vs. 8. 11 kg and 1. 63 and 2. 04 μm respectively for WBS and sarcomere length in PS and AT); further in Biceps femoralis we have found a lowest collagen content (4. 33 vs. 4. 79 g/ 100 g for PS and AT). In conclusion these methods could influence tenderization processes even if some processes, that could lower the effect of these practices, are still unclear...|$|E
40|$|The two {{antibiotics}} fed {{in these}} four trials were Aureomycin and Terramycin HCl {{at the level}} of 10 mg. per pound of total ration. Lot 1 pigs were the controls receiving the basal ration; Lot 2, basal plus 10 mg. of Aureomycin HCl per pound of total feed; Lot 3, basal plus 10 mg. of Terramycin HCl per pound of total feed. Fifty-two pigs were used in the four trials carried out from November 1952 to October 1954. The pigs were slaughtered at the college laboratory when they reached approximately 225 pounds. The stomach and intestinal contents were weighed and subtracted from the live slaughter weight to determine the net body weight. All carcasses were weighed after 48 hours chill at 34 ̊F. The length of body was measured from the anterior portion of the first rib to the anterior portion of the <b>aitch</b> <b>bone.</b> The back fat is the average of the three measurements-opposite the first rib, last rib, and last lumbar vertebra. The primal cuts are the skinned ham, trimmed loin, N. Y. style shoulder, and the trimmed belly. The lean cuts are the skinned ham, trimmed loin, and N. Y. style shoulder. The primal and lean-cut yields were based on net body weight and chilled carcass weight. The carcasses were graded, using the average back fat thickness and length as criteria for grades. These grades are based on the official U. S. Standards for Grades of Pork Carcasses, which are choice 1, 2, 3; medium; and cull...|$|E
