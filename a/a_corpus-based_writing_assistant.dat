40|$|The {{analysis}} of obligatory or formulaic XVS structures — as in “Here comes the sun” or “Now {{is the time}} to solve our problems” — has been neglected in the literature since {{it has been argued that}} there seems to be no linguistic variation involved in the use of these types of syntactic constructions. Here, I defend the view that obligatory XVS structures are productive, highly structured constructions which are worthy of serious linguistic investigation. On the basis of <b>a</b> <b>corpus-based</b> {{analysis of}} <b>written</b> and spoken texts, it is argued that the different obligatory XVS types distinguished in the literature are clear instances of constructions as understood in the Construction Grammar framework. Despite their formal and functional dissimilarities, the article shows that these XVS structures still relate to one another in systematic and predictable ways, and are in fact grouped in relation to a unit in the schematic network which is naturally most salient — the prototype — and form with it a family of nodes which are extensions from the prototype — in the system. In sum, the analysis here will show that obligatory XVS structures are constructions which form an interconnected, structured system or network and are best understood with reference to different forms of inheritance.

40|$|<b>A</b> <b>corpus-based</b> {{knowledge}} representation system {{consists of a}} large collection of disparate knowledge fragments or schemas, and a rich set of statistics computed over the corpus. We argue that by collecting such a corpus and computing the appropriate statistics, <b>corpus-based</b> representation offers <b>an</b> alternative to traditional {{knowledge representation}} for a broad class of applications. The key advantage of corpusbased representation is that we avoid the laborious process of building a (often brittle) knowledge base.

40|$|We {{manually}} designed {{rules for}} a backchannel (BC) prediction model based on pitch and pause information. In short, the model predicts a BC {{when there is}} a pause of a certain length that is preceded by a falling or rising pitch. This model was validated against the Dutch IFADV Corpus in <b>a</b> <b>corpus-based</b> evaluation method. The results showed that our model performs slightly better than another well-known rule-based BC prediction model that uses only pitch information. We observed that the length of a pause preceding a BC is one of the important features in this model, next to the duration of the pitch slope {{at the end of an}} utterance. Further, we discuss implications of <b>a</b> <b>corpus-based</b> approach to BC prediction evaluation. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{concerns}} <b>a</b> <b>corpus-based</b> {{study on}} LSP collocational variation, {{a phenomenon that}} is largely underrepresented in bilingual LSP lexicographic resources. Terminological variation on the formal (i. e. paradigmatic/syntagmatic) and semantic level is analysed in texts belonging to the technical domain (building and energy subfield). With {{the help of a}} balanced monolingual LSP corpus, variation is observed as a context-dependent phenomenon, with context interpreted as the combination of topic, genre-specific and communicative functions related to the LSP vertical dimension. A model entry from an English-Italian technical dictionary shows how the treatment of LSP collocations as autonomous terms and <b>a</b> <b>corpus-based</b> description of their variational behaviour can provide users with a means for efficiently tackling text production tasks, both in the native and in the foreign language...|$|R

Taking <b>a</b> <b>corpus-based</b> approach, the data were analyzed not only as a whole, but also with regard to synchronic variation, by carrying out concordance analyses of keywords which occurred within tabloid and broad-sheet newspapers, and diachronic change, albeit mainly approached from an unusual angle, by investigating consistent collocates and frequencies of specific terms over time. The analyses point to a number of (mainly negative) categories of representation, the existence and development of nonsensical terms (e. g., illegal refugee), and media confusion and conflation of definitions of the four terms under examination. The paper concludes by critically discussing the extent to which <b>a</b> <b>corpus-based</b> methodological stance can inform critical discourse analysis...|$|R
