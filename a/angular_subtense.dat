50|$|Image {{resolution}} can {{be measured}} in various ways. Resolution quantifies how close lines can be to each other and still be visibly resolved. Resolution units can be tied to physical sizes (e.g. lines per mm, lines per inch), to the overall size of a picture (lines per picture height, also known simply as lines, TV lines, or TVL), or to <b>angular</b> <b>subtense.</b> Line pairs are often used instead of lines; a line pair comprises a dark line and an adjacent light line. A line is either a dark line or a light line. A resolution of 10 lines per millimeter means 5 dark lines alternating with 5 light lines, or 5 line pairs per millimeter (5 LP/mm). Photographic lens and film resolution are most often quoted in line pairs per millimeter.|$|E
5000|$|Bridgman's {{theory was}} criticized because we measure [...] "length" [...] {{in various ways}} (e.g. it's {{impossible}} to use a measuring rod {{if we want to}} measure the distance to the Moon), [...] "length" [...] logically isn't one concept but many, some concepts requiring knowledge of geometry. Each concept is to be defined by the measuring operations used. Another example is the radius of a sphere, obtaining different values depending on the way it is measured (say, in metres and in millimeters). Bridgman said the concept is defined on the measurement. So the criticism is that we could potentially end up with endless concepts, each defined by the things that measured the concept, such as angle of sighting, day of the solar year, <b>angular</b> <b>subtense</b> of the moon, etc. which were gathered together, some astronomical observations taken over a period of thousands of years.|$|E
40|$|Of {{the three}} basic color perceptions, hue, brightness, and colorfulness, hue has no {{relative}} version, but brightness has lightness, and colorfulness has chroma and saturation. Correlates of chroma {{are widely used}} in color difference formulae, but saturation currently plays little part in color science and technology. This is perhaps because in many industries flat samples are viewed in uniform lighting {{for the evaluation of}} color differences, and in this case chroma is the appropriate contributor for samples of small <b>angular</b> <b>subtense.</b> For samples of large <b>angular</b> <b>subtense,</b> however, a correlate of saturation may be more appropriate to use. In the real world, it is common for solid objects to be seen in directional lighting; in these circumstances saturation is a more useful percept than chroma because saturation remains constant in shadows. In imaging, artists and computer-graphics operators make extensive use of series of colors of constant saturation. In optical imaging, saturation can be an important percept in large dark areas. Recent experimental work has provided a much improved correlate of saturation...|$|E

40|$|Individual fascicles of retinal axons {{were labeled}} in the {{goldfish}} tectum with horseradish peroxi-dase (HRP).

Labeled cells were found in a partial half anulus in ventral hemiretina, centered on the optic disk. The distance of the partial anulus from the disk depended on which tectal fascicle had been labeled; the more rostrocentral the fascicle, the smaller was the annular radius.

40|$|The avian retina {{possesses}} one of {{the most}} diverse complements of photoreceptor types among vertebrates but little is known about their spatial distribution. Here we used retinal wholemounts and stereological methods to present the first complete maps of the topographic distribution of rods and cones in four species of Australian passerines with diverse trophic specializations. All species studied have one central and one temporal rod-free zone. In the insectivorous yellow-rumped thornbill, the central rod-free zone is unusually large, occupying ∼ 17 % (56 °) of the retinal area (<b>angular</b> <b>subtense),</b> whereas in nectarivorous and frugivorous species it represents only ∼ 0. 1 % (5 - 7 °) to 0. 3 % (10 °) of the retinal area (<b>angular</b> <b>subtense).</b> In contrast, the temporal rod-free zone varies little between species (∼ 0. 02 - 0. 4 %; 2 - 10 °). In all species, rods follow a pronounced dorsoventral gradient with highest densities in the ventral retina. The topographic distribution of cones is concentric and reveals a central fovea and a temporal area. In the yellow-rumped thornbill, cone densities form an extended plateau surrounding the fovea, beyond which densities fall rapidly towards the retinal periphery. For the other species, cone densities decline gradually along a foveal to peripheral gradient. Estimates of spatial resolving power calculated using cone peak densities are higher in the central fovea (19 - 41 cycles/degree) than in the temporal area (9 - 15 cycles/degree). In conclusion, we suggest that the unusual organization of the rod-free zone and the distinct topographic distribution of rods and cones correlate with specific ecological needs for enhanced visual sensitivity and spatial resolution in these birds. 22 page(s...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to define the spatial {{frequencies}} that underlie judgments of Landolt C orientation under test conditions designed to favor either the magnocellular (MC) or parvocellular (PC) pathway. Contrast thresholds of two observers were measured for briefly presented Landolt Cs of four sizes, using steady- and pulsed-pedestal paradigms to bias performance toward the MC and PC pathways, respectively. Contrast thresholds were derived from a two-alternative forced-choice orientation judgment task using the QUEST procedure. The Landolt Cs were either low-pass or high-pass Gaussian filtered with a range of cutoff object spatial frequencies (cycles per letter) to limit their frequency content. Center object frequencies were derived from plots of log contrast threshold for orientation judgments vs. log filter cutoff object frequency. The function relating center object frequency to Landolt C <b>angular</b> <b>subtense</b> was nonlinear on log–log coordinates for both the steady- and pulsed-pedestal paradigms, indicating that different object frequencies were used to judge Landolt C orientation at different optotype sizes. However, the function was substantially steeper under the pulsed-pedestal than under the steady-pedestal paradigm, such that a large change in optotype size produced a relatively small change in retinal spatial frequency (cycles per degree). The pattern of results is consistent with previously reported differences between the spatial contrast sensitivity functions of the inferred MC and PC pathways...|$|E

Subjects judged incremental changes in the vertical distance separating a pair of horizontal lines. For the objective judgments (in cm}, the angle subtended by the target separation decreased with increasing depth consistent with the natural geometry of physical objects. For the angular judgments (in arc min), the angular separation did not change with disparity. For separations subtending an angle c 10 arc min, objective thresholds were considerably higher than angular thresholds, indicating that size constancy does not function well at small scales. At larger scales (> 20 arc min), the Weber fractions for angular and objective thr~olds were nearly equal (- 6 %) {{for two of the}} three subjects.

To study its time course and selectivity for {{the sign of the}} imposed defocus. MethodsContrast adaptation, CA (here referred to as any change in supra-threshold contrast sensitivity) was induced by presenting a movie to the subjects on a computer screen at 1 m distance for 10 min, while the right eye was defocused by a trial lens (+ 4 D (n= 25); − 4 D (n= 10); − 2 D (n= 11 subjects). The PowerRefractor was used to track accommodation binocularly. Contrast sensitivity at threshold was measured by a method of adjustment with a Gabor patch of 1 deg <b>angular</b> <b>subtense,</b> filled with 3. 22 cyc/deg sine wave grating presented on a computer screen at 1 m distance on gray background (33 cd/m 2). Supra-threshold contrast sensitivity was quantified by an interocular contrast matching task, in which the subject had to match the contrast of the sine wave grating seen with the right eye with the contrast of a grating with fixed contrast of 0. 1. Results(1) Contrast sensitivity thresholds were not lowered by previous viewing of defocused movies. (2) By wearing positive lenses, the supra-threshold contrast sensitivity in the right eye was raised by about 30 % and remained elevated for at least 2 min until baseline was reached after about 5 min. (3) CA was induced only by positive, but not by negative lenses, even after the distance of the computer screen was taken into account (1 m, equivalent to + 1 D). In five subjects, binocular accommodation was tracked over the full adaptation period. Accommodation appeared to focus the eye not wearing a lens, but short transient switches in focus to the lens wearing eye could not be entirely excluded. ConclusionsTransient contrast adaptation was found at 3. 22 cyc/deg when positive lenses were worn but not with negative lenses. This asymmetry is intriguing. While it may represent an epiphenomenon of physiological optics, further experiments are necessary to determine whether it could also trace back to differences in CA with defocus of different sign...|$|E
40|$|Jumping spiders have {{a highly}} {{specialized}} visual {{system for the}} detection and analysis of prey. The retina {{of each of the}} anterior medial eyes has a compact, high-resolution, three-dimensional array of receptors that can scan, saccade, and engage in slow tracking. Qualitative study, computer-controlled data collection, and randomized stimulus presentation were used in an electrophysiological study of the properties of high-order visual neurons. Receptive field mapping revealed neurons with well-defined, positionally stable, receptive fields. Some of these receptive fields had an angular extent greater than that of the static retinal array. The stability with respect to the cephalothorax and the angular extent of these receptive fields suggest integration of retinal information and eye position, to yield position constancy. Most neurons had receptive fields of constant <b>angular</b> <b>subtense</b> as the distance to the tangent screen varied. Some neurons have receptive fields that remain relatively constant in absolute physical size (changing in angular extent) as screen distance varies. Such size constant cells may be useful in assessing prey suitability. These characteristics require integration of depth information. These cells are driven monocularly, ruling out disparity cues. Jumping spiders do not use muscular accommodation. Instead, the retina has a layered, tiered structure. Depth of focus cues are probably the source of this information, as hypothesized previously by Land (1969 a). Quantitative assessment of velocity preferences revealed cells with medial eye input responding optimally to velocities of 16 °/second, and other cells responding to higher velocities. Tuning for direction of movement orientation was also observed and quantified. The degree of tuning correlates with a measure of latency. Results are also presented in a separate section from a primate behavior study on the vocalizations of the owl monkey, in which the vocal repertoire of two populations was recorded. Field recordings were analyzed for temporal and spectral properties of both the vocalizations and the acoustic context. We found no systematic variations of calls between populations, except for the number of syllables in the loud call. We examined behavioral context and probable function of inter and intragroup vocalizations. We found that the loud call may carry gender information, with a bimodal distribution of the spectral bandwidth of the fundamental.

40|$|AbstractObjective. The lag of {{accommodation}} which occurs in most human subjects during reading {{has been proposed}} to explain the association between reading and myopia. However, the measured lags are variable among different published studies and current knowledge on its magnitude rests largely on measurements with the Canon R- 1 autorefractor. Therefore, we have measured it with another technique, eccentric infrared photorefraction (the PowerRefractor), and studied {{how it can be}} modified. Methods. Particular care was taken to ensure correct calibration of the instrument. Ten young adult subjects were refracted both in the fixation axis of the right eye and from the midline between both eyes, while they read text both monocularly and binocularly at 1. 5, 2, 3, 4 and 5 D distance (“group 1 ”). A second group of 10 subjects (“group 2 ”), measured from the midline between both eyes, was studied to analyze the effects of binocular vs monocular vision, addition of + 1 or + 2 D lenses, and of letter size. Spherical equivalents (SE) were analyzed in all cases. Results. The lag {{of accommodation}} was variable among subjects (standard deviations among groups and viewing distances ranging from 0. 18 to 1. 07 D) but was significant when the measurements were done in the fixation axis (0. 35 D at 3 D target distance to 0. 60 D at 5 D with binocular vision; p< 0. 01 or better all cases). Refracting from the midline between both eyes tended to underestimate the lag of accommodation although this was significant only at 5 D (ANOVA: p< 0. 0001, post hoc t-test: p< 0. 05). There was a small improvement in accommodation precision with binocular compared to monocular viewing but significance was reached only for the 5 D reading target (group 1 ––lags for a 3 / 4 / 5 D target: 0. 35 vs 0. 41 D/ 0. 48 vs 0. 47 D/ 0. 60 vs 0. 66 D, ANOVA: p< 0. 0001, post hoc t-test: p< 0. 05; group 2 –– 0. 29 vs 0. 12 D, 0. 33 vs 0. 16 D, 0. 23 vs − 0. 31 D, ANOVA: p< 0. 0001, post hoc t-test: p< 0. 05). Adjusting the letter height for constant <b>angular</b> <b>subtense</b> (0. 2 deg) induced scarcely more accommodation than keeping letter size constantly at 3. 5 mm (ANOVA: p< 0. 0001, post hoc t-test: n. s.). Positive trial lenses reduced the lag of accommodation under monocular viewing conditions and even reversed it with binocular vision. Conclusions. After consideration of possible sources of measurement error, the lag of accommodation measured with photorefraction at 3 D (0. 41 D SE monocular and 0. 35 D SE binocular) was in the range of published values from the Canon R- 1 autorefractor. With the measured lag, simulations of the retinal images for a diffraction limited eye suggest surprisingly poor letter contrast on the retina...|$|E
