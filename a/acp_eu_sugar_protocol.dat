40|$|To {{overcome}} widespread rural poverty, raise {{incomes and}} improve food security, Swaziland {{has begun a}} process of commercialisation of its subsistence farms. This strategy is based upon extending irrigation onto customary tenured land in the semi-arid lowveld and converting land to sugar cane production. The paper demonstrates that if farmers adopt an irrigated home garden {{as a supplement to}} the cash crop, then food security may be improved. However, changes to the <b>EU's</b> <b>Sugar</b> <b>Protocol</b> is undermining the financial viability of the participating farmers' associations and compromising the ability of the Komati Downstrean Development Project to improve living standards in the area. It argues that EU aid provided to offset changes to the <b>EU</b> <b>Sugar</b> <b>Protocol</b> should be targeted at the most vulnerable to those changes.

40|$|The Komati Downstream Development Project (KDDP), {{based upon}} the Maguga Dam has enabled 6, 000 {{hectares}} of semiarid lowveld, in a region with low and highly variable rainfall to be converted from subsistence to irrigated commercial farming, mainly of sugar cane. This has transformed the Swazi sugar industry from one dominated by {{a small number of}} large-scale commercial estates to one where more than 1, 500 previously impoverished small-scale Swazi farmers have been able to enter the industry by joining farmers’ associations and creating communally managed farms. Recent changes to the <b>EU’s</b> <b>Sugar</b> <b>Protocol</b> have undermined the financial viability of the KDDP farms and undermined food security, especially for the poorest, due to the cut in sugar prices. However, some farmers’ associations have opted to keep some of their land as irrigated home gardens, rather than convert all their land to sugar cane. This model has improved food security at a time of low sugar prices and points to a more sustainable way of using water from large scale dams than the conventional model. It is argued that the EU should target support to members of the KDDP who have taken out largescale loans to pay for the in-field infrastructure and encourage all farmers’ associations to adopt the food garden model. This would enable them to continue to benefit from the irrigation through improved production of subsistence crops, whilst they diversify their commercial production into novel markets...|$|R
40|$|Since Independence, the {{contribution}} of Swazi smallholder farmers to sugar production has grown greatly. This is {{in part due to}} a change in the political support that the farmers have received from the Swazi state. Initially viewed with suspicion and as a challenge to royal hegemony, smallholder sugar cane production is now seen as a crucial means of overcoming rural poverty in Swaziland’s poorest region, the semi-arid lowveld. Provision of irrigation water is vital for successful sugar cane production on the co-operatively managed farms that are necessary to achieve the economies of scale in irrigated sugar production. Threats to their profitability arising from increasingly volatile markets facing Swaziland’s sugar industry since changes to the <b>EU</b> <b>Sugar</b> <b>Protocol</b> in 2005 undermine their capacity for co-operative governance and challenge their long-term viability. EU support to facilitate adjustment to the new sugar market has led to increased sugar cane production by smallholders. The paper argues that the two big dam projects that {{are at the heart of}} the new irrigation regions are politically ‘too big to fail’, which has committed the Swazi state to the long-term support of smallholders to ensure repayment of loans to build the dams. At the same time, the success of commercial small-scale sugar cane production poses challenges to the Swazi model of customary land tenure. Although emblematic of autocratic royal power, it also – in the processes of land and water development for commercial smallholder sugar cane production – suggests limits to how that power may be deployed in the changing relationships between Swazi elites and their corporate partners and the diverse classes of rural stakeholders...|$|R

40|$|The European {{agricultural}} {{market has been}} criticized for its heavy regulations and subsidization. The sugar market {{is one of the most}} regulated ones; however, this will change radically in 2017 when the current system of production quotas will end. The aim of this paper is to present the basic characteristics of the <b>EU</b> quota <b>sugar</b> market. The analysis identifies the main drivers of <b>EU</b> <b>sugar</b> market and their position within the <b>EU</b> <b>sugar</b> market. The paper identifies especially those drivers/companies/alliances which take control over the <b>EU</b> <b>sugar</b> production realized under the quota production system. The paper also highlights the level of <b>EU</b> <b>sugar</b> market concentration and also identifies those countries and companies which are the main leaders in the sugar production area realized under the quota system.

These multinational alliances are also in control of the production capacities of their subsidiaries. In most countries, this causes serious problems as the given quota is controlled by one or two producers only. The <b>EU</b> <b>sugar</b> market is extremely concentrated especially if we take into consideration the location of each alliance’s headquarters.

40|$|In a hard-hitting report {{released}} on the August 22 nd 2002, Oxfam UK criticised the <b>EU</b> <b>sugar</b> regime for destroying livelihoods {{in developing countries}} such as Mozambique (not a traditional beneficiary of ACP sugar preferences, although a recent beneficiary of EBA sugar access). While recognising the benefits gained by ACP countries from the existing <b>EU</b> <b>sugar</b> regime, the Oxfam report highlighted the anomaly {{of one of the}} least efficient sugar producers being one of the world's leading refined sugar exporters. The report argues that the <b>EU's</b> <b>sugar</b> export regime encourages the supply of high cost <b>EU</b> <b>sugar</b> to the world market (with the benefit of export refunds) in ways which depress the world market price and undermine the development of competitive sugar production and value added sugar processing in developing countries. The report also highlight the exceptionally high profits generated by sugar sector millers that are virtual monopoly producers in many EU member states. The case of British Sugar in the UK which, {{as a result of the}} current <b>EU</b> <b>sugar</b> regime, makes exceptionally high profits compared to other food-sector enterprises in the same corporate family, was highlighted. Oxfam's immediate call was for an end to subsidised <b>EU</b> <b>sugar</b> exports and for additional market access for LDC and ACP suppliers. The web site of the Sugar Traders Associations of the United Kingdom maintained that this demand was not 'inconsistent with keeping a higher price in Europe than on the world market in order to permit remunerative prices for sugar growers'. Comment: Oxfam's call to end subsidised exports needs to be seen against the background of the CAP mid-term review's renewed emphasis on moving over to an extended system of de-coupled farm support, which would cover a wide range of products and leave farmers involved in the scheme free to choose which crops to grow depending on market signals. Such an ultimate objective would inevitably require a substantial reduction in the <b>EU</b> <b>sugar</b> price, perhaps by amounts similar to those currently being proposed in the rice sector. While there is no suggestion that sugar should be included in this multi-product system in the short term, beyond 2007 it is evident that the European Commission would like to see sugar included in this single multi-product scheme of de-coupled farm support. The web site of the Sugar Traders Association of the UK draws an analogy between future developments in the <b>EU</b> <b>sugar</b> sector and current proposals for reform of the EU rice regime. With an established timetable for the phasing in of duty free access for least-developed-country sugar exports and a challenge to the <b>EU</b> <b>sugar</b> regime in the WTO being mounted which would limit the EU's capacity to dispose of sugar on world markets with the benefit of export refunds, an acute market situation similar to that currently faced on the EU rice market could in due course emerge in the <b>EU</b> <b>sugar</b> market.

He called on Brazil and Australia to take account of the vital interests of the ACP countries and to withdraw their challenge to the <b>EU</b> <b>sugar</b> regime. Comment: While successful Brazilian and Australian challenges in the WTO would compel the EU to reform the sugar regime, this is by no means the only factor increasing pressure for reform of the <b>EU</b> <b>sugar</b> sector. The sector is now out of step with the broad trajectory for CAP reform, and bringing it into line is a mounting imperative.

However, this trajectory for reform in the sugar sector is likely to occur regardless of the outcome of the Brazilian and Australian WTO challenge.
