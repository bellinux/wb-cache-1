25|$|Hertzfeldt's student {{films in}} the 1990s were photographed on 16mm. From 1999 to 2011, Hertzfeldt photographed his films on a 35mm Richardson <b>animation</b> <b>camera</b> stand, {{believed}} to be the same camera that photographed many of the Peanuts cartoons in the 1960s and 1970s. Built in the late 1940s, it was reportedly one of the last remaining functioning cameras of its kind left in the world, and Hertzfeldt found it to be a crucial element in the creation of his films and their unique visuals.|$|E
500|$|During the {{post-production}} of the film, Bakshi {{found that}} the cost of the optical effect required to complete live-action scenes with animated characters was larger than the film's budget. In order to complete these scenes cost effectively, Bakshi and his camera man Ted C. Bemiller purchased a 35 mm camera to project the footage onto the glass under the <b>animation</b> <b>camera,</b> which was reflected onto where the animation was shot. The same technique was used for the rotoscoped scenes in The Lord of the Rings. According to Bakshi, [...] "The illusion I attempted to create was that of a completely live-action film. Making it work almost drove us crazy." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{underwater}} setting {{required the}} most special effects animation for a Disney animated feature since Fantasia in 1940. Effects animation supervisor Mark Dindal estimated {{that over a}} million bubbles were drawn for this film, {{in addition to the}} use of other processes such as airbrushing, backlighting, superimposition, and some computer animation. The artistic manpower needed for Mermaid required Disney to farm out most of the underwater bubble effects animation in the film to Pacific Rim Productions, a China-based firm with production facilities in Beijing. An attempt to use Disney's famed multiplane camera {{for the first time in}} years for quality [...] "depth" [...] shots failed because the machine was reputedly in dilapidated condition. The multiplane shots were instead photographed at an outside <b>animation</b> <b>camera</b> facility.|$|E

500|$|The Klingon Bird of Prey's {{cloaking}} device {{required a}} new effect. The original concept featured {{the layers of}} the ship forming up from the inside out, requiring a series of overlaid elements filmed with an Oxberry <b>animation</b> <b>camera.</b> ILM decided the effect appeared too [...] "animated-looking", and defied common sense: [...] "if there was a fanfare to decloaking, everyone would know the Klingons were coming and blow {{them out of the}} sky before they could even finish materializing," [...] Ralston said. The supervisor decided on subtlety, throwing color separations out of sync to create a blurry ripple effect. While simple, the sequence was more effective than the elaborate planned scene. Effects such as the destruction of the merchant ship were created using projected explosions, a technique perfected during the production of Return of the Jedi. Simulated zero-gravity explosions were filmed and reflected onto a card using the same motion control program used for the models. The result was an explosion that moved with the model.|$|E
2500|$|Starting {{in spring}} 1948, actors were filmed on large soundstages mouthing to a {{playback}} {{of the dialogue}} soundtrack. Disney had previously used live-action reference on Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Pinocchio, and Fantasia, {{but as part of}} an effort to keep the production cost down, the footage was used to check the plot, timing, and movement of the characters before animating it. The footage was then edited frame-by-frame onto large Photoshat sheets to duplicate, in which the animators found too restrictive as they were not allowed to imagine anything that the live actors did not present since that kind of experimentation might necessitate changes and cost more money. Additionally, the animators were instructed to draw from a certain directorial perspective to avoid difficult shots and angles. Frank Thomas explained, [...] "Anytime you'd think of another way of staging the scene, they'd say: 'We can't get the camera up there'! Well, you could get the <b>animation</b> <b>camera</b> up there! So you had to go with what worked well in live action." ...|$|E

[...] The environments of the game were praised for their realism and atmosphere, while character models and sound effects were rated as plain.

50|$|The film {{grew out}} of an earlier 1952 idea to promote tourism and sport in Yukon. In researching the film, Low and Koenig found some still photos in an Ottawa archive and tried to improve the panning method Low had {{employed}} on his 1955 visual arts documentary, Jolifou Inn. Low then discovered a much larger set of archival images of the Yukon Gold Rush, from photographer Eric A. Hegg's collection at the University of Washington in Seattle. The {{problem of how to}} animate the images via camera movement prior to the invention of computer-assisted <b>animation</b> <b>cameras</b> was resolved by Kroitor, who enlisted British mathematician Brian Salt to devise mathematical tables, and developed a device dubbed the 'Kroitorer' that allowed one to take single photos of the archival images as if photographing real-life scenes with a hand-held camera.|$|R
