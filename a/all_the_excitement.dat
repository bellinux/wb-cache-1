25|$|Ten {{days later}} the Police Commission adopted resolutions that no dancing would be allowed in any {{establishment}} of the district which served alcohol, that no women – employees or patrons – would be permitted in any saloon of the district, and that even electric signs would be forbidden. As a result, some drinking establishments fired their female employees and became straight saloons, while others closed their businesses. Some of the larger dance halls moved to other districts and managed to survive for several more years by masquerading as dance academies or closed dance halls, but they never regained their previous popularity. In 1917 the brothels were eventually closed down due to the Red Light Abatement Act, {{but by that time}} <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> of Terrific Street had long since vanished. Following the Red Light Abatement Act, prostitution zones and prostitutes were forced to outskirt areas such as the Tenderloin and Union Square as shopping centers took over.|$|E
25|$|A 'Welcome Home Ken Barrington' {{dance was}} {{arranged}} {{on his return}} from New Zealand where he was presented with a silver trophy to a standing ovation {{in front of the}} Surrey team. With the Ashes left in Australia the English press focused on Barrington's achievements and much was hoped for against the West Indies in 1963. Frank Worrell was the first full-time African-Caribbean cricketer to captain the West Indies and had a colourful team in the shape of Conrad Hunte, Rohan Kanhai, Gary Sobers, Basil Butcher, Lance Gibbs, Wes Hall and Charlie Griffith. Barrington made 110 not out against them for Surrey (the next highest score was 22) and joked that the Test match would be over in three days as England had gone 13 Tests against the West Indies without defeat. The First Test was a rude awakening as he was out for 16 and 8 and England lost by an innings. The Second Test at Lord's is one of the Great Tests; the West Indies made 301 and Barrington top scored with 80 in England's reply of 297. The West Indies were out for 229 in the second innings and England needed 234 to win. Barrington made 60, added 99 runs with Colin Cowdrey (whose arm was broken by Wes Hall) and Brian Close and hit Gibbs for a six followed by another onto the Lord's balcony. A last minute collapse left England 228/9 with Cowdrey returning to the crease in the last over with victory, defeat, a tie or a draw still possible. As it was Dave Allen played for a draw. Fred Trueman's 12/119 won the Third Test at Edgbaston, but Barrington made only 9 and 1, followed by 25, 32, 16 and 28 as Worrell's team won the last two Tests and the series 3–1. For <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> provided by the tourists it was a bad series for Barrington as {{this was the kind of}} cricket he had forsaken and his 275 runs (27.50) was less than what was expected of him. Even so, he published his first book with Phil Riley called Running in Hundreds, detailing his struggle to play for England and rise to fame.|$|E
500|$|The Brisbane Test {{was dubbed}} [...] "Meckiff's Test" [...] by the Australian media; {{speculation}} abounded that the bowler was being chosen {{so he could}} be no-balled as a public relations effort to promote Australia's anti-throwing credentials. Keith Miller described the left-armer's selection as having [...] "peppered this once drab-looking series into a curry hot-pot, with <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> and trimmings of an Alfred Hitchcock thriller". Miller further predicted that the umpires Egar and Lou Rowan would be having sleepless nights and predicted that the selectors would be biting their fingernails, adding that he hoped Meckiff was not being used as a scapegoat for the anti-throwing movement. Former Test leg spinner Bill O'Reilly—a correspondent for The Sydney Morning Herald—described the selection as [...] "one of the most fantastic somersaults in cricket policies in our time". As a close friend of the fast bowler, umpire Egar was in a difficult situation; the duo had won a pairs lawn bowling competition just a few months earlier. Nevertheless, the paceman and umpire socialised freely at the pre-match function.|$|E

After 37...a6, C.H.O'D.

2500|$|... "All {{the pages}} in Hecht’s papers are gripping, but the {{material}} from April 1964 is phenomenal, and it’s {{easy to imagine}} it {{as the basis for}} a classic Bond adventure. Hecht’s treatment of the romance element is powerful and convincing, even with the throwaway ending, {{but there is also a}} distinctly adult feel to the story. It has <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> and glamour you would expect from a Bond film, but is more suspenseful, and the violence is brutal rather than cartoonish." ...|$|E
