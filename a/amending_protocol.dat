50|$|Vasco Graça Moura, {{writer and}} {{former member of}} the European Parliament, the best-known of the agreement's detractors, {{maintains}} that the Second <b>Amending</b> <b>Protocol,</b> like any other international convention, only obligates its implementation in each country if it is ratified by all signatories, something that has not yet occurred. In other words, only after all countries ratify the treaty are they obligated to implement the changes domestically after ratification by three members. The rationality of a legal treaty that obliges a country to adopt another treaty if approved by third countries is disputed. This argument of the 2004 ratification's purported illegality was questioned by lawyer and European Parliament member Vital Moreira.|$|E

5000|$|Critics {{argue that}} studies {{based on the}} Israeli-made M-85, a {{different}} type of cluster munition, have indicated that items of unexploded ordnance, {{whether or not they are}} armed, remain a serious hazard to civilian populations. [...] However, this type of hazard does not apply to the MAT-120, as if in the rare instance the self-destruction mechanism fails, in approximately 15 minutes after impact the electrical charge in the capacitor bleeds out, therefore rendering the submunition's electronic fuse system inoperative, making the dud submunition totally inert, unless the capacitor is deliberately recharged from an outside source. <b>Amended</b> <b>Protocol</b> II relates to mines, booby traps and other devices and is not relevant to the legal status of cluster munitions.

In January 2009, Instalaza still had the MAT-120 cluster bomb in its online catalog.

After a public outcry highlighted by the media, Instalaza ended production of the MAT-120. However {{a note on the}} Instalaza website states that the weapon remains in the catalog as a mark of their technological prowess and states that the weapon is in compliance with <b>Amended</b> <b>Protocol</b> II of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons. According to the manufacturer, the weapons produces 0.0% 'hazardous duds' by ensuring that in case the munition was not functioning upon impact, it would attempt to self-destruct in 20 seconds. If this was not possible, self-deactivation would occur after 10 minutes.|$|R
40|$|To reduce {{toxicity}} in {{elderly patients}} with acute promyelocytic leukaemia, in 1997 the Gruppo Italiano Malattie Ematologiche Dell'Adulto (GIMEMA) started an <b>amended</b> <b>protocol</b> for patients aged > 60 years, {{with the same}} induction [all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) + idarubicin] as in younger patients, followed by a single consolidation course (idarubicin + cytarabine) and maintenance with intermittent ATRA. Among 60 enrolled patients, 54 (90 %) achieved haematological remission and six died during induction. Four additional patients died in complete remission (CR) from haemorrhage (2) and infection (2) prior or during consolidation therapy. Eleven patients relapsed at a median time of 17. 5 months from CR. The 5 -year overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS) and cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) rates were 76. 1 %, 64. 6 % and 27. 4 %, respectively. Univariate analysis identified a performance score (PS) = 2 as the only significant adverse prognostic factor for both OS (P = 0. 017) and DES (P = 0. 0003). Male sex had an unfavourable impact on DFS (P = 0. 021) and on CIR (P = 0. 019), but not on OS (P = 0. 234). In multivariate analysis for DFS, only PS = 2 retained prognostic significance (HR = 4. 5, P = 0. 0083). In conclusion, the <b>amended</b> GIMEMA <b>protocol</b> is effective, with similar relapse rate and inferior toxicity compared to the original AIDA 0493. However, considering the recent availability of effective new agents, a less aggressive approach should be tested in this setting...|$|R

5000|$|Some {{types of}} modern land mines are {{designed}} to self-destruct, or chemically render themselves inert {{after a period of}} weeks or months to reduce the likelihood of friendly casualties during the conflict or civilian casualties after the conflict's end. The <b>Amended</b> <b>Protocol</b> II to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW), amended in 1996, requires that anti-personnel land mines deactivate and self-destruct, and sets standards for both. [...] Land mines currently used by the United States military {{are designed to}} self-destruct between 4 hours and 15 days depending upon the type. [...] The land mines have a battery and when the battery dies, the land mine self-destructs. [...] The self-destruct system never failed in over 67,000 tested land mines in a variety of conditions. [...] Not all self-destruct mechanisms are absolutely reliable, and most land mines that have been laid throughout history are not equipped to self-destruct. Land mines can also be designed to self-deactivate, for instance by a battery running out of a charge, but deactivation is considered a different mechanism from self-destruction.|$|R
40|$|Objective. To {{elucidate}} {{sources of}} {{variability in the}} estimate of treatment effects in a successful phase 3 trial in severe sepsis and to assess their implications {{on the design of}} future clinical trials. Design. Retrospective evaluation of prospectively defined subgroups from a large phase 3, placebo-controlled clinical trial (PROWESS). Setting. The study involved 164 medical centers. Patients: Patients were 1, 690 patients with severe sepsis. Interventions. Drotrecogin alfa (activated) (Xigris) 24 mug/kg/hr for 96 hrs, or placebo. Measurements and Main Results: All prospectively defined subgroups were examined to identify treatment effects that potentially differed across subgroup strata (assessed by Breslow-Day p <. 10). Potential interactions were identified for subgroups defined by a) presence vs. absence of a significant protocol violation (p =. 07); b) original vs. <b>amended</b> <b>protocol</b> (p =. 08); and c) Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II quartile at baseline (P =. 09). No treatment benefit was observed in patients having a protocol violation, regardless of type. There appeared to be less treatment effect in patients enrolled under the original vs. <b>amended</b> <b>protocol.</b> The risk ratio exceeded 1. 0 for patients in the lowest APACHE II score quartile. A highly significant correlation was observed between the sequence of enrollment at a site, the frequency of protocol violations, and the observed treatment effect. As enrollment increased, frequency of protocol violations decreased (p <. 0001) and the treatment effect improved. The correlation between the sequence of enrollment and improvement in treatment effect remained even after removal of patients with protocol violations. Removal of the first block of patents at each site from the analysis reduced the extent of interaction by protocol version and APACHE II score. Conclusions. A learning curve appeared to be present within the PROWESS trial such that the ability to demonstrate efficacy improved with increasing site experience. This potential learning curve may have implications for design of future trials. Investigational sites may need to require a minimum level of protocol-specific experience to appropriately implement a given trial. This experience should be an important consideration in designing trials and analysis plans. Diligence by coordinating centers, site investigators, study coordinators, and sponsors is necessary to ensure that the protocol is executed as designed such that a treatment benefit, if present, will be evident...|$|R
40|$|Two {{international}} treaty frameworks - <b>Amended</b> <b>Protocol</b> II (APII) to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons and the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention (APMBC) - {{have been developed}} to prohibit or restrict the use of landmines. However, reflecting a gap in current academic research, {{there is a lack of}} knowledge of their effectiveness in supporting the humanitarian goals that underpin both treaties. In order to address gaps in the existing literature, this thesis applies an analytical framework grounded in regime theory to develop new insights into the design, implementation and effectiveness of APII and the APMBC within the broader framework of international humanitarian law (IHL). Two main hypotheses are explored. The first considers the importance for regime effectiveness of the relationship between design and implementation processes. The second analyses the significance for the landmine regimes of regime interplay and nesting within wider IHL and mine action discourses. In addressing these hypotheses, design/implementation interplay, agency dynamics and normative considerations represent key themes that enable us to develop new insights to a specific issue area that also demonstrates important linkages to wider humanitarian, security and developmental agendas.
