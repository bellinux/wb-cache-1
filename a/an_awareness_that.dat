This consensus emerged with {{an increase in the number}} of studies that monitored amphibian populations, direct observation of mass mortality in pristine sites that lacked apparent cause, and <b>an</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>that</b> declines in amphibian populations are truly global in nature.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} {{acquiring}} this knowledge entails realising that one’s True Self, the Atman, {{is essentially the}} same as Brahman. This is achieved through what Sankara refers to as anubhava, immediate intuition. Sankara contends that this direct awareness is construction-free, and not construction-filled. Self knowledge is, therefore, not seen as an awareness of Brahman, but instead <b>an</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>that</b> is Brahman, since one will transcend any form of duality in this state of consciousness.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the past}} six months, {{as chair of the}} Co-operative Commission, I have been hearing {{evidence}} from organisations and individuals {{with a wide range of}} views on the direction that the movement should take. My colleagues and I have been impressed by many things: first and foremost, the goodwill towards the co-operative movement that is to be found in many, many places. There is also a willingness to embrace change and <b>an</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>that</b> no change is not an option.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} human nature being fixed in this way, implied, in other words, that we can define what type of {{community}} is always best for people. This argument has remained a central argument in all political, ethical and moral thinking since then, and has become especially controversial since firstly Rousseau's Second Discourse, and secondly, the Theory of Evolution. Already in Aristotle there was <b>an</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>that</b> the polis had not always existed and had needed to be invented or developed by humans themselves. The household came first, and the first villages and cities were just extensions of that, with the first cities being run {{as if they were}} still families with Kings acting like fathers.|$|E
25|$|His {{strategy}} emphasised {{the importance}} of striking the first blow, but with <b>an</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>that</b> sunk ships could not easily be replaced, and would replace any officer who could {{not keep up with}} the standards he demanded. He gave lectures on naval strategy to which all officers were invited and once again encouraged his officers to bring ideas to him. He offered prizes for essays on tactics and maintained a large tabletop map room with models of all ships in the fleet, where all officers could come to develop tactics. A particular concern was the threat of torpedoes, which Germany had boasted would dispose of the British fleet, and the numerous French torpedo boats. Fisher's innovations were not universally approved, with some senior officers resenting the attention he paid to their juniors, or the pressure he placed on all to improve efficiency.|$|E
25|$|In 1956, Nehru had criticised {{the joint}} {{invasion}} of the Suez Canal by the British, French and Israelis. The role of Nehru, both as Indian Prime Minister and {{a leader of the}} Non-Aligned Movement was significant; he tried to be even-handed between the two sides, while denouncing Eden and co-sponsors of the invasion vigorously. Nehru had a powerful ally in the US president Dwight Eisenhower who, if relatively silent publicly, went to the extent of using America's clout in the International Monetary Fund to make Britain and France back down. The episode greatly raised the prestige of Nehru and India among the third world nations. During the Suez crisis, Nehru's right-hand man, Menon attempted to persuade a recalcitrant Gamal Nasser to compromise with the West, and was instrumental in moving Western powers towards <b>an</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>that</b> Nasser might prove willing to compromise.|$|E

500|$|Eve avoids Adam's gaze, although, {{according}} to art historian Walter S. Gibson, she is shown [...] "seductively presenting {{her body to}} Adam". Adam's expression is one of amazement, and Fraenger has identified three elements to his seeming astonishment. Firstly, there is surprise at {{the presence of the}} God. Secondly, he is reacting to <b>an</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>that</b> Eve is of the same nature as himself, and has been created from his own body. Finally, from the intensity of Adam's gaze, it can be concluded that he is experiencing sexual arousal and the primal urge to reproduce for the first time.|$|E
500|$|Mugabe also {{developed}} a growing preoccupation with homosexuality, lambasting it as an [...] "un-African" [...] import from Europe. He described gay people as being [...] "guilty of sub-human behaviour", and of being [...] "worse than dogs and pigs". This attitude may have stemmed in part from his strong conservative values but also from <b>an</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>that</b> militant homophobia would distract attention from the country's problems. In August 1995, he was due to open a human rights-themed Zimbabwe International Book Fair in Harare but refused to do so until a stall run by the Gays and Lesbians of Zimbabwe group was evicted.|$|E

[...] "The elements of predisposition," [...] she said, [...] "should track the elements of the crime". The Bare Boys purchases were not, she argued, as dispositive of that as the majority claimed. Her last sentences responded to White's, saying that there was no question that the jury had been properly instructed on entrapment law and thus, their decision that Jacobson could not claim entrapment should be allowed to stand.|$|E

500|$|For {{nearly a}} half-century, {{alligator}} gar were considered [...] "trash fish", or a [...] "nuisance species" [...] detrimental to sport fisheries; therefore, were targeted for elimination {{by state and}} federal authorities in the United States.

[...] Over time, alligator gar were afforded some protection by state and federal resource agencies. [...] They are also protected under the Lacey Act which makes it illegal to transport certain species of fish in interstate commerce when in violation of state law or regulation. [...] Several state and federal resource agencies are monitoring populations in the wild, and have initiated outreach programs to educate the public.

2500|$|The {{significance}} of the war for oppressed classes as well as subject populations was clear too to the Socialist thinker Rosa Luxemburg: [...] "The Russo–Japanese War now gives to all <b>an</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>that</b> even war and peace in Europe – its destiny – is not decided between the four walls of the European concert, but outside it, in the gigantic maelstrom of world and colonial politics. And it's in this that the real meaning of the current war resides for social-democracy, even if we set aside its immediate effect: the collapse of Russian absolutism. This war brings {{the gaze of the}} international proletariat back to the great political and economic connectedness of the world, and violently dissipates in our ranks the particularism, the pettiness of ideas that form in any period of political calm." [...] It was this realisation of the universal {{significance of}} the war that underlines the historical importance of the conflict and its outcome.|$|E

Unlike many parodies that {{are done in}} a straightforward manner for effect, French and Saunders uses the viewer's awareness {{of what is going}} on to further stretch out the joke.
