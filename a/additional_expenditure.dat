25|$|The {{proportion}} of GNP {{spent on the}} NHS rose from 4.2% in 1964 to about 5% in 1969. This <b>additional</b> <b>expenditure</b> provided for an energetic revival of a policy of building health centres for GPs, extra pay for doctors who served in areas particularly short of them, a significant growth in hospital staffing, and {{a significant increase in}} a hospital building programme. Far more money was spent each year on the NHS than under the 1951–64 Conservative governments, while much more effort was put into modernising and reorganising the health service. Stronger central and regional organisations were established for bulk purchase of hospital supplies, while some efforts were made to reduce inequalities in standards of care. In addition, the government increased the intake to medical schools.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{this period}} both the US and USSR {{were working on}} anti-ballistic missile systems.

Even though these items would be expensive, the ABM interceptor itself was likely to cost {{about the same as}} an ICBM (or less), so any increase in the enemy's stockpile could be countered for an <b>additional</b> <b>expenditure</b> of about the same amount.

It will run next to the existing Nord-Süd Tunnel to Brandenburg Gate and separate from it to run to Potsdamer Platz. The first north-south S-Bahn tunnel was designed in 1939 with room for an additional two tracks at Potsdamer Platz and to its south for the new line. The cost of the S-Bahn line (phases 1 and 2) has been estimated at €317 million (2009 prices).

25|$|Following {{the study}} committee's report, {{the school board}} agreed to use a {{one-time}} refund on insurance premiums to pay for $575,000 in repairs at Memorial Stadium. These included east bleacher drainage improvements, east bleacher foundation and stairway improvements, and adding handicapped-accessible areas to both {{the east and west}} grandstands. The cost of these upgrades increased to $600,000 in May 2000. Costs had actually decreased because an engineer's assessment came in lower than expected and an accounting error was discovered that removed double-counting of expenses. With the <b>additional</b> <b>expenditure</b> of just $25,000, however, the work could now be expanded to include entirely replacing the east bleachers, replacing the running track, and doubling the size of the team meeting/concessions buildings. In May 2000, the work was expected to be complete by the fall. The school board had yet to decide whether the track should be expanded to 10 lanes, but did agree to solicit bids to determine the cost of improving the west grandstand. The track was expanded to eight lanes two weeks later. The track work contract came in 16 percent low, which enabled the school district to add improvements to the long-jump paths and pits as well. The contract for replacing the east bleachers, however, came in $95,000 high after contractors discovered that the existing drainage system was far more damaged than previously suspected. In June 2000, the school board agreed to tap its general maintenance fund to pay for the work on the west bleachers after these cost estimates came in much lower than expected.|$|E

6000|$|Hence {{the great}} {{importance}} of clothing. As Liebig says:--"Our clothing is, {{in reference to}} the temperature of the body, merely an equivalent for a certain amount of food." [...] By diminishing the loss of heat, it diminishes the amount of fuel needful for maintaining the heat; and when the stomach has less to do in preparing fuel, it can do more in preparing other materials. This deduction is confirmed by the experience of those who manage animals. Cold can be borne by animals only at an expense of fat, or muscle, or growth, as the case may be. [...] "If fattening cattle are exposed to a low temperature, either their progress must be retarded, or a great <b>additional</b> <b>expenditure</b> of food incurred."[5] Mr. Apperley insists strongly that, to bring hunters into good condition, it is necessary that the stable should be kept warm.
