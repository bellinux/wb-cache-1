Two of the most cross-Bantu common of these morphemes are the applicative and causative. which are both valence increasing. making many intransitive verbs transitive and transitive verbs ditransitive. In addition to having these affixes. most Bantu languages also exhibit the ability to stack {{more than one of}} them at once. creating more complex structures. Shona (a language of Zimbabwe). however. displays a typologically unusual restriction. allowing only two postverbal objects at the most. In addition to this descriptive generalization. this paper provides a detailed account of verbal extensions and their objects in Shona. ultimately showing that many Shona objects behave asymmetrically. Towards the latter half of this report. the focus shifts to an analysis of the <b>argument</b> <b>limit</b> and asymmetrical object phenomena involving case. In order to explain seemingly conflicting data. this paper hypothesizes the presence of three structural case-assigners in Shona. as well as proposing several criteria for prosperous case-assignment...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{dynamics}} {{of a system of}} hard-core particles sliding downwards on a one dimensional fluctuating interface, which in a special case can be mapped to the problem of a passive scalar advected by a Burgers fluid. Driven by the surface fluctuations, the particles show a tendency to cluster, but the hard-core interaction prevents collapse. We use numerical simulations to measure the auto-correlation function in steady state and in the aging regime, and space-time correlation functions in steady state. We have also calculated these quantities analytically in a related surface model. The steady state auto-correlation is a scaling function of t/L^z, where L is the system size and z the dynamic exponent. Starting from a finite intercept, the scaling function decays with a cusp, in the small <b>argument</b> <b>limit.</b> The finite value of the intercept indicates the existence of long range order in the system. The space-time correlation, which is a function of r/L and t/L^z, is non-monotonic in t for fixed r. The aging auto-correlation is a scaling function of t_ 1 and t_ 2 where t_ 1 is the waiting time and t_ 2 the time difference. This scaling function decays as a power law for t_ 2 ≫ t_ 1; for t_ 1 ≫ t_ 2, it decays with a cusp as in steady state. To reconcile the occurrence of strong fluctuations in the steady state with the fact of an ordered state, we measured the distribution function of the length of the largest cluster. This shows that fluctuations never destroy ordering, but rather the system meanders from one ordered configuration to another on a relatively rapid time scale...|$|E

40|$|The Quasi-Bayesian (QB) model {{generates a}} {{complete}} {{probability mass function}} on {{the total amount of}} error in an accounting population for any random sample of dollar units or physical units. This probability mass function is used to estimate upper bounds (UBs) on the total amount of error in an accounting population. The underlying QB formulation can be summarized as Bayes' Theorem with a maximum likelihood, calculated using the multinomial distribution, substituted for the unknown likelihood. Any prior can be used. McCray did not provide any theoretical justification for using a maximum likelihood. To date the justification for the QB estimated UBs rests on intuitive <b>arguments</b> <b>limited</b> simulations and 'windtunnel' tests. All these suggest the QB UBs may be reliable for audit purposes. This paper provides the theoretical justification for using a maximum likelihood in the QB model.

40|$|The {{interplay between}} quantum-mechanical properties, such as coherence, and {{classical}} notions, such as energy, {{is a subtle}} topic {{at the forefront of}} quantum thermodynamics. The traditional Carnot <b>argument</b> <b>limits</b> the conversion of heat to work; here we critically assess the problem of converting coherence to work. Through a careful account of all resources involved in the thermodynamic transformations within a fully quantum-mechanical treatment, we show that there exist thermal machines extracting work from coherence arbitrarily well. Such machines only need to act on individual copies of a state and can be reused. On the other hand, we show that for any thermal machine with finite resources not all the coherence of a state can be extracted as work. However, even bounded thermal machines can be reused infinitely many times in the process of work extraction from coherence. Comment: 15 pages, 4 figures. Published version.

40|$|This article {{examines}} woodfuel policy {{challenges and opportunities}} in Malawi two decades after woodfuel-crisis narratives and counter-narratives. A nuanced examination of woodfuel supply, demand, use, and markets illuminated options to turn stagnant policies based on charcoal 'bans' and fuel-substitution into proactive, realistic ones acknowledging woodfuel dominance and its socio-economic importance. Findings revealed growing, spatially differentiated woodfuel deficits in southern and central Malawi and around Blantyre, Zomba and Lilongwe cities. Poverty, limited electricity access, reliability and generation exacerbated by tariff subsidies, and complex fuel-allocation decisions restricted energy-ladder transitions from woodfuels to electricity, producing an enduring urban-energy mix dominated by charcoal, thereby increasing wood consumption. Diverse socio-political interests prevented lifting of the charcoal 'ban' despite progressive forest laws. Despite implementation challenges, lessons already learnt, efficiency and poverty-reduction <b>arguments,</b> <b>limited</b> government capacity, growing illegal production of charcoal in forest reserves, and its staying power, make targeted community-based forest management (CBFM) approaches more practical for regulated, commercial production of woodfuels than the status quo.
