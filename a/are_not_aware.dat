5|$|The name-letter {{effect is}} the {{tendency}} of people to prefer the letters in their name over other letters in the alphabet. Whether subjects are asked to rank all letters of the alphabet, rate each of the letters, choose the letter they prefer out {{of a set of}} two, or pick a small set of letters they most prefer, on average people consistently like the letters in their own name the most. Crucially, subjects <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>aware</b> that they are choosing letters from their name.|$|E

Also with the girls is Danny, Lisa's younger brother. What the gang does not know is the house is infested with Augers, vampiric beings that need blood to survive. The Martin family themselves {{are in the process}} of becoming vampires. The following events that take place and the ending vary widely depending on which characters the player is able to save from the Augers.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of the}} North American auto market, by 2007 Canada had {{available}} 51 {{models of}} E85 flex-vehicles, most from Chrysler, Ford and General Motors, including automobiles, pickup trucks, and SUVs. The country had around 1.6million capable flex fuel E85s on the roads by 2014. However, most users <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>aware</b> they own an E85, as vehicles are not clearly labeled as such, {{and even though the}} newer models have a yellow cap in the fuel tank informing that the vehicle can handle E85, most users are still not aware because there are hardly any gas stations offering E85. Another major restriction for greater E85 fuel use is the fact that by June 2008 Canada had only three public E85 pumps, all located in Ontario, in the cities of Guelph, Chatham, and Woodstock. E85 fueling is available primarily for fleet vehicles, including 20 government refueling stations not available for the public. The main feedstocks for E85 production in Canada are corn and wheat, and there were several proposals being discussed to increase the actual use of E85 fuel in FFVs, such as creating an ethanol-friendly highway or ethanol corridor.|$|E
5|$|While {{individuals}} with tics are sometimes able to suppress their tics for limited periods of time, doing so {{often results in}} tension or mental exhaustion. People with Tourette's may seek a secluded spot to release their symptoms, or {{there may be a}} marked increase in tics after a period of suppression at school or at work. Some people with Tourette's may not be aware of the premonitory urge. Children may be less aware of the premonitory urge associated with tics than are adults, but their awareness tends to increase with maturity. They may have tics for several years before becoming aware of premonitory urges. Children may suppress tics while in the doctor's office, so they may need to be observed while they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>aware</b> they are being watched. The ability to suppress tics varies among individuals, and may be more developed in adults than children.|$|E
25|$|It is {{stated that}} if a student is {{successful}} in awakening consciousness, {{he or she will}} eventually experience a continuous state of vigilance not only during the day but also while the physical body is sleeping, and most importantly after death. This is significant because Aun Weor states that those who have a sleeping consciousness <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>aware</b> of their postmortem condition, just as they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>aware</b> when they are physically sleeping. The awakening of consciousness allows a student to continue to work regardless of their physical state.|$|E

25|$|There {{is a wide}} {{variation}} in reported epidemiologic data for bruxism, and this {{is largely due to}} differences in the definition, diagnosis and research methodologies of these studies. E.g. several studies use self-reported bruxism as a measure of bruxism, and since many people with bruxism <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>aware</b> of their habit, self-reported tooth grinding and clenching habits may be a poor measure of the true prevalence.|$|E

25|$|The bladder may rupture if overfilled and not emptied. This {{can occur}} {{in the case of}} binge {{drinkers}} having consumed very large quantities, but <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>aware,</b> due to stupor, of the need to urinate. This condition is very rare in women, but it does occur. Symptoms include localized pain and uraemia (poisoning due to reabsorbed waste). The recovery rate is high, with most fatalities due to septic blood poisoning. A person is more likely to urinate while passed out before the bladder ruptures, as alcohol relaxes the muscles that normally control their bladder.|$|E
25|$|Individuals {{who make}} their own bullets usually <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>aware</b> of {{available}} manual specialized equipment and dies required for swaging bullets, and thus choose to make cast bullets. To get high precision results, {{it is common to}} cast the bullets slightly oversized, then swage the resulting castings through a die to do the final forming. Since the amount of pressure required to size the bullet is far less than that required to form a bullet, a simple mechanical press can be used, often the same press used for handloading ammunition.|$|E
25|$|A {{new trend}} in the United States for Hispanics is to hyphenate their father's and mother's last names. This is done because American born English-speakers <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>aware</b> of the Hispanic custom of using two last names and thus mistake the first last name of the {{individual}} for a middle name. In doing so they would, for example, mistakenly refer to Esteban Álvarez Cobos as Esteban A. Cobos. Such confusion can be particularly troublesome in official matters. To avoid such mistakes, Esteban Álvarez Cobos, would become Esteban Álvarez-Cobos, to clarify that both are last names.|$|E

In 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013, President Barack Obama proclaimed January as National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month. Along with these initiatives libraries across the United States are beginning to contribute to human trafficking awareness.

25|$|The Bahá'í teachings {{state that}} {{there exists a}} {{hierarchy}} of souls in the afterlife, where the merits of each soul determines {{their place in the}} hierarchy, and that souls lower in the hierarchy cannot completely understand the station of those above. Each soul can continue to progress in the afterlife, but the soul's development is not entirely dependent on its own conscious efforts, the nature of which we <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>aware,</b> but also augmented by the grace of God, the prayers of others, and good deeds performed by others on Earth in the name of that person.|$|E
25|$|The Epistle to a Friend {{concerning}} Poetry {{is neither}} startling nor contemptible; it has, in fact, {{much more to}} say than the rhymed treatises on verse by Roscommon and Buckinghamshire. Its remarks on Genius are fresh, though tantalizing in their brevity, and it defends the Moderns with both neatness and energy. Much of its advice is cautious and commonplace—but such was {{the tradition of the}} poetical treatise on verse. Appearing within two years of Collier's first attack upon the stage, it reinforces some of that worthy's contentions, but we <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>aware</b> of its having had much effect.|$|E
