5000|$|Dad (George Lowe) {{is a small}} human {{illegal alien}} with a Cuban accent, who is {{extremely}} self-centered, lazy and nonsensical. Unemployed since 1984, {{most of his time}} is spent sitting <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>table</b> <b>and</b> reading the newspaper. An episode seldom goes by without him delivering a moral to the story that is often incoherent, or has no relevance to the situation, and typically ends in a non sequitur. Occasionally, he displays prominent womanizing and male-chauvinistic behavior, which is sometimes rebuked by Brak's mom. In an Adult Swim New Year's Eve bumper in 2003, he revealed his name to be [...] "Javier".|$|E

5000|$|Finally, Wade {{is fired}} from his police job both for his {{constant}} harassment of Jack and his trashing of Lariviere's office. He collects Jill from her mother's house, where his ex-wife furiously castigates {{his plans to}} sue for full custody. At the local restaurant, he attacks the bartender {{in front of his}} daughter after he jokingly insults Wade. Then Wade takes Jill home to find Margie leaving him. Wade grabs Margie and begs her to stay with him, but Jill rushes up and tries to push Wade away. In response, Wade pushes Jill, causing her nose to bleed. She and Margie drive off. Wade is then approached by his father Glen, who congratulates him for finally acting as a [...] "real man". The latent aggression between the men culminates in a fight in which Wade accidentally kills his father.

5000|$|The auction is over. Cordelia is in {{the back}} room {{listening}} to Barney negotiate with Mac, the lawyer from Wolfram and Hart, about the additional fee for removing her eyes, and to Hank still clacking the four-pronged extractor. To Cordelia's horror, Mac agrees to the extra grand and Barney, taking the extractor away from the seriously disappointed Hank, holds the seer down and starts to do the job himself. At that moment, a body comes flying through the curtained doorway and Angel and Wesley, who have worked their way {{from the front of the}} hotel to back here behind the Tulip Room, follow immediately after. Barney raps out, [...] "Hank? Stakes!" [...] and the fight is on. Mac, having already made a strategic exit, uses her cell phone to give a situation report as, behind her, Angel wades in, shouting to Wesley to get Cordelia. The hilariously bumbling Wes manages to ungag her, but must use the serrated curve of the Tak horn that got knocked to the floor nearby to cut her bonds - because he can't get at the knife he earlier taped so securely to his leg. Just as Wes and Cordy head for the nearest exit, Barney blocks their path, the homicidal glint in his eyes matched by the righteous fury in Wesley's. In the ensuing struggle, Barney quickly gets the upper hand and starts to throttle the demon hunter who tracked him so relentlessly. With a shout, Cordelia grabs the Tak horn and stabs the murderous empath demon in the back. They watch in horrified fascination as the Tak horn's power drains his life force and his body shrivels and blackens and sinks away. Angel dispatches the last of his foes and, when an overjoyed Cordelia flings her arms around him, acknowledges Wesley's invaluable assistance. Back at Angel's apartment, Cordelia sits <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>table</b> <b>and</b> frames her ugly, gray, blobby drawing as a memento for saving her life, and as a reminder that something of Doyle's will always be with them. Moved, Angel silently turns back to the stove and continues to scramble eggs, while Wesley finishes packing up his things. As Wesley makes his farewells, he wistfully draws out his departure to give the other two ample opportunity to invite him to stay. When Angel finally relents and says, [...] "breakfast?", Wesley accepts with alacrity and the three friends enjoy each other's company for this moment of peace, warmth, and safety.|$|E
