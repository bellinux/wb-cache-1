5|$|After {{the station}} opened, Soviet protests persisted. The issue was raised at {{official}} {{visits to the}} Soviet Union by Norwegian politicians in 1966, 1967 and 1968. The Soviet Consul in Barentsburg visited Ny-Ålesund in 1968 and <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> inspections of the installation. On 28 August 1968, Norway and the Soviet Union agreed for a one-time, two-day Soviet inspection of the station. The last protest against the installation was made in April 1969.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1980s, synth-pop {{had helped}} {{establish}} the synthesizer {{as a primary}} instrument in mainstream pop music. It also influenced the sound of many mainstream rock acts, such as Bruce Springsteen, ZZ Top and Van Halen. It was {{a major influence on}} house music, which grew out of the post-disco dance club culture of the early 1980s as some DJs <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the less pop-oriented music that also incorporated influences from Latin soul, dub, rap music, and jazz.|$|E

5|$|After {{receiving}} reinforcements, the British <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> {{a surprise}} attack on Pontiac's encampment. But Pontiac was ready and waiting, and defeated {{them at the}} Battle of Bloody Run on July 31, 1763. Nevertheless, the situation at Fort Detroit remained a stalemate, and Pontiac's influence among his followers began to wane. Groups of Native Americans began to abandon the siege, some of them making peace with the British before departing. On October 31, 1763, finally convinced that the French in Illinois would not come to his aid at Detroit, Pontiac lifted the siege and removed to the Maumee River, where he continued his efforts to rally resistance against the British.|$|E
5|$|At a {{distance}} of , the Japanese fleet began to fire on the Chaoyong. Within a few minutes, fires broke out, which quickly engulfed the central superstructure with its numerous wooden partitions covered with thick layers of flammable varnish applied over the years. Yangwei quickly suffered the same fate. As the Chaoyong <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> way to a nearby island to beach itself, it collided with the Chinese cruiser , before listing to starboard and sinking in shallow water nearby. Some of the crew were rescued by a Chinese torpedo boat engaged in the battle.|$|E
5|$|Bramantyo <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> {{his film}} as {{historically}} accurate as possible. However, as no documentation of Dahlan's life {{before he went}} to Mecca exists, the scenes showing Dahlan's youth were fictionalized. The script underwent 12 revisions before the film was completed. Much of the film's budget of Rp. 12 billion (US$ 1.3 million) was spent on costumes and sets to ensure accuracy. The crew restored several old buildings for their shots and custom-ordered 19th-century style traditional garments for their scenes.|$|E

5|$|During {{a game in}} 2013 {{between the}} Houston Astros and Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Culbreth, acting as the crew chief for the game, made an {{incorrect}} call in the 7th inning, for which he later received a two-game suspension and a fine. Houston manager Bo Porter made a pitching change, and Los Angeles manager Mike Scioscia called for a pinch-hitter. Porter <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a second pitching change and Scioscia immediately contested it. After discussing the call with his umpiring crew, Culbreth allowed the pitching change, violating the MLB rule 3.05(b). He did not serve his suspension immediately, and he continued working regular games in the weeks following the incident.|$|E

Ganguly was awarded the Padma Shri in 2004, India's fourth highest civilian award, in recognition of his distinguished contribution {{in the field of}} sports.

The gambling issue failed to gain as much traction as the hiring scandal, however, and Beshear defeated Fletcher by a vote of 619,686 to 435,895.|$|E

Surgeons were forced to perform a micro-fracture in order for the hip to heal properly. Despite this, he <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a comeback {{at the end of the}} season to play in the FA Cup final against Portsmouth and was included in the 18-man match squad.

5|$|The {{exploratory}} {{parts of}} the game feature a series of arcane codes and glyphs, treasure maps and chests, and secret rooms. Players are left without guidance to determine whether game elements are decipherable subpuzzles or simply false signals. These sorts of puzzles include hidden warp gates, enigmatic obelisks, invisible platforms, sequences of tetrominos, a ciphered alphabet, and QR codes. One of the game's recurring themes is an ancient civilization that <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sense of their dimensionality, as told through artifacts.|$|E

Tucker played only one game for the Indians, on April 29 when he recorded a strikeout in his lone at-bat. In early May, the Indians sent him to their Triple-A minor league affiliate, the San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League; his last major league game was April 29.|$|E
5|$|Admiral Rodney was escorting a {{fleet of}} supply ships to relieve the Spanish siege of Gibraltar with {{a fleet of}} about twenty ships of the line when he {{encountered}} Lángara's squadron south of Cape St. Vincent.

In a running battle that lasted from mid-afternoon until after midnight, the British captured four Spanish ships, including Lángara's flagship. Two other ships were also captured, but their final disposition is unclear; some Spanish sources indicate they were retaken by their Spanish crews, while Rodney's report indicates the ships were grounded and destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Billed as {{the next}} Sandy Koufax, Clyde had a stellar high school career at Westchester High School. He was drafted with the first overall pick in the 1973 Major League Baseball draft. The Rangers planned to have Clyde pitch his first two {{professional}} games {{in the major leagues}} before moving him down to the minor leagues, but Rangers owner Bob Short decided to keep him in the roster for monetary purposes, where he had a 5.01 earned run average in 18 starts. Journalists criticized the Rangers for promoting Clyde too soon, and after an uneventful 1974 campaign, he developed shoulder trouble and was sent down to the minor leagues in 1975, where he pitched three seasons. He was traded to the Cleveland Indians in 1978, and played two seasons before being demoted. Clyde <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a comeback with the Houston Astros but was unsuccessful.|$|E
