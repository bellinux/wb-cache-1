40|$|As {{congestion}} management strategies begin {{to put more}} emphasis on person trips than vehicle trips, the need for <b>vehicle</b> <b>occupancy</b> data has become more critical. The traditional methods of collecting these data include the roadside windshield method and the carousel method. These methods are labor-intensive and expensive. An alternative to these traditional methods is {{to make use of}} the <b>vehicle</b> <b>occupancy</b> information in traffic accident records. This method is cost effective and may provide better spatial and temporal coverage than the traditional methods. However, this method is subject to potential biases resulting from under- and over-involvement of certain population sectors and certain types of accidents in traffic accident records. ^ In this dissertation, three such potential biases, i. e., accident severity, driver’s age, and driver’s gender, were investigated and the corresponding bias factors were developed as needed. The results show that although multi-occupant vehicles are involved in higher percentages of severe accidents than are single-occupant vehicles, multi-occupant vehicles in the whole accident vehicle population were not overrepresented in the accident database. On the other hand, a significant difference was found between the distributions of the ages and genders of drivers involved in accidents and those of the general driving population. ^ An information system that incorporates adjustments for the potential biases was developed to estimate the <b>average</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>occupancies</b> (AVOs) for different types of roadways on the Florida state roadway system. A reasonableness check of the results from the system shows AVO estimates that are highly consistent with expectations. In addition, comparisons of AVOs from accident data with the field estimates show that the two data sources produce relatively consistent results. ^ While accident records can be used to obtain the historical AVO trends and field data can be used to estimate the current AVOs, no known methods have been developed to project future AVOs. Four regression models for the purpose of predicting weekday AVOs on different levels of geographic areas and roadway types were developed as part of this dissertation. The models show that such socioeconomic factors as income, vehicle ownership, and employment have a significant impact on AVOs. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{success of}} a high <b>occupancy</b> <b>vehicle</b> lane in {{motivating}} people to shift to carpools and buses depends on maintaining a travel time differential {{between it and the}} adjacent general purpose lanes. This differential, in turn, depends on the level of continuing delay on the general purpose lanes. Therefore, it is clear that a high <b>occupancy</b> <b>vehicle</b> lane that will motivate people to shift to high <b>occupancy</b> <b>vehicles</b> will not eliminate congestion. Consequently, {{it is not clear that}} constructing a high <b>occupancy</b> <b>vehicle</b> lane will necessarily reduce delay more than construction of a general purpose lane. The objective of this research is to determine the circumstances in which this would be the case. The hypothesis is that such circumstances would be quite limited, and this proves to be the case. The intended benefits of high occupancy lanes are defined as reduced person-delay and reduced emissions. A model is developed to calculate these benefits for four alternatives add a high <b>occupancy</b> <b>vehicle</b> lane, add a general purpose lane, convert an existing lane to a high <b>occupancy</b> <b>vehicle</b> lane, and do nothing. The model takes into account the initial conditions, the dynamic nature of the travel time differential between the high <b>occupancy</b> <b>vehicle</b> lane and other lanes, and the uncertainty regarding the extent to which people will shift modes. It combines queueing theory and mode choice theory and provides a robust method for comparing alternatives using a small amount of easily observed data. Application of the model in typical situations shows that with initial delays on the order of 15 min or more, adding a high <b>occupancy</b> <b>vehicle</b> lane would provide substantial reductions in delay and some reduction in emissions. However, in a wide range of such situations, adding a general purpose lane would be even more effective. Only if the initial delay is long and the initial proportion of high <b>occupancy</b> <b>vehicles</b> falls in a rather narrow range, would an added high <b>occupancy</b> <b>vehicle</b> lane be more effective. The proportion of high <b>occupancy</b> <b>vehicles</b> must be such that it allows good utilization of the high <b>occupancy</b> <b>vehicle</b> lane while maintaining a sufficient travel time differential to motivate a shift to buses or carpools. Adding a high <b>occupancy</b> <b>vehicle</b> lane to a three lane freeway will be more effective than adding a general purpose lane only if the initial maximum delay is on the order of 35 min or more and the proportion of high <b>occupancy</b> <b>vehicles</b> is on the order of 20 %.

40|$|Modifying a high {{occupancy}} vehicle (HOV) lane into a high occupancy/toll (HOT) lane generally involves allowing single occupant vehicles (SOVs) {{to travel}} on the free-flow HOV lane for a toll. This may entice some former transit riders to pay the toll to obtain the benefits of traveling in their own vehicle on the HOV lane. Thus, {{the introduction of a}} HOT lane has the potential to impact transit ridership, dramatically lowering the <b>average</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>occupancy</b> of the lane. In 2003, surveys were distributed to park-and-ride bus passengers on the Katy Freeway and Northwest Freeway corridors in Houston. Passengers? responses to questions regarding their trip characteristics, their socioeconomic characteristics, and stated preference scenarios were used to develop a mode choice model. To determine how transit passengers might react to a proposed HOT lane, HOT lane scenarios with varying tolls and travel time savings were simulated using this model. For all scenarios, {{only a small percentage of}} transit passengers were estimated to switch to driving alone on the HOV lane. Fewer people would switch during the peak period than during the off-peak period. Transit passengers shifting to SOV on the HOV lane would reduce the <b>average</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>occupancy</b> (AVO) only about 1 percent to 2 percent. SOV drivers shifting from the general purpose lanes to the HOV lanes are likely to affect AVO much more. However, as long as free-flow conditions are maintained, this analysis shows that the HOV lane can be successfully adapted to a HOT lane and move more people, even if a few transit passengers choose to drive alone...|$|E

Further {{conversion of}} HOV lanes to HOT lanes is a major policy decision that depends on knowledge of the likely impacts, including the equity of the new HOT lane. Rather than estimating these impacts using modeling or surveys, this study collects revealed preference data {{in the form of}} observed vehicle license plate data and <b>vehicle</b> <b>occupancy</b> data from users of the HOV corridor. Building on a methodology created in Spring 2011, researchers created a new methodology for matching license plate data to <b>vehicle</b> <b>occupancy</b> data that required extensive post-processing of the data. The new methodology also presented an opportunity to take an in-depth look at errors in both occupancy and license plate data (in terms of data collection efforts, processing, and the vehicle registration database). Characteristics of individual vehicles were determined from vehicle registration records associated with the license plate data collected during AM and PM peak periods immediately prior to the HOV lanes conversion to HOT lanes. More than 70, 000 individual vehicle license plates were collected for analysis, and over 3, 500 records are matched to occupancy values. Analysis of these data have shown that government and commercial vehicle were more prevalent in the HOV lane, while hybrid and alternative fuel vehicles were much less common in either lane than expected. <b>Vehicle</b> <b>occupancy</b> data from the first four quarters of data collection were used to create the distribution of occupancy on the HOV and general purpose lane, and then the matched occupancy and license plate data were examined. A sensitivity analysis of the occupancy data established that the current use of uncertain occupancy values is acceptable and that bus and vanpool occupancy should be considered when determining the <b>average</b> <b>occupancy</b> of all <b>vehicles</b> on the HOV lane.

40|$|In {{the past}} decade, {{a variety of}} {{questions}} have been raised concerning the effectiveness of high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes. In Southern California, recent evaluation studies on HOV lanes confirm the effectiveness of HOV lanes in several ways. However, little research has been performed to evaluate the air quality benefits of HOV lanes. This paper describes a study that examines operational differences in traffic dynamics between HOV lanes and mixed-flow (MF) lanes and evaluates their impacts on vehicle emissions. Four general HOV lane scenarios were identified: underutilized, neutral, well utilized, and overutilized. Extensive driving trajectories in both lane types for each scenario were collected. Their speed profile and joint speed-acceleration frequency distribution were analyzed and compared. Vehicle emissions and fuel consumption were then estimated with a state-of-the-art modal emissions model. The results show that HOV lanes produce lower emission rates per vehicle per mile in most cases, except when they are underutilized. When normalized by <b>average</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>occupancy,</b> HOV lanes produce much lower emission rates per the same amount of travel demand, on the order of 10 % to 70 %. In almost every case, HOV lanes produce less emissions mass on a per-lane basis than MF lanes. Southern California freeway lane performance matrices show that on a typical weekday during the summer of 2005, HOV lanes operated mostly under Scenarios 1 and 2 during peak periods. Overall, they were well utilized about 14 % to 17 % of the time. According to the emissions estimates, the HOV lanes are considered effective in reducing vehicle emissions...|$|E
