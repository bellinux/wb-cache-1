5|$|Though {{it was one}} of {{the three}} first {{elements}} to be synthesized in the Big Bang, lithium, together with beryllium and boron, is markedly less abundant than other elements.

5|$|An {{expert panel}} of {{engineers}} {{released a report}} outlining concerns regarding the decreased loop ramp radii <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of protective guardrail at sharp curves, {{in addition to the}} lack of a concrete median barrier to separate the opposite directions of travel. However, it was also argued that the large grass median was sufficient to prevent cross-over collisions, given that Highway410 has a similar median.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1950s Waugh was troubled {{on a number}} of fronts. He was afflicted with writer's block, and was unable to make {{progress}} with his current novel, the second in his Sword of Honour trilogy. He had financial worries, a legacy of his free-spending post-war habits combined with accumulated tax liabilities <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of remunerative productivity. His general health was poor; he suffered from toothache, sciatica and rheumatism, and his memory was faulty. He was also drinking heavily, the effects of which were aggravated by a large intake of chloral and bromide washed down with crème de menthe—a treatment for insomnia that he concealed from his doctors.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{commented that}} the book seemed to be aimed at fans of The Simpsons rather than a more general audience. Other criticisms {{included}} {{the simplicity of the}} writing <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of interesting stories.

5|$|Duquesne {{closed its}} season against Fordham, who {{had yet to}} win a conference game and had only won two games all season. Fordham was hungry for a win, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of {{effective}} defense on both sides led to a high scoring 111–100victory for Duquesne. Melquan Bolding and Eric Evans both posted career high scores of 32 and 23, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Flight tests {{revealed}} difficult handling, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of power {{due to the}} non-availability of the intended ACh-30BF engines. Flight tests continued without the waist guns and their gunner until the ACh-30BF's were fitted between May and July 1944. Despite modifications, the aircraft still suffered from poor controllability at low speeds and high weights as well as very poor gliding performance. Throughout the flight tests the engines performed satisfactorily in the air, but {{were found to be}} very difficult to start in low ambient temperatures and had slow response to throttle movements. Further development was canceled.|$|E
5|$|GreenSky London, a {{biofuels}} plant {{under construction}} in 2014, aimed to take in some 500,000 tonnes of municipal rubbish and change the organic component into 60,000 tonnes of jet fuel, and 40 megawatts of power. By the end of 2015, it was hoped all British Airways flights from London City Airport will be fuelled by waste and rubbish discarded by London residents, leading to carbon savings equivalent to taking 150,000 cars off the road. Unfortunately, the £340m scheme was mothballed in January 2016 following low crude oil prices, jittery investors <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> {{of support from the}} UK government.|$|E

For the second successive year, the Flyers failed to qualify for the playoffs. Early the following season, Hextall received the third significant suspension of his career, missing six games for slashing Detroit forward Jim Cummins during a pre-season game. Suspension, further injuries, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of form meant Hextall appeared 45times for the Flyers. He recorded 16wins during the season, resulting in his lowest win percentage in the NHL, 35.56%.|$|E
5|$|In January 1957, Diefenbaker {{took his}} place as Leader of the Official Opposition. In February, St. Laurent {{informed}} him that Parliament would be dissolved in April for an election on June 10. The Liberals submitted a budget in March; Diefenbaker attacked it for overly high taxes, failure to assist pensioners, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of aid for the poorer provinces. Parliament was dissolved on April 12. St. Laurent was so confident of victory {{that he did not}} even bother to make recommendations to the Governor General to fill the 16 vacancies in the Senate.|$|E
5|$|In the end, Kennedy {{managed to}} amend the renewal of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 to include {{provisions}} for a national survey on nutrition. Stennis was so embarrassed by the hearings that he proposed a $10 million emergency fund be established for food and medical services. Despite resistance from other Southern legislators <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of support from President Johnson, Stennis' bill passed. The Senate also voted unanimously to create a Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs. The Poverty Subcommittee held further field hearings across the country {{as part of its}} work.|$|E

5|$|Japan's {{military}} and civil defenses {{were unable to}} stop the Allied attacks. The number of fighter aircraft and anti-aircraft guns assigned to defensive duties in the home islands was inadequate, {{and most of these}} aircraft and guns had difficulty reaching the high altitudes at which B-29s often operated. Fuel shortages, inadequate pilot training, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of coordination between units also constrained the effectiveness of the fighter force. Despite the vulnerability of Japanese cities to firebombing attacks, the firefighting services lacked training and equipment, and few air raid shelters were constructed for civilians. As a result, the B-29s were able to inflict severe damage on urban areas while suffering few losses.|$|E
5|$|Madagascar {{not only}} {{contains}} two radically different climatic zones, the rainforests {{of the east}} and the dry regions of the west, but also swings from extended drought to cyclone-generated floods. These climatic and geographical challenges, along with poor soils, low plant productivity, wide ranges of ecosystem complexity, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of regularly fruiting trees (such as fig trees) have driven the evolution of lemurs' immense morphological and behavioral diversity. Their survival has required the ability to endure the persistent extremes, not yearly averages.|$|E

5|$|Morales' {{second term}} was heavily {{affected}} by infighting and dissent from {{within his own}} support base, as indigenous and leftist activists came to oppose {{a number of the}} governments' reforms. In May 2010, Morales' government announced a 5% rise in the minimum wage. The Bolivian Workers' Central (COB) felt this insufficient given the rise in the cost of living, and called a general strike. Protesters clashed with police, although the government refused to increase the rise, accusing protesters of being pawns of the right. In August 2010, violent protests then broke out in southern Potosí over widespread unemployment <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of investment in infrastructure.|$|E

The protests left 18 people dead and at least 44 others suffering from gunshot wounds. In April 2012, Mutharika {{died of a heart}} attack; the presidential title was taken over by former Vice-President Joyce Banda.|$|E
