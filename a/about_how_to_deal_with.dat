5|$|Discussions {{took place}} in the Tower of London <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> the revolt. The King had only a few troops at hand, {{in the form of the}} castle's garrison, his {{immediate}} bodyguard and, at most, several hundred soldiers. Many of the more experienced military commanders were in France, Ireland and Germany, and the nearest major military force was in the north of England, guarding against a potential Scottish invasion. Resistance in the provinces was also complicated by English law, which stated that only the King could summon local militias or lawfully execute rebels and criminals, leaving many local lords unwilling to attempt to suppress the uprisings on their own authority.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Microencapsulated Phase change {{material}} can absorb and release {{large amounts of}} latent heat over a defined temperature range as its physical state changes. The microencapsulated PCM has high energy density and isothermal behavior during charging and discharging and can avoid the contradiction of the energy supply and demand unbalance in time and space. Meanwhile, the shell can separate the phase change material from the outside environment {{in order to protect}} the core material. But the super-cooling problem is a main barrier for microencapsulated PCM application. So this paper talks <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>dealing</b> with super-cooling based on related literatures and gives an overview about the methodology in this area...|$|R

40|$|The air {{pollution}} control and evaluation has acquired high importance in the modern world. Depending on the permanence of the pollutants in the atmosphere, the pollution could be local, regional or global. The contribution of many developing countries, such as Cuba, to global climate change is very low. In these cases, while providing importance to reducing national {{emissions of greenhouse gases}} (GHG), the priority actions would be addresses to adapting to climate change and to reducing emissions that determine local and regional pollution, which have adverse effects, especially in health. The present paper examines Cuba's contribution to global greenhouse gases emissions, which turns out to be modest. Then, the problem of local pollution in the nation is addressed, reporting data from experimental measurements and comparing them with national regulations. The methodology employed and the results obtained on the levels of pollution generated by the national energy sector and corresponding impacts on health and its costs are discussed. The work may provide support for decision makers on the priorities in the use of available resources, with the aim of environment preservation. Some approaches <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> the right balance of local and global responsibilities for countries as Cuba, are also presented. As the development of those countries proceeds, their contribution to GHG emissions is expected to become more relevant. Some planned countermeasures for reducing such a trend are illustrate...|$|R
500|$|President Washington {{was confronted}} with what {{appeared}} to be an armed insurrection in western Pennsylvania, and he proceeded cautiously while determined to maintain governmental authority. He did not want to alienate public opinion, so he asked his cabinet for written opinions <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> the crisis. The cabinet recommended the use of force, except for Secretary of State Edmund Randolph who urged reconciliation. Washington did both: he sent commissioners to meet with the rebels while raising a militia army. Washington privately doubted that the commissioners could accomplish anything, and believed that a military expedition would be needed to suppress further violence. For this reason, historians have sometimes charged that the peace commission was sent only for the sake of appearances, and that the use of force was never in doubt. Historians Stanley Elkins and Eric McKitrick argued that the military expedition was [...] "itself a part of the reconciliation process", since a show of overwhelming force would make further violence less likely.|$|E

[...] Hoffecker also offered to handle the issue for the committee; he proposed to advance the money necessary to purchase the new coins from the government and to handle the distribution. [...] He stated that he had enjoyed the distribution of the Old Spanish Trail piece, though he lied to Rovelstad, stating he was not a coin dealer—the letterhead that Hoffecker used to write to Rovelstad said [...] "Loans and Mortgages" [...] under his name. He also warned Rovelstad, [...] "It would not be good for either of us if the word got out you had disposed of the entire issue to me." ...|$|E

Sean denies killing Elena, but states {{that he was one}} of Elena's patients, and that she had rented the motel room for him, to give him a place to stay. After falling asleep in the room, he awoke after hearing a shot. After seeing Elena dead on the floor, and himself injured, he ran after thinking no one would believe his account of what happened. After Bud and Detective Samantha Baker (Sonja Sohn) meet with Sean's [...] "friend" [...] Vincent Stone (Zach McGowan), he admits that he was warned off by Elena after phoning Sean six times in one day, so Samantha and Bud start to develop a theory about how Vincent killed Elena. After persuasion by Peter Dunlop (Nicholas Bishop), Sean helps the police, which allows them to get an arrest warrant for Vincent, however Megan finds rice flour on the bullet, which concludes that Vincent did not kill Elena. The rice flour leads them back to Holly, as she has a baby, and rice flour is commonly used for babies. They arrest Holly, who reveals that Elena visited her and discovers Holly was back on drugs, and was going to take Holly’s baby. Holly followed Elena, and shot her to prevent this from happening. After the confession, social services arrive, and take Holly's baby away. Back at the office, Curtis Brumfield (Windell Middlebrooks) plays pranks towards Megan and Peter tells Megan that Bud is experiencing marriage problems, so Megan tells him <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> the marriage problems, as Megan is a divorcée.|$|E
40|$|Students’ {{teaching}} practice plays {{a significant}} role in preparing them for the teaching profession. This study focused on the emotional experiences of open distance learning (ODL) student teachers during their teaching practice at schools. A previous investigation by Du Plessis, Marais, Van Schalkwyk and Weeks (2010) indicated that student teachers have <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with emotions that can be problematic, especially when they have to teach in formal education. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the emotional experiences of student teachers who were teaching in the Foundation Phase (Grade R to Grade 3) and to make recommendations on how they could deal with their feelings. Students who were enrolled for the BEd (Early Childhood Development and Foundation Phase) were purposely sampled to gather data. The data was collected by means of document analysis (questionnaires) and semi-structured interviews. The social learning theory of Bandura (1971) and the cognitive theory of emotions by Schacter and Singer (1962) were used as theoretical frameworks to evaluate the emotional experiences of the student teachers while they were doing their teaching practice at schools. The findings of this study emphasised three negative emotions, namely feelings of anger, fear and confusion. The majority of the participants indicated that they felt scared. Positive emotions like feeling happy (highest ranking); then proud and pleased were also experienced. These findings are significant for improving tutorial matter to provide guidelines for student teachers <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> more effectively with their emotions...|$|R
