5|$|The {{compensation}} package {{led to the}} Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement (IRSSA), {{announced on}} May 8, 2006, and implemented in September 2007. At the time, there were about 86,000 living victims. The IRSSA included funding for the AHF, for commemoration, for health support, and for a Truth and Reconciliation program, {{as well as an}} individual Common Experience Payment (CEP). Any person who could be verified as having resided at a federally run Indian residential school in Canada was entitled to a CEP. The <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>compensation</b> was {{based on the number of}} years a particular former student resided at the residential schools: $10,000 for the first year attended (from one night residing there to a full school year) plus $3,000 for every year thereafter.|$|E

5000|$|Many {{employees}} in the railway industry in general developed diseases related to asbestos, used during the locomotive and carriage building process. These diseases include peritoneal mesothelioma, lung cancer, asbestosis, diffuse pleural thickening and other pleural abnormalities.

25|$|As {{a result}} of the ruling, T {{accepted}} liability with a further 60 claimants from Armley. The full <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>compensation</b> was never paid out as T eventually filed for bankruptcy. There were still hundreds of outstanding cases relating to dust emitted from Midland Works, but plaintiffs' solicitors were informed that as {{a result of}} the bankruptcy, all legal actions against T and its subsidiaries would be stayed.|$|E
25|$|Spain's {{award in}} Wanganui {{also failed to}} be {{delivered}} in full: some chiefs refused to sell regardless of the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>compensation</b> offered. Spain offered to return to Māori four sections of land along with £1000, which Wakefield attempted to distribute with the money in gold and silver, but when they continued to refuse Spain informed them their refusal would not prevent the land going to the settlers.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to analyse the adopted decrees about the {{compensation}} for the urban land usage in the five selected municipalities in Primorska region (Piran, Izola, Koper, Hrpelje-Kozina, Sežana) and to ascertain if these decrees are {{in accordance with the}} state instructions and, if they are not what are the reasons for such diversities, what are the differences, why they occour, what influences their occurance. We would like to ascertain a possible connection between the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> the <b>compensation</b> and the prices of real estate. We ascertained that in our case there is a connection between the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> the <b>compensation</b> for the urban land usage and the prices of real estate. We have also ascertained that in the selected municipalities for the similarly equipped urban land different <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> the <b>compensation</b> for the urban land usage are charged as a result of different municipal decrees...|$|R
25|$|If VBA {{determines that}} a veteran suffers from service-connected PTSD, then they assign a {{disability}} rating, {{expressed as a}} percentage. This disability rating determines the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>compensation</b> and other disability benefits the VA will provide to the veteran. The disability rating indicates {{the extent to which}} PTSD has deprived the veteran of his or her average earnings capacity. A rating of 0% indicates that a veteran has PTSD but the disorder has not affected his or her ability to work, whereas a 100% rating theoretically means that the veteran is not capable of working at all because of PTSD.|$|E
25|$|Spain also {{questioned}} a key witness, Dicky Barrett, who had acted as interpreter in the Port Nicholson sale, concluding he had barely understood {{the terms of}} the sale, let alone had the ability to translate it accurately; nor had he explained to Wakefield the political undercurrents of the sale. In January 1843 acting Governor Willoughby Shortland advised both Spain and Wakefield he approved of the plan to compensate Maori for land that had not been properly alienated; from that point the focus of Spain's commission switched from investigating the validity of the sales to negotiating the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>compensation</b> to be paid when the evidence for a proper sale was slight.|$|E
25|$|File sharing {{researcher}} Daniel Johansson {{called the}} ruling {{the most important}} file sharing related verdict in Europe so far, comparing it to the Napster verdict in the US. The sentence is the longest ever awarded under Swedish copyright law, and the prison time and damage compensation high by Swedish standards. While most legal experts expected the court to find the defendants guilty, they were surprised at the harsh verdict. Sociology of law professor Håkan Hyden criticised the exceptionally harsh sentence on both the prison time and large <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>compensation</b> awarded, and some legal analysts expect the punishments to be radically lowered in higher courts.|$|E

25|$|High-Low Arbitration, or Bracketed Arbitration, is an {{arbitration}} {{wherein the}} parties to the dispute agree in advance the limits within which the arbitral tribunal must render its award. It is only generally useful where liability is not in dispute, and the only issue between the party is the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>compensation.</b> If the award is lower than the agreed minimum, then the defendant only need pay the lower limit; if the award is higher than the agreed maximum, the claimant will receive the upper limit. If the award falls within the agreed range, then the parties are bound by the actual award amount. Practice varies as to whether the figures {{may or may not be}} revealed to the tribunal, or whether the tribunal is even advised of the parties' agreement.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{founding}} of the country, the United States has sought to compensate {{the men and women who}} have served in its armed forces. In 1917, the U.S. Congress passed legislation emphasizing an indemnity model for veterans disability benefits. Congress sought to clarify and better specify provisions of the law in 1919 amendments to the original bill. Since that year, compensation has been provided to veterans suffering from physical or mental disabilities that were incurred during, or aggravated by, military service, and which have adversely impacted the veteran's ability to work. The <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>compensation</b> provided—both cash payments and VA-sponsored services—are based on the veteran's average impairment in earnings capacity. Since OIF/OEF, PTSD has grown to be the third most compensated disability in the VA after hearing loss and tinnitus.|$|E
25|$|Part A's {{inpatient}} admitted {{hospital and}} skilled nursing coverage is largely funded by revenue from a 2.9% payroll tax levied on employers and workers (each pay 1.45%). Until December 31, 1993, the law provided a maximum <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>compensation</b> {{on which the}} Medicare tax could be imposed each year, {{in the same way}} that the Social Security tax works in the United States. Beginning January 1, 1994, the compensation limit was removed. Self-employed individuals must pay the entire 2.9% tax on self-employed net earnings (because they are both employee and employer), but may deduct half of the tax from the income in calculating income tax. Beginning in 2013, the rate of Part A tax on earned income exceeding US$200,000 for individuals (US$250,000 for married couples filing jointly) rose to 3.8%, in order to pay part of the cost of the subsidies mandated by the PPACA.|$|E
50|$|This {{case is a}} good {{illustration}} of how there are different factors which determine the economic equivalent <b>of</b> the <b>compensation</b> due under the Fifth Amendment.

25|$|After {{the bridge}} was cancelled, Deluce {{launched}} a $505 million lawsuit against the City of Toronto and later expanded it to the Government of Canada. After receiving an unspecified <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>compensation</b> from the TPA to settle the suit, his company bought the airport building that Jazz was using {{at the airport and}} cancelled Jazz's lease on January 31, 2006. Two days later, on February 2, 2006, he announced that Porter Airlines, a regional airline operating locally built Bombardier turboprops would begin service in 2006, operating from the airport, initially on a Toronto-Ottawa route. In a show of political support, the Porter press conference was staged at the Bombardier plant in suburban Toronto, where the airplanes are built, with support from Canadian Auto Workers leader Buzz Hargrove, who said it would create new employment opportunities in the region. On the same day the TPA announced plans to improve ferry service to serve the new airline, buying a $4.5 million, 150-passenger ferry.|$|E

500|$|In 2010, the U.S. State Department {{stated that}} in Saudi Arabia [...] "freedom of {{religion}} is neither recognized nor protected under the law and is severely restricted in practice" [...] and that [...] "government policies continued to place severe restrictions on religious freedom". No faith other than Islam is permitted to be practised, although there are nearly a million Christians, nearly all foreign workers, in Saudi Arabia. There are no churches or other non-Muslim houses of worship permitted in the country. Even private prayer services are forbidden in practice and the Saudi religious police reportedly regularly search the homes of Christians. Foreign workers must observe Ramadan and {{are not allowed to}} celebrate Christmas or Easter. Conversion by Muslims to another religion (apostasy) carries the death penalty, although there have been no confirmed reports of executions for apostasy in recent years. Proselytizing by non-Muslims is illegal, and the last Christian priest was expelled from Saudi Arabia in 1985. Compensation in court cases discriminates against non-Muslims: once fault is determined, a Muslim receives all of the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>compensation</b> determined, a Jew or Christian half, and all others a sixteenth.|$|E
50|$|He {{began his}} career as a scout for the Boston Bruins,and was {{promoted}} to chief scout and director of player personnel. In 1971, Young was hired by Charlie Finley as the California Golden Seals' new General Manager, replacing interim Fred Glover. He named himself coach after he dismissed Vic Stasiuk in the 1972 off-season. He was fired 12 games into the 1972-73 NHL season in light of irregularities surrounding Dick Redmond's contract. He created several copies of the contract with different <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>compensation</b> for Redmond's services on each. Finley rectified the situation by having Redmond traded to the Chicago Black Hawks and firing Young. Fred Glover was named Young's replacement.|$|R

500|$|On April 3, 2008, {{after seven}} {{seasons with the}} series, Gough and Millar {{announced}} that they were leaving Smallville. The developers thanked {{the cast and crew}} for their work, acknowledging that they never stopped fighting for what they saw as [...] "their vision" [...] of the show. A reason for their departure was not provided. Gough and Millar were replaced as showrunners by Todd Slavkin, Darren Swimmer, Kelly Souders and Brian Peterson. All began writing for the series {{at the start of the}} second season, and were executive producers by the seventh season. On February 6, 2009, after one season, the L.A. Times confirmed that Swimmer and Slavkin would take over the new CW series Melrose Place and not return for Smallvilles ninth season; Souders and Peterson would continue as showrunners. On July 24, 2009, it was reported Tom Welling was a co-executive producer of the series. On March 26, 2010, The Hollywood Reporter disclosed that Millar, Gough and co-producer Tollin/Robins Productions filed a lawsuit against Warner Bros. and The CW charging that Hollywood's [...] "vertical integration" [...] cost Millar and Gough millions of dollars. The suit claimed that Warner Bros. failed to [...] "maximize profits" [...] in marketing Smallville, misrepresented production costs and sold the show to foreign markets at [...] "well below the value of the series", not specifying the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>compensation</b> sought by the plaintiffs. In a May 20, 2010 press release from The CW, Tom Welling was appointed an executive producer for Smallvilles tenth season.|$|E
500|$|Further, {{under the}} U.S. federal tax laws, even if labor were {{considered}} [...] "property" [...] the gain or income from [...] "labor property" [...] would {{be defined as}} the excess of the amount realized (for example, the money received) by the taxpayer over the amount of the taxpayer's [...] "adjusted basis" [...] in the [...] "property" [...] (see [...] ). Since the taxpayer can have only a zero [...] "basis" [...] amount {{in his or her own}} labor [...] the personal living expenses incurred to generate labor being both non-capitalizable and, under , non-deductible [...] the [...] "gain" [...] would thus be equal to the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>compensation</b> received by the taxpayer. Compare Carter v. Commissioner, where the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit stated: [...] "The assertion that proceeds received for personal services cannot be given a 'zero-basis for the purpose of the assessment of taxation,' is frivolous. This is a variation of the 'wages are not income' theme, which has been rejected repeatedly by this court." [...] See also Reading v. Commissioner (taxpayer's argument [...] that gain from labor of self-employed individual cannot be determined until the [...] "cost of doing labor" [...] has been subtracted from the amount received [...] was rejected; validity of , disallowing deductions for personal living expenses, was upheld). See also Burnett v. Commissioner (taxpayer's argument [...] that wages represent an equal exchange of property and, therefore, are not taxable income [...] was rejected).

500|$|In June 2001 the {{government}} established Indian Residential Schools Resolution Canada {{as an independent}} government department to manage the residential school file. In 2003, the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) process was launched {{as part of a}} larger National Resolution Framework which included health supports, a commemoration component and a strategy for litigation. As explained by the TRC, the ADR was designed as a [...] "voluntary process for resolution of certain claims of sexual abuse, physical abuse, and forcible confinement, without having to go through the civil litigation process". It was created by the Canadian government without consultation with Indigenous communities or former residential school students. The ADR system also made it the responsibility of the former students to prove that the abuse occurred and was intentional, resulting in former students finding the system difficult to navigate, re-traumatizing, and discriminatory. Many survivor advocacy groups and Indigenous political organizations such as the Assembly of First Nations (AFN) worked to have the ADR system dissolved. In 2004 the Assembly of First Nations released a report critical of the ADR underscoring, among other issues, the failure of survivors to automatically receive the full <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>compensation</b> without subsequent ligation against the church and failure to compensate for lost family, language and culture. The Canadian House of Commons Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development released its own report in April 2005 finding the ADR to be [...] "an excessively costly and inappropriately applied failure, for which the Minister and her officials are unable to raise a convincing defence". Within a month of the report's release a Supreme Court of Canada decision granted school attendees the right to pursue class-action suits, which ultimately led to a government review of the compensation process.|$|E

Additionally, the tribunal’s award <b>of</b> large <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>compensation</b> for several types of damages is particularly interesting.
