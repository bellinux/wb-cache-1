5|$|He {{appears to}} have taken little {{interest}} in his official duties both as paymaster and inspector-general, leaving affairs {{in the hands of}} Edmund Waters. Waters had been his private secretary, and when Villiers came to office as paymaster, Waters was appointed chief clerk in that department, rising to deputy paymaster in 1797. Waters and Villiers invested in real estate with some of the money passing through the office; unfortunately for Villiers, Waters was also diverting some of the funds to his own interest in the Opera House, and the accounts of the office were in <b>a</b> <b>shambles.</b>|$|E

With the generous settlement they seem to be destined to be perfectly happy, but the father dies, leaving his family in <b>a</b> <b>shambles</b> despite the money. Soon after this, Dobroselova announces that a rich man, Mr. Bykov who had dealings with Anna Fyodorovna and Pokrovsky's father, has proposed to her. She decides to leave with him, and the last few letters attest to her slowly becoming accustomed to her new money.|$|E

On 18 April, {{an attack by}} two patrol boats left the submarine's interior <b>a</b> <b>shambles</b> of broken glass, smashed instruments, and spilled hydraulic oil. Seahorse made hasty repairs and headed for Apra Harbor, Guam, and then to Pearl Harbor for overhaul.|$|E

Emotions ran high, with satirical cartoons, insults and passions aroused on both sides, the Whigs calling the Tories wastrels and the Tories calling the Whigs heartless. Whatever Eglinton's original intent, the tournament was symbolic of romantic defiance in the face of the spirit of revolution that was frightenting so much of old guard Europe during the second quarter of the 19th century.|$|E

The EPA turned the documents over to Congress several months later, after the White House abandoned its court claim that the documents could not be subpoenaed by Congress because they were covered by executive privilege.

25|$|Guisborough Town Hall (Grade II Listed) {{was built}} in 1821 and {{initially}} comprised two storeys, being extended to three in 1870. The Town Hall is located on Westgate and is a prominent building. The ground floor served as <b>a</b> <b>shambles,</b> or meat-market, with rooms above, {{some of which were}} used from the building's earliest days as solicitors' offices (Lewis 1831, 286 & Baines 1823, 3). The ground floor also contained a cell or vault (Harrison & Dixon 1981, 131). The town hall was last occupied by two firms of solicitors who vacated in 2014. Its proprietor, a limited company, entered receivership and the building was purchased by Redcar & Cleveland Borough Council due to local concern for its future. A community group has been constituted to keep the building in use while maintaining its historic integrity.|$|E
25|$|Task Review: Alpha wisely {{spent their}} time {{sourcing}} items before setting off, but had initial difficulties {{when they arrived}} at the market. However, they managed to collect all ten items without penalties, with Helene and Raef bargaining well for the cow hide and obtaining a second-hand Santos orange juicer in the last few minutes, despite buying it for a fair price. Meanwhile, Renaissance's execution of the task was <b>a</b> <b>shambles,</b> as Jennifer paid little attention to the dossiers, deciding to straight to the market and thus resulting in the team being disorganised and making mistakes, such as buying the wrong colour of mosque alarm clock, while Jenny and Michael attempted to bribe a sports store so to sabotage Alpha's efforts. The team effectively lost the task due to a combination of these mistakes, and the fines they received for purchasing unbranded tajines and a halal chicken instead of a kosher chicken.|$|E

25|$|After {{the attack}} {{aircraft}} had finished their bombing runs the six transports, {{which had been}} holding in wait to the east, commenced their formation run towards Cassinga {{at an altitude of}} 200 feet (60 m). Shortly before reaching the base, the six aircraft climbed to , the drop height, and lined up for the drop. However, required visual 'tracking and distance' co-ordination markers were obscured by smoke from the bombing run, the drop zone (DZ) box scaling and drop point distances were incorrect - due to the reconnaissance scaling errors - and the drop was <b>a</b> <b>shambles</b> with nearly all the paratroopers being dropped off-target, some on the West side of the river and some into tall maize where they had problems linking up. The resultant confusion caused numerous delays, ruining the schedule of the 'drop-to-contact' plan, and much of the advantage of surprise. The disastrous drop also meant that it would be nearly an hour before C-Company was able to move into position on {{the eastern side of the}} camp and seal off the escape routes and as a result a number of top PLAN commanders, including Dimo Amaambo and Greenwell Matongo (two principal targets of the attack) escaped (with Amaambo later becoming the first head of the Namibian Defence Force in 1990).|$|E
25|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity at {{the risk}} of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} while serving with the Third Battalion, Twenty-Third Marines, Fourth Marine Division, in combat against enemy Japanese forces during the seizure of Iwo Jima in the Volcano Islands, February 26, 1945. Promptly destroying a stubborn 20-mm. antiaircraft gun and its crew after assuming the duties of a bazooka man who had been killed, Private First Class Jacobson waged a relentless battle as his unit fought desperately toward the summit of Hill 382 in an effort to penetrate the heart of Japanese cross-island defenses. Employing his weapon with ready accuracy when his platoon was halted by overwhelming enemy fire on February 26, he first destroyed two hostile machine-gun positions, then attacked a large blockhouse, completely neutralizing the fortification before dispatching the five-man crew of a pillbox and exploding the installation with a terrific demolitions blast. Moving steadily forward, he wiped out an earth-covered rifle emplacement and, confronted by a cluster of similar emplacements which constituted the perimeter of enemy defenses in his assigned sector, fearlessly advanced, quickly reduced all six positions to <b>a</b> <b>shambles,</b> killed ten of the enemy and enabled our forces to occupy the strong point. Determined to widen the breach thus forced, he volunteered his services to an adjacent assault company, neutralized a pillbox holding up its advance, opened fire on a Japanese tank pouring a steady stream of bullets on one of our supporting tanks and smashed the enemy tank's gun turret in a brief but furious action culminating in a single-handed assault against still another blockhouse and the subsequent neutralization of its firepower. By his dauntless skill and valor, Private First Class Jacobson destroyed a total of sixteen enemy positions and annihilated approximately seventy-five Japanese, thereby contributing essentially to the success of his division's operations against the fanatically defended outpost of the Japanese Empire. His gallant conduct in the face of tremendous odds enhanced and sustained the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.|$|E

[...] According to him, squatter Hugh Jones had been threatened by demolition men wielding sledgehammers and pickaxes, adding [...] "the project has cost £500,000 in police time alone, to take over and demolish a 250-year-old chestnut tree {{and half a dozen}} houses" ...|$|E

A further delivery of 16 Spitfires, Operation Picket I, was attempted on 21 March, but this was less successful; only nine of the planes arrived. Thirteen Spitfire reinforcement operations were ultimately launched between March and October 1942, playing {{a key role in}} the siege.

The third match degenerated into <b>a</b> <b>shambles</b> as the Celtic players lost their composure and discipline.
