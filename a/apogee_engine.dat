5000|$|... #Caption: A 400 N hypergolic liquid <b>apogee</b> <b>engine,</b> {{including}} {{heat shield}} and mounting structure, {{on display at}} DLR visitors center, Lampoldshausen, Germany. The engine was designed for use on Symphonie satellites. These were the first three-axis stabilised communication satellites in geostationary orbit to use a liquid bipropellant <b>apogee</b> <b>engine</b> for orbit insertion.|$|E
50|$|According to Moog-ISP, the A2100 {{platform}} {{uses its}} LEROS bipropellant Liquid <b>Apogee</b> <b>Engine.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A {{simplified}} division can be {{made between}} <b>apogee</b> <b>engines</b> used for telecommunications and exploration missions: ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Apogee</b> <b>engines</b> {{typically}} use one {{fuel and}} one oxidizer. This propellant is usually, but not restricted to, a hypergolic combination such as: ...|$|R
50|$|Most <b>apogee</b> <b>engines</b> are {{operated}} in an on-off manner {{at a fixed}} thrust level. This is because the valves used only have two positions: open or closed.|$|R
5000|$|A typical liquid <b>apogee</b> <b>engine</b> scheme {{could be}} defined as an engine with: ...|$|E
5000|$|Liquid <b>Apogee</b> <b>Engine</b> - A liquid-propellant rocket used as {{the primary}} {{propulsion}} device on geostationary orbit satellites.|$|E
50|$|The {{spacecraft}} {{was intended}} to manoeuvre from the transfer orbit into which it was launched to its operational geosynchronous orbit {{by means of a}} Liquid <b>Apogee</b> <b>Engine</b> (LAE) and several Hall effect thrusters, a process which normally takes 105 days. However, the satellite's Liquid <b>Apogee</b> <b>Engine</b> malfunctioned shortly after ignition on both its first burn on 15 August 2010 and a second attempt on 17 August, and it was declared inoperable.|$|E
5000|$|LEROS is {{a family}} of {{chemical}} rocket engines manufactured by Moog-ISP at Westcott, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom. LEROS engines {{have been used as}} primary <b>apogee</b> <b>engines</b> for telecommunications satellites such as the Lockheed Martin A2100 [...] as well as deep space missions such as Juno.|$|R
50|$|They burn MMH and MON as propellant, have a thrust {{range between}} 340 N and 450 N and can vary the O/F ratio between 1.50 and 1.80. The chamber and throat {{are made of}} a {{platinum}} alloy, it uses double cone vortex injectors and uses both film and radiative cooling. The S400 engines are used as primary <b>apogee</b> <b>engines</b> for telecommunication satellite platforms such as the Spacebus of Thales Alenia Space as well as space exploration missions such as Venus Express, ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter or Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer.|$|R
40|$|A {{program to}} {{identify}} surplus solid rocket propellant engines {{which would be}} available for a program of functional integrity testing was conducted. The engines are classified as: (1) upper stage and <b>apogee</b> <b>engines,</b> (2) sounding rocket and launch vehicle engines, and (3) jato, sled, and tactical engines. Nearly all the engines were available because their age exceeds the warranted shelf life. The preference for testing included tests at nominal flight conditions, at design limits, and to establish margin limits. The principal failure modes of interest were case bond separation and grain bore cracking. Data concerning the identification and characteristics of each engine are tabulated. Methods for conducting the tests are described...|$|R

5000|$|The {{performance}} of an <b>apogee</b> <b>engine</b> is usually quoted {{in terms of}} vacuum specific impulse and vacuum thrust. However, {{there are many other}} details which influence performance: ...|$|E
5000|$|When {{launched}} by the U.S. Space Shuttle a solid propellant perigee stage (motor and carrier) would {{be attached to the}} bottom of the spacecraft. This carrier was used to mount the satellite into a cradle in the Space Shuttle cargo bay. The satellite was ejected from the space shuttle [...] "Frisbee-style" [...] which imparted a stabilizing spin to the satellite. The satellite was allowed to drift a safe distance from the space shuttle before the perigee motor was fired. The perigee motor provided energy (velocity) to the satellite to raise the apogee of the satellite's orbit; it is named for the location in the orbit at which it is used. The perigee motor was jettisoned after it was used. The liquid fuel <b>apogee</b> <b>engines</b> of the Intelsat VI satellites were then used to boost the perigee of the satellite and provide orbit circularization through apogee burns.|$|R
40|$|Engines with area {{ratios of}} 44 : 1 and 286 : 1 are tested {{by means of}} hot fire tests using the NTO/MMH {{bipropellant}} to maximize {{the performance of the}} combined technologies. The low-thrust engine systems are designed with oxidation resistant materials that can operate at temperatures of more than 2204 C for tens of hours. The chamber is attached to the injector in a configuration that prevents overheating of the injector, valve, and the spacecraft interface. Three injectors with 44 : 1 area ratios are capable of nominal specific impulse values of 309 sec, and a performance of 321 lbf-sec/lbm is noted for an all-welded engine assembly with area ratio of 286 : 1. The all-welded engine is shown to have an acceptable design margin for thermal characteristics. High-performance liquid <b>apogee</b> <b>engines</b> are shown to perform optimally when based on iridium/rhenium chamber technology, use of a special platelet injector, and the minimization of losses due to fuel-film cooling...|$|R
50|$|When {{launched}} by the Ariane 4 the satellite would be mounted to a SPELDA adapter (a satellite payload carrier system), which is mounted {{on the top of}} the Ariane 4 rocket. A protective shroud or fairing covers the satellite and upper stage and protects it from aerodynamic forces (high speed air flow) during launch. The fairing is jettisoned when the rocket has reached the upper atmosphere and the aerodynamic forces are no longer significant. When the upper stage has finished firing and is coasting, the upper stage (and satellite) was spun up to 5 rpm prior to release of the satellite. This provides initial stability for the satellite after release from the rocket upper stage. The Ariane 4 put the Intelsat VI satellites directly into a transfer orbit. Ground commands would fire the <b>apogee</b> <b>engines</b> for circularizing of the initial orbit and stabilization at the desired geostationary orbital location. Ground commands would then also be used to command the satellite to spin up to its normal spin rate.|$|R
50|$|The name <b>apogee</b> <b>engine</b> {{derives from}} the type of {{manoeuvre}} for which the engine is typically used, i.e. an in-space delta-v change made at the apogee of an elliptical orbit in order to circularise it. For geostationary satellites, this type of orbital manoeuvre is performed to transition from a geostationary transfer orbit and place the satellite on station in a circular geostationary orbit. Despite the name, an <b>apogee</b> <b>engine</b> {{can be used for}} a range of other manoeuvres, such as end-of-life deorbit, Earth orbit escape, planetary orbit insertion and planetary descent/ascent.|$|E
50|$|A typical 500 N-class hypergolic liquid <b>apogee</b> <b>engine</b> has {{a vacuum}} {{specific}} impulse {{in the region}} of 320 s, with the practical limit estimated to be near 335 s.|$|E
50|$|For {{geostationary}} satellites, {{the launch}} vehicle typically carries the spacecraft to Geostationary Transfer Orbit, or GTO. From this elliptical orbit, the LEOP generally includes {{a sequence of}} <b>apogee</b> <b>engine</b> firings to reach the circular geostationary orbit.|$|E
50|$|The {{spacecraft}} would {{consist of}} four parts: An <b>apogee</b> kick <b>engine</b> to provide orbital injection for a cruise vehicle that carries the Northern Light lander and the Beaver Rover to a direct rendezvous with Mars using a Hohmann transfer orbit. Atmospheric entry would be achieved by a heat shield, parachute and airbag deployment system. The lander would transfer the rover to the Martian surface. Once deployed on the Martian surface, the lander contacts Earth directly utilizing the 46m parabolic antenna located at the Algonquin Radio Observatory.|$|R
40|$|The Space Storable Rocket Technology Program (SSRT) was {{conducted}} to establish a technology for {{a new class of}} high performance and long life bipropellant engines using space storable propellants. The results are described. Task 1 evaluated several characteristics for a number of fuels to determine the best space storable fuel for use with LO 2. The results indicated that LO 2 -N 2 H 4 is the best propellant combination and provides the maximum mission/system capability maximum payload into GEO of satellites. Task 2 developed two models, performance and thermal. The performance model indicated the performance goal of specific impulse greater than or = 340 seconds (sigma = 204) could be achieved. The thermal model was developed and anchored to hot fire test data. Task 3 consisted of design, fabrication, and testing of a 200 lbf thrust test engine operating at a chamber pressure of 200 psia using LO 2 -N 2 H 4. A total of 76 hot fire tests were conducted demonstrating performance greater than 340 (sigma = 204) which is a 25 second specific impulse improvement over the existing highest performance flight <b>apogee</b> type <b>engines...</b>|$|R
40|$|Radiation-cooled rockets {{are used}} {{for a range of}} low-thrust {{propulsion}} functions, including apogee insertion, attitude control, and repositioning of satellites, reaction control of launch vehicles, and primary propulsion for planetary space- craft. The key to high performance and long lifetimes for radiation-cooled rockets is the chamber temperature capability. The material system that is currently used for radiation-cooled rockets, a niobium alloy (C 103) with a fused silica coating, has a maximum operating temperature of 1370 C. Temperature limitations of C 103 rockets force the use of fuel film cooling, which degrades rocket performance and, in some cases, imposes a plume contamination issue from unburned fuel. A material system composed of a rhenium (Re) substrate and an iridium (Ir) coating has demonstrated operation at high temperatures (2200 C) and for long lifetimes (hours). The added thermal margin afforded by iridium-coated rhenium (Ir/Re) allows reduction or elimination of fuel film cooling. This, in turn, leads to higher performance and cleaner spacecraft environments. There are ongoing government- and industry-sponsored efforts to develop flight Ir/ Re engines, with the primary focus on 440 -N, <b>apogee</b> insertion <b>engines.</b> Complementing these Ir/Re engine development efforts is a program to address specific concerns and fundamental characterization of the Ir/Re material system, including (1) development of Ir/Re rocket fabrication methods, (2) establishment of critical Re mechanical properly data, (3) development of reliable joining methods, and (4) characterization of Ir/Re life-limiting mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|Component {{performance}} assessment {{testing for}} a, pressure-fed earth storable bipropellant rocket engine was successfully completed at Aerojet's Redmond test facility. The {{primary goal of}} the this development project {{is to increase the}} specific impulse of an <b>apogee</b> class bi-propellant <b>engine</b> to greater than 330 seconds with nitrogen tetroxide and monomethylhydrazine propellants and greater than 335 seconds with nitrogen tetroxide and hydrazine. The secondary goal of the project is to take greater advantage of the high temperature capabilities of iridium/rhenium chambers. In order to achieve these goals, the propellant feed pressures were increased to 400 psia, nominal, which in turn increased the chamber pressure and temperature, allowing for higher c*. The tests article used a 24 -on- 24 unlike doublet injector design coupled with a copper heat sink chamber to simulate a flight configuration combustion chamber. The injector is designed to produce a nominal 200 lbf of thrust with a specific impulse of 335 seconds (using hydrazine fuel). Effect of Chamber length on engine C* performance was evaluated with the use of modular, bolt-together test hardware and removable chamber inserts. Multiple short duration firings were performed to characterize injector performance across a range of thrust levels, 180 to 220 lbf, and mixture ratios, from 1. 1 to 1. 3. During firing, ignition transient, chamber pressure, and various temperatures were measured in order to evaluate the performance of the engine and characterize the thermal conditions. The tests successfully demonstrated the stable operation and performance potential of a full scale engine with a measured c* of XXXX ft/sec (XXXX m/s) under nominal operational conditions...|$|R
40|$|ConeXpress is an {{affordable}} multi-mission platform {{that will be}} launched as auxiliary payload on the Ariane 5 launcher and as such it exploits the excess launch capacity of Ariane 5 for easy access to space. The satellite {{can be used for}} different missions depending on the payload placed in it. The primary objective of ConeXpress is to perform in-orbit servicing. Two years ago the company Orbital Recovery Ltd started to pursue the market of in-orbit servicing and has now teamed with Dutch Space to develop ConeXpress as an Orbital Recovery System. ConeXpress Orbital Recovery System will prolong the operational life of telecommunication satellites by supplying guidance, navigation and propulsion for station keeping and attitude control for an additional 8 - 10 years. This Master’s Thesis is concerned with the docking phase of the ConeXpress project. The model for the baseline docking phase is currently being developed at Dutch Space and the main mechanical element of the docking system is the Capture Tool, constructed by DLR in Germany. The Capture Tool is inserted into the <b>apogee</b> kick <b>engine</b> nozzle of a client satellite where it expands and locks in the throat of the engine nozzle. This Master’s Thesis will deal with a possible alternative concept to the docking phase. This approach will reduce the mass of the satellite by using only sensors and control and not any mechanical structures that would complicate the docking. Using the alternative concept for docking the Capture Tool could be abandoned and also the high position and orientation control requirements associated with it. The work started with an investigation of possible alternative docking concepts and after a trade-off the most suitable concept, a 3 D Laser Camera System from the Canadian company Neptec, was chosen for further investigation. In order to test the performance a model of the camera system needed to be implemented in the DSF, the Design Simulation Facility (based on MATLAB/Simulink) : the simulation environment used in the ConeXpress project. To get acquainted with the program, simulations were first made on the original docking concept and also on the rendezvous phase. After this, simulations for the docking phase using the Neptec 3 D Laser Camera System were started. A simplified version of the System, based on the docking camera with range, field of view and resolution adapted for the Neptec system was implemented in the simulator. The results from this simple model clearly showed first of all that the control system of the satellite in the simulator needed to be improved {{to be able to handle}} the higher speeds and longer range during the docking phase, but also that the Neptec 3 D Laser Camera System handles the procedure well. It is therefore an interesting alternative to the Capture Tool docking approach and should be investigated further. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
