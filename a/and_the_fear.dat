5|$|Jacob L. Beilhart (March 4, 1867 – November 24, 1908) was {{the founder}} and leader of a communitarian group known as the Spirit Fruit Society. Beilhart {{believed}} that jealousy, materialism, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of losing another's love were {{at the root of}} much of the illness in the world. Under his direction, the Spirit Fruit Society sought to model and practice those beliefs.|$|E

5|$|Mark and Lauritsen {{started the}} band Warship, which {{released}} one album and announced its break-up on their Myspace page December 30, 2009. Soon after, Mark formed the band Tidal Arms with friends Tom Tierney and Patrick Southern. Deneeve and Emanuel singer Matthew Breen {{came together to}} create the band Summer Law, which was disbanded after several months so that Deneeve could focus on attending culinary academy in hopes of becoming a Master Pastry Chef.

5|$|J. B. Haggin, an American breeder {{and owner}} of Elmendorf Farm, had begun to ship large contingents of horses to England for sale, {{including}} the 1908 Grand National steeplechase winner Rubio, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> was that if other American breeders followed his lead, the English racing market would be overwhelmed. As a first step, the English racing authorities began {{to limit the number}} of training licences at Newmarket Racecourse, turning away a number of American breeders. The General Stud Book rules for registration were also amended in 1909 to restrict registration to horses whose ancestry entirely traced to horses already registered in the General Stud Book, but horses registered in other national stud books were still allowed to be imported and registered.|$|E
5|$|Nehru died in May 1964 and Lal Bahadur Shastri became Prime Minister of India. Shastri and {{his senior}} cabinet members Morarji Desai and Gulzari Lal Nanda were strong {{supporters}} of Hindi being the sole official language. This increased the apprehension that Nehru's assurances of 1959 and 1963 {{would not be}} kept despite Shastri's assurances to the contrary. Concerns over the preference of Hindi in central government jobs, civil service examinations <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> that English would be replaced with Hindi as medium of instruction brought students into the anti-Hindi imposition agitation camp in large numbers. On 7 March 1964, the chief minister of Madras State, M. Bhaktavatsalam at a session of the Madras Legislative Assembly recommended the introduction of Three-language formula (English, Hindi and Tamil) in the state. Apprehension over the Three-language formula increased student support for the anti-Hindi cause.|$|E

5|$|Not all Heathens {{practice}} seiðr; {{given its}} associations {{with both the}} ambiguity of sexuality and gender and the gods Odin and Loki in their unreliable trickster forms, many on the Heathen movement's right wing disapprove of it. Although there are heterosexual male practitioners, seiðr is largely associated with women and gay men. One member of the Troth, Edred Thorsson, developed forms of seiðr which involved sex magic utilizing sado-masochistic techniques, something which generated controversy in the community. Part of the discomfort that some Heathens feel toward seiðr surrounds {{the lack of any}} criteria by which the community can determine whether the seiðr-worker has genuinely received divine communication, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> that it will be used by some practitioners merely to bolster their own prestige.|$|E
5|$|The Manhattan Project {{intelligence}} staff {{believed that}} the Japanese atomic program was not far advanced because Japan had little access to uranium ore, the industrial effort required exceeded Japan's capacity, and, according to American physicists at the University of California, Berkeley, who knew the leading Japanese physicists personally, there were too few Japanese qualified {{to work in the}} area. Conversely, German scientists had reputations as leaders in the field, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of Germany developing nuclear weapons first {{was one of the reasons}} for the establishment of the Manhattan Project. The Chancellor of Germany, Adolf Hitler, frequently claimed that Germany was developing secret weapons, and it was feared that these might include nuclear weapons. Reports of German nuclear activity were taken very seriously. At the instigation of the Manhattan Project, Norwegian saboteurs and Allied bombers attacked heavy-water infrastructure in German-occupied Norway in late 1942 and early 1943.|$|E

Young learned that the Joker had been funding her research to create an army of superhuman henchmen; her refusal to hand over the formula precipitated Joker's return to the Asylum. While searching for Young, Batman is again attacked by Scarecrow <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> toxin, and hallucinates the night of his parents' deaths. After he recovers, Batman destroys Young's Titan formula and rescues Young from Victor Zsasz. An explosion kills Young and the Joker obtains the completed batches of Titan.|$|E

5|$|The 1931 British Census {{recorded}} {{more than}} 1,000 Cypriot-born people, {{but many of}} these were the children of British military personnel serving in the Mediterranean. However, some Greek Cypriots did migrate to the UK in the 1920s and 1930s, often finding jobs in the catering industry in Soho. By the start of the Second World War, there were around 8,000 Cypriots in London. More Cypriot immigrants arrived during the National Organisation of Cypriot Fighters (EOKA)'s campaign for Cypriot independence from Britain and union with Greece, which started in 1955. In the four years of conflict, an average of 4,000 Cypriots left the island per year for the UK, because of violence on the island <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> felt by both Greek and Turkish Cypriots in mixed villages where they formed minorities. Migration peaked following independence in 1960, with around 25,000 Cypriots migrating in the year that followed. Many migrants joined family already living in Britain. Further migration accompanied the Turkish invasion of the island in 1974. Home Office figures show that roughly 10,000 Cypriots fled to the UK, the majority of them refugees, but many of them subsequently returned to the island.|$|E
5|$|The {{right to}} be identified, known as the right of paternity, applies to the creators of {{original}} literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works; for films, the {{right to be}} identified is granted to the director rather than the writer. Some specific types of work are not protected by this right, particularly those made to report current events, periodicals, newspapers or encyclopaedias. These exceptions were included as a result of lobbying by the publishing industry, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> that the need to name the author of a current events report could interfere with its speedy delivery, and undermine the image of the news as objective and neutral. Under Section 79, {{the right to be}} identified also does not apply to authors of computer programs, computer-generated works, typefaces or works protected by crown copyright. On those works which are covered by this moral right, {{there is a need to}} assert it; this may be done through an instrument assigning copyright, or any other instrument written by the author or director. If the asserting is done through a document designed to assign copyright, it binds the assignee and anyone who claims through him, with or without notice; if it is done through another instrument, it only applies to those who are directly informed of the assertion.|$|E
5|$|The team {{decides to}} try a {{different}} location on the planet, {{in the hope of}} moving away from the sentience they believe to be in the forest. They find that the fear emanations can be felt at their new camp as well, which is in a grassland, which makes them realize that the sentience extends over all of the vegetation on the planet. Osden also realizes that this sentience has never been in contact with anything alien before; thus it experienced fear when the explorers landed. Osden decides to attempt to communicate with the sentience, with the help of Tomiko and two others. They land {{in the middle of a}} forest, where a surge in the fear response kills one of them. Osden leaves the group, and by surrendering to the fear completely makes the planet understand that they mean it no harm; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> emanations cease. The group tries to locate Osden, but is unable to find him; Tomiko suspects that he does not want to be found. They leave him enough provisions for the rest of his life, and return to Terra after finishing the survey.|$|E
