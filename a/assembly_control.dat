Formerly the State Affairs Commission, from its founding in 1972 (originally the National Defence Commission), {{was part of the}} Central People's Committee while the Ministry of the People's Armed Forces, from 1982 onward, was under direct presidential control. At the Eighteenth session of the sixth Central People's Committee, held on 23 May 1990, the SAC became established as its own independent commission, rising to the same status as the CPC (now the Cabinet of North Korea) and not subordinated to it, as was the case before. Concurrent with this, Kim Jong-il was appointed first vice-chairman of the State Affairs Commission. The following year, on 24 December 1991, Kim Jong-il was appointed Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army. Four months later, on 20 April 1992, Kim Jong-il was awarded the rank of Marshal and his father, in virtue of being the KPA's founding commander in chief, became Grand Marshal as a result and one year later he became the Chairman of the State Affairs Commission, by now under Supreme People's <b>Assembly</b> <b>control</b> under the then 1992 constitution as amended.|$|E

To {{achieve the}} <b>assembly</b> process <b>control</b> of aerospace complex precision mechanical systems and ensure its dynamic characteristics, parallel control theory and methodology {{is used in}} the assembly process. The main point is: <b>assembly</b> parallel <b>control</b> system is built corresponding to the actual assembly ones. The ultimate quality of assembly is guaranteed via alignment influence analysis on the dynamics characteristics of the assembly joint structural and the assembly machine and the dynamic characteristics-oriented alignment process optimization and decision-making to carry out computing operator and process decision-making in the assembly process.

40|$|Characteristics such as decentralized, autonomous, self-planning, self-controlled, and {{teamwork}} describe the trends or {{the nature of}} modern assembly systems which are usually hybrid. These accompanied with the continuously increasing number of variants and shorter product life cycle require reusable assembly units which are flexible and modular, {{as well as an}} efficient job order processing. The system should be free configurable based on the new product structure and features, and the <b>assembly</b> <b>control</b> must integrate the available information used and generated the system planning. This paper presents an integrated approach, starting from product structure to design an object-oriented assembly system model, and based on this computer-internal model to control the assembly sequence and operation according to the job orders. The characteristics of modern assembly will be summarized. The requirements on the planning of such an assembly system and <b>assembly</b> <b>control</b> are postulated. An archite cture for integrated assembly system planning and control will be described. The objects for such a system are then derived. The applicability of this approach will be shown on a concrete example of a subassembly from a transportation vehicles manufacturer...|$|E
40|$|In Dictyostelium discoideum, myosin II resides {{predominantly}} in a soluble pool as {{the result}} of phosphorylation of the myosin heavy chain (MHC), and dephosphorylation of the MHC is required for myosin II filament assembly, recruitment to the cytoskeleton, and force production. Protein phosphatase type 2 A (PP 2 A) was identified in earlier studies in Dictyostelium as a key biochemical activity that can drive MHC dephosphorylation. We report here gene targeting and cell biological studies addressing the roles of candidate PP 2 A B regulatory subunits (phr 2 aBα and phr 2 aBβ) in myosin II <b>assembly</b> <b>control</b> in vivo. Dictyostelium phr 2 aBα- and phr 2 aBβ-null cells show delayed development, reduction in the assembly of myosin II in cytoskeletal ghost assays, and defects in cytokinesis when grown in suspension compared to parental cell lines. These results demonstrate that the PP 2 A B subunits phr 2 aBα and phr 2 aBβ contribute to myosin II <b>assembly</b> <b>control</b> in vivo, with phr 2 aBα having the predominant role facilitating MHC dephosphorylation to facilitate filament assembly...|$|E
40|$|The {{critical}} Casimir effect {{provides a}} thermodynamic analogue of the well-known quantum mechanical Casimir effect. It acts between two surfaces {{immersed in a}} critical binary liquid mixture, and results from the confinement of concentration fluctuations of the solvent. Unlike the quantum mechanical effect, the magnitude and range of this attraction can be adjusted with temperature via the solvent correlation length, thus offering new opportunities for the assembly of nano and micron-scale structures. Here, we demonstrate the active <b>assembly</b> <b>control</b> of equilibrium phases using critical Casimir forces. We guide colloidal particles into analogues of molecular liquid and solid phases via exquisite control over their interactions. By measuring the critical Casimir particle pair potential directly from density fluctuations in the colloidal gas, we obtain insight into liquefaction at small scales: We apply the Van der Waals model of molecular liquefaction and show that the colloidal gas-liquid condensation is accurately described by the Van der Waals theory, even {{on the scale of}} a few particles. These results open up new possibilities in the active <b>assembly</b> <b>control</b> of micro and nanostructures...|$|E
