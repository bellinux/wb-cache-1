5|$|The {{north-eastern}} {{boundary of}} this geologic region {{is marked by}} the Murihiku escarpment, which runs along {{the southern edge of}} the dormant Hillfoot fault line. The Catlins ranges are strike ridges composed of Triassic and Jurassic sandstones, mudstones and other related sedimentary rocks, often with <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> feldspar. Fossils of the late and middle Triassic Warepan and Kaihikuan stages are found in the area.|$|E
5|$|Burnet's work on graft-versus-host was in {{collaboration}} with Lone Simonsen between 1960 and 1962. Simonsen had shown in 1957 that when a chick embryo was inoculated intravenously with adult-fowl blood, a graft-versus-host reaction occurred; this {{was known as the}} Simonsen phenomenon. Their work in this system would later help to explain passenger leukocytes in transplantation. The last project he worked on at the Institute was a study with assistant Margaret Holmes of autoimmune disease in the New Zealand black mouse model; this mouse has <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> spontaneous autoimmune hemolytic anemia. They looked at the inheritance of autoimmune disease, and their use of immunosuppressive drug cyclophosphamide to treat the disease influenced the use of immunosuppressive drugs in human autoimmune disease.|$|E
5|$|Only {{recently}} have attempts to improve {{health in the}} developing world concentrated on not only physical illness but also mental health. Deliberate self-harm is common {{in the developing world}}. Research into self-harm in the developing world is however still very limited although an important case study is that of Sri Lanka, which is a country exhibiting <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> suicide and self-poisoning with agricultural pesticides or natural poisons. Many people admitted for deliberate self-poisoning during a study by Eddleston et al. were young and few expressed a desire to die, but death was relatively common in the young in these cases. The improvement of medical management of acute poisoning in the developing world is poor and improvements are required in order to reduce mortality.|$|E
50|$|The {{susceptibility}} {{testing in}} vitro to glucocorticoids on patient's {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} {{is associated with}} the <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> not optimal clinical responses: the most sensitive patients in vitro have shown <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> corticodependence, while the most resistant patients in vitro showed <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> ineffective therapy.|$|R

50|$|In {{the general}} population, the major {{risk factors for}} {{heterotopic}} pregnancy {{are the same as}} those for ectopic pregnancy. For women in an assisted reproductive program, there are additional factors: <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> multiple ovulation, <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> tubal malformation and/or tubal damage, and technical factors in embryo transfer which may increase the risk for ectopic and heterotopic pregnancy.|$|R
5|$|The {{high levels}} of poverty in the East End have, {{throughout}} history, corresponded with <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> crime. From earliest times, crime depended, as did labour, on the importing of goods to London, and their interception in transit. Theft occurred in the river, on the quayside and in transit to the City warehouses. This was why, in the 17th century, the East India Company built high-walled docks at Blackwall and had them guarded to minimise the vulnerability of their cargoes. Armed convoys would then take the goods to the company's secure compound in the City. The practice {{led to the creation}} of ever-larger docks throughout the area, and large roads to drive through the crowded 19th century slums to carry goods from the docks.|$|E
5|$|Debate {{has been}} going on about whether the tail spikes were used for display only, as posited by Gilmore in 1914 or used as a weapon. Robert Bakker noted the tail was likely to have been much more {{flexible}} than that of other dinosaurs, as it lacked ossified tendons, thus lending credence to the idea of the tail as a weapon. However, as Carpenter has noted, the plates overlap so many tail vertebrae, movement would be limited. Bakker also observed that Stegosaurus could have maneuvered its rear easily, by keeping its large hind limbs stationary and pushing off with its very powerfully muscled but short fore limbs, allowing it to swivel deftly to deal with attack. More recently, a study of tail spikes by McWhinney et al., which showed <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> trauma-related damage, lends more weight to the position that the spikes were indeed used in combat. This study showed that 9.8% of Stegosaurus specimens examined had injuries to their tail spikes. Additional support for this idea was a punctured tail vertebra of an Allosaurus into which a tail spike fits perfectly.|$|E
5|$|Epileptic {{seizures}} are {{the most}} important adverse effect of bupropion. <b>A</b> <b>high</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> seizures was responsible for the temporary withdrawal of the drug from the market between 1986 and 1989. The risk of seizure is strongly dose-dependent, but also dependent on the preparation. The sustained-release preparation is associated with a seizure incidence of 0.1% at daily dosages of less than 300mg of bupropion and 0.4% at 300–400mg. The immediate release preparation is associated with a seizure incidence of 0.4% for dosages below 450mg; the incidence climbs to 5% for dosages between 450–600mg per day. For comparison, the incidence of unprovoked seizure in the general population is 0.07 to 0.09%, and the risk of seizure for a variety of other antidepressants is generally between 0.1 and 1.5% at recommended dosage levels. Clinical depression itself has been reported to increase the occurrence of seizures, and a study examining FDA clinical trial data has suggested that in most cases, low to moderate doses of antidepressants may not actually increase seizure risk at all. However, this study also found that bupropion and clomipramine were unique among antidepressants in that they were associated with increased incidence of seizures.|$|E

50|$|In general, the {{prognosis}} for retinal migraine {{is similar to}} that of migraine headache with typical aura. As the true <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> retinal migraine is unknown, it is uncertain whether there is <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> permanent neuroretinal injury. The visual field data suggests that there is <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> end arteriolar distribution infarction and <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> permanent visual field defects in retinal migraine than in clinically manifest cerebral infarctions in migraine with aura. One study suggests that more than half of reported recurrent cases of retinal migraine subsequently experienced permanent visual loss in that eye from infarcts, but more recent studies suggest such loss is a relatively rare side effect.|$|R
5|$|Erin Ryan and {{her colleagues}} {{performed}} a 2009 study {{on the effect of}} the use of American Sign Language (ASL) in Blue's Clues episodes. They analyzed 16 episodes over two weeks for the content and frequency of the signs used and found <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> ASL usage by various characters, but that it was inconsistent, especially in the connection between English words and their corresponding signs. The purpose of signed communication and its connection with ASL and the Deaf community was not clearly explained, either. The researchers speculated that hearing children with no previous ASL exposure would be familiarized with ASL and the deaf by these episodes, thus reducing the stigma attached to deafness and hard of hearing individuals. Based on other research about the positive effects of teaching ASL to hearing children, the researchers also speculated that it could lead to an increase of vocabulary skills and IQ, as well as improve interpersonal communication. They surmised that deaf children would feel more included and less isolated and be provided with the opportunity to view positive models of ASL and deaf people.|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to describe the relationship of high somatic cell count (SCC) with the <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> abnormal postpartum resumption of ovarian cyclicity and reproductive performance in dairy cows. The factors influencing SCC were also investigated. Four hundred and forty-seven cows from six dairy herds in Japan were monitored for SCC and postpartum resumption of ovarian cyclicity. Cows with high SCC (200, 000 to 500, 000) had <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> prolonged luteal phase (P 500, 000) also showed <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> delayed first ovulation post partum than cows with an SCC ≤ 500, 000 (P < 0. 05) during the first month post partum. Cows with an SCC of 200, 000 to 500, 000 showed lower conception and pregnancy rates, and more days from calving to conception than cows with an SCC of less than 200, 000 (P < 0. 05). Cows in parity 5 or more had <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>high</b> SCC than cows in the first and second parities (P < 0. 05).
