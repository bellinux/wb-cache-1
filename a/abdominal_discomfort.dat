30|$|One {{third of}} the {{patients}} were operated as emergencies, compared to the higher incidence of 75  % reported in pediatric series (El-Gohary et al. 2010). Many patients had ongoing <b>abdominal</b> <b>discomforts</b> since childhood, while others encountered a relatively sudden onset of symptoms leading to chronic episodes of abdominal pain. A considerable proportion of the patients in this series had reached a high age before being informed of their abnormality. Gastroenterologists and surgeons treating adults probably put less emphasis {{on the possibility of}} a congenital malformation causing the abdominal symptoms (Nehra and Goldstein 2011; Nagdeve et al. 2012).|$|R
40|$|Tegaserod is a {{selective}} partial agonist acting on serotonergic type 4 receptors (5 -HT(4)). Pharmacodynamic {{studies indicate that}} tegaserod is able to stimulate gut propulsion and secretion with a net prokinetic effect. In contrast to other 5 -HT(4) agonists endowed with a complex pharmacological profile, tegaserod has a reliable prokinetic activity in the colon.

25|$|Iron supplementation {{decreases}} {{the rates of}} donor deferral due to low hemoglobin, both at the first donation visit and at subsequent donations. Iron-supplemented donors have higher hemoglobin and iron stores. On the other hand, iron supplementation frequently causes diarrhea, constipation and epigastric <b>abdominal</b> <b>discomfort.</b> The long-term effects of iron supplementation without measurement of iron stores are unknown.|$|E
25|$|Another {{possible}} cause of diarrhea is {{irritable bowel syndrome}} (IBS), which usually presents with <b>abdominal</b> <b>discomfort</b> relieved by defecation and unusual stool (diarrhea or constipation) for at least 3 days a week over the previous 3 months. Symptoms of diarrhea-predominant IBS can be managed {{through a combination of}} dietary changes, soluble fiber supplements and medications such as loperamide or codeine. About 30% of patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS have bile acid malabsorption diagnosed with an abnormal SeHCAT test.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} soluble carbohydrates {{of mature}} soybeans are the disaccharide sucrose (range 2.5–8.2%), the trisaccharide raffinose (0.1–1.0%) composed of one sucrose molecule connected to one molecule of galactose, and the tetrasaccharide stachyose (1.4 to 4.1%) composed of one sucrose connected to two molecules of galactose. While the oligosaccharides raffinose and stachyose protect {{the viability of}} the soybean seed from desiccation (see above section on physical characteristics) they are not digestible sugars, so contribute to flatulence and <b>abdominal</b> <b>discomfort</b> in humans and other monogastric animals, comparable to the disaccharide trehalose. Undigested oligosaccharides are broken down in the intestine by native microbes, producing gases such as carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and methane.|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} the efficacy and tolerability of octatropine methyl bromide plus diazepam (Valpinax) {{in patients with}} irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We conducted a randomized, double-blind, multicentre study in 186 patients aged 18 - 65 years with IBS diagnosed according to Rome II criteria. Following a 2 -week washout period, patients received octatropine plus diazepam 40 mg/ 2. 5 mg twice daily or placebo for 6 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was response to a weekly question: "did you have satisfactory relief of your <b>abdominal</b> pain and <b>discomfort</b> during the last week?" Other endpoints included abdominal swelling, <b>abdominal</b> pain and <b>discomfort,</b> symptom severity, {{and the number of}} bowel movements. A prespecified subgroup analysis was conducted in patients with an <b>abdominal</b> pain and <b>discomfort</b> score > or = 3. The primary efficacy endpoint showed a tendency towards a statistically significant benefit for octatropine plus diazepam over placebo among patients with a baseline <b>abdominal</b> pain and <b>discomfort</b> score of > or = 3 (3 vs. 0 patients; p = 0. 059). Octatropine plus diazepam demonstrated significant improvements from baseline in all parameters assessed, but not compared with placebo. Adverse events were reported in 15. 1 % of patients receiving octatropine plus diazepam. Patients with IBS and an <b>abdominal</b> pain and <b>discomfort</b> score of > or = 3, who may be considered in the active phase of the disease, may derive some benefits from octatropine plus diazepam. This study highlights that Rome II criteria should be considered with particular care in the design of a clinical trial, since it does not consider disease activity level on admission...|$|R

25|$|Many ADPKD {{patients}} suffer symptomatic sequelae {{in consequence}} of the disease, such as cyst hemorrhage, flank pain, recurrent infections, nephrolithiasis, and symptoms of mass effect (i.e., early satiety, nausea and vomiting, and <b>abdominal</b> <b>discomfort),</b> from their enlarged kidneys. In such cases, nephrectomy can be required due to intractable symptoms or when, {{in the course of}} preparing for renal transplantation, the native kidneys are found to impinge upon the true pelvis and preclude the placement of a donor allograft. Additionally, native nephrectomy may be undertaken in the presence of suspected malignancy, as renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is 2 to 3 times more likely in the ADPKD population in end stage renal disease (ESRD) than in the ESRD patients without ADPKD. Although the indications for nephrectomy in ADPKD may be related to kidney size, the decision to proceed with native nephrectomy is often undertaken on an individual basis, without specific reference to kidney size measurements.|$|E
25|$|Horses {{with a large}} colon {{impaction}} {{usually have}} mild signs that slowly get worse if the impaction does not resolve, and can produce severe signs. Diagnosis is often made by rectal palpation of the mass, although {{this is not always}} accurate since a portion of the colon is not palpable on rectal. Additional sections of intestines may be distended if there is fluid backup. Manure production decreases, and if passed, is usually firm, dry and mucus covered. Horses are treated with analgesics, fluid therapy, mineral oil, dactyl sodium sulfosuccinate (DSS), and/or epsom salts. Analgesics usually can control the <b>abdominal</b> <b>discomfort,</b> but may become less efficacious over time if the impaction does not resolve. Persistent impactions may require fluids administered both intravenously and orally via nasogastric tube, at a rate 2–4 times the maintenance for the animal. Feed is withheld. Horses that do not improve or become very painful, or those that have large amounts of gas distention, are recommended to undergo surgery to remove the impaction via enterotomy of the pelvic flexure. Approximately 95% of horses that undergo medical management, and 58% of surgical cases, survive.|$|E

40|$|Background: Polycystic {{liver disease}} (PLD) {{is a low}} {{frequency}} disease in the worldwide population. Surgical cyst fenestration {{is the most effective}} treatment for symptomatic PLD. Nowadays, single port laparoscopic surgery yields better cosmetic results and comparable short-term outcomes compared to conventional surgery. We report the effective application of a single port laparoscopic surgery in patients with symptomatic PLD. Methods: The first patients is a 42 -years old female. The second patient is a 52 -years old female. Patients complained <b>abdominal</b> <b>discomforts</b> and bloating after meal. after computed tomography(CT) and Magnetic resonance imaging, Polycystic liver disease was diagnosed in both patients. Results: We performed single port laparoscopic cyst fenestration for PLD. Cyst fenestration was successfully completed without intraoperative complications. Patients were discharged on postoperative day 3. We performed postoperative CT scan in outpatient’s department after postoperative 7 days. We cannot find postoperative complications. Conclusions: Single port laparoscopic cystic fenestrations are safe and effective procedure for the treatment of symptomatic PLD. This is optimal treatment in patients of symptomatic PLD...|$|R
50|$|Hernias may be {{asymptomatic}} {{and present}} {{only as a}} bulge of the umbilicus. Symptoms may develop when the contracting abdominal wall causes pressure on the hernia contents.

500|$|For {{women with}} {{injuries}} above T6, a risk during labor and delivery that threatens {{both mother and}} fetus is autonomic dysreflexia, in which the blood pressure increases to dangerous levels high enough to cause potentially deadly stroke. Drugs such as nifedipine and captopril {{can be used to}} manage an episode if it occurs, and epidural anesthesia helps although it is not very reliable in women with SCI. [...] Anesthesia is used for labor and delivery even for women without sensation, who may only experience contractions as <b>abdominal</b> <b>discomfort,</b> increased spasticity, and episodes of autonomic dysreflexia. Reduced sensation in the pelvic area means women with SCI usually have less painful delivery; in fact, they may fail to realize when they go into labor. If there are deformities in the pelvis or spine caesarian section may be necessary. Babies of women with SCI {{are more likely to be}} born prematurely, and, premature or not, they are more likely to be small for their gestational time.|$|E

40|$|Background:- Wheat is {{believed}} to cause food allergy in {{children as well as}} in adults leading to severe <b>abdominal</b> <b>discomforts,</b> cramps, pains, indigestion, bloating and constipation. There are a few studies that address IgE mediated wheat allergy in people. Several papers have been published on various other methods of testing for food allergies but none on the actual elimination of food allergies. Objective:- We sought to determine the efficacy of NAET ® in permanently eliminating wheat allergy for a sample of patients. NAET ® is a natural treatment that utilizes standard medical diagnostic measures along with kinesiolgocal, chiropractic and oriental testing procedures to identify the allergens, as well as the intensity of reactions to the allergens which vary from individual to individual. Treatment consists of a sequence of spinal manipulations at specific thoracic and lumbar spinal levels along with acupuncture and/or acupressure on configurations of standard acupuncture points. Methods:- In a double blind study, 26 patients with diagnosed wheat allergy (13 males, 13 females, age range between 18 - 65 years) were randomly assigned to 2 groups: (1) NAET®/Experimental group, and (2) Control group. The study was conducted by 12 volunteer-clinicians, divided into six investigator groups. Each group conducted a designated sequential part of the study independently from all other groups, that is, was blinded from all other groups for the duration of th...|$|R
