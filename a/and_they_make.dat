5|$|The Moon crosses {{from south}} to {{north of the}} {{ecliptic}} at its ascending node, and vice versa at its descending node. However, the nodes of the Moon's orbit are gradually moving in a retrograde motion, due to {{the action of the}} Sun's gravity on the Moon's motion, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>make</b> a complete circuit every 18.6 years. This regression means that the time between each passage of the Moon through the ascending node is slightly shorter than the sidereal month. This period is called the nodical or draconic month.|$|E

A Tamil family from Munneswaram village controls the priestly position of the Kali temple. The Siva temple was renovated in 1875 by the personal efforts of Cumaraswamy Kurukal. Improvements were effected again in 1919 and 1963 through public support from Tamil Hindus from Colombo and Jaffna. The temple has become very popular amongst the Sinhalese <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>make</b> up over 78% of the pilgrims to both the Siva and Kali temples.|$|E

The phrase bellum se ipsum alet—the war feeds itself—was coined by Cato during this period. His proceedings in Hispania were not discrepant with the received idea of the fine old Roman soldier or with his own firm and over-assertive temper. He claimed to have destroyed more towns in Hispania than he had spent days in that country.|$|E

The third reason is that the dog is a good guard, and they guard the tenets of their philosophy. The fourth reason is that the dog is a discriminating animal which can distinguish between its friends and enemies. So do they recognize as friends those who are suited to philosophy, and receive them kindly, while those unfitted they drive away, like dogs, by barking at them.|$|E
