5|$|Aboriginal genetic {{studies suggest}} that the first {{inhabitants}} of the Americas share a single ancestral population, one that developed in isolation, conjectured to be Beringia. The isolation of these peoples in Beringia might have lasted 10,000–20,000 years. Around 16,500 years ago, the glaciers began melting, <b>allowing</b> <b>people</b> to move south and east into Canada and beyond.|$|E

50|$|A {{positive}} {{feature of}} the internet {{is that it has}} millions of different chat rooms and blogs that <b>allow</b> <b>people</b> to communicate with others who share their same interests and values. Not only does this enable people to find others who are similar to them, but it also <b>allows</b> <b>people</b> to find emotional support. However, there also a few negative consequences of the ability to connect with like-minded others online. One negative feature is that it <b>allows</b> <b>people</b> to come together and talk about subjects such as murder, and hate groups.|$|R
5|$|Clock shifts {{were found}} to {{increase}} the risk of heart attack by 10 percent, and to disrupt sleep and reduce its efficiency. Effects on seasonal adaptation of the circadian rhythm can be severe and last for weeks. A 2008 study found that although male suicide rates rise in the weeks after the spring transition, the relationship weakened greatly after adjusting for season. A 2008 Swedish study found that heart attacks were significantly more common the first three weekdays after the spring transition, and significantly less common the first weekday after the autumn transition. A 2013 review found little evidence that people slept more on the night after the fall DST shift, even though it is often described as <b>allowing</b> <b>people</b> to sleep for an hour longer than normal. The same review stated that the lost hour of sleep resulting from the spring shift appears to result in sleep loss for at least a week afterward. In 2015, two psychologists recommended that DST be abolished, citing its disruptive effects on sleep as one reason for this recommendation.|$|E
5|$|In 683, Emperor Gaozong died. He was {{succeeded by}} Emperor Zhongzong, his eldest {{surviving}} son by Wu. Zhongzong tried to appoint his wife's father as chancellor: after only six {{weeks on the}} throne, he was deposed by Empress Wu in favor of his younger brother, 12-year-old Emperor Ruizong. This provoked a group of Tang princes to rebel in 684; Wu's armies suppressed them within two months. She proclaimed the Tianshou era of Wu Zhou on October 16, 690, and three days later demoted Emperor Ruizong to crown prince. He was also forced {{to give up his}} father's surname Li in favor of the empress's Wu. She then ruled as China's only empress. A palace coup on February 20, 705, forced her to yield her position on February 22. The next day, her son Zhongzong was restored to power; the Tang was formally restored on March 3. She died soon after. To legitimize her rule, she circulated a document known as the Great Cloud Sutra, which predicted that a reincarnation of the Maitreya Buddha would be a female monarch who would dispel illness, worry, and disaster from the world. She even introduced numerous revised written characters to the written language, which reverted to the originals after her death. Arguably {{the most important part of}} her legacy was diminishing the power of the northwest aristocracy, <b>allowing</b> <b>people</b> from other clans and regions of China to become more represented in Chinese politics and government.|$|E
5|$|Luther lists several criticisms {{advanced}} by laypeople against indulgences in theses 81–91. He presents these as difficult objections his congregants are bringing {{rather than his}} own criticisms. How should he answer those who ask why the pope does not simply empty purgatory {{if it is in}} his power? What should he say to those who ask why anniversary masses for the dead, which were for the sake of those in purgatory, continued for those who had been redeemed by an indulgence? Luther claimed that it seemed strange to some that pious people in purgatory could be redeemed by living impious people. Luther also mentions the question of why the pope, who is very rich, requires money from poor believers to build St. Peter's Basilica. Luther claims that ignoring these questions risks <b>allowing</b> <b>people</b> to ridicule the pope. He appeals to the pope's financial interest, saying that if the preachers limited their preaching in accordance with Luther's positions on indulgences (which he claimed was also the pope's position), the objections would cease to be relevant. Luther closes the Theses by exhorting Christians to imitate Christ even if it brings pain and suffering. Enduring punishment and entering heaven is preferable to false security.|$|E
