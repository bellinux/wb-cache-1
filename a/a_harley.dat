500|$|... "The F Word" [...] makes {{prominent}} use of Harley-Davidson, {{the largest}} motorcycle manufacturing {{company in the}} United States. Also featured in the episode is Emmanuel Lewis, a former child actor who is portrayed as the head editor of the dictionary. This is a reference to Webster's Dictionary and Lewis' most famous role, the title character in the sitcom, Webster. During one scene, a television reporter repeatedly refers to <b>a</b> <b>Harley</b> biker as a [...] "fag" [...] until he attacks the camera. This is a reference to an on-air confrontation between NFL quarterback Jim Everett and sports talk show host Jim Rome, whom Everett attacked during a Talk2 interview.|$|E
500|$|The boys readily {{admit to}} the spray painting, {{and explain to}} the city council that the word [...] "fag" [...] is not {{intended}} as an insult to homosexuals, and is being used only in reference to a contemptible person who rides <b>a</b> <b>Harley</b> motorcycle, or [...] "an inconsiderate douchebag", as Stan puts it. They call upon the council to formally recognize this new usage. Support from the town, including the local gay community (who realize that the boys weren't intending to insult them, but in fact, the bikers), results in a town ordinance declaring {{a change in the}} word's definition. This action leads to negative publicity {{from the rest of the}} nation, and further angers the displaced bikers who refuse to be labeled as [...] "fags" [...] (one rider even assaulted a news reporter for calling him fag to his face three times). They look up the word in the dictionary and learn its definition has adapted over the years: it previously meant [...] "an unpleasant old woman" [...] and a bundle of sticks.|$|E
500|$|In October 1986, the British press {{reported}} that Mercury had his blood tested for HIV/AIDS at <b>a</b> <b>Harley</b> Street clinic. A reporter for The Sun, Hugh Whittow, questioned Mercury {{about the story}} at Heathrow Airport as he was returning {{from a trip to}} Japan. Mercury denied he had a sexually transmitted disease. According to his partner Jim Hutton, Mercury was diagnosed with AIDS in late April 1987. Around that time, Mercury claimed in an interview to have tested negative for HIV. Despite the denials, the British press pursued the rampant rumours over the next few years, fuelled by Mercury's increasingly gaunt appearance, Queen's absence from touring and reports from former lovers to various tabloid journals – by 1990 the rumours about Mercury's health were rife. At the 1990 Brit Awards held at the Dominion Theatre, London, [...] on 18 February, a visibly frail Mercury made his final appearance on stage when he joined the rest of Queen to collect the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. Towards the end of his life, he was routinely stalked by photographers, while The Sun featured a series of articles claiming that he was ill; notably in an article from November 1990 that featured an image of a haggard-looking Mercury on the front page accompanied by the headline, [...] "It's official – Freddie is seriously ill." ...|$|E

2500|$|The 1942 Roadmaster was longer, lower, wider, and roomier {{than before}} (<b>a</b> <b>Harley</b> Earl trademark), {{thanks in part}} to a longer wheelbase.
