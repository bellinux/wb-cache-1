2500|$|Several {{changes were}} made during 1924. [...] The Douglas engine was {{replaced}} with a 32hp (24kW) Bristol Cherub II flat twin. [...] This more powerful motor was also lighter, lacking the reduction gear of the Douglas and therefore mounted in the extreme nose with propeller and exposed cylinders at wing level. [...] At {{about the same time}} the empennage was modified with a squarer tailplane, taller, less rounded [...] fin and square tipped rudder. [...] The leaf spring undercarriage was replaced with a lighter split <b>axle</b> <b>unit</b> carrying smaller wheels and braced with conspicuous V-struts to the wing roots. There were also modifications {{to the top of the}} fuselage, including the installation of a side hinged cockpit cover with an opening just large enough to allow the pilot's head to protrude.|$|E
50|$|Rear Differential StructureThe vehicle's rear <b>axle</b> <b>unit</b> {{does not}} use a {{conventional}} differential. Instead, a hypoid ring-and-pinion gear set supported by a cast-aluminum housing switches torque from the propeller shaft's longitudinal orientation to the lateral orientation necessary to drive the rear wheels.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two types}} of Camalots, those with four lobes ({{original}} Camalots and modern C4 models) and those with three lobes (Camalot C3s). The original Camalots and the C4s utilize a patented dual-axle cam system, resulting in a slightly higher expansion range than for a similarly sized single <b>axle</b> <b>unit,</b> and also resulting in increased strength, allowing placement as a passive stopper. C4s range from the small #0.3, to the rarely seen massive #6.|$|E
50|$|The GE U26C diesel {{locomotive}} model {{was introduced by}} GE Transportation Systems in 1971. All examples of this model are six <b>axle</b> <b>units,</b> and have the wheel arrangement C-C (AAR classification) or Co'Co' (UIC classification).|$|R
50|$|C3s {{are single}} <b>axle</b> <b>units</b> {{designed}} for smaller, narrower placements, and {{range from a}} tiny #000 to #2. There is some overlap between the C4 #0.3 and the C3 1 and 2. As with most microcams, the C3 #000 is rated for aid climbing only.|$|R
50|$|The Chinese Ministry of Railways {{purchased}} 20 {{units of}} type DJ1 freight locomotives, {{in which the}} design is based on second generation of EuroSprinter platform, from a joint venture formed by Siemens and Zhuzhou Electric Locomotive Works in 1997. Each 8 axle 2(Bo'Bo') locomotive consists of two coupled single cab 4 <b>axle</b> <b>units.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{company was}} founded by William Peck, Edinburgh City Astronomer at the City Observatory, to develop the {{emerging}} technology of electricity. Madelvic produced an 'electric brougham' at their factory in Granton, north of Edinburgh, between 1898 and 1900. The vehicle was driven by a three-wheeled front <b>axle</b> <b>unit,</b> comprising motor, batteries and a small central wheel, set behind the axle, which propelled the car. This unit was mounted {{to the front of}} a chassis, creating a five-wheeled vehicle, but could also be attached to a horse-drawn carriage. Peck offered public transport using the car, between Granton and Leith as publicity. A more conventional front wheel drive electric vehicle was also briefly produced. However, electric cars were not to be the future, and Madelvic went bankrupt, being taken over by the Kingsburgh Motor Company in 1900.|$|E

50|$|The Goring was {{a single}} bay biplane with {{staggered}} wings of unequal span and slight sweep. They were based on spruce spars with internal wire bracing. The lower wing was angled downwards briefly as it left the fuselage, enabling a shorter-than-usual undercarriage. Short struts ran from the wing joint of this centre section to mid-fuselage. The fuselage was also a wooden structure of rectangular cross-section formed by ash longerons. Wings and fuselage were fabric covered. The pilot sat below the upper wing trailing edge with a cutout for visibility. The gunner sat behind in a second open cockpit fitted with a Scarff ring for a Vickers machine gun. The rear cockpit also allowed the gunner to assume a prone position for bombing. The tailplane was strut braced and the fin was low with a broad chord. Both rudder and elevators had horn balances which projected beyond the fixed surfaces. The standard undercarriage was a simple single axle arrangement, {{but it could be}} replaced with a split <b>axle</b> <b>unit</b> to allow the carrying and dropping of torpedoes. In addition the Goring could operate as a seaplane. The floats were accompanied by a rudder enlarged by an extension below the fuselage.|$|E
50|$|The 1950s and 1960s {{were good}} years for Euclid Trucks. Euclid {{produced}} the industry's first 50-ton, 3 axle dump truck, with twin Cummins power, in 1951. Euclid produced {{two and three}} axle dump trucks with capacities up to 105 tons, in this period. Some of the largest three <b>axle</b> <b>units,</b> being used as tractors for even larger end dumps, and bottom dump haulers.|$|R
50|$|In 1971, a first {{small series}} of modern eight-axle {{articulated}} trams manufactured by Dueweg came into use {{with a view}} to further expansion. They could also be operated single handed and transport exactly as many passengers as the mutli-staffed three-car or four <b>axle</b> <b>units</b> with two-axle side cars. The articulated trams were specially designed for Freiburg's narrow streets with a four-axle centre wagon and a saddle-mounted end car with a bogie.|$|R
50|$|The {{specification}} of the Victoria developed over time, but the simple design belied {{the high quality}} of workmanship. The coachwork was built by a leading Parisian coach-builder Alfred Belvallette, the front <b>axle</b> <b>units</b> were built by Darracq. In June 1899 it was offered with a 2.5 hp De Dion Bouton engine fitted with 'Longuemare automatic carburettor, and a four-speed gearbox made by Guyenet et Balvay to the patent design of J Didier.|$|R
50|$|The {{fuselage}} {{was flat}} sided, fabric covered over ash longerons with a rounded decking, deepest at the cockpit, from tail to nose. The tail surfaces were also fabric covered wooden structures. The fin was quite small and triangular, carrying a generous, semicircular unbalanced rudder on a hinge which {{leaned forward in}} flying attitude. The rudder continued down to the fuselage bottom, so the elevators, mounted with the tailplane {{on the top of}} fthe fuselage had a cut out in which it could move. The cockpit was fully upholstered, with a large luggage space behind that could alternatively have seated a child. The AL.1 was powered by a 95 hp (71 kW) seven cylinder Salmson AC.7 radial engine, mounted without a cowling and driving a two-bladed propeller. The undercarriage was a single <b>axle</b> <b>unit</b> with the main legs attached at the front spar roots. The legs were braced, unusually, by struts from the axle to the forward fuselage just behind the engine. The undercarriage legs splayed outwards to produce a large track. The wheels were wire braced, though in some images they are covered. There was a tailskid on the rear fuselage.|$|E
5000|$|The {{origin of}} the U25C {{grew out of the}} need for six axle {{locomotives}} to operate on a 12-mile heavy haul railroad to construct Oroville Dam. The General Electric salesman to Oro Dam Constructors offered essentially a U25B riding on six axle trucks. When the salesman got back to GE's Erie Plant it was discovered that no six axle U25 was available, nor did GE wish to construct a domestic six axle road switcher until the horsepower threshold reached 3000 horsepower. Rather than lose the four unit sale GE quickly began a design of a six axle U25 that relied heavily on the U25B for engineering. The U25C was longer than the U25B by four feet four inches. The extra length was needed to accommodate the improved Trimount trucks. Completed in September 1963 the U25C was the first six <b>axle</b> <b>unit</b> of the second generation of dieselization. Following quickly on the Oro Dam Constructor's order was an order by Atlantic Coast Line for four U25Cs. The ACL also ordered the first four Alco C628s. Both of these ACL orders were delivered in December 1963.|$|E
5000|$|With its new fuselage, the Scarab {{was longer}} than the DH.53, at 21 ft 0 in (6.40 m) {{compared}} with 19 ft 8 in (5.99 m). [...] Most of the extra length was in the nose, for the DH.53 was a very snub-nosed machine compared with the Scarab. Both aircraft had flat sided fuselages built up from four longerons in the usual manner of the time, with rounded decking. The DH.53 pilot had sat over mid-chord, but the combination of 5o of sweepback and the change of centre of gravity due to the longer nose in the Scarab meant he could sit at {{the trailing edge of}} the new, narrow chord centre section. Given the small gap between the top of the fuselage and the underside of the parasol wing, a mid chord cockpit would have been inaccessible and have restricted the pilot's view severely. A pair of lift stuts extended in a V from the lower fuselage longerons on each side to the two wing spars at the point where these were thickened for the compression struts of the DH.53. As on the DH.53, the wings had constant chord with slightly rounded tips, carrying long differential ailerons. In contrast to those of the DH.53, the wings of the Scarab folded for transport. The Scarab's undercarriage was also new, a split <b>axle</b> <b>unit</b> with the main legs going to the upper longerons and bracing to the lower ones. The undercarriage track was 5 ft (1.52 m). [...] Like some DH.53s, the Scarab was powered by a 32 hp (24 kW) Bristol Cherub III flat twin.|$|E
50|$|In the new Newmarket {{plant the}} body shell {{was removed from}} the wooden case of its export {{packaging}} which also held its matching chassis and pre-assembled engine, gearbox and back <b>axle</b> <b>units.</b> The body was painted and trimmed and seats and upholstery added, wiring completed then the whole reunited with the newly assembled chassis and its mechanicals. There were 54 office and works staff at the new factory and its output was expected to be 20 cars each week.|$|R

40|$|A portal <b>axle</b> <b>unit</b> is {{a gearbox}} unit {{installed}} on {{a vehicle for}} higher ground clearance and driving in off-road conditions. Shafts must be exceptionally tough and light to improve the overall performance of the portal <b>axle</b> <b>unit.</b> In this paper, a hollow shaft with a rib at both ends was proposed. The torsional stress of the three-dimensional shaft model was determined using finite element analysis (FEA) and validated by experimental testing. The hollow shaft thickness, rib thickness, depth of spokes, rib fillet radius, and number of spokes are the five of parameters considered in the torsional strength analysis of the rib. A Taguchi orthogonal array (L 25) was applied to determine the optimum set of parameters for the proposed shaft. The strength and weight of the optimized model were calculated and compared to the solid shaft, hollow shaft, and proposed model. The optimized model showed improvement in torsional strength with {{a slight increase in}} weight compared to the benchmark model...|$|E
40|$|In {{conjuction}} with ISSTA 2011 International audienceThis paper {{presents an}} effective end-to-end Model-Based Testing approach to validate automotive mechatronic systems. This solution takes as input a UML/OCL model describing the stimuli {{of the environment}} that can excite the mechatronic System Under Test. It applies model coverage criteria to automatically generate test cases, and finally takes an offline approach to translate the generated test cases into executable test scripts that can be executed both on simulation model and physical test bench. The mechatronic System Under Test is then tested against a Matlab/Simulink simulation model, which defines the test oracle. This tooled and automated approach has been successfully experimented on a concrete case study about the validation of a vehicle front <b>axle</b> <b>unit.</b> This experimentation enabled us to validate our approach, and showed its effectiveness in the validation process of mechatronic systems...|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} we present {{the results of a}} {{research}} project of Volkswagen AG and Fraunhofer IWU. It shows new approaches in the development of active mass dampers for transmission applications. The proposed active controlled system enables to reduce the interior sound pressure level of the rear axle gear mesh order by more than 5 dB. By detailed pre-examination of the drivetrain vibrations and transfer paths we gained new insights into the phenomenon of rear axle gear whine. In order to develop solutions to realise the damping of the vibrations we designed and constructed a test bench which consists of the main components of the rear <b>axle</b> <b>unit</b> and its bearings. The vibration phenomenon was replicated by synthetic excitation. Thus we could acquire an adequate control concept combined with a corresponding actuator and experimentally established control parameters. Validations on an experimental vehicle under synthetic excitation and finally under real driving conditions adduced the evidence for the functionality of the proposed system...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAs {{a result}} of {{successful}} initiatives in Australia, New Zealand and Canada, {{the introduction of a}} Smart Truck or performance-based standards (PBS) approach in the heavy vehicle sector in South Africa was identified by the CSIR as a research area warranting funding because of the potential benefits in terms of transport efficiency, road/vehicle safety and the protection of road infrastructure. The PBS approach involves setting standards to specify the performance required from the operation of a vehicle on a network rather than prescribing how the specified level of performance is to be achieved. A need was identified to design, manufacture and operate a number of PBS demonstration projects in South Africa in order to gain practical experience in the PBS approach and to quantify and evaluate potential benefits. The Smart Truck demonstration projects have been designed and manufactured to comply with the safety standards of the Australian PBS system. These include directional and non-directional manoeuvres such as acceleration capability, slow speed swept path, static rollover threshold and rearward amplification. In order to evaluate the impact of the PBS vehicles on pavements, the South African Mechanistic-Empirical Design and Analysis Methodology was used to calculate the road wear characteristics of various baseline and PBS vehicle combinations. In most cases, the PBS vehicles were found to be significantly more road-friendly per ton of payload than the corresponding baseline vehicles. Modifications for reducing road wear were identified such as load redistribution {{in order to reduce the}} load on the steering axle, replacing wide-based single tyres with dual tyres and, where appropriate, replacing a single steer axle with a twin steer <b>axle</b> <b>unit.</b> The paper describes the results of road wear analyses of five PBS vehicles and the corresponding baseline vehicles...|$|E
40|$|National audienceThe French agronomist Mathieu de Dombasle (1777 - 1843) {{became famous}} {{thanks to his}} {{research}} into a type of swing plough and new practices. Actually he has invented nothing but he used {{the principles of the}} 18 th century new agriculture. Nevertheless he is credited for the large spreading of his ideas and of his plough. He is really an innovator for the several means of diffusion he used. The aim of this article is the study of the inception of this innovation for tillage during the first mid 19 th century : - Dombasle's plough (without front <b>axle</b> <b>unit),</b> from its conception until its recognition by his peers in 1820 - 1821. Hereafter we stress Mathieu de Dombasle method, between empiricism and theory, analyzing how the farmers have changed their practices when they used this new plough without wheels. From the beginning of the 19 th century, theorising and putting these theories into practice in the field are the two main tasks for the agronomist, implemented by Mathieu de Dombasle though this was only the genesis of such a process. Not only was he a ploughs designer but he also elaborated new farmer's practices he largely spread. This is the setting up of an innovating agronomy. l'agronome lorrain Mathieu de Dombasle (1777 - 1843) est considéré comme un inventeur d'instruments aratoires perfectionnés, comme la charrue sans avant-train, et de pratiques nouvelles. En fait il n'a rien inventé au sens propre mais il a réinvesti l'héritage de l'agriculture nouvelle du XVIIIe siècle et s'est distingué par la manière dont il a diffusé ses idées et ses machines agricoles. Dans le présent article, nous nous proposons d'analyser la genèse d'une innovation de première importance en matière de travail du sol dans la première moitié du XIXe siècle : la conception de la charrue « Dombasle » jusqu'à la reconnaissance de Mathieu de Dombasle par ses pairs en 1820 - 1821. La démarche « dombaslienne », oscillant entre empirisme et théorie est expliquée, tandis que l'on met plus particulièrement l'accent sur les modifications des pratiques des agriculteurs qui utilisent le nouvel instrument aratoire...|$|E
