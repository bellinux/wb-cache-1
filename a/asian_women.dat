25|$|The fashion {{industry}} {{is known for}} not being inclusive of more races in their runways and ad campaigns, and several {{studies that have been}} conducted prove that the lack of racial diversity can contribute to body image issues amongst non-white minorities. In one such experiment, conducted in 2003, 3 photographs of attractive white, black and <b>Asian</b> <b>women</b> were shown to a group of white, black and Asian students. The study concluded that <b>Asian</b> <b>women</b> thought that the photograph of the white woman was the most attractive, and reported high levels of body dissatisfaction. Such dissatisfaction may even cause these individuals to suffer psychologically due to the pressure to embody these ideals, and may result in them going through several means to change their physical appearance in order to match the Eurocentric idea of beauty.|$|E

25|$|An anti pig {{slaughter}} edict led to {{speculation that}} the Zhengde Emperor adopted Islam due to his use of Muslim eunuchs who commissioned the production of porcelain with Persian and Arabic inscriptions in white and blue color. Muslim eunuchs contributed money in 1496 to repairing Niujie Mosque. Central <b>Asian</b> <b>women</b> were provided to the Zhengde Emperor by a Muslim guard and Sayyid Hussein from Hami. The guard was Yu Yung and the women were Uighur. It is unknown who really was behind the anti-pig slaughter edict. The speculation of him becoming a Muslim is remembered alongside his excessive and debauched behavior along with his concubines of foreign origin. Muslim Central Asian girls were favored by Zhengde like how Korean girls were favored by Xuande. A Uighur concubine was kept by Zhengde. Foreign origin Uighur and Mongol women were favored by the Zhengde emperor. Tatar (Mongol) and Central <b>Asian</b> <b>women</b> including Muslim Semu were bedded by Zhengde.

25|$|In the U.S., using median hourly {{earnings}} statistics (not controlling for job type differences), disparities in pay relative to white men are largest for Latina women (58% of white men's {{hourly earnings}}) and second-largest for Black women (65%), while white {{women have a}} pay gap of 82%.

25|$|In December 2005, Aaron Gillego, a {{columnist}} for The Advocate, criticized the series for having never cast an Asian man in the then-13 years of its existence, opining that <b>Asian</b> <b>women</b> have been cast on the show because heterosexual men have been socialized by the media {{to think of them}} as exotic beauties or sex objects, but that Asian men have been largely invisible in popular media. As of 2017, an Asian man has never been cast in the 25 years of the show's existence.|$|E
25|$|Women's lower {{salaries}} {{in the scientific}} community are also reflected in statistics. According to the data provided in 1993, the median salaries of female scientists and engineers with doctoral degrees were 20% less than men. This data can be explained as there was less participation of women in high rank scientific fields/positions and a female majority in low-paid fields/positions. However, even with {{men and women in the}} same scientific community field, women are typically paid 15–17% less than men. In addition to the gender gap, there were also salary differences between ethnicity: African-American women with more years of experiences earn 3.4% less than European-American women with similar skills, while <b>Asian</b> <b>women</b> engineers out-earn both Africans and Europeans.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the fact}} that HCC most {{commonly}} occurs in the setting of chronic liver disease (e.g. viral hepatitis) and cirrhosis (about 80%), screening by ultrasound (US) is commonly advocated in this population. Surveillance recommendations vary, but the American Association of Liver Diseases recommends screening Asian men over the age of 40, <b>Asian</b> <b>women</b> over the age of 50, people with HBV and cirrhosis, and African and North American blacks. These people are screened with ultrasound every 6 months. Additional evaluation may include measurement of blood levels of AFP, which is a tumor marker. Elevated levels of AFP are associated with active HCC disease. At levels >20 sensitivity is 41-65% and specificity is 80-94%. However, at levels >200 sensitivity is 31, specificity is 99%.|$|E
25|$|Some skin {{whitening}} products {{contain the}} toxic mercury(II) chloride as the active ingredient. When applied, the chemical readily absorbs {{through the skin}} into the bloodstream. The use of mercury in cosmetics is illegal in the United States. However, cosmetics containing mercury are often illegally imported. Following a certified case of mercury poisoning resulting {{from the use of}} an imported skin whitening product, the United States Food and Drug Administration warned against the use of such products. Symptoms of mercury poisoning have resulted from the use of various mercury-containing cosmetic products. The use of skin whitening products is especially popular amongst <b>Asian</b> <b>women.</b> In Hong Kong in 2002, two products were discovered to contain between 9,000 and 60,000 times the recommended dose.|$|E
25|$|The {{importance}} {{of how a}} woman perceives her behavior should not be underestimated. Many women perceived sex as a chore {{as opposed to a}} pleasurable experience, and they tend to consider themselves sexually inadequate, which in turn does not motivate them to engage in sexual activity. Several factors influence a women's perception of her sexual life. These can include: race, her gender, ethnicity, educational background, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, financial resources, culture, and religion. Cultural differences are also present in how women view menopause and its impact on health, self-image, and sexuality. A study has found that African American women are the most optimistic about menopausal life; Caucasian women are the most anxious, <b>Asian</b> <b>women</b> are the most inhibited about their symptoms, and Hispanic women are the most stoic.|$|E
