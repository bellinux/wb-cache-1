5|$|On September 3, 1895 {{the first}} wholly {{professional}} game was played, in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, between the Latrobe Athletic Association and the Jeannette Athletic Club. Latrobe won the contest 12–0. During this game, Latrobe's quarterback, John Brallier {{became the first}} player to openly <b>admit</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> paid to play football. He was paid $10 plus expenses to play. In 1897, the Latrobe Athletic Association paid all of its players for the whole season, becoming the first fully professional football team. In 1898, William Chase Temple took over the team payments for the Duquesne Country and Athletic Club, a professional football team based in Pittsburgh from 1895 until 1900, becoming the first known individual football club owner. Later that year, the Morgan Athletic Club, on the South Side of Chicago, was founded. This team later became the Chicago Cardinals, then the St. Louis Cardinals and now is known as the Arizona Cardinals, making them the oldest continuously operating professional football team.|$|E

25|$|The {{origins of}} My Own Private Idaho came from John Rechy's 1963 novel, City of Night, which {{featured}} characters who were street hustlers {{who did not}} <b>admit</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> gay. Van Sant's original screenplay {{was written in the}} 1970s, when he was living in Hollywood. After reading Rechy's book, Van Sant realized that it was considerably better than what he was writing, so he shelved the script for years. In 1988, while editing Mala Noche, Van Sant met a street kid named Michael Parker who became a source of inspiration for the character of Mike in what would later become My Own Private Idaho. Parker also had a friend named Scott, a street kid like himself. In the script, Van Sant adapted the Scott character to that of a rich kid. The character of Scott was also fashioned after people Van Sant had met in Portland who were street hustlers.|$|E

500|$|The 1990s are remembered, {{by many in}} the West, as a time of {{relative}} prosperity and satisfaction. [...] According to some historians, visionary politics appeared to be on the decline. [...] However, even after Satin entered New York University School of Law in 1992, he expressed no desire to abandon his project of helping to construct a post-liberal, post-Marxist ideology. [...] He did <b>admit</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> disillusioned with his approach. [...] "I knew my views (and I personally) would benefit from engagement with the real world of commerce and professional ambition", he wrote.|$|E
500|$|The role made Papps a {{favourite}} {{with the}} viewers, won him many fans {{and made him}} famous. The Seven Network received fan mail for Papps before the series even debuted. While interviewed in 1989, Papps explained {{that he would never}} <b>admit</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> the [...] "sex symbol" [...] that he was labelled as. He thought it was [...] "nice to be loved and accepted" [...] but the fame the role generated became an [...] "intrusion" [...] on his privacy. He told TVTimes Power that he could not relate to the perception of him and added [...] "I know who I am and I'm not the person hyped out there".|$|E
500|$|Wiseau {{has said}} that while casting the film, he {{selected}} his group of actors from among [...] "thousands" [...] of head shots, yet nearly the entire cast of The Room {{had never before been}} in a full-length film. For example, The Room was the first film in which Carolyn Minnott had ever appeared. Greg Sestero, who had known Wiseau for some time before production began, had limited film experience and had only agreed to work with Wiseau as part of the production crew. On the first day of filming, Wiseau fired the actor originally hired to play Mark, and Sestero agreed to fill in. He would later <b>admit</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> uncomfortable filming his sex scenes; because of this, he was allowed to keep his jeans on while shooting them.|$|E

500|$|Captured, Pechersky soon {{contracted}} typhus, but {{survived the}} seven-month-long illness. In May 1942, he escaped along {{with four other}} prisoners of war, {{but they were all}} recaptured the same day. He was then sent to a penal camp at Borisov, Belarus, and from there to a prisoners of war (POW) camp located in the forest next to the city of Minsk. During a mandatory medical examination it was discovered that he was circumcised. Pechersky recalled a German medical officer asking him: [...] "Do you <b>admit</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> a Jew?" [...] He admitted it, since any denial would result in a whipping, and was thrown into a cellar called [...] "the Jewish grave" [...] along with other Jewish POWs (prisoners of war), where for 10 days he sat in complete darkness, being fed 100grams (3.5oz) of wheat and a cup of water every second day.|$|E
500|$|For {{the rest}} of his {{lifetime}} Delius's more popular pieces were performed in England and abroad, often under the sponsorship of Beecham, who was primarily responsible for the Delius festival in October–November 1929. In a retrospective comment on the festival The Times critic wrote of full houses and an apparent enthusiasm for [...] "music which hitherto has enjoyed no exceptional vogue", but wondered whether this new acceptance was based on a solid foundation. After Delius's death Beecham continued to promote his works; a second festival was held in 1946, and a third (after Beecham's death) at Bradford in 1962, to celebrate the centenary of Delius's birth. These occasions were {{in the face of a}} general indifference to the music; writing in the centenary year, the musicologist Deryck Cooke opined that at that time, [...] "to declare oneself a confirmed Delian is hardly less self-defamatory than to <b>admit</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> an addict of cocaine and marihuana".|$|E
500|$|The album's artwork {{was created}} by English street artist D*Face. Barker was a fan of his work, having bought many of his pieces at his {{galleries}} in the past. According to D*Face, the trio [...] "wanted the artwork to represent California, but with a subversive side to show that it's not always great and there's always something under the surface, in the underbelly." [...] The artist was particularly busy, and employed pre-existing but unfinished illustration for the album cover. He also offered two alternate pieces that were rejected, but later posted on NME website. Skiba and Barker were pleased, but Hoppus was not as immediately receptive, according to the artist. While he did not <b>admit</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> {{a fan of the}} group, D*Face was happy with the commission, commenting, [...] "To have a band with such a great legacy and talent like Blink ask to work with you is a great honour and privilege." ...|$|E

500|$|Professor Cuthbert Calculus (Professeur Tryphon Tournesol in Hergé's {{original}} version; tournesol is the French {{word for}} sunflower) is an absent-minded and partially-deaf physicist {{and a regular}} character alongside Tintin, Snowy, and Captain Haddock. He was introduced in Red Rackham's Treasure, and based partially on , a Swiss physicist. The leading characters do not initially welcome his presence, but through his generous nature and his scientific ability, he develops a lasting bond with them. Eventually, {{by the end of}} Land of Black Gold, he becomes a resident of Marlinspike Hall. Normally mild-mannered and dignified, Calculus occasionally loses his temper and acts in a spectacularly aggressive manner in response to actual or perceived insults, such as when Captain Haddock belittles his work or accuses him of [...] "acting the goat". He is a fervent believer in dowsing, and carries a pendulum for that purpose. Calculus's deafness is a frequent source of humour, as he repeats back what he thinks he has heard, usually in the most unlikely words possible. He does not <b>admit</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> near-deaf and insists he is only [...] "a little hard of hearing in one ear." ...|$|E
500|$|Guerrilla Games began {{developing}} Horizon Zero Dawn in 2011, {{following the}} release of Killzone 3. When conceiving {{the idea for a}} new game, about 40 concepts were pitched. Among these was Horizon Zero Dawn, which game director Mathijs de Jonge considered [...] "the most risky" [...] of the concepts and was first pitched in 2010 by art director Jan-Bart van Beek. When this concept was chosen, a team of 10–20 began building prototypes of the game; many of the elements featured in the prototypes remained in the game throughout development. Approximately 20 different stories were written for the game, exploring varying concepts for the game, such as different player characters. John Gonzalez, who previously acted as lead writer for [...] (2010), was hired to write the game's story. The main elements of the story and the character of Aloy remained intact since early development. Upon the completion of Killzone Shadow Fall in late 2013, the remainder of the staff began working on Horizon Zero Dawn. Guerrilla also cancelled work on another title so as to allow the entire team to focus on the development of Horizon. Sony would later <b>admit</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> reluctant about having the main character be female and conducted focus testing to see if such a decision was marketable. It had an estimated budget of over €45 million.|$|E

Alan's daughter Gillian and Celia's daughter Caroline are complete opposites: widowed Gillian runs a farm and works part-time in a supermarket, whilst Oxford-educated Caroline is the headmistress of a successful school. Their parents' engagement affects both daughters' lives. Gillian wonders how she and her son will cope without her father around to help, whilst Caroline, struggling with depression and her feelings for a female colleague, feels that her mother's unconventional romance gives her [...] "permission to finally <b>admit</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> who she really is".|$|E
