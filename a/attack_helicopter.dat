5|$|But as American {{involvement}} in Vietnam was winding down, the Army canceled the Cheyenne program on 9 August 1972. By this time, the AH-1 Cobra was widely deployed by the Army during the Vietnam War and {{equipped with the}} TOW anti-tank missile. Controversy with the United States Air Force over the Cheyenne's role in combat {{as well as the}} political climate regarding military acquisition programs had caused the Army to amend the service's <b>attack</b> <b>helicopter</b> requirements in favor of a twin-engine conventional helicopter, viewed as less technical and more survivable. The Army announced a new program for an Advanced <b>Attack</b> <b>Helicopter</b> (AAH) on 17 August 1972, which {{led to the development of}} the AH-64 Apache.|$|E
5|$|The AH-64A is the {{original}} production <b>attack</b> <b>helicopter.</b> The crew sit in tandem in an armored compartment. It is powered by two GE T700 turboshaft engines. The A-model was equipped with the −701 engine version until 1990 when the engines were switched to the more powerful −701C version.|$|E
5|$|The Boeing–Sikorsky RAH-66 Comanche is an {{advanced}} five-blade armed reconnaissance and <b>attack</b> <b>helicopter</b> {{designed for the}} United States Army. Following decades of development, during 2004, the RAH-66 program was canceled prior to mass production commencing, by which point nearly US$7 billion had been already spent on the program.|$|E
50|$|In the air, <b>attack</b> <b>helicopters</b> {{armed with}} {{anti-tank}} missiles, {{and one or}} more unarmed, or lightly armed scout helicopters operate in concert. The scout helicopter, flying at low level in a nap-of-the-earth approach, attempts to both locate the enemy armoured columns and to map out approaches and ambush positions for the <b>attack</b> <b>helicopters.</b> Late-model scout helicopters include laser designators to guide missiles fired from the <b>attack</b> <b>helicopters.</b> After finding a target, the scout helicopter can locate it and then direct the <b>attack</b> <b>helicopter's</b> missile where to fire. The <b>attack</b> <b>helicopters</b> have only to rise from cover briefly to fire their missiles before returning to a concealed location. Late-development of <b>attack</b> <b>helicopters,</b> such as the Mil Mi-28N, the Kamov Ka-52, and the AH-64D Longbow, incorporate sensors and command and control systems to relieve the requirement for scout helicopters.|$|R
5000|$|In 2011, Saudi Arabia asked Turkey {{to enter}} a tender to produce <b>attack</b> <b>helicopters</b> for the Saudi Air Force. [...] In July 2012, it was {{reported}} that the Philippines received an offer from Italy for AgustaWestland <b>attack</b> <b>helicopters</b> (either A129 or T129).|$|R
50|$|<b>Attack</b> <b>{{helicopters}}</b> are helicopters {{used in the}} anti-tank {{and close}} air support roles. The first of the modern <b>attack</b> <b>helicopters</b> was the Vietnam era AH-1 Cobra, which pioneered the now classic format of pilot and weapons officer seated in tandem in a narrow fuselage, chin mounted guns, and rockets and missiles mounted on stub wings. To enable them to find and identify their targets, some modern <b>attack</b> <b>helicopters</b> are equipped with very capable sensors such as a millimeter wave radar system.|$|R
5|$|The Army {{announced}} Lockheed and Sikorsky as {{winners of}} Project Definition Phase contracts on 19 February 1965. Meanwhile, the Army also continued {{to pursue an}} interim aircraft for combat in Vietnam until the AAFSS could be fielded, resulting in development of the Bell AH-1 Cobra which would become {{the backbone of the}} Army's <b>attack</b> <b>helicopter</b> fleet during and after the Vietnam War.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, {{he participated}} in Operation Mount Hope III, during which U.S. forces {{recovered}} a crashed Soviet-made Mi-24 Hind <b>attack</b> <b>helicopter</b> in Chad. Company E of the 160th deployed to N'Djamena, Chad via C-5 Galaxy. Once in Chad the company flew two CH-47 Chinooks 490 nautical miles at night, {{without the use of}} navigational aids, to the crash site. Once at the crash site the crews harnessed the crashed Hind to a Chinook via sling-load. During the returning flight both Chinooks performed an air-to-air refuel with a C-130; and later endured a sandstorm before returning with the Hind.|$|E
5|$|In March 1994, the Spanish Ministry of Defense created Programa Coraza 2000 (Program Breastplate 2000), {{which focused}} on the {{procurement}} and integration of new armament for the Spanish army's modernization. The program included the Leopard2E and the Pizarro infantry combat vehicle, {{as well as the}} Eurocopter Tiger <b>attack</b> <b>helicopter.</b> The program's scope extended to the integration of 108 Leopard2A4s, which were leased to Spain in late 1995. Apart from procurement, Programa Coraza was meant to prepare the Spanish army logistically for the introduction of new matériel.|$|E

5|$|Pilotwings is {{an amateur}} flight {{simulator}} {{game in which}} the player attempts to earn pilot licenses through lessons in light plane flight, hang gliding, skydiving, {{and the use of}} a rocket belt. Bonus stages and levels involving an <b>attack</b> <b>helicopter</b> are also available. Each event offers unique controls and gameplay mechanics. To increase the realism of the game's flight simulation, the developers extensively utilized the SNES Mode 7 capability, which mimics 3D graphics by rotating and scaling flat objects.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Army is {{the primary}} {{operator}} of the AH-64; it has also become the primary <b>attack</b> <b>helicopter</b> of multiple nations, including Greece, Japan, Israel, the Netherlands, Singapore, and the United Arab Emirates; {{as well as being}} produced under license in the United Kingdom as the AgustaWestland Apache. American AH-64s have served in conflicts in Panama, the Persian Gulf, Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq. Israel used the Apache in its military conflicts in Lebanon and the Gaza Strip; British and Dutch Apaches have seen deployments in wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.|$|E
5|$|The UK {{currently}} {{operates a}} modified version of the Apache Longbow; initially called the Westland WAH-64 Apache, it is designated the Apache AH1 by the British Army. Westland built 67 WAH-64 Apaches under license from Boeing, following a competition between the Eurocopter Tiger and the Apache for the British Army's new <b>Attack</b> <b>Helicopter</b> in 1995. Important deviations made by AgustaWestland from the U.S. Apache variants include changing to more powerful Rolls-Royce engines, and the addition of a folding blade assembly for use on naval ships.|$|E
50|$|On 14 June, NATO <b>attack</b> <b>helicopters</b> were {{deployed}} and subsequently destroyed two rigid-hull inflatable boats being operated by pro-Gaddafi forces threatening maritime {{traffic in the}} area.

5|$|The {{requirement}} {{for a new}} <b>attack</b> <b>helicopter</b> was identified by the British government in the early 1990s. In 1993, invitations to bid were issued. Bids received included the Eurocopter Tiger, a modernised Bell AH-1 SuperCobra, the AH-64 Apache, the Boeing/Sikorsky RAH-66 Comanche, and the Agusta A129 Mangusta. Both the Tiger and Cobra variant were derided for requiring development, and thus risk, while the Apache was combat proven, however its performance in the First Gulf War was criticised by competitors. Westland and the Apache was selected in July 1995, a contract for 67 helicopters was signed in 1996.|$|E
5|$|As intended, {{it would}} have functioned as a stealth helicopter, {{incorporating}} {{a number of different}} techniques and technologies in order to reduce its radar cross-section (RCS) along with other areas of visibility and detectability. The exterior surfaces of the RAH-66 were faceted and covered with both radar-absorbent material (RAM) coatings and infrared-suppressant paint; {{as a result of these}} combined measures, the Comanche's RCS was claimed to have been 360 times smaller than that of the AH-64 Apache <b>attack</b> <b>helicopter.</b> The acoustic signature of the rotorcraft was also reported to be noticeably lower than comparative helicopters; this reduction had been partially achieved through the adoption of an all-composite five-blade main rotor and pioneering canted tail rotor assembly.|$|E
5|$|During this period, the United States Army {{had been}} {{introducing}} the UH-1 Iroquois into service. First used in its intended {{role as a}} transport, it was soon modified {{in the field to}} carry more machine guns in {{what became known as the}} helicopter gunship role. This proved effective against the lightly armed enemy, and new gun and rocket pods were added. Soon the AH-1 Cobra was introduced. This was an <b>attack</b> <b>helicopter</b> armed with long-range BGM-71 TOW missiles able to destroy tanks from outside the range of defensive fire. The helicopter was effective, and prompted the U.S. military to change its defensive strategy in Europe by blunting any Warsaw Pact advance with anti-tank helicopters instead of the tactical nuclear weapons that had been the basis for NATO's battle plans since the 1950s.|$|E

5|$|On September 12, 1995, three gas {{balloons}} {{participating in}} the race entered Belarusian air space. Despite the fact that competition organizers had informed the Belarusian Government about the race in May and that flight plans had been filed, a Mil Mi-24B <b>attack</b> <b>helicopter</b> of the Belarusian Air Force shot down one balloon, killing two American citizens, Alan Fraenckel and John Stuart-Jervis. Another of the balloons was forced to land while the third landed safely over two hours after the initial downing. The crews of the two balloons were fined for entering Belarus without a visa and released. Belarus has neither apologized nor offered compensation for the deaths.|$|E
5|$|The Apache {{originally}} {{started as}} the Model 77 developed by Hughes Helicopters for the United States Army's Advanced <b>Attack</b> <b>Helicopter</b> program {{to replace the}} AH-1 Cobra. The prototype YAH-64 was first flown on 30 September 1975. The U.S. Army selected the YAH-64 over the Bell YAH-63 in 1976, and later approved full production in 1982. After purchasing Hughes Helicopters in 1984, McDonnell Douglas continued AH-64 production and development. The helicopter was introduced to U.S. Army service in April 1986. The first production AH-64D Apache Longbow, an upgraded Apache variant, was delivered to the Army in March 1997. Production has been continued by Boeing Defense, Space & Security; over 2,000 AH-64s have been produced to date.|$|E

5|$|On 7 August, two VRS {{air force}} jets {{attacked}} {{a village in}} the Nova Gradiška area, {{just north of the}} Sava Riverthe international border in the area. The CAF bombed an ARSK command post, a storage facility and several tanks near Bosanski Petrovac. CAF jets also struck a column of Serb refugees near Bosanski Petrovac, killing nine people, including four children. On 8 August, the CAF performed its last combat sorties in the operation, striking tanks and armoured vehicles between Bosanski Novi and Prijedor, and two of its MiG-21s were damaged. The same day, UN military observers deployed at Croatian airfields claimed that the CAF attacked military targets and civilians in the Dvor area, where refugee columns were mixed with ARSK transporting heavy weapons and large quantities of ammunition. Overall, the CAF performed 67 close air support, three <b>attack</b> <b>helicopter,</b> seven reconnaissance, four combat air patrol and 111 transport helicopter sorties during Operation Storm.|$|E
5|$|The Army also {{conducted}} a weapons demonstration for the Senate Armed Services Committee in early 1972, {{to show off}} the Cheyenne's firepower and garner support for <b>attack</b> <b>helicopter</b> development. The first TOW missile that was fired in the demonstration failed and went into the ground. The second missile was fired and hit the target. Previously, 130 TOW missiles had been fired without failure, but the failure of the first missile was now linked to perception of the aircraft. In April 1972, the Senate published its report on CAS. The report recommended funding of the Air Force's A-X program, which would become the A-10 Thunderbolt II, and limited procurement of the Harrier for the Marine Corps. The report never referred to the Cheyenne by name and only offered a lukewarm recommendation for the Army to continue procurement of attack helicopters, so long as their survivability could be improved.|$|E
5|$|While {{travelling}} {{by train}} to Stromberg's base in Sardinia, Bond saves Amasova from Jaws, and their cooling rivalry turns to affection. Posing as a marine biologist and his wife, they visit Stromberg's base and discover {{that he had}} launched a mysterious new supertanker, the Liparus, nine months previously. As they leave the base, an unknown henchman on a motorcycle featuring a rocket sidecar, Jaws in a car, and Naomi, an assistant/pilot of Stromberg in an <b>attack</b> <b>helicopter,</b> chase them, but Bond and Amasova escape underwater when his car – a Lotus Esprit from Q Branch – converts into a submarine. Jaws survives a car crash and Naomi is killed when Bond fires a sea-air missile from his car which destroys her helicopter. The pair also encounter a fleet of Stromberg's minisubs which Amasova obliterates by launching mines. Bond finds out that the Liparus has never visited any known port or harbor. Amasova discovers that Bond killed her lover (as shown {{at the beginning of}} the movie), and she vows to kill Bond as soon as their mission is complete.|$|E
