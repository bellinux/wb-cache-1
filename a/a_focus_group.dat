5|$|Daniels and Schur {{first started}} writing the script {{in the summer}} of 2008, when they were {{in the early stages of}} conceiving the series. Like the rest of the series, the pilot was filmed in the same mockumentary style as The Office, the NBC comedy series also {{directed}} by Daniels. About one month before the pilot aired, <b>a</b> <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> report discussing several perceived problems with the episode was leaked to the media, which led to speculation that Parks and Recreation was not ready for prime-time television. The pilot episode featured a number of cultural references to such people as Bob Knight, Larry Bird and Laura Linney, as well as female political figures to whom Leslie compares herself, such as Hillary Clinton, Sarah Palin, and Nancy Pelosi.|$|E
5|$|Before a {{translation}} is greenlit and translators are allocated for each language, the localization, quality assurance (QA) and marketing staff play through a build {{of the game}} and sometimes do <b>a</b> <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> study. The localization team's playthrough can sometimes take over 100 hours of gameplay. Once the company greenlights a localization project, a period of brainstorming starts in which glossary, style, naming schemes and fonts are chosen. During the translation phase, voiced sections are translated first. Text files are cross-checked by multiple translators and editors. The text is then integrated along with any graphic and sound changes, and the game goes to quality assurance. During a period of several weeks to up to three months, Japanese QA teams look for bugs while Western QA teams check linguistic issues. The localization team often re-plays the game during this phase, translates the manuals and help out on the guidebooks if these are made. Finally, the game is sent to the hardware manufacturers to be approved.|$|E
25|$|Some of the {{features}} of focus group discussions include, member’s involvement, a number of consecutive meetings, the common characteristics of members with respect to interests, the evolvement of qualitative data, and discussion within the group that is focused on a topic, that is determined by the purposes of the research(Freitas, 1998). In other words, <b>a</b> <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> is an informal discussion among a group of selected individuals about a particular topic (Wilkinson 2004). <b>A</b> <b>focus</b> <b>group,</b> as a research method, involves more than one participant per data collection session.|$|E

25|$|Budget cuts caused Phelps to {{institute}} a serial killer storyline. Phelps decided to kill off one major character and it was originally decided that popular character, Donna Hudson, was to be offed, but massive fan protest caused Phelps to scrap that plan. Phelps then decided to kill off either Frankie Frame or Paulina Carlino. When <b>a</b> <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> responded lukewarm to Frankie but warmer to Paulina, Phelps gave the greenlight to axe Frankie. When word got out about Frankie's exit, another massive rampage of fan protests arose. Phelps quickly asked then-head writer Margaret DePriest to re-write Frankie's exit so that the character would at least still live. DePriest, eager to satisfy her wish to see Frankie's husband, Cass, return to his former rogue ways, vehemently refused. Frankie was murdered in what many people felt were overly brutal and gruesome scenes.|$|E

The group members harshly criticize this latest movie, {{and in the midst}} of trying to find the flaw in it, the three friends discover that the first movie they ever made together — in which they are a biker gang contemplating whether or not to fight an unknown adversary — is missing an ending. The three cannot agree on a conclusion for the movie, so they decide that each of them will create their own, and then screen the three potential endings in front of the focus group. All of their endings, however, are harshly criticized. The three sit down and watch a reel composed of scenes from several of their film projects; they come to the consensus that their movies are designed only for them and should not actually be seen by anyone else.|$|E

Krusty orders the cartoon's producer, Roger Meyers, {{to find a way}} to fix the sagging ratings, or else a Chinese cartoon will replace Itchy and Scratchy. Meyers decides to commission <b>a</b> <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> to discover why Itchy and Scratchy has lost its popularity. Bart and Lisa participate in the study, by watching cartoons and answering the questions. However, things do not go well, with the children contradicting themselves when explaining what they want. Eventually, Lisa tells the executives that there is nothing wrong with the show and that it is as good as it has ever been—but after being on TV for so long, the show does not have as much an impact on audiences as it did in its early years. Meyers thanks Lisa for [...] "saving" [...] Itchy and Scratchy, and decides that his cartoon's salvation lies in a new character. He tells Krusty and his team of writers that this new character should be a dog with [...] "attitude", who will be called Poochie.|$|E
500|$|Some of the reviewers {{criticized the}} lyrics. Dele Fadele of the NME called it [...] "the poppermost pop single ever invented", {{adding that it}} {{contained}} [...] "a brilliant line in nonsense lyrics. As such it is the Spice Girls' message of peace to the world". The Reading Eagle reviewer, David Bauder, said that it [...] "sounds like {{it was written by}} <b>a</b> <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> who told them to add a Latin flavor". The Telegram & Gazette commented that its lyrics were [...] "concerned more with shaking hips than moving social consciousness". Larry Flick of Billboard magazine was mixed on the track. Although he described it as [...] "insanely catchy and devilishly fun", he also felt {{that it was not a}} real song, saying that it is [...] "just a festive cha-cha groove and a lyrical command to add some 'spice' to your life by way of countless dance moves. A runaway hit." [...] The Hartford Courant music critic Roger Catlin, believed that the song [...] "recognizes and embraces the group's worldwide audience with savvy Latin rhythms and a self-promoting lyric of dizzy Esperanto". Chicago Sun-Times critic Jim DeRogatis was unimpressed with the lyrics, yet when comparing it to Aqua's [...] "Barbie Girl", he found that its [...] "unifying sentiment is more admirable".|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the main}} {{purposes}} of focus group discussion is to get light into the respondents’ phenomenological world of experience, thinking, perceiving and feeling. These experiences, feelings, attitudes might be independent of a group or its cultural and social settings but {{are more likely to}} reveal itself in the interaction with other people in a group or another social setting. Focus group discussions help in elaborating the different viewpoints and emotional processes of each member within a group context. The individual interview is simpler for the researcher to control in comparison to <b>a</b> <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> discussion. <b>A</b> <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> discussion, in comparison to other methods helps the research to gain larger pool information in a much lesser amount of time. This observation depends on waiting for things to happen, whereas the researcher has to follow an interview guide in <b>a</b> <b>focus</b> <b>group.</b> In this aspect, focus group discussions are not natural but organized and planned. These discussions are especially helpful when there are differences related to power between its members, decision-makers or professionals, [...] when the culture and language of a specific group is of, and when the researcher or a member wants to understand and explore the level of consensus over a given theme or topic(Kreuger, 1993).|$|E
