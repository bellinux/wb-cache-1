5|$|It was {{originally}} {{built for the}} Adobe Flash platform in 2010 as indie game artist Wohlwend's first self-developed game. The game idea came from staring <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> <b>and</b> Wohlwend applied a grayscale color palette from {{his first year in}} art school. When Flash game sites did not purchase the title, he open sourced the code. Eric Johnson of Semi Secret ported the game to iPad, which began a collaboration between Wohlwend and the company's Adam Saltsman, who became the primary puzzle designer.|$|E

2500|$|Lolita Lebrón was {{the leader}} of a group of nationalists who {{attacked}} the United States House of Representatives in 1954. [...] Lebrón's mission was to bring world attention to Puerto Rico's independence cause. When Lebrón's group reached the visitor's gallery above the chamber in the House, she stood up and shouted [...] "¡Viva Puerto Rico Libre!"

A legend claims that Lebrón fired her shots <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>and</b> missed.

2500|$|The two then fled to {{a nearby}} Walmart, where Jerad fired a shot <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>and</b> ordered shoppers to leave. Joseph Wilcox, who was {{carrying}} a concealed weapon, drew his weapon and confronted Jerad, but passed Amanda as he did so, not realizing that she was armed and Jerad's accomplice; Amanda shot and killed Wilcox. Police later responded to 9-1-1 calls and arrived at the Walmart, engaging the Millers in a gunfight, during which Amanda was wounded. The Millers moved {{toward the back of}} the store, where they tried to protect themselves from gunfire using several items from the store as a barricade. Police eventually shot and killed Jerad, while Amanda shot and critically wounded herself in the head. She was taken to the University Medical Center of Southern Nevada, where she died. Initial reports inaccurately indicated that Amanda shot Jerad repeatedly in the chest after he had [...] "laid down" [...] in front of her, killing him, before committing suicide.|$|E

3000|$|Thus, some {{methods of}} modifying the models with Hicksian {{nonlinearities}} {{have been proposed}} to interpret the ‘ceilings’ and the ‘floors’ more reasonably (see [10 – 12]). One kind of these methods is to regularize such a model by smoothing out <b>the</b> corners <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceilings</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> floors without substantially modifying the assumptions of the model, but including some realistic situations. The regularization method was introduced by Saura et al. (1998) [12]. In [12], a piecewise linear economic model is perturbed {{in the way of}} regularization and its non-chaotic dynamic property is proved to be persistent against smoothing, which shows that this model is non-chaotic in nature. How {{about the nature of the}} dynamics of the economy stated above? Do the chaotic behaviors of the model (M_ 0) survive smoothing? [...]...|$|R

50|$|Situated in {{the center}} of the park and {{overlooking}} the Bosphorus, the two-storey mansion with one balcony, one terrace and a basement is constructed on an area of 400 m2. It consists of four rooms, one hall and a kitchen in the lower floor and three rooms and one salon in the upper floor. Its layout reflects the architecture of the traditional Ottoman house with a salon encircled by many living rooms. <b>The</b> ornaments <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceilings</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> walls were the work of the court architect Sarkis Balyan. <b>The</b> <b>ceilings</b> are enriched with oil painted flower figures and the facades with outstanding carvings. The high doors and windows, as well as the opulent interior decorations in bright colors reflect the glory of that era. A pond is situated to the northeast, next to the mansion.|$|R
