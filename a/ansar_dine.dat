25|$|In Mali, the <b>Ansar</b> <b>Dine</b> faction {{was also}} {{reported}} {{as an ally}} of al-Qaeda in 2013. The Ansar al Dine faction aligned themselves with the AQIM.|$|E
25|$|The Battles of Gao and Timbuktu {{was fought}} between the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA) and the Islamist Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa (MOJWA), {{along with its}} ally <b>Ansar</b> <b>Dine,</b> {{that took place in}} Gao between 26–27 June 2012. {{followed}} the next day, with more fighting. By 28 June 2012, Gao, Timbuktu and Kidal, the three biggest cities in the disputed secessionist region of Azawad within what is recognised as Malian territory, were under the control of <b>Ansar</b> <b>Dine</b> and its Islamist allies.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ansar</b> <b>Dine</b> is an Islamist {{militant group}} {{in the country of}} Mali that wants Shariah law in Mali. It opposes Sufi shrines. Its main support comes from the Ifora tribe of Tuaregs. The group is {{connected}} to Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ansar</b> <b>Dine's</b> Chief of Security for Gao, Omar Ould Hamaha, {{said that}} the group {{controls}} the region and would impose sharia.|$|R
2500|$|Timbuktu Deputy Mayor Sandy Haidara said of {{the actions}} that [...] "it {{looks as if it}} is a direct {{reaction}} to the UNESCO decision." [...] <b>Ansar</b> <b>Dine's</b> spokesman Sanda Ould Boumama then said that the group [...] "will today destroy every mausoleum in the city. All of them, without exception. God is unique. All of this is haram. We are all Muslims. UNESCO is what?" [...] in the name of God." [...] UNESCO's Executive Committee Chair Alissandra Cummins said that [...] "this is tragic news for us all. I appeal to all those engaged in the conflict in Timbuktu to exercise their responsibility." ...|$|R
2500|$|Despite earlier {{claims that}} they had stopped taking down the tombs, on 1 July about 30 {{members of the group}} were {{reported}} to have continued taking down four more sites with hoes and chisels at the cemetery of Djinguereber Mosque, including that of Cheikh el-Kebir, Sidi Elmety, Mahamane Elmety and Sidi Mahmoudou by late afternoon. <b>Ansar</b> <b>Dine's</b> Omar Ould Hamaha said that [...] "the only tribunal we recognise is the divine court of shariah. The destruction is a divine order. It's our prophet who said that each time that someone builds something on top of a grave, it needs to be pulled back to the ground. We need to do this so that future generations don't get confused, and start venerating the saints as if they are God...We are against tourism. They foster debauchery." ...|$|R
25|$|The next day, <b>Ansar</b> <b>Dine</b> was {{reported}} to have taken control of Timbuktu after MNLA fighters followed their deadline to leave town. Residents confirmed the MNLA was no longer present, as the Islamist movements confirmed their control over the entire northern Malian region of Azawad.|$|E
25|$|During {{a session}} in June 2009, UNESCO decided to cease its {{increased}} monitoring program as it felt sufficient progress {{had been made}} to address the initial concerns. Following the takeover of Timbuktu by MNLA and the Islamist group <b>Ansar</b> <b>Dine,</b> it was returned to the List of World Heritage in Danger in 2012.|$|E
25|$|Following {{previous}} Tuareg rebellions in 2007–2009 and the Libyan Civil War, {{in early}} 2012 the MNLA and Islamist movements captured northern Mali. Tensions then started between the MNLA and Islamist movements {{over the use}} of sharia law within the territory. Clashes started to erupt between both sides after a merge attempt failed, despite the signing of an accord to share power. On 25 June, the Islamist <b>Ansar</b> <b>Dine</b> took control of Kidal.|$|E
50|$|On February 23, French {{air strike}} {{took place in}} the area of Sensa, {{destroying}} six jihadists vehicles. According to the MNLA and the citizens of the town of Kidal, 45 fighters from AQIM and <b>Dine</b> <b>Ansar</b> were killed during a French raid. By supporting the French special forces, the MNLA also allegedly took seven prisoners and among the survivors, including the head of AQIM, Seden Ag Hita.|$|R
5000|$|In a February 2013 article {{published}} on the website of the Brookings Institution, Riedel discussed [...] "false flag ops" [...] in relation to Algerian counter-terrorism units. In his article [...] "Algeria a Complex Ally in War Against al Qaeda", he described the Algerian counter-terrorism unit DRS and its methods:“(The) DRS is (…) known for its tactic of infiltrating terrorist groups, creating “false flag” terrorists and trying to control them.”, Riedel writes. “Rumors have associated the DRS in the past with the Malian warlord Iyad Ag Ghali, head of <b>Ansar</b> al <b>Dine</b> AQIM’s ally in Mali, and even with Mukhtar Belmukhtar, the al-Qaeda terrorist who engineered {{the attack on the}} natural gas plant.” ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Ansar</b> el <b>Dine</b> also {{blocked a}} {{humanitarian}} convoy bringing medical and food aid from reaching Timbuktu on 15 May, objecting {{to the presence}} of women in the welcoming committee set up by city residents; after negotiations, the convoy was released on the following day. The group reportedly banned video games, Malian and Western music, bars, and football in Gao and ransacked alcohol-serving establishments in both Gao and Kidal. Islamist forces were also reported to have intervened against looters and ordered women to wear head scarves. The CNRDR's spokesman Amadou Konare claimed that [...] "women and girls have been kidnapped and raped by the new occupants who are laying down their own law." [...] The anti-slavery organization Temedt claims that ex-slaves were the first targeted for punishment by Islamist forces and that former masters have used the violence to recapture ex-slaves.|$|R
25|$|France retains strong {{political}} and economic influence in its former African colonies (Françafrique) and has supplied economic aid and troops for peace-keeping missions in Ivory Coast and Chad. Recently, after the unilateral declaration of independence of northern Mali by the Tuareg MNLA and the subsequent regional Northern Mali conflict with several Islamist groups including <b>Ansar</b> <b>Dine</b> and MOJWA, France and other African states intervened to help the Malian Army to retake control.|$|E
25|$|Our fighters {{control the}} perimeter. We control Timbuktu completely. We control Gao completely. It's <b>Ansar</b> <b>Dine</b> that {{commands}} {{the north of}} Mali. Now we have every opportunity to apply sharia. Sharia {{does not require a}} majority vote. It's not democracy. It's the divine law that was set out by God to be followed by his slaves. One hundred percent of the north of Mali is Muslim, and even if they don't want this, they need to go along with it.|$|E
25|$|Qatar Charity’s {{track record}} of terror {{financing}} includes support to members of al-Qaeda in Chechnya, an accusation publicly denied by Hamad bin Nasser al-Thani. In 1999 Qatar Charity supposedly funneled money to Chechnya-based al-Qaeda affiliates. Furthermore, Qatar Charity is among the NGOs allegedly channelling funds to <b>Ansar</b> <b>Dine</b> in North Mali, a piece of information confirmed by French military intelligence reports dating back to France’s intervention {{in the country in}} early 2013. The group has long been suspected of having ties to al-Qaeda.|$|E
25|$|The Wall Street Journal, {{among other}} media outlets, has drawn a {{connection}} between the secular MNLA's vision for a democratic Azawad to the Arab Spring revolts, though as with many of the uprisings in the Middle East, Islamist factions have contested this view of Azawad's future. <b>Ansar</b> <b>Dine</b> has called for sharia law throughout all of Mali, not just Azawad. The Azawadi declaration of independence has also faced significant pushback from the international community, with no state or international body recognising the de facto state and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) mulling options for an international military intervention against the rebels.|$|E
25|$|In January 2012 a Tuareg {{rebellion}} {{began in}} Northern Mali, {{led by the}} National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad. In March, military officer Amadou Sanogo seized power in a coup d'état, citing Touré's failures in quelling the rebellion, and leading to sanctions and an embargo by the Economic Community of West African States. The MNLA quickly {{took control of the}} north, declaring independence as Azawad. However, Islamist groups including <b>Ansar</b> <b>Dine</b> and Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), who had helped the MNLA defeat the government, turned on the Tuareg and took control of the North with the goal of implementing sharia in Mali.|$|E
25|$|A Tuareg {{rebellion}} in early 2012 that forced {{the armed forces}} of Mali, a West African country with significant holdings in the Sahara, to withdraw south of the line the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA) claimed as the Tuareg homeland's southwestern frontier by April. The conflict was exacerbated by a coup d'état by the military that forced President Amadou Toumani Toure from power and briefly installed a junta in Bamako, the capital. With government forces pushed to Mopti and southward by the MNLA and other armed groups, including <b>Ansar</b> <b>Dine</b> and the Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa, the MNLA's secretary general, Bilal Ag Acherif, declared Azawad an independent state on 6 April 2012.|$|E
2500|$|Gao, a {{northern}} regional capital, {{was taken by}} the MNLA and <b>Ansar</b> <b>Dine.</b> BBC News described the loss as [...] "a serious blow to the coup leaders".|$|E
2500|$|In May 2012, <b>Ansar</b> <b>Dine</b> {{destroyed}} a shrine {{in the city}} and in June 2012, {{in the aftermath of the}} Battle of Gao and Timbuktu, other shrines, including the mausoleum of Sidi Mahmoud, were destroyed when attacked with shovels and pickaxes by members of the same group. An <b>Ansar</b> <b>Dine</b> spokesman said that all shrines in the city, including the 13 remaining World Heritage sites, would be destroyed because they consider them to be examples of idolatry, a sin in Islam. [...] These acts have been described as crimes against humanity and war crimes.|$|E
2500|$|The Tuareg {{rebels and}} the Islamist rebel group <b>Ansar</b> <b>Dine</b> {{said they had}} {{surrounded}} Kidal. An official statement from the group read: [...] "Thanks to Allah the Almighty and his blessings, we will soon take our land in Kidal." ...|$|E
2500|$|UNESCO Director General Irina Bokova {{called for}} a stop to the destructions, shortly before the {{announcement}} that <b>Ansar</b> <b>Dine</b> had ceased the destructions, according to a local journalist. Haidara's assessment was echoed by the media, which read the action as reacting to UNESCO's decision to put the sites on the endangered list. The chairwoman of UNESCO's 36th session, Yeleonor Mitrofanova, told the World Heritage Committee meeting in Saint Petersburg that she [...] "appealed to all those engaged in the conflict in Timbuktu to exercise their responsibility – {{for the sake of}} future generations, spare the legacy of their past" [...] A source reported to be affiliated to a local imam was quoted as saying that <b>Ansar</b> <b>Dine</b> had [...] "raped Timbuktu today. It is a crime." ...|$|E
2500|$|In September 2012, Islamists {{destroyed}} the mausoleum of Cheik El-Kebir, located 330 kilometers from Gao. The tomb had been venerated {{by people of}} the Kunta tribe. Further destruction occurred with four mausoleums being razed on 23 December and an <b>Ansar</b> <b>Dine</b> official, Abou Dardar, being quoted by Agence France-Presse as saying that [...] "not a single mausoleum will remain in Timbuktu." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 1 April 2012, one {{day after}} the capture of Gao, Timbuktu was {{captured}} from the Malian military by the Tuareg rebels of the MNLA and <b>Ansar</b> <b>Dine.</b> Five days later, the MNLA declared the region independent of Mali as the nation of Azawad. [...] The declared political entity was not recognized by any local nations or the international community and it collapsed three months later on 12 July.|$|E
2500|$|... {{suggesting}} it could send an armed intervention force {{into the country}} and the International Criminal Court (ICC) following Mali's lead in terming the acts as [...] "war crimes." [...] While MNLA also criticised the Islamists for holding civilians and destroying the structures, <b>Ansar</b> <b>Dine</b> said that the destruction was due to violation of sharia and in reaction to UNESCO's labeling of the sites of Timbuktu and in Gao as [...] "in danger." ...|$|E
2500|$|Under Obama, the U.S. {{government}} {{supported in}} Malian {{government in the}} Northern Mali conflict, aiding Mali in its fight against Tuareg rebels and their Islamist extremist allies, including <b>Ansar</b> <b>Dine,</b> which the U.S. designed as a foreign terrorist organization in 2013. The U.S. provided counterterrorism, intelligence-sharing and other aid to the French military, which led an effort [...] "to drive out insurgents and protect a civilian Malian government." [...] The U.S. also provided logistical support, specifically by providing aerial refueling to the French Air Force.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the same}} time, UNESCO responded to appeals from the Malian {{government}} in Bamako to declare several sites {{within the city}} as [...] "endangered" [...] because it [...] "aims to raise cooperation {{and support for the}} sites threatened by the armed conflict in the region." [...] On 30 June 2012, a local journalist said that he was told <b>Ansar</b> <b>Dine</b> would start destroying 13 more Sufi cemeteries and mausolea of saints after having destroyed three, including the mausoleum of Sidi Mahmoud Ben Amar. They were then said to have destroyed the mausolea of Sidi El Mokhtar, Alfa Moya and five other sites with pick-axes, hoes and Kalashnikovs.|$|E
2500|$|Tuareg rebels {{launched}} a major offensive against Mali's {{security forces and}} [...] military {{in a bid to}} seize the northern town of Kidal on 6 February 2012. Some loyalist Tuareg fled to the city of Bamako, fearing reprisals after violent demonstrations {{in the first week of}} February. The Tuareg rebels had been bolstered by an influx of battle-hardened fighters from Libya. On 8 February, the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA) seized the Mali-Algeria border town of Tinzaouaten as Malian soldiers crossed into Algeria. Islamist <b>Ansar</b> <b>Dine</b> demanded the imposition of Islamic law in northern Mali, while the secular Tuareg nationalist Azawad National Liberation Movement (MNLA) have stated they want an autonomous, if not completely independent, homeland.|$|E
2500|$|On 2 July {{there were}} more destructions, most notably at Sidi Yahya's mausoleum, {{one of the three}} [...] "great mosques" [...] in the city built in the 15th century during the Islamic Golden Age, {{according}} to UNESCO. The militants broke down the door to the shrine, which, according to a local imam, was not supposed to be opened until the end of days. Sanda Ould Bamana then told the BBC that <b>Ansar</b> <b>Dine</b> had done almost 90% of what it sought to in destroying the mausolea in accordance with sharia, which he said does not permit tombs to be taller than 15 centimetres. Local imam, Alpha Abdoulahi, said that the militants wanted to [...] "destroy the mystery" [...] of the gateway and that he was offered [...] "50,000 CFA for repairs but I refused to take the money, saying that what they did is irreparable." ...|$|E
2500|$|The MNLA's {{spokesman}} Hama Ag Mahmoud, {{speaking from}} Nouakchott, {{said of the}} destructions that [...] "the perpetrators of these heinous acts, their sponsors, and those who support them must be made accountable." [...] On the 12 July, the MNLA released a statement that read [...] "we call on the USA, France and all other countries who want to stand against <b>Ansar</b> <b>Dine,</b> Boko Haram and al Qaeda who are now holding Timbuktu, Gao and Kidal to help us kill them and help the people in those cities." [...] The MNLA and Tuareg refugees claimed, in interviews with the Western media, that Islamists had only previously bested the MNLA, despite their boasts of the MNLA having more fighters, because of superior firepower {{and the presence of}} foreign Islamist groups, like AQIM. An MNLA official in Nouakchott later clarified that they would only fight to remove the Islamists if [...] "we are not the ones to fight the terrorists all alone...it is important that the outside powers help us, to even up the balance of power." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{head of the}} Tombouctou Manuscripts Project at the University of Cape Town, Shamil Jeppie, {{said that}} the {{destruction}} was akin {{to that of the}} Buddhas of Bamiyan. [...] "It's a real loss for people in the town, in the region and on the continent. Timbuktu was a center of Islamic learning, a very significant center — there is lots of internal and external evidence of this. But <b>Ansar</b> <b>Dine</b> is ignorant of this. For them, there is only one book and it's the Quran. All this other (Islamic) learning is inconsequential to them." [...] The Chairman of the Malian Manuscript Foundation Michael Covitt, said from New York that the action led to [...] "generations and generations of culture being destroyed." [...] However, early estimates of the extent of the destruction were overstated. Timbuktu residents successfully saved more than 300,000 manuscripts by hiding or smuggling them out of Timbuktu. No more than 4,000 documents were lost or damaged when rebels set fires within the Ahmed Baba Institute, and all of them belonged to a set that had been copied by digitization. However, many of the preserved manuscripts were damaged in the process of rescuing and hiding them. In 2014 UNESCO appealed for assistance to conserve and restore the Timbuktu manuscripts and to continue making digital copies.|$|E
2500|$|Voice of America {{reported}} {{that people in}} the city say the actions of <b>Ansar</b> <b>Dine</b> as unrelated to Islamic thought and teachings, but instead targeted at avenging the threats of the [...] "international community" [...] and the Western world-led War on Terror. Timbuktu MP in the National Assembly of Mali, Haïdara El Hadji Baba, said that [...] "Ansar Dine’s real motivation in doing this was to defy the international community;” he cited the destructions as emanating after UNESCO's classification of the shrines as [...] "in danger." [...] He further warned that after Bensouda told the French media on 1 July that the actions could be called war crimes there could be more to come. [...] "With its condemnations the international community is only intensifying Ansar Dine's desire to destroy." [...] UNESCO's World Heritage Centre's Africa head, Lazare Eloundou Assomo, refused responsibility for the action in saying that it was [...] "normal" [...] for supranational bodies to denounce the destruction of what she termed [...] "world heritage." [...] She added: [...] "Would you have UNESCO remain silent about this? No. It’s crucial that we declare that these sites are important to the entire world and it’s everyone’s responsibility to protect them." [...] While Reuters was similarly critical of the move, it also cited Ansar Dine's Sanda Ould Boumama speaking to Radio France Internationale saying that [...] "human beings cannot be elevated higher than God ... When the Prophet entered Mecca, he said that all the mausoleums should be destroyed. And that's what we're repeating." ...|$|E
50|$|On 26 May, the MNLA and {{its former}} co-belligerent <b>Ansar</b> <b>Dine</b> {{announced}} a pact to merge {{to form an}} Islamist state.
