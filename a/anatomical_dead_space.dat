40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Patients {{with chronic}} heart failure have an {{excessive}} ventilatory response to exercise, characterised {{by an increase}} in the slope of the relation between ventilation and carbon dioxide production (VE/VCO 2 slope). Patients have an altered respiratory pattern with an increased respiratory rate (f) at a given tidal volume (VT), which may result in increased <b>anatomical</b> <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> ventilation. METHODS [...] The ventilatory responses in 88 patients with chronic heart failure and 43 age matched controls during maximal incremental treadmill exercise were analysed. Peak oxygen consumption (VO 2), VE/VCO 2 slope, and the slope of the relation between f and VT were derived. <b>Anatomical</b> <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> was estimated from a standard formula and <b>anatomical</b> <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> ventilation calculated. RESULTS [...] Peak VO 2 was greater (mean (SD)) (33. 2 (8. 5) v 19. 4 (6. 7) ml/min/kg; P < 0. 001) and the VE/VCO 2 slope lower in the controls (25. 96 (4. 16) v 35. 14 (9. 80); P < 0. 001). During matched submaximal exercise VT was higher (1. 97 (0. 92) v 1. 68 (0. 62) 1; P < 0. 05) and flower in the controls (18. 23 (6. 48) v 24. 28 (7. 58); P < 0. 001). At peak exercise {{there was no difference in}} f, but VT was higher in the controls (2. 66 (0. 97) v 1. 90 (0. 61) 1; P < 0. 001). The VT/f slope was the same (0. 04 (0. 04)) in both groups. The intercept of the relation was greater for the control group (1. 31 (1. 28) v 0. 59 (0. 83); P < 0. 001). <b>Anatomical</b> <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> ventilation was lower in the controls at submaximal work load (4. 17 (1. 56) v 5. 58 (1. 93) l/min; P < 0. 001). At peak exercise <b>anatomical</b> <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> ventilation was the same in both groups, but was lower expressed as a percentage of total VE in the control group (9. 8 (3. 3) v 13. 5 (4. 0); P < 0. 001). There were weak relations within the heart failure group alone between VT/f slope and peak VO 2 and VE/VCO 2 slope. CONCLUSIONS [...] The relation between <b>anatomical</b> <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> ventilation and VE/VCO 2 slope is expected: as f increases, so do VE/VCO 2 slope and <b>anatomical</b> <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> ventilation.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Anatomic <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> (also called airway or {{tracheal}} <b>dead</b> <b>space)</b> is {{the part}} of the tidal volume that does not participate in gas exchange. Some contemporary ventilation protocols, such as the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Network protocol, call for smaller tidal volumes than were traditionally delivered. With smaller tidal volumes, the percentage of each delivered breath that is wasted in the anatomic <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> is greater than it is with larger tidal volumes. Many respiratory and medical textbooks state that anatomic <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> can be estimated from the patient’s weight by assuming there is approximately 1 mL of <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> for every pound of body weight. With a volumetric capnography monitor that measures on-airway flow and CO 2, the anatomic <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> can be automatically and directly measured with the Fowler method, in which <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> equals the exhaled volume up to the point when CO 2 rises above a threshold. METH-ODS: We analyzed data from 58 patients (43 male, 15 female) to assess the accuracy of 5 anatomic <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> estimation methods. Anatomic <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> was measured during the first 10 min of monitoring and compared to the estimates. RESULTS: The coefficient of determination (r 2) be-tween the anatomic <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> estimate based on body weight and the measured anatomic <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> was r 2 0. 0002. The mean SD error between the body weight estimate and the measured <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> was 60 54 mL. CONCLUSIONS: It appears that the anatomic <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> estimate methods were sufficient when used (as originally intended) together with other assumptions to identify a starting point in a ventilation algorithm, but the poor agreement between an individual patient’s measured and estimated anatomic <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> contradicts the assumption that <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> can be predicted from actual or ideal weight alone.

30|$|Introduction Nasal high-flow (NHF) is {{increasingly}} {{used in the}} management of acute respiratory failure. Previous data suggest that the high-flow rates may result in an <b>anatomical</b> <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> washout.

40|$|Minute ventilation, {{respiratory}} rate, and metabolic {{gas exchange}} were measured continuously during maximal symptom limited treadmill exercise in 30 patients with stable chronic heart failure. The ventilatory response to exercise {{was assessed by}} calculation of {{the slope of the}} relation between minute ventilation and rate of carbon dioxide production. There was a close correlation between the severity of heart failure, determined as the maximal rate of oxygen consumption, and the ventilatory response to exercise. Reanalysis of the data after correction for ventilation of <b>anatomical</b> <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> did not significantly weaken the correlation but reduced the slope of the relation by approximately one third. These results show that the increased ventilatory response to exercise in patients with chronic heart failure is largely caused by mechanisms other than increased ventilation of <b>anatomical</b> <b>dead</b> <b>space.</b> This finding supports the concept that a significant pulmonary ventilation/perfusion mismatch develops in patients with chronic heart failure and suggests that the magnitude of this abnormality {{is directly related to the}} severity of chronic heart failure...|$|E

30|$|In {{clinical}} situation, NOC is less used {{than the}} NC. Compared to the NC, NOC {{is an alternative}} to increase the FDO 2 with the same OFR. NOC is more efficient than NC because during expiratory time, <b>anatomical</b> <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> it fills with O 2, which increases the FDO 2.

30|$|An HFNC flow of 10  L/min {{delivers}} 166  mL/s {{of fresh}} gas and washes out the <b>anatomical</b> <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> of 130  mL in only 0.78  s. In normal- and obstructive-lung, open-mouth models, {{there was enough}} time after exhalation and {{before the beginning of}} the next inspiration (Fig. 4) to reach the maximum washout effect with an HFNC flow of 10  L/min. With the restrictive-lung, open-mouth model, inspiration started right after exhalation ended; therefore, HFNC of 10  L/min was not enough, and 20  L/min was required to totally wash out the <b>anatomical</b> <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> and reach the maximum washout effect in this condition. A high respiratory rate and a shorter time after exhalation make the HFNC washout effect less efficient: a higher HFNC flow is required to reach the maximum effect. The normal-lung, closed-mouth model requires more HFNC flow to reduce PETCO 2 than open-mouth models. This phenomenon was thought to be because delivered gas from the HFNC must enter and exit from only the nostrils with the closed-mouth condition; thus, the closed-mouth condition is much less efficient than the open-mouth condition in which delivered gas enters through the nostrils and exits from the oral cavity. In a past study recording capnograms with TGI, intubated and mechanically ventilated patients showed a decrease of PCO 2 during phase 3, and this reduction was said {{to be associated with the}} efficiency of reducing dead space ventilation [9, 14]. In our study, capnograms recorded at the upper pharynx and oral cavity showed the same PCO 2 decrease at phase 3 but not at the trachea, which meant that HFNC-delivered gas was not able to reach down to the trachea. This would be a difference between HFNC and TGI, in which the gas delivered in the trachea causes turbulence for the alveolar dead space effect.|$|E

30|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that during HFNC, {{patients}} decrease their minute inspiratory volume maintaining stable the PaCO 2 [15 – 17]. These findings indirectly support the hypothesis that HFNC decreases the neuro-ventilatory drive and work of breathing mainly through its “CO 2 wash out” effect [11, 13, 15 – 17]. Since we found that T-HF does not impact on the neuro-ventilatory drive and work of breathing, we speculate that these negative results are {{explained by the fact that}} T-HF has negligible “CO 2 wash out effect” compared with HFNC.
