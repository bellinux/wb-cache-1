25|$|In her {{introduction}} to Bone Dance, she tells us, “I {{have often been}} identified as a ‘protest poet,’ and although something in me frowns at being so neatly categorized, that is largely the truth.” A huge element of her poetry is political, which is also unsurprising knowing her involvement in AIM and other Native American movements. <b>As</b> <b>she</b> <b>puts</b> <b>it,</b> “because the political is personal” it becomes a part of the poetry, whether intentionally so or not.|$|E
25|$|On 3 July 1980, Vysotsky gave a {{performance}} at a suburban Moscow concert hall. One {{of the stage}} managers recalls that he looked visibly unhealthy ("gray-faced", <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>puts</b> <b>it)</b> and complained of not feeling too good, while another says she was surprised by his request for champagne {{before the start of}} the show, as he had always been known for completely abstaining from drink before his concerts. On 16 July Vysotsky gave his last public concert in Kaliningrad. On 18 July, Vysotsky played Hamlet for the last time at the Taganka Theatre. From around 21 July, several of his close friends were on a round-the-clock watch at his apartment, carefully monitoring his alcohol intake and hoping against all odds that his drug dependency would soon be overcome and they would then be able to bring him back from the brink. The effects of drug withdrawal were clearly getting the better of him, as he got increasingly restless, moaned and screamed in pain, and at times fell into memory lapses, failing to recognize at first some of his visitors, including his son Arkadiy. At one point, Vysostsky's personal physician A. Fedotov (the same doctor who had brought him back from clinical death a year earlier in Uzbekistan) attempted to sedate him, inadvertently causing an asphyxiation from which he was barely saved. On 24 July, Vysotsky told his mother that he thought he was going to die that day, and then made similar remarks to a few of the friends present at the apartment, who begged him to stop such talk and keep his spirits up. But soon thereafter, Oksana Afanasyeva saw him clench his chest several times, which led her to suspect that he was genuinely suffering from a cardiovascular condition. She informed Fedotov of this, but was told not to worry, as he was going to monitor Vysotsky's condition all night. In the evening, after drinking relatively small amounts of alcohol, the moaning and groaning Vysotsky was sedated by Fedotov, who then sat down on the couch next to him but fell asleep. Fedotov awoke in the early hours of 25 July to an unusual silence, and found Vysotsky dead in his bed with his eyes wide open, apparently of a myocardial infarction, as he later certified. This was contradicted by Fedotov's colleagues, Sklifosovsky Emergency Medical Institute physicians L. Sul'povar and S. Scherbakov (who had demanded the actor's instant hospitalization on 23 July, but were, allegedly, defied by Fedotov), who insisted that Fedotov's incompetent sedation combined with alcohol was what killed Vysotsky. An autopsy was prevented by Vysotsky's parents (who were eager to have their son's drug addiction remain secret), so the true cause of death remains unknown.|$|E

This scene was also toned down by Hammerstein; in early drafts, Nellie, {{initially}} unable to force out a word to describe Emile's first wife, after he supplies the word [...] "Polynesian", responds with [...] "colored". [...] This pronouncement, which makes Nellie less sympathetic as a character, was restored for the 2008 Lincoln Center production. [...] As Frank Rich of The New York Times commented, [...] "it's upsetting because Nellie isn't some cracker stereotype– she's lovable... But how can we love a racist?" [...] Most argues that even Emile is tainted by racism, as his lifestyle is dependent on the maintenance of a system whereby he benefits from underpaid native labor– Bloody Mary is able to attract workers to make grass skirts for sale to GIs because, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>puts</b> <b>it,</b> [...] "French planters stingy bastards!" ...|$|E

[...] "It cannot be aware only of itself—there is no 'itself' until it is aware of something." [...] Thus, Objectivism holds that the mind does not create reality, but rather, it {{is a means of}} discovering reality. Expressed differently, existence has [...] "primacy" [...] over consciousness, which must conform to it.

[...] She maintains {{that not only is}} [...] "an erotic interest in oneself as a gendered being," [...] <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>puts</b> <b>it,</b> a non-pathological and indeed necessary component of regular sexual attraction to others, but within the framework of erotic structuralism, a [...] "misdirected" [...] attraction to oneself as postulated by Blanchard is outright nonsensical.|$|E

That most religions are old and that religion is always new.... Well, putting it simply, religion is the perpetual rediscovery of that Great Thing Out There.... What the Great Thing is goes by all sorts of names, but if you know it's there and if you remember it's there, you've got religion.... That's about how she figured it out.... I shall send you the book as soon as a copy comes over to me.... I can't profess to put it as clearly <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>puts</b> <b>it.</b> She's got a real analytical mind.

She said it was the likes of her, millions of her, that did stand behind Lloyd George, and did hearten him up. That was the key-note of her speech. Dear old Susan! She is a perfect dynamo of patriotism and loyalty and contempt for slackers of all kinds, and when she let it loose on that audience in her one grand outburst she electrified it. Susan always vows she is no suffragette, but she gave womanhood its due that night, and she literally made those men cringe. When she finished with them they were ready to eat out of her hand. She wound up by ordering them--yes, ordering them--to march up to the platform forthwith and subscribe for Victory Bonds. And after wild applause most of them did it, even Warren Mead. When the total amount subscribed came out in the Charlottetown dailies the next day we found that the Glen led every district on the Island--and certainly Susan has the credit for it. She, herself, after she came home that night was quite ashamed and evidently feared that she had been guilty of unbecoming conduct: she confessed to mother that she had been 'rather unladylike.' ...|$|E
