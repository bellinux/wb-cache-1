5|$|Although in most {{countries}} English is not <b>an</b> <b>official</b> language, it is currently the language most often taught as a foreign language. In {{the countries of the}} EU, English is the most widely spoken foreign language in nineteen of the twenty-five member states where it is not <b>an</b> <b>official</b> language (that is, the countries other than the UK, Ireland and Malta). In a 2012 official Eurobarometer poll, 38 percent of the EU respondents outside the countries where English is <b>an</b> <b>official</b> language said they could speak English well enough to have a conversation in that language. The next most commonly mentioned foreign language, French (which is the most widely known foreign language in the UK and Ireland), could be used in conversation by 12 percent of respondents.|$|E

40|$|In our framed {{laboratory}} experiment, two Public <b>Officials,</b> <b>A</b> and B, make consecutive {{decisions regarding}} embezzlement from separate funds. Official B observes <b>Official</b> <b>A's</b> decision before making their own. There are four treatments: three with deterrence and one without. We find a peer effect in embezzlement in that facing <b>an</b> honest <b>Official</b> <b>A</b> reduces embezzlement by Official B. Likewise, deterrence matters in that higher detection probabilities significantly decrease embezzlement. Crucially, detection {{is more effective}} in curbing embezzlement when chosen by <b>an</b> honest <b>Official</b> <b>A</b> compared to <b>a</b> corrupt <b>Official</b> <b>A</b> at almost all individual detection levels. This 'legitimacy' effect {{may help explain why}} anti-corruption policies can fail in countries where the government itself is believed to be corrupt...|$|R

5|$|Although French is <b>an</b> <b>official</b> {{language}} {{for the purposes}} of the legislature, legislation, and the courts, the Manitoba Act does not require it to be <b>an</b> <b>official</b> {{language for}} the purpose of the executive branch (except when performing legislative or judicial functions).
