500|$|In 2001, Chabon {{reflected}} {{on the success of}} his first novel by saying that while [...] "the upside was that I was published <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> readership, ... downside ... was that, emotionally, this stuff started happening and I was still like, 'Wait a minute, is my thesis done yet?' It took me a few years to catch up." [...] In 1991, Chabon published A Model World, a collection of short stories, many of which had been published previously in The New Yorker.|$|E

In the moment, I used my positive strength <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> reward for the passion, the work not only I, but the masseur Mimmo Pezza did together in Rimini. The injury should take one month to heal, Mimmo Pezza helped me be fit in less than half that. I thank this man for a beautiful moment which will be in my heart {{for as long as}} I can remember."

500|$|Pick {{introduced}} a common advertising policy, improving {{the appearance of}} stations by standardising poster sizes, limiting the number used and controlling their positioning. Before he took control of advertising, posters had been stuck up on any available surface on station buildings and platform walls in a crowded jumble of shapes and sizes that led to complaints from passengers {{that it was difficult}} to find the station name. Pick standardised commercial poster sizes on printers' double crown sheets, arranging these in organised groups to enable the station name to be easily seen. The Underground's own promotional posters were smaller, using single or paired double royal sheets, and were arranged separately from the commercial advertising. Pick described the process: [...] "after many fumbling experiments I arrived at some notion of how poster advertising ought to be. Everyone seemed quite pleased <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> reputation that really sprang out of nothing." ...|$|E

500|$|The new {{material}} for the album saw her collaboration with a well-known producer David Foster, {{who had worked with}} the likes of Barbra Streisand, Al Jarreau and Earth, Wind & Fire. Foster recalled the first time Madonna's publicist Liz Rosenberg contacting him for a dinner with the singer: [...] "When Madonna first called, I was a little surprised—my music isn't really hip enough for her—but I guess her camp thought we should meet, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> call from Liz Rosenberg, the PR maven who has been with Madonna from the beginning." [...] Not long after the dinner, Madonna and Foster began the recording session in his Malibu studio. During the album conception, Madonna was also asked by her Bedtime Stories producer Nellee Hooper to collaborate with British trip hop group Massive Attack for a Marvin Gaye tribute album. Previously, the band had offered the collaboration to several artists, including Chaka Khan who rejected it. Madonna and Massive Attack covered Gaye's 1976 hit [...] "I Want You", which finished among the {{new material}} for Something to Remember and was also included on the [...] released by Motown Records.|$|E
500|$|... "The Winds of Winter" [...] saw the {{departure}} of several cast members and recurring guest actors from the series. Notables included Dean-Charles Chapman, whose character, King Tommen Baratheon, committed suicide in the episode. Before appearing {{in the role of}} Tommen, which was originally portrayed by actor Callum Wharry, Chapman appeared in the third season of the series as Martyn Lannister, a minor character who was also killed off. Chapman stated that he found out about his character's death the night before the initial table read for the season, saying [...] "I was in my hotel, minding my own business, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> phone call. I picked up the phone, and instantly, I knew it was coming. It was David Benioff and Dan Weiss, the two creators of the show, and they stated the facts. But they did it really nice. I couldn't have asked for a better way to have that news broken to me. Them telling me beforehand really helped me out, otherwise I would have been in a state when I read it in the scripts. I probably would have cried." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Desperately Xeeking Xena" [...] {{was written}} by staff writer Long. At the {{beginning}} of the segment, Milhouse is seen wearing a plastic smock with a picture of Radioactive Man on it. The scene was based on an experience in Long's childhood; [...] "I asked my mom for a Batman costume. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> smock that had Batman on it and said 'Batman'. It was very dispiriting" [...] he said in the episode's DVD commentary. [...] "Stretch Dude & Clobber Girl"'s theme song {{was written by}} Long and composed by Alf Clausen. During the sequence, Stretch Dude and Clobber Girl are seen assaulting Saddam Hussein, the fifth President of Iraq and being thanked for their help by President Bill Clinton afterwards. According to Long, the writing staff had a [...] "passionate" [...] discussion about whether the duo would be attacking Hussein or Iranian religious leader and politician Ruhollah Khomeini during the sequence. Scully quipped that Hussein was chosen because [...] "he was always asking to be on the show." [...] The segment features New Zealand actress Lucy Lawless as herself. According to Long, Lawless was very happy with the segment's script. She was especially fond of the speech she gives to The Collector, in which she mentions that she was very tall as an adolescent. Lawless was directed by Scully, who commented that she was [...] "terrific". In an interview with the Hungarian online newspaper Origo, Lawless said that her part in the episode was the best experience she had guest-starring for a show. [...] "It was really funny when the Comic Book Guy kidnapped me", she said.|$|E

2500|$|The {{confusion}} over Franklin's [...] and Wilkins' roles {{in relation to}} the DNA effort (which later developed into considerable tension between them) is clearly attributable to Randall. In his letter of appointment he told Franklin [...] "as far as the experimental X-ray effort [...] is concerned, there will be at the moment only yourself and Gosling". However, Randall never informed Wilkins of his decision to give Franklin sole responsibility for the DNA effort and Wilkins only learned of the letter years after Franklin's death. He later wrote [...] "My opinion is very clear: that Randall was very wrong to have written to Rosalind telling her that Stokes and I wished to stop our work on DNA, without consulting us. After Raymond [...] <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> clear crystalline X-ray pattern I was very eager to continue that work...

2500|$|The {{second half}} of the 1990s saw Moby in career turmoil after years of being a {{successful}} techno wunderkind. The release in 1996 of Animal Rights, a dark, eclectic, guitar-fueled record built around the punk and metal records that he loved as a teenager, proved a critical and commercial disaster that left him considering quitting music altogether and going back to school to study architecture. He explained: [...] "I was opening for Soundgarden and getting shit thrown at me every night onstage. I did my own tour and was playing to roughly fifty people a night." [...] However, he claimed, [...] "I got one piece of fan mail from Terence Trent D'Arby <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> phone call from Axl Rose saying he was listening to Animal Rights on repeat.

Atherton was unhappy at the post-match press conference.

[...] The Sydney Morning Herald was less charitable towards England's performances to date, with Patrick Smith claiming that [...] "Wisden should count England wickets as just a half", and deploring Atherton's lack of aggression in the field. He also derided Gooch, Gatting and Hick, and picked out the way that the visitors' batsmen got themselves out so readily.|$|E

2500|$|According to {{an article}} {{published}} in The Times, the character of Edina was based on Lynne Franks. Franks believed Saunders had observed her and her children in detail after joining them on a family holiday. Josh Howie, Franks' son, reported that his mother was upset because one of her best friends [...] "had taken the piss out of her" [...] in a TV show. Saunders revealed in 2012 that she was also inspired by pop band Bananarama with whom she and Dawn French had become friends after their Comic Relief collaboration in 1989. [...] "The nights with Bananarama were some of the best nights of my life, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> lot of gags from Bananarama because they were big vodka drinkers...when I started doing AbFab, I remembered all of the falls that I saw Bananarama do. [...] I once saw one of them coming out of a cab bottom first and hitting the road, and I thought 'that's class'. Although Ab Fab was produced by Saunders and French's production company, Dawn French appeared on the show only once, in a cameo in the first-series episode [...] "Magazine".|$|E

Crenshaw is a foundation to my personality and my story. It’s where it took place at." [...] He explained the mixtape consists of mostly leftover tracks, [...] "I recorded a lot of songs for the Victory Lap project, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> certain vision I'm going for with the project, and I just did a lot of work and I think I got what I was looking for with the Victory Lap album, and I still got a lot of great records. So I'm like, I don't wanna sit on the songs, and I listened to the playlist and it kinda sounded like Crenshaw, it sounded like the environment, like my upbringing. So I went in and did a couple more records, put a couple skits and just really themed it, and I'm like I'ma give them the mixtape first just to excite the streets again and remind people what the sound is, give 'em an idea of what the album might sound like. And really kinda like, create the question in their mind, 'if this is the mixtape, what is gunna be on the album?'" ...|$|E
2500|$|One out {{of twenty}} to twenty-five stories {{received}} each week by 20th Century Fox in 1988, the original screenplay for Alien Nation was submitted as a spec–script to producer Gale Anne Hurd. The agency representing the storyline asked the production staff {{to view it}} {{as quickly as possible}} due to it being submitted to other film studios as well. Both Hurd and her director of development Ellen Collett had the same initial response, seeing the script as a real page-turner. According to Hurd, what really interested her about the film's story was the whole approach to the immigrant setting and the extrapolation of that to a science fiction setting. The genre of science fiction in regards to representing aliens, tends to usually be in the form of one or two beings as shown on network series' like Star Trek. Typically, large numbers of stand-ins were not common in film since the Planet of the Apes picture twenty years earlier. Working with co-producer Richard Kobritz, Hurd secured funding from Fox Studios and began casting an experienced makeup team for the creation of the alien society. Later, Hurd contacted cinematographer Adam Greenberg at his home in Israel to work on the production. Caught by surprise, Greenberg recalled, [...] "I was vacationing on the Dead Sea in a kibbutz (it was 125 degrees) <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> call from Gale. That was the last thing to expect there, ..." [...] Though mostly an action picture, Alien Nation was somewhat of a throwback to other similar genre films such as Planet of the Apes [...] and Silent Running. The alien Newcomers are relegated to a second-class status. Like other minorities, they live in their own neighborhoods, frequent their own clubs and develop their own underground. Following the murder of a policeman, a human must partner up with an alien to solve the murder. Their uneasy alliance creates a social mistrust, dealing with issues such as prejudice and racism. By the end of the saga, the two completely different humanoids have combined their talents and overcome their social barriers to complete their task.|$|E
