He was purely a behind-the-scenes {{participant in the}} group's stage productions until 1971, when director Bill Raiten persuaded {{him to take the}} role of Tevye in a production of the musical Fiddler on the Roof. His portrayal won praise, including a favorable review by playwright Samuel A. Taylor. A New York City producer who saw the show offered Mitchell a chance to play the same role in an off-Broadway production of the musical in Brooklyn. Mitchell, as the father of four children, felt committed to his financial career and declined the offer. However, he continued to act in local productions in the following years, became disenchanted with his job, and decided to pursue acting <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>profession.</b>|$|E

5|$|Julius Delius {{assumed that}} his son would {{play a part in}} the family wool business, and {{for the next three years}} he tried hard to persuade him to do so. Delius's first job was as the firm's {{representative}} in Stroud in Gloucestershire, where he did moderately well. After being sent in a similar capacity to Chemnitz, he neglected his duties in favour of trips to the major musical centres of Germany, and musical studies with Hans Sitt. His father sent him to Sweden, where he again put his artistic interests ahead of commerce, coming under the influence of the Norwegian dramatists Henrik Ibsen and Gunnar Heiberg. Ibsen's denunciations of social conventions further alienated Delius from his commercial background. Delius was then sent to represent the firm in France, but he frequently absented himself from business for excursions to the French Riviera. After this, Julius Delius recognised that there was no prospect {{that his son}} would succeed in the family business, but he remained opposed to music <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>profession,</b> and instead sent him to America to manage an orange plantation.|$|E

40|$|The aim {{with this}} study was to gain an {{understanding}} for teaching <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>profession,</b> and get <b>a</b> bigger knowledge about the certification of teaching and what it means for the teaching occupations status. To get an answer for this study two methods were used. The first method was a survey with questions that were sent out to working high school teachers in the North of Sweden. The second method was a document analysis of articales from three Swedish dailynewspapers. To analyse the results from this study <b>a</b> theory about <b>professions</b> is used troughout the whole paper. This studies resluts shows that <b>profession</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> definition is hard to undestand. On some level working teachers recognise there occupation <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>profession,</b> <b>an</b> analyis between one definition of profession and the results from this survey shows that teachers sees them selfves beeing in an semiprofession. The fakt that teaching is aknowledged <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>profession</b> from those outside the occupations could not be answered from this study, when the analyse from newspaperarticals shows that profession together with teaching occupation is something that is unusual. Furthermore, the results from the survey shows that working teachers feel that the certification of teachers had not had the expected effects on the teachers status. From the analysis of the newspaper articales it is hard to say if the certification has had any effect whatsoever, when the results points to both a positive change in status and no change at all in status. But the certification of a teacher is still a new process and is not expected to be completed until 1 july 2015, that means that there is still a chance that it will have an effect...|$|R
