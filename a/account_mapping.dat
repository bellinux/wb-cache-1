The system provides schedul-ing across multiple cluster Grids, user <b>account</b> <b>mapping</b> across domains, and file staging, thereby enabling the consolidation of organization-wide distributed resources into a virtual resource, while preserving local control of resources. The concept of abstract queue, as the unit of aggregating heterogeneous resources, is introduced and instantiated for distributed resource scheduling. The proposed system is an open source, standards-based al-ternative to similar commercial systems. ...|$|E

The main work and contribution have been generalized as follows: Through {{the research of}} existing onchip network mapping algorithm and global optimization algorithm, a multi-step mapping algorithm for low-power consumption have been designed, which is combined with the task allocation and the task scheduling. Compared with the traditional mapping algorithm, the algorithm in this paper takes the factors of task scheduling and allocation into <b>account,</b> <b>mapping</b> algorithm has three steps: task scheduling, IP core mapping and data block mapping.

40|$|Abstract—Network {{virtualization}} is a {{key provision}} for improv-ing the scalability and reliability of cloud computing services. In recent years, various mapping schemes {{have been developed to}} reserve VN resources over substrate networks. However, many cloud providers are very concerned about improving service re-liability under catastrophic disaster conditions yielding multiple system failures. To address this challenge, this work presents a novel failure region-disjoint VN mapping scheme to improve VN mapping survivability. The problem is first formulated as a mixed integer linear programming problem and then two heuristic solutions are proposed to compute a pair of failure region-disjoint VN mappings. The solution also takes into <b>account</b> <b>mapping</b> costs and load balancing concerns to help improve resource efficiencies. The schemes are then analyzed in detail for a variety of networks and their overall performances compared to some existing survivable VN mapping schemes.

40|$|In {{order to}} enable an open Grid to support {{resource}} sharing between multiple heterogeneous Virtual Organizations (VOs), an auhtorization policy management framework {{is required to}} support authorization for heterogeneous authorization systems. Traditional authorization policy management frameworks work well in authorization for a single VO where the participating hosts agree to follow a global authorization system. However they are not capable of policy management for multiple VOs which deploy heterogeneous authorization systems. To solve these problems in a loose-coupling way, we propose a dynamic, distributive and heterogeneous authorization policy management framework called Dynamic Policy Management Framework (DPMF). DPMF groups VOs of the same authorization systems to form a virtual cluster. Authorization policy management is divided into inter-cluster heterogeneous policy management, and intra-cluster homogeneous policy management. A Heterogeneous Authorization Policy Management mechanism is developed for DPMF to support inter-cluster heterogeneous policy management. In the mechanism, there is an <b>Account</b> <b>Mapping</b> mechanism for mapping accounts on heterogeneous access control models, and a Policy Mapping mechanism for mapping accounts on heterogeneous authorization policy models. ...|$|E

30|$|Our third {{research}} question focused on mentors’ accounts of difficulty in the mentoring relationship {{and how these}} <b>accounts</b> <b>mapped</b> onto their students’ scientist identity. For analyses concerning students’ scientist identity, we were especially interested in students with relatively low scientist identity compared to the overall sample mean of 4.32. Of note, students who were lower in scientist identity than their peers were not objectively low in scientist identity. Indeed, {{all students in the}} sample had sought out research mentoring, which implies at least some psychological identification with science. Accordingly, we grouped students into a moderate scientist identity group if they measured 4 or less on the 5 -point scientist identity measure (n[*]=[*] 23, M[*]=[*] 3.48) and a strong scientist identity group if they measured more than 4 (n[*]=[*] 43, M[*]=[*] 4.78).

It attracts the readers attention and gives an immediate impression of the news fact. To what extent the map readers perception corresponds to reality, is the leading question of this research. The impact of a newspaper map on the peoples world view is function of several factors, in particular the newspapers readership, the frequency of publishing, the maps location in the newspaper, the assigned space, the map type and the possible style arrangements. Also the broad reading public and the restricted reading time have to be taken into <b>account.</b> <b>Maps</b> found in newspapers are frequently surprising, innovative and aesthetic attractive.

40|$|Purpose The aim of {{this study}} is to examine how {{entrepreneurial}} orientation (EO) and the use of management <b>accounting</b> practices (<b>MAPs)</b> in decision making affects the profitability of SMEs, and also to analyze the extent to which EO and the use of MAPs affects profitability differently in growing and non-growing SMEs. Design/methodology/approach The paper employs an empirical investigation which is based on a sample of 153 Swedish manufacturing SMEs. The data is analyzed by two- and three way interaction regressions. Findings EO and MAPs have a positive effect on profitability in non-growing SMEs, but the combined effect of EO and MAPs has no additional effect. However, for growing SMEs, high usage of MAPs in decision making is a prerequisite for EO to influence profitability. Originality/value This study is the first to use the resource-based view to examine the relationship between two dimensions of resource organization and SME profitability. Entrepreneurial orientation (EO) is used as a proxy for how resources are organized in order to identify opportunities, and management <b>accounting</b> practices (<b>MAPs)</b> are used as a proxy for how efficiently resources are organized...|$|R

40|$|Hydraulic gold-mining {{tailings}} {{produced in}} the late nineteenth century in the Sierra Nevada foothills of California caused severe channel aggradation in the lower Feather and Yuba Rivers. Topographic and planimetric data from historical <b>accounts,</b> <b>maps,</b> topographic surveys, vertical sections, aerial photographs, and LiDAR (light detection and ranging) data reveal contrasting styles of channel change and floodplain evolution between these two rivers. For example, levee cross-channel spacings up to 4 km along the lower Yuba River contrast with spacings 12 in some reaches. Some of the larger of these channels remain clearly visible on aerial photographs and LiDAR imagery in spite of intensive agricultural leveling. Narrow levee spacings on the Feather River were designed to encourage transport of mining sediment downstream and keep the channel clear for navigation. Levee spacings on the lower Feather River reached a minimum near the turn of the twentieth century, when floodplain widths were reduced at several constricted reaches to < 250 m. Historical data indicate that the general channel location of the lower Yuba River had stabilized by the end of the nineteenth century, whereas substantial channel avulsions began later and continued into the twentieth century on the lower Feather River...|$|R
