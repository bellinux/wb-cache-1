Correct diagnosis, counseling, and avoidance advice based on valid allergy test results reduces the incidence of symptoms and need for medications, and improves quality of life. To assess the presence of allergen-specific IgE antibodies, two different methods can be used: a skin prick test, or an allergy blood test. Both methods are recommended, and they have similar diagnostic value.|$|E

25|$|Food allergy is a non-seasonal {{disease with}} skin and/or {{gastrointestinal}} disorders. The main complaint is excessive scratching (pruritus) {{which is usually}} resistant to treatment by steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The exact prevalence of food allergy in cats remains unknown. In 20 to 30% of the cases, cats have concurrent allergic diseases (atopy/flea-allergic dermatitis).

40|$|Background  The  {{association}} between  Mycobacterium  tuberculosis infection  and  atopy remains controversial. Reaction to tuberculosis infection  is  mediated  by  Th- 1   immune responses whereas {{allergic reactions}} are mediated  by  Th- 2 immune response. In patients with atopic syndrome who also suffer from tuberculosis infection,  the Th- 2   response will be suppressed  and  allergy manifestations will decrease. Therefore, it  is  important {{to determine the}} appropriate <b>allergy</b> <b>test</b> and to predict outcome after completing tuberculosis treatment. Objective  To  evaluate the influence  of  a positive tuberculin test on  skin test results in diagnosing atopic disease. Methods  A cross sectional study was  conducted  in  the  pediatric allergy  outpatient  clinic, Soetomo Hospital, Surabaya, Indonesia between 2004   and  2007. Eighty-five patients were enrolled in this study.   The  tuberculin test was performed  on  all patients with allergy.   The  <b>allergy</b> <b>test</b> was carried  out  by  performing a skin scratch test. Results  There  was a weak inverse correlation between positive tuberculin <b>tests</b> and positive <b>allergy</b> skin <b>tests</b> in children (house dust  mite, food  and  pet  allergies).   The  correlation between a positive  tuberculin  test  and  house  dust  mite <b>allergy</b> <b>test</b> was r:  - 0. 364   (P=O. OOl;  a=O. Ol).   The  correlation  between  the tuberculin  test  and  food allergies was  r:  - 0. 420   (P=O. OOl; a=O. Ol).   The  correlation between the tuberculin test  and  pet allergies was  r:  - 0. 344   (P=  0. 001;  a=O. Ol). Conclusions  A positive tuberculin test  is  weakly correlated with positive <b>allergy</b> skin <b>test</b> results, suggesting  that  it  is  appropriate  to do <b>allergy</b> skin <b>testing</b> even in children with a positive tuberculin test...|$|R
