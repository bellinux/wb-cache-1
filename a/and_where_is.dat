500|$|Another Banjo Paterson poem, called Brumby's Run, {{describes}} {{a mob of}} Brumbies running wild. [...] Paterson was inspired to write the poem when he read of a N.S.W.

500|$|The poem centres on {{humanity}} and human nature. When the poet sees the figures, {{he wants to}} know their names and laments his ignorance. Eventually, he realizes that they are representative of Love, Ambition, and Poetry. While he longs, he fears they are out of reach and therefore tries to reject them. He argues that love is what he needs least and dismisses it by questioning what [...] "love" [...] actually means ("What is Love? <b>and</b> <b>where</b> <b>is</b> it?"). He rejects ambition, but it requires more work ("And for that poor Ambition—it springs / From a man's little heart's short fever-fit;"). Unlike the personas of Love and Ambition, the narrator is unable to find a reason to banish Poesy (Poetry), which reflects the poets' inner conflict: should he abandon poetry to focus on a career in which he can earn a decent living? Keats's sought to write great poetry but feared his pursuit of literary prominence was based on a delusional view of his own merit as a poet. Further, he was incapable of completing his epic, [...] "Hyperion". As Walter Jackson Bate explains, to Keats [...] "Neither a finished 'grand Poem' nor even the semblance of a modest financial return seemed nearer." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Thomas Burnett Swann became {{strongly}} associated with Science Fantasy. He had published a couple of genre short stories before beginning to sell to Carnell with [...] "The Dryad-Tree" [...] in the August 1960 issue. Swann's speciality was historical fantasy, <b>and</b> <b>Where</b> <b>Is</b> the Bird of Fire?, his retelling of the Romulus and Remus myth, which was serialised in Science Fantasy in 1962, [...] "received more praise than any other [...] in recent years", according to Carnell. Swann {{was one of the}} three mainstays of Science Fantasy in the early 1960s: the others were Michael Moorcock and J.G. Ballard. Ballard's first story in Science Fantasy was [...] "Prima Belladona", which appeared in the December 1956 issue; his work {{over the next few years}} was ideally suited to Science Fantasy and he became a regular contributor. He published some conventional stories in the British magazines, but over the next few years Ballard's more traditional science fiction material appeared mostly in the American market, with Science Fantasy and New Worlds reserved for more experimental material that was a harbinger of New Wave science fiction. Moorcock's Elric of Melniboné series, about a sword and sorcery anti-hero, began with [...] "The Dreaming City" [...] in the June 1961 Science Fantasy, and Moorcock appeared frequently thereafter: he had either a story or an essay (and sometimes both) in all but four of the remaining issues edited by Carnell. Terry Pratchett's first story, [...] "The Hades Business", appeared in the August 1963 issue. Ashley regards the early 1960s as one of the high points of the magazine; it was nominated for the Hugo Award for each of the last three years in which Carnell edited it, from 1962 to 1964, but it never won.|$|E

2500|$|The {{novel that}} made its author [...] "the true lion of the Russian literature" [...] (according to Ivan Goncharov) enjoyed great {{success with the}} reading public upon its {{publication}} and spawned dozens of reviews and analytical essays, some of which (by Dmitry Pisarev, Pavel Annenkov, Dragomirov and Strakhov) {{formed the basis for}} the research of later Tolstoy scholars.

2500|$|Sumner {{repeatedly}} {{tried to}} remove the word [...] "white" [...] from naturalization laws. [...] He introduced bills to that effect in 1868 and 1869, but neither came to a vote. [...] On July 2, 1870, Sumner moved to amend a pending bill {{in a way that}} would strike the word [...] "white" [...] wherever in all Congressional acts pertaining to naturalization of immigrants. [...] On July 4, 1870, he said: [...] "Senators undertake to disturb us... by reminding us of the possibility of large numbers swarming from China; but the answer to all this is very obvious and very simple. If the Chinese come here, they will come for citizenship or merely for labor. [...] If they come for citizenship, then in this desire do they give a pledge of loyalty to our institutions; <b>and</b> <b>where</b> <b>is</b> the peril in such vows? [...] They are peaceful and industrious; how can their citizenship be the occasion of solicitude?" [...] He accused legislators promoting anti-Chinese legislation of betraying the principles of the Declaration of Independence: [...] "Worse than any heathen or pagan abroad are those in our midst who are false to our institutions." [...] Sumner's bill failed, and from 1870 to 1943, and in some cases as late as 1952, Chinese and other Asians were ineligible for naturalized U.S. citizenship.|$|E
2500|$|A special {{portion of}} Negoiţescu's essays {{deals with the}} meeting point between the {{currents}} of Romanian nationalism and the themes recovered by the Nicolae Ceauşescu regime. During his exile years, he was especially vocal in condemning Constantin Noica's late essays, which communist authorities tolerated for their critique of the Western world. To Noica's claim that Westerners had been pushed to [...] "hate the world", forgetting their roots and heading for a collective disaster, he replied: [...] "Is there now {{a place in the}} world that is more evidently heading for catastrophe than Romania is? [...] Where has the world been tarnished <b>and</b> <b>where</b> <b>is</b> it still tarnished more than in Noica's homeland? Where o where is European culture more degraded at this time than in the country where the very monuments of European significance and value are being more and more systematically torn down or mutilated in every way conceivable?" [...] Deeming his adversary's statements [...] "an offense to liberty itself", Negoiţescu also placed Noica's isolationism and anti-Europeanism in connection with a common attitude in post-World War II Romania. According to this claim, the country had been abandoned by Europe: [...] "like Noica, whose writings have no echo in the Occident, [...] feel that they are shouting in the desert and curse the desert which does not hear and does not answer them." [...] He believed to have identified the roots of this mentality in the political and cultural clashes of the Cold War, extending his earlier comments regarding the continental alignment of Romanian culture: [...] "after 1947 our culture has been forcefully torn from its natural European context." ...|$|E
