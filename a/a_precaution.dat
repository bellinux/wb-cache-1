Lysimachus also had to give his daughter in marriage to Dromichaetes.|$|R
5|$|After Mawson {{slipped into}} a crevasse, they began to tie {{themselves}} to their sledges as <b>a</b> <b>precaution.</b> Ninnis developed photokeratitis (snow-blindness), which Mawson treated with zinc sulfate and cocaine hydrochloride. They were also losing dogs; one broke his leg and was shot, another fell ill, and a third was lost down a crevasse. On 24 November, the party reached {{the eastern side of}} the glacier and ascended to the plateau.|$|E

As <b>a</b> <b>precaution,</b> officials set up two shelters in Kent County.|$|E
5|$|Khalid {{entered the}} fray yet again with this mobile guard. He feared a general {{attack on a}} broad front which he wouldn't be able to repulse and as <b>a</b> <b>precaution</b> ordered Abu Ubaidah and Yazid on the left centre and the left wings {{respectively}} to attack the Byzantine armies at the respective fronts. The attack would result in stalling the Byzantine front and prevent a general advance of the Imperial army.|$|E

Following the incident, the Danish fleet was grounded as <b>a</b> <b>precaution</b> and the AW101's future was publicly debated. In {{the first six months}} of 2008, the RDAF reported an operational availability of roughly 50%, well below the target of 80%, partly due to an inadequate maintenance organisation and staff shortages.|$|E

5|$|The {{pipeline}} {{was built}} to withstand earthquakes, forest fires, and other natural disasters. The 2002 Denali earthquake damaged some of the pipeline sliders designed to absorb similar quakes, and it caused the pipeline to shut down for more than 66 hours as <b>a</b> <b>precaution.</b> In 2004, wildfires overran portions of the pipeline, {{but it was not}} damaged and did not shut down.|$|E

50|$|The Game Boy Color re-release allows {{players to}} play against 99 AI-controlled fishermen. Tournament hours are twelve non-real time hours long, and all {{locations}} are fictional. Each game originally came with a 40-page instruction manual and <b>a</b> <b>precautions</b> booklet. Both versions of the game notify players when they have lost their lure and/or their fish through a text-based message. Once a player runs out {{of a certain kind}} of fishing lure, it cannot be recovered until the next gameplay.|$|R

5|$|After {{the battle}} the Grand Vizier forged bulletins in the Sultan's name, proclaiming victory. These {{announced}} that the Sultan regretted that his current state of health prevented him from continuing with the successful campaign.

5|$|Although {{nitrogen}} is non-toxic, when {{released into}} an enclosed space it can displace oxygen, and therefore presents an asphyxiation hazard. This may happen with few warning symptoms, since the human carotid {{body is a}} relatively poor and slow low-oxygen (hypoxia) sensing system. An example occurred shortly before {{the launch of the}} first Space Shuttle mission in 1981, when two technicians died from asphyxiation after they walked into a space located in the Shuttle's Mobile Launcher Platform that was pressurised with pure nitrogen as <b>a</b> <b>precaution</b> against fire.|$|E
5|$|At Isle of Palms in South Carolina, {{workers and}} dozens of firefighters {{prepared}} sandbags in preparation for high tide after waves from the storm previously caused moderate beach erosion.

The North Carolina Department of Transportation also canceled ferry transportation to and from Ocracoke and Knotts Island, North Carolina.|$|E
