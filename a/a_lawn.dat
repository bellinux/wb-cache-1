5|$|On {{the east}} side of the Inner Ward is another barbican, {{enclosing}} the castle garden. This was overlooked by the royal apartments, and changed in style over the years: in the early 14th century there was <b>a</b> <b>lawn,</b> in the late 14th century vines, in the 16th century crab-apple trees and <b>a</b> <b>lawn</b> and in the 17th century formal ornamental flowers. A postern gate originally led down to the river where a small dock was built, allowing key visitors to enter the castle in private and for the fortress to be resupplied by boat, although this gate is now concealed by the later bridges built on the site.|$|E
5|$|Christchurch has {{a council}} run leisure centre {{situated}} {{at the end of}} Stony Lane South. The complex contains a swimming pool, golf course and indoor bowling facility which is home to the East Dorset Indoor Bowls Club.

The town has two other lawn bowling clubs and golf courses; at Iford and Highcliffe.|$|E
5|$|On {{the outside}} is a garden, and <b>a</b> <b>lawn</b> {{area to the}} east with a small stage that is used for fair weather events such as summer concerts. Also outside the {{building}} is a new wheelchair ramp that {{was added to the}} east side where a new entrance was added. There are two terraces on the exterior of the building and the inside also has a kitchen area.|$|E

5|$|The {{entrance}} to the house faces an area of lawn and ornamental shrubbery. To the south east is a pathway to a pergola, {{in front of a}} terrace garden, with a paved walkway through topiary. The walkway leads to a flower garden and beyond to <b>a</b> <b>lawn</b> surrounded by yew hedges with an apse at one end. At {{the other end of the}} pergola is a walkway flanked by lime trees.|$|E
5|$|The {{case was}} brought after Jeffrey Heffernan, a detective with the Paterson, New Jersey police force, {{went to a}} {{distribution}} center and picked up <b>a</b> <b>lawn</b> sign for the candidate challenging the city's incumbent mayor in the 2005 election (Heffernan's mother had wanted a sign, so he was getting one for her). While Heffernan {{did not support the}} challenger, after other officers saw him with the sign they told senior officers, including the police chief, who strongly supported the mayor. For his apparent public support of the other candidate, they demoted Heffernan to beat patrol work as a uniformed officer.|$|E
5|$|The club {{moved to}} the second Hampden Park, 150yards from the original, because the Cathcart District Railway planned a new line through {{the site of the}} ground's western terrace. <b>A</b> <b>lawn</b> bowling club at the {{junction}} of Queen's Drive and Cathcart Road marks the site of the first Hampden. The second Hampden Park opened in October 1884. It became a regular home to the Scottish Cup Final, but Celtic Park shared some of the big matches including the Scotland v England fixture in 1894.|$|E
50|$|It {{can also}} be used to create <b>a</b> {{fragrant}} camomile <b>lawn.</b> <b>A</b> chamomile <b>lawn</b> needs light soil, adequate moisture, and sun in order to thrive. Each square meter contains 83-100 plants. The lawn is only suitable to light foot traffic or in places where mower access is difficult.|$|R
50|$|The {{southwest}} {{section of}} the garden consists of a grove of mature trees with a wide terrace below a dry-stone embankment. A masonry retaining wall separates this area from <b>a</b> raised <b>lawn</b> and garden {{on the western side}} of the structure. The southeast {{section of the}} garden has <b>an</b> open <b>lawn</b> bordered by mature trees and shrubs. A masonry retaining wall separates this area from <b>a</b> raised <b>lawn</b> and garden on the eastern side of Lochiel.|$|R
50|$|The first United States {{patent for}} <b>a</b> reel <b>lawn</b> mower was granted to Amariah Hills on January 12, 1868. In 1870, Elwood McGuire of Richmond, Indiana {{designed}} <b>a</b> human-pushed <b>lawn</b> mower, {{which was very}} lightweight and a commercial success. John Burr patented <b>an</b> improved rotary-blade <b>lawn</b> mower in 1899, with the wheel placement altered for better performance. Amariah Hills went on to found the Archimedean Lawn Mower Co. in 1871.|$|R
5|$|The {{pictorial}} {{space is}} bathed in soft light, probably an influence from Jan van Eyck. The light {{falls from the}} right, throwing shadows of both Mary and the Child's heads on the left wall of the niche. The Virgin and Child are shown seated in a small Gothic chapel or oratory projecting from a wall and opening onto <b>a</b> <b>lawn.</b> The painting pays very close attention to small realistic detail; for example, there are four small holes above each arch, likely to hold scaffolding.|$|E
5|$|The sensors were {{designed}} for air deployment by either of two means. The first was by parachute, which would hang the devices in trees, where {{they appeared to be}} part of the foliage. The second method was the use of gravity, which would drive the spike-shaped device into the ground like <b>a</b> <b>lawn</b> dart, burying all but their antennae, which {{were designed}} to appear as weeds. Surprisingly, approximately 80 percent of the air-dropped sensors were found to be operational after delivery.|$|E
5|$|To {{the west}} of the house is the former mill pond. From the south side <b>a</b> <b>lawn</b> slopes down to another pond beyond which is a small ravine with a stone bridge, this area being known as Killtime. To {{the west of}} the lawn is the sunken Dutch Garden, which was created by William Legh. It {{consists}} of formal flower beds with a central fountain. To the west, south and east of the orangery are further formal flower gardens, including rose gardens.|$|E

5|$|The {{sports complex}} was {{purposely}} {{built for the}} 2008 Malaysian Games (Malay: Sukan Malaysia or SUKMA). Besides the main stadium, the sports complex also contains other facilities such as the Indoor Stadium, football fields, a rugby field, <b>a</b> <b>lawn</b> bowls field, a hockey pitch, and bowling lanes. A sport school to search for new generation athletes is being built to make full use of the facilities provided. Other venues catered for sports in Terengganu are, among others, Kuala Terengganu Aquatic Centre, Kuala Terengganu Hockey Stadium (the home ground for Terengganu Hockey Team), Kuala Terengganu Tennis Courts, and Kuala Terengganu Lawn Bowls Fields. There are three golf courses in Kuala Terengganu, namely the Royal Terengganu Golf Club in Batu Buruk, Ibai Golf & Country Resort in Kuala Ibai, and Kuala Terengganu Golf Resort in Tok Jembal.|$|E
5|$|Then, the High Line passes {{under the}} Chelsea Market, a food hall, at 15th Street. A spur {{connecting}} the viaduct to the National Biscuit Company building splits off at 16th Street; this spur is {{closed to the}} public. The Tenth Avenue Square, an amphitheater located on the viaduct, is at 17th Street, where the High Line crosses over Tenth Avenue from southeast to northwest. At 23rd Street, there is the 23rd Street Lawn, <b>a</b> <b>lawn</b> where visitors can rest. Then, between 25th and 26th Streets, a ramp takes visitors above the viaduct, with a scenic overlook facing east at 26th Street. The Philip Falcone and Lisa Maria Falcone flyover, as it is called, is named after two major donors to the park; this ramp was based on plans for a Phase 1 flyover that was never built.|$|E
5|$|The watch members use {{the group}} {{as an excuse to}} drink and have fun, much to Evan's annoyance. While driving on patrol, they accidentally hit something. They {{discover}} a strange metallic orb that acts as a highly destructive weapon and deduce that it is of alien origin. Meanwhile, several more townspeople are mysteriously killed. The watch responds to the murders and encounters an alien, which attacks them. Evan apparently kills it with <b>a</b> <b>lawn</b> gnome before the group returns with the creature to Bob's house. The creature regains consciousness and escapes, stealing the metallic orb and warning them that the aliens have already infiltrated the town. The watch members theorize that the aliens are stealing their victims' skins and disguising themselves as humans, so anyone in Glenview could be an alien. Bob confides to Evan that he is worried about his daughter Chelsea (Erin Moriarty) and does not trust her boyfriend Jason (Nicholas Braun). Evan admits that he has been avoiding his wife Abby (Rosemarie DeWitt) because he is infertile, and reveals his worry that it may cause her to leave.|$|E
