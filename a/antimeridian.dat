From 1524 to 1529 Portuguese and Spanish experts met at Badajoz-Elvas trying to find the exact location of the <b>antimeridian</b> of Tordesillas, which would divide the world into two equal hemispheres. Each crown appointed three astronomers and cartographers, three pilots and three mathematicians. Lopo Homem, Portuguese cartographer and cosmographer was in the board, along with cartographer Diogo Ribeiro on the Spanish delegation. The board met several times, without reaching an agreement: the knowledge at that time was insufficient for an accurate calculation of longitude, and each group gave the islands to its sovereign. The issue was settled only in 1529, after a long negotiation, with the signing of Treaty of Zaragoza, that attributed the Maluku Islands to Portugal and the Philippines to Spain.|$|E

5000|$|The Western Hemisphere is a {{geographical}} {{term for the}} half of the earth which lies west of the Prime meridian (which crosses Greenwich, UK) and east of the <b>antimeridian.</b> The other half is called the Eastern Hemisphere.|$|E
50|$|The full grid uses offsets {{from the}} South Pole (-90&deg;) and the <b>antimeridian</b> (-180&deg;) {{expressed}} in base 20 representation. To avoid misreading or spelling objectionable words, the encoding excludes vowels and symbols {{that may be}} easily confused with each other. The following table shows the mapping.|$|E
50|$|To avoid {{negative}} {{numbers in}} the input data, the system specifies that latitude is measured from the South Pole to the North Pole, and longitude measured eastward from the <b>antimeridian</b> of Greenwich, giving the Prime Meridian a false easting of 180° and the equator a false northing of 90°.|$|E
5000|$|In 1524, both kingdoms {{organised}} the [...] "Junta de Badajoz-Elvas" [...] {{to resolve}} the dispute. Each crown appointed three astronomers and cartographers, three pilots and three mathematicians, who formed a committee to establish {{the exact location of}} the <b>antimeridian</b> of Tordesillas, and the intention was to divide the whole world into two equal hemispheres.|$|E
50|$|The {{meridian}} through Greenwich (inside Greenwich Park), England, {{called the}} Prime Meridian, {{was set at}} zero degrees of longitude, while other meridians were defined by the angle {{at the center of}} the earth between where it and the prime meridian cross the equator. As there are 360 degrees in a circle, the meridian on the opposite side of the earth from Greenwich, the <b>antimeridian,</b> forms the other half of a circle with the one through Greenwich, and is at 180° longitude near the International Date Line (with land mass and island deviations for boundary reasons). The meridians from West of Greenwich (0°) to the <b>antimeridian</b> (180°) define the Western Hemisphere and the meridians from East of Greenwich (0°) to the <b>antimeridian</b> (180°) define the Eastern Hemisphere. Most maps show the lines of longitude. The position of the prime meridian has changed a few times throughout history, mainly due to the transit observatory being built next door to the previous one (to maintain the service to shipping). Such changes had no significant practical effect. Historically, the average error in the determination of longitude was much larger than the change in position. The adoption of WGS84 ("World Geodetic System 84") as the positioning system has moved the geodetic prime meridian 102.478 metres east of its last astronomic position (measured at Greenwich). The position of the current geodetic prime meridian is not identified at all by any kind of sign or marking (as the older astronomic position was) in Greenwich, but can be located using a GPS receiver.|$|E
5000|$|Of {{interesting}} note is {{that the}} island of Taveuni crosses the east-west <b>antimeridian</b> so the [...] "north-eastern" [...] portion of the island is located at -179 degrees longitude and the south-western part at +179 degrees longitude. This is often an example that causes havoc to GIS software in which a polygon geometry {{around the perimeter of}} the island is incorrectly rendered and wraps around the globe.|$|E
50|$|A prime {{meridian}} is a meridian (a line of longitude) in a geographical coordinate system at which longitude is defined to be 0°. Together, a {{prime meridian}} and its <b>antimeridian</b> (the 180th meridian in a 360°-system) form a great circle. This great circle divides the sphere, e.g., the Earth, into two hemispheres. If one uses directions of East and West from a defined prime meridian, {{then they can}} be called Eastern Hemisphere and Western Hemisphere.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} ways to divide the {{meridian}} into semicircles. One way is to divide it into the local meridian and the <b>antimeridian.</b> The former semicircle contains the zenith and is terminated by the celestial poles; the latter semicircle contains the nadir. In the horizontal coordinate system, the meridian is divided into halves terminated by the horizon's north and south points. The upper meridian passes through the zenith while the lower meridian passes through the nadir.|$|E
50|$|The 180th {{meridian}} or <b>antimeridian</b> is the meridian 180° {{east or west}} of the Prime Meridian, {{with which}} it forms a great circle dividing the earth into the Western and Eastern Hemispheres. It is common to both east longitude and west longitude. It is {{used as the basis}} for the International Date Line because it for the most part passes through the open waters of the Pacific Ocean. However, the meridian passes through Russia and Fiji as well as Antarctica.|$|E
5000|$|The Eastern Hemisphere is a {{geographical}} {{term for the}} half of the earth which is east of the prime meridian (which crosses Greenwich, England) and west of the <b>antimeridian.</b> It {{is also used to}} refer to Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia, in contrast with the Western Hemisphere, which includes North and South America. This hemisphere may also be called the [...] "Oriental Hemisphere". In addition, it may be used in a cultural or geopolitical sense as a synonym for the [...] "Old World".|$|E
50|$|The {{lands to}} the east would belong to Portugal and the lands to the west to Castile. The treaty was signed by Spain, 2 July 1494 and by Portugal, 5 September 1494. The {{other side of the}} world was divided a few decades later by the Treaty of Zaragoza, signed on 22 April 1529, which {{specified}} the <b>antimeridian</b> to the line of demarcation specified in the Treaty of Tordesillas. Originals of both treaties are kept at the Archivo General de Indias in Spain and at the Arquivo Nacional da Torre do Tombo in Portugal.|$|E
50|$|Geologists {{interpret}} {{the shape of}} Vanua Levu as an amalgamation of several islands that melded through successive stages of uplift. The {{main part of the}} island is roughly shaped like a tall, thin triangle 30 to(-) 50 km in width and 180 km in length, rotated so that the point is to the northeast. This point, the northernmost in the Fiji chain, is Udu Point. From the southeastern side of this triangle, a long peninsula stretches out into the Koro Sea. The island is surrounded by coral reefs, and is rough and hilly. The <b>antimeridian</b> passes through this island.|$|E

50|$|The first Portuguese {{references}} to Malacca appear after Vasco da Gama's return from his expedition to Calicut that opened a direct route to India around the Cape of Good Hope. It {{was described as}} a city that was 40 days' journey from India, where clove, nutmeg, porcelains and silks where transactioned, and was supposedly ruled by a sovereign who could gather 10,000 men for war and was Christian. Since then, King Manuel showed an interest in making contact with Malacca, believing it to be at, or at least close to, the <b>antimeridian</b> of Tordesillas. In 1505 Dom Francisco de Almeida was dispatched by King Manuel I of Portugal as the first Viceroy of Portuguese India, tasked to, among other things, discover its precise location.|$|E
5000|$|Since {{there was}} not a set limit to the east, in 1524 both kingdoms had tried to find the exact {{location}} of the <b>antimeridian</b> of Tordesillas, which would divide the world into two equal hemispheres and to resolve the [...] "Moluccas issue". A board met several times without reaching an agreement: the knowledge at that time was insufficient for an accurate calculation of longitude, and each gave the islands to their sovereign. An agreement was reached only with the Treaty of Zaragoza, signed on 1529 between Spain and Portugal. It assigned the Moluccas to Portugal and the Philippines to Spain. The course that Magellan charted was followed by other navigators, such as Sir Francis Drake. In 1565, Andrés de Urdaneta discovered the Manila-Acapulco route.|$|E
50|$|Rabi {{has four}} main {{settlements}} - all named after, and populated by the descendants of, four villages on Banaba that were destroyed by the invading Japanese forces in the Second World War. Tabwewa Village, formerly known as Nuku in Fijian, is the administrative centre of Rabi. Located in the far north of the island, Tabwewa boasts administrative buildings, a wharf, a post office, court house, a hospital, and a guest house - {{the only one on}} the island. 14 kilometers to the south of Tabwewa is Tabiang (formerly Siosio), the home of Rabi's only school and an airstrip. Other major settlements include Uma (formerly Wiinuku), between Tabwewa and Tabiang, and Buakonikai (formerly Aoteqea), some 22 kilometers from Tabwewa. Rabi is the eighth largest island of Fiji and the <b>antimeridian</b> passes through this island.|$|E
50|$|As {{there was}} not a set eastern limit to the Tordesillas line, both kingdoms {{organized}} meetings to resolve the issue. From 1524 to 1529 Portuguese and Spanish experts met at Badajoz-Elvas trying to find the exact location of the <b>antimeridian</b> of Tordesillas, which would divide the world into two equal hemispheres.

50|$|The CPHC's area of {{responsibility}} is the Central Pacific (CP) region, which is an administrative region, not a meteorological one. It is not a tropical cyclone basin (a distinct area where cyclones form), but is still {{often referred to as}} the Central Pacific basin or Central North Pacific basin. The western edge of the area {{of responsibility}}, 180°W, is formally the <b>antimeridian,</b> though this coincides with the International Date Line for tropical latitudes, and thus these are often conflated. Meteorologically, this region covers the western part of the Eastern Pacific basin and the eastern part of the Western Pacific basin, though administratively the National Hurricane Center is responsible for the Eastern Pacific basin east of 140°W, and thus the Eastern Pacific region (EP) typically refers to region east of 140°W, not the whole meteorological basin. The region east of 140°W was formerly the responsibility of the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center; like the CPHC, it took responsibility in 1970, but it is now folded into the NHC.|$|E
50|$|The line demarcating the Eastern and Western Hemispheres is an {{arbitrary}} convention, unlike the Equator (an imaginary line encircling the earth, equidistant from its poles) which divides the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The prime meridian at 0° longitude and the <b>antimeridian,</b> at 180° longitude are the conventionally accepted boundaries, since they divide eastern longitudes from western longitudes. This convention {{was established in}} 1884 at the International Meridian Conference held in Washington, D.C. where the standard time concepts of Canadian railroad engineer Sir Sandford Fleming were adopted. Using this demarcation puts portions of Western Europe, Africa and eastern Russia in the Western Hemisphere, thereby diluting its usefulness as a geopolitical construct, since all of Eurasia and Africa are typically included in the Eastern Hemisphere. Consequently, the meridians of 20°W and the diametrically opposed 160°E are often used, which includes all of the European and African mainlands, but also includes {{a small portion of}} northeast Greenland (typically reckoned as part of North America) and excludes more of eastern Russia and Oceania (e.g., New Zealand). Prior to the global adoption of standard time, numerous prime meridians were decreed by various countries where time was defined by local noon (thereby, local meridian).|$|E
