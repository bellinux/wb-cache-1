5|$|The {{mouse cursor}} helps to provide visual cues for player actions and movement. The cursor {{appears as a}} hand that changes {{depending}} on what the player is hovering the cursor over. For example, to move in a direction, the cursor changes to point in the intended direction. If players can view an item in greater detail, the cursor changes to a hand holding a magnifying glass. By clicking <b>and</b> <b>dragging</b> the cursor, the player performs actions such as pushing, pulling, and tapping items.|$|E
5|$|Having {{learned the}} truth about Dexter's identity, Arthur (John Lithgow) confronts Dexter (Michael C. Hall) at the police station, where nobody else knows Arthur is the Trinity Killer. He warns Dexter to leave him alone from now on. When he leaves, Dexter follows Arthur in his car, and accidentally strikes another car on his way. Dexter follows Arthur to a bank, where he sees Arthur bring a large {{envelope}} back to his van. Dexter attacks Arthur, knocking him out <b>and</b> <b>dragging</b> him into the van, and Dexter realizes the envelope is filled with cash. Dexter plans to take Arthur's van away and kill Arthur, but he spots {{the driver of the}} car he struck earlier talking to police officers next to Dexter's car. Dexter hides the envelope and confronts the driver, who acts very irritable. A frustrated Dexter attacks him and is detained by the police. By the time he is released, Arthur is gone, but Dexter recovers the envelope of money.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The added mass, <b>drag</b> <b>and</b> <b>drag</b> {{coefficient}} of a uniform and accelerated motion projectile in viscous incompressible fluid were calculated by numerical simulation and dynamic mesh method. The effect of velocity and acceleration was investigated. The {{results show that}} the variation rules of added mass, <b>drag</b> <b>and</b> <b>drag</b> coefficient are basically the same when the projectile moves at different speeds. The added mass, <b>drag</b> <b>and</b> <b>drag</b> coefficient become smaller <b>and</b> <b>drag</b> becomes bigger with the increase of speed. The variation rules of the added mass, <b>drag</b> <b>and</b> <b>drag</b> coefficient are the same as uniform motion when the projectile moves at different accelerations. The added mass <b>and</b> <b>drag</b> coefficient become smaller <b>and</b> <b>drag</b> becomes bigger with the increase of acceleration. These reveal that the motion region, velocity and acceleration have some effect on the added mass, <b>drag</b> <b>and</b> <b>drag</b> coefficient...|$|R

5|$|Trains {{passing through}} Baltimore {{at that time}} could not proceed {{directly}} through the city without stopping. Southbound trains were decoupled at President Street Station {{on the east side}} of the city. Cars were drawn individually along rails on Pratt Street by horsepower to Camden Station on the west side of Baltimore’s Inner Harbor, where the trains were reassembled. The initial cars encountered little resistance but soon a growing crowd of Baltimore citizens became increasingly agitated by the passing transports filled with troops. The crowd attacked the car carrying Company K with stones and bricks and derailed it by placing obstructions on the tracks. Railroad company workers managed to put the car back on track and Company K was the seventh and last company to reach Camden Station by rail. The crowd barricaded the rails by dumping cartloads of sand <b>and</b> <b>dragging</b> anchors from the nearby docks across them thus preventing further cars from passing.|$|E

The stag <b>and</b> <b>drag</b> party could include food, drink, games, music, dancing, bonfire and other fun activities. Guests could be offered memorabilia such as an engraved cup with the couple's names and wedding date.|$|R

25|$|The {{scanning}} tunneling microscope {{can remove}} SAM molecules in many different ways. The first is to remove them mechanically by dragging the tip across the substrate surface. This {{is not the most}} desired technique as these tips are expensive <b>and</b> <b>dragging</b> them causes a lot of wear and reduction of the tip quality. The second way is to degrade or desorb the SAM molecules by shooting them with an electron beam. The {{scanning tunneling microscope}} can also remove SAMs by field desorption and field enhanced surface diffusion.|$|E

40|$|The {{calculation}} {{and analysis}} of torque <b>and</b> <b>drag</b> {{play an important role}} in drilling and well design. Different models (soft, stiffness, mixed and finite element) have been used to calculate the torque <b>and</b> <b>drag.</b> This paper introduces a practical FEA (Finite Element Analysis) model of the drill string which can reflect working behavior, including interaction between the drillstring and borehole wall, computational model of torque <b>and</b> <b>drag,</b> <b>and</b> verification with examples. The sensitivity analysis to some key input and output parameters has been conducted. The calculated hook load shows a good match to the rig recorded values. The drillstring displacements calculated by the FEA model matches those from an analytical method. The program developed and discussed in this paper can be used for torque <b>and</b> <b>drag</b> analysis, dynamic behavior analysis, and friction coefficient back-calculation. The FEA program of the drillstring presented herein will benefit in preplanning and real-time simulation of oil and gas well drilling operations. </p...|$|R
25|$|Based on {{what little}} has survived of the account, {{it seems that}} the legend begins with the Kur abducting the goddess, Ereshkigal, <b>and</b> <b>dragging</b> her down to the Netherworld.

The Kur is described as defending itself using a storm of hailstones of all sizes and by attacking Enki using the waters beneath the boat. The account never actually tells who the winner of the fight is, but it can probably be assumed that Enki is the ultimate victor.|$|E

Dionysius then commenced his assault on Motya, which fell despite stubborn resistance. Dionysius sacked the city, garrisoned the ruins and, keeping Segesta and Entella under siege, returned to Syracuse with most of his fleet and army for the winter. His brother Leptines of Syracuse kept 120 ships at Eryx, including at least thirty quinqueremes.|$|E

All over Paris they talked about this burly Englishman who had ridden 160km in 4 hours and 6 minutes: and when it came to it, he was hammered by a 19-year-old, but a teenager with a will of iron that was to prove inflexible for the next 19 years.|$|E

Their attempt by what is now the normal route, the Hörnli ridge, met with success on 14 July 1865, only days before an Italian party.
