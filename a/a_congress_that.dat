It was the first time a round table was used in international politics.|$|E
25|$|For {{a number}} of years the Socialists and Communists fought for control of {{organized}} labor. In 1940 groups under both Socialist and Communist influence established the “Organización Sindical”, which 5 years later, on 14 August 1945, sponsored <b>a</b> <b>congress</b> <b>that</b> established the country's first central labor group, the Trade Union Federation of Workers of Panama (Federación Sindical de Trabajadores de Panamá, FSTP). It remained united until 1948, when the rival General Union of Workers (Unión General de Trabajadores) was created under Socialist leadership, after losing control of the FSTP to the Communists.|$|E
25|$|Allies of Adams {{lost control}} of Congress after the 1826 mid-term elections, and pro-Adams Speaker of the House John Taylor was {{replaced}} by Andrew Stevenson, a Jackson supporter. Adams himself noted that the U.S. had never before seen <b>a</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>that</b> was firmly {{under the control of}} political opponents of the president. Jacksonian Congressmen lobbied numerous attacks against Adams, including attacks on Adams's actions at Ghent and criticism of White House expenditures such as the purchase of a pool table. Jacksonians devised the Tariff of 1828, which raised tariffs considerably. Adams and Clay both supported a high tariff, and Adams signed the bill. After signing the tariff, Adams was denounced in the South, but he received little credit for the tariff in the North. The high tariff rates would eventually lead to the Nullification Crisis of the 1830s.|$|E

2500|$|Collier's {{dream was}} to not only {{preserve}} Indian culture but also to hold it up {{as a model for}} white society. Historian T. H. Watkins comments that this was [...] "rather a lot to ask of a people struggling merely to live on the fringe of civilization that had overwhelmed them; it was even more to ask acceptance of such notions from <b>a</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>that</b> had demonstrated little faith in the belief that white civilization had anything much to learn from the Indians." ...|$|E
2500|$|Henry {{and other}} anti-federalists hoped to elect <b>a</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>that</b> would amend the Constitution {{to take away}} most of the powers it had been granted ("commit suicide on [...] own authority," [...] as Madison put it). Henry {{recruited}} Monroe to run against Madison for a House seat in the First Congress, {{and he had the}} Virginia legislature draw a congressional district designed to elect Monroe. During the campaign, Madison and Monroe often traveled together, and the election did not destroy their friendship. Madison prevailed over Monroe, taking 1,308 votes compared to Monroe's 972 votes. Following his defeat, Monroe returned to his legal duties and developed his farm in Charlottesville. After the death of Senator William Grayson in 1790, Monroe was elected to serve the remainder of Grayson's term.|$|E
2500|$|On October 14, Clark was {{referred}} to as the [...] "father of the idea of annexation of Delaware County to Philadelphia" [...] by Milliken. Finally, the Democrats were moved to respond in a fury. Upper Darby Democratic chairman Joseph J. Helyenek charged that the county GOP was attempting to set up [...] "an unjust and filthy equation: Democratic victory means annexation... annexation means invasion (of the suburbs) by hordes of unwelcome colored people." [...] Continuing the low-blows of the campaign, VanZandt spoke at the Young Republican annual picnic at the Springfield Country Club, calling Senator Clark [...] "a left-winger, soft on Cuba, Red China and Communism". [...] Clark responded: [...] "This {{is the first time in}} Pennsylvania political history that the red smear has been used as a major issue in a statewide campaign." [...] He urged voters to elect Democrats [...] "to give President Kennedy <b>a</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>that</b> will help him, not hamstring him." ...|$|E

2500|$|The rough-and-tumble {{world of}} legislating is not orderly and civil, human frailties too often taint its membership, and {{legislative}} outcomes are often frustrating and ineffective ... Still, {{we are not}} exaggerating when we say that Congress is essential to American democracy. We would not have survived as a nation without <b>a</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>that</b> represented the diverse interests of our society, conducted a public debate on the major issues, found compromises to resolve conflicts peacefully, and limited the power of our executive, military, and judicial institutions ... The popularity of Congress ebbs and flows with the public's confidence in government generally ... the legislative process is easy to dislike—it often generates political posturing and grandstanding, it necessarily involves compromise, and it often leaves broken promises in its trail. Also, members of Congress often appear self-serving as they pursue their political careers and represent interests and reflect values that are controversial. Scandals, even when they involve a single member, add to the public's frustration with Congress and {{have contributed to the}} institution's low ratings in opinion polls.—Smith, Roberts & Wielen ...|$|E

The armies of Europe cost two billions a year now--I will replace them all for a billion. I will dig up the trained statesmen of all ages and all climes, and furnish this country with <b>a</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>that</b> knows enough to come in out of the rain-- a thing that's never happened yet, since the Declaration of Independence, and never will happen till these practically dead people are replaced with the genuine article. I will restock the thrones of Europe with the best brains and the best morals that all the royal sepulchres of all the centuries can furnish--which isn't promising very much--and I'll divide the wages and the civil list, fair and square, merely taking my half and--" ...|$|E
6000|$|Now {{can there}} be any {{difficulty}} in understanding this? To you Democrats it {{may not seem like}} principle; but surely you cannot fail to perceive the position plainly enough. The distinction between it and the position of your candidate is broad and obvious, and I admit you have a clear right to show it is wrong if you can; but you have no right to pretend you cannot see it at all. We see it, and to us it appears like principle, and the best sort of principle at that--the principle of allowing the people to do as they please with their own business. My friend from Indiana (C. B. Smith) has aptly asked, [...] "Are you willing to trust the people?" [...] Some of you answered substantially, [...] "We are willing to trust the people; but the President is as much the representative of the people as Congress." [...] In a certain sense, and to a certain extent, he is the representative of the people. He is elected by them, as well as Congress is; but can he, in the nature of things know the wants of the people as well as three hundred other men, coming from all the various localities of the nation? If so, where is the propriety of having <b>a</b> <b>Congress?</b> <b>That</b> the Constitution gives the President a negative on legislation, all know; but that this negative should be so combined with platforms and other appliances as to enable him, and in fact almost compel him, to take the whole of legislation into his own hands, is what we object to, is what General Taylor objects to, and is what constitutes the broad distinction between you and us. To thus transfer legislation is clearly to take it from those who understand with minuteness the interests of the people, and give it to one who does not and cannot so well understand it. I understand your idea that if a Presidential candidate avow his opinion upon a given question, or rather upon all questions, and the people, with full knowledge of this, elect him, they thereby distinctly approve all those opinions. By means of it, measures are adopted or rejected contrary to the wishes of the whole of one party, and often nearly half of the other. Three, four, or half a dozen questions are prominent at a given time; the party selects its candidate, and he takes his position on each of these questions. On all but one his positions have already been indorsed at former elections, and his party fully committed to them; but that one is new, and a large portion of them are against it. But what are they to do? The whole was strung together; and they must take all, or reject all. They cannot take what they like, and leave the rest. What they are already committed to being the majority, they shut their eyes, and gulp the whole. Next election, still another is introduced in the same way. If we run our eyes along the line of the past, we shall see that almost if not quite all the articles of the present Democratic creed have been at first forced upon the party in this very way. And just now, and just so, opposition to internal improvements is to be established if General Cass shall be elected. Almost half the Democrats here are for improvements; but they will vote for Cass, and if he succeeds, their vote will have aided in closing the doors against improvements. Now this is a process which we think is wrong. We prefer a candidate who, like General Taylor, will allow the people to have their own way, regardless of his private opinions; and I should think the internal-improvement Democrats, at least, ought to prefer such a candidate. He would force nothing on them which they don't want, and he would allow them to have improvements which their own candidate, if elected, will not.|$|E
