5000|$|The Tribals {{were the}} first modern RN ships {{designed}} to {{use a combination of}} power sources, a feature which had been trialled with limited success in the 1930s in the minelayer [...] An <b>additive</b> <b>mix</b> of steam and gas turbine called [...] "COmbined Steam and Gas" [...] COSAG was used. This gave the rapid start-up and acceleration of a gas turbine engine coupled with the cruising efficiency and reliability of the steam turbine. They would cruise on the steam plant and use both systems driving the same shaft for a high-speed [...] "boost". They suffered however from being single-shaft vessels which severely limited manoeuvrability, acceleration and deceleration. The single screw proved significantly limiting when they were used in the 1970s Cod Wars in terms of manoeuvering in ramming manoeuvers, for and against, Icelandic coast guard cutters. The cramped awkward nature of the helicopter pad and handling provision was also exposed in the 1976 Cod War and was a major reason that some s were given further refits in preference to the Tribals and maintained in higher status reserve in the early 1980s limitations on defence spending.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Ambulatory ECG {{monitoring}} (AECG) {{is increasingly}} for the patients suffering from cardiac disorders. Ambulatory monitoring has {{an advantage over}} the indoor monitoring that the patients can perform their daily routine activities. The major difficulty with ambulatory ECG monitoring is that the ECG signals are contaminated by motion artifact introduced due to physical activity (PA) of the patient. The AECG during commonplace PA is presumed to be an <b>additive</b> <b>mix</b> of signals due to cardiac activities, motion artifacts. Based on this fact, AECG is analysed to yield some information regarding the PA. This {{can be used for}} accurate interpretation of the AECG and hence can increase the utility of ambulatory cardiac monitoring.

The challenge presently is that the ECG signal is influenced by motion artifacts induced by body movement activity (BMA) of the wearer. The usual practice is to develop effective filtering algorithms which will eliminate artifacts. Instead, {{our goal is to}} detect the motion artifacts and classify the type of BMA from the ECG signal itself. We have recorded the ECG signals during specified BMAs, e. g., sitting still, walking, movements of arms and climbing stairs, etc. with a single-lead system. The collected ECG signal during BMA is presumed to be an <b>additive</b> <b>mix</b> of signals due to cardiac activities, motion artifacts and sensor noise. A particular class of BMA is characterized by applying eigen decomposition on the corresponding ECG data. The classification accuracies range from 70 % to 98 % for various class combinations of BMAs depending on their uniqueness based on this technique. The above classification is also useful for analysis of P and T waves in the presence of BMA. IEE...|$|E

In this paper, we apply a method called Morphological Component Analysis (MCA) for sparse signal separation {{with the objective}} of reducing such clutter artifacts. The MCA approach assumes that the two signals in the <b>additive</b> <b>mix</b> have each a sparse representation under some dictionary of atoms (a matrix), and separation is achieved by finding these sparse representations. In our work, an adaptive approach is used for learning the dictionary from the echo data. MCA is compared to Singular Value Filtering (SVF), a Principal Component Analysis- (PCA-) based filtering technique, and to a high-pass Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter. Each filter is applied to a simulated hypoechoic lesion sequence, as well as experimental cardiac ultrasound data. MCA is demonstrated in both cases to outperform the FIR filter and obtain results comparable to the SVF method in terms of contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). Furthermore, MCA shows a lower impact on tissue sections while removing the clutter artifacts.

40|$|Corrosion of {{reinforcing}} steel {{is the primary}} cause of deterioration of concrete exposed to seawater (Ash Development Association 2000). Chloride is the most aggressive of these ions when it penetrates the cement matrix (Barberona et al. 2005). The purpose of this thesis was to design a cement additive that would improve concrete’s resistance to chloride attack. The design additive was made from diatomaceous earth, gamma alumina and hydrated lime, which theoretically reduces the permeability of cement and increases chloride binding by producing additional C-S-H and Friedel’s salt. The properties of two mass ratio variations of the cement <b>additive</b> <b>mix</b> were compared to the properties of a mix with fly ash as an additive and portland cement with no cement additive replacement. The results {{of this study indicate that}} gamma alumina and diatomaceous earth have opposing optimum chloride exposure times from the initial casting of concrete. Therefore, the combination of gamma alumina, diatomaceous earth and lime is not a viable cement additive for the prevention of chloride movement though concrete. However, the individual materials may be suitable for improving the chloride resistance of concrete for particular situations in marine environments, such as gamma alumina for in-situ reinforced concrete and diatomaceous earth for pre cast concrete.

In this respect organoleptic analyzes were performed on appearance (exterior and section), color, smell, texture and taste of the finished product (after roasting), the results highlighting that, in terms of organoleptic, sample 1 obtained the highest score (on a scale of 1 -poor to 5 -very good quality) (average 21. 83), followed by sample 3 (average 19. 22), the very small difference {{in the case of}} sample 2 (average 19. 19) and finally, sample 4 (average 18. 75). It was noted that sample 1 obtained the highest score (average) of all analyzed organoleptic indicators: appearance (4. 33), color (4. 39), smell (4. 67), texture (4. 33) and taste (4. 11) being favorite by all volunteer subjects who participated at the analysis. The same thing was found in sensory analysis of mici paste in fresh/chilled condition: 65 % of subjects preferred variant 1 followed by variant 3 (19. 2 %), variant 2 (11. 5 %) and finally, variant 4 (3. 8 %). In terms of economic the highest efficiency was found in 2 (specific consumption 0. 73) and 4 (specific consumption 0. 77) variants compared to 1 (specific consumption 0. 80) and 3 (specific consumption 0. 82) variants, which translates into a reduction in the cost of products manufactured in the variants 2 and 4 (with protein supplements and <b>additive</b> <b>mix)</b> by about 25 - 20 % (with importance for the manufacturer).

40|$|For {{about four}} decades, {{radioactive}} wastes {{have been collected}} and calcined from nuclear fuels reprocessing at the Idaho Nuclear Technology and Engineering Center (INTEC), formerly Idaho Chemical Processing Plant (ICPP). Over this time span, secondary radioactive wastes have also been collected and stored as liquid from decontamination, laboratory activities, and fuel-storage activities. These liquid wastes are collectively called sodium-bearing wastes (SBW). About 5. 7 million liters of these wastes are temporarily stored in stainless steel tanks at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL). Vitrification is being considered as an immobilization step for SBW {{with a number of}} treatment and disposal options. A systematic study was undertaken to develop a glass composition to demonstrate direct vitrification of INEEL's SBW. The objectives of this study were to show the feasibility of SBW vitrification, not a development of an optimum formulation. The waste composition is relatively high in sodium, aluminum, and sulfur. A specific composition and glass property restrictions, discussed in Section 2, were used as a basis for the development. Calculations based on first-order expansions of selected glass properties in composition and some general tenets of glass chemistry led to an additive (fit) composition (68. 69 mass % SiO{sub 2 }, 14. 26 mass% B{sub 2 }O{sub 3 }, 11. 31 mass% Fe{sub 2 }O{sub 3 }, 3. 08 mass% TiO{sub 2 }, and 2. 67 mass % Li{sub 2 }O) that meets all property restrictions when melted with 35 mass % of SBW on an oxide basis, The glass was prepared using oxides, carbonates, and boric acid and tested to confirm the acceptability of its properties. Glass was then made using waste simulant at three facilities, and limited testing was performed to test and optimize processing-related properties and confirm results of glass property testing. The measured glass properties are given in Section 4. The viscosity at 1150 C, 5 Pa{center_dot}s, is nearly ideal for waste-glass processing in a standard liquid-fed joule-heated melter. The normalized elemental releases by 7 -day PCT are all well below 1 g/m{sup 2 }, which is a very conservative set point used in this study. The T{sub L}, ignoring sulfate formation, is less than the 1050 C limit. Based on these observations and the reasonable waste loading of 35 mass 0 / 0, the SBW glass was a prime candidate for further testing. Sulfate salt segregation was observed in all test melts formed from oxidized carbonate precursors. Melts fabricated using SBW simulants suggest that the sulfate-salt segregation seen in oxide and carbonate melts was much less of a problem. The cause for the difference is likely H{sub 2 }SO{sub 4 } fuming during the boil-down stage of wet-slurry processing. Additionally, some crucible tests with SBW simulant were conducted at higher temperatures (1250 C), which could increase the volatility of sulfate salts. The fate of sulfate during the melting process is still uncertain and should be the topic of future studies. The properties of the simulant glass confirmed those of the oxide and carbonate glass. Corrosion tests on Inconel 690 electrodes and K- 3 refractory blocks conducted at INEEL suggest that the glass is not excessively corrosive. Based on the results of this study, the authors recommend that a glass made of 35 % SBW simulant (on a mass oxide and halide basis) and 65 % of the <b>additive</b> <b>mix</b> (either filled or raw chemical) be used in demonstrating the direct vitrification of INEEL SBW. It is further recommended that a study be conducted to determine the fate of sulfate during glass processing and the tolerance of the chosen melter technology to sulfate salt segregation and corrosivity of the melt...|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} {{the problem of}} estimating a high-dimensional <b>additive</b> <b>mixed</b> model for longitudinal data using sparse methods. In this problem, multiple measurements are made on the same subject across time, and then the different sources of variability (intra- and inter-subject variability) and correlation within subjects have to be considered. Also, the relationships between explanatory variables and the outcome arepossibly non linear. In addition, the number of explanatory variables could be larger than the sample size but only a small set of explanatory variables contribute to the response. Several computational approaches for high-dimensional additive modelling for independent data have been developed in the literature. Recently, Amato and colleagues (Stat Methods Appl 2016; s 10260 - 016 - 0357 - 8) conducted {{a comprehensive review of}} these methods. Efficient regularized estimation procedures for variable selection in nonparametric additive models use basis function approximations.

A high-dimensional dissipative nonlinear dynamical system is distributed between transmitter and receiver. The transmitter dynamics is public (known to all) and the receiver dynamics is private (known only to the authorized receiver). Bidirectional signals that couple transmitter and receiver are transmitted over a public channel. Once the chaotic dynamics which is initialized with a random state converges to the attractor, a message is mixed with the chaotic dynamics at the transmitter. The authorized receiver who knows the entire dynamics can use a simple algorithm to decode the message. An unauthorized receiver does not know the receiver dynamics and needs to use computationally unfeasible algorithms in order to decode the message. Security is maintained by altering the private receiver dynamics during transmission. We show that using <b>additive</b> <b>mixing</b> modulation is more efficient than the attractor position modulation distributed dynamics encryption scheme.
