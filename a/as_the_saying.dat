George Cottington, {{a former employee}} of Calvert, suggested in 1628 that Calvert's conversion had been in progress {{a long time before}} it was made public. George Abbot (1562–1633), the reigning Archbishop of Canterbury (and ecclesiastical head of the independent Church of England), reported that political opposition to Calvert, combined with his loss of office, had [...] "made him discontented and, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>saying</b> is, [...] "Desperatio facit monachum", so hee apparently did turne papist, which hee now professeth, this being the third time that he hath bene to blame that way [...] ". Godfrey Goodman, the Bishop of Gloucester, later claimed Calvert had been a secret Catholic all along ("infinitely addicted to the Catholic faith"), which explained his support for lenient policies towards Catholics and for the Spanish match.|$|E

He disdained philosophy and philosophers, and looked down on Marcus' sessions with Apollonius of Chalcedon and others in this circle. Fronto put an uncharitable interpretation of Marcus' [...] "conversion to philosophy": [...] "in the fashion of the young, tired of boring work", Marcus had turned to philosophy to escape the constant exercises of oratorical training. Marcus kept in close touch with Fronto, but he would ignore his scruples.|$|E
2500|$|This phrase {{evokes the}} {{primordial}} swamp and the Nqaul tree which grew within the original swamp.

Whilst some Serer sources postulates that the Saas was the first tree on Earth, the Serer oral tradition states that the Saas was not Nqual (the original tree in the swamp). Instead, Saas is attributed to one of the sacred trees useful for overall-bodily health. Another sacred tree − the Nquƭ, is also thought to have been the first tree. However, the general consensus is that the Nquƭ which has the properties to cure snakebite grew on the river bank whilst Nqual grew inside the primordial swamp.|$|E
2500|$|A Second Balkan War erupted, {{in which}} Romania joined the {{regional}} coalition against Bulgaria and occupied all the Dobrujan South. While the Maiorescu administration prepared the Peace of Bucharest, and after failed {{efforts to make}} himself obeyed by fellow Conservatives, Carp presented his resignation to Ioan Lahovary, head of the Bucharest Conservative Club. This time around, it was accepted. In one of his letters, Negruzzi discussed how Carp braved his political isolation with jokes and wit, but noted: [...] "Only he knows how it really feels deep down. [...] <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>saying</b> goes: a man will do things to himself that the devil will not even venture to attempt." [...] At the time, Carp's son Grigore was also coming under attack from the political opposition.

2500|$|A {{propensity}} {{theory of}} probability was given by Charles Sanders Peirce. A later propensity theory was proposed by philosopher Karl Popper, who had only slight acquaintance with the writings of C.S. Peirce, however. Popper noted that {{the outcome of a}} physical experiment is produced by a certain set of [...] "generating conditions". [...] When we repeat an experiment, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>saying</b> goes, we really perform another experiment with a (more or less) similar set of generating conditions. [...] To say that a set of generating conditions has propensity p of producing the outcome E means that those exact conditions, if repeated indefinitely, would produce an outcome sequence in which E occurred with limiting relative frequency p. [...] For Popper then, a deterministic experiment would have propensity 0 or 1 for each outcome, since those generating conditions would have same outcome on each trial. [...] In other words, non-trivial propensities (those that differ from 0 and 1) only exist for genuinely indeterministic experiments.|$|E
2500|$|The {{tradition}} of giving thanks to God is continued today in many forms, {{most notably the}} attendance of religious services, as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>saying</b> of a mealtime prayer before Thanksgiving dinner. Many houses of worship offer worship services and events on Thanksgiving themes the weekend before, the day of, or the weekend after Thanksgiving. At home, it is a holiday tradition in many families to begin the Thanksgiving dinner by saying grace (a prayer before or after a meal). The custom is portrayed in the photograph [...] "Family Holding Hands and Praying Before a Thanksgiving Meal". Before praying, {{it is a common}} practice at the dining table for [...] "each person [...] tell one specific reason they're thankful to God that year." [...] While grace is said, many families hold hands until the prayer concludes, often indicated with an [...] "Amen". Traditionally, grace was led by the hostess or host, though in later times it is usual for others to contribute.|$|E

2500|$|The Lisu are {{believed}} to have originated in eastern Tibet even before present Tibetans arrived in the plateau. Research done by Lisu scholars indicates that they moved to northwestern Yunnan. They inhabited a region across Baoshan and the Tengchong plain for thousands of years. Lisu, Yi, Lahu, and Akha are Tibetan–Burman languages, distantly related to Burmese and Tibetan. After the Han Chinese Ming Dynasty, around 1140-1644 CE the eastern and southern Lisu languages and culture were greatly influenced by the Han culture. Taiping village in Yinjiang, Yunnan, China, was first established by Lu Shi Lisu people about 1,000 years ago. In the mid-18th century, Lisu peoples in Yinjiang began moving into Momeik, Burma, a population of southern Lisu moved into Mogok, and southern Shan State, and then in the late 19th century, moved into northern Thailand. Lisu is one of the three Lolo tribes, the descendants of Yi. Yi (or Nuosu) are still much closer to the Lisu and Myanmar languages. Myat Wai Toe observes that <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>saying,</b> “the Headwaters of the Great River, Lisu originates,” where Lisu lived in “Mou-Ku-De” they were not yet called “Lisu” until 400-200 BC.|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{establishment}} of the Ui Fidgenti circa 377 a.d., there were few significant changes in political control until the arrival of the Vikings in the 9th century, which ultimately brought about {{the establishment}} of the city on an island on the River Shannon in 922. The death of Domnall Mór Ua Briain, King of Munster in 1194 resulted in the invading Normans taking control of Limerick, and in 1210, the County of Limerick was formally established as Ui Fidgenti lands were granted to what would become the Fitzgerald dynasty. [...] Over time, the Normans became [...] "more Irish than the Irish themselves" [...] <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>saying</b> goes. The Tudors in England wanted to curb the power of these Gaelicised Norman Rulers and centralise all power in their hands, so they established colonies of English in the county. Distrust by England of the leading Fitzgerald families, and the execution of the several of the Fitzgeralds of Kildare, precipitated a revolt against English Rule in 1569. Th resultant savage war in Munster, known as the Desmond Rebellions, laid waste to the province, and ended with confiscation of the vast estates of the Geraldines and other Irish families that had participated in the ten years of war.|$|E
