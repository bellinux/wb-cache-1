Three of them preserve the DSSS approach: in the 868/915 MHz bands, using either binary or offset quadrature phase shift keying (the second of which is optional); in the 2450 MHz band, using the latter.

40|$|We {{theoretically}} and experimentally {{examine the}} effects of anharmonic terms in the trapping potential for linear chains of trapped ions. We concentrate on two different effects that become significant at different levels of anharmonicity. The first is a modification of the oscillation frequencies and amplitudes of the ions' normal modes of vibration for multi-ion crystals, resulting from each ion experiencing a different curvature in the potential. In the second effect, which occurs with increased anharmonicity or higher excitation <b>amplitude,</b> amplitude-dependent <b>shifts</b> of the normal-mode frequencies become important. We evaluate normal-mode frequency and <b>amplitude</b> <b>shifts,</b> and comment on the implications for quantum information processing and quantum state engineering. Since the ratio of the anharmonic to harmonic terms typically increases as the ion [...] electrode distance decreases, anharmonic effects will become more significant as ion trap sizes are reduced. To avoid unwanted problems, anharmonicities should therefore be taken into account at the design stage of trap development. Comment: 26 pages, 7 figure...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{results are}} {{presented}} on chaotic vibrations of a rectangular plate with an in-plane elastic constraint. Opposite edges of the plate are clamped and the other edges are simply supported. One of the clamped edges is connected with elastic springs and is movable to an in-plane direction. The simply-supported edges are composed with adhesive elastic thin films. Under the specified in-plane compressive force, the plate shows the type of a softening-and-hardening spring. Moreover, the plate has {{the condition of the}} two to three internal resonance between the second and third modes. Under periodic lateral excitation, non-periodic responses are obtained in specific frequency regions. The non-periodic responses are examined with the Fourier spectra, the Poincare projections and the maximum Lyapunov exponents. It is found that two types of chaotic responses are generated from the internal resonances dominated by the first mode and higher modes of vibration. Appying the Karhunen Loeve method, contributions of vibration modes on the chaotic responses are confirmed. The first mode contributes to the chaotic responses dominantly. The higher three modes including the second, third and fourth modes have 10 to 20 percent of contribution. As exciting amplitude increases, the lower frequency region of chaotic response with large <b>amplitude</b> <b>shifts</b> to the higher frequency range owing to the hardening nonlinearity of the plate, while the higher region of chaotic response with small <b>amplitude</b> <b>shifts</b> to the lower frequency range...|$|R

40|$|We study n-pulse {{interaction}} in fast collisions of N solitons of the cubic nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) equation {{in the presence}} of generic weak nonlinear loss. We develop a reduced model that yields the contribution of n-pulse interaction to the <b>amplitude</b> <b>shift</b> for collisions {{in the presence of}} weak (2 m+ 1) -order loss, for any n and m. We first employ the reduced model and numerical solution of the perturbed NLS equation to analyze soliton collisions in the presence of septic loss (m= 3). Our calculations show that three-pulse interaction gives the dominant contribution to the collision-induced <b>amplitude</b> <b>shift</b> already in a full-overlap four-soliton collision, and that the <b>amplitude</b> <b>shift</b> strongly depends on the initial soliton positions. We then extend these results for a generic weak nonlinear loss of the form G(|ψ|^ 2) ψ, where ψ is the physical field and G is a Taylor polynomial of degree m_c. Considering m_c= 3, as an example, we show that three-pulse interaction gives the dominant contribution to the <b>amplitude</b> <b>shift</b> in a six-soliton collision, despite the presence of low-order loss. Our study quantitatively demonstrates that n-pulse interaction with high n values {{plays a key role in}} fast collisions of NLS solitons in the presence of generic nonlinear loss. Moreover, the scalings of n-pulse interaction effects with n and m and the strong dependence on initial soliton positions lead to complex collision dynamics, which is very different from the one observed in fast NLS soliton collisions in the presence of cubic loss.

The proposed RF-I system exploits the simple architecture {{and characteristics of}} noncoherent ASK modulation. This provides an efficient way of increasing interconnect bandwidth by transmitting an RF-modulated data stream simultaneously with a conventional baseband counterpart over a shared off-chip transmission line. Both analysis and tested results prove that {{the performance of the}} proposed dual-band (RF+baseband) interconnect system is not limited by thermal noise interference. Therefore, a more sophisticated modulation scheme and/or coherent receiving scheme becomes unnecessary within the scope of system requirements. In addition, it confirms that the proposed inductive coupling network is able to support simultaneous bidirectional communications without using complicated replica circuits or additional filters to isolate simultaneous baseband and RF-band data streams.
