40|$|Econea®, or 4 -bromo- 2 -(4 -chlorophenyl) - 5 -(trifluoromethyl) - 1 H-pyrrole- 3 -carbonitrile, is a {{new type}} of {{environmentally}} friendly <b>anti-fouling</b> <b>compound</b> used in the immersed coatings of commercial sea going vessels. This paper reports {{the development of a new}} analytical method to directly detect the active biocide Econea® in an artificial sea water matrix using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. The developed method is both rapid and sensitive, with a limit of detection of 0. 05 μg/L and a limit of quantitation of 0. 17 μg/L in artificial seawater. The subsequent developed method was then applied to investigate the biocide’s release from a commercially available Econea® containing paint immersed in artificial sea water over a 45 -day period. It was found that the average release rate of Econea® from this paint was 4. 3 ± 0. 6 μg cm− 2 d− 1...|$|E

50|$|Like other corals, the polyps of Parazoanthus parasiticus {{extend their}} tentacles {{to feed on}} zooplankton. It is {{probable}} that the coral benefits from {{the flow of water}} {{into and out of the}} sponge which increases the number of food particles coming within its reach. The sponge is a filter feeder and feeds on the bacteria and dissolved organic matter it removes from the water passing through its tissues. The presence of the coral obstructs the inflow of water. Some sponges produce <b>anti-fouling</b> <b>compounds</b> which they release into the surrounding water to try to prevent other organisms colonizing their surface. Nevertheless, an ongoing study of sponges colonized by zoanthid corals showed positive benefits to the sponge in growth and survival rates so the association seems to be mutualistic.|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} the potential antilarval and antibacterial activity of secondary metabolites of the gorgonians Subergorgia suberosa and Scripearia gracillis from the South China Sea. Fresh specimens {{of these two}} gorgonian corals were collected from a shallow reef in Sanya Bay of Hainan Island and extracted with different solvents. Antilarval activity of the chemical extracts and pure compounds was evaluated in settlement inhibition assays with laboratory-reared Balanus amphitrite and Bugula neritina larvae, while antibacterial activity was assessed with disc diffusion bioassay on growth inhibition of 15 marine bacterial species. Using bioassay-guided procedures, we purified and identified nine compounds. The most potent metabolites produced by these gorgonian corals were subergorgic acid and pregn- 4 -ene- 3, 20 -dione extracted from S. suberosa. Our {{results show that the}} gorgonian coral S. suberosa and S. gracillis can produce potent <b>anti-fouling</b> <b>compounds</b> that deserve further exploration...|$|R
40|$|We {{report an}} {{application}} of the Science and Policy Integration for Coastal System Assessment (SPICOSA) Systems Approach Framework (SAF) to Loch Fyne, a fjord in western Scotland. The issue was the potential for conflict between shellfish aquaculture and recreational use for yachting. This was investigated by building an ecological-economic model to simulate: (1) release of modern <b>anti-fouling</b> <b>compounds</b> by recreational boats; (2) dilution of these in the upper layers of the loch by exchange with the sea; (3) their effects on photosynthesis by phytoplankton; (4) the role of phytoplankton (along with non-algal particulate matter) in providing food for mussels; (5) the growth of seeded mussels to harvest, determining (6) the cash input to farms, offset by their costs and allowing (7) the farm revenue to be compared with that from marinas used to berth the yachts. It was concluded from simulations that no noticeable effect on mussel harvest would occur (from this route) for any likely number of yachts berthed in the loch. The application took place in consultation with a local environmental forum and a small reference group of public officials; we reflect {{on it in the}} context of a 3 -component schema for the science-policy interface and changes in the culture of UK science...|$|R
40|$|Macroalgal epiphytic {{communities}} are critical components of marine ecosystems and can drive increased biodiversity. Understanding the epiphytic communities on macroalgae and the mechanisms that algae {{to mitigate the}} impact of epiphytes adds to understanding of the evolution and ecology of these communities. The interaction between the communities and the host also informs our understanding of life history traits, growth and resource allocation strategies of the host algae. I assessed the epiphytic communities {{on a range of}} macroalgae across several sites around the Sydney, NSW region. The type of algal host was the most significant factor in determining both fouling load and epiphytic community composition. The green alga Caulerpa filiformis J. Agardh and the brown alga Dilophus marginatus J. Agardh were selected for further study. Unexpectedly I recorded a decrease in fouling coverage on both D. marginatus and C. filiformis over the period of this study. A decrease in fouling coverage was correlated with warmer local temperatures for D. marginatus, but the inverse was true for C. filiformis. I found that juvenile sporophyte fronds of the heavily fouled D. marginatus were chemically defended against fouling. The efficacy of these defences was significantly less on extracts from fronds with visible sporangia. The in-situ coverage of epiphytic communities on juvenile and reproductive fronds was reflected in the efficacy of the surface extracts, highlighting the importance of ontogeny. Compounds from juvenile D. marginatus fronds should be further investigated as a source of <b>anti-fouling</b> <b>compounds.</b> C. filiformis is heavily defended against herbivory, but I found little evidence that this alga had any chemical defences against fouling. The strong relationship between damage and fouling and the observation of empty fronds adjacent to abscission zones suggests that epiphyte growth is mitigated by blade abandonment. This is the second recorded case of blade abandonment suggests that C. filiformis may engage in protoplasm resorption to recycle resources. This thesis has demonstrated that in situ fouling is a remarkably poor predictor of the presence of chemical defences. Ontogeny and morphology should be considered in designing bioassays to reveal complex defence strategies...|$|R
40|$|Desalination of {{seawater}} is {{an increasingly}} common {{means by which}} nations satisfy demand for water. Desalination {{has a long history}} in the Middle East and Mediterranean, but expanding capacities {{can be found in the}} United States, Europe and Australia. There is therefore increasing global interest in understanding the environmental impacts of desalination plants and their discharges on the marine environment. Here we review environmental, ecological and toxicological research in this arena including monitoring and assessment of water quality and ecological attributes in receiving environments. The greatest environmental and ecological impacts have occurred around older multi-stage flash (MSF) plants discharging to water bodies with little flushing. These discharge scenarios can lead to substantial increases in salinity and temperature, and the accumulation of metals, hydrocarbons and toxic <b>anti-fouling</b> <b>compounds</b> in receiving waters. Experiments in the field and laboratory clearly demonstrate the potential for acute and chronic toxicity, and small-scale alterations to community structure following exposures to environmentally realistic concentrations of desalination brines. A clear consensus across many of the reviewed articles is that discharge site selection is the primary factor that determines the extent of ecological impacts of desalination plants. Ecological monitoring studies have found variable effects ranging from no significant impacts to benthic communities, through to widespread alterations to community structure in seagrass, coral reef and soft-sediment ecosystems when discharges are released to poorly flushed environments. In most other cases environmental effects appear to be limited to within 10 s of meters of outfalls. It must be noted that a large proportion of the published work is descriptive and provides little quantitative data that we could assess independently. Many of the monitoring studies lacked sufficient detail with respect to study design and statistical analyses, making conclusive interpretation of results difficult. It is clear that greater clarity and improved methodologies are required in the assessment of the ecological impacts of desalination plants. It is imperative to employ Before–After, Control-Impact monitoring designs with adequate replication, and multiple independent reference locations to assess potential impacts adequately...|$|R
40|$|Short {{term and}} {{irregular}} sampling in Loch Creran over recent decades suggested that changes may be {{occurring in the}} phytoplankton community in the loch. This study sought to confirm this suggestion. After instigating a regular sampling regime during 2008 and 2009 {{it became clear that}} significant changes had occurred, relative to information from the 1970 s, in both the numbers of phytoplankton in the loch and in their biomass, particularly {{during the time of the}} spring bloom. Utilising a tool to assess change in the phytoplankton community, it also became clear that significant changes had occurred in the composition of the phytoplankton in Loch Creran. Work was undertaken to explore possible explanations behind these changes. The e�ect that toxic, <b>anti-fouling</b> <b>compounds,</b> arising from an increase in leisure boating in Loch Creran, were having on the productivity of phytoplankton in the loch was considered by adapting an existing assimilative capacity model for phytoplankton growth. It was found, that at present levels of boating activity, the concentration of anti-fouling products present in the loch, would not be great enough to significantly impact on phytoplankton growth. Nutrient samples collected during 2009 showed no significant changes in the concentration of silicate or nitrate in the loch, but phosphate levels were found to be significantly lower. A review of the e�ects of grazing on phytoplankton by farmed mussels in Loch Creran indicated that, at current levels, this would not account for the decrease in phytoplankton numbers observed in the loch. Significant changes were observed in the water temperature in the loch and in the intensity and pattern of local rainfall. Increased levels of rainfall in the first three months of the year were found to be high enough to influence the rate of flushing and the rate of phytoplankton washout from the loch. A correlation was found between the availability of light in the surface layers of the loch and the concentration of phytoplankton present in these layers. This correlation was found to exist, throughout the year and not only, as previously thought, during the winter months. In conclusion, the observed decline in phytoplankton numbers in Loch Creran, was attributed to changes in local weather patterns, that had an impact on the physical structure of the water column, washout rates, the pattern and intensity of heterotrophic grazing and the availability of light.
