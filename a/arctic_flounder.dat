50|$|The diet of the <b>Arctic</b> <b>flounder</b> {{consists}} {{mainly of}} small fish and zoobenthos invertebrates such as amphipods, molluscs and marine worms.|$|E
50|$|An {{excellent}} example of transgenic modification is {{in the case of}} cold resistant strawberries. In one particular variety genes from the <b>arctic</b> <b>flounder,</b> a fish that lives in very cold water, were used to give plants resistance to cold. This modification works because of the genetics of the <b>arctic</b> <b>flounder.</b> It lives in water where other fish would freeze to death but, with a special gene that allows it to produce a sort of anti-freeze, it can survive. This gene is put into a bacteria that is sprayed on the strawberry during the freezing temperatures, allowing it to also be resistant to cold. The strawberry is then cleaned, removing the bacteria.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Arctic</b> <b>flounder</b> is a right-eyed flatfish. Its {{upper side}} is dark olive green to dark brown in colour, {{sometimes}} with black spots or dark patches; its underside is white. Its fins are pale brown, sometimes {{with a yellow}} tinge or faint dark spots.|$|E
50|$|The waters around Herschel Island are a {{haven for}} fish and marine mammals. The Mackenzie River flows into the Beaufort Sea {{southeast}} of the island. Its warm, nutrient-rich waters drift westward along the mainland shore as far as Herschel. Zooplankton feed on these nutrients, and are in turn eaten by larger fish, seals, and whales. Arctic cod, Arctic char, Pacific herring and <b>Arctic</b> <b>flounder</b> are all found in this area.|$|E
50|$|In 1991, DNA Plant Technology {{applied for}} and were granted {{permission}} {{to conduct a}} field test permit for their transgenic fish tomato product (tomato; antifreeze gene; staphylococcal Protein A) from the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. This product remains controversial {{in the history of}} biotechnology, because an antifreeze gene isolated from an <b>arctic</b> <b>flounder</b> was transgenically inserted into a tomato in an attempt to create a frost-tolerant tomato. Although this product was tested in a greenhouse, and may have been tested in the field, it was never commercialized.|$|E
50|$|There {{are about}} 400 plant and tree {{species on the}} bay shores, {{including}} birch, willow, alder and plants adapted to salty soils, as well as lyme grass, mosses, and lichens. These serve as food for caribou and rodents, such as lemming. Resident fish species include polar cod, <b>Arctic</b> <b>flounder</b> (Pleuronectidae, Liopsetta), four-horned sculpin and capelin, whereas cod, haddock, herring, halibut, and rattail migrate from the Atlantic. The birds are represented by the little auk, snowy owl, willow ptarmigan, rock ptarmigan, gyrfalcon, Arctic redpoll and guillemots. Most of them migrate to the south during the winter.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Arctic</b> <b>flounder</b> (Liopsetta glacialis) is a {{flatfish}} of {{the family}} Pleuronectidae. It is a demersal fish that lives on coastal mud bottoms in salt, brackish and fresh waters at depths of up to 90 m. Its native habitat is the polar waters of the northeastern Atlantic and Arctic oceans, from the White and Barents seas to the coasts of Siberia in Russia and Queen Maud Gulf in Canada, and from the Chuckchi and Bering seas to Bristol Bay in Alaska and the northern Sea of Okhotsk. It can grow up to 35 cm in length.|$|E
