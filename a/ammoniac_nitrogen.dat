Nitrobacteria are inversely correlated with anaerobic heterotrophic bacteria. The correlation is quite weak between all the nitrite bacteria {{which indicates that}} the nitrite bacteria have a controlling and regulating function in water quality {{and there is no}} interdependence as each plays a role of its own. The paper also discusses how the superficial soil (pond mud down to 3. 5 cm deep) and different layers of the mud affect the biomass of bacteria. The study shows that the top superficial layer (down to 1. 5 cm deep) is the major area for decomposing and converting organic matter...|$|E

40|$|Herein a new {{approach}} of exploiting poultry litter (PL) is demonstrated. The suggested method includes drying of PL with simultaneously striping and recovery of ammonia, followed by the direct combustion of dried PL. The generated ash after the combustion, and the striped ammonia consequently, {{could be used as}} nutrient source for the cultivation of microalgae or cyanobacteria to produce feed additives. The present study explored the application of PL ash and recovered ammonia for the cultivation of Arthrospira platensis and Chlorella vulgaris. For a simultaneously 90 % dissolution of ash potassium and phosphorus, a ratio of acid to ash of 0. 02 mol-H+/g was required.

40|$|Analyzing {{the samples}} of silage {{obtained}} from dairyfarms in different districts of Japan {{and from the}} laboratory, the author investigated into factors that determine the quality of silage; and {{the results obtained on}} the quality of silage in various positions in a silo, the change of quality after the removal of silage from a silo, the relationship between the pH value and the <b>ammoniac</b> <b>nitrogen</b> content, and also the result of appraisal of silage by means of FLIEG'S method are described in this paper. The results are summarized as follows: (1) It is rarely possible to state that the quality of silage is always homogeneous throughout in a silo from the upper to the bottom layers, not to speak of the surface spoilage. On the average, the pH value of silage in the middle portion is lower than that in the outer, although it cannot be stated that the difference is always significant. (2) In winter season, the change of quality of silage is rather little within about a week after the removal of silage from a silo, if the silage is preserved without exposure to air. It is suggested therefore that an amount of silage for a few days use may be removed at a time for the purpose of labor-saving. (3) A significant positive correlation, γ=+ 0. 603, was found between the pH value and the ammonia nitrogen content (p< 0. 001). (4) Examples {{of the results of the}} appraisal by means of FLIEG's method are presented in Table 9.

40|$|Abstract Aim: Current study {{assessed}} {{the influence of}} hydrometric levels on the limnological characteristics of two river floodplain systems in the Ribeira do Iguape Basin (state of São Paulo, Brazil). Methods: Rainfall data were collected dailyfrom an automatic weather station in Jacupiranga SP Brazil and daily hydrometric level records were obtained from automatic linigraphs installed on the two adjacent rivers. Moreover, pH, electrical conductivity and dissolved oxygen were measured by a multiparametric probe. Water samples were collected to analyze nitrate, <b>ammoniac</b> <b>nitrogen,</b> total nitrogen and phosphorus, total alkalinity and suspended material. The samplings were carried out in April and July, representative months for low and high water periods, respectively. Results and Conclusions: Statistical analysis highlighted the “effect of homogenization”, attributed to the hydrological pulses in several studies carried out in river-floodplain systems. This effect in current study was more underscored at Lagoon 2, which remained connected {{for a longer period}} with the adjacent river, when compared to Lagoon 1 - River Jacupiranguinha system. Higher dissolved oxygen concentrations at Lagoon 2, in contrast with the Lagoon 1 featuring anoxia during the whole period under analysis, were also attributed to the above-mentioned greater hydrological connectivity. Current study highlights that the water-mediated transferences during the high water period may contribute not only towards the fertilization of marginal lagoons (inputs of nutrients and organic matter) but also to significant pollutant loads, according to land use along the watersheds. In the case of Lagoon 1 - River Jacupiranguinha system, even though further studies are needed and strongly recommended, {{it is reasonable to assume}} that the discharges of mining effluents into the river may result in ecological damage not only to the receiving water body but also to the connected ecosystems...|$|E

40|$|The sand mining {{activity}} in the São Paulo part of the Paraíba do Sul River Valley started in the 1950 s, {{in the area of}} Jacareí municipality, located in the Southwestern part of the basin. From there, it advanced by the neighboring municipalities, fostered by urbanization and industrialization processes, especially of São Paulo Metropolitan Region. The lack of detailed hydrogeological studies in this area motivated this study that had the objective of verifying the hypothesis that sand mining pits interfere on the quality and storage of the water in the quaternary sedimentary aquifer. This study focused specifically {{in the eastern part of}} the Tremembé Municipality, São Paulo State, in a mining place called “Mineração Paraíso”. The investigation involved infiltration and flow tests, laboratory analyses of soil physical parameters and estimation, water quality indices and infrastructure construction for equipment installation including piezometers, dynamic penetration tests – (SPT - Standard Penetration Test), wells opening and office analyses. The soil physical parameters analyses revealed high porosity (66 %) in the friable soils. This in addition to the high levels of transmissivity (15. 5 m 2 /h measured in Well 1 and 33 m 2 /h in Well 3), obtained from the flow test, increases the speed of the transportation of solutes including bacteria, to the underground water. Results of the granulometric analyses showed that the sand mining technique is not only predatory, but also inefficient, since the sand at the bottom of the pit is left unexploited, as well as the bentonite clay found in the deeper layers. According to the penetration tests (SPT), the aquifer has an average thickness of 5. 5 m and an upper layer of impermeable organic clays that confine the sand deposits. Furthermore, an aquiclude composed of green bentonitic clays was identified just below the confined layer. However, it is necessary to point out that the confinement condition is lost as soon as the organic soil layer is removed during mining exploitation and the sandy deposits starts to have direct contact with freely circulating air in the atmosphere, therefore the aquifer becomes unconfined. With reference to the results concerning the water quality, the <b>ammoniac</b> <b>nitrogen</b> element was found in a concentration greater than expected, both in the wells and in the active pits. This occurs due to the release of tillage soil, rich in urea (ammonium nitrate), which is removed for the installation of sand mining dredgers. Heterotrophic bacteria were found in the groundwater. Therefore, the negative interference of sand mining pits in the quality and storage of the water in the quaternary sedimentary aquifer was proved...|$|E

As plantas foram introduzidas na quarta cÃlula do sistema de lagoas de estabilizaÃÃo da indÃstria, ocupando 35 m 2 da Ãrea total delimitada para o experimento: 870 m 2. Durante o perÃodo de 11 meses (47 semanas) de desenvolvimento das macrÃfitas na lagoa, realizou-se o monitoramento de parÃmetros fÃsico-quÃmicos, analisados com freqÃÃncia mensal e parÃmetros meteorolÃgicos, coletados com freqÃÃncia diÃria e/ou semanal. Com intuito de buscar informaÃÃes sobre a degradaÃÃo das macrÃfitas retiradas do sistema de tratamento, foi conduzido um experimento em planta piloto, montando-se oito leiras de compostagem com aproximadamente 0, 60 m 3, com quatro tratamentos distintos, sendo: T 1 - AguapÃ (E. crassipes), T 2 - AguapÃ e dejeto suÃno (7 : 1), T 3 - AguapÃ, dejeto suÃno e terra (7 : 1 : 0, 67), T 4 - AguapÃ, dejeto suÃno e tripa celulÃsica (7 : 1 : 0, 67), por um perÃodo de 90 dias, monitorando-se semanalmente a temperatura, e mensalmente a umidade, cinzas, nitrogÃnio e carbono orgÃnico total. Os resultados obtidos, durante os 11 meses do experimento, foram promissores e observou-se uma eficiÃncia media de remoÃÃo de DQO de 26, 3 % e de DBO de 32, 5 %, com remoÃÃo mÃxima de DQO de 77, 2 % e de DBO de 77, 8 %. Em relaÃÃo aos nutrientes, observou-se uma remoÃÃo mÃdia de nitrogÃnio total de 21, 2 % com mÃxima de 87, 9 %, de nitrogÃnio amoniacal de 11, 0 % com mÃxima de 47, 5 % e de fÃsforo total de 11, 1 % com mÃxima de 38, 9 %, para um tempo mÃdio de retenÃÃo de cinco dias. Com relaÃÃo Ã turbidez, observou-se aumento da turbidez afluente nos meses com maior Ãndice de precipitaÃÃo pluviomÃtrica, contudo a eficiÃncia manteve-se positiva durante todo perÃodo de monitoramento, com remoÃÃo mÃxima de 58, 1 %. Considerando a relaÃÃo C/N como um indicador da maturidade do composto, observou-se que o tratamento T 4 (aguapÃ, dejeto e tripa celulÃsica) obteve o menor perÃodo de estabilizaÃÃo do composto orgÃnico: 60 dias.

The plants were introduced into the forth tank of the industry stabilization lagoons system, covering 35 m 2 of the total area delimitated for the experiment: 870 m 2. During a period of 11 months (47 weeks) of water hyacinth development, physic and chemical parameters were monitored monthly and meteorological parameters were monitored daily or weekly. In order to search information about the degradation of the water hyacinths removed from the treatment, another experiment was conduced in plant pilot. Eight composting piles were built measuring approximately 0. 60 m 3, with four distinct treatments that were done twice. The treatments were T 1 - Water hyacinth (E. crassipes), T 2 - Water hyacinth and swine excrement (7 : 1), T 3 - Water hyacinth, swine excrement and earth (7 : 1 : 0, 67), T 4 - Water hyacinth, swine excrement and cellulosic gut (7 : 1 : 0, 67), for a period of 90 days. The temperature was monitored daily, and humidity, cinder, nitrogen and total organic carbon were monitored monthly. The result obtained, during 11 months, were promising and the efficient averages of 26. 3 % of COD and 32. 5 % of BOD removal were observed, with a maximum removal of 77. 2 % of COD and 77. 87 % of BOD.
