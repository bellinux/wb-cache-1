5|$|A {{narrative}} rational for {{the concept}} of Hell {{can be found in}} the Hindu epic, Mahabharata. This narrative ends with Yudhishthira's visit to hell after being offered acceptance into heaven. This journey creates a scene for the audience that helps illustrate the importance of understanding hell as well as heaven before accepting either extreme. This idea provides an essential lesson regarding Dharma, a primary theme within the Mahabharata. Dharma is not a black and white concept, and all people are not entirely good or entirely evil. As such, tolerance is essential in order to truly understand the “right way of living”. We all must understand the worst to truly understand <b>and</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> best just as we must experience the best before we can experience the worst. This narrative utilizes the Hindu religion in order to teach lessons on tolerance and acceptance of one another's faults as well as virtues.|$|E
5|$|Changes in {{government}} approaches towards education {{meant that it}} was no longer regarded adequate for a child to leave education aged 14, as that is the age when they were seen to really understand <b>and</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> value of education, as well as being the period when adolescence was at its height. It was beginning to be seen as the worst age for a sudden switch from education to employment, with around 80% of children in 1938 leaving education at this age, many having only had primary-school level education. Although there were concerns about the effects of having less labour from these children, it was hoped that the outcome of a larger quantity of more qualified, skilled workers would eliminate the deficit problem from the loss of unskilled labour.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, in {{reaction}} to a plan of the policemen of the Boston Police Department to register with a union, Police Commissioner Edwin U. Curtis announced that such an act would not be tolerated. In August of that year, the American Federation of Labor issued a charter to the Boston Police Union. Curtis declared the union's leaders were guilty of insubordination and would be relieved of duty, but indicated he would cancel their suspension if the union was dissolved by September 4. The mayor of Boston, Andrew Peters, convinced Curtis to delay his action for a few days, but with no results, and Curtis suspended the union leaders on September 8. The following day, about three-quarters of the policemen in Boston went on strike. Coolidge, tacitly but fully in support of Curtis' position, closely monitored the situation but initially deferred to the local authorities. He anticipated that only a resulting measure of lawlessness could sufficiently prompt the public to understand <b>and</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> controlling principle – that a policeman does not strike. That night and the next, there was sporadic violence and rioting in the unruly city. Peters, concerned about sympathy strikes by the firemen and others, called up some units of the Massachusetts National Guard stationed in the Boston area pursuant to an old and obscure legal authority, and relieved Curtis of duty.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} {{temple was}} without boundary wall. The main mandapa was also {{open for the}} devotees to view <b>and</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> intricate carvings inside the temple. For security of the temple, a high wall was constructed around the temple, a wood-and-brick gateway and doors added by Somayya Danayaka during the rule of Veera Ballala III (1292–1343), {{as well as the}} open mandapa was covered with perforated stone screens. The new screens darkened the inside of the temple making it difficult to see the artwork but allowed enough light for the darshana of the garbha griya.|$|E
25|$|A {{day at the}} National Museum of Rural Life {{gives an}} {{opportunity}} for visitors {{to get back to}} the land and experience the traditional way of life as it was on the rural and partly mechanised Scottish farm of the 1950s. Ploughing, sowing, haymaking and harvesting are all carried out on this working farm. Interpretation guides enable visitors to understand <b>and</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> many activities which are part and parcel of the Scottish farming year. Tractor rides take visitors to the farm where they can also see the herd of pedigree Ayrshire cattle which calve from January–March being milked every day at 3.00pm and the Kittochside flock of Scottish blackface ewes (sheep) which lamb in early April.|$|E

25|$|In Adone, Marino quotes and rewrites {{passages}} from Dante's Divine Comedy, Ariosto, Tasso and the French {{literature of the}} day. The aim of these borrowings is not plagiarism but rather to introduce an erudite game with the reader who must recognise the sources <b>and</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> results of the revision. Marino challenges the reader {{to pick up on}} the quotations and to enjoy {{the way in which the}} material has been reworked, as part of a conception of poetic creation in which everything in the world (including the literature of the past) can become the object of new poetry. In this way, Marino also turns Adone into a kind of poetic encyclopaedia, which collects and modernises all the previous productions of human genius.|$|E
25|$|Music-specific neural {{networks}} {{exist in the}} brain {{for a variety of}} music-related tasks. It has been shown that Broca's area is involved in the processing of musical syntax. Furthermore, brain damage can disrupt an individual's ability {{to tell the difference between}} tonal and atonal music and detect the presence of wrong notes, but can preserve the individual's ability to assess the distance between pitches and the direction of the pitch. The opposite scenario can also occur, in which the individual loses pitch discrimination capabilities, but can sense <b>and</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> tonal context of the work. Distinct {{neural networks}} also exist for music memories, singing, and music recognition. Neural networks for music recognition are particularly intriguing. A patient can undergo brain damage that renders him/her unable to recognize familiar melodies that are presented without words. However, the patient maintains the ability to recognize spoken lyrics or words, familiar voices, and environmental sounds. The reverse case is also possible, in which the patient cannot recognize spoken words, but can still recognize familiar melodies. These situations overturn previous claims that speech recognition and music recognition share a single processing system. Instead, it is clear that there are at least two distinct processing modules: one for speech and one for music.|$|E

He praised the game's enemies, but experienced minor control issues. [...] Pacing was remarked to be slower {{than that of the}} Genesis Sonic games because of the added combat sequences, though felt that this gave the player explore <b>and</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> level design.

He compared (as did Arjona and other critics) the production values and musical style of Independiente with past albums Animal Nocturno and Historias. Finally, he stated that [...] "Returning fans will revel in this combination of freedom and growth, <b>and</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> return of producer Tommy Torres, {{the man who has}} been behind the boards for quite a few of Arjona's most popular releases" [...] (referring to Torres' absence from the production of Poquita Ropa).|$|E
500|$|Powderfinger {{spent less}} money {{producing}} Double Allergic than on their previous works. Previously, the band {{had worked with}} Tony Cohen, whom Fanning stated was expensive due to his success in the industry. For Double Allergic the band chose Tim Whitten, a less well known producer, and because the band knew what they intended to do {{as they entered the}} studio they managed to spend less despite the improved sound. Middleton commented on Whitten's capabilities in the recording studio, saying [...] "He's what a band looks for in a producer/engineer, because he's got his own ideas", but stating that Whitten would also listen to <b>and</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> band's ideas.|$|E

[...] Yokoyama {{had originally been}} concerned that foreign audiences would not fully understand <b>and</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> work, but {{the reaction of the}} audience at the Glasgow showing alleviated his concerns. [...] According to Yokoyama and Satou, elements of the story that exhibited strong elements of Japanese culture included the watermelon eating scene, the part where Gin hits young Hotaru over the head with a stick, and the scene where young Hotaru gets scared at night when she sees the face of a yōkai in the patterns of the wood panels on the ceiling.|$|E

500|$|Architect Norton Juster {{was living}} in his {{hometown}} of Brooklyn, after three years in the navy. In June 1960, he gained a $5,000 grant from the Ford Foundation to write a children's book about cities. Juster argued that the young baby boomers would soon have responsibility for the cities, and many lived in the suburbs and did not know them. In his proposal, he said he wanted [...] "to stimulate and heighten perception– to help children notice <b>and</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> visual world around them– to help excite them and shape their interest in an environment they will eventually reshape." [...] Beginning with great enthusiasm, he ground to a halt with too many notes and too little progress. He took a weekend break with friends at Fire Island, and came back determined to put aside the cities book and seek inspiration in another writing project.|$|E
500|$|Involuntary and {{pathological}} intoxication are affirmative defenses to all criminal offenses in New Jersey, {{but are not}} defenses to regulatory law {{and traffic}} law offenses that are considered strict liability violations (e.g. environmental regulations, DUI). Involuntary intoxication relates to cases where someone {{did not know that}} they had consumed alcohol (e.g. a spiked drink). Pathological intoxication is applicable where, for medical reasons, a person had an exaggerated response to alcohol. To be used as a defense, the person being charged must show that [...] "at the time of his conduct did not know the nature and quality of the act he was doing, or if he did know it, {{that he did not know}} what he was doing was wrong." [...] Contracts made with an intoxicated person may be voided by courts if [...] "the defendant was so intoxicated" [...] that he or she [...] "could not realize <b>and</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> nature and consequences of what defendant was doing." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Puente", {{the lead}} single, {{is the only}} notable exception. It lasts {{eight and a half}} minutes and is divided in three parts. The first is sung mainly with a piano. The second part is a ballad with Caribbean and Latin sounds, with some salsa and Cuban influences. The third mixes salsa and merengue, with Cuban influences. [...] "Puente" [...] resembles Arjona's work on Galería Caribe. This album was the first since Adentro, that Arjona worked without Torres. In Independiente, Arjona {{returned}} to his trademark sound, which Torres helped craft. David Jeffries of Allmusic gave the album a somewhat positive review. He compared the production values and musical style of Independiente with those of past albums Animal Nocturno and Historias, stating, [...] "Returning fans will revel in this combination of freedom and growth, <b>and</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> return of producer Tommy Torres, the man who has been behind the boards for quite a few of Arjona's most popular releases", referring precisely to the absence of Torres in the production of Poquita Ropa.|$|E

500|$|The castle's {{structure}} {{shows the}} results of its redesign {{at the start of}} the 14th century, using two very different forms of architecture. Seen from the north, where the main road carrying the general public made its way past, the castle had what Oliver Creighton terms a [...] "martial facade" [...] of traditional military defences, with narrow windows and towering defences. Seen from the deer park on the south of the property, however, the castle's lodgings and accommodation were on full display, with low walls and large windows. [...] A similar architectural dichotomy can be seen at Ludlow and Warkworth Castles. The park was effectively fused with the south side of the castle, with the chase running right up to the property. From the two large windows of the eastern lodgings, it would have been possible to gaze out across the parklands <b>and</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> extensive views without seeing any trace of rural settlements or the nearby town. The result, as historian Stephen Mileson describes, would have been [...] "stunning".|$|E
500|$|Wales {{has three}} {{designated}} national parks. Snowdonia National Park in northwestern Wales {{was established in}} 1951 as the third national park in Britain, following the Peak District and the Lake District. It covers [...] of the mountains of Snowdonia and has [...] of coastline. The Pembrokeshire Coast National Park was established the following year to protect the spectacular coastal scenery of West Wales. It includes Caldey Island, the Daugleddau estuary and the Preseli Hills, {{as well as the}} entire length of the Pembrokeshire Coast Path. The Brecon Beacons National Park was established five years later and extends across the southern part of Powys, the northwestern part of Monmouthshire and parts of eastern Carmarthenshire. In each case, the park authority acts as a special purpose local authority and exercises planning control over residential and industrial development in the park. The authorities have a duty to conserve the natural beauty of the area, and to promote opportunities for members of the public to enjoy <b>and</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> park's special qualities.|$|E

They have an energy, and urgency, and serious metal crunch to them that will make any rocker sit up and pay attention." [...] Chad Bower of About.com noted that Free [...] "isn't one of those metal albums that hypes you up and makes you want to break stuff. It's one where you have to sit back, throw on the headphones, <b>and</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>the</b> complexity and musicianship." [...] Olav Björnsen of Prog4you.com stated that [...] "layers upon layers of electronic sounds, that fill out the soundscapes of the songs, create nuances and subtle moods as well as walls of sound and tension."
