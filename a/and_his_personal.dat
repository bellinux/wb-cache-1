5|$|Eusebius of Caesarea, a {{contemporary}} ecclesiastical historian, tells a similar story: commanders {{were told to}} give their troops the choice of sacrifice or loss of rank. These terms were stronga soldier would lose {{his career in the}} military, his state pension <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>personal</b> savingsbut not fatal. According to Eusebius, the purge was broadly successful, but Eusebius is confused about the technicalities of the event and his characterization of the overall size of the apostasy is ambiguous. Eusebius also attributes the initiative for the purge to Galerius, rather than Diocletian.|$|E
5|$|In October 2014, {{a public}} spate arose between Ranariddh <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>personal</b> secretary, Noranarith Anandayath. Ranariddh accused Noranarith of badmouthing him, which {{prompted}} {{the latter to}} resign from the CRPP. Two months later, in December 2014, the Phnom Penh Post reported that several high-ranking FUNCINPEC officials defected to the CRPP, which included a former secretary of state, former provincial governor and former deputy national police chief. On 2 January 2015, Ranariddh announced his plan to return to FUNCINPEC, after being ousted from the party in 2006. The announcement was made after a private meeting with Prime Minister Hun Sen who had urged Ranariddh to rejoin his former party. The CRPP was subsequently dissolved when Ranariddh returned to FUNCINPEC later {{in the latter part}} of January 2015.|$|E

He has frequently attempted to live without alcohol, though rehabilitation programmes have provided only temporary relief. His personal issues ended his coaching career, {{and he has not}} worked in football since being fired as the manager of Kettering Town in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Keynes was {{ultimately}} a successful investor, {{building up a}} private fortune. His assets were nearly wiped out following the Wall Street Crash of 1929, {{which he did not}} foresee, but he soon recouped. At Keynes's death, in 1946, his net worth stood just short of £500,000 – equivalent to about £11 million ($16.5 million) in 2009. The sum had been amassed despite lavish support for various good causes <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>personal</b> ethic which made him reluctant to sell on a falling market, in cases where he saw such behaviour as likely to deepen a slump.|$|E
5|$|On 26 May 2015 it was {{announced}} that Dutton would relinquish the post early. Dutton resigned effectively on 28 September 2015, concluding his civilian career working with the British Foreign Office.

5|$|On June 26, 1953, Cooper {{accompanied}} {{his wife}} and daughter, who were devout Catholics, to Rome, where they had an audience with Pope Pius XII. Cooper {{and his wife were}} still separated at the time, but the papal visit marked the beginning of their gradual reconciliation. In the coming years, Cooper contemplated his mortality <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>personal</b> behavior, and started discussing Catholicism with his family. He began attending church with them regularly, and met with their parish priest, who offered Cooper spiritual guidance. After several months of study, Cooper was baptized as a Roman Catholic on April 9, 1959, before a small group of family and friends at the Church of the Good Shepherd in Beverly Hills.|$|E
5|$|Robin Friday (27 July 1952– 22 December 1990) was an English footballer {{who played}} professionally as a forward for Reading and Cardiff City during {{a career that}} lasted {{four years in the}} mid-1970s. His on-field {{performances}} were regarded as excellent, and he won Reading's player of the year award in both of his full seasons there, as well as being the leading goal scorer. However, his habit of unsettling opponents through physical intimidation contributed to a heavily tarnished disciplinary record, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>personal</b> life was one of heavy smoking, drinking, womanising and drug abuse. Despite his short career, he remains prominent in the memory of Reading and Cardiff supporters, both as a player and a personality. He has been voted Reading's best ever player three times.|$|E

5|$|Stephen was a well {{established}} figure in Anglo-Norman society by 1135. He was extremely wealthy, well-mannered and liked by his peers; {{he was also}} considered a man capable of firm action. Chroniclers recorded that despite his wealth and power he was a modest and easy-going leader, happy to sit with his men and servants, casually laughing and eating with them. He was very pious, {{both in terms of}} his observance of religious rituals <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>personal</b> generosity to the church. Stephen also had a personal Augustinian confessor appointed to him by the Archbishop of Canterbury, who implemented a penitential regime for him, and Stephen encouraged the new order of Cistercians to form abbeys on his estates, winning him additional allies within the church.|$|E
5|$|The Emperor rode within rifle-shot of Uruguaiana, but the Paraguayans did {{not attack}} him. To avoid further bloodshed, he offered terms of {{surrender}} to the Paraguayan commander, who accepted. PedroII's coordination of the military operations <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>personal</b> example played a decisive role in successfully repulsing the Paraguayan invasion of Brazilian territory. Before returning to Rio de Janeiro, he received the British diplomatic envoy Edward Thornton, who apologized on behalf of Queen Victoria and the British Government for the crisis between the empires. The Emperor regarded this diplomatic victory over the most powerful nation {{of the world as}} sufficient and renewed friendly relations.|$|E
5|$|The book {{begins as}} a chronological {{narrative}} of Suzuki's life with photographs {{of his family and}} friends. The first five chapters cover the same time period as the first autobiography, from childhood to age fifty. Later chapters use a memoir style with personal thoughts developed around themes. Suzuki recounts his experiences with indigenous groups <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>personal</b> relationships with individual members.

The Nazis later sold his boat and converted his cottage into a Hitler Youth camp.|$|E
5|$|Years later Armstrong {{remembered the}} {{invitation}} to join the tour as having arisen in a casual conversation, during {{which he did not}} believe the King was serious. He realized the proposed tour was not just idle conversation when the King informed his Cabinet of his plans and chose Armstrong, Judd, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>personal</b> cook Robert von Oelhoffen as his only traveling companions. At a state dinner held by Kalākaua and his ministers a week before departure, Armstrong spoke of their youthful dreams of sailing around the world finally being brought to fruition.|$|E
5|$|Academics {{estimate}} that the Court of Chancery formally split from and became independent of the curia regis in the mid-14th century, at which time it consisted of the Lord Chancellor <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>personal</b> staff, the Chancery. Initially an administrative body with some judicial duties, the Chancery experienced an explosive growth in its work during the 15th century, particularly under the House of York, which academics attribute to its becoming an almost entirely judicial body. From the time of Elizabeth I onwards the Court was severely criticised for its slow pace, large backlogs, and high costs. Those problems persisted until its dissolution, despite being mitigated somewhat by reforms, particularly during the 19th century. Attempts at fusing the Chancery with the common law courts began in the 1850s, and finally succeeded with the 1873 and 1875 Supreme Court of Judicature Acts, which dissolved the Chancery and created a new unified High Court of Justice, with the Chancery Division – one of three divisions of the High Court – succeeding the Court of Chancery as an equitable body.|$|E
