40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a series of}} scientific studies exploring the thermal mitigation of nitrogen oxides (NOx) with solid fuel (waste polyethylene) and biomass surrogate (morpholine). These studies have revealed new mechanistic insights, have described the associated set of reactions, and have developed a sustainable means of reducing industrially formed NOx, for example, in combustion processes and during blasting of <b>ammonium</b> <b>nitrate</b> <b>explosive.</b> Comprehensive quantum-mechanical calculations afforded the investigation of low-temperature oxidation of polyethylene (PE) film under representative NOx environments. Investigations of thermal reduction of NOx with recycled PE involved sample characterisation techniques, such as, carbon-hydrogen-nitrogen-sulfur (CHNS) elemental analyses, ion chromatography (IC) and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), as well as thermogravimetric experiments under practical NOx atmospheres. Innovative application of the on-line Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and NOx chemiluminescence quantitated the reaction product species and established the removal efficiency of NOx by fragments of pyrolysing PE. Studies on modelled surrogates, i. e., morpholine, resolved the fundamentals of thermal interaction of biomass with NOx. The experiment applied a flow-through tubular reactor coupled with FTIR spectroscopy and chemiluminescence NOx analysis, at constant pressure, reaction time, and representative fuel-rich condition. Furthermore, density-functional-theory (DFT) calculations uncovered new mechanistic insights into initial nitration reactions, and yielded their energetic characteristics, such as exothermic formation of nitro- and nitroso-adducts. Results obtained in this study elucidated, {{for the very first}} time, initial products of low-temperature reaction of NOx with polymers and biomass, and determined the rate parameters, from the isoconversional degradation analysis, that are of great practical importance. A typical NOx removal efficiency (by fragments of pyrolysing PE) amounts to 80...|$|E

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) <b>Ammonium</b> <b>nitrate</b> {{remains a}} widely utilise {{ingredient}} in civil explosives, and fertilizers around the world. In civil <b>explosive</b> application, <b>ammonium</b> <b>nitrate</b> (AN) {{serves as a}} feedstock for making emulsion explosives as well as <b>ammonium</b> <b>nitrate</b> and fuel oil (ANFO) explosives, both commonly applied in open-cut mining operations. In recent years in Australia, demand for <b>ammonium</b> <b>nitrate</b> has increased significantly due to mining activities, the so called mining boom. However, the use of <b>ammonium</b> <b>nitrate</b> based <b>explosives</b> in civil applications may release orange clouds of nitrogen oxides under some condition of use and explosive formulations. Although AN-based explosives are formulated under stoichiometric compositions to produce only H₂O, CO₂, and N₂, in practice, CO, NO, and NO₂ gases are released when the formulation deviates from ideal conditions. Formation of carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides poses risks to both people and the environment. In Australia, emissions of NOₓ (NO and NO₂) during blasting in mining operations have come under intense scrutiny by regulatory bodies and concerned citizens, as such emissions pose environmental and health risks; in particular, when orange clouds, characteristic of high levels of NO₂ and NO, do not dissipate rapidly and drift into populated areas surrounding the mines. Thus, {{there is a great}} interest in industries to find practical solutions to remedy the problems of NOₓ emissions from blasting of <b>ammonium</b> <b>nitrate</b> based <b>explosives...</b>|$|R
30|$|To {{improve the}} safety of <b>ammonium</b> <b>nitrate</b> <b>explosives,</b> the {{melamine}} urea-formaldehyde resin (MUF resin) was selected for the preparation of three typical nitramine explosives (cyclotetramethylenetetranitramine, HMX; cryclo-trimethylenetrinitramine, RDX; and hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane, CL- 20) based green polymer-bonded explosives (GPBXs) via interfacial polymerization. Meanwhile, the corresponding composite particles prepared by physical mixing and drying bath methods were studied and compared. The particle morphology, crystal structure, thermal stability, and safety performance of the resultant composite particles were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra, differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), and impact sensitivity test, respectively. SEM results showed that MUF was successfully coated {{on the surface of}} the three explosives, and different composite particles prepared by the same method have their own unique characteristics. Such effect is attributed to the resin’s ability to isolate and buffer external stimuli. It is obvious that the interfacial polymerization is an effective desensitization technique to prepare core-shell composite particles for explosives.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{understand}} and control the gasification rates in <b>ammonium</b> <b>nitrate</b> emulsion <b>explosive</b> using <b>ammonium</b> nitrate-sodium nitrite reaction. This reaction produces N 2 gas which is the sensitizer in emulsion explosives. The NH 4 NO 3 -NaNO 2 gassing reaction produces N 2 gas and so the reaction could be followed by the pressure increase in a closed reaction vessel. The reaction is pH sensitive, so the role of pH was investigated in the pH range 2 to 5. Gasification reactions for unbuffered NH 4 NO 3 -NaNO 2 reaction were found to be rapid below pH = 3 and maximum pressure was attained within 2 hours of starting the reaction. At pH = 4. 5 and 5 the reaction failed to attain maximum pressure. Initial rate of reaction showed sensitivity to pH, the rate of reaction decreasing with increasing pH. The reaction was found to be second order with respect to nitrite species. The effects of three different buffers (potassium hydrogen phthalate, sodium formate and sodium citrate) were also investigated. At pH = 3 pressure traces for the buffered reactions had attained maximum pressure while at pH = 3. 5 only sodium citrate buffer had reached a pressure stable state. The presence of the buffers resulted in a lower overall pressure change and absolute pH change and higher rate constants and initial rate of reaction than in their absence. iv A Lewis acid (Zinc Nitrate) was added to the buffered and unbuffered NH 4 NO 3 -NaNO 2 reactions to investigate a patent claim that addition of a Lewis acid would increase the rate of reaction. The presence of zinc nitrate in the buffered reactions resulted in rapid pressure increase; higher initial rate of reactions than the unbuffered with zinc <b>nitrate.</b> <b>Ammonium</b> <b>nitrate</b> solution was emulsified resulting in an <b>ammonium</b> <b>nitrate</b> emulsion <b>explosive</b> and kinetics of gasification was investigated. The gasification reactions were found to be rapid at pH 3. 2, slowing significantly with increased pH as indicated by initial rates of reaction and as predicted by the gasification reaction rate law. Maximum pressure increase was attained within three hours at pH 3. 2, whereas reactions conducted at pH 4. 0 and 4. 5 failed to reach maximum pressure even after 24 hours as evidenced by plots of pressure versus time.

40|$|<b>Ammonium</b> <b>nitrate</b> <b>explosives</b> {{are used}} in mining {{operations}} at Diavik Diamond Mines Inc. in the Northwest Territories, Canada. Residual nitrogen is washed into the mine pit and piped to a nearby retention pond where its removal is accomplished by microbial activity prior to a final water treatment step and release into the sub-Arctic lake, Lac de Gras. Microbial removal of ammonium in the retention pond is rapid during the brief ice-free summer, but often slows under ice cover that persists up to nine months of the year. The aluminosilicate mineral zeolite was tested as an additive to retention pond water to increase rates of ammonium removal at 4 &# 176;C. Water samples were collected across {{the length of the}} retention pond monthly over a year. The structure of the microbial community (bacteria, archaea, and eukarya), as determined by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of PCR-amplified small subunit ribosomal RNA genes, was more stable during cold months than during July-September, when there was a marked phytoplankton bloom. Of the ammonia-oxidizing community, only bacterial amoA genes were consistently detected. Zeolite (10 g) was added to retention pond water (100 mL) amended with 5 mM ammonium and incubated at 12 &# 176;C to encourage development of a nitrifying biofilm. The biofilm community was composed of different amoA phylotypes from those identified in gene clone libraries of native water samples. Zeolite biofilm was added to fresh water samples collected at different times of the year, resulting in a significant increase in laboratory measurements of potential nitrification activity at 4 &# 176;C. A significant positive correlation between the amount of zeolite biofilm and potential nitrification activity was observed; rates were unaffected in incubations containing 1 - 20 mM ammonium. Addition of zeolite to retention ponds in cold environments could effectively increase nitrification rates year round by concentrating active nitrifying biomass...|$|R

These materials were both coming from <b>ammonium</b> <b>nitrate</b> for <b>explosives</b> and from high nitrogen content single fertilisers manufactured on site. The TNT equivalent mass of the explosion was estimated by INERIS in a range of 20 to 40 tons of TNT. The human effects of the explosion were 30 persons killed (8 from the public) and up to 2242 people injured. The plant was located in the suburbs of Toulouse (750 000 inhabitants) and the extent of damages was very large both on and off site with a cost estimated by insurers of 1500 million Euro. The origin of the explosion is still under investigation one {{year and a half after}} the accident, and few possible causes are mainly on debate, in particular between the Justice and the company's investigations.
