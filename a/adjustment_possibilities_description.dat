40|$|Abstract This paper aims at {{analyzing}} the astonishingly mild {{response of the}} German labor market to the severe demand shock {{that occurred in the}} aftermath of the financial crisis.

The crisis mainly affected export-oriented manufacturing firms in Germany’s thriving regions. Before the crisis those firms were the engines of growth and suffered from a shortage of qualified professional workers. Moreover, training costs are relatively high and dismissals would entail a significant loss in firm-specific human capital. Supported by the generous short-time work schemes, these factors contributed to the high willingness of crisis-stricken firms to pursue a strategy of massive labor hoarding.

The {{aim of the}} programme is to provide a complete user-friendly system for marine gravity data validation and adjustment that enables the user to define all intervening parameters. The programme is written in standard C and has the possibility of solving for three different types of adjustment: inner constraint, constraint and minimum constraint and allows the user to define the stochastic model. It also has the ability to detect and adjust individual sub-networks, which may occur in regional applications, where track network connectivity fails. VALDAMA uses a parameter file in which the validation parameters, adjustment method and stochastic model are defined. The programme calculates the main statistical parameters and presents the results in spreadsheet format compatible with most common computer office tools. A test case is presented for marine gravity data in the North-East Atlantic Ocean.

Indeed, we argue that care policy reforms have been very closely linked to specific employment strategies, and the politics of welfare without work and subsequent attempts to shift away from such a labour-shedding strategy go a long way in explaining both the nature and the timing of child- and elder-care policy reforms in Bismarckian welfare systems. The article also shows how a focus on promoting ‘free choice’ in all four countries has justified the introduction of measures that have simultaneously reinforced social stratification in terms of access to the labour market – meaning that some women have much more ‘free choice’ than others – and weakened certain labour market rigidities. To conclude, we argue that care policy reforms have provided a backdoor for the introduction of labour-cheapening measures and for increasing employment flexibility in otherwise very rigid labour markets...|$|R

40|$|PROBLEM This is my graduating thesis {{from the}} {{bachelor}} program in Industrial Design from Umeå Institute of design. In this project I {{have looked at}} in what way the future work wear for an extreme mine environment could improve safety, facilitate the workflow as well as increase the comfort for workers situated more than 1045 meters below ground. I have collaborated with LKAB in Kiruna, Sweden. LKAB is a mining company, exporting iron ore from the worlds largest underground iron ore mine. In the Kiruna mine, a new main level was recently opened {{at the level of}} 1365 meters. The extreme conditions down at this depth have created new challenges when it comes to work wear for the employees. METHODS AND FINDING RESULT During the project I have used several methods, all following a typical Industrial Design methodology. I started with visiting the mine, having a look at the entire process and talking to workes. After this I wrote a brief for the project, containing information on what the problem is today. I made an other trip to the mine to host a Pin-Point meeting and a workshop together with workers from different positions and work places within the mine. This to gain a further and more specific understanding in the problem -s. The workshop I hosted was to see what they themselves thought would be good solutions. Other methods I've used is survey, sketch ideation, evaluations with users, interviews, observations, visits to manufacturers, visit to the industrial wash / warehouse and mock-ups. I divided the problems in to categories: The fit of the clothes Ability to carry tools Material Functions / Adjustments The project has resulted in a concept of a new trouser and a new jacket for the workers at the LKAB iron or mine in Kiruna. The garments are of a lighter more durable material than the garments used today. The jacket and the trouser have now more specific pockets and are placed in better positions than earlier. I also tried to place seams better, this to avoid any discomfort and work related injuries. One of the problems today was that the jacket for some, created a pressure over the neck. I've added <b>adjustment</b> <b>possibilities</b> to the garments and inserted "softed" materials in some places to increase level of comfort. The result is portrayed as a full size model, in a women’s fit. RESULT The project has resulted in a concept of a new trouser and a new jacket for the workers at the LKAB iron or mine in Kiruna.

40|$|Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) {{has become}} an {{established}} approach for analyzing and comparing efficiency results of corporate organizations or economic agents. It has also found wide application in comparative studies on airport efficiency. The standard DEA approach to comparative airport efficiency analysis has two feeble elements, viz. a methodological and a substantive weakness. The methodological weakness originates from the choice of uniform efficiency improvement assessment, while the substantive weakness in airport efficiency analysis concerns the insufficient attention for short-term and long-term <b>adjustment</b> <b>possibilities</b> in the production inputs determining airport efficiency. The present paper aims to address both flaws by: (i) designing a data-instigated Distance Friction Minimization (DFM) model as a generalization of the standard Banker-Charnes-Cooper (BCC) model {{with a view to}} the development of a more appropriate efficiency improvement projection model in the BCC version of DEA; (ii) including as factor inputs also lumpy or rigid factors that are characterized by short-term indivisibility or inertia (and hence not suitable for short-run flexible adjustment in new efficiency stages), as is the case for runways of airports. This so-called fixed factor (FF) case will be included in the DFM submodel of DEA. This extended DEA – with a DFM and an FF component – will be applied to a comparative performance analysis of several major airports in Europe. Finally, our comparative study on airport efficiency analysis will be extended by incorporating also the added value of the presence of shopping facilities at airports for their relative economic performance.
