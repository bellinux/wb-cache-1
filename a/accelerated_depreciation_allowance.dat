40|$|The Government of Pakistan, {{like many}} other {{developing}} countries, has opted for tax holidays as an important fiscal measure to encourage rapid industrialisation in the backward areas. This concession is also supplemented by several other economic and non-economic measures including import duty, and depreciation allowances. Mintz (1990) discusses the efficacy of tax holidays {{in the presence of}} accelerated depreciation allowances concludes that tax holidays which are designed to increase capital formation may end up penalising capital formation. Mintz’s (1990) conclusion {{is based on the assumption}} that if the assets are long-lived, and the income tax system allows deductibility of accelerated depreciation but cannot be deferred, then the tax holidays, by preventing depreciation deduction in the early period may actually penalise investment during the tax holiday period. If on the other hand the depreciation allowance is deferred till the end of tax holiday period, the tax system is genuinely generous and provides a real incentive for capital formation. In Pakistan the tax code are such that the firms in the tax holidays region are not allowed to claim or defer <b>accelerated</b> <b>depreciation</b> <b>allowance</b> but can claim normal depreciation allowance only after the expiry of tax holidays period. Whereas the firms in developed areas can claim both accelerated (25 percent) and normal depreciation allowances (10 percent) annually. Import duty concession is given for most of the underdeveloped areas and few of the developed areas. These different sets of incentives affects the cost of capital and hence investment differently. The purpose of the present paper is to see these effects by computing the cost of capital for developed and under developed areas. This will help us to examine whether the tax holidays as an incentive is effective or act as a barrier to claim other generous concession like the depreciation allowance. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} it is {{analyzed}} whether capital <b>depreciation</b> <b>allowances</b> are good instruments for redistribution {{in the long}} run. In a simple two-class economy it is shown that {{in the short run}} and absent optimizing behaviour <b>accelerated</b> <b>depreciation</b> is good for growth and may stabilize investment in a recession but is generally bad for redistribution. The opposite holds for capital income taxes. However, when the private sector and the government act optimally the optimal <b>depreciation</b> <b>allowance</b> is maximal in the long run. This removes the accumulation distortion of capital income taxes. Furthermore, redistribution may be nonzero, depending i. a. on the social weight of those who receive redistributive transfers, the distribution of pre-tax factor incomes, the intertemporal elasticity of substitution and the rate of time preference. It is argued that <b>accelerated</b> <b>depreciation</b> <b>allowances,</b> extensively used in the recent economic crisis, are an important indirect tool for redistribution.

One important finding is that the Auerbach-Jorgenson first year recovery plan is not equivalent to indexing as is often claimed, if uncertainty about inflation implies uncertainty about the real after-tax discount rate. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{last two}} decades have {{witnessed}} {{a sharp increase in}} foreign direct investment (FDI) flows and increased competition among developing countries to attract FDI, resulting in higher investment incentives offered by host governments and removal of restrictions on operations of foreign firms in their countries. Fiscal competition between governments can take the form of business tax rebates, productivity-enhancing public infrastructure or investment incentives such as tax holidays, <b>accelerated</b> <b>depreciation</b> <b>allowances</b> or loss carry-forward for income tax purposes. It can take place between governments of different countries or between local governments within the same country. This paper surveys the recent theoretical and empirical economic literature on decentralization which attempts to answer three questions. First, does theoretical literature on fiscal competition and"bidding races"contribute {{to a better understanding of}} such phenomenon in developing countries? Second, are FDI inflows in developing countries sensitive to fiscal incentives and is there empirical evidence of strategic behavior from the part of developing countries in order to attract FDI?

40|$|Rising {{energy prices}} {{combined}} with technological developments mean that {{renewable energy sources}} are becoming increasingly competitive with fossil fuel sources of energy. Mandatory renewable energy targets provide an added incentive to invest in renewable energy sources and the expectation of a modest price for carbon emissions helps encourage new investment in renewables even further. That said, in Australia the investment in renewables has, to date, been relatively small. At the same time, policy makers assert {{that there is some}} urgency for Australia and the world to reduce carbon emissions. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine the treatment of capital expenses in the renewable energy sector with particular emphasis on the need to introduce <b>accelerated</b> <b>depreciation</b> provisions to help encourage new investment in alternative sources of power. <b>Accelerated</b> <b>depreciation,</b> which is described in greater detail below, refers to the capacity for selected industries to claim bigger tax deductions for the cost of their investments in new equipment in the early years of a project. Such provisions increase the after-tax profit earned by investors and, in turn, the likelihood of such investments taking place. In Australia today, mining and the airlines are the industries receiving the most generous <b>accelerated</b> <b>depreciation</b> provisions. Given the Australian Government’s stated intention of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, it is inconsistent, and inefficient, for it to provide <b>accelerated</b> <b>depreciation</b> <b>allowances</b> to high-emission industries (thereby encouraging them to invest more heavily in emission intensive activities) while excluding the renewable energy industry from such concessions. This paper argues that the money currently spent subsidising new investment in mining and airlines should be transferred instead into <b>accelerated</b> <b>depreciation</b> provisions for the renewable energy industry...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{new evidence}} on the response of business investment to tax incentives. I use the variation provided by recent reforms to the Mexican corporate tax system, including the elimination and reintroduction of <b>accelerated</b> <b>depreciation</b> <b>allowances</b> applicable to investment undertaken outside the three main Mexican metropolitan areas. I show that investment is very sensitive to changes in tax variables and interest rates, with an estimated elasticity of investment {{with respect to the}} user cost around - 2. 0. The results are robust to different specifications and instrumental variables approaches. The large elasticity is shown {{to be the result of}} the large cross sectional variation in the user cost of capital and also a product of the small open economy nature of the Mexican economy. In particular, large investment responses of plants owned by multinational firms and a elasticity of imported assets considerably larger than that of domestically purchased goods. Furthermore, the use of panel data at the establishment level allows me to identify the discrete nature of investment decisions and to show that the capital accumulation pattern is consistent with nonconvex adjustment costs and irreversibilities, similar to those found for the US. Thus, the large elasticity compared to US estimates cannot be attributed to differences in adjustment costs. Finally, I provide evidence that the large investment response is not an artifact of misreporting or tax evasion since the elasticity of investment in other assets such as transportation equipment and land, which is harder to misreport, is also high. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis studies two {{characteristics}} of the Mexican labour markets; informality and migration to the United States. Chapter 1 studies the impact of NAFTA on informality and wages, the former measured in a reduced form through the fraction of workers without any social or health coverage (unregistered workers). Using data on Mexican and U. S. import tariffs with the Mexican National Survey of Urban Labour (ENEU), I find that reductions in tariffs are related to reductions in unregistered labour. Unregistered labour decreases less in high import-penetration industries and more in export oriented ones. The Mexican tariffs are also negatively related to real wages, while the U. S. tariffs are negatively related to the registered-unregistered wage differentials. Chapter 2 is a joint work with Arturo Ramirez. It uses two Mexican tax reforms to test whether the unregistered sector is sensitive {{to changes in the}} tax burden. The first is the 1989 implementation of an asset tax, and the second is the 1999 elimination of <b>accelerated</b> <b>depreciation</b> <b>allowances.</b> The data comes from the ENEU, from which estimates of unregistration are derived; and the Annual Industrial Survey (EIA), from which the differential effects of the 1999 reform on each region and industry are implied. It is found that the response of unregistered labour to changes in taxes is heterogeneous, depending both on the economic sector {{and the nature of the}} tax policy. Lastly, chapter 3 studies the effect of temporary migration to the U. S. on labour market outcomes of Mexican workers. It uses panel data from the 1994 - 2002 ENEU, which is ideal for minimizing self-selection biases common to other sources. Fixed-effects estimation indicates that temporary migrants obtain higher earnings in the U. S. labour market during the period of migration. They also work longer hours and face a higher likelihood of non employment. Finally, the gains from migration are lower for more skilled workers and for those migrating from the most distant regions, relative to the U. S...|$|R
40|$|Unemployment {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{pressing}} problems in Kenya. Some remedial measures have been undertaken. The Tripartite Agreements of 1964 and 1970 purported to use the collective bargaining process to augment employment. Both achieved this objective in the short run. Neither had long-lasting effects on the situation basically because they, perhaps inadvertently, tried to induce extra-market behaviour. No positive economic incentives were incorporated in the Agreements. The initial capital investment allowance, refund of customs duty on imported capital goods, and <b>accelerated</b> <b>depreciation</b> <b>allowances</b> amount to a substantial subsidy on capital so that capital-labour ratio is higher than would be the case otherwise. An attempt to counteract this by an Employment Allowance or similar subsidy on labour is opposed for fiscal reasons. It is recommended that the subsidies on capital be overhauled. It is in the business interest to expand employment for such reasons as maintenance of a buoyant market and preservation of social and political stability which are ingredients in "investment climate". From a broader viewpoint, comparative cost doctrine dictates that a capital short economy should use the abundant factor -labour - more widely than it does capital. Of the three possible means of effecting a less unequal income distribution, namely institution of unemployment benefits, steeply progressive income tax, and provision of employment for those able and willing to work, only the last policy instrument has reasonable prospects of achieving the desired end. Businesses can implement several measures in an endeavour to augment their work forces. They can, wherever possible, readjust their production techniques toward more labour intensity; utilise excess capacity by introduction of shift work; alter skill composition when that results in lowering or maintaining the same output-cost ratio but increasing the number of persons engaged; develop their markets with the aim of tapping the "mass" market; and apply objective criteria in job placement so as to maximise allocative efficiency and demand for supportive or auxiliary personnel. In a nutshell, business can play a vital role in combating this problem of unemployment by, for example, sacrificing their privileged fiscal position and by implementing positive programmes for this purpose...|$|R

Farm level survey data are used to provide evidence of the extent and distribution of benefits to farmers that flow from different rates of depreciation, and from the introduction of a 10 per cent investment allowance.

40|$|Not only a {{large number}} of {{developing}} countries but also transition economies have established free economic zones (FEZs) with the aim of attracting foreign capital by providing tax incentives, creating employment opportunities, and promoting exports and regional development.

40|$|The authors {{provide an}} {{empirical}} framework {{for assessing the}} effects of tax policy on an array of producer decisions about output supplies and input demands in Mexico, Pakistan, and Turkey. They specify and estimate a dynamic production structure model with imperfect competition for selected industries in these countries. The model results suggest that tax policy affected production and investment and further that selective tax incentives such as investment tax credits, investment allowances, and <b>accelerated</b> capital consumption (<b>depreciation)</b> <b>allowances</b> are more cost effective at promoting investment than more general tax incentives such as corporate tax rate reductions. The long run cost effectiveness of these incentives - except corporate tax rate reductions, which proved cost ineffective in all cases - varies by country. In Turkey, investment allowances and capital consumption allowances were cost effective. In Mexico, neither investment tax credits nor accelerated capital consumption allowances were cost effective. In contrast, in Pakistan, both investment tax credits and accelerated capital consumption allowances were cost effective. In the intermediate run, defined as tax policy impact after one year, only the investment allowances and accelerated capital consumption allowances available to Turkish industries proved cost effective. To make selective tax incentives more effective, investmenttax credits must be refundable and carrying forward investment <b>depreciation</b> <b>allowances</b> must be permitted. If stimulating investment expenditure is the sole objective of tax policy, reducing the corporate tax rate is not a cost effective instrument to achieve this objective.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to show that the scheme of {{investment}} allowances outlined below would be preferable to the present system of special <b>depreciation</b> <b>allowances</b> as a means of encouraging investment by primary producers, especially investment by low-income farmers. The need for increased primary production for balance of payments reasons is assumed and increased investment is the major means of bringing this about. (1) The main determinant of the ability of farmers to invest is the excess of their disposable incomes over the costs of maintaining a required standard of life. (2) The effectiveness of the above schemes depends largely upon the extent to which they increase these surpluses. The empirical studies to date suggest that special <b>depreciation</b> <b>allowances</b> have not been very effective in encouraging investment in primary production, especially by low-income farmers.

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{the question of}} how the rules for calculating the investment tax credit and the associated rules for calculating <b>depreciation</b> <b>allowances</b> for tax purposes should be structured to assure the "appropriate" relationship between the subsidy granted to long-lived assets and that to short-lived assets.
