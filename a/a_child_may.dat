5|$|Vitamins are {{essential}} for the normal growth and development of a multicellular organism. Using the genetic blueprint inherited from its parents, a fetus begins to develop from the nutrients it absorbs. It requires certain vitamins and minerals to be present at certain times. These nutrients facilitate the chemical reactions that produce among other things, skin, bone, and muscle. If there is serious deficiency {{in one or more}} of these nutrients, <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>may</b> develop a deficiency disease. Even minor deficiencies may cause permanent damage.|$|E
5|$|Many {{people with}} TS {{may not realize}} they have tics; because tics are more {{commonly}} expressed in private, TS may go unrecognized or undetected. It {{is not uncommon for}} the parents of affected children to be unaware that they, too, may have had tics as children. Because Tourette's tends to subside with maturity, and because milder cases of Tourette's are now more likely to be recognized, the first realization that a parent had tics as <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>may</b> not come until their offspring is diagnosed. It is not uncommon for several members of a family to be diagnosed together, as parents bringing children to a physician for an evaluation of tics become aware that they, too, had tics as a child.|$|E

25|$|By 3–5 years, {{children}} {{usually have}} difficulty using words correctly. Children experience many {{problems such as}} underextensions, taking a general word and applying it specifically (for example, 'cartoons' specifically for 'Mickey Mouse') and overextensions, taking a specific word and applying it too generally (example, 'ant' for any insect). However, children coin words to fill in for words not yet learned (for example, someone is a cooker rather than a chef because <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>may</b> not know what a chef is). Children can also understand metaphors.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, {{a married}} woman keeps her name unchanged, without {{adopting}} her husband's surname. A child would inherit his/her father's surname. This is still the norm in mainland China, though the marriage law explicitly states that <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>may</b> use either parent's surname. It is also possible, though far less common, {{for a child to}} combine both parents' surnames. Due to Western influence, some areas of greater China, such as Hong Kong and Macau, have also adopted the tradition of women changing their last name, or prepending their husband’s to her own.|$|E
25|$|Compulsory {{education}} commences on 1 August of {{the calendar}} {{year of the}} child's 6th birthday, and it terminates on 31 July, when the child has received regular instruction for 10 years. At {{the request of the}} parents or with their consent, a child's education may be postponed to one year after the normal commencement of compulsory education, when such a step is justified by the child's development. <b>A</b> <b>child</b> <b>may</b> also — at the request of their parents, and if they are considered able to follow the instruction — be admitted before their 6th birthday.|$|E

25|$|Both unschooling {{and natural}} {{learning}} advocates believe that children learn best by doing; <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>may</b> learn reading to further an interest about history or other cultures, or math skills by operating {{a small business}} or sharing in family finances. They may learn animal husbandry keeping dairy goats or meat rabbits, botany tending a kitchen garden, chemistry to understand the operation of firearms or the internal combustion engine, or politics and local history by following a zoning or historical-status dispute. While any type of homeschoolers may also use these methods, the unschooled child initiates these learning activities. The natural learner participates with parents and others in learning together.|$|E
25|$|The funerary urns {{in which}} {{the ashes of the}} cremated were placed were {{gradually}} overtaken in popularity by the sarcophagus as inhumation became more common. Particularly in the 2nd–4th centuries, these were often decorated with reliefs that became an important vehicle for Late Roman sculpture. The scenes depicted were drawn from mythology, religious beliefs pertaining to the mysteries, allegories, history, or scenes of hunting or feasting. Many sarcophagi depict Nereids, fantastical sea creatures, and other marine imagery that may allude to the location of the Isles of the Blessed across the sea, with a portrait of the deceased on a seashell. The sarcophagus of <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>may</b> show tender representations of family life, Cupids, or children playing.|$|E
25|$|As {{previously}} stated function {{refers to}} the effect the behavior produces on the environment. The actual form of the behavior is referred to the topography. Different behaviors may serve the same function, thus describing one limitation of treating behaviors based on form alone. For example, <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>may</b> scream, hit, and cry to obtain attention from his mother. What the behavior looks like often reveals little useful information about the conditions that account for it. However, identifying the conditions that account for a behavior, suggests what conditions need to be altered to change the behavior. Therefore, assessment of function of a behavior can yield useful information with respect to intervention strategies {{that are likely to}} be effective.|$|E

25|$|Since Law No. 2003-516 of 18 June 2003 on the {{devolution}} {{of family}} names, {{there is no}} longer any distinction between the name of the mother and the father. <b>A</b> <b>child</b> <b>may</b> receive the family name of one or the other, or both family names. Decree No. 2004-1159 of 29 October 2004 implemented Law No. 2002-304 of 4 March 2002, provided that children born on or after 1 January 2004 and children changing names, may have or use only the family name of the father or the mother or both family names. However, whichever form is used, a person's name must be used consistently on all identification documents, such as a passport or identity card.|$|E
25|$|If, as is {{commonly}} done, APD is assessed using tests that involve identifying, repeating or discriminating speech, then <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>may</b> do poorly because of primary language problems. In a study comparing {{children with a}} diagnosis of dyslexia and those with a diagnosis of APD, they found the two groups could not be distinguished. obtained similar findings in studies comparing children diagnosed with SLI or APD. The two groups had very similar profiles. This raises the worrying possibility that the diagnosis that a child receives may be largely {{a function of the}} specialist they see: the same child who would be diagnosed with APD by an audiologist may be diagnosed with SLI by a speech-language therapist or with dyslexia by a psychologist.|$|E
25|$|For example, {{educational}} {{psychologists have}} conducted {{research on the}} instructional applicability of Jean Piaget's theory of development, according to which children mature through four stages of cognitive capability. Piaget hypothesized that children are not capable of abstract logical thought until they are older than about 11 years, and therefore younger children {{need to be taught}} using concrete objects and examples. Researchers have found that transitions, such as from concrete to abstract logical thought, do not occur {{at the same time in}} all domains. <b>A</b> <b>child</b> <b>may</b> be able to think abstractly about mathematics, but remain limited to concrete thought when reasoning about human relationships. Perhaps Piaget's most enduring contribution is his insight that people actively construct their understanding through a self-regulatory process.|$|E

30|$|It can be {{difficult}} to get children and adolescents to engage in psychotherapy (Oetzel and Scherer 2003; Kazdin 1996). Furthermore, it should be acknowledged that <b>a</b> <b>child’s</b> perceived difficulties <b>may</b> be different to their medical diagnosis—for example <b>a</b> <b>child</b> with ASD <b>may</b> find CAP useful to help with anxiety symptoms though the CAP may not change the child’s symptoms of ASD.|$|R
25|$|Mainly on {{the basis}} of their reunion {{behaviours}} (although other behaviours are taken into account) in the Strange Situation Paradigm (Ainsworth et al., 1978; see below), infants can be categorized into three 'organized' attachment categories: Secure (Group B); Avoidant (Group A); and Anxious/Resistant (Group C). There are subclassifications for each group (see below). A fourth category, termed Disorganized (D), can also be assigned to an infant assessed in the Strange Situation although a primary 'organized' classification is always given for an infant judged to be disorganized. Each of these groups reflects a different kind of attachment relationship with the mother. <b>A</b> <b>child</b> <b>may</b> have a different type of attachment to each parent as well as to unrelated caregivers. Attachment style is thus not so much a part of the child's thinking, but is characteristic of a specific relationship. However, after about age five the child exhibits one primary consistent pattern of attachment in relationships.|$|E
25|$|Though the {{simultaneous}} bilingual child learns two languages at once, {{this does not}} mean that he or she speaks them with identical competence. It is common for young simultaneous bilinguals to be more proficient in one language than the other, and this is probably related to each child's relative exposure to each language; for example, many bilingual children are more proficient in the mother's than the father's language, arguably because their mothers assume most of the childcare responsibilities and/or simply spend more time with their children. The dominant language is almost always the language spoken by the greatest number of the people the child interacts with (generally the language the child is educated in). The child sees this language as most effective and begins to favor it. However, their dominant language need not be their L1. In addition, it is possible to show language dominance in one language for one domain and dominance in the other language for another domain. For example, <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>may</b> be dominant in his or her L1 at home, but in the school context, his or her L2 becomes the dominant language being used.|$|E
