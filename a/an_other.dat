5|$|Other {{than the}} {{national}} flag, anthem and emblem, Belarus has several unofficial symbols. The Cross of Saint Euphrosyne, a 12th-century relic which disappeared during the Second World War is considered a spiritual symbol of Belarus.

5|$|Animals {{are visible}} in stalls. Behind {{them is a}} {{crumbling}} wall with three low Romanesque windows. Four shepherds in contemporary 15th-century clothing are chatting amiably, leaning against the wall, looking into the shed. Two are positioned {{to the left and}} two to the right; in each pair one is dressed in red and <b>an</b> <b>other</b> in blue. Behind the shed is a small hill where two shepherds herd sheep along a pathway, and beyond is a Netherlandish town with two domed structures in its center, symbolizing Jerusalem and Christ's Passion. The large domed building is based on the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem, a replica of which the Adornes family built in Bruges in 1427, called the Jerusalem chapel. A flock of geese is visible high in the sky through the roof's trusses.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of season two, Shannon loses Vincent in the jungle. While searching for him, she is shocked to find Walt {{standing}} before her, dripping wet. However, when Sayid finds her, Walt disappears. Over the next few days, Sayid builds Shannon a shelter on the beach. He brings her to it and they soon decide to sleep {{together for the first}} time. Sayid leaves to get a bottle of water for Shannon and in his absence, Shannon again sees a vision of Walt, standing in the shelter with her. Sayid brushes off her experience as a dream. She uses Vincent to try to find Walt, only for him to lead her to Boone's grave. After a while, she takes Vincent into the jungle again, with Sayid in pursuit. As it starts to rain, Sayid and Shannon admit their feelings for each other before both seeing Walt. Shannon runs after him, only to be accidentally shot by Ana Lucia (Michelle Rodriguez), who mistakes her for <b>an</b> <b>Other.</b> She dies moments later in Sayid's arms. Shannon's death not only left Sayid heartbroken, but also caused a rift between the survivors and the Tailies. Throughout the rest of the season, Ana Lucia is shown to be guilt-ridden over killing Shannon.|$|E
5|$|Henriksen {{was one of}} {{the several}} actors, {{including}} Michael Biehn and Bill Paxton, cast in Aliens who had collaborated with James Cameron on The Terminator. Roz Kaveney, in her analysis of Ash in From Alien to The Matrix: Reading Science Fiction Film, draws parallels to Bishop as a representation of the Three Laws of Robotics. Although Ash's programming allows (and encourages) harming humans, Bishop puts human life above all else in accordance with the First Law of Robotics. Bishop was studied by LeiLani Nishime of the University of Texas Press in 2005 as a theoretical dramatization of how humans would deal with the presence of <b>an</b> <b>Other,</b> concerning Ripley's initial apprehension about being near a synthetic after her life-threatening encounter with Ash. According to an article by Anton Karl Kozlovic of the University of Nebraska Omaha, Bishop's altruistic actions (which include rescuing Newt and Ripley) contradict a trend towards technophobia in pre-1990 films.|$|E

5|$|The childless Raymond III of Tripoli {{decided to}} {{bequeath}} his county to his godson, Raymond, who was Bohemond's elder brother. Bohemond III of Antioch sent Bohemond to Tripoli, because {{the union of}} Antioch and Tripoli under one monarch could jeopardize the defence of both crusader states. Raymond III of Tripoli ordered his vassals to do homage to Bohemond. The dying count, {{who was a member}} of the House of Toulouse, also prescribed that should <b>an</b> <b>other</b> member of his family come from Toulouse, Bohemond should cede the County of Tripoli to him. Raymond died in late 1187. Charters issued during the first years of Bohemond's rule imply that his elder brother was regarded a titular count of Tripoli for a while.|$|E

Since {{there were a number}} of offences which would normally preclude the award of the medal, awards were only made after a thorough check of a sailor's service record. The award of the medal required the recommendation of the individual's commanding officer and it could therefore only be awarded to serving personnel.

25|$|In the Netherlands, a Dutch oven {{is called}} a , which {{literally}} translates to frying pan or roasting pan. <b>An</b> <b>other</b> name for it is sudderpan, which literally translates to 'simmerpan' or 'simmering pot'. The design most used today is a black (with blue inside) enameled steel pan, that is suitable for gas and induction heating. The model was introduced in 1891 by BK, a well known Dutch manufacturer of cookware. Cheaper and lighter in weight than cast iron, {{it proved to be}} a revolution in the kitchen. A braadpan is mainly used for frying meat only, {{but it can also be}} used for making traditional stews such as hachÃ©e. Cast-iron models exist, but are used less frequently.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the last}} two {{thousand}} years traditional variations have emerged among the traditional liturgical customs of different Jewish communities, such as Ashkenazic, Sephardic, Yemenite, Eretz Yisrael and others, or rather recent liturgical inventions such as Hassidic, Chabad, and various Reform minhagim. However the differences are minor compared with the commonalities. Halachically, Jews can switch from one nusach tefillah to <b>an</b> <b>other</b> (and back) at any time, even on a daily basis, and are not bound to follow the nusach of their forefathers. Most of the Jewish liturgy is sung or chanted with traditional melodies or trope. Synagogues may designate or employ a professional or lay hazzan (cantor) {{for the purpose of}} leading the congregation in prayer, especially on Shabbat or holidays.|$|E
