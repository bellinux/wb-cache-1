5|$|Chemically, {{actinium}} {{is similar}} to lanthanum, which is explained by their similar ionic radii <b>and</b> <b>electronic</b> structure. Like lanthanum, actinium has oxidation of +3, but it is less reactive and has more pronounced basic properties. Among other trivalent actinides Ac3+ is least acidic, i.e. has the weakest tendency to hydrolyze in aqueous solutions.|$|E

5|$|In the European Union, the {{directive}} on the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical <b>and</b> <b>Electronic</b> Equipment (see RoHS) bans mercury from certain electrical <b>and</b> <b>electronic</b> products, and limits {{the amount of}} mercury in other products to less than 1000 ppm. There are restrictions for mercury concentration in packaging (the limit is 100 ppm for sum of mercury, lead, hexavalent chromium and cadmium) and batteries (the limit is 5 ppm). In July 2007, the European Union also banned mercury in non-electrical measuring devices, such as thermometers and barometers. The ban applies to new devices only, and contains exemptions for the health care sector and a two-year grace period for manufacturers of barometers.|$|E
