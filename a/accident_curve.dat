In this work, {{the need for an}} equivalent criterion for concrete containments was studied. Six surrogate containments were designed and analyzed in order to compare the margins between design pressure, pressure resulting in exceedance of Level C (or yield) stress limits, and ultimate pressure. For comparability, each containment has an identical internal volume and design pressure. Results from the analysis showed margins to yield are comparable and display a similar margin for both steel and concrete containments. In addition, the margin to failure, although slightly higher in the steel containments, were also comparable. Finally, a CCFP for code design was determined based on general membrane behavior and imposing an upper bound severe <b>accident</b> <b>curve</b> developed in the DCH studies.

40|$|During {{the last}} few years, a lot of road-accident-predictive models have been {{developed}} by using Multiple Linear Regression and Poisson or Negative Binomial Distribution. More innovative methodologies based on fuzzy logic and neural networks have also been used. The application of these methodologies is not easy when {{a large number of}} variables is considered. Moreover, the influence of some variables on road accidents might not be equally significant. It would thus appears useful to have an analysis tool primarily in order to remove the redundant variables for accident-predictive models. Even if under-used in crash data, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) may be suitable for this purpose. PCA is a form of analysis used for extracting a reduced number of factors, called principal components, from a set of original variables, discarding as little of the information as possible. Our objective is to verify PCA potentiality for removing redundant variables in accident analysis. For this purpose a five-year monitoring period was carried out on a four-lane median divided road. A database was subsequently created with the surveys regarding the type and number of accidents, traffic flow, horizontal and vertical alignment, sight distances and pavement surface characteristics. PCA was applied to homogeneous sections having constant horizontal curvature, separated into tangents and curves. By means of the correlation matrix the results indicate that the number of <b>accidents</b> on <b>curves</b> increases with the length (L) of the homogeneous sections, the curvature radius (1 /R), the average daily traffic (TGM) and the design speed change (ΔV) between tangents and curves; whereas there is a negative correlation between these crashes and the longitudinal slope (i...|$|R

40|$|Many {{studies have}} {{quantified}} {{the effects of}} traffic and geometric factors on the expected number of road crashes. However, crash prediction models that include also rainfall and hazardous points such as junctions or tunnels have rarely been developed. In addition, most research has {{paid more attention to}} two-lane roads rather than to multi-lane roads. Finally, as far as the authors are aware, few researchers have investigated the relationships in Italy between crashes occurring on multilane roads and the combined impact of all variables mentioned above. Thus, in this paper prediction models for estimating traffic crashes on Italian multilane roads as a function of infrastructure geometric characteristics, pavement surface conditions (wet or dry), and hazardous points (junctions or tunnels) were set up. Accident data were observed on a specific four-lane median-divided Italian motorway during an 8 -year monitoring period extending between 1999 and 2006. Negative Binomial Distribution, applied separately to tangents and curves, was used to model the random variation of the number of crashes. Model parameters were estimated by Maximum Likelihood Method, and the Generalised Likelihood Ratio Test was applied to detect the significant variables {{to be included in the}} model equation. Goodness-of-fit was measured by means of both the explained fraction of total variation and the explained fraction of systematic variation. The candidate set of explanatory variables was: length (L), curvature (1 /R) and the presence of point hazards such as junctions (J) or tunnels (T). Separate prediction models for total and severe crashes only were proposed. For curves it is found that the most significant variables are L, 1 /R and J, whereas for tangents they are L and T.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. This thesis documents an evaluation of the relationships between accident rates at horizontal curves and preceding tangent length and sight distance. Data collection and statistical methods used to evaluate this relationship are presented. A base relationship between accident rates at horizontal curves and degree of curvature was established, and the effects of various variables on this relationship were examined. These variables included lane width, total pavement width, state in which the data was collected, tangent length and sight distance. Analysis was performed to determine whether these variables should be included in an operating-speed or workload based consistency model. The analysis of lane width, total pavement width, and state demonstrated no practical significance for explaining the variability in the relationship between accident rate at horizontal curves and degree of curvature. Therefore, none of these variables were included in the final model. This thesis included two hypothesis: (11) tangent length is a significant factor that should be included in an operating- speed or workload based consistency model, and (2) preceding sight distance is a significant factor that should be included in an operating-speed or workload based consistency model.

30|$|In this section, {{the most}} {{important}} studies that attempted to establish the relationship between crash experience and any of the underlying variables as related to roadway and traffic attributes are presented. Further, the analysis of non-intersection highway segments in regards to segment length is also presented. Anderson and Krammes [2] discovered that curves {{with a degree of}} curvature greater than 4 had higher <b>accident</b> rates. These <b>curves</b> required speed reductions, while curves with lower values did not. Similar results were found by Lamm et al [3]. Conversely, a study on roads in Virginia observed a decrease in sideswipe and run-off-the-road crashes (ROR) with an increase in curvature [4]. Radius was also shown to affect accident rates as Caliendo and Lamberti [5] noticed a decrease in accident rates with the increase in radius for radii between 200 and 500  m. Cenek et al. [6] observed this relationship for a wider range of radii, while Hauer [7] observed this relationship for all radii. Hauer also found that curves with large deflection angles are more hazardous than those with smaller values. A few other studies evaluated other geometric variables such as lane width, shoulder width, pavement type, skid resistance, annual average daily traffic (AADT), spiral transitions, and passing behavior [6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. Another two articles described the relationship between speed and curvature [15, 16]. Another study by Tate and Turner found that the difference between the negotiation speed and design speed on curves was strongly related to the injury crash rate [17]. Negotiation speed was defined as the 85 th percentile speed of free-flow vehicles (those with headways greater than 6 seconds). Results showed that as the difference in speed exceeded 15 – 20  km/h, crash rates increased significantly and that this relationship deteriorated when non-injury crashes were included. Other studies compared accident rates to standard deviation of speed, mean speed reduction, and difference between operating speed and speed limit [2, 4, 18, 19]. These studies derived similar conclusions.|$|R
40|$|Since its {{inception}} {{as part of}} the National Road in the mid- 1800 s, the Illinois section of U. S. 40 has undergone changes in both alignment and surfacing materials. Improvements in the road surface progressed from dirt to macadam and from brick to concrete as public usage and demand dictated. Hard-surfacing of the road in the late 1910 s and early 1920 s precipitated an increase in automobile traffic, replacing the horses, wagons and carriages which crowded the route when it was known as the National Road. Improvements in the internal combustion engine combined with assembly line production provided cheaper and faster automobiles. Increasing numbers of automobiles lead to congestion in areas where the road passed through town centers, and their acceleration in speed generated an increase in <b>accidents</b> at sharp <b>curves</b> and turns. These problems were often rectified with newly constructed by-passes and realignments. As the road and the automobile evolved, so evolved the built environment which lined the road. As the automobile became more affordable, an increasing number of middle-income families took to the road and these families needed food, gas and shelter for the night. Enterprising land owners along the route began to provide these amenities, while providing an increased income for their own families. These small businesses were generally housed in vernacular buildings, often built by the owners themselves. By-passes, realignments, and later the advent of the franchise, often meant the dramatic reduction of these family businesses and abandonment of the their unique buildings and structures. This study attempts to answer the following three questions. First, what was the original alignment of U. S. 40 through Illinois? Second, to what degree is the original road configuration still in existence today? Third, how much of the automobile-related built environment of the earliest route presently remains? Results reveal that significant sections of the historic road surface combined with numerous and varied vernacular motels and gas stations provide a visual experience of the automobile era during the fifty year period between 1920 - 1970.

40|$|Geometric {{road design}} {{consistency}} modelling {{is used to}} detect any inconsistencies in road alignment, particularly horizontal and vertical alignment. Unusual features of road geometries or inconsistencies can produce unsafe driving experience due to carelessness in the handling of vehicles. To help {{minimize the risk of}} <b>accidents</b> at the <b>curve,</b> the 85 th percentile speed prediction model is needed for the Malaysia scenario to ensure the road consistency. The current technique of identifying speed design based on REAM (2002) guidelines is prone to produce inconsistencies in road design. This is because the geometric elements determined from the identified speed design are based on minimum values and it is recommended to adopt higher values for the purpose of road construction (REAM, 2002). However, no maximum value has been set up thus leads towards under-design or over-design of road geometry specifications. With this in mind, this research aims to develop models for the purpose of predicting consistencies of urban road specifically for horizontal alignment curves with novel methodology adopted in this study. Several techniques were adopted such as spot speed study, VBOX-GPS and Automatic traffic counter detector and had been successfully performed. Parameters collected are the curve length, radius of curve, width of lane, vehicle speed {{at the beginning of the}} curve, at the middle of the curve and at the end of the curve, superelevation and road gradient. By adopting multiple regression analysis, one model for the beginning of the curve, V 85 cs, one model for the middle of the curve,V 85 cm and one model for the end of the curve, V 85 ce with R-Sq value of more than 50 % were successfully developed. These regression models generally estimates 85 th percentile operating speed at specified points along the curve. V 85 cs> V 85 cm and V 85 ce were further validated to confirm of its usefulness in predicting the value of operating speed for horizontal alignment. Validation of models were performed by comparing the mean difference of the develop regression models with the empirical data which is isolated from being used in the model development process. Comparisons of V 85 cm and three models from other researchers were also conducted and it revealed that V 85 cm is more superior compared to the other models developed from other researchers and established guidelines from overseas. It was also discovered that radius of curve, CR is highly sensitive in predicting the 85 th percentile operating speed at the middle of curve compared to superelevation and V 85 (CS). To conclude, fundamental differences indriving behaviour, traffic composition and road design standard guideline used may contribute to high difference of R-Sq values between the established models and V 85 cm- Furthermore, other models are not reflective of Malaysian road conditions and this was discovered in the comparisons conducted in this study. All these factors might contribute to the overestimation or underestimation of the models. Therefore, the developed models in this study are proposed to be a starting basis of the prediction of the 85 th percentile operating speed model to be included in the Malaysian urban geometric road design guidelines...|$|R
