5|$|The {{historian}} of science Sharon Kingsland, in a 1978 paper on Abbott Thayer and the protective coloration debate, uses Beddard repeatedly {{to illuminate the}} different strands of the argument. She quotes Beddard (p.94) on how difficult the question of animal coloration seemed in the 1890s. Thayer — an artist, not a scientist — had dived head-first into the debate. One of the protagonists, notes Kingsland, was Joel Asaph Allen, who had reviewed Beddard's book, and who believed that the environment directly influenced animal coloration — Kingsland cites Beddard p.54 here —, so natural selection seemed to him an unlikely factor, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>pointed</b> out that blending inheritance would dilute the effect of selection. Furthermore, argues Kingsland, again citing Beddard (p.148), another major protagonist, Alfred Russel Wallace, was emphasizing the problem of conspicuous markings, which could be selected for as warning coloration.|$|E
25|$|In an {{interview}} on Piers Morgan Live, also in 2012, O’Brien acknowledged that in retrospect the plan to architect a transition for The Tonight Show five years in advance was “absurd,” though he noted that he never anticipated Leno’s ratings would fall in that interim, as the press had sometimes intimated, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>pointed</b> out that all previous Tonight Show hosts had departed when they were on top in the ratings. He further remarked that he was happier in his current situation at TBS where he feels “liberated” and can do the material he wants without the baggage of upholding a legacy.|$|E
25|$|The Privy Council reiterated its position, and Ridley {{responded in}} person, agreeing that vestments are {{indifferent}} but making a compelling {{argument that the}} monarch may require indifferent things without exception. The council became divided in opinion, and the issue dragged on for months without resolution. Hooper now insisted that vestments were not indifferent, since they obscured the priesthood of Christ by encouraging hypocrisy and superstition. Warwick disagreed, emphasising that the king must be obeyed in things indifferent, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>pointed</b> to St Paul's concessions to Jewish traditions in the early church. Finally, an acrimonious debate with Ridley went against Hooper. Ridley's position centred on maintaining order and authority; not the vestments themselves, Hooper's primary concern.|$|E
5000|$|Gibbons {{has argued}} that global {{economic}} recovery will be constrained by energy shortages, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>points</b> out that the Irish economy, with its relatively high per capita use of energy, is particularly vulnerable to [...] "peak oil", the anticipated decline in global oil production.|$|R

500|$|Neutopia {{received}} much coverage from various video gaming websites after its release on the Virtual Console, and each drew similar similarities to Zelda. Adam Romano from Defunct Games noted that Neutopia was released {{two years before}} [...] and said that Neutopia [...] "kept pace with or were actually ahead of the Nintendo curve". He said that gameplay and backgrounds remain varied and that [...] "the fire rod weapon is especially fun to wield", but {{he noted that the}} things that keep the game from being better than Zelda were repetitive and frustrating dungeon exploring, boring boss battles, long passwords (for those who do not own a TurboGrafx-CD), and several [...] "head-scratching moments" [...] which include references to Judaism and Islam as well as quotes from Star Wars. Marcel van Duyn from Nintendo Life noted many similarities to Zelda, including the existence of 8 dungeons and medallions, the need to blow up walls or burn bushes to uncover secrets, the dungeon designs, and the need to push blocks to uncover staircases. However, he noted that what sets it apart from Zelda are the fire rod, the ability to warp with wings, and a lower difficulty level. He concluded that the game, while copying Zelda, might be better as it added additional features that set it apart. Destructoid's Tony Ponce compared the game's copying of Zelda to China Warriors copying of Kung-Fu Master, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>pointed</b> out what are also considered Zelda clones such as Crusader of Centy and Alundra for the Sega Genesis and PlayStation, respectively.|$|E

2500|$|Olympio {{broke his}} silence, {{which was the}} subject of much speculation, in a letter {{published}} on 21 February. In that letter, he expressed confidence in Fabre and told his supporters: [...] "I will never forget the moments of enthusiasm and confidence you have always shown in all circumstances, and I thank you forever." [...] In a radio interview on 23 February, however, he stressed that he was still in charge of the UFC. Regarding his delayed and arguably unenthusiastic endorsement of Fabre, he said that it had been necessary to consult with other political actors before backing Fabre, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>pointed</b> to his health as the reason he was unable to accompany Fabre on the campaign trail.|$|E
40|$|The author {{reflects}} {{on the concept of}} secularism from the ancient culture up to the modern <b>and</b> contemporary age. <b>He</b> focuses on four forms and borders of investigation (Hellenism, Christianity, St. Augustine to modern times) <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>points</b> out that today is still very important to reflect on the historical and political origins of this category...|$|R

2500|$|In spring 643, Wei was gravely ill. [...] Emperor Taizong sent {{numerous}} messengers {{to attend}} to Wei's illness, and further had the official Li Anyan (李安儼) stay at Wei's mansion to oversee Wei's care. [...] He also personally visited Wei, with Li Chengqian, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>pointed</b> at his daughter Princess Hengshan and promised to give her to Wei's son Wei Shuyu in marriage. [...] Wei died soon thereafter, and Emperor Taizong buried Wei with great honors and luxurious funeral supplies, although Wei's wife Lady Pei, pointing out that Wei was himself frugal in living, declined most of the luxuries. [...] Wei was buried near the tomb of Empress Zhangsun (who died in 636), where Emperor Taizong would eventually himself be buried. [...] He also commissioned a stone monument for Wei, and personally wrote {{the text of the}} monument. [...] He missed Wei greatly and stated: ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 2000 presentation, Clancey {{explained}} how {{an awareness of}} the different types of cognition can aid in developing “heuristics for recognizing extraterrestrial intelligence.” For example, participants in SETI “might look for very long phrases, modality blending (e.g., tasting shapes), noise that is actually music, and descriptions that articulate relationships that humans express kinesthetically as gestures and facial expressions.” He also talked about how current “advances in robotics and neuroscience are the beginnings of a process memory architecture that will become the foundation of a successful computational theory of intelligence.” <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>pointed</b> out that “consciousness is not a mystical phenomenon or a topic to be shunned, but is instead the key for understanding how human intelligence is possible at all, how it is distinguished from other forms of intelligence on this planet, and indeed, how it is distinguished from current computer systems. In some important ways, even simple programming languages exceed the capability of human consciousness. But in other ways, related to the flexibility of 'run-time' learning and relating perceptual-motor modalities, no computer system replicates the mechanism of human conceptual coordination.” ...|$|E

50|$|Although {{in recent}} years Corbelli has {{sometimes}} been billed as a bass-baritone, he has insisted {{that he is a}} baritone. Corbelli's voice is not large, but its dark coloring gives it power <b>and</b> heft. <b>He</b> possesses a tight vibrato and great flexibility in coloratura and patter. His diction is always razor-sharp <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>points</b> up the text brilliantly, particularly in recitatives. His stage presence is commanding <b>and</b> <b>he</b> excels in comic timing and subtle characterization.|$|R

2500|$|The same author does credit Hooke with a {{significant}} and even seminal contribution, but he treats Hooke's claim of priority on the inverse square point as uninteresting since several individuals besides Newton and Hooke had at least suggested it, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>points</b> instead {{to the idea of}} [...] "compounding the celestial motions" [...] and the conversion of Newton's thinking away from [...] "centrifugal" [...] and towards [...] "centripetal" [...] force as Hooke's significant contributions.|$|R
