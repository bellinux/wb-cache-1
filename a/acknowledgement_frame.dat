40|$|Summary. This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} for cross-layer error control opti-mization in WiFi networks. The {{focus is on the}} reduction of the overhead deriving from the duplicate ARQ strategies employed at the link and transport layers. The proposed solution, called ARQ proxy, substitutes the transmission of a transport layer acknowledgement with a short request sent at the link layer. Specifically, TCP ACKs are generated based on in-transit traffic analysis and stored at the Access Point. Such TCP ACKs are released towards TCP sender upon a request from the mobile node, encapsulated into link layer <b>acknowledgement</b> <b>frame.</b> TCP ACK identification is computed at the Access Point {{as well as at the}} mobile node in a distributed way.

40|$|Abstract — Wireless sensor networks, due {{to their}} {{potentially}} wide application perspectives, may proliferate in future. Two major stumbling blocks are the dynamic variance of the network caused by both the capacity constraint of sensor nodes and uncertainties of wireless links, and secure routing in the special security sensitive environment. Therefore adaptable and defendable routing mechanism is in urgent need for the deployment of sensor networks. In this paper, we propose a Feedback based Secure Routing protocol (FBSR). Feedback from the neighboring nodes serves as the dynamic information of the current network, with which sensor nodes make forwarding decisions in a secure and energy aware manner. Feedback message {{is included in the}} MAC layer <b>acknowledgement</b> <b>frame</b> to avoid network congestion, and it is authenticated with the proposed Keyed One Way Hash Chain (Keyed-OWHC) to avoid feedback fabrication. Furthermore, we enhance FBSR’s resilience to node compromise by statistic efforts accomplished by the base station. We present both mathematical analysis and simulation results to show that FBSR is not only reliable but also energy efficient. Index Terms — Feedback, Secure Routing, Keyed-OWHC I...|$|E

To select the correct transmission speed or Modulation and Coding Scheme, a rate control algorithm may test different speeds. The actual packet loss rate of an Access points vary widely for different link conditions. There are variations in the loss rate experienced on production Access points, between 10% and 80%, with 30% being a common average. It is important to be aware that the link layer should recover these lost frames. If the sender does not receive an <b>Acknowledgement</b> (ACK) <b>frame,</b> then it will be resent.|$|R

Zigbee technology was developed for a Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPAN), aimed at control and military applications with low data rate and low power consumption. Zigbee is a standard defines the set of communication protocols for low-data-rate short-range wireless networking. Zigbee-based wireless devices operate in 868 MHz, 915 MHz, and 2. 4 GHz frequency bands. The maximum data rate is 250 K bits per second.

The timely dissemination of voice, command, and real-time telemetry for monitoring and coordination purposes is critical for mission success. It is envisioned that future missions will require a network infrastructure capable of supporting isochronous data services. The CCSDS Proximity- 1 Space Link Protocol 1 could be used to carry isochronous traffic. This paper we will focus on the data link layer portion of the Proximity- 1 protocol specification and analyze its jitter and performance for supporting isochronous applications. In particular we will focus on constrained scenarios where the protocol operates in full-duplex mode, carrying isochronous traffic in one direction and error-controlled traffic in the other direction. We analyze the impact of the strict priority scheme in Proximity- 1 used to arbitrate channel access on the latency jitter of the isochronous traffic and the efficiency of the reliable data transfer. In general, jitter performance is driven by the loading of the acknowledgement traffic on the forward link. Under light loading condition, the upper-bound of the delay jitter is the transmission duration of an <b>acknowledgement</b> <b>frame</b> on the forward link; for higher loading scenarios, the maximum jitter is scaled up by the inverse of the residual bandwidth, i. e., the spare capacity available in the forward link after accounting for the acknowledgement traffic.

However, it is still a challenge to support group-oriented real-time multimedia services, such as video-on-demand, video conferencing, distance educations, mobile entertainment services, interactive games, etc., in wireless LANs, as the current protocols do not support multicast, in particular they just send multicast packets in open-loop as broadcast packets, i. e., without any possible acknowledgements or retransmissions. In this thesis, we focus on MAC layer reliable multicast approaches which outperform upper layer ones with both shorter delays and higher efficiencies. Different from polling based approaches, which suffer from long delays, low scalabilities and low efficiencies, we explore a feedback jamming mechanism where negative <b>acknowledgement</b> (NACK) <b>frames</b> are allowed from the non-leader receivers to destroy the <b>acknowledgement</b> (ACK) <b>frame</b> from the single leader receiver and prompts retransmissions from the sender. Based on the feedback jamming scheme, we propose two MAC layer multicast error correction protocols, SEQ driven Leader Based Protocol (SEQ-LBP) and Hybrid Leader Based Protocol (HLBP), the former is an Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) scheme while the later combines both ARQ and the packet level Forward Error Correction (FEC). We evaluate the feedback jamming probabilities and the performances of SEQ-LBP and HLBP based on theoretical analyses, NS- 2 simulations and experiments on a real test-bed built with consumer wireless LAN cards. Test results confirm the feasibility of the feedback jamming scheme and the outstanding performances of the proposed protocols SEQ-LBP and HLBP, in particular SEQ-LBP is good for small multicast groups due to its short delay, effectiveness and simplicity while HLBP is better for large multicast groups because of its high efficiency and high scalability with respect to the number of receivers per group...|$|R

The IEEE 802. 11 e MAC introduces the block ACK scheme for improving the system efficiency of the WLAN. Using the block ACK scheme can reduce the ACK transmission overhead by integrating multiple ACKs for a number of data frames into a bitmap that is contained in a block ACK frame, thus increasing the MAC efficiency. In this paper, we mathematically analyze the throughput and delay performance of the IEEE 802. 11 e block ACK scheme in an erroneous channel environment.

However, a MAC protocol in IEEE 802. 15. 3 standard does not specify the method to choose an appropriate data rate. In this paper, we propose a rate-adaptive Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol for HR WPAN. The data rate for the next transmission is selected by channel prediction based on the currently received frame and informs the sender about the changed rate using a rate-adaptive <b>acknowledgement</b> (RA-ACK) <b>frame.</b> By overhearing the RA-ACK frame, a piconet controller can efficiently allocate channel times. In addition, we propose a constant physical layer frame length regardless of a data rate. In this way, the channel can be more effectively utilized by squeezing more bits into one transmission.

Conscious animals were subjected to rotational or translational stimulus which activates hair cells of the horizontal semicircular canals or utricle, respectively. Neuronal activation within brainstem nuclei was defined by the expression of c-fos. Labyrinthectomized controls and normal stationary controls showed only a few sporadically scattered Fos-expressing neurons. With rotational stimulation that comprised cycles of constant angular acceleration and deceleration, Fos-labeled neurons were observed by P 4 in the vestibular nucleus and downstream relay stations of vestibular pathways, such as the prepositus hypoglossal nucleus and inferior olive (subnuclei DMCC, IOA, IOC, IOK). A later maturation time was evidenced for the utricular system. Fos-labeled neurons were only identifiable in the vestibular nucleus by P 7; in the prepositus hypoglossal nucleus and inferior olive (subnuclei DMCC and IO) by P 11. Within the vestibular nucleus of P 7 – 9 rats, neurons activated by canal or utricular inputs were intermingled throughout its rostro-caudal length. In P 21 and adult rats, neurons activated by canal or utricular inputs were intermingled in localized regions of the medial and spinal vestibular nuclei. However, neurons in the rostral half of spinal vestibular nucleus were activated only by utricular inputs.
