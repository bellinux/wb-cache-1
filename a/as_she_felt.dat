In 1996, she acted in the drama Long Vacation, which became very popular in Japan. At the wrap up party of the drama, {{the director of the}} series at that time heard her perform karaoke and suggested that she try singing. Although taken aback and hesitant at first, she later agreed, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> it was not a chance that everyone received and because she liked singing; she felt it might work out somehow.|$|E
5|$|In 2002 {{producers}} asked Barlow {{to return}} as Mavis, {{but she was}} too busy. In 2006 Barlow claimed that she had again been asked to return to Coronation Street, but had refused <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> the storylines were not good enough for Mavis. Barlow stated in 2007 that she is unlikely to return, because she would be unable to cope with the accelerated production schedule of one more episode a week since her last appearance in 1997. Executive producer Kim Crowther said in 2009 that she would have liked Mavis to return to the serial.|$|E

5|$|Seaborg kept a daily journal from 1927 {{until he}} {{suffered}} a stroke in 1998. As a youth, Seaborg was both a devoted sports fan and an avid movie buff. His mother encouraged {{him to become a}} bookkeeper <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> his literary interests were impractical. He did not take an interest in science until his junior year when he was inspired by Dwight Logan Reid, a chemistry and physics teacher at David Starr Jordan High School in Watts.|$|E
5|$|The Los Angeles Timess Agustin Gurza {{described}} {{the creative process}} between the pair as Chan creating the instrumental first, followed by Chana crafting the lyrics and melodies alongside him. Chana based her lyrics on her previous relationships and break-ups, while Chan found inspiration in the music of Manu Chao. Chana reported that she had some difficulties during the production process due to the personal nature of the lyrics. Although she {{said that it was}} more challenging to write lyrics in Spanish, Chana expressed a preference for it <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> that it was more poetic than English. She often consulted a Spanish-English dictionary to translate her ideas.|$|E
5|$|When it {{came time}} to kill off Ana Lucia, the {{character}} of Libby was killed {{at the same time to}} create an emotional impact. This happened amidst rumours that the characters were killed off because both actresses in question had been arrested for DUI while filming on location in Oahu. The producers denied that Ana Lucia was killed off because of Rodriguez's behaviour on set, saying although they had no interaction with her, they had been told she had been professional. Rodriguez felt comfortable on the series, but was happy to leave <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> this would help her grow personally, and become a woman. She had mixed feelings about leaving Hawaii, where Lost is filmed; her allergies were hard to deal with, but she loved the scenery.|$|E

5|$|Chrissie {{plans to}} sell the pub to Johnny Allen (Billy Murray) and a mystery second buyer, and flee the country, {{although}} Phil and Grant Mitchell try to taunt her. Chrissie though, is unfazed, as Sharon still supports her – however, Grant finally convinces Sharon to visit Sam in prison. Sharon still believes Chrissie is innocent, but finally learns the truth when Chrissie makes an innocuous, but telling, comment. Realising that Sharon knows, Chrissie becomes distraught <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> that so long as Sharon, Den's daughter, thought well of her, she could think well of herself. Panicking, she begins to make mistakes, arguing with Jake outside of Johnny's club. Chrissie had confessed her role in Den's death to Jake, and lets information regarding her guilt slip as they argue. This is caught on CCTV by Johnny, who delights in telling Jake {{that he has a}} recording. Chrissie asks to get the money for The Queen Victoria right away, and Johnny takes advantage, saying the only way she will get the money is if she sleeps with him. Chrissie resists, saying that she will not hurt Jake. Johnny tells her that she will not receive the money, and tells Phil and Grant about the tape.|$|E
5|$|During {{a family}} {{vacation}} to New York when Lawrence was 14, she was spotted on the street by a talent scout who arranged for her to audition for agents. Lawrence's mother was not keen on allowing her to pursue an acting career, but briefly moved {{to the city to}} let her read for roles. After Lawrence's first cold reading, the agents said that hers was the best they had heard from someone that young; Lawrence's mother convinced her that they were lying. Lawrence said her early experiences were difficult <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> lonely and friendless. She signed on with the CESD Talent Agency, who convinced her parents to let her audition for roles in Los Angeles. Lawrence's mother agreed to let her pursue acting on the condition that she graduate from high school. Lawrence was eventually home-schooled in Los Angeles, and graduated two years early with good grades. Considering acting to be a natural fit for her, she turned down several offers for modelling assignments at the time. Between her acting jobs in the city, she made regular visits to Louisville, during which she served as an assistant nurse at her mother's camp.|$|E
5|$|Nina Tucker is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the Australian soap opera Neighbours, played by Delta Goodrem. She made her first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 11 June 2002. Goodrem {{was approached by}} producers after they saw her video for her debut single. Goodrem, who had just signed a record deal, almost turned down the role of Nina <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> the character did not suit her style of music. The role was rewritten for her and she joined the cast. A year later, {{she was diagnosed with}} Hodgkin's lymphoma and had to leave the show for treatment. Once her health improved, she made a return to Neighbours in 2004 to tie up Nina's storylines. In 2005, Neighbours celebrated its 20th anniversary with an episode that featured many ex-cast members, in which Goodrem reprised her role as Nina once more. She returned again in March 2015 for the show's 30th anniversary.|$|E

5|$|Sweet Kisses, {{which was}} aimed at an older audience, did not perform well commercially, and so Simpson re-evaluated her career. At the {{suggestion}} of her label executives, Simpson modified her image and sound in Irresistible, deciding to delve more into the teen pop and R genres, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> that restyling herself to match {{the image of her}} contemporaries—Spears and Christina Aguilera—would help rejuvenate her career. After its release, Irresistible received mostly negative reviews from critics, most of whom were disappointed by the music; some of them also felt it was too generic and over-produced. Initially, the album enjoyed commercial success, debuting at number six on the US Billboard 200. It was an improvement from her previous endeavor and the album went on to sell about 850,000copies in the United States, and over two million worldwide. It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of 500,000copies. Elsewhere, the album was not as successful, reaching number thirteen in Canada and cracking the top forty in Sweden, Japan and Germany.|$|E
5|$|The character's {{change in}} Part II (Naruto Shippuden) has been praised for {{being one of}} the most {{developed}} ones in the series by Anime News Network's Casey Brienza, as she has become stronger than her Part I (Naruto) counterpart which, was considerably weaker than Naruto and Sasuke. This allows her to take a more active and appealing role in the series. Major praise has been given to her encounters with Sasori and Sasuke owing to her fighting skills and mature reactions, respectively. Sakura's love confession to Naruto in later parts of the series has been commented {{to be one of the}} deepest lines and part of the story arc, for bringing confusion into the mix in regards to whether or not, her love confession claim is as serious as her intention to stop Naruto's suffering. It also came as a surprise as fans wondered what were Sakura's real intention regarding Sasuke who had become a dangerous criminal during such a time in the series. Jason Thompson believes Sakura's feelings were well-handled by Kishimoto. While disliking the romance between Sasuke and Sakura in the original series <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> it was initially a crush on Sakura's part, Amy McNulty believed the spin-off manga Naruto Gaiden helps to expand the bond between these two as well as their relationship with their daughter, Sarada. Sarah Nelkin from Anime Now praised Sakura's development across the series, mostly in late parts of the series due to how she turns into a stronger person as she grows up most notably when she becomes an adult.|$|E
