40|$|Summary. Passeriformes is {{the largest}} order of birds and {{includes}} {{one third of the}} bird species of the world, living in very diverse habitats. We investigated the chemistry of preen gland secretions of some groups of passerines from temper-ate regions found in diverse microhabitats. Some of the common components were mixtures of homologous monoesters made up of long chain acids <b>and</b> <b>alcohols.</b> Individual species had characteristic distribution of esters and was unique to a given species, although there were some individual variations. We compared the composition of acids <b>and</b> <b>alcohols</b> that formed same molecular weight esters in different species and we found that the combination of acids <b>and</b> <b>alcohols</b> to arrive at same molecular compositions varied distinctly between species. To compare compositions of over all acids <b>and</b> <b>alcohols</b> that formed the esters, th...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Wood vinegar {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{products}} of biomass pyrolysis, and it contains a large number of beneficial ingredients. We investigated the components of fresh and preserved wood vinegar gained from rice husk continuous pyrolysis and catalytic cracking. The main ingredients of fresh pyrolysis wood vinegar are acids, phenols and ketones. The species of ketones are more than any other compounds, but the content of each single component is very low. After a year’s preservation, the content of acids <b>and</b> <b>alcohols</b> increases, while phenols decreases. For the catalytic cracking wood vinegar, the content of acids is low, while the content of phenols and ketones is high. The content of acids, phenols <b>and</b> <b>alcohols</b> increases remarkably, <b>and</b> the content of ketones decreases sharply after a year. N in the wood vinegar exists in the form of amino, nitroso and cyclization. Ketol and unsaturated ketones could be generated by condensation reaction of ketones, <b>and</b> <b>alcohols</b> from the reduction reaction or addition reaction of ketones, caused the increase of <b>alcohols</b> <b>and</b> enol ketone. Phenol could be generated by dealkylation reaction of alkylphenol, and alkyl broke into small molecule <b>alcohols</b> <b>and</b> carboxylic acids, caused an increment of acids <b>and</b> <b>alcohols.</b> Acids <b>and</b> <b>alcohols</b> with longer carbon chain, which may be the by-products of some reactions or products of condensation reactions, are detected in the preserved wood vinegar...|$|R

5|$|Alcoholism, {{also known}} as alcohol use {{disorder}} (AUD), is a broad term for any drinking of alcohol that results in mental or physical health problems. It was previously divided into two types: alcohol abuse <b>and</b> <b>alcohol</b> dependence. In a medical context, alcoholism is said to exist when {{two or more of}} the following conditions is present: a person drinks large amounts over a long time period, has difficulty cutting down, acquiring and drinking alcohol takes up a great deal of time, alcohol is strongly desired, usage results in not fulfilling responsibilities, usage results in social problems, usage results in health problems, usage results in risky situations, withdrawal occurs when stopping, <b>and</b> <b>alcohol</b> tolerance has occurred with use. Risky situations include drinking and driving or having unsafe sex among others. Alcohol use can affect all parts of the body but particularly affects the brain, heart, liver, pancreas, and immune system. This can result in mental illness, Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome, an irregular heart beat, liver failure, and an increase in the risk of cancer, among other diseases. Drinking during pregnancy can cause damage to the baby resulting in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Generally women are more sensitive to alcohol's harmful physical and mental effects than men.|$|E
