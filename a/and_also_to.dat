All the rocket scientists working on the project are German. At his post on the complex, Bond meets Gala Brand, a beautiful police Special Branch officer working undercover as Drax's personal assistant. Bond also uncovers clues concerning his predecessor's death, concluding that the man may have been killed for witnessing a submarine off the coast.|$|E
5|$|Another {{concern is}} the fact that {{sugarcane}} fields are traditionally burned just before harvest to avoid harm to the workers, by removing the sharp leaves and killing snakes and other harmful animals, <b>and</b> <b>also</b> <b>to</b> fertilize the fields with ash. Mechanization will reduce pollution from burning fields and has higher productivity than people, and due to mechanization the number of temporary workers in the sugarcane plantations has already declined. By the 2008 harvest season, around 47% of the cane was collected with harvesting machines.|$|E
5|$|Another siege {{was mounted}} in 1727 but the Spanish failed to retake Gibraltar, as the British {{were once again}} able to {{reinforce}} and resupply the garrison by sea. Following the siege, the Spanish began the construction in 1730 of the Lines of Contravallation, a fortified structure across the entire width of the isthmus anchored by two major forts on each end. This was intended to block access from Gibraltar to the Spanish mainland, <b>and</b> <b>also</b> <b>to</b> serve {{as a base for}} any future sieges. The territory's importance increased following Britain's defeat in the Battle of Minorca in 1756, when a French naval victory led to the surrender of the British garrison there.|$|E

5|$|As an extratropical storm over Newfoundland, Florence {{produced}} powerful winds peaking at 101mph (163km/h) {{and moderate}} amounts of rainfall {{of up to}} 2.6inches (67mm). Flooding and power outages were reported, although they were isolated. The hurricane caused flight interruptions at St. John's International Airport <b>and</b> <b>also</b> <b>to</b> the Trans Canada ferry between Newfoundland and Cape Breton Island in eastern Nova Scotia. Strong winds destroyed {{a house in the}} small Newfoundland village of Francois. Residents in Francois agreed to rebuild the wrecked home while the family temporarily resided in a summer home of another family. The winds also caused damage to shingles and sides of homes, while the strong waves damaged roads and boats along the Burin Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|As of 2017, {{just under}} 20,000 protein-coding genes {{are seen to}} be {{expressed}} in the human, and some 400 of these genes are brain-specific. The data that has been provided on gene expression in the brain has fuelled further research {{into a number of}} disorders. The long term use of alcohol for example, has shown altered gene expression in the brain, and cell-type specific changes that may relate to alcohol use disorder. These changes have been noted in the synaptic transcriptome in the prefrontal cortex, and are seen as a factor causing the drive to alcohol dependence, <b>and</b> <b>also</b> <b>to</b> other substance abuses.|$|E

5|$|During {{the time}} the book was written, Paraguay was under the {{dictatorship}} of Alfredo Stroessner, {{who went on to}} rule the country even longer than Francia did. Many consider the book to be at least in part a thinly disguised attack on Stroessner who used methods similar to Francia’s to achieve and maintain the effective control of the country, including the swift elimination of opposition, the employment of torture and intolerance of dissent. In its portrayal of Francia and criticism of Stroessner, I, the Supreme belongs to the genre of novelas de dictadores or dictator novels, <b>and</b> <b>also</b> <b>to</b> the Latin American Boom, a literary movement of the 1960s and 1970s. The book was first published in Spanish in 1974, and in English (translation by Helen Lane) in 1986.|$|E
5|$|Dvenadsat Apostolov {{was built}} by the Nikolayev Admiralty Dockyard at Nikolayev. She was laid down on 21 August 1889, {{launched}} on 13 September 1890, and sailed to Sevastopol for fitting out on 11 May 1892. She joined the fleet on 17 June 1893, {{but she was not}} fully ready for service until 1894. In 1895 she was used to test a new system of laying mines by rails that had been invented by Lieutenant A. P. Ygrumov <b>and</b> <b>also</b> <b>to</b> evaluate the proper dimensions for anti-torpedo nets and their booms. For this last test torpedoes were fired at the ship with the anti-torpedo nets deployed. One gun, of an unknown calibre, burst in 1903, killing one man and wounding two others.|$|E
5|$|Forge and the Spartans {{return to}} the Spirit of Fire and the crew follows Anders' signal to an uncharted planet in another star system. The planet's surface is infested by the {{parasitic}} Flood, who attack and assimilate any sentient life they encounter. The Spirit of Fire inadvertently activates a Forerunner docking station and enters the planet's interior. Flood board the ship, and very soon Forerunner Sentinels appear to cleanse the Flood threat <b>and</b> <b>also</b> <b>to</b> destroy all UNSC forces in the process. The crew discovers the planet is actually hollow, with a habitable interior and a miniature sun. The Covenant's plan is to activate a dormant fleet of highly advanced Forerunner starships inside the planet, {{and use them to}} obliterate humanity.|$|E

5|$|Historian {{of science}} Thierry Bardini argues that Engelbart's complex {{personal}} philosophy (which drove all his research) foreshadowed the modern {{application of the}} concept of coevolution to the philosophy and use of technology. Bardini points out that Engelbart was strongly influenced by the principle of linguistic relativity developed by Benjamin Lee Whorf. Where Whorf reasoned that the sophistication of a language controls the sophistication of the thoughts that can be expressed by a speaker of that language, Engelbart reasoned that the state of our current technology controls our ability to manipulate information, and that fact in turn will control our ability to develop new, improved technologies. He thus set himself to the revolutionary task of developing computer-based technologies for manipulating information directly, <b>and</b> <b>also</b> <b>to</b> improve individual and group processes for knowledge-work.|$|E
5|$|In 1646, {{after several}} naval successes against Spain along the Mediterranean, Cardinal Mazarin planned a naval {{expedition}} {{to conquer the}} Spanish-held State of Presidi {{with the aim of}} interrupting Spanish communications with the Kingdom of Naples, threatening the initial stage of the Spanish military corridor, the so-called Spanish Road, <b>and</b> <b>also</b> <b>to</b> frighten pope Innocent X, whose Spanish sympathies displeased him. For this purpose, a fleet commanded by young Admiral Marquis of Brézé was assembled at Toulon. Made of 36 galleons, 20 galleys and a large complement of minor vessels, it had on board an army of some 8,000 infantry and 800 cavalry with baggage under the command of Thomas Francis of Savoy, who had previously been at the employ of the Spanish Crown.|$|E
