5|$|Just {{like the}} {{evolution}} of Philippine music, dance as well has been in constant change. Prior to colonial rule, the Philippines has a wide <b>array</b> <b>of</b> ethnic dances from different tribal groups.

Both Luzon and Visayas, at first, were more akin to tribal movements until the Spanish came.
