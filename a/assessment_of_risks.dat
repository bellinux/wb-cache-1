The findings {{were placed in the}} existing an up to date expertise. The results of the literature review <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> sexual recidivism in adolescent sexual abusers of the years 1990 to 2003 identified twelve studies, which examined mainly static factors related to sexual recidivism. In recent years, there has been an increased concern on dynamic variables as predictors of sexual recidivism. The typology identified five distinct clusters based on archival offender and victim information of the adolescent sexual abusers: (1) child rapist; (2) child fondler; (3) peer of adult fondler; (4) male or multiple rapist; and (5) peer or adult rapist. The categories gain weight, when positioned against offender background information and significant differences in deviancy can be detected. Overall, results were drawn together to advocate for the study of separate types of adolescent sexual abusers in the <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> sexual recidivism...|$|R

40|$|Background: This study {{employs a}} field {{experiment}} {{to examine the}} relationship between professional skepticism, experience, and time budget pressure on auditors’ <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> misstatement. In addition, the study examines the moderating effect of experience and time budget pressure on the relationship between professional skepticism and auditors’ <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> from material misstatements; 2) Method: This study employs a multiple regression analysis on 248 auditors from both Big 4 and non-Big 4 firms; 3) The results indicate that professional skepticism and experience have positive effects while time budget pressure has a negative effect on auditors’ <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> from material misstatements; and 4) The positive effect of professional skepticism on auditors’ <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> from material misstatement is stronger among more experienced auditors than that among less experienced. On the other hand, the positive effect of professional skepticism on risk assessment is weaker when auditors work under high time budget pressure than that when they work under low time budget pressure. Additional analysis on the samples from the two selected areas, Kuala Lumpur and Selangor, produces consistent results indicating that the use of separate models for different samples is not necessary. Hence, the study uses a single model for the final analysis. The results provide a better understanding on whether the auditors are able to sustain professional skepticism with a given amount of relevant audit experience and under different levels of time budget pressure...|$|R

5000|$|In 2007 the United States {{implemented}} the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In order {{to comply with}} section 404 of the Act the company had to perform a top down risk assessment which necessitated the production of an [...] "internal control report" [...] that affirmed [...] "the responsibility of management for establishing and maintaining an adequate internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting." [...] This report has to include {{an evaluation of the}} effectiveness of the internal controls and procedures that are related to financial reporting. To meet this requirement organisations increasingly began to perform a control self-assessment using a recognised standard methodology. The organisation's external auditors, who are required to sign-off the internal control report, typically became more deeply involved in the control self-assessment process as it facilitated their later review of the internal control report. In the United Kingdom in 2011 the Financial Services Authority recognised in its recommendations for the improvement of operational risk management that the <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>risks</b> through a control self-assessment may be an important means of identifying risks. It also noted that for the assessment to be fully effective it had to be fully integrated into the financial organisation's risk-management process.|$|E
