40|$|Summary: Non-toxic {{plain and}} cinnamon-flavoured carrots and cereal-based baits used in {{poisoning}} operations {{for control of}} the brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) were offered to seven species of captive rare birds at Mt Bruce National Wildlife Centre. Some individuals of all species ate plain baits. <b>Antipodes</b> Island <b>parakeets</b> (Cyanoramphus unicolor) preferred carrot to cereal-based baits, North Island kokako (Callaeas cinerea wilsoni) and North Island saddlebacks (Philesturnus carunculatus rufusater) preferred cereal-based baits to carrots, but the other species showed no bait preference. Most baits eaten were greater than 2 g. Some individuals of all species also ate cinnamon-flavoured baits. However, cinnamon deterred North Island kaka (Nestor meriodionalis septentrionalis), <b>Antipodes</b> Island <b>parakeets,</b> and kokako from feeding on baits the first day offered, though not subsequently. Insufficient baits were eaten by North Island weka (Gallirallus australis greyi), red-crowned parakeets (Cyanoramphus novaezelandiae novaezelandiae), and Reischek's parakeets (Cyanoramphus n. hochstetteri) to determine whether they were also deterred by cinnamon. Only saddlebacks were definitely not deterred. All species except red-crowned and Reischek's parakeets probably ate sufficient to receive a lethal dose if the baits had been toxic. Baits may be made less acceptable to birds by increasing the strength or slowing the release of cinnamon, or by using a more repellent flavour. Because baits may always be acceptable to some birds, wildlife managers need to know the chances of wild rare birds feeding on baits before approving poisoning operations in areas where they occur...|$|R
40|$|The way {{in which}} most animals sense and {{interpret}} the environment around them differs from species to species. Even two closely related species such as the red-crowned parakeet (Cyanoramphus novaezelandiae) and the <b>Antipodes</b> Island <b>parakeet</b> (C. unicolor) may respond to the same stimulus in very different ways. Individual birds can also show different personality traits or temperament phenotypes when presented with a novel environment. Despite being closely related, the two species {{used in this study}} have evolved in different natural habitats and use different foraging strategies. The <b>Antipodes</b> Island <b>parakeets</b> are naturally found on a group of sub-Antarctic islands known as the Antipodes Islands where they live in the tussock and sledge fields that cover the large islands and feed on the grasses and other vegetation. The red-crowned parakeets {{can be found on the}} small remnants of podocarp forests around New Zealand where they can be seen living in the canopy and on the forest floor, where they feed on mostly fruits, flowers and berries with a small proportion of invertebrates. I postulated that the evolutionary selection pressures on these two species will have resulted in differing behaviour and sensory physiology that could be measured in an experimental setting. Five individuals from each species was presented with four options in four different sensory experiments (sound, taste, colour and smell). The four different options were presented on top of a metal pole that was placed in each corner within a 1 m 3 perspex box. The behaviours shown by the birds over each 20 -minute testing period was recorded and analysed in terms of both sensory preferences and personality traits. Each sensory experiment was repeated four times with each of the 10 birds. This mean that each bird was tested a total of 16 times (four repeats for each of the four sensory tests). The <b>Antipodes</b> Island <b>parakeets</b> showed interest in all four sensory experiments and spent time investigating all of the options presented to them, but showed the clearest preference for the olfactory stimulus of carrion. They were overall more active and showed a lower level of neophobia towards the novel environment of the testing apparatus. The red-crowned parakeets showed the opposite reaction to the novel environment of the testing apparatus by being less active and preferring to stay in one place rather than investigating more of the testing box. The red-crowned parakeets also only showed interest in the colour sensory test spending more time investigating the four colour options more than any other sensory option. Both the <b>Antipodes</b> Island <b>parakeet</b> and the red-crowned parakeets were captive bred and raised in the same captive facility. This meant that all the birds were exposed to the same captive environment and may have a low level of genetic diversity. The results of this study showed that even though all the birds were raised in the same conditions there were still measurable differences between the two species in behaviour and sensory choices. This suggests that in each species, some innate behaviours driven by evolutionary selection on their ancestor’s life history have persisted despite their common early learning environment in captivity...|$|R
50|$|These parakeets eat leaves, buds, grass, and tussock stalks, {{as well as}} {{sometimes}} {{feeding on}} seeds, flowers, and will scavenge dead seabirds. The <b>Antipodes</b> <b>parakeet</b> also preys on grey-backed storm petrels, entering burrows to kill incubating adults, even digging at the entrance if it is too small.|$|E
50|$|They {{are common}} {{on the main}} Antipodes Island, they aren't very common on Bollons Island, they live in very small numbers on Leeward Island where they only live in a 0.1 square {{kilometre}} region of the island. The <b>Antipodes</b> <b>parakeet</b> also live on the 0.1 square kilometre Archway Island as well.|$|E
50|$|The flora of {{the islands}} has been {{recorded}} in detail, and includes megaherbs. The islands are also home to numerous bird species including the endemic Antipodes snipe and <b>Antipodes</b> <b>parakeet,</b> {{as well as several}} albatrosses, petrels and penguins, including half of the world population of erect-crested penguins. Antipodes Island has introduced house mice.|$|E
40|$|Psittacine circovirus (PCV) {{has been}} {{identified}} in more than 60 psittacine species worldwide in both aviary and wild populations. The virus is a causative agent of psittacine circoviral disease (PCD), a highly infectious disease characterised by beak and feather dystrophy, high juvenile mortality or long-term immunological suppression. The virus {{is known to be}} very difficult to control or eradicate and among wild Australian parrots, the prevalence of infection is 10 - 20 %. No information on the incidence of PCV in parrots in New Zealand was available. The aims of this study were 1) to determine the prevalence of PCV in wild exotic parrots, 2) to determine the prevalence of PCV in wild native parrots, 3) to identify the incidence of PCV in captive native parrots, and 4) to suggest recommendations for the future conservation management of native parrots populations in New Zealand. Two species of exotic parrots; eastern rosella and sulphur-crested cockatoo, and four species of native parrots; kakapo, kaka, kea and parakeet were examined. Feathers of these parrots were collected from different regions in New Zealand and PCR assay was conducted to identify the presence of PCV. The prevalence of PCV in wild exotic parrots in New Zealand was considerably high in both species of exotic parrots, as the prevalence of PCV at the 95 % confidence intervals ranged from 19. 17 - 44. 02 % in eastern rosellas and 22. 04 - 33. 07 % in sulphur-crested cockatoos. No wild native parrots showed any evidence of PCV in PCR assay and given the sample sizes in this study, the prevalence of PCV was estimated as less than 4 - 7 % if PCV is present in the populations. However, the first isolation of PCV in native parrots occurred in two species of parakeets in captivity; red-crowned <b>parakeets</b> and <b>Antipodes</b> Island <b>parakeets.</b> No significant abnormalities were detectable in the red-crowned <b>parakeets</b> but the <b>Antipodes</b> Island <b>parakeet</b> died shortly after translocation. The presence of PCV was confirmed in contact birds in both cases...|$|R
50|$|The eastern {{ground parrot}} (Pezoporus wallicus) of Australia {{is one of}} only five ground-dwelling parrots in the world, the others being its closest relatives, the western ground parrot (Pezoporus flaviventris), the {{extremely}} rare night parrot (Pezoporus occidentalis), the somewhat closely related <b>Antipodes</b> <b>parakeet</b> (Cyanoramphus unicolor), and the unrelated highly endangered kakapo (Strigops habroptila) from New Zealand.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Antipodes</b> <b>parakeet</b> or Antipodes Island parakeet (Cyanoramphus unicolor) is {{endemic to}} the Antipodes Islands of New Zealand, {{one of two}} parrot species found on the islands, and one of only five ground-dwelling parrots in the world. They are long-living birds that may live up to 10 years of age, but the {{introduction}} of mice that compete for food with them {{is a threat to}} their survival on the Antipodes Islands. Unusually for parrots, they sometimes prey upon other birds, a trait shared by the kea in the Kaikoura region.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are also}} {{large numbers of}} {{breeding}} penguins and other seabirds, including {{almost half of the}} world's species of albatross, especially the world's only breeding colonies of the Antipodean albatross (Diomedea exulans antipodensis), southern royal albatross (Diomedea epomophora epomophora), Campbell albatross (Thalassarche impavida), white-capped albatross (Thalassarche steadi), and Salvin's albatross (Thalassarche salvini). The large colonies of Salvin's albatross on the Bounty Islands build nests of feathers as there is no vegetation to use. There are also isolated populations of land birds that have presumably settled here, having been blown off course by ocean winds. Many of these have since evolved into unique species, including two endemic parakeets on Antipodes Island; the <b>Antipodes</b> <b>parakeet</b> (Cyanoramphus unicolor) and Reischek's parakeet (Cyanoramphus hochstetteri).|$|E
