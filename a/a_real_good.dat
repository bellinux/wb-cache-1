I single these fans out because they're willing to forgive silly bugs like meeting characters who walk into walls or occasionally float in mid-air. These fans realize that the game as a whole is greater than the sum of minor graphical anomalies. [...] On the other hand, I simply can't ignore or forgive the game for crashing on me when I walk around the Mojave Wasteland; or for quests that simply can't be completed because of a game glitch; or for making my companions disappear when I need them the most during a battle. These {{are some of the most}} frustrating bugs I have ever encountered with any game, especially when attached to a series that I deeply enjoy." ...|$|E

2500|$|In Through the Out Door divided {{contemporary}} {{critics and}} Led Zeppelin fans; some found its synthesizer-influenced music inevitable but forward-thinking while others felt the band had forsaken their heavy, fast sound. According to Jimmy Page biographer Martin Power, [...] "predictably, {{in the wake}} of punk, In Through the Out Door received a rough ride from some critics, with Zep's veteran status in the music business now used as a stick with which to beat them." [...] Rolling Stone reviewer Charles M. Young said Page's diminishing creativity resulted in little good material to work with for Plant, whose lyrics Young found inane, and Bonham, whose drumming was viewed as heavy handed. This brought to the forefront the keyboard playing of Jones, whom Young said [...] "functions best behind Page, not in front of him". Chris Bohn from Melody Maker said [...] "the impressionable first play" [...] of the record [...] "had everyone in the office rolling around laughing", while accusing the band of being [...] "totally out of touch" [...] and [...] "displaying the first intimations of mortality". By contrast, NME journalist Nick Kent argued that the album was [...] "no epitaph", believing its [...] "potential points of departure" [...] deserved further listening. Robert Christgau also wrote positively of the record in The Village Voice, observing the usual [...] "lax in the lyrics department", but regarding the album as the group's best since Houses of the Holy (1973). He said [...] "the tuneful synthesizer pomp on side two confirms my long-held belief that this is <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>good</b> art-rock band", while [...] "the lollapalooza hooks on the first side confirms the world's long-held belief that this is <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>good</b> hard rock band." ...|$|E

[...] He was not the most elegant wicket-keeper, but [...] "hard as nails", unflinching and equally good on the leg side as on the off. Though he could successfully keep wicket {{for all types of}} bowlers, he had a perceived preference for pacemen. As a captain, wrote The Australasian, O'Mullane was prone to causing disputes with an [...] "energy of character" [...] that was not always [...] "tempered by tact and discretion".
