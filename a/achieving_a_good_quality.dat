30|$|Another {{alternative}} advancement to the PVD {{technique was}} {{the utilization of}} the edge pixels to embed message bits. Edge blocks are employed in accordance to the human visual system since human eyes are more sensitive to changes in smooth areas rather than sharp, contrast regions. The intensity of edge pixels was either higher or lower than their neighboring pixels, thus causing a sharp variation in the image. Hence edge blocks are most suitable to hide secret information in an image. Numerous edge detection methods have been elicited over the years. In 1986, Canny (1986) proposed a computational approach to edge detection which involved satisfying a few localization conditions, detection and response criteria on a class of edges. Li et al. (2009) used sobel operator to generate edge image. Edge detection was performed on all the three (R, G, B) planes and the corresponding LSB of each pixel are utilized to embed data. Finally, the stego planes were merged to obtain the stego image. But, this method did not ensure high embedding capacity. Chen et al.

A key requirement for the BAK is the formation of a “living membrane” consisting of a tight renal cells monolayer with preserved functional organic ion transporters, on an artificial porous membrane. The main aim of this thesis is to develop an upscaled BAK prototype, making use of conditionally immortalized human proximal tubule epithelial cells (ciPTEC), seeded on functionalized hollow fiber membranes (HFM). First, we develop an optimal coating on the external surface of a commercially available HFM module. CiPTEC are seeded and cultured under static conditions on the functionalized HFM. We prove that this living membrane exhibits a uniform, reproducible and tight ciPTEC monolayer, on the outside surface of the HFM. Importantly, ciPTEC cultured in this upscaled system feature active organic transporters, crucial {{for the removal of}} uremic cationic metabolites and anionic toxins, such as indoxyl sulfate (IS). Furthermore, we study the immune response of the ciPTEC and show that they are fully polarized. The pro-inflammatory cytokines are mainly released towards the dialysate compartment, which would greatly reduce risks associated with eventual pro-inflammatory and immunogenic effects of the ciPTEC. Furthermore, we present strategies for <b>achieving</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>quality</b> ciPTEC monolayer on the inside surface of the HFM. This configuration could be preferred for the {{development of}} a clinically relevant BAK due to a better preservation of the cell monolayer against friction and to a greater similarity with the natural proximal tubule.

40|$|Transsexualism, {{or gender}} incongruence, {{presents}} {{a state in}} which a person's assigned sex at birth conflicts with their psychological gender. It is classified in International Classification of Diseases as F 64. Treating these persons require multidisciplinary approach, including psychiatrist, endocrinologist, gynecologist, urologist, plastic and reconstructive surgeon. Genital reconstruction is the final step in transition, and can be performed when all other conditions required by World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) are accomplished. Female to male sex reassignment surgery Several surgical procedures {{can be done in}} female to male transsexuals, including mastectomy, removal of female genitalia, metoidioplasty, scrotoplasty with implantation of testicular implants, as well as total phalloplasty. The current operative technique of metoidioplasty comprise the following steps: vaginal removal, the release of the ventral chordee and clitoral ligaments, straightening and lengthening of the clitoris, urethroplasty by combining buccal mucosa graft and genital flaps and scrotoplasty with insertion of testicle prostheses. The goal is to perform all these procedures in one stage, and that makes our team famous worldwide. Metoidioplasty results in excellent cosmetic outcome with completely preserved sensitivity and sexual arousal, enables voiding while standing, but without ability to penetrate due to small size of the neophallus. Considering these advantages, including low complication rate, patients often choose this option. For those who require bigger phallus which enables implantation of penile prosthesis, several surgical techniques have been reported using either available local vascularized tissue or microvascular tissue transfer. However, none of them satisfy all the goals of modern penile construction, i. e. reproducibility, tactile and erogenous sensation, a competent neourethra with a meatus {{at the top of the}} neophallus, large size that enables safe insertion of penile implants, satisfactory cosmetic appearance with hairless and normally colored skin. We developed a new technique using the musculocutaneous latissimus dorsi free transfer flap, which mostly satisfies the requirements noted above. It has many advantages, such as its workable size which enables prosthesis implantation, long neurovascular pedicle and minimal functional loss after removal, as well as small phallic retraction. Total phalloplasty using latissimus dorsi flap, including total removal of female genitalia, reconstruction of the neourethra to reach the top of the glans, glans and scrotal reconstruction, implantation of testicular implants and penile prosthesis, is performed in 2 or 3 stages, presenting very complex and demanding surgical procedure with longer postoperative recovery period. Male to female sex reassignment surgery Several feminizing surgical procedures are performed in male to female transsexuals, including facial, neck, breast and genital surgery. Genital reconstruction comprises vaginoplasty, introitoplasty, clitoroplasty, labioplasty and urethroplasty. There are two substantial tissues for vaginal replacement: skin and bowel. For transgender patients penile inversion vaginoplasty presents the best option. Procedure starts with bilateral orchidectomy. The penis is dissected into its anatomical components and corpora cavernosa are completely removed. Glans with neurovascular bundle is used to create clitoris with preserved sensation, while skin of the penis is inverted, as a pedicled flap preserving blood and nerve supplies to form a fully sensate vagina. Urethra is reconstructed as in a female. Available and hairless flap, elasticity of penile skin, preserved erogenous sensation, good cosmetic and functional outcome, are the main advantages of this technique. After penile inversion skin flap, and in cases of failed surgery, sigmoid colon technique presents the method of choice in male to female reassignment surgery. Beside aesthetic and functional result, psychosocial and psychosexual outcome of these procedures are necessary in <b>achieving</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>quality</b> of life for these patients...|$|E
40|$|Quality {{of service}} in the Internet {{has long been a}} concern of {{computer}} network researchers. TCP congestion control is one of critical issues in <b>achieving</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>quality</b> {{of service in}} Internetworks, for TCP which is able to provide a reliable data transmission over Internet is a core of modern Internet protocols suite. TCP uses a “window size” variable to limit the maximum number of packets that can be outstanding. TCP congestion control research focuses on design of congestion control algorithms which dynamically adjust congestion window (Cwnd) size and improve quality of service in terms of higher network throughput, smaller packets time delay and better fairness in network resource allocation to network users. This thesis presents design of new TCP congestion control algorithms as applications of modern control theory and game theory. The thesis consists of three primary parts: TCP congestion control background research, TCP congestion controller based on control theory and game theoretic TCP congestion control algorithm. The thesis first conducts background research in TCP congestion control including review and comparison of various TCP congestion control algorithms proposed by researchers. The background research shows that TCP Vegas is the most appropriate algorithm which is chosen as a foundation of research work in this thesis, for it is relatively easy to build control theoretic model and game theoretic model based on TCP Vegas for new algorithms design due to unique functions and parameters in TCP Vegas. A linear feedback system model Vegas for TCP previously developed by White and Chiera provides a foundation upon which the new algorithms and methodologies of this thesis are developed. The first problem addressed is a H∞ congestion controller based on modification of TCP Vegas as a robust generalisation of the H₂ approach of White and Chiera. The thesis then proposes a centralised TCP congestion controller as an application of Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) robust control method. A centralised control model is established based on TCP Vegas by using the linear approach of White and Cheira, in which Cwnd of users are control inputs and packets time delays are control measurements. A LQG controller which consists of a Kalman filter and LQG regulator is designed to provide an optimal control for the control model. The primary aim of this work is to investigate potential performance benefits which might be gained by users in a sub-network sharing information about their TCP congestion control states. Naturally following the investigation of co-operation from a control viewpoint, is an approach based on game theory. The thesis makes a significant contribution to the development of adaptive mechanisms in repeated games. The thesis develops a new weighted regret matching (WRM) controller for TCP congestion control using the game theoretic approach. A WRM approach leading to a set of correlated equilibria for noncooperative games is proposed, which uses regret functions to update the probability mass function on users’ actions set and leads the probability distribution of users’ global behavior converge to a set of correlated equilibria. A TCP congestion control game model based on TCP Vegas is established and WRM approach is applied to the game model in which network users choose their Cwnd according to probability distribution function suggested by WRM algorithm. The parameters setting of WRM controller is discussed and the performance of proposed controller in TCP congestion control is investigated based on a single bottle-neck queue network simulated in Matlab. The compatibility and fairness of WRM controller is investigated in NS- 2, a widely used network simulation software for network research, to provide a realistic network environment for this research.

40|$|This {{document}} {{describes a}} new RTP payload format {{and a new}} RTCP packet format to enable multiple selective retransmissions of generic media data. This payload format is especially applicable in a RTP-RX profile as described in [9]. While RTP is widely used for media streaming applications over the Internet, using it over unreliable links needs some further modifications to <b>achieve</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>quality</b> of the media stream at the receiver. The aforementioned RTP-RX profile describes a generic retransmission mechanism to make RTP more reliable. This payload format description increases the reliability and decreases the bandwidth requirements of such a generic profile by introducing the concept of multiple selective retransmissions. Miyazaki Expires January 2001 1 Selective Retransmissions for RTP July 14, 2000 This paper describes a mechanism to use the lower delay requirements in streaming applications to make RTP more reliable, by the means of multiple selective retransmissions. Therefore a [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Pediatric {{brain tumors}} {{have always been}} {{challenging}} as well as intriguing in their anatomical, surgical, and postsurgical management-related issues. They are a heterogeneous set of pathologies involving different age groups in childhood and also differ widely from their adult counterparts as far as adjuvant therapies are concerned. Though neurosurgeons across the world are radical in surgery {{for most of the}} pediatric tumors, it can often be at the cost of future quality of life in suprasellar tumors. As the time has gone by, the pendulum has swung toward rather conservative and maximal safe surgical resections with adjuvant therapies coming to the forefront. Hence, the aim is to <b>achieve</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>quality</b> of life for these children along with a control of tumor growth (rather than cure) and to again tackle the tumors, if required, once these children reach adolescence or adulthood. We have reviewed the literature for different pediatric suprasellar tumors and discussed their current management giving our perspective with illustrative cases...|$|R
