5|$|The episode's story {{focuses on}} couple Nikki Fernandez (Kiele Sanchez) and Paulo (Rodrigo Santoro). The flashbacks reveal their lives before {{arriving}} on the island, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> been doing between day one and day eighty-one. Boone Carlyle (Ian Somerhalder) returned {{for the fifth}} time since his death late in the first season. Furthermore, Ethan (William Mapother) and Dr. Arzt (Daniel Roebuck) reprised their guest roles in flashbacks. The episode got a mixed response from critics and fans, with positive reception considering it an entertaining send-off to two unpopular characters, but negative reviews deeming it unnecessary.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2013 FFRF {{announced}} that, {{along with}} the Secular Student Alliance, it would work on educating students on their religious rights and would assist with rectifying violations <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> termed [...] "religious infringement into public education".|$|E

2500|$|After Moseley's {{death in}} 2016, The New York Times called their report [...] "flawed", stating the article [...] "grossly exaggerated {{the number of}} {{witnesses}} <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> perceived".|$|R
2500|$|... {{does not}} relate where Winkler {{and his men}} <b>had</b> been <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> been doing during the year {{since the fall of}} Venice; evidently, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> gotten the help of {{sympathetic}} Italians.|$|R
2500|$|Cocker {{credits his}} upbringing, almost {{exclusively}} in female company, for his interest in how women think <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> to say. He wrote a song ("A Little Soul" [...] on This Is Hardcore) about being abandoned by his father, working briefly as a butler, and in 1998 travelled with his sister to Australia to meet {{him for the first}} time in nearly 30 years.|$|E
2500|$|Tabari relates on the {{authority}} of Ibn Ishaq that when Jesus was about nine or ten years old, his mother Mary would send him to a Jewish religious school. But whenever the teacher tried to teach him anything, he found that Jesus already knew it. The teacher exclaimed, [...] "Do you not marvel at the son of this widow? Every time I teach him anything, I find that he knows it far better than I do!" [...] Tabari further relates on {{the authority}} of Ismail al-Suddi that [...] "when Jesus was in his youth, his mother committed him [...] to study the Torah. While Jesus played with the youths of his village, he used {{to tell them what}} their parents were doing." [...] Sa'id ibn Jubayr, according to Tabari, is said to have reported that Jesus would say to one of his fellow playmates in the religious school, [...] "Your parents have kept such and such food for you, would you give me some of it?" [...] Jesus would usually tell his fellow pupils in the religious school what their parents ate <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> kept for them when they return home. He used to say to one boy, [...] "Go home, for your parents have kept for you such and such food and they are now eating such and such food." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{theory is}} {{suggested}} by Anthony Brian Taylor, who argues simply that Marcus is babbling; [...] "beginning with references to [...] "dream" [...] and [...] "slumber" [...] and ending with one to sleep, the speech is an old man's reverie; shaken by the horrible and totally unexpected spectacle before him, he has succumbed to the senile tendency to drift away and become absorbed in his own thoughts rather than confront the harshness of reality." [...] Jonathan Bate however, sees the speech as more complex, arguing that it attempts to give voice to the indescribable. Bate thus sees it as an illustration of language's ability to [...] "bring back that which has been lost," [...] i.e. Lavinia's beauty and innocence is figuratively returned in {{the beauty of the}} language. Similarly, for Brian Vickers, [...] "these sensual pictorial images are appropriate to Lavinia's beauty now forever destroyed. That is, they serve one of the constant functions of tragedy, to document the metabolé, that tragic contrast between what people once were <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> become." [...] Jacques Berthoud provides another theory, arguing that the speech [...] "exhibits two qualities seldom found together: an unevasive emotional recognition of the horrors of her injuries, and the knowledge that, despite her transformation into a living grave of herself, she remains the person he knows and loves." [...] Thus the speech evokes Marcus' [...] "protective identification" [...] with her. D.J. Palmer feels that the speech is an attempt to rationalise in Marcus' own mind the sheer horror of what he is seeing; ...|$|E
50|$|Then manager Alex McLeish {{was quick}} to praise the Sullivan-Gold duo in the press for {{providing}} the club with financial stability, admitting he had {{a huge amount of}} respect for them <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> achieved.|$|R
5000|$|All {{the people}} of this world find nothing in the end of this life, and they find {{themselves}} in nothingness, rather in hells. Why is it like that? Because <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> achieved, <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> found, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> depended upon, it was something wrong. It did not really work.|$|R
6000|$|Joan intruded {{and took}} them by surprise. She asked them <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were about <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> {{resolved}} upon. <b>They</b> said <b>they</b> <b>had</b> resolved to attack {{the most important of}} the English bastilles on the Orleans side next morningand there the spokesman stopped. Joan said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘The Gods are true, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> ordained must be. I am Perseus, the {{grandson}} of this dead man, the far-famed slayer of the Gorgon.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{little we}} know about people <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> suffered! But I thank you for telling me this--oh yes!--and I shall always think of myself with contempt. How easy and {{pleasant}} my life has been! And you--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wish you}} would," [...] says Johnson, {{tendering}} {{a copy of}} the thin volume. [...] "I really wish you would; and let me have your candid opinion.

60|$|Andrew {{began with}} their adventures on the sands when the lamp went out, and then {{mentioned}} the signal lights on Barennan Crag <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> discovered {{on board the}} wreck. He told the story well, adding particulars that had escaped Whitney's observation, and Rankine followed him closely on the chart.|$|R
5000|$|Color of Compassion is {{the third}} album by the band Ellison. It was {{released}} on June 3, 2008, independently, two years after their previous album Say Goodnight, Sleep Alone. Ellison described the album as a representation of a [...] "change in season" [...] for the band <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> to overcome.|$|R
5000|$|The policemen they envisaged {{would not}} be mere watchmen <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> written down was the concept of [...] "Preventive Policing", 40 years before Sir Robert Peel {{established}} preventive policing in the Metropolitan area of London in 1829. In February 1789 this force of truly professional police took to the streets.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't {{know what}} to think or believe,' said Albinia, coldly, but {{returning}} vehemently to her child, she continued, 'Maurice, my dear, no one is angry with you!

6000|$|... [FOURTH] Quest. [...] "But {{seeing you}} have spoken thus far, I {{wish you would}} do so much as to show in some particulars, both what men have done, and how far they have gone, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> received, being yet under this covenant, which you call the ministration of condemnation." ...|$|E

60|$|The girl {{walked toward}} the low table with some curiosity to know how these pussys ate, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> for food. She found a row of white bowls sitting upon a white cloth, and each bowl was filled with fresh milk. At {{the ends of the}} table were plates of light bread with deep brown crusts.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not {{the last}} time we met, he wasn't; and I don't think he intends it. Things have come to that now that the parsons know where they are <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> to look to. They're getting a lesson they'll not forget in a hurry. Where are their rent charges to come from--can you tell me that, Mrs. O'Dwyer?" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{have seen}} {{what has been done}} by the West Indian Assemblies. It is arrant trifling. They have done little; <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> done is good for nothing,--for it is totally {{destitute}} of an executory principle. This is the point to which I have applied my whole diligence. It is easy enough to say what shall be done: to cause it to be done,--hic labor, hoc opus.|$|E
60|$|Be sure of this, that if seamen, as a class, {{had been}} superstitious, {{they would never}} have done for science what they have done. <b>And</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> done, all the world knows. To seamen, and to men {{connected}} with the sea, what do we not owe, in geography, hydrography, meteorology, astronomy, natural history? At the present moment, the world owes them large improvements in dynamics, and in the new uses of steam and iron. It may be fairly said that the mariner has done more toward the knowledge of Nature than any other personage in the world, save the physician.|$|E
60|$|It must be {{confessed that}} the sudden {{entrance}} of the ten cadets, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> to say concerning the joke that had been played, somewhat stumped {{the master of the}} Hall.

60|$|By {{the time}} the two chums had hastily donned their {{clothing}} and possessed themselves of the pistols <b>they</b> <b>had</b> purchased in San Antonio {{on the advice of}} Mr. Watson, the camp was in confusion from end to end, with the various bosses shouting orders and the men themselves wanting to know what the trouble was <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> better do.|$|R
60|$|We have {{introduced}} Mara to our readers as she appears in her seventeenth year, {{at the time}} when she is expecting the return of Moses as a young man of twenty; but we cannot do justice to the feelings which are roused in her heart by this expectation, without giving a chapter or two to tracing the history of Moses since we left him as a boy commencing the study of the Latin grammar with Mr. Sewell. The reader must see the forces that acted upon his early development, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> made of him.|$|E
60|$|I {{commenced}} {{my return}} and followed a new road called Lockyer's Line along which {{the country is}} rather more hilly and picturesque. This was a long day's ride; and the house where I wished to sleep was some way off the road, and not easily found. I met on this occasion, and indeed on all others, a very general and ready civility among the lower orders, which, when one considers what they are, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> been, would scarcely have been expected. The farm where I passed the night was owned by two young men who had only lately come out, and were beginning a settler's life. The total want of almost every comfort was not very attractive; but future and certain prosperity was before their eyes, and that not far distant.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's generous of you, Mr. Bullsom," [...] {{the young}} lawyer answered. [...] "You'll never regret it. But look here. There's a greater {{responsibility}} even than feeding these poor fellows resting upon us to-day. They don't want our charity. They've an equal {{right to live}} with us. What they want, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> a right to, is just legislation. That's where we come in. Politics isn't a huge joke, or the vehicle for any one man's personal ambition. We who interest ourselves, however remotely, in them, impose upon ourselves a great obligation. We've got to find the truth. That's why I hesitate to say anything against Henslow's new departure. We're off the track now. I want to hear all that Henslow has to say. We must not neglect a single chance whilst that terrible cry is ever in our ears." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{designs of}} her artwork are both {{abstract}} and realistic and {{are based on}} nature, daily life, and the mythology of her tribes.

60|$|Then {{proclamation}} was made, that <b>they</b> that <b>had</b> aught to say {{for their}} lord the king against the prisoner at the bar, should forthwith appear and give in their evidence.
