Director Singh also drew inspiration from the Italian painter Caravaggio and the video is laden with religious imagery such as Saint Sebastian, the Biblical episode of the Incredulity of Thomas and Hindu deities, portrayed in a series of tableaux.|$|E
5|$|Ann {{discovers that}} her predecessor, Emily Jessel (Lightfoot), {{is buried in}} Bly's church, and is told that Jessel killed herself. She also begins to see the figures {{of a young man}} and a young woman around Bly. Mrs Grose dismisses Ann's stories, but one maid, Carla (Walker), tells Ann of the sexually abusive former valet Peter Quint (MacLiam). Mrs Grose reveals that Carla had been badly {{affected}} by the War, and is prone to flights of fancy. Later, Ann is woken at night by the figure of the woman, and follows her to find Flora standing next to <b>an</b> <b>open</b> <b>window.</b> The pair see Carla fall from the roof, landing near Miles, who is in the garden. Ann rushes outside, and sees the male figure on the roof. Inside again, Mrs Grose assures Ann that she must be confused.|$|E
5|$|On July 19, 1848, {{the morning}} of the first day of convention, the {{organizing}} committee arrived at the Wesleyan Methodist Chapel shortly before ten o'clock on a hot, sunny day to find a crowd gathered outside and the church doors locked—an overlooked detail. Stanton's young nephew Daniel was lifted through <b>an</b> <b>open</b> <b>window</b> so that he could unbar the doors from the inside. Even though the first session had been announced as being exclusively for women, some young children of both sexes had been brought by their mothers, and about 40 men were there expecting to attend. The men were not turned away, but were asked to remain silent. Mary Ann M'Clintock, Jr., 26 years old, was appointed secretary, to take notes.|$|E

5|$|The song {{has been}} well-received, with many complimenting its {{inspirational}} lyrical content, and {{described it as}} <b>an</b> <b>open</b> <b>window</b> into Carey's personal life for listeners. Commercially it was Carey's lowest charting lead single {{to date on the}} US Billboard Hot 100, and her first lead single to that point to not reach the top ten in the United States. Though stalling at number 81, it became successful on the Billboard dance charts, hitting number 1 for a week in the United States.

25|$|Shan shui {{painting}} {{is a kind}} of painting which goes against the common definition of what a {{painting is}}. Shan shui painting refutes color, light and shadow and personal brush work. Shan shui painting is not <b>an</b> <b>open</b> <b>window</b> for the viewer's eye, it is an object for the viewer's mind. Shan shui painting is more like a vehicle of philosophy.|$|E

25|$|The {{black and}} {{camouflage}} clad Chechens took approximately 850–900 people hostage, {{including members of}} the audience and performers, among them an MVD general. The reaction of spectators inside the theater to the news that the theater was under terrorist attack was not uniform: some people remained calm, some reacted hysterically, and others fainted.

25|$|Two bureaucrats, first Bertrand (A) {{and then}} Morvan (B) enter a sixth floor {{apartment}} where they find Croker (C) standing centre stage {{in front of}} <b>an</b> <b>open</b> <b>window</b> {{with his back to}} the audience, clearly on the point of throwing himself out of it. A pair of identical tables, lamps and chairs are there waiting for them, stage left and stage right. The set is therefore symmetrical. The name Croker is an obvious pun on the euphemism, ‘to croak’ i.e. to die, and a name to which Beckett has shown some attachment.|$|E

Craig said that immediately afterwards he ran to where the shooting occurred and saw a man that he later identified as Oswald run down the slope away from the building and get into a green station wagon driven by a man with dark complexion. That same day, Carolyn Walther, a Dallas resident, testified that she observed within <b>an</b> <b>open</b> <b>window</b> of the School Book Depository a man in a white shirt holding a gun accompanied by another man wearing a brown suit coat.|$|E

25|$|The {{clear-cut}} underlying geometric {{framework of}} these works seemingly control the finer elements of the compositions; the constituent components, including the small planes of the faces, {{become part of the}} unified whole. Though Gris certainly had planned the representation of his chosen subject matter, the abstract armature serves as the starting point. The geometric structure of Juan Gris's Crystal period is already palpable in Still Life before <b>an</b> <b>Open</b> <b>Window,</b> Place Ravignan (June 1915). The overlapping elemental planar structure of the composition serves as a foundation to flatten the individual elements onto a unifying surface, foretelling the shape of things to come. In 1919 and particularly 1920, artists and critics began to write conspicuously about this 'synthetic' approach, and asserting its importance in the overall scheme of advanced Cubism.|$|E
25|$|Vermeer's {{mother-in-law}} Maria Thins owned Dirck van Baburen's 1622 oil-on-canvas The Procuress (or {{a copy of}} it), {{which appears}} {{in the background of}} two of Vermeer's paintings. The same subject was also painted by Vermeer. Almost all of Vermeer's paintings are of contemporary subjects in a smaller format, with a cooler palette dominated by blues, yellows, and grays. Practically all of his surviving works belong to this period, usually domestic interiors with one or two figures lit by a window on the left. They are characterized by a sense of compositional balance and spatial order, unified by a pearly light. Mundane domestic or recreational activities are imbued with a poetic timelessness (e.g., Girl Reading a Letter at <b>an</b> <b>Open</b> <b>Window,</b> Dresden, Gemäldegalerie). Vermeer's two townscapes have also been attributed to this period: View of Delft (The Hague, Mauritshuis) and A street in Delft (Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum).|$|E

Within {{a cutting}} a siding {{branches}} {{off the main}} line and runs parallel and {{to the south of}} the main line, rejoining at the west end of the station. A shelter shed with an enclosed office in its south-east corner is located between the siding and the main line. The shed has an earth floor and a hipped roof, and the timber walls and posts are mounted on concrete wall and post bases. The timber framed walls of the office section are single skinned, and are clad with chamferboards. The office has open window frames on the south and west sides, a pivoting timber window to the east side and a timber door on the north side. The main open space of the shed has a single skinned timber wall (with a gap above the concrete wall base) on the south side, which has <b>an</b> <b>open</b> <b>window</b> frame.|$|E

25|$|King Kong {{is often}} used in {{commercial}} culture, for example in advertisements for Coca-Cola and Energizer Batteries. A New York insurance company used clips from the film to persuade people of the hazards of city life. A two-part Energizer Battery commercial had the 1933 Kong himself contracted by a rival battery corporation (SuperVolt) {{to get rid of}} the Energizer Bunny for them. The commercials were done in black-and-white, and used cleverly edited 1933 Kong sequences (possibly combined with new computer-generated Kong shots). The concluding second-part had Kong cornering the Bunny on the roof of a New York City building, complete with biplanes flying in the sky. His foot in <b>an</b> <b>open</b> <b>window</b> interrupts a couple that resemble Ann Darrow and Jack Driscoll having a romantic moment. The woman, extremely annoyed, slams the window on Kong's toes, making him lose his balance and grip, sending him falling. In 1990 Kongfrontation became one of the original rides at Universal Studios Florida.|$|E

500|$|Janeway Lambda one was {{originally}} scheduled to {{debut in the}} teaser of the first-season episode [...] "". Episode director Winrich Kolbe, and visual effects producer Dan Curry, collaborated to create the Gothic novel setting {{through the use of}} second unit blue screen sequences. During a pre-production meeting, Kolbe and Taylor met with special effects coordinator Dick Brownfield, and unit production manager Brad Yacobian, to finalize the set design and to clarify the special effects. Their discussion covered minor actions and effects, such as how much rainwater would be coming through <b>an</b> <b>open</b> <b>window,</b> and whether or not the raindrops on Janeway's clothing would disappear when the simulation ended. Kolbe meticulously planned actors' performances in the teaser sequence, such as researching the proper way of pouring and serving tea according to 1840s customs. According to Poe, attention to such small details in the script was common in the production of Star Trek episodes.|$|E
