5|$|Masaccio {{is often}} {{compared}} to contemporaries like Donatello and Brunelleschi as {{a pioneer of}} the renaissance, particularly for his use of single-point perspective. One technique that was unique to Masaccio, however, {{was the use of}} atmospheric, or aerial perspective. Both the mountains in the background, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> of Peter on the left are dimmer and paler than the objects in the foreground, creating an illusion of depth. This technique was known in ancient Rome, but was considered lost until reinvented by Masaccio.|$|E
5|$|The {{electron}} of the hydrogen-like ununennium atom—oxidized so it {{has only}} one electron, Uue118+—is predicted to move so quickly that its mass is 1.99 times that of a non-moving electron, a feature coming from the relativistic effects. For comparison, the figure for hydrogen-like francium is 1.29 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> for hydrogen-like caesium is 1.091. According to simple extrapolations of relativity laws, that indirectly indicates the contraction of the atomic radius to around 240pm, very close to that of rubidium (247pm); the metallic radius is also correspondingly lowered to 260pm. The ionic radius of Uue+ {{is expected to be}} 180pm.|$|E
5|$|A further {{internal}} diagonal {{passes through}} the space occupied by the Infanta. There is a similar connection between the female dwarf <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> of Velázquez himself, both of whom look towards the viewer from similar angles, creating a visual tension. The face of Velázquez is dimly lit by light that is reflected, rather than direct. For this reason his features, though not as sharply defined, are more visible {{than those of the}} dwarf who is much nearer the light source. This appearance of a total face, full-on to the viewer, draws the attention, and its importance is marked, tonally, by the contrasting frame of dark hair, the light on the hand and brush, and the skilfully placed triangle of light on the artist's sleeve, pointing directly to the face.|$|E

5|$|Captain Edward Smith – Unveiled in July 1914 at {{the western}} end of the Museum Gardens, the statue was sculpted by Kathleen Scott, wife of Antarctic {{explorer}} Robert Scott. The pedestal is made from Cornish granite <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> is bronze. This is a memorial to the captain of the RMS Titanic, which sank on 15 April 1912. Captain Smith was from Hanley and Lichfield was chosen as the location for the monument because Smith was a Staffordshire man and Lichfield was the centre of the diocese. The statue originally cost £740 raised through local and national contributions. In 2010, as part of the 'Parks for People' programme, the statue was restored and the green patina removed from its surface at a cost of £16,000. In 2011 an unsuccessful campaign was started to get the statue moved back to Captain Smith's home town of Hanley.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{stabilization}} of its outer 8s electrons, unbinilium's first ionization energy—the energy required to remove an electron from a neutral atom—is predicted to be 6.0eV, {{comparable to that}} of calcium. The electron of the hydrogen-like unbinilium atom—oxidized so it has only one electron, Ubn119+—is predicted to move so quickly that its mass is 2.05 times that of a non-moving electron, a feature coming from the relativistic effects. For comparison, the figure for hydrogen-like radium is 1.30 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> for hydrogen-like barium is 1.095. According to simple extrapolations of relativity laws, that indirectly indicates the contraction of the atomic radius to around 200pm, very close to that of strontium (215pm); the ionic radius of the Ubn2+ ion is also correspondingly lowered to 160pm. The trend in electron affinity is also expected to reverse direction similarly at radium and unbinilium.|$|E
5|$|In The Orrery, all the {{subjects}} {{have been identified}} apart from the philosopher, who has physical similarities to Isaac Newton but differs enough to make positive identification impossible. Nicolson detects the strong influence of Frye throughout the picture. Particularly striking is the similarity between Frye's mezzotint Portrait of a Young Man of 1760–1761 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> of the boy with his head cocked staring intently at the bird. In 1977, Michael Wynne published one of Frye's chalk drawings from around 1760, An old man leaning on a staff, which is so similar to the observer in the right foreground in Wright's picture to make it impossible that Wright had not seen it. There are other hints of Frye's style in the painting: even {{the figure of the}} natural philosopher has touches of Frye's Figure with Candle. Though Henry Fuseli would later also develop on the style of Frye's work {{there is no evidence of}} him having painted anything similar until the early 1780s. So, although he had already been in England at the time the Air Pump was produced, it is unlikely that he was an influence on Wright.|$|E

5|$|Parallels {{have been}} pointed out between Njörðr <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> of Hadingus, attested in book I of Saxo Grammaticus' 13th century work Gesta Danorum. Some of these {{similarities}} include that, in parallel to Skaði and Njörðr in Skáldskaparmál, Hadingus is chosen by his wife Regnhild after selecting him from other men at a banquet by his lower legs, and, in parallel to Skaði and Njörðr in Gylfaginning, Hadingus complains in verse of his displeasure at his life away from the sea and how he is disturbed by the howls of wolves, while his wife Regnhild complains of life at the shore and states her annoyance at the screeching sea birds. Georges Dumézil theorized that in the tale Hadingus passes through all three functions of his trifunctional hypothesis, before ending as an Odinic hero, paralleling Njörðr's passing from the Vanir to the Æsir in the Æsir-Vanir War.|$|E
5|$|The Burnside Fountain is a non-functioning {{drinking}} fountain at {{the southeast corner}} of Worcester Common in Worcester, Massachusetts. It consists of two parts, a pink granite basin, and a bronze statue of a young boy riding a sea turtle. The basin was designed by architect Henry Bacon, who later designed the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> was created by sculptor Charles Y. Harvey. Harvey committed suicide before finishing the sculpture, and Sherry Fry completed the bronze. The Burnside Fountain was commissioned in 1905 by the city of Worcester after Harriet F. Burnside bequeathed US $5,000 to create a fountain to provide fresh water for people, horses and dogs, in the memory of her father, a prominent lawyer. The fountain was installed in 1912 in Central Square, then moved in 1969 to its current location on Worcester Common. In 1970 the statue was stolen, and was re-installed two years later. An attempted theft occurred in 2004.|$|E
