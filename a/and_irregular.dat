5|$|The HDF galaxies {{contained}} a considerably {{larger proportion of}} disturbed <b>and</b> <b>irregular</b> galaxies than the local universe; galaxy collisions and mergers were {{more common in the}} young universe as it was much smaller than today.

5|$|A common {{feature of}} the core syndromes is chorea: {{involuntary}} dance-like movements. In neuroacanthocytosis, this is particularly prominent {{in the face and}} mouth which can cause difficulties with speech and eating.

5|$|At {{least two}} pairs of {{interacting}} galaxies have been observed. Arp107 {{is a pair of}} galaxies in the process of merging, located 450million light-years away.

5|$|Due to {{tidal force}} from Jupiter and Amalthea's low density <b>and</b> <b>irregular</b> shape, the escape {{velocity}} at its surface points closest to and furthest from Jupiter {{is no more}} than 1 m/s and dust can easily escape from it after, e.g. micrometeorite impacts; this dust forms the Amalthea Gossamer Ring.|$|E
5|$|In 1086, 7- and 10-point girih {{patterns}} (with heptagons, 5- and 6-pointed stars, triangles <b>and</b> <b>irregular</b> hexagons) {{appear in}} the Friday Mosque at Isfahan. 10-point girih became widespread in the Islamic world, except in the Spanish Al-Andalus. Soon afterwards, sweeping 9-, 11-, and 13-point girih patterns {{were used in the}} Barsian Mosque, also in Persia, in 1098; these, like 7-point geometrical patterns, are rarely used outside Persia and central Asia.|$|E
5|$|Juno was {{originally}} considered a planet, along with 1 Ceres, 2 Pallas, and 4 Vesta. In 1811, Schröter estimated Juno {{to be as}} large as 2290km in diameter.

5|$|Observation of Neptune in the {{radio-frequency}} band {{shows that}} it is a source of both continuous emission <b>and</b> <b>irregular</b> bursts. Both sources are thought to originate from its rotating magnetic field. In the infrared part of the spectrum, Neptune's storms appear bright against the cooler background, allowing {{the size and shape of}} these features to be readily tracked.|$|E
5|$|Side {{effects of}} {{dopamine}} include {{negative effects on}} kidney function <b>and</b> <b>irregular</b> heartbeats. The LD50, or lethal dose {{which is expected to}} prove fatal in 50% of the population, has been found to be: 59mg/kg (mouse; administered intravenously); 95mg/kg (mouse; administered intraperitoneally); 163mg/kg (rat; administered intraperitoneally); 79mg/kg (dog; administered intravenously).|$|E
5|$|Sorabji {{was also}} {{influenced}} by Eastern culture.

5000|$|The de Vaucouleurs system retains Hubble’s basic {{division}} of galaxies into ellipticals, lenticulars, spirals <b>and</b> <b>irregulars.</b> To complement Hubble’s scheme, de Vaucouleurs introduced a more elaborate classification system for spiral galaxies, based on three morphological characteristics: ...|$|R
500|$|After the ceasefire was signed, {{hostilities}} did {{not immediately}} end. Noting that civilians were fleeing before advancing Russian tanks, soldiers <b>and</b> <b>irregulars,</b> a reporter for The Guardian wrote on 13 August that [...] "the idea there is a ceasefire is ridiculous".|$|R

5|$|The light {{infantry}} of 1,200 velites {{consisted of}} unarmoured skirmishing troops {{drawn from the}} youngest and lower social classes. They were armed with a sword and buckler (90cm (3ft) diameter), {{as well as several}} light javelins, each with a 90cm (3ft) wooden shaft the diameter of a finger, with a c.25cm (10in) narrow metal point. Their numbers were swollen by the addition of allied light infantry <b>and</b> <b>irregular</b> rorarii.|$|E
5|$|The {{outlines}} of an animal's body {{can be made}} hard to see by other methods, such as by using a highly irregular outline. For example, the comma butterfly, Polygonia c-album, is highly cryptic when its wings are closed, with cryptic colours, disruptive pattern, <b>and</b> <b>irregular</b> outer margins to the wings.|$|E
5|$|Altitudinal {{migration}} {{is a form}} of short distance migration in which birds spend the breeding season at higher altitudes and move to lower ones during suboptimal conditions. It is most often triggered by temperature changes and usually occurs when the normal territories also become inhospitable due to lack of food. Some species may also be nomadic, holding no fixed territory and moving according to weather and food availability. Parrots as a family are overwhelmingly neither migratory nor sedentary but considered to either be dispersive, irruptive, nomadic or undertake small <b>and</b> <b>irregular</b> migrations.|$|E
5000|$|Despite the victory, Korean {{irregular}} leaders {{argued over}} the credits for the battle and {{relationships between the}} Buddhist monks <b>and</b> <b>irregulars</b> fell. With Chongju secured, Korean forces were able to attack Japanese positions but failed. The internal fighting led to the defeat and total annihilation at Kumsan.|$|R
5000|$|Edwin Hubble {{created the}} first galaxy {{classification}} scheme known as the Hubble tuning-fork diagram.

50|$|Under {{the terms}} of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, the Treaty had to be {{ratified}} by popular vote and the Second Dail had decided that the 16 June 1922 general election, campaigned on the Treaty, would be that ratification. By April there were increasing clashes between government troops <b>and</b> <b>irregulars</b> <b>and,</b> in late April, Lynch attended public rallies with Michael Collins in Killarney and Tralee to argue for the Treaty, despite significant harassment from anti-treaty activists.|$|R
5|$|In August 2005, Glover {{was sentenced}} to 240 hours {{community}} service by St Helens magistrates after admitting claiming £14,831 in welfare benefits between August 2002 and November 2004 while posing for newspapers and magazines. She stated {{that she did not}} know the small <b>and</b> <b>irregular</b> earnings would make a difference to her benefits, and that she had been sometimes too depressed to leave her flat. While performing the community service in 2006, she was assaulted twice by a group of girls, one attack leaving her with a broken nose. This cost her a month of modelling work, and contributed to her depression, but also to her taking kickboxing classes to learn to defend herself.|$|E
5|$|Like the House of the Lake, most {{houses in}} the crowded Theatre Quarter of Delos have irregular-shaped floor plans (such as {{trapezoidal}} designs), as opposed to square or rectangular designs. The narrow <b>and</b> <b>irregular</b> street grid is unlike that of other quarters, where streets usually meet at approximately right angles. Similar {{to the majority of}} excavated homes of Delos, those in the Theatre Quarter feature an open courtyard without porticoes, instead of the peristyle layout with columns. Some of the {{houses in the}} Theatre Quarter lack interior decoration altogether, with neither wall murals nor mosaics, which is unusual for most Delian homes.|$|E
5|$|The Castaing {{machine is}} a device used to add {{lettering}} and decoration {{to the edge}} of a coin. Such lettering was necessitated by counterfeiting and edge clipping, which was a common problem resulting from the uneven <b>and</b> <b>irregular</b> hammered coinage. When Aubin Olivier introduced milled coinage to France, he also developed a method of marking the edges with lettering which would make it possible to detect if metal had been shaved from the edge. This method involved using a collar, into which the metal flowed from the pressure of the press. This technique was slower and more costly than later methods. France abandoned milled coinage in favour of hammering in 1585.|$|E
