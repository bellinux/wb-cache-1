However, these results were mostly ignored until 1860, partly due to the belief that atoms of one element would have no chemical affinity toward atoms of the same element, and partly due to apparent exceptions to <b>Avogadro's</b> <b>law</b> that were not explained until later in terms of dissociating molecules.|$|R

50|$|Unfortunately, related {{experiments}} with some inorganic substances showed seeming {{exceptions to the}} law. This was finally resolved by Stanislao Cannizzaro, as announced at Karlsruhe Congress in 1860, four years after Avogadro's death. He explained that these exceptions were due to molecular dissociations at certain temperatures, and that <b>Avogadro's</b> <b>law</b> determined not only molecular masses, but atomic masses as well.|$|R

50|$|He was {{a pioneer}} in {{photography}} {{and contributed to the}} <b>Avogadro's</b> gas <b>law</b> by proposing that some elements form diatomic or polyatomic gas.|$|R
50|$|In the 1860s Stanislao Cannizzaro refined {{relative}} atomic masses {{by applying}} <b>Avogadro's</b> <b>law</b> (notably at the Karlsruhe Congress of 1860). He formulated {{a law to}} determine relative atomic masses of elements: the different quantities of the same element contained in different molecules are all whole multiples of the atomic weight and determined relative atomic masses and molecular masses by comparing the vapor density {{of a collection of}} gases with molecules containing {{one or more of the}} chemical element in question.|$|R
5000|$|Lorenzo Romano Amedeo Carlo Avogadro, (...) Count of Quaregna and Cerreto (9 August 17769 July 1856), was an Italian scientist, most {{noted for}} his {{contribution}} to molecular theory now known as <b>Avogadro's</b> <b>law,</b> which states that equal volumes of gases under the same conditions of temperature and pressure will contain equal numbers of molecules. In tribute to him, the number of elementary entities (atoms, molecules, ions or other particles) in 1 mole of a substance, , {{is known as the}} Avogadro constant, one of the seven SI base units and represented by NA.|$|R
5000|$|The law of {{combining}} volumes states that, when gases react {{together to form}} other gases, and when all volumes are measured at the same temperature and pressure:The ratio between the volumes of the reactant gases and the gaseous products can be expressed in simple whole numbers.For example, Gay-Lussac found that 2 volumes of hydrogen and 1 volume of oxygen would react to form 2 volumes of gaseous water. Based on Gay-Lussac's results, Amedeo Avogadro theorized that, at the same temperature and pressure, equal volumes of gas contain equal numbers of molecules (<b>Avogadro's</b> <b>law).</b> This hypothesis meant that the previously stated result ...|$|R
50|$|The {{addition}} of water vapor to air (making the air humid) reduces {{the density of}} the air, which may at first appear counter-intuitive.This occurs because the molar mass of water (18 g/mol) is less than the molar mass of dry air (around 29 g/mol). For any gas, at a given temperature and pressure, the number of molecules present is constant for a particular volume (see <b>Avogadro's</b> <b>Law).</b> So when water molecules (water vapor) are added to a given volume of air, the dry air molecules must decrease by the same number, to keep the pressure or temperature from increasing. Hence the mass per unit volume of the gas (its density) decreases.|$|R
5|$|John Dalton's {{original}} atomic hypothesis {{presumed that}} all elements were monatomic {{and that the}} atoms in compounds would normally have the simplest atomic ratios with respect to one another. For example, Dalton assumed that water's formula was HO, giving the atomic mass of oxygen was 8 times that of hydrogen, instead of the modern value of about 16. In 1805, Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and Alexander von Humboldt showed that water is formed of two volumes of hydrogen and one volume of oxygen; and by 1811 Amedeo Avogadro {{had arrived at the}} correct interpretation of water's composition, based on what is now called <b>Avogadro's</b> <b>law</b> and the diatomic elemental molecules in those gases.|$|R
5|$|The flaw in Dalton's {{theory was}} {{corrected}} in principle in 1811 by Amedeo Avogadro. Avogadro had proposed that equal volumes of any two gases, at equal temperature and pressure, contain {{equal numbers of}} molecules (in other words, the mass of a gas's particles {{does not affect the}} volume that it occupies). <b>Avogadro's</b> <b>law</b> allowed him to deduce the diatomic nature of numerous gases by studying the volumes at which they reacted. For instance: since two liters of hydrogen will react with just one liter of oxygen to produce two liters of water vapor (at constant pressure and temperature), it meant a single oxygen molecule splits in two in order to form two particles of water. Thus, Avogadro was able to offer more accurate estimates of the atomic mass of oxygen and various other elements, and made a clear distinction between molecules and atoms.|$|R
40|$|The core {{objective}} {{of a chemical}} composition measurement is to determine its true value. How-ever, when measuring the composition of a macroscopic sample {{with a large number}} of atoms or molecules, realizing the true value of the measurand at both the macroscopic and microscopic lev-els remains an unsolved theoretical problem. We find that the true value of a sample composition exists in any subsample of a homogeneous molecular population of the sample. Here, we propose the Central Law of Measurement of the Amount of Substance: “The homogeneity of a sample mo-lecular population represents the measurement accuracy of the sample composition in an ana-lytical procedure”. The Central Law is based on a homogeneous molecular population axiom in which the molecular composition of a sample is identical for any homogeneous subsample. Fur-thermore, we point out that, at the microscopic scale, <b>Avogadro’s</b> <b>law</b> does not hold true...|$|R
25|$|There are {{two parts}} to Einstein's theory: {{the first part}} {{consists}} {{in the formulation of}} a diffusion equation for Brownian particles, in which the diffusion coefficient is related to the mean squared displacement of a Brownian particle, while the second part consists in relating the diffusion coefficient to measurable physical quantities. In this way Einstein was able to determine the size of atoms, and how many atoms there are in a mole, or the molecular weight in grams, of a gas. In accordance to <b>Avogadro's</b> <b>law</b> this volume is the same for all ideal gases, which is 22.414 liters at standard temperature and pressure. The number of atoms contained in this volume is referred to as Avogadro's constant, and the determination of this number is tantamount to the knowledge of the mass of an atom since the latter is obtained by dividing the mass of a mole of the gas by Avogadro's constant.|$|R
