40|$|This paper {{examines}} the incremental effect <b>of</b> <b>overcompensation</b> {{as compared to}} simple compensation on post-complaint satisfaction. In overcompensation, consumers {{are entitled to a}} refund that is more than the purchase price, whereas in simple compensation, the refund given is equivalent to if not less than the purchase price. A meta-analysis of 17 experimental studies shows that overcompensation has a substantially lower incremental effect on post-complaint satisfaction than simple compensation. However, when distinguishing between transaction-specific satisfaction and cumulative satisfaction, the smaller effect size <b>of</b> <b>overcompensation</b> mainly holds true for transaction-specific satisfaction. For cumulative satisfaction, the effect size <b>of</b> <b>overcompensation</b> is only marginally smaller. While counter-intuitive, these results appear to have a basis in three established theoretical frameworks, namely the Weber-Fechner law, prospect theory, and the different phenomenologies of the two satisfaction constructs. Implications are discussed for marketing research as well as for complaint management. Areas for future research are also explored...|$|R

40|$|Risk {{homeostasis}} theory (RHT) {{suggests that}} changes {{made to the}} intrinsic risk of environments are negated {{in one of three}} ways: behavioural adjustments within the environment, mode migration, and <b>avoidance</b> <b>of</b> the physical risk. To date, this three-way model of RHT has little empirical support, whilst research findings on RHT have at times been diametrically opposed. A reconciliation of apparently opposing findings might be possible by suggesting that extrinsic compensation fails to restore previously existing levels of actual risk in cases where behavioural adjustments within the environment are incapable of negating intrinsic risk changes. This paper reports a study in which behavioural adjustments within the physical risk-taking environment are capable of reconciling target with actual risk. The results provide positive support for RHT in the form <b>of</b> <b>overcompensation</b> for the intrinsic risk change on specific driver behaviours. <br/...|$|R

40|$|The present paper {{examines}} the effectiveness <b>of</b> financial <b>overcompensation</b> {{as a means}} to enhance customer loyalty after a product failure. Overcompensation implies that customers are entitled to a refund that is larger than the purchase price. It is, however, still unclear whether large overcompensations entail saturation effects, or alternatively, result in an actual drop in customer loyalty. We predicted that the overcompensation-loyalty relationship is generally characterized by an inverted U-shaped function. In line with this prediction, the results of four studies showed that mild overcompensations had, on average, a positive effect on customer loyalty beyond equal compensation, but only up to compensation levels of approximately 150 % of the purchase price of faulty products. Beyond this level, the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>overcompensation</b> diminished, eventually leading to a general drop in customer loyalty. Despite this overall pattern, two studies revealed robust individual differences in how customers react to increasing <b>overcompensation.</b> A majority <b>of</b> customers increased their loyalty when the overcompensation enlarged, but the curve flattened out in the high range. However, there was also a smaller portion of customers who reacted negatively to every form <b>of</b> <b>overcompensation.</b> A practical implication of these findings, therefore, is that companies should not offer compensations that are greater than 150 % of the initial price, as these do not contribute to greater loyalty in any category of customers...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: <b>Avoidance</b> <b>of</b> {{activity}} is hypothesized {{to lead to}} muscle weakness and consequently, to physical disability. This study was undertaken to validate the avoidance model by providing evidence for the mediating role of muscle weakness {{in the relationship between}} <b>avoidance</b> <b>of</b> activity and physical disability in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. METHODS: Data on <b>avoidance</b> <b>of</b> activity, observed physical disability, and muscle strength of the knee in 107 patients with knee OA were analyzed. A series of regression analyses was performed to establish the mediating role of muscle weakness. First, the effect <b>of</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>of</b> activity on the level of disability was assessed. Next, the relationship between <b>avoidance</b> <b>of</b> activity and muscle strength was established. Finally, the mediating role of muscle strength could be established if the effect <b>of</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>of</b> activity on disability decreased when muscle strength was taken into account. RESULTS: Initially, <b>avoidance</b> <b>of</b> activity accounted for 21. 5 % of variance in disability. <b>Avoidance</b> <b>of</b> activity also accounted for 3. 9 % of variance in muscle strength. After muscle strength was taken into account, the variance in disability accounted for by <b>avoidance</b> <b>of</b> activity was reduced from 21. 5 % to 15. 7 %. Thus, the criteria for establishing the mediating role of muscle strength were met. CONCLUSION: The results of this study provide evidence for the mediating role of muscle weakness in the relationship between <b>avoidance</b> <b>of</b> activity and disability in patients with knee OA.

40|$|Some {{efforts to}} reduce {{invasive}} populations have paradoxically led to population increases. This phenomenon, referred to as overcompensation, occurs when reduced intraspecific pressures increase juvenile survival or maturation rates, leading to increased population size. Overcompensation in response to eradication efforts could derail management efforts, {{so it would be}} beneficial to evaluate the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>overcompensation</b> prior to removal. We conducted a series of experiments to examine the potential for <b>overcompensation</b> <b>of</b> a non-native population of the European green crab, Carcinus maenas, which was being removed in Bodega Harbor, California. First, we examined the impact of adults on juvenile survival by measuring adult cannibalism on juveniles in the presence and absence of alternative prey, and the survival of tethered juveniles at varying adult densities. Second, we examined how adult presence affected juvenile short-term foraging and growth rates. Although adult presence reduced juvenile short-term foraging, we detected only minimal cannibalism and found no evidence that adults greatly reduce juvenile growth or survivorship. These results suggest that overcompensation is not likely to occur in this population in response to removal. We assessed this prediction using pre- and post-removal surveys of juvenile recruitment in Bodega Harbor compared to nearby populations, testing for evidence <b>of</b> <b>overcompensation.</b> Relative juvenile abundance did not statistically increase in removal compared to reference populations, consistent with our conclusion from the experiments. This experimental approach which focuses on an organism’s population biology provides a tool to assess capacity for assessing the capacity for overcompensation in management strategies for invasive species...|$|R

Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) analyses were used to evaluate mediation. ResultsIn patients with knee OA, reduced knee extensor muscle strength mediated the relationship between <b>avoidance</b> <b>of</b> activity and limitations in activities. In patients with hip OA reduced hip abductor muscle strength mediates the relationship between <b>avoidance</b> <b>of</b> activity and limitations in activities.

40|$|Abstract Background Fear <b>of</b> {{falling and}} <b>avoidance</b> <b>of</b> {{activity}} {{are common in}} old age and are suggested to be (public) health problems of equal importance to falls. Earlier studies of correlates of fear <b>of</b> falling and <b>avoidance</b> <b>of</b> activity did hardly differentiate between severe and mild levels of fear <b>of</b> falling and <b>avoidance</b> <b>of</b> activity which may be relevant from clinical point of view. Furthermore, most studies focused only on socio-demographics and/or health-related variables and hardly incorporated an extensive range of potential correlates of fear of falling including psychosocial variables. This study analyzes the univariate and multivariate associations between five socio-demographic, seven health-related and six psychosocial variables and levels of fear <b>of</b> falling and <b>avoidance</b> <b>of</b> activity in older persons who avoid activity due to fear of falling. Methods Cross-sectional study in 540 community-living older people aged ≥ 70 years with at least mild fear <b>of</b> falling and <b>avoidance</b> <b>of</b> activity. Chi-squares, t-tests and logistics regression analyses were performed to study the associations between the selected correlates and both outcomes. Results Old age, female sex, limitations in activity of daily living, impaired vision, poor perceived health, chronic morbidity, falls, low general self-efficacy, low mastery, loneliness, feelings of anxiety and symptoms of depression were identified as univariate correlates of severe fear <b>of</b> falling and <b>avoidance</b> <b>of</b> activity. Female sex, limitations in activity of daily living and one or more falls in the previous six months correlated independently with severe fear of falling. Higher age and limitations in activity of daily living correlated independently with severe <b>avoidance</b> <b>of</b> activity. Conclusion Psychosocial variables did not contribute independently {{to the difference between}} mild and severe fear of falling and to the difference between mild and severe <b>avoidance</b> <b>of</b> activity due to fear of falling. Although knowledge about the unique associations of specific variables with levels of severe fear <b>of</b> falling and <b>avoidance</b> <b>of</b> activity is of interest for theoretical reasons, knowledge of univariate association may also help to specify the concepts for developing interventions and programmes to reduce fear <b>of</b> falling and <b>avoidance</b> <b>of</b> activity in old age, particularly in their early stages of development. </p...|$|R
