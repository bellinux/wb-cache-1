25|$|At low refresh rates (60Hz and below), the {{periodic}} scanning {{of the display}} may produce <b>a</b> <b>flicker</b> that some people perceive more easily than others, especially when viewed with peripheral vision. Flicker is commonly associated with CRT as most televisions run at 50Hz (PAL) or 60Hz (NTSC), {{although there are some}} 100Hz PAL televisions that are flicker-free. Typically only low-end monitors run at such low frequencies, with most computer monitors supporting at least 75Hz and high-end monitors capable of 100Hz or more to eliminate any perception of flicker. Non-computer CRTs or CRT for sonar or radar may have long persistence phosphor and are thus flicker free. If the persistence is too long on a video display, moving images will be blurred.|$|E
500|$|The {{writing process}} for Fantasy Black Channel was largely unplanned. The verses of [...] "Broken" [...] were {{conceived}} {{late at night}} and are inspired by insomnia. It took Eastgate a long time to describe how he was feeling [...] "in a way that sounded original" [...] for such a common theme in pop music. The lyrics in the chorus are about the first time Late of the Pier drove to London and got lost. [...] "Space and the Woods" [...] tries to weigh up what is more important: a person or an inanimate object, or an absence of anything, while [...] "The Bears Are Coming" [...] concerns [...] "a silent threat". The idea for the lyric [...] "A heartbeat, <b>a</b> <b>flicker,</b> a line" [...] in [...] "Heartbeat" [...] came to Eastgate while recording the song and hearing its time signature always changing.|$|E
500|$|The Bunnygraphs, as a genre, were {{representative}} of the cinema of the period, and were very successful, making Bunny the first American comic film star and Finch the first female star comedian. A Cure for Pokeritis, released February 23, 1912, was individually well-received, including in showings outside the United States. The Thames Star, a New Zealand newspaper, described the film as [...] "screamingly funny". After John Bunny's death, interest in his films led Vitagraph in 1917 to announce the re-release of this film (retitled A Sure Cure for Pokeritis), along with many of his other works, as [...] "Favorite Film Features". However, the comedy style of A Cure for Pokeritis has not aged well, especially in contrast to Mack Sennett's slapstick films and the works of later comedians such as Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. According to film scholars Donald McCaffrey and Christopher Jacobs, modern viewers [...] "will hardly get <b>a</b> <b>flicker</b> of a smile" [...] from the film, despite the skill of its actors.|$|E

500|$|Hartmann's last kill {{occurred}} over Brno, Czechoslovakia, on 8 May, {{the last day}} of the war in Europe. Early that morning, he was ordered to fly a reconnaissance mission and report the position of Soviet forces. Hartmann took off with his wingman at 08:30 and spotted the first Soviet units just [...] away. Passing over the area, Hartmann saw two Yak-9s performing aerobatics for the Soviet columns. Determined to [...] "spoil the party", Hartmann dove upon the fighters from his vantage point at [...] and shot one down from a range of [...] As he lined up the second fighter, Hartmann noticed <b>a</b> <b>flicker</b> of shiny dots above him coming from the West; they were P-51s. Rather than make a stand and be caught between the Soviets and the Americans, Hartmann and his wingman fled at low level into the pall of smoke that covered Brno. When he landed, Hartmann learned that the Soviet forces were within artillery range of the airfield, so JG52 destroyed Karaya One, 24 other Bf109s, and large quantities of ammunition. Hartmann later recalled his final violent action of the war: ...|$|E
2500|$|Electronic {{ballasts}} usually {{supply power}} to the lamp at a frequency of [...] or higher, rather than the mains frequency of this substantially eliminates the stroboscopic effect of flicker, {{a product of the}} line frequency associated with fluorescent lighting (see photosensitive epilepsy). The high output frequency of an electronic ballast refreshes the phosphors in a fluorescent lamp so rapidly that there is no perceptible flicker. The flicker index, used for measuring perceptible light modulation, has a range from 0.00 to 1.00, with 0 indicating the lowest possibility of flickering and 1 indicating the highest. Lamps operated on magnetic ballasts have <b>a</b> <b>flicker</b> index between 0.04â€“0.07 while digital ballasts have <b>a</b> <b>flicker</b> index of below 0.01.|$|E
