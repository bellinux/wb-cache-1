5000|$|... 3- Metal Leaching and Acid Rock Drainage - Modern {{industrial}} scale mining of copper based ore bodies can release heavy metals (ML) and Acid Rock Drainage (ARD), into surface and groundwater. The naturally occurring sulphuric content of rock reacts with {{exposure to water}} and air to produce sulphuric acid. Both of these processes are accelerated by the crushing and refining of the ore body {{through the process of}} mining. Open pit mining, in particular, requires the processing of tremendous quantities of waste rock and overburden to access the comparatively small grades of ore contained in the deposit. Lastly, the presence of sulphuric acid accelerates the leaching of toxic metals. The entire process is called ML/ARD, and is presently the single greatest <b>adverse</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>effect</b> of mining in accordance with modern industrial standards. The effects of ML/ARD are difficult to predict, and tend to arise decades after the commencement of a mines operation, and can produce lasting, chronic, and sometimes irremediable environmental damage. Often, the corporate entity that developed the mine has ceased to exist by the time problems arise, and the bonding and securities required of the proponent by government are insufficient to remedy or mitigate the damages. The costs are borne by tax payers and local residents and future generations. The Kemess North Joint Review Panel final analysis concluded : “The Panel believes that the creation of a long-term legacy of substantial mine site management and maintenance obligations,lasting for thousands of years, represents a major imposition on future generations.”, On March 7, 2008, the Government of Canada and the Province of British Columbia announced that they will accept the recommendation of an independent environmental assessment panel that the proposed Kemess North copper-gold mine should not proceed in its present form., ...|$|E

Through experimental results on a bird image dataset, we show {{the effectiveness of the}} method for scale-aware object detection.|$|E
40|$|Abstract-The {{need for}} {{adequate}} roofing {{in developing countries}} is a vital problem for so many people. The solution of this problem is often linked to the import of iron sheets. The increasing economic burden that many less developed countries have to carry {{makes it harder to}} meet vital needs, such as roofing, by means of import. The efforts to find appropriate solutions based on locally available raw materials have thus become more and more important. The cost of conventional materials is too high; a considerable amount of this cost is due to the price of energy for manufacturing and to transportation costs, some materials such as cement poses <b>adverse</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>effect.</b> There is need therefore to provide alternative materials that are locally available, materials that can reverse the <b>adverse</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>effect</b> caused by excessive use of Portland cement and finally, materials that have small energy demand. The overall objective of this research was to assess the suitability of uncalcined termite clay powder partial replacement in cement for use in roofing tile for housing. For this termite clay powder replacement levels of 0 %, 10 %, 20 %, 30 % and 40 % by weight of Ordinary Portland Cement was carried out to determine setting times, compressive strength, flexural strength and absorption rate. The chemical analysis of uncalcined termite clay soil obtained from Bondo district, Usigu sub location, Nduru village in Siaya County was found to be chemically suitable as pozzolanic material (SiO 2 +Al 2 O 3 +Fe 2 O 3 = 93. 053 > 70) required as stipulated by the ASTM C 618 standard. The optimal replacement level for termite clay soil was determined to be 10 % replacement in cement achieving compressive strength of 44. 9 N/mm 2, flexural strength of 6. 5 N/mm 2 and absorption rat...|$|E
30|$|Assessment of the {{potential}} adverse effects of a GMP on NTOs {{is a key element}} of the ERA. Its quality significantly depends on the careful identification of potentially exposed NTOs and meaningful testing in different containment steps. Concepts have been developed on how to select organisms from the receiving environments which would not dramatically increase the complexity of the ERA but significantly increase the scientific rigour and robustness of the results obtained [41, 49]. These concepts comprise an exposure assessment, the selection of functional groups and the classification according to their biological functions. The goal is to focus on species which have an important functional role in a particular cropping system. Impacts on those species by GMP cultivation would actually result in an <b>adverse</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>effect.</b> The selected organisms should be used in toxicological tests in the laboratory, in the greenhouse or in field studies using the whole plant [50 – 52].|$|E

This unique spectral information is used to characterize the features of green vegetation.

This paper describes the operation of multispectral (Crop Circle and CROPSCAN™) and hyper spectral sensors (ASD Field Spec® Pro) to explore the pasture quality and quantity.

The trait in the Bt maize is insect resistance designed to act against particular target lepidopteran pests through Bt protein expressed throughout the maize plant. The risk of an <b>adverse</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>effect</b> occurs through Bt maize pollen deposition on the leaves of the host plants of those susceptible NT lepidopteran larvae and subsequent unintended ingestion of pollen by larvae at a sensitive life stage. The EFSA publications [2, 3] were particularly concerned to quantify the risk to Lepidoptera of conservation concern in protected habitats. The main text of this response deals with general issues which Kruse-Plass et al. have failed to understand; more detailed refutations of each of their claims are given in Additional file 1.|$|E

Suspended sediment is pollutant of primary concern to the river that results in <b>adverse</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>effect.</b> Detention pond becomes a practical approach to this problem. Suspended sediment that settled in stormwater detention pond, can bring effect to the detention pond functions. Questions were raised on how certain were the observed and predicted values of sediment depth and load accumulation estimations. Secondly the question was what the sediment accumulation be in the next 100 years. The uncertainties of sediments estimation vary greatly due to the hydrological variability and rainfall random nature obtain the relationship between flow discharge and suspended sediment rate using on-site data collection at UTM and Ledang Heights, Nusajaya. Predict accumulated sediment loads and depth from MUSLE over 10 - 100 years. Analyze the uncertainties of sediment loads and depth using Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) combining normal distribution.

40|$|Quality {{of water}} in shrimp culture ponds depends on several physical, {{chemical}} and biological processes. In this study, the physico-chemical characteristics of water and sediment samples from inlet, pond and outlet of a traditional shrimp culture pond, locally called as bheri, were examined for nine months from March to November 2011. Majority of the physicochemical parameters of bheri were well within the optimum levels. The average BOD values in pond water and outlet water were 2. 03 ppm and 2. 33 ppm, respectively. In pond water, the levels of ammonia were from 0. 012 to 0. 033 ppm, which was well within the safe level (< 0. 1 ppm). The present study recorded low levels of nitrite (0. 0037 to 0. 0043 ppm) and nitrate (0. 056 - 0. 091 ppm) in pond water, which was within the safe levels recommended for shrimp farming. These physicochemical parameters {{did not affect the}} cultured shrimp as there was no incidence of diseases or growth retardation during the culture period.
