5|$|A {{drawback}} to the <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{a lot of}} time can be spent waiting for each course to dry.|$|E
5|$|According to critics, the {{inherent}} {{problem with this}} <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it relied heavily upon an assumption that Michelangelo only painted buon fresco, that he was always satisfied with the result {{at the end of}} the day, and that in four and a half years spent on the ceiling, he stuck exclusively to one approach, and never made small alterations or added details. Arguimbau, on his website, quotes Colalucci, the head of the team, as contradicting himself on this matter.|$|E
5|$|Rowlands {{argues that}} {{the problem with the}} book's central <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it assumes that all {{interests}} have a clear relation to welfare and thus moral considerability; an assumption which, he argues, is partially undermined by the introduction of biological interests. Jon Jensen, who reviewed the book for Ethics and the Environment, raised a similar worry, arguing that Varner did not sufficiently justify his claim that biological interests are inherently morally significant.|$|E
30|$|The main {{inconvenient}} of such <b>approaches</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{they require}} {{the help of}} Laban concepts experts, in order to annotate the corpuses and come to a ground truth.|$|R
5000|$|One of the {{simplest}} and most common <b>approaches</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of changing one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT or OAT), to see what effect this produces on the output. OAT customarily involves ...|$|R
30|$|The three {{approaches}} named preemptive routing, signal strength-based LM and ATRA {{are based}} on signal strength to tackle route failure. The significance of these three <b>approaches</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they inform the sender of route failure before it occurs.|$|R
5|$|Universal supports. In a more recent, more convenient, {{and more}} widely used method, the {{synthesis}} {{starts with the}} universal support where a non-nucleosidic linker {{is attached to the}} solid support material (compounds 1 and 2). A phosphoramidite respective to the 3'-terminal nucleoside residue is coupled to the universal solid support in the first synthetic cycle of oligonucleotide chain assembly using the standard protocols. The chain assembly is then continued until the completion, after which the solid support-bound oligonucleotide is deprotected. The characteristic feature of the universal solid supports is that the release of the oligonucleotides occurs by the hydrolytic cleavage of a P-O bond that attaches the 3’-O of the 3’-terminal nucleotide residue to the universal linker as shown in Scheme 6. The critical advantage of this <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the same solid support is used irrespectively of the sequence of the oligonucleotide to be synthesized. For the complete removal of the linker and the 3'-terminal phosphate from the assembled oligonucleotide, the solid support 1 and several similar solid supports require gaseous ammonia, aqueous ammonium hydroxide, aqueous methylamine, or their mixture and are commercially available. The solid support 2 requires a solution of ammonia in anhydrous methanol and is also commercially available.|$|E
25|$|A {{merit of}} the vector <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it is manifestly {{independent}} of any coordinate system.|$|E
25|$|The typical LDS <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> this {{statement}} {{and the current}} handbook statement supersedes prior statements made by previous authorities.|$|E
25|$|Since {{these two}} {{approaches}} often overlap, we discuss {{them at the}} same time. What is characteristic of these <b>approaches</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they investigate various possibilities by eliminating or weakening or replacing one or more conditions (criteria) that Arrow imposed.|$|R
50|$|The main {{appeal of}} such <b>approaches</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the access control may be {{upgraded}} dynamically {{in response to}} security breaches without requiring expensive exchanges of physical conditional-access modules. Another appeal <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it may <b>be</b> inexpensively incorporated into non-traditional media display devices such as portable media players.|$|R
30|$|A {{different}} regularization <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> proposed <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{closely linked}} to the well-known LMS algorithm.|$|R
25|$|Another <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of {{uncertainty}} analysis, where analysts attempt {{to estimate the}} probability of future changes in emission levels.|$|E
25|$|A final {{advantage}} of this <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it allows for natural direct descriptions {{of many of the}} fundamental objects of study to differential geometry and topology.|$|E
25|$|The {{downside}} to this <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> high-power transmissions are failure-prone devices, {{especially in the}} World War II era. They are also complex and time consuming devices to build and repair. Although it eliminates a second engine, compared to the dual-drive concept, it is still relatively complex compared to the solutions that follow.|$|E
30|$|The main {{disadvantages}} of our <b>approach</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> it <b>is</b> not syntactically possible to characterize such incorrect unsatisfiability cases {{and it is}} not very easy for programmers to understand how type class constraints are handled in such a case, if and when it occurs.|$|R
50|$|In summary, {{the main}} {{benefits}} of this <b>approach</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> it <b>is</b> easy to implement, low cost, and does not require special hardware modification. Software designers can benefit from this model by having a quick power estimate for their applications without any extra hardware requirement.|$|R
5000|$|A second <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> to {{introduce}} explicit forces that work {{to maintain the}} constraint; for example, one could introduce strong spring forces that enforce the distances among mass points within a [...] "rigid" [...] body. The two difficulties of this <b>approach</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> the constraints <b>are</b> not satisfied exactly, and the strong forces may require very short time-steps, making simulations inefficient computationally.|$|R
25|$|A {{major concern}} with this <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> NNRTI {{resistance}} mutations are commonly observed in both mothers and infants after single-dose nevirapine, and may compromise {{the response to}} future NNRTI-containing regimens. A short course of maternal zidovudine/lamivudine is recommended by the U.S. Public Health Service Task Force to reduce this risk.|$|E
25|$|Unique {{distributions}} of compounds across one or many plates {{can be employed}} either {{to increase the number}} of assays per plate or to reduce the variance of assay results, or both. The simplifying assumption made in this <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> any N compounds in the same well will not typically interact with each other, or the assay target, in a manner that fundamentally changes the ability of the assay to detect true hits.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{approaches}} to determining when {{the reign of}} Tiberius Caesar started. The traditional <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of assuming that the reign of Tiberius started when he became co-regent in 11 AD, placing {{the start of the}} ministry of John the Baptist around 26 AD. However, some scholars assume it to be upon the death of his predecessor Augustus Caesar in 14 AD, implying that the ministry of John the Baptist began in 29 AD.|$|E
40|$|Dealing {{with complex}} systems present a {{particular}} challenge to many traditional en-gineering approaches. The pertinant assumption inherent in these <b>approaches</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> component {{parts of a}} system can be neatly partitioned and that their interactions have limited, predictable effects. This assumption is not always tenable, and has an impac...|$|R
30|$|The main {{limitations}} {{of these two}} common <b>approaches</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> (1) they concern a computational domain <b>that</b> <b>is</b> only representative of a small region of the whole process and part, and (2) they analyze a particular configuration, which implies many individual solutions in order to perform a valuable statistical treatment of the results.|$|R
25|$|The key {{constraint}} in this <b>approach</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> it {{had limited}} traction {{because of the}} single driver. These locomotives were equally characterized by both axles, powered or unpowered, being of equal size. Even though the locomotive had the 2-2-0 designation, the leading axle was unpowered and not a lead truck.|$|R
25|$|Re Hobley adopts the {{unconscionability}} rationale {{such that}} {{the imposition of a}} constructive trust is only justified by unconscionability, therefore there must be detrimental reliance. This would appear to be analogous to the doctrine of estoppel. Another consequence of this <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the trust must come into existence before the death of the first testator as otherwise {{the subject matter of the}} trust would be uncertain and could possible be avoided by inter vivos dispositions.|$|E
25|$|Current {{research}} {{is looking at}} ways to consider tumor marker proteomics {{in combination with other}} indicators of disease (i.e. radiology and/or symptoms) to improve diagnostic accuracy. The challenge in such an <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the disparate prevalence of ovarian cancer means that even testing with very high sensitivity and specificity will still lead to a number of false positive results, which in turn may lead to issues such as performing surgical procedures in which cancer is not found intraoperatively. Genomics approaches have not yet been developed for ovarian cancer.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} radial valleys are (clockwise {{from the}} south) Dunnerdale, Eskdale, Wasdale, Ennerdale, Lorton Vale and the Buttermere valley, the Derwent Valley and Borrowdale, the valleys containing Ullswater and Haweswater, Longsleddale, the Kentmere valley and those radiating {{from the head}} of Windermere including Great Langdale. The valleys break the mountains up into separate blocks, which have been described by various authors in different ways. The most frequently encountered <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> made popular by Alfred Wainwright who published seven separate area guides to the Lakeland Fells.|$|E

30|$|The {{practical}} {{benefit of}} using these two <b>approaches</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> instead of developing new algorithms the analyst {{can focus on}} defining mapping functions encoding the model {{in a way that}} fits the data and analysis at hand. Then, these functions automatically generate model views of which existing algorithms can be computed.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we deal with}} {{uniqueness}} and continuous dependence on data for regular solutions to the mixed initial-boundary value problem of linear elastodynamics. The major features in our <b>approach</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> we allow unboundedness for the elastic body and avoid imposing any sign-definiteness conditions on the so-called elasticity tensor...|$|R
25|$|The radar-time {{definition}} of extended-simultaneity further facilitates visualization {{of the way}} that acceleration curves spacetime for travelers {{in the absence of any}} gravitating objects. This is illustrated in the figure at right, which shows radar time/position isocontours for events in flat spacetime as experienced by a traveler (red trajectory) taking a constant proper-acceleration roundtrip. One caveat of this <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the time and place of remote events are not fully defined until light from such an event is able to reach our traveler.|$|E
25|$|Journalist George Monbiot {{has argued}} for a 5-year freeze on {{biofuels}} while their impact on poor communities and the environment is assessed. It {{has been suggested that}} a problem with Monbiot's <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> economic drivers may be required in order to push through the development of more sustainable second-generation biofuel processes: it is possible that these could be stalled if biofuel production decreases. Some environmentalists are suspicious that second-generation biofuels may not solve the problem of a potential clash with food as they also use significant agricultural resources such as water.|$|E
25|$|Marshall and his {{co-workers}} used their asymmetric allenylmetal-homoaldol tactic to construct polypropionate frameworks of (+)-discodermolide. The novelty of the Marshall <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the three stereotriad subunits are assembled through addition of non-racemic allenylmetal reagents to (S)-3-silyloxy-2-methylpropanal to generate both syn/syn and syn/anti adducts. The central feature for the synthesis of the alkyl iodide fragment was the treatment of aldehyde to allenyltributylstannane {{in the presence of}} BF3-etherate to get the syn/syn isomer. Syn/anti methyl-hydroxyl-methyl stereotriads were obtained through the reaction between aldehyde and homochiral allenylzinc reagent.|$|E
40|$|We explore some {{connections}} between the Loewner approach to interpolation and realization, and that based on bilinear differential forms arising in the behavioral framework.

50|$|An {{important}} {{difference between these}} two <b>approaches</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the first <b>approach</b> gives some weight to one's prior experience of tossing coins, while the second does not. The question of how much weight to give to prior experience, depending on the quality (credibility) of <b>that</b> experience, <b>is</b> discussed under credibility theory.|$|R
50|$|The {{reason behind}} {{offering}} the catalog showroom <b>approach</b> to retailing <b>was</b> <b>that</b> it reduced {{the risk of}} merchandise theft (known in the industry as shrinkage) and also enabled customers to shop without the inconvenience of physically dragging purchases throughout the store. The downside to this <b>approach</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> it required the customers to give their names, addresses, and phone numbers with each order. The risk of identity theft made some customers wary of shopping in such stores, particularly when purchasing simple household items such as batteries.|$|R
