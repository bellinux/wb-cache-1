The <b>arrest</b> <b>of</b> <b>ship</b> implicates {{a series}} of legal relations, often in different jurisdictions, that are of great significance for successful effectuating of this temporary measure. Lawyers, who are engaged in the arrest of ships, {{have to know how}} to establish the subjectivity of parties according to rules of strict process legitimacy in right jurisdiction, in order to arrest the right ship at the right time. The effectuation of arrest presupposes finding out the way through different jurisdictions, which contain certain distinctions. They show themselves through the nature of maritime claim, court jurisdiction, relation between debtor, i. e. defendant, the ship intended for the arrest, and the claimant i. e. applicant, security and the countersecurity for the eventual damages caused by wrongful arrest as a consequence of improper proceeding, or through the inequalities of legislative solutions. The <b>arrest</b> <b>of</b> <b>ship,</b> as a temporary measure, is the subject of regulation of international law as well, while the national legislation regulates some other temporary measures. However, execution and the security on maritime ships, concerning the specificity of relations, make certain exceptions from the general rules on execution and security. Although the ships are movables, the legal regime that is appropriate to real estate is applied to them in many ways, and the regime of execution as well. By proceedings of execution on ships are often imperilled the third person 2 ̆ 7 s interests, as of the cargo proxy, lien and mortgage claimants, crew and passengers; in the course of that is strived, to a greatest extent, to protect the interests of those parties. Also, the lengthy of proceedings of execution on ships concerning the security procedure would come to an expressive opposition with necessities of navigation. Therefore, the rules of proceedings in relation to execution must especially be inspired by tendency for fast, economical and efficient proceeding, which will, if possible, ensure as undisturbed as possible, exploitation of ship, even during the execution proceedings. On the other hand, the subject of execution is very mobile, and it demands special measures which scope is the insurance of an efficient seizure of the subject of execution. Concerning the emphasized foreign element in the maritime traffic, the foreign persons may appear as applicants for execution or the debtors in execution proceedings, as representatives of other real-estate relations, of as the competitors in procedure of forced sale of ships. This imposes the necessity of inclination towards solutions established by international conventions, which should be or have been receipted in internal legislature, or Serbia and Montenegro has joined these enactments of international law; while it still does not exist the accepted, uniform international legal system of execution on ships.

40|$|Abstract The 1952 Arrest Convention {{was created}} in order to unify the rules {{relating}} to arrest of ships around the world. Before the Convention, the rules relating to <b>arrest</b> <b>of</b> <b>ship</b> were governed by the different countries national rules of law. This created problems for the shipping industry as a ship could be arrested in relation to any claim whatsoever if it was permitted by the domestic law {{of the country where}} the ship was. Also considering that many countries have exorbitant jurisdictional rules and sometimes on very loose grounds claim jurisdiction, this was a problem. Shipping is a very special kind of business as it involves movable property that often has a great value and suddenly can enter jurisdictional territory and a claimant can get hold of security he could not have counted on. These exorbitant jurisdictional rules made the shipping business insecure and something needed to be done about it. Therefore the Arrest Convention was created. The Convention regulates for what claims a ship can be arrested and therefore gives the claimant and the defendant an ability to foresee when there is a claim in relation to which it is possible to get an arrest. If the Convention had had the effects one wanted one would only have to know about the rules in the Convention and not about the numerous other national jurisdictional rules in the ports or the territorial waters that the ship may enter on its journey. However, the Convention, even though probably having made some applications of law easier, it has not been a pervading effect. Firstly, as with many international conventions the Arrest Convention has not been ratified by all countries although it has been ratified by many in comparison {{with a lot of other}} international conventions. Secondly, there are some questions on when the Convention shall apply before national rules and when it shall not. This has been especially clear in relation to the Brussels Convention on Jurisdiction and Enforcement of Judgements. Even though the Arrest Convention prevails there is still confusion in reality when applying the Conventions. Within the EU the uncertainty becomes even greater as one has to consider both the jurisdictional rules in the Arrest Convention, the rules in the Brussels Convention and the national rules relating to arrest. This makes the possibility to foresee what rules will govern a case even more difficult. However, these uncertainties can be used by forum shoppers that are trying to find loopholes through which to avoid one jurisdiction and get the case taken on by another, more favourable, jurisdiction. The Arrest Convention’s rules on jurisdiction can be used by a claimant to claim jurisdiction in a country where he might not have had jurisdiction if the Convention had not been in force. The same goes for the Brussels Convention. There being uncertainties in the relation between the Conventions and the Conventions and national law is a great incentive for a plaintiff or a defendant to try and stretch the rules in his favour. Sometimes the outcome of a case can be completely different from one jurisdiction to another. Forum shopping, which is the common term when choosing jurisdiction because of more favourable law rules, is used within all types of law having some kind of international connection and there are different opinions about it. The reason behind it is always to get the best outcome possible in a lawsuit, but what is the best possible outcome? In order to shop you also need to know what you are shopping for and where to find it. In international maritime law, being governed by many international conventions not always being signed by the same countries and sometimes having different application depending on if other relating conventions have been signed by the same countries, the best country in which to sue is not always obvious at a first glance. Consequently in order to make a sound decision on where to sue in order to get the most out of a lawsuit you have to look at the jurisdictional rules in order to find out where you can sue and you have to look at the procedural and substantial rules in order to see where you will get the decision you are looking for...|$|E

Still, temporary <b>arrest</b> <b>of</b> <b>ships</b> can only be effected for maritime claims.

Changes were also made to the right of re-arrest and multiple <b>arrest</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ship.</b> Convention <b>of</b> 1999 does not greatly alter the existing international regulations as established by the previous Convention, but attempts to additionally specify certain solutions contained in both the Conventions, in terms of their improvement and modernization...|$|R

Due to the fact, that International Convention Relating to the <b>Arrest</b> <b>of</b> Sea-Going <b>Ships</b> (Brussels, May 10, 1952) was ratified by Norway, and not ratified by Ukraine, such analysis, I hope, will give to the reader {{an overview of}} possible complications, which can arise, when <b>arrest</b> <b>of</b> a <b>ship</b> is sought in a country party to Brussels convention and in a country, which is not.

40|$|The {{scope of}} this thesis is to discuss in detail privileged marithne claims, Maritime Liensfocusing on their {{existence}} in Enghsh Law, {{and deal with the}} aspects of their enforcement, whilst also considering the problems which can -and in practice usually do- arise while the entitied claimants attempt to enforce their Maritime Liens. The points covered by this thesis include the principle of Maritime Liens as recognised under English Law, and the way that these can be enforced against the offending maritime property in order to satisfy the existing claims. Also, discussed are the-various problems with which maritime lienholders aire often faced, such as the conflict'of laws existing between the numerous maritime nations-as well as the various Conventions that have been createdin order to eliminate the existing problems relating to Maritime lines arid the <b>Arrest</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ships!.</b> Additionally, a brief discussion about the need for the creation of uniform rules regarding Maritime Liens wiU be made, followed by an outline of the practice of forum shopping. To give a more specific preview of this thesis, the stmcture of the chapters presented is this: In the first -introductory- chapter Maritime Liens are defined and historically reviewed; the concept of Maritime Liens is closely examined by discussing their fundamental characteristics and properties, and, finally, their worth as a privileged maritime claim is evaluated. At the same time, a brief introduction to the problems that claimants may face while trying to enforce them, as weU as the attempts that have been made to unify the Intemational law regarding Maritime Liens, is given. The second chapter deals with Maritime Liens recognised in English Law, discussing those claims which give the claimant the right to proceed in rem against maritime property. In the third chapter, the enforcement of Maritime Liens is discussed. The whole procedure of enforcing a claim is dealt with in detail, startmg from the action in rem, and its nature, to the <b>arrest</b> <b>of</b> <b>ships.</b> The right to arrest a sister ship is also considered as well as the issue <b>of</b> <b>arresting</b> a <b>ship</b> chartered by demise charterers. The actual procedure <b>of</b> <b>arrest</b> is also mentioned, including the practicalities of arrest; further, the difficulties that claimants encounter in enforcing Maritime Liens are discussed -such as the extinction of Maritime Liens, the provisions of the 1976 Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims and the Caveat Against Arrest. The fourth chapter introduces the issue of the conflict of laws relating to Maritime Liens; it concentrates into the numerous forms the problem can take, extensively discussing the matter of priority of Maritime Liens. The priority given under the English, American and the 1926 Maritime Liens and Mortgages Convention are briefly mentioned. Finally, the attempts that have so far been, made to settie and unify the existing Maritime Liens conflicts are reviewed, considering the various Conventions relating to both Maritime Liens and Mortgages and the <b>Arrest</b> <b>of</b> <b>ships.</b> In the fifth Chapter, aspects such as the uniformity that could be achieved through the ratification of international conventions and the practice of forum shopping are dealt with.
