500|$|Donaldson {{returned}} to Yorkshire {{and signed a}} one-year contract with another Championship club, Sheffield United, on 31 August 2017. The undisclosed fee was described by the Birmingham Mail as [...] "nominal". After scoring both of his team's goals in a 2–1 away win at Sunderland on his debut on 9 September, Sheffield United manager Chris Wilder commented: [...] "Not bad for 50 grand that, is it? Not bad from Aldi... We are delighted to get Clayton. He's <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>kid.</b> I {{know a lot about}} him. I've tried to sign him enough times, I should know about him. He said yes to me eventually." ...|$|E
500|$|On September 19, 1946, an {{informal}} ceremony {{was held in}} which former Leaf great Charlie Conacher presented Ted Kennedy with his No. 9 sweater he had worn during his career. Conacher had been Kennedy's boyhood hero, but when Kennedy arrived Lorne Carr already wore No.9. Kennedy was initially given No.12, then switched to No. 10. When Kennedy heard Carr was retiring, he immediately {{wrote a letter to}} Leaf management requesting No.9. His Leaf team-mates had always teased Kennedy about his compulsion, so they contacted Conacher and arranged for the ceremony. Conacher, now working as a broker, explaining why he was willing to take time off work said [...] "He's <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>kid</b> and a great player. You just can't disappoint a guy like that." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the race, which {{experienced}} a record 16cautions and 74 lead changes, among 22 different drivers, Edwards commented, [...] "A new winner, up-and-coming guy that's tied {{to so much}} history. This {{is as good as}} it gets. If people aren't watching, that's their problem, because we got some great stuff going on here." [...] In the post-race press conference, the third-place finisher, Gilliland, said, [...] "It's a credit to NASCAR and their new rules, trying to get the (cars) closer, to let teams like us have a chance to be competitive. A lot of the rules (are) making these races more competitive." [...] Jeff Gordon also commented about Bayne, [...] "I think it's very cool. Trevor's <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>kid,</b> and I love the Wood Brothers. I'm really happy for him. And I think it's great for the sport. To have a young talent like that– he's got that spark, you know?" ...|$|E

500|$|Bart was {{described}} as [...] "television's king of 1990", [...] "television's brightest new star" [...] and an [...] "undiminished smash". Entertainment Weekly named Bart the [...] "entertainer of the year" [...] for 1990, writing that [...] "Bart {{has proved to be}} a rebel who's also <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>kid,</b> a terror who's easily terrorized, and a flake who astonishes us, and himself, with serious displays of fortitude." [...] In the United States congressional, senatorial and gubernatorial elections of 1990, Bart was one of the most popular write-in candidates, and in many areas was second only to Mickey Mouse amongst fictional characters. In the 1990 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, Bart made his debut as one of the giant helium-filled balloons for which the parade is known. The Bart Simpson balloon has appeared at every parade since. This was referenced in The Simpsons in the episode [...] "Bart vs. Thanksgiving", which aired the same day as the parade, where Homer tells Bart, [...] "If you start building a balloon for every flash-in-the-pan cartoon character, you turn the parade into a farce!" [...] Meanwhile, behind and unbeknownst to him, the television briefly shows a Bart Simpson balloon.|$|E
500|$|Carla Alcorn {{responded to}} such {{criticism}} {{in an interview}} with CNN, stating [...] "we loved him unconditionally. We loved him no matter what. I loved my son. People need to know that I loved him. He was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>kid,</b> a good boy." [...] Although acknowledging that Leelah had requested transition surgery, Carla stated that she had never heard her child use the name [...] "Leelah", before reiterating her refusal to accept her child's transgender status, adding [...] "We don't support that, religiously." [...] She expressed concern that users of social media thought her to be a [...] "horrible person", but defended her actions in dealing with her child, stating for example that she had banned internet access to prevent access to [...] "inappropriate" [...] things. In an email to Cincinnati-based channel WCPO-TV, Leelah's father Doug Alcorn wrote, [...] "We love our son, Joshua, very much and are devastated by his death. We have no desire to enter into a political storm or debate with people who did not know him. We wish to grieve in private. We harbor no ill will towards anyone. ... I simply do not wish our words to be used against us." ...|$|E

6000|$|Carl {{looked at}} her bobbing back (with {{wrinkles}} in her cloth jacket over the shoulders) as she melted into the crowd of glossy fur-trimmed New-Yorkers. He comprehended her goodness, her devotion. He sighed, [...] "If she'd only stop this hinting about Gertie and me----" [...] He was repentant of his irritation, and said to Gertie, who was intimately cuddling her arm into his: [...] "Adelaide's <b>an</b> awfully <b>good</b> <b>kid.</b> Sorry she had to go." ...|$|R

Shortly after the premiere of the song's official remix, Lamar confirmed that [...] "Bitch, Don't Kill My Vibe" [...] would be the fourth official single.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, yes," [...] assented Mr. Goble gently. [...] "But, all joking aside, suppose I {{was to go}} up to twenty-five thousand...?"

6000|$|Suddenly Lane buttonholed {{the little}} man and peered down earnestly at him. [...] "Pepper, I've been trying to {{straighten}} Holt up. He's going to the bad. But he's <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>kid.</b> It's only the company.... The fact is--this's strictly confidential, mind you--Holt's sister begged {{me to try to}} stop his drinking and gambling. I think I can do it, too, with a little help. Now, Pepper, I'm asking you to help me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Too {{late for}} that!" [...] sighed Mr. Goble, realizing that his star {{was in the}} ascendant. He had {{forgotten}} for the moment that Mr. Pilkington was an author. [...] "We must {{make the best of}} a bad job! Now, you're <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>kid</b> and I wouldn't like you to go around town saying that I had let you in. It isn't business, maybe, but, just because I don't want you to have any kick coming, I'm ready to buy your share of the thing and call it a deal. After all, it may get money on the road. It ain't likely, but there's a chance, and I'm willing to take it. Well, listen, I'm probably robbing myself, but I'll give you fifteen thousand if you want to sell." ...|$|E
5000|$|Ahmed {{had been}} a {{football}} player at the private Briarfield Academy in Lake Providence in East Carroll Parish in far northeastern Louisiana. His coach, Ben Durham, said that Ahmed had 2,700 rushing yards and 40 touchdowns in his senior year. Durham described Ahmed as never displaying aggressive behavior when playing football, [...] "He was <b>a</b> normal <b>good</b> <b>kid.</b> It's not like he ever had any fits of rage. Ever." [...] Sometime later, Durham {{said that he had}} a Facebook conversation with Ahmed and noticed the emergence of paranoid tendencies in the young man.|$|R
5000|$|The low-budget, {{black-and-white}} Quicksand (1950) {{has also}} become a classic of the Film Noir canon, with one of Mickey Rooney's finest performances as <b>a</b> desperate <b>good</b> <b>kid</b> going bad, and emigre Peter Lorre as an unforgiving arcade operator. Its distinctive score was by future blacklisted composer, Louis Gruenberg. Mickey Rooney apparently delighted in destroying his wholesome [...] "Andy Hardy" [...] image with this film; he and Peter Lorre put their own money together to finance it, and thus gave Pichel, the blacklist already looming over him, {{one of his last}} Hollywood films.|$|R
5000|$|Little {{is known}} about Gillis' early life except {{that he was the}} son of Yvonne and Norman Gillis, and was born June 24, 1962, in Baton Rouge and was raised in {{southern}} Louisiana. During his 2004 first-degree murder trial for the slaying of Donna Bennett Johnston, his mother, Yvonne, testified that her son was <b>a</b> <b>good,</b> happy <b>kid</b> who did well in school, had friends and was generally just a normal child.

6000|$|... "So it is. There's {{nothing wrong}} with most of them. As a general thing, they are very decent fellows--extraordinarily decent {{if you think of}} the {{position}} they are in. I don't say that in a business way there's much they won't try to put over on you. In the theatre, when it comes to business, everything goes except biting and gouging. 'There's never a law of God or man runs north of fifty-three.' If you alter that to 'north of Forty-first Street' it doesn't scan as well, but it's just as true. Perhaps it would be more accurate to say that the Golden Rule is suspended there. You get used to it after you have been in the theatre for a while, and, except for leaving your watch and pocket-book at home when you have to pay a call on a manager and keeping your face to him so that he can't get away with your back collar-stud, you don't take any notice of it. It's all a game. If a manager swindles you, he wins the hole and takes the honour. If you foil him, you are one up. In either case, it makes no difference to the pleasantness of your relations. You go on calling him by his first name, and he gives you a couple of cigars out of his waistcoat pocket and says you're <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>kid.</b> There is nothing personal in it. He has probably done his best friend out of a few thousand dollars the same morning, and you see them lunching together after the ceremony as happily as possible. You've got to make allowances for managers. They are the victims of heredity. When a burglar marries a hat-check girl, their offspring goes into the theatrical business automatically, and he can't shake off the early teaching which he imbibed at his father's knee. But morals...." ...|$|E
6000|$|It is {{not only}} twin-souls in this world who yearn to meet each other. Between Otis Pilkington and Mr. Goble there was little in common, yet, {{at the moment when}} Otis set out to find Mr. Goble, the thing which Mr. Goble desired most in the world was an {{interview}} with Otis. Since {{the end of the first}} act, the manager had been in a state of mental upheaval. Reverting to the gold-mine simile again, Mr. Goble was in the position of a man who has had a chance of purchasing such a mine and now, learning too late of the discovery of the reef, is feeling the truth of the poet's dictum that [...] "of all sad words of tongue or pen, the saddest are these: 'It might have been.'" [...] The electric success of [...] "The Rose of America" [...] had stunned Mr. Goble; and realizing, as he did, that he might have bought Otis Pilkington's share dirt cheap at almost any point of the preliminary tour, he was having a bad half hour with himself. The only ray in the darkness which brooded on his indomitable soul was the thought that it might still be possible, by getting hold of Mr. Pilkington before the notices appeared, and shaking his head sadly and talking about the misleading hopes which young authors so often draw from an enthusiastic first-night reception and impressing upon him that first-night receptions do not deceive your expert who has been fifteen years in the show-business and mentioning gloomily that he had heard a coupla the critics roastin' the show to beat the band ... by doing all these things, it might still be possible to depress Mr. Pilkington's young enthusiasm and induce him to sell his share at a sacrifice price to a great-hearted friend who didn't think the thing would run a week but was willing to buy as a sporting speculation, because he thought Mr. Pilkington <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>kid,</b> and after all these shows that flop in New York sometimes have a chance on the road.|$|E

There’s no n——- in him.”) in an interview before an ESPN2 telecast of the Oklahoma-Wichita State game. He used racial remarks to describe Oklahoma's freshman outfielder Joe Dunigan III.

2500|$|While Hanks' family {{religious}} {{history was}} Catholic and Mormon, he has characterized himself {{as being a}} [...] "Bible-toting evangelical" [...] for several years as a teenager. In school, Hanks was unpopular with students and teachers alike, later telling Rolling Stone magazine, [...] "I was a geek, a spaz. I was horribly, painfully, terribly shy. At the same time, I was the guy who'd yell out funny captions during filmstrips. But I didn't get into trouble. I was always <b>a</b> real <b>good</b> <b>kid</b> and pretty responsible." [...] In 1965, his father married Frances Wong, a San Francisco native of Chinese descent. Frances had three children, two of whom lived with Hanks during his high school years.
