5|$|In 1583, Italian scholar Carlo Sigonio {{claimed to}} have {{discovered}} a non-fragmentary version of the Consolatio. While this news was met with excitement at first, scholars—after reading the work—began {{to argue that the}} manuscript was <b>a</b> <b>fraud,</b> with humanist Antonio Riccoboni being among the most vocal.
