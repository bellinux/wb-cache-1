25|$|COUM's {{earliest}} {{public events}} were impromptu musical gigs performed at various pubs around Hull; titles for these events included Thee Fabulous Mutations, Space Between the Violins, Dead Violins and Degradation, and Clockwork Hot Spoiled <b>Acid</b> <b>Test.</b> The latter combined {{the names of}} Anthony Burgess' dystopian science-fiction novel A Clockwork Orange (1962) with Tom Wolfe's The Electric Kool-Aid <b>Acid</b> <b>Test</b> (1968), a work of literary journalism devoted to the Merry Pranksters, a US communal counter-cultural group who advocated the use of psychedelic drugs. COUM's music was anarchic and improvised, making use of such instruments as broken violins, prepared pianos, guitars, bongos and talking drums. As time went on, they added further theatrics to their performances, in one instance making the audience crawl through a polythene tunnel to enter the venue.|$|E
25|$|Wolfe's The Electric Kool-Aid <b>Acid</b> <b>Test</b> is {{considered}} a striking example of New Journalism. This account of the Merry Pranksters, a famous sixties counter-culture group, was highly experimental in Wolfe's use of onomatopoeia, free association, and eccentric punctuation—such as multiple exclamation marks and italics—to convey the manic ideas and personalities of Ken Kesey and his followers.|$|E
25|$|Kesey mainly kept to {{his home}} life in Pleasant Hill, preferring to make artistic {{contributions}} on the Internet or holding ritualistic revivals {{in the spirit of}} the <b>Acid</b> <b>Test.</b> In the official Grateful Dead DVD release The Closing of Winterland (2003) documenting the monumental New Year's 1978/1979 concert at the Winterland Arena in San Francisco, Kesey is featured in a between-set interview.|$|E

50|$|Many {{of these}} viruses are {{controlled}} through laboratory screening tests. These fall into three basic varieties: antibody <b>tests,</b> nucleic <b>acid</b> <b>tests</b> (NAT), and surrogate tests. Antibody tests {{look for the}} immune system's response to the infection.

25|$|The Merry Pranksters were a {{group who}} {{originally}} formed around American novelist Ken Kesey, {{considered one of}} the most prominent figures in the psychedelic movement, and sometimes lived communally at his homes in California and Oregon. Notable members include Kesey's best friend Ken Babbs, Neal Cassady, Mountain Girl (born Carolyn Adams but best known as Mrs. Jerry Garcia), Wavy Gravy, Paul Krassner, Stewart Brand, Del Close, Paul Foster, George Walker, and others. Their early escapades were chronicled by Tom Wolfe in The Electric Kool-Aid <b>Acid</b> <b>Test.</b>|$|E
25|$|Eugene has a {{significant}} population of people in pursuit of alternative ideas and a large original hippie population. Beginning in the 1960s, the countercultural ideas and viewpoints espoused by Ken Kesey became established as the seminal elements of the vibrant social tapestry that continue to define Eugene. The Merry Prankster, as Kesey was known, has arguably left the most indelible imprint of any cultural icon in his hometown. He {{is best known as}} the author of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and as the male protagonist in Tom Wolfe's The Electric Kool-Aid <b>Acid</b> <b>Test.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1965, Wolfe {{published}} {{a collection of}} his articles in this style, The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby, adding to his notability. He {{published a}} second collection of articles, The Pump House Gang, in 1968. Wolfe wrote on popular culture, architecture, politics, and other topics that underscored, among other things, how American life in the 1960s had been transformed by post-WWII economic prosperity. His defining work from this era is The Electric Kool-Aid <b>Acid</b> <b>Test</b> (published {{the same day as}} The Pump House Gang in 1968), which for many epitomized the 1960s. Although a conservative in many ways (in 2008, he claimed never to have used LSD and to have tried marijuana only once) Wolfe became one of the notable figures of the decade.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} {{general data}} on nucleic acid/serology testing and report the first hepatitis B-nucleic <b>acid</b> <b>testing</b> yield {{case of an}} immunized donor in Brazil. Methods: A total of 24, 441 donations collected in 2010 and 2011 were submitted to individual nucleic <b>acid</b> <b>testing</b> for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus using the TaqMan&# 174; MPX kit (Roche) on the Cobas s 201 platform, in addition to routine screening for serological markers. Nucleic acid testing-reactive donations were further evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction using Cobas AmpliPrep/Cobas TaqMan hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus and human immunodeficiency virus tests. Results: Thirty-two donations were reactive by nucleic <b>acid</b> <b>testing,</b> 31 were also serologically reactive and one first-time donor was identified as having hepatitis B in the window period. Follow-up samples showed increasing titers of anti-HBs rising from 19 UI/mL in the index donation to 109 IU/mL seven months later attributable to his vaccination history. Curiously, this donor was never reactive for HbsAg nor for anti-HBc. In the yield donation, he was concomitantly reactive for syphilis (enzyme immunoassay and fluorescent treponemal antibody-absorption; venereal disease research laboratory non-reactive). Overall, six donors (0. 02 %) were characterized as occult hepatitis B. A total of 35 % of the confirmed (recombinant immunoblot assay positive) hepatitis C donations were nucleic <b>acid</b> <b>testing</b> non-reactive and no human immunodeficiency virus "elite controller" was identified. Conclusion: The yield rate (1 : 24, 441; 95 % confidence interval: 1 : 9, 537 - 1 : 89, 717) contrasts to the North American rate (1 : 410, 540 donations) and strongly advocates the adoption of nucleic <b>acid</b> <b>testing</b> for hepatitis B in Brazil despite the increasing rate of anti-HBs reactive subjects due to the successful immunization program...|$|R

Marjorie Barnard wrote of their first meeting as being ot entirely happy. I was the greenest of green 'freshers'. Flora was {{established}} in her second year. Chance had given me the locker immediately above hers. Its untidy contents frequently spilled out into her more ordered domain. My then meager person was continually underfoot, and Flora's brown eyes flashed with indignation more often than they smiled. But within the year we were close friends. She widened my horizons and quickened my mind. Later this friendship was to withstand what everyone agrees to be the <b>acid</b> <b>test</b> of collaboration in writing.|$|E
25|$|The hippie {{legacy in}} {{literature}} includes the lasting popularity of books reflecting the hippie experience, such as The Electric Kool-Aid <b>Acid</b> <b>Test.</b> In music, the folk rock and psychedelic rock popular among hippies evolved into genres such as acid rock, world beat and heavy metal music. Psychedelic trance (also known as psytrance) {{is a type}} of electronic music influenced by 1960s psychedelic rock. The tradition of hippie music festivals began in the United States in 1965 with Ken Kesey's Acid Tests, where the Grateful Dead played tripping on LSD and initiated psychedelic jamming. For the next several decades, many hippies and neo-hippies became part of the Deadhead community, attending music and art festivals held around the country. The Grateful Dead toured continuously, with few interruptions between 1965 and 1995. Phish and their fans (called Phish Heads) operated in the same manner, with the band touring continuously between 1983 and 2004. Many contemporary bands performing at hippie festivals and their derivatives are called jam bands, since they play songs that contain long instrumentals similar to the original hippie bands of the 1960s.|$|E
500|$|According to Kevin T. McEneaney, the Grateful Dead [...] "invented" [...] {{acid rock}} {{in front of}} a crowd of concertgoers in San Jose, California on December 4, 1965, the date of the second <b>Acid</b> <b>Test</b> held by novelist Ken Kesey and The Merry Pranksters. Their stage {{performance}} involved the use of strobe lights to reproduce LSD's [...] "surrealistic fragmenting" [...] or [...] "vivid isolating of caught moments". The <b>Acid</b> <b>Test</b> experiments subsequently launched the entire psychedelic subculture.|$|E
40|$|The {{molecular}} structure of DNA {{was established in}} 1953, and the genetic code was deciphered in 1966. There followed a rapid surge in both fundamental and applied nucleic acid research that {{laid the foundation for}} in vitro nucleic acid-based diagnostic tests, and culminated in the draft sequence of the 3. 2 gigabase human genome in 2000 (1, 2) (see also the Smithsonian Institute Archives, DNA sequencing and video history collection; [URL] During this period the regulatory approval of in vitro nucleic <b>acid</b> <b>tests</b> has proceeded at a relatively cautious pace. In 1985 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted the first clearance for a clinical diagnostic based on nucleic acid probe technology to Gen-Probe Inc. (San Diego, CA) for a culture confirmation test for Legionnaire’s disease, and in 1988 approved a test for detecting infection by the human papilloma virus (ViraPap assay, Life Technologies Inc., Rockville, MD) as an indicator of risk for the development of cervical cancer. The FDA approved the first viral load test in 1999 (the Roche Amplicor HIV- 1 Monitor Test), and the first DNA-based laboratory test for an inherited disorder in 2003, when they approved a test for blood clotting abnormalities arising from the Factor V Leiden and the Factor II genetic abnormalities. The issues confronting nucleic <b>acid</b> <b>testing</b> are diverse and incompletely resolved. For example, the medical significance of DNA sequence variation is as yet, not fully understood. Also, none of the current sequencing or testing methods is either simple or direct, and this drives continuing innovation in sample preparation and testing technology. Finally, the advent of nucleic <b>acid</b> <b>testing</b> has generated legal and ethical issues over access and dissemination of an individual’s DNA sequence. This chapter reviews key issues in nucleic <b>acid</b> <b>testing,</b> and surveys selected advances and new directions in nucleic acid assay technology since 2000, and also explores some of the continuing challenges to the implementation of nucleic <b>acid</b> <b>tests...</b>|$|R

500|$|Linn {{brochures}} dwell {{little on}} performance specifications, mentioning somewhat vaguely that the frequency response [...] "varies {{by only a}} few db from 20Hz to 20KHz with the isobaric loading extending usable bass response to below 10Hz". Linn also claimed [...] "very low distortion" [...] and [...] "high sound pressure levels", without quantification. Recommended amplifier power rating is {{in the range of}} 50500watts. Hi-Fi for Pleasure noted that the speakers' impedance, although quoted at 3 ohms nominal, dipped considerably at some parts of the audio spectrum. This made the DMS Isobarik very hard for amplifiers to drive, potentially causing many amplifiers' output protection to trip. Equally, the two heavy woofers in each Isobarik made them twice as power-hungry. Such demands happened to make Naim amplification the perfect match because of its high current delivery capabilities and its toleration of near short circuits. The Isobarik was famously used as the <b>acid</b> <b>test</b> for the budget-priced NAD 3020 amplifier at its UK launch. In the 1970s, the DMS Isobarik, available in a number of veneers, sold for £1,000.|$|E
500|$|The film {{received}} positive {{attention by}} film critics {{and seems to}} have been well-staged because a reviewer of The Moving Picture News states, [...] "This film points a moral and adorns a tale. Clean as a hound's tooth, sweet as a nut. Full of life. The tale of the triumph of a courageous girl, backed by an inimitable office boy, and the downfall of the grafter are well planned and well rendered. The copy room set our mind flying back to our own 'cub' days. By the way, the paper {{on the wall of the}} traction company office is somewhat weird. A good, healthy, vigorous production in every sense." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror reviewer said the acting was good, but found fault with the plot itself. The reviewer states, [...] "This film story has melodramatic interest, and the acting is good, but the means by which some of the incidents are brought about will not stand the <b>acid</b> <b>test.</b> For instance, if a political boss wants to 'shake down' a traction company for $5,000, would he submit the proposition in writing? ... The scenes in the newspaper reporters' room would have been more convincing in the first scene if the staff had been more busy in writing copy instead of waving their arms and moving about."
