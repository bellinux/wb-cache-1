5|$|English in Ireland {{was first}} during the Norman invasion. It was spoken {{by a few}} peasants <b>and</b> <b>merchants</b> brought over from England, and was largely {{replaced}} by Irish before the Tudor conquest of Ireland. It was introduced as the official language with the Tudor and Cromwellian conquests. The Ulster plantations gave it a permanent foothold in Ulster, and it remained the official and upper-class language elsewhere, the Irish-speaking chieftains and nobility having been deposed. Language shift during the 19th century replaced Irish with English as the first language for {{a vast majority of}} the population.|$|E

The first immigrants from Europe, reeling {{from the effects of}} the Revolutions of 1848 and with a longer distance to travel, began arriving in late 1849, mostly from France, with some Germans, Italians, and Britons.|$|E

5|$|Gambier {{and pepper}} farming were mainly {{confined}} to the Bintan (formerly spelled as Bentan) and Galang Islands. Similar to the Kangchu system in Johor, gambier and pepper plantations were established on grants of land by the Yamtuan Muda of Riau, who would issue land permits (Surat Sungai) to the Kangchu who would direct {{the operations of the}} plantation and workers within the settlement. In the early and middle 19th century, many Chinese settlers <b>and</b> <b>merchants</b> from Riau relocated their businesses to Singapore, and established trading links between Riau and Singapore. These settlers <b>and</b> <b>merchants</b> still maintained trading links with Riau, as the Kangchu from Riau often shipped their produce to Singapore for free trade to evade taxes imposed by the Dutch colonial government. Like Singapore, competition for the gambier and pepper trade between the Teochews and Hokkiens in Riau led to communal tensions and sporadic violence in Riau during the 1840s and 1850s. In the early 20th century, the Chinese abandoned gambier and pepper plantations in favour of other agricultural practices, as the worldwide prices for gambier experienced a drastic drop in value and many pepper plants fell prey to a disease plaguing the archipelago.|$|E
5|$|Ganesha was {{particularly}} worshipped by traders <b>and</b> <b>merchants,</b> {{who went out}} of India for commercial ventures. From approximately the 10th century onwards, new networks of exchange developed including the formation of trade guilds and a resurgence of money circulation. During this time, Ganesha became the principal deity associated with traders. The earliest inscription invoking Ganesha before any other deity {{is associated with the}} merchant community.|$|E
5|$|Lee gave strict {{orders for}} his army to {{minimize}} any negative {{impacts on the}} civilian population. Food, horses, and other supplies were generally not seized outright, although quartermasters reimbursing Northern farmers <b>and</b> <b>merchants</b> with Confederate money were not well received. Various towns, most notably York, Pennsylvania, were required to pay indemnities in lieu of supplies, under threat of destruction. During the invasion, the Confederates seized some 40 northern African Americans. A few of them were escaped fugitive slaves, but most were freemen; all were sent south into slavery under guard.|$|E

5|$|Smaller {{works were}} not usually {{produced}} on commission. More often the masters anticipated the formats and images {{that would be}} most sought after and their designs were then developed by workshop members. Ready made paintings were sold at regularly held fairs, or the buyers could visit workshops, which tended to be clustered in {{certain areas of the}} major cities. The masters were allowed to display in their front windows. This was the typical mode for the thousands of panels produced for the middle class – city officials, clergy, guild members, doctors <b>and</b> <b>merchants.</b>|$|E
5|$|Stephen {{convinced}} some pilgrims <b>and</b> <b>merchants</b> {{to settle}} in Hungary. Gerard, a Benedictine monk who arrived in Hungary from the Republic of Venice between 1020 and 1026, initially planned to continue his journey to the Holy Land, but decided {{to stay in the}} country after his meeting with the king. Stephen also established a number of Benedictine monasteriesincluding the abbeys at Pécsvárad, Zalavár and Bakonybélin this period.|$|E
5|$|Stephen {{established}} {{at least one}} archbishopric, six bishoprics and three Benedictine monasteries; thus the Church in Hungary developed independently of the archbishops of the Holy Roman Empire. He encouraged the spread of Christianity with severe punishments for ignoring Christian customs. His system of local administration was based on counties organized around fortresses and administered by royal officials. Hungary, which enjoyed a lasting period of peace during his reign, became a preferred route for pilgrims <b>and</b> <b>merchants</b> traveling between Western Europe and the Holy Land or Constantinople.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} Orkney {{prior to this}} time is largely {{the history of the}} ruling aristocracy. From now on the {{ordinary}} people emerge with greater clarity. An influx of Scottish entrepreneurs helped to create a diverse and independent community that included farmers, fishermen <b>and</b> <b>merchants</b> that called themselves comunitas Orcadie and who proved themselves increasingly able to defend their rights against their feudal overlords.|$|E
5|$|The {{reign of}} Alexios III Angelos (r. 1195–1203) had been troubled from the outset: the {{aristocracy}} conspired against him, his pressing demand for {{new sources of}} revenue was blocked by the refusal of Senate, clergy <b>and</b> <b>merchants</b> to contribute, while the lower and middle classes of the imperial capital frequently displayed their discontent with riots against corrupt officials. The most notable of these was a large-scale uprising in February 1200 against the warden of the praetorium, Constantinople's chief prison, John Lagos, which was bloodily suppressed by imperial troops.|$|E

To continue their advertising campaign, Twitter announced on March 20, 2012, that promoted tweets would be introduced to mobile devices.

5|$|Artisans and {{craftsmen}} {{during the}} Han had a socio-economic status between that of farmers <b>and</b> <b>merchants.</b> Yet some {{were able to}} obtain a valuable income, such as one craftsman who made knives and swords {{and was able to}} eat food fit for nobles and officials. Artisans and craftsmen also enjoyed a legal status that was superior to merchants. Unlike lowly merchants, artisans were allowed by law to wear fancy silks, ride on horseback, and ride in carriages. There were also no laws which barred artisans from becoming officials. An artisan painter who worked at the Imperial Academy turned down many offers to become nominated for public office. In contrast, a bureaucrat who appointed a merchant as an official could suffer impeachment from office, while some even avoided nominations by claiming they were merchants.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of deteriorating {{conditions}} in the city attributed to French governance, the unpopular establishment of martial law, and the propaganda efforts of the rebels and their Turkish backers, many neighborhood leaders in Aleppo decided to recruit men to join Hananu's rebels, {{while many of the}} city's landowners <b>and</b> <b>merchants</b> donated funds to the rebel cause. The presence of 5,000 French Senegalese troops prevented an urban revolt that specifically targeted French forces, but in numerous incidents, Muslims from Aleppo's lower-income neighborhoods, such as Bab al-Nairab, violently assaulted members of the city's large Christian minority because they were viewed as being associated with French interests.|$|E
5|$|Big Huge Games added {{multiple}} {{new features}} {{to the game}} during its development, {{in an attempt to}} fix issues with the original version. In an interview with GameSpot, executive producer Tim Train explained the development of the expansion pack. He stated how some nations were previously either too weak or too strong, and so features were added to balance gameplay. One way they did this is armed caravans <b>and</b> <b>merchants</b> were added to the Dutch nation, in order to weaken raids initiated by other players who rush their opponent. He said Big Huge Games brought in professional players in order to get suggestions on how to improve the game.|$|E

5|$|Celebrities, artists, <b>and</b> <b>merchants</b> enjoyed fine food, opium, {{and liquor}} at the Great Southern Hotel, which had novel Western pleasures, {{such as a}} disco ball {{specially}} imported from the USA. The allure of Western goods and traditions even extended to weddings held at the hotel. A prolific Chinese writer, Wu Sijing, held her 17-table wedding banquet there in 1952, and was photographed in a white bridal dress, {{with her husband in}} a white suit and bowtie. This choice of dress would have been most unusual amongst mainland Chinese due to the nationalistic influence of Mao-era China, highlighting Singapore's confluence between Eastern and Western cultures, of which the hotel was at the forefront. Both in decor, and activities.|$|E
5|$|Even {{with the}} Jiajing reforms to {{document}} migrant workers <b>and</b> <b>merchants,</b> {{by the late}} Ming era the government census still did not accurately reflect the enormous growth in population. Gazetteers across the empire noted this and made their own estimations of the overall population in the Ming, some guessing that it had doubled, tripled, or even grown fivefold since 1368. Fairbank estimates that the population was perhaps 160 million in the late Ming dynasty, while Brook estimates 175 million, and Ebrey states perhaps as large as 200 million. However, a great epidemic that entered China through the northwest in 1641 ravaged the densely populated areas along the Grand Canal; a gazetteer in northern Zhejiang noted {{more than half the}} population fell ill that year and that 90% of the local populace in one area was dead by 1642.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{restoration}} of the monarchy in 1660, and the removal of the garrison from York in 1688, the city was dominated by the gentry <b>and</b> <b>merchants,</b> although the clergy were still important. Competition from Leeds and Hull, together with silting of the River Ouse, resulted in York losing its pre-eminent position as a trading centre but the city's role as the social and cultural centre for wealthy northerners was on the rise. York's many elegant townhouses, such as the Lord Mayor's Mansion House and Fairfax House date from this period, as do the Assembly Rooms, the Theatre Royal, and the racecourse.|$|E
