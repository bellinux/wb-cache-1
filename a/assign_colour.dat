40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} the channel assignment problem for networks arranged as square and cellular grids. We define the infinite d-dimensional square and cellular grids, {{and show that}} a solution for the channel assignment problem for the d-dimensional square (cellular) grid places an upper bound on solutions for the problem for a suitable d-dimensional cellular (square) grid. We then focus on a restriction of the problem where channel separation for all but adjacent stations is 1, and adjacent stations have to be <b>assigned</b> <b>colours</b> diering by a larger value. For networks arranged as cellular grids, in Section 4 we first present optimal assignments for each σ≥ 4, where the channel separation constraint for adjacent stations is a quadratic in σ. In these assignments, the channel separation constraint for adjacent stations is 1 for σ = 4, 5, 6. We then present optimal assignments, for all σ≥ 4, with a channel separation constraint of 2 for adjacent stations. For networks arranged as d-dimensional square grids, we present optimal assignments for σ = 3, 4 with a channel separation constraint of 2 for adjacent stations. Finally, we introduce {{the notion of a}} colouring schema for d-dimensional square grids and present an algorithm that <b>assigns</b> <b>colours</b> to the vertices of the grid satisfying the schema constraints...|$|R

Usability of volumetric visualization algorithms depends on available means to select {{areas of interest}} in volumetric data {{that are to be}} visualized. A simple and sufficient method is a onedimensional transfer function that <b>assigns</b> <b>colours</b> to intensity values of the data. A drawback of this method is that it produces visual artefacts in specific cases. In this paper we propose a volumetric visualization method that overcomes this drawback by using filtration with volumetric ray casting algorithm.

In this paper, we conduct a more in-depth evaluation of ILP and CP's capabilities to solve the sum colouring problem, with several improvements. Moreover, we propose to combine ILP and CP in a tree decomposition with a bounded height...|$|R

40|$|OPTICS is a density-based {{clustering}} algorithm that performs {{well in a}} {{wide variety}} of applications. For a set of input objects, the algorithm creates a so-called reachability plot that can be either used to produce cluster membership assignments, or interpreted itself as an expressive two-dimensional representation of the density-based clustering structure of the input set, even if the input set is embedded in higher dimensions. The main focus of this work is a visualization method that can be used to <b>assign</b> <b>colours</b> to all entries of the input database, based on hierarchically represented a-priori knowledge available for each of these objects. Based on two different, bioinformatics-related applications we illustrate how the proposed method can be efficiently used to identify clusters with proven real-life relevance...|$|R
40|$|Human speech conveys {{many forms}} of information, but for some {{exceptional}} individuals (synaesthetes), listening to speech sounds can automatically induce visual percepts such as colours. In this experiment, grapheme–colour synaesthetes and controls were asked to <b>assign</b> <b>colours,</b> or shades of grey, to different vowel sounds. We then investigated whether the acoustic content of these vowel sounds influenced participants' colour and grey-shade choices. We found that both colour and grey-shade associations varied systematically with vowel changes. The colour effect was significant for both participant groups, but significantly stronger and more consistent for synaesthetes. Because not all vowel sounds that we used are “translatable” into graphemes, we conclude that acoustic–phonetic influences co-exist with established graphemic influences in the cross-modal correspondences of both synaesthetes and non-synaesthetes...|$|R
