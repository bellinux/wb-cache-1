40|$|Agglomeration is {{the main}} problem that {{prevents}} large scale implementation of nanodiamonds {{in the production of}} composites. Mechanical alloying was applied for crushing the agglomerates and to obtain uniform distribution of the primary nanodiamond particles in aluminium matrix composites. The commonly used X ray dif raction method fails to detect non <b>agglomerated</b> <b>diamond</b> nanoparticles 5 to 6 nm in size, if they are incorporated in a metal matrix. Synchrotron radiation DIFFRACTION at KMC 2, BESSY was used for the identi cation of non agglomerated nanodiamonds. Scanning electron microscopy and synchrotron investigation showed that mechanical alloying does not lead to transformation of the diamond structure into other allotropic forms of carbon and the nanodiamond reinforcing particles are uniformly distributed in the aluminium matri...|$|E
30|$|Our {{experimental}} {{data show that}} UV illumination influences much stronger ZnO nanomaterial occurring due to the enhancement of the polar component. ZnO possesses wurtzite hexagonal structure affording spontaneous electrical polarization and consequently piezoelectricity and pyroelectricity. Its UV-induced strong hydrophilicity may be ascribed to two different factors increasing polar forces: electrostatic interaction of a pyroelectric origin and its photosensitivity. High-energy photons supplied by UV source generate electron–hole pairs in ZnO nanomaterial {{that leads to the}} formation of surface oxygen vacancies and Zn+ defective sites [25]. The water and oxygen molecules may coordinate on the photogenerated surface defective site, which leads to dissociative adsorption of the water molecules on the surface. The defective sites on ZnO surface are kinetically more favorable for hydroxyl adsorption than for oxygen adsorption [36], and as a result, the surface hydrophilicity is dramatically improved and the water contact angle on ZnO nanomaterial surface changes from 60 ° to 3 °. It {{should be noted that the}} same considered polar forces of various origins provide extremely high affinity of ZnO nanoparticles to self-assembling into ordered nanostructures [24] due to the enhancement of cohesive interactions followed by agglomeration (Fig. 1 a). It should be marked that the UV variation of hydrophilicity is much weaker in diamond particles as well as its affinity to <b>agglomerate</b> where <b>diamond</b> intrinsic inertness is unique and cannot be sufficiently modified.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Diamond {{nanoparticles}} {{are gaining}} {{much interest in}} biomedical applications due to the attractive chemical and biological properties. Studies have shown the potential of these “nanodiamonds” (NDs) for bioimaging, drug delivery, and biosensing. However, depending on the origin, the nanodiamond surface is often rich in various functional groups which can result in diverse behaviours in biological environments ranging from bioinertness to changes in cell function and cytotoxicity. We have observed the substantial difference in cellular response of several cell lines to NDs of various origins. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to modify nanodiamond surface in a controlled manner to discriminate the effect of different functional groups on the cellular response. Design/methodology/approach: Commercial detonation nanodiamond powders with the mean grain size 5 nm but different size of <b>agglomerates</b> and synthetic <b>diamond</b> particles ranging from 50 nm to 1 μm were modified under hydro- and solvo- thermal conditions to introduce specific functional groups to the surface. The processed nanoparticles were investigated with Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and the results were compared between the samples. Modified NDs were tested for their toxicity in vitro with several cell lines (cell viability studies) and for the capability for small molecule anti-cancerous drug loading. Findings: We demonstrated that different chemical groups can be introduced and controlled onto the synthetic diamond surface depending on the solvent and process parameters used. In vitro assays showed that no cellular toxicity was found when CO, OH, or NH-groups dominated on the surface of the diamond particle. Practical implications: Many potent drugs that have proven to be useful in treating diseases such as cancer pose a challenge in delivery because they are not soluble in polar protic solvents such as water. These drugs are soluble in polar aprotic solvents that are harmful to the body. Nanodiamond surface modification in conjunction with drug-loading is a potential solution to this problem as nanodiamonds are nontoxic and have the ability to transport significant amounts of drugs. Originality/value: Nanodiamond particles are considered nontoxic and capable of absorption of a variety of organic molecules. This study should further advance the knowledge on the potential of surface-engineered NDs in therapeutic and drug delivery applications...|$|R
