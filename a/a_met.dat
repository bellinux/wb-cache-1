5|$|On 1 July 1905, the Met and the District both {{introduced}} electric {{units on}} the inner circle until later that day <b>a</b> <b>Met</b> multiple unit overturned the positive current rail on the District and the Met service was withdrawn. An incompatibility {{was found between the}} way the shoe-gear was mounted on Met trains and the District track and Met trains were withdrawn from the District and modified. Full electric service started on 24 September, reducing the travel time around the circle from 70 to 50 minutes.|$|E

DeGrom won the 2014 Sporting News NL Rookie of the Year Award and was named the NL Rookie of the Year by the Baseball Writers' Association of America, (the first by <b>a</b> <b>Met</b> since Dwight Gooden in 1984) {{receiving}} first place votes on 26 of the 30 ballots.|$|E
5|$|Cummings {{was among}} the first people {{accepted}} into USC's Civil Pilot Training Program in 1939. She completed an advanced aerobatics course and earned her pilot's license in 1940 and, by her 1941 graduation, had acquired enough training to begin work as an instructor. Having been recruited by Jacqueline Cochran, Cummings joined the Women's Auxiliary Ferrying Squadron in 1942, which soon became the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP). After graduating from training in Houston in May 1943, she served in World War II until the organization's deactivation in December 1944. During this time, {{she was a member of}} the 6th Ferrying Group out of Long Beach, California, eventually reaching the rank of First Lieutenant, and flew 18 different types of military aircraft. In the same month as her unit's deactivation, she married fellow military pilot Howard Critchell, whom she had <b>a</b> <b>met</b> at a base that was used as a ferry stop for the WASP.|$|E

For the season he had 16 wins and 170 strikeouts <b>a</b> <b>Mets</b> record. He had 18 complete games and a 2.76 ERA also <b>a</b> <b>Mets</b> record. It all adds up to Seaver being named The National League Rookie of the Year, and a berth in the All-Star Game.|$|R
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century, the District and the Met saw {{increased}} competition in central London from the new electric deep-level tube lines. With the opening in 1900 of the Central London Railway from Shepherd's Bush to the City with a flat fare of 2d, the District and the Met together lost four million passengers between the second half of 1899 and the second half of 1900. The polluted atmosphere in the tunnels was becoming increasingly unpopular with passengers and conversion to electric traction was seen as the way forward. Electrification had been considered by the Met as early as the 1880s, but such a method of traction was still in its infancy, and agreement would be needed with the District because of the shared ownership of the Inner Circle. A jointly owned train of six coaches ran an experimental passenger service on the Earl's Court to High Street Kensington section for six months in 1900. This was considered a success, tenders were requested and in 1901 <b>a</b> <b>Met</b> and District joint committee recommended the Ganz three-phase AC system with overhead wires. This was accepted by both parties until the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL) took control of the District. The UERL was led by the American Charles Yerkes, whose experience in the United States led him to favour DC with a third rail similar to that on the City & South London Railway and Central London Railway. After arbitration by the Board of Trade a DC system with four rails was taken up and the railways began electrifying using multiple-unit stock and electric locomotives hauling carriages.|$|E

In his debut for the Mets, Dickey pitched well, going six innings, giving up five hits, two earned runs, and striking out two, but received a no-decision. His next start, May 25 against the Philadelphia Phillies, he went six innings again, giving up 9 hits, walking 3 and striking out 7 in an 8–0 shutout for his first victory as <b>a</b> <b>Met.</b> On August 13, 2010, Dickey threw a complete game one-hit shutout of the Philadelphia Phillies— the only hit being a single surrendered to Phillies starting pitcher Cole Hamels. Dickey finished the 2010 season with a very strong ERA of 2.84, which was 7th best in the National League and 10th in all of baseball, and served as a rare bright spot on an otherwise disappointing season for the Mets. In 2010, Dickey posted career highs in Games Started (26), wins (11), complete games (2), innings pitched (174.1), strikeouts (104), ERA (2.84), WHIP (1.19), and BAA (.252).|$|E

On April 16, 2014, Matsuzaka had his minor league contract purchased by the Mets, replacing pitcher John Lannan on the 40-man roster. On April 24, Matsuzaka earned his second career save (first was in Japan in 2000) in a 4-1 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals. After the game, Mets manager Terry Collins stated that Matsuzaka was the back up option to current closer Kyle Farnsworth. On May 14, Farnsworth was outrighted to Triple-A by the Mets, leaving the closer role up for grabs, and Matsuzaka as one of the candidates for the job. On May 25, Matsuzaka was given his first start as <b>a</b> <b>Met</b> after 14 relief appearances. In his start, Matsuzaka went 6 innings and gave up only 2 earned runs on only 3 hits and got the win in a 4-2 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks.|$|E
25|$|Security at Los Alamos {{was very}} tight by {{standards}} of the time. The site was an uninhabited desert location (formerly a private school) whose perimeter was fenced, with guards at the gates. The scientists were permitted outside the facility {{but there was little}} available transportation. (Since they were not members of the military, they could not be ordered to comply with military secrecy orders and instead voluntarily agreed to abide by them.) Although urban-raised scientists, like Ashkin, were far from the amusements that cities afford, they were able to find amusing things to do. It helped that some of the married ones were able to bring their wives to live in the town of Los Alamos and thus parties of men and women could get together for social activities. These include such things as hikes of hills and canyons of the surrounding wilderness areas. It's likely Ashkin played outdoor team sports while at Los Alamos. <b>A</b> <b>Met</b> Lab colleague remembered playing touch football with him and Feld on an open space called the midway at the University of Chicago.|$|E
