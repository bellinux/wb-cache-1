50|$|During the {{exponential}} amplification phase, {{the quantity}} of the target DNA template (amplicon) doubles every cycle. For example, a DNA sample whose Cq precedes that of another sample by 3 cycles contained 23 = 8 times more template. However, the efficiency of amplification is often variable among primers and templates. Therefore, the efficiency of a primer-template combination is assessed in a titration experiment with serial dilutions of DNA template to create a standard curve {{of the change in}} (Cq) with each dilution. The slope of the linear regression is then used to determine the efficiency of amplification, which is 100% if a dilution of 1:2 results in a (Cq) difference of 1. The cycle threshold method makes several assumptions of reaction mechanism and has a reliance on data from low signal-to-noise regions of the <b>amplification</b> <b>profile</b> that can introduce substantial variance during the data analysis.|$|E
50|$|To {{quantify}} gene expression, the (Cq) for an RNA or DNA {{from the}} {{gene of interest}} is subtracted from the (Cq) of RNA/DNA from a housekeeping gene in the same sample to normalize for variation in the amount and quality of RNA between different samples. This normalization procedure is commonly called the ΔCt-method and permits comparison of expression of a gene of interest among different samples. However, for such comparison, expression of the normalizing reference gene needs to be very similar across all the samples. Choosing a reference gene fulfilling this criterion is therefore of high importance, and often challenging, because only very few genes show equal levels of expression {{across a range of}} different conditions or tissues. Although cycle threshold analysis is integrated with many commercial software systems, there are more accurate and reliable methods of analysing <b>amplification</b> <b>profile</b> data that should be considered in cases where reproducibility is a concern.|$|E

Genotypic profile 1 was also exhibited by the O: 6 human serotype strain. The O: 4 and O: 13 human serotype strains showed similar amplification profiles with two primers. However, the third primer induced a distinct profile in each strain. Therefore, these two strains were placed into genotypic profile 3 and 4, respectively. Each primer produced a completely different <b>amplification</b> <b>profile</b> in the O: 5 human serotype strain; therefore, it was named genotypic profile 5.

The goal {{of the present study}} was to identify, besides the well-known candidate genes, novel relevant genes in these large, complex 12 q amplicons. Materials and Methods: Using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, genetic alterations in 19 different genes of 12 q 12 - 24 were evaluated in 77 lipomatous soft tissue tumors (including lipomas, WDLPS, DDLPS and pleomorphic liposarcomas). Results: We recorded several amplified genes of 12 q 13 - 15, including miR- 26 a- 2, a gene not well studied in liposarcoma, and the well-known and previously described genes murine double minute 2 (MDM 2), YEATS domain-containing protein 4 (YEATS 4), high-mobility AT-hook 2 (HMGA 2), cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK 4) and tetraspanin 31 (TSPAN 31). Interestingly, the <b>amplification</b> <b>profiles</b> of these six genes were found to be significantly different between WDLPS and DDLPS, more frequently having a high-level status in DDLPS than in WDLPS. In addition, DDLPS were found to have significantly higher mean amplification ratios compared to WDLPS. Moreover, we identified additional genes exclusively amplified in DDLPS in 12 q 13, 12 q 21 and 12 q 24, including glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (GLI 1), mitogen activated protein kinase kinase kinase 12 (MAP 3 K 12), cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK 2), ALX homeobox 1 (ALX 1) and T-box 5 (TBX 5).

40|$|Abstract Background The {{challenge}} of determining amplification efficiency {{has long been}} a predominant aspect of implementing real-time qPCR, playing a critical role in the accuracy and reliability that can be achieved. Based upon analysis of <b>amplification</b> <b>profile</b> position, standard curves are currently the gold standard for amplification efficiency determination. However, in addition to being highly resource intensive, the efficacy of this approach is limited by the necessary assumption that all samples are amplified with the same efficiency as predicted by a standard curve. These limitations have driven efforts to develop methods for determining amplification efficiency by analyzing the fluorescence readings from individual amplification reactions. The most prominent approach is based on analysis of the "log-linear region", founded upon the presumption that amplification efficiency is constant within this region. Nevertheless, a recently developed sigmoidal model has provided new insights that challenge such historically held views, dictating that amplification efficiency is not only dynamic, but is linearly coupled to amplicon DNA quantity. Called "linear regression of efficiency" or LRE, this kinetic-based approach redefines amplification efficiency as the maximal efficiency (E max) generated at the onset of thermocycling. Results This study presents a critical evaluation of amplification efficiency determination, which reveals that potentially large underestimations occur when exponential mathematics is applied to the log-linear region. This discrepancy was found to stem from misinterpreting the origin of the log-linear region, which is derived not from an invariant amplification efficiency, but rather from an exponential loss in amplification rate. In contrast, LRE analysis generated E max estimates that correlated closely to that derived from a standard curve, despite the fact that standard curve analysis is founded upon exponential mathematics. This paradoxical result implies that the quantitative efficacy of positional-based analysis relies not upon the exponential character of real-time PCR, but instead on the ability to precisely define the relative position of an <b>amplification</b> <b>profile.</b> Conclusion In addition to presenting insights into the sigmoidal character of the polymerase chain reaction, LRE analysis provides a viable alternative to standard curves for amplification efficiency determination, based on analysis of high-quality fluorescence readings within the central region of SYBR Green I generated amplification profiles. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Transposons {{constitute}} the major fractions of repetitive sequences in eukaryotes, {{and have been}} crucial in the shaping of current genomes. Transposons are generally divided into two classes according to the mechanism underlying their transposition: RNA intermediate class 1 and DNA intermediate class 2. CACTA is a class 2 transposon superfamily, which is found exclusively in plants. As some transposons, including the CACTA superfamily, are highly abundant in plant species, and their nucleotide sequences are highly conserved within a family, they can be utilized as genetic markers, using a slightly {{modified version of the}} conventional AFLP protocol. Rim 2 /Hipa is a CACTA transposon family having 16 bp consensus TIR sequences to be present in high copy numbers in rice genome. This research was carried out in order to develop a Rim 2 /Hipa CACTA-AFLP or Rim 2 /Hipa CACTA-TD (transposon display, hereafter Rim 2 /Hipa -TD) protocol for the study of genetic markers in map construction and the study of genetic diversity in rice. Results Rim 2 /Hipa -TD generated ample polymorphic profiles among the different rice accessions, and the <b>amplification</b> <b>profiles</b> were highly reproducible between different thermocyclers and Taq polymerases. These <b>amplification</b> <b>profiles</b> allowed for clear distinction between two different ecotypes, Japonica and Indica, of Oryza sativa. In the analysis of RIL populations, the Rim 2 /Hipa -TD markers were found to be segregated largely in a dominant manner, although in a few cases, non-parental bands were observed in the segregating populations. Upon linkage analysis, the Rim 2 /Hipa -TD markers were found to be distributed in the regions proximal to the centromeres of the chromosomes. The distribution of the Rim 2 /Hipa CACTA elements was surveyed in 15 different Oryza species via Rim 2 /Hipa -TD. While Rim 2 /Hipa -TD yielded ample <b>amplification</b> <b>profiles</b> between 100 to 700 bp in the AA diploid Oryza species, other species having BB, CC, EE, BBCC and CCDD, profiles demonstrated that most of the amplified fragments were larger than 400 bp, and that our methods were insufficient to clearly distinguish between these fragments. However, the overall <b>amplification</b> <b>profiles</b> between species in the Oryza genus were fully distinct. Phenetic relationships among the AA diploid Oryza species, as evidenced by the Rim 2 /Hipa -TD markers, were matched with their geographical distributions. Conclusion The abundance of the Rim 2 /Hipa TIR sequences is very informative since the Rim 2 /Hipa -TD produced high polymorphic profiles with ample reproducibility within a species as well as between species in the Oryza genus. Therefore, Rim 2 /Hipa -TD markers can be useful in the development of high-density of genetic map around the centromeric regions. Rim 2 /Hipa -TD may also prove useful in evaluations of genetic variation and species relationships in the Oryza species. </p...|$|R

Modeling and computerized simulations were performed to look into the complex mechanism of the reactions, such as renaturation of templates during temperature transition from denaturation to annealing step and effective enzyme concentration profiles within the cycle progress. The decrease of effective polymerase concentration due to heat inactivation and product accumulation caused the PCR plateau. Addition of polymerase during the quasi-linear phase could increase the final product amount; however, the PCR process still reached the plateau phase in spite of polymerase addition. Simulation results suggest that renaturation of templates before competitive annealing reaction and decrease of effective enzyme concentration by non-specific binding of polymerase to double-stranded DNA is the main contribution to plateau forming...|$|E

30|$|Leaves from 2 -week-old greenhouse-grown {{plants were}} {{harvested}} for DNA extraction using the CTAB method. Gene-specific primers to amplify the four OXO genes in chromosome 3 were designed using the PRIMER 3 program (Rozen and Skaletsky 2000). Three pairs of overlapping primers for sequencing the genes were designed that would encompass the 1 -kb upstream region, the gene coding {{region and the}} 3 ’UTR region of each gene (as shown in Supplementary Table 5). The expected product sizes were 800 – 1, 000  bp. DNA amplifications were performed in a 50 -μL volume. The reactions contained 100  ng of genomic DNA, 0.25  mM of each primer, 2  mM of each dNTP, 1.50  U Taq DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Cambridge, MA, USA), and 1 × PCR buffer (New England Biolabs, Cambridge, MA, USA). The <b>amplification</b> <b>profile</b> is as follows: 94 °C for 5  min, 35 cycles of 1  min at 94 °C, 1  min at 55 °C, 2  min at 72 °C, and followed by a final extension of 7  min at 72 °C. PCR products were analyzed on agarose gel, purified using a Qiaquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), and quantitated prior to DNA sequencing. PCR products were sent to Macrogen (Seoul, Korea) for sequencing.|$|E
40|$|A {{protocol}} {{is described}} that permits the self-selection of hydrazides {{from a small}} library by a phosphonate-target immobilized on resin. Hydrazides are captured by a neighbouring aldehyde group through reversible hydrazone bond formation. Stabilizing intramolecular interactions between the phosphonate-target and functional groups of the hydrazides drive the selection process. The phosphonate-target is introduced onto commercially available Tentagel resin through straightforward synthetic steps. The functionalized resin could be conveniently characterized by HR-MAS NMR spectroscopy using a recently developed transverse relaxation filter that eliminates the strong phase defects commonly observed with CPMG sequences. In addition, a protocol was developed to quantitatively remove the captured hydrazides from resin in order to analyse their composition by LC/MS. Kinetic experiments were used to study hydrazone formation and exchange on resin yielding similar results to those obtained previously in solution. Competition experiments showed that the system reaches thermodynamic equilibrium if multiple hydrazides {{are added to the}} resin. Finally, competition experiments showed that the immobilized phosphonate-target indeed amplifies the capture of those hydrazides able to develop stabilizing interactions with the target. Importantly, the obtained <b>amplification</b> <b>profile</b> was nearly identical to the ones obtained previously in solution studies. Notably, the observed amplification factors for the self-selected hydrazides were higher, which was attributed to steric effects imposed by the resin...|$|E
40|$|Real-time PCR {{is being}} used {{increasingly}} as the method of choice for mRNA quantification, allowing rapid analysis of gene expression from low quantities of starting template. Despite {{a wide range of}} approaches, the same principles underlie all data analysis, with standard approaches broadly classified as either absolute or relative. In this study we use a variety of absolute and relative approaches of data analysis to investigate nocturnal c-fos expression in wild-type and retinally degenerate mice. In addition, we apply a simple algorithm to calculate the amplification efficiency of every sample from its <b>amplification</b> <b>profile.</b> We confirm that nocturnal c-fos expression in the rodent eye originates from the photoreceptor layer, with around a 5 -fold reduction in nocturnal c-fos expression in mice lacking rods and cones. Furthermore, we illustrate that differences in the results obtained from absolute and relative approaches are underpinned by differences in the calculated PCR efficiency. By calculating the amplification efficiency from the samples under analysis, comparable results may be obtained without the need for standard curves. We have automated this method to provide a means of streamlining the real-time PCR process, enabling analysis of experimental samples based upon their own reaction kinetics rather than those of artificial standards...|$|E
40|$|AbstractVariations in {{morphological}} characters inspired us {{to subject}} various genotypes of Encephalartos woodii to DNA based marker analyses. Genomic DNA of five genotypes of E. woodii {{growing in the}} environs of Durban, South Africa was amplified using 15 RAPD and 5 ISSR primers. The <b>amplification</b> <b>profiles</b> of both marker systems resulted in differences in the detected banding patterns. The dendrogram generated using the Unweighted Pair Group Method using Arithmetic Averages (UPGMA) grouped all the E. woodii genotypes in one group. The two genotypes of E. natalensis analyzed for comparison were clustered in a different group. Due to different hierarchical positions in the dendrogram {{it is clear that}} the genome of all E. woodii accessions is not exactly the same. The reasons for such variations could well be that the Ngoye and Krantzkloof types originally found in two very distinct parts of Natal did not originate from the same parent(s) ...|$|R
40|$|The RAPD-PCR {{technique}} {{has been used}} to generate DNA <b>amplification</b> <b>profiles</b> from a set of advanced generation inbred lines of white clover (Trifolium repens L.). The genetic distances between lines have been estimated and have been compared with the extent of positive heterosis for dry matter yield in hybrid crosses. The analysis clearly separated the four major groups (H, J, R and S), with little within group variation. Heterosis, previously shown to be positively correlated with the extent of phenotypic variation between parental lines, was greatest between lines from groups showing the least genetic distance. The lack of correlation between heterosis and genetic divergence is discussed in the context of results from other systems. Additionally, the data allow a comparison of the extent of phenotypic variation for a trait under selective pressure with the degree of variation at the DNA level detected with the RAPD technique...|$|R
30|$|Rutledge and Côté (2003) {{observed}} {{that in fact}} PCR efficiency is rarely equal across the samples of a dilution series and in response developed the Linear Regression of Efficiency method of absolute qPCR (LRE qPCR). LRE qPCR exploits {{the fact that the}} signal from the fluorescent, dsDNA-binding dye, SYBR Green I, is not influenced by amplicon size or sequence (Spandidos et al. 2008) and that a Boltzmann sigmoidal statistical framework can be applied directly to PCR <b>amplification</b> <b>profiles</b> such that Cq determination is not needed (Rutledge and Stewart 2008). The direct linkage of base pair formation to absolute fluorescence units (FU) makes LRE qPCR a strong candidate as a method synthetic biologists could use to obtain absolute, rather than relative, measurements of specific DNA sequences. Using absolute FU also enables the selection of a universal calibration standard. Rutledge and Stewart (2010) investigated a selection of primer and template combinations, from which the CAL 1 reaction proved optimal in terms of performance and reliability as a universal standard.|$|R
