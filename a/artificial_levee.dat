50|$|<b>Artificial</b> <b>levees</b> {{can lead}} to an {{elevation}} of the natural river bed over time; whether this happens or not and how fast, depends on different factors, one of them being the amount and type of the bed load of a river. Alluvial rivers with intense accumulations of sediment tend to this behavior. Examples of rivers where <b>artificial</b> <b>levees</b> led to an elevation of the river bed, even {{up to a point}} where the river bed is higher than the adjacent ground surface behind the levees, are found for the Yellow River in China and the Mississippi in the USA.|$|R

40|$|The {{piedmont}} {{area of the}} River Tronto (Italy) is characterised by Pleistocene and Holocene terraces at progressive elevations a. s. l. After {{the formation}} of wide unpaired meander terraces during the Early Holocene, the river created a 20 -m-deep gorge into bedrock in its inner part. In mid-valley, the thalweg progressively enlarges and the Late Pleistocene and Holocene terraces converge downstream. A wide alluvial plain was formed during braid-plain aggradation from ca. 4. 3 BP, {{to the end of}} the 19 th century, associated with slope erosion activated by human activities. Since the end of the 20 th century, two series of <b>artificial</b> <b>levees</b> were created in order to prevent floods. Due to the reduced dimensions of the artificial river bed, floods still affect large parts of the plain after extreme events. In the coastal sector, during the Early Holocene, a large bay extended approximately 3 km inland from the present-day coastline. A barrier beach evolved during the Bronze–Iron Age and, until the Middle Ages, the river mouth entered a large lagoon. Progradation occurred from then until the beginning of the 20 th century, when a delta extended up to 500 m seaward.

50|$|The Yuzui or Fish Mouth Levee, {{named for}} its conical head that is said to {{resemble}} {{the mouth of a}} fish, is the key part of Li Bing's construction. It is an <b>artificial</b> <b>levee</b> that divides the water into inner and outer streams. The inner stream is deep and narrow, while the outer stream is relatively shallow but wide. This special structure ensures that the inner stream carries approximately 60% of the river’s flow into the irrigation system during dry season. While during flood, this amount decreases to 40% to protect the people from flooding. The outer stream drains away the rest, flushing out much of the silt and sediment.|$|E
50|$|Most of the Sacramento Valley {{is below}} 300 ft in elevation; in its lower course, the Sacramento River drops only about 1 ft per mile. Between the bajadas or {{alluvial}} slopes {{extending from the}} foothills of the Sierra Nevada and Coast Ranges, are the low floodplains of the Sacramento River. The river flows at an elevation somewhat higher than the surrounding terrain due to deposits of sediment over millennia that created raised banks (essentially natural levees). The banks separate the river from the lowlands to the east and west that once served as vast overflow basins during winter storms, creating large areas of seasonal wetlands. Since the 19th century, <b>artificial</b> <b>levee</b> systems have been constructed to enable farming in the fertile flood plain. Today there are 2000000 acre of irrigated farmland in the Sacramento Valley. Due to the reduction of the floodplain area, the speed of flood flow in the Sacramento River has increased, creating a significant hazard for the farms and towns along its course. By the early 20th century engineers had realized not all the floodplains could be safely reclaimed, leading to the intentional creation of flood bypasses where development is limited to annual crops and recreational uses.|$|E
40|$|Sand boils are springs {{that form}} on the lowland side of an <b>artificial</b> <b>levee</b> {{containing}} a river at extremely high flood stage. Hydrostatic pressure generated by the column of river water between the levees causes failure in the sediment of the channel wall and allows water to be forced laterally beneath the levee and out onto the adjacent flood plain. Sand is transported by the moving water and is ejected onto the flood plain at points where the sediment is structurally weak to produce the boils. The sand deposit forms a characteristic sedimentary structure similar to sand volcanos of the ancient sedimentary record. Mechanisms {{similar to those that}} produce sand boils may {{have been involved in the}} genesis of these structures...|$|E
50|$|<b>Artificial</b> <b>levees</b> require {{substantial}} engineering. Their surface must {{be protected}} from erosion, so they are planted with vegetation such as Bermuda grass in order to bind the earth together. On the land side of high levees, a low terrace of earth known as a banquette is usually added as another anti-erosion measure. On the river side, erosion from strong waves or currents presents an even greater threat {{to the integrity of}} the levee. The effects of erosion are countered by planting suitable vegetation or installing stones, boulders, weighted matting or concrete revetments. Separate ditches or drainage tiles are constructed to ensure that the foundation does not become waterlogged.|$|R

In the mid-valley, the thalweg progressively enlarges and the Late Pleistocene and Holocene terraces converge. A wide alluvial plain testifies a phase of braid-plain aggradation from ca. 4, 3 ka BP, {{to the end of}} the XIX century, associated with slope erosion activated by human activities. Since the end of the XIX century, two series of <b>artificial</b> <b>levees,</b> were created in order to prevent floods.

A strong progradation is documented up to the beginning of the XX century, when a delta extended up to 500 m seaward. During the XX century, following the creation of the <b>artificial</b> <b>levees</b> and the progressive activation of a number of quarries, the beach underwent coastal erosion, and had to be protected by breakwater reefs.

25|$|<b>Artificial</b> <b>levees</b> block spring {{flood water}} {{that would bring}} fresh water and {{sediment}} to marshes. Swamps have been extensively logged, leaving canals and ditches that allow saline water to move inland. Canals dug for {{the oil and gas}} industry also allow storms to move sea water inland, where it damages swamps and marshes. Rising sea waters have exacerbated the problem. Some researchers estimate that the state is losing a land mass equivalent to 30 football fields every day. There are many proposals to save coastal areas by reducing human damage, including restoring natural floods from the Mississippi. Without such restoration, coastal communities will continue to disappear. And as the communities disappear, more and more people are leaving the region. Since the coastal wetlands support an economically important coastal fishery, the loss of wetlands is adversely affecting this industry.|$|R

Thirty-two flat sediment traps (30 x 30 cm 2) were used to collect sediment samples during spring/summer flooding events in 2003. Nine flooding events occurred in 2003 with flood durations ranging from 7 to 110 hrs. Results showed that sediment deposition is determined by landscape variability during flooding events. Net sediment deposit in the wettest area was 134 ± 12 g-dry wt m- 2. Total N and C sedimentation ranged from 0. 55 to 0. 84 mg-N m- 2 for nitrogen and 6. 4 to 11. 0 mg-C m- 2 for carbon.

40|$|The {{rehabilitation}} of lowland rivers subjected to channelization and <b>artificial</b> <b>levee</b> construction {{should attempt to}} improve habitat heterogeneity and diversity of floodplain hydrological connectivity. However, rehabilitation efforts rarely consider the importance of variable lateral hydrological connectivity between floodplain waterbodies and main river channels (ranging from those permanently connected to those temporarily connected during river level rises), instead focusing on increasing individual floodplain waterbody connectivity. This study investigated the young-of-the-year (YoY) fish communities in 10 artificial floodplain waterbodies of variable hydrological connectivity with the river Trent, England, between May and November 2006, inclusive. Floodplain waterbody connectivity to the main river {{was positively correlated with}} the number of species captured (alpha diversity), Shannon–Wiener diversity, Margalef's species richness index and the relative abundance of rheophilic species and negatively correlated with species turnover (beta diversity). YoY fish communities in poorly connected water bodies were most dissimilar to riverine communities.

40|$|Geomorphic {{impacts of}} a {{disastrous}} crevasse splay that formed in September 2015 and its post-formation modifications were quantitatively documented by using repeated, high-definition digital surface models (DSMs) of an inhabited and cultivated floodplain of the Kinu River, central Japan. The DSMs {{were based on}} pre-flood (resolution: 2  m) and post-flood (resolution: 1  m) aerial {{light detection and ranging}} (lidar) data from January 2007 and September 2015, respectively, and on structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry data (resolution: 3. 84  cm) derived from aerial photos taken by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in December 2015. After elimination of systematic errors among the DSMs and down-sampling of the SfM-derived DSM, elevation changes on the order of 10 − 1  m – including not only topography but also growth of vegetation, vanishing of flood waters, and restoration and repair works – were detected. Comparison of the DSMs showed that the volume eroded by the flood was more than twice the deposited volume in the area within 300 – 500  m of the breached <b>artificial</b> <b>levee,</b> where the topography was significantly affected. The results suggest that DSMs based on a combination of UAV-SfM and lidar data can be used to quantify, rapidly and in rich detail, topographic changes on floodplains caused by floods...|$|E
50|$|The {{main purpose}} of <b>artificial</b> <b>levees</b> is to prevent {{flooding}} of the adjoining countryside and to slow natural course changes in a waterway to provide reliable shipping lanes for maritime commerce over time; they also confine {{the flow of the}} river, resulting in higher and faster water flow. Levees can be mainly found along the sea, where dunes are not strong enough, along rivers for protection against high-floods, along lakes or along polders. Furthermore, levees have been built for the purpose of empoldering, or as a boundary for an inundation area. The latter can be a controlled inundation by the military or a measure to prevent inundation of a larger area surrounded by levees. Levees have also been built as field boundaries and as military defences. More on this type of levee {{can be found in the}} article on dry-stone walls.|$|R
50|$|Drainage in New Orleans, Louisiana, {{has been}} a major concern since the {{founding}} of the city in the early 18th century, remaining an important factor in the history of New Orleans today. The central portion of metropolitan New Orleans (New Orleans/Metairie/Kenner) is fairly unusual in that it is almost completely surrounded by water: Lake Pontchartrain to the north, Lake Borgne to the east, wetlands to the east and west, and the Mississippi River to the south. Much of the land area between these bodies of water is at or below sea level, and no longer has a natural outlet for flowing surface water. As such, virtually all rainfall occurring within this area must be removed through either evapotranspiration or pumping. Thus, flood threats to metropolitan New Orleans include the Mississippi River, Lake Pontchartrain, and natural rainfall. <b>Artificial</b> <b>levees</b> have been built to keep out rising river and lake waters but have had the negative effect of keeping rainfall in.|$|R
50|$|A {{crevasse}} splay is a sedimentary {{fluvial deposit}} which forms when a stream breaks its natural or <b>artificial</b> <b>levees</b> and deposits sediment on a floodplain. A breach that forms a crevasse splay deposits sediments in similar pattern to an alluvial fan deposit. Once the levee has been breached the {{water flows out}} of its channel. As the water spreads onto the flood plain sediments will start {{to fall out of}} suspension as the water loses energy. The resulting deposition can create graded deposits similar to those found in Bouma sequences. In some cases crevasse splays can cause a river to abandon its old river channel, a process known as avulsion. Breaches that form a crevasse splay deposits occur most commonly on the outside banks of meanders where the water has the highest energy. Crevasse splay deposits can range in size. Larger deposits can be 6 m thick at the levee and spread 2 km wide, while smaller deposits may only be 1 cm thick.|$|R
40|$|International Journal for Egyptian Archaeology and Related Disciplines. International audienceThe harbor of Taposiris {{was once}} a gateway to Egypt during the Roman period, and {{possibly}} even {{as early as the}} Hellenistic period. Built on the northern shore of Lake Mariout, the probable harbor was separated from the lake by a long <b>artificial</b> <b>levee.</b> A channel provided a link between the lake and the closed area that would have encircled the harbor basin. Our geoarchaeological study revealed a brackish environment influenced by the phreatic level and the Canopic branch that provided fresh water. The generally silty sediments proved to be difficult to analyze and contained few elements for discrimination between natural lake deposits and man-altered harbor deposits. A numerical model of circulation of water masses has been used to discern the spatial distribution of currents and the most active zonation for sediment re-suspension. This model emphasizes the fact that only very fine particles could reach and be deposited in the area of Taposiris. Our study illustrates the fact that the most striking element of the harbor (the EW levee) was entirely man-made and did not take advantage of any apparent natural feature. The bottom of the lake was more or less flat and devoid of any preexisting underwater ridge that could have facilitated the construction of the levee...|$|E
40|$|Land-use {{changes and}} {{their effect on}} overbank {{sediment}} accumulation were investigated on the floodplain of Middle-Tisza River. Military survey maps (1783, 1860, 1883 and 1890) and aerial photos (1950, 1965, 1980 and 2000) were used to evaluate land-use changes and to calculate the vegetational roughness of the area. To determinate the rate of overbank sedimentation sediment samples were collected from a pit, the grain-size, content of organic matter, heavy metal content (Pb, Cu, Zn, Ni and Cd) and pH were measured. Until 1950 meadows and pastures were typical on the floodplain, gallery-forest was along the river, the oxbow-lake and the <b>artificial</b> <b>levee.</b> Notable landuse changes were detected {{in the second half}} of the 20 th century, as the aerial photo taken in 1965 shows extensive forestry in the area. These land-use changes affected the average vegetational roughness, as it has been doubled since the disappearance of grasslands. Land-use changes highly affect the aggradation, as the increased roughness decreases the flood velocity on the floodplain, causing accelerated aggradation. Using Pb marker horizons and grain-size changes the studied sediment profile was compared to dated profiles (Braun et al. 2003), thus, the sediment accumulation rate could be determined for the periods of 1858 - 1965 and 1965 - 2005. According to our measurements the accumulation rate was doubled since 1965, very likely in connection with the doubled vegetational roughness...|$|E

The watershed supports the southernmost population of federally listed Coho Salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), as well as Steelhead Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), a federally endangered species in California. A 2003 restoration project at the Banducci Site, a former agricultural area created in the channel's natural floodplain, sought to restore juvenile salmonid rearing habitat and re-­‐establish floodplain connectivity. Restoration activities included a series of Eucalyptus large woody debris structures, excavation of a pre-­‐existing <b>artificial</b> <b>levee,</b> and revegetation of native plant species along the riparian corridor.

The result reveals that water discharge quantity has been significantly reduced at Dalia point of Teesta River. The study also shows that excessive control of water discharge of Teesta River by man-made structure makes this river useless for the study area people. Average water discharge of monsoon season and dry season is 994. 73 and 71. 20 cusecs respectively.

40|$|International audienceThe Ndop Plain, {{located along}} the Cameroon Volcanic Line (CVL), is a volcano-tectonic plain, formed {{by a series}} of tectonic movements, {{volcanic}} eruptions and sedimentation phases. Floods (annually) and landslides (occasionally) occur with devastating environmental effects. However, this plain attracts a lot of inhabitants owing to its fertile alluvial soils. With demographic explosion in the plain, the inhabitants (143, 000 people) tend to farm and inhabit new zones which are prone to these geohazards. In this paper, we use field observations, laboratory analyses, satellite imagery and complementary methods using appropriate software to establish hazard (flood and landslide) maps of the Ndop Plain. Natural factors as well as anthropogenic factors are considered. The hazard maps revealed that 25 % of the area is exposed to flood hazard (13 % exposed to high flood hazard, 12 % to moderate) and 5 % of the area is exposed to landslide hazard (2 % exposed to high landslide hazard, 3 % to moderate).

In one case, borrow pits dug in the natural levees of Bayou Teche near Patterson, Louisiana, have exposed completely buried, 4 to 6 feet (1.2 to 1.8 meters) high, upright trunks of cypress trees.

40|$|Globally, {{channelisation}} and <b>artificial</b> <b>levee</b> construction {{have reduced}} rivers to single-thread channels isolated from their floodplains. These modifications {{may be particularly}} detrimental to fish during floods, because of increased severity of conditions in the main river channel, prevention of fish finding refuge in floodplain habitats, and stranding of fish when floodwaters recede after artificial levees are ‘over-topped’. Notwithstanding, {{few studies have examined}} the habitat use by young-of-the-year (YoY; age 0 + year) fish in constrained lowland rivers during floods in slackwaters (main channel with little or no discernible current) and after floods on floodplains. This study investigated the community structure and density of 0 + fish species before (main river), during and after floods of varying timing and magnitude in the River Yorkshire Ouse, a constrained lowland river in north-east England. Slackwaters provided refuge for high densities of mainly eurytopic 0 + fishes during floods and high densities of 0 + fishes were found stranded on floodplains after floods. Community composition in slackwaters during floods and on floodplains after floods was significantly different to the main river catches during average daily flows, possibly related to species-specific morphology and behavioural responses to elevated flow. Despite there being floods of greater magnitude during the winter, peak densities of 0 + fish stranded on floodplains occurred in the summer, and probably related to habitat use immediately prior to floods. Fish were also found stranded on floodplains actively managed to store floodwater to protect property and are presumed to permit safe egress for fish. The results are discussed in relation to lowland river rehabilitation, which is particularly important because of potential conflicts between obligations under various European directives to improve the status of fish populations in degraded rivers (Water Framework Directive) whilst at the same time minimise flooding of societal assets (Flood Directive) ...|$|E

Stability of {{geotechnical}} constructions, such as levees, {{is one of}} {{the most}} important issues for urban areas. The precise prediction of levees destruction during the f lood can not only save human lives and properties, but also protect the natural environment (Krzhizhanovskaya et al. 2011). During ISMOP project (Computer System for Monitoring River Embankments), an <b>artificial</b> <b>levee</b> will be built and monitored using dense grid of sensors, mainly thermal and pore pressure ones. Planned levee will be an enclosed region with the water inside embankments. This construction will be placed in Czernichów near Kraków (Poland), close to existing Vistula River embankment (ISMOP 2014). The main aim of the project is to create a remote system, which can inform about possibility of losing levee stability. Water level changes and its inf luence on the stability of levee was preceded by 2 D and 3 D numerical modeling, conducted in Itasca Flac software (Itasca 2011) based on finite-difference method. The modeling of levee behavior at various water levels (simulation of the flood waves) allow to select appropriate scenarios for real experiments and indicate the optimal location of sensors. It is important, because only limited number of scenarios can be performed in real conditions. The first step included several 2 D numerical modelings performed to obtain relevant shape and size of grid cells and offset of boundary condition (Bukowska & Krawiec 2014, Pięta & Dwornik 2014) for mechanical and fluid calculation. Numerical modeling for both thermal and dynamic analysis force using regular computational grid with smaller size of computational cells than the cell used for fluid modeling. Other specifications (adaptive shape or bigger than 0. 1 m cell size) caused instability in calculation of thermal fields. It also determines the depth of computational model in order to preserve natural exchange temperature between air, soil and water. Another problem was time step of modeling. Too short time step cause in a huge number of data, increasing calculation time and could make some calculations unstable or incorrect. Too long time step can cause incorrect prediction of destruction model and inadequately simulate natural phenomena of dynamic processes. Results obtained for 2 D mechanical modeling were confirmed with 3 D modeling of full levee and geological background. The lack of other processes in 3 D modeling was caused by very long time of modeling the fluid-soil interaction. Results of two dimensional numerical modeling shows, that 2 D modelling can be regarded as a powerful and sufficient tool to estimate the stability of levee. The optimal size of grid and time step can make this calculation more efficient. Dostępny również w formie drukowanej. KEYWORDS: urban area, embankment, water level...|$|E
2500|$|The {{western part}} of the state of Mississippi, from the Tennessee state line to the north and Vicksburg at the south, {{is a part of the}} flood plain of the Mississippi River. As such, it is quite low; in many places, it is in fact lower than the level of the river. The region is {{therefore}} occupied by numerous marshes, brakes, sloughs, bayous, lakes, creeks, and rivers that in the geologic past were parts of the river bed. Until the middle of the nineteenth century, overflow from the Mississippi continued to pass into these waters, and they could be used as alternatives to the main river for water transportation. [...] One such route left the Mississippi at a point a little south of Helena, Arkansas, passed through Moon Lake (an oxbow lake, i.e. a former loop of the river that had been cut off when it changed course), and followed the Yazoo Pass to the Coldwater River. The Coldwater is a tributary of the Tallahatchie River, which combines with the Yalobusha to form the Yazoo River at Greenwood, Mississippi. The Yazoo then flows 188 miles (303km), to reenter the Mississippi a short distance above Vicksburg. This changed in 1856, however, when the coming of the railroad induced the state to drain some of the land for agricultural uses. To that end, they built <b>artificial</b> <b>levees</b> to confine the river to its main course. Deprived of its principal source, the water level behind the levee dropped as much as eight feet (approximately 2.5 m).|$|R
40|$|Natural rivers may be {{classified}} into two flow durations, perennial and seasonal. However, due to strong human activities, some perennial rivers in north China {{have been changed}} into seasonal rivers, among which the most striking examples are the lower Yellow River, the lower Yongdinghe River and the lower Hutuohe River in North China Plain. These rivers {{can be regarded as}} a new category of rivers, and termed anthropogenic seasonal river (ASR) in the present study. The transformation from perennial rivers to ASRs occurs under the influence of both natural factors and human activities. In the zones with some specific combination of environmental settings, the transformation from perennial to ASRs is most likely to occur. These zones can be regarded as sensitive or susceptible zones of ASRs. In the present study, three sensitive zones of ASRs have been identified, i. e., the transitional zone from and to semiarid climates, the zone of "superelevated river" (i. e., a river whose bed is higher than the floodplain behind the <b>artificial</b> <b>levees)</b> development, and the zone with unbalanced land-water coupling. To a great degree, the formation of ASRs in these susceptible zones {{is the result of the}} excessive water diversion by human beings for irrigation and other water demands during low-water seasons.

40|$|The Yellow River {{is one of}} {{the largest}} riverrine {{sediment}} routing system in the world Like many other rivers, the sediment load of the Yellow River can not be regarded as constant in its long history due to changes in climate and human activities This study determined sediment storage on the floodplains of the lower Yellow River in five historical periods after the year 602 BC mainly based on data of 93 boreholes, 182 radiocarbon dates in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain and maps of historical changes of the lower Yellow River channel Furthermore, the mean annual sediment outputs from the upper and middle reaches of the Yellow River were calculated in the five periods through investigating the sediment delivery ratio of the lower Yellow River under different conditions of <b>artificial</b> <b>levees</b> Our findings suggest that the sediment output from the upper and middle Yellow River increased slowly before the year around 1128, but was lower than half of the current value on average It has been in the past about 1000 years that the sediment output from the upper and middle Yellow River escalated The Loess Plateau is the principal sediment source of the Yellow River The comparison of historical changes in sediment load of the lower Yellow River with those in the natural conditions and in human activities on the plateau reveals that the changes in sediment yield from the plateau could be attributed mainly to the variations of population, cultivating area, and climate changes on the platea...|$|R
50|$|The {{western part}} of the state of Mississippi, from the Tennessee state line to the north and Vicksburg at the south, {{is a part of the}} flood plain of the Mississippi River. As such, it is quite low; in many places, it is in fact lower than the level of the river. The region is {{therefore}} occupied by numerous marshes, brakes, sloughs, bayous, lakes, creeks, and rivers that in the geologic past were parts of the river bed. Until the middle of the nineteenth century, overflow from the Mississippi continued to pass into these waters, and they could be used as alternatives to the main river for water transportation. One such route left the Mississippi at a point a little south of Helena, Arkansas, passed through Moon Lake (an oxbow lake, i.e. a former loop of the river that had been cut off when it changed course), and followed the Yazoo Pass to the Coldwater River. The Coldwater is a tributary of the Tallahatchie River, which combines with the Yalobusha to form the Yazoo River at Greenwood, Mississippi. The Yazoo then flows 188 miles (303 km), to reenter the Mississippi a short distance above Vicksburg. This changed in 1856, however, when the coming of the railroad induced the state to drain some of the land for agricultural uses. To that end, they built <b>artificial</b> <b>levees</b> to confine the river to its main course. Deprived of its principal source, the water level behind the levee dropped as much as eight feet (approximately 2.5 m).|$|R
