It may also be applied unfairly by those who do not understand Islamic culture and the basis of sharia law, or who fail to distinguish between moderate Islamic and extremist Islamist states, or misapplied to perceived threats which are not true or have yet to be proven.|$|E

The book, which argued that the {{media coverage}} of the offensive was excessively negative and helped lose the war, [...] "is regularly cited by historians, without qualification, as the standard work on media reporting of the Tet offensive". Notably, his conclusions are heavily criticised by Noam Chomsky and Edward S. Herman who state [...] "they reports were generally less <b>alarmist</b> government reports.....The <b>manner</b> in which the media covered events had little effect on public opinion, except perhaps to enhance its aggressiveness" [...] in their book Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media.|$|R

Nevertheless, the question of how accuracy can be ensured is not a trivial one in the real world, given the landscape of competing interests and a plethora of practical constraints and limitations. Though the primary responsibility lies with authors themselves, the framework of peer review, managed and overseen by editors, was developed in part to ensure robustness and resilience of the system as a whole. Analysing how often and why the system fails is inherently difficult as in most instances the specific processes are not visible to parties not directly involved in the handling of a prospective paper. For this reason it is important to encourage the reporting of case studies which should inform avenues for potential improvement. The present manuscript describes an example which illustrates well a number of flaws of the peer review framework as it exists today. In particular, I detail a number of serious errors in an article recently published in a leading journal, which include conclusions not supported by evidence, methodological flaws, and ill-conceived statistical analysis, <b>alarmist</b> and exaggerated <b>manner</b> in which the findings are communicated in the media, and the poor handling of these issues by the journalâ€™s editorial board. In conclusion, the research community should exert a concerted effort to report, discuss, and document instances of criticisms of published scientific work being silenced.
