5|$|Along {{with other}} veterans' organisations, HIAG campaigned for the {{immediate}} amnesty and early release of war criminals still in Allied captivity. This issue was significant, as most of these organisations made their cooperation {{in the area of}} rearmament contingent on the satisfactory resolution in this area. It was partly for this reason that the West German government was sympathetic to the fate of these individuals and made every effort to secure their early release. Chancellor Adenauer even met with Kurt Meyer in Werl Prison when he went there on <b>an</b> <b>inspection</b> tour.|$|E

50|$|Cantell Secondary {{received}} <b>an</b> Ofsted <b>inspection</b> in Autumn 2004 and was {{put into}} the special measures category because it was failing to give its students an acceptable standard of education.

5|$|Although the {{original}} invasion threat passed, Sandown continued in military use into the 17th century. A 1616 survey nonetheless {{reported that a}} range of repairs were needed, at an estimated total cost of £437, while a 1634 survey noted that work estimated at £1,243 was required. In contrast, <b>an</b> <b>inspection</b> in 1635 showed the castle to be in reasonable structural condition, but antiquated in design. A report produced in 1641 suggested that £8,000 of investment was required in the three castles of the Downs, including £3,000 for additional sea defences.|$|E
5|$|Back in Kristiansund, Løvold {{started working}} {{with the idea of}} {{building}} a subsea road tunnel from Kristiansund to the mainland.

Løvold was an important enthusiast for the fixed link project, which would materialize as the Kristiansund and Frei Fixed Link in 1992. The local press dubbed him the fixed link general. In 1955 he organized <b>an</b> <b>inspection</b> of Freifjorden; using echo sounding it was possible to survey the depth of the fjord. Afterwards he took contact with County Governor Olav Oksvik and the two started working towards implementing the plans.|$|E

That same day, Hipper was awarded the Iron Cross by the Kaiser; on the 23rd he was presented with the Friedrich August Cross, First and Second Classes, by the Grand Duke of Oldenburg.

5|$|During a {{ministry}} of over half-a-century, Luang Pu Sodh taught Dhammakaya meditation continuously, guiding meditation every Thursday and preaching on Buddhism on Sundays and Uposatha days. Luang Pu Sodh would distribute an introductory book about meditation to practitioners. At first, the Dhammakaya meditation method drew {{criticism from the}} Thai Sangha authorities, {{because it was a}} new method. Discussion within the Sangha led to <b>an</b> <b>inspection</b> at Wat Paknam, but it was concluded that Luang Pu Sodh's method was correct.|$|E
5|$|During <b>an</b> <b>inspection</b> by Superintendent Chalmers, Principal Skinner lures Bart, Jimbo, Kearney, Dolph and Nelson into {{a utility}} {{basement}} {{with the promise}} of free mountain bikes and locks the door.

5|$|Following its capture, Java {{was under}} British {{administration}} from 1811 to 1816. The appointed governor was Lieutenant Governor-General Thomas Stamford Raffles, who took {{great interest in}} the history of Java. He collected Javanese antiques and made notes through contacts with local inhabitants during his tour throughout the island. On <b>an</b> <b>inspection</b> tour to Semarang in 1814, he was informed about a big monument deep in a jungle near the village of Bumisegoro. He was not able to make the discovery himself and sent H.C. Cornelius, a Dutch engineer, to investigate.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the Arlington Line, which was built several miles to the southwest of Fort Jackson, atop the heights of Arlington, the maintenance of Forts Jackson and Runyon was neglected. The two forts had largely been made redundant by the newer, stronger works atop the hills, and it was believed that neither played a crucial role any longer in the defenses of Washington. Fort Jackson was kept in service only as <b>an</b> <b>inspection</b> station for traffic crossing Long Bridge.|$|E
