5|$|The Quebra Quilo riots were {{suspected}} of being condoned by priests, and together with the arrest of the bishops, {{drew attention to the}} Imperial government having become embroiled in <b>a</b> <b>no-win</b> dispute. The crisis would only be smoothed over by the replacement of the Cabinet in September 1875 and the Emperor's reluctant grant of a full amnesty to the bishops. Historian Heitor Lyra blamed Rio Branco and his Cabinet, both bishops and, primarily, PedroII for the ordeal. All parties involved revealed a lack of tact, and their intransigence only caused harm—mostly to the monarchy itself. The main consequence of the crisis was that the clergy no longer saw any benefit in upholding PedroII. Although they abandoned the Emperor, most eagerly awaited the accession of his eldest daughter and heir Isabel because of her Ultramontane views.|$|E

After the {{integration}} of the major leagues in 1947, marked by the appearance of Jackie Robinson with the Brooklyn Dodgers that April, interest in Negro league baseball waned. Black players who were regarded as prospects were signed by major league teams, often without regard for any contracts that might have been signed with Negro league clubs.

25|$|The Hatsuharu-class destroyers were {{designed}} to accompany the Japanese main striking force and to conduct both day and night torpedo attacks against the United States Navy as it advanced across the Pacific Ocean, according to Japan's naval strategic projections. They were to be armed much as the Fubuki class despite displacing only 1400 tons compared to the 1700 tons of the earlier destroyers. Furthermore, their fire control systems were to be more modern than the older systems and suitable for anti-aircraft use. This required the gun turrets to be modified for high-angle fire, which also meant more powerful motors to traverse and elevate the guns more quickly to engage high-speed aircraft. The torpedo launchers were {{to be given a}} protective shield to allow for use in heavy weather and to protect against splinter damage. And the Hatsuharu vessels were to be fitted with modern, enclosed command spaces protected against strafing aircraft. These requirements could only be met by adding weight high up on the ship and increased the ship's center of gravity. The only way to adhere to the allotted displacement was to try to reduce the weight of the hull and other equipment below the waterline as much as possible. But this put the ship's designers in <b>a</b> <b>no-win</b> situation as any reduction of weight below the waterline further raised the ship's center of gravity and reduced her stability.|$|E

40|$|Poor economies find {{themselves}} in <b>an</b> almost <b>no-win</b> situation: They would benefit from improving the economic situations of the very poor by making them self-supporting and economically productive. However, the very poor are occupied by daily survival and thus cannot afford themselves to improve. This paper describes the status quo of a dilapidated hotel in Beira, a so-called vertical slum that is squatted by one thousand inhabitants trapped in self-sustaining poverty. It builds {{on the assumption that}} if a technical intervention creates conditions with clear lines of control, defensible space and basic conditions for trade and productivity the downward spiral can be reversed towards improvement. The concept of Open Building gives guidelines for a built environment that works based on a clear division of control. Then a proposal to improve the hotel is presented, based on Open Building levels of intervention: the urban fabric reconfiguring the base building and adding modular units that can house small businesses around collecting, recycling and selling materials. In the final analysis a scenario is painted as proof that interventions that create controllable space could be the first step towards improvement and could work as a template for similar cases.

50|$|An {{explosive}} situation erupts when a mob war thrusts a yakuza, an ex-cop, and his adolescent daughter into <b>a</b> deadly, <b>no-win</b> situation. Booted {{in disgrace}} from the L.A. police force Bob Malone suffers {{a seemingly endless}} unlucky streak. Matters don't improve when a robbery led by a crazed criminal transpires at the bank where Malone is filling out foreclosure papers. Witnessing the crime, something inside Malone snaps and he single-handedly wipes {{out most of the}} robber gang. Unfortunately, the ringleader escapes and Malone ends up jailed by his corrupt former colleague Lt. Tony Dussecq. At the same time, two Japanese yakuza arrive in L.A. to deliver a special message to L.A.'s most prominent Mafia don. The yakuza are in a restaurant when the bank robber (wearing a vest covered with explosives) bursts in and threatens to blow the place up. One of the Japanese, Koji, intervenes in an explosive sequence. He too ends up at the police station just as Malone's feisty teen daughter Chelsea arrives with bail money. The yakuza suddenly escapes, taking Chelsea and Malone with him as hostages. Now pursued by the crooked coppers and the mob, the unlikely threesome {{have no choice but to}} team up to survive.|$|R
5000|$|... "Best Friends Forever" [...] {{generally}} received positive {{reviews for}} its {{portrayal of the}} Terri Schiavo case. In her book The Deep End of South Park, Leslie Stratyner applauds the episode {{for its ability to}} [...] "tackle such challenging issues as...right to die in 'Best Friends Forever'...its 'devil-may-care' attitude that has brought a fair amount of acclaim". On a different aspect of the controversy, Jonathan Gray commented that the [...] "twist at the end with Kenny's final page of the will...illustrates just how crazy people become about everyday issues. The only thing Kenny didn't want came true as a result of those two sides". [...] Writing for the Chicago Sun Times, Jeff Shannon described the episode thus: [...] "Clearly aware that taking sides in the right-to-life debate would be <b>a</b> divisive, <b>no-win</b> strategy, Parker and Stone aimed their satirical arrows at the one aspect of the Schiavo case that's indisputably offensive: the horrendous media circus that turned a private matter into a shamefully public spectacle." [...] Jefferey Weinstock, in Taking South Park Seriously, praised the episode for its parody of the government and how it [...] "derides the use of government to enforce a narrowly-defined 'right-to-life' moral agenda presented as representative of God's will, a tactic predominantly associated with right-conservatives." ...|$|R

His accusations of deceit and manipulation by the board and by Redknapp have continued to cause ill-feeling.

500|$|Burrell's {{study found}} women {{consistently}} rating Clinton more favorably than men by about ten percentage points {{during her first}} lady years. Jacobson's study found a positive correlation across all senators between being women and receiving a partisan-polarized response. Colorado State University communication studies professor Karrin Vasby Anderson describes the first lady position as a [...] "site" [...] for American womanhood, one ready made for the symbolic negotiation of female identity. In particular anderson states {{there has been a}} cultural bias towards traditional first ladies and a cultural prohibition against modern first ladies; by the time of Clinton, the first lady position had become a site of heterogeneity and paradox. Burrell, as well as biographers Jeff Gerth and Don Van Natta Jr., note that Clinton achieved her highest approval ratings as first lady late in 1998, not for professional or political achievements of her own, but for being seen as the victim of her husband's very public infidelity. University of Pennsylvania communications professor Kathleen Hall Jamieson saw Clinton as an exemplar of the double bind, who though able to live in a [...] "both-and" [...] world of both career and family, nevertheless [...] "became a surrogate on whom we projected our attitudes about attributes once thought incompatible", leading to her being placed in <b>a</b> variety of <b>no-win</b> situations. Quinnipiac University media studies professor Lisa Burns found press accounts frequently framing Clinton both as an exemplar of the modern professional working mother and as a political interloper interested in usurping power for herself. University of Indianapolis English professor Charlotte Templin found political cartoonists using a variety of stereotypes—such as gender reversal, radical feminist as emasculator and the wife the husband wants to get rid of—to portray Clinton as violating gender norms.|$|R

Frank Deford of ESPN said that Chamberlain was caught in <b>a</b> <b>no-win</b> situation: [...] "If you win, everybody says, 'Well, look at him, he's that big.' If you lose, everybody says, 'How could he lose, a guy that size?' [...] " [...] Chamberlain himself often said: [...] "Nobody roots for Goliath." [...] Like later superstar Shaquille O'Neal, Chamberlain was a target of criticism because of his poor free throw shooting, an abysmal [...]511 career average, with a low of [...]380 over the 1967–68 season. Countless suggestions were offered; he shot them underhanded, one-handed, two-handed, {{from the side of the}} circle, from well behind the line, and even banked in. Sixers coach Alex Hannum once suggested he shoot his famous fadeaway jumper as a free throw, but Chamberlain feared drawing more attention to his one great failing. [...] Despite his foul line woes, Chamberlain set the NBA record (28) for free throws made in a regular season game in his 1962 100-point game.|$|E
500|$|Grim Fandango is an {{adventure}} game, {{in which the}} player controls Manuel [...] "Manny" [...] Calavera (calavera being Spanish for 'skull') as he follows Mercedes [...] "Meche" [...] Colomar in the Underworld. The game uses the GrimE engine, pre-rendering static backgrounds from 3D models, while the main objects and characters are animated in 3D. The player controls Manny's movements and actions with a keyboard, a joystick, or a gamepad. Manny must collect objects {{that can be used}} with either other collectible objects, parts of the scenery, or with other people in the Land of the Dead in order to solve puzzles and progress in the game. The game lacks any type of HUD. Unlike the earlier 2D LucasArts games, the player is informed of objects or persons of interest not by text floating on the screen when the player passes a cursor over them, but instead by the fact that Manny will turn his head towards that object or person as he walks by. The player reviews the inventory of items that Manny has collected by watching him pull each item {{in and out of his}} coat jacket. Manny can engage in dialogue with other characters through conversation trees to gain hints of what needs to be done to solve the puzzles or to progress the plot. As in most LucasArts adventure games, the player can never die or otherwise get into <b>a</b> <b>no-win</b> situation (that prevents completion of the game).|$|E
