[...] Examples are chlordane at 2% per weight of wool, toxaphene at 0.8%, pentachlorophenol or BHC at 0.5%, DDT at 0.2%, chlordecone and mirex at 0.06%, and dieldrin at 0.05%. Imidazole (a non-chloronated aromatic heterocyclic) at 1% also gave satisfactory protection. Besides solvent-based applications, insecticidal dusts were commonly used to treat fabrics. In the 1950s EQ-53, a DDT emulsion, was recommended by the US Department of Agriculture to add to the final rinse of washable woolens, but even then cautions were given to the use of chlorinated hydrocarbons on items subject to commercial drycleaning. The 1985 United States EPA ban on most uses of <b>Aldrin</b> <b>and</b> <b>Dieldrin</b> exempted moth-proofing in a closed manufacturing process.

40|$|This study aims {{to examine}} the {{efficiency}} of Opuntia ficus-indica for removing organochlorine pesticides from surface waters. Adsorption properties such as size, dose and time of O. ficus-indica for <b>aldrin,</b> <b>dieldrin</b> <b>and</b> DDT were studied through stirring and column methods. Because of their high affinity and swelling characteristics, dried O. ficus-indica was studied in stirring while fresh unpeeled O. ficus-indica was applied in both stirring and column experiments and proved to be well-suited to column application. Before removing pesticides, the column was flashed with distilled water to eliminate the turbidity and smell from fresh unpeeled cactus. The removal of pesticides increased with an increasing adsorbent dose and decreased with increased adsorbent particle sizes. The optimum adsorbent dose is 10 g for dried and 15 g for fresh unpeeled O. ficus- indica. The experimental results show that O. ficus-indica possesses strong adsorption ability for <b>aldrin,</b> <b>dieldrin</b> <b>and</b> DDT, and the adsorption isotherm data obeyed the Freundlich model.

In the United States, the production of these pesticides had been banned, although certain restricted uses were allowed. Studies have indicated that the estimated acute oral toxicity for humans is 65 mg/kg. Animal studies indicated that both had considerable potential for carcinogenic effects in humans, having produced tumors in mice. Dieldrin caused significant increases in lung and liver tumors at dietary doses as low as 0. 1 and 1 part per million, respectively. NIOSH recommends these two chemicals be handled in industry and the workplace as suspected occupational carcinogens, even though direct support evidence among humans is missing. Airborne concentrations of either chemical should not exceed 0. 15 mg/m 3. Skin contact should be avoided as they can both be absorbed through the skin. When dissolved in organic solvents, this percutaneous absorption is greatly increased.

40|$|Persistent pesticides, {{particularly}} of the organochlorine type, {{are currently being}} scrutinized to determine their poten-tial for causing human or environmental harm. Most uses of DDT were cancelled in June of 1972 by EPA order. The pro-duction of the insecticides <b>aldrin</b> <b>and</b> <b>dieldrin</b> was suspended for many uses in October of 1974 by ruling of EPA Adminis-trator Russell E. Train. The insecticide mirex, {{which is used to}} control the imported fire ant in large areas of southern United States, is currently the subject of a public fact-finding hearing. $ large amount of public awareness and interest is focused o n these actions [...] . The presence and distribution of insecticide residues in human tissue have been among t h e multitude of factors con-sidered in these regulatory decisions.

40|$|The {{population}} of the River Nyando catchment largely relies on rain fed agriculture for their subsistence. Important crops grown include cereals, cash crops fruits and vegetables. Farming {{is one of the}} contributors of pollution to Lake Victoria. Organophosphates and other banned organochlorine pesticides such as lindane, <b>aldrin</b> <b>and</b> <b>dieldrin</b> were used by farmers. The pesticides transport was by storm water run-off and air drift into the lake. Environmental risk assessment background information was collected through questionnaire and interviews of farmers to determine knowledge and safe use of pesticides. Fourteen pesticides were identified as commonly used of which four are toxic to bees and five to birds. The farmers identified declines in the number of pollinating insects, the disappearance of Red-billed Oxpecker (Buphagus erythrorthynchus) and wild bird’s fatalities. The general knowledge among farmers about chemicals risks, safety, and chronic illnesses was low. Activities that increases environmental awareness and safety of pesticides should be initiated by the agrochemical firms and government...|$|E

The primary data come from about 15 mainly regional investigation departments, the IKSR and the Environmental Specimen Bank. The chemical enterprises in Rheinfelden, Grenzach, Ludwigshafen, Lampertheim, Gernsheim, Darmstadt, Hoechst, Kelsterbach, Offenbach, Ingelheim, Loelsdorf, Leverkusen, Elberfeld, Krefeld-Uerdingen and Huels could partly be made transparent by {{the course of the}} sDDT and sHCH values and the profiles of the constituents and isomers, resp., in the distance profiles (especially from the river Rhine) mainly from 1990 / 92.

5000|$|The name Chlordane, or chlordan, is {{commonly}} used as both a specific chemical (with trans-and cis- isomers) and as a mixture of compounds (main components- heptachlor, chlordane, and nonachlor). This mixture, more specifically called technical chlordane, was first produced in the 1940s by Julius Hyman. Technical chlordane development was by chance, during a search for possible uses of a by-product of synthetic rubber manufacturing. By chlorinating this by-product, persistent and potent insecticides were easily and cheaply produced. The chlorine atoms, 7 {{in the case of}} heptachlor and 8 in chlordane, and 9 in the case of nonachlor, surround and stabilize the cyclodiene ring and thus these compounds are referred to as cyclodienes. Other members of the cyclodiene family of organochorine insecticides are <b>aldrin</b> <b>and</b> its epoxide, <b>dieldrin,</b> as well as endrin, which is a stereoisomer of dieldrin. These highly chlorinated cyclodienes are both resistant to degradation in the environment and in humans/animals and readily accumulate in lipids (fats) of human/animals.

40|$|In this work, {{a method}} for multiclass {{determination}} of 70 pesticides residues with different properties in drinking water using solid phase extraction (SPE) with polymeric sorbent and determination by gas and liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS and LC-MS/MS) was developed and validated. Different sample volumes, sorbents and elution solvents were evaluated. The best results were obtained using the sorbent Oasis® HLB, sample acidified at pH 2. 5 and a mixture of dichloromethane/methanol as eluent. The limit of quantification (LOD) of the method was 0. 02 µg L- 1 for <b>aldrin,</b> <b>dieldrin</b> <b>and</b> chlordane and 0. 5 µg L- 1 for the other compounds. Satisfactory accuracy, with recoveries between 70 and 117. 3 %, and good precision, with relative standard deviation (RSD) values below 19. 7 % {{for most of the}} compounds, were achieved. The validated method was applied to real water samples and results indicated that the proposed method is suitable for the determination of pesticide residues in water samples...|$|R
