2500|$|The {{official}} {{figures are}} too low {{to account for the}} <b>acute</b> <b>health</b> effects reported by some local residents and documented in two books; such health effects require exposure to at least 100,000 millirems (100 rems) to the whole body - 1000 times more than the official estimates. The reported health effects are consistent with high doses of radiation, and comparable to the experiences of cancer patients undergoing radio-therapy,. but have many other potential causes. The effects included [...] "metallic taste, erythema, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hair loss, deaths of pets and farm and wild animals, and damage to plants." [...] Some local statistics showed dramatic one-year changes among the most vulnerable: [...] "In Dauphin County, where the Three Mile Island plant is located, the 1979 death rate among infants under one year represented a 28 percent increase over that of 1978, and among infants under one month, the death rate increased by 54 percent." [...] Physicist Ernest Sternglass, a specialist in low-level radiation, noted these statistics in the 1981 edition of his book Secret Fallout: low-level radiation from Hiroshima to Three-Mile Island. In their final 1981 report, however, the Pennsylvania Department of Health, examining death rates within the 10-mile area around TMI for the 6 months after the accident, said that the TMI-2 accident did not cause local deaths of infants or fetuses.|$|E

40|$|Background: Health {{care systems}} are {{changing}} and with them, {{the role and}} scope of occupational therapy. The inpatient mental health setting is one area where change has been rapid and expansive, directly impacting {{on the role of}} occupational therapy. Literature pertaining to the current practice of occupational therapy in this setting is currently overshadowed by a focus on community-based care. This article aims to describe and summarize the recently published literature regarding current practices of occupational therapy in this important setting. Methods: Current practices were identified with reference to policy documents, text books and journal articles dating from 1990 to the present day. Findings: There was found to be a paucity of current literature relating to occupational therapy practice in <b>acute</b> mental <b>health.</b> From the literature that was available, four core elements of occupational therapy practice in <b>acute</b> mental <b>health</b> were identified: individual assessment, individual treatment, therapeutic groups, and discharge planning. Conclusions: It is suggested that the development and communication of the occupational therapy role focusing on the four core elements of practice will provide a sound base {{for the development of the}} clinical role of occupational therapy in <b>acute</b> mental <b>health.</b> Occupational therapists working in the <b>acute</b> mental <b>health</b> setting are encouraged to be aware of the available literature pertaining to this area and establish a renewed focus on clinical research to evaluate current practice and to guide debate on emerging occupational therapy roles.

This qualitative study examined the second attempt to implement a smoke-free policy in an <b>acute</b> mental <b>health</b> service in Queensland, Australia, to explore the facilitators and barriers to change. Post-process interviews conducted with ten clinicians and consumers revealed facilitators and barriers within themes of Culture, Wellbeing and Strategy. Key barriers included a negative institutional culture, fear and inconsistent application of the policy (associated with staff attrition, workloads, policy loopholes and resistance). Key facilitators were positive leadership, adequate resources, staff and consumer engagement, supportive formal policy, and staff unity. Analysis also suggested benefits in cultivating a non-restrictive, healthy and respectful environment, and deploying a clear, consistent strategy that includes planning, preparation, implementation and maintenance phases...|$|R

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} is to explore the lived {{experience}} of trauma informed care in <b>acute</b> mental <b>health</b> units as experienced by consumers of the service. Background: Consumers of mental health services have the highest rates of exposure to social trauma, interpersonal trauma and trauma-related mental health disorders. Equally, they experience high rates of stigmatisation, marginalisation and re-traumatisation when receiving care in mental health units. Trauma-informed care understands that consumers of mental health services have the highest prevalence of trauma and as such recognises that mental health nurses are in a powerful position to identify and respond to trauma. Trauma-informed care supports the foundations of a healthy organisational culture to provide recoveryorientated and consumer-driven mental health care. Design: The study is a qualitative phenomenological investigation of five consumers in <b>acute</b> mental <b>health</b> care. The study utilised van Manens approach to phenomenological enquiry. Results: The study found four overarching themes: ‘Not being heard’, ‘Biomedical model Vs holistic mental wellness’, ‘Power and control within the biomedical model’ and ‘Retraumatising environment’. Conclusion: The findings have demonstrated that mental health services may further retraumatise and victimise consumers of mental health services. The study demonstrated that consumers experienced not being heard and as though they were being silenced in <b>acute</b> mental <b>health</b> settings. The current biomedical model in mental health appears to act as a barrier to genuine engagement with consumers. The study has highlighted the urgent need for mental health units to become trauma-aware, trauma sensitive, trauma-responsive and trauma- informed. Relevance to Clinical Practice: <b>Acute</b> mental <b>health</b> units can traumatise or re-traumatise consumers. Trauma-informed care is a well-suited strength-based recovery orientated approach to mental health care...|$|R

40|$|People {{diagnosed}} with borderline personality disorder (BPD) are highly prevalent in <b>acute</b> mental <b>health</b> wards, with staff nurses identifying {{a challenge in}} working with people who can be significantly distressed. This has contributed to a negative stereotype verging on stigmatization. Mentalization-based therapy (MBT) is a psychological therapy which {{has been shown to}} be of benefit to people with a diagnosis of BPD, yet it has been utilized and evaluated only in partial hospitalization and outpatient settings. Despite this, most people {{diagnosed with}} BPD will continue to be treated in generic inpatient settings such as <b>acute</b> mental <b>health.</b> Mentalization-based therapy skills training (MBT-S) is a new and cost-effective 2 -day workshop aiming to provide generalist practitioners with MBT skills for use in generic settings. This study aimed to capture staff perceptions of the impact of MBT-S on their practice when working with people with a diagnosis of BPD in <b>acute</b> mental <b>health.</b> Through two focus groups, this study assessed the perceptions of nine staff nurses. An interpretive phenomenological approach was utilized in data analysis. Participants found the approach easy to grasp, improving of consistency between staff and flexible in its use in planned or ‘off the cuff’ discussions. MBT-S promoted empathy and humane responses to self-harm, impacted on participants ability to tolerate risk and went some way to turning the negative perception of BPD through changing the notion of patients as ‘deliberately difficult’. Staff felt empowered and more confident in working with people with a diagnosis of BPD. The positive implication for practice was the ease in which the approach was adopted and participants perception of MBT-S as an empowering skill set which also contributed to attitudinal change. In <b>acute</b> mental <b>health</b> environments, which may not have the resources to provide long-term structured treatments to patients, MBT-S could be viewed as ideal as participants applauded its flexibility. The promotion of empathy also sees a move away from iatrogenic damage caused by unhelpful responses to self-harm. In the context of wider research, this study shows that staff nurses find the MBT-S skill set valuable in the generic inpatient setting of <b>acute</b> mental <b>health...</b>|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{focus of}} this paper is to {{consider}} the findings of a survey, which aims to identify the types of training that <b>acute</b> mental <b>health</b> staff could access, in relation to workforce development and substance misuse issues in <b>acute</b> mental <b>health</b> care. Design/methodology/approach – An electronic survey was developed and distributed using work email lists to all clinicians who worked in <b>acute</b> mental <b>health</b> services across a region in England. Not all NHS organisations agreed to participate. Findings – A total of 89 clinicians responded to the survey, some failed to indicate their consent, therefore the results of the 77 that did are presented. The main finding was that most acute care staff had only accessed mandatory training such as risk assessment. Many staff had not been trained in the use of psychosocial approaches. Drug and alcohol specific activities were performed on the whole only “sometimes”. Research limitations/implications – It was not possible to determine the total number of potentially eligible staff who were sent the survey, therefore, response rates cannot be calculated. It is possible that the findings may not be generalisable to other services. There may be bias in those who choose to respond to an electronic email, in terms of those who had access to a computer or who were more IT literate. In addition, the survey did not specifically set out to examine substance misuse issues as its main focus. Practical implications – Acute care staff work with service users with increasingly complex needs. Creative and cost effective ways of facilitating access to training and support must be found as a priority to ensure that staff have the competencies to identify and manage substance users effectively in <b>acute</b> mental <b>health</b> settings. Originality/value – The findings reinforce previous studies highlighting the deficit in access to psychosocial interventions training for acute care staff...|$|R
