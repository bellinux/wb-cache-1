5|$|The Parthian Empire, being {{culturally}} and politically heterogeneous, had {{a variety of}} religious systems and beliefs, the most widespread being those dedicated to Greek <b>and</b> <b>Iranian</b> cults. Aside from a minority of Jews and early Christians, most Parthians were polytheistic. Greek <b>and</b> <b>Iranian</b> deities were often blended together as one. For example, Zeus was often equated with Ahura Mazda, Hades with Angra Mainyu, Aphrodite and Hera with Anahita, Apollo with Mithra, and Hermes with Shamash. Aside from the main gods and goddesses, each ethnic group and city had their own designated deities. As with Seleucid rulers, Parthian art indicates that the Arsacid kings viewed themselves as gods; this cult of the ruler {{was perhaps the most}} widespread.|$|E
5|$|Darejan and {{her party}} were resolutely opposed to George XII's renewed {{quest for the}} Russian protection. In 1800, one of Darejan's sons, Alexander, openly broke with his {{half-brother}} and attempted a coup {{with the help of}} his Avar <b>and</b> <b>Iranian</b> allies. The relations in the royal family hit the nadir in July 1800, when George XII forced Queen Dowager Darejan into confinement at her palace in Avlabari, prompting Darejan's sons to mobilize their loyal forces around Tbilisi.|$|E

It {{was more than}} a decade before the British <b>and</b> <b>Iranian</b> governments came to an agreement whereby the United Kingdom would repair the damage to the embassy in London and Iran would pay for repairs to the British embassy in Tehran, which had been damaged during the 1979 Iranian Revolution.

5|$|The ethnogenesis of Croats is {{uncertain}} {{and there are}} several competing theories, Slavic <b>and</b> <b>Iranian</b> being the most frequently put forward. The most widely accepted of these, the Slavic theory, proposes migration of White Croats from the territory of White Croatia during the Migration Period. Conversely, the Iranian theory proposes Iranian origin, based on Tanais Tablets containing Greek inscription of given names Χορούαθ, Χοροάθος, and Χορόαθος (Khoroúathos, Khoroáthos, and Khoróathos) and their interpretation as anthroponyms of Croatian people.|$|E

5|$|Parthian art can {{be divided}} into three geo-historical phases: the art of Parthia proper; the art of the Iranian plateau; and the art of Parthian Mesopotamia. The first genuine Parthian art, found at Mithridatkert/Nisa, {{combined}} elements of Greek <b>and</b> <b>Iranian</b> art in line with Achaemenid and Seleucid traditions. In the second phase, Parthian art found inspiration in Achaemenid art, as exemplified by the investiture relief of Mithridates II at Mount Behistun. The third phase occurred gradually after the Parthian conquest of Mesopotamia.|$|E
5|$|The {{conflict}} ended soon after, in {{an effective}} stalemate and a formal compromise: a Parthian prince of the Arsacid line would henceforth {{sit on the}} Armenian throne, but his nomination had {{to be approved by}} the Roman emperor. This conflict was the first direct confrontation between Parthia and the Romans since Crassus' disastrous expedition and Mark Antony's campaigns a century earlier, and would be the first of a long series of wars between Rome <b>and</b> <b>Iranian</b> powers over Armenia (see Roman–Persian Wars).|$|E
5|$|Apart from team records, {{individual}} records were also broken in the match. Australia's Archie Thompson, who only had two international caps and one international goal {{prior to the}} match, scored 13 goals in the match and broke the record for most goals scored in an international match. David Zdrilic scored 8 goals and was widely reported as having recorded the second most goals scored in an international match, after Thompson's 13 goals. In fact, his figure was less than the previous record of 10 goals, which was achieved by Denmark's Sophus Nielsen at the 1908 Olympics and Germany's Gottfried Fuchs at the 1912 Olympics. Nevertheless, this made Zdrilic's total the second highest in almost 90 years. Thompson also equalled the world record for most goals scored in a recognized senior match, set in 1885 when John Petrie scored 13 goals in Arbroath's 36–0 win over Bon Accord in a Scottish Cup tournament. The previous record in a World Cup qualifying match was seven goals and was jointly held by another Australian, Gary Cole, against Fiji in the 1982 World Cup qualification on 14 August 1981, <b>and</b> <b>Iranian</b> Karim Bagheri, against Maldives in the 1998 World Cup qualification on 2 June 1997.|$|E

5|$|In 263, {{after his}} return, Odaenathus assumed the title King of Kings of the East (Mlk Mlk), {{and headed to}} Antioch, the {{traditional}} capital of Syria, where he crowned his son Hairan I as co-King of Kings. The title {{was a symbol of}} legitimacy in the East, starting with the Assyrians then the Achaemenids who used it to symbolize their supremacy over all other rulers and was adopted by the Parthian monarchs following their defeat of the Seleucids to legitimize their conquests. The first Sassanian monarch Ardashir I adopted the title following his victory over the Parthians. Odaenathus' son was crowned with a diadem and a tiara; the choice of the location was probably meant to express that the Palmyrene monarchs were now the successors of the Seleucid <b>and</b> <b>Iranian</b> rulers who controlled Syria and Mesopotamia in the past.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{shareholder}} on the Arsenal {{board is}} American sports tycoon Stan Kroenke. Kroenke first launched {{a bid for}} the club in April 2007, and faced competition for shares from Red and White Securities, which acquired its first shares off David Dein in August 2007. Red & White Securities was co-owned by Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov <b>and</b> <b>Iranian</b> London-based financier Farhad Moshiri, though Usmanov bought Moshiri's stake in 2016. Kroenke came close to the 30% takeover threshold in November 2009, when he increased his holding to 18,594 shares (29.9%). In April 2011, Kroenke achieved a full takeover by purchasing the shareholdings of Nina Bracewell-Smith and Danny Fiszman, taking his shareholding to 62.89%. As of May 2017, Kroenke owns 41,721 shares (67.05%) and Red & White Securities own 18,695 shares (30.04%). Ivan Gazidis has been the club's Chief Executive since 2009.|$|E
5|$|The long {{civil war}} {{shattered}} {{the social and}} political order of the early Abbasid state, and a new system began to emerge under al-Ma'mun, which would characterize the middle period of the Abbasid Caliphate. The most tangible change was in the elites who supported the new regime: the abnaʾ, the old Arab families {{and the members of the}} Abbasid dynasty itself lost their positions in the administrative and military machinery, and with them their influence and power. The provinces of the Caliphate were now grouped into larger units, often controlled by a hereditary dynasty, like the Tahirids in Khurasan or the Samanids in Transoxiana, usually of Iranian descent. At the same time, however, al-Ma'mun tried to lessen his dependence on the Iranian element of his empire, and counterbalanced them through the creation of two new military corps: his brother Abu Ishaq's Turkish slaves, and the Arab tribal army of the Byzantine frontier, which was now reorganized and placed under the command of al-Ma'mun's son al-Abbas. This system was further elaborated and acquired its definite characteristics in the reign of Abu Ishaq (al-Mu'tasim), who created a tightly controlled, centralized state, and expanded his Turkish corps into an effective military force with which he waged campaigns against the Byzantines and internal rebellions alike. The Turkish leaders came to political power as provincial governors, while the old Arab <b>and</b> <b>Iranian</b> elites were completely sidelined. Al-Ma'mun's victory also had repercussions in the Abbasid official theological doctrine: in 829, al-Ma'mun adopted Mu'tazilism, in an attempt reconcile doctrinal differences in Islam and reduce social inequities.|$|E

50|$|On September 26, 2012, Iranian Foreign Ministry advised all Iranian {{citizens}} against travelling to Canada due {{to increasing}} Islamophobia and Iranophobia.

40|$|This study investigates {{and compares}} {{compliment}} response strategies (CRS) among Malays <b>and</b> <b>Iranians</b> {{with the aim}} of performing a semantic and pragmatic analysis of complimentary speech acts among Malays <b>and</b> <b>Iranians.</b> The data were collected through the use of interview and Discourse Completion Task (DCT), using eight complimentary sentences. Two were on appearance, two on character, two on ability and two on possession. A total of thirty university-students of the University of Malaya and University Putra Malaysia participated in the study over a period of three months. The findings demonstrated that all Malays <b>and</b> <b>Iranians</b> accepted most of compliments but Malays tended to reject more than Iranians. Although both groups accepted compliments, their strategies for acceptance were different from each other; Malays used more evade strategies than Iranians. Also Iranians used "taarof" strategy as a specific strategy related to Iranian culture for accepting a compliment. The most interesting thing was that "Thank you" was used for accepting compliments as the most frequent strategy among both groups...|$|R

50|$|In 755, Abu Muslim was murdered.
