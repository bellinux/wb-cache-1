25|$|The {{immediate}} livelihood benefits {{derived by}} rural households bolster strong collective action wherein local communities actively and sustainably manage forest resources. Community forests also became {{the source of}} diversified investment capital and raw material for new market-oriented livelihoods. Community forestry shows traits of political, financial, and ecological sustainability, including an emergence of a strong legal and regulatory framework, and robust civil society institutions and networks. However, a continuing challenge is to ensure equitable distribution of benefits to women and marginalised groups. Lessons for replication emphasise experiential learning, establishment of a strong civil society network, flexible regulation to encourage diverse institutional modalities, and responsiveness of government <b>and</b> <b>policymakers</b> to a multistakeholder collaborative learning process.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} the mid-1990s, Chinese {{officials}} began to organize study tours {{to learn from the}} successes and failures of other countries in combating HIV/AIDS and to bring back information about strategies for HIV/AIDS control that could be adapted for China. Tour groups including officials from the Ministries of Health, Public Security, Justice, Education and Finance, Commissions of Development and Reform, and Population and Family Planning, as well as law <b>and</b> <b>policymakers</b> from the State Council, visited many places, including Australia, the United States, Brazil, Thailand, Europe, and Africa. These tours provided an opportunity for officials to learn from their counterparts in other countries, as well as promoting relationships between the different Chinese government sectors that participated in the study tours.|$|E
25|$|In March 2006, the State Council of the People's Republic of China officially {{announced}} the first legislation directly aimed at controlling HIV/AIDS: the AIDS Prevention and Control Regulations. These regulations, {{together with the}} Five-Year Action Plan to Control HIV/AIDS (2006–2010), are {{an important step in}} the development of government policy related to the care and prevention of HIV/AIDS. Although considered bold, these regulations were passed more than 20 years after the first case of HIV infection was identified, which was recently proven. The development of a coherent policy {{was the result of a}} long and unsystematic process that involved initial missteps, said Bauer, considerable domestic and international education, debate, and trivial amounts of iterative trial-and-error learning. The new legislation resulted from communication and coordination among many agencies, including administrators, service providers, lobbyists, politicians, <b>and</b> <b>policymakers.</b>|$|E

25|$|Retirement of the Baby Boom generation—which by 2030 is {{projected}} to increase enrollment to more than 80 million {{as the number of}} workers per enrollee declines from 3.7 to 2.4—and rising overall health care costs pose substantial financial challenges to the program. Medicare spending {{is projected}} to increase from $523 billion in 2010 to just over $1 trillion by 2022. Baby-boomers' health is also an important factor: 20% have five or more chronic conditions, which will add to the future cost of health care (www.cms.gov, 2012). In response to these financial challenges, Congress made substantial cuts to future payouts to providers as part of PPACA in 2010 and the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA) <b>and</b> <b>policymakers</b> have offered a number of additional competing proposals to reduce Medicare costs further.|$|E

After an engine fell off a McDonnell Douglas DC-10, causing it to crash with the loss of all passengers and crew in 1979, Conrad spearheaded McDonnell Douglas's ultimately unsuccessful efforts to allay the fears of the public <b>and</b> <b>policymakers,</b> and save the plane's reputation. In 1980, he was promoted to Senior Vice President of marketing. From 1982 to 1984, Conrad served as the Senior Vice President of marketing and product support.

25|$|Overall {{health care}} costs were {{projected}} in 2011 to increase by 5.8 percent annually from 2010 to 2020, {{in part because of}} increased utilization of medical services, higher prices for services, and new technologies. Health care costs are rising across the board, but the cost of insurance has risen dramatically for families and employers as well as the federal government. In fact, since 1970 the per-capita cost of private coverage has grown roughly one percentage point faster each year than the per-capita cost of Medicare. Since the late 1990s, Medicare has performed especially well relative to private insurers. Over the next decade, Medicare’s per capita spending is projected to grow at a rate of 2.5 percent each year, compared to private insurance’s 4.8 percent. Nonetheless, most experts <b>and</b> <b>policymakers</b> agree containing {{health care costs}} is essential to the nation’s fiscal outlook. Much of the debate over the future of Medicare revolves around whether per capita costs should be reduced by limiting payments to providers or by shifting more costs to Medicare enrollees.|$|E
