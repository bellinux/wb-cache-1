The influence of stage congruence between physical <b>activity</b> <b>and</b> fruit and vegetable intake on multiple behavior change was also investigated. Health behaviors, social-cognitions, and stages of change were assessed in 2693 adults at two points in time. Physical <b>activity</b> <b>and</b> fruit and vegetable intake were assessed 4 weeks after the baseline. Social-cognitions, stages as well as stage transitions across behavior domains were positively interrelated.

40|$|AbstractEvidence {{has shown}} that hyperlipidemia is {{associated}} with retinoid dyshomeostasis. In liver, retinol is mainly oxidized to retinal by retinol dehydrogenases (RDHs) and alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs), further converted to retinoic acid by retinal dehydrogenases (RALDHs). The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether high-fat diet (HFD) induced hyperlipidemia affected <b>activity</b> <b>and</b> expression of hepatic ADHs/RDHs and RALDHs in rats. Results showed that retinol levels in liver, kidney and adipose tissue of HFD rats were significantly increased, while plasma retinol and hepatic retinal levels were markedly decreased. HFD rats exhibited significantly downregulated hepatic ADHs/RDHs <b>activity</b> <b>and</b> Adh 1, Rdh 10 and Dhrs 9 expression. Oppositely, hepatic RALDHs <b>activity</b> <b>and</b> Raldh 1 expression were upregulated in HFD rats. In HepG 2 cells, treatment of HFD rat serum inhibited ADHs/RDHs <b>activity</b> <b>and</b> induced RALDHs <b>activity.</b> Among the tested abnormally altered components in HFD rat serum, cholesterol reduced ADHs/RDHs <b>activity</b> <b>and</b> RDH 10 expression, while induced RALDHs <b>activity</b> <b>and</b> RALDH 1 expression in HepG 2 cells. Contrary to the effect of cholesterol, cholesterol-lowering agent pravastatin upregulated ADHs/RDHs <b>activity</b> <b>and</b> RDH 10 expression, while suppressed RALDHs <b>activity</b> <b>and</b> RALDH 1 expression. In conclusion, hyperlipidemia oppositely altered <b>activity</b> <b>and</b> expression of hepatic ADHs/RDHs and RALDHs, which is partially due to the elevated cholesterol levels...|$|R
40|$|Background: Health {{scholars}} purport that park proximity {{and social}} support promotes physical <b>activity</b> <b>and</b> health. However, few studies examine the combined contributions of these constructs in shaping physical <b>activity</b> <b>and</b> health. Purpose: In this study, the contributions of environmental and social characteristics in shaping park use, physical <b>activity,</b> <b>and</b> health are examined. Methods: A survey was distributed to 1515 older adults in Cleveland, Ohio. Results: Path analysis indicated that social support was directly related to health. Perceived park walking proximity was related to physical <b>activity</b> <b>and</b> health through park use frequency. Park proximity was directly related to park use duration.

40|$|Even though {{physical}} <b>activity</b> <b>and</b> sedentary behaviour are {{two distinct}} behaviours, their interdependent relationship {{needs to be}} studied in the same environment. This study examines the influence of urban design, neighbourhood built and social environment, and household and individual factors on the interdependent relationship between objectively measured physical <b>activity</b> <b>and</b> sedentary behaviour in children in the Canadian city of Saskatoon. Saskatoon’s built environment was assessed by two validated observation tools. Neighbourhood socioeconomic variables were derived from 2006 Statistics Canada Census and 2010 G 5 Census projections. A questionnaire was administered to 10 – 14 year old children to collect individual and household data, followed by accelerometry to collect physical <b>activity</b> <b>and</b> sedentary behaviour data. Multilevel logistic regression models were developed to understand the interrelationship between physical <b>activity</b> <b>and</b> sedentary behaviour {{in the context of}} diverse environmental exposures. A complex set of factors including denser built environment, positive peer relationships and consistent parental support influenced the interrelationship between physical <b>activity</b> <b>and</b> sedentary behaviour. In developing interventions to facilitate active living, it is not only imperative to delineate pathways through which diverse environmental exposures influence physical <b>activity</b> <b>and</b> sedentary behaviour, but also to account for the interrelationship between physical <b>activity</b> <b>and</b> sedentary behaviour...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{chemotherapy}} on natural killer (NK) <b>activity</b> <b>and</b> antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) in 15 advanced carcinomas of the lung was examined {{with regard to}} the drug, dose, route and timing of administration. The relationship between the effect of chemotherapy on the prognosis for the patients, and the changes in NK <b>activity</b> <b>and</b> ADCC, was also analysed. The NK <b>activity</b> <b>and</b> ADCC in patients with poor prognosis were significantly subnormal, even before treatment. The NK <b>activity</b> <b>and</b> ADCC began to decrease 2 weeks after the initiation of treatment and reached the lowest level during the 3 rd or 4 th week in all patients. Thereafter, they returned to the pretreatment level in 8 patients with stabilized disease. In contrast, they were not restored in 7 patients with progressive disease and poor prognosis. In 4 patients {{it was found that the}} effect of chemotherapy with pepleomycin and carbazilquinone on NK <b>activity</b> <b>and</b> ADCC differed according to the drug used. From this pilot study it is suggested that NK <b>activity</b> <b>and</b> ADCC are valuable prognostic factors in patients with advanced carcinoma of the lung, and that detailed analysis of the effect of each anticancer agent on NK <b>activity</b> <b>and</b> ADCC is desirable for the establishment of better treatment regimens for advanced carcinoma of the lung...|$|R
