5|$|A {{central part}} of the show's premise was that the main {{character}} would be handicapped. The initial idea was for House to use a wheelchair, but Fox turned down this interpretation (for which the crew was later grateful). The wheelchair idea turned into <b>a</b> <b>scar</b> <b>on</b> House's face, which later turned into a bad leg necessitating use of a cane. The original script called for House to be 34 years old; however, Shore later explained {{that he did not want}} the character to be that young.|$|E

5|$|At the SSR, Carter learns {{from the}} {{crippled}} war veteran Agent Daniel Sousa that the chauvinistic and promotion-seeking Agent Jack Thompson is following a lead on club owner Spider Raymond, {{who is looking}} to fence Stark's inventions. Raymond indeed sells the formula to the silent Leet Brannis. Infiltrating the club in disguise, Carter breaks into Raymond's safe and discovers that the formula has already {{been turned into a}} weapon. By the time Thompson gets there, Raymond is dead, killed by a man in a green suit, who follows Carter back to her apartment and kills her roommate. Carter pushes him out a window, and notices that he has <b>a</b> <b>scar</b> <b>on</b> his neck where his voice box once was. After attempting to comfort her, Stark's butler Edwin Jarvis takes Carter to see Dr. Anton Vanko at Stark Industries, who deduces that the weapon was created at a Roxxon Oil refinery.|$|E
5|$|Light Yagami, {{the true}} {{identity}} of Kira, discovers {{the location of}} Mello's hideout. An indirect result {{of this is that}} Mello meets the Shinigami Sidoh, the original owner of Mello's Death Note. Sidoh reveals to him—in exchange for some of Mello's chocolate—that there are two extra fake rules (in addition to a number of real ones specified to each Death Note's owner). Mello begins to theorize that whoever Kira is, he probably used these spurious rules to fool the Japanese police into thinking he is innocent. However, Light launches a SWAT team led by Soichiro to raid the hideout. In order to escape, Mello detonates remote-controlled explosives, after one of his Mafia accomplices fatally wounds Soichiro. Mello is left with <b>a</b> <b>scar</b> <b>on</b> his face, and the failure of his Mafia scheme leaves his real name in Light's hands.|$|E

25|$|She was {{estimated}} to be between 20 and 28 years old and had been raped. Basic physical examination showed she was about 5 feet 5 inches tall and weighed about 118 pounds. The victim was white with possible Hispanic ancestry, as she had brown or black hair and brown eyes.

She also had <b>an</b> inch-long <b>scar</b> <b>on</b> the back of her left thigh.|$|R
5|$|Sometime after Lochry's Defeat, Brant and Simon Girty {{got into}} an altercation along the Ohio River. According to {{contemporary}} gossip, Girty took exception to Brant's boasting about {{the success of the}} expedition, perhaps because Girty believed his brother George deserved more credit. The two men, who were reportedly drunk, came to blows, which ended when Brant slashed Girty in the head with his sword. The wound, which took several months to heal, left <b>a</b> <b>scar</b> <b>on</b> Girty's forehead. When Brant returned to Detroit in October, he had a sword cut on his leg, which had become infected and initially looked as if it would result in amputation. The wound was officially reported as accidentally self-inflicted, although gossipers said that it {{was the result of the}} fight with Girty. Brant's Iroquois companions returned home, but Brant was compelled to stay in Detroit over the winter in order to recover.|$|E
5|$|In orbit, the Enterprise {{crew and}} Jameson beam {{down into the}} tunnels beneath Karnas' manor, but find that their arrival was {{anticipated}} and face off against armed guards. Jameson collapses during the fight, and the crew beams back to the Enterprise, where they discover Jameson was not shot but instead the reverse aging drug is destroying his body. Karnas demands to see Jameson or he will kill a hostage every 15 minutes. Picard opts to beam himself, Dr. Crusher (Gates McFadden), Jameson, and eventually Jameson's wife Anne directly to Karnas' office. Though Karnas initially refuses {{to believe that the}} young man is Jameson, Picard shows him the images of his reverse aging {{over the last few days}} after which Jameson reveals <b>a</b> <b>scar</b> <b>on</b> his wrist inflicted by Karnas years ago. Karnas prepares to fire on Jameson to get his revenge, but decides to get his revenge by watching Jameson suffer and die horribly from the drug instead. Jameson dies shortly afterward in his wife's embrace. Karnas agrees to let the hostages go, and to allow Jameson to be buried on Mordan IV at Anne's request.|$|E
5|$|On 8 June 1999, Kouao took Climbié {{to a local}} GP surgery. The {{practice}} nurse {{there did}} not carry out a physical examination as she was not reported to have any current health problems. By the middle of June 1999, Victoria was spending the majority of her days at the Brent home of Priscilla Cameron, an unregistered childminder, who Kouao met at {{her job at the}} hospital. There is no evidence that Climbié was treated badly during her time with Cameron. On several occasions, Cameron observed small cuts to Climbié's fingers. When questioned by Cameron, Kouao said that they were caused by razor blades that Climbié played with. Kouao and Victoria met Ackah on the street on or around 14 June 1999. In what may have been early signs of deliberate physical harm, Ackah noted <b>a</b> <b>scar</b> <b>on</b> Climbié's cheek, which Kouao said was caused by a fall on an escalator. On 17 June 1999, in response to what she had seen three days earlier, Ackah visited Kouao and Climbié's home, and thought that the accommodation was unsuitable.|$|E

25|$|The {{case that}} brought Spilsbury to public {{attention}} {{was that of}} Hawley Harvey Crippen in 1910, where he gave forensic evidence as to the likely identity of the human remains found in Crippen's house. Spilsbury concluded that <b>a</b> <b>scar</b> <b>on</b> {{a small piece of}} skin from the remains pointed to Mrs Crippen as the victim.|$|E
25|$|The {{research}} team {{also argued that}} <b>a</b> <b>scar</b> <b>on</b> the abdomen of the body, which the Crown Prosecution interpreted as a scar consistent with one Mrs. Crippen was known to have, convincing the jury that the remains were Mrs. Crippen’s, was incorrectly identified, because the tissue had hair follicles, whereas scars do not (a point which Crippen's defence argued at the time).|$|E
25|$|On 1 March 2012, the {{advocate}} depute led evidence from Sgt Paul Grainger of Lothian and Borders Police.

Sgt Grainger told the court that during the interview he noticed <b>a</b> <b>scar</b> <b>on</b> Mr Gilroy's forehead under his hairline and {{that there had been}} some sort of scratch on his chin. The court also heard that Gilroy had told police, that on the evening of 2 May 2010 he and Suzanne Pilley had decided to split up and then took part in a Buddhist-style religious ceremony, writing their feelings down on pieces of paper and burning them.|$|E

25|$|Thorondor first {{enters the}} {{narrative}} when {{he helped the}} Elven-prince Fingon rescue his kinsman Maedhros from imprisonment upon Thangorodrim. After the Dagor Bragollach, he saved Fingolfin's body from defilement by his slayer Morgoth, giving the Dark Lord <b>a</b> <b>scar</b> <b>on</b> his face and carrying the Elven-king's corpse to the Encircling Mountains north of Gondolin, where it was buried by Turgon. Shortly afterwards, Thorondor espied Húrin and Huor {{at the feet of}} the Mountains, and sent two of his servants to fetch them and bear them to Gondolin, fulfilling thus the intentions of the Vala Ulmo. Thorondor and two other eagles rescued Lúthien and the wounded Beren from the doors of Angband during their Quest of the Silmaril, taking them to Doriath.|$|E
25|$|Philodendrons {{also produce}} cataphylls, which are {{modified}} leaves that surround {{and protect the}} newly forming leaves. Cataphylls are usually green, leaf-like, and rigid while they are protecting the leaf. In some species, they can even be rather succulent. Once the leaf has been fully formed, the cataphyll usually remains attached where the stem and base of the leaf meet. In philodendrons, cataphylls typically fall into two categories: deciduous and persistent types. A deciduous cataphyll curls away from the leaf once it has formed, eventually turning brown and drying out, and finally falling off the plant, leaving <b>a</b> <b>scar</b> <b>on</b> the stem where it was attached. Deciduous cataphylls are typically found on vining philodendrons, whereas persistent cataphylls are typical of epiphytic philodendrons or appressed climbers. In the latter, the cataphylls are prevented from falling off {{in a timely manner}} due to the short internodes of the plant. The cataphylls will remain attached, drying out and becoming nothing more than fibers attached at the nodes. In some philodendrons, the cataphylls build up over time and eventually form a wet mass at the nodes. This may keep emerging roots moist and provide some form of lubrication to new leaves.|$|E
25|$|On January 2, 1972, Gacy {{picked up}} 16-year-old Timothy Jack McCoy from Chicago's Greyhound bus terminal. Gacy took McCoy—who was {{traveling}} from Michigan to Omaha—on a sightseeing tour of Chicago, and then {{drove him to}} his home with the promise that he could spend the night and be driven back to the station {{in time to catch}} his bus. According to Gacy's later account of the murder, he awoke the following morning to find McCoy standing in his bedroom doorway with a kitchen knife in his hand. Gacy leapt from his bed and McCoy raised both arms in a gesture of surrender, tilting the knife upwards and accidentally cutting Gacy's forearm (Gacy had <b>a</b> <b>scar</b> <b>on</b> his arm to support this account). He then twisted the knife from McCoy's wrist, banged his head against his bedroom wall, kicked him against his wardrobe and walked towards him. McCoy then kicked him in the stomach and Gacy grabbed the youth, wrestled him to the floor, then stabbed him repeatedly in the chest as he straddled him with his body. Gacy claimed he then went to his kitchen and saw an opened carton of eggs and a slab of unsliced bacon on his kitchen table. McCoy had also set the table for two; he had walked into Gacy's room to wake him while absentmindedly carrying the kitchen knife in his hand. Gacy subsequently buried McCoy in his crawl space and later covered the youth's grave with a layer of concrete.|$|E
