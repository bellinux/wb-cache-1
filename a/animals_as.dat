5|$|Washington was a {{lover of}} exotic <b>animals,</b> <b>as</b> well as gardening. He {{maintained}} extensive menageries on his country properties, first at Bellport, and later at Mendham. On Long Island, it is reported that he was often seen with a bird or monkey on his shoulder. At both his menageries, Washington specialized in rare birds, but such <b>animals</b> <b>as</b> deer, sheep, goats, and antelope are also recorded at Bellport, and deer, llamas, and zebras are recorded {{among the hundreds of}} animals in the larger space at Mendham. Socially, he was {{an active member of the}} Lotos Club, a literary gentlemen's club in New York City.|$|E
5|$|<b>Animals</b> <b>as</b> a {{category}} have several characteristics that generally set {{them apart from}} other living things. Animals are eukaryotic and usually multicellular (although see Myxozoa), which separates them from bacteria, archaea, and most protists. They are heterotrophic, generally digesting food in an internal chamber, which separates them from plants and algae. They are also distinguished from plants, algae, and fungi by lacking cell walls.|$|E

5|$|Farmers use live {{electric}} wires to guard their farms, which kills other <b>animals</b> <b>as</b> well. Farmers in Neemuch (Madhya Pradesh) {{went on a}} hunger strike in 2015 demanding {{compensation for the damage}} caused by nilgai. Although blackbuck cause a similar problem, the damage caused by them is significantly lower as they merely break off young shoots. A 1990 study suggested culling, building enclosures for the antelopes and fencing off agricultural areas as remedies for the menace.|$|E
5|$|Flotilla is a 2010 turn-based {{strategy}} space combat {{video game}} developed by Brendon Chung's studio, Blendo Games. The game {{was released in}} March 2010 on Steam for Microsoft Windows and on Xbox Live Indie Games for the Xbox 360. Flotilla was designed with Microsoft's XNA tools, and its development was influenced by <b>animals</b> <b>as</b> well as board games such as Axis and Allies and Arkham Horror. The game takes the player in an adventure through a randomly generated galaxy.|$|E

5|$|Linnaeus, who {{classified}} most {{kinds of}} sessile <b>animals</b> <b>as</b> {{belonging to the}} order Zoophyta in the class Vermes, mistakenly identified the genus Spongia as plants in the order Algae. For a long time thereafter sponges were assigned to a separate subkingdom, Parazoa ("beside the animals"), separate from the Eumetazoa which formed {{the rest of the}} kingdom Animalia. They have been regarded as a paraphyletic phylum, from which the higher animals have evolved. Other research indicates Porifera is monophyletic.|$|E
5|$|Ponies are taxonomically {{the same}} <b>animals</b> <b>as</b> horses.

However, height alone is not dispositive; the difference between horses and ponies may also include aspects of phenotype, including conformation and temperament.|$|E

5|$|The idea {{of using}} {{anthropomorphic}} furry <b>animals</b> <b>as</b> protagonists in a story set in the American West pre-dated Popol Out West by several years. In December 1931, Hergé produced Tim-L'Ésureuil, Héros du Far-West ("Tim the Squirrel, Hero of the Far West") for L'Innovation, a large department store in Brussels. Printed in colour, it was serialised in 16 weekly installments, and was aimed to encourage children's interest in the store.|$|E
5|$|The natural poison fluoroacetate (Compound 1080) is {{commonly}} used in Australia to control introduced pests such as European rabbits, foxes, feral predators, and wild dogs such as dingoes. The poison is extremely toxic to introduced pests, but less so to native <b>animals</b> <b>as</b> it is found naturally in many Australian plants. However, juvenile quolls may be susceptible to the poison. Research is underway {{to determine whether the}} number of quolls protected from predators may be less than those killed by the poison.|$|E

The text includes the names of over 40 herbs used for recipes of veterinary care.|$|E

5|$|Belle Vue was {{the first}} privately financed zoo in England, and grew to become the third-largest in the UK. Jennison's {{original}} idea was that the gardens should be primarily a botanical excursion, but {{it became clear that}} the public was interested in the <b>animals</b> <b>as</b> an attraction in their own right. The initial collection had consisted of domestic birds and a few exotic parrots, but Jennison probably also acquired those animals that could not be sold after the Manchester Zoological Gardens closed in 1842. By 1856, the Jennisons had added kangaroos, rhinos, lions, bears and gazelles.|$|E
5|$|Boyer {{observes the}} {{distinction}} between how nonhuman animals can receive political protection {{as individuals and as}} species. He argues that the latter form of protection is motivated by a desire to preserve human experience of the species rather than the experiences of the nonhuman animals themselves. Politically motivated species advocacy, Boyer argues, is highly anthropocentric, as advocates present these <b>animals</b> <b>as</b> sharing in particular revered virtues; as a result, the likes of habitat and genetic health are the focus of advocates, rather than the nonhuman animals themselves. Using the example of polar bear preservation, Boyer illustrates how species advocacy becomes tied up with broader political goals concerning humans and competing visions of the value of animals. He concludes that the advancement of species advocacy can limit the achievement of animal welfare/rights goals.|$|E
5|$|Connective tissues are fibrous {{and made}} up of cells {{scattered}} among inorganic material called the extracellular matrix. Connective tissue gives shape to organs and holds them in place. The main types are loose connective tissue, adipose tissue, fibrous connective tissue, cartilage and bone. The extracellular matrix contains proteins, the chief and most abundant of which is collagen. Collagen plays a major part in organizing and maintaining tissues. The matrix can be modified to form a skeleton to support or protect the body. An exoskeleton is a thickened, rigid cuticle which is stiffened by mineralization, as in crustaceans or by the cross-linking of its proteins as in insects. An endoskeleton is internal and present in all developed <b>animals,</b> <b>as</b> well as in many of those less developed.|$|E

The editors of a compilation work on the indigenous mammals of the Philippines accepted the <b>animal</b> <b>as</b> a new species in 1998.|$|R
