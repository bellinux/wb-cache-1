5|$|Aldfrith {{was said}} to have been ill for some time before his death, dying on 14 December 704 or 705. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle adds that he died at Driffield in the East Riding of Yorkshire. The {{succession}} was disputed by Eadwulf, supported initially by Bishop Wilfrid, <b>and</b> <b>supporters</b> <b>of</b> Aldfrith's young son Osred, apparently led by Berht's kinsman Berhtfrith.|$|E

5|$|Moran, {{the eldest}} of seven children, was born in Buffalo, New York, {{and grew up in}} Natick, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston. His parents were Dorothy (née Dwyer) and James Moran Sr., a {{professional}} football player for the Boston Redskins in 1935 and 1936; outside of football he worked as a probation officer. Both his father and mother were Roosevelt Democrats <b>and</b> <b>supporters</b> <b>of</b> the New Deal. Moran attended Marian High School in Framingham, Massachusetts.|$|E

The entire Greek army was mobilized (though {{tensions}} remained inside the army between supporters of the Constantine <b>and</b> <b>supporters</b> <b>of</b> Venizelos) and began to participate in military operations against the Central Powers on the Macedonian front.|$|E
5|$|After {{his service}} in the House, Brown took a break from politics, but re-entered the {{political}} arena {{as a candidate for}} governor of Kentucky in 1891. He secured the Democratic nomination in a four-way primary election, then convincingly won the general election over his Republican challenger, Andrew T. Wood. Brown's administration, and the state Democratic Party, were split between gold standard supporters (including Brown) <b>and</b> <b>supporters</b> <b>of</b> the free coinage of silver. Brown's was also the first administration to operate under the Kentucky Constitution of 1891, and most of the legislature's time was spent adapting the state's code of laws to the new constitution. Consequently, little of significance was accomplished during Brown's term.|$|E
5|$|Dissatisfaction {{became more}} evident during the 1880s, and some {{officers}} began to display open insubordination. The Emperor {{and the politicians}} did nothing to improve the military nor meet their demands. The dissemination of Positivist ideology among young officers brought further complications, as Positivism opposed the monarchy under the belief that a dictatorial republic would bring improvements. A coalition between a mutinous Army faction and the Positivist camp was formed and directly led to the republican coup on 15 November 1889. Battalions and even full regiments of soldiers loyal to the Empire, who shared {{the ideals of the}} older generation of leaders, attempted to restore the monarchy. Attempts at a restoration proved futile <b>and</b> <b>supporters</b> <b>of</b> the Empire were executed, arrested or forcibly retired.|$|E

5|$|Mark Antony was {{amassing}} political support, but Octavian {{still had}} opportunity to rival {{him as the}} leading member of the faction supporting Caesar. Mark Antony had lost the support of many Romans <b>and</b> <b>supporters</b> <b>of</b> Caesar when he initially opposed the motion to elevate Caesar to divine status. Octavian failed to persuade Antony to relinquish Caesar's money to him. During the summer, he managed to win support from Caesarian sympathizers, however, who saw the younger heir as the lesser evil and hoped to manipulate him, or to bear with him during their efforts {{to get rid of}} Antony.|$|E
5|$|On January 1, 1994, Clinton {{signed the}} North American Free Trade Agreement into law. Throughout {{his first year}} in office, Clinton {{consistently}} supported ratification of the treaty by the U.S. Senate. Clinton and most of his allies in the Democratic Leadership Committee strongly supported free trade measures; there remained, however, strong disagreement within the party. Opposition came chiefly from anti-trade Republicans, protectionist Democrats <b>and</b> <b>supporters</b> <b>of</b> Ross Perot. The bill passed the house with 234 votes against 200 opposed (132 Republicans and 102 Democrats voting in favor; 156 Democrats, 43 Republicans, and 1 independent against). The treaty was then ratified by the Senate and signed into law by the president.|$|E
5|$|These suggest that, {{after the}} sacking of Jerusalem by AntiochusIV in 168BCE, {{at least part}} of the City of David to the south of the Temple Mount was rebuilt as a {{fortified}} Hellenistic quarter of Jerusalem. More than a citadel, it was a Macedonian colony where Jewish renegades <b>and</b> <b>supporters</b> <b>of</b> the new regime lived. This is also supported by archaeological evidence, including Rhodian amphorae handles and 18 box graves found on the eastern slope of the City of David. The latter are dated to the early 2nd century CE, and are uncharacteristic of Second Temple era Jewish burial practices, yet similar to other known Hellenistic graveyards such as the one in Acre (Ptolemais).|$|E

5|$|Following {{his service}} in the House, Brown resumed his law {{practice}} in Louisville, Kentucky. In 1891, he was {{a candidate for the}} Democratic gubernatorial nomination. The other candidates included Cassius Marcellus Clay, Jr., son of former Congressman Brutus J. Clay and nephew of abolitionist Cassius Marcellus Clay; Dr. John Daniel Clardy, later to be elected a U.S. Representative; and Attorney General Parker Watkins Hardin. The party was split between supporters of corporations, such as the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, <b>and</b> <b>supporters</b> <b>of</b> agrarian interests. Another split was between the more conservative Bourbon Democrats, who supported maintaining the gold standard, and more progressive Democrats, who called for the free coinage of silver. Agrarian voters were about equally split between Clay and Clardy, while Free Silver Democrats were about equally split between Hardin and Clardy. Having lived in the agrarian western part of the state for most of his life, and never having alienated the powerful Farmers' Alliance, Brown was acceptable to most agrarian interests, while the Louisville and Nashville Railroad felt he was a moderate on the issue of corporate regulation. Bourbon Democrats were also pleased with his sound money stand.|$|E
5|$|Las Casas {{has also}} often {{been accused of}} exaggerating the atrocities he {{described}} in the Indies, some scholars holding that the initial population figures given by him were too high, making the population decline look worse than it actually was, and that epidemics of European disease were the prime cause of the population decline, not violence and exploitation. Demographic studies {{such as those of}} colonial Mexico by Sherburne F. Cook in the mid-20th century suggested that the decline {{in the first years of}} the conquest was indeed drastic – ranging between 80 and 90%, due of course to many different causes, but all ultimately traceable to the arrival of the Europeans. The overwhelming main cause was disease introduced by the Europeans. It has also been noted that exaggeration of numbers was the norm in writing in 16th-century accounts, and both contemporary detractors <b>and</b> <b>supporters</b> <b>of</b> Las Casas were guilty of similar exaggerations.|$|E
5|$|The {{monument}} is of ashlar stone masonry, 25feet (7.6m) high, in the English Baroque style. On {{the south}} side is a slate tablet inscribed with a quotation from the account by Lord Clarendon (1609–1674) in his History of the Rebellion and Civil Wars in England of the Battle of Lansdowne (1643). On the north side are two poems. On top is a griffin (the crest <b>and</b> <b>supporters</b> <b>of</b> the Grenvilles) holding an escutcheon displaying the Grenville coat of arms: Gules, three clarions or. On another side are shown the Royal Arms of King Charles II (1660–1685) supported by the arms of Sir Bevil's eldest son and heir John Granville, 1st Earl of Bath (1628–1701) and by {{the arms of the}} latter's half first cousin General George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle, KG (1608–1670). Monck was the principal figure behind the Restoration of the Monarchy to King Charles II in 1660, in effecting which he was much assisted by Sir John Grenville, for which services both were elevated to the peerage.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the many}} {{different}} and unknown radioactive half-lives in the experiment's results showed that several nuclear reactions were occurring, Fermi's group could not prove that element 93 was being created unless they could isolate it chemically. They and many other scientists attempted to accomplish this, including Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner who were among the best radiochemists {{in the world at}} the time <b>and</b> <b>supporters</b> <b>of</b> Fermi's claim, but they all failed. Much later, it was determined that the main reason for this failure was because the predictions of element 93's chemical properties were based on a periodic table which lacked the actinide series. This arrangement placed protactinium below tantalum, uranium below tungsten, and further suggested that element 93, at that point referred to as eka-rhenium, should be similar to the group 7 elements, including manganese and rhenium. Thorium, protactinium, and uranium, with their dominant oxidation states of +4, +5, and +6 respectively, fooled scientists into thinking they belonged below hafnium, tantalum, and tungsten, rather than below the lanthanide series, which was at the time viewed as a fluke, and whose members all have dominant +3 states; neptunium, on the other hand, has a much weaker, more unstable +7 state, with +4 and +5 being the most stable. Upon finding that plutonium and the other transuranic elements also have dominant +3 and +4 states, along with the discovery of the f-block, the actinide series was firmly established.|$|E
