The Condor Legion officially returned to Germany on 6 June 1939 and troops marched through Berlin to the Lustgarten, where the fallen were honoured. A formal state banquet {{for the most}} highly decorated soldiers {{was held in the}} marble gallery of the Reich Chancellery.

5|$|Lax was {{admitted}} as a sizar to Trinity College, Cambridge University on 22 November 1780 {{at the age}} of 19. Trinity was at the time the richest college at Cambridge. Sizars were students who were not of the gentlemanly class, who were charged lower fees and obtained free food and/or lodging and other assistance during their period of study in exchange for performing work at their colleges. By the eighteenth century, sizars were fully integrated members of the community, who were as likely to be employed by Fellow commoners as companions rather than servants. They were expected to wait <b>at</b> <b>table</b> (as were pensioners and scholars), but by the eighteenth century they had their own gyps (servants) and bedmakers.|$|E

5|$|Prince Christian {{was given}} the title Prince of Denmark and his family {{moved into a new}} {{official}} residence, Bernstorff Palace. Although the family's status had risen, there was little or no increase in their income and they did not participate in court life at Copenhagen as they refused to meet Frederick's third wife and former mistress, Louise Rasmussen, because she had an illegitimate child by a previous lover. Alexandra shared a draughty attic bedroom with her sister, Dagmar (later Empress of Russia), made her own clothes and waited <b>at</b> <b>table</b> along with her sisters. Alexandra and Dagmar were given swimming lessons by the Swedish pioneer of women's swimming, Nancy Edberg. At Bernstorff, Alexandra grew into a young woman; she was taught English by the English chaplain at Copenhagen and was confirmed in Christiansborg Palace. She was devout throughout her life, and followed High Church practice.|$|E
5|$|Prisoners in the Agra jail {{were trained}} and kept {{employed}} as carpet weavers {{as part of}} their rehabilitation. In 1886, 34 convicts travelled to London to demonstrate carpet weaving at the Colonial and Indian Exhibition in South Kensington. Karim did not accompany the prisoners, but assisted Jail Superintendent John Tyler in organising the trip, and helped to select the carpets and weavers. When Queen Victoria visited the exhibition, Tyler gave her a gift of two gold bracelets, again chosen with the assistance of Karim. The Queen had a longstanding interest in her Indian territories and wished to employ some Indian servants for her Golden Jubilee. She asked Tyler to recruit two attendants who would be employed for a year. Karim was hastily coached in British manners and in the English language and sent to England, along with Mohammed Buksh. Major-General Thomas Dennehy, who was about to be appointed to the Royal Household, had previously employed Buksh as a servant. It was planned that the two Indian men would initially wait <b>at</b> <b>table,</b> and learn to do other tasks.|$|E

5000|$|In {{probability}} theory, the Chinese restaurant {{process is}} a discrete-time stochastic process, analogous to seating customers <b>at</b> <b>tables</b> in a Chinese restaurant.Imagine a Chinese restaurant with {{an infinite number of}} circular tables, each with infinite capacity. Customer 1 sits <b>at</b> the first <b>table.</b> The next customer either sits <b>at</b> the same <b>table</b> as customer 1, or the next table. This continues, with each customer choosing to sit <b>at</b> an occupied <b>table</b> with a probability proportional to the number of customers already there (i.e., {{they are more likely to}} sit <b>at</b> a <b>table</b> with many customers than few), or an unoccupied <b>table.</b> <b>At</b> time n, the n customers have been partitioned among m &le; n tables (or blocks of the partition). The results of this process are exchangeable, meaning the order in which the customers sit does not affect the probability of the final distribution. This property greatly simplifies a number of problems in population genetics, linguistic analysis, and image recognition.|$|R
