5|$|Some bioluminous {{bacteria}} infect nematodes that parasitize Lepidoptera larvae. When these caterpillars die, their luminosity may attract predators to {{the dead}} insect thus <b>assisting</b> <b>in</b> the dispersal of both bacteria and nematodes.

Species in the genera Armillaria, Mycena, Omphalotus, Panellus, Pleurotus and others do this, emitting usually greenish light from the mycelium, cap and gills. This may attract night-flying insects and aid in spore dispersal, but other functions may also be involved.|$|E
