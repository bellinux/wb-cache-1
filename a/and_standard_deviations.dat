50|$|Stevens (1946) argued that, {{because the}} {{assumption}} of equal distance between categories does not hold for ordinal data, the use of means <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> for description of ordinal distributions and of inferential statistics based on means <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> was not appropriate. Instead, positional measures like the median and percentiles, in addition to descriptive statistics appropriate for nominal data (number of cases, mode, contingency correlation), should be used. Nonparametric methods have been proposed as the most appropriate procedures for inferential statistics involving ordinal data, especially those developed {{for the analysis of}} ranked measurements. However, use of parametric statistics for ordinal data may be permissible with certain caveats {{to take advantage of the}} greater range of available statistical procedures.|$|E
