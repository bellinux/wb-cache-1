40|$|The first {{intention}} {{of this research}} is to identify specific CO 2 -philic solids from two candidates, namely sugar acetates and tert-butylated aromatics, which can be used to separate high pressure CO 2 from H 2. In this work, many of these solids were found to melt in the presence of high pressure CO 2 (600 ¨C 1000 psi) and absorb large amounts of CO 2. It was hoped that upon exposure to a 1 : 1 CO 2 /H 2 high pressure gas mixture that was selected to be representative of a shifted gasifier effluent stream, the solid would melt and selectively absorb CO 2. Only one candidate, glucose pentaacetate, was found to melt {{in the presence of the}} gas mixture at 25 oC. The pressure of the system was ~ 6000 psia, which is unrealistically high for the commercial application of this process. Therefore mixed gas solubilities in the molten phase were not determined. In a second project, a strategy for using CO 2 -soluble compounds to decrease the mobility of dense CO 2 in porous media was investigated. It is to inject a CO 2 surfactant solution into the porous media, which contains both brine and oil, thereby generating a low mobility emulsion or foam of CO 2 droplets separated by surfactant-stabilized brine lamellae that bridge pore throats. In this work, the surfactants were screened by assessing their ability to stabilize foams when equal volumes of CO 2 and brine were mixed with the amount of surfactant capable of dissolving in the CO 2 at test conditions (e. g. 25 oC and 1300 psia). Stability was assessed by monitoring the rate of collapse of the foam and the appearance of clear zones of excess water and CO 2. We have established the identity of several non-ionic, hydrocarbon-based, commercially available, inexpensive surfactants that can dissolve in CO 2 at typical EOR reservoirs conditions to a high enough concentration (~ 0. 02 - 0. 20 wt%) to form relatively stable emulsions/foams of liquid or supercritical CO 2 droplets separated by films of brine. Although these surfactants are CO 2 -soluble, they are even more water-soluble, therefore they tend to partition into the low-volume brine phase and stabilize the emulsion form emulsions in which the brine is the low-volume (e. g. 10 vol%) continuous phase, in accordance with Bancroft¡¯s rule. The most effective thickeners were branched <b>alkyl</b> <b>phenol</b> <b>ethoxylates,</b> linear <b>alkyl</b> <b>phenol</b> <b>ethoxylates,</b> and linear <b>alkyl</b> ethoxylates.

40|$|AbstractThe {{possible}} {{contamination of}} the environment by surfactants arising from the widespread use of detergent formulations has been reviewed. Two of the major surfactants in current use are the linear alkylbenzene sulphonates (LAS) and the <b>alkyl</b> <b>phenol</b> <b>ethoxylates</b> (APE). These pass into the sewage treatment plants where they are partially aerobically degraded and partially adsorbed to sewage sludge that is applied to land. The biodegradation of these and a range of other surfactants both in wastewater treatment plants and after discharge into natural waters and application to land resulting in sewage sludge amended soils has been considered. Although the application of sewage sludge to soil can result in surfactant levels generally in a range 0 to 3 mg kg− 1, in the aerobic soil environment a surfactant can undergo further degradation so that the risk to the biota in soil is very small, with margins of safety that are often at least 100. In the case of APE, while the surfactants themselves show little toxicity their breakdown products, principally nonyl and octyl phenols adsorb readily to suspended solids and are known to exhibit oestrogen-like properties, possibly linked to a decreasing male sperm count and carcinogenic effects. While there is little serious risk to the environment from commonly used anionic surfactants, cationic surfactants are known to be much more toxic and at present {{there is a lack of}} data on the degradation of cationics and their fate in the environment...|$|R
40|$|Introduction 4 -Nonylphenol (4 -NP) is an {{environmental}} contaminant originating from {{the degradation of}} <b>alkyl</b> <b>phenol</b> <b>ethoxylates,</b> which are common surfactants employed in many industrial applications. This chemically stable molecule is widely diffused and, due to its hydrophobic feature, it can easily accumulate into living organisms, including humans, where it can reach concentrations up to 1000 -fold higher than {{those found in the}} environment [1]. 4 -NP is recognized as a common endocrine-disrupter [2], causing alteration of the reproductive biology and development abnormalities in many species [3, 4]. However, the molecular mechanisms of other 4 -NP multiple negative effects have not been fully explored. Therefore, we applied a computational approach in order to find possible unknown protein targets to which 4 -NP can bind, exerting a toxic effect in the human organism. Methods We applied a reverse docking approach using the Web server idTarget ([URL] [5] in order to identify possible targets for the binding of 4 -NP among those proteins whose structure is deposited in PDB database. The binding of 4 -NP to proteins selected among those identified in the previous step was studied with a direct docking approach using AutoDock 4. 2 [6]. Results Among the first 100 results obtained by idTarget with the lower predicted G, we selected for further analyses those human proteins, or proteins homologous of human proteins with known structures, with a predicted energy lower than - 7. 00 kcal/mol. In addition, further 8 proteins with a negative Z-score but with a higher energy, were taken into account. Among these selected targets, the estrogen receptor was present as expected, but a striking abundance of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) was also found, with 5 proteins of these families among the first 30, and other 3 targets {{in the rest of the}} list. In addition, another putative target found for 4 -NP binding is fatty acid binding protein (FABP). The binding of 4 -NP to these proteins was simulated with a direct docking approach, and it was found that this pollutant can bind to these pro- teins with relatively high affinity. This interaction can be involved in other toxic effects of this molecule, since these proteins are involved in inflammatory processes and migration of leucocytes, and their alteration can play a role e. g. in tumor diffusion. Moreover, the binding of 4 -NP to FABP can explain its accumulation in lipids and the risk of hepatic steatosis in people exposed to this pollutant. Further studies investigating the involvement of these proteins in metabolic and pathogenic pathways will clarify the role of these putative targets in contributing to 4 -NP toxic effects.

The extract of Labisia pumila showed a significant time dependent inhibition (TDI) of CYP 3 A 4, reversible inhibition of CYP 2 C 9 and 2 C 19 and a weak inhibition of 1 A 2 and 2 D 6 as well as an inhibition of P-gp and rifampicin-induced PXR activation. The <b>alkyl</b> <b>phenols</b> inhibited CYP 3 A 4 (TDI), CYP 2 C 9 and 2 C 19 (reversible) while saponins inhibited P-gp and PXR. In conclusion, Labisia pumila and its constituents showed significant modulation of all three regulatory proteins (CYPs, P-gp and PXR) suggesting a potential to alter the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of conventional drugs if used concomitantly...|$|R

Mass transport phenomena determining the yield of the flotation process were interpreted using model equations describing particle removal in terms of flotation, entrainment, and drainage in the froth. A decrease in the ink and mineral fillers flotation rate constant, drainage through the froth, and in fibre entrainment was observed when increasing the surfactant concentration. These trends {{were consistent with the}} typical dispersing action of the studied nonionic surfactant. An opposite effect on ink and fillers was observed when using calcium soap alone, and the increase in the flotation rate constant and drainage through the froth were consistent with the collecting and defoaming action of the calcium soap. Moreover, fibre entrainment decreased when increasing the soap concentration. The study of the surfactant/soap mixture highlighted the absence of synergy between the calcium soap and the surfactant...|$|R

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Instıtute of Science and Technology, 2015 Biyokimyasal olarak zor ayrışan, arıtmaya karşı dirençli, toksik ve/veya mutajenik etkileri olan bazı endüstriyel kirleticilerin su kaynaklarımızdaki varlığı ekosistemleri tehdit etmektedir. Endokrin bozucu özellikleri olduğu bilinen ve noniyonik yüzey aktif maddelerin bileşiminde bulunan alkil fenol polietoksilat metabolitlerinin konvansiyonel fiziksel, biyolojik ve kimyasal arıtma yöntemleri ile giderimleri yetersiz kalmaktadır. Bu nedenle alkil fenol polietoksilatların ve alkil fenollerin ileri oksidasyon prosesleri gibi ileri arıtma yöntemleri ile giderim çalışmaları ve uygulamaları son yıllarda önem kazanmıştır. İleri oksidasyon prosesleri arasında hızları ve yüksek giderim verimleri nedeniyle Fenton, Fenton-benzeri ve Foto-Fenton proseslerinin atıksu ve su arıtımında sorunlu kirleticilerin oksidasyonu için tercih edilmektedir. Son yıllarda ekonomik, kolay uygulanabilir ve etkin olması nedeniyle hidrojen peroksit ve persülfat gibi oksidanlarla aktive edilebilen sıfır değerlikli demir ile arıtma prosesleri dikkat çekmektedir.   Yukarıdaki bilgiler ışığında bu tez kapsamında, bir oktil fenol polietoksilat bileşiği olan noniyonik bir yüzey aktif maddenin (ticari ismi: Triton X- 45), persülfat (S 2 O 82 -) iyonları ile aktive edilmiş sıfır değerlikli demir kullanılarak arıtımı incelenmiştir. Yüzey aktif maddenin Persülfat/Sıfır değerlikli demir ileri oksidasyon sistemi ile arıtılabilirliği üç aşamada çalışılmıştır. Birinci aşamada, prosesi etkileyen parametrelerin (katalizör konsantrayonu, oksidan konsantrasyonu, pH, arıtma süresi) oksidasyon verimi üzerindeki etkileri araştırılmış, yüzey aktif madde (20 mg/L sulu çözelti) ve TOK giderimi bazında {{optimize}} edilmiştir. En uygun pH değeri 5, optimum persülfat konsantrasyonu 2. 5 mM, optimum katalizör konsantrasyonu 1 g/L, optimum arıtma süresi 60 dk. olarak belirlenmiştir. Çalışmanın ikinci aşamasında arıtma sisteminin ekotoksikolojik etkilerini incelemek üzere seçilen deneysel koşullarda arıtılmış numunelerde akut toksisite testleri gerçekleştirilmiştir. Toksisite biyodeneylerinde test organizmaları olarak Vibrio fischeri fotobakterileri ve bir tatlısu mikroalgi olan Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata kullanılmıştır. Yapılan deneysel çalışmalar neticesinde, belirlenen en uygun arıtma koşullarında OPEO’ nun % 95 TOK’un ise % 40 oranında giderimi sağlanmıştır. Vibrio fischeri ve Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata ile yürütülen akut toksisite deneyleri ile 120 dakikalık reaksiyon süresi sonucunda % bağıl toksisite değerleri Vibrio fischeri için % 66 ’dan % 20 ’ye düşürülmüş, Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata için ise % 16 olan bağıl toksisite tamamen giderilmiştir. Surfactants are {{organic chemicals}} that reduce surface tension {{in water and}} other liquids. The most familiar use for surfactants are soaps, laundry detergents, dishwashing liquids and shampoos. They are {{a diverse group of}} chemicals with unique cleaning and/or solubilisation properties. They usually consist of a polar (hydrophilic) and a nonpolar (hydrophobic) group. Due to their amphiphilic nature they are widely used in household cleaning agents (detergents), personal care products, textiles, paints, inks, polymers, pesticide formulations, pharmaceuticals, mining, oil recovery as well as pulp and paper industries. Surfactants enter the environment mainly through the discharge of sewage effluents into natural water and the application sewage sludge on land for soil fertilizing purposes. Most of the commercial surfactants used today by different industries are only partially and slowly biodegradable; they tend to sorb and accumulate on sludge and soil  sediments. causing a potential ecotoxicological and pollution risk in the environment. Moreover, the metabolites of some <b>alkyl</b> <b>phenol</b> <b>ethoxylates</b> have recently been declared as hormone mimicking/endocrine disrupting compounds. Therefore, the efficient management and treatment of surfactants remains a serious challenge. In this respect, more effective {{and at the same time}} economically feasible abatement processes have to be developed to alleviate the problem of surfactants/surfactant metabolites in the environment. Alkylphenol polyethoxylates are industrial compounds belonging to the class of nonionic surfactants that are designed to have both hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties. Among them, octylphenol polyethoxylates have been widely used in cleaning products, paints, ink dispersants, textile preparation and leather processing, manufacture of pulp and paper, metalworking, cosmetics and personal care products. However, many of these applications are now restricted by the European Commission due to the raising concerns regarding the environmental safety of alkylphenol (poly) ethoxylates and its metabolites. It has been reported that their aerobic / anaerobic transformation products (alkylphenols such as nonylphenol and octylphenol) are much more inhibitory and estrogenic than the original surfactants. Despite the above-mentioned concerns regarding the use of alkylphenol (poly) ethoxylates, these products still appear in several industrial applications where they cannot not be replaced by alternative chemicals due to technical and economic reasons. Consequently, the presence of these nonionic surfactants and their degradation products have been reported in water bodies, sediments and sludge associated with the continuing discharges from industrial and sewage treatment plants.   The scientific literature on the biodergadability and fate of alkylphenol polyethoxylates in the aquatic as well as terrestrial environment reinforces the idea that more efficient, alternative treatment processes are needed for their effective elimination. Besides conventional biochemical, chemical and physical treatment methods, chemical oxidation (ozonation, advanced oxidation) has been extensively studied as an alternative for the treatment of nonionic surfactants and their metabolites. Among the existing hydroxyl radicals (HO•) -induced advanced oxidation processes, TiO 2 /UV, H 2 O 2 /UV, O 3 /UV, H 2 O 2 /UV, Fenton and Photo-Fenton processes have attracted considerable interest since these exhibit relatively high treatment efficiencies and kinetics. More recently, sulfate radicals (SO 4 •-) -driven advanced oxidation processes have been investigated to treat pollutants found in water and wastewater. The reduction potential of SO 4 •- is lower than that of HO• (2. 6 versus 2. 9 eV); however, SO 4 •- are also capable of non-selectively and rapidly reacting with pollutants in a series of free radical chain reactions being similar to those established for HO•-based advanced oxidation processes. SO 4 •- can be produced from persulfate ions via chemical, radiolytic, thermal or photochemical activation; or alternatively by redox reactions with transition metals as in the case of the Fenton’s reagent. An alternative to iron-based (Fenton-like) advanced oxidation processes are zero valent iron (ZVI; Fe 0) catalyzed treatment systems. They have received global interest and promising results have been reported so far for the removal of chlorinated organics, nitroaromatic compounds, arsenic, heavy metals, nitrate, industrial dyes and phenols by micro-and nanoscale ZVI. ZVI is reactive (redox potential = - 0. 44 eV), non-toxic, abundant, cheap, relatively easy to produce and its treatment applications require little maintenance. ZVI is capable of oxidizing organic as well as inorganic pollutants by an electron transfer mechanism. However, for harsher conditions, ZVI treatment has to be enhanced chemical or thermally by the involvement of oxidants (for example, hydrogen peroxide or persulfate). Besides, the extensive follow-up of toxicity is critical to ensure economically and ecologically safe applications of advanced oxidation processes. The ecotoxicological characterization of sulfate radical-based treatment systems during their application to treat industrial pollutants is an untouched area in this research field. For this purpose, bioassays employing the marine photobacterium Vibrio fischeri remain the most popular test protocols since these enable easy and rapid measurement of cytotoxicity in water and wastewater samples being subjected to advanced oxidation. Although V. fischeri is very sensitive and hence useful for obtaining a preliminary idea about the inhibitory effect of pollutants and their degradation products, it is more appropriate to support toxicity results with other types of test organisms preferably from different trophic levels. For example, Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata are important freshwater microalage being routinely used as primary producers ito assess the acute and chronic toxicity of surfactants.   Considering the above facts, the motivation of the present work was to study the treatability and acute toxicity of the commercially important nonionic surfactant octylphenol polyethoxylate (known as “Triton X- 45 ”) in aqueous solution with the ZVI/S 2 O 82 - advanced oxidation system. To our knowledge, this was the first study investigating the treatability of a nonionic surfactant with persulfate activated ZVI nanoparticles. Within the scope of this experimental study, firstly, preliminary optimization tests were performed under varying reaction conditions (ZVI and persulfate concentrations, pH’s and treatment time) together with control runs (ZVI only and persulfte only expeirments). Thereafter, time dependent changes in the surfactant, TOC, persulfate concentrations and pH were followed for the optimized treatment system. Then, the acute toxicity of the nonionic surfactant and its degradation products was also followed by employing two different bioassays with V. fischeri and P. subcapitata. It can be said that, OPEO has corrosive and toxic effects on people and other organisms. Results indicated that the nonionic surfactant solution (20 mg/L original concentration) could be degraded in less than 1 hour (40 - 60) by 95 % accompanied with up to 40 % TOC removal by 1 g/L ZVI nanoparticles activated with 2. 5 mM (480 mg/L) persulfate at an initial reaction pH of 5. 0. The acute toxicities (percent relative inhibition rates) decreased significantly from originally 66 % to 21 % and originally 16 % to non-toxic for V. fischeri and P. subcapitata, respectively. The photobacterium V. fischeri appeared to be more sensitive to octylphenol polyethoxylate and its degradation products than the microalgae P. subcapitata. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|R
40|$|Enhancing the {{precipitation}} of Al(OH) (3) from supersaturated {{sodium aluminate}} solution has been a challenge for the alumina industry for decades {{in its effort to}} increase the productivity. However, limited by the thermodynamic equilibrium of alumina solubility in caustic solutions, the processes that are available to date for promoting {{the precipitation of}} Al(OH) (3) are unsatisfactory. An acid-base reactive solvent extraction method is proposed to enhance the separation of sodium hydroxide from sodium aluminate mother liquor by creating a condition for re-precipitation. The extraction process has been reported in Part I of this study by the present authors. In this paper the effects of diluents on sodium extraction when using 2 -tert-butyl- 4 -methylphenol as the main organic extractant were systematically investigated. According to the classification of diluents, the capabilities for extracting sodium in different types of diluents were compared, and the protonic polar diluents were identified as being the most effective diluent. In the absence of <b>alkyl</b> <b>phenol</b> organic extractant, the sodium extraction equilibrium in 1 -octanol and 2 -ethyl hexanol, and the co-extraction of water in each of them were compared. In the presence of <b>alkyl</b> <b>phenol,</b> the extraction capabilities for sodium in different C 8 alcohols, including 1 -octanol, 2 -ethyl hexanol and 2 -octanol, were compared and analyzed. The results showed that 1 -octanol is the most effective diluent among the three that are studied in this project. Furthermore, inert diluents including kerosene, octane and heptane, were used to dilute the pure 1 -octanol solvent in different proportions in order to decrease the viscosity of the organic phase. The effects of the inert diluent on sodium extraction and water co-extraction were studied. Finally, the particle size distributions in the equilibrated organic phases and the Margules ternary 2 -suffix equations were introduced to discuss the mechanisms of sodium extraction by 1 -octanol and 2 -ethyl hexanol. The results of this systematic research are expected to provide valuable guidance for the selection of diluents. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. </p...|$|R
