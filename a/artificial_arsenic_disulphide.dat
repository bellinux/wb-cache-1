30|$|This study {{investigated}} the use of arsenic sulfide pigments in late Edo period Japanese woodblock prints {{with the goal of}} better understanding when <b>artificial</b> <b>arsenic</b> sulfide pigments were first produced and used in Japan. First, we used a multi-analytical approach to identify both natural orpiment and <b>artificial</b> <b>arsenic</b> sulfide in prints from the Waterfalls series by Katsushika Hokusai. We then examined historic sources to understand <b>artificial</b> <b>arsenic</b> sulfide pigments production in Asia during the nineteenth century. Based on our experimental findings and historic literary references, we propose that the orpiment used in the prints studied was sourced from China and the <b>artificial</b> <b>arsenic</b> sulfide was produced by the dry process method. The finding of natural orpiment in the prints belonging to the first edition printing and both <b>artificial</b> <b>arsenic</b> sulfide and ultramarine in the reproduction set aided in corroborating the production dates of the prints studied, where the colorants detected agreed well with a printing date of 1833 – 1835 for set A, and in the very late Edo period or early Meiji period in the case of Set B.|$|R
30|$|Visual {{observation}} cannot accurately {{distinguish between}} natural and <b>artificial</b> <b>arsenic</b> sulfides. Polarized light microscopy (PLM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman microspectroscopy {{have been used}} to differentiate various classes of dry process <b>artificial</b> <b>arsenic</b> sulfides [2, 6, 7]. Recent work by Vermeulen et al. used PLM, Raman and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectrometry (SEM–EDS) to identify an <b>artificial</b> <b>arsenic</b> sulfide pigment in nineteenth century painted decorative panels in the Japanese tower in Laeken, Belgium [8]. The minimally invasive nature and high chemical sensitivity of analytical techniques such as XRF, Raman, and SEM–EDS makes them highly suitable as well for characterization of arsenic sulfide pigments in woodblock prints.|$|R
30|$|Large mineral {{deposits}} of orpiment and realgar {{can be found}} in Asia (particularly in Southeastern China), making natural arsenic sulfides a common painting material in Chinese art starting in the fifth and sixth centuries [1, 9 – 12]. Despite the longstanding use of orpiment in Chinese painting, orpiment does not appear in Japanese paintings before the mid-seventeenth century, becoming more common by the nineteenth century [13, 14]. Previously published studies discuss a shift in the usage of natural to <b>artificial</b> <b>arsenic</b> sulfides as a yellow pigment during the late Edo period, but do not define an exact time period of this shift [15, 16]. Recent work from Luo et al. demonstrates the exclusive use of <b>artificial</b> <b>arsenic</b> sulfide as a yellow pigment for Japanese woodblock prints dated between 1864 and 1895 [17]. The authors cite the earliest known reference to <b>artificial</b> <b>arsenic</b> sulfide production in Japan, dating to 1846, where Takamatsu describes heating arsenical ore with sulfur to produce a yellow pigment [18]. Prior to 1846, the source and production of <b>artificial</b> <b>arsenic</b> sulfide pigments and their use in Japanese woodblock prints has not been well studied.|$|R
30|$|The prints {{analyzed}} {{in this study}} can be split into two subsets: those that use natural orpiment as a yellow pigment (Set A) and those that use <b>artificial</b> <b>arsenic</b> sulfide (Set B). The prints with brighter green and yellow tones in Set A used natural orpiment in the yellow and green areas of the print. The yellow pigment found in these prints exhibited the characteristic Raman spectrum of orpiment (Fig.  1), and SEM images showed flat plate-like particles between 1 and 30  μm in size, also typical of natural orpiment. In contrast, the prints with relatively duller yellow and green tones in Set B were found to use <b>artificial</b> <b>arsenic</b> sulfide, {{as indicated by the}} homogeneous 1 – 3  μm diameter spherical pigment particles, the broader Raman peaks, and the excess in sulfur detected by SEM–EDS. The Raman and SEM–EDS data of the <b>artificial</b> <b>arsenic</b> sulfide identified in the prints agrees well with previous reports of dry-process artificial orpiment [1, 2, 8, 18]. A notable exception to the distinctive use of natural orpiment in Set A and <b>artificial</b> <b>arsenic</b> sulfide in Set B was print JP 1082 (Set B). In this print, in addition to <b>artificial</b> <b>arsenic</b> sulfide in the yellow and green areas, we found natural orpiment, limited to the orange areas of the print and mixed with iron oxide red (as identified by XRF and Raman). Thus, natural orpiment was mixed with a red pigment with the intent of obtaining a bright orange tone. This finding implies that natural orpiment was available alongside the artificial sulfide at the time the prints in Set B were published.|$|R
30|$|For {{prints in}} Set B, all blue areas, {{including}} the outlines {{were found to}} contain a mixture of Prussian blue, indigo, and ultramarine blue. For greens, the three blue pigments are found together with <b>artificial</b> <b>arsenic</b> sulfide.|$|R
2500|$|The first {{confirmed}} {{reference to}} {{what can be}} considered gunpowder in China occurred {{more than three hundred}} years later during the Tang dynasty, first in a formula contained in the Taishang Shengzu Jindan Mijue (太上聖祖金丹秘訣) in 808, and then about half a century later in a Taoist text known as the Zhenyuan miaodao yaolüe (真元妙道要略). The first formula was a combination of six parts sulfur to six parts saltpeter to one part birthwort herb, and the Taoist text warned against an assortment of dangerous formulas, one of which corresponds with gunpowder: [...] "Some have heated together sulfur, realgar (<b>arsenic</b> <b>disulphide),</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|Needham and Lu's first {{explanation}} is that many alchemical mineral preparations were capable of giving an [...] "initial exhilaration" [...] or transient sense of well-being, usually involving weight loss and increased libido. These preliminary tonic effects could have acted {{as a kind of}} [...] "bait" [...] inveigling an elixir-taker deeper into substance intoxication, {{even to the point of}} death (1974: 282). Chinese medical texts recorded that realgar (<b>arsenic</b> <b>disulphide)</b> and orpiment (<b>arsenic</b> trisulphide) were aphrodisiacs and stimulated fertility, while cinnabar and sulphur elixirs increased longevity, averted hunger, and [...] "lightened the body" [...] (namely, qīngshēn 輕身, which is a common description of elixir effects) (1974: 285).|$|R
30|$|A multi-technique {{analytical}} approach, including XRF, Raman, and SEM–EDS analysis, {{was used}} to characterize the arsenic sulfide pigments used in the prints. Our study showed that natural orpiment was used in Set A and the artificial pigment (with one notable occurrence of natural orpiment) in Set B. Additionally, a characteristic distribution for the co-occurrence of specific blue pigments with natural orpiment or the <b>artificial</b> <b>arsenic</b> sulfide to obtain a green color was seen for each print set. Prints in Set A consistently feature Prussian blue and indigo mixed with natural orpiment whereas in prints from Set B <b>artificial</b> <b>arsenic</b> sulfide is mixed with Prussian blue, indigo, and ultramarine blue for the green. Our experimental results, along with historic documentation describing the production and sources of arsenic pigments, provide further understanding of arsenic sulfide pigments use in Japanese woodblock printing during the late Edo period.|$|R
30|$|Only {{hypotheses}} can be formulated at {{this stage}} of the study. As mentioned by Grundmann and Richter [17], the <b>artificial</b> <b>arsenic</b> sulfide glass might have been introduced in order to replace the very light sensitive natural pigment. In that regard, the glassy nature of the studied pigment could be the origin of its unusual stability. Another factor determining the stability of a pigment can be its use in a lacquer-containing layer in which the pigment is embedded. The lacquer-containing binder might also protect the pigment from oxidation and light due to its high stability.|$|R
30|$|We {{recently}} {{described the}} use of an <b>artificial</b> <b>arsenic</b> sulfide pigment in Japanese woodblock prints from the Meiji period (1868 – 1912): we now expand on our previous work by investigating arsenic sulfide pigments used in Japanese woodblock prints of the late Edo period (1615 – 1868) and early Meiji period. The series of eight prints A Tour of the Waterfalls in Various Provinces (Shokoku Taki Meguri), by Katsushika Hokusai, issued between 1833 and 1834 is known to have been reproduced from entirely new blocks {{at some point during the}} late Edo or early Meiji periods. The two sets, original and copies are characterized by visually distinct color palettes as well as several differences in the image. Two such sets in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art were analyzed with particular attention to the yellow, orange, and green printed areas. X-ray fluorescence spectrometry, Raman microspectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy–energy dispersive spectroscopy revealed {{the use of}} natural orpiment in the original set and of <b>artificial</b> <b>arsenic</b> sulfide pigments in the reproduction set. In addition, the reproduction set features extensive use of ultramarine blue, the synthetic equivalent to lapis lazuli. This pigment, available commercially in Europe from 1830 onward has been documented in Japanese art so far only in a handful of late Edo period paintings. The results of our comparative analysis further highlight differences in pigment use between Edo and Meiji periods, and point to arsenic sulfide pigments as useful markers for the date of original production for popular prints of the Edo period.|$|R
30|$|Assigning {{accurate}} chronology to woodblock prints {{such as the}} Waterfalls {{series is}} challenging due to the commercial nature of print production. Woodblocks could be passed between publishers, and hundreds to thousands of print copies could be produced in a single printing. Additionally, the Waterfalls series prints {{were known to be}} heavily copied in the nineteenth century from a newly carved set of blocks; it is believed that more copies exist in public collections than originals [21, 33, 34]. We attempt to use the identification of both yellow and blue pigments in order to corroborate the production date of the prints studied. Multiple sources state that the Waterfalls series prints were first issued in 1833, and widely published in 1834 – 1835 [33, 35, 36]. The prints that use <b>artificial</b> <b>arsenic</b> sulfide (Set B) also used blue pigments Prussian blue, indigo, and ultramarine. This is unlike the prints with natural orpiment (Set A), which were found to use only Prussian blue and indigo, and highly unusual. Natural ultramarine, or lapis lazuli, was not native to Japan and was extremely costly; it is therefore unlikely that natural ultramarine was used for commercial woodblock prints. Artificial ultramarine, first synthesized in 1828 (independently by Gmelin in Germany and Guimet in France), became commercially available in Europe on large scale only after 1830 [37]. Taken together with the tentative dating to the late Edo—early Meiji period for Set B, and with the co-occurrence of <b>artificial</b> <b>arsenic</b> sulfide pigment, so far only found in Meiji prints, the finding of artificial ultramarine in JP 1081 –JP 1088, is in line with the findings of Fitzhugh [14], who in her survey of Edo period paintings at the Freer Gallery identified artificial ultramarine only in later Edo period paintings by Hiroshige (1797 – 1858) and Hiroshige II (1826 – 1869).|$|R
40|$|A general {{re-examination}} of the <b>artificial</b> <b>arsenic</b> sulphide pigments orpiment, realgar and alacranite using {{polarised light}} microscopy (PLM), {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM) combined with energy and wavelength dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX, WDX) and X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) revealed the following results: wet-process precipitation products of artificial orpiment consist of golden yellow, amorphous, spherical particles ranging from 0. 2 to 2 μm Ø. Dry-process roasting and/or sublimation products with an arsenolite/sulphur mixture consist mainly of amorphous golden yellow oval drops and spherules of amorphous arsenic sulphide glass (g-AsxSx) with a smooth surface ranging from 1 to 20 μm Ø in association with arsenolite crystal aggregates {{and members of the}} alacranite solid solution series (As 8 S 8) –(As 8 S 9). A bright lemon yellow to orange-red arsenic sulphide pigment on a sixteenth/seventeenth-century South German polychrome recumbent sculpture and a seventeenth-century Dutch painting attributed to Rembrandt's studio has been identified as an artificial orpiment produced with dry-process (roasting/sublimation) methods. The recumbent figure contains (i) yellow, orange or red-brown amorphous splintery fragments and spherules of arsenic sulphide glass of up to 25 μm Ø, (ii) yellow, brown or red-brown crystalline spherules and splintery fragments of alacranite, (iii) lemon yellow to red-brown agglomerates of arsenic sulphide glass, and (iv) colourless irregular fragments or octahedral crystals of arsenolite. This type can be classified as 'complex <b>artificial</b> orpiment'. The <b>arsenic</b> sulphide pigment in the yellowish paint layers of the Rembrandt studio painting proved to be very uniform bright yellow spherules (max. 9 μm Ø) of arsenic sulphide glass, which can be classified as 'purified artificial orpiment glass'. A deep red historic arsenic sulphide cake from the collection of the Landesmuseum Joanneum (Graz, Austria) called 'Realgar' {{turned out to be an}} amorphous arsenic sulphide glass matrix (approx. g-As 2 S 3) filled with numerous red crystal aggregates of alacranite (approx. As 8 S 9) in the form of spherules, which fill gas bubbles and pores with an average 3 μm Ø (max. 20 μm Ø). A very fine-grained light red arsenic sulphide powder called 'Realgar' from an archaeological excavation of a historic arsenic smelter near Strassegg (Steiermark, Austria) turned out to be a member of the alacranite solid solution series (As 8 S 8) –(As 8 S 9) in the form of idiomorphic crystals and complex twinned crystal aggregates (average 10 μm Ø, max. 30 μm Ø). All red-colored crystals or crystal aggregates of <b>artificial</b> <b>arsenic</b> sulphides that have been called 'realgar' in the past are in fact members of the alacranite solid solution series. The occurrence of pararealgar as a secondary photochemical reaction product is not exclusively linked with realgar, but can also form on members of the alacranite solid solution series (As 8 S 8) –(As 8 S 9) ...|$|R
30|$|FitzHugh {{described}} the amorphous synthetic arsenic sulfide particles prepared through wet chemistry from thioacetamide solution round in morphology with a particle size of about 1  μm [13]. Grundmann and Rötter differentiated the extremely homogeneous, fine (1 – 2  μm in diameter) bright yellow particles when {{obtained from a}} thioacetamide solution described by FitzHugh from the even smaller (0.1 - 0.4  μm) particles obtained when prepared from hydrogen sulfide [3]. On the other hand, synthetic arsenic sulfide pigment produced by the dry process is described as being likely to be composed of fine to medium particles [19] with an average size of 4  μm depending on the grinding [21]. The dry processes give rise to glassy arsenic sulfide cakes (Figure  4 b) that contain irregularly shaped and sized particles with conchoidal fractures after grinding {{as described in the}} literature [3, 19] and as observed in the cross-sections of the laboratory-made g-AsxSx (Figure  4 c). Because the pigment investigated in the frame of this study is an <b>artificial</b> <b>arsenic</b> sulfide pigment, the size, and shape of the particles observed in Figure  3 tend to indicate a pigment obtained from a dry rather than from a wet process.|$|R
30|$|In {{characterization}} {{studies of}} arsenic sulfide pigments, {{there is a}} high probability that conclusions regarding the exact nature of the compounds present are drawn prematurely. In many cases, the encountered arsenic sulfide is recognized as being a mineral orpiment while in reality it appears to be pararealgar - the yellow degradation phase of realgar - while in others, distinction between natural and artificial orpiment is not made. Contradictions about the exact nature of arsenic sulfide pigments can also be found in published scientific literature or pigment encyclopedias, sometimes confusing realgar with an arsenic sulfide glass of unknown composition [1]. So-called artificial orpiment can be produced using two different processes, wet and dry, using different starting materials [2, 3]. In any case, arsenic sulfide pigments are the result but the structure and properties of the reaction products can be different. To understand its composition and characteristics, a multi-technique approach is required. Each used technique, from SEM-EDX to Raman spectroscopy and polarized light microscopy, can increase the knowledge about the processes behind <b>artificial</b> <b>arsenic</b> sulfide. Although the use of such a pigment in a 20 th-century artifact seems rather uncommon, its good conservation state is even more striking when one considers how instable this material is over time.|$|R
30|$|Arsenic sulfides, {{ranging from}} bright yellow to orange in color, {{have been used}} as {{pigments}} since antiquity [1, 2]. The two arsenic sulfides most commonly identified in works of art are orpiment (As 2 S 3) and realgar (α-AsS or As 4 S 4), a yellow and an orange/red pigment, respectively. Orpiment in particular was highly desirable as a pigment because of its bright, warm, yellow color, mimicking that of gold. Despite its striking visual appearance, the micaceous, flaky character of orpiment makes it challenging to grind for use as a pigment. The first reference in Western Europe to orpiment as an artificially produced pigment is given by Cennino Cennini, and the production process was first described in fifteenth century manuscripts [3 – 5]. Artificial orpiment was obtained by the dry process method, whereby natural orpiment was heated and recrystallized by sublimation, with or without the addition of sulfur. Arsenical ore and sulfur could also be used as starting materials. Artificial orpiment could also be synthesized by reacting H 2 S gas with a hydrochloric acid solution of As 2 O 3 and collecting the resultant yellow precipitate: this preparation is known as the wet process method [1, 2]. Dry process artificial orpiment is typically characterized by smaller and more regular particle size compared to the natural mineral, {{as well as by the}} presence of colorless As 2 O 3 particles. The wet process results in round and regular particles of finer size than the dry process, rarely used as a pigment [1, 2]. Grundmann and coworkers suggest classifying artificial orpiment obtained from heating as orpiment glass (g-As 2 S 3) and any sublimation products as arsenic sulfide glass (g-AsxSx) [6]. For ease of discussion, this work will refer to any dry process orpiment as <b>artificial</b> <b>arsenic</b> sulfide, unless when citing historical sources explicitly using the name artificial orpiment.|$|R
