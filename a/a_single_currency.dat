5|$|Milošević's {{trial at}} the ICTY {{revealed}} numerous declassified documents of Belgrade's {{involvement in the}} wars in Croatia and Bosnia. Evidence introduced at trial showed exactly how Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia financed the war, that they provided weapons and material support to Bosnian and Croatian Serbs, and demonstrated the administrative and personnel structures set up to support the Bosnian Serb and Croatian Serb armies. It was established that Belgrade, through the federal government, financed more than 90 percent of the Krajina budget in 1993; that the Supreme Defense Council decided to hide aid to Republika Srpska and Krajina from the public; that the National Bank of Krajina operated as a branch office of the National Bank of Yugoslavia; and that by March 1994 FR Yugoslavia, Krajina, and Republika Srpska used <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>currency.</b> Numerous documents demonstrated that branches of the Krajina Public Accountancy Service were incorporated into Serbia's accountancy system in May 1991, and that the financing of Krajina and Republika Srpska caused hyperinflation in FR Yugoslavia. The trial revealed that the JNA, the Serbian Ministry of Interior, and other entities (including Serb civilian groups and police) armed Serb civilians and local territorial defense groups in the RSK before the conflict escalated.|$|E

25|$|The {{final stage}} of {{completely}} free movement of capital was thought to require <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>currency</b> and monetary policy, eliminating the transaction costs and fluctuations of currency exchange. Following a Report of the Delors Commission in 1988, the Treaty of Maastricht made economic and monetary union an objective, first by completing the internal market, second by creating a European System of Central Banks to coordinate common monetary policy, and third by locking exchange rates and introducing <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>currency,</b> the euro. Today, 19 member states have adopted the euro, while 9 member states have either determined to opt-out or their accession has been delayed, particularly since the Eurozone crisis.

Using simulations, we modeled the evolution of either <b>a</b> <b>single</b> physiological <b>currency</b> between reproduction and survival, or of multiple such currencies. For a wide array of model specifications varying functional forms and strengths of the trade-offs, we show that the presence of multiple currencies (e. g. nutrients, time) generally results in the evolution of higher lifetime reproductive success through partial circumvention of such trade-offs. Evolution of the underlying physiology is also more highly contingent with multiple currencies. These results challenge the paradigm of <b>a</b> <b>single</b> survival-reproduction trade-off as central to life history evolution, suggesting greater roles for physiological constraints and contingency, and implying potential selection for evolution of multiple trade-off currencies...|$|R

25|$|A {{central bank}} {{can also use}} a mixture of policy {{settings}} that change depending on circumstances.

40|$|This is {{the only}} book in print in the world about the <b>single</b> global <b>currency,</b> and {{is the only}} book in the world priced in 147 currencies. It {{describes}} the origins of the current worldwide foreign exchange system, and tells how to change it; and save the world - trillions. The multicurrency foreign exchange trading system was developed about 2, 500 years ago to enable people of different currency areas to trade. That system has become far more sophisticated in the meantime and handles $ 2. 5 trillion per day; but it is very expensive and risky. It is now time to replace that system with <b>a</b> <b>single</b> global <b>currency.</b> In <b>a</b> 3 -G world with <b>a</b> <b>single</b> global <b>currency</b> managed by a global central bank within a global monetary union: - Annual transaction costs of $ 400 billion will be eliminated. - Worldwide asset values will increase by about $ 36 trillion. - Worldwide GDP will increase by about $ 9 trillion. - Global currency imbalances will be eliminated. - All Balance of Payments problems will be eliminated. - Currency crises will be prevented. - Currency speculation will be eliminated. - The need for foreign exchange reserves, with a current annual opportunity cost of approximately $ 470 billion, will be eliminated. Such gains are realistic and attainable if the world decides to pursue them. The monetary unions of Europe, the Caribbean, Africa and Brunei/Singapore have shown the way. What the people of the world want is sound, stable money and the end to the obsolete multicurrency foreign exchange system. <b>A</b> <b>single</b> global <b>currency</b> is no longer a utopian dream, but a realistic projection of what has been learned from current monetary unions, especially the euro. Each successive annual edition of this book will be priced in the remaining number of currencies until we reach, in the words of Nobel Prize winner, Robert Mundell, that odd number, preferably less than three: one The world needs to set the goal of <b>a</b> <b>single</b> global <b>currency,</b> to be managed by a global central bank, within a global monetary union, and begin planning - now. ...|$|R

25|$|British {{territorial}} {{expansion in}} India throughout the 19th century created an institutional environment that, on paper, guaranteed property rights among the colonisers, encouraged free trade, and created <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>currency</b> with fixed exchange rates, standardised {{weights and measures}} and capital markets within the company-held territories. It also established a system of railways and telegraphs, a civil service that aimed {{to be free from}} political interference, a common-law and an adversarial legal system. This coincided with major changes in the world economy– industrialisation, and significant growth in production and trade. However, at the end of colonial rule, India inherited an economy {{that was one of the}} poorest in the developing world, with industrial development stalled, agriculture unable to feed a rapidly growing population, a largely illiterate and unskilled labour force, and extremely inadequate infrastructure.|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} time in South Asia, {{political}} unity and military security allowed for a common economic system and enhanced trade and commerce, with increased agricultural productivity. The previous situation involving hundreds of kingdoms, many small armies, powerful regional chieftains, and internecine warfare, gave way to a disciplined central authority. Farmers were freed of tax and crop collection burdens from regional kings, paying instead to a nationally administered and strict-but-fair system of taxation as advised by the principles in the Arthashastra. Chandragupta Maurya established <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>currency</b> across India, and a network of regional governors and administrators and a civil service provided justice and security for merchants, farmers and traders. The Mauryan army wiped out many gangs of bandits, regional private armies, and powerful chieftains who sought to impose their own supremacy in small areas. Although regimental in revenue collection, Maurya also sponsored many public works and waterways to enhance productivity, while internal trade in India expanded greatly due to new-found political unity and internal peace.|$|E
25|$|The coinage of Edward the Elder in {{some ways}} {{continued}} the types and organisation current under his father Alfred in Wessex and English Mercia, but with the expansion of West Saxon control into the Midlands and East Anglia the currency system became more complex as new regions were incorporated into Edward’s kingdom. For {{the most part the}} coinage was non-portrait and simple in design, though some mints in English Mercia struck an interesting series of pictorial reverse types. Since mint names are again very rare, attributions must largely be made by working backwards from Æthelstan’s reign when mint names were often found on coins of the circumscription cross and bust crowned types. These coinages, struck at about thirty named mints after the conquest of the kingdom of York in 927, reflect a renewed effort on the king’s part to have a single, centrally controlled coinage spanning the kingdom: types were standardised, the royal title was expanded from the usual REX to REX SAXONUM or even REX TO(tius) BRIT(anniae), as one finds in contemporary charters. It was also under Æthelstan that coinage was first mentioned in any detail in legal documentation: a law-code issued by him at Grateley (probably around 926-30 though incorporating numismatic data from somewhat earlier) details the acceptance of <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>currency</b> and penalties for forgery, and goes on to list a series of minting places and the number of moneyers permitted to each.|$|E
