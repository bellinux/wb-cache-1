5|$|A four-stop continuo organ {{was built}} for the abbey in 1999 by Northampton-based organ builder Kenneth Tickell. The instrument, {{contained}} {{in a case of}} dark oak, is portable, and can be tuned to three pitches: A=440Hz (modern concert pitch), A=415Hz and A=465Hz. Iit is <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> tune at A=430. A lever pedal can reduce the stops sounding to only the 8' stop and, when released, returns the organ to the registration in use before it was depressed.|$|E
5|$|Although no {{polynomial}} time algorithm is known for this problem, more efficient algorithms than the brute-force search are known. For instance, the Bron–Kerbosch algorithm {{can be used to}} list all maximal cliques in worst-case optimal time, and it is <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> list them in {{polynomial time}} per clique.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the opening}} of the Barlow Road, pioneers {{traveling}} by land from the east followed the Oregon Trail to Wascopam Mission (now The Dalles) and floated down the Columbia River to Fort Vancouver, then a perilous and expensive journey. It was <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> drive livestock over Lolo Pass {{on the north side of}} Mount Hood, but that trail was too rugged for vehicles and unsuitable for wagons.|$|E

50|$|There are {{no serious}} {{disturbances}} at wetlands at {{the headwaters of}} Wolf Run. A trail passes close to the wetlands, {{but there is little}} sign of the wetlands being trampled by hikers. Deer browsing is <b>also</b> a <b>possible</b> threat <b>to</b> the area, but no impacts have been observed.

5|$|It is <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> check {{whether a}} given {{directed}} graph is a DAG in linear time, either {{by attempting to}} find a topological ordering and then testing for each edge whether the resulting ordering is valid or alternatively, for some topological sorting algorithms, by verifying that the algorithm successfully orders all the vertices without meeting an error condition.|$|E
5|$|It is <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> climb Ben Nevis {{from the}} Nevis Gorge car park at Steal {{at the head}} of the road up Glen Nevis, either by the {{south-east}} ridge or via the summit of Càrn Dearg (south-west). These routes require mild scrambling, are shorter and steeper than the Pony Track, and tend only to be used by experienced hill walkers.|$|E
5|$|It is <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> {{explain why}} zero is even without {{referring}} to formal definitions. The following explanations {{make sense of}} the idea that zero is even in terms of fundamental number concepts. From this foundation, one can provide a rationale for the definition itself—and its applicability to zero.|$|E

5|$|It is <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> {{remove a}} key–value pair from the dictionary. However, {{it is not}} {{sufficient}} to do so by simply emptying its cell. This would affect searches for other keys that have a hash value earlier than the emptied cell, but that are stored in a position later than the emptied cell. The emptied cell would cause those searches to incorrectly report that the key is not present.|$|E
5|$|It is <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> walk or {{cycle to}} the arena from central Malmö via Kroksbäck and Kroksbäcksparken. An area {{reserved}} for the parking of up to 1,000 bicycles {{is located on the}} eastern side of the arena. There are areas for charter buses as well as taxis beside the arena's main and side entrances.|$|E
5|$|Just {{as it is}} {{possible}} for a circle to be surrounded by six congruent circles that touch it, it is <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> arrange seven congruent Reuleaux triangles so that they all make contact with a central Reuleaux triangle of the same size. This is the maximum number possible for any curve of constant width.|$|E

5|$|Most enzyme {{kinetics}} studies concentrate on this initial, approximately linear part of enzyme reactions. However, it is <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> measure the complete reaction curve and fit this data to a non-linear rate equation. This way of measuring enzyme reactions is called progress-curve analysis. This approach is useful {{as an alternative}} to rapid kinetics when the initial rate is too fast to measure accurately.|$|E
5|$|The {{three main}} {{islands of the}} Monach Islands (Heisgeir), Ceann Iar, Ceann Ear and Shivinish are {{connected}} at low tides. It is said {{that at one time}} it was <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> walk all the way to Baleshare, and on to North Uist, five miles away at low tide. In the 16th century, a large tidal wave was said to have washed the route away.|$|E
5|$|A , or , is one {{of three}} senior members of the Yamayuri Council, {{although}} it is <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> generally speak of {{all the members of the}} Yamayuri Council as roses. A Rose makes the important decisions within this group, since she has control over the student council. Candidates for the position, which lasts through the school year, are chosen through an election. Any student can run to become a Rose, although the position is usually given to the en boutons, the Roses' petite sœurs.|$|E

It is planned to make targeted acquisitions, simpler in terms of movement, to verify the absence of chocks in front of the landing gear wheels, or the proper closing of engine cowling latches.|$|E
5|$|Copenhagen {{has long}} been {{associated}} with beer. Carlsberg beer has been brewed at the brewery's premises {{on the border between}} the Vesterbro and Valby districts since 1847 and {{has long been}} almost synonymous with Danish beer production. However, recent years have seen an explosive {{growth in the number of}} microbreweries so that Denmark today has more than 100 breweries, many of which are located in Copenhagen. Some like Nørrebro Bryghus also act as brewpubs where it is <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> eat on the premises.|$|E
5|$|Hunter (1991) {{has been}} {{described}} as the first sandbox game featuring full 3D, third-person graphics, thus making it an important precursor to the Grand Theft Auto series. The game consisted of a large, open world in which there were numerous possibilities to complete different missions. The character could travel on foot, or steal different vehicles such as cars, tanks, or even bicycles, boats, helicopters and hovercrafts. Moreover, Hunter also had many unique features such as day and night lighting, fuel modelling, a log book, aerial observation units, tank traps, land mines and computer-controlled rocket batteries and tracer guns. It was <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> ride a bicycle, swim, windsurf or even make a parachute jump from a helicopter.|$|E

5|$|In a {{first for}} the series, Days of Ruin {{includes}} online multiplayer over Nintendo's Wi-Fi Connection service, {{as well as a}} feature for players to share their own custom map designs and download maps made by others (custom maps and sharing custom maps is a feature present in all Advance Wars games). Over 150 premade maps are included in the game for use in local multiplayer, and designed for two, three, and four-player matches. Multiplayer games can be played with only one DS game card: each player can pass the game to the next player when it is their turn. It is <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> set all sides to CPU, which is useful for studying the AI.|$|E
5|$|It is <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> change one's coat of arms, with {{or without}} {{adopting}} or appending a new surname, by Royal Licence, {{that is to say}} a licence {{in the form of a}} warrant from the Crown directed to the Kings of Arms instructing them to exemplify the transferred arms or a version of them to the licensee in his or her new name. Royal Licences are issued on the advice of Garter King of Arms and are usually dependent on there being some constraining circumstances such as a testamentary injunction (a requirement in a will) or a good reason to wish to perpetuate a particular coat of arms. The Royal Licence is of no effect until and unless the exemplification is issued and recorded in the College. Royal Licences are gazetted and make a deed poll unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|It is <b>also</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> {{consider}} matrices with infinitely many rows and/or columns even if, being infinite objects, one cannot {{write down}} such matrices explicitly. All {{that matters is}} that for every element in the set indexing rows, and every element in the set indexing columns, there is a well-defined entry (these index sets need not even be subsets of the natural numbers). The basic operations of addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication and transposition can still be defined without problem; however matrix multiplication may involve infinite summations to define the resulting entries, and these are not defined in general.|$|E
