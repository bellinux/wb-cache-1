[...] Gyllenhaal was frustrated by the director's methods and commented in an interview, [...] "You get a take, 5 takes, 10 takes. Some places, 90 takes. But there is a stopping point. There's a point <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>you</b> go, 'That's {{what we have to}} work with.' But we would reshoot things. So there came a point where I would say, well, what do I do? Where's the risk?" [...] Downey said, [...] "I just decided, aside from several times I wanted to garrote him, that I was going to give him what he wanted. I think I'm a perfect person to work for him, because I understand gulags". Fincher responded, [...] "If an actor is going to let the role come to them, they can't resent the fact that I'm willing to wait as long as that takes. You know, the first day of production in San Francisco we shot 56 takes of Mark and Jake – and it's the 56th take that's in the movie". Ruffalo also backed up his director's methods when he said, [...] "The way I see it is, you enter into someone else's world as an actor. You can put your expectations aside and have an experience that's new and pushes and changes you, or hold on to what you think it should be and have a stubborn, immovable journey that's filled with disappointment and anger." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Lorentz-transform {{calculation}} above uses {{a definition}} of extended-simultaneity (i.e. of when and where events occur <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>you</b> were not present) that might {{be referred to as}} the co-moving or [...] "tangent free-float-frame" [...] definition. This definition is naturally extrapolated to events in gravitationally-curved spacetimes, and to accelerated observers, through use of a radar-time/distance definition that (unlike the tangent free-float-frame definition for accelerated frames) assigns a unique time and position to any event.|$|E

The {{distance}} {{at which the}} line first intersects and then leaves every settler's claim and improvement; prairie; river, creek, or other [...] "bottom"; or swamp, marsh, grove, and wind fall, with {{the course of the}} same at both points of intersection; also the distances <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>you</b> begin to ascend, arrive at the top, begin to descend, and reach the foot of all remarkable hills and ridges, with their courses, and estimated height, in feet, above the level land of the surrounding country, or above the bottom lands, ravines, or waters near which they are situated.|$|E

2500|$|Subjectivists assign numbers per {{subjective}} probability, i.e., as {{a degree}} of belief. The degree of belief has been interpreted as, [...] "the price <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>you</b> would buy or sell a bet that pays 1 unit of utility if E, 0 if not E." [...] The most popular version of subjective probability is Bayesian probability, which includes expert knowledge as well as experimental data to produce probabilities. [...] The expert knowledge is represented by some (subjective) prior probability distribution. [...] These data are incorporated in a likelihood function. The product of the prior and the likelihood, normalized, results in a posterior probability distribution that incorporates all the information known to date. By Aumann's agreement theorem, Bayesian agents whose prior beliefs are similar {{will end up with}} similar posterior beliefs. However, sufficiently different priors can lead to different conclusions regardless of how much information the agents share.|$|E
2500|$|Players {{are each}} dealt two cards, face {{up or down}} {{depending}} on the casino and the table <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>you</b> sit. In the U.S., the dealer is also dealt two cards, normally one up (exposed) and one down (hidden). In most other countries, the dealer receives one card face up. The value of cards two through ten is their pip value (2 through 10). Face cards (Jack, Queen, and King) are all worth ten. Aces can be worth one or eleven. A hand's value {{is the sum of}} the card values. Players are allowed to draw additional cards to improve their hands. A hand with an ace valued as 11 is called [...] "soft", meaning that the hand will not bust by taking an additional card; the value of the ace will become one to prevent the hand from exceeding 21. Otherwise, the hand is [...] "hard".|$|E

Consequently, certain lawless spirits would range the {{neighbourhood}} after lock-up, and, by putting in {{a quarter of an hour}} at the gymnasium before returning to their houses, escape comment. To this class belonged the shadowy forms previously mentioned.|$|E

"Will you {{permit me}} to ask, Mr. Bragg, if you feel no local {{attachments}} yourself," [...] enquired the baronet, throwing as much delicacy into the tones of his voice, as a question that he felt ought to be an insult to a man's heart, would allow--"if one tree is not more pleasant than another; the house {{you were born in}} more beautiful than a house into which you never entered; or the altar <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>you</b> have long worshipped, more sacred than another <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>you</b> never knelt?" ...|$|E
