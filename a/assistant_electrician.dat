These creatures dispersed hastily, but Cossar reached out incalculable limbs and managed to kill several with his boots and gun-butt. Then two of the men hacked through several of the main stems of the canary creeper--huge cylinders they were, a couple of feet in diameter, that came out by the sink at the back; and while Cossar set the house in order for the night, Bensington, Redwood, and one of the <b>assistant</b> <b>electricians</b> went cautiously round by the fowl runs in search of the rat-holes.|$|R

50|$|Malez did not {{immediately}} enrol in the local gymnasium, probably due to his family's financial circumstances.

In 1940, he was discharged and went to Paris where he was hired as an <b>assistant</b> <b>electrician</b> in the Paris Métro. In 1942, Slimane was in Paris. The capital fascinated him and yet the work was hard. He was accustomed to life in the village in the great outdoors, but was now confined in tunnels and underground eight hours a day in the metro.

Winterode worked with them to prepare roads and to harvest the tobacco and willow crops on the property. Additional patients were transferred in July and September 1911. Construction started on the first large building, A Building in October 1912. Patients were used to work on the construction of the hospital in addition to working in its day-to-day functions. Men were given manual labored work and women had to knit and mend clothing for staff as well as patients (Osborn, Lawrence). As reported in the State Lunacy Commission Report of December 1912, patients worked as [...] "hod carriers" [...] and <b>assistants</b> to <b>electricians</b> and plumbers. Construction necessitated that they push [...] "barrows of concrete up a tramway three and a half stories in height." [...] They excavated [...] "10000 cubic yards of earth in about 10 weeks." [...] In addition, they unloaded 238 cars of cement, stone, and other building materials. [...] "The laundry work for the patients is done by two adult males and an epileptic imbecile 10 years of age who has been taught to feed the ringer (sic) and at which he has become quite adept.

Gifford, June 1986; reformatted by Arjun Sabharwal and Tamara Jones, September 2011 Biographical Sketch 1900, Dec. 13 born in Toledo, son of James E. Gosser, a railroad switchman and yardmaster, and Mary (Bradly) Gosser 1918 began working at Willys-Overland 1919 - 1921 served 30 months in Ionia (Michigan) reformatory 1921 resumed working as electrician at Willys-Overland 1924 promoted to <b>assistant</b> chief <b>electrician</b> (foreman) 1933 - 1934 involved in organizing union at Willys-Overland 1935 joined the United Automobile. Aircraft, Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW); demoted from his job 1937 elected union chairman of Willys-Overland 1938 - 1942 president of Local 12, UAW, Toledo 1942 - 1947 director of Region 2 B, UAW-CIO; member of International UAW-CIO Board 1947 founded children's summer camp for Local 12 children 1947 - 1963 international vice·president for skilled trades, UAW-CIO/UAW-AFL-CIO 1950 married Ruth Ann 1954 an organizer of the Toledo Industrial Development Council 1955 founded Willys Unit Diagnostic Clinic 1955 - 1967 member of Toledo-Lucas County Port Authority 1959 testified before the McClellan Committee of the U. S. Senate in regard to his personal affairs and administration of the UAW 1962 indicted before grand jury on charges of conspiracy; Gosser had obtained a confidential Internal Revenue Service report on his personal finances 1963 Willys Unit Diagnostic Clinic became independent as Toledo Health and Retiree Center, Inc., with Gosser as consultant 1965 U. S. Supreme Court upheld his conviction 1965 - 1966 served a one-year term in the Medical Center for Federal Prisoners, Springfield, Missouri 1969 died in Toledo Scope and Content Note As local president, regional director and international vice-president of the United Automobile, Aircraft, Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW-CIO, UAW-AFL-CIO). Richard 'T. Gosser carried a lot of weight in Toledo. He forged alliances with Democratic Party figures and business leaders in Toledo. As a result, he found himself sitting {{on the wrong side of}} the political fence more than once. In his role as labor advocate, Gosser pursued negotiations with the Willys-Overland Corporation, yet maintained cordial relations with its chief officers. Henry J. and Edgar Kaiser. The Gosser Papers, although they cover a range of thirty years, do not fully document Gosser's career. Internal UAW circular letters and Local 12 correspondence, for example, are conspicuously absent. On the other hand, the Local 12 scrapbooks, with clippings largely from Toledo and Detroit general and labor newspapers, do record the public activities of both local and international unions. Other UAW material deals with proposals for union-owned television stations with state political activity 1 and with Gosser’s resignation. The series of international executive board minutes, of the proceedings of the constitutional conventions and the runs of United Auto Worker and Solidarity together form an invaluable. If not unique, source for the union's international activity from 1947 to 1963. Finally, a group of interviews collected about 1963 from tong-time members of Local 12 recount the local's formation and earl y struggles. Related to the UAW material are files from Gosser's service as consultant to the Toledo Health and Retiree Center, a clinic originally established by Gosser for Local 12 members but, since 1963, open to all -Other personal interests which are reflected in this collection are the advocacy of retirement at sixty, contained in the material on Sixty Now, and summer recreation for children of union members, exemplified by the material on the Children's Summer Camp in Onsted, Michigan. The bulk of the material in the Gosser Papers dates from the 1900 $. Prominent correspondents include Charles Ballard and Thomas Ludlow Ashley. During this period, the last decade of his life, Gosser's most troubling concern was a case against him, his assistant Donald J. Pinciotti, and Toledo numbers racketeer Ted Maison, on charges of conspiring to take a confidential report of an investigation into Gosser's finances from the Internal Revenue Service. Toledo trade unionists made the case a cause célèbre in their efforts to obtain clemency and pardon for Gosser. Although the case estranged Gosser from WaIter Reuther and the international leadership of the UAW, many other leaders of labor and other causes wrote letters in defense of Gosser to the President. There is other material useful for the study of postwar economic development in Toledo, This includes publications of the Toledo Industrial Development Council (1939, 1949) and a handbook of the Toledo Area Development Corporation (1962). The relations between individuals in Toledo labor unions, party politics, newspapers, and business can be studied through the use of different items in this collection. Gosser was known as a man with both many friends and many enemies. His collection, although not comprehensive in the representation of his entire career, does reveal the political power he had in his community. Note: Gosser's official UAW correspondence files and related items are housed in the Walter P. Reuther Library, Wayne State University.
