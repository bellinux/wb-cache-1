5|$|The {{majority}} of Accum's publications {{were written in}} English. They were executed in a style that made them quite accessible to the common man. Many scientific contributions were brought forth through his writings, which were influential in the popularization of chemistry during this era. In 1820, Accum published Treatise on Adulteration of Food, in which he denounced the use of chemical additives to food. This ground-breaking work {{marked the beginning of}} an awareness of need for food safety oversight. Accum {{was the first person to}} tackle the subject and to reach <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>audience</b> through his activities. His book, controversial at the time, found <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>audience</b> and sold well. However, it threatened established practices within the food processing industry, earning him many enemies among the London food manufacturers. Accum left England after a lawsuit was brought against him. He lived out the rest of his life as a teacher at an industrial institution in Berlin.|$|E
5|$|A passionate {{advocate}} of evolutionary theory, Gould wrote prolifically on the subject, {{trying to communicate}} his understanding of contemporary evolutionary biology to <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>audience.</b> A recurring theme in his writings is the history and development of pre-evolutionary and evolutionary thought. He was also an enthusiastic baseball fan and sabermetrician (analyst of baseball statistics), and made frequent reference to the sport in his essays. Many of his baseball essays were anthologized in his posthumously published book Triumph and Tragedy in Mudville (2003).|$|E

5|$|They {{decided to}} focus on a few aspects and assess the value of other features. This approach, they hope, helps to {{maintain}} the quality of their games. The company focused on the development of role-playing games, with the team working on established franchises with a fan base and introducing lesser-known franchises to <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>audience.</b> When the team develops an open-world game, they prioritise quest design over the size of its world in the belief that having choices to make encourages players to immerse themselves in the game.|$|E
5|$|Dragon Quest {{was created}} by Yuji Horii, who took {{inspiration}} from previous role-playing games such as Wizardry, Ultima, and his own 1983 title The Portopia Serial Murder Case. Horii wanted to create an RPG which would appeal to <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>audience</b> {{of people who were}} unfamiliar with the genre of video games in general. He tried to place a greater emphasis on storytelling and emotional involvement, as well as simplify the interface and expose the mostly Western computer genre to the Japanese console market. Manga artist and Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama produced the game's artwork and Koichi Sugiyama composed its music. The North American version featured numerous changes, including battery-backed RAM save games (rather than using a password save system), modified character sprites and pseudo-Elizabethan English style dialog.|$|E
5|$|Following LeRoy's {{death in}} 1932, his film {{collection}} {{was bought by}} the Museum of Modern Art in 1936. The museum's acquisition and subsequent screenings of A Trip to the Moon, {{under the direction of}} MoMA's film curator Iris Barry, opened the film up once again to <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>audience</b> of Americans and Canadians and established it definitively as a landmark in the history of cinema. LeRoy's incomplete print became the most commonly seen version of the film and the source print for most other copies, including the Cinémathèque française's print. A complete version of the film, including the entire celebration sequence, was finally reconstructed in 1997 from various sources by the Cinémathèque Méliès, a foundation set up by the Méliès family.|$|E

5|$|Lehman Brothers sold One Times Square in 1997 to the Jamestown, L.P. for $117 million. Filings {{related to}} the sale {{revealed}} that the billboards on the tower had been generating a net revenue of $7 million yearly, representing a 300% profit. With growing tourism and high traffic in the Times Square area (with a yearly average of over 100 million pedestriansalongside its prominence in media coverage of New Year's festivities, seen by <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>audience</b> yearly), annual revenue from the signs grew to over $23 million by the year 2012rivaling London's Piccadilly Circus as the most valuable public advertising space in the world.|$|E
5|$|Resistance to the Townshend Acts grew slowly. The General Court was not {{in session}} when news of the acts reached Boston in October 1767. Adams {{therefore}} used the Boston Town Meeting to organize an economic boycott, and called for other towns to do the same. By February 1768, towns in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut had joined the boycott. Opposition to the Townshend Acts was also encouraged by Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania, a series of popular essays by John Dickinson which started appearing in December 1767. Dickinson's argument that the new taxes were unconstitutional had been made before by Adams, but never to such <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>audience.</b>|$|E
5|$|The game began {{development}} in 2012: the project began when Masaru Oyamada told series producer Koichi Ishii {{that he could}} create a legitimate entry in the Mana series for mobile platforms. His idea was for a game true to the series that would reach <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>audience.</b> The game's multiplayer, inspired by that used in Secret of Mana, was developed using the Photon Server middleware. The art director was series newcomer Hiroyuki Suzuki, while the character and monster designs were done by Taiki and Ryota Murayama. The music was composed by {{a team led by}} Tsuyoshi Sekito. The theme song was written and performed by singer-songwriter Kokia.|$|E

5|$|Vidya {{had five}} film {{releases}} in 2007. She played {{a variety of}} roles in them, including a woman suffering from multiple sclerosis in Mani Ratnam's semi-biographical drama Guru, a single mother in the comedy Heyy Babyy, and a dissociative identity disorder patient in the psychological thriller Bhool Bhulaiyaa. Though she was criticised for her styling in Heyy Babyy, the three films were commercially successful. The following year, she played opposite Ajay Devgan in the drama Halla Bol (2008) and Shahid Kapoor in the romantic comedy Kismat Konnection (2008), both of which failed to find <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>audience.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1741, the Chamouny {{valley and}} its glaciers {{on the north}} side of the massif were {{discovered}} and written about by two aristocratic travelling Englishmen, named William Windham and Richard Pococke. The descriptions of their exploits were published across Europe, bringing the mountains of the Mont Blanc range to the attention of <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>audience</b> for the first time. In 1760, Horace-Bénédict de Saussure offered a large financial prize to the first people who successfully ascended Mont Blanc. The summit was finally attained on 8 August 1786 by two Chamonix men, the guide Jacques Balmat and Dr. Michel Paccard. The decades that followed saw the gradual opening up of Chamonix to the world, as well as the rest of the Mont Blanc massif. The many published accounts of climbs and impressive sights amongst or around the mountain range attracted numerous wealthy and notable visitors, for whom a visit to marvel at the Sea of Ice (the Mer de Glace) became a fashionable thing to experience.|$|E
5|$|In 1820 Accum {{began the}} public {{struggle}} against harmful food additives with his book entitled A Treatise on Adulterations of Food and Culinary Poisons. Some additives derived from plants, {{and used as}} preservatives or to alter tastes or appearance, had already been in use for some time. The beginning of the 19th century saw a rapid increase in the industrial preparation and packaging of foods. The drastic increase of additives used in these processes became a serious health concern. The production and distribution of food, instead of being one between local farmers and townspeople, increasingly became a centralized process in large factories. The proliferation of newly discovered chemicals {{and the absence of}} laws moderating their use, made it possible for unscrupulous merchants to use them to boost profits at a cost to the public health. Accum was the first to publicly proclaim the hazards of this practice and to reach <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>audience</b> with his concerns.|$|E

5|$|In 1991, Khan {{was cast}} as the male lead in Rahul Rawail's romantic drama Bekhudi (1992) {{alongside}} debutante Kajol, but after completing the first shooting schedule of the film, he {{was considered to be}} unprofessional by Rawail and was replaced by Kamal Sadanah. While filming Bekhudi, Khan met actress Amrita Singh who he married in October 1991. Singh gave birth to their daughter (Sara) and son (Ibrahim) in 1993 and 2001 respectively, and the couple later separated in 2004. In 1993, Khan made his acting debut with Parampara, a drama directed by Yash Chopra. The film, which tells the story of two estranged brothers (played by Aamir Khan and Khan), failed to find <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>audience.</b> He next appeared opposite Mamta Kulkarni and Shilpa Shirodkar in the box office flops Aashiq Awara and Pehchaan (both 1993) respectively, but Khan earned the Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut for his performance in Aashiq Awara at the 39th Filmfare Awards.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} create an RPG that would appeal to <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>audience</b> {{unfamiliar}} with the genre, and video games in general, Horii {{wanted to create a}} new kind of RPG that did not rely on previous experience with the Dungeons & Dragons tabletop RPG, did not require hundreds of hours of rote fighting, and could appeal to any kind of gamer. To accomplish this he needed to simplify the system and have players associate themselves with the hero. Thus as the game progressed, the hero would become stronger, in contrast to games like Super Mario Bros. where the character Mario did not become progressively more powerful during the game. He wanted to build on Portopia and place a greater emphasis on storytelling and emotional involvement. He developed a coming-of-age tale that audiences could relate to and made use of RPG level-building gameplay as a way to represent this.|$|E
5|$|Other {{characters}} {{include the}} {{various members of}} the Kingsglaive and Regis' council: Banjō Ginga (JP) /John DeMita (EN) as Clarus Amicitia, father to main character Gladiolus; Wataru Takagi (JP) /Ben Diskin (EN) as Pelna Khara; and Fuminori Komatsu (JP) /Max Mittelman (EN) as Tredd Furia. Unvoiced characters include Kingsglaive members Sonitus Bellum and Axis Arra. While both English and Japanese voicetracks were produced, lip syncing for all versions was matched to the English voice work. The lead voice actors, such as Paul, were chosen so they would be recognized and appeal to <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>audience,</b> in addition to their acting abilities. The Japanese voice casting followed a similar model, choosing well-known actors for the lead roles. Casting was handled by Rui Kawada, who also acted as general project manager. The compartmentalization of the development meant that the characters were mostly voiced by different actors to Final Fantasy XV. Originally there were plans for both the movie and game voice cast to cross over, but these were scrapped.|$|E

5|$|Rise of Mana was {{intended}} to reach <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>audience,</b> gaining an attention only previously seen by Dawn of Mana in 2006. The concept of the main character switching between angelic and demonic form was suggested by Yagi. The original concept was to keep both characters in separate bodies, with the unoccupied character being controlled by the game's artificial intelligence. The team used the Photon Server middleware to develop the game's multiplayer component. The development team initially thought of creating custom middleware, but the rebuild needed {{would have taken a}} whole year, threatening the project's existence. In search of suitable middleware, the team contacted Fixer, who offered them the use of multiple options including Photon Server. Trying out Photon Server, all the problems faced by the developers were resolved within a two-month period, and the middleware's inbuilt security structure and specification match with the game persuaded the project's engineers to greenlight its use. Rise of Mana was the first Japanese game to use Photon Server. The team needed to create two different specifications for iOS and Android, as Android had higher graphical power. During the early development stage, the team {{thought it would be fun}} to re-create the multiplayer elements in Secret of Mana. The initial idea was to have multiplayer available in standard quests, but this took up too much operational space to be practical, so they reduced this to raid battles. Due to the use of Photon Server, additional player characters could be fully rendered rather than appearing as ghost-like transparent helpers.|$|E
5|$|While {{the book}} was {{readable}} enough to sell, its dryness ensured that it was seen as aimed at specialist scientists {{and could not be}} dismissed as mere journalism or imaginative fiction. Unlike the still-popular Vestiges, it avoided the narrative style of the historical novel and cosmological speculation, though the closing sentence clearly hinted at cosmic progression. Darwin had long been immersed in the literary forms and practices of specialist science, and made effective use of his skills in structuring arguments. David Quammen has described the book as written in everyday language for <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>audience,</b> but noted that Darwin's literary style was uneven: in some places he used convoluted sentences that are difficult to read, while in other places his writing was beautiful. Quammen advised that later editions were weakened by Darwin making concessions and adding details to address his critics, and recommended the first edition. James T. Costa said that because {{the book was}} an abstract produced in haste in response to Wallace's essay, it was more approachable than the big book on natural selection Darwin had been working on, which would have been encumbered by scholarly footnotes and much more technical detail. He added that some parts of Origin are dense, but other parts are almost lyrical, and the case studies and observations are presented in a narrative style unusual in serious scientific books, which broadened its audience.|$|E
