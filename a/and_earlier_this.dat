"An Oklahoma County {{judge has}} {{permanently}} blocked {{a state law}} that requires women seeking abortions to have an ultrasound and listen to {{a detailed description of}} the fetus before prior to the abortion. District Judge Brian Dixon handed down an order Wednesday ruling that the law is unconstitutional and unenforceable. The order says the statute passed in 2010 is an unconstitutional special law because it addresses only patients and physicians concerning abortions and not other medical care. Enforcement of the law has been blocked since shortly after Nova Health Systems, operator of Reproductive Services of Tulsa, challenged its constitutionality in May 2010. It would have forced a woman seeking an abortion to undergo an ultrasound, have the image placed in front of her and then hear it described in detail" [...] Wisconsin has recently passed a similarly restrictive law entitled [...] "The Coercive and Web Cam Abortion Prevention Act". [...] "The law, which took effect on Friday, requires women visit a doctor at least three times before having a drug-induced abortion, forces physicians to determine whether women are being coerced into having an abortion and prohibits women and doctors from using web cams during the procedure". [...] "The Wisconsin law is the latest in a number of anti-abortion measures pressed by conservative lawmakers in the nation." [...] Other examples of legislation aimed at restricting abortion rights have occurred in Mississippi and Arizona. [...] "Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant signed a law on Monday that may force the state's only abortion clinic out of business, <b>and</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>this</b> month Arizona Governor Jan Brewer signed a controversial measure banning most abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy." [...] In Arizona, [...] "The Republican-controlled House of Representatives passed a bill to prohibit abortions after the 18th week of pregnancy; a bill to protect doctors from being sued if they withhold health information about a pregnancy that could cause a woman to seek an abortion; and a bill to mandate that how school curriculums address the topic of unwanted pregnancies." [...] The bills have not been signed by Gov. Jan Brewer but she has been a longtime advocate against abortion rights. Mississippi has recently enacted a law which puts more stringent requirements on physicians who wish to become licensed to perform abortions in the state. [...] "The law, signed by Gov. Phil Bryant, requires doctors performing abortions to have admitting privileges at a local hospital and to be board-certified in obstetrics and gynecology or be eligible to be certified, meaning the physician has completed training in the specialty." [...] There has been an effort to define when life begins by some states and Mississippi is one example. Last Fall, Gov. Bryant attempted to amend the language in the State Constitution defining life as beginning when an egg is fertilized. 58% of voters in Mississippi voted against the amendment."The [...] "personhood" [...] proposal would have granted legal protections to fetuses, limited the use of some birth control and limited abortions." [...] Some are more stringent than others. [...] "Ohio lawmakers are considering a bill that would largely ban abortion when a fetal heartbeat can be heard, which can be as early as six weeks."." [...] These states are examples of an ever increasing trend to, what some may call, limit women's reproductive rights. [...] "In 2011, states passed 92 provisions that imposed limits on abortion, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit group that supports abortion rights, but produces data that are cited by groups on both sides of the debate.
