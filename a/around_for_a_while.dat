This time she joined the expansion Peoria Redwings in 1946 and was back with a last-place team. Lee went 12–23 with a 2.74 ERA as she {{led the league in}} losses. In 1947, pitching sidearm, she began with Peoria and landed with the Grand Rapids Chicks during the midseason. She posted a combined mark of 9–11 with 29 strikeouts and a 2.24 ERA in 24 games. During {{the first round of the}} playoffs, Grand Rapids lost to Rockford in five games.|$|E
25|$|India {{showed more}} {{determination}} {{than they had}} done in 5 days of test cricket before this one – 3 of them in an abject 10 wicket humiliation in Mumbai. First the tail wagged (if not in Australian proportions); the last two wickets added 58 runs {{in the company of}} VVS Laxman who batting at No.6 stroked a fluent and graceful 59. Raju scored an important 30 runs, and even Venkatesh Prasad hung <b>around</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> as India chipped away at some of the deficit. Laxman was the last man out, a tad unfairly perhaps – replays showed the ball popped up off his arm – as India were bowled out for 171, 274 in arrears. As expected, Steve Waugh asked India to follow-on.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} that the FCC continues to be influenced by the corporate media lobby. The strong, direct relationships that have developed over the years between regulators and corporate media lobbyists, is essential to greater influence. It goes much deeper than the idea that the lobby has simply been <b>around</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> Members of the FCC have traditionally had strong connections to industry. As the job of an FCC commissioner or staffer is often highly technical, and specific knowledge of the dynamics of the telecommunications and media industries must be known, commissioners are often plucked out of high-paying jobs in the industry. History has shown, {{due to the fact that}} FCC Commissioners are appointed only to five-year terms, that there is a revolving door between the Commission and industry.|$|E

500|$|The idea of Lisa dating Nelson {{had been}} <b>around</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> with several {{different}} versions being pitched. The writers wanted a [...] "silly" [...] Homer story {{to balance the}} episode out, {{and the idea of}} using the telemarketing scam for this had also been <b>around</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> By this time, the show had begun to have episodes revolving around secondary characters. This was the first episode to revolve around Nelson, and was done to partly explain why Nelson acts the way he does. The words to Nelson's song were contributed by Mike Scully's daughters. The scene in which Milhouse passes Lisa's note to Nelson was written by Bill Oakley, with the line, [...] "He can't hear you, we had to pack his ears with gauze", being George Meyer's line. There was a debate as to how injured Milhouse should look without it looking disturbing, and the drop of blood coming from his nose was decided to be enough. Milhouse liking Vaseline on toast was based on a child from Josh Weinstein's school days who everyday would get onto the bus with a piece of toast, which had Vaseline on it.|$|E
500|$|The {{fourth and}} final section, which begins at 5:35, is a brief {{instrumental}} reprise of the second movement {{that serves as a}} coda. After a second solo, a brief guitar riff is introduced, which Jonny Greenwood says [...] "was something I had floating <b>around</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> and the song needed a certain burn. It happened to be the right key and the right speed and it fit right in." [...] The song ends, as does the second section, with a short chromatically descending guitar motif.|$|E

Mercado later compared Diana and Paul to Australia's Prime Minister Julia Gillard and her predecessor Kevin Rudd. He said [...] "Arrogant men rarely see wily women sneaking up from behind to stab them in the back. Kevin Rudd has just been forced to stand aside as Australian Prime Minister to avoid an embarrassing defeat at the hands of Deputy Leader Julia Gillard and now Neighbours Paul Robinson could be the next to go with a celebrated 80's superbitch infiltrating Ramsay Street".

500|$|The {{original}} {{concept for}} the episode {{came from a}} few lines of show ideas written by George Meyer. One of them read [...] "Bart the homo", and Ron Hauge was selected to write the episode, with the story stemming from that line. The idea of using filmmaker John Waters as a guest star had been <b>around</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> Many of the staff were fans of his work, and showrunners Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein had planned to use him in an episode called [...] "Lisa and Camp", which revolved around Lisa [...] "discovering the joys of campy things". Their idea was combined with Meyer's and it became this episode. The episode was originally titled [...] "Bart Goes to Camp", but was renamed because the joke was too oblique. Mike B. Anderson directed the episode, telling The Gold Coast Bulletin: [...] "When I read the script I was enthralled, {{not only because of}} the visual possibilities, but also because the story felt very solid. It was engaging and surprising and I really put heart into that episode." ...|$|E

Hutton told Tyson to [...] "Stick <b>around</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> Frank, we may not have to bat again", a prediction that Tyson later thought verged on second sight.

That being said, if O God Save Us All is {{more of the same}}, it’s more of the same done better. The album really shines in Disciple’s discography for several of the following reasons. First of all, the message of the album is laid out like a story that unfolds with each new chapter. The music is balanced and the flow of the album is very well done. There is a nice mix of radio-friendly, ballad, and too-hard-for-radio screaming. Plus, it doesn’t hurt that a song or two feel a little bit like Disciple’s great This Might Sting a Little album." ...|$|E

[...] Back then, bohemianism [...] was the pursuit of liberation, of a splash of sincerity, and not total hypocrisy. Such was the need for bohemianism. Not necessarily that of a marginalized or impoverished type. They thought they were much freer, much more sincere, much more authentic toward their condition, toward their creation. There were charming guys, like Tonegaru or Stelaru, charming by means of their intelligence and spiritual games during nights of drunkenness, during which they would lose themselves, but would communicate." ...|$|E

During an interview in 2005, Jared Leto said [...] "'Attack' was a song that wasn't scheduled to be recorded at all. I'd been playing it – I'd play it in the desert in Morocco, I was playing it in Thailand – I was playing it everywhere." [...] When Jared tried performing the song {{with the rest of}} the band, something was wrong. [...] "On acoustic it was great; but when we played it as a band, it just fell flat on its face." [...] "As soon as the bass got in there…" [...] Matt Wachter continued. [...] "Yeah, so it was either replace Matt or throw the song out." [...] Jared played it acoustically for Josh Abraham; [...] "I was playing it outside of the studio one night on acoustic guitar and Josh walked out and, as a joke, I said 'Hey, you wanna hear a hit song?' I was just talking. I started playing the verse and went into the chorus and he stopped me on the first chorus and said 'It's the best song you have. You have to record it'. So we all got in a circle and something about it changed. Something about us changed. And it became the first song on the record and the first single off our album. So he did a great job on encouraging us to do that song. And now I really love it."
