5|$|Critics {{classify}} Little Gidding as a poem of {{fire with}} an emphasis on purgation and the Pentecostal fire. The beginning of the poem discusses time and winter, with <b>attention</b> <b>paid</b> <b>to</b> the arrival of summer. The images of snow, which provoke desires for a spiritual life, transition into an analysis of the four classical elements of fire, earth, air and water and how fire is the primary element of the four. Following this is a discussion on death and destruction, things unaccomplished, and regret for past events.|$|E
5|$|Marlohe {{had secured}} the role after two auditions for {{director}} Sam Mendes and casting director Debbie McWilliams. She looked to Xenia Onatopp {{as a point}} of inspiration for her performance. Distancing herself from the Bond girl title, she interpreted the character as more modern and realistic. Media commentators characterized Sévérine as a femme fatale and an anti-heroine. Costume designer Jany Temime designed Sévérine's wardrobe using concepts from film noir as well as contemporary fashion, with close <b>attention</b> <b>paid</b> <b>to</b> the black dress she wears when meeting Bond in a Macau casino.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the novel, varying {{perceptions}} of reality that arise due to cultural differences between its characters are emphasized and contrasted. Carpentier explores hybridization, nature, voodoo, ethnicity, history and destiny, confusion, violence, and sexuality {{in a style}} that blends history with fiction and uses repetition to emphasize the cyclical nature of events. The novel was largely well-received with much <b>attention</b> <b>paid</b> <b>to</b> Carpentier's inclusion of magic realism and The Kingdom of This World {{has been described as}} an important work in the development of this genre in Caribbean and Latin American literature. However, some technical aspects of his style have been ignored by the academic community, and the novel's narrative organization has been criticized.|$|E
5|$|Modern fantasy sports {{began in}} 1980 with the {{invention}} of Rotisserie League Baseball by New York writer Daniel Okrent and several friends. Participants in a Rotisserie league draft notional teams {{from the list of}} active Major League Baseball players and play out an entire imaginary season with game outcomes based on the players' latest real-world statistics. Rotisserie-style play quickly became a phenomenon. Now known more generically as fantasy baseball, it has inspired similar games based on an array of different sports. The field boomed with increasing Internet access and new fantasy sports–related websites. By 2008, 29.9 million people in the United States and Canada were playing fantasy sports, spending $800million on the hobby. The burgeoning popularity of fantasy baseball is also credited with the increasing <b>attention</b> <b>paid</b> <b>to</b> sabermetrics—first among fans, only later among baseball professionals.|$|E
