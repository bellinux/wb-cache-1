40|$|Abstract This paper {{examines}} the correspondence between two approaches to astrometric observational reductions: {{the approach based}} on angular observables used for optical observations, and {{the approach based on}} the interferometric delay observable used for very long baseline radio interferometry (VLBI) observations. Specifically, of interest here is the group of algorithms that have become standard in accounting for the physical effects traditionally called <b>annual</b> and diurnal <b>aberration</b> and gravitational light bending. These algorithms are important because they must be applied to all wide-angle astrometric measurements, whether ground-or space-based, and regardless of the distance of the objects observed. A procedure is presented by which VLBI algorithms can be used for optical observations. This scheme can help to guarantee consistent treatment of observational results in the tw...|$|R
40|$|A {{satellite}} configuration {{having two}} gyroscopes with axes {{parallel to the}} boresight of a telescope and two {{at right angles to}} the telescope and approximately parallel and perpendicular to the earth's axis is proposed for measuring geodetic precessions due to the earth's motion about the sun, higher order geodetic terms calculated from the earth's quadrapole mass moment (0. 010 arc-sec/year in a 400 nautical mile polar orbit), and deflection by the sun of the starlight signal for the reference telescope. Data from the experiment also contain large periodic signals due to the <b>annual</b> and orbital <b>aberrations</b> of starlight which are useful in providing a built in reference signal of known amplitude for scaling the relativity signals, and should yield a singularly precise measurement of the parallax of the reference star. The development of the gyroscope and its readout system are discussed, as well as signal integration, drag-free control, and attitude control...|$|R
50|$|From {{a modern}} point of view, Laplace's {{analysis}} is incorrect. Not knowing about Lorentz' invariance of static fields, Laplace assumed that when an object like the Earth is {{moving around the}} Sun, the attraction of the Earth would not be toward the instantaneous position of the Sun, but toward where the Sun had been if its position was retarded using the relative velocity (this retardation actually does happen with the optical position of the Sun, and is called <b>annual</b> solar <b>aberration).</b> Putting the Sun immobile at the origin, when the Earth is moving in an orbit of radius R with velocity v presuming that the gravitational influence moves with velocity c, moves the Sun's true position ahead of its optical position, by an amount equal to vR/c, which is the travel time of gravity from the sun to the Earth times the relative velocity {{of the sun and}} the Earth. The pull of gravity (if it behaved like a wave, such as light) would then be always displaced {{in the direction of the}} Earth's velocity, so that the Earth would always be pulled toward the optical position of the Sun, rather than its actual position. This would cause a pull ahead of the Earth, which would cause the orbit of the Earth to spiral outward. Such an outspiral would be suppressed by an amount v/c compared to the force which keeps the Earth in orbit; and since the Earth's orbit is observed to be stable, Laplace's c must be very large. As is now known, it may be considered to be infinite in the limit of straight-line motion, since as a static influence, it is instantaneous at distance, when seen by observers at constant transverse velocity. For orbits in which velocity (direction of speed) changes slowly, it is almost infinite.|$|R
25|$|In {{the case}} of <b>annual</b> <b>aberration</b> of starlight, the {{direction}} of incoming starlight {{as seen in the}} Earth's moving frame is tilted relative to the angle observed in the Sun's frame. Since the direction of motion of the Earth changes during its orbit, the direction of this tilting changes {{during the course of the}} year, and causes the apparent position of the star to differ from its true position as measured in the inertial frame of the Sun.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} between these phenomena is only valid if the observer and source's frames are inertial frames. In practice, because the Earth is not an inertial rest frame but experiences centripetal acceleration towards the Sun, many aberrational effects such as <b>annual</b> <b>aberration</b> on Earth cannot be considered light-time corrections. However, if the time between emission and detection of the light is short compared to the orbital period of the Earth, the Earth may be approximated as an inertial frame and aberrational effects are equivalent to light-time corrections.|$|E

These observations were originally intended to demonstrate conclusively the existence of the <b>annual</b> <b>aberration</b> of light, a phenomenon that Bradley had unexpectedly discovered in 1725-6. However, there were some residual discrepancies in the stars' positions that were not explained by aberration, and Bradley suspected that they were caused by nutation taking place over the 18.6 year period of the revolution of the nodes of the Moon's orbit. This was confirmed by his 20-year series of observations, in which he discovered that the celestial pole moved in a slightly flattened ellipse of 18 by 16 arcseconds about its mean position.|$|E
