5|$|The French playwright Victorien Sardou wrote {{more than}} 70 plays, {{almost all of}} them successful, <b>and</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> them {{performed}} today. In the early 1880s Sardou began a collaboration with actress Sarah Bernhardt, whom he provided with a series of historical melodramas. His third Bernhardt play, La Tosca, which premiered in Paris on 24November 1887, and in which she starred throughout Europe, was an outstanding success, with more than 3,000 performances in France alone.|$|E
5|$|The black {{community}} of Africville, {{on the southern}} shores of Bedford Basin adjacent to the Halifax Peninsula, was spared the direct force of the blast by the shadow effect of the raised ground to the south. However, Africville's small and frail homes were heavily damaged by the explosion. Families recorded the deaths of five residents. Africville received little of the donated relief funds <b>and</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the progressive reconstruction invested {{in other parts of}} the city after the explosion.|$|E

5|$|Amending the UN Charter, {{possibly}} {{through a}} Charter Review Conference under Article 109 of the UN Charter, is a commonly cited possibility.

There have been only five amendments to the UN Charter since 1945, <b>and</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> them were done through the Article 109 process. Louis Sohn and Grenville Clark, in their 1958 book World Peace Through World Law, proposed establishing a UN Parliamentary Assembly through this method.|$|E
5|$|Banksia sessilis has a {{somewhat}} complicated taxonomic history. It was collected from King George Sound in 1801 and described by Robert Brown in 1810 as Dryandra floribunda, a name {{by which it}} was known for many years. However, Joseph Knight had published the name Josephia sessilis in 1809, which had precedence due to its earlier date, and the specific name was formalised in 1924. Four varieties are recognised. It is a prickly plant with little apparent horticultural potential, <b>and</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the varieties are commonly seen in cultivation. A profuse producer of nectar, B.sessilis is valuable to the beekeeping industry.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1964, {{however, the}} Kingston Trio's {{dominance}} in record sales and concert bookings began to wane, due partly to imitators in the pop-folk world {{and also to}} the rise of other commercial folk groups like Peter, Paul and Mary. The British Invasion spearheaded by The Beatles, who were signed by EMI/Capitol just as the Trio's seven-year contract was running out, depressed sales of acoustic folk albums significantly, and Capitol did not make a serious effort to re-sign the group. Werber secured a generous signing bonus from Decca Records, and the last four albums of the Kingston Trio's first decade were released by that label. Without the production facilities of Capitol, however, and the expertise of Voyle Gilmore and engineer Pete Abbott, the Decca releases lacked the aural brilliance of the Capitol albums, <b>and</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the four sold especially well.|$|E
