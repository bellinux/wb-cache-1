50|$|By 1981 {{the ground}} effects cars were so {{efficient}} and {{so fast that}} the drivers were suffering from the tremendous g-forces involved in cornering and braking. The FIA banned the moveable skirts fitted {{to the bottom of}} the cars' sidepods that were vital for achieving consistent ground effect and regulated a mandatory ground clearance of 6 cm, in the interests of driver safety, and also in some people's view to aid the big manufacturers Ferrari, Alfa Romeo and particularly Renault. The Brabham team were the first to circumvent the rules using hydropneumatic suspension systems which compressed under <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>loading</b> and lowered the Brabham BT49 onto the track. This had the side effect of rendering the car without any sort of suspension, causing the driver to be buffeted even more than before. However, the performance gains were such that other teams were soon following suit - although most had difficulty in replicating the Brabham system and used a simple switch to lower the car. Chapman had other ideas.|$|E
50|$|In {{structural}} engineering, {{modal analysis}} uses the overall mass and stiffness of a structure {{to find the}} various periods at which it will naturally resonate. These periods of vibration {{are very important to}} note in earthquake engineering, as it is imperative that a building's natural frequency does not match the frequency of expected earthquakes in the region in which the building is to be constructed. If a structure's natural frequency matches an earthquake's frequency, the structure may continue to resonate and experience structural damage. Modal analysis is also important in structures such as bridges where the engineer should attempt to keep the natural frequencies away from the frequencies of people walking on the bridge. This may not be possible and for this reasons when groups of people are to walk along a bridge, for example a group of soldiers, the recommendation is that they break their step to avoid possibly significant excitation frequencies. Other natural excitation frequencies may exist and may excite a bridge's natural modes. Engineers tend to learn from such examples (at least in the short term) and more modern suspension bridges take account of the potential influence of wind through the shape of the deck, which might be designed in aerodynamic terms to pull the deck down against the support of the structure rather than allow it to lift. Other <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>loading</b> issues are dealt with by minimizing the area of the structure projected to the oncoming wind and to reduce wind generated oscillations of, for example, the hangers in suspension bridges.|$|E
50|$|The 7 post shaker places {{forces on}} a vehicle and records {{the forces that}} the vehicle puts back into the system. The 7 post applies lift, downforce, road {{irregularity}} forces and load transfer due to braking, acceleration and cornering. The vehicle suspension and drivetrain components respond to these forces, chassis and suspension frequency oscillations (under 30 Hz), and tire, engine, transmission and drive axle vibrations at higher frequencies. The forces applied are calculated from {{a model of the}} racetrack, the weight of the car and driver, tire pressure, engine RPM, and driveline RPM. The forces that the testing engineers want are placed on the car through the use of four main hydraulic actuators capable of generating 25 kN of force with a maximum velocity in excess of 1 m/s that act on the tires. While the actuators are capable of producing frequencies as high as 500 Hz, this is not necessary as the elasticity of the rubber and air in the tires will absorb most inputs above 50 Hz. The remaining three posts are known as aeroloader actuators, and are responsible for the sprung mass of the vehicle. The forces that these three actuators represent are inertial loads that come from entering a curve or <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>loading</b> and unloading in the form of downforce or lift from a wing. These forces are small on road cars where speeds are not normally greater than 140 km/h, but are significant on a race car where speeds can exceed 300 km/h.|$|E
