5|$|In 1902, President Roosevelt first greatly {{expanded}} the reserve and then divided the reserve into four separate units, with Shoshone being the largest. Upon {{the creation of}} the U.S. Forest Service in 1905, the reserve was designated a National Forest, but the current wording and title were formulated forty years later in 1945. A remnant of the earliest years of the forest management is the Wapiti Ranger Station which is located west of Cody, Wyoming. The station was built in 1903 and is the oldest surviving ranger station in <b>any</b> <b>national</b> forest, and is now designated a National Historic Landmark.|$|E

5|$|The {{display of}} the Hinomaru at homes and {{businesses}} is also debated in Japanese society. Because {{of the association of}} the Hinomaru with uyoku dantai (right wing) activists, reactionary politics, or hooliganism, some homes and businesses do not fly the flag. There is no requirement to fly the flag on <b>any</b> <b>national</b> holiday or special events. The town of Kanazawa, Ishikawa, has proposed plans in September 2012 to use government funds to buy flags with the purpose of encouraging citizens to fly the flag on national holidays. The Japanese Communist Party is vocally against the flag.|$|E

5|$|About 30% of {{undergraduate}} men and about 40% {{of undergraduate}} women at Duke {{are members of}} fraternities and sororities. Most of the 17 Interfraternity Council recognized fraternity chapters live in sections within the residence halls. Starting in 2012, the nine Panhellenic Association sorority chapters decided to live in houses (clusters of apartments) on Central Campus. Not all sorority members live with their chapters, though, as membership exceeds house space. Eight National Pan-Hellenic Council (historically African American) fraternities and sororities also hold chapters at Duke. In addition, there are seven other fraternities and sororities that {{are a part of}} the Inter-Greek Council, the multicultural Greek umbrella organization. Duke also has Selective Living Groups, or SLGs, on campus for students seeking informal residential communities often built around themes. SLGs are residential groups similar to fraternities or sororities, except they are generally co-ed and unaffiliated with <b>any</b> <b>national</b> organizations. Fraternity chapters and SLGs frequently host social events in their residential sections, which are often open to non-members.|$|E
5|$|According to the Coat of Arms Act, {{everyone}} {{can use the}} Polish flag, especially during national and cultural events, {{as long as it}} is done in a respectful manner. This liberty in the use of national colors is a relative novelty. Until 2004, Polish citizens were only allowed to fly the Polish flag on national holidays. The use of both variants was restricted, but only flying the flag with coat of arms was, from 1955 until 1985, punishable by a fine or arrest for up to one year. After 1985, unauthorized use of <b>any</b> <b>national</b> symbols was an infraction. A possible explanation to such harsh measures was the fact that the officially-promoted holiday of May 1st was separated by only one day from the pre-war (and current) national holiday of Poland, the anniversary of signing of the Constitution of May 3, 1791. While hoisting a flag on May 1 was acceptable, no later than the following day it must have been hidden.|$|E

5|$|In the 2004 U.S. presidential {{election}} campaign, McCain {{was once again}} frequently mentioned for the vice-presidential slot, only this time {{as part of the}} Democratic ticket under nominee John Kerry. McCain said that Kerry had never formally offered him the position and that he would not have accepted it if he had. At the 2004 Republican National Convention, McCain supported Bush for re-election, praising Bush's management of the War on Terror since the September 11 attacks. At the same time, he defended Kerry's Vietnam War record. By August 2004, McCain had the best favorable-to-unfavorable rating (55percent to 19percent) of <b>any</b> <b>national</b> politician; he campaigned for Bush much more than he had four years previously, though the two remained situational allies rather than friends.|$|E
