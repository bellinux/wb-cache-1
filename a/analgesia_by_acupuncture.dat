40|$|Objectives: This study {{aimed to}} assess <b>analgesia</b> {{provided}} <b>by</b> <b>acupuncture,</b> {{alone or in}} combination with pharmacotherapy, to patients presenting to emergency departments with acute low back pain, migraine or ankle sprain. Design: A pragmatic, multicentre, randomised, assessor-blinded, equivalence and non-inferiority trial of analgesia, comparing acupuncture alone, acupuncture plus pharmacotherapy, and pharmacotherapy alone for alleviating pain in the emergency department. Setting, participants: Patients presenting to emergency departments in one of four tertiary hospitals in Melbourne with acute low back pain, migraine, or ankle sprain, and with a pain score on a 10 -point verbal numerical rating scale (VNRS) of at least 4. Main outcome measures: The primary outcome measure was pain at one hour (T 1). Clinically relevant pain relief was defined as achieving a VNRS score below 4, and statistically relevant pain relief as a reduction in VNRS score of greater than 2 units. Results: 1964 patients were assessed between January 2010 and December 2011; 528 patients with acute low back pain (270 patients), migraine (92) or ankle sprain (166) were randomised to acupuncture alone (177 patients), acupuncture plus pharmacotherapy (178) or pharmacotherapy alone (173). Equivalence and non-inferiority of treatment groups was found overall and for the low back pain and ankle sprain groups in both intention-to-treat and per protocol (PP) analyses, except in the PP equivalence testing of the ankle sprain group. 15. 6 % of patients had clinically relevant pain relief and 36. 9 % had statistically relevant pain relief at T 1; there were no between-group differences. Conclusion: The effectiveness of acupuncture in providing acute analgesia for patients with back pain and ankle sprain was comparable with that of pharmacotherapy. Acupuncture is a safe and acceptable form of analgesia, {{but none of the}} examined therapies provided optimal acute analgesia. More effective options are needed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract 】 Objective: To {{investigate}} the possible mechanisms in <b>acupuncture</b> <b>analgesia</b> <b>by</b> interaction of δ-opioid receptor with neurotransmitter transport proteins or the Na+-K+ pump. Methods: Microinjection of respective heterologous cRNA into the Xenopus oocytes {{as a model}} system, and measurement of steady-state currents under two-electrode voltage clamp. Results: The co-expression of the δ-opioid receptor with GAT 1, EAAC 1 or the sodium pump resulted in reducing activity of the respective transporter. Opioid receptor activation affected transporter activity in different ways: 1) GAT 1 was further inhibited; 2) EAAC 1 was stimulated; 3) Na+-K+ pump activity interfered with agonist sensitivity of DOR. Pump inhibition led to higher sensitivity for DPDPE. Conclusion: GABA transporter inhibition and glutamate transporter stimulation may counteract pain sensation by affecting the neurotransmitter concentration in the synaptic cleft and, therefore, may contribute synergistically to pain suppression <b>by</b> <b>acupuncture.</b> Sodium pump inhibition by endogenous ouabain may amplify these effects. These synergistic effects may be the molecular mechanism of inhibiting pain sens...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Asthma {{has become}} an {{important}} public health issue and approximately 300 million people have suffered from the disease worldwide. Nowadays, the use of acupuncture in asthma is increasing. This study intended to systematically analyze and compare the gene expression profiles between the asthmatic and acupuncture-treated asthmatic rat lung, and tried to gain insight into the molecular mechanism underlying the early airway response (EAR) phase of asthma treated <b>by</b> <b>acupuncture.</b> Methods Four tag libraries of serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) were established from lung tissues of control rats (CK), asthmatic rats (AS), asthmatic rats treated <b>by</b> <b>acupuncture</b> (ASAC), and control rats treated <b>by</b> <b>acupuncture</b> (CKAC). Bioinformatic analyses were carried out by using the methods including unsupervised hierarchical clustering, functional annotation tool of the database for annotation, visualization, and integrated discovery (DAVID), gene ontology (GO) tree machine, and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis. Results There were totally 186 differentially expressed tags (P CK/AS) between the libraries of CK and AS, 130 differentially expressed tags between libraries of AS/ASAC (P AS/ASAC), and 144 differentially expressed tags between libraries of CK/CKAC (P CK/CKAC). The gene expression profiles of AS and ASAC were more similar than other libraries via unsupervised SAGE clustering. By comparison of P CK/AS and P AS/ASAC, the DAVID genes functional classification {{was found to be}} changed from "immune response" to "response to steroid hormone stimulus", and the GO term "antigen processing and presentation of peptide antigen" disappeared in P AS/ASAC. Totally 3 same KEGG pathways were found among the three groups. Moreover, 21 specific tags of the acupuncture in treating asthma were detected using Venn diagrams. Conclusion Our SAGE research indicates that the gene expression profile of the EAR phase of asthma could be effectively and specifically regulated <b>by</b> <b>acupuncture,</b> which suggests that the gene expression of immune response and steroid hormone may {{play an important role in}} the treatment. </p...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} cardiovascular effects and fetal behavior during moxibustion, acupuncture or acupuncture plus moxibustion applied on the BL. 67 acupoint of women (beside the outer corner of the 5 th toenail) in fetal breech presentation. During the acupoint stimulation (20 min, two times a week), the women were submitted to computerized non-stress test. Fourteen cases were treated <b>by</b> both <b>acupuncture</b> and moxibustion, 15 cases by moxibustion and 10 cases <b>by</b> <b>acupuncture.</b> In 56 % of cases, fetal position was converted from breech position to cephalic one; the success share was 80 % for moxibustion, 28 % for acupuncture, 57 % for acupuncture plus moxibustion; the conversion, on average, was achieved after 3 sessions. Statistical analysis indicated that acupuncture plus moxibustion was able to reduce fetal heart rate during the application of stimuli while acupuncture and moxibustion separately did not affect such parameter. Moreover, moxibustion and acupuncture with moxibustion reduced fetal movements while acupuncture only appears ineffective. The present study suggests that fetal movements were reduced <b>by</b> both <b>acupuncture</b> plus moxibustion and moxibustion and that fetal heart rate was reduced just <b>by</b> <b>acupuncture</b> plus moxibustion.

40|$|Acupuncture at {{homotopic}} acupoints or heterotopic acupoints {{is known}} to either inhibit or facilitate gastrointestinal motility, depending on the acupoint location. However, little effort {{has been made to}} investigate the roles of specific receptors (such as adrenergic and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors) in mediating the effects of acupuncture at heterotopic and homotopic acupoints. Different adrenergic receptor subtypes or cholinergic receptor subtypes are predominantly expressed in various sections of the gut, resulting in variations between the effects of acupuncture at heterotopic or homotopic acupoints on gastrointestinal motility. Here, we investigated the role of β 1 /β 2 receptors and M 2 /M 3 receptors in gastrointestinal motility regulated <b>by</b> <b>acupuncture</b> at ST 37, a heterotopic acupoint, and ST 25, a homotopic acupoint, by simultaneously recording intraluminal pressures in the distal colon and stomach or jejunum and examining fecal phenol red excretion in β 1 / 2 receptor-knockout mice and M 2 / 3 receptor-knockout mice. We found that knockout of the M 2 / 3 receptor significantly inhibited ST 37 acupuncture-induced enhancement of gastric motility, jejunal motility, and colonic motility. Additionally, knocking out of the β 1 / 2 receptor significantly diminished the ST 25 acupuncture-induced inhibition of gastric motility and jejunal motility without significantly altering the enhancement of colonic motility induced <b>by</b> <b>acupuncture</b> at ST 25. Acupuncture at ST 37 significantly accelerated gastrointestinal transition in β 1 / 2 receptor-knockout mice and their wild-type littermates. However, this acceleration of gastrointestinal transition was markedly diminished in M 2 / 3 receptor-knockout mice relative to their wild-type littermates. Acupuncture at ST 25 significantly increased gastrointestinal transition in β 1 / 2 receptor-knockout mice and significantly decreased gastrointestinal transition in M 2 / 3 receptor-knockout mice without altering gastrointestinal transition in wild-type littermates of either. Our study revealed that M 2 / 3 receptors are required for the gastrointestinal motility associated with whole gastrointestinal transition enhanced <b>by</b> <b>acupuncture</b> at heterotopic acupoints, whereas β 1 / 2 receptors are required for the same gastrointestinal motility processes inhibited <b>by</b> <b>acupuncture</b> at homotopic acupoints.
