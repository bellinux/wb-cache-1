In my household, I didn't go all of the parties and I didn't {{do all the things}} {{that a lot of the}} other teenage girls did because I was so in love with my radio and my music.

Pryce was put through his paces by Trevor Taylor, an ex-Team Lotus driver and old team mate of Pryce's {{childhood}} hero Clark. He later became {{a star in the}} Formula 5000 series. From there, Pryce went on to compete in the Daily Express Crusader Championship, a series run by Motor Racing Stables for racing school pupils using Lotus 51 Formula Ford cars. Races alternated between the Brands Hatch and Silverstone circuits; Pryce made his début at the former. [...] "The races were £35 a time.

500|$|China, {{and many}} other Asian countries, share {{a long history of}} {{conservative}} and patriarchal view of marriage and the family structure including marrying at a young age and hypergamy. The pressure from society and family has been the source criticism, shame, social embarrassment and social anxiety for many women who are unmarried. Chen, another women interviewed by the BBC, said the sheng nu are [...] "afraid their friends and neighbours will regard me as abnormal. <b>And</b> <b>my</b> <b>parents</b> would also feel they were totally losing face, when their friends all have grandkids already". Similar sentiment has been shared amongst other women in China, particularly amongst recent university graduates. A report by CNN cited a survey of 900 female university graduates across 17 Chinese universities where approximately 70 percent of those surveyed said [...] "their greatest fear is becoming a 3S lady".|$|E
500|$|Abbie Hoffman {{appears as}} a {{commentator}} in the documentary and addresses some points raised in Davis's speech, stating: [...] "It's rather arrogant of Rennie {{to say that he}} has found God and has his Telex number in his wallet." [...] The TVTV crew interviewed different [...] "premies", or followers of Prem Rawat, throughout the film, and one teenage boy is shown stating: [...] "Before I came to the Guru I was a freak, smoking dope and dropping out – <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>parents</b> were happier then than they are with this." [...] In a later part of the film, a loudspeaker voice announces: [...] "Those premies who came in private cars can leave now. Those who came in rented buses can stay and meditate until further notice." [...] Adherents of other belief systems also appear in the documentary, including a born-again Christian who criticizes devotees for [...] "following the devil", and a Hare Krishna follower.|$|E

2500|$|Nobilo {{was born}} in Auckland, of Croatian and Italian descent, and is the great {{grandson}} of an Italian pirate. At birth, his right leg was shorter than his left, which has caused him some back problems throughout his life. He was educated at St Peter's College in Auckland where he was persuaded to play golf by schoolmates (Chris Treen and Mark Lewis). Nobilo preferred to play Rugby League for Glenora over Rugby Union for St Peter's, which was [...] "a bone of contention" [...] with the school. [...] "I got a bit of grief because I preferred league over rugby then and I was {{a bit more of}} a rebel. I used to catch the train to and from school and it took about 30–40 minutes. My mum said it drove her crazy because I missed it often <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>parents</b> were living in Glen Eden and I would end up in Henderson and they'd have to come and collect me".|$|E
2500|$|Most of Michigan Tech's {{incoming}} freshmen for the 2011–12 season {{had been}} recruited and verbally committed during Jamie Russell's tenure. The first was forward Tanner Kero, whose hometown of Hancock, Michigan, is across Portage Lake from Michigan Tech. Kero committed in late 2009 while {{a member of}} the Marquette Rangers of the North American Hockey League (NAHL). He spent the 2010–11 season with the Fargo Force of the United States Hockey League (USHL) and was named to the USHL Western Conference All-Star Team while scoring 37points in 55games. Defenseman Nick Cecere committed to play at Nebraska–Omaha while a member of Northwood School's [...] "Junior Team", but switched to Michigan Tech after a coaching change at Nebraska–Omaha. Explaining why he chose Michigan Tech, Cecere said, [...] "Since I've been in prep school, I'm used to a smaller, close-knit community, and that's what I like. ... I fell in love with , <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>parents</b> did as well". Indiana Ice (USHL) forward David Johnstone, brother of Michigan Tech sophomore forward Jacob Johnstone, committed two months later. Justin Fillion, who was in his third season with the Prince George Spruce Kings of the British Columbia Hockey League (BCHL), also committed in December. He credited his coach, former Michigan Tech player Ed Dempsey, with helping him earn the scholarship that Tech offered. Blake Pietila, a forward with the USA Hockey National Team Development Program, originally committed to Northern Michigan, but switched when his older brother Chad decided to transfer from Northern Michigan to Michigan Tech. Blake was drafted by the New Jersey Devils with the 129th pick of the 2011 NHL Entry Draft, becoming Michigan Tech's first drafted player since Jordan Foote was selected in 2004.|$|E
