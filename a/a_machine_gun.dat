5|$|An autocannon is {{a cannon}} {{with a larger}} caliber than <b>a</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun,</b> but smaller {{than that of a}} field gun. Autocannons have {{mechanisms}} to automatically load their ammunition, and therefore have a faster rate of fire than artillery, often approaching—and, in the case of Gatling guns, surpassing—that of <b>a</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun.</b> The traditional minimum bore for autocannon—indeed, for all types of cannon, as autocannon are the lowest-caliber pieces—has remained 20mm, since World War II.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> light <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> is also {{defined by}} its usage {{as well as}} its specifications: some <b>machine</b> <b>guns</b> - notably {{general-purpose}} <b>machine</b> <b>guns</b> - may be deployed either as <b>a</b> light <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> or <b>a</b> medium <b>machine</b> <b>gun.</b> Deployed on <b>a</b> tripod and used for sustained-fire it is <b>a</b> medium <b>machine</b> gun; if deployed with a bipod with the operator in prone position and firing short bursts it is <b>a</b> light <b>machine</b> <b>gun.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Some support weapons {{can fire}} {{multiple}} times in <b>a</b> phase, and <b>machine</b> <b>guns</b> {{have the ability}} ("penetration") to inflict damage through a line of several adjacent hexes - two hexes for <b>a</b> light <b>machine</b> <b>gun,</b> and six or even eight for <b>a</b> heavy <b>machine</b> <b>gun.</b>|$|R

5|$|Autocannons have an {{automatic}} firing mode, {{similar to that}} of <b>a</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun.</b> They have mechanisms to automatically load their ammunition, and therefore have a higher rate of fire than artillery, often approaching, or, in the case of rotary autocannons, even surpassing the firing rate of <b>a</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun.</b> While there is no minimum bore for autocannons, they are generally larger than machine guns, typically 20mm or greater since World War II and are usually capable of using explosive ammunition even if it isn't always used. Machine guns in contrast are usually too small to use explosive ammunition.|$|E
5|$|One hundred {{twenty four}} people would {{eventually}} receive the Medal {{for their actions}} during the war, seven of them were Jewish.

5|$|Chase {{attended}} <b>a</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> {{course at}} Fort Sill, {{after which he}} was posted to the 11th Machine Gun Battalion, part of the 4th Division, in April 1918. He served on the Western Front with the 4th Division, participating in the Battle of Saint-Mihiel, but came down with jaundice and missed all but {{the last days of}} the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. He participated in the Occupation of the Rhineland before the 4th Division returned to the United States in July 1919.|$|E
50|$|The T17 {{was armed}} with a 37 mm gun in a {{rotating}} turret, <b>a</b> coaxial <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> and <b>a</b> bow <b>machine</b> <b>gun.</b> Power was from two Hercules JXD engines. In the interests of standardization, these replaced Ford's initial 90 hp engines.|$|R

In a scuffle which broke {{out in front of}} the building, Saško Gešovski, a JNA conscript from Macedonia, was killed by a shot fired from the crowd. By the end of the afternoon, the crowd removed the Yugoslav flag from the building, moved away and dispersed.|$|E
5|$|Levels {{consist of}} several missions, {{which are based}} around the {{destruction}} of enemy weapons and installations, as well as rescuing hostages or prisoners of war, or capturing enemy personnel. The Apache is armed with <b>a</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun,</b> more powerful Hydra rockets and yet more deadly Hellfire missiles. The more powerful the weapon, the fewer can be carried: the player must choose an appropriate weapon for each situation. Enemy weapons range from soldiers with small arms, to anti-aircraft missiles to tanks and armoured cars.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant Bourguignon had {{exchanged}} commands with Lieutenant Guiard on 20 March 1940, Guiard taking Bourguignon's former {{position at}} the casemate of Thonne-le-Thil. Bourguignon was assisted by Sub-Lieutenant Thouémont, who commanded Block 2. Thouémont, who had been previously posted to <b>a</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> battalion in the 149th and 132nd RIF, lacked specific training on Maginot systems. He replaced Captain André, a reservist and mayor of Villy, who had been promoted. Bourguignon was responsible for command of Block 1, {{as well as for}} overall command. Compared to similar positions, La Ferté was understaffed with officers.|$|E

5|$|Like {{its parent}} Jeep Wrangler, the Storm {{is first and}} {{foremost}} an airmobile, capable offroad and utility vehicle meant to tackle extreme terrain in a general reconnaissance role, and can be outfitted with <b>a</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> or other weapons systems. When armed with a 105mm (4.1in) M40 recoilless rifle, the vehicle is uniquely capable of firing directly over its blast guard equipped hood rather than in the perpendicular position required by most other vehicles.|$|E
5|$|On 1 December, {{injured by}} bomb wounds {{to his face}} and head, Cherry was {{evacuated}} to Egypt, where he was commissioned as a second lieutenant on 9 December. Three days later, the 26th Battalion was withdrawn from Gallipoli and evacuated to Egypt where Cherry rejoined them in preparation for service on the Western Front. Remaining in Egypt during this time, Cherry was selected to attend <b>a</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> course in March 1916. After completion of this, he was transferred to the 7th Machine Gun Company in France.|$|E
5|$|Soon after, {{the company}} {{came under heavy fire}} {{from an old}} quarry {{occupied}} by over one hundred German soldiers who possessed as many as forty machine guns. Severe casualties were sustained as they began to advance for attack, including the company commander who fell seriously wounded. Taking command of the attack, Ingram rallied the men and rushed forward. Jumping into the quarry, he charged the first post himself, shooting six German soldiers and capturing <b>a</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun.</b> The German forces were soon overcome, and thirty troops subsequently surrendered.|$|E
50|$|The {{intention}} {{behind the}} <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> being {{mounted in the}} forward {{left side of the}} turret is not clearly known, but it may be akin to <b>a</b> coaxial <b>machine</b> <b>gun.</b> <b>A</b> coaxial <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> is placed alongside the main armament on the same axle. With that setup, when using the main cannon, the machine can could help predict where the main cannon`s fire would land or suppress the enemy while loading the main armament. Out of all of the tanks in the army, only tanks like the Type 98 light tank or Type 2 light tank mounted <b>a</b> coaxial <b>machine</b> <b>gun.</b>|$|R
50|$|Colt {{offered the}} CMG-1 in four {{different}} versions: bipod-mounted, tripod-mounted, vehicle-mounted, or fixed mount. The 11.5 lb. bipod-mounted version was marketed as <b>a</b> light <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> {{for use by}} assault troops. It was the only version with a buttstock. The 12.5 lb. tripod-mounted version was considered <b>a</b> medium <b>machine</b> <b>gun.</b> The vehicle mounted version was <b>a</b> pintle-mounted <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> for use by soldiers in land vehicles. The fixed mount version was fired by a solenoid allowing for remote operation {{so it could be}} mounted in a helicopter or other aircraft.|$|R

5|$|To replace these officers, Second Lieutenant Innes of 1 Company {{was ordered}} forward {{to gather the}} {{survivors}} and withdraw, forming up at a barricade {{on the edge of}} the Hollow. Innes regrouped the survivors and, following a heavy bombardment from supporting artillery and with his own company providing covering fire, assisted the Coldstream Guards in a second attack at 10:15. Weighed down with entrenching equipment, the attacking Coldstream Guardsmen faltered and began to suffer heavy casualties. Innes too came under heavy fire from a German barricade to their front equipped with <b>a</b> <b>machine</b> <b>gun.</b>|$|E
