50|$|To {{build the}} pylons, Doka of Austria was {{commissioned}} {{to build a}} custom <b>automatic</b> climbing <b>shutter</b> formwork system, based on their SKE-100 <b>automatic</b> climbing <b>shutter</b> system. This was fabricated on site and employed to execute all tower leg lifts below deck level.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{numerous}} {{technological advancements}} in photography {{over the next}} several decades, Matthews used that big bellows-style camera with glass plate negatives, black hood, and tripod {{for the rest of her}} life. She experimented with cameras that captured snapshots via <b>automatic</b> <b>shutters,</b> but she considered her photography an art and preferred to control light exposure with a lens cap. She also controlled every step of the development process in her own darkroom. She hand-tinted some photographs and frequently gave friends and family signed prints or sent them postcards made from prints.|$|R
5000|$|BS 1363 sockets {{must have}} {{shutters}} on the [...] and neutral contacts {{to prevent the}} insertion of a foreign object into the socket. Many sockets use the original method of shutters opened by the earth pin (or plastic ISOD), longer than the other pins and hence opening the shutters before the other pins engage, alone. Alternatively, shutters may be opened by simultaneous insertion of [...] and neutral pins. Some later designs require all three pins to be inserted simultaneously. The use of <b>automatic</b> <b>shutters</b> for protection dates back to at least 1927. [...] Other countries, for example the USA, are gradually requiring their sockets to be protected by shutters also.|$|R
50|$|A {{standard}} UNC 1/4-20 tripod thread {{is provided}} {{on the bottom}} of the camera body. An electronic self-timer is built in, and a flashing red light-emitting diode (LED) on the front of the camera indicates <b>automatic</b> <b>shutter</b> status. An audio beep can be selectively activated or muted to provide shutter feedback to the user.|$|E
50|$|The Nikkormat ELW, {{manufactured}} from 1976 to 1977, was an EL {{modified to}} accept the Nikon AW-1 autowinder, providing motorized film advance at up to two frames per second. The ELW also expanded the <b>automatic</b> <b>shutter</b> speed range to eight seconds, and its viewfinder was fitted with a new standard focusing screen, the Type K (see the Nikkormat FT2 above).|$|E
50|$|To take a {{dangerous}} photo sequence of a 500 lb. bomb detonating, Hoffman placed his camera {{two and a}} half feet from the center of impact. When the bomb left the plane, he pressed the <b>automatic</b> <b>shutter</b> release and ran. The bomb exploded only 20 feet away from him, and when the dust cleared, he found the bomb had hit precisely where it was supposed to, getting Hoffman accolades for the innovative shots featured in Lifes November 15, 1943 issue.|$|E
50|$|When {{the shutter}} release is pressed the mirror flips {{up against the}} viewing screen, the {{diaphragm}} closes down (if <b>automatic),</b> the <b>shutter</b> opens and closes, the mirror returns to its 45-degree viewing position (on most or all 35 mm SLRs made since 1970) and the automatic diaphragm re-opens to full aperture.|$|R
5000|$|Exposure modes: metered shutter-preferred {{automatic}} exposure, unmetered-manual override and flashmatic modes. When in <b>automatic</b> mode, the <b>shutter</b> {{will not}} fire {{if there is}} insufficient light.|$|R
50|$|Modes include full <b>automatic,</b> {{aperture}} priority, <b>shutter</b> priority, full manual, macro (from 5 centimetres on), film, {{and sequence}} of shots. Film is recorded at 320x240 px resolution in mJPEG format and playable in QuickTime.|$|R
50|$|Lenses for the Mamiya C series {{have been}} grouped by users into three {{different}} series {{based on the}} appearance and model of the shutter: first chrome, second chrome, and black. Most lenses {{can be used on}} most bodies, but some combinations won't allow for <b>automatic</b> <b>shutter</b> cocking. The first chrome series had Seikosha-MX shutters with speeds from 1 s to 1/400 s. The second chrome series had Seikosha-S shutters with speeds from 1 s to 1/500 s, plus Bulb. A few chrome shutter lens had a Seikosha-SLV shutter. The black series had Seiko shutters, except for the 80 mm lens which had a Copal shutter.|$|E
5000|$|In 1966 Asahi Optical showed another {{prototype}} called Metalica, {{sometimes referred}} to as Metallica II. Gone was the cumbersome selenium light meter, replaced with a now standard internal CdS meter. Like the 1960 prototype, the Metalica had a bayonet lens mount, and also featured an improved Copal-square metallic shutter. But the biggest innovation was the fully <b>automatic</b> <b>shutter</b> operation coupled to the TTL meter. The metering system, {{for the first time in}} a 35mm SLR, controlled the shutter speed automatically based on the aperture set. With these innovative developments, the Metalica pioneered features that would not surface on Pentax production cameras until the Electro-Spotmatic (ES) (automatic aperture-priority exposure) in 1971 and K2 (vertical metal shutter, bayonet lens mount, automatic aperture-priority exposure) in 1975.

50|$|There are {{sensors that}} assist in {{autonomous}} navigation. The two cameras inside the head {{are used as}} a visual sensor to detect obstacles. The lower portion of the torso has ground sensor which comprises one laser sensor and one infrared sensor. The laser sensor is used to detect ground surface. The infrared sensor with <b>automatic</b> <b>shutter</b> adjustment based on brightness is used to detect pairs of floor markings to confirm the navigable paths of the planned map. The pre-loaded map and the detection of floor markings help the robot to precisely identify its present location and continuously adjusting its position. There are front and rear ultrasonic sensors to sense the obstacles. The front sensor {{is located at the}} lower portion of the torso together with the ground sensor. The rear sensor is located {{at the bottom of the}} backpack.|$|E
50|$|The fiscal {{horsepower}} {{had been}} dropped to 13.9 from 14.9. To achieve this the engine capacity was trimmed by a reduction of 2.25mm in the bore so that bore and stroke became 61.25 x 102mm giving a cubic capacity of 1803cc. This reduced size six-cylinder engine had a four-bearing crankshaft an air-cleaner-heater and a fume-consumer head. Other standard features now included chrome finished <b>automatic</b> radiator <b>shutters,</b> a four-speed twin-top gearbox, Lockheed hydraulic brakes and a wide 52 inch track.|$|R
50|$|Beginning in 1977 {{with the}} FM, {{there was a}} {{complete}} overhaul of Nippon Kogaku's entire Nikon SLR line. The 1970s and 1980s were an era of intense competition between the major SLR brands: Nikon, Canon, Minolta, Pentax and Olympus. Between circa 1975 to 1985, there was a dramatic shift away from heavy all-metal manual mechanical camera bodies to much more compact bodies with microprocessor electronic automation. In addition, because of rapid advances in electronics, the brands continually leap frogged each other with models having new or more automatic features. The industry was trying to expand out from the saturated high-end professional and advanced amateur market and appeal to the large mass of low-end amateur photographers itching to move up from compact <b>automatic</b> leaf <b>shutter</b> rangefinder (RF) cameras to the more versatile and glamorous SLR but were intimidated by the advanced learning curve required to operate a traditional SLR.|$|R

40|$|Consider {{a static}} scene and fixed center of projection, about which a camera {{is free to}} zoom, pan, tilt, and rotate about its optical axis. With an ideal camera, the {{resulting}} images {{are in the same}} orbit of the projective group-action, and each pixel of each image provides a measurement of a ray of light passing through a common point in space. Unfortunately, most modern cameras have a built in automatic gain control (AGC), <b>automatic</b> <b>shutter,</b> or auto-iris, which, in many cases cannot be turned off. Many modern digitizers to which cameras are connected have their own AGC which also cannot be disabled. With AGC, the characteristic response function of the camera varies, making it impossible to accurately describe one image as a projective coordinate transformed version of another. This paper proposes not only a solution to this problem, but a means of turning AGC into an asset, so that even in cases where AGC could be disabled, pencigraphers of the future will be turning AGC on. 1 INTR [...] ...|$|E

Between circa 1975 to 1985, there was a dramatic shift away from heavy all-metal manual mechanical camera bodies to much more compact camera bodies modularly built with substantial amounts of lightweight plastics. In addition, because of rapid advances in electronics, the brands continually leap frogged each other with models having new or more automatic features.

40|$|Human emotion {{identification}} from image sequences {{is highly}} demanded nowadays. The {{range of possible}} applications can vary from an <b>automatic</b> smile <b>shutter</b> function of consumer grade digital cameras to Biofied Building technologies, which enables communication between building space and residents. The highly perceptual nature of human emotions leads {{to the complexity of}} their classification and identification. The main question arises from the subjective quality of emotional classification of events that elicit human emotions. A variety of methods for formal classification of emotions were developed in musical psychology. This work is focused on identification of human emotions evoked by musical pieces using human face tracking and optical flow analysis. Facial feature tracking algorithm used for facial feature speed and position estimation is presented. Facial features were extracted from each image sequence using human face tracking with local binary patterns (LBP) features. Accurate relative speeds of facial features were estimated using optical flow analysis. Obtained relative positions and speeds were used as the output facial emotion vector. The algorithm was tested using original software and recorded image sequences. The proposed technique proves to give a robust identification of human emotions elicited by musical pieces. The estimated models could be used for human emotion identification from image sequences in such fields as emotion based musical background or mood dependent radio...|$|R
30|$|The {{morphology}} of the ZnO/organic hybrid films was studied using a JEOL-JSM 6300 scanning {{electron microscope}} (SEM) operating at 10 kV. The structural characterization {{was carried out by}} high-resolution X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Rigaku Ultima IV diffractometer in θ- 2 θ mode with a copper anticathode (CuKα, 1.54 Å). Optical transmittance measurements were performed by means of an Ocean Optics DT-MINI- 2 -GS deuterium-halogen lamp in association with a 500 -mm spectrometer coupled to a backthinned CCD detector optimized for the UV-Vis range. To determine the surface topography, an atomic force microscope (AFM) Multimode Veeco was used, where the scanning was carried out in tapping mode using a silicon cantilever. The scanning frequency was set at 0.5 Hz, and the image size was 5 × 5 μm 2. The photoelectrochemical study was performed in a conventional three-electrode arrangement in a glass cell, consisting of the deposited thin film as the working electrode, illuminated from the glass/ITO side, a Pt counter electrode, and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode in 0.1 M KCl electrolyte. The photocurrent was measured using a potentiostat/galvanostat and recorded. The illumination time of the electrode was controlled using an <b>automatic</b> mechanical <b>shutter,</b> with an adjusted illumination time of 10 s, for which a controller box had been designed. The shutter required approximately 10 ms to reach a completely open (or closed) position. All the measurements were performed at 0.05 V bias where the dark current was negligible.|$|R
40|$|International audienceAcquiring High Dynamic Range (HDR) light-fields {{from several}} images with {{different}} exposures (sensor integration periods) {{has been widely}} considered for static camera positions. In this paper a new approach is proposed that enables 3 D HDR environment maps to be acquired directly from a dynamic set of images in real-time. In particular a method will be proposed to use an RGB-D camera as a dynamic light-field sensor, based on a dense real-time 3 D tracking and mapping approach, that avoids {{the need for a}} light-probe or the observation of reflective surfaces. The 6 dof pose and dense scene structure will be estimated simultaneously with the observed dynamic range so as to compute the radiance map of the scene and fuse a stream of low dynamic range images (LDR) into an HDR image.

5000|$|This camera had {{the usual}} Program <b>automatic</b> exposure, <b>Shutter</b> {{priority}} <b>automatic</b> exposure, Aperture priority automatic exposure and metered manual exposure modes (standard on the 7000), TTL autoflash (like the 7000) {{and added a}} newer faster and more sensitive AF system, faster film advance, new flash hot-shoe that was incompatible with the older flash system (although an adapter was available and the 7/8000i supported the x000-era CG-1000 [...] "flash handle" [...] for backwards compatibility). The 7000i supported the Maxxum lens system, and other previously introduced accessories such as the remote cords.Perhaps more innovative and unusual than any other improvement was the expansion card system. While also used in other models in the i-series, some models in the xi-series, and the 700si, the Minolta Creative Expansion Card System debuted on this model. The expansion card system provided a way to add features to the camera, such as multi-spot metering, or re-program the built-in AE modes to favor faster shutter speeds or smaller apertures, such as the sports action card. While most of the cards' functions and effects could be duplicated by a technically knowledgeable photographer using the camera without the expansion cards, the card system was handy for less technically skilled users who just wanted to photograph their child's soccer/football team for example, without needing to learn about exposure settings and the effect they might have on how a picture [...] "looked".

40|$|The goal is {{to provide}} a smooth, {{efficient}} and automatic display for interpretation of medical images by using a new generation of hanging protocols (HPs). HPs refer to a set of rules defining the way images are arranged on the computer screen immediately after opening a case. HPs usually include information regarding placement of the sequences, viewing mode, layout, window width and level (W/L) settings, zoom and pan. We present the results of a survey of 8 radiologists on (1) the necessity of using HPs, (2) the applicability of a hierarchical organization of HPs and (3) the number of HPs required for interpretation. We discuss some limitations and challenges associated with the HP including automatic placement of the series on the screen despite non-standard series labeling, generation of pseudo-series, creation of the “study context ” and identification of relevant priors, and image display standardization with <b>automatic</b> orientation and <b>shuttering.</b> The paper also addresses the HP selection based on the workstation’s hardware such as number and type of monitors, size of the study, and presence of image processing routines tailored to the information needs and level of expertise of particular users. Our “heads-up ” approach is meant to free the user’s conscious processing for reasoning such as detection of patterns so allowing for the execution of the tasks in an efficient, yet highly adaptive manner, sensitive to shifting concepts.
