5|$|However, in a {{long term}} war of attrition, the battle was just one more source of losses to the French when they were losing two men to one.

5|$|Immediately {{following}} their {{declaration of war}} on the Ottoman Empire in November 1914, the British War Cabinet began to consider the future of Palestine. By late 1917, in the lead up to the Balfour Declaration, the wider war had reached a stalemate, with two of Britain's Allies and Associated Powers not fully engaged: the United States had yet to suffer a casualty, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russians</b> were distracted by internal upheaval. A stalemate in southern Palestine was broken by the Battle of Beersheba on 31 October 1917.|$|E
5|$|In December 1804, an Anglo-Swedish {{agreement}} led to {{the creation}} of the Third Coalition.

Mutual suspicion between the British <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russians</b> eased in the face of several French political mistakes and by April 1805 the two had signed a treaty of alliance. Having been defeated twice in recent memory by France and keen on revenge, Austria also joined the coalition a few months later.|$|E
5|$|Other Russian {{forces were}} more {{successful}} {{to the north}} of the town, where they managed to capture the village of Mokre from the 28th Regiment. The regiment counter-charged the village, but was initially driven off. However, approximately 80 pieces of emplaced Polish artillery laid a 30-minute barrage on the village. It was the greatest concentration of artillery fire in the war up to that point, and had a tremendous effect on the morale of the Russian defenders. After the barrage ended Lieutenant Colonel Wiktor Thommée personally led his forces in a bayonet charge; the regiment re-entered Mokre at noon <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russians</b> fled.|$|E

5|$|The {{existence}} of the railway meant that sufficient supplies and armaments had been transported to the plateau for the allies to resume their attack. The Second Bombardment started on April 9 and continued for ten days. Initially, little progress {{seemed to have been}} made because again the Russians were able to repair the damage caused, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russians</b> continued to deliver supplies to Sevastopol from the north. However, they had sustained heavy casualties. Following a period of stalemate, Allied forces cut off one of the main Russian supply lines at Kerch on May 24.|$|E
5|$|The {{surrounded}} {{church was}} well prepared for defence, but its garrison was by then composed {{almost entirely of}} the wounded.

Altogether the Russian side lost no less than 1,000 killed in action during the storming of the fort. Polish casualties did not exceed 300 killed and wounded, with 1,230 soldiers and officers taken prisoner. Only up to 500 soldiers managed to withdraw and reach Polish lines.|$|E
5|$|An enemy scout {{discovered}} Nulli Secunda quietly {{attempting to}} regain control with their Territorial Control Units (TCU).

RAZOR Alliance took the station, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russians</b> destroyed the N3/PL Territorial Control Unit and set up its own TCU {{in order to establish}} control. Capturing the B-R5RB system would enable the CFC and Russian coalition to trap Pandemic Legion assets, including hundreds of capital and sub-capital ships, thus preventing those ships from joining the war. CFC and Russian coalition forces scrambled to gain control of the system, with thousands of players logging on and preparing their fleets.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, Soult led a small force, some 150 musket-men, {{across the river}} Linth—the men held their muskets over their heads and waded across, through water to their chests—and {{protected}} the crossing site {{for the remainder of}} the force. Baron von Hotze, commander of the Austrian force there, advanced on the position near Richterswil to direct its defense, and was killed by a French musket ball. His successor, Franz Petrasch, could not push the French back, and organized a retreat from the region, falling back to St. Gallen and losing another 8,000 men and some guns. By the time Suvorov arrived in St. Gallen in early October, the Austrians <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russians</b> had been pushed out and he was forced to lead his men over the Alps to the Vorarlberg, resulting in additional losses.|$|E
5|$|During her {{short-lived}} presidency, a {{truck with}} nuclear energy goes missing and puts D.C. into lock-down, a scheme devised by {{several members of}} Frank's cabinet and Conway's campaign.

Claire is also faced {{with a series of}} diplomatic crises: Russian soldiers have also taken over an American base, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russians</b> and Chinese are vying for possession of a boat in Antarctica that has a stowaway American working for the Russians. After making a deal with the Chinese, Claire orders for the boat to be destroyed so that neither the Chinese nor the Russians can get what is on board. Around this time, Claire agrees to an open election in Ohio for not only the President, but also the Vice President, in order to avoid a possible Conway-Underwood administration.|$|E
5|$|Finally, at 8:00 am., some of Frederick's army {{emerged from}} the woods, with most of Generalleutnant Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz's cavalry {{and the rest of}} his artillery; a short time later, the rest of the Prussians {{emerged from the}} woods, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russians</b> {{realized}} it was not a scouting party, but the main army. The Prussians stood ranked for battle, which now began in earnest. Finck's artillery park had been in place since dawn and, at 11:30 am, Moller initiated bombardment of the Russian position from the northern and northeastern ends of the Russian line (now the Russian left). In error, the Russian artillery had faced their batteries to the meadows beyond the Mühlberge, not the ravine, and had to be reset. For 30 minutes, the two sides bombarded each other.|$|E

5|$|With the {{resumption}} of hostilities, Napoleon (proclaimed Emperor in 1804) planned an invasion of England, spending {{the better part of}} the next two years (1803–05) on this objective. In December 1804, an Anglo-Swedish agreement led to the creation of the Third Coalition. British Prime Minister William Pitt spent 1804 and 1805 in a flurry of diplomatic activity geared towards forming a new coalition against France and neutralising the threat of invasion. Mutual suspicion between the British <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russians</b> eased in the face of several French political mistakes, and by April 1805, the two had signed a treaty of alliance. Alarmed by Napoleon's consolidation of northern Italy into a kingdom under his rule, and keen on revenge for having been defeated twice in recent memory by France, Austria would join the coalition a few months later.|$|E
5|$|Although it had {{abandoned}} the cause of Poniatowski's reforms, the Familia did not receive the support it expected from the Russians, who continued to press for the dissidents' rights. Meanwhile, some factions now rallied {{under the banner of}} the Bar Confederation, aimed against the dissidents, Poniatowski <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russians.</b> After an unsuccessful attempt to find allies in Western Europe (France, England and Austria), Poniatowski and the Familia {{had no choice but to}} rely more heavily on the Russian Empire, which treated Poland as a protectorate. In the War of the Bar Confederation (1768–1772), Poniatowski supported the Russian army's repression of the Bar Confederation. In 1770, the Council of the Bar Confederation proclaimed him dethroned. The following year, he was kidnapped by Bar Confederate sympathizers and briefly held prisoner outside of Warsaw, but managed to escape. Faced with the weakness of Poland and continuing chaos, Austria, Russia and Prussia decided to intervene militarily, in exchange for significant territorial concessions from the Commonwealth – a decision they made without consulting Poniatowski or other Polish parties.|$|E
5|$|Hotze was sorely missed. Despite mis-communication {{between and}} among the British, the Austrians <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russians,</b> the British miscalculation {{of the size of}} troops (consistently 10–25percent higher than they {{actually}} were), the lack of Swiss volunteers, and failed promises of transport mules, Suvorov organized his impressive march across the Alps from northern Italy, counting on Korsakov and his Austrian allies to hold Zürich. His soldiers took the pass at St. Gotthard in a bayonet charge, and endured incredible hardships navigating the narrow trails of the Alps. By the time the Russian army reached Schwyz, preparing to descend from the mountains into the Zürich plain, Masséna's army already had crushed the incompetent Korsakov's force at Zürich, and, in Hotze's absence, Jean-de-Dieu Soult's French division overwhelmed the Austrian flank at Schänis and crossed the Linth unhindered. When Suvorov cleared the mountains, he had nowhere to go; he was forced to withdraw in another arduous march into the Vorarlberg, where his starving and ragged army arrived in late October. Between Korsakov's inability to hold the French at Zürich, and Hotze's death at Schänis, the Swiss campaign degenerated to an utter shambles.|$|E

5|$|Sea otters {{were once}} {{numerous}} in San Francisco Bay. Historical records revealed the Russian-American Company sneaked Aleuts into San Francisco Bay multiple times, despite the Spanish capturing or shooting them while hunting sea otters in the estuaries of San Jose, San Mateo, San Bruno and around Angel Island. The founder of Fort Ross, Ivan Kuskov, finding otters scarce {{on his second}} voyage to Bodega Bay in 1812, sent a party of Aleuts to San Francisco Bay, where they met another Russian party and an American party, and caught 1,160 sea otters in three months. By 1817, sea otters in the area were practically eliminated <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russians</b> sought permission from the Spanish and the Mexican governments to hunt further and further south of San Francisco. Remnant sea otter populations may have survived in the bay until 1840, when the Rancho Punta de Quentin was granted to Captain John B. R. Cooper, a sea captain from Boston, by Mexican Governor Juan Bautista Alvarado along with a license to hunt sea otters, reportedly then prevalent {{at the mouth of}} Corte Madera Creek.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} {{failed to}} intercept the Russian squadron as it attacked several transports south of Okinoshima Island on 15 June due to heavy rain and fog. The Russians sortied again on 30 June and Kamimura finally {{was able to}} intercept them the next day near Okinoshima. The light was failing when they were spotted <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russians</b> were able to disengage in the darkness. Jessen's ships sortied again on 17 July headed for the eastern coast of Japan {{to act as a}} diversion and pull Japanese forces out of the Sea of Japan and the Yellow Sea. The Russian ships passed through Tsugaru Strait two days later and began capturing ships bound for Japan. The arrival of the Russians off Tokyo Bay on the 24th caused the Naval General Staff to order Kamimura to sail for Cape Toi Misaki, Kyūshū, fearing that Jessen would circumnavigate Japan to reach Port Arthur. Two days later he was ordered north to the Kii Channel and then to Tokyo Bay on the 28th. The General Staff finally ordered him back to Tsushima Island on the 30th; later that day he received word that Jessen's ships had passed through the Tsugaru Strait early that morning and reached Vladivostok on 1 August.|$|E
5|$|The major Russian push came on July 4, after a major {{artillery}} pre-emptive assault. The advancing Russian infantry, numbering around 10,000, faced about 1,000 Polish {{troops in}} the front lines (the rest were held in reserve), but the Russians were stopped by heavy machine gun fire and forced to retreat. The Hungarian forces at Polish Hill were pushed back, however, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Russians</b> advancing on the Poles' right flank, threatened to take the high ground in the area. A counterattack by the Poles was not successful; as the Hungarian units were retreating, the Polish forces sustained very heavy losses and had to fall back either to the remaining {{part of the first}} defense line or, in the area of Polish Hill, to the second line. Another Polish counterattack, launched during the night of July 4/5, was also beaten back. Throughout the day, the Russian offensive managed to push the Polish forces further back; although the Poles managed to temporarily retake Polish Hill, a lack of support from the Hungarian forces once again tipped the battle towards the Russians, and even German reinforcements – deployed after Piłsudski sent a report to the army's headquarters {{about the possibility of a}} Russian breakthrough – failed to turn the tide away. Eventually, on July 6, the Russian offensive forced the Central Powers' armies to retreat along the entire frontline; Polish forces were among the last to retreat, having sustained approximately 2,000 casualties during the battle.|$|E
