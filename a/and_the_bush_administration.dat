25|$|After the {{terrorist}} attacks of September 11, 2001, U.S. government officials questioned the lack of large-scale American democracy promotion mechanisms in the MENA region, viewing democracy as a means of promoting moderation and stability and preventing terrorism. This resulted in a ramping-up of diplomatic rhetoric on the necessity of democratization and political reform in the Middle East and an increase in funding for democracy promotion in the region. Spreading democracy was also one rationalization used by neo-conservatives <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> for undertaking the War in Iraq.|$|E

25|$|The U.S. {{government}} has officially taken a silent policy towards {{the nuclear weapons}} ambitions {{of the state of}} Israel, while being exceedingly vocal against proliferation of such weapons in the countries of Iran and North Korea. Until 2005 when the program was cancelled, it was violating its own non-proliferation treaties in the pursuit of so-called nuclear bunker busters. The 2003 invasion of Iraq by the U.S. was done, in part, on indications that Weapons of Mass Destruction were being stockpiled (lately, stockpiles of previously undeclared nerve agent and mustard gas shells have been located in Iraq), <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> said that its policies on proliferation were responsible for the Libyan government's agreement to abandon its nuclear ambitions.|$|E

40|$|Post-Cold War US nuclear {{policies}} towards India {{witnessed a}} major swing as they developed {{from being a}} demand for the ‘halt, cap, rollback’ during Bill Clinton administration (1993 - 2001) to <b>the</b> signing <b>and</b> implementation of <b>the</b> historic ‘civil nuclear deal’ during <b>the</b> George W. <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> (2001 - 2009). This thesis addresses this change in US nuclear foreign policy by focusing on three core categories of identity, inequality and great power narratives. First, building upon the theoretical paradigm of critical constructivism, the thesis problematises {{the concept of the}} ‘state’ by focusing on identity-related questions arguing that the ‘state’ becomes a constructed entity standing as valid only within relations of identity and difference. Secondly, focusing on postcolonial principles, it argues that imperialism as an organising principle of identity/difference enables us to understand how difference was maintained in unequal terms through US nuclear foreign policy and that foreign policy is manifested in five great power narratives constructed around: peace and justice; India-Pakistan deterrence; democracy; economic progress; and scientific development. Thirdly, identities of ‘race’, ‘political economy’ and ‘gender’, in terms of radical otherness and otherness were recurrently utilised through these narratives to maintain a difference, which enabled <b>the</b> Bill Clinton <b>and</b> <b>the</b> George W. <b>Bush</b> <b>administrations</b> to maintain ‘US’ identity as a progressive and developed western nation, intrinsically justifying the US role as an arbiter of the global nuclear order. The contribution of the thesis: an interdisciplinary perspective on US state identity as connected to the global nuclear order and implications of nuclear policy towards India; a comparative perspective on great power narratives of <b>the</b> Clinton <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administrations</b> that are historically contingent; and methodological insights into temporal and spatial dimensions of textuality through the discourse analysis of primary material...|$|R

2500|$|In 2002, {{reporting}} by Gordon and Judith Miller {{played a key}} role in raising public support for the Iraq War.

Following Miller's later refusal to reveal her source in the [...] "outing" [...] of C.I.A. officer Valerie Plame, the Times reporter spent 85 days in jail and was later released from the newspaper.

2500|$|In September 2007, The Times-Picayune {{reported}} that Vitter <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> opposed a provision of The Gulf Coast Housing Recovery bill which required that every public housing apartment torn down {{be replaced with}} another form of low-income housing on a one-for-one basis.

Vitter stated it would recreate [...] "housing projects exactly as they were", isolated and riddled with crime. However, Mary Landrieu, the Louisiana Democratic Senator, said the intent was to make certain there were affordable places for working-class people who returned. The bill requires that demolished housing projects be replaced with mixed income communities which local housing advocates say is different from the massive public housing developments that Vitter is referring to. However, the bill does not include a ban on large-scale projects. The city housing authority is planning on replacing 4,000 low-income units with mixed-income projects providing a smaller inventory of low-income units.
