[...] "I was singing the line, 'Don't let the bastards drag you down,' feeling determined rather than angry. Before we started, Rab [...] said, 'What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> this U2 cover?' I said, 'Ach, it'll be easy: just make it sound bigger than U2'." ...|$|E

I 've told all I know, and can't make up any more," [...] {{answered}} Polly, leaning {{her head on}} her hand with a sorrowful look that Tom had never seen before. He watched her a minute, and then asked, curiously, [...] "What <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about,</b> just now, when you sat staring at the fire, and getting soberer and soberer every minute? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] said Mabel, [...] "now you're very nice! But let's <b>be</b> frank. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> another drama, in real life, {{that touches}} you close. I see one comfort; there's no Lady Macbeth in the piece." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Why don't {{you speak}} out?" [...] he said. [...] "Have I ever taught you to conceal your thoughts?

6000|$|Ferko wandered {{out into}} the fields again, {{and sat down on}} the stump of a tree {{wondering}} what he should do next. Suddenly a big wolf ran up to him, and standing still said, 'I'm very glad to see you again, my kind benefactor. What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> all alone by yourself? If I can help you in any way only say the word, for I would like to give you a proof of my gratitude.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It is {{very good}} of you to come," [...] she said; [...] "very good indeed. You won't find it dull, I hope, because I know <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> the same thing as these children." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes it is; and I want to know. I'll bet it's {{some other}} girl <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about.</b> All right. Why don't you go get her {{if you want}} her? Take your arm away, if you please." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Shut up, Tom Jackson. What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about?</b> This is no {{time for}} howling like a baby; you have got to think of what is best to do. It is no use {{climbing}} the next hill, for we might be going away from home, instead of getting nearer. Besides, we should have to haul Jimmy up, for he can scarcely stand now; and, although it is bitterly cold here, it would be worse {{on the top of the}} hill. No, we have got to step here all night, that is clear." ...|$|E
6000|$|She stamped {{her foot}} in the bitter anguish of her heart. [...] "I told you," [...] she said, [...] "that there must be no more of that.

Oh, John," [...] she wailed out, [...] "why did you not let me die? Why did we not both die? We should have been happy now, or--asleep.

40|$|This note investigates Schkade and Kahneman’s (1998) maxim that “Nothing in life {{is quite}} as {{important}} as <b>you</b> think it <b>is</b> while <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> it”. The paper shows that whilst becoming unemployed hurts psychologically, unemployment has {{a greater impact on}} happiness if the person also regards it as an important event {{that took place in the}} last year. This finding, particularly if it is replicated for other domains, such as health and income, will have important implications for how we think about the impact of objective circumstances on well-being and about well-being more generally. Key words: happiness; well-being; attention; focusing illusion; unemploymen...|$|R

5000|$|Nancy {{chose the}} album title track [...] "Betfakkar Fi Eih" [...] (What <b>Are</b> <b>You</b> <b>Thinking</b> <b>About)</b> because its meaning {{described}} {{the change in}} the album. The first preview of the album was from the hit [...] "Meen Ghairy Ana" [...] in Nancy's three part Coke commercial, which served as a very successful promotion 5 months before release. Even though [...] "Meen Ghairy Ana" [...] is {{considered by many to be}} the smash hit of the album, the choice of the lead single was to be the album title track as usual, which did not satisfy all critics. Along with the album's release came a high-budget video for Betfakkar Fi Eih with hi-tech effects that marked a first in the Arab world.|$|E

[...] "Confess, Mr. Dishart, {{that this is the}} exact height of what <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about.</b> See, Nanny, he is blushing as if I meant that he had been <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> me.

5000|$|It soon becomes apparent, however, {{that the}} woman cannot free her head from the sculpture, and seeing that the man is unable to release her, Sir Basil and the narrator make their {{way down to the}} garden; they find that the two figures are Lady Turton and Major Haddock. As her ladyship angrily berates her husband, Sir Basil tells Jelks to fetch a saw so that he can cut her out of the piece. When the butler returns with a saw in one hand and an axe in the other and offers the {{implements}} to his employer, the narrator notices that the hand holding the axe is extended out further toward Sir Basil, as though Jelks is trying to coax him into using it instead of the saw. Sir Basil takes the axe. The narrator closes his eyes in anticipation of what is about to befall the terrified Lady Turton when he hears Sir Basil say, [...] "Look here, Jelks. What on earth <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about?</b> This thing's much too dangerous. Give me the saw." [...] The narrator looks at Lady Turton, who is pale-faced and gurgling incoherently with fear, and then at Sir Basil, who for the first time has the traces of a smile in his eyes.|$|E
5000|$|Students need {{something}} complex that challenges them to explore: Students need {{to engage with}} the phenomena of study, not schematic substitutes. It is in struggling with complex problems that every learner undergoes the process of constructing their own knowledge. As learners experience internal cognitive conflicts in what they believe about the subject matter, their minds become more deeply engaged with the problem at hand. Learners' efforts in figuring out questions and puzzles are more productive than knowing the right answer because higher order thinking processes are involved. Therefore, teachers of critical exploration value the diverse efforts that students make during their explorations even where these efforts do not arrive at expected answers. In facilitating this investigative work, the questions that are asked {{over and over again}} by students and teachers alike are, for example: [...] "What do you notice?" [...] What do you mean?" [...] "How <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> it?" [...] "Why do you think that?" [...] "Is that the same as what (someone else) thought they saw?" [...] "How did you figure that?" [...] "How did you do that?" [...] "How does that fit with what she just said?" [...] "Could you give an example?" [...] The responses that teachers and students give to each other might have the form of: [...] "I don't quite get it." [...] "It doesn't make sense (to me)." [...] "I don't really get that; could you explain it another way?" [...] Hence, most important: It is the students who make sense and understand by trying out their ideas, explaining them to others, and seeing how this holds up in other people's and their own eyes and {{in the light of the}} phenomena itself (Duckworth, 2002).|$|E
