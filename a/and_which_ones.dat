So I remember sitting at the piano while writing the song thinking that if Carrie really wanted something dark, this was what she was after. Carrie really got into the story and making sure we didn't give away how the two women {{got rid of the}} man the song is about. This kind of song is really tricky because you need enough detail to tell the story and keep it interesting without it becoming so graphic that it's unpleasant to listen to more than once. I think we managed to pull that off. Either way, it was certainly fun choosing which elements of the story to put in <b>and</b> <b>which</b> <b>ones</b> to leave out.|$|E

25|$|The {{ultimate}} goal of the Abhidharma is Nirvana and hence the Abhidharmikas systematized dharmas into those which are skillful (kusala), purify the mind and lead to liberation, and those which are unskillful and do not. The Abhidharma then has a soteriological purpose, first and foremost and its goal is to support Buddhist practice and meditation. By carefully watching the coming and going of dhammas, {{and being able to}} identify which ones are wholesome and to be cultivated, <b>and</b> <b>which</b> <b>ones</b> are unwholesome and to be abandoned, the Buddhist meditator makes use of the Abhidharma as a schema to liberate his mind and realize that all experiences are impermanent, not-self, unsatisfactory and therefore not to be clung to.|$|E

On healthcare, Alpert {{revealed that}} he supports a single-payer system. Blumenthal explained that pool-purchasing powers should be explored.

Alpert expressed that, being a former peacekeeper in Bosnia, he understands what policies work <b>and</b> <b>which</b> <b>ones</b> do not. The current one does not. Alpert set out {{a plan for the}} withdrawal of troops from the current war in Afghanistan. On a question concerning relations with Cuba, Blumenthal explained that it would take time, and that he would put together a panel of Cuban-American people to decide the best course of action.

25|$|The {{earliest}} {{evidence for}} these statistics learning abilities {{comes from a}} study by Jenny Saffran, Richard Aslin, and Elissa Newport, in which 8-month-old infants were presented with nonsense streams of monotone speech. Each stream was composed of four three-syllable “pseudowords” that were repeated randomly. After exposure to the speech streams for two minutes, infants reacted differently to hearing “pseudowords” as opposed to “nonwords” from the speech stream, where nonwords were composed of the same syllables that the infants had been exposed to, but in a different order. This suggests that infants are able to learn statistical relationships between syllables even with very limited exposure to a language. That is, infants learn which syllables are always paired together <b>and</b> <b>which</b> <b>ones</b> only occur together relatively rarely, suggesting that they are parts of two different units. This method of learning {{is thought to be}} one way that children learn which groups of syllables form individual words.|$|E

The show is a combination of performance clips from the tour, as well as backstage moments. I Am... World Tour also serves as the directorial debut for Beyoncé. On this occasion, she confessed that {{it was a lot of}} work for her. Nevertheless, she was very happy and eager for her fans to see her DVD directed by herself. She explained, [...] "I'm so excited – this is my directorial debut. I am just thrilled that my fans are going to be in the theatre with me and I can't wait for everyone to see it. It took me nine months to edit because I wanted to show a little bit of each show, each performance on tour, and it was 116 shows, so you can only imagine how much work it was, [...] it was worth it." [...] At the New York City screening of the DVD, Beyoncé further explained that she was completely [...] "hands-on", deciding which moments made the final cut <b>and</b> <b>which</b> <b>ones</b> wound up on the cutting-room floor, stating, [...] "It was hard work. I learned so much. I have a new respect for directors and I think I would like to do more of it." [...] Some of the behind-the-scenes footage were shot by Beyoncé on her laptop. The DVD captures concert footage from cities in Europe, Asia, South America, and the United States, all edited into one concert. However, I Am... World Tour was significantly recorded at London's larger O2 Arena, a few months after the I Am... Yours concert. A live CD of the concert, a behind-the-scenes documentary of her life along the tour and a 20-page book of exclusive photos are all included in the package.

2500|$|Although {{resulting}} trusts {{are generally}} thought {{to respond to}} an absence of an intention to benefit another person when property is transferred, and the growing view is that underlying this is a desire to prevent unjust enrichment, there is less agreement about [...] "constructive trusts". At least since 1677, constructive trusts have been recognised in English courts in about seven to twelve circumstances (depending on how the counting and categorisation is done). Because constructive trusts were developed by the Court of Chancery, it was historically said that a trust was [...] "construed" [...] or imposed by the court on someone who acquired property, whenever good conscience required it. In the US case, Beatty v Guggenheim Exploration Co, Cardozo J remarked that the [...] "constructive trust is the formula through which the conscience of equity finds expression. When property has been acquired in such circumstances that the holder of the legal title may not in good conscience retain the beneficial interest, equity converts him into a trustee." [...] However, this did not say what underlay the seemingly different situations where constructive trusts were found. In Canada, the Supreme Court at one point held that all constructive trusts responded to someone being [...] "unjustly enriched" [...] by coming to hold another person's property, but it later changed its mind, given that property could come to be held when it was unfair to keep through other means, particularly a wrong or through an incomplete consensual obligation. It is generally accepted that constructive trusts have been created for reasons, and so the more recent debate has therefore turned on which constructive trusts {{should be considered as}} arising to perfect a consent based obligation (like a contract), which ones arise in response to wrongdoing (like a tort) <b>and</b> <b>which</b> <b>ones</b> (if any) arise in response to unjust enrichment, or some other reasons. Consents, wrongs, unjust enrichments, and miscellaneous other reasons are usually seen as being at least three of the main categories of [...] "event" [...] that give rise to obligations in English law, and constructive trusts may straddle all of them.|$|E
