5|$|Following his assassination, many {{associates}} of Elagabalus {{were killed or}} deposed, including his lover Hierocles.

50|$|The United Kingdom {{has three}} legal systems, {{each of which}} applies to a {{particular}} geographical area.

5|$|Justice Phang {{also held}} that section 5(3) of the Land Acquisition Act was not {{necessarily}} determinative of the matter in the Collector's favour, as acquisitions can be challenged for having been made in bad faith.

5|$|Often, {{teams will}} finish a season with {{identical}} records. It becomes necessary, therefore, to devise means to break these ties, either {{to determine which}} teams will qualify for the playoffs, or to determine seeding in the playoff tournament. The rules below are <b>applied</b> <b>in</b> order until the tie is broken. If three teams are tied for one playoff spot and the third team is eliminated at any step, the tie breaker reverts to step one for the remaining two teams. If multiple playoff spots are at stake, the rules are <b>applied</b> <b>in</b> order until the first team qualifies, then the process is started again for the remaining teams.|$|E
5|$|Once a turn is established, {{the torque}} {{that must be}} applied to the {{steering}} mechanism in order to maintain a constant radius at a constant forward speed depends on the forward speed and the geometry and mass distribution of the bike. At speeds below the capsize speed, described below in the section on Eigenvalues and also called the inversion speed, the self-stability of the bike will cause it to tend to steer into the turn, righting itself and exiting the turn, unless a torque is <b>applied</b> <b>in</b> the opposite direction of the turn. At speeds above the capsize speed, the capsize instability will cause it to tend to steer out of the turn, increasing the lean, unless a torque is <b>applied</b> <b>in</b> the direction of the turn. At the capsize speed no input steering torque is necessary to maintain the steady-state turn.|$|E

5|$|Owing {{to their}} ability to fix {{molecular}} nitrogen and therefore increase the soil fertility and stimulate plant growth, Azotobacter species are widely used in agriculture, particularly in nitrogen biofertilizers such as azotobacterin.
