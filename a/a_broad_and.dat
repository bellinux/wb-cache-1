5|$|In 1986 Voyager 2 {{detected}} <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> <b>and</b> faint {{sheet of}} material inward of ring 6. This ring {{was given the}} temporary designation 1986U2R. It had a normal optical depth of 10−3 or less and was extremely faint. It was visible only in a single Voyager 2 image. The ring was located between 37,000 and 39,500km from the centre of Uranus, or only about 12,000km above the clouds. It was not observed again until 2003–2004, when the Keck telescope found <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> <b>and</b> faint sheet of material just inside ring 6. This ring was dubbed the ζ ring. However, {{the position of the}} recovered ζ ring differs significantly from that observed in 1986. Now it is situated between 37,850 and 41,350km from the centre of the planet. There is an inward gradually fading extension reaching to at least 32,600km, or possibly even to 27,000km—to the atmosphere of Uranus. These extensions are labelled as the ζc and ζcc rings respectively.|$|E

This species is viviparous with a three-year reproductive cycle; females bear litters of 314 young after a gestation period of 2224 months, after {{which there is}} a year of rest before they become pregnant again. Females are capable of storing sperm for long periods, as their encounters with suitable mates may be few and far between due to their nomadic lifestyle and low overall abundance. Dusky sharks are one of the slowest-growing and latest-maturing sharks, not reaching adulthood until around 20 years of age.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} May 2013, <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> <b>and</b> diffuse {{cyclonic}} disturbance {{developed over}} eastern Mexico and northern Central America, incorporating the remnants of easternPacific Hurricane Barbara. As a tropical wave approached from the east, an inverted trough developed on {{the northern edge of}} the active region on June2, setting the stage for the formation of a weak surface low pressure system over the southern Gulf of Mexico the next day. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring the system in their Tropical Weather Outlooks, bulletins issued every six hours regarding the probability of tropical cyclone formation within 48hours. A nearby upper trough created unfavorable conditions for tropical cyclogenesis, subjecting the low to wind shear and abundant dry air that kept it indistinct and disorganized. On June5, the environment became less hostile, and the system began to improve in structure.|$|E

5|$|In early March 2002, {{tropical}} {{activity was}} minimal {{in the southern}} Indian Ocean, limited to an area of convection, or thunderstorms, located southwest of Diego Garcia along the monsoon. On March4, <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> <b>and</b> elongated low pressure area developed within the system, although moderate wind shear in the region initially prevented significant development. The next day, the circulation became better defined, and after being nearly stationary for a few days, it began moving steadily to the west-southwest, due to a ridge to the southeast. On March5, Météo-France (MFR) classified {{the system as a}} tropical disturbance, and later Tropical Depression 11. At 0000UTC on March6, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) initiated advisories on Tropical Cyclone 18S, and six hours later MFR upgraded the system to Moderate Tropical Storm Hary.|$|E

These include <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> <b>and</b> high, sometimes depressed nasal bridge (top of the nose, between the eyes) and a flattened nasal tip. This can give the nose a shortened, arch-like appearance. Hypertelorism (unusually wide-set eyes), prominent frontal bones and supraorbital ridge (the eyebrow ridge), bilateral epicanthic folds (an extra flap of skin over the eyelids), a broad forehead and an overall enlarged head circumference have also been observed. A bulging of the upper lip with an exaggerated cupid's bow shape, and maxillary hypoplasia (underdevelopment of the upper jaw) with retraction have also been reported.|$|E
5|$|The {{first and}} largest glacier was the Sherwin or Pre-Tahoe glacier, which eroded the upper Merced {{watershed}} {{to an extent}} close to its present form. Three stages followed during the Wisconsinian glaciation; these were the Tahoe, Tenaya and Tioga stages, of which the Tioga was the smallest. The Tioga glacier left {{at the mouth of}} Yosemite Valley a rocky moraine. This moraine was actually one of several moraines deposited by the four glaciations, which include Medial Moraine and Bridalveil Moraine. After the Tioga Glacier retreated this moraine formed a lake that flooded nearly the entire valley. Gradual sedimentation filled Lake Yosemite, creating <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> <b>and</b> flat valley floor. Sediments of glacial origin continued to travel down the Merced River following then, helping to form the flat floor of the Central Valley.|$|E

5|$|After peak intensity, Gloria {{weakened}} while {{turning to}} the north, moving around {{the western end of}} the ridge, toward a cold front. By September 26, the winds had decreased to 90 mph (150 km/h), just 30 hours after its peak intensity. Later that day, a buoy about 60 mi (100 km) east of the center recorded a wave height of 46.9 ft (14.3 m), which at the time was the highest buoy wave recording in an Atlantic hurricane. While accelerating toward North Carolina, Gloria re-intensified slightly to winds of 105 mph (165 km/h), making it a Category 2 hurricane. At 0530 UTC on September 27, the hurricane struck southern Hatteras Island in the Outer Banks. After weakening further, Gloria passed just east of the Delmarva Peninsula and New Jersey and interacted with a cold front. Its strongest winds remained on {{the eastern edge of the}} circulation, and the storm was gradually losing tropical characteristics. At 1600 UTC on September 27, the hurricane made landfall with <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> <b>and</b> poorly defined center between John F. Kennedy International Airport and Islip, New York, with winds of 85 mph (140 km/h) on western Long Island. This was only about three days after Henri struck the same general area as a much weaker tropical storm.|$|E
5|$|In the Malaysian case Tan Tek Seng v. Suruhanjaya Perkhidmatan Pendidikan (1996), the {{appellant}} had appealed {{against his}} wrongful dismissal from employment {{on the grounds}} of procedural unfairness. One of the issues brought up was whether an unfair procedure meant that he had been deprived of his constitutional right to life or liberty protected by Article 5(1) of the Malaysian Constitution, which is identical to Singapore's Article 9(1). Judge of the Court of Appeal Gopal Sri Ram held that the courts should take into consideration the unique characteristics and situation of the country, and must not be blind to the realities of life. He went on to suggest that a liberal approach be adopted to grasp the intention of the framers of the Constitution by giving life <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> <b>and</b> liberal meaning. He opined that such an interpretation would include elements that form the quality of life, namely the right to seek and be engaged in lawful and gainful employment, and the right to live in a reasonably healthy and pollution-free environment. He also noted that life cannot be extinguished or taken away except according to procedure established by law.|$|E
5|$|Located to the {{southeast}} of <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> <b>and</b> deep tropospheric trough and {{to the west of}} a low to mid-level ridge, Omar took a counter-clockwise turn on October14. Upon becoming a tropical storm, Omar began to undergo an extended period of rapid intensification as very deep convection developed around the center of circulation. Wind shear around the storm, which was previously inhibiting quick development, weakened, allowing for further strengthening. Later that day, an 11.5 to 17.2mi (18.5 to 27.7km) wide eye formed as the storm began to turn towards the northeast due to the trough. With the formation of an eye, the Dvorak technique rendered an intensity of 75mph (120km/h), signifying that Omar had intensified into a hurricane. The intensification briefly stalled as the eyewall eroded and the center of the storm became slightly elliptical. However, deep convection persisted and strengthening was forecast as the storm neared Puerto Rico. Shortly after, the eye quickly became well-defined and appeared on visible satellite images, an indication the storm was intensifying. The chances of rapid intensification were good as the storm featured well-developed outflow and prominent banding features.|$|E

5|$|The {{hurricane}} originated {{over the}} southwestern Caribbean Sea, where, on October 17, <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> <b>and</b> immature low pressure system was noted. The hurricane forecast center in Jacksonville, Florida issued its first advisory on the storm late on October 20, following ship reports of winds approaching and exceeding gale-force. Contemporary reanalyses {{of the storm}} have determined that it organized into a tropical depression on October 18, then drifted toward the east, turning north-northeastward as it strengthened into a tropical storm early the next day. Due to low environmental air pressures and the large size of the cyclone, intensification was gradual as the storm approached Jamaica, eventually making landfall {{on the eastern side}} of the island, just west of the Morant Point Lighthouse, at 13:00 UTC on October 21. The system came ashore with a central pressure of , suggesting maximum winds of 60 mph (100 km/h). After emerging into the waters between Jamaica and Cuba, the storm slowed in forward speed, continued to intensify, and curved northwestward toward southeastern Cuba. The storm attained the equivalent of Category 1 hurricane status on the current-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale early on October 22, while meandering just off the coast of Cuba.|$|E
