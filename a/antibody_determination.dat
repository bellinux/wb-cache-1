50|$|Liver kidney microsomal type 1 {{antibody}} is an autoantibody {{associated with}} autoimmune hepatitis. It {{is one of}} the several subtypes of anti-liver-kidney microsome antibodies that are known. LKM-1 antibodies associated with autoimmune chronic active hepatitis recognize P450 2D6, a cytochrome P450 mono-oxygenase. The frequent association of anti-LKM-1 antibodies and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections and the probable existence of an infectious and autoimmune form of anti-LKM-1-associated hepatitis, requiring different therapeutical strategies, necessitates the exact determination of anti-LKM-1 specificities. Therefore, we compared various antibody tests (immunofluorescence, ELISA with recombinant P450 2D6, and Western blot with recombinant and natural antigens and agargel double diffusion) with sera of 27 anti-LKM-1-positive chronic active hepatitis (CAH) patients, with 61 sera harbouring anti-mitochondrial antibodies, 100 sera each from HCV-RNA-positive and HCV-RNA-negative patients, and 50 sera of healthy persons. Western blot techniques using recombinant MS2-polymerase P450 2D6 fusion protein were found to be the most sensitive and specific method for anti-LKM-1 <b>antibody</b> <b>determination</b> in routine laboratory. The recently recognized association of anti-LKM-1 antibody and HCV infection was confirmed by the results of this study. In anti-HCV and HCV-RNA-positive patients with anti-LKM-1 antibodies there was a preponderance of males with higher mean age and lower antibody titres. The results support the hypothesis of the existence of an autoimmune as well as an infectious (HCV triggered) subgroup of anti-LKM-1-positive hepatitis.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{efficiency}} of different methods applied for the diagnostics of brucellosis. Huddlson and Wright reactions, RoseBengal test, ELISA-based test system (IgG determination), and a test for antigen-binding lymphocytes (ABL) were used. There was shown that the specificity of tests was identical for either reactions based on detection of antibodies with commercial immune reagents and ELISA IgG. The sensitivity of ABL test is, however, superior to all the reactions based on <b>antibody</b> <b>determination.</b> The ABL test has advantages when compared with antibody detection techniques. This method permits early monitoring of brucellosis treatment/its efficiency since early terms, as well as differentiation between positive and false positive results of <b>antibody</b> <b>determination</b> in pregnant womеn. </p...|$|E
40|$|Fifty-five {{children}} with cholestatic cirrhosis due to extrahepatic biliary atresia received {{a course of}} hepatitis B vaccine. Forty-seven received a plasma-derived vaccine and eight a recombinant vaccine. <b>Antibody</b> <b>determination</b> was evaluated before and after liver transplantation in 30 patients. Twenty-five additional patients had <b>antibody</b> <b>determination</b> after transplantation only. Protection against hepatitis B was observed in 73. 3 % of the children evaluated prior to transplantation. One to 15 months after transplantation, 54. 6 % of all children studied showed protective levels of anti HBs. We conclude that hepatitis B vaccination is efficient in inducing immunity {{in the majority of}} {{children with}} cholestatic cirrhosis. Some patients will loose immunity under immunosuppression, but the protection rate remains higher than reported for patients vaccinated after transplantation...|$|E

40|$|We have {{compared}} murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) <b>antibody</b> <b>determination</b> by {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA) and indirect immunofluorescence assay. A comparison of antibody detection with 146 serum samples at a 1 : 20 dilution showed 100 % agreement (60 negatives and 86 positives) between the assays. There was close agreement of endpoint determinations of sera by both methods. After experimental MCMV infection, antibody to MCMV was detected by both assays as early as day 7, and high titers persisted as late as 6 months. In contrast to immunocompetent littermates, athymic nude mice did not develop antibody after infection. Mice lacking antibody detectable by ELISA were susceptible to lethal MCMV challenge. In a survey of animals from five commercial sources, MCMV antibody was not detected unless mice were experimentally infected. MCMV <b>antibody</b> <b>determination</b> by ELISA is a convenient method, comparable to the indirect immunofluorescence assay in sensitivity and specificity...|$|E

40|$|Summary: Fourteen {{laboratories}} {{participated in}} an exteraal quality control survey (EQCS) for antithyroglo-bulin- and antirnicrosomal-antibody determination. Seventeen frozen serum samples from individuals suffer-ing from various thyroid diseases were dispatched by mail. Different test Systems were used by the participants including the haemagglutination test, radioimmunoassay (RIA), enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) and immu-nofluorescence test. The different test results of each participant were sized and could be compared by giving place numbers to each test result. Inter-laboratory quality control was performed by evaluation of a rank correlation coefficient. There was close agreement between the haemagglutination test results of antimicroso-mal <b>antibody</b> <b>determination</b> with different test kits, and these tests showed good precision. Antithyroglobulin antibody titers from the two haemagglutination test-kits used, however, were not directly comparable. When sized by place numbers, antithyroglobulin antibody results from haemagglutination test, RIA and ELISA were in close agreement. The least correspondence was shown by the immunofluorescence test, in the antithy-roglobulin <b>antibody</b> <b>determination.</b> This EQCS demonstrates'the necessity of international standardisation {{and the use of}} test Systems which allow quantitative determination of antithyroglobulin- and antimicrosomal-antibody.

40|$|Nonspecific inhibitors of rubella {{hemagglutination}} can {{be removed}} by treatment of sera with heparin-manganous chloride {{for use in the}} hemagglutination-inhibition test. After removal of nonspecific inhibitors by this procedure, an excess of manganous chloride may remain. This may cause the cells to agglutinate, thus obscuring the reading at low serum dilutions. This disadvantage can be overcome by the addition of sodium carbonate, which forms an insoluble compound with manganous chloride and does not interfere with <b>antibody</b> <b>determination.</b> The procedure presents a further refinement of the hemagglutination inhibition test for rubella by increasing specificity and sensitivity; it permits detection of antibody levels as low as 1 : 4 in sera...|$|E

A highly significant correlation (p less than 0. 0001) was found between enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay antibody titers and antigen-binding capacity in a previously described radioimmunoassay. Utilizing an isotype-specific anti-immunoglobulin reagent and immunoabsorbent-purified antibody to group A streptococcal cell wall carbohydrate antigen, we were able to detect nanogram quantities of antibody by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique.
