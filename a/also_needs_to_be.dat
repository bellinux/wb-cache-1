Amitriptyline is a popular off-label treatment for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), although it is most frequently reserved for severe cases of abdominal pain in patients with IBS because {{it needs to be}} taken regularly to work and has a generally poor tolerability profile, although a firm evidence base supports its efficacy in this indication. Amitriptyline can also be used as an anticholinergic drug in the treatment of early-stage Parkinson's disease if depression <b>also</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> treated.

In particular, if a son were to be adopted then the adoptive father or mother must not have a legitimate or adopted son still living in the house.|$|E
500|$|The {{organism}} separates itself {{socially and}} spatially with roosts. A colony has several roosts, {{with most of}} the populations centered in one large roost and several fringe roosts which other bat species may share. These are useful for sharing information between colonies. These roosts however can communicate disease and parasites. The individuals often fly from one roost to another to exchange information, and this also creates a pathway for infection. For reasons uncertain, such as being perhaps too advantageous to the colony, they continue to roost within these trees despite the disadvantages to themselves. [...] It would be beneficial to the conservation of the species to locate the trees with roosts that have high levels of disease/ parasite infections in addition to high rates of transfers between roosts and cut them down to lessen the rate of infection among them. The functions of each roost <b>also</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> identified, as to understand which roosts would be better left intact. [...] However, only day roosts studies were performed, and further research into their nocturnal habits may be required.|$|E

500|$|Orban {{told the}} Committee that the {{multilingual}} {{dimension of the}} EU must be made mainstream in all relevant EU policies and programmes {{and should not be}} seen as a separate, isolated policy. He stated that, [...] "Politically, I will steer the Commission's work on bringing an active multilingualism policy into a variety of policies which are the key to the functioning of the EU and the internal market: culture, education and competitiveness." [...] In addition, he claimed that multilingualism would be commercially advantageous as, [...] "At first sight, one single language might appear easier to manage [...] multilingualism can also give any industry a competitive advantage if it helps them to tap local markets and create new products which also cater for multilingualism." [...] According to Orban, multilingualism promotes labour mobility, tolerance and a sense of European citizenship and, as an integral aspect of the legitimacy, transparency and democracy of the European integration, it contributes to a successful EU communication policy. Within the Lisbon strategy, the target for foreign language learning is “mother tongue plus two,” which means that English language skills on their own are not sufficient. To address this, Orban aims to improve language teaching and to make the media and new communication technologies more language-friendly. He underlined that, [...] "our efforts to support multilingualism are not limited to EU languages; we are also encouraging training in Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Turkish and Russian." [...] He added that, [...] "The promotion of language learning and linguistic diversity is a general objective of the new programme for lifelong learning launched in 2007. For the first time, it will be open to all languages spoken in the European Union {{as well as to the}} languages of the EU's main trading partners." [...] Orban claims that respect for linguistic diversity and the fight against discrimination on the basis of language are cornerstones for a social Europe; he states that, [...] "Europe's linguistic and cultural diversity is a source of richness which <b>also</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> nurtured and promoted," [...] which presumably includes all languages, national, regional, minority and migrant. However, Orban agreed that the protection of language rights was a matter for individual member states and his view is that, [...] "When it comes to language rights, I am not in favour of adopting legislation at European level to be imposed on Member States." ...|$|E

2500|$|If the hetaera were undeniably {{the most}} liberated women in Greece, it <b>also</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{said that many}} of them had a desire to become respectable and find a husband or stable companion. Naeara, whose career is {{described}} in a legal discourse, manages to raise three children before her past as a hetaera catches up to her. According to the sources, Aspasia is chosen as concubine or possibly spouse by Pericles. Atheneus remarks that [...] "For when such women change to a life of sobriety they are better than the women who pride themselves on their respectability" [...] (XIII, 38), and cites numerous great Greek men who had been fathered by a citizen and a courtesan, such as the Strategos Timotheus, son of Conon. Finally, there is no known example of a woman of the citizen class voluntarily becoming a hetaera.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are other}} options, and in {{particular}} in fours the middle pair may row on the same side: this arrangement {{means that there is}} less yawing of the boat through the water throughout the course of the stroke, making it more efficient. The two rowers in the middle, rowing in a 'tandem', need to be well matched and synchronised to make this work (i.e. avoid clashing blades), and the bow person, rowing with a significant gap between them and stroke on their side of the boat, <b>also</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to adapt to the larger space in front of them. [...] Recently around half of finalists in World Cup and World Championships regattas have been rigged with a tandem middle pair, though it is less common at lower levels of competition.

2500|$|Researching {{the mental}} health effects of {{earthquakes}} and other disasters is important so communities can heal properly after experiencing a traumatic event. This is a difficult topic to research because fixing the physical damage from a disaster is usually the first step a city takes towards recovery. Each individual can react differently to traumatic events, and more {{research needs to be}} done to learn how to predict vulnerability and access the effects to find solutions that work best. Because it has been found that different demographics are affected differently, this <b>also</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> taken into account when finding solutions to aid recovery. Different demographics may benefit from different types of mental counseling to help them recover from trauma. [...] It will be important to have information on a wide variety of demographic groups because the same mental health treatment will not help all of those affected by a trauma.|$|E

The height limit rule of 48in is primarily related to access by people with wheelchairs, but it is also related to other disabilities as well.

2500|$|As {{far as the}} suffix {{omission}} is concerned, {{often there}} is a grammatical relationship between two nouns of a compound which could also be expressed in a marked, more explicit way: for example ablaküveg ’window pane’ could be expressed as az ablak üvege ’the pane of the window,’ and based on this derivation, {{it needs to be}} written as one word. The word bolondokháza ’confusion, turmoil’ <b>also</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> written as one word, despite the marked possessive, so as to avoid the literal meaning ’house of fools’ (1st case). Other compounds, where the first element gives the object, the adverb, or the possessor, are also written in one word where the suffix is omitted, or if the actual meaning is different from the sum of its elements. Thus, szélvédett ’wind-protected’ can be deduced from széltől védett ’protected from [...] wind’, and it is written together as the suffix től is omitted. Verbal phrases where the suffix is marked are usually written in two words, even if the meaning has become figurative, (e.g. részt vesz ’take part’), while other phrases with a marked suffix are written in one word (e.g. véghezvisz ’implement’, literally “take to the end”).|$|E
