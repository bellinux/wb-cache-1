The club, {{on the verge of}} bankruptcy, courted newspaper owner Robert Maxwell, someone whom Murdoch regarded as a threat. Murdoch chose not to make <b>a</b> <b>bid</b> <b>for</b> Tottenham himself, for conflict of interest reasons, and used his newspapers to create momentum in favour of Sugar.|$|E
5|$|The {{civil war}} {{did not end}} there; Matthew Cantacuzenus now {{obtained}} troops from Orhan and began <b>a</b> <b>bid</b> <b>for</b> taking Constantinople.

When Henry Tudor landed in Pembrokeshire, Wales in 1485 to make <b>a</b> <b>bid</b> <b>for</b> the throne, his descent from Rhys {{was one of the}} factors which enabled him to attract Welsh support (Henry flew a (Welsh) dragon banner at the battle of Bosworth Field).|$|E
5|$|Braun herself {{attempted}} suicide on 10 or 11 August 1932 by shooting {{herself in the}} chest with her father's pistol.

After Braun's recovery, Hitler became more committed to her {{and by the end}} of 1932 they had become lovers. She often stayed overnight at his Munich apartment when he was in town. Beginning in 1933, Braun worked as a photographer for Hoffmann. This position enabled her to travel—accompanied by Hoffmann—with Hitler's entourage as a photographer for the Nazi Party. Later in her career she worked for Hoffman's art press.|$|E

5|$|In 2010 York's {{city council}} {{and a number}} of {{heritage}} organisations submitted <b>a</b> <b>bid</b> <b>for</b> York's entire city centre to become a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This nomination, to the UK's Department for Culture, Media and Sport would have included York on a list of tentative sites to be reviewed by UNESCO itself. York's bid failed, leading to 'disappointment' from the team involved.

5|$|Taxiride is {{primarily}} a pop rock band, also drawing influences from pub rock.

5|$|As a senator, McGovern was an {{exemplar of}} modern American liberalism. He became most {{known for his}} outspoken {{opposition}} to the growing U.S.involvement in the Vietnam War. He staged a brief nomination run in the 1968 presidential election as a stand-in for the assassinated Robert F. Kennedy. The subsequent McGovern–Fraser Commission fundamentally altered the presidential nominating process, by greatly {{increasing the number of}} caucuses and primaries and reducing the influence of party insiders. The McGovern–Hatfield Amendment sought to end the Vietnam War by legislative means but was defeated in 1970 and 1971. McGovern's long-shot, grassroots-based 1972 presidential campaign found triumph in gaining the Democratic nomination but left the party badly split ideologically, and the failed vice-presidential pick of Thomas Eagleton undermined McGovern's credibility. In the general election McGovern lost to incumbent Richard Nixon in one of the biggest landslides in American electoral history. Re-elected Senator in 1968 and 1974, McGovern was defeated in <b>a</b> <b>bid</b> <b>for</b> a fourth term in 1980.|$|E

5|$|As {{the owner}} of Anfield and founder of Liverpool, John Houlding was the club's first chairman, a {{position}} he held from its founding in 1892 until 1904. John McKenna took over as chairman after Houlding's departure. McKenna subsequently became President of the Football League. The chairmanship changed hands many times before John Smith, whose father was a shareholder of the club, took up the role in 1973. He oversaw the most successful period in Liverpool's history before stepping down in 1990. His successor was Noel White who became Chairman in 1990 In August 1991 David Moores, whose family had owned the club for more than 50 years became Chairman. His uncle John Moores was also a shareholder at Liverpool and was chairman of Everton from 1961 to 1973. Moores owned 51percent of the club, and in 2004 expressed his willingness to consider <b>a</b> <b>bid</b> <b>for</b> his shares in Liverpool.|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev's health worsened in {{the winter}} of 1981–82. In the meantime, the country was governed by Andrei Gromyko, Dmitriy Ustinov, Mikhail Suslov and Yuri Andropov while crucial Politburo {{decisions}} were made in his absence. While the Politburo was pondering the question of who would succeed, all signs indicated that the ailing leader was dying. The choice of the successor would have been influenced by Suslov, but he {{died at the age of}} 79 in January 1982. Andropov took Suslov's seat in the Central Committee Secretariat; by May, it became obvious that Andropov would try to make <b>a</b> <b>bid</b> <b>for</b> the office of the General Secretary. He, with the help of fellow KGB associates, started circulating rumours that political corruption had become worse during Brezhnev's tenure as leader, in an attempt to create an environment hostile to Brezhnev in the Politburo. Andropov's actions showed that he was not afraid of Brezhnev's wrath.|$|E
5|$|Cornwall, {{represented}} by the Cornwall Commonwealth Games Association (CCGA), sent <b>a</b> <b>bid</b> <b>for</b> participation in the 2006 Commonwealth Games, however, their application {{was rejected by the}} CGF, who stated that the constitutional status of Cornwall was not an issue that should be resolved through this medium. However, in 2010, the CCGA sought to launch a legal challenge to the decision of the CGF, stating that the Cornish bid of 2006 fulfilled the entire criterion of the CGF, and by rejecting the bid, the CGF had violated their own code, failing to follow their own criteria for participation. The Cornwall team will therefore seek competition in the 2014 games.|$|E
