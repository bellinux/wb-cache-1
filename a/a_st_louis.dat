5|$|Although St. Louis {{enforced}} {{a variety}} of Jim Crow laws, the area generally had {{a lower level of}} racial violence and fewer lynchings than the American South. The St. Louis black community was stable and relatively concentrated along the riverfront or near the railroad yards. Although informal discrimination had existed in the St. Louis housing market {{since the end of the}} Civil War, only in 1916 did St. Louis pass a residential segregation ordinance. The ordinance quickly was invalidated by court injunctions, but private restrictive covenants in St. Louis real estate transactions limited the ability of white owners to sell to blacks and were another form of racial discrimination. In 1948 the U.S. Supreme Court overturned such real estate limitations as unconstitutional in Shelley v. Kraemer, a court case based on the sale of <b>a</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Louis</b> house (the Shelley House) to a black family.|$|E
