40|$|Convergence in Competition Law. The {{influence}} of EC law on substantive application, access, evidence and {{review by the}} Dutch <b>administrative</b> <b>competition</b> court, viewed {{in the light of}} effective judicial protection The theme of this dissertation is convergence in competition law. It focuses on the {{influence of}} European administrative law on Dutch competition law procedures before the <b>administrative</b> <b>competition</b> courts. The underlying thesis is that substantive statutory convergence in the Dutch Competition Law Act will give rise to procedural convergence, {{as a result of the}} general idea that procedural law is shaped by and ancillary to substantive law. There are many ways in which such influence may take form: from spontaneous parallelism, top-down influence by the EC principle of effectiveness, to spill-over effects into national procedural law. Should this general thesis prove correct for Dutch <b>administrative</b> <b>competition</b> court procedures, this dissertation would substantiate the idea of a developing administrative ius commune. However, this general expectation is not necessarily affirmed by the results of this research. To map procedural convergence, the research was narrowed down to three central themes: access to court, evidentiary law and review by the competition courts. Judgments concerning the application of the cartel prohibition, merger control and competition complaints have been analysed with regard to these three themes. In summary, the research shows that substantive statutory convergence does not necessarily lead to procedural convergence with regard to these three themes. The research then adds a further layer in which these results are evaluated in light of the requirements of effective judicial protection. These requirements have been defined by analysing the EC principle of effectiveness and proposing a national principle of effective judicial protection. In summary, this evaluation brings to light that the requirements are not always met. For example, access to court must be sufficient in light of the underlying substantive law. Also effective judicial protection requires that there must be a clear and effective system of judicial protection. Such access is not always given. The allocation of the burden of proof must not make it impossible for the competition authority to enforce competition law effectively, but must also, specifically in proceedings concerning a criminal charge, not be shifted to the undertaking accused. Neither must it be so onerous that access to a substantive hearing before the competition authority becomes impossible for complainants. The standard of proof should, at the very least, be clear. However, many evidentiary rules have not yet been dealt with in judgments by the national courts and clarity is lacking in several respects. Furthermore, judicial review must be sufficiently intensive, again in light of substantive law. It can be questioned however, whether this requirement is always met, doubts particularly concern review of economic evidence and the rights of defence. Lastly, the judges themselves must be active and involved, and should concentrate on the central issue of the dispute. For this the courts need to have (recourse to) sufficient expertise. Again, it can be questioned whether this is the case across the board. Generally therefore, the requirements of effective judicial protection are not satisfied in every case. Concrete recommendations have been put forward to ameliorate this situation...|$|E
40|$|The Brazilian {{competition}} law establishes that {{every kind of}} economic power abuse is against the economic order, hence, anticompetitive. The classic example of anticompetitive conduct is price fixing or cartel. The main challenge regarding {{the implementation of a}} public policy against such horizontal collusions is to adequately show that an agreement among competitors exists, especially in oligopolistic markets. Our hypothesis is the following: if the <b>administrative</b> <b>competition</b> law does not require an agreement in order to label a conduct abusive, it should be legally possible to reach unwanted coordinated market behavior {{even in the absence of}} an agreement. However, as tacit collusion results exclusively from converging individual interests (spontaneous cooperation), there is no reasonable conduct order available to courts to remedy such evil in case of conviction. The Unified Theory of Collusion is proposed as a means to partially overcome the referred practical limitation, by offering a possibility of restricted, but uniform legal treatment. At the end, a step-by-step guideline for analysis of cartel and tacit collusion cases is provided...|$|E

I argue that the European Commission and national competition authorities appear to be assuming more traditionally judicial functions. The paper explores two examples where this tendency is in evidence: (a) interpretative/normative rulings: the Commission’s opportunity to give an opinion in a national court case; and (b) precedent-setting: in certain circumstances, decisions of competition authorities are binding on national courts. The expertise of <b>administrative</b> agencies in <b>competition</b> law enforcement, in particular the historical primacy of the Commission, may be offered as an alternative source of legitimacy to traditional legal notions.

Based on expert interviews, this paper explores the impact of competition on public personnel policies in comparative case studies. We distinguish between competition for the provision of services, evidenced in waste collection, and competition for highly qualified personnel, exemplified by energy regulatory agencies. These cases are contrasted with the police as a field which is not influenced by either form of competition. Comparing Germany, France, the UK, and Sweden we show how competition shapes public personnel policies in different institutional settings. The results indicate that the designs of personnel policies in different fields of public employment are influenced by the type and the extent of competition. Nevertheless, reactions to competition comply with the constraints and options of the respective national institutional design. public sector labour markets, personnel policies, <b>competition,</b> <b>administrative</b> regimes...|$|R

As a result, academics feel they have three full time jobs at once and daily must manage the multiple and changing roles associated with today&# 039;s academic workload (Santoro and Snead, 2012). Such changes, over the last two decades, have highlighted the need to investigate workload issues (for example, McInnes, 2000; Santoro and Snead, 2012). This paper reports the long-term efforts of two city-based Australian universities to achieve equity outcomes by observing individual workloads and reflects on the impact of those workloads on internal academic promotion. The reliance on actual workloads, across five years, makes this research distinctly different from other studies that have relied on aggregate workload data (e. g. Lafferty and Fleming, 2000) or self-reported survey and focus group data (e. g.

It addresses the interaction of criminal, civil, and administrative proceedings in the UK and the EU as regards procedure, evidence, and remedies. The volume {{contains a}}n in-depth examination of the principles regulating concurrent proceedings and explains in detail the practical solutions following from the construction of EU and UK legislation. Concurrent Proceedings in Competition Law offers a thorough review of the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance and the European Court of Human Rights, as well as analysing the English authorities in the area of procedure and evidence insofar as relevant to the interplay between criminal, civil and <b>administrative</b> proceedings in <b>competition</b> law. The main focus is on stays, binding effect of administrative decisions and judgments, and disclosure and admissibility of evidence in English law and its relationship with Community Law and Human Rights standards. The analysis expands to the practical consequences of case allocation within the European Competition Network, choice of forum within the EU, litigation in the US, and leniency applications in multiple jurisdictions. The impact of Council Regulation 1 / 2003 and the Commission Notices on cooperation within the Network of Competition Authorities and on cooperation with the courts of EU member states is fully explored. Criminalization of cartels in the UK adds a further dimension to the interplay of concurrent proceedings. Issues of stays, binding effect of administrative decisions and disclosure and admissibility of evidence are also studied when they arise in a dispute that is being decided by an arbitral tribunal...|$|R
40|$|One significant, {{tangible}} {{and interesting}} {{challenge for the}} privatised university is its impedance of particular forms of effective engagement and action in teaching and research, notably with respect to inequities in the broader social context, and {{the position of the}} university within that context. In the face of significant resource constraints (themselves the outcome of complex political and economic dynamics) intersecting organisational imperatives toward <b>competition,</b> <b>administrative</b> accountability, unilateral managerial style and 2 ̆ 7 best foot forward 2 ̆ 7 promotional culture combine to produce a particular lack in socio-political epistemology, referred to here as bad faith 2 ̆ 7 not-knowing 2 ̆ 7, or ignorance. A central paradox is that, although the university is evidently devoted to knowledge production and dissemination, and the various issues the sector faces in Australia are well documented (notably: casualisation, ever diminishing research funding, and the implications of the massification of teaching), nonetheless, the general tendency is towards acquiescence and intensification rather than contestation of the processes that give rise to these issues. This not-knowing arises at the intersection of the dissonant and incompatible voices that frame the institution as a workplace: the top-down managerial line and its commitment to control through 2 ̆ 7 cost neutrality 2 ̆ 7, the outward-facing advertorial rhetoric of excellence, and the routine snark of the embattled workforce attempting to harmonise these discrepant formulations of the organisation. It is argued that this empty space of not-knowing is recognisable to people occupying roles in other organisations, and that it represents therefore a peculiar opportunity for those interested in the future of universities as public institutions: there is more to find out about how these organisationally produced epistemic limits are recognisable and consequential across contexts, how they are imposed, and how they contain potential...|$|R
40|$|The Chinese Anti-monopoly Law (AML) {{entered into}} force on August 1, 2008 {{and abuse of}} {{administrative}} power to eliminate or restrict competition is prohibited and dealt in Chapter Five of this law. Abuse of administrative power {{is one of the}} most significant ways to eliminate or restrict competition in China. Great concerns had been focused on the rules of abuse of administrative power before the AML was promulgated. However, its progress in practice is slow and experiences difficulties after this law took effect. Little research has been undertaken outside of China on abuse of administrative power to eliminate or restrict competition due to the specific background and situation pertaining in China. Concerning to abuse of administrative power, the AML have close relationships with EU competition law and free movement rules. This thesis aims to provide a critical comparison between the AML, Article 106 TFEU of EU competition law and free movement rules, and draws on the EU’s experience as a source of criticism and guidance in relation to the application of abuse of administrative power to eliminate or restrict competition in the AML. This study first provides a background introduction on the development of the AML and abuse of administrative power to eliminate or restrict competition and analyses the complicated causes of abuse of <b>administrative</b> power in <b>competition</b> through three areas: the history of China’s economic system, economic theory and legislation. The main comparative and critical research are held in Chapters Four and Five which examine the relationships between abuse of administrative power in the AML, Article 106 TFEU and EU free movement rules respectively. In Chapter Six a case study is taken in telecommunications sector. The application of abuse of administrative power provisions of the AML in telecommunications sector is examined through three areas: market access, interconnection and universal services. This thesis concludes by noting that (1) abuse of administrative power to eliminate or restrict competition provisions in the AML should be revised on the content of these provisions and their exemption rules; (2) a dual-structure of controlling abuse of administrative power based on monopolistic conduct and free circulation is held in the AML; (3) the inapplicability of abuse of administrative power provisions in these telecommunications issues requires a revise for abuse of administrative power in the AML. ...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} amongst {{competition}} law experts that public enforcement of competition law, i. e. <b>administrative</b> penalties for <b>competition</b> law infringements, alone is not enough. Consequently, private damages claims {{play a crucial role}} in promoting and maintaining competition in a market. This suggests a need for interaction between public and private enforcement of competition law. Cartel activities, in terms of section 4 (1) (b) of South Africa s Competition Act, are considered by competition law experts to be the most egregious of anti-competitive activities. When taking this into account, it is clear to see the need for a method which cartel victims can use to claim compensation for the harm they had to endure because of the competition law infringements. Section 65 of South Africa s Competition Act sets out the requirements, which must be met before a private damages action can be pursued in a civil court, as well as the procedure in this regard. Class actions play a very important role as its advantages provide indigent victims in a cartelised market the opportunity to institute their private damages claims. South Africa s Competition Act is silent on the matter of locus standi regarding a damages claim. There is no legal certainty regarding the issue of which type of claim, either delictual or statutory, the injured party has in terms of section 65. Nevertheless the Children s Resource Centre-case provides a few useful insights regarding the nature of the cause of action. In order to address some problem areas regarding private damages claims the European Commission published a Green Paper, White Paper and Draft Directive. Because South Africa s competition law is largely based on the European Union s competition law principles, guidance will be obtained from the European Commission s initiatives regarding the issue of locus standi as well as other problem areas. Leniency programmes are very effective in the uncovering of cartel activities which is why it plays a crucial role in the process of claiming for damages. It is important to note that the immunity offered by South Africa s Corporate Leniency Policy does not cover civil liability towards victims and that civil damages claims in turn affect the Corporate Leniency Policy in such a way that the effectiveness of the policy gets jeopardised. Guidance on how to solve these problems will be obtained from the European Union s Draft Directive which addresses the issue by regulating access to documents and protecting a leniency applicant.

Para tanto, foram selecionados os nove maiores bancos que respondem por mais de 70 % da concessão nessa modalidade de empréstimo cujo mercado geográfico compreende todo o território nacional. Muitos artigos sobre abuso de posição dominante no mercado financeiro têm sido produzidos, cujos resultados, em sua maioria, convergem para o seguinte diagnóstico: "a hipótese de que os bancos atuam em oligopólio não é rejeitada". Entretanto, referidas análises, certamente devido à escassez de informações individualizadas por firma, em geral utilizam dados de forma bastante agregada. Se por um lado prestam informações relevantes para subsidiar políticas regulatórias, questões sobre a competitividade de mercados geográficos particulares que levem em conta as diversas características de preço e produto ficam sem resposta. Foi escolhida a modalidade de crédito pessoal para avaliar o poder de mercado das firmas que operam nesse mercado pelos seguintes motivos: a) ocupa parcela significativa do segmento de crédito ao consumidor; b) seu universo é formado por tomadores atomizados, em geral pouco informados e com reduzido poder de barganha, portanto, um ambiente propício para o exercício do poder de mercado. Os resultados utilizando a técnica da demanda residual permitem rejeitar a hipótese de que referidos bancos concedem o crédito pessoal de forma competitiva. Essa conclusão também foi confirmada mediante uma segunda abordagem empírica utilizando dados de painel. __________________________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTThis work {{applies the}} residual demand technique {{to examine the}} existence of a market power at the free credit segment, specifically into personal loan modality in Brazil. For this proposal the nine biggest banks were selected. They are responsible for more than 50 % of brazilian loan modality and their geographic market comprehend all the nation-wide. Many papers about the overuse of the dominant position at the financial market have been produced and the majority results indicate the following diagnose: “The hypotheses about the banks act in oligopoly are not rejected”. Because of the scarceness of individually information by firm these analysis generally uses data in a very concise way. On one side they render relevant information to subsidize regulatory politics, but on the other side questions about particular geographic market competitive considering different characteristics of prices and products haven’t been answered. In what concerns to competitive at the financial system, the Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) and the <b>Administrative</b> Council of <b>Competition</b> Defense (CADE) are already developing antitrust analyses directly to concentration acts in the banking market in a more segmentally way.

40|$|This study investigates a {{group of}} highly structured, periodic, non-academic events at a highly {{regarded}} eastern women 2 ̆ 7 s college. These events engage members of all four undergraduate classes in mock competitions, gift exchanges, singing, and dancing. As students pass through their college careers they assume either active, giving roles, or passive receiving ones. Since participation is structured by class year, {{it is impossible to}} be a resident student at the college and avoid engagement in {{at least some of the}} events. ^ Called traditions by the undergraduate students who maintain this well-articulated cycle of events, these events seem anachronistic to the outsider in the mid- 1970 s. The central questions addressed by the study were why such activities persisted and what their study might contribute to an understanding of women in the academic arena. ^ In order to study these events several methods were employed, though the guiding theoretical paradigm was a sociolinguistic one. This approach permitted traditions to be viewed as a particular kind of communication strategy. Methods used included questionnaires, which were administered to members of the entering class in the fall of 1975 to determine information new students had about the traditions; a second set of questionnaires eliciting information about participation and attitudes toward traditions was administered two weeks prior to this same class 2 ̆ 7 s graduation, nearly four years later. Participant observation of traditions and interviews with individual students were the primary methods used. Informants included individuals responsible for the events, other campus leaders, a randomly selected sample of students, and a targeted group of 12 black students; informants numbered 120. In-depth analyses of archival materials, especially student and alumnae publications and the papers of M. Carey Thomas, an important figure in the history of higher education for women in the United States, and the college 2 ̆ 7 s first dean and second president, yielded information on the origin of current practices and the evolution of the traditions. ^ Part I of this study presents the results of the fieldwork and includes chapters on the individual events and on participation by two marginal groups, black women and male students from nearby Haverford College. The concluding chapter of Part I analyzes the relationships among the four major events, looking especially at the twin symbols of the cycle, the lantern and the flower. Part II locates Bryn Mawr in the history of women 2 ̆ 7 s search for equal access to higher education, and looks at the shape and meaning of the traditions between 1885 and 1972. Part III deals with the issue of gender and the way in which these expressive events serve as outlets for students 2 ̆ 7 need to see themselves both as women and as scholars in a community whose reputation rests primarily on the latter role. Traditions, encouraged by the administration but run by students, unite this community of women in bonds of intellectual and emotional sisterhood. There is a strong element of rebellion against <b>administrative</b> emphasis on <b>competition</b> for grades and individual achievement in the group nature of these events. ^ This study should be useful for folklorists because of its examination of the folklore both of a sojourning and an elite group; it also represents a major contribution to the still sparse literature on women 2 ̆ 7 s folklore. As a study of college folklore it suggests ways in which folklore research utilizing an ethnographic perspective can make a contribution to the broader fields of the sociology of, and the ethnography of, education. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} the case law and the {{legislative}} activity concerning electronic platforms have taken off considerably in Italy. Relevant problems and questions continue to arise not only concerning private law issues, but also regarding competition and public law, {{as well as several}} aspects of administrative law and tax regulation. In particular, if on the one hand in recent years Italian courts have been dealing with electronic platforms prevalently in a business-to-business perspective – mainly by analysing <b>competition,</b> <b>administrative</b> and tax law issues – on the other hand the Italian Competition Authority (hereinafter: AGCM) and administrative judges set a specific focus on business-to-consumer relationships. They carry out a fairness control of the behaviour of platforms that convey misleading information to consumers, created by other individuals or entities. In this context, an analysis of the activity of the AGCM {{as well as of the}} administrative courts concerning the liability of rating websites, with specific regard to Tripadvisor, reveals several interesting aspects. Particularly remarkable in a systematic perspective is the circumstance that both the AGCM and the Tribunale Amministrativo Regionale per il Lazio (hereinafter: TAR) qualified Tripadvisor as a ‘trader’ according to Art 18, Para 1, lett b), Codice del consumo, which implements Art 2, Para 1, lett b) of the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive (hereinafter: UCP Directive), rather than as a service provider acting as a host in the sense of Directive 2000 / 31 /EC (hereinafter: E-Commerce Directive), as was alleged by the online platform. Most recently, in 2015 a debate arose concerning the platform Uber and in particular UberPop, services which also gave rise to a number of court claims in Italy. Uber has actually been the subject matter of significant case law, as well as legislative activity. Concerning these issues, in particular the AGCM as well as – most recently – the Consiglio di Stato showed to be strongly in favour of the introduction of a comprehensive regulation dealing with the platform service provided by Uber. It is therefore interesting to examine the Italian experience with this topic. An examination of relevant issues could also be useful in order to better understand the elements of the preliminary ruling proceedings pending before the European Court of Justice (CJEU). In the context of the cases here described, Italian courts dealt also with contract law issues, trying to answer to the question if Uber should be considered an intermediary, one of the contractual parties in a multilateral contract, or the counterparty (respectively of the driver and of the customer) of two distinct contracts. In this regard, in a position paper published on 29 th September 2015, the Italian competition authority AGCM—also taking into consideration the request for a preliminary ruling recently submitted to the European Court of Justice in the case of Uber System Spain—classified an agreement concluded by means of the app UberPop as an electronic intermediary service or an information society service, as defined by Art 1, para 2 of Directive 98 / 34 /EC on Information Society services, rather than as a ‘transport contract’. Most recently, in an opinion of the 23 rd December 2015, the Consiglio di Stato tried to properly qualify the ‘new’ contractual relationships arising from the Uber platform and other, similar platforms offering taxi services. In the opinion of the highest Italian administrative court, these ‘new’ contractual relationships are fundamentally different from those currently regulated under existing law. Indeed, Uber and similar platforms do not merely offer a transport service but also further ‘innovative complementary services’, which sensibly modify the contractual scheme. This contribution discusses therefore the Italian case law concerning online platforms, the legislative activities in this area and the further debate on this topic. It concludes with some thoughts on whether the existing Italian law is able to provide adequate solutions to the current challenges concerning online platforms...|$|R
