It {{was not long before}} another came pop. At ten months you had four pretty white teeth, and you used to bite me. Poor mamma! Still I did not cry, because I am not a child, but you hurt me very much. So I said to papa, it is time the little girl should eat. She is not naughty, yet she hurts me. I have given her a crust of bread, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>must</b> look for some other milk.|$|E

25|$|Bread and Alley was {{my first}} {{experience}} in cinema <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>must</b> say a very difficult one. I {{had to work with}} a very young child, a dog, and an unprofessional crew except for the cinematographer, who was nagging and complaining all the time. Well, the cinematographer, in a sense, was right because I did not follow the conventions of film making that he had become accustomed to.|$|E

25|$|When I had {{a meeting}} with the Council a day before the concert, they were {{absolutely}} petrified of me. I wanted to play the records and say 'I am not going to destroy you' but they were just so scared. Because they were worried about their political future. They were not thinking about Death in June as Being a Nazi group, they are thinking that I, Jean Pierre Nobody, want to be Mayor of this town <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>must</b> win the good citizens over of this town to my cause and, therefore, I will be a knight in shining armour, I will always stand up to those things that everybody hates. So, I will stand up to Nazi, skinhead hordes that are coming to destroy Lausanne.|$|E

500|$|Indeed, {{it may not}} be {{inappropriate}} to speculate that some fair portion of the respect generally shown to Whitehead by his philosophical peers at the time arose from their sheer bafflement. [...] Distinguished University of Chicago Divinity School theologian Shailer Mathews once remarked of Whitehead's 1926 book Religion in the Making: [...] "It is infuriating, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>must</b> say embarrassing as well, to read page after page of relatively familiar words without understanding a single sentence." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{magazine}} was moderately successful, {{though it was}} never considered {{to be in the}} first tier of science-fiction magazines. It achieved its greatest success under editor Frederik Pohl, winning the Hugo Award for best professional magazine three years running from 1966 to 1968. If published many award-winning stories over its 22years, including Robert A. Heinlein's novel The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress and Harlan Ellison's short story [...] "I Have No Mouth <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>Must</b> Scream". The most prominent writer to make his first sale to If was Larry Niven, whose story [...] "The Coldest Place" [...] appeared in the December 1964 issue.|$|E
500|$|The {{enforcement}} of the Tea Act of 1773 became a heated issue with the colonists, with the well-known demonstration at the Boston harbor, the Boston Tea Party, a direct reaction to the act. However, a much more important shift occurred in the colonists' drink of choice. In 1773, John Adams {{wrote a letter to}} his wife stating, [...] "Tea must be universally renounced <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>must</b> be weaned, and the sooner the better." [...] Thus began the American shift from tea to coffee. In a concentrated boycott, the housewives of Falmouth, Massachusetts publicly united, vowing to serve only coffee in their homes. This inspired other households throughout the colonies, both in the north and south, to do the same.|$|E

500|$|On 2 October 1869, Putlibai {{gave birth}} to her last child, Mohandas, in a dark, {{windowless}} ground-floor room of the Gandhi family residence in Porbandar city. As a child, Gandhi was described by his sister Raliat as [...] "restless as mercury, either playing or roaming about. One of his favourite pastimes was twisting dogs' ears." [...] The Indian classics, especially the stories of Shravana and king Harishchandra, had a great impact on Gandhi in his childhood. In his autobiography, he admits that they left an indelible impression on his mind. He writes: [...] "It haunted me <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>must</b> have acted Harishchandra to myself times without number." [...] Gandhi's early self-identification with truth and love as supreme values is traceable to these epic characters.|$|E
500|$|By all accounts, Gage {{appeared}} to be a fair administrator, respecting people's lives and property, although he had a healthy distrust of the landowning seigneurs and of the Roman Catholic clergy, who he viewed as intriguers for the French. When peace was announced following the 1763 Treaty of Paris, Gage began lobbying for another posting, as he was [...] "very much [...] of this cursed Climate, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>must</b> be bribed very high to stay here any longer". [...] In October 1763 the good news arrived that he would act as commander-in-chief of North America while Amherst was on leave in Britain. He immediately left Montreal, and took over Amherst's command in New York on 17 November 1763. [...] When he did so, he inherited the job of dealing with the Indian uprising known as Pontiac's Rebellion.|$|E
500|$|As the Battle of Churubusco approached, Scott ordered Pierce to {{the rear}} to convalesce. He responded, [...] "For God's sake, General, {{this is the last}} great battle, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>must</b> lead my brigade." [...] Scott yielded, and Pierce entered the fight tied to his saddle, but the pain in his leg became so great that he passed out on the field. The Americans won the battle and Pierce helped {{negotiate}} an armistice. He then returned to command and led his brigade {{throughout the rest of the}} campaign, eventually taking part in the capture of Mexico City in mid-September, although his brigade was held in reserve for much of the battle. He spent much of Mexico City fight in the sick tent, plagued with acute diarrhea. Pierce remained in command of his brigade during the three-month occupation of the city, while frustrated with the stalling of peace negotiations, and tried to distance himself from the constant conflict between Scott and the other generals.|$|E

500|$|By 1998, Rollins {{felt that}} the {{relationship}} with his backing band had run its course, and the line-up disbanded. He had produced a Los Angeles hard rock band called Mother Superior, and invited them {{to form a new}} incarnation of the Rollins Band. Their first album, Get Some Go Again, was released two years later. The Rollins Band released several more albums, including 2001's Nice and 2003's [...] After 2003, the band became inactive as Rollins focused on radio and television work. During a 2006 appearance on Tom Green Live!, Rollins stated that he [...] "may never do music again", a feeling which he reiterated in 2011 when talking to Trebuchet magazine. In an interview with Culture Brats, Henry admitted he had sworn off music for good – [...] "... <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>must</b> say that I miss it every day. I just don't know honestly what I could do with it that's different." ...|$|E
500|$|To Steinhauer's {{apparent}} surprise, Lody appeared nonchalant {{about the}} danger {{that he was about}} to go into. [...] "Well, after all, one might as well die that way as any other," [...] Lody said, according to Steinhauer; [...] "I shall be rendering the Fatherland a service and no other German can do more than that." [...] At a final meeting at the Anhalter Bahnhof in Berlin, Steinhauer repeated his warnings, but Lody [...] "only laughed at me and told me my fears were groundless." [...] Steinhauer regarded Lody's ability to carry out his mission as [...] "practically nil" [...] and warned the Chief of Naval Intelligence not to send him to the UK, but the warning went unheeded. He recalled that [...] "as he had specially volunteered for the task– <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>must</b> admit there were very few people in Berlin just then anxious to accompany him– they allowed him to go." ...|$|E
500|$|Historian George Herring {{argues that}} Adams {{was the most}} independent-minded of the founders. Though he aligned with the Federalists, he was {{somewhat}} a party unto himself, disagreeing with the Federalists {{as much as he}} did the Democratic-Republicans. He was often described as [...] "prickly", but his tenacity was fed by good decisions made in the face of universal opposition. Adams was often combative, which diminished presidential decorum, as Adams himself admitted in his old age: [...] " [...] I refused to suffer in silence. I sighed, sobbed, and groaned, and sometimes screeched and screamed. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>must</b> confess to my shame and sorrow that I sometimes swore." [...] Adams' resolve to advance peace with France, rather than to continue hostilities, especially reduced his popularity. This {{played an important role in}} his reelection defeat, however he was so pleased with the outcome that he had it engraved on his tombstone. Adams spent much of his term at home in Massachusetts, ignoring the details of political patronage nursed by other office holders.|$|E

500|$|Chopra {{expressed}} her amazement at the single's {{success in}} India. She said, [...] "I am so overwhelmed! I can't {{even begin to}} explain what I'm feeling... it's so amazing that it's been {{just a few days}} since launch and my debut single is now number one on the charts. Thank you so much for the support and appreciation. This means the world to me." [...] At the fourth Nokia Music Connect video conference, Chopra said that the commercial numbers for [...] "In My City" [...] were all the more surprising, since the music sales in the Indian market is not that much. Universal Music MD, India, Saarc Devraj Sanyal said that the label was surprised with the instant sales of the song. [...] "We have been in the non-film music business for a while <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>must</b> admit to mounting engines across all platforms that have been fired like never before on Priyanka's global single debut. But to see these results so quickly is beyond gratifying," [...] Sanyal said, before saying that the single debut would be followed by many promotional campaigns targeting different multimedia facets.|$|E
500|$|The period under Pohl is {{regarded}} as the magazine's heyday; the three consecutive Hugo Awards won from 1966 to 1968 broke a long period in which the award had been monopolized by Analog (the name to which Astounding changed in 1960) and Fantasy and Science Fiction. Frank Robinson commented that [...] "Pohl {{was the only one who}} was surprised when he won three Hugos in a row for editing IF. It had been fun, and the fun had showed." [...] Niven's [...] "Neutron Star" [...] appeared in October 1966, and Harlan Ellison's [...] "I Have No Mouth <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>Must</b> Scream" [...] appeared in March 1967; both won Hugo Awards. Pohl also managed to secure a new Skylark novel, Skylark DuQuesne, from E.E. Smith; the series had been started in the 1920s and was still popular with readers. Pohl also bought A.E. van Vogt's [...] "The Expendables"; the story was van Vogt's first sale in 14years and attracted long-time readers to the magazine. Another coup was the serialization of three novels by Robert A. Heinlein, including the award-winning The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress, which ran in five parts from December 1965 to April 1966.|$|E
500|$|Moore {{considered}} disinheriting his daughter, {{writing that}} [...] "Russell's conduct towards me {{continues to be}} cold and heartless ... <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>must</b> look on her as not deserving to inherit from me". Sophia Peacock, a sister of his wife, was closely involved in Russell's up-bringing and Moore developed romantic feelings for her; in 1858, he changed his will to give her his property instead of Russell, but Sophia rejected his marriage proposal and he disinherited her the following year. Despite Moore's [...] "vehement objections", his daughter married George Edward Corrance in 1860. After a year she eloped with Colonel Edward William de Lancy Lowe; they married in 1866, after Corrance divorced her on grounds of adultery. Her father [...] "had always reason to be dissatisfied with her conduct" [...] and, three months before his death, he made a new will and bequeathed all of his property to Peacock. After Moore's death, Russell Lowe and her paternal uncle, Rev. Edward Moore opened a court case to contest the will. In March 1868, the courts found that the will was legal. Sophia Peacock inherited nearly all of Moore's estate.|$|E
