25|$|Psychosis {{has been}} {{traditionally}} {{linked to the}} neurotransmitter dopamine. In particular, the dopamine hypothesis of psychosis has been influential and states that psychosis results from an overactivity of dopamine function in the brain, particularly in the mesolimbic pathway. The two major sources of evidence given to support this theory are that dopamine receptor D2 blocking drugs (i.e., antipsychotics) tend to reduce the intensity of psychotic symptoms, and that drugs that boost dopamine activity (such as amphetamines and cocaine) can trigger psychosis in some people (see <b>amphetamine</b> <b>psychosis).</b> However, increasing evidence in recent times has pointed to a possible dysfunction of the excitory neurotransmitter glutamate, in particular, with {{the activity of the}} NMDA receptor.|$|E

Less common side effects include anxiety, change in libido, grandiosity, irritability, repetitive or obsessive behaviors, and restlessness; these effects depend on the user's personality and current mental state. <b>Amphetamine</b> <b>psychosis</b> (e.g., delusions and paranoia) can occur in heavy users.

40|$|Abstract Use of {{amphetamine}} and methamphetamine {{is widespread}} {{in the general population}} and common among patients with psychiatric disorders. Amphetamines may induce symptoms of psychosis very similar to those of acute schizophrenia spectrum psychosis. This has been an argument for using amphetamine-induced psychosis as a model for primary psychotic disorders. To distinguish the two types of psychosis on the basis of acute symptoms is difficult. However, acute <b>psychosis</b> induced by <b>amphetamines</b> seems to have a faster recovery and appears to resolve more completely compared to schizophrenic psychosis. The increased vulnerability for acute <b>amphetamine</b> induced <b>psychosis</b> seen among those with schizophrenia, schizotypal personality and, to a certain degree other psychiatric disorders, is also shared by non-psychiatric individuals who previously have experienced amphetamine-induced psychosis. Schizophrenia spectrum disorder and amphetamine-induced psychosis are further linked together by the finding of several susceptibility genes common to both conditions. These genes probably lower the threshold for becoming psychotic and increase the risk for a poorer clinical course of the disease. The complex relationship between <b>amphetamine</b> use and <b>psychosis</b> has received much attention but is still not adequately explored. Our paper reviews the literature in this field and proposes a stress-vulnerability model for understanding the relationship between <b>amphetamine</b> use and <b>psychosis.</b> </p...|$|R

50|$|The {{symptoms}} of acute <b>amphetamine</b> <b>psychosis</b> {{are very similar}} to those of the acute phase of schizophrenia although in <b>amphetamine</b> <b>psychosis</b> visual hallucinations are more common and thought disorder is rare. <b>Amphetamine</b> <b>psychosis</b> may be purely related to high drug usage, or high drug usage may trigger an underlying vulnerability to schizophrenia. There is some evidence that vulnerability to <b>amphetamine</b> <b>psychosis</b> and schizophrenia may be genetically related.

40|$|<b>Amphetamine</b> (AMPH) -induced <b>psychosis</b> is most {{frequently}} {{associated with a}} chronic high-dose “binge ” or “run ” pattern of stimulant abuse, generally preceded by a period of gradually escalating doses of the drug. We showed previously that animals subjected to such a regimen of AMPH administration developed, over multiple daily binges, a unique pattern of behavioral response that included a decrease in stereotypy and a pronounced increase in locomotion. Because of the involvement of mesolimbic and mesostriatal dopamine (DA) pathways in locomotion and stereotypy, respectively, we hypothesized that a persistent shift in the relative magnitude of caudateputamen (CP) and nucleus accumbens (NAC) DA transmission may contribute to this altered behavioral profile. To test this hypothesis, we examined CP and NAC extracellular DA in response to multiple high-dose AMPH binges. Our results reveale...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background All {{antipsychotics}} work via dopamine D 2 receptors (D 2 Rs), {{suggesting a}} critical role for D 2 Rs in psychosis; however, {{there is little evidence}} for a change in receptor number or pharmacological nature of D 2 Rs. Recent data suggest that D 2 Rs form dimers in-vitro and in-vivo, and we hypothesized that schizophrenia, as well as preclinical models of schizophrenia, would demonstrate altered dimerization of D 2 Rs, even though the overall number of D 2 Rs was unaltered. Methods We measured the expression of D 2 Rs dimers and monomers in patients with schizophrenia using Western blots, and then in striatal tissue from rats exhibiting the amphetamine-induced sensitized state (AISS). We further examined the interaction between D 2 Rs and the dopamine transporter (DAT) by co-immunoprecipitation, and measured the expression of dopamine D 2 High receptors with ligand binding assays in rat striatum slices with or without acute amphetamine pre-treatment. Results We observed significantly enhanced expression of D 2 Rs dimers (277. 7 ± 33. 6 %) and decreased expression of D 2 Rs monomers in post-mortem striatal tissue of schizophrenia patients. We found that amphetamine facilitated D 2 Rs dimerization in both the striatum of AISS rats and in rat striatal neurons. Furthermore, amphetamine-induced D 2 Rs dimerization may be associated with the D 2 R-DAT protein-protein interaction as an interfering peptide that disrupts the D 2 R-DAT coupling, blocked amphetamine-induced up-regulation of D 2 Rs dimerization. Conclusions Given the fact that <b>amphetamine</b> induces <b>psychosis</b> and that the AISS rat is a widely accepted animal model of psychosis, our data suggest that D 2 R dimerization may be important in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and may be a promising new target for novel antipsychotic drugs. </p...|$|R

40|$|Aim. Amphetamine and its {{derivates}} can induce, usually {{after many}} intoxications, schizophrenia-like psychosis. These disorders appeared only in part patients with amphetamine dependence. Aim {{of the study}} was to establish prevalence of selective risk factors of schizophrenia development in amphetamine users: 1) with amphetamine – induced schizophrenia – like psychosis, 2) with schizophrenia, and 2) without psychotic symptoms. Material. In the study 3 groups of subjects were included: 30 amphetamine users with amphetamine induced schizophrenia – like <b>psychosis,</b> 30 <b>amphetamine</b> users with schizophrenia and 30 amphetamine users without psychotic symptoms (37 female and 53 male in mean age= 17. 78 years). Methods. Amphetamine dependence, schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like <b>psychosis</b> induced <b>amphetamine</b> were diagnosed according to ICD- 10 criteria after at least 1 year of amphetamine abstinence.
