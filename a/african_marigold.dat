Three preemergence herbicides, pendimethalin, bensulide, and trifluralin, had an acceptable margin of crop safety {{both in the}} greenhouse and in the field when applied at one, two, and four times their labeled rates. Two postemergence herbicides, topramezone and encapsulated acetochlor, caused minimal visual injury to the crop and encapsulated acetochlor had a minimal effect on plant dry weight. Dry weight response to topramezone varied among experiments. Additional studies were conducted to better define <b>African</b> <b>marigold</b> tolerance to topramezone. African marigolds tolerated rates up to 36. 8 g topramezone ha- 1. Visual injury five days after application (DAA) was 3. 1 or less (one to nine scale) for plants treated with the label rate, 18. 4 g ha- 1, or less of topramezone. Fifteen DAA, injury was no longer evident. Applications of 73. 7 g ha- 1 and greater caused visual ratings exceeding 3. 5 at the five day evaluation and eventually resulted in plant death. Topramezone and acetochlor were applied in a tank mix to <b>African</b> <b>marigold</b> in the greenhouse and in the field. In the greenhouse, visual injury was 4. 6 or less seven DAA and plants made a full visual recovery by 15 DAA. In the field, visual injury was 3. 3 or less one week after application (WAA). Plants treated with 18. 4 g ha- 1 topramezone recovered by three WAA, other visual injury was less than 2. 7. Data from both studies indicated minimal injury and rapid visual recovery of treated plants. A study observing crop response to topramezone application when <b>African</b> <b>marigold</b> was grown in pendimethalin treated soils indicated that pendimethalin did not affect topramezone tolerance. A tank mix of topramezone with the insecticide malathion was evaluated to determine if tolerance of <b>African</b> <b>marigold</b> to topramezone is achieved through differential metabolism involving cytochrome P 450. Five and 15 DAA, malathion caused no increase in visual injury (P = 0. 3986 and P = 0. 1315).

The objective {{of this study was to}} determine if double-cropping <b>African</b> <b>marigolds</b> (Tagetes erecta) with potatoes or tomatoes could reduce P. penetrans populations. Plots were 10 m × 3 m arranged in a randomized complete block design with four replications. Treatments included marigolds, potatoes or tomatoes, and natural weedy fallow followed by either potatoes or tomatoes. Nematode populations were sampled before spring planting, between crops in August and after harvest in November. During the 3 years of the study, P. penetrans soil population density declined by an average of 93 % from the pre-plant level when marigold was grown in rotation with potato and by 98 % when marigold was grown. in rotation with tomato. Weedy fallow preceding potato resulted in an average decline in P. penetrans soil population density of 38 %, and a similar decrease (37 %) was seen when fallow preceded tomato. There was a significant reduction in the number of P. penetrans found in both potato and tomato roots when the crops followed marigolds.

Trials in Tanzania have shown that, {{although not as}} effective as nematicides, Tagetes have potential for farmers in developing countries where chemicals are often beyond their means. At the Tropical Pesticide Research Institute in Arusha, Tanzania, {{the effectiveness of the}} marigolds was tested against two nematicides, Aldicarb and ethylene dibromide, with crops of tomatoes in highly-infested soils. Marigolds were planted beside the tomatoes. The two nematicides reduced the number of nematode root galls by 90 - 95 %, whereas the presence of marigolds reduced infestation by 85 %. The plants grown with Aldicarb not only grew better than the other treatments but yielded ten times as much fruit as the control. The tomatoes intercropped with marigolds gave six times the yield of fruit. For some reason, the ethylene dibromide treatment gave the poorest results in terms of plant growth and yield, although it was the most effective treatment for reducing root galling. The researchers feel that marigolds have good potential for overcoming nematode problems with vegetable crops. They can be intercropped easily, require no expertise, cause no toxicity hazards, and could provide a more stable and long-lasting control.

Although CP extracts or essential oils {{have been reported to}} be efficient in disturbing the settling of insects such as aphids, the effect of using actual CPs remains relatively unknown. Our aim was to screen odorous CP species for their effect on the performance of green peach aphid,Myzus persicae Sulzer (Hemiptera: Aphididae), when released on adjacent pepper plants. Intercropping was tested in growth chambers using potted plants to avoid root interactions and homogenise the abiotic environment of CPs. Our results indicated that eight CP species—rosemary, <b>African</b> <b>marigold,</b> French marigold, geranium, lavender, basil, chives, and pot marigold—affected aphid performance by reducing the reproductive performance and/or settlement of females. Rosemary followed by African and French marigold was associated with the largest reduction in adult female and nymph number. Chemical analyses indicated that rosemary and French marigold emit specific volatiles. In contrast, four CP species (false yellowhead, thyme, savoury, and peppermint) were not associated with a significant change in aphid performance and emitted a lower diversity of volatiles. This screening of CPs under controlled conditions may be considered as a first step towards the identification of volatiles emitted by actual plants that can affect aphid performance and help the choice of CPs to optimise intercropping strategies...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to investigate whether or not olfactory clues {{play a role in}} host plant location by the polyphagous moth, Helicoverpa armigera. Volatiles collected from flowers of <b>African</b> <b>marigold,</b> Tagetes erecta, and sweet pea, Lathyrus odouratus, were found to elicit electroantennographic (EAG) responses from the antennae of female H. armigera. Compounds active in GC-EAG analyses of T. erecta floral headspace samples, identified by GC-MS and comparison of retention times on polar and non-polar GC columns with authentic standards, were (E) -myroxide, benzaldehyde, (f) -linalool, phenylacetaldehyde and (-) - piperitone. EAG-active compounds in L. odouratus floral headspace samples were identified as diacetone, (-) -linalool, phenylacetaldehdyde and benzyl alcohol. Increases in upwind flight to air entrained extracts of floral odours indicated that these cues caused attraction when presented to female H. armigera. A synthetic T. erecta blend comprising benzaldehyde, (f) - linalool, phenylacetaldehyde and (+) -limonene gave significant increases in upwind flight approaches. Limonene (either (+) - or (-) -) was found to be important for the behavioural response despite having low EAG-activity. There {{was no significant difference in}} upwind flight response to odours from the live flower and the synthetic floral blend. Significant increases in upwind flight were also obtained when insects were presented with a synthetic L. odouratus blend which contained the four EAG-active compounds identified from GCEAG studies. In field trapping experiments in Israel there was a significant difference in H. armigera catches in traps with a standard 4 -component T. erecta lure compared with unbaited traps over the whole season. Mean H. armigera catch per trap per night (both sexes) over the whole season in unbaited traps, floral odour traps, pheromone traps and light traps were 0. 004, 0. 11, 8. 8 and 1. 35 respectively. The floral baited traps were non-selective catching large numbers of Ilymenoptera and Diptera as well as other moth species.

In total, eight different media were tested spanning high, intermediate and low nutrient salts concentrations. To test the media two different plant species were chosen, a woody species Hydrangea quercifolia (oakleaf hydrangea) and an herbaceous species Tagetes erecta (<b>African</b> <b>marigold).</b> Nodal explants were harvested from H. quercifolia `Dayspring 2 ̆ 7 stock plants grown in raised beds in a greenhouse.

Explants placed on WPM were significantly different than explants on other media. WPM explants initiated growth the most, but elongation was sluggish and leaves showed signs of deficiencies after 8 to 10 weeks in vitro. Intermediate salts media DKW/WPM and DKW/AND had fewer explants initiate growth then explants on WPM, but the few that did elongated.

In 2013 the RMWG received a donation from the Ford family in memory of their daughter, Janice Ford, who was an active RMWG member. RMWG approached me to do a natural dye workshop with the monies received –knowing Janice’s love of color. I instead suggested the money be used to start a dye garden.

40|$|Graduation date: 1970 The root-lesion nematode, Pratylenchus penetrans (Cobb 1917). Filipjev and Shuurmans Stekhoven, 1941, {{is widely}} {{distributed}} throughout Oregon and other temperate zones of the world. Economically {{it is probably}} the most important plant parasitic nematode in Oregon because of its abundance, wide host range of economic plants and interactions with other plant pathogens in disease complexes. A host range study of this nematode included many hosts which fall into one of the four categories: vegetables, field crops, ornamentals and weeds. Most of the plants included are commercially grown in Oregon or are troublesome weeds. The hosts were given a susceptibility rating. Most plants were found to be susceptible. Some of the more susceptible hosts included the clovers, pea, radish, sunflower and the weeds lambsquarter, pigweed and wild carrot. Some plants found to be only slightly susceptible were bean, pepper, sugar beet, many grasses and wild oats. The <b>African</b> <b>marigold</b> was found to be not susceptible. New types of pear rootstocks are being actively sought to provide dwarfness and disease resistance. A test of the susceptibility to P. penetrans of several Pyrus spp. was conducted for additional information. Pyrus ussuriensis Maxim. was found to be very susceptible and P. Calleryana Dcn., a pear decline resistant rootstock, and P. syriaca Boiss., a dwarf rootstock, to be slightly susceptible. Other species were intermediate. An interaction between two plant nematodes, P. penetrans, an endoparasite, and Longidorus elongatus (de Mann, 1876) Thorne and Swanger, 1936, an ectoparasite, was investigated using peppermint as the common host. Results indicated that when the population of either one of the nematodes was high the level of the other was significantly lower. This is probably due to competition between the two nematodes for food and space. The association between P. penetrans and the fungus Verticillium dahliae Kleb. was studied. The two pathogens were grown in combination and separately on peppermint in pots in the greenhouse. Upon harvest the rhizosphere of the peppermint roots was assayed for propagules of V. dahliae. Results indicated that when the nematode was present there was {{a significant increase in the}} number of fungal propagules in the rhizosphere. This increase may constitute the necessary increase in inoculum potential of the fungus to cause the increased incidence of wilt which has been observed by several authors when the fungus and nematode are found together. There are many facets to the pathogenicity of P. penetrans. Direct damage to the host as a result of feeding on host tissues is but one facet. Control of this type of injury may be achieved by utilizing host range knowledge in selection of cover and rotation crops and in weed control. Interaction of this nematode with other plant pathogens greatly increases its importance as a pathogen. Adequate control of soil fungal diseases may be realized when the influence of soil nematodes on such diseases is better understood...|$|E
