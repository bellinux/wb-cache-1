5|$|Colonization with H. pylori is not {{a disease}} in and of itself, but a {{condition}} associated {{with a number of}} disorders of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Testing for H. pylori is recommended if peptic ulcer disease or low-grade gastric MALT lymphoma is present, after endoscopic resection of early gastric cancer, first-degree relatives with gastric cancer, and in certain cases of dyspepsia, not routinely. Several ways of testing exist. One can test noninvasively for H. pylori infection with a blood antibody test, stool <b>antigen</b> <b>test,</b> or with the carbon urea breath test (in which the patient drinks 14C—or 13C-labelled urea, which the bacterium metabolizes, producing labelled carbon dioxide that can be detected in the breath). Also, a urine ELISA test with a 96% sensitivity and 79% specificity is available. None of the test methods is completely failsafe. Even biopsy is dependent on the location of the biopsy. Blood antibody tests, for example, range from 76% to 84% sensitivity. Some drugs can affect H. pylori urease activity and give false negatives with the urea-based tests. The most accurate method for detecting H. pylori infection is with a histological examination from two sites after endoscopic biopsy, combined with either a rapid urease test or microbial culture.|$|E
25|$|Antigen testing, in most practices, has supplanted or {{supplemented}} microfilarial detection. Combining the microfilaria {{and adult}} <b>antigen</b> <b>test</b> is most useful in dogs receiving diethylcarbamazine or no preventative (as macrolides as for example ivermectin or moxidectin typically render the dog amicrofilaremic). Up to 1% of infected dogs are microfilaria-positive and antigen-negative.|$|E

40|$|Current {{recommendations}} {{suggest that}} negative rapid Streptococcus pyogenes <b>antigen</b> <b>tests</b> be backed {{up with a}} culture, reflecting evidence that culture may have a higher sensitivity and also that testing of a second swab may yield a different (i. e., a positive) result because of variation in sample size or distribution. If the latter is common, the sensitivities of current <b>antigen</b> detection <b>tests</b> might be improved by simply {{increasing the amount of}} sample tested. The present study assessed the effect of <b>antigen</b> <b>testing</b> of two swabs extracted together compared to independent testing of each swab extracted separately for children with clinical pharyngitis. S. pyogenes grew from one or both swabs for 198 (37 %) of 537 children. The combined culture was significantly (P < 0. 05) more sensitive than culture of either swab alone. Compared to combined culture, <b>antigen</b> <b>testing</b> of two swabs extracted and tested together was significantly more sensitive than two single swab extractions (94. 1 versus 80 %; P = 0. 03); however, the specificity was decreased (81. 5 versus 89. 8 to 92. 7 %; P < 0. 05). This study suggests that sample size and/or uneven sample distribution may have influenced the apparent sensitivities of prior studies that compared <b>antigen</b> <b>tests</b> to a single plate culture. A strategy, such as the one used in the present study, that increases the sample size available for <b>antigen</b> <b>testing</b> (i. e., extraction of samples from both swabs) may improve detection rates to a level that will better approximate true disease status and obviate the need for backup cultures if specificity can be improved...|$|R
25|$|Malaria antigen {{detection}} {{tests are}} {{a group of}} commercially available rapid diagnostic tests of the rapid <b>antigen</b> <b>test</b> type that allow quick diagnosis of malaria {{by people who are}} not otherwise skilled in traditional laboratory techniques for diagnosing malaria or in situations where such equipment is not available.

The first malaria antigen suitable as target for such a test was a soluble glycolytic enzyme Glutamate dehydrogenase.|$|E
25|$|The {{bacterium}} {{is found}} naturally in fresh water. It can contaminate hot water tanks, hot tubs, and cooling towers of large air conditioners. It is usually spread by breathing in mist {{that contains the}} bacteria. It can also occur when contaminated water is aspirated. It typically does not spread directly between people and most people who are exposed do not become infected. Risk factors for infection include older age, history of smoking, chronic lung disease, and poor immune function. It is recommended that those with severe pneumonia and those with pneumonia and a recent travel history be tested for the disease. Diagnosis is by a urinary <b>antigen</b> <b>test</b> and sputum culture.|$|E
25|$|The {{specific}} {{diagnosis of}} EVD {{is confirmed by}} isolating the virus, detecting its RNA or proteins, or detecting antibodies against the virus in a person's blood. Isolating the virus by cell culture, detecting the viral RNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and detecting proteins by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) are methods best used {{in the early stages}} of the disease and also for detecting the virus in human remains. Detecting antibodies against the virus is most reliable in the later stages of the disease and in those who recover. IgM antibodies are detectable two days after symptom onset and IgG antibodies can be detected 6 to 18 days after symptom onset. During an outbreak, isolation of the virus via cell culture methods is often not feasible. In field or mobile hospitals, the most common and sensitive diagnostic methods are real-time PCR and ELISA. In 2014, with new mobile testing facilities deployed in parts of Liberia, test results were obtained 3–5 hours after sample submission. In 2015 a rapid <b>antigen</b> <b>test</b> which gives results in 15 minutes was approved for use by WHO. It is able to confirm Ebola in 92% of those affected and rule it out in 85% of those not affected.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Rapid {{diagnosis}} is pre-requisite for institution of effective treatment and reducing mortality and morbidity of malaria. The study {{was taken up}} to compare the efficiency of various methods available, i. e. thick and thin smear, Quantitative Buffy Coat (QBC) and <b>Antigen</b> card <b>test</b> (Parascreen). In the present study, thick smear was compared with thin smear, QBC and <b>Antigen</b> card <b>test</b> for the diagnosis of malaria. A total of 406 samples were collected from patients presenting with classic symptoms of malaria. For traditional microscopy; thick and thin smear were prepared and stained with Leishman's stain, taking thick smear as a gold standard. QBC and Antigen detection were done using commercially available kits. Malaria was diagnosed in 112, 81, 98 and 110 patient by thick smear, thin smear, QBC and <b>antigen</b> card <b>test</b> respectively. In <b>antigen</b> card <b>test</b> the sensitivity 98. 2 %, specificity 100 %, Positive predictive value (PPV) 100 % and Negative predictive value (NPV) 99. 3 % were observed. Although the <b>antigen</b> card <b>test</b> is superior than thin smear and QBC. <b>Antigen</b> card <b>test</b> has its advantages in terms of speed, sensitivity and specificity especially in an endemic area. Therefore we recommended <b>antigen</b> card <b>test</b> which was simple, reliable and effective for the diagnosis of malaria in remote and rural areas of our country...|$|R

50|$|Many {{hospitals}} use the Legionella urinary <b>antigen</b> <b>test</b> {{for initial}} detection when Legionella pneumonia is suspected.

Disadvantages are that the urine <b>antigen</b> <b>test</b> only detects antigen of Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 (LP1); only a culture will detect infection by non-LP1 strains or other Legionella species and that isolates of Legionella are not obtained, which impairs public health investigations of outbreaks.|$|E

50|$|The {{most useful}} {{diagnostic}} tests detect the bacteria in coughed up mucus, find Legionella antigens in urine samples, or allow comparison of Legionella antibody levels in two blood samples taken 3 to 6 weeks apart. A urine <b>antigen</b> <b>test</b> is simple, quick, and very reliable, {{but it will}} only detect Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1, which accounts for 70 percent of disease caused by L. pneumophila, which means use of the urine <b>antigen</b> <b>test</b> alone may miss as many as 30% of cases. This test was developed by Richard Kohler in 1982. When dealing with Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1, the urine <b>antigen</b> <b>test</b> is useful for early detection of Legionnaire's disease and initiation of treatment, and has been helpful in early detection of outbreaks. However, it will not identify the specific subtypes, so it cannot be used to match {{the person with the}} environmental source of infection.

Legionella stains poorly with Gram stain, stains positive with silver, and is cultured on charcoal yeast extract with iron and cysteine (CYE agar).|$|E
