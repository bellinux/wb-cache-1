25|$|Several studies {{reveal that}} France seems to be, among the Western countries, {{the one where}} Muslims {{integrate}} the best <b>and</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> most for their country. French Muslims also have the most positive opinions about their fellow citizens of different faiths. The study from the Pew Research Center on Integration {{is an example of}} works revealing this typically French phenomenon. In Paris and the surrounding Île-de-France region where French Muslims tend to be more educated and religious, the vast majority rejects violence and say they are loyal to France according to studies by Euro-Islam, a comparative research network on Islam and Muslims in the West sponsored by GSRL Paris/CNRS France and Harvard University. On the other hand, a 2013 IPSOS survey published by the French daily Le Monde indicated that only 26% of French respondents believed that Islam was compatible with French society (compared to 89% identifying Catholicism as compatible and 75% identifying Judaism as compatible). A thorough survey by the Pew Research Center in Spring 2014 revealed that out of all Europeans, the French view Muslim minorities most favorably with 72% having a favourable opinion.|$|E

However, after reading the book, Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny are disappointed to find the content completely inoffensive, <b>and</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> school has [...] "tricked" [...] them into reading. They decide to write their own offensive novel, The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs (which they originally called The Tale of Scrotie McDickinass), with the intention of disgusting as many people as possible. Later, Stan's parents find the first draft and read it. They find it so disgusting that they repeatedly vomit while reading. However, they both absolutely loved the book. In fear that they will get into trouble for the book's content, Stan and the boys trick Butters into thinking that he actually wrote the book. Butters believes them because ever since reading The Catcher in the Rye, he feels as though he has been entering into [...] "altered states of consciousness" [...] that make him want to kill John Lennon, before he finds out (from his father) that Lennon is already dead ("Dangit!"). Later on, after learning that The Catcher in the Rye also inspired someone to shoot Ronald Reagan, Butters at first goes out to kill him too but is told that he is dead as well, much to his dismay.|$|E
