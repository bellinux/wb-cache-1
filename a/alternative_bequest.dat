The focus is normative: {{we are looking}} at the design of an optimal tax structure from the standpoint of both equity and efficiency. The gist of this survey is that the optimal design crucially depends on the assumed bequest motives. <b>Alternative</b> <b>bequest</b> motives are thus analyzed either in isolation or combined. ...|$|E

It relies on a 1986 survey on the assets structure of 5600 French households. The main conclusion is that bequest motives indeed influence the composition of households' wealth. However, available data does not allow one {{to sort out the}} influence of specific models of inheritance. Peer reviewe...|$|E

A pet trust falls under trust law and is one option for pet owners who want {{to provide for their}} pets after they pass away. <b>Alternatives</b> include honorary <b>bequests</b> made through a will and contractual arrangements with the caregiver.|$|R

Bequests are decomposed into accidental and intended components {{by comparing the}} implications of a standard life-cycle model under <b>alternative</b> assumptions about <b>bequest</b> motives. The main finding is that accidental bequests account for at least half, and perhaps for all of observed bequests. The paper then examines how assumptions about bequest motives affect the effects of income tax changes. In contrast to previous research, I find that bequest motives are not important {{for the analysis of}} capital income taxation. The effects of labor income taxes are reduced by altruistic bequests, but the role played by bequests is much weaker than suggested by previous models. ...|$|R
