40|$|Abstract — A {{refrigeration}} system achieves its refrigeration function generally through cryogenic refrigerant generated by multiple refrigerant compressor units. Traditionally, {{the operation of}} refrigerant compressor units is controlled only by experience or the proportional-integral-derivative controller of refrigerant temperature or pressure. Due {{to the lack of}} scientific, systematic and optimum logic basis, it is difficult to optimize the operation of {{refrigeration system}} and control the excessive energy consumption with these methods. On this basis, this study employs the system optimization method to determine the optimum operation of each compressor unit within the system to obtain the most energy-saving operation for maximum operation efficiency of the refrigeration system (energy consumption efficiency), according to the <b>actual</b> required <b>refrigeration</b> capacity at load side, actual performance and operation condition of each unit. The results reflect that the system optimization method can obtain the optimum solution and increase the coefficient of performance of the original refrigeration system by 7. 83 %.

40|$|The {{performance}} of reciprocating compressors is usually evaluated under steady-state operating conditions defined in standards. However, the compressor is submitted to quite different conditions in <b>actual</b> <b>refrigeration</b> systems, such as transients {{associated with the}} on/off cycling operation. This paper presents a simulation model developed to evaluate the {{performance of}} reciprocating compressors during typical transients of refrigeration systems. The model is formed by the coupling of two sub models, one for the compression chamber {{and the other to}} calculate the temperatures and mass flow rates in components other than the compression chamber. As the model only simulates the compressor, experimental data was required to provide input from the remaining components of the system. The model was validated by comparing predictions and experimental data of discharged mass flow rate and power consumption of a compressor operating under two transient system conditions. Then, the simulation model was employed to predict the variation of the compressor efficiencies and temperatures during the typical transients analyzed...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of lower {{global warming potential}} (GWP) blends offers an alternative for the widely used high GWP fluids such as R 404 A. Commercial refrigeration systems for supermarkets are a common example for such systems. These kinds of systems show relatively large refrigerant leakage rates of 15 % to 20 % per year. The newly developed R 404 A lower GWP alternatives are zeotropic blends, meaning they show a temperature glide during phase change processes in the evaporator and condenser of the system. Because of the glide, there is a concern within end users that the blend components could separate, or fractionate, during a leak event.

Despite of the popularity of these devices in low temperature physics, the thermodynamic relations underlying the cooling mechanism of He- 3 /He- 4 refrigerators are very often incorrectly used. Several thermodynamic models of dilution refrigeration {{have been published in}} the past, sometimes contradicting each other. These models are reviewed and compared with each other over a range of different He- 3 flow rates. In addition, a new numerical method for the calculation of a dilution refrigerator's cooling power at arbitrary flow rates is presented. This method has been developed at CERN's Central Cryogenic Laboratory. It can be extended to include many effects that cannot easily be accounted for by any of the other models, including the degradation of heat exchanger performance due to the limited number of step heat exchanger elements, which can be considerable for some designs.

Undercharged or overcharged systems experience reduced efficiency and accessories deterioration.

40|$|The present work {{focuses on}} {{analytical}} computation of thermodynamic performance of <b>actual</b> vapour compression <b>refrigeration</b> system by using six pure refrigerants. The refrigerants are namely R 22, R 32, R 134 a, R 152 a, R 290 and R 1270 respectively. A MATLAB code is developed {{to compute the}} thermodynamic performance parameters of actual vapour compression system such as refrigeration effect, compressor work, COP, power per ton of refrigeration, compressor discharge temperature and volumetric refrigeration capacity at condensing and evaporating temperatures of 54. 4 oC and 7. 2 oC respectively. Analytical results exhibited that COP of both R 32 and R 134 a are 15. 95 % and 11. 71 % higher among the six investigated refrigerants. However R 32 and R 134 a cannot be replaced directly into R 22 system. This is due to their higher compressor discharge temperature and poor volumetric capacity respectively. The discharge temperature of both R 1270 and R 290 are lower than R 22 by 20 - 26 oC. Volumetric refrigeration capacity of R 1270 (3197 kJ/m 3) {{is very close to}} that of volumetric capacity of R 22 (3251 kJ/m 3). Both R 1270 and R 290 shows good miscibility with R 22 mineral oil.

40|$|The inverse {{magnetocaloric effect}} (MCE) in bulk {{polycrystalline}} and melt-spun ribbons of the Ni 43 Mn 42 Co 4 Sn 11 meta-magnetic {{shape memory alloy}} (MSMA) is investigated. The influence of several material properties on the MCE and relative cooling power (RCP) are discussed and the property combinations for optimum MCE and RCP identified for a given thermodynamic framework. These include a small slope of magnetic field vs. martensitic transformation temperature phase diagram, a narrow transformation range, low transformation thermal hysteresis and a large change in magnetization on martensitic transformation, which results in low levels of applied magnetic fields desired for repeated MCE on field cycling. The thermo-magnetic responses of the samples were measured before and after heat treatments. The heat-treated ribbons produced the most favorable MCE by exhibiting the highest magnetization change and smallest elastic energy storage through the transformation. This was attributed to the specific microstructural features, including grain size to thickness ratio and degree of L 2 (1) ordering. In addition, issues in the literature in determining RCP for MSMAs are discussed, and a new method to find RCP is proposed and implemented. Completely reversible magnetic-field-induced martensitic transformation cycles were used to investigate hysteresis losses relative to <b>actual</b> <b>refrigeration</b> cycles, whereby the RCP was calculated using the defined thermodynamic framework and indirectly measured entropy changes. The annealed ribbons exhibited the high RCP level of 242 J kg(- 1) under the applied field of 7 T compared with a theoretical maximum of 343 J kg(- 1). Similar values of RCP in other MSMAs can be achievable if microstructural elastic energy storage and hysteresis loss are minimized during the transformation {{with the help of}} annealing treatments.

40|$|The Carnot factor versus {{enthalpy}} variation (heat) diagram {{has been used}} extensively for the second law analysis of heat transfer processes. With {{enthalpy variation}} (heat) as the abscissa and the Carnot factor as the ordinate the area between the curves representing the heat exchanging media on this diagram illustrates the exergy losses due to the transfer. It is also possible to draw the paths of working fluids in steady-state, steady-flow thermodynamic cycles on this diagram using the definition of “the equivalent temperature” as the ratio between the variations of enthalpy and entropy in an analyzed process. Despite the usefulness of this approach two important shortcomings should be emphasized. First, the approach is not applicable for the processes of expansion and compression particularly for the isenthalpic processes taking place in expansion valves. Second, {{from the point of}} view of rigorous thermodynamics, the proposed ratio gives the temperature dimension for the isobaric processes only. The present paper proposes to overcome these shortcomings by replacing the actual processes of expansion and compression by combinations of two thermodynamic paths: isentropic and isobaric. As a result the <b>actual</b> (not ideal) <b>refrigeration</b> and power cycles can be presented on equivalent temperature versus enthalpy variation diagrams. All the exergy losses, taking place in different equipments like pumps, turbines, compressors, expansion valves, condensers and evaporators are then clearly visualized. Moreover the exergies consumed and produced in each component of these cycles are also presented. The latter give the opportunity to also analyze the exergy efficiencies of the components. The proposed diagram is finally applied for the second law analysis of an ejector based refrigeration system...|$|R
40|$|Capillary {{tubes are}} {{components}} in refrigerating systems which act as expansion and flow-rate controlling devices. The proper design of capillary tubes {{is an important}} factor in performance efficiency of these systems. An experimental test loop was designed and built for testing the capillary tube. This test loop simulated the <b>actual</b> <b>refrigeration</b> system that normally supplied refrigerant with or without oil to the capillary tube, while providing easily controlled boundary conditions. Pressures and temperatures along the capillary tube and suction line were also instrumented. The capillary tube was tested for a wide range of conditions including: subcooled inlet, diabatic and adiabatic capillary tube, refrigerant HFC- 134 a flow with and without oil. The process of refrigerant flow through a capillary tube is a flashing process, in which the state of the refrigerant changes from subcooled liquid to a vapor-liquid mixture. Metastable phenomena in the flow, i. e. a thermal nonequilibrium phenomena, may exist within a flashing process. Whereas a literature survey showed that the metastable flow of refrigerant was only observed in adiabatic capillary tubes, the experiment demonstrated metastable flow through the diabatic capillary tube for the first time. It is found from the experiment that the metastable flow will vanish when Gc/Gs< 77. 8. A correlation of the underpressure of vaporization (a characteristic quantity for metastable flow) for a diabatic capillary tube, based on homogeneous nucleation theory, was developed to consolidate this new result. The flow in the capillary tube was numerically modeled by dividing the flow into two regions: single-phase and two-phase. The liquid single-phase flow region was described by four governing differential equations and boundary conditions. The numerical model for the two-phase flow region used one-dimensional nonequilibrium two-fluid equations which accounted for the relative velocity and the temperature difference between the vapor and liquid phases. Results of the numerical models compared satisfactorily with measured experimental data. The results indicated that the vaporization occurred near the capillary tube exit with a strong heat transfer between the capillary tube and suction line; the mass flux of refrigerant in the capillary tube without oil was about 2. 2...|$|E

University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2012 Thesis advisor: Bryan BeckerThe ANSI/AHRI (American National Standard Institute (ANSI) / Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute (AHRI).) Standard 1250 / 1251 Performance Rating of Walk-In Coolers and Freezers strives to standardize refrigeration equipment performance rating. According to the Standard, refrigeration equipment is {{tested in a}} laboratory setting using a defined test method. An existing algorithm {{is used to calculate}} the Annual Walk-in Energy Factor (AWEF) which serves as a comparison of energy efficiency between equipment. In this work the algorithm was modified in an attempt to more closely approximate <b>actual</b> <b>refrigeration</b> system operation. To calculate the AWEF, a walk-in box load profile and a ratio of the equipment capacity to the refrigeration load are assumed by the Standard. An extensive literature review of ninety-eight articles was performed to address these assumptions. Information was categorized and analyzed for each load component, including lighting, occupancy, product, infiltration, conduction, and miscellaneous loads. Additional information was collected on refrigeration system design and operation. A model load profile was developed from which a revised AWEF algorithm was obtained. Simulations were performed on four walk-in refrigeration units to validate the revised calculation method. Raw results show improved correlation of compressor runtime, because a specific compressor runtime was targeted, reducing variation between hourly simulations and the 1250 calculation from - 29. 9 % with the AHRI 1250 calculation (Becker et al. 2011) to 1. 1 % with the Proposed 1250 calculation. AWEF correlation between hourly simulations and the 1250 calculation degraded from - 7. 4 % with the AHRI 1250 calculation (Becker et al. 2011) to 15. 9 % with the Proposed 1250 calculation. Plotting the results for the AWEF and compressor runtime correlation versus variation in the box load, between the hourly simulation and Proposed 1250 calculation results, revealed an issue with the compressor runtime calculation. At a box load variation of zero, the Proposed 1250 AWEF correlation is improved to - 2. 4 %, and the Proposed 1250 compressor runtime correlation is degraded to - 14. 6 %. If a specific compressor runtime had not been targeted, the AWEF correlation for each simulation set would have been improved. To summarize, the Proposed 1250 equations yield an improved AWEF calculation but do not accurately calculate the corresponding compressor runtime.
