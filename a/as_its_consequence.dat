6000|$|Grammarians draw a {{distinction}} between a maxim and an aphorism, and tell us that while an aphorism only states some broad truth of general bearing, a maxim, besides stating the truth, enjoins a rule of conduct <b>as</b> <b>its</b> <b>consequence.</b> For instance, to say that [...] "There are some men with just imagination enough to spoil their judgment" [...] is an aphorism. But there is action as well as thought in such sayings as this: [...] "'Tis a great sign of mediocrity to be always reserved in praise"; or in this of M. Aurelius, [...] "When thou wishest to give thyself delight, think of the excellences of those who live with thee; for instance, of the energy of one, the modesty of another, the liberal kindness of a third." [...] Again, according to this distinction of the word, we are to give the name of aphorism to Pascal's saying that [...] "Most of the mischief {{in the world would}} never happen, if men would only be content to sit still in their parlours."[1] But we should give the name of maxim to the profound and admirably humane counsel of a philosopher of a very different school, that [...] "If you would love mankind, you should not expect too much from them." ...|$|E

"Seest thou, Mirah," [...] he said once, {{after a long}} silence, [...] "the Shemah, wherein we briefly confess {{the divine}} Unity, is the chief devotional {{exercise}} of the Hebrew; and this made our religion the fundamental religion for the whole world; for the divine Unity embraced <b>as</b> <b>its</b> <b>consequence</b> the ultimate unity of mankind. See, then--the nation which has been scoffed at for its separateness, has given a binding theory to the human race. Now, in complete unity a part possesses the whole as the whole possesses every part: {{and in this way}} human life is tending toward the image of the Supreme Unity: for as our life becomes more spiritual by capacity of thought, and joy therein, possession tends to become more universal, being independent of gross material contact; so that in a brief day the soul of man may know in fuller volume the good which has been and is, nay, is to come, than all he could possess in a whole life where he had to follow the creeping paths of the senses. In this moment, my sister, I hold the joy of another's future within me: a future which these eyes will not see, and which my spirit may not then recognize as mine. I recognize it now, and love it so, that I can lay down this poor life upon its altar and say: 'Burn, burn indiscernibly into that which shall be, which is my love and not me.'

5000|$|Yet another theorem by Wedderburn has, <b>as</b> <b>its</b> <b>consequence,</b> {{a result}} demonstrating {{that the theory}} of finite simple rings is {{relatively}} straightforward in nature. More specifically, any finite simple ring is isomorphic to the ring [...] of n by n matrices over a finite field of order q. This follows from two theorems of Joseph Wedderburn established in 1905 and 1907 (one of which is Wedderburn's little theorem). On the other hand, the classification of finite simple groups {{was one of the}} major breakthroughs of twentieth century mathematics, its proof spanning thousands of journal pages. Therefore, in some respects, the theory of finite rings is simpler than that of finite groups.|$|E

50|$|Wilting {{occurs at}} high {{bacterial}} {{populations in the}} xylem and is partially due to vascular dysfunction in which water cannot reach the leaves sufficiently. At this time, extracellular polysaccharide (EPS1) content is about 10 μg/g tissue in the taproot, hypocotyl, and midstem; EPS1 concentration is higher later on at more than 100 μg/g tissue in fully wilted plant. Wilting is due to vascular dysfunction that prevents water from reaching the leaves. Ralstonia's systemic toxin also causes loss of stomatal control, but no evidence shows excessive transpiration <b>as</b> <b>its</b> <b>consequence.</b> The primary factor contributing to wilting is probably blocking of pit membranes in the petioles and leaves by the high molecularweight EPS1. High bacterial densities are byproducts of plant cell wall degradation; tyloses and gums produced by the plant itself are other contributing factors to wilting.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the major}} {{assumptions}} {{in the concept of}} mutually assured destruction and the stability-instability phenomenon <b>as</b> <b>its</b> <b>consequence</b> is that all actors are rational and that this rationality implies an avoidance of complete destruction. Particularly {{the second part of the}} assumption might not necessarily be given in real-world politics. When imagining a theocratic nation whose leaders believe in the existence of an afterlife which they assume to be sufficiently better than our current life, it becomes rational for them to do everything in their power to facilitate a swift transition for as many people as possible into that afterlife. This connection between certain religious beliefs and politics of weapons of mass destruction has been pointed out by some atheists in order to point out perceived dangers of theocratic societies.|$|E
50|$|Liberman's main {{ideas in}} {{phonology}} are as follows: 1) A non-contradictory theory of phonology is probably unattainable, because we lack {{the means of}} segmenting the speech current into phonemes. 2) The most adequate model of a phonetic change continuing for centuries, such as apocope and consonant shifts, {{is that of a}} change is caused by some event and is over once the potential of the initial impulse has been used up. The cause of every major change is another change. 3) Stress is not a force but a privileged position in a word, a position in which some oppositions occur that are not allowed in any other syllable. 4) The greatest phonetic changes in the history of Germanic were the concentration of all distinctive features in the root syllable and consonantal lenition <b>as</b> <b>its</b> <b>consequence.</b> 5) Allophones, that is, the phonetic variants of a phoneme, cannot be phonologized (by definition). 6) In Germanic, systemic changes of short vowels are reactions to changes in long vowels. Likewise, changes of voiced consonants are triggered by changes in voiceless consonants; what appears as voicing is really weakening.|$|E
