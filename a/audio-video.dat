Harvey had been an Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA) member for more than 50 years, and would {{occasionally}} talk about flying to his radio audience. He {{was a member of}} the Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA), and was frequently seen at EAA AirVenture in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. He was responsible for funding the Paul Harvey <b>Audio-Video</b> Center at EAA headquarters in Oshkosh. Harvey was also an early investor in the Duluth, Minnesota-based aircraft manufacturing company, Cirrus Aircraft. According to AOPA Pilot contributing editor Barry Schiff, Harvey coined the term skyjack, and is credited with popularizing the terms Reaganomics and guesstimate.|$|E
25|$|The most usual {{trigger in}} sleep bruxism that leads {{a person to}} seek medical or dental advice is being {{informed}} by sleeping partner of unpleasant grinding noises during sleep. The diagnosis of sleep bruxism is usually straightforward, and involves the exclusion of dental diseases, temporomandibular disorders, and the rhythmic jaw movements that occur with seizure disorders (e.g. epilepsy). This usually involves a dental examination, and possibly electroencephalography if a seizure disorder is suspected. Polysomnography shows increased masseter and temporalis muscular activity during sleep. Polysomnography may involve electroencephalography, electromyography, electrocardiography, air flow monitoring and <b>audio–video</b> recording. It {{may be useful to}} help exclude other sleep disorders; however, due to the expense of the use of a sleep lab, polysomnography is mostly of relevance to research rather than routine clinical diagnosis of bruxism.|$|E

25|$|The Bell Homestead period {{began with}} the arrival of the Bell family in the summer of 1870 from their native Scotland, where two of their sons had died of {{tuberculosis}} and their middle son, Alexander Graham Bell, was additionally stricken and being consumed by disease. The Bell Homestead complex in the present day consists of several buildings with their own origins. The principal building at the site is Alexander Melville Bell's farmhouse, Melville House, along with its related greenhouse conservatory, outbuildings and fruit orchard. The farmhouse and its farmland were acquired for preservation as a museum in 1909. The Henderson Home, which had served as Canada's first telephone business office in downtown Brantford, was later moved to the site in 1969 and renovated extensively in 1970, to convert it into a separate telephone museum under the principal sponsorship of the county's largest telephone carrier, Bell Canada. As well, a tea house, a visitor reception centre with a mini <b>audio-video</b> theatre and related facilities were also added to the homestead to accommodate visitors and tour groups.|$|E
25|$|There are {{large-scale}} {{shortages of}} facilities across Philippine public schools - these include classrooms, teachers, desks and chairs, textbooks, and <b>audio-video</b> materials. According to 2003 Department of Education Undersecretary Juan Miguel Luz, reportedly over 17 million students {{are enrolled in}} Philippine public schools, and at an annual population growth rate of 2.3 per cent, about 1.7 million babies are born every year which means {{that in a few}} years time, more individuals will assert ownership over their share of the (limited) educational provisions. To sum it up, there are too many students and too little resources. Albeit the claims the government makes on increasing the allocated budget for education, there is a prevalent difficulty the public school system faces with regard to shortages. Furthermore, state universities and colleges gradually raise tuition so as to have a means of purchasing facilities, thus making tertiary education difficult to access or more often than not, inaccessible to the poor. However, it is worth taking note of what the Aquino administration has done in its five years of governance with regard to classroom-building - the number of classrooms built from 2005 to {{the first half of the}} year 2010 has tripled. Additionally, the number of classrooms that were put up from the year 2010 to February 2015 was recorded to be at 86,478, significantly exceeding the 17,305 classrooms that were built from 2005 to 2010 and adequate enough to counterbalance the 66,800 classroom deficit in the year 2010.|$|E

On [...] 1999, Hubei province's Culture Office issued an [...] "Urgent Notice for Immediate Confiscation of Pirated Not One Less VCDs", and two days later the Culture Office and movie company joined forces to conduct raids on ten <b>audio-video</b> stores, seizing pirated discs from six of them.|$|E
500|$|Beginning {{with the}} group's 24 May 1992 show, Fallon played [...] "Television, the Drug of the Nation" [...] by hip-hop artists the Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy {{as the last}} song before the lights were turned off and U2 took the stage. The band {{believed}} that the song, a commentary on mass media culture, encapsulated some of the tour's principal themes. The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy {{became one of the}} supporting acts for the [...] "Outside Broadcast" [...] leg, and after their supporting stint, [...] "Television" [...] was retained {{for the remainder of the}} tour as the pre-show closing song. After the venue darkened, one of several <b>audio-video</b> pieces was played to accompany the group taking the stage. During the [...] "Outside Broadcast" [...] leg, the piece was one by Emergency Broadcast Network that reorganised video clips of American President George H. W. Bush to make him sing Queen's [...] "We Will Rock You". A different piece, created by Ned O'Hanlon and Maurice Linnane of Dreamchaser video productions, was used on the 1993 legs; it wove looped video from Leni Riefenstahl's films Triumph of the Will and Olympia with various video clips featuring war and news.|$|E
500|$|Zooropa {{completed}} U2's {{contractual obligation}} to Island Records, and to PolyGram, the multinational that purchased Island in 1989. Although the group {{were free to}} sign a new contract elsewhere, their strong relationship with the label and its founder Chris Blackwell prompted the band to remain with Island/Polygram by signing a long-term, six-album deal in June 1993. The Los Angeles Times estimated that the deal was worth US$60million to U2, making them the highest-paid rock group ever. At the time, the group were cognizant of several emerging technologies that would potentially impact the delivery and transmission of music to consumers in the following years. Author Bill Flanagan speculated, [...] "Record stores could become obsolete as music is delivered over cable, telephone wires, or satellite transmissions directly into consumers' homes." [...] With uncertainty {{over the future of}} these technologies and the implications of entertainment and telecommunications companies merging, the band negotiated with Island that the division of their earnings from future transmission systems would be flexible and decided upon at a relevant time. U2 {{toyed with the idea of}} releasing Zooropa as an interactive <b>audio-video</b> presentation in lieu of conventional physical formats, but the deadline imposed by the Zoo TV Tour prevented the band from realising this idea.|$|E
