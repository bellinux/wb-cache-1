25|$|Their concept artists {{looked to}} the team's {{favorite}} graphic novels for inspiration and the concept artwork by Ralph McQuarrie, Doug Chiang, Joe Johnston, and others {{who worked on the}} Star Wars films. They were given access to the Episode II script and concept art early on before the film came out. LucasArts created storyboarded scripts of their cutscenes and gave them to ILM, who developed them into cinematic cutscenes. Knoles envisioned the level layouts and then consulted with lead level designer David Wehr and his level designers. They created a bubble map of the levels which they worked from to determine details in what the player would face and be able to do. The team made a new engine for the game to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> they wanted. The graphic designers worked concurrently with the level designers to create the environments, which the level designers then used to better visualize what they were trying to do. Knoles had previously been involved {{in the development of the}} Super Star Wars trilogy for the Super Nintendo and often referred to those games when describing certain aspects of Star Wars: Bounty Hunter to the team.|$|E

She stated [...] "It's cool that bands like Steps are getting back together, because it's worked out for lots of people. But I don't see it in my plans at all. In the future, I hope I'll still be working and being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> I love. I feel very lucky at the minute, and doing theatre has really opened more doors for me. So as long as I can keep doing what I love, I'm very lucky." [...] On 24 March 2013, Stevens said to the Daily Mirror that a reunion could still happen: [...] "We met up not long ago {{and we talked about}} it and we still are talking about it. We are all in the same head space, talking about how special it was and we do all want to celebrate what we had. So it's definitely a possibility." ...|$|E

500|$|Some of British punk rock's leading figures {{made a show}} of rejecting {{not only}} {{contemporary}} mainstream rock and the broader culture it was associated with, but their own most celebrated music predecessors: [...] "No Elvis, Beatles or the Rolling Stones in 1977", declared the Clash song [...] "1977". The previous year, when the punk rock revolution began in Great Britain, was to be both a musical and a cultural [...] "Year Zero". Even as nostalgia was discarded, many in the scene adopted a nihilistic attitude summed up by the Sex Pistols slogan [...] "No Future"; in the later words of one observer, amid the unemployment and social unrest in 1977, [...] "punk's nihilistic swagger was the most thrilling thing in England." [...] While [...] "self-imposed alienation" [...] was common among [...] "drunk punks" [...] and [...] "gutter punks", there was always a tension between their nihilistic outlook and the [...] "radical leftist utopianism" [...] of bands such as Crass, who found positive, liberating meaning in the movement. As a Clash associate describes singer Joe Strummer's outlook, [...] "Punk rock is meant to be our freedom. We're meant to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> we want to do." ...|$|E

Quite simply, I {{would not have been}} <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> I have in politics without his constant advice, guidance and support through all these years.

2500|$|Allen adapted Ira Levin's play Deathtrap (1982) for Lumet, exchanging a weak, {{confusing}} ending for a {{more directly}} resolved one. [...] Though not being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> a screenwriter needs to do to a play – [...] "opening it up," [...] taking it outside the original set or sets, make it bigger – she was limited to bookending the script with scenes in a New York theater. The plotting was so very tight, {{which is what the}} studio executives had wanted when they bought it. It was up to Allen to cut away the underbrush, simplifying the rhetoric as much as possible and adding some realism to the characters.|$|E
2500|$|Gottlieb {{followed}} {{in the tradition of}} both her parents and attended an Ivy League college, in her case Brown. She played basketball her freshman year as a guard for the Brown Bears, but after her mother died during her sophomore year, she decided to spend a year studying abroad in Australia. It was during that year abroad that she decided to pursue a coaching career seriously. Gottlieb explained, [...] "I knew that it was the perfect thing for me because it combined kind of my nerdiness and love of the X's and O's with the ability to impact 18- to 22-year-olds in a really significant way. To be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> I love, basketball, and have this intense impact on people, I felt that was it." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{several years}} of {{suffering}} from writer's block, Butler published the short stories [...] "Amnesty" [...] (2003) and [...] "The Book of Martha" [...] (2003), and her second standalone novel, Fledgling (2005). Both short stories focus on how impossible conditions force an ordinary woman to make a distressing choice. In [...] "Amnesty", an alien abductee recounts her painful abuse at {{the hand of the}} unwitting aliens, and upon her release, by humans, and explains why she chose to work as a translator for the aliens now that the Earth's economy is in a deep depression. In [...] "The Book of Martha", God asks a middle-aged African-American novelist to make one important change to fix humanity's destructive ways. Martha's choice—to make humans have vivid and satisfying dreams—means that she will no longer be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> she loves, writing fiction. These two stories were added to the 2005 edition of Bloodchild and Other Stories.|$|E

40|$|The {{conditional}} analysis of ability faces familiar counterexamples involving cases of volitional incapacity.
