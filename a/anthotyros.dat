5000|$|<b>Anthotyros</b> (Ανθότυρος) (Anthotyro {{in modern}} Greek, [...] "flowery cheese"), is a {{traditional}} fresh cheese. There are Dry <b>Anthotyros</b> and Fresh <b>Anthotyros.</b> Dry <b>Anthotyros</b> is a matured cheese similar to Mizithra. <b>Anthotyros</b> is made with milk and whey from sheep or goats, sometimes in combination. The ratio of milk to whey usually is 9-to-1. It is commonly a truncated cone, but when shipped in containers may be crumbled, as it is removed. It may be unpasturized, where law allows.|$|E
5000|$|Feta, mizithra and <b>anthotyros</b> are {{traditionally}} made from goat's milk.|$|E
50|$|<b>Anthotyros</b> is {{produced}} in Greece, commonly in Thrace, Macedonia, the Ionian Islands and Crete.|$|E
50|$|Xynomizithra (sour mizithra) {{has a more}} acidic, sour flavor. It {{is created}} by rubbing fresh mizithra with coarse salt and letting it age, usually hung in cloth bags. The longer it ages the denser, saltier and sourer it becomes. It can {{ultimately}} turn into a very dense, hard, white cheese suitable for fine grating. Hard or dried mizithra is also called <b>anthotyro</b> xero.|$|R
40|$|Vacuum {{packaging}} was assayed at 4 °C and {{was tested}} {{in comparison to}} unpackaged counterparts, in both microbiological and physicochemical terms, in studies pertaining {{to the preservation of}} Requeijão, a traditional Portuguese whey cheese. Bacteria were absent (i. e., < 10 CFU/g) in whey cheeses on the day of manufacture as a result of thermal processing. After storage, both unpackaged and packaged cheeses exhibited high viable counts of Bacillus, Pseudomonas, Enterobacteriaceae, and lactic acid bacteria (especially lactococci). Yeasts, staphylococci, enterococci, and spore-forming clostridia were severely inhibited by the package vacuum combined with the increasing acidification developed therein. Whey cheeses packaged under vacuum underwent substantial acidification, slight depletion of lactose, and no significant variation in moisture content or texture; conversely, unpackaged whey cheeses exhibited substantial loss of water and a concomitant increase in rigidity. Vacuum packaging strongly inhibited lipolysis (even if viable counts of some microbial groups were high); saturated fatty acids (mainly C 16 : 0 and C 14 : 0) accounted for ca. 73 % of the total free–fatty acid content, whereas the most concentrated unsaturated fatty acids were C 18 : 1 and C 18 : 2 (ca. 14 % each). The conclusions generated in our study are, in general, useful {{for a wide range of}} whey cheeses worldwide: i. e., Requéson (Spain), Ricotta (Italy), Broccio (France), and <b>Anthotyro</b> (Greece). In addition, our conclusions are particularly helpful in terms of improving the safety of Requeijão, a widely acclaimed dairy specialty...|$|R
5000|$|It is {{primarily}} produced {{on the island}} of Crete but is widespread throughout Greece. It is essentially the same as <b>Anthotyros</b> though the latter may contain some cow's milk. In Cyprus a similar cheese is known as [...] "Anari" [...] (Αναρή in Greek, Nor in Cypriot Turkish, Lor in Turkish).|$|E
50|$|As in {{many regions}} of Greece, {{viticulture}} and olive groves are significant; oranges and citrons are also cultivated. Until recently there were restrictions on the import of bananas to Greece, therefore bananas were grown on the island, predominantly in greenhouses. Dairy products {{are important to the}} local economy {{and there are a number}} of speciality cheeses such as mizithra, <b>anthotyros,</b> and kefalotyri.|$|E
50|$|The {{climate and}} terrain {{has tended to}} favour the {{breeding}} of goats and sheep over cattle, and thus beef dishes are uncommon. Fish dishes are common in coastal regions and on the islands. A great variety of cheese types are used in Greek cuisine, including Feta, Kasseri, Kefalotyri, Graviera, <b>Anthotyros,</b> Manouri, Metsovone, Ladotyri (cheese with olive oil), Kalathaki (a specialty from the island of Limnos), Katiki-Tsalafouti (both creamy cheeses, suitable for spreads) and Mizithra.|$|E
40|$|<b>Anthotyros</b> {{is a type}} of low {{fat cheese}} {{produced}} from a mixture of sheep and goat milk. <b>Anthotyros</b> cheese in Crete is produced from the whey of hard cheese such as kefalotyri and graviera. <b>Anthotyros</b> is a cheese which comes from the myzithra cheese (whey) dehydration. The dehydrated anthotyros' physicochemical properties are moisture content of 35 %, fat content in dry matter of 55 % and low concentration of salt. The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify which of the three gas compositions applied; MAP(1) : 40 % CO 2, 55 % N- 2, 5 % O- 2, MAP(2) : 60 % CO 2, 40 % N- 2 and MAP(3) : 50 % CO 2, 50 % N- 2 can lead to greater shelf life prolongation of <b>anthotyros.</b> The control samples were packaged in air. All cheese samples were kept under refrigeration (4 +/- 0. 5 degrees C) for 55 days. The statistical analysis of organoleptic characteristics was carried out by using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) by means of JMP 5. 0. 1. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Myzithra, <b>Anthotyros</b> and Manouri whey cheeses were inoculated the {{day after}} {{production}} with Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 at concentrations of approx. 1. 8 x 10 (6) cfu g(- 1) and stored at 2 and 12 degreesC for 30 and 20 days, respectively. The pH of the whey cheeses decreased from an initial value of approx. 6. 20 to 5. 83 or 5. 60 (Myzithra) 5. 75 or 5. 20 (<b>Anthotyros)</b> and 5. 80 or 5. 30 (Manouri) {{by the end of}} the corresponding storage periods at 2 and 12 degreesC, respectively. Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 populations in the whey cheeses at the end of the 12 degreesC storage period had grown with an increase of approx. 1. 3 log(10) cfu g(- 1) E. coli O 157 :H 7 populations in whey cheeses at the end of the 2 degreesC storage period did not grow and decreased with an approx. 2. 5 log(10) cfu g(- 1) reduction. Results showed that E. coli O 157 :H 7 can grow at 12 degreesC and survive at 2 degreesC storage in Myzithra, <b>Anthotyros</b> and Manouri whey cheeses, and therefore post-manufacturing contamination with this pathogen must be avoided by employing hygienic control programmes such as HACCP.
