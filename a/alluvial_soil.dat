5|$|From a phytogeographic viewpoint, the {{southern}} part of West Bengal can be divided into two regions: the Gangetic plain and the littoral mangrove forests of the Sundarbans. The <b>alluvial</b> <b>soil</b> of the Gangetic plain, combined with favourable rainfall, makes this region especially fertile. Much of the vegetation of {{the western part of the}} state has similar species composition with the plants of the Chota Nagpur plateau in the adjoining state of Jharkhand. The predominant commercial tree species is Shorea robusta, commonly known as the sal tree. The coastal region of Purba Medinipur exhibits coastal vegetation; the predominant tree is the Casuarina. A notable tree from the Sundarbans is the ubiquitous sundari (Heritiera fomes), from which the forest gets its name.|$|E
5|$|The {{two major}} rivers {{draining}} Tiruchirappalli are the Kaveri and its tributary the Kollidam, {{but the city}} is also drained by the Uyyakondan Channel, Koraiyar and Kudamuritti river channels. The land immediately surrounding the Kaveri River—which crosses Tiruchirappalli from west to east—consists of deposits of fertile <b>alluvial</b> <b>soil</b> on which crops such as finger millet and maize are cultivated. Further south, the surface is covered by poor-quality black soil. A belt of Cretaceous rock known as the Trichinopoly Group runs to the north-east of the city, and to the south-east there are layers of archaean rocks, granite and gneiss covered by a thin bed of conglomeratic laterite. The region falls under Seismic Zone III, which is moderately vulnerable to earthquakes.|$|E
40|$|<b>Alluvial</b> <b>soils</b> may {{represent}} important sinks of contaminants {{as a result}} of the deposition of contaminated sediments along the river by overbank flooding or after dredging. Because of the erosion of alluvial deposits or the release of contaminants from sediments, <b>alluvial</b> <b>soils</b> can also be a source of contamination. In this paper, a risk assessment for contaminated (<b>alluvial)</b> <b>soils</b> is presented. The approach, mainly based on physico-chemical soil characteristics, single extractions and leaching tests, is illustrated by means of a case study from four Belgian catchments. The extractions and leaching tests that were used have been validated by European testing programs and can provide valuable information for classifying the potential environmental risks of soils. Irrespective of the location, pH, organic carbon content and ‘mobilisable’ metal concentrations were the most important factors explaining ‘mobile’ metal concentrations in the <b>alluvial</b> <b>soils.</b> Additionally, the data of the physico-chemical soil characterization, extractions and leaching tests were combined with local and regional factors to classify the <b>alluvial</b> <b>soils</b> in different categories according to their actual and potential risk for the environment. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Sixteen {{profiles}} of <b>alluvial</b> <b>soils</b> of Vietnam {{were collected from}} different agro-ecological regions {{throughout the country and}} analyzed for particle-size distribution and free iron oxides.

The vertical distribution of the clay content in a profile was found to be controlled by soil forming processes and/or land management and was divided into 5 patterns. Similarly, the vertical distribution of free iron oxides content in a profile reflected soil forming process and land management; and in most profiles it showed a significant linear relationship with the clay content. Many samples of <b>alluvial</b> <b>soils</b> showed the clay loss and the lower content of free iron oxides in upper horizons.

The Bangladesh Plain is famous for its fertile <b>alluvial</b> <b>soil</b> which supports extensive cultivation. The country is dominated by lush vegetation, with villages often buried in groves of mango, jackfruit, bamboo, betel nut, coconut and date palm. The country has up to 6000 species of plant life, including 5000 flowering plants. Water bodies and wetland systems provide a habitat for many aquatic plants. Water lilies and lotuses grow vividly during the monsoon season. The country has 50 wildlife sanctuaries.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the five}} {{geographical}} {{divisions of the}} Tamil country in Sangam literature, the Marutam region was the most fit for cultivation, as it had the most fertile lands. The prosperity of a farmer depended on getting the necessary sunlight, seasonal rains and the fertility of the soil. Among these elements of nature, sunlight was considered indispensable by the ancient Tamils, because if rains fail other methods of irrigation could be put to use and if the soil wasn't naturally fertile, artificial manuring would enrich the soil. They differentiated the lands {{on the basis of}} fertility and accordingly cultivated the crops that were best suited for the kind of soil. They were Vanpulam (hardland), Menpulam (fertile land), Pinpulam (dry land) and Kalarnilam or Uvarnilam (salty land). Vanpulam in Mullai and Kurinji regions did not yield rich produce, whereas in Menpulam the yield was very good. Dry crops were cultivated on Pinpulam, because of the limited irrigation facilities. The Kalarnilam was unfit for cultivation. Some of the types of soil known to the people of this age were the <b>alluvial</b> <b>soil,</b> red soil, black soil, laterite soil and sandy soil and they knew what crops could be grown on each type of soil.|$|E
