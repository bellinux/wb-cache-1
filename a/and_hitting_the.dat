A mix of a drum machine, the LinnDrum, acoustic guitars and electronic instrumentation serves as the song's backing track.|$|E
5|$|Baggio was {{initially}} a regular squad member under Dino Zoff, appearing {{as a substitute}} in two Euro 2000 qualifying matches, in a 2–0 win against Wales in 1998, setting up a goal for Vieri; and in a 1–1 draw against Belarus in 1999. Baggio made a starting appearance in a 0–0 friendly draw against Norway in 1999, creating several chances, helping to set-up a goal which was ruled offside, <b>and</b> <b>hitting</b> <b>the</b> post from a free-kick. However, he was later dropped from the squad after Inter's poor 1998–99 season, {{and he was not}} called up for the Euro 2000 finals due to his limited playing time during the 1999–2000 season, and accusations made against his fitness. Zoff centred his squad around younger offensive players, such as Francesco Totti, Alessandro Del Piero, Stefano Fiore, Marco Delvecchio, Filippo Inzaghi and Vincenzo Montella. Baggio was voted Italy's Player of the Century in 2000.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Danielle was {{a strong}} {{tropical}} storm that made landfall on Virginia in the 1992 Atlantic hurricane season. The fourth storm of the season, Danielle {{was one of two}} tropical cyclones in the year to make landfall in the United States, the other being Hurricane Andrew. It formed out of a stationary trough of low pressure on September 18 near the coast of North Carolina. The system quickly reached tropical storm status, and Danielle looped to the west due to a change in steering currents. Tropical Storm Danielle reached a peak of 65mph (105km/h) winds before weakening <b>and</b> <b>hitting</b> <b>the</b> Delmarva Peninsula. The storm quickly dissipated over land.|$|E

50|$|Challenger Challenge: Icy Corner - After {{a lesson}} on {{collision}} avoidance, the icy corner must be tackled at 50 km/h. Contestants have three attempts at the corner before failing. Sly releases the brake too late, <b>and</b> <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> wall in all three attempts. After this, Andrew voices his opinion that Sly's driving is showing no signs of improvement, {{and that he should}} seriously consider giving up driving permanently; a point which Andrew would continue to make {{until the end of the}} season. Tab goes over-speed (at 60 km/h) during all three of her runs, <b>and</b> <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> wall each time. Afiya brakes too soon and takes up the tarp in her first attempt, <b>and</b> <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> wall in her other two attempts. Shirley also pulls up the tarp too soon in her second attempt, and in all three attempts she does not release <b>the</b> brake <b>and</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> wall. As for Aaron, he passes on his first try.|$|R
5|$|Hurricane Belle was {{a strong}} {{tropical}} cyclone that caused moderate damage across the East Coast of the United States in August1976. In late July, a tropical wave emerged off {{the west coast of}} Africa. Traversing the Atlantic Ocean for more than a week, the system eventually consolidated into a tropical depression near the Bahamas on August6. Remaining nearly stationary for a day, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm on August7 and a hurricane later that day as it acquired a northwest motion. Formation of an eye accompanied quick intensification and Belle reached its peak the following day with winds of 120mph (195km/h). The hurricane subsequently turned north and accelerated, skirting the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Early on August10, Belle made landfall on Long Island, New York, as a minimal hurricane crossing Long Island Sound <b>and</b> <b>hitting</b> <b>the</b> central coast of Connecticut as strong tropical storm. Thereafter, Belle transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over New England before moving over Atlantic Canada. The system turned east while over the north Atlantic and ultimately dissipated on August15 to the south of Iceland.|$|E
5|$|Button {{scored the}} car's first points in Monaco, with an eighth-place finish. He later {{attributed}} the result to having {{confidence in the}} car, noting that he could raise the ride height at {{the front end of}} the car and brake heavily without locking the brakes or bottoming out <b>and</b> <b>hitting</b> <b>the</b> road, but without compromising the performance of the car when turning in to the apex of a corner. However, in the following races in Canada and Austria, the team's struggles came to a head as they were forced to reduce the power output of the engine to levels that had not been used since Australia, and could not therefore provide a competitive package for the long straights and slow corners of the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve and Red Bull Ring. In addition, with their arrival in Austria, both Button and Alonso had used up their quota of engine components for the season, which combined with unscheduled gearbox changes, resulted in both drivers receiving twenty-five place grid penalties. The team also introduced their first major aerodynamic updates for the season, replacing the snub nose of the original design with a squared-off front end similar to the designs of the Williams FW37 and Red Bull RB11. The rear of the floor was also revised, with a series of slots cut into the body in front of the rear wheels to change the air pressure flowing towards the diffuser. The team only saw limited running as Alonso retired on the opening lap after a collision with Kimi Räikkönen, but they were able to assess the new design at a post-race test. After enduring four consecutive retirements, Alonso scored his first point of the season with a tenth-place finish in Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of the 2012–13 season, May went {{on trial}} with League Two club Gillingham, {{training}} {{with the club}} {{for a number of}} weeks and playing in several pre-season friendlies. However, no move materialised, and May signed for Conference South side Dover Athletic on a free transfer on 8 August 2012. May made his competitive debut for Dover in a 2–2 away draw against Sutton United on 21 August 2012, coming on as an 86th-minute substitute. He made his first start four days later as Dover defeated AFC Hornchurch 1–0 at Hornchurch Stadium, before scoring his first goal for the club in a 3–1 away win at Eastleigh on 1 September. May went on to score in seven consecutive games running from September to November, five of which in the league and a further two in the FA Cup, subsequently taking his goal tally for the season to eight. Goals in convincing victories over Weston-super-Mare and Truro City took May's goal count into double figures. He ended the year with a run of five goals in three matches, scoring braces in wins against Eastleigh and Hayes & Yeading United, as well as scoring a late consolation strike in a 2–1 defeat to Tonbridge Angels on 26 December 2012. It took May a month to get off the mark {{at the start of the}} new year, controlling the ball and scoring on the turn in a 3–2 win over Welling United at the Crabble Athletic Ground on 9 February 2013. He scored four times in March 2013, subsequently taking his tally for the season to over 20 goals – the first time May had reached this milestone in his career. He scored two further times during the regular season, in away victories against Chelmsford City and Staines Town. Dover finished the season in third place, meaning they would play fourth placed Eastleigh in the two legged play-off semi-finals. May scored a dipping volley as Dover took a 3–1 lead in the first leg, controlling the ball on his chest with his back to goal, turning <b>and</b> <b>hitting</b> <b>the</b> ball from 25-yards past Ross Flitney in the Eastleigh goal. Dover progressed to the final, but lost 3–2 to Salisbury City after extra-time, with May playing in all three play-off matches. During his one season at Dover, May finished the season as the club's top goalscorer, scoring 24 times in 45 matches.|$|E

25|$|In the Edo period, sports {{became a}} popular {{way to spend}} time. The only problem {{was that they were}} often {{accompanied}} by gambling. A notice to punish playing and betting on sumo without authorization was repeatedly posted to little effect. Kyūdō was encouraged by shoguns and daimyōs as a pastime, and contests as well as record making attempts were held. On April 26, 1686, a samurai named Wasa Daihachiro competing in the Tōshiya made an unsurpassed record of shooting 13,053 arrows <b>and</b> <b>hitting</b> <b>the</b> mark 8,133 times over a 24-hour period. This is even more remarkable when one considers the shooting range for this attempt, a 120-meter-long corridor with a ceiling of only 2.2 meters. In the Olympic Games, archers shoot over a distance of only 70 meters. Martial arts like jujutsu were popular but schools avoided inter-school matches, leaving room only for intramural matches.|$|E
25|$|Before the Hatlestad Slide, Norway {{maintained}} a liberal policy {{when it came}} to housing construction on hills.

After construction was finished, there were several incidents of rocks dislodging from the cliff <b>and</b> <b>hitting</b> <b>the</b> road. The rocks did not cause material damage or personal injury, and the municipality took no action besides setting up a warning sign by the road.
