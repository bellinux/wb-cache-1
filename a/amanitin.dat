The ability of the fungus to produce these toxins was {{confirmed}} by growing the mycelium as a liquid culture (only trace amounts of β-amanitin were found). G.marginata {{is thought to be}} the only species of the amatoxin-producing genera that will produce the toxins while growing in culture. Both amanitins were quantified in G.autumnalis (1.5mg/g dry weight) and G.marginata (1.1mg/g dry weight). Later experiments confirmed the occurrence of γ-amanitin and β-amanitin in German specimens of G.autumnalis and G.marginata and revealed the presence of the three amanitins in the fruit bodies of G.unicolor. Although some mushroom field guides claim that the species (as G.autumnalis) also contains phallotoxins (however phallotoxins cannot be absorbed by humans), scientific evidence does not support this contention.

40|$|The {{increasing}} number of Amanita phalloides poisoning cases in Australia and lack of efficient treatment options has emphasised the need for detection methods which can be applied in forensic and clinical toxicology. In this study, an existing method utilised by Nomura et al. [1] was adapted {{for the detection of}} A. phalloides toxins, α-amanitin, β-amanitin and phalloidin, in whole blood specimens using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Various parameters were evaluated in order to develop an optimised method, which was then validated. Optimisation of the MRM parameters was conducted using MS/MS with an electrospray interface in positive ionisation mode. This mode was found to give the greatest number of stable transitions and far greater sensitivity than negative ionisation mode. Resolution of the two <b>amanitins</b> was achieved using a Waters ACQUITY UPLC BEH C 18 column (2. 1 mm x 150 mm) and a mobile phase combination of 5 mM ammonium formate with 0. 05 % formic acid : 0. 1 % formic acid in water at a flow rate of 0. 4 mL/min. The total run time of the method was 8 minutes. Two internal standards, virginiamycin B and rifampicin, were evaluated with rifampicin being chosen as the internal standard. Samples were diluted prior to undergoing solid-phase extraction. The sample preparation method utilised a dilution step followed by SPE. Several columns were trialled, with the UCT Clean Up C 18 column providing the best recovery. The SPE method was adapted from that outlined in Nomura et al. [1] The overall developed method was validated according to NATA guidelines [2] and methods outlined by Shah et al. [3] The parameters evaluated included selectivity, matrix effects, linearity, recovery, sensitivity, precision and limits of detection and quantification. The method produced good selectivity for each analyte, however significant matrix effects were encountered for the analytes which affected further results. Linearity studies were performed over the range of 25 - 500 ng/mL for the <b>amanitins</b> and 5 - 100 ng/mL for phalloidin, and gave correlation coefficients of 0. 9731, 0. 9825 and 0. 9872 for α-amanitin, β-amanitin and phalloidin respectively. Average recoveries ranged from 79. 46 %- 107. 99 % for α-amanitin, 46. 96 - 62. 19 % for β-amanitin and 6. 62 - 12. 45 % for phalloidin, suggesting the extraction method needs further improvement. The method exhibited poor sensitivity for the analytes, with slopes of 0. 0031, 0. 0022 and 0. 0002 for α-amanitin, β-amanitin and phalloidin respectively. The method was found to be precise for each of the analytes and showing no significant difference between data points, with p-values of 0. 4279 for α-amanitin, 0. 7265 for β-amanitin and 0. 7814 for phalloidin. Limits of detection were determined to be 25 ng/mL for both <b>amanitins</b> and 20 ng/mL for phalloidin. Limits of quantification were determined to be 75 ng/mL for the <b>amanitins</b> and 60 ng/mL for phalloidin. Overall, the developed method did not pass validation, however offers a good basis for further work...|$|R
40|$|<b>Amanitins,</b> {{highly toxic}} cyclopeptides {{isolated}} from various Amanita species, {{are the most}} potent poisons accounting for the hazardous effects on intestinal epithelium cells and hepatocytes, and probably the sole cause of fatal human poisoning. The present study {{was focused on the}} development, optimization and application of an analytical methodology by ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC–MS/MS), following urine and liver sample preparation by protein precipitation with organic solvents, and solid phase extraction (SPE) procedure, for the determination of the amatoxins, α- and β-amanitin. Linearity, detection and quantification limits, selectivity, sensitivity, intra and inter-assay precision and recovery were studied, in order to guarantee reliability in the analytical results. The developed method proved to be specific and selective, with LOD (Limit of Detection) values for α- and β-amanitin of 0. 22 and 0. 20 ng mL− 1 in urine and 10. 9 and 9. 7 ng g− 1 in liver, respectively. LOQ (Limit of Quantification) values ranged from 0. 46 to 0. 57 ng mL− 1 in urine and 12. 3 – 14. 7 ng g− 1 in tissue, for both <b>amanitins.</b> Linearity, in the range of 10. 0 – 200. 0 ng mL− 1 or ng g− 1, shows that coefficients of correlation were greater than 0. 997 for α-amanitin and 0. 993 for β-amanitin. Precision was checked at three levels during three consecutive days with intra-day and inter-day coefficients of variation not greater than 15. 2 %. The extraction recovery presents good results for the concentrations analyzed, with values ranging from 90. 2 to 112. 9 % for both matrices. Thus, the proposed analytical method is innovative, presents a high potential in the identification, detection and determination of α- and β-amanitins in urine and tissue samples, as well as in other biological samples, such as kidney and mushrooms...|$|R

30|$|Another {{important}} consideration is {{the limited number}} of payload molecules that can be efficiently delivered into target cells. Only 1.56 % of administered drug molecules can enter target cells if the efficiency of each step in the ADC mechanism is assumed to be 50 % (biodistribution, binding to antigen, internalization, release of payload, intracellular stability of payload, and payload binding to target) (Teicher and Chari, 2011). Indeed, the actual uptake is estimated to be much lower than this assumption (< 0.01 % injected dose per gram of tumor) (Sedlacek et al., 1992). Thus, to maximize treatment efficacy using ADCs, cytotoxic potency of payload is required to be high enough to effectively eradicate target cells, ideally in the picomolar range. While important to select highly potent toxic agents as payload, ideal agents have inherent selectivity for target cancer cells. Certain types of noncancerous cells may be capable of internalizing ADCs through nonspecific pinocytosis or fragment crystallizable (Fc) region receptor-mediated endocytosis (Lencer and Blumberg, 2005). Furthermore, payload may be released upon degradation into circulating blood. Thus, payloads have primarily been selected based on the above-mentioned consideration; antimitotic agents, which are generally less toxic to noncancerous cells than to cancerous cells, are payloads that have been mainly used in the FDA-approved ADCs and ADCs in clinical trials. In addition to calicheamicins (used in Mylotarg®), auristatins (used in Adcetris®), and maytansinoids (used in Kadcyla®), new classes of highly potent antimitotic compounds have also been explored for ADC payloads: duocarmycins, pyrrolobenzodiazepine dimers (PBDs), <b>amanitins,</b> and tubulysin analogs are such examples (Chari et al., 2014; Perez et al., 2014).|$|R

40|$|Giardia lamblia is {{an early}} {{branching}} eukaryote and although distinctly eukaryotic in its cell and molecular biology, transcription in G. lamblia demonstrates important differences from these processes in higher eukaryotes. α-amanitin is a relatively selective inhibitor of eukaryotic RNA Polymerase II (RNAP II), and is commonly used to study RNAP II transcription. Therefore, we measured the sensitivity of G. lamblia RNAP II transcription to α-amanitin and found that unlike most other eukaryotes, RNAP II transcription in Giardia is resistant to 1 mg/ml <b>amanitin.</b> To better understand transcription in G. lamblia, we identified 10 out of the 12 known eukaryotic rph genes, including all ten that are required for viability in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The <b>amanitin</b> motif (<b>amanitin</b> binding site) of Rpbl from G. lamblia differs from other eukaryotes at six highly conserved sites in which substitutions {{have been associated with}} <b>amanitin</b> resistance in other organisms. These observations of <b>amanitin</b> resistance provide a molecular framework for the development of novel drugs with selective activity against G. lamblia. Giardia trophozoites exhibit antigenic variation of a surface protein encoded by a family of genes known as the vsp genes. A single trophozoite expresses only one vsp at a time and it has been previously determined that steady state mRNA of only the expressed vsp is detectable in Northern blots. Our nuclear run-on assays indicated transcription of only the expressed vsp genes, suggesting that control is primarily at the level of transcription rather than post-transcription. In order to better understand vsp gene control mechanisms, we used a luciferase reporter to determine the vsp core promoter, which is present within 100 bp upstream of the ORF in the case of vspCS and vspA 6. The fact that the vsp promoter is able to drive expression irrespective of the antigenic variant type indicates that control requires a chromosomal context as do most epigenetic mechanisms of control. Based on the existing data, we provide a privileged site model for the control of vsp gene expression, in which vsp transcription takes place in a set nuclear location which is occupied by a singe vsp locus at a time...|$|E

Using an amanitin-resistant ama- 1 (m 118) or ama- 1 (m 322) strain as a parent, we have isolated amanitin-sensitive mutants that carry recessive-lethal ama- 1 alleles. The frequency of EMS-induced lethal ama- 1 mutations is approximately 1. 7 X 10 (- 3), 1000 -fold higher than the frequency of amanitin-resistance alleles. Nine of the lethal alleles are apparent null mutations, and they exhibit L 1 -lethal phenotypes at both 20 ° and 25 °. Six alleles result in partial loss of RNA polymerase II function as determined by their sterile phenotypes at 20 °. All but one of these latter mutations exhibit a more severe phenotype at 25 °C. We have also selected seven EMS-induced revertants of three different ama- 1 lethals. These revertants restore dominant resistance to <b>amanitin.</b> The selection for revertants also produced eight new dominant <b>amanitin</b> resistance alleles on the balancer chromosome, nT 1...|$|E
40|$|Hepatic {{transport}} {{studies with}} amatoxins, toxic bicyclic octapeptides from poisonous mushrooms {{of the genus}} Amanita were performed, using [(6 '-O, 1 '-N-di[3 H]methyl) trp 4]-alpha-amanitin and [(6 '-O, 1 '-N-di-methyl) trp 4]-[4 -[3 H]desmethyl) hyi 3]-gamma-ama nitin. Uptake into hepatocytes from rat liver was inhibited by taurocholate and antamanide. Photoaffinity labeling studies with isolated hepatocytes and basolateral plasma membranes, using the sodium salt of (7, 7 -azo- 3 alpha, 12 alpha-dihydroxy- 5 beta-[3 beta- 3 H]cholan- 24 -oyl) - 2 - aminoethanesulfonic acid demonstrated {{that the presence of}} alpha-amanitin decreased the labeling of the two sinusoidal bile salt-binding membrane polypeptides with the apparent molecular weights of 54, 000 and 48, 000. In basolateral plasma membrane vesicles <b>amanitin</b> uptake was temperature-dependent and could be stimulated 1. 5 to 2 -fold by an out to in Na+ gradient as compared to a K+ gradient or sucrose and 2 to 2. 5 -fold as compared to <b>amanitin</b> equilibration (overshoot). Kinetic studies proved saturability of <b>amanitin</b> uptake in the presence and absence of a Na+ gradient. Membrane transport could be inhibited by taurocholate, antamanide, phalloidin, prednisolone, and silybin, but not by penicillin G or thioctic acid. Hepatic uptake of amatoxins is mediated by the sinusoidal bile salt-transport systems which are also involved in the uptake of antamanide and phalloidin. This supports the concept of a multispecificity of hepatic transport systems {{for a wide variety of}} amphipathic molecules...|$|E

Effects of actinomycin D, <b>amanitin,</b> cycloheximide and puromycin on the F and testosterone-induced steroid production were investigated during an in vitro culture system for preovulatory ovarian follicles. When isolated preovulatory follicles were incubated in medium containing actinomycin D, <b>amanitin,</b> cycloheximide or puromycin combined with F or with testosterone, F- and testosterone-induced E_ 2 and 17 α, 20 β-diOHP production was inhibited. A similar inhibitory effect was also observed with cyanoketone, {{which is a}} specific inhibitor of 3 β-hydroxy-Δ^ 5 -steroid dehydrogenase（ 3 β-HSD）. These {{results suggest that the}} F- and testosterone-induced E_ 2 and 17 α, 20 β-diOHP production in medaka ovarian follicles is probably mediated by de novo synthesis of mRNA...|$|E
40|$|Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) {{replication}} involves {{processing and}} accumulation of three RNA species: the genome, its exact complement (the antigenome), and a polyadenylated mRNA {{that acts as}} a template for the small delta antigen (δAg), the only protein of HDV and essential for genome replication. In a recently reported experimental system, addition of tetracycline induced synthesis of a DNA-directed source of δAg, producing within 24 h a significant increase in accumulation of newly transcribed and processed HDV RNAs. This induction was used here to study the action of various inhibitors on accumulation. For example, potent and HDV-specific inhibition, in the absence of detected host toxicity, could be obtained with ribavirin, mycophenolic acid, and viramidine. An interpretation is that these inhibitors reduced the available GTP pool, leading to a specific inhibition of the synthesis and accumulation of HDV RNA-directed RNA species. In contrast, no inhibition was observed with l-FMAU (2 ′-fluoro- 5 -methyl-β-l-arabinofuranosyl-uridine), alpha interferon, or pegylated alpha interferon. After modifications to the experimental system, it was also possible {{to examine the effects of}} three known host RNA polymerase inhibitors on HDV genome replication: <b>amanitin,</b> 5, 6 -dichloro- 1 -β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB), and actinomycin. Of most interest, <b>amanitin</b> at low doses blocked accumulation of HDV RNA-directed mRNA but had less effect on HDV genomic and antigenomic RNAs. Additional experiments indicated that this apparent resistance to <b>amanitin</b> inhibition of genomic and antigenomic RNA relative to mRNA may not reflect a difference in the transcribing polymerase but rather relative differences in the processing and stabilization of nascent RNA transcripts...|$|E

40|$|A doubly mutant ama- 1 (m 118 m 526) gene {{results in}} an RNA {{polymerase}} (Rpo) II that is unusually resistant to α-amanitin. Rpo II activity in isolated Caenorhabditis elegans cell nuclei is inhibited 50 % by α-amanitin at a concentration of 150 μg/ml, making this enzyme 150 times more resistant to the toxin than Rpo II from the singly mutant allele, ama- 1 (m 118), 20, 000 times more resistant than the wild-type Rpo II, and about six times more resistant to <b>amanitin</b> than is Rpo III. It was determined that the SL 1 spliced leader precursor is transcribed by Rpo II, and this transcript {{was used to measure}} Rpo II activity. The Rpo II activity is unstable in vitro, and the mutant strain has a temperature-sensitive sterile phenotype. The highly resistant double mutant was selected among four million progeny of the mutagenized ama- 1 (m 118) parent by its ability to grow and reproduce in 200 μg/ml <b>amanitin</b> {{in the presence of a}} permeabilizing agent, Triton X- 100...|$|E
40|$|A fine-structure {{genetic map}} has been {{constructed}} for ama- 1 IV, an essential gene in Caenorhabditis elegans encoding the amanitin-binding subunit of RNA polymerase II. Sixteen EMS-induced recessive-lethal mutations have been positioned in the gene by determining their intragenic recombination frequencies with m 118, a mutation that confers dominant resistance to α-amanitin. The 16 mutants, all {{isolated in the}} ama- 1 (m 118) background, include 13 that are early larval lethals, and three that are mid-larval lethals, at 25 °. Six of the mutants exhibit temperature-dependence in the severity of their phenotype. Intragenic recombination between the lethal site and the parental resistance mutation was detected by means of resistance to <b>amanitin.</b> Recombinants were detected at frequencies as low as 2 X 10 (- 6). The segregation of the closely linked flanking markers, unc- 17 and unc- 5, revealed whether the lethal mutation was {{to the left or}} the right of m 118. By adding the distances between the extreme left and right mutations, the ama- 1 gene is estimated to be 0. 011 map unit long, with m 118 positioned 0. 004 map unit from the left-most lethal mutation. To order the lethal mutations with respect to each other, viable heteroallelic strains were constructed using the free duplication, mDp 1 [unc- 17 (e 113) dpy- 13 (+) ama- 1 (+) ]. The heteroallelic strains were sensitive to <b>amanitin,</b> and recombination events between the lethal mutations were specifically selected by means of the dominant <b>amanitin</b> resistance encoded on the recombinant chromosome. The segregation of outside markers revealed the left-right order of the lethal mutations. The position of mutations within the gene is nonrandom. Functional domains of the ama- 1 gene indicated by the various lethal phenotypes are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Qualitative and {{quantitative}} comparisons were conducted of commercially available immunodiagnostic devices {{for the detection}} of three select agents with oral LD 50 values $ 0. 1 mg/kg of body weight. Ricin (oral LD 50. 1 mg/kg), <b>amanitin</b> (oral LD 50 approximately 0. 1 mg/kg), and T- 2 toxin (oral LD 50. 1 mg/kg) were spiked into beverages, produce, dairy, and baked goods and assayed using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and lateral flow de-vices. In all cases, the commercial diagnostic kits successfully detected all three select agents at concentrations below what might be a health concern. The considerable difference between the limit of detection of the immunodiagnostic devices employed (typically # 0. 020 mg/g) and the amount of the select agent necessary to pose a health threat in a single serving of food facilitated the design of protocols for the high throughput screening of food samples. These protocols entailed simple extraction methods followed by sample dilution. Lateral flow devices and sandwich ELISAs {{for the detection of}} ricin had no significant background problems due to the food matrices. Competitive ELISAs, which typically have unacceptably high background reactions with food samples, successfully detected <b>amanitin</b> and T- 2 toxin. The ability to detect toxins quickly and accurately and with sufficient sensitivity is critical to ensure a safe food supply. The heterogeneous nature of food matrices compli...|$|E
40|$|More than 600 {{strains of}} wood-rotting fungi were {{screened}} {{for the detection}} of amanitins. Three strains of Galerina fasciculata and 18 strains of Galerina helvoliceps contained amanitins. These strains contained mainly α- and β-amanitins in the native fruit bodies, while α- and γ-amanitins were found in liquid-cultured mycelia. Purified amanitins were confirmed by their chromatographic profiles, spectra (UV, Fourier transform infrared, and atmospheric ionization mass), cytotoxicity for mammalian cell lines (3 T 3 and SiHa), and inhibitory effects on RNA polymerase II. The results revealed that the purified <b>amanitin</b> fractions from these species are identical to authentic amanitins and suggest that these two species must be handled as poisonous mushrooms...|$|E
