40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to research on genetic counseling by exploring {{the complexity of}} this activity from the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> identity <b>construction.</b> We argue that {{an analysis of the}} processes through which healthcare providers construct and negotiate their roles and identities in these encounters may contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the complexities of genetic counseling. Drawing on more than 150 video-recorded genetic counseling encounters between nurses and clients in Hong Kong, we illustrate that the discursive processes involved in the <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> the nurses' identities are complex, overlapping and at times contradictory as the nurses respond to the (sometimes) competing norms and expectations of their institution, their clients and their own. They manage to solve these tensions by drawing on the roles traditionally assigned to nurses in these encounters such as information provider and counselor, as well as creating the new roles of co-decision maker and cultural broker/mediator. ...|$|R

40|$|Supranational {{regionalisation}} – as {{initiated on}} {{the rubble of}} the Cold War – increases the complexity and multiplicity of a border’s functions. Novel institutional and functional developments structure border areas, making their analysis complicated. This paper aims to analyse this situation in terms of the structuring of border areas. It postulates that supranational regionalisation, such as the European integration process, contributes to the emergence of regionalisation processes at an infranational and transnational level. This paper presents a theoretical framework for a qualitative analysis, allowing cross-border cooperation to be read from the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> the <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> a region. A “region” is considered a spatio-temporal structure resulting from the evolution of society. This conceptualisation raises the question to what extent actual cross-border cooperation goes beyond the initial intentions of institutional actors to create a progressive autonomy. Two factors contribute to this process: the institutionalisation of the border area as an autonomous entity stimulating the development of the region under construction; the territorialisation of cooperation, i. e. the projection of a common strategy followed by an appropriation of the area...|$|R

Umezu (1980) classified sign system from the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> genesis and <b>construction</b> principle <b>of</b> signs. The sign system activity plays the central role in the self regulation activity of behaviors. Sign system consists of aboriginal sign system and constructive sign system. Constructive sign system consists of symbolic sign system and non-symbolic sign system. Symbolic sign system is constituted on similarity to the event. Non-symbolic sign system consists of gestalt-qualitative sign system and molecule-synthetic sign system. Non-symbolic sign system is constituted on the next principle. Though there are difference between the sign system and the event system, while children consider the sign system and the event system as the same thing, they operate the sign system. Symbolic sign system is more readily learned as a sign in a child due to its similarity to the event system. Non-symbolic. sign system is difficult to learn due to its constructive principle. It is usually most difficult to establish the molecular-synthetic sign system as signs, as there are many steps of learning to operate the molecular-synthetic sign system freely...|$|R
