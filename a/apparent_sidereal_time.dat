50|$|At {{the moment}} when the vernal equinox crosses the local {{meridian}}, local <b>apparent</b> <b>sidereal</b> <b>time</b> is 00:00. Greenwich <b>apparent</b> <b>sidereal</b> <b>time</b> (GAST) is the hour angle of the vernal equinox at the prime meridian at Greenwich, London.|$|E
5000|$|GAST is the Greenwich <b>{{apparent}}</b> <b>sidereal</b> <b>time</b> (the angle {{between the}} apparent vernal equinox and the meridian {{in the plane}} of the equator). This is a known function of UT.|$|E
50|$|The {{coordinate}} transformation {{between these}} two systems is described to good approximation by (<b>apparent)</b> <b>sidereal</b> <b>time,</b> which takes into account variations in the Earth's axial rotation (length-of-day variations). A more accurate description also takes polar motion into account, a phenomenon closely monitored by geodesists.|$|E
50|$|A clock's {{regulator}} can {{be adjusted}} so that it keeps the Mean <b>Sidereal</b> <b>Time</b> rate. When it is then set to an observer's Local Mean <b>Sidereal</b> <b>Time</b> then a star will transit the meridian (passing directly north or south) at the <b>sidereal</b> <b>time</b> of the star's Right Ascension.|$|R
50|$|Local <b>sidereal</b> <b>time</b> at any {{locality}} {{differs from}} the Greenwich <b>sidereal</b> <b>time</b> value of the same moment, by an amount that {{is proportional to the}} longitude of the locality. When one moves eastward 15° in longitude, <b>sidereal</b> <b>time</b> is larger by one sidereal hour (note that it wraps around at 24 hours). Unlike the reckoning of local solar time in time zones, incrementing by (usually) one hour, differences in local <b>sidereal</b> <b>time</b> are reckoned based on actual measured longitude, to the accuracy of the measurement of the longitude, not just in whole hours.|$|R
5000|$|Greenwich mean <b>sidereal</b> <b>time</b> (GMST) and UT1 {{differ from}} each other in rate, with the second of <b>sidereal</b> <b>time</b> a little shorter than that of UT1, so that (as at 12:00 noon on 2000 January 1) [...] s of mean <b>sidereal</b> <b>time</b> was equal to 1 s of UT1. The ratio varies {{slightly}} with time, reaching [...] after a century.|$|R
50|$|Sidereal time, at {{any moment}} (and at a given {{locality}} defined by its geographical longitude), more precisely local <b>apparent</b> <b>sidereal</b> <b>time</b> (LAST), {{is defined as the}} hour angle of the vernal equinox at that locality: it has the same value as the right ascension of any celestial body that is crossing the local meridian at that same moment.|$|E
50|$|<b>Apparent</b> <b>sidereal</b> <b>time</b> (local or at Greenwich) {{differs from}} {{mean sidereal time}} (for the same {{locality}} and moment) by the equation of the equinoxes: {{this is a small}} difference in right ascension (dRA) parallel to the equator, not exceeding about ±1.2 s, due to nutation, the complex 'nodding' motion of Earth's polar axis of rotation. It corresponds to the current amount of the nutation in (ecliptic) longitude (dψ) and to the current obliquity (ε) of the ecliptic, so that dRA = dψ cos ε.|$|E
50|$|In the sky, the {{meridian}} is {{the imaginary}} {{north to south}} line that goes through the point directly overhead (the zenith). The right ascension of any object crossing the meridian {{is equal to the}} current local (<b>apparent)</b> <b>sidereal</b> <b>time,</b> ignoring for present purposes that part of the circumpolar region north of the north celestial pole (for an observer in the northern hemisphere) or south of the south celestial pole (for an observer in the southern hemisphere) that is crossing the meridian the other way.|$|E

50|$|<b>Sidereal</b> <b>time</b> is used at astronomical {{observatories}} because <b>sidereal</b> <b>time</b> {{makes it}} very easy to work out which astronomical objects will be observable at a given time.

50|$|<b>Sidereal</b> <b>time</b> is {{time by the}} stars. A sidereal {{rotation}} is {{the time}} it takes the Earth to make one revolution with respect to the stars, approximately 23 hours 56 minutes 4 seconds. For accurate astronomical work on land, it was usual to observe <b>sidereal</b> <b>time</b> rather than solar time to measure mean solar time, because the observations of 'fixed' stars could be measured and reduced more accurately than observations of the Sun (in spite of the need to make various small compensations, for refraction, aberration, precession, nutation and proper motion). It is well known that observations of the Sun pose substantial obstacles to the achievement of accuracy in measurement. In former times, before the distribution of accurate time signals, {{it was part of the}} routine work at any observatory to observe the <b>sidereal</b> <b>times</b> of meridian transit of selected 'clock stars' (of well-known position and movement), and to use these to correct observatory clocks running local mean sidereal time; but nowadays local <b>sidereal</b> <b>time</b> is usually generated by computer, based on time signals.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: <b>Sidereal</b> <b>Time</b> {{literally}} means star time. The time we {{are used}} to using in our everyday lives is Solar Time. Astronomy, time based upon the rotation of the earth with respect to the distant stars, the sidereal day being the unit of measurement. Traditionally, the sidereal day is described as the time it takes for the Earth to complete one rotation relative to the stars, and help astronomers to keep them telescops directions on a given star in a night sky. In other words, earth’s rate of rotation determine according to fixed stars which is controlling the <b>time</b> scale of <b>sidereal</b> <b>time.</b> Many reserachers are concerned about how long the earth takes to spin based on fixed stars since the earth does not actually spin around 360 degrees in one solar day. Furthermore, the computations of the <b>sidereal</b> <b>time</b> needs {{to take a long time}} to calculate the number of the Julian centuries. This paper shows a new method of calculating the <b>Sidereal</b> <b>Time,</b> which is very important to determine the stars location at any given time. In addition, this method provdes high accuracy results with short time of calculation...|$|R

50|$|From a given {{observation}} point, a star {{found at}} one {{location in the}} sky will {{be found at the}} same location on another night at the same <b>sidereal</b> <b>time.</b> This is similar to how the time kept by a sundial can be used to find the location of the Sun. Just as the Sun and Moon appear to rise in the east and set in the west due to the rotation of Earth, so do the stars. Both solar <b>time</b> and <b>sidereal</b> <b>time</b> make use of the regularity of Earth's rotation about its polar axis, solar time following the Sun while <b>sidereal</b> <b>time</b> roughly follows the stars. More exactly, <b>sidereal</b> <b>time</b> is the angle, measured from the observer's meridian, along the celestial equator, to the great circle that passes through the March equinox and both poles, and is usually expressed in hours, minutes, and seconds. Common time on a typical clock measures a slightly longer cycle, accounting not only for Earth's axial rotation but also for Earth's annual revolution around the Sun of slightly less than 1 degree per day (in fact to the nearest arcsecond, it takes 365.2422 days to revolve, therefore 360 degrees/365.2422 days = 0.9856° or 59′ 8″ per day, i.e., slightly less than 1 degree per day).|$|R

In the previous analysis (Scholkmann, Prog. in Phys., 2014, v. 10 (4), 232 – 235) it could be shown that the anisotropy data contain a diurnal and annual peri- odicity.

50|$|When {{a signal}} under study {{is smaller than}} the {{rounding}} error of measurement and data are over-averaged , a positive result may be found where none exists (i.e. a more precise experimental apparatus would conclusively show no signal).
