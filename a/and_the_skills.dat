5|$|Isidore van Kinsbergen {{was known}} as a perfectionist. During his work in Borobudur, he {{selected}} the statues and panels which had been preserved best to take pictures of. He preferred a non-frontal angle, which shows a better depth of the relief <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>skills</b> of the relief maker. To stress its timeless beauty, van Kinsbergen blocked out the original background in the negative film instead of putting up a black curtain during photographing.|$|E
5|$|Combat is turn-based, {{with each}} {{character}} in the player's party receiving action points {{at the beginning of}} the player's turn. The number received is dependent on the items the player character has equipped <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>skills</b> the character or creations possess. Each action uses a specific number of points, for example, moving one square takes a single point and attacks or spells take five. Attacking or spellcasting with fewer than ten action points immediately ends the character's turn, otherwise a character can continue to act until they run out of points. Most enemies will attack the player on sight, retreating in terror if they reach a certain threshold of damage without being killed. Other specialized behaviors are also present, including creatures which call for help, or creatures which act as sentries and retreat to an ambush location when threatened. Creations made by the player character can also be controlled by a similar artificial intelligence, or the player can invest more essence in the creation's intelligence and control them manually.|$|E

25|$|Structural {{unemployment}} {{covers a}} variety of possible causes of unemployment including a mismatch between workers' skills <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>skills</b> required for open jobs. Large amounts of structural unemployment can occur when an economy is transitioning industries and workers find their previous set of skills {{are no longer in}} demand. Structural unemployment is similar to frictional unemployment since both reflect the problem of matching workers with job vacancies, but structural unemployment covers the time needed to acquire new skills not just the short term search process.|$|E

25|$|Between 1993 and 1996, the FBI {{increased}} its counter-terrorism {{role in the}} wake of the first 1993 World Trade Center bombing in New York City, New York; the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; and the arrest of the Unabomber in 1996. Technological innovation <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>skills</b> of FBI Laboratory analysts helped ensure that the three cases were successfully prosecuted. But Justice Department investigations into the FBI's roles in the Ruby Ridge and Waco incidents were found to have been obstructed by agents within the Bureau. During the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia, the FBI was criticized for its investigation of the Centennial Olympic Park bombing. It has settled a dispute with Richard Jewell, who was a private security guard at the venue, along with some media organizations, in regard to the leaking of his name during the investigation; this had briefly led to his being wrongly suspected of the bombing.|$|E

As a junior, he averaged 22.3 points per game, 6.6 rebounds per game, 4.4 assists per game, and 2.0 steals per game; led his school to sectional championship; and {{was named to the}} All-State Underclass First Team. As a senior, Jackson averaged 25.9 points, 5.7 rebounds, 2.9 assists, and 2.6 steals per game, finishing as runner-up for the Indiana Mr. Basketball to Zak Irvin. He concluded his career at Marian as the all-time leading scorer in St. Joseph County with 1,934 career points. His performances with Marian earned him a selection for the 2013 McDonald's All-American Boys Game, and he was the first Northern Indiana native to receive this honor since Shawn Kemp in 1988. Jackson finished the game with 5 points, 4 assists, and 2 steals and won the Jack Daly Sportmanship Award <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Skills</b> Competition.|$|E
25|$|The Szepes county (today:Spiš region) prospered {{not only}} from being {{situated}} on trade routes, but also from its natural resources of wood, agriculture and, until relatively recent times, mining. In the 15th century and later, iron, copper and silver were all exploited {{in the south of}} the region. Its relative wealth during this period, and its mixture of nationalities and religions, resulted in it becoming a major cultural centre – many schools were founded, and the town of Lőcse (present-day Levoča) became a major centre for printing in the 17th century. The buildings and churches of the region's towns, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>skills</b> of schools such as those of the carver Master Paul of Levoča testify to this affluence and culture. Until the end of the 17th century, the area was often disrupted by wars, uprisings against the Habsburgs, and epidemics (a plague of 1710/1711 killed over 20,000). But from the 18th century onwards, relative stability enabled faster economic development. Many craft guilds were founded {{and by the end of}} the 18th century over 500 iron mines were operative in the south.|$|E
500|$|Reactivating the {{battleship}}s {{would require}} {{a wide range of}} battleship modernization improvements, according to the navy's program management office. At a minimum, these modernization improvements include command and control, communications, computers, and intelligence equipment; environmental protection (including ozone-depleting substances); a plastic-waste processor; pulper/shredder and wastewater alterations; firefighting/fire safety and women-at-sea alterations; a modernized sensor suite (air and surface search radar); and new combat and self-defense systems. The navy's program management office also identified other issues that would strongly discourage the Navy from reactivating and modernizing the battleships. For example, personnel needed to operate the battleships would be extensive, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>skills</b> needed may not be available or easily reconstituted. Other issues include the age and unreliability of the battleships' propulsion systems {{and the fact that the}} navy no longer maintains the capability to manufacture their [...] gun system components and ordnance.|$|E

500|$|On her arrival, Susan was {{described}} as being [...] "staid" [...] and more open-minded than her husband, Karl. Woodburne told the Soap Show that Susan is a [...] "good mum" [...] who means well. Her children are her number one priority and she overcompensate's for her husband's disciplinarian style.

Network Ten say that Susan is the [...] "heart and soul of Erinsborough", with a good sense of humour <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>skills</b> of a ninja. Susan has been through a [...] "rough ride". She has had to cope with Karl's infidelity, a divorce, her second husband dying hours after their wedding, being betrayed by her nephew and revealing that she killed her mother. TV Week said [...] "But, through it all, Susan has often provided a home for people in trouble, including a number of the Timmins kids and the kids of her dead husband."

500|$|Altogether, Ripken spent 36 {{years in}} the Baltimore Orioles organization, serving as a player, a scout, a coach, and a manager.

The Baltimore Sun wrote, [...] "Most Baltimore fans couldn't define the term exactly, but they liked that it implied reverence for the sport <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>skills</b> needed to play it well." [...] Elrod Hendricks, another longtime Oriole coach who {{kept in touch with}} Ripken throughout the years, said [...] "He was baseball and baseball was him." [...] Sam Perlozzo, who like Ripken spent many years as a third base coach, said [...] "When you were around him, you didn't say much. One reason was out of respect. The other was because you could learn from him, no matter how long you had been in the game." [...] Despite his 36 years with the organization, only a little more than one of them were as manager of the team, causing Thomas Boswell to write, [...] "The idea that a person could find deep satisfaction through fulfilling difficult responsibilities – while never focusing on personal rewards – seems antique these days. Yet Ripken's example makes you wonder if the century, not Senior, has lost its way." [...] Since his death, no Oriole has worn Cal Sr.'s number 7, although the number has not been officially retired.|$|E
