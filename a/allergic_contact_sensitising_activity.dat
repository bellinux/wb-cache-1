40|$|<b>Allergic</b> <b>contact</b> {{dermatitis}} is a T cell-mediated delayed type {{hypersensitivity reaction}} that occurs upon hapten challenge in sensitized individuals. The inflammatory response in classical <b>allergic</b> <b>contact</b> dermatitis requires both a sensitization phase and an elicitation phase responsible for the recruitment and activation of specific T cells {{at the site of}} hapten skin challenge. Conversely, previously unsensitized patients may develop a “primary <b>allergic</b> <b>contact</b> dermatitis” after the first skin contact with potent contact sensitizers leading to a skin inflammation with all the features of classical <b>allergic</b> <b>contact</b> dermatitis. In this study we used an experimental murine model, referred to as contact hypersensitivity, to study the pathophysiology of primary <b>allergic</b> <b>contact</b> dermatitis and its relationship to classical <b>allergic</b> <b>contact</b> dermatitis. We show that one epicutaneous application of a nonirritant dose of hapten (2, 4 -dini-trofluorobenzene, fluorescein isothiocyanate) was sufficient to induce an optimal <b>allergic</b> <b>contact</b> dermatitis reaction at the site of primary contact with the hapten without subsequent challenge. As in classical <b>allergic</b> <b>contact</b> dermatitis, the skin inflammation in primary <b>allergic</b> <b>contact</b> dermatitis was mediated by interferon-γ producing, CD 8 + effector T cells that were induced in the draining lymph nodes at day 5 postsensitization and downregulated by CD 4 + T cells. Reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that the primary <b>allergic</b> <b>contact</b> dermatitis reaction was mediated by a recruitment of CD 8 + T cells at the sensitization skin site at day 6 postsensitization. Analysis of the fate of the hapten fluorescein isothiocyanate applied once on the skin revealed its persistence in the epidermis for up to 14 d after skin painting. These results suggest that the development of primary <b>allergic</b> <b>contact</b> dermatitis (i. e., without secondary challenge) is associated with persistence of the hapten in the skin, which allows the recruitment and activation of CD 8 + T cells {{at the site of the}} single hapten application...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND AND DESIGN: Topical {{antibiotics}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} common causes of <b>allergic</b> <b>contact</b> dermatitis and are frequently used in postoperative wound care. We prospectively followed up patients having cutaneous surgery to determine the frequency of <b>allergic</b> <b>contact</b> dermatitis to topical antibiotics used on postoperative wound care. RESULTS: Nine (4. 2 %) of 215 patients who had undergone surgery who were using a topical antibiotic had an eruption develop postoperatively that was consistent with an <b>allergic</b> <b>contact</b> dermatitis from the topical antibiotic. Seven of the nine patients agreed to patch testing with the standard tray and selected topical antibiotics. Five patients had a positive patch test to neomycin sulfate and four had a positive patch test to bacitracin. The frequency of <b>allergic</b> <b>contact</b> dermatitis proved by patch testing to neomycin and bacitracin is five (5. 3 %) of 94 and four (2 %) of 198, respectively, in the patients who used these antibiotics. All proved sensitivities to bacitracin occurred in patients using a topical antibiotic that also contained neomycin and were patch tested positive to the neomycin. No patients using only pure bacitracin had <b>allergic</b> <b>contact</b> dermatitis. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Allergic</b> <b>contact</b> dermatitis to a topical antibiotic, especially neomycin, should be considered in any patient who has development of a dermatitis after cutaneous surgery. Because of the frequency of <b>allergic</b> <b>contact</b> dermatitis, neomycin-containing antibiotics should be avoided in postoperative wound care...|$|R
40|$|<b>Allergic</b> <b>contact</b> {{dermatitis}} is a prototypic T-cell-mediated cutaneous inflammatory response. Multiple cell types, inflammatory mediators and cytokines {{are involved}} in the regulation of immunologic and inflammatory processes in <b>allergic</b> <b>contact</b> dermatitis. Aloperine is an isolated alkaloid found in the plant of Sophora alopecuroides L. It has been clinically proved effective in China for a long time for skin inflammatory diseases such as <b>allergic</b> <b>contact</b> dermatitis. However, the mechanism of aloperine on <b>allergic</b> <b>contact</b> dermatitis is largely unknown. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of aloperine on 2, 4 -dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) -induced <b>allergic</b> <b>contact</b> dermatitis in BALB/c mice and the possible underlying mechanisms. The results showed that topical application of DNFB on the car provoked typical <b>allergic</b> <b>contact</b> dermatitis with ear swelling and ear erythema in BALB/c mice. Treatments with 1 % aloperine suppressed DNFB-induced increase in ear thickness and ear erythema. Moreover, 1 % aloperine treatment significantly decreased the up-regulated mRNA and protein levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 beta) and interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) induced by DNFB in ear biopsy homogenates. Our findings suggest that aloperine greatly improves the DNFB-induced <b>allergic</b> <b>contact</b> dermatitis in mice. The therapeutic mechanism might be related to the reduction of TNF-alpha, IL- 1 beta and IL- 6 production induced by DNFB. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

Skin biopsies from allergic (13 cases) and sodium lauryl sulfate-induced irritant patch test reactions (13 cases), obtained 1 – 72 [*]h after patch testing, were studied {{by means of an}} in situ hybridization technique. Results of chemokine mRNA expression were correlated with clinical scoring, histology, and immunohistochemical data including the proportion of inflammatory cells expressing CXCR 3, the receptor for IP- 10, Mig, and IP- 9, and ICAM- 1 and HLA-DR expression on keratinocytes. IP- 10, Mig, and IP- 9 mRNA were detected in seven of nine <b>allergic</b> <b>contact</b> dermatitis reactions after 24 – 72 [*]h, but not in sodium lauryl sulfate-induced irritant contact dermatitis reactions. ICAM- 1 expression by keratinocytes was only found in <b>allergic</b> <b>contact</b> dermatitis reactions and correlated with chemokine expression. Moreover, up to 50 % of the infiltrating cells in <b>allergic</b> <b>contact</b> dermatitis expressed CXCR 3, in contrast to only 20 % in irritant contact dermatitis reactions.

40|$|<b>Allergic</b> <b>contact</b> {{dermatitis}} is a T cell-mediated immune response, {{which in}} its relapsing chronic form is of high socioeconomic impact. The phosphoglycoprotein osteopontin (OPN) has chemotactic and Th 1 cytokine functions and in various models {{is essential for}} robust T cell-mediated immunity. Here we demonstrate that OPN is abundantly expressed by both effector T cells and keratinocytes in <b>allergic</b> <b>contact</b> dermatitis lesions. T cells from nickel-allergic donors secrete high levels of OPN following antigen-specific stimulation. OPN may substitute for missing IFN-γ secretion in T effector cells because low IFN-γ-producing T cell clones secrete high levels of OPN, and OPN down-modulates their interleukin- 4 expression. Furthermore, interferon-γ from T effector cells augments OPN in <b>allergic</b> <b>contact</b> dermatitis by inducing OPN in keratinocytes, which in turn polarizes dendritic cells and attracts inflammatory cells. In the murine contact hypersensitivity (CHS) model for <b>allergic</b> <b>contact</b> dermatitis, OPN is strongly induced in antigen-specific proliferating T cells, and OPN null mice display a reduced chronic CHS inflammatory response due to a decreased influx of effector T cells. Importantly, because of its function for chronic <b>allergic</b> <b>contact</b> dermatitis, OPN {{may well be a}} therapeutic target, because anti-OPN antibody treatment in part suppresses established chronic CHS...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThere is {{continued}} interest in, and imperatives for, {{the classification}} of contact allergens according to their relative skin sensitising potency. However, achieving that end can prove problematic, not least {{when there is an}} apparent lack of concordance between experimental assessments of potency and the prevalence <b>allergic</b> <b>contact</b> dermatitis as judged by clinical experience. For the purpose of exploring this issue, and illustrating the important considerations that are required to reach sound judgements about potency categorisation, the lower alkyl methacrylate esters (LAM) have been employed here as a case study. Although the sensitising potential of methyl methacrylate (MMA) has been reviewed previously, there is available new information that is relevant for assessment of skin sensitising potency. Moreover, {{for the purposes of this}} article, analyses have been extended to include also other LAM for which relevant data are available: ethyl methacrylate (EMA), n-butyl methacrylate (nBMA), isobutyl methacrylate (iBMA), and 2 -ethylhexyl methacrylate (EHMA). In addressing the skin <b>sensitising</b> <b>activity</b> of these chemicals and in drawing conclusions regarding relative potency, a number of sources of information has been considered, including estimates of potency derived from local lymph node assay (LLNA) data, the results of guinea pig assays, and data derived from in silico methods and from recently developed in vitro approaches. Moreover, clinical experience of skin sensitisation of humans by LAM has also been evaluated. The conclusion drawn is that MMA and other LAM are contact allergens, but that none of these chemicals has any more than weak skin sensitising potency. We have also explored here the possible bases for this modest <b>sensitising</b> <b>activity.</b> Finally, the nature of exposure to LAM has been reviewed briefly and on the basis of that information, together with an understanding of skin sensitising potency, a risk assessment has been prepared...|$|R
