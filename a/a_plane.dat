5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>planer</b> is <b>a</b> type of {{metalworking}} {{machine tool}} that uses [...] relative motion between the workpiece and a {{single-point cutting tool}} to cut the work piece. <b>A</b> <b>planer</b> {{is similar to a}} shaper, but larger, and with workpiece moving, whereas in a shaper the cutting tool moves.|$|R
5|$|The {{bill for}} the plane {{remained}} unpaid. In 1914 Vickers reminded Mawson, who had apparently forgotten the outstanding debt. Mawson wrote to Vickers director Sir Trevor Dawson in November 1916, requesting the company write off the bill as a donation. His company buoyed by armaments contracts, Dawson agreed. The next expedition to take <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> to the Antarctic was Shackleton's 1921–22 Quest Expedition, but the Avro Baby remained grounded owing to missing parts. Not until 16November 1928—when Hubert Wilkins and Carl Ben Eielson flew for 20minutes around Deception Island, {{just over a year}} before Admiral Richard Evelyn Byrd's first flight over the South Pole—was <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> airborne in the Antarctic.|$|E

5|$|Theros was <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> {{inspired}} by Greek mythology, containing many references to Greek mythological {{figures such as}} Prometheus and the pantheon of gods. Tarkir would have been <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> where dragons had long since died, controlled by five clans ruled by khans. Through time travel, {{the result of the}} struggle between the ancient clans and the dragons was reversed and the dragons now reign over each of the five clans, which are both similar and different to their alternate-timeline predecessors.|$|E
25|$|The {{frontal plane}} or coronal plane divides the body into dorsal and ventral (back and front, or {{posterior}} and anterior) portions. For post-embryonic humans <b>a</b> coronal <b>plane</b> is vertical and <b>a</b> transverse <b>plane</b> is horizontal, but for embryos and quadrupeds <b>a</b> coronal <b>plane</b> is horizontal and <b>a</b> transverse <b>plane</b> is vertical. <b>A</b> longitudinal <b>plane</b> is any plane {{perpendicular to the}} transverse plane. The coronal plane and the sagittal plane are examples of longitudinal planes.|$|R

5|$|A deeper analogy relates tidal {{forces with}} a {{property}} of surfaces called curvature. For gravitational fields, the absence or presence of tidal forces determines {{whether or not}} the influence of gravity can be eliminated by choosing a freely falling reference frame. Similarly, the absence or presence of curvature determines whether or not a surface is equivalent to <b>a</b> <b>plane.</b> In the summer of 1912, inspired by these analogies, Einstein searched for a geometric formulation of gravity.|$|E
5|$|A {{tessellation}} of a {{flat surface}} is the tiling of <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> using one or more geometric shapes, called tiles, with no overlaps and no gaps. In mathematics, tessellations can be generalized to higher dimensions {{and a variety of}} geometries.|$|E
5|$|After 1971, {{particularly}} {{after the release}} of Fireball, Gillan started to become disillusioned with the workload of the band, who had not had any holiday since their initial rehearsals at Hanwell. He started drinking, and relationships between him {{and the rest of the}} band became strained, particularly with Blackmore. On 6 November 1971, he collapsed with hepatitis while waiting to board <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> in Chicago, cancelling the remainder of a US tour.|$|E

5|$|At {{the airport}} bar, Brian gets very drunk and, when Stewie comes to {{retrieve}} him, their plane tickets are stolen. They {{stop at a}} rundown motel, where Stewie tries calling home, but fails because he believes his phone number is 867-5309. The next day, they have to escape and hotwire a car because their credit card was rejected. To get home, Stewie and Brian masquerade as crop dusters to steal <b>a</b> <b>plane,</b> which they immediately destroy.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} it was {{purchased}} by the wife of the Togolese Minister in 2011, there had been preparations to salvage the plane for its aluminium. The plane was converted and re-opened as a restaurant on 11 November 2013 as a public-private partnership between the Ghana Airport Company Limited and Vindira Company Limited. It {{is the first time that}} <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> based restaurant has opened in Africa.|$|E
