The economic disparity between the village and urban schools resulted in imposing many social barriers on aborigines, which prevent many from moving beyond vocational training. Students transplanted into urban schools face adversity, including isolation, culture shock, <b>and</b> <b>discrimination</b> from their peers. The cultural impact of poverty and economic marginalization has led to an increase in alcoholism and prostitution among aborigines.|$|E

Periyar also argued that birds, animals, and worms, which are considered to be devoid of rationalism do not create castes, or differences of high and low in their own species.

5|$|As {{a result}} of the Civil Rights Movement {{challenging}} the restrictions <b>and</b> <b>discrimination</b> practiced against blacks exercise of constitutional rights, a series of US Supreme Court cases, beginning with Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, the 24th Amendment, and federal legislation: the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 had overturned the most controversial aspects of the 1902 Constitution – the provisions restricting voting by African Americans and mandating school segregation. Combined with the election of Governor Mills Godwin in 1965, there was impetus for governmental change. Godwin strongly advocated the loosening of the strict constitutional restrictions on state-issued bonds and borrowing, and used his power and popularity to push for a new constitution. In 1968 a joint resolution of the Virginia General Assembly approved a new commission, chaired by former Governor Albertis Harrison, to revise the constitution.|$|E

The growing Civil Rights Movement used nonviolence to confront segregation <b>and</b> <b>discrimination,</b> with Martin Luther King Jr. becoming a prominent leader and figurehead. A combination of court decisions and legislation, culminating in the Civil Rights Act of 1968, sought to end racial discrimination.

5000|$|Feierabend's {{original}} research, {{conducted in}} his time at Temple University, is entitled The Effects of Specific Tonal Pattern Training On Singing <b>and</b> Aural <b>Discrimination</b> Abilities of First Grade Children. [...] In this study, Feierabend investigated the outcomes of singing <b>and</b> aural <b>discrimination.</b> Four groups of children were taught pre-determined amalgamations of tonal patterns that were either easy to sing and easy to aurally discriminate, or patterns that were more difficult to sing <b>and</b> aurally <b>discrimination.</b> This test lasted for five minutes over the series of seven weeks. After analysis, evidence showed that that singing <b>and</b> aural <b>discrimination</b> abilities become more similar in students that echo patterns {{that are easy to}} sing. This research suggests better singing skills are fostered in children who echo patterns varied in singing difficulty, <b>and</b> aural <b>discrimination</b> abilities are improved if echoed patterns are easy to sing.|$|R
40|$|Experiences <b>and</b> {{expectations}} of <b>discrimination</b> (anticipated discrimination) may delay treatment seeking {{among people with}} substance use disorders. In addition, experienced <b>and</b> anticipated <b>discrimination</b> can be a barrier to successful recovery and rehabilitation. The {{aim of this study}} was to study the level of experienced and anticipated (the expectation to be rejected) discrimination among individuals in treatment for substance use disorders as well as the association between both concepts of discrimination. In addition, the association of experienced <b>and</b> anticipated <b>discrimination</b> with clinical <b>and</b> social characteristics was investigated. A cross-sectional survey among individuals in treatment for substance use disorders in the Netherlands was carried out in 2012. Individuals in treatment (N = 186) completed a self-reported questionnaire about experienced <b>and</b> anticipated <b>discrimination.</b> Descriptive statistics <b>and</b> chi-squared analyses were performed to investigate the level of experienced <b>and</b> anticipated <b>discrimination</b> <b>and</b> the association between both concepts. Linear regression analyses were used to investigate the association with clinical and social characteristics, such as occupational status and type of treatment. Individuals in treatment for substance use disorders reported high levels of experienced <b>and</b> anticipated <b>discrimination.</b> Respondents experienced most discrimination in family ties, intimate relationships and friendships. Experienced <b>and</b> anticipated <b>discrimination</b> were both positively correlated. Having complex substance use problems and a longer history of substance use problems was related to higher levels of experienced discrimination. In conclusion, experienced <b>and</b> anticipated <b>discrimination</b> were highly prevalent among individuals in treatment for substance use disorders. Attention in addiction treatment for adequate coping with discrimination may be needed in order to achieve successful social participation and rehabilitation of these individuals...|$|R

Over time, persecution of Zoroastrians became more common and widespread, and the number of believers decreased significantly. Many converted, some superficially, to escape the systematic abuse <b>and</b> <b>discrimination</b> by the law of the land. Others accepted Islam because their employment in industrial and artisan work would, according to Zoroastrian dogma, make them impure as their work involved defiling fire.

The present experiment seeks to extend the research on stimulus equivalence training structures by using a within-subject design and adult human subjects.
