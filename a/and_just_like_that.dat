40|$|ABSTRACT: Although insulin and insulin-like {{growth factor}} 1 (IGF- 1) share {{homologous}} sequence, similar tertiary structure, weakly overlapped biological activity, {{and a common}} ancestor, the two highly homologous sequences encode different folding behavior: insulin folds into one unique stable tertiary structure while IGF- 1 folds into two disulfide isomers with similar thermodynamic stability. To further elucidate the molecular mechanism of their different folding behavior, we prepared two single-chain hybrids of insulin and IGF- 1, Ins(A) /IGF- 1 (B) and Ins(B) /IGF- 1 (A), as well as a mini-IGF- 1 by means of protein engineering and studied their structure as well as folding behavior. Both mini-IGF- 1 and Ins(A) /IGF- 1 (B) fold into two thermodynamically stable disulfide isomers in vivo <b>and</b> in vitro <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of IGF- 1, while Ins(B) / IGF- 1 (A) folds into one unique thermodynamically stable tertiary structure in vivo <b>and</b> in vitro <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of insulin. So we deduce that the different folding behavior of insulin and IGF- 1 is mainly controlled by their B-chain/domain. By V 8 endoproteinase digestion and circular dichroism analysis, as well as insulin receptor binding assay, we deduce that Ins(B) /IGF- 1 (A), isomer 2 of mini-IGF- 1, and isomer 2 of Ins(A) /IGF- 1 (B) adopt native IGF- 1 /insulin-like three-dimensional structure with native disulfides, while isomer 1 of mini-IGF- 1 and isomer 1 of Ins(A) /IGF- 1 (B) adopt the swap IGF- 1 -like three-dimensional structure with swap disulfides...|$|R

50|$|Malanday {{was named}} after the shape of its territory, round <b>and</b> flat, <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of a bilao (winnower).

Mainly an agricultural area, Malanday was originally an uncultivated grassland that formed part of a rural community that would be known later for its rice field. To reach the place, pioneers had to transport and deliver commodities using the carabao-drawn cariton, given its ease in negotiating mud tracks. For Malanday residents, 1937 holds a special significance - {{it was the year}} they were released from the bondage of paying land taxes to the Tuasons, owner of most of the lands in Marikina. As a result, petitions for transfer of land ownership were filed. In response, the government bought a big portion of a vast estate and distributed it to occupants, requiring only the beneficiaries to pay a nominal amount for every square meter of land owned over a period of one decade. This development would give rise to the founding of Barangay Malanday.|$|R
