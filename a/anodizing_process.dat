The authors have built a special experimental setup which allows a local temperature measurement across the interface. The results show the possibility of local resolved temperature measurements and the calculation of the heat flow into the metal and the anodizing bath. Based on this knowledge a target control of the current-voltage-regime avoids the formation of thermally caused cracks in hard anodized layers...|$|R

These new anodized coatings are often claimed to perform better than the traditional ones obtained through older <b>anodizing</b> <b>processes,</b> such as DOW 17 or HAE.

50|$|Anodizing {{was first}} used on an {{industrial}} scale in 1923 to protect Duralumin seaplane parts from corrosion. This early chromic acid-based process was called the Bengough-Stuart process and was documented in British defence specification DEF STAN 03-24/3. It is still used today despite its legacy requirements for a complicated voltage cycle now known to be unnecessary. Variations of this process soon evolved, and the first sulfuric acid <b>anodizing</b> <b>process</b> was patented by Gower and O'Brien in 1927. Sulfuric acid soon became and remains the most common anodizing electrolyte.|$|E
5000|$|The oldest <b>anodizing</b> <b>process</b> uses chromic acid. It {{is widely}} {{known as the}} Bengough-Stuart process. In North America it is known as Type I {{because it is so}} {{designated}} by the MIL-A-8625 standard, but it is also covered by AMS 2470 and MIL-A-8625 Type IB. In the UK it is normally specified as Def Stan 03/24 and used in areas that are prone to come into contact with propellants etc. There are also Boeing and Airbus standards. Chromic acid produces thinner, 0.5 μm to 18 μm (0.00002" [...] to 0.0007") more opaque films that are softer, ductile, and to a degree self-healing. They are harder to dye and may be applied as a pretreatment before painting. The method of film formation is different from using sulfuric acid in that the voltage is ramped up through the process cycle.|$|E

50|$|In typical {{commercial}} aluminium <b>anodizing</b> <b>processes,</b> the aluminium oxide is grown {{down into the}} surface and out from the surface by equal amounts. So anodizing will increase the part dimensions on each surface by half the oxide thickness. For example, a coating that is 2 μm thick will increase the part dimensions by 1 μm per surface. If the part is anodized on all sides, then all linear dimensions will increase by the oxide thickness. Anodized aluminium surfaces are harder than aluminium but have low to moderate wear resistance, although this can be improved with thickness and sealing.|$|R

40|$|The present work {{concerns}} on preparing suitable {{titanium alloy}} substrate that might induce better characteristic of titanium oxide layer on the substrate. Different degrees of cold rolling treatments were applied on Ti 6 Al 4 V alloy before thermal-electrochemical anodizing processes.

In the as machined condition, test results showed that fatigue life is surface roughness dependent and that fatigue life decreases {{with an increase in}} surface roughness and this effect is found to be more pronounced in high cycle fatigue where major portion of fatigue life is consumed in nucleating the cracks. Effects of pretreatments, like degreasing and pickling employed prior to anodizing, on fatigue life of the given alloy were also studied. Results demonstrated that degreasing showed no change in fatigue life while pickling had negative impact on fatigue life of specimens. The small decrease in fatigue life of anodized specimens as compare to pickled specimens is attributed to brittle and microcracking of the coating. Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) examination revealed multi-site crack initiation for the pickled and anodized specimens. SEM examination showed that pickling solution attacked the grain boundaries and intermetallic inclusions present on the surface resulting in pits formation. These pits are of primary concern with respect to accelerated fatigue crack nucleation and subsequent anodized coating formation...|$|R
