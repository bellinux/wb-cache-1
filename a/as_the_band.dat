5|$|The band's live {{performances}} at large venues {{such as the}} Sydney Entertainment Centre was criticised by some fans, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>band</b> had previously stated they disliked playing to large crowds. Drummer Jon Coghill {{said he was not}} bothered by the comments, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>band</b> (other than guitarist Ian Haug) generally did not take much note of such critique.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} for {{the album was}} generally favorable, with several reviewers pointing {{out the fact that}} it highly resembled the band's debut album. Critics also said the album was less groundbreaking than their debut but had humorous and enjoyable pieces. The album peaked at 148 on the Billboard 200 despite its critical acclaim as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>band</b> members expecting more commercial success.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, thrash {{achieved}} breakout success, challenging and redefining the metal mainstream. Metallica's self-titled 1991 album topped the Billboard chart, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>band</b> established international following. Megadeth's Countdown to Extinction (1992) debuted at number two, Anthrax and Slayer cracked the top 10, and albums by regional bands such as Testament and Sepultura entered the top 100.|$|E

5|$|Later Mustaine {{announced}} that the band was preparing to start work on the album, and suggested early 2013 as a tentative release, on a new label, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>band</b> had split from their previous label, Roadrunner Records.

5|$|Wavering Radiant is {{the fifth}} and final {{full-length}} album by American post-metal group Isis, released by Ipecac Recordings in 2009 and produced by Joe Barresi. It stands as Isis' last full-length album, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>band</b> split {{just over a year}} after its release. The album continues Isis' history of lengthy songwriting, yet presents a slight departure from the soft-loud dynamics and post-metal aesthetic which characterized previous releases.|$|E

5|$|Weezer {{recorded}} The Kitchen Tapes as {{an attempt}} to create a buzz around L.A. The band eventually attracted attention from major-label A reps looking for alternative rock bands while performing on the same bill <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>band</b> That Dog.

5|$|Badmotorfinger was Soundgarden's {{first album}} with bassist Ben Shepherd, {{who joined the}} group in April 1990. Shepherd {{replaced}} previous bassist Jason Everman. The album was recorded {{in the spring of}} 1991 at Studio D in Sausalito, California, Bear Creek Studios in Woodinville, Washington, and A Studios in Los Angeles, California. Soundgarden chose to work with producer Terry Date again as it had on its previous release Louder Than Love (1989). Frontman Chris Cornell said the band decided to work with Date again seeing <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>band</b> had a good relationship with him {{and did not want to}} go through the pressure of trying to find a new producer.|$|E

It was recorded on January 1, 1970, at the Fillmore East in New York City with Billy Cox on bass and Buddy Miles on drums, frequently referred to <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Band</b> of Gypsys.

5|$|Following {{several years}} of {{relative}} inactivity <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>band</b> maintained their relaxed touring pace, Perry began writing material for a new Daddies album in early 2006, claiming to {{have come to the}} realization of a cathartic reliance on songwriting. In an April 2006 radio interview, he confirmed that the band was in preparation over recording a new studio album, noting that the music would cover new territory for the Daddies, drawing heavily on tropical themes. This was followed shortly thereafter by the band's first U.S. tour since 2000, where much of this new material was debuted.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, Stefani {{announced}} {{the production of}} an animated series about her and the Harajuku Girls.

5|$|In November 2015, Dream Theater {{announced}} some European tour {{dates for}} early 2016. The next month, they announced North American tour dates beginning in April and ending in May. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>band</b> felt that The Astonishing would lend itself well to a live performance, {{they decided to}} play the album in full for each show and hired a production company to help with their presentation. They also {{made it a point}} to book historical concert halls and theaters such as Radio City Music Hall. Following the conclusion of the North American leg, the band moved on to South America before returning to the United States for another run of shows, officially wrapping up the tour in December 2016.|$|E
50|$|The {{album is}} {{considered}} by fans and critics alike {{to be one of}} Riblja Čorba's finest works, <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>band's</b> triumphant comeback after the unsuccessful album Večeras vas zabavljaju muzičari koji piju. Istina is also significant <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>band's</b> first album recorded with guitarists Vidoja Božinović and Nikola Čuturilo, the two joining <b>the</b> <b>band</b> after <b>the</b> departure of Rajko Kojić and Momčilo Bajagić.|$|R

5|$|In early 1988, Butthole Surfers {{were ready}} to record a new album and wanted to use a modern studio for the first time, {{choosing}} a state-of-the-art facility in Texas. The following sessions took only one week, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>band</b> had been performing most of the material for years. The band opted to follow this album's blueprint on future projects. In contrast, songs on their earlier recordings had undergone far more in-studio development and experimentation. Pinkus has expressed the opinion that the later, better-organized sessions stifled much of the spontaneous creativity that had propelled their earlier releases.|$|E
5|$|In late 1969, Zappa {{broke up}} the band. He often cited the {{financial}} strain as the main reason, but also commented on the band members' lack of sufficient effort. Many band members were bitter about Zappa's decision, and some {{took it as a}} sign of Zappa's concern for perfection at the expense of human feeling. Others were irritated by 'his autocratic ways', exemplified by Zappa's never staying at the same hotel <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>band</b> members. Several members played for Zappa in years to come. Remaining recordings with the band from this period were collected on Weasels Ripped My Flesh and Burnt Weeny Sandwich (both released in 1970).|$|E
5|$|On September 27, 1986, Burton {{died in a}} bus {{accident}} in Kronoberg County, a rural area of southern Sweden, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>band</b> was touring {{in support of the}} Master of Puppets album. Burton was replaced by bassist Jason Newsted the following month. He was also posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with Metallica on April 4, 2009. He was selected as the ninth greatest bassist of all time in an online reader poll organized by Rolling Stone magazine in 2011.|$|E

5|$|Recorded in Los Angeles with {{producer}} David Schiffman, {{the album}} was initially released on October 20, 2009, by Indica Records in Canada. By design, the album lacks the production values of the band's debut album, Hello Master, {{in order to achieve}} a more natural sound. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>band</b> took more progressive rock influences and applied them to their songwriting, they changed their lyrical focus and wrote about themes considered to be more unusual for rock music, such as film and television characters, for this album.|$|E
5|$|The film's {{music was}} {{performed}} by the then-unknown group Earth, Wind & Fire, who {{were living in a}} single apartment with hardly any food at the time. Van Peebles' secretary was dating one of the bandmembers, and convinced him to contact them about performing the music for the film. Van Peebles projected scenes from the film <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>band</b> performed the music. By alternating hymn-based vocalization and jazz rhythms, Van Peebles created a sound that foreshadowed the use of sampling in hip hop music.|$|E
5|$|The next day, {{after an}} {{inconclusive}} skirmish at Kellogg's Grove, Black Hawk {{and his band}} fled the approaching militia through modern-day Wisconsin. The Sinsinawa Mound raid occurred on 29 June, {{five days after the}} Battle of Apple River Fort. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>band</b> fled the pursuing militia, they passed through what are now Beloit and Janesville, then followed the Rock River toward Horicon Marsh, where they headed west toward the Four Lakes region, near modern-day Madison. On 21 July 1832, the militia caught up with Black Hawk's band as they attempted to cross the Wisconsin River, near the present-day Town of Roxbury, in Dane County, Wisconsin, resulting in the Battle of Wisconsin Heights.|$|E
