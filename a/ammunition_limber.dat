5|$|The French were fast {{to bring}} up and deploy the fresh troops in front of San Giuliano, and the Austrians were slow to mount their attack. Boudet and the 9ème Légère (9th Light Infantry Regiment) were quickly {{moved on to the}} exit from the main vine belt, where they {{surprised}} the head of Saint-Julien’s column. As the Austrian infantry deployed {{on the south side of}} the road, the 9ème Légère conducted a steady withdrawal for 30 minutes back to Desaix’s position. There he had placed GdB Louis Charles de Guénand’s brigade on the north side while most of the remaining French army (Monnier and Lannes) were forming up north from there. The Austrians deployed three artillery batteries on the north side of the road supported by a dragoon regiment. GdB Auguste de Marmont massed the remaining French cannon against the Austrians as they advanced. Boudet's division advanced in line of brigades against the head of the Austrian column, defeating Saint-Julien's leading Austrian brigade. Zach brought forward GM Latterman's grenadier brigade in line and renewed the attack. Faced with a crisis, Napoleon sent Desaix forward again and ordered a cavalry charge requested by Desaix. The 9ème Légère halted to face the main Austrian advance and Marmont's guns blasted the Austrians with grapeshot at close range. Further back, an Austrian <b>ammunition</b> <b>limber</b> exploded. In the temporary heightening of confusion, Lattermann's formation was charged on its left flank by Kellermann's heavy cavalry (ca. 400 men) and disintegrated. At the decisive moment of the battle, Desaix was shot from his horse. Zach and at least 2,000 of his men were taken prisoners.|$|E

5000|$|This was an {{experimental}} gun, designed by Nicholas Straussler that was {{fitted with a}} motorized gun-carriage. A modified <b>ammunition</b> <b>limber</b> would {{be attached to the}} gun's trails, making a four-wheeled, self-propelled vehicle and removing the need for a truck to tow the gun.|$|E
5|$|By the end {{of their}} active use in 1902 {{together}} they had fired 1540 rounds in practice, though not all at full power as they are recorded as firing under 300 effective full charges. By then the wheels were significantly rotted and the <b>ammunition</b> <b>limbers</b> had become unserviceable. Less wheels, the guns were removed from the fort in 1909; Adelaide's city council then set them in Brougham Gardens, North Adelaide. Both were returned to the fort in 1976 and remounted on restored carriages of the original design. They are the only two guns of their type remaining in Australia. The southern gun (Number 463) fired three blank charges in 1980 to mark the centenary of the first firing at the fort. This same gun is fired regularly by the volunteers of the Fort Glanville Historical Association (FGHA).|$|R
2500|$|... "The United States {{procured}} {{a number}} of batteries of 5-inch 60 pounder guns with the necessary accompanying vehicles from Great Britain. The materiel is of British design and manufacture throughout, and the units ceded to the United States include the Gun, Mark I, mounted on a carriage, Mark II; the gun carriage limber, Mark II, the ammunition wagon, Mark II; and the <b>ammunition</b> wagon <b>limber,</b> Mark II".|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to each gun, a <b>limbered</b> <b>ammunition</b> trailer was also horse drawn. Field Artillery {{was designed to}} move {{at the same speed}} as infantry, with Horse Artillery being used where greater speed was required.|$|R
50|$|In US service, each gun was {{assigned}} an <b>ammunition</b> <b>limber,</b> which carried 14, sixteen-round boxes of ammunition {{as well as}} tools and accessories. The gun and its limber were normally together towed by a single horse or mule, but were manhandled forward if contact with the enemy was expected.|$|E

50|$|Another of his wartime {{projects}} was the Straussler Conversion. This was {{an experimental}} {{modification of the}} Ordnance QF 17 pounder and Ordnance QF 32 pounder anti-tank guns. The guns were fitted with motorized gun-carriages. A modified <b>ammunition</b> <b>limber</b> would {{be attached to the}} gun's trails, effectively making a four-wheeled, self-propelled vehicle and removing the need for a truck to tow the gun. The idea of equipping large artillery pieces with engines, to give a limited amount of independent mobility, would be eventually adopted post-war with guns like the FH-70.|$|E
50|$|The Howitzer was {{normally}} {{deployed in}} batteries of four guns. Each gun was pulled {{by a team}} of elephants. It had a crew of nine men. In addition to each gun, a <b>limbered</b> <b>ammunition</b> trailer was also deployed with each gun.|$|R
5000|$|Such a {{scene as}} it presented—guns {{dismounted}} and disabled, carriages splintered and crushed, <b>ammunition</b> chests exploded, <b>limbers</b> upset, wounded horses plunging and kicking, dashing out {{the brains of}} men tangled in the harness; while cannoneers with pistols were crawling around through the wreck shooting the struggling horses to {{save the lives of}} wounded men.|$|R
50|$|The 6.6-inch Howitzer {{was used}} a semi-mobile siege artillery, so could be {{mounted on a}} {{travelling}} siege carriage with limber. In addition a <b>limbered</b> <b>ammunition</b> trailer was also deployed with each gun. Alternatively the howitzer could be mounted on fixed bed and ground platform. Numbers of howitzers were mounted in fixed defences, including Fort Widley and Fort Nelson, Portsmouth which in 1898 show a number mounted.|$|R
50|$|The 1-pounder {{revolving}} Hotchkiss cannon {{had five}} 37 mm barrels, and {{was capable of}} firing 68 rounds per minute with an accuracy range of 2000 yd. Each feed magazine held ten rounds and weighed approximately 18 pounds (8 kg). Besides the field gun version, several other versions of the 37mm Hotchkiss revolving cannon were in existence, notably versions for naval defense against torpedo boats as well as fortress versions firing shrapnel or canister {{for the defense of}} moats. The naval version was adopted by Russia and the United States, amongst others. The field cannon version was accompanied by a horse-drawn <b>ammunition</b> <b>limber,</b> which held 110 rounds plus six loaded magazines, totaling 170 rounds. One example is on display at the Museum of the History of the Brazilian Army at Fort Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro.|$|E
5000|$|For most {{conspicuous}} bravery and devotion to duty when, during an advance, {{a portion of}} his company became disorganised by heavy machine gun fire from an enemy strong point. Collecting what men were available he led them with great coolness and bravery against this strong point, capturing it together with twenty-three prisoners and five machine guns. Later, he took a patrol forward in face of much enemy opposition, and established it on important high ground. On another occasion he displayed great heroism by attacking single-handed an <b>ammunition</b> <b>limber</b> which was trying to recover ammunition, killing three men who accompanied it and capturing the limber. Two days later he rendered valuable services when covering the advance of his company with a Lewis gun section, and located later on two machine gun positions in a concrete emplacement, which were holding up the advance of the battalion on the right. With complete disregard of personal danger he rushed forward with a small party and attacked and captured these posts, killing six enemy and taking thirteen prisoners and two machine guns. He was the only survivor of the gallant party, but by this daring and heroic action he enabled the battalion on the right to push forward without further machine gun fire from the village. Throughout the whole operations his magnificent example and leadership were an inspiration to all, and his courage was superb.|$|E

50|$|The United States {{acquired}} some 60 pounders, presumably for evaluation, {{reported in}} its May 1920 Handbook of Artillery :-"The United States procured {{a number of}} batteries of 5-inch 60 pounder guns with the necessary accompanying vehicles from Great Britain.

5000|$|As {{artillery}} pieces developed trunnions {{and were}} placed on carriages featuring two wheels and a trail, a limber was devised. This was a simple cart with a pintle. When the piece was to be towed, it was raised over the limber and then lowered, with the pintle fitting into {{a hole in the}} trail. Horses or other draft animals were harnessed in single file to haul the limber. [...] There was no provision for carrying <b>ammunition</b> on the <b>limber,</b> but an <b>ammunition</b> chest was often carried between the two pieces of the trail.|$|R
2500|$|By {{the evening}} of 8 November, all the Ottoman {{positions}} which had made up the Gaza–Beersheba line had been captured and the enemy was in full retreat. During 8 November the EEF advanced [...] to occupy a position due east of Huj, which had been the army headquarters and military railway terminus of the coast line. EEF artillery was then {{able to get into}} position just before dark, to fire during the night on the main road leading north from Huj. By the morning of 9 November, the road was littered with guns, <b>limbers,</b> <b>ammunition</b> wagons and transport of all descriptions, jumbled up into heaps with their teams shot.|$|R
25|$|Arriving at Plymouth on 12 March, the 11th BAC {{establishment}} was {{to include}} dedicated General Service (GS) <b>ammunition</b> wagons (with <b>limber),</b> one wagon per howitzer, and one GS wagon for stores, {{with at least}} 132 horses (both riding and draft, using six per wagon). The Column’s 'operational' task was to have available (carry) a constant supply, and bring forward (on-call), forty-eight rounds per howitzer, to a Firing Battery’s entrenched position, or to supply it to the Battery’s own ammunition wagon lines. Working mostly at night, moving forward, the BAC ammunition wagons were interchangeable with a Firing Batteries own ammunition wagons (one per gun), so full wagons could be easily 'dropped-off', being unhooked and taken away for reloading, a howitzer battery looking to 'always have' available 108 rounds.|$|R
5000|$|The Howitzer 'Brigade Ammunition Column (BAC)' {{included}} <b>ammunition</b> wagons (with <b>limber),</b> one wagon per howitzer, and one GS wagon for stores, with {{at least}} 132 horses (riding and draft, using six per wagon). The Column’s 'operational' task was to have available a constant supply, and bring forward, forty-eight rounds per howitzer, to a firing Battery’s entrenched position, or to supply it to the Battery’s own ammunition wagon lines. [...] The Howitzer BAC was divided into two sections, they commanded by Lieutenants, each tasked to two Batteries, and included a Battery Sergeant-Major, a Battery Quartermaster Sergeant, a Farrier-Sergeant, Shoeing Smiths (of which 1 would be a Corporal), 2 Saddlers (driver equipment), 2 Wheel-Wrights, a Trumpeter, 4 Sergeants, 5 Corporals, 5 Bombardiers, 3 Gunners acting as Batmen, Signallers, Drivers, and The Gunners.|$|R
50|$|Throughout the First World War, the 18-pounder was {{operated}} by the Royal Field Artillery as the standard field gun. Some Royal Horse Artillery batteries were also re-equipped with it as their 13 pounders proved unsuited to the prevalent trench warfare.The gun and its 2-wheeled <b>ammunition</b> (carriage) <b>limber</b> were towed {{by a team of}} six vanner horses (light draught) in pairs - lead pair, centre pair, limber pair. A driver rode the left horse of each pair. The limber was hooked up to the horses and the trail of the gun was hooked up to the limber, so the total weight of the gun and trail were supported on 4 wheels. The gun detachment all rode into action either on their own horses or on the limber and wagons, led by the No. 1 (the detachment commander, a Sergeant) on his own horse. In the early actions of the war, the ammunition wagon was positioned on the gun position {{to the left of the}} gun. The teams with their respective limbers, moving back from the gun position to the 'wagon lines'. Ammunition was passed from the wagon to the loader. As the war progressed and larger quantities of ammunition were fired, ammunition was often dumped directly onto the gun position next to the gun pits and the wagons held in the wagon lines.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to each gun, a <b>limbered</b> <b>ammunition</b> trailer was also horse drawn. When deployed as Field Artillery {{it was designed}} to move at the same speed as infantry, or when deployed as Horse Artillery being used where greater speed was required.Guns were fired using a silk bag containing a black powder propellant. They used three types of ammunition - Common shell (for use against buildings or fortifications), shrapnel shell (for use any Infantry or Cavalry) and case shot (for close range use against 'soft' targets. Ignition was through a copper lined vent at the breech end of the gun. A copper friction tube would be inserted and a lanyard attached. When the lanyard was pulled the tube would ignite, firing the gun. A number of different fuzes could be used enabling shells to either burst at a pre-determined time (and range), or on impact. A typical rate of fire was one round per minute.|$|R
