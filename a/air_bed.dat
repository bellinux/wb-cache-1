Data comprising demographic, socio-economic, clinical and behavior factors were collected from children’s parents through face-to-face interviews by trained interviewers using a standardized questionnaire. Results of the primary logistic regression analyses revealed that age, history of cold food consumption, hand-washing routines, and <b>airing</b> out <b>bedding</b> were significantly associated with HFMD cases. Results of further multivariate analysis indicated that older age (OR = 0. 44, 95 % CI: 0. 34 – 0. 56) and hand-washing before meals (OR = 0. 3, 95 % CI: 0. 13 – 0. 70) are protective factors, whereas <b>airing</b> out <b>bedding</b> more than thrice a month (OR = 4. 55, 95 % CI: 1. 19 – 17. 37) was associated with increased risk for HFMD.

The weight of the body is reduced and spread more effectively which decreases the risk of decubites development. Further, it helps the hygienic upkeep, dries up the burnt areas and by doing so it prevents gramnegative ifection from developing.

50|$|An air mattress, {{also known}} as an airbed or a blow-up bed, is an {{inflatable}} mattress, the majority of which are usually made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), although recently developed textile-reinforced urethane plastic or rubber versions exist. The deflated mattress can be rolled up or folded and carried or stored relatively easily, making them a popular choice for camping trips and for temporary bedding at home for guests. They are inflated either orally by blowing into a valve, or with a manual foot-powered or more commonly inflated via an electric pump. Some are even automatically inflating (up to a certain pressure—some additional inflation is also needed) just by opening the valve.

40|$|Burn {{trauma is}} very {{stressing}} for patients physically {{due to the}} high level of pain, damage to the skin and risk of infection, and also from a psycho-social perspective. There are currently several facilities dedicated to burn therapy. These are staffed by quality personnel {{with a high level of}} experience, who increase the hopes of patients to achieve better living conditions. Therapy depends on the extent of the handicap as well as other factors affecting the individual. Extensive burns require treatment in specialized facilities, where the patient is subject to a demanding and long-term therapy. Such patients are subject to multiple surgical procedures in total anaesthesia. The burn trauma has many complications during the healing process. The physician together with the nurse care for the patient and play a crucial role in this process. The patient will is subject to a long-term rehabilitation and complicated reintegration into society. We carried out a quantitative examination by means of 65 questionnaires handed out to general nurses, of which 58 could be used. The objectives of the thesis were met. We defined five hypotheses: H 1 : Nurses observe the principles of care for patients with burn trauma. H 2 : Nurses are aware of the effectiveness of rehabilitation treatment when caring for clients with burn trauma. H 3 : It is easier for nurses to provide care to patients with burn trauma if the patient is lying on an <b>air</b> <b>bed</b> as opposed to a standard bed. H 4 : Nurses cooperate with a clinical psychologist when caring for a patient with burn trauma. H 5 : Nurses cooperate with a nutrition therapist when caring for a patient with burn trauma. All the hypotheses were confirmed except hypothesis H 3, which was disconfirmed. The research examination showed that nurses adhere to the principles of hygienic care for patients with burn trauma, and that they are aware of the effectiveness of rehabilitation treatment in burn care. Care for patients on an <b>air</b> <b>bed</b> is not easier for nurses than on a standard bed. On the contrary, it is physically more demanding. It was further confirmed that nurses cooperate with a clinical psychologist as well as a nutrition therapist when caring for patients with burn trauma. The diploma thesis is elaborated in such a way so that it can be used to create and present a standard, which will help to improve care for patients with burn trauma...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} linking poor housing conditions and respiratory diseases, including asthma. The association between housing conditions and asthma {{in the inner}} city has been attributed in part to cockroach and mouse infestation and the resulting allergen exposures. Multiple social and behavioral factors can influence environmental exposures and health conditions, necessitating a thorough examination of such factors. As part of the Healthy Public Housing Initiative, we evaluated the association between physical and household characteristics and pest-related allergen levels in three public housing developments in Boston, MA. We detected cockroach allergens (Bla g 1 and Bla g 2) in bedroom <b>air,</b> <b>bed,</b> and especially high concentrations in kitchen samples. In multivariate Tobit regressions controlling for development and season, clutter and lack of cleanliness in the apartment were associated with a tenfold increase in Bla g 1 concentration in the air, a sevenfold increase in Bla g 1 and an eightfold increase in Bla g 2 concentrations in the bed, and an 11 -fold increase in Bla g 2 in the kitchen (pG 0. 05 for all). Holes in the wall/ceiling were associated with a six- to 11 -fold increase in kitchen cockroach allergen concentrations (pG 0. 05). Occupancy in an apartment unit of 2 years or more was also associated with increased cockroach allergen concentrations. In contrast, there were low concentrations of mouse urinary protein in this population. In conclusion, these results suggest that interventions in these homes should focus on reducing cockroach allergen concentrations and that building-wide interventions should be supplemented with targeted efforts focused on high-risk units...|$|E
40|$|An {{increase}} {{in the amount of}} launched satellites {{can be seen in the}} last decade. And it is expected that even more satellites will be launched in the upcoming years. Most of these small satellites are launched as piggy back together with a large spacecraft. The location and time of launch and orbit will therefore be determined by another mission. A dedicated launcher for small satellites will contribute to the success of small satellites by bringing the satellite at the right time in the right orbit. Fourteen European companies and institutes are working together in a European Union (EU) Horizon 2020 project called “SMall Innovative Launcher for Europe” (SMILE). The project aims at designing a launcher for satellites up to 70 kg and a European-based launch facility at Andøya. To make this project a success the launch cost must be below the " 50 000 per kg and a total launch cost of 3. 5 "M. One of the ways to cut the costs of the launcher is by the re-use of the first stage. This research will answer the question if recovering of the first stage will be cost-beneficial, answering the following research question; What is the performance gain in terms of cost when reusing the first stage of the launcher within the SMILE project? To answer this question, three different steps are taken. The first step is to investigate the boundaries of the recovery of the first stage. The impact region, velocity and maximum altitude and loads are investigated to understand the recovery mechanisms needed. It is found that the impact region of the first stage is between the coast of Norway and Jan Mayen. This means that the first stage needs to land on water. Using the information found, seven different recovery options are designed. During the second phase the different designs are optimised to the minimumtake-off weight. This optimisation is done by first making use of Monte Carlo simulations to find the region were the minimal is found. The results of the Monte Carlo simulation are used in a genetic algorithm the find the minimum system weight. After this evaluation two different options remained; retro-propulsion option and a parachute system option. The last step is to evaluate these two options in more detail with a six degrees of freedom simulation. After the evaluation of the two options, the options are designed in more detail. Three different landing techniques are discussed; resulting in three different options. The first option found is the retro-propulsion with an airbag landing. The second option considered is the parachute system with an <b>air</b> <b>bed</b> landing. The last option found is the parachute system with a mid air capture performed by a helicopter. The different options are re-designed and the extra weight and volume needed is computed. The cost of the different options is calculated and compared. It is shown that if the first stage is used four times of more per year, recovering is cost-beneficial for all options. SMIL...|$|E
