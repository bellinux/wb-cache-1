5|$|For {{most of its}} {{applications}} gas metal {{arc welding}} is a fairly simple welding process to learn requiring no more than <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> two to master basic welding technique. Even when welding is performed by well-trained operators weld quality can fluctuate since it depends on a number of external factors. All GMAW is dangerous, though perhaps less so than some other welding methods, such as shielded metal arc welding.|$|E
5|$|September's {{counterpart}} to Sundance, the Toronto International Film Festival, is {{held at the}} end of the month. The film community's attention is focused on the Canadian city. Critics gather to see potential Oscar contenders among the many independent films on the program and studio executives look to line up distribution deals with the same prize in mind. Some of the best are released within <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> so, ending the September dump period.|$|E
5|$|Since its introduction, the Golden Film {{has been}} awarded to 62films. In 2008, {{fourteen}} films were awarded the Golden Film, the highest number to have received the award in a single year. Most of the films that are awarded the Golden Film have taken <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> more to reach the target audience figure. Only Full Moon Party (2002) and Black Book (2006) have reached the criterion, for respectively 75,000 and , during their opening weekends.|$|E

5|$|Pound {{returned}} from America in 1911 and resumed his visits to Olivia and Dorothy, adhering to Olivia's restrictions. That October Pound formally asked to marry Dorothy; her father refused {{on the basis}} of Pound's meagre income. Neither Dorothy nor Pound gave up: he again asked for permission to marry her in March 1912 but was again rejected. In Dorothy's mind they continued to be engaged, although they were only allowed short visits in the Family drawing room once <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> every two weeks.|$|E
5|$|Surgical {{sterilization}} {{is available}} in the form of tubal ligation for women and vasectomy for men. There are no significant long-term side effects, and tubal ligation decreases the risk of ovarian cancer. Short term complications are twenty times less likely from a vasectomy than a tubal ligation. After a vasectomy, there may be swelling and pain of the scrotum which usually resolves in <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> two. With tubal ligation, complications occur in 1 to 2 percent of procedures with serious complications usually due to the anesthesia. Neither method offers protection from sexually transmitted infections.|$|E

5|$|The {{canonical}} five murders were perpetrated at night, on {{or close}} to a weekend, either {{at the end of}} a month or <b>a</b> <b>week</b> (<b>or</b> so) after. The mutilations became increasingly severe as the series of murders proceeded, except for that of Stride, whose attacker may have been interrupted. Nichols was not missing any organs; Chapman's uterus was taken; Eddowes had her uterus and a kidney removed and her face mutilated; and Kelly's body was eviscerated and her face hacked away, though only her heart was missing from the crime scene.|$|E
5|$|The fly Ormia ochracea {{has very}} acute hearing and targets calling male crickets. It locates its prey by ear and then lays its eggs nearby. The {{developing}} larvae burrow inside any crickets {{with which they}} come in contact {{and in the course}} of <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> so, devour what remains of the host before pupating. In Florida, the parasitic flies were only present in the autumn, and at that time of year, the males sang less but for longer periods. A trade-off exists for the male between attracting females and being parasitized.|$|E
5|$|Waste is {{delivered}} to the station by road, using up to 100 waste collection vehicles. Up to 2,800 tonnes of waste <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> as much as 1,000 tonnes of waste a day, can be delivered at the plant. A rail head was also built on the railway sidings adjacent to the site in 2009. This allows for waste to be {{delivered to the}} plant by rail, rather than just by road. This is more sustainable as it reduces the amount of traffic on local roads. In December 2011, {{it was announced that}} the rail head would be used to receive up 500,000 tonnes of residual waste per year from Merseyside via a rail waste transfer facility at Knowley Industrial Park, Kirby, in a contract worth £400million.|$|E

5|$|Apart from a {{definition}} of leisure, there are other questions of theoretical concern to the sociologist of leisure. For example, quantifying the results is difficult, as time-budget studies have noted that a given amount of time (for example, an hour) may have different values, depending on when it occurs—within a day, <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> <b>or</b> a year. Finally, as with many other fields of inquiry in the social sciences, {{the study of the}} sociology of leisure is hampered by the lack of reliable data for comparative longitudinal studies, as there was little to no standardized data-gathering on leisure throughout most of human history. The lack of longitudinal studies has been remedied in the last few decades by recurring national surveys such as the General Household Survey in the United Kingdom (ongoing since 1971). In addition to surveys, an increasing number of studies have been focusing on qualitative methods of research (interviews).|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} he reached his teens, Gygax had a {{voracious}} appetite for pulp fiction authors such as Robert Howard, Jack Vance, Fritz Leiber, H. P. Lovecraft, and Edgar Burroughs. Gygax was a mediocre student, and in 1956, a few months after his father died, he {{dropped out of high school}} in his junior year. He briefly joined the Marines, but after being diagnosed with walking pneumonia, he was given a medical discharge and moved back home with his mother. From there, he commuted to a job as shipping clerk with Kemper Insurance Co. in Chicago. Shortly after his return, a friend introduced him to Avalon Hill's new wargame Gettysburg, and Gygax was soon obsessed with the game, often playing marathon sessions once <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> more. It was also from Avalon Hill that he ordered the first blank hexagon mapping sheets that were available, which he then employed to design his own games.|$|E
5|$|Until a road {{could be}} opened from Lae, the Kaiapit area {{could only be}} {{supplied}} by air {{and there were a}} limited number of transport aircraft. Even flying in an airborne engineer aviation battalion to improve the airstrip would have involved taking aircraft away from operations supporting the 7th Division at Nadzab. Moreover, Whitehead warned that he could not guarantee adequate air support for both Kaiapit and the upcoming Finschhafen operation at the same time. However, Herring calculated that the 7th Division had sufficient reserves at Nadzab to allow maintenance flights to be suspended for <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> so after the capture of Kaiapit. He planned to seize Kaiapit with an overland advance from Nadzab by independent companies, the Papuan Infantry Battalion, and the 7th Division's 21st Infantry Brigade.|$|E

5|$|While most jumping spiders {{are active}} hunters, Phaeacius is unusually sedentary, {{generally}} resting in its unusual flattened pose for hours or days on logs, tree barks, {{pieces of wood}} or any other solid surface, where it is very well camouflaged. Its preferred prey is moths and other insects, and jumping spiders. Insects can usually move around an inactive Phaeacius, or even over its body, but if the insect moves between the spider's first pair of legs, Phaeacius lunges extremely quickly to bite the prey. Sometimes Phaeacius takes a more active approach, especially if without prey for <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> more. Phaeacius does not enter webs voluntary, and moves away if it touches one accidentally. It can bite through the threads and pull strongly with its legs, but cannot escape from very sticky webs.|$|E
