5000|$|On March 11, 2005, the Onondaga Nation in {{the town}} of Onondaga, New York, filed a land rights action in federal court, seeking <b>acknowledgment</b> <b>of</b> <b>title</b> to over 3000 sq mi of ancestral lands {{centering}} in Syracuse, New York. They hoped to obtain increased influence over environmental restoration efforts at Onondaga Lake and other EPA Superfund sites in the claimed area. [...] The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit rejected the Onondagas' claim in 2012, and the Supreme Court in 2013 declined to hear an appeal.|$|E

5000|$|However, the {{situation}} was transformed by the arrival in Munster of the Ulster forces of Hugh O'Neill, who was leading a nationwide rebellion - the Nine Years' War - against the English government in Ireland. In the autumn, Donal MacCarthy (the late Earl's illegitimate son) {{was reported to have}} acknowledged the authority of the rebel O'Neill and assumed the <b>title</b> <b>of</b> MacCarthy Mór, but the O'Sullivan Mór withheld the White Wand or rod of inauguration (which symbolically approved the accession of a chieftain) in favour of Florence MacCarthy. In a desperate situation, when it seemed that all the native lords in Munster were going into rebellion, the crown granted Florence MacCarthy a free pardon, on terms that he immediately withdraw his followers from rebellion in return for qualified <b>acknowledgment</b> <b>of</b> his <b>title</b> against Donal MacCarthy, but he prevaricated and only returned to Munster after Sir Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex - whose favour he had been relying upon - threw up his command as lord lieutenant in Ireland in late 1599 and returned to England under a cloud. Florence MacCarthy had managed to negotiate English support for his claims to land and title, but he also maintained contact with the rebels to the same end. This has made some commentators claim that his real sympathy lay with the rebels, especially as he was described in his youth as being [...] "very zealous in the old religion Catholicism". However {{it is more likely that}} MacCarthy was using both sides as a lever to further his own aims.|$|R
60|$|I {{conceive}} {{that another}} circumstance in that transaction {{has been as}} little authorized by any example, {{and that it is}} as little prudent in itself: I mean the formal recognition of the French Republic. Without entering, for the present, into a question on the good faith manifested in that measure, or on its general policy, I doubt, upon mere temporary considerations of prudence, whether it was perfectly advisable. It is not within, the rules of dexterous conduct to make an <b>acknowledgment</b> <b>of</b> a contested <b>title</b> in your enemy before you are morally certain that your recognition will secure his friendship. Otherwise it is a measure worse than thrown away. It adds infinitely to the strength, and consequently to the demands, of the adverse party. He has gained a fundamental point without an equivalent. It has happened as might have been foreseen. No notice whatever was taken of this recognition. In fact, the Directory never gave themselves any concern about it; and they received our acknowledgment with perfect scorn. With them it is not for the states of Europe to judge of their title: the very reverse. In their eye the <b>title</b> <b>of</b> every other power depends wholly on their pleasure.|$|R
50|$|However, {{when the}} tide of history has washed away any real <b>acknowledgment</b> <b>of</b> {{traditional}} law and any real observance of traditional customs, the foundation <b>of</b> native <b>title</b> has disappeared.Thus although over some parts <b>of</b> Australia native <b>title</b> has been lost, in {{large areas of the}} nation's interior, native title could be recognised.|$|R
5|$|The Heart of a Woman is {{the first}} time Angelou {{identifies}} with another female African-American writer.

Her choice <b>of</b> <b>title</b> for this book is an <b>acknowledgment</b> <b>of</b> her legacy as a Black woman writer.|$|R
