5|$|By 1920 variety theatre {{had become}} popular in Britain, and Robey had {{completed}} the successful transition from music hall to variety star. Pantomime, which relied on its stars to make up much of the script through ad lib, was also beginning {{to fall out of}} favour, and his contemporaries were finding it too difficult to create fresh material for every performance; for Robey, however, the festive entertainment continued to be <b>a</b> <b>lucrative</b> source of employment.|$|E

5|$|The Dutch {{soon found}} trade in deerskins and venison in the East Asian market to be <b>a</b> <b>lucrative</b> {{endeavor}} and recruited Plains Aborigines to procure the hides. The deer trade attracted the first Han traders to aboriginal villages, but {{as early as}} 1642 the demand for deer greatly diminished the deer stocks. This drop significantly reduced the prosperity of aboriginal peoples, forcing many aborigines to take up farming to counter {{the economic impact of}} losing their most vital food source.|$|E

5|$|Despite Chotiner's {{maneuvering}} for Nixon, {{the senator}} was still uncertain {{if he should}} take the vice-presidential slot if offered. Pat Nixon wanted her husband to decline it. Chotiner argued to the Nixons that if the Republicans lost, Nixon would retain his seat in the Senate, that if he served as Vice President and re-entered private life, he would have <b>a</b> <b>lucrative</b> legal career, but that if Nixon did not move up to the Vice Presidency, with Senator Knowland relatively young and in good health, Nixon was likely to remain merely the junior senator from California {{for many years to}} come. Eisenhower offered Nixon the position, the senator accepted, and with Knowland's re-election bid all but won, Chotiner became Nixon's campaign manager.|$|E

50|$|The first stadium tour, CSNY in 1974 set the {{precedent}} for every similar outing to follow. Bill Graham {{would work in}} the same capacity for the Rolling Stones on their American tours of 1975, 1978, and 1981, adding more stadium dates with each subsequent excursion. <b>As</b> <b>lucrative</b> stadium tours with their large attendances became more feasible during the 1970s, so documents of the tour such as Frampton Comes Alive! and Kiss Alive II became equally more lucrative.

5|$|Edward Drinker Cope {{was born}} on July 28, 1840, the eldest son of Alfred and Hanna Cope.

Alfred, an orthodox member of the Religious Society of Friends or Quakers, operated <b>a</b> <b>lucrative</b> shipping business started by his father, Thomas P. Cope, in 1821. He was a philanthropist who gave money to the Society of Friends, the Philadelphia Zoological Gardens, and the Institute for Colored Youth.|$|E
5|$|Following the takeover, Manchester United {{continued}} to thrive, with the 2005–06 season seeing Old Trafford's capacity being expanded and <b>a</b> <b>lucrative</b> new shirt sponsorship deal signed in April 2006 with American company AIG (which {{had a large}} stake in a hedge fund company that helped to fund Glazer's takeover of the club). Increased revenue from TV rights to each competition the club participates in, {{as well as its}} various sponsorship deals, also boosted the club's profitability. This came despite fears among many supporters that the debt incurred in buying the club could lead to insolvency.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, Sadler began giving {{lectures on}} the Chautauqua adult-education circuit, which {{featured}} itinerant speakers discussing self-help and morality.

Sadler, his wife, her sister, and a friend, formed a four-member lecture company that gave two- or three-day engagements, sometimes accompanied by an orchestra.
