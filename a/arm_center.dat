50|$|The {{secondary}} arm {{was installed}} on the pintle of the secondary block. On the pintle of the primary block were installed the primary arm, the auxiliary arm, and the gun arm, {{as well as the}} complex gun <b>arm</b> <b>center</b> mechanism that was used to adjust the board for the location of the guns' directing point, to read the azimuth to the target, to adjust the firing data, and to tally the motion of the target between successive plotted positions.

50|$|Next, the gun <b>arm</b> <b>center</b> {{mechanism}} was slid {{from side}} to side and/or up and down with relation to the base line arm to account for the location of the battery's directing point to {{one side or the other}} of the primary base end station or behind or in front of the base line. These adjustments resulted in relocating (relating) the firing data sent to the guns to the actual (surveyed and calculated)) positions of these guns.|$|E
5000|$|To {{locate a}} target, {{plotting}} board operators used two radial arms (called {{the primary and}} auxiliary arms), and [...] "locked-in" [...] the ends of these arms along on the notched azimuth scale that ran around the circumference of the board at the azimuths of the sightings that were telephoned in {{to them by the}} two base end stations. These locked arms and the baseline arm (along the base of the arc) then formed a triangle whose vertices were the two observation stations and the target. This located the target on the board, and its position was then marked by punching a hole in the paper placed over the plotting board. Next, another radial arm, called the gun arm, was swung over the plotted position of the target, and the resulting range and azimuth for firing were read off the gun arm and an azimuth scale on the gun <b>arm</b> <b>center.</b> These data were corrected or adjusted for some other variables, and telephoned to the gun/s.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} autonomous servoing an unmanned redundant aerial manipulator using computer vision. The over-actuation {{of the system is}} exploited by means of a hierarchical control law which allows to prioritize several tasks during flight. We propose a safety related primary task to avoid possible collisions. As a secondary task we present an uncalibrated image-based visual servo strategy to drive the arm end-effector to a desired position and orientation using a camera attached to it. In contrast to previous visual-servo approaches, a known value of camera focal length is not strictly required. To further improve flight behavior we hierarchically add one task to reduce dynamic effects by vertically aligning the <b>arm</b> <b>center</b> of gravity to the multirotor gravitational vector, and another one that keeps the arm close to a desired configuration of high manipulability and avoiding arm joint limits. The performance of the hierarchical control law, with and without activation of each of the tasks, is shown in simulations and in real experiments confirming the viability of such prioritized control scheme for aerial manipulation...|$|E
