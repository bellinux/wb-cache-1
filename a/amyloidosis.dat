5|$|An {{underactive thyroid}} gland results in hypothyroidism. Typical {{symptoms}} are abnormal weight gain, tiredness, constipation, heavy menstrual bleeding, hair loss, cold intolerance, and a slow heart rate. Iodine deficiency {{is the most}} common cause of hypothyroidism worldwide, and the autoimmune disease Hashimoto's thyroiditis {{is the most common}} cause in the developed world. Other causes include congenital abnormalities, diseases causing transient inflammation, surgical removal or radioablation of the thyroid, the drugs amiodarone and lithium, <b>amyloidosis,</b> and sarcoidosis. Some forms of hypothyroidism can result in myxedema and severe cases can result in myxedema coma.|$|E
5|$|Diseases {{may also}} affect the {{pericardium}} which surrounds the heart, which when inflamed is called pericarditis. This {{may result from}} infective causes (such as glandular fever, cytomegalovirus, coxsackievirus, tuberculosis or Q fever), systemic disorders such as <b>amyloidosis</b> or sarcoidosis, tumours, high uric acid levels, and other causes. This inflammation affects {{the ability of the}} heart to pump effectively. When fluid builds up in the pericardium this is called pericardial effusion, which when it causes acute heart failure is called cardiac tamponade. This may be blood from a traumatic injury or fluid from an effusion. This can compress the heart and adversely affect the function of the heart. The fluid can be removed from the pericardial sac using a syringe in a procedure called pericardiocentesis.|$|E
25|$|Sarcoidosis, <b>amyloidosis,</b> and Whipple's {{disease can}} also {{resemble}} RA.|$|E

25|$|Other {{guidelines}} {{for the use of}} serum free light chain measurement in the management of AL <b>amyloidosis,</b> plasmacytoma and the comparison of treatment responses in clinical trials have also been published.|$|E
25|$|Medical {{disorders}} {{that lead}} to fluid retention or are associated with inflammation such as: inflammatory arthritis, Colles' fracture, <b>amyloidosis,</b> hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, acromegaly, and use of corticosteroids and estrogens.|$|E
25|$|Pressure ulcers {{can trigger}} other ailments, cause {{considerable}} suffering, {{and can be}} expensive to treat. Some complications include autonomic dysreflexia, bladder distension, bone infection, pyarthroses, sepsis, <b>amyloidosis,</b> anemia, urethral fistula, gangrene and very rarely malignant transformation (Marjolin's ulcer - secondary carcinomas in chronic wounds). Sores may recur if those with pressure ulcers do not follow recommended treatment or may instead develop seromas, hematomas, infections, or wound dehiscence. Paralyzed individuals {{are the most likely}} to have pressure sores recur. In some cases, complications from pressure sores can be life-threatening. The most common causes of fatality stem from kidney failure and <b>amyloidosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|In April 1988, city Councilman Mark Pollock {{proposed}} renaming it the Richard S. Caliguiri Arena, {{after the}} city's popular mayor who {{was diagnosed with}} <b>amyloidosis.</b> Caliguiri died a month later, and nothing came of this name, either.|$|E
25|$|Shar Pei fever is a {{condition}} seen in Shar Peis characterized by recurring fever and swelling of the hocks. Shar Pei fever can result in renal and liver failure through accumulation of amyloid in those organs (<b>amyloidosis).</b>|$|E
25|$|Some {{chemotherapy}} {{drugs are}} used in diseases other than cancer, such as in autoimmune disorders, and noncancerous plasma cell dyscrasia. In some cases they are often used at lower doses, {{which means that the}} side effects are minimized, while in other cases doses similar to ones used to treat cancer are used. Methotrexate is used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis and multiple sclerosis. The anti-inflammatory response seen in RA is thought to be due to increases in adenosine, which causes immunosuppression; effects on immuno-regulatory cyclooxygenase-2 enzyme pathways; reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines; and anti-proliferative properties. Although methotrexate is used to treat both multiple sclerosis and ankylosing spondylitis, its efficacy in these diseases is still uncertain. Cyclophosphamide is sometimes used to treat lupus nephritis, a common symptom of systemic lupus erythematosus. Dexamethasone along with either bortezomib or melphalan is commonly used as a treatment for AL <b>amyloidosis.</b> Recently, bortezomid in combination with cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone has also shown promise as a treatment for AL <b>amyloidosis.</b> Other drugs used to treat myeloma such as lenalidomide have shown promise in treating AL <b>amyloidosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Other causes include infective {{endocarditis}} {{where the}} vegetations may favor increase risk of stenosis. Other rare causes include mitral annular calcification, endomyocardial fibroelastosis, malignant carcinoid syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, whipple disease, fabry disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. hurler' disease, hunter's disease, <b>amyloidosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|The serum free light-chain assay in {{combination}} with serum protein electrophoresis and serum immunofixation electrophoresis is sufficient to screen for pathological monoclonal plasmaproliferative disorders other than AL <b>amyloidosis</b> which requires all the serum tests as well as 24 h urine immunofixation electrophoresis.|$|E
25|$|People with rheumatologic {{disorders}} such as rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, systemic {{lupus erythematosus}} and polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis {{are at increased risk}} of osteoporosis, either as part of their disease or because of other risk factors (notably corticosteroid therapy). Systemic diseases such as <b>amyloidosis</b> and sarcoidosis can also lead to osteoporosis.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} {{force-feeding}} can make animals sick by stressing the liver. If the stress is prolonged, excess protein may build up and clump together as amyloids, consumption {{of which has}} been found to induce <b>amyloidosis</b> in laboratory mice. It has been hypothesized this may be a route of transmission in humans too and so be a risk for people with inflammatory complaints such as rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E
25|$|The {{variable}} (V) {{domain of}} light chains {{has a high}} degree of structural diversity, particularly the antigen-binding region. In addition, the first 23 amino acids of the 1st variable domain framework region have a number of variations known as subgroups. Four kappa (Vκ1–Vκ4) and six lambda subgroups (Vλ1–Vλ6) can be identified. The specific subgroup structures influence the potential of the free light chains to polymerise such that AL <b>amyloidosis</b> is associated with Vλ6 and light-chain deposition disease with Vκ1 and Vκ4.|$|E
25|$|Basic {{blood tests}} {{can be used}} to check the {{concentration}} of hemoglobin, platelets, sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, urea, creatinine, calcium, magnesium or phosphate in the blood. All of these may be affected by kidney problems. The serum creatinine concentration {{can be used to}} estimate the function of the kidney, called the creatinine clearance or estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR). More specialized tests can be ordered to discover or link certain systemic diseases to kidney failure such as infections (hepatitis B, hepatitis C), autoimmune conditions (systemic lupus erythematosus, ANCA vasculitis), paraproteinemias (<b>amyloidosis,</b> multiple myeloma) and metabolic diseases (diabetes, cystinosis).|$|E
25|$|Notably, {{the protein}} {{lysozyme}} {{is among the}} few native-state proteins shown to contain an alpha-strand region; lysozyme from both chickens and humans contains an alpha strand located close {{to the site of}} a mutation known to cause hereditary <b>amyloidosis</b> in humans, usually an autosomal dominant genetic disease. Molecular dynamics simulations of the mutant protein reveal that the region around the mutation assumes an alpha strand conformation. Lysozyme is among the naturally occurring proteins known to form amyloid fibers under experimental conditions, and both natively alpha-strand region and the mutation site fall within the larger region identified as the core of lysozyme amyloid fibrillogenesis.|$|E
25|$|Renal failure (kidney failure) * {{is common}} in dogs and {{may be found in}} acute or chronic forms. It is defined by a loss of {{function}} of about 75 percent of the filtration system of the kidney and characterized by azotemia and low specific gravity of the urine. Acute renal failure can be caused by loss of blood supply, hypercalcemia, or toxins such as ethylene glycol (antifreeze) or aminoglycoside antibiotics (see: ethylene glycol poisoning). Chronic renal failure can be congenital and/or inherited or caused by cancer, infection, hypertension, glomerulonephritis, <b>amyloidosis,</b> progressive interstitial fibrosis, or any of the causes of acute renal failure.|$|E
25|$|Familial Shar Pei fever (FSF) is {{a serious}} {{congenital}} disease that causes short fevers lasting from 24 hours, sometimes up to three days and usually accompanied by accumulation of fluid around the ankles (called Swollen Hock Syndrome). <b>Amyloidosis,</b> a long-term condition, is most likely related to FSF, caused by unprocessed amyloid proteins depositing in the organs, most often in the kidneys or liver, leading eventually to renal failure. The disease {{is associated with the}} western type and it is estimated that 23% are affected. The Australian breed standard was changed in 2009 to discourage breeding for heavy wrinkling.|$|E
25|$|Immunoglobulin light chains {{that are}} {{circulating}} in serum {{in a free}} (unbound) state are called free light chains (FLCs). Measurement of the serum level of FLCs became practical as a clinical blood test in recent decades. These tests are used as an aid in the diagnosis and monitoring of multiple myeloma and related disorders. There {{are two types of}} immunoglobulin light chain produced in humans, designated by the Greek letters kappa (κ) and lambda (λ). Comparing the ratio of κ FLCs to λ FLCs in a person's serum against reference ranges indicates whether that person may have a plasma cell tumour such as multiple myeloma or AL <b>amyloidosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Dr. Scudder {{received}} an Outstanding Humanitarian Service Award from the American Academy of Ophthalmology on Oct. 22, 2004, and the George Tani Humanitarian Service Award from the Minnesota Academy of Ophthalmology on Dec. 10, 2004. Hope College presented {{her with a}} Distinguished Alumni Award on May 7, 1988, and profiled her in {{a story in the}} August 1985 issue of news from Hope College that had previously been featured in the Kodaikanal International School’s alumni publication. She was diagnosed with primary <b>amyloidosis</b> in 2002. and died of that disease on Monday, May 16, 2005, in Dar es Salaam. She was buried May 21 at her home on the slopes of Mt. Kilimanjaro. She was 66 years old.|$|E
25|$|Insulin is {{produced}} {{and stored in}} the body as a hexamer (a unit of six insulin molecules), while the active form is the monomer. The hexamer is an inactive form with long-term stability, {{which serves as a}} way to keep the highly reactive insulin protected, yet readily available. The hexamer-monomer conversion is one of the central aspects of insulin formulations for injection. The hexamer is far more stable than the monomer, which is desirable for practical reasons; however, the monomer is a much faster-reacting drug because diffusion rate is inversely related to particle size. A fast-reacting drug means insulin injections do not have to precede mealtimes by hours, which in turn gives people with diabetes more flexibility in their daily schedules. Insulin can aggregate and form fibrillar interdigitated beta-sheets. This can cause injection <b>amyloidosis,</b> and prevents the storage of insulin for long periods.|$|E

500|$|While PrP is {{considered}} the only mammalian prion, prion-like domains {{have been found in}} a variety of other mammalian proteins. Some of these proteins have been implicated in the ontogeny of age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, known as Motor Neurone Disease outside the US), [...] frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-positive inclusions (FTLD-U), Alzheimer's disease, and Huntington's disease, as well as some forms of Systemic <b>Amyloidosis</b> including AA (Secondary) <b>Amyloidosis</b> that develops in humans and animals with inflammatory and infectious diseases such as Tuberculosis, Crohn's disease, Rheumatoid arthritis, and HIV AIDS.
