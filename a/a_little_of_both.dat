500|$|Scholastic philosopher John Duns Scotus {{argued that}} the only moral {{obligations}} that God could not take away from humans are to love God, as God is, definitionally, the most loveable thing[...] Scotus {{argued that the}} natural law, in the strictest sense, contains only what is self-evidently analytically true and that God could not make these statements false. This means that the commands of natural law do not depend on God's will, and thus form the first three commandments of the Ten Commandments. The last seven of the Ten Commandments {{do not belong to}} the natural law in the strictest sense. Whilst our duties to God are self-evident, true by definition, and unchangeable even by God, our duties to others (found on the second tablet) were arbitrarily willed by God and are within his power to revoke and replace (although, the third commandment, to honour the Sabbath and keep it holy, has <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>of</b> <b>both,</b> as we are absolutely obliged to render worship to God, but there is no obligation in natural law to do it on this day or that). Scotus does note, however that the last seven commandments [...] "are highly consonant with , though they do not follow necessarily from first practical priciples that are known in virtue of their terms and are necessarily known by any intellect ...|$|E

[...] Stylus Magazine called it [...] "a great album, and an outstanding place for prospective new Wilco fans to start." [...] Neumu.net gave it nine stars out of ten and called it [...] "a fierce record". Almost Cool gave it a score of 8.75 out of ten and said, [...] "I'm not sure if it's the work by O'Rourke or the progression of the group (or <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>of</b> <b>both),</b> but this disc is so multi-layered that it's easy to hear new things many many times after the first listen." [...] Billboard gave it a favorable review and called it [...] "a more adventurous and rewarding release". The Austin Chronicle gave it four stars out of five and said that [...] "After a while -- a familiarity period if you will -- {{it becomes clear that}} these songs are not only fully realized, they're damn near brilliant." [...] Playlouder gave it four stars out of five and called it [...] "The most worth-the-wait long-awaited album in the world... ever? Could be..." [...] Uncut also gave the album four stars out of five and said, [...] "The most common description of this much-discussed album {{over the past few months}} is that YHF is Americana's Kid A. In truth, it's more successful than that." [...] Blender likewise gave it four stars out of five and stated: [...] "Tweedy whittles down the arrangements and drops in enough experimental nuances to make the whole thing sound refreshingly lo-fi." [...] Q likewise gave it four stars and called it [...] "battered, bonkers and bewitching in equal parts" [...] and that it [...] "at last finds Wilco's 'interesting' phase become downright fascinating." [...] Yahoo! Music UK gave it eight stars out of ten and said, [...] "Tweedy takes conventional songforms birthed on his acoustic guitar and scrambles them completely, reassembled into fractured, dissonant epics with the help of the reliably brilliant Jim O'Rourke." ...|$|E

By doing this, it is no longer a dance game and many arrows do not fit perfectly with the beat because there are simply too many of them.

To compromise is to do neither one thing nor the other but <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>of</b> <b>both.</b> But you can't do that with right and wrong. It is a queer thing, but a half right never is as good as a whole right, while a half wrong often, very often, is as bad as a whole wrong.|$|E
60|$|For a {{time the}} Master of the Earth was not even master of his own mind. Even his will seemed a will not his own, his own acts {{surprised}} him and were but {{a part of the}} confusion of strange experiences that poured across his being. These things were definite, the aeroplanes were coming, Helen Wotton had warned the people of their coming, and he was Master of the Earth. Each of these facts seemed struggling for complete possession of his thoughts. They protruded from a background of swarming halls, elevated passages, rooms jammed with ward leaders in council kinematograph and telephone rooms, and windows looking out on a seething sea of marching men. The man in yellow, and men whom he fancied were called Ward Leaders, were either propelling him forward or following him obediently; it was hard to tell. Perhaps they were doing <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>of</b> <b>both.</b> Perhaps some power unseen and unsuspected, propelled them all. He was aware {{that he was going to}} make a proclamation to the People of the Earth, aware of certain grandiose phrases floating in his mind as the thing he meant to say. Many little things happened, and then he found himself with the man in yellow entering a little room where this proclamation of his was to be made.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} a fast search algo-rithm for vector quantisation (VQ) -based recogni-tion of isolated words. It incorporates {{the property of}} high correlation between speech feature vectors of consecutive frames with the method of triangular inequality elimination to relieve the computational burden of vector-quantising the test feature vectors by full code-book search, and uses the extended partial distortion method to compress the incomplete matching computations of wildly mismatched words. Overall computational load can therefore be drastically reduced while the recognition per-formance of full search can be retained. Experi-mental results show that about 93 % of multiplications and additions can be saved with <b>a</b> <b>little</b> increase <b>of</b> <b>both</b> comparisons and memory space. ...|$|R

60|$|Dan's face {{shone with}} flattered pride and joyous triumph. He bubbled out some happy incoherencies about the honour and pleasure, {{while at the}} same time he beamed with tender {{gratitude}} upon Mrs. Brinkley, who was behaving with a gracious, humorous kindliness to the aliens cast upon her mercies. Mrs. Frobisher, after a half-hour of Boston society, was not that presence of easy gaiety which crossed Dan's path on the Portland pavement the morning of his arrival from Campobello; but she was still a handsome, effective woman, of whom you would have hesitated to say whether she was showy or distinguished. Perhaps she was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>of</b> <b>both,</b> with an air of command bred of supremacy in frontier garrisons; her sister was like her in the way that a young girl may be like a young matron. They blossomed alike in the genial atmosphere of Mrs. Brinkley and of Mr. Corey. He began at once to make bantering speeches with them both. The friendliness of an old man and a stout elderly woman might not have been their ideal of success at an evening party, used as they were to the unstinted homage of young captains and lieutenants, but a brief experience of Mrs. Bellingham's hospitality must have taught them humility; and when a stout, elderly gentleman, whose baldness was still trying to be blond, joined the group, the spectacle was not without its points of resemblance to a social ovation. Perhaps it was a Boston social ovation.|$|E
6000|$|... "My lads, the {{skeleton}} that lies over yonder furnishes {{me with a}} text: `One is taken, and another left.' That poor fellow was taken away from this life. You and I have been left behind. Assuredly we have been left for a good purpose, and the merciful God who has spared us means that we should henceforth live for His glory. My lads, you all know what a blessed thing {{is a state of}} peace, and you also know what a miserable thing it is to be for ever quarrelling. Since we landed on this island, we've had <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>of</b> <b>both.</b> I took in hand to stop the quarrelling the other day, in my own way. P'r'aps it wasn't altogether my own way either, for I've read in the Bible of smiting a scorner, that the simple might take warning. However, be that as it may, that system may serve a turn; but it's not the straight road to come to a state of peace. If we are to live happily here, my lads, to avoid quarrelling, to honour our Maker, and to prove to each other--as well as to angels and devils, who may be lookin' on for all that I know--that we stand on a higher level than the brutes, we must square our conduct by the rules and laws laid down by the Prince of Peace, whose desire is that on earth men should live together in peace and goodwill. I'll now read you some of these laws." ...|$|E
60|$|It is not {{possible}} to separate an emotion or a spiritual state from the image that calls it up and gives it expression. Michael Angelo's Moses, Velasquez' Philip the Second, the colour purple, a crucifix, call into life an emotion or state that vanishes with them because they are its only possible expression, and that is why no mind is more valuable than the images it contains. The imaginative writer differs from the saint in that he identifies himself--to the neglect of his own soul, alas!--with the soul of the world, and frees himself from all that is impermanent in that soul, an ascetic not of women and wine, but of the newspapers. That which is permanent in the soul of the world upon the other hand, the great passions that trouble all and have but a brief recurring life of flower and seed in any man, is the renunciation of the saint who seeks not an eternal art, but his own eternity. The artist stands between the saint and the world of impermanent things, and just in so far as his mind dwells on what is impermanent in his sense, on all that 'modern experience and the discussion of our interests,' that is to say on what never recurs, as desire and hope, terror and weariness, spring and autumn recur in varying rhythms, will his mind become critical, as distinguished from creative, and his emotions wither. He will think less of what he sees and more of his own attitude towards it, and will express this attitude by an essentially critical selection and emphasis. I am not quite sure of my memory but I think that Mr. Ricketts has said in his book on the Prado that he feels the critic in Velasquez {{for the first time in}} painting, and we all feel the critic in Whistler and Degas, in Browning, even in Mr. Swinburne, in the finest art of all ages but the greatest. The end for art is the ecstasy awakened by the presence before an ever changing mind of what is permanent in the world, or by the arousing of that mind itself into the very delicate and fastidious mood habitual with it when it is seeking those permanent & recurring things. There is <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> ecstasies at all times, but at this time we have a small measure of the creative impulse itself, of the divine vision, a great one of 'the lost traveller's dream under the hill,' perhaps because all the old simple things have been painted or written, and they will only have meaning for us again when a new race or a new civilisation has made us look upon all with new eyesight.|$|E
