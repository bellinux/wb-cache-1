Correa believed that the fund unjustly allocated the wealth generated by the country's oil; 70% of it went to pay back foreign debt, while 20% was set aside to stabilize oil revenues and 10% was spent on health and education programs. Given that over half of Ecuador's population were deemed to be living in poverty, Correa convinced Congress that a greater share of the fund should be spent on social programs to alleviate the effects of poverty; as a result, the portion spent on debt repayment was reduced to 50% and that allocated to health and education was increased to 30%.

40|$|We {{examine whether}} loan {{decisions}} {{are affected by}} the internal decision structure of the bank. Banks typically grant decision rights on straight-forward loans entirely to individual loan officers. For more risky loans these officers have to seek ratification for their loan proposals at higher hierarchical levels within banks (e. g., a credit committee). As banks typically provide loan officers with incentives to make loans, loan officers can increase the likelihood of loan approval by communicating the risk-return characteristics of the loan request favorably. Using internal records from a bank, our sample consists of <b>approved</b> <b>loan</b> requests coming from small firms. Our evidence suggests that loan contracts approved at higher hierarchical levels vis-à-vis those approved by loan officers feature lower loan rates and a greater likelihood of an adverse risk re-classification one year after the loan approval...|$|E

Furthermore, minority-owned and female-owned firms gener-ated 5. 9 million and 7. 6 million jobs, respec-tively, in 2007 (Small Business Administration 2011). 1 The SSBF is a nationally representative survey of about 4, 000 small businesses in the United States conducted by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve.

40|$|This paper {{consider}} {{the task of}} learning discriminative classifiers of data when some class labels are missing from the data set(so-called “semi-supervised ” learning), specifically when the labeled data are not drawn from the same distribution as the unlabeled data. This {{is an important issue}} in domains in which learning from only the labeled samples can result in a classifier that is not appropriate for the distribution of data to which it is to be applied. For example, lending institutions create models of who is likely to repay a loan from training sets consisting of people in their records who were given loans in the past; however, the institution only <b>approved</b> <b>loan</b> applications of those it judged likely to repay a loan. Learning from only approved loans yields an incorrect model because the training set is a biased sample of the general population of applicants, which is the population in which the model is to be used. Semi-supervised learning attempts to overcome this bias by including the unlabeled data in the learning process. This paper systematically explores the different types of bias that can arise in a semi-supervised setting, with examples of real-world situations. We use Bayesian networks to formalize each type of bias as a set of conditional independence relationships and for each case we present an overview of available learnin...|$|E
40|$|Most {{learning}} methods {{assume that}} the training set is drawn randomly from the population to which the learned model is to be applied. However in many applications this assumption is invalid. For example, lending institutions create models of who is likely to repay a loan from training sets consisting of people in their records to whom loans were given in the past; however, the institution <b>approved</b> <b>loan</b> applications previously based on who was thought unlikely to default. Learning from only approved loans yields an incorrect model because the training set is a biased sample {{of the general population}} of applicants. The issue of including rejected samples in the learning process, or alternatively using rejected samples to adjust a model learned from accepted samples only, is called reject inference. The main contribution of this paper is a systematic analysis of different cases that arise in reject inference, with explanations of which cases arise in various real-world situations. We use Bayesian networks to formalize each case as a set of conditional independence relationships and identify eight cases, including the familiar missing completely at random (MCAR), missing at random (MAR), and missing not at random (MNAR) cases. For each case we present an overview of available learning algorithms. These algorithms have been published in separate fields of research, including epidemiology, econometrics, clinical trial evaluation, sociology, and credit scoring; our second major contribution is to describe these algorithms in a common framework...|$|E

These signals, we have chosen to distribute into 4 areas,management and personal characteristics, market, financial measures and the bank’swork process. Adverse selection and moral hazard problems are something that affectsSMEs and the bank’s work process at which a decision will be taken. The reason forthese problems is information asymmetry. Therefore, it creates trust problems betweenlenders and borrowers, and signals are sent from the borrower to convince the lenderabout the company’s potential and future success. The thesis aims to increase knowledge and understanding of the areas that increaseSMEs ability to obtain financing. The thesis also aims to increase knowledge about howthe bank official’s working process look like and what affects the individual’s decision.

Thus, the rationale behind for undertaking this study is to deeply investigate the causes of credit management problems and to suggest the possible solutions that enable the bank to run its operation in a safest way as credit is known to be the main stay of all banks. The ability of banks to formulate and adhere to policies and procedures that promote credit quality and curtail non-performing loans is the means to survive in the stiff competition. Inability to create and build up quality loans and credit worthy customers leads to default risk and bankruptcy as well as hampers economic growth of a country. However, little work is done to search the ways and means that enable to quality loan creation and growth as well as to determine the relationship between the theories, concepts and credit policies both at country or regional level. The main objective of the study is to evaluate the performance of credit management of Wegagen bank in Tigray Region as compared to National Bank’s requirements in comparison with its credit policy and procedures. For {{the purpose of the study}} both primary and secondary data are used. Primary data is collected using semi structured questionnaires.

At this writing (1985) Chrysler's $ 1. 2 billion in government backed loans has been paid back seven years ahead of schedule and the company has reported profits well over $ 550 million. During Chrysler's recovery, a large public relations and advertising campaign was launched to promote Chrysler's new products and to present consumers with a more positive image of the company. This study was undertaken for two purposes. The first {{was to examine the}} changes in the presentation and content of Chrysler's image during the campaign. The second was to undertake a Burkean analysis of the persuasive messages of the campaign in order to assess their motivational structure, ideological perspective and potential effectiveness.

The results were a profile of Chrysler's attempts to gain identification with its constituents. What was the motivational and ideological thrust of the appeals? It was discovered that prior to the federal loan guarantee, Chrysler utilized scenic arguments claiming its own victimage. High energy costs, Japanese imports, runaway inflation, and government regulations were cited as factors contributing to its financial difficulties. After Chrysler successfully repaid its loan, its message was changed to emphasize the Agent: We the New Chrysler Corporation have great leadership and competence and these are the ingredients that led to our success.
