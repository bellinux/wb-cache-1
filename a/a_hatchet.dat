5|$|Asylum {{digitally}} created {{weapons for}} various scenes. In {{the scene in}} which Nolan is killed suddenly by {{a shot in the}} head from Jason's arrow, Asylum created the arrow in post-production. Another scene involved Jason hurling <b>a</b> <b>hatchet</b> at Lawrence as he runs away, striking him in the back. The shot of <b>a</b> <b>hatchet</b> flying through the airin one instance appearing in the same frame as the actorwould be too difficult to achieve practically. Asylum rendered a complete 3D model of the hatchet then inserted the model into the frames leading up to the frame in which it hits the character in the back. One of the final images added by Asylum was for Trent's death scene. Here, Asylum digitally created a metal spike that bursts through Trent's chest as Jason slams him onto the back of a tow truck.|$|E
5|$|As {{the most}} {{abundant}} large predator in the Morrison Formation, Allosaurus {{was at the top}} of the food chain, probably preying on contemporaneous large herbivorous dinosaurs, and perhaps even other predators. Potential prey included ornithopods, stegosaurids, and sauropods. Some paleontologists interpret Allosaurus as having had cooperative social behavior, and hunting in packs, while others believe individuals may have been aggressive toward each other, and that congregations of this genus are the result of lone individuals feeding on the same carcasses. It may have attacked large prey by ambush, using its upper jaw like <b>a</b> <b>hatchet.</b>|$|E

25|$|Fuel can be {{different}} types of timber. Timber ranges from small logs two or three inches (76mm) across to larger logs that can burn for hours. It is typically difficult to gather without <b>a</b> <b>hatchet</b> or other cutting tool. In heavily used campsites, fuel wood {{can be hard to}} find, so it may have to purchased at a nearby store or be brought from home. However, untreated wood should not be transported due to the probability that invasive species of bugs will be transported with it. Heat-treated wood such as kiln-dried lumber is safe to transport.|$|E

25|$|Between 11 September and 13 September 1970, {{a covert}} {{incursion}} took place into southeastern Laos, which {{was led by}} <b>a</b> <b>Hatchet</b> Force, {{in order to create}} a diversion for an offensive by the Royal Lao Army against the People's Army of Vietnam. 16 Americans and 110 Montagnard tribesmen. The mission, commanded by Captain Eugene McCarley, landed 60 miles to the west of their launch site at Dak To. Equipment caches and enemy troop dispositions were located and bombarded from the air, despite constant enemy contact, and two footlockers of intelligence were retrieved. The Hatchet Force then divided into three teams and were evacuated, leaving at least 54 PAVN soldiers killed. The raid would attract controversy in 1998 over the allegedly fabricated CNN report of the use of Sarin, and other alleged war crimes by Peter Arnett, Producer April Oliver, Producer Jack Smith, Sr. Producer Pam Hill, and others.|$|E
25|$|Though {{all these}} writers appear to regard these objects {{as a kind}} of battle-axe (and are {{probably}} correct so far as those having a ray prolonged into <b>a</b> <b>hatchet</b> are concerned), there are several considerations that suggest these objects were habitually used as weapons. The larger of the stars (which are as heavy as a pound and a quarter) no doubt might be used effectively; but the smaller ones, weighing only a few ounces, would not be very formidable; and taking them as a whole they are less adapted either for offensive or defensive purposes than most of the other stone implements. To this may be added that many are uninjured, and do not seem to have been put to any use whatever. Francisco Campaña (a half-Indian who joined the latter part of Whymper's journey) had assisted in the examination of graves in Peru, and said these stars in stone were found there placed upon the breasts of corpses; and it seems likely that they were to the Children of the Sun symbols of the luminary that they worshipped.|$|E
