5|$|Bryan v. Itasca County, 426 U.S. 373 (1976), {{was a case}} {{in which}} the Supreme Court of the United States held that a state did {{not have the right to}} assess a tax on the {{property}} of a Native American (Indian) living on tribal land <b>absent</b> <b>a</b> specific Congressional grant of authority to do so.|$|E
5|$|Eisenhower gave Nixon {{responsibilities}} {{during his}} term as vice president—more {{than any previous}} vice president. Nixon attended Cabinet and National Security Council meetings and chaired them when Eisenhower was <b>absent.</b> <b>A</b> 1953 tour of the Far East succeeded in increasing local goodwill toward the United States and prompted Nixon to appreciate {{the potential of the}} region as an industrial center. He visited Saigon and Hanoi in French Indochina. On his return to the United States at the end of 1953, Nixon increased the amount of time he devoted to foreign relations.|$|E
5|$|Julien (Radziwilowicz) is {{a middle-aged}} clockmaker who lives {{alone with his}} cat in a large house in the Paris suburbs. Julien is blackmailing 'Madame X' (Brochet) who is {{importing}} fake antique Chinese silks, and may have murdered her sister. By chance, he meets Marie (Béart), {{a beautiful young woman}} he last saw a year ago, and they begin a passionate relationship. Though elusive, Marie agrees to move in with him; she acts strangely at times and appears <b>absent.</b> <b>A</b> mystery connects Marie to Madame X's dead sister and in uncovering Marie's secret Julien risks losing her. The film is separated into four parts, named to reflect the narrative perspective.|$|E

5|$|The king grows only {{slightly}} larger after initial mating {{and continues to}} mate with the queen for life (a termite queen can live between 30 to 50years); this {{is very different from}} ant colonies, in which a queen mates once with the male(s) and stores the gametes for life, as the male ants die shortly after mating. If a queen is <b>absent,</b> <b>a</b> termite king produces pheromones which encourage the development of replacement termite queens. As the queen and king are monogamous, sperm competition does not occur.|$|E
5|$|Other mammals {{found in}} Greater London are hedgehogs, rats, mice, rabbit, shrew, vole, and squirrels, In wilder areas of Outer London, such as Epping Forest, {{a wide variety}} of mammals are found {{including}} hare, badger, field, bank and water vole, wood mouse, yellow-necked mouse, mole, shrew, and weasel, in addition to fox, squirrel and hedgehog. A dead otter was found at The Highway, in Wapping, about a mile from the Tower Bridge, which would suggest that they have begun to move back after being <b>absent</b> <b>a</b> hundred years from the city. Ten of England's eighteen species of bats have been recorded in Epping Forest: soprano, nathusius and common pipistrelles, noctule, serotine, barbastelle, daubenton's, brown Long-eared, natterer's and leisler's.|$|E
5|$|The stomach has the {{characteristic}} pattern of sigmodontines (unilocular-hemiglandular); {{it is not}} split in two chambers by an incisura angularis and the front part (antrum) is covered by a glandular epithelium. The gall bladder is <b>absent,</b> <b>a</b> synapomorphy (shared-derived character) of Oryzomyini. The karyotype includes 56chromosomes and a fundamental number of 60chromosomal arms (2n=56, FN=60). The form of the sex chromosomes {{has been used to}} distinguish the marsh rice rat from Oryzomys couesi, but may be too variable among Oryzomys species to be useful in differentiating them. X chromosome inactivation occurs in the marsh rice rat, though the animal lacks LINE-1 retrotransposons, which have been suggested as components of the inactivation process. Mutants with fused or additional molars and with light fur have been recorded in laboratory colonies; the abnormal molars are apparently the result of a single autosomal recessive mutation. At about 50%, hematocrit (the proportion of red blood cells in the blood) is high in the marsh rice rat compared to other rodents; this may be an adaptation that enables the rice rat to increase oxygen capacity while swimming under water.|$|E

50|$|Next, Article One, Section 3, Clause 5 {{provides}} {{that in the}} absence of the vice president the Senate could choose a president pro tempore to temporarily preside and perform the duties of the chair. Since vice presidents presided routinely in the 18th and 19th centuries, the Senate thought it necessary to choose a president pro tempore only for the limited periods when the vice president might be ill or otherwise <b>absent.</b> <b>As</b> a result, the Senate frequently elected several presidents pro tempore during a single session.|$|R
