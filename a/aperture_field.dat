5000|$|Since leakage occurs {{over the}} length of the slit in the waveguiding structure, the whole length {{constitutes}} the antenna's effective aperture unless the leakage rate is so great that the power has effectively leaked away before reaching the end of the slit.A large attenuation constant implies a short effective aperture, so that the radiated beam has a large beamwidth. Conversely, a low value of α results in a long effective aperture and a narrow beam, provided the physical aperture is sufficiently long.Since power is radiated continuously along the length, the <b>aperture</b> <b>field</b> of a leaky-wave antenna with strictly-uniform geometry has an exponential decay (usually slow), so that the sidelobe behavior is poor. The presence of the sidelobes is essentially because the structure is finite along z.When we change the cross-sectional geometry of the guiding structure to modify the value of α at some point z, however, {{it is likely that the}} value of β at that point is also modified slightly. However, since β must not be changed, the geometry must be further altered to restore the value of β, thereby changing α somewhat as well.In practice, this difficulty may require a two-step process. The practice is then to vary the value of α slowly along the length in a specified way while maintaining β constant (that is the angle of maximum radiation), so as to adjust the amplitude of the aperture distribution A(z) to yield the desired sidelobe performance.We can divide uniform leaky-wave antennas into air-filled ones and partially dielectric-filled ones. In the first case, since the transverse wavenumber kt is then a constant with frequency, the beamwidth of the radiation remains exactly constantas the beam is scanned by varying the frequency. In fact, since: ...|$|E

30|$|The {{present study}} dealt {{only with a}} static {{reservoir}} where the spatially varying <b>aperture</b> <b>field</b> stayed constant with time. Real reservoirs, however, will experience thermal, hydraulic, mechanical, and chemical (THMC) changes that alter the <b>aperture</b> <b>field</b> throughout the energy extraction process. In addition to THMC effects, fracture shearing/slipping during heat extraction will also change the <b>aperture</b> <b>field.</b> In general, aperture change due to THMC effects will increase permeability/aperture in the region enclosed by the injection and production well (Taron and Elsworth 2009; Ghassemi and Zhou 2011). Fracture slippage will {{lead to an increase}} in the standard deviation of the aperture fluctuations and result in preferential flow channeling in the direction perpendicular to the shear displacement (Yeo et al. 1998; Plouraboué et al. 2000; Watanabe et al. 2008). Although our work did not incorporate fracture slippage and THMC effects it, nonetheless, provides a framework through which to understand how spatial aperture fluctuations affect thermal performance. It shows that fracture surface variations are a reservoir characteristic that researchers should consider in modeling discretely fractured geothermal reservoirs and performing techo-economic analysis (Beckers et al. 2014; Held et al. 2014). Our systematic approach for generating spatially varying apertures can be used in conjunction with modeling the effects that THMC and fracture slippage have on reservoir thermal performance, by providing a base <b>aperture</b> <b>field</b> that already has a spatially varying <b>aperture</b> <b>field.</b>|$|E

40|$|Geometrical defects of a {{high gain}} {{reflector}} antenna can cause the radiation pattern of the antenna to fail to meet its specifications. These defects give rise to loss of gain, widening of the main beam and raising of sidelobes. The geometrical defects can be identified, and subsequently corrected, by utilizing information contained in the phase of the copolar <b>aperture</b> <b>field</b> distribution. For technical reasons, this phase can be difficult or inconvenient to measure directly. Therefore, indirect methods of deducing the phase are often preferred. This thesis introduces an iterative algorithm, called the modified Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm, which has been developed for retrieving the copolar <b>aperture</b> <b>field</b> phase distribution from the far field copolar amplitude pattern. In order to aid convergence of this algorithm, it incorporates information concerning the design and any known aspect of the antenna. The modified Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm {{is based on the}} conventional Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm, originally developed for electron microscopy, but incorporates features of Fienup's phase retrieval algorithms. This thesis reviews radio engineering theory with an emphasis on high gain reflector antennas. In particular, the Fourier transform relationship between the copolar <b>aperture</b> <b>field</b> distribution and the copolar radiation pattern is critically examined. The problem of retrieving the copolar <b>aperture</b> <b>field</b> distribution from the amplitude of its Fourier transform is called a Fourier phase problem. The Fourier phase problem, the uniqueness of its solutions and iterative algorithms for solving it are discussed. Other established methods for determining geometrical defects of an antenna are described and their relative advantages and disadvantages are assessed. The main advantage of the modified Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm is that it requires measurement of only a single copolar amplitude pattern. The modified Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm is evaluated by applying it to computer simulated data and to measured amplitude patterns of an acoustic antenna. This evaluation illustrates the relationship between the accuracy of the data to which the algorithm is applied and the accuracy of the retrieved copolar <b>aperture</b> <b>field</b> phase distribution. The performance of the algorithm appears to be insensitive to the location and dimensions of the geometrical defects of the antenna. The optimum form of the algorithm seems to be versatile and robust enough to offer real hope of being able to retrieve, to a useful level of accuracy, the phase of the <b>aperture</b> <b>field</b> from a single measured radiation pattern amplitude (i. e. {{there is no need to}} measure the phase of the radiation pattern) ...|$|E

40|$|A {{systematic}} numerical {{method was}} presented to investigate the effect of aperture distribution on the relation of capillary pressure versus fluid saturation (P-S relation) for a single fracture. The fracture was conceptualized as a two-dimensional lattice-grid model and its <b>aperture</b> <b>field</b> was described by a probability distribution. Based on the invasion percolation theory, a program was developed to simulate the quasi-static displacement. The simulation was verified validly by comparisons of the experimental results. The effects of the statistical parameters were further quantified. The {{results show that the}} largest local aperture on the fracture boundary determines the AEV. The larger mean decreases the variation coefficient, which causes the more uniform <b>aperture</b> <b>field,</b> smoother air invasion front, and steeper capillary pressure-saturation curve (CPSC). The larger standard deviation increases not only the range but also the contrast degree of the apertures, thus providing a nondeterministic rule in the P-S relation. The larger correlation length causes a more homogeneous <b>aperture</b> <b>field</b> and a dual connectivity of the fracture. The increase of the difference and contrast degree between the small and large apertures results in dual-aperture fields.
