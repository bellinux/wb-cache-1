This visit also failed, but members of the expedition left collecting material with a Rev. H. M. C. Rogers, then chaplain on Tristan da Cunha. The following year two study skins arrived in the Natural History Museum, London, followed soon after by another skin and a specimen in spirits. Physician Percy Lowe was then {{able to use the}} skins to describe the species. He did so, briefly, {{at a meeting of the}} British Ornithologists' Club, in 1923.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time that Caprivi began {{ordering}} new protected cruisers, he also authorized the construction of smaller unprotected cruisers for use in Germany's overseas colonies.

A further six vessels of the , which were improved versions that were larger and faster than their predecessors, followed over the next five years. A final, much larger vessel, , was laid down in 1892; her design was based on contemporary protected cruisers like Kaiserin Augusta. She represented <b>another</b> <b>attempt</b> to merge the colonial cruiser and fleet scout, which was unsuccessful. As a result, the German naval designers began work on the , which provided the basis for all future German light cruisers.|$|E
