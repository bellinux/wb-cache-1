5|$|F-84G was {{the first}} fighter with {{built-in}} <b>aerial</b> <b>refueling</b> capability and the first single-seat aircraft capable of carrying a nuclear bomb.|$|E
5|$|Boeing is {{developing}} a roll-on/roll-off <b>aerial</b> <b>refueling</b> kit, which would give the V-22 the ability to refuel other aircraft. Having an <b>aerial</b> <b>refueling</b> capability that can be based on Wasp-class amphibious assault ships would increase the striking power of Marine F-35Bs, as they would not rely on refueling assets {{that could only be}} based on full-sized Nimitz-class aircraft carriers or from land bases. The roll-on/roll-off kit can also be applicable to intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) functions. Boeing funded a non-functional demonstration on a VMX-22 aircraft; a prototype kit was successfully tested with an F/A-18 on 5 September 2013.|$|E
5|$|On 20 August 1953, 17 F-84Gs using <b>aerial</b> <b>refueling</b> {{flew from}} the United States to the United Kingdom. The 4,485-mile (3,900nmi, 7,220km) journey was the longest-ever nonstop flight by jet fighters.|$|E

5|$|For the {{majority}} of its operational lifetime, Loring was a heavy bomber, <b>aerial</b> <b>refueling,</b> and interception facility for military aircraft, equipment, and supplies first as part of Strategic Air Command (SAC) (1947–1992), then as part of the succeeding Air Combat Command (ACC) (1992–1994).|$|E
5|$|As the Cold War progressed, so did {{the need}} for new {{aircraft}} and techniques. The first KC-97 Stratofreighter arrived at Loring with the activation of the 42d Air Refueling Squadron in January 1955. The B-36's were not actually equipped to perform <b>aerial</b> <b>refueling,</b> so the planes supported other units until the arrival of the B-52 in 1956. Eventually, 21 tankers were based at Loring, along with 30 air crews.|$|E
5|$|KC-767 Tanker Transport – the 767-200ER-based <b>aerial</b> <b>refueling</b> {{platform}} {{operated by}} the Italian Air Force (Aeronautica Militare), and the Japan Self-Defense Forces. Modifications conducted by Boeing Integrated Defense Systems include {{the addition of a}} fly-by-wire refueling boom, strengthened flaps, and optional auxiliary fuel tanks, as well as structural reinforcement and modified avionics. The four KC-767Js ordered by Japan have been delivered. The Aeronautica Militare received the first of its four KC-767As in January 2011.|$|E

5|$|An-188: A {{program to}} develop this variant was {{launched}} at the 2015 Paris Air Show. This variant will essentially be a four jet engine powered heavy-medium transport with modernized NATO- compatible western cockpit, slightly enlarged wings, winglets and <b>aerial</b> <b>refueling</b> capabilities. The An-188 is intended {{to fill the gap}} between a C-130 and C-17 while being a direct competitor to the A400M. Plans include incorporating a western engine option (as well as a Ukrainian one) to appeal to western markets and reduce dependency on eastern markets.|$|E
5|$|KC-33A – A {{proposed}} 747 {{was also}} adapted as an <b>aerial</b> <b>refueling</b> tanker and was bid against the DC-10-30 during the 1970s Advanced Cargo Transport Aircraft (ACTA) program {{that produced the}} KC-10A Extender. Before the 1979 Iranian Revolution, Iran bought four 747-100 aircraft with air-refueling boom conversions to support its fleet of F-4 Phantoms. There is a report of using a KC-33A in H-3 airstrike during Iran–Iraq War. It is unknown whether these aircraft remain usable as tankers. Since then, other proposals have emerged for conversion of later 747-400 aircraft for this role.|$|E
5|$|The F-84 flew a {{total of}} 86,408 missions, {{dropping}} 55,586tons (50,427metric tons) of bombs and 6,129tons (5,560metric tons) of napalm. The USAF claimed F-84s were responsible for 60% of all ground targets destroyed in the war. Notable F-84 operations included the 1952 attack on the Sui-ho Dam. During the war, the F-84 became the first USAF fighter to utilize <b>aerial</b> <b>refueling.</b> In aerial combat, F-84 pilots were credited with eight MiG-15 kills against a Soviet-claimed loss of 64aircraft. The total losses were 335 F-84D, E and G models.|$|E

50|$|At {{the end of}} January 1990, HMH-461 {{deployed}} four {{aircraft to}} Combined Arms Exercise (CAX) 3/4-90. During this deployment, two aircraft made Marine Corps aviation history by being the first Marine Corps helicopters to <b>aerial</b> <b>refuel</b> using night vision goggles.|$|R
5|$|Two {{main reasons}} {{contributed to the}} cancellation. The XF-85's {{deficiencies}} revealed in flight testing included a lackluster performance in relation to contemporary jet fighters, and the high demands on pilot skill experienced during docking revealed a critical shortcoming that was never fully corrected. The development of practical <b>aerial</b> <b>refueling</b> for conventional fighters used as bomber escort was also {{a factor in the}} cancellation. The two Goblins flew seven times, with a total flight time of 2 hours and 19 minutes with only three of the free flights ending in a successful hookup. Schoch was the only pilot who ever flew the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the game, the player has to take off the runway at an Allied base. Afterwards they can fly around and look for enemies to engage. The player can open their Satellite Intelligence Map, which shows a live map of the {{immediate}} coastline with items of interest, such as, friendly bases, enemy positions, and refuelling locations. The player can perform various flight manoeuvres and stunts mid-air, such are loops, rolls, or dummy stalls. Flying, especially at high altitudes, spends the plane's fuel and the player must either return to their base or perform an <b>aerial</b> <b>refueling.</b> To refuel mid-air, the player has to rendezvous with a refuelling plane at the specified coordinates and perform a boom and receptacle refuelling manoeuvre.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in late 1965, {{a number}} of B-52Ds {{underwent}} Big Belly modifications to increase bomb capacity for carpet bombings. While the external payload remained at 24 of 500lb (227kg) or 750lb (340kg) bombs, the internal capacity increased from 27 to 84 for 500lb bombs, or from 27 to 42 for 750lb bombs. The modification created enough capacity {{for a total of}} 60,000lb (27,215kg) using 108 bombs. Thus modified, B-52Ds could carry 22,000lb (9,980kg) more than B-52Fs. Designed to replace B-52Fs, modified B-52Ds entered combat in April 1966 flying from Andersen Air Force Base, Guam. Each bombing mission lasted 10 to 12 hours and included an <b>aerial</b> <b>refueling</b> by KC-135 Stratotankers. In spring 1967, B-52s began flying from U Tapao Airfield in Thailand so that refueling was not required.|$|E
50|$|In 1970, {{the unit}} moved to NAS Glenview, Illinois. Five years later, they traded the C-119F Packets for the KC-130F Hercules. The “Thundering Herd” {{received}} its current squadron designation, Marine <b>Aerial</b> <b>Refueler</b> Transport Squadron 234 (VMGR-234), on October 23, 1983.|$|R
50|$|The {{squadron}} was activated on October 1, 1986 as Marine <b>Aerial</b> <b>Refueler</b> Transport Training Squadron 253 (VMGRT-253). They {{received their}} first C-130 Hercules aircraft, bureau number 149803 on November 20, 1986. The squadron held its official commissioning ceremony on January 30, 1987.|$|R
50|$|The Lancers {{were the}} second Marine Corps {{squadron}} to deploy after the September 11 attacks, following their <b>aerial</b> <b>refueler</b> aircraft from VMGR-152, the Sumos. The squadron left MCAS Iwakuni on 12 September and after being refueled over Iwo Jima, began flying Combat Air Patrols over Guam {{in support of}} Operation Noble Eagle.|$|R
5|$|During World War II, American bombers {{such as the}} Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, Consolidated B-24 Liberator and Boeing B-29 Superfortress were {{protected}} by long-range escort fighters such as the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt and North American P-51 Mustang. These fighters could not match {{the range of the}} Northrop B-35 or Convair B-36, the next generation of bombers developed by the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF). The development cost for longer-ranged fighters was high, while <b>aerial</b> <b>refueling</b> was still considered risky and technologically difficult. Pilot fatigue had also been a problem during long fighter escort missions in Europe and the Pacific, giving further impetus to innovative approaches.|$|E
5|$|The {{outright}} {{cancellation of}} the Boeing contract on 11 December 1947 was staved off by a plea from its president William McPherson Allen to the Secretary of the Air Force Stuart Symington. Allen reasoned that the design was capable of being adapted to new aviation technology and more stringent requirements. In January 1948 Boeing was instructed to thoroughly explore recent technological innovations, including <b>aerial</b> <b>refueling</b> and the flying wing. Noting stability and control problems Northrop was experiencing with their YB-35 and YB-49 flying wing bombers, Boeing insisted on a conventional aircraft, and in April 1948 presented a US$30million (US$ today) proposal for design, construction, and testing of two Model 464-35 prototypes. Further revisions during 1948 resulted in an aircraft with {{a top speed of}} 513miles per hour (445kn, 825km/h) at 35,000feet (10,700m), a range of 6,909miles (6,005nmi, 11,125km), and a 280,000pounds (125,000kg) gross weight, which included 10,000pounds (4,500kg) of bombs and 19,875USgallons (75,225L) of fuel.|$|E
5|$|The F-111 would {{initially}} have a mixed {{record in}} Southeast Asia, when a detachment of six aircraft from the 474th Tactical Fighter Wing were deployed to Takhli RTAFB in Thailand, in early 1968, {{as part of}} Operation Combat Lancer. The remaining aircraft were returned to the United States in November after logging 55 missions, but {{at the cost of}} three F-111A's lost in combat. Eventually the aircraft redeemed itself when two squadrons (48 F-111As) from the 474th deployed to Takhli in September 1972, in order to participate in the aerial offensive against North Vietnam under Operation Linebacker II. During this deployment the F-111s operated day and night, in all weather conditions and without electronic countermeasures escort, and relied on less <b>aerial</b> <b>refueling</b> support than other tactical aircraft. Eventually over 4000 missions were logged by the two F-111-equipped units at the cost of six aircraft lost in combat and two lost to operational causes. However, by this point in time, the aircraft was no longer earmarked for conversion into the SCNA role.|$|E
5000|$|Marine <b>Aerial</b> <b>Refueler</b> Transport Squadron 452 (VMGR-452) is {{a reserve}} United States Marine Corps KC-130T {{squadron}} currently transitioning to the KC-130J.

Known as the [...] "Titans", VMGRT-253 was a subordinate unit of Marine Aircraft Group 14, 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing.|$|R
50|$|The {{squadron}} flies the EC-130H aircraft, {{a specially}} configured {{version of the}} Air Force’s proven C-130 transport. To execute its unique missions, the aircraft were modified with electronic countermeasures systems, specialized jamming equipment, the capability to <b>aerial</b> <b>refuel,</b> as well as upgraded engines and avionics. Modifications made to the aircraft vary between the two squadrons, to help each squadron meet its specific mission-oriented needs.|$|R
