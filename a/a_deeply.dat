A more sensitive test uses lanthanum nitrate with iodine and ammonia to give a blue solution.

5|$|Being a key {{animal in}} the history of farming, sheep have <b>a</b> <b>deeply</b> entrenched place in human culture, and find {{representation}} in much modern language and symbology. As livestock, sheep are most often associated with pastoral, Arcadian imagery. Sheep figure in many mythologies—such as the Golden Fleece—and major religions, especially the Abrahamic traditions. In both ancient and modern religious ritual, sheep are used as sacrificial animals.|$|E
5|$|Both {{species can}} be {{distinguished}} from most other swallows in their breeding or wintering ranges by the streaking on the underparts.

5|$|In a {{fundraising}} {{speech on}} 5 October 1843 at the Manchester Athenaeum, Dickens urged workers and employers to join together to combat ignorance with educational reform, and realised {{in the days}} following that {{the most effective way to}} reach the broadest segment of the population with his social concerns about poverty and injustice was to write <b>a</b> <b>deeply</b> felt Christmas narrative rather than polemical pamphlets and essays.|$|E

5|$|American {{paddlefish}} are smooth-skinned {{and almost}} entirely cartilaginous. Their eyes {{are small and}} directed laterally. They have a large, tapering operculum flap, a large mouth, and a flat, paddle-shaped rostrum that measures approximately one-third of their body length. During {{the initial stages of}} development from embryo to hatchling, American paddlefish have no rostrum. It begins to form shortly after hatching. The rostrum is an extension of the cranium, not of the upper and lower jaws or olfactory system as with the long snouts of other fishes. Other distinguishing characteristics include <b>a</b> <b>deeply</b> forked heterocercal caudal fin and dull coloration, often with mottling, ranging from bluish gray to black dorsally grading to a whitish underbelly.|$|E
5|$|During {{his tenure}} at the Garden, Rogerson was also <b>a</b> <b>deeply</b> {{involved}} member of the Mycological Society of America (MSA). He served as Managing editor (1958–89) and Editor-in-chief (1960–65) of the scientific journal Mycologia. He was Vice-President (1967), President Elect (1968), and President of the MSA (1969), and secretary-treasurer of the society from 1973 to 1974. He has served as historian of the Mycological Society of America from 1960 to 1990. Rogerson was a generous donor to MSA student travel awards. He died in Ogden on September 7, 2001.|$|E
5|$|Election Special is an American {{roots and}} blues rock album of protest songs with music {{characterized}} by upbeat melodies, simple instrumentation, and sparse arrangements. Cooder played {{all of the}} instruments, including bass, guitar, and mandolin, {{with the exception of}} drums by his son Joachim. <b>A</b> <b>deeply</b> political album, it expands on the socio-political musings and current event topics of Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down with forthright, satirical lyrics and song-form vignettes. Cooder's songwriting exhibits liberal and populist sentiments and draws on older musical sources such as broadside ballads and country blues.|$|E

50|$|It was {{discovered}} about 1880 when two farmers began to quarry crushed rock there.

5|$|However, Gandhi had sound {{reasons for}} his decision. The salt tax was <b>a</b> <b>deeply</b> {{symbolic}} choice, since salt was used by nearly everyone in India, to replace the salt lost by sweating in India's tropical climate. An item of daily use could resonate more with all classes of citizens than an abstract demand for greater political rights. The salt tax represented 8.2% of the British Raj tax revenue, and hurt the poorest Indians the most significantly.|$|E
5|$|Madonna {{recorded}} the album in New York City with Shep Pettibone and André Betts {{while she was}} working on her book and film projects. She began creating the album's demos with Pettibone in his apartment in October 1991. Madonna wrote the melodies and lyrics on top of the basic music which Pettibone produced in the style of his remixes. During the sessions, they had problems during sequencing, and, as a result, Pettibone kept trying to move development as fast as possible as he did not want Madonna to lose interest in the music. According to him, Madonna's compositions were serious and intense, directing the creative direction of the songs into <b>a</b> <b>deeply</b> personal territory.|$|E
5|$|Meyerbeer's immense wealth (increased by {{the success}} of his operas) and his {{continuing}} adherence to his Jewish religion set him apart somewhat from many of his musical contemporaries. They also gave rise to rumours that his success was due to his bribing musical critics. Richard Wagner (see below) accused him of being interested only in money, not music. Meyerbeer was, however, <b>a</b> <b>deeply</b> serious musician and a sensitive personality. He philosophically resigned himself to being a victim of his own success: his extensive diaries and correspondence – which survived the turmoil of 20th-century Europe and have now been published in eight volumes – are an invaluable source for the history of music and theatre in the composer's time.|$|E

5|$|One {{source of}} {{inspiration}} for Tristan und Isolde was the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer, notably his The World as Will and Representation, to which Wagner had been introduced in 1854 by his poet friend Georg Herwegh. Wagner later called this the most important event of his life. His personal circumstances certainly made him an easy convert to what he understood to be Schopenhauer's philosophy, <b>a</b> <b>deeply</b> pessimistic view of the human condition. He remained an adherent of Schopenhauer {{for the rest of}} his life.|$|E
5|$|Sir John Betjeman (1906–1984) was a twentieth-century English poet, {{writer and}} broadcaster. Born to a middle-class family in Edwardian Hampstead, he {{attended}} Oxford University, although left without graduating. He {{turned down a}} position in the family furniture business, and instead took a series of jobs before becoming the assistant editor of The Architectural Review in 1931, which reflected <b>a</b> <b>deeply</b> held affection for buildings and their history. That same year he published his first book, Mount Zion, a collection of poems.|$|E
5|$|The Third of May also depicts an execution, {{an early}} {{event in the}} {{so-called}} Peninsular War between France and Spain. Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Spain in 1808, capturing its royal family and replacing them with his brother, Joseph. The French were as unpopular in Spain as they later were in Mexico, and they encountered a fierce insurrection, which ultimately triumphed. The Third of May execution was an indiscriminate killing of civilians by French soldiers in reprisal for a guerrilla attack the previous day. Goya's painting of the massacre, which shows terrified civilians facing a firing squad, was intended to arouse anger and hatred {{on the part of}} Spanish viewers. Goya's is a highly romantic picture of <b>a</b> <b>deeply</b> emotional episode.|$|E

5|$|The {{purple-throated cotinga}} is {{strongly}} sexually dimorphic as {{male and female}} purple-throated cotingas have few similarities in their plumage. The male has black upperparts, including the head, wings, and tail. The feathers on the bird's back to its uppertail coverts, {{as well as its}} upperwing coverts, have white fringes. There is also a conspicuous white wingstripe and white edges to the tertial feathers. Additionally the male has <b>a</b> <b>deeply</b> purple throat and a white belly, with some black barring on its rear flanks.|$|E
5|$|According to Novas (1993), Herrerasaurus can be {{distinguished}} based on the following features: {{the presence of a}} premaxilla-maxilla fenestra, and the dorsal part of laterotemporal fenestra is less than a third as wide as the ventral part; the presence of a ridge on the lateral surface of the jugal bone, and <b>a</b> <b>deeply</b> incised supratemporal fossa that extends across the medial postorbital process; the subquadrate ventral squamosal process has a lateral depression, and the quadratojugal bone overlaps the posterodorsal quadrate face; the pterygoid process of the quadrate has an inturned, trough-shaped ventral margin, and the presence of a slender ribbed posterodorsal dentary process; the surangular bone has a forked anterior process for articulation with the posterodorsal dentary process; the humerus' internal tuberosity is proximally projected and separated from the humeral head by a deep groove (also present in coelophysoids); possesses enlarged hands, which are 60% {{of the size of the}} humerus+radius, and the humeral entepicondyle is ridge-like with anterior and posterior depressions; and the posterior border of the ilial peduncle forms a right angle with the dorsal border of the shaft on the ischium.|$|E
5|$|Bojić devoted {{most of his}} {{creative}} energy to the completion of an epic poem titled Cain, which was published just before the combined Austro-Hungarian, Bulgarian and German invasion of Serbia in October 1915. <b>A</b> <b>deeply</b> patriotic work, Cain compares Bulgaria's impending attack on Serbia to the Biblical story of Cain jealously murdering his brother Abel. Upon capturing Niš, the Bulgarians burned every copy of the poem, {{and the only one}} that survived was the one that Bojić carried with him out of the city. Upon leaving Niš, Bojić and his brother Radivoje joined the Serbian Army in its retreat to the Adriatic coast. Their sisters and infant brother went to live with a cousin in occupied Kraljevo. The Bojić brothers' journey took them through Kuršumlija, Mitrovica, Pristina, Prizren, Đakovica, Dečani and Peć, from where they continued to Andrijevica and Podgorica. The two intended to join retreating Montenegrin Army columns and head on to Scutari, where they hoped that Allied ships would evacuate them and other Serbian troops to Italy.|$|E
