In this work, we compared <b>antifading</b> formulae utilizing a recently developed reducing and oxidizing system (ROXS) with commercial <b>antifading</b> agents. To systematically test fluorophore performance in fluorescence imaging of biological samples, we carried out photobleaching experiments using fixed cells labeled with various commonly used organic dyes, such as Alexa 488, Alexa 594, Alexa 647, Cy 3 B, ATTO 550, and ATTO 647 N. Quantitative evaluation of (i) photostability, (ii) brightness, and (iii) storage stability of fluorophores in samples mounted in different antifades (AFs) reveal optimal combinations of dyes and AFs. Based on these results we provide guidance on which AF should preferably be used with a specific dye. Finally, we studied the <b>antifading</b> mechanisms of the commercial AFs using single-molecule spectroscopy and reveal that these empirically selected AFs exhibit similar properties to ROXS AFs. ...|$|E

However, a common mechanism of the action of <b>antifading</b> agents such as Trolox is still missing. In this communication we present evidence that Trolox acts in accordance with a mechanism that involves triplet quenching through electron transfer and subsequent recovery of the resulting radical ion by the complementary redox reaction. The required oxidant for this unifying mechanism based on a reducing and oxidizing system (ROXS) is formed via (photo-) reaction with molecular oxygen. We present evidence that this oxidized form is a quinone derivative of Trolox with strong oxidizing properties. These findings shed light on many contradicting results regarding the action of <b>antifading</b> agents and {{might lead to a}} common mechanistic understanding of photobleaching and its prevention.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{details the}} synthesis of a new alkyne core functional hyperbranched polyglycerol and describes their use as potential monomolecular imprinting materials and increasing the photostability of fluorescent dyes. The first chapter describes two methods for {{the synthesis of}} the polymers and its formal [3 + 2] cycloaddition with organic azides {{in the presence of}} copper, commonly referred to as click chemistry. The two methods allow preparation of low molecular weight polymers, MW 100, 000 g/mol. The polymers and their derivatives are characterized by a variety of analytical techniques to establish the size, degree of branching, and initiator incorporation for both the low and high molecular weight material. A method for decreasing polydispersity, a common issue for hyperbranched polymers, is also described. This chapter includes two applications for these new polymers including attachment to the surface of a gold nanoparticle, and the synthesis of an acid sensitive unimolecular micelle. In the first application, the alkyne core is converted to an amine which allows the polymer to act as a ligand on the gold surface. Despite the presence of the amine, the particle’s remain neutral (zeta potential = - 0. 01) and are stable to salt induced precipitation. In the second application unimolecular micelles were tested for biocompatibility, and their ability to encapsulate and release a hydrophobic guest molecule. 	The second chapter describes the synthesis of branched star polymers or pseudodendrimers using an adenosine core in an effort to synthesize a water soluble organic nanoparticle capable of recognizing nucleic acid residues. A general route to highly cross-linked water soluble nanoparticles is presented which uses metathesis cross-linking and osmium catalyzed dihydroxylation. The nanoparticles could be hydrolyzed to remove the adenosine template. However, qualitative tests using equilibrium dialysis showed very low, nonspecific binding to nucleoside guests. The end of the chapter further studies the cross-linking process, and shows how the polymers stiffness changes with increasing cross-link density using 1 H NMR T 1 relaxation times. 	The third chapter describes two methods for the use of polyglycerol to increase the photostability of organic dyes. The first method uses the steric bulk of polyglycerol as a protective layer to prevent interaction of the dye with molecular oxygen or to increase the water solubility of stable but insoluble dyes. Polyglycerol modified with fluorescein at the core was shown to be up to 3 times more stable than free fluorescein in solution. The polymer conjugates were also less affected by iodide quenching. In both tests {{there was no difference between}} cross-linked and uncross-linked polymer. Polyglycerol was also used to alter the water solubility of the insoluble but stable perylene diimide dye. The second method uses polyglycerol not as a steric barrier, but as a scaffold to covalently link fluorescent dyes to <b>antifading</b> agents. The results show that the co-localization of the dye and <b>antifading</b> agents due to the covalent attachment to the polymer scaffold reduces photobleaching similarly to that observed for <b>antifading</b> agents in solution...|$|E
40|$|In {{observations}} by confocal or conventional fluorescence microscopy, {{important factors}} {{should be considered}} in order to obtain accurate images. One of them, such as the fluorescence bleaching from highest intensity to lowest signal of fluorescence is a common problem with several DNA fluorochromes and especially for DAPI stain. The fluorescence of DAPI fades rapidly when it is exposed to UV light, under optimal conditions of observation. Although the fading process can be retarded using a mounting medium with <b>antifading</b> reagents, the photochemical process underlying the fluorescence decay has not yet been fully explained. In addition, no relationship between fluorescence fading and nuclear DNA content has been tested. In order to test this relationship, we measured by means of image analysis the DAPI-fluorescence intensity in several cellular types (spermatozoa, erythrocytes and haemocytes) during their fluorescence bleaching. An algorithm specifically built in MATLAB software was used for this approach. The correlation coefficient between nuclear DNA content and DAPI-fluorescence fading was found equal to 99 %.

The abundance of microorganisms in ice cores, as measured by direct cell count under a fluorescence microscope, is generally lower than that in other aquatic environments. It is possible that the abundance of microorganisms in ice cores is underestimated due to the degradation of fluorescent dye or because non-specific fluorescence from mineral particles inhibits the fluorescence signal from microorganisms. To investigate this possibility, we tested 4 types of <b>antifade</b> solution and 19 types of fluorescence dye, and selected the best combination in terms of prolonging the fluorescent signal from microorganisms and distinguishing biological signals from noise produced by non-specific particles.

For this reason very short antennas were used even if their size was enor-mous.

The characterization of the indoor multi-path propagation structure is important in developing <b>antifading</b> techniques for high-speed digital radio access. The high-resolution of the estimation of the Time of Arrival (ToA) and the Direction of Arrival (DoA) of multi-path signals in wireless communication involves locating a source of Radio Frequency (RF) waves and then directing the beam of antenna in the estimated direction.

40|$|Given the {{particular}} importance of dye photostability for single-molecule and fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy investigations, refined strategies were explored {{for how to}} chemically retard dye photobleaching. These strategies will be useful for fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), fluorescence-based confocal single-molecule detection (SMD) and related techniques. In particular, the effects on the addition of two main categories of <b>antifading</b> compounds, antioxidants (n-propyl gallate, nPG, ascorbic acid, AA) and triplet state quenchers (mercaptoethylamine, MEA, cyclo-octatetraene, COT), were investigated, and the relevant rate parameters involved were determined for the dye Rhodamine 6 G. Addition {{of each of the}} compound categories resulted in significant improvements in the fluorescence brightness of the monitored fluorescent molecules in FCS measurements. For antioxidants, we identify the balance between reduction of photoionized fluorophores {{on the one hand and}} that of intact fluorophores on the other as an important guideline for what concentrations to be added for optimal fluorescence generation in FCS and SMD experiments. For nPG/AA, this optimal concentration was found to be in the lower micromolar range, which is considerably less than what has previously been suggested. Also, for MEA, which is a compound known as a triplet state quencher, it is eventually its antioxidative properties and the balance between reduction of fluorophore cation radicals and that of intact fluorophores that defines the optimal added concentration.

40|$|Background: The {{analysis}} of the subcellular distribution of proteins {{is essential for the}} understanding of processes such as signal transduction, In most cases, the parallel {{analysis of}} multiple components requires fixation and immunofluorescence labeling. Therefore, one has to ascertain that the fixation procedure preserves the in vivo protein distribution. Fusion proteins with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) are ideal tools for this purpose. However, one must consider specific aspects of the fluorophore formation or degradation, i. e. reactions that may interfere with the detection of GFP fusion proteins. Methods: Fusion proteins of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) with GFP as well as free, soluble GFP stably or transiently expressed in adherent cultured cells served as test cases for comparing the distribution in vivo with that after fixation by conventional epifluorescence and laser scanning microscopy. Indirect immunofluorescence was employed to compare the distributions of the GFP signal and of the GFP polypeptide in the fusion protein. Results: Paraformaldehyde (PFA) fixation with subsequent mounting in the <b>antifading</b> agent Mowiol, but not in Tris- or HEPES buffered saline, led to a partial redistribution of the EGFR from the plasma membrane to the perinuclear region. The redistribution was confirmed with the GFP and EGFR immunofluorescence. The in vivo distribution in Mowiol mounted cells was preserved if cells were treated with a combined PFA/methanol fixation procedure, which also retained the fluorescence of soluble GFP. The anti-GFP antiserum was negative for the N-terminal fusion protein. Conclusions: The combined PFA/methanol protocol is universally applicable for the fixation of transmembrane and soluble cytoplasmic proteins and preserves the fluorescence of GFP...|$|E

40|$|Background Scanning {{fluorescence}} microscope (SFM) {{is a new}} technique for automated motorized microscopes to measure multiple fluorochrome labeled cells (Bocsi et al., Cytometry A 2004, 61 : 1 – 8). Aims We developed a four-color staining protocol (DNA, CD 3, CD 4, and CD 8) for the lymphocyte phenotyping by SFM. Methods Organic (Alexa 488, FITC, PE-Alexa 610, CyChrom, APC) and inorganic (quantum dot (QD) 605 or 655) fluorochromes were used and compared in different combinations. Measurements were performed in suspension by flow cytometer (FCM) and on slide by SFM. Results Both QDs were detectable by the appropriate Axioplan- 2 and FCM filters and the AxioCam BW-camera. CD 4 /CD 8 ratios were highly correlated (P = 0. 01) between the SFM and FCM. Conclusion Automated SFM is an applicable tool for CD 4 /CD 8 ratio determination in peripheral blood samples with QDs. © 2006 International Society for Analytical Cytology Flow cytometer (FCM) and Laser scanning cytometer (LSC, 1) are standard instruments for quantitative multicolor phenotyping of leukocytes; spectral imaging confocal microscopy is optimal for morphological cytometric analysis (2). The Scanning {{fluorescence microscope}} (SFM) is a slide-based, software-controlled new technique for automated motorized microscopes equipped with a scientific digital camera. It can also measure multiple fluorescent labeling and is appropriate for multichannel cytometric analysis (3, 4). Current development of digital cameras and computer systems promise broad spreading of SFM technique. In fluorescence microscopy, fluorescence emission is stimulated by high intensity UV or visible light. Light absorption induces an excited state of the dye (usually singlet-state), leading to fluorescence. However, the excited state of the dye may undergo chemical reactions such as photo-oxidation, leading to its destruction as evidenced by fading or bleaching of the fluorescence and subsequent decrease in signal intensity during measurement. High-content analysis of biological specimens requires multicolor labeling for polychromatic (1) or hyperchromatic cytometry (5). The hyperchromatic analysis needs spectrally combinable labels with stable long-lasting fluorescence. Conventional organic fluorochromes bleach more or less rapidly in buffer during illumination (6). This is overcome by using <b>antifading</b> solutions as mounting media (7, 8). Fluorescent semiconductor nanocrystals (quantum dots, QDs) offer new ways in multiparametric characterization of biological samples. In comparison with organic fluorophores, the QDs have unique optical properties such as, size (5 – 20 nm diameter, similar size as a typical protein), and composition tunable fluorescence emission from visible to infrared wavelength. In high absorption from UV across {{a wide range of}} the spectrum, narrow and symmetric emission spectra, intensive brightness, and photostability are the characteristics (9, 10). QDs are produced with appropriate mean emission for the well-proved fluorescence systems and filter combinations. This should enable combination of QDs in multicolor staining protocols with the other “classical” fluorochromes. QDs have recently been successfully covalently linked to reactive molecules such as peptides, antibodies, nucleic acids, or small-molecule ligands (9, 10). The development of high-sensitivity and high-specificity probes that lack the intrinsic limitations of organic dyes and fluorescent proteins is of considerable interest in many areas of biomedicine, ranging from molecular and cellular biology to molecular imaging and diagnostics. The T-helper/T-cytotoxic (CD 4 +/CD 8 +) lymphocytes were selected as a model system.

Cytochrome c release assay The protocol for detection of cytochrome c release from mitochondria in cells undergoing apoptosis is a modification of a method outlined previously (Waterhouse and Trapani, 2003). In brief, 2 – 5 × 10 6 cells were permeabilized with 120 μg/ml digitonin (Calbiochem) in buffer (75 mM KCl, 250 mM sucrose, 1 mM NaH 2 PO 4, and 8 mM Na 2 HPO 4) and fixed in formaldehyde at a final concentration of 4 % vol/vol. After overnight incubation with anti–cytochrome c antibody (1 / 200 dilution; BD Biosciences), cells were labeled with an FITC-conjugated goat anti–mouse IgG secondary antibody (1 / 100; Southern Biotechnology) and analyzed by FACS. Cytochrome c release {{was defined as a}} shift in peak fluorescence (anti–cytochrome c staining) to the left.

40|$|The female gametes {{are more}} {{susceptible}} to chromosome segregation errors during meiosis I division and therefore they are the major contributors to the embryo aneuploidies. The evaluation of aneuploidies in bovine oocytes is useful for monitoring the reproductive health of this species and FISH is the main method employed for this purpose. To date only 2 – 3 chromosomes were simultaneously investigated for aneuploidy detection in cattle oocytes. In this work we propose a multi-color ZOO-FISH by the simultaneous detection of six specific chromosome painting probes on secondary oocytes matured in vitro. Standard procedures were employed for 24 h in vitro oocytes maturation, whereas specific autosomal probes were prepared by microdissection and DOP-PCR using river buffalo mitosis (2 n= 50). Probes were labelled with spectrum-green and -orange in a second DOP-PCR. Three sequential rounds of FISH were achieved for the same slides. Each round was realized using two probes simultaneously hybridized on MII oocytes with the corresponding first polar bodies (I pb). Slides were counterstained with DAPI in <b>antifade.</b> Digital images were captured in gray-scale and pseudo-colored by the software. Six specific probes, painting 3 out of 5 sub-metacentric river buffalo chromosomes (BBU 1 p, 1 q, 3 p, 3 q, 4 p and 4 q) were sequentially hybridized on BTA secondary oocytes with the corresponding (I pb). The different colors of the probes allowed the identification of six cattle chromosomes (BTA 1, 5, 8, 19, 27 and 28) both on MII and polar bodies evidencing no abnormalities for the investigated cells, but confirming their potential use for aneuploidy detection in bovine oocytes. This result opens further opportunity of investigation for clinical cytogenetic applications also in the other species with difficult CGH karyotype...|$|R
