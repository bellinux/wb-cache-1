The TMI reversible fuel cell – electrolyzer system employs a high temperature solid-oxide based electrochemical process to produce electricity from common hydrocarbon fuels (e. g., natural gas, propane, and bio-derived fuel) as well as hydrogen. In electrolyzer mode, the reversible system uses electricity and thermal energy to convert pure water into fuel (hydrogen and oxygen). TMI’s reversible system uses the waste thermal energy produced during electricity generation mode to achieve high systems efficiency during electrolysis mode, ultimately lowering product life cycle costs for the combined system.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with some central information aspects of a general management system which is being developed for rural sector planning. Eleven alternative squences of periodical reviews of field experience {{with the implementation of}} rural development plans are appraised in the light of five considerations, (i) improving. the flow of information for the annual estimates procedure, (ii) improved information for the annual programming of rural development operations, (iii) the timing and function of official annual reports, (iv) the dessemination of information about rural development plan content and progress to a wider audience, (v) desirable upper and lower limits to the interval between successive reviews. The choice is narrowed to four alternative sequences with functional, as opposed to conventional, timings. Of these, a triannual review. sequence is finally recommended, consisting of a programming review in May, an evaluation review in August and an end-of-calendar-year review, in December, After the suggested content of each review has been outlined, a possible timetable is given for the trial introduction of the sequence into Special Rural Development Programme areas in Kenya, with a view to testing its replicability in a wider system of rural area—based plans.

This dissertation utilizes qualitative interview research methodology to connect with some of the leaders of American higher education to understand how institutions define priorities, allocate scarce resources and develop strategic plans that move their institutions forward. Five institutions were selected as part of the sample based on their inclusion among the top 30 private universities in the annual U. S. News and World Report rankings. A semi-structured telephonic interview approach was employed with 22 senior administrators from Duke University, Emory University, Georgetown University, Stanford University and Yale University, including all five presidents.

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Missouri River reservoir system is a critical national resource that provides a variety of benefits, including navigation, flood control, irrigation, hydropower, municipal and industrial water supply, recreation, and fish and wildlife habitat. The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) is responsible for operating the Missouri River system to serve these congressionally authorized purposes. Between 1933 and 1964, the Corps built six dams on the Missouri River to serve the water resource needs within the Missouri River basin. The resulting reservoirs form a series of lakes from Montana to the South Dakota-Nebraska border. The Corps manages the system of dams and reservoirs according to the water control plan presented in its Missouri River Mainstem Reservoir System Master Water Control Manual, which {{was first published in}} 1960 and most recently revised in 2006. The master manual provides water control criteria for the reservoir system for a spectrum of anticipated runoff conditions. <b>Annual</b> <b>operating</b> <b>plans</b> based on these criteria provide detailed reservoir regulation for each operating year. Four states, Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, and Missouri, are adjacent to the Missouri River and are served by barge and other vessel traffic along the river. Two states, Iowa and Missouri, are served by navigation on both the Missouri River and the Mississippi River. Both private companies and the Corps have conducted navigation activities on the Missouri River to and/or from these states. Companies transport numerous commodities, such as fertilizer, which is shipped from a port of origin to a port of destination, or sand and gravel, which some companies mine from the river and then transport to a processing facility on shore. In addition, the Corps conducts river maintenance and habitat recovery projects, which require the shipment of waterway improvement material, such as stone or rock. In this context, Congress asked GAO to determine (1) the annual and total tonnage of commodity shipments for each state served by the Missouri River, and (2) the comparable tonnage of commodity shipments transported on the Mississippi River for states served by both the Missouri and Mississippi rivers. ...|$|R

Among the conclusions it was obtained that the shortage of the water resource, the disorganization and other factors influenced in the budget implementation and in the achievement of the strategic objectives. Therefore, the achievement of the strategic objectives just surpassed the 50. 00 % and the implementation of the budget's activities which were related with the achievement of the strategic objectives not reached the 50. 00 %; meaning that the partial achievement of the strategic objectives was due to the moderate budget implementation.

40|$|In 1996, Dr. Ed Skolnik of Energetics, Incorporated, began {{a series}} of visits to the {{locations}} of various projects that were part of the DOE Hydrogen Program. The site visits/evaluations were initiated to help the DOE Program Management, which had limited time and limited travel budgets, to get a detailed snapshot of each project. The evaluations were soon found to have other uses as well: they provided reviewers on the annual Hydrogen Program Peer Review Team with an in-depth look at a project [...] something that is lacking in a short presentation [...] and also provided a means for hydrogen stakeholders to learn about the R&D that the Hydrogen Program is sponsoring. The visits were conducted under several different contract mechanisms, at project locations specified by DOE Headquarters Program Management, Golden Field Office Contract Managers, or Energetics, Inc., or through discussion by {{some or all of the}} above. The methodology for these site-visit-evaluations changed slightly over the years, but was fundamentally as follows: Contact the Principal Investigator (PI) and arrange a time for the visit; Conduct a literature review. This would include a review of the last two or three years of <b>Annual</b> <b>Operating</b> <b>Plan</b> submittals, monthly reports, the paper submitted with the last two or three Annual Peer Review, published reviewers' consensus comments from the past few years, publications in journals, and journal publications on the same or similar topics by other researchers; Send the PI a list of questions/topics about a week ahead of time, which we would discuss during the visit. The types of questions vary depending on the project, but include some detailed technical questions that delve into some fundamental scientific and engineering issues, and also include some economic and goal-oriented topics; Conduct the site-visit itself including [...] Presentations by the PI and/or his staff. This would be formal in some cases, informal in others, and merely a ''sit around the table'' discussion in others; The format was left to the discretion of the PI; A tour of the facility featuring, whenever possible, a demonstration of the process in operation; Detailed discussions of the questions sent to the PI and other topics; and Writing a report on the visit. This compilation presents the reports for all the site-visits held between February 1996 and July 2001, each written shortly after the visit. While nothing has been changed in the actual content of any of the reports, reformatting for uniformity did occur. In each report, where the questions and their respective answers are discussed, the questions are shown in bold. In several cases, the PI chose to answer these questions in writing. When this occurs, the PI's answers are produced ''verbatim, in quotes, using a different font. '' Discussion of the questions, tour/demonstration, and anything else raised during the visit is presented in normal type. Comments that represent the opinion of Dr. Skolnik, including those added during the writing of the report are shown in italics.

40|$|This {{was a year}} of {{significant}} accomplishment in the Hot Dry Rock (HDR) Program. Most importantly, the design, construction, and installation of the surface plant for the Phase II system neared completion {{by the end of}} the year. Basic process design work has been completed, and all major components of the system except the gas/particle separator have been procured. For this component, previous design problems have been resolved, and purchase during the first half of FY 91 is anticipated. Installation of the surface plant is well underway. The system will be completed and ready for operation by the end of FY 91 under the current funding scenario. The operational schedule to be followed will then depend upon the program funding level. Our goal is to start long-term flow testing as soon as possible. Of equal importance, from the standpoint of the long-term viability of HDR technology, during this year, for the first time, it has been demonstrated in field testing that it should be possible to operate HDR reservoirs with water losses of 1 - 3 %, or even less. Our experience in the deep, hot, Phase II reservoir at Fenton Hill is in sharp contrast to the significant water losses seen by Japanese and British scientists working in shallower, cooler, HDR reservoirs. Calculations and modeling based on field data have shown that water consumption declines with the log of time in a manner related to water storage in the reservoir. This work may be crucial in proving that HDR can be an economically viable means for producing energy, and that it is useful even in areas where water is in short supply. In addition, an engineering model was developed to predict and explain water consumption in HDR reservoirs under pressure, the collection and processing of seismic information was more highly automated, and the detection limits for reactive tracers were lowered to less than 1 part per billion. All of these developments will add greatly to our ability to conduct, analyze, and understand the long-term test (LTFT). Water-rights acquisition activities, site clean-up, and improvements in the 1 million gallon storage pond at Fenton Hill have assured that we will have adequate water to carry out a vigorous testing program in a safe and environmentally-sound manner. The 1 million gallon pond was recontoured, and lined with a sophisticated multi-layer plastic barrier. A large part of the work on the pond was paid for with funds from the Laboratory's Health, Safety and Environment Division. Almost all the expected achievements set forth in the FY 90 <b>Annual</b> <b>Operating</b> <b>Plan</b> were substantially accomplished this past year, in spite of a $ 300, 000 shortfall in funding. This funding shortfall did delay some work and result in some projects not being completed, however. They have had to go more slowly than they would like on some aspects of the installation of the surface plant for the LTFT, purchase of non-critical equipment, such as a back-up electric generator for Fenton Hill, has been delayed, and some work has not been brought to an adequate conclusion. The fracture healing work, for example, was completed but not written up. they simply did not have the funds to pay for the effort needed to fully document this work. As the program enters FY 91, the completion of the surface plant at Fenton Hill is within sight. The long-awaited LTFT can then begin, and the large investment in science and technology represents by the HDR Program will begin to bear still greater dividends...|$|E
