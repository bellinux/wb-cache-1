50|$|SiConnect's {{first product}} was the PLT050, which was {{launched}} in 2007. This was the digital baseband integrated circuit for its 21Mbit/s POEM powerline comms technology. It presented Ethernet and USB data-plane traffic interfaces, {{as well as a}} host-processor interface port for control-plane management. The PLT050 was built on UMC's 0.18 micron digital process. The PLT050 required an external <b>analog</b> <b>front-end</b> (AFE) circuit, including an integrated component for high-speed and scalable A/D and D/A conversion. Initial powerline modems built around the PLT050 used Analog Devices's AD9865 integrated AFE part, in common with the powerline modem designs from other silicon manufacturers. SiConnect had designed its own integrated AFE, codenamed the SCA10, which delivered superior performance at lower cost than the AD9865. The company intended to combine the SCA10 with the PLT050 in a single package to sell a single-package solution {{to be known as the}} PLi050, but this had not come to market before SiConnect ceased trading.|$|E

40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the {{construction}} of power estimators for the high-level synthesis of <b>analog</b> <b>front-ends</b> and more precisely on power estimators for analog filters. A power estimator is a function that returns an estimated value for the power consumed by a functional block when given some relevant specifications as input and without knowing the detailed implementation of the block.

The tentative conclusion of these experiments is that no one-fits-all closed function exists that estimates the power consumption of filters on a very high-level within a satisfactory accuracy, due to the large diversity of filter implementations.

40|$|The {{state-of-the-art}} <b>analog</b> <b>front-end</b> of implantable biosensors is {{the class}} of current-mirror-based circuits. Despite their superior noise performance, power consumption and area, they suffer from systematic and random errors causing offset, gain and linearity error in reading out the sensor data. In {{the first part of}} this thesis, a new <b>analog</b> <b>front-end</b> is proposed to eliminate the systematic error. The proposed topology is able to accurately copy the sensor current which will be converted into the proportional voltage for further processing. Additionally, a theoretical discussion regarding the functionality of the proposed topology is given and a thorough study on the effect of random error sources is carried out. In the second part of this thesis, in order to optimize the design of the proposed <b>analog</b> <b>front-end,</b> an optimization algorithm is proposed. The proposed optimization algorithm takes advantage of a modified Imperialist Competitive Algorithm. The original imperialist competitive algorithm shows a low search ability in high-dimensional search spaces which is the case in optimization of analog circuits. A thorough comparison between the original imperialist competitive algorithm, the proposed algorithm and genetic algorithm as a reference is carried out. It will be revealed that the proposed algorithm is capable of exploring the cost space more efficiently than the other two algorithms, thereby resulting in better trade-offs between design objectives to reach higher cost values. Furthermore, according to the mathematical benchmarks, the proposed algorithm is more than 1. 5 times faster than the other algorithms in finding the global minimum, which is essential in simulation-based optimization procedures.
