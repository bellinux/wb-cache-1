50|$|As with cystic echinococcosis, {{ultrasonography}} is {{the imaging}} technique {{of choice for}} <b>alveolar</b> <b>echinococcosis</b> and is usually complemented by CT scans since CT scans are able to detect {{the largest number of}} lesions and calcifications that are characteristic of <b>alveolar</b> <b>echinococcosis.</b> MRIs are also used in combination with ultrasonography though CT scans are preferred. Like cystic echinococcosis, imaging is the major method used for the diagnosis of <b>alveolar</b> <b>echinococcosis</b> while the same types of serologic tests (except now specific for E. multilocularis antigens) are used to verify the imaging results. It is also important to note that serologic tests are more valuable for the diagnosis of <b>alveolar</b> <b>echinococcosis</b> than for cystic echinococcosis since they tend to be more reliable for <b>alveolar</b> <b>echinococcosis</b> since more antigens specific for E. multilocularis are available.

After ultrasound (US) abdominal examination, a questionnaire to identify risk factors for infection (socioeconomic, sanitation and hygiene variables) and collected filter-paper blood samples from each child for specific antibody detections using EmP and EgB antigens. The overall prevalence of echinococcosis by US was 0. 1 % for CE; no detectable AE was found. The results showed the dog/fox faeces environmental contamination and age-bias behaviour were significant risk factors for both human AE and CE. There was a statistically significant association between both infections and child domicile indicating that infection risk also included geographic independent factors, with the eco-geographic environment being a risk factor for AE and the sociogeographic environment increasing risk for CE. In conclusion, the environmental health indicator, which incorporated the most significant biological, environmental and social factors associated with the risk of echinococcosis infection, can provide clear “warning signals” to decisionmakers for the institution of specific control measures in this Chinese population...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the true community prevalence of human cystic (CE) and <b>alveolar</b> (AE) <b>echinococcosis</b> (hydatid disease) {{in a highly}} endemic region in Ningxia Hui, China, by detecting asymptomatic cases. METHODS: Using hospital records and "AE-risk" landscape patterns we selected study communities predicted {{to be at risk}} of human echinococcosis in Guyuan, Longde and Xiji counties. We conducted community surveys of 4773 individuals from 26 villages in 2002 and 2003 using questionnaire analysis, ultrasound examination and serology. FINDINGS: Ultrasound and serology showed a range of prevalences for AE (0 - 8. 1 %; mean 2 %) and CE (0 - 7. 4 %; mean 1. 6 %), with the highest prevalence in Xiji (2 % for CE, 2. 5 % for AE). There were significant differences in the prevalence of CE, AE and total echinococcosis between the three counties and villages (with multiple degrees of freedom). While hospital records showed 96 % of echinococcosis cases attributable to CE, our survey showed a higher prevalence of human AE (56 %) compared to CE (44 %). Questionnaire analysis revealed that key risk factors for infection were age and dog ownership for both CE and AE, and Hui ethnicity and being female for AE. Drinking well-water decreased the risk for both AE and CE. CONCLUSION: Echinococcosis continues to be a severe public health problem in this part of China because of unhygienic practices/habits and poor knowledge among the communities regarding this disease...|$|R
5000|$|The {{rates of}} {{echinococcosis}} {{is higher in}} rural areas, {{and there are more}} than one million people infected currently. [...] Untreated <b>alveolar</b> <b>echinococcosis</b> is fatal. [...] It is caused by ingesting parasites in animal feces. There are two versions of the disease: cystic and alveolar. Both versions involve an asymptomatic incubation period of several years. In the cystic version, liver cysts cause abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting while cysts in the lungs cause chronic cough, chest pain, and shortness of breath. In <b>alveolar</b> <b>echinococcosis,</b> a primary cyst develops, usually in the liver, in addition to weight loss, abdominal pain, general feeling of ill health, and signs of liver failure.|$|E
50|$|For <b>alveolar</b> <b>echinococcosis,</b> {{surgical}} {{removal of}} cysts combined with chemotherapy (using albendazole and/or mebendazole) {{for up to}} two years after surgery is the only sure way to completely cure the disease. However, in inoperable cases, chemotherapy by itself can also be used. In treatment using just chemotherapy, one could use either mebendazole in three doses or albendazole in two doses. Since chemotherapy on its own is not guaranteed to completely rid the patient of disease, patients are often kept on the drugs for extended periods of times (i.e. more than 6 months, years). In addition to surgery and chemotherapy, liver transplants are being looked into as a form of treatment for <b>alveolar</b> <b>echinococcosis</b> although it is seen as incredibly risky since it often leads to echinococcosis re-infection in the patient afterwards.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} form found in humans is cystic {{echinococcosis}} (also known as unilocular echinococcosis), which is caused by Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato.

40|$|Echinococcosis is a {{zoonosis}} whose history {{dates back}} to antiquity. This article provides an overview on the general history of echinococcosis, including the elucidation of. Echinococcus life cycles and the long controversy on the aetiology of the cystic and <b>alveolar</b> forms of <b>echinococcosis</b> (CE and AE), lasting about 100. years {{since the middle of}} the 19 th century. Furthermore, selected historical aspects of some fields of echinococcosis research are discussed and compared with our current knowledge, such as geographic distribution and epidemiology of CE (Echinococcus granulosus) and AE (Echinococcus multilocularis), clinical aspects and pathology, diagnosis in humans and animals, treatment (with focus on chemotherapy), control and basic research. A short paragraph is devoted to the neotropical forms of echinococcosis, caused by. Echinococcus vogeli and. Echinococcus oligarthrus. In this context the achievements of some ancestral pioneers of echinococcosis research are particularly highlighted and appreciated. Finally, the role of associations, international organizations (World Health Organization and others) and international working groups in echinococcosis research and control is briefly outlined. The retrospective reveals both the admirable achievements of our ancestors and the scientific progress of more recent times. But, it also shows the gaps in our knowledge, skills and resources that we need to control or even eradicate echinococcosis...|$|R
50|$|While {{a number}} of control and {{prevention}} strategies deal with cystic and <b>alveolar</b> <b>echinococcosis,</b> there are few methods to control and prevent polycystic echinococcosis. This is {{probably due to the}} fact that polycystic echinococcosis is restricted to Central and South America, and that the way that humans become accidental hosts of E. oligarthrus and E. vogeli is still not completely understood.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{strategies}} are geared towards prevention {{and control of}} alveolar echinococcosis—most of which {{are similar to those}} for cystic echinococcosis. For instance, health education programs, improved water sanitation, improved hygiene and de-worming of hosts (particularly red foxes) are all effective to prevent and control the spread of <b>alveolar</b> <b>echinococcosis.</b> Unlike cystic echinococcosis, however, where there is a vaccine against E. granulosus, there is currently no canidae or livestock vaccine against E. multilocularis.|$|E
5000|$|In humans, {{this causes}} a disease called {{echinococcosis}}. The three types of echinococcosis are cystic echinococcosis caused by E. granulosus, <b>alveolar</b> <b>echinococcosis</b> caused by E. multilocularis, and polycystic echinococcosis caused by E. vogeli or E. oligarthrus. A worm's incubation period is usually long and can be up to 50 years. Cystic echinococcosis is mostly found in South and Central America, Africa, the Middle East, China, Italy, Spain, Greece, Russia, and the western United States (Arizona, New Mexico, and California).|$|E
40|$|West-central China is an {{important}} endemic focus of both <b>alveolar</b> and cystic <b>echinococcosis</b> where several species of intermediate host are commonly infected with Echinococcus granulosus and E. multilocularis. Isolates of E. granulosus were collected from humans and other animals from different geographical areas of Qinghai, Ningxia, Gansu and Sichuan, and genotyped using the mitochondrial DNA marker ATP synthase subunit 6 gene (atp 6). The sheep strain (G 1 genotype) of E. granulosus was shown {{to be the only}} genotype present in sheep, cattle, goats, yaks and humans in the study areas. However, some heterogeneity in the atp 6 sequence was evident in a number of the isolates with the most frequent change being a silent substitution (G/A) at position 360 compared with the G 1 reference sequence representing isolates collected from the majority of hosts except humans. Two E. multilocularis isolates examined also had sequences that varied from each other and from the reference E. multilocularis atp 6 sequence. The genotypic variation we report may reflect phenotypic differences with important consequences in terms of increased host infectivity for hosts by local Echinococcus strains, possibly impacting on the epidemiology and control of echinococcosis. Such adaptations may also result in different sensitivity to drugs or increased virulence for hosts that will impede control efforts and even affect vaccination strategies against Echinococcus...|$|R
5000|$|Surgery {{and drugs}} can both {{be used to}} treat echinococcosis.

50|$|Since polycystic {{echinococcosis}} is constrained to such {{a particular}} {{area of the world}} and is not well described or found in many people, treatment of polycystic echinococcosis is less defined than that of cystic and <b>alveolar</b> <b>echinococcosis.</b> While surgical removal of cysts was the treatment of choice for the previous two types of echinococcosis, chemotherapy is the recommended treatment approach for polycystic echinococcosis.

50|$|Echinococcosis is a {{parasitic}} disease of tapeworms of the Echinococcus type. The two main types {{of the disease}} are cystic echinococcosis and <b>alveolar</b> <b>echinococcosis.</b> Less common forms include polycystic echinococcosis and unicystic echinococcosis. The disease often starts without symptoms and this may last for years. The symptoms and signs that occur depend on the cyst's location and size. Alveolar disease usually begins in the liver but can spread {{to other parts of}} the body, such as the lungs or brain. When the liver is affected the person may have abdominal pain, weight loss, and turn slightly yellow from jaundice. Lung disease may cause pain in the chest, shortness of breath and coughing.|$|E
50|$|The {{incidence}} of human infestation with E. multilocularis and disease is increasing in urban areas, as wild foxes (an important reservoir {{species of the}} sylvatic cycle) are migrating to urban and suburban areas and gaining closer contact with human populations. Also, restocking fox enclosures for fox hunting with infected animals spreads the disease. Children, health care workers and domestic animals {{are at risk of}} ingesting the cysts after coming into contact with the feces of infected wild foxes. Even with the improvement of health in developed/industrialized countries, the prevalence of <b>alveolar</b> <b>echinococcosis</b> (AE) did not decrease. On the contrary, incidents of AE have now also been registered in eastern European countries and sporadic incidences in other European countries.|$|E
50|$|<b>Alveolar</b> <b>echinococcosis</b> (AE) is {{a highly}} lethal helminthic disease in humans, caused by the larval form of the {{parasitic}} tapeworm E. multilocularis. The disease represents a serious public threat in China, Siberia, and central Europe. However, since the 1990s, the prevalence of the disease seems to be increasing in Europe, {{not only in the}} historically endemic areas but its neighboring regions.AE primarily affects the liver by inducing a hepatic disorder similar to liver cancer, therefore becoming extremely dangerous and difficult to diagnose. If the infection metastasizes, it may spread to any other organ and could be lethal if not treated. The most common treatment for AE is to surgically remove the parasite. Since it is difficult and not always possible to remove the entire parasite, medicine such as Albendazole is utilized to keep the cyst from growing back.|$|E
50|$|Similar to the {{diagnosis}} of <b>alveolar</b> <b>echinococcosis</b> and cystic echinococcosis, {{the diagnosis}} of polycystic echinococcosis uses imaging techniques, in particular ultrasonography and CT scans, to detect polycystic structures within the patient’s body. However, imaging is not the preferred method of diagnosis since the method that is currently considered the standard is the isolation of protoscoleces during surgery or after the patient’s death and the identification of definitive features of E. oligarthrus and E. vogeli in these isolated protoscoleces. This is the main way that PE is diagnosed, but some current studies show that PCR may identify E. oligarthrus and E. vogeli in patients’ tissues. The only drawback of using PCR to diagnose polycystic echinococcosis is that there aren’t many genetic sequences {{that can be used}} for PCR that are specific only E. oligarthrus or E. vogeli.|$|E
50|$|E. multilocularis mainly {{occurs in}} the Northern hemisphere, {{including}} central Europe and the northern parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. However, its distribution was not always like this. For instance, {{until the end of}} the 1980s, E. multilocularis endemic areas in Europe were known to exist only in France, Switzerland, Germany, and Austria. But during the 1990s and early 2000s, there was a shift in the distribution of E. multilocularis as the infection rate of foxes escalated in certain parts of France and Germany. As a result, several new endemic areas were found in Switzerland, Germany, and Austria and surrounding countries such as the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, and Italy. While <b>alveolar</b> <b>echinococcosis</b> is not extremely common, it is believed that in the coming years, it will be an emerging or re-emerging disease in certain countries as a result of E. multilocularis’ ability to spread.|$|E
40|$|Until now, Belgium {{has been}} {{considered}} as a low-risk country for <b>alveolar</b> <b>echinococcosis.</b> However it was recently demonstrated by necropsy series that, {{in some parts of}} southern Belgium (Wallonia), up to 51 % of the red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) may be infected by E. multilocaris. The authors, working in a university hospital in southern Belgium, described in 2002 the first autoctuthonous Belgian case of hepatic <b>alveolar</b> <b>echinococcosis.</b> More importantly, in 2004, they diagnosed three other patients with <b>alveolar</b> <b>echinococcosis.</b> One underwent surgical resection, but two others had bilateral pulmonary involvement at time of definite diagnosis.

Considering the high prevalence of E. multilocaris infection of red foxes and the recent increase of the fox population due to rabies vaccination in southern Belgium, and also the presence of E. multilocaris infection of red foxes in northern Belgium, it is likely that not only Wallonia, but also maybe the whole Belgium, may face endemic <b>alveolar</b> <b>echinococcosis</b> in the next years.

However, the basis of cellular immunoregulation in patient with <b>alveolar</b> <b>echinococcosis</b> is poorly understood. The present report shows a comparative analysis of lymphoid cell function in {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMC) of 16 patients with <b>alveolar</b> <b>echinococcosis</b> and of healthy individuals. Our in vitro restimulation studies with crude Echinococcus multilocularis antigen demonstrated that PBMC from patients with <b>alveolar</b> <b>echinococcosis</b> were responsive to challenge with parasitic antigen as measured by lymphoid cell proliferation. In this system, we also evaluated cytokine expression at the gene and protein levels after stimulation with E. multilocularis antigen. Analysis of cytokine mRNA expression revealed distinct patterns of cytokine expression in patients and normal donors. By using reverse transcriptase PCR, we could demonstrate that the TH 1 cytokine transcripts interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) are present in PBMC from patients with <b>alveolar</b> <b>echinococcosis.</b> Moreover, it was found that stimulation with E. multilocularis antigen induced or enhanced the expression of the TH 2 cytokine IL- 3, IL- 4, IL- 10, and especially IL- 5 mRNAs in PBMC from 13 of 16 patients with <b>alveolar</b> <b>echinococcosis.</b> Two patients who were examined after radical surgery, as well as another patient with a stable course of the disease under continuous chemotherapy, were not able to generate the same pattern of cytokine response and had no evidence of IL- 5 mRNA synthesis. In contrast to the frequent expression of TH 2 cytokine mRNAs observed in patients with <b>alveolar</b> <b>echinococcosis,</b> PBMC cultures from normal donors showed prominent IL- 2 and IFN-gamma mRNA expression but weak IL- 3, IL- 4, and IL- 10 mRNA expression. Most interestingly, IL- 5 mRNA was substantially absent in PBMC from healthy individuals. In accordance with the mRNA studies, it was found that E. multilocularis antigen induced the secretion of large amounts of IL- 5 and intermediate amounts of IFN-gamma in patients with <b>alveolar</b> <b>echinococcosis,</b> whereas large amounts of IFN-gamma and no or threshold amounts of IL- 5 were detected in supernatants from healthy individuals. Collectively, the present study provides the first evidence that a TH 2 immune response is gradually activated during the course of E. multilocularis infection, indicating a critical role for IL- 5 in the manifestation of human <b>alveolar</b> <b>echinococcosis...</b>|$|E
