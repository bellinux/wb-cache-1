40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the problem}} faced by CEECs wishing {{to join the}} Euro who must hit both <b>an</b> <b>inflation</b> and exchange rate criterion {{during a period of}} nominal convergence. This process requires either <b>an</b> <b>inflation</b> differential, <b>an</b> appreciating nominal exchange rate, or a combination of the two, which makes it difficult to simultaneously satisfy the exchange rate and inflation criteria. The authorities can use their monetary policy to hit one criterion, but must essentially just "hope" to satisfy the other one. The paper quantifies the likely size and speed of these convergence effects, their impact on inflation and exchange rates, and their consequences for the simultaneous compliance with both criteria under <b>an</b> <b>inflation</b> targeting setup and under a fixed exchange rate regime. The key result is that under <b>an</b> <b>inflation</b> targeting regime, the nominal appreciation implied by convergence is not big enough to threaten a breach of the exchange rate criterion, but for countries with fixed exchange rates, inflation is likely to exceed the reference value. This result is robust to plausible changes in the assumed convergence scenario. Central and Eastern Europe; Nominal Convergence; Euro Adoption...|$|R

40|$|In {{times of}} low-inflation, {{conventional}} monetary policy is perpetually {{exposed to the}} risk of being caught by the liquidity trap. As a part of a pre-emptive monetary policy to avoid the liquidity trap, many economists have pointed out that this risk can be possibly circumvented by targeting a small but positive inflation rate - i. e., so-called the Ã¢â‚¬ËœbufferÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ role of <b>an</b> <b>inflation</b> target. In this paper, based on the stylized framework of a central bank's linear-quadratic dynamic optimization problem taking into account the zero lower-bound constraint on the nominal interest rate, we analyze the role of <b>an</b> <b>inflation</b> target in reducing the long run stabilization cost stemming from the liquidity trap. We prove the existence of theÃ¢â‚¬ËœbufferÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ role of small but positive inflation {{in the presence of a}} liquidity trap. Moreover, we analytically show that a central bank's loss function evaluated at the steady state is decreasing and convex function of <b>an</b> <b>inflation</b> target. Finally, these analytical properties of <b>an</b> <b>inflation</b> target are verified by a numerical method. Sensitivity analyses suggest that, in the presence of a liquidity trap, a central bank faced with volatile macroeconomic shocks should consider the Ã¢â‚¬ËœbufferÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ role of andeflation, inflation target, liquidity trap, zero-bound...|$|R
