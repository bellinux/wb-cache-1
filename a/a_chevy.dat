25|$|Continuing their {{participation}} of AVTC's, CSULA {{is involved with}} General Motors' new competition series called EcoCAR3. This competition is a 4-year competition where 16 Universities across northern America were donated a 2016 Chevy Camaro and are focused on converting this traditional fossil fuel vehicle into a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle. CSULA's team has focused on developing a post transmission parallel architecture for their vehicle. Additionally, the team has decided to deviate from the standard expectation of marketing their developed vehicle to consumers and is instead targeting Law Enforcement Fleets as a business to business focus. The EcoCar3 team will have four years (2014–18) to redesign and re-engineer <b>a</b> <b>Chevy</b> Camaro {{in an effort to}} reduce the energy consumption and greenhouse emissions of the vehicle, while maintaining consumer acceptability, performance, utility and safety. At the end of the four year, the student-build vehicles will participate in an over-the-road event, raising the stakes for vehicle, dependability and safety. For further updates or more information regarding team development check out the team's social media @CSULA_EcoCAR3.|$|E

2500|$|The 1953–1954 Chevrolet range had {{a unique}} and {{somewhat}} awkward look about it and much of this stemmed from {{its role as a}} transitional model to introduce a raft of changes that were necessary {{to pave the way for}} the introduction of the 1955–1957 range that really established the Bel Air as a cultural icon. The pre-war technology, such as torque tube drive, six-cylinder splash feed engines, knee action suspension, split windshields, etc., of the early models was phased out and the foundations for the first post war modern Chevrolet passenger car were finalized in this 1953–1954 model. The Bel Air series featured a wide chrome strip of molding from the rear fender bulge to the rear bumper. The inside of this stripe was painted a coordinating color with the outside body color, and [...] "Bel Air" [...] scripts were added inside the strip.

Without factory support, Jenkins developed his first Grumpy's Toy, a 327 cubic inch / 350 horsepower Chevy II. When he found the compact car was to be placed in the same class as the 426 ci/425 horsepower hemi Dodge and Plymouth muscle cars, he commented it [...] "looked like a pretty good gimmick at the time". The lower displacement engine in the smaller car, hence lighter minimum weight, enabled it to outrun the larger-engined but heavier cars. He set a class record with an 11.66 second pass. He was added to Chevrolet's team in 1967. He became known as the premiere normally aspirated drag race engine builder after his Super Stock victory at the 1967 Nationals. He entered Pro Stock when NHRA started it in 1970, and won the first two events of the year (the Winternationals and Gatornationals) in a 1968 Chevrolet Camaro, ultimately taking the national title. His first car built specifically for Pro Stock, a 1970½ Camaro, would be the first of the class to make the cover of Hot Rod (their July 1970 issue).|$|E
6000|$|At last, {{after the}} sun had gone down, and it was ill picking our way among logs and ground-creepers, we were aware of lights; and soon found {{ourselves}} again in civilisation, and that of no mean kind. A large and comfortable house, only just rebuilt after a fire, stood among the palm-trees, between {{the sea and the}} lagoon; and behind it the barns, sheds, and engine-houses of the coco-works; and inside it a hearty welcome from a most agreeable German gentleman and his German engineer. A lady's hand--I am sorry to say the lady was not at home--was evident enough in the arrangements of the central room. [...] Pretty things, a piano, and good books, especially Longfellow and Tennyson, told of cultivation and taste in that remotest wilderness. [...] The material hospitality was what it always is in the West Indies; and we sat up long into the night around the open door, while the surf roared, and the palm trees sighed, and the fireflies twinkled, talking of dear old Germany, and German unity, and the possibility of many things which have since proved themselves unexpectedly most possible. I went to bed, and to somewhat intermittent sleep. [...] First, my comrades, going to bed romping, like English schoolboys, and not in the least like the effeminate and luxurious Creoles who figure in the English imagination, broke a four-post bedstead down among them with hideous roar and ruin; and had to be picked up and called to order by their elders. Next, the wind, which ranged freely through the open roof, blew my bedclothes off. Then the dogs exploded outside, probably at some henroost-robbing opossum, and had <b>a</b> <b>chevy</b> through the cocos till they tree'd their game, and bayed it to their hearts' content. Then something else exploded--and I do not deny it set me more aghast than I had been for many a day-- exploded, I say, under the window, with a shriek of Hut-hut-tut-tut, hut-tut, such as I hope never to hear again. After which, dead silence; save of the surf to the east and the toads to the west. I fell asleep, wondering what animal could own so detestable a voice; and in half an hour was awoke again by another explosion; after which, happily, the thing, I suppose, went its wicked way, for I heard it no more.|$|E
