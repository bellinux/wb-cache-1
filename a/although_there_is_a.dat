5|$|The shock {{delivered}} by the marbled electric ray can be painful but is seldom life-threatening, <b>although</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> danger of a shocked diver becoming disoriented underwater.

5|$|There {{has been}} an {{emergence}} of studies investigating yoga as a complementary intervention for cancer patients. Yoga is used for treatment of cancer patients to decrease depression, insomnia, pain, and fatigue and to increase anxiety control, <b>although</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> generally low quality of research and uncertainty for proving this effect. In preliminary research, yoga improved cognitive functioning. A 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis {{found no evidence that}} yoga was effective for metabolic syndrome.|$|E

5|$|A further {{distinction}} {{is the number}} of chambers in the national legislature; unicameral systems with one chamber or bicameral ones with a lower house and an upper house. Federations and countries with strong regional differences or regional identities are normally bicameral, to reflect the regions' interests in national bills. The states with the larger populations, from the Netherlands upwards, all have a bicameral system. <b>Although</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> greater mix among the smaller states (some influenced by their federalist structure), the smallest states are on the whole unicameral.|$|E

5|$|Both {{ships were}} caught in the harbour during the Battle of Weihaiwei in early 1895, with Zhenyuan only {{partially}} seaworthy. They were unable to prevent the capture of the port's fortifications by the Japanese, and underwent nightly attacks by torpedo boats. Dingyuen was hit by a torpedo and began to sink. She was quickly beached, where she settled into the mud, and continued {{to be used as a}} defensive fort. Admiral Ruchang's flag was subsequently moved across to Zhenyuan. Following Ruchang's suicide, the surrender of the port and the fleet was arranged. Dingyuen was blown up by the Japanese forces, as they were unable to salvage her, <b>although</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> suggestion following an eye witness account that she may have been mined by the Chinese.|$|E
5|$|Edmund {{was born}} either in 1015, 1016 or 1017. Edmund's mother was {{probably}} Ealdgyth, Edmund Ironside's wife; {{it is possible}} that she was only his stepmother, as the king's death in November 1016 left space of only one year for two children to be born. <b>Although</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> possibility that Edmund was older than his brother, later known as Edward the Exile, {{it is also possible that}} they were twins. At the time, it was customary for posthumous sons to bear their father's name; thus, Edmund could have been the younger, posthumous son.|$|E

The plan is intended to address key issues such as species and habitat conservation, management of human activities, research, education, and implementation. The North American legislation is similar, <b>although</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> greater emphasis on protection.|$|E
5|$|The first {{winner of}} the award was Rangers striker Derek Johnstone, and the first non-Scottish winner was Aberdeen goalkeeper Theo Snelders eleven years later.

5|$|In 1987, the {{detection}} of an orbiting planetary object was announced by Bruce Campbell, Gordon Walker and Stephenson Yang. From 1980 to 2000, a team of astronomers led by Artie P. Hatzes made radial velocity observations of Epsilon Eridani, measuring the Doppler shift of the star {{along the line of}} sight. They found evidence of a planet orbiting the star with a period of about seven years. <b>Although</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> high level of noise in the radial velocity data due to magnetic activity in its photosphere, any periodicity caused by this magnetic activity is expected to show a strong correlation with variations in emission lines of ionized calcium (the Ca II H and K lines). Because no such correlation was found, a planetary companion was deemed the most likely cause. This discovery was supported by astrometric measurements of Epsilon Eridani made between 2001 and 2003 with the Hubble Space Telescope, which showed evidence for gravitational perturbation of Epsilon Eridani by a planet.|$|E

5|$|In October 2013, in {{a conference}} to promote the 25th season of the show, {{producer}} Al Jean revealed that a major character would die in this episode. The character would have appeared more than twice in the show, and be voiced by an Emmy Award-winning voice actor who won an Emmy for the role as the character. Later that month, {{following the death of}} Marcia Wallace, it was confirmed {{that it would not be}} her character, Edna Krabappel. Voice actor Hank Azaria, whose roles include Apu Nahasapeemapetilon and Moe Szyslak, stated that it would not be one of his characters. It was shown at the 2014 Comic-Con that it would not be Homer, <b>although</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> scene that features Lisa worrying about Homer's health as he struggles with a CPAP mask.|$|E
5|$|Most of the monarchies in Europe are {{constitutional}} monarchies, {{which means}} that the monarch does not influence the politics of the state: either the monarch is legally prohibited from doing so, or the monarch does not utilize the political powers vested in the office by convention. The exceptions are Liechtenstein and Monaco, which are usually considered semi-constitutional monarchies due to the large influence the princes still have on politics, and the Vatican City, which is a theocratic absolute elective monarchy. There is currently no major campaign to abolish the monarchy (see monarchism and republicanism) in any of the twelve states, <b>although</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> significant minority of republicans in many of them (e.g. the political organisation Republic in the United Kingdom). Currently seven of the twelve monarchies are members of the European Union: Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the crucial}} points {{is that there are}} several {{different}} sources for the Battle itself, including poems and songs in Old English, Old Norse, Old Welsh, Middle English, Latin, and Anglo-Norman, highlighting a wide potential of sources in order to glean information about the battle from all sides of the campaign. Furthermore, while these sources might be seen as biased due to national origin and underlying romantic and heroic narrative constructions of the battle for each side, some of the sources, such as the Chronicle work as points of reference to the more lyrical constructions presented in other popular narrative formats. <b>Although</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> relative lack of iron-clad primary sources that are completely unbiased, by taking into account all of these sources, historians and literary scholars can gain a fuller image of the military maneuvers and actions taken by the respective leaders of armies involved in this battle.|$|E
