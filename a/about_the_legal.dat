5|$|Approximately 4,500 {{same-sex}} couples married in Spain {{during the first}} year of the law. Shortly after the law was passed, questions arose <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>legal</b> status of marriage to non-Spaniards whose country did not permit same-sex marriage. A ruling from the Justice Ministry stated that the country's same-sex marriage law allows a Spanish citizen to marry a non-Spaniard regardless of whether that person's homeland recognizes the partnership. At least one partner must be a Spanish citizen in order to marry, although two non-Spaniards may marry if they both have legal residence in Spain.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} law was passed, {{questions}} arose <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>legal</b> status of marriage to non-Spaniards after a Spaniard and an Indian national living in Catalonia were denied a marriage license {{on the grounds that}} India did not permit same-sex marriage. However, on 22 July, another judge in Catalonia married a Spanish woman and her Argentinian national partner (the first same-sex marriage between women in Spain). This judge disagreed with his colleague's decision and gave preference to the right of marriage over Argentinian law at the time not allowing same-sex marriage.|$|E
5|$|Islanders {{struggled}} with food shortage {{in the last}} months of the occupation. Hathaway organised a raid on German grain stocks and saved many families from starvation with her secret potato hoard. Sark was liberated on 10 May 1945. Three British officers arrived and, explaining that no British troops were available, asked the Dame to take command of 275 men belonging to the defeated German garrison. She made sure the garrison cleared up the island of land mines. She was, however, so concerned <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>legal</b> status of the decisions she had issued during the war that she sailed to Guernsey to validate them as soon as the island was liberated. Her experience of the German occupation inspired William Douglas-Home's play The Dame of Sark. Hathaway's manner of receiving Germans has been described as both impressive and overly cordial.|$|E

5|$|Possession {{and use of}} {{psilocybin}} mushrooms, {{including the}} bluing species of Psilocybe, is therefore prohibited by extension. However, in many national, state, and provincial drug laws, {{there has been a}} great deal of ambiguity <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>legal</b> status of psilocybin mushrooms, as well as a strong element of selective enforcement in some places. Most US state courts have considered the mushroom a 'container' of the illicit drugs, and therefore illegal. A loophole further complicates the legal situation—the spores of psilocybin mushrooms do not contain the drugs, and are legal to possess in many areas. Jurisdictions that have specifically enacted or amended laws to criminalize the possession of psilocybin mushroom spores include Germany (since 1998), and California, Georgia, and Idaho in the United States. As a consequence, there is an active underground economy involved in the sale of spores and cultivation materials, and an internet-based social network to support the illicit activity.|$|E

There is no explicit legal requirement for armed officers to warn a suspect before firing, although guidelines published by the Association of Chief Police Officers say that this 'should be considered'. A potential suicide bomber is thought to represent a circumstance where warning the suspect may put the public at greater risk because the bomber may detonate his explosives after being warned.|$|E

25|$|In Jewish law, {{marriage}} {{consists of}} two separate acts, called erusin (or kiddushin, meaning sanctification), which is the betrothal ceremony, and nissu'in or chupah, the actual Jewish wedding ceremony.

In Talmudic times, these two ceremonies usually took place {{up to a year}} apart; the bride lived with her parents until the actual marriage ceremony (nissuin), which would take place in a room or tent that the groom had set up for her. Since the Middle Ages, the two ceremonies have taken place as a combined ceremony performed in public.|$|E

Fox got acquired by VUG, which in turn got acquired by Activision, while Monolith got bought by Warner Brothers, so some stars would have to align for everything to get sorted out."

500|$|In 1579 {{the house}} was {{inherited}} by Sir Edward Fitton III {{on the death of}} his father, Sir Edward Fitton II. [...] Sir Edward III was the father of Mary Fitton, a maid of honour to Queen Elizabeth and a candidate for the [...] "Dark Lady" [...] of Shakespeare's sonnets. [...] Following the death of SirEdward Fitton, 2ndBaronet in 1643, the estate passed to SirCharles Gerard, later the first Earl of Macclesfield. [...] There was a dispute <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>legal</b> ownership of the estate between SirCharles and his cousin [...] Alexander Fitton, which seemed to be settled by 1663. [...] Demolition of parts of the house took place in about 1700, and it is thought by deFigueiredo and Treuherz that the west range was removed, possibly including the gatehouse. [...] At the beginning of the 18thcentury the dispute between the Fittons and the Gerards resurfaced, culminating in a duel in Hyde Park, London, in 1712 between the rival claimants: Lord Mohun, from the Gerard family, and the 4thDuke of Hamilton, from the Fittons. [...] Both of the combatants were killed. [...] The estate remained with the Gerards, until it was bought by William Stanhope, who later became the first Earl of Harrington, and it remained with this family until 1935. [...] The house was owned by the Cheshire antiquary Raymond Richards until his death in 1978. [...] Richards collected items from historic buildings that were being demolished in the 1960s, either incorporating them into the house or displaying them in the grounds. [...] The house is still owned and run by the Richards family.|$|E
