5|$|As {{described}} in attachment theory, infants {{need to develop}} <b>a</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> primary caregiver to achieve normal social and emotional development. A {{key part of the}} ability to develop this relationship may be joint attention. In addition to language development, joint attention serves the function of preparing infants for more complex social structures involved in adult conversation. Children's skills in initiating and responding to joint attention predict their social competence at 30 months of age. Anticipatory smiling (a low level form of joint attention involving smiling at an object then turning the smile to one's communicative partner) at 9 months positively predicts parent-rated social competence scores at 30 months in infants. Early joint attention abilities account for differences in social and emotional abilities in later life.|$|E
