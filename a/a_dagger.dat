5|$|The comic book's glossy, cover {{depicts a}} red-eyed ghoul {{clutching}} <b>a</b> <b>dagger</b> and a rope-bound, voluptuous {{young woman in}} a derelict moonlit ruin. The book's contents comprised six full-length horror feature stories and a two-page humorous tale.|$|E

50|$|The {{site also}} {{contains}} a high status stone-cist burial with <b>a</b> Liaoning-style bronze <b>dagger,</b> <b>a</b> number of large tubular-shaped greenstone ornaments, and <b>a</b> finely-made groundstone <b>dagger.</b> <b>A</b> number of jar-burials have been unearthed from the site.|$|R
50|$|A mattucashlass is <b>a</b> type of <b>dagger</b> worn {{concealed}} in the armpit and primarily used for close combat, part of traditional Scottish male Highland dress. It is {{also referred to}} as <b>an</b> armpit <b>dagger</b> or <b>a</b> sleeve <b>dagger</b> in English. In Scots, the alternative name skene-ochil or skene-occles can also be found.|$|R

5|$|While Mehmedbašić was {{travelling}} to Bosnia-Herzegovina from France, police {{searched his}} train for a thief. Thinking the police might be after him, {{he threw his}} weapons (<b>a</b> <b>dagger</b> {{and a bottle of}} poison) out the train window. Once he arrived in Bosnia-Herzegovina he had to set about looking for replacement weapons.|$|E
5|$|A long, straight-bladed dagger (pugio) was the gladiator's final weapon. A {{tombstone}} {{found in}} Romania shows a retiarius holding <b>a</b> <b>dagger</b> with four spikes (known as a quadrenseach spike {{at the corner}} of a square guard) instead of the usual bladed dagger. This was previously thought to be an artistic invention or perhaps a ceremonial weapon but a recently excavated femur bone from a gladiator graveyard in Ephesus has wounds consistent with the use of such a weapon.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the 16 living orders, there are 9 extinct orders and one superfamily known only from fossils. The relationship of these to living groups and to each other is controversial. The extinct Arthropleuridea was long considered a distinct myriapod class, although work in the early 21st century established {{the group as a}} subclass of millipedes. Several living orders also appear in the fossil record. Below are two proposed arrangements of fossil millipede groups. Extinct groups are indicated with <b>a</b> <b>dagger</b> (†). The extinct order Zosterogrammida, a chilognath of uncertain position, is not shown.|$|E

5|$|The king, {{after getting}} {{suspicious}} of her actions, once {{followed her to}} a sadhu’s place, with <b>a</b> <b>dagger</b> in his cloak. Once he reached the ashram, he {{found that there was}} no one inside. To his surprise, both the sadhu and his daughter Champavati had vanished. When he was about to return, he heard a voice saying that his daughter had been taken away as a punishment of his suspicion. The voice also asked him to build a temple, on the name of his daughter Champavati, if he wanted to avoid further familial calamities.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} {{news about}} the stolen ammunition, Colonel Stone prepares his regiment for battle. From their cell, the captives see the outmatched Bengal Lancers deployed to assault Khan's fortress. They manage to escape and ultimately destroy the ammunition tower, and young Stone redeems himself by killing Khan with <b>a</b> <b>dagger.</b> With their ammunition gone and headquarters in ruins {{as a result of}} the battle, the remaining rebels surrender. However, McGregor, who was mainly responsible for the destruction of the ammunition tower, is killed in the assault. To recognize their battlefield bravery and military effort, Forsythe and Lieutenant Stone are awarded the Distinguished Service Order and McGregor posthumously receives the prestigious Victoria Cross, with McGregor's horse awarded the medal on his behalf.|$|E
5|$|Beads {{made from}} {{meteoric}} iron in 3500BC or earlier {{were found in}} Gerzah, Egypt by G. A. Wainwright. The beads contain 7.5% nickel, which is a signature of meteoric origin since iron found in the Earth's crust generally has only minuscule nickel impurities. Meteoric iron was highly regarded due to its origin in the heavens and was often used to forge weapons and tools. For example, <b>a</b> <b>dagger</b> made of meteoric iron {{was found in the}} tomb of Tutankhamun, containing similar proportions of iron, cobalt, and nickel to a meteorite discovered in the area, deposited by an ancient meteor shower. Items that were likely made of iron by Egyptians date from 3000 to 2500BC. Meteoritic iron is comparably soft and ductile and easily forged by cold working but may get brittle when heated because of the nickel content.|$|E

5|$|Castle Wolfenstein, {{originally}} {{available on}} the Apple II in 1981, also employed stealth elements as a focus of the gameplay. Players were charged with traversing the levels of Castle Wolfenstein, stealing secret plans and escaping. Players could acquire uniforms to disguise themselves and walk by guards undetected. Beyond Castle Wolfenstein, released in 1984, included some additions to its predecessor, such as <b>a</b> <b>dagger</b> for close-range kills and {{a greater emphasis on}} disguising in enemy uniform. id Software's technically updated 1992 remake Wolfenstein 3D was originally going to feature some of the original's stealth gameplay, such as body hiding, but this was cut to make the game faster paced. This Wolfenstein game would ironically pave the way for quite a few later 3D action games, specifically first-person shooters.|$|E
5|$|Juste {{primarily}} attacks {{at close}} quarters using the series' traditional whip weapon, the Vampire Killer. It can be brandished to deflect projectile attacks, reminiscent of Simon Belmont's {{usage of the}} weapon in Super Castlevania IV. A variety of ranged sub-weapons—holy water, <b>a</b> <b>dagger,</b> a holy book, a cross, a gem, an axe, and a thunder gauntlet—are available, one {{of which can be}} carried at any given time and combined with one of the five spell books—Fire Book, Ice Book, Bolt Book, Wind Book, and the Summoning Tome—hidden throughout the castle to create a magical attack. Casting a spell renders the player character invincible for a moment.|$|E
5|$|More {{problematic}} {{are those}} {{cases where the}} movement of the Sun at different times and seasons causes light and shadow interactions with petroglyphs. A widely known example is the Sun Dagger of Fajada Butte at which a glint of sunlight passes over a spiral petroglyph. The location of <b>a</b> <b>dagger</b> of light on the petroglyph varies throughout the year. At the summer solstice <b>a</b> <b>dagger</b> can be seen through the heart of the spiral; at the winter solstice two daggers appear to either side of it. It is proposed that this petroglyph was created to mark these events. Recent studies have identified many similar sites in the US Southwest and Northwestern Mexico. It has been argued that the number of solstitial markers at these sites provides statistical evidence that they were intended to mark the solstices. The Sun Dagger site on Fajada Butte in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico, stands out for its explicit light markings that record all the key events of both the solar and lunar cycles: summer solstice, winter solstice, equinox, and the major and minor lunar standstills of the moon’s 18.6 year cycle. In addition at two other sites on Fajada Butte, there are five light markings on petroglyphs recording the summer and winter solstices, equinox and solar noon. Numerous buildings and interbuilding alignments of the great houses of Chaco Canyon and outlying areas are oriented to the same solar and lunar directions that are marked at the Sun Dagger site.|$|E

5|$|The West Point Museum is {{directly}} {{adjacent to the}} visitor's center, in the renovated Olmsted Hall {{on the grounds of}} the former Ladycliff College. Originally opened to the public in 1854, the West Point Museum is the oldest military museum in the country. During the summer months, the museum operates access to the Fort Putnam historic site on main post and access to the 282 acre Constitution Island. Some of the most notable items on display at the museum are George Washington's pistols, Napoleon's sword, <b>a</b> <b>dagger</b> carried by Hermann Goering when he was captured, a revolver that belonged to Goering, and a silver-plated party book, signed by Charles Lindbergh, Herbert Hoover and Mussolini, among others. Arguably, the most prized artifact on display is a gold-plated pistol that belonged to Adolf Hitler.|$|E
5|$|The issue {{came back}} to life in February of the {{following}} year when, two days before Flores' birthday, Padilla reported being kidnapped and stabbed by two gunmen. Padilla received 57 shallow slashes from <b>a</b> <b>dagger</b> which did not put his life in danger, but he could have died from blood loss. Padilla blamed Flores for the stabbing and for an earlier attack {{in which he was}} allegedly beaten by men who warned him against criticizing the church leader. A church spokesman denied that the church or Flores had any involvement in the attack and suggested that Padilla may have orchestrated the attack {{in a desperate attempt to}} authenticate his previous charges against the church.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} {{had trouble}} with the censors over several segments in this episode. The opening segment of the episode, which features a Fox censor named Fox Censor (pictured on the left) being stabbed to death, was pitched by David Mirkin and {{had a difficult time}} getting through the real-life censors. They had issues with the size of the knife and the sound effects used. Originally, the TV-rating was supposed to stab Censor with <b>a</b> <b>dagger,</b> but Fox objected because it was too gruesome and was changed to a cutlass. The censors also objected to an unaired scene where Homer does his naked church dance on an altar. The scene was reanimated so that Homer was dancing naked in the front row.|$|E

5|$|After {{spending}} {{years as}} a political hostage in Thebes, PhilipII sought to imitate the Greek example of martial exercises and the issuing of standard equipment for citizen soldiery, and succeeded in transforming the Macedonian army from a levied force of unprofessional farmers into a well-trained, professional army. PhilipII adopted some of the military tactics of his enemies, such as the embolon (flying wedge) cavalry formation of the Scythians. His infantry wielded peltai shields that replaced the earlier hoplon-style shield, were equipped with protective helmets, greaves, and either cuirass breastplates or kotthybos stomach bands, and armed with sarissa pikes and <b>a</b> <b>dagger</b> as a secondary weapon. The elite hypaspistai infantry, composed of handpicked men {{from the ranks of}} the pezhetairoi, were formed during the reign of PhilipII and saw continued use during the reign of Alexander the Great. PhilipII was also responsible for the establishment of the royal bodyguards (somatophylakes).|$|E
5|$|Before he {{can leave}} the capital, Littlefinger offers to take Ned to the last person Jon Arryn spoke to before his death. It {{turns out to be}} a prostitute, Mhaegan, the mother of a baby daughter, who is another of Robert's illegitimate children. Littlefinger reveals Jon Arryn had been searching for Robert's bastards for an unknown reason. When Ned and his guards try to leave, they are ambushed by Jaime Lannister and his men, who want answers for Tyrion's arrest. Ned claims {{responsibility}} for Tyrion's arrest, which leads to a brutal fight between his and Jaime's men. In the end, Ned's guards are killed, including his captain Jory Cassel, whom Jaime stabs through the eye with <b>a</b> <b>dagger.</b> Ned duels with Jaime but is speared through the leg by one of Jaime's guards before Stark and Lannister can finish the fight on their own. Jaime knocks out the guard who interrupted the fight and decides to let Ned live but warns that he wants his brother back. Jaime storms away, leaving Ned bleeding in the dirt, where he quickly faints.|$|E
5|$|Berkman {{was ready}} {{to carry out the}} {{assassination}} on July21. He wore a new suit and a black derby hat, and in his pockets he had a gun and <b>a</b> <b>dagger</b> fashioned from a steel file. He went to Frick's office and asked to see him, saying he was the representative of a New York hiring agency, but he was told Frick was too busy to meet him. The following night, Berkman checked into a hotel under the name Rakhmetov, his role model from What Is to Be Done? On July23, he returned to Frick's office. While the attendant told Frick that the New York employment agent had returned to see him, Berkman burst into the office and took aim at Frick's head. After two shots, Berkman was tackled to the ground. Still, he managed to pull out the dagger and stab Frick three times.|$|E
