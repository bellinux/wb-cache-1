5|$|The Coens {{referenced}} the noir tradition <b>again</b> <b>with</b> <b>The</b> Man Who Wasn't There (2001); {{a black-and-white}} crime melodrama set in 1949, {{it features a}} scene apparently staged to mirror the one from Out of the Past pictured above. Lynch's Mulholland Drive (2001) continued in his characteristic vein, making the classic noir setting of Los Angeles the venue for a noir-inflected psychological jigsaw puzzle. British-born director Christopher Nolan's black-and-white debut, Following (1998), was an overt homage to classic noir.

The dispute from the time of Baldwin of Forde flared up <b>again,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> papacy supporting the monks and the king supporting the archbishop. Finally, Pope Innocent III ruled for the monks and ordered Walter to destroy what had been built.|$|E
