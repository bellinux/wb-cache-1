5|$|<b>Aesthetics</b> as {{a factor}} of well-being. From the early austere {{principle}} that form should strictly follow function, {{there is a growing}} sensibility that <b>aesthetics</b> affect the physical and emotional health of those who use a building or structure. Norwegian laws concerning occupational health have for several decades emphasized access to daylight and fresh air, and it may also be that harsh climatic conditions create an added imperative for uplifting <b>aesthetics.</b>|$|E

5|$|Buffon {{attached}} much {{importance to}} the illustrations; Jacques de Sève illustrated the quadrupeds and François-Nicolas Martinet illustrated the birds. Nearly 2000 plates adorn the work, representing animals with care given both to <b>aesthetics</b> and anatomical accuracy, with dreamlike and mythological settings.|$|E
5|$|Confucianism entered Japan from China {{around the}} 5th century A.D., as did Buddhism. Confucian ideals are still evident {{today in the}} Japanese concept of society and the self, and in the {{organization}} of the government and the structure of society. Buddhism has profoundly impacted Japanese psychology, metaphysics, and <b>aesthetics.</b>|$|E
5|$|Fort Manoel {{is located}} {{to the north}} west of Valletta, and {{commands}} Marsamxett Harbour and the anchorage of Sliema Creek. The fort {{is an example of}} Baroque architecture, and it was designed with both functionality and <b>aesthetics</b> in mind.|$|E
5|$|Genjurō's pottery {{is also a}} {{major theme}} in the film. Professor Wood argues his pottery evolves in three phases, {{reflecting}} Mizoguchi's changing approach to filmmaking. Genjurō begins making the pottery for commercial reasons, shifts to pure <b>aesthetics</b> while isolated with Lady Wakasa, and finally moves on to a style that reflects life and strives to understand it.|$|E
5|$|Ideasthesia {{theory of}} art {{may be used}} for {{psychological}} studies of <b>aesthetics.</b> It may also help explain classificatory disputes about art as its main tenet is that experience of art can only be individual, depending on person's unique knowledge, experiences and history. There could exist no general classification of art satisfactorily applicable to each and all individuals.|$|E
5|$|In game development, he is {{a co-founder}} of Action Button Entertainment, where he {{designed}} games including Ziggurat and Videoball. The four-person studio specializes in simple <b>aesthetics</b> and controls, following from Rogers's own video game aesthetic and minimalist eSports interests. He compared the studio's design philosophy to the spartan menu selections of Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares.|$|E
5|$|The 300-seat auditorium, housed at {{the fourth}} level of the <b>aesthetics</b> block, was {{converted}} from an Air Rifle Shooting Range under the two-year school upgrading project in 2012 funded by the School Management and Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan. The auditorium provides a venue for performances apart from the main hall, as well as conducting sharing talks and academic lectures.|$|E
5|$|The game {{received}} generally favorable reviews. Critics praised its <b>aesthetics,</b> puzzle design, and {{fidelity to}} the series, but criticized its short length and disputed its degree of difficulty. It was selected for a 2016 Apple Design Award, Apple's 2015 iPhone game of the year, and best mobile/handheld game at the 2015 The Game Awards.|$|E
5|$|The game {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} upon release. Critics praised the game's colourful visuals, boss battles and special effects, but most cited its poor control schemes, <b>aesthetics</b> and general gameplay as major flaws. Despite the mixed reception, Iizuka commented {{that he would}} be interested in making a third Nights game, should Sega commission one.|$|E
5|$|WWE 2K17 {{retains the}} control scheme from the {{previous}} title but implements two styles of submissions. Ladders can now be propped many of ways, OMG's such as Kevin Owens' Apron Pop Up Powerbomb makes its debut and a new mini-game involving the Money in the Bank Briefcase {{to name a few}} features changes the <b>aesthetics</b> to ladder matches.|$|E
5|$|An {{increasingly}} common strategy to preserve bone and reduce treatment times includes {{the placement of}} a dental implant into a recent extraction site. On the one hand, it shortens treatment time and can improve <b>aesthetics</b> because the soft tissue envelope is preserved. On the other hand, implants may have a slightly higher rate of initial failure. Conclusions on this topic are difficult to draw, however, because few studies have compared immediate and delayed implants in a scientifically rigorous manner.|$|E
5|$|Announced on 8 November 2011, Alien Spidy was {{published}} on 20 March 2013 for the Xbox 360, Microsoft Windows, and Macintosh, and on 8 May 2013 for the PlayStation 3. It received mixed to negative reviews upon release; critics praised the game's <b>aesthetics</b> but found the gameplay frustrating due to imprecise controls and an unforgiving level of difficultly that hampered progression through the game.|$|E
5|$|Apart from {{development}} of cultural intelligence, life skills are also {{incorporated into the}} curriculum {{to prepare students for}} the future, by assisting students in the acquisition of various life skills that will be useful as they become part of the 21st century workforce.

5|$|Calls {{were made}} in New York for {{legislation}} to prevent the growth of skyscrapers, citing their effect on the city skylines, but these attempts faced legal obstacles. The United States Constitution did not give local government authority to prevent the buildings {{on the grounds of}} <b>aesthetics</b> alone, and any such law in New York was considered likely to face judicial challenge.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the game}} has been positive. The average score in Metacritic is of 82 out of 100. The Japanese video game magazine Famitsu gave it a score of 36/40, earning the magazine's Platinum award and becoming the highest-ranking review score that week. The reviewers were generally positive about their experience: despite some comments about a lack of polish in environments, the game's character design, <b>aesthetics,</b> gameplay and story all came in for general praise, with multiple reviewers calling it a worthy part of the Megami Tensei series.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Wily's Revenge is {{an action}} and {{platform}} game in same vein as the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) Mega Man games. The player is tasked with completing {{a series of}} four stages in any order desired.

Dr. Wily's Revenge specifically takes components of the original Mega Man and Mega Man 2, including their enemies, stage <b>aesthetics,</b> and Robot Masters.|$|E
5|$|Following its announcement, Hitman Go was {{met with}} some scepticism from critics. However, upon release the game {{received}} a positive reception with praise directed towards the game's art, <b>aesthetics,</b> simple gameplay mechanics, and translation of Hitman to a mobile device. The game also received several nominations and awards from gaming publications and award organisations. A successor set within the Tomb Raider franchise, titled Lara Croft Go, was released in August 2015.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, {{during the}} 15th {{anniversary of the}} game's release, Square Enix (who had {{acquired}} Eidos earlier) endorsed a free fan-created mod, Deus Ex: Revision which was released through Steam. The mod, created by Caustic Creative, is a graphical overhaul of the original game, adding in support for newer versions of DirectX, improving the textures and the soundtrack from the original game, and adding in more world-building <b>aesthetics.</b>|$|E
5|$|Kanō entered Tokyo Imperial University during June 1877. He {{majored in}} {{political}} science and economics, which at that time were taught by the Department of <b>Aesthetics</b> and Morals. He graduated in July 1882, and the following month he began work as a professor, fourth class, at the Gakushuin, or Peers School, in Tokyo. In 1883, Kanō was appointed {{professor of economics at}} Komaba Agricultural College (now the Faculty of Agriculture at University of Tokyo), but during April 1885, he returned to Gakushuin, with the position of principal.|$|E
5|$|Named {{for energy}} firm BP, which donated $5million toward its construction, {{it is the}} first Gehry-designed bridge to have been completed. BP Bridge is {{described}} as snakelike because of its curving form. Designed to bear a heavy load without structural problems caused by its own weight, it has won awards for its use of sheet metal. The bridge is known for its <b>aesthetics,</b> and Gehry's style is seen in its biomorphic allusions and extensive sculptural use of stainless steel plates to express abstraction.|$|E
5|$|Nan Chiau High School’s current campus covers 7.6 {{acres of}} land off Sengkang East Avenue, {{constructed}} under the School Management Model granted by the Ministry of Education in 2000. The campus was officially declared open by then Minister for Education and Second Minister for Defence Mr. Teo Chee Hean on 8 March 2003. The five-storey building cluster consists of an Administrative Block, a Science & Research Block, an <b>Aesthetics</b> block, and three classroom blocks.|$|E
5|$|Pokémon Gold and Silver {{are set in}} {{the region}} of Johto, {{situated}} {{to the west of the}} Kanto region from the previous Red and Blue games, and three years after the conclusion of the previous games. The design of Johto was inspired by Japan's Kansai and Tōkai regions, with many of the region's temples and more traditional Japanese <b>aesthetics</b> finding their way into Johto.|$|E
5|$|Puzzlejuice is a 2012 indie puzzle {{video game}} for iOS {{produced}} and developed by video game company Sirvo. The {{game is a}} combination of Tetris, tile-matching, and Boggle: players rearrange falling tetromino blocks into rows of similar colors, which turn into letters that are cleared from the board by forming words. The fast-paced game also includes challenges and power-ups. The development team consisted three people; programmer Asher Vollmer initially developed the game alone, before reaching out to artist Greg Wohlwend for advice on the <b>aesthetics.</b> Composer Jimmy Hinson produced the game's music.|$|E
5|$|Snakeskin, {{with its}} highly {{periodic}} cross-hatch or grid patterns, appeals to people's <b>aesthetics</b> {{and have been}} used to manufacture many leather articles including fashionable accessories. The use of snakeskin has however endangered snake populations and resulted in international restrictions in trade of certain snake species and populations in the form of CITES provisions. Animal lovers in many countries now propagate the use of artificial snakeskin instead, which are easily produced from embossed leather, patterned fabric, plastics and other materials.|$|E
5|$|The Faculty of Integrated Arts was {{established}} on April 21, 1995, by the fusion the former faculty of Architecture and the Departments of Design, Music, Scenic Arts, Social Communication, and Visual Arts and <b>Aesthetics.</b> It offers the undergraduate degree of Bachelor of Arts with emphasis in Graphic and Industrial Design, Dramatic Art, Architecture, Social communication and Journalism, Music, Visual Arts, {{and the degree}} of Bachelor of Education with emphasis in Music. It also offers the graduate diplomas of Landscaping and Administration of Construction Enterprises.|$|E
5|$|The Shrines of Ise {{have been}} celebrated as the {{prototype}} of Japanese architecture. Largely of wood, traditional housing and many temple buildings see the use of tatami mats and sliding doors that break down the distinction between rooms and indoor and outdoor space. Japanese sculpture, largely of wood, and Japanese painting are among {{the oldest of the}} Japanese arts, with early figurative paintings dating back to at least 300 BC. The history of Japanese painting exhibits synthesis and competition between native Japanese <b>aesthetics</b> and adaptation of imported ideas.|$|E
5|$|The album {{featured}} a cyberpunk-styled narrative {{as well as}} synthesized vocals and industrial influences. Despite the critical and financial failure of the album, Billy Idol set several precedents {{in the process of}} promoting the album. These included his use of the internet, e-mail, virtual communities, and multimedia software – each a first for a mainstream celebrity. Idol also based his fashion style, music videos, and stage shows on cyberpunk themes and <b>aesthetics.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{cemetery}} grounds are, {{except in}} drier climates, grass {{covered with a}} floral border around the headstones. There is also an absence of any paving between the headstone rows which is intended to make the cemetery feel like a traditional walled garden where visitors could experience a sense of peace. However, Carter and Jackson argue that the uniform <b>aesthetics</b> are designed to evoke a positive experience which deliberately masks and sanitises {{the nature of the}} war deaths.|$|E
