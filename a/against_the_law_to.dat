5|$|Alignment {{with the}} Indonesian government, however, did not {{guarantee}} safety for the Torajans. In 1965, a presidential decree required every Indonesian citizen {{to belong to}} one of five officially recognised religions: Islam, Christianity (Protestantism and Catholicism), Hinduism, or Buddhism. The Torajan religious belief (aluk) was not legally recognised, and the Torajans raised their voices <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>law.</b> <b>To</b> make aluk accord with the law, {{it had to be}} accepted as part of one of the official religions. In 1969, Aluk To Dolo ("the way of ancestors") was legalised as a sect of Agama Hindu Dharma, the official name of Hinduism in Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|The {{children}} of both {{government and private}} slaves were born slaves. Government slaves could be granted freedom by the emperor if they were deemed too elderly, if the emperor pitied them, or if they committed a meritous act worthy of a manumission. In one exceptional case, the former slave Jin Midi (d. 86 BCE) {{became one of the}} regents over the government. Private slaves could buy their freedom from their master, while some masters chose to free their slaves. Although slaves were subject to beatings if they did not obey their masters, it was <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>to</b> murder a slave; kings were stripped of their kingdoms after it was found that they had murdered slaves, while Wang Mang even forced one of his sons to commit suicide for murdering a slave. An edict of 35 CE repealed the death penalty for any slave who killed a commoner.|$|E
5|$|The {{most notable}} of these {{occurred}} in Jayuya in {{what became known}} as El Grito de Jayuya (Jayuya Uprising). Nationalist leader Blanca Canales led the armed nationalists into the town and attacked the police station. A small battle with the police occurred; one officer was killed and three others were wounded before the rest dropped their weapons and surrendered. The nationalists cut the telephone lines and burned the post office. Canales led the group into the town square where the illegal light blue version of the Puerto Rican Flag was raised (it was <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>to</b> carry a Puerto Rican Flag from 1898 to 1952.) In the town square, Canales gave a speech and declared Puerto Rico a free Republic. The town was held by the nationalists for three days.|$|E

25|$|The {{location}} must be well-suited to {{the purpose}} of beaching whales. It is <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>to</b> kill pilot whales at locations with inappropriate conditions. The seabed must gradually slope from the shore out to deep water. Given such conditions, the chances are good that the whales can be driven fully ashore or close enough to the shore that they can be killed from land. When a school of pilot whales is sighted, boats gather behind them and slowly drive them towards the chosen authorized location, usually a bay or the end of a fjord. There are 23 towns, villages or bays (Viðvík is not populated) that have the right conditions, and therefore legal authorization, for beaching whales. These are in alphabetical order: Bøur, Fámjin, Fuglafjørður, Húsavík, Hvalba (and Nes-Hvalba), Hvalvík, Hvannasund, Klaksvík, Leynar, Miðvágur, Norðragøta, Norðskáli, Sandur, Syðrugøta, Tjørnuvík, Tórshavn (in Sandagerð), Tvøroyri, Vágur, Vestmanna, Viðvík (near Hvannasund, but on the east coast of Viðoy) and Øravík.|$|E
2500|$|In 1978, the United States {{signed a}} treaty with Mexico that {{acknowledged}} Mexico's {{right not to}} extradite one of its citizens if the citizen faced the death penalty.

[...] The Mexican Consul announced that unless the Mexican government received assurances that Gómez-García would not face either of these punishments, there would be no extradition. The mandatory penalty for first degree murder in Colorado is either execution or life in prison without the possibility of parole.|$|E

2500|$|Paul's advice at {{the conference}} was to vote for {{whichever}} third-party candidate one has the most affinity to, because [...] "we must maximize the total votes of those rejecting the two major candidates." [...] However, on September 22, 2008, Paul stated his neutrality was [...] "due to my respect and friendship and support from both the Constitution and Libertarian Party members [...] [...] [...] and I'm a ten-term Republican congressman. It is not <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>to</b> participate {{in more than one}} political party." [...] Paul then gave his endorsement to Baldwin: [...] "Unsolicited advice from the Libertarian Party candidate [...] [...] [...] has [...] me to reject my neutral stance in the November election. I'm supporting Chuck Baldwin, the Constitution Party candidate." [...] Paul later clarified that though he would vote for Baldwin, he recognized the diversity of his support base and could not bind anyone's conscience. A former Paul primary backer, Houston term limits pioneer Clymer Wright, also contributed to the Baldwin campaign.|$|E
