5|$|On July 27, 2016, in its {{quarterly}} {{report to the}} Securities and Exchange Commission, Boeing discussed the potential termination of 747 production due to insufficient demand and market for the aircraft. With a firm order backlog of 21 aircraft and <b>a</b> <b>production</b> <b>rate</b> of six per year, program accounting {{has been reduced to}} 1,555 aircraft, and the 747 line could be closed {{in the third quarter of}} 2019. In October 2016, UPS Airlines ordered 14 -8Fs to add capacity, along with 14 options, which doubles its official backlog of 15 – including some to refractory airlines – and could extend production by two more years.|$|E

25|$|Ford {{was asked}} to supply {{cylinders}} for the new engine and rapidly developed an improved technique for cutting and pressing steel, which resulted in cylinder production rising from 151 per day to over 2,000; the company eventually manufactured all 433,826 cylinders produced, as well as 3,950 complete engines. Lincoln constructed a new plant in record time, devoted entirely to Liberty engine production, and assembled 2,000 engines in 12 months. By {{the time of the}} Armistice with Germany, the various companies had produced 13,574 Liberty engines, attaining <b>a</b> <b>production</b> <b>rate</b> of 150 engines per day.

500|$|Although {{the final}} {{contract}} {{for the production of}} Spanish Leopard2Es was signed in 1998, calling for [...] <b>a</b> <b>production</b> <b>rate</b> of four tanks per month, the first Leopard2Es were not manufactured until late 2003. This was largely due to the merging of Santa Bárbara Sistemas with General Dynamics, and Krauss-Maffei's reservations regarding the sharing of the Leopard2's technology with a rival company [...] manufacturer of the M1 Abrams. Krauss-Maffei delivered 30 Leopard2Es between 2003 and 2006. Production by Santa Bárbara Sistemas was delayed after assembly had begun; between January and November [...] 2007, for example, only three of the 43 Leopard2Es to be delivered to the Spanish army were actually delivered—with 15 more being delivered {{before the end of the}} year to make up for the earlier production problems. By 1July 2006 the Spanish army had received 48 Leopard2Es and nine Büffel armored recovery vehicles, which was only a quarter of those contracted. Production of the Leopard 2E was planned to end by 2007 but was extended into 2008.|$|E

By April 2011, 230 production C-17s had been delivered, including 210 to the USAF. The C-17 prototype [...] "T-1" [...] was retired in 2012 after being used by the USAF for testing and development. [...] In January 2010, the USAF announced the end of Boeing's performance-based logistics contracts to maintain the aircraft.

30|$|Among {{parameters}} affecting asphaltene precipitation, <b>production</b> <b>rate,</b> tubing and choke sizes {{have the}} most impact on precipitation process. <b>As</b> <b>production</b> <b>rate</b> increases from 4000 to 7000 STB/day, the length of tubing covered by asphaltene deposition enhances about 40 %; however, a decrease in the <b>production</b> <b>rate</b> to reduce this interval is not desirable. Tubing size has an inverse effect on precipitation length. As a matter of fact, in this case, as the tubing diameter increases from 3 to 7 inches, the precipitation interval reduces about 2500 ft. In addition, a greater increase in the tubing size results in more depth of precipitation initiation. The choke size results in the same effect on the depth of precipitation initiation as the <b>production</b> <b>rate</b> does because generally, an increase in choke size is directly proportional to the <b>production</b> <b>rate.</b>|$|R
