40|$|The {{present study}} compares {{the effect of}} various lectins; {{phytohaemagglutinin}} (PHA), Pokeweed mitogen (PWM) and Concanavalin-A (Con A) on short term lymphocyte culture and morphology of chromosome in cattle <b>and</b> <b>buffaloes.</b> For the comparative studies, the whole blood culture from 5 cattle <b>and</b> 5 <b>buffaloes</b> in triplicate were set up by adding 3 different types of lectins. Results based on physical observation under microscope, indicate best culture and chromosomal morphology when used pokeweed mitogen for lymphocyte culture in case of cattle <b>and</b> <b>buffaloes.</b> However, PHA added cultures exhibited poor lymphocyte cultures in cattle <b>and</b> <b>buffaloes</b> whereas, ConA added culture also yielded adequate proliferation of lymphocytes and good morphology of chromosomes. Therefore, pokeweed mitogen and Con A lectins can be utilized for lymphocyte culture for karyotyping in cattle <b>and</b> <b>buffaloes...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Khla si ko is a Cambodian {{variant of}} Myanmar's Tiger <b>and</b> <b>Buffaloes</b> <b>and</b> of Thailand's Len cúa kín ngoa. Khla si ko when {{translated}} from Khmer to English means tigers and cows, or tigers and bulls. [...] The game is also sometimes spelled as Kla si ko or Khlaa syi kau. [...] Khlaa syi kau may also mean tiger eats cow. The game also uses a 4 x 4 board as in Tiger <b>and</b> <b>buffaloes,</b> but Tiger <b>and</b> <b>buffaloes</b> uses a 4 x 4 square grid where pieces are {{played on the}} gridded lines and intersection points. Khla si ko uses a 4 x 4 square board where the pieces are played within the squares. There are also 4 tigers and 12 cows in Khla si ko which is a contrast to the 3 tigers <b>and</b> 11 <b>buffaloes</b> of Tiger <b>and</b> <b>buffaloes.</b> There are a few other differences also. But both Khla si ko <b>and</b> Tiger <b>and</b> <b>buffaloes</b> have only orthogonal movement of pieces, and only move one space at a time. Tigers in both games capture by the short leap as in draughts and Alquerque, and only in orthogonal directions. Diagonal movements or captures are not allowed in both games. A game called Dragons and Swans is played {{exactly the same way}} with the same board and number of pieces.|$|R

5|$|The {{etymology}} of Buffalo Creek is unknown. No buffalo {{have ever}} been definitely observed on the creek, although there are rumors about old buffalo wallows.

40|$|Taeniasis is an {{important}} foodborne parasitic disease worldwide. This study aimed to determine the occurrence of cysticercosis in cattle <b>and</b> <b>buffaloes</b> <b>and</b> discussing its public health importance in Assiut Governorate, Upper Egypt. The occurrence of cysticercosis among examined cattle <b>and</b> <b>buffaloes</b> was 1. 6 % and 0. 8 % respectively. Female cattle <b>and</b> <b>buffaloes</b> were more susceptible to bovine cysticercosis (2. 7 % and 1. 3 %) than males (1. 4 % & 0. 5 %), respectively. There was {{a positive relationship between}} the age of the examined animals and the occurrence of bovine cysticercosis. The higher occurrence was recorded among cattle <b>and</b> <b>buffaloes</b> above 2 years (2. 7 % and 0. 9 %) than those below 2 years (1. 1 % and 0. 6 %), respectively. Detailed meat inspection showed to be sensitive (1. 6 %) than routine meat inspection (1. 4 %). Taeniasis was detected in 0. 6 % of examined patients with gastroenteritis. The infection rate of taeniasis among males was 1. 6 % while, it was not detected in females. In conclusion, results obtained in this study confirm that cysticercosis is endemic among cattle <b>and</b> <b>buffaloes.</b> Detailed meat inspection is recommended than routine meat inspection.

5|$|Along {{with the}} Cleveland Cavaliers <b>and</b> <b>Buffalo</b> Braves (now Los Angeles Clippers), the Trail Blazers entered the NBA in 1970 as an {{expansion}} team, under coach Rolland Todd. Geoff Petrie and Sidney Wicks {{led the team}} in its early years, and the team failed {{to qualify for the}} playoffs in its first six seasons of existence. During that span, the team had three head coaches (including future hall-of-famer Lenny Wilkens); team executive Stu Inman also served as coach. The team won the first pick in the NBA draft twice during that span. In 1972, the team drafted LaRue Martin with the number one pick, and in 1974 the team selected Bill Walton from UCLA.|$|E
5|$|An {{additional}} three-mile {{section of}} Illinois 22 from Illinois 83 to Milwaukee Avenue, primarily located in Buffalo Grove, was another closely related project {{that was once}} again met with similar delays and concerns. Long Grove got on board in May 2005 and approved any widening between its eastern city limits and Illinois 83. Roadwork began in the fall on the two-year project, and in September 2007 it was finished; complete with four concrete lanes and a center grassy median. Again, intersection improvements were also made, this time adding dual left turn lanes to both east–west approaches at Illinois 83 <b>and</b> <b>Buffalo</b> Grove Road.|$|E

40|$|The {{experimental}} data on mastitis incidence was {{collected from the}} cows <b>and</b> <b>buffaloes</b> {{to find out the}} incidence of mastitis as influenced by stages of lactation and level of milk production. The incidence of mastitis was more in early and mid stages of lactation in comparison to late stages of lactation. The stages of lactation and level of milk production significantly (P< 0. 05) influence mastitis incidence in crossbred cows <b>and</b> <b>buffaloes</b> but indigenous cows (Sahiwal and Tharparkar) behaved differently. It was concluded that mid and early stages of lactation are very prone to mastitis incidence. Therefore better care is required to minimize mastitis incidence in high yielding cows <b>and</b> <b>buffaloes</b> in this stage...|$|R

5|$|Buffalo Creek {{begins in}} Hartley Township, in Union County, near the Union County/Centre County border. It flows east and {{slightly}} north between Buffalo Mountain and Branch Mountain before falling steeply through two geographical features {{known as the}} Gooseneck <b>and</b> <b>Buffalo</b> Gap. The creek then turns southeast and flows out of Hartley Township. Upon leaving Hartley Township, the creek enters Lewis Township and meanders eastward, south of Jones Mountain. It passes through the Mifflinburg Reservoir. The creek then flows into southern West Buffalo Township and northern Mifflinburg. Shortly before exiting West Buffalo Township, Buffalo Creek picks up its tributary North Branch Buffalo Creek and briefly turns northwards before turning eastward again and leaving the township.|$|E
