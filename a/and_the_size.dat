5|$|Because Guianan {{cocks-of-the-rock}} form large leks, averaging 55 adult males, {{the males}} in these display leks were {{especially vulnerable to}} attacks and predation by large snakes and other natural predators. In manipulated groups of smaller size, around 6, predation was less likely to occur, giving rise to an inverse relationship between the number and frequency of attacks <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> of leks. Thus, with a smaller frequency of attacks on the smaller group, the Guianan cock-of-the-rock males was less likely to spook or disperse completely as compared to a large group where a false alarm could trigger a complete flush out 90% of the time. It was found that these birds have relatively ineffective methods of anti-predation and that only social anti-predation and the infrequency of encounters with predators were keeping these lekking males alive.|$|E

MAIN OUTCOMES <b>AND</b> MEASURES <b>The</b> numbers of psychiatric beds <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sizes</b> of prison populations. RESULTS Since 1990, the numbers of psychiatric beds decreased in all 6 countries (ranging from - 2. 0 % to - 71. 9 %), while <b>the</b> <b>sizes</b> of prison populations increased substantially (ranging from 16. 1 % to 273. 0 %). Panel data regression analysis across the 6 countries showed a significant inverse relationship between numbers of psychiatric beds and sizes of prison populations. On average, the removal of 1 bed was associated with 5. 18 more prisoners (95 % CI, 3. 10 - 7. 26; P =. 001), which was reduced to 2. 78 prisoners (95 % CI, 2. 59 - 2. 97; P <. 001) when economic growth was considered as a covariate. The association between the numbers of psychiatric beds <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sizes</b> of prison populations remained practically unchanged when income inequality was considered as a covariate (- 4. 28 [95 % CI, - 5. 21 to - 3. 36]; P <. 001).
