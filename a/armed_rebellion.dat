5|$|As {{the revolt}} and raids were {{occurring}} in Campania, {{which was a}} vacation region {{of the rich and}} influential in Rome, and the location of many estates, the revolt quickly {{came to the attention of}} Roman authorities. They initially viewed the revolt as more a major crime wave than an <b>armed</b> <b>rebellion.</b>|$|E
5|$|Finally {{the protests}} became an <b>armed</b> <b>{{rebellion}}.</b> The first {{shots were fired}} at the Oliver Miller Homestead in present-day South Park Township, Pennsylvania, about ten miles south of Pittsburgh. As word of the rebellion spread across the frontier, {{a whole series of}} loosely organized resistance measures were taken, including robbing the mail, stopping court proceedings, and the threat of an assault on Pittsburgh. One group disguised as women assaulted a tax collector, cropped his hair, coated him with tar and feathers, and stole his horse. Another group bombarded the estate of the tax collector John Neville, a friend of George Washington.|$|E
5|$|Once back in {{northern}} Thrace, Vitalian went into hiding, {{while many of}} his erstwhile aides were captured and executed. Nothing is known of him {{for the next three}} years, although a short remark by a chronicler seems to indicate that he resurfaced and led another <b>armed</b> <b>rebellion</b> during the last months of Anastasius's life. When Anastasius died in July 518, he was succeeded by Justin I, the comes excubitorum (commander of the imperial bodyguard). The new emperor quickly moved to strengthen his rule, dismissing a number of potential rivals or enemies. At the same time, he called upon Vitalian to come to Constantinople.|$|E
25|$|During 1926 and 1927, Mexico {{found itself}} {{immersed}} {{in a wave of}} violent territorial, religious and military <b>armed</b> <b>rebellions,</b> which required the Mexican Air Force to quickly deploy its forces and provide air support wherever the federal army requested them.|$|R

It started with President Museveni's National Resistance Army, present-day Uganda People's Defence Force, when it embarked on <b>armed</b> <b>rebellions</b> to attack the Obote administration in 1981, commonly known as Ugandan Bush War of 1981- 1986.|$|R
50|$|In Ireland, a rebel song is a {{folk song}} whose lyrics extol the deeds of actual or fictional {{participants}} {{in any of}} the various <b>armed</b> <b>rebellions</b> against English, and later British, rule in Ireland. Songs about older rebellions were long popular with most Irish nationalists; more recent songs are associated with supporters of physical force Irish republicanism.|$|R
5|$|After {{the defeat}} of Perseus at Pydna in 168BC, the Roman Senate allowed the reopening of iron and copper mines, but forbade the mining of gold and silver by the four newly {{established}} autonomous client states that replaced the monarchy in Macedonia. The law may originally have been conceived by the Senate due to the fear that material wealth gained from gold and silver mining operations would allow the Macedonians to fund an <b>armed</b> <b>rebellion.</b> The Romans were perhaps also concerned with stemming inflation caused by an increased money supply from Macedonian silver mining. The Macedonians continued minting silver coins between 167 and 148BC (i.e. just before {{the establishment of the}} Roman province of Macedonia), and when the Romans lifted the ban on Macedonian silver mining in 158BC it may simply have reflected the local reality of this illicit practice continuing regardless of the Senate's decree.|$|E
5|$|During {{the ensuing}} months the communists tried {{repeatedly}} to seize power in Stuttgart {{and other cities}} in Württemberg through <b>armed</b> <b>rebellion,</b> accompanied by large-scale strikes. They seized public buildings and print offices. During one such an attempt - {{at the beginning of}} April 1919 when the Bavarian Soviet Republic was formally proclaimed in Munich - a general strike took place in the Stuttgart area. The government in Stuttgart imposed a state of emergency and 16 people died in street fights. At the time of these events, Rau used his position as chief of the military police in Zuffenhausen to shut down companies that remained operational while the strike was ongoing. However, when the strike collapsed, Rau was removed from office by the government.|$|E
5|$|In {{dividing}} his lands, William {{appears to}} have followed the Norman tradition, distinguishing between Normandy, which he had inherited, and England, which he had acquired through war. William's second son, Richard, {{had died in a}} hunting accident, leaving Henry and his two brothers to inherit William's estate. Robert, the eldest, despite being in <b>armed</b> <b>rebellion</b> against his father {{at the time of his}} death, received Normandy. England was given to William Rufus, who was in favour with the dying king. Henry was given a large sum of money, usually reported as £5,000, with the expectation that he would also be given his mother's modest set of lands in Buckinghamshire and Gloucestershire. William's funeral at Caen was marred by angry complaints from a local man, and Henry may have been responsible for resolving the dispute by buying off the protester with silver.|$|E
25|$|Between {{the years}} 1923 and 1929, Mexico found itself {{immersed}} {{in a wave of}} violent territorial, religious and military <b>armed</b> <b>rebellions,</b> which required the Air Force to quickly deploy its forces and provide air support wherever the federal army requested them. Some of these conflicts, that were decided mostly by the assertive use of the Air Force, are mentioned below.|$|R

5|$|The Anahuac Disturbances {{coincided with}} a Mexican civil war. Texians aligned {{themselves}} with proponents of federalism advocating a stronger role for state governments, in opposition to a centralized government that set most policies at the national level. The federalists prevailed, and their favored general, Antonio López de Santa Anna, was elected president. In 1835, Santa Anna began consolidating power; in response federalists launched <b>armed</b> <b>rebellion</b> in several Mexican states. Travis, an ardent foe of centralism, led an attack on Anahuac in June 1835 and forced the Mexican garrison to surrender. Many Texas settlers thought Travis's action was imprudent, and {{he was forced to}} apologize. Although the Mexican government issued a warrant for his arrest, local authorities did not enforce it.|$|E
5|$|The British {{policy of}} salutary neglect for its North American colonies {{intended}} to minimise trade restrictions {{as a way}} of ensuring they stayed loyal to British interests. This permitted the development of the American Dream, a cultural spirit distinct from that of its European founders. The Thirteen Colonies of British America began an <b>armed</b> <b>rebellion</b> against British rule in 1775 when they rejected the right of the Parliament of Great Britain to govern them without representation; they proclaimed their independence in 1776, and constituted the first thirteen states of the United States of America, which became a sovereign state in 1781 with the ratification of the Articles of Confederation. The 1783 Treaty of Paris represented Great Britain's formal acknowledgement of the United States' sovereignty {{at the end of the}} American Revolutionary War.|$|E
5|$|Tuđman's {{programme}} {{was opposed}} by {{many members of}} Croatia's Serb minority, towards whom he was overtly antagonistic. The Serb Democratic Party (SDS) of Croatia, supported by Milošević, denounced the HDZ as a reincarnation of the nationalist-fascist Ustaše movement, which had massacred {{hundreds of thousands of}} Serbs during the Second World War. From mid-1990, the SDS mounted an <b>armed</b> <b>rebellion</b> in Serb-inhabited areas of Croatia and set up the self-declared Serbian Autonomous Oblast of Krajina with covert support from the Serbian government and Serbian paramilitary groups. The Croatian government rapidly lost control of large areas of the republic. In February 1991, the Krajina Serbs declared independence from Croatia and announced that they would unite with Serbia. Other Serb communities around Croatia also announced that they would secede and established their own militias.|$|E

5|$|Though Henry IV gave Thomas Percy {{influence}} in south Wales, {{relations between the}} two deteriorated due partly to delays in payment. Thomas’ nephew, Henry Percy, rose in <b>armed</b> <b>rebellion</b> in July 1403 and Thomas joined him. The rebellion culminated in the battle of Shrewsbury in which Thomas Percy was captured. Two days later, on 23 July, he was beheaded and his property– including Wressle Castle– was subsequently confiscated by the crown. Between 1403 and 1471 ownership of the castle swapped between the crown and those the reigning monarch chose to grant it to, though only for short periods. In 1471, Wressle Castle was given to Henry Percy, 4th Earl of Northumberland, returning it to the Percy family. His son, Henry Algernon Percy, 5th Earl of Northumberland, undertook an extensive programme of refurbishment at Wressle Castle, refurbishing the interior and updating the gardens. At the time {{he was one of the}} richest men in England. The Northumberland Household Book was compiled around this time and details day-to-day domestic activities at the castles of Wressle and Leconfield, and is used by historians to study the late medieval household.|$|E
5|$|Whilst {{editor of}} the paper, Marx and the other revolutionary socialists were {{regularly}} harassed {{by the police and}} Marx was brought to trial on several occasions, facing various allegations including insulting the Chief Public Prosecutor, committing a press misdemeanor and inciting <b>armed</b> <b>rebellion</b> through tax boycotting, although each time he was acquitted. Meanwhile, the democratic parliament in Prussia collapsed and the king, Frederick William IV, introduced a new cabinet of his reactionary supporters, who implemented counter-revolutionary measures to expunge leftist and other revolutionary elements from the country. Consequently, the Neue Rheinische Zeitung was soon suppressed and Marx was ordered to leave the country on 16 May. Marx returned to Paris, which was then under the grip of both a reactionary counter-revolution and a cholera epidemic and was soon expelled by the city authorities, who considered him a political threat. With his wife Jenny expecting their fourth child and not able to move back to Germany or Belgium, in August 1849 he sought refuge in London.|$|E

The Eureka Stockade arose {{as a result of}} Government and police abuses against gold miners. A large force of police and soldiers assaulted a stockade set up by miners. Six soldiers and twenty-two miners were killed.|$|R

50|$|In {{the late}} Ottoman Empire, <b>armed</b> <b>rebellions</b> became a chronic feature {{of life in}} {{geographic}} Macedonia as armed groups of pro-Bulgarian and pro-Serbian Slavic activists, as well as Greek, Aromanian and Albanian formations fought against each other {{as well as the}} Ottoman troops, trying to impose their nationality on the territory's inhabitants, and increasingly harsh Ottoman crackdowns indicated that reform and reconciliation of the Ottoman state with the various nationalist groups was growing less likely.|$|R
5|$|Cornered, Montfort had {{to accept}} a truce and agree to submit the issue to {{arbitration}} by the French king Louis IX. By the Mise of Amiens, Louis decided entirely in favour of Henry, and repudiated the provisions. The settlement did not present {{a solution to the}} conflict, but rather a recipe for further problems. The one-sided decision for the king and against the barons left Montfort with little choice but <b>armed</b> <b>rebellion.</b> Hostilities started already in February, when Montfort's sons, Henry and another Simon, attacked the possessions of Roger Mortimer in the Marches. Henry summoned the feudal army, and the royal forces won an important victory at Northampton, where the younger Simon was captured. Montfort was still in control of London, as Henry regained control over Kent and Sussex. Montfort marched out of London to negotiate, but the termsinvolving maintaining the provisionswere rejected by the king. The only option remaining was to fight, and the two forces met at Lewes on 14 May 1264. In spite of inferior numbers, the baronial forces led by Simon de Montfort won the battle. Edward, commanding the right wing, quickly defeated the London forces. When he set out in pursuit of the fleeing soldiers, however, he left the rest of the royal army exposed. The baronial forces took advantage of the situation, and soon won the day.|$|E

50|$|The Black Society for Salvation (Shoqëria e zezë për shpëtim) was {{a secret}} Albanian {{nationalist}} society established in 1909.

50|$|The Somali Dervish {{movement}} was an <b>arm</b> <b>rebellion</b> that abruptly {{began in the}} spring of 1899 and lasted some twenty years till 1920. Initially the rebellion began as an anti French Catholic Mission revolt. The rebelling mullahs and leaders opposed the church's missionary activities in particular educating young children and in some instances converting them to Christianity. They also protested what they alleged was an interference in their independence and a persecution of their members by the British Somali Coast administration.|$|R

25|$|Counter-insurgency {{operations}} are common during war, occupation and <b>armed</b> <b>rebellions.</b> Counter-insurgency may be armed suppression of a rebellion, coupled with tactics such as divide and rule designed to fracture {{the links between}} the insurgency and the population in which the insurgents move. Because {{it may be difficult}} or impossible to distinguish between an insurgent, a supporter of an insurgency who is a non-combatant, and entirely uninvolved members of the population, counter-insurgency operations have often rested on a confused, relativistic, or otherwise situational distinction between insurgents and non-combatants.|$|R
50|$|Historians have {{suggested}} {{the story of}} the plot may have been largely manufactured by Charles or his supporters to allow the removal of most of his strongest political opponents. Richard Greaves cites as proof that there was a plot in 1683, the 1685 <b>armed</b> <b>rebellions</b> of the fugitive Earl of Argyll and Charles' Protestant illegitimate son, James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth (Greaves 1992). Doreen Milne asserts that its importance lies less in what was actually plotted than in the public perception of it and the uses made of it by the government.|$|R
