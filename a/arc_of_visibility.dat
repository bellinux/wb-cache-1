The <b>visibility</b> graph <b>of</b> P is a graph G obtained by representing each vertex of P by a vertex of G and two vertices of G are joined by an edge {{if and only if}} their corresponding vertices in P are visible. A graph G is a visibility graph if there exists a simple polygon P such that G is isomorphic to the <b>visibility</b> graph <b>of</b> P. No characterization <b>of</b> <b>visibility</b> graphs is available. Coullard and Lubiw derived a necessary condition for a graph to be the <b>visibility</b> graph <b>of</b> a simple polygon.
