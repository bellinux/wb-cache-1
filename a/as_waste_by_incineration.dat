Many studies {{have been carried out}} which describe the possibilities to produce energy from food <b>waste</b> <b>by</b> <b>incineration</b> and anaerobic digestion, or to use food <b>waste</b> <b>as</b> feed for pigs and cattle in order to close the nutrient loop [5 – 11]. Another approach is the application of food <b>waste</b> <b>as</b> feedstock in cultivation of microorganisms. This approach allows the recycling of waste matters consisting of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous compounds, by assimilation in biomass and metabolites of microorganisms, being used for production of chemicals, materials and energy.|$|R

40|$|A recent group {{study on}} the problem of solid waste {{disposal}} provided a decision making model for a community to use in determining the future for its solid waste. The model is a combination of the following factors: technology, legal, social, political, economic and environmental. An assessment of local or community needs determines what form of energy recovery is desirable. A market for low pressure steam or hot water would direct a community to recover energy from solid <b>waste</b> <b>by</b> <b>incineration</b> to generate steam. A fuel gas could be produced by a process known as pyrolysis if there is a local market for a low heating value gaseous fuel.

40|$|The thermal {{treatment}} of <b>waste</b> <b>by</b> <b>incineration</b> {{is considered an}} ultimate solution {{in order to get}} rid of <b>waste</b> properly <b>by</b> using the combustible properties of waste and transforming them into inert form and gaseous emission, with the main advantage of a huge reduction in mass and volume of treated waste, destruction of the dangerous components in waste, and obtaining green and clean energy from the exothermal reaction from the completed combustion process. In order to achieve the main goal of incineration, a good design, construction, supervision, and intensive operation and maintenance must be taken into account, especially for the small-scale incinerator. This research will deal with the green, innovative, and eco design and manufacturing technology of a 1 -ton per batch municipal solid waste (MSW) incinerator. The concept design of the incinerator will focus on the design of the feeding process where only one batch of waste will be discharged into the combustion chamber at one time instead of the semi-feed process, as found in the conventional incinerator. This will ease the operation of the operator and reduce the operating cost. Moreover, the innovative design includes the redesign of combustion air injection into either the primary or secondary combustion chamber in order to achieve the 3 Ts of combustion (time, temperature. and turbulence). This design can eliminate the use of an auxiliary burner in the primary combustion chamber. Rethinking the innovative design of using recirculation hot flue gas for preheating of wet garbage in order to pre-dry the waste before combustion is also taken into account. The manufacturing process of the wall composition as well as other parts of the incinerator are also examined...|$|R
40|$|Solid {{waste is}} an {{unwanted}} byproduct of modern civilization. Land fills {{are the most}} common means of solid waste disposal. But, the increasing amount of solid waste is rapidly filling existing land fills, and new sites are difficult to establish. Alternatives to land fills include the use of source reduction, recycling, composting and incineration, as well as use of land fills. Incineration is most economical if it includes energy recovery from the waste. Energy can be recovered directly from <b>waste</b> <b>by</b> <b>incineration</b> or the <b>waste</b> can be processed to produce storable refuse derived fuel (RDF). Information on the composition of solid wastes is important in evaluating alternative equipment needs, systems, management programs and plans.

40|$|The {{presence}} of {{waste in the}} environment has frequently been indicated as a significant risk to human health. Therefore, landfill sites and the disposal of urban solid and non-hazardous <b>waste</b> <b>by</b> <b>incineration</b> are subject to much environmental monitoring, {{in addition to the}} regulations already in place. However, little action has been taken, and consequently no specific legislation exists, in relation to the assessment of the real biological risk of various substances, including chemical mixtures and ashes, derived from the incineration processes. This study assessed the cytotoxic potential of humid lightweight coal ash (LA) derived from incineration processes and waste management, on two cell lines: NCTC 2544 normal human keratinocytes and HECV endothelial cells. To reach this goal and to assess more-realistic methods for animal replacement, we employed different in vitro experimental approaches: acute and longer exposure to LA, by direct and indirect contact (0 – 2 mg/ml and 16 mg, respectively), both in 2 -D and 3 -D cultures. In 2 -D HECV cultures, we observed a decrease in the viability index, but only during direct contact with LA doses higher than 0. 1 mg/ml. Moreover, some striking differences in cytotoxicity were observed between the 2 -D and 3 -D models. Taken together, these observations indicate that, for studying pollutant toxicity during longer exposure times, 3 -D cultures in direct contact with the pollutant seem to offer a more suitable approach — they mimic the in vivo behaviour of cells more realistically and under strictly controlled conditions. Thus, in readiness for possible forthcoming European regulations, we believe that the proposed study, even in its preliminary phase, can provide new advice on the assessment of the toxic and biological potential of particular chemical compounds derived from waste management processes...|$|R

30|$|Cost-effective {{remedial}} measures {{have to be}} considered for the prevention of fluorosis if fluoride concentration in a water source exceeds the permissible level. In this paper we report a new adsorbent that has been developed by activating the locally available stone dust (SD). The SD is generally generated from stone quarry and is usually considered <b>as</b> <b>waste</b> <b>by</b> the quarry masters because of its small size, low cost and for having fewer applications. The preliminary study on fluoride removal capacity of SD by batch method showed more than 0.91  mg F removed/g of SD. Depending on factors like pH, temperature and, of course, quality of the activated alumina (AA) we could achieve 9  mg F removed/g of AA. However, AA is comparatively expensive and at lower pH presence of aluminum ions in the treated water cannot be ruled out (Hao and Huang 1986). In order to minimize the use of large quantity of AA and to reduce the cost, the idea of using SD and AA adsorbents at a fixed ratio was developed to remove fluoride from water and incorporated in the proposed fluoride removal unit.|$|R
