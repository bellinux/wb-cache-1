50|$|In one {{application}} the asymmetry in an <b>atropisomer</b> {{is transferred}} in a chemical {{reaction to a}} new stereocenter. The <b>atropisomer</b> is an iodoaryl compound synthesised starting from (S)-valine and exists as the (M,S) isomer and the (P,S) isomer. The interconversion barrier {{between the two is}} 24.3 kcal/mol (101.7 kJ/mol). The (M,S) isomer can be obtained exclusively from this mixture by recrystallisation from hexanes. The iodine group is homolytically removed to form an aryl radical by a tributyltin hydride/triethylboron/oxygen mixture as in the Barton-McCombie reaction. Although the hindered rotation is now removed in the aryl radical, the intramolecular reaction with the alkene is so much faster than is rotation of the carbon-nitrogen bond that the stereochemistry is preserved. In this way the (M,S) isomer yields the (S,S) dihydroindolone.|$|E
50|$|Phanephos can be {{prepared}} by two steps from 2.2paracyclophane. In the first step, 2.2paracyclophane is dibrominated to give a pseudo-para dibromide.

This isomer is subjected to lithium-halogen exchange by nBuLi and the resulting dilithium compound is treated with PPh2Cl to give a racemic mixture of Phanephos.|$|E

[...] A recent example in the area of chiral biaryl asymmetric catalysis employs a five-membered imidazole as part of the <b>atropisomer</b> scaffold. This specific phosphorus, nitrogen-ligand has been shown to perform enantioselective A3-coupling.|$|E
50|$|Atrop-abyssomicin C has a complex, yet {{intriguing}} structural topography. The compound {{contains a}} oxabicyclo2.2.2octane system fused to the tetronate moiety. The 11-membered macrocyclic ring carries an α,β-unsaturated ketone that was proposed {{to be the}} reactive center. Despite being a strained macrocycle, there exist an <b>atropisomer,</b> abyssomicin C. The atropisomerism arise due to a structural deviation in the α,β-unsaturated ketone region of the molecule. The orientation of the carbonyl in atrop-abyssomicin C is cisoid, whereas the conformation in abyssomicin C is transoid. The enone moiety of atrop-abyssomicin C has {{a higher degree of}} the conjugation, which makes it a more active Michael acceptor.|$|E
50|$|Atrop-abyssomicin C is {{polycyclic}} polyketide-type {{natural product}} that is the <b>atropisomer</b> of abyssomicin C. It is a spirotetronate that belongs to the class of tetronate antibiotics, which includes compounds such as tetronomycin, agglomerin, and chlorothricin. In 2006, the Nicolaou group discovered atrop-abyssomicin C while working on the total synthesis of abyssomicin C. Then in 2007, Süssmuth and co-workers isolated atrop-abyssomicin C from Verrucosispora maris AB-18-032, a marine actinomycete found in sediment of the Japanese sea. They found that atrop-abyssomicin C was the major metabolite produced by this strain, while abyssomicin C was a minor product. The molecule displays antibacterial activity by inhibiting the enzyme PabB (4-amino-4-deoxychorismate synthase), thereby depleting the biosynthesis of p-aminobenzoate.|$|E
50|$|The {{importance}} of atropisomers arises to significant degree because with sufficient stability of a conformer, they can display axial chirality (planar chirality). Atropisomers that display axial chirality often have substituents ortho to the bond joining the aryl rings, substituents that cause significant steric repulsion that hinders rotation about the bond. The degree of hindrance correlates with the van der Waals radii {{of the particular}} substituents, and other properties that contribute to their repulsive potentials. As the Ōki refinement of the <b>atropisomer</b> definition suggests, atropisomers {{are involved in a}} chemical equilibrium that, for a given structure, is thermally controlled; they differ in this way from most other types of chiral structures, where interconversion involves a chemical isomerization (i.e., with breaking and reforming of covalent bonds).|$|E
5000|$|Once the heptapeptide {{backbone}} {{has been}} formed, the cyclization of the linear structure is begun. [...] Gene disruption studies indicate a cytochrome P450 oxygenase as the enzyme that performs the coupling reactions. OxyB {{has been suggested}} to form the first ring by coupling residues 4 and 6. OxyA then couples residues 2 and 4, followed by {{the formation of a}} C-C bond between residues 5 and 7 by OxyC. A fourth enzyme catalyzes the coupling of residues 1 and 3, although where this coupling fits into the OxyB/OxyA/OxyC order is not known. The regioselectivity and <b>atropisomer</b> selectivity of these probable one-electron coupling reactions has been suggested to be due to the folding and orientation requirements of the partially crossed-linked substrates in the enzyme active site. [...] The coupling reactions are shown below.|$|E
5000|$|Atropisomers are {{stereoisomers}} arising {{because of}} hindered rotation about a single bond, where energy differences due to steric strain or other contributors create {{a barrier to}} rotation that is high enough to allow for isolation of individual conformers. The word <b>atropisomer</b> (Gr., άτροπος, atropos, meaning [...] "without turn") was coined in application to a theoretical concept by German biochemist Richard Kuhn for Karl Freudenberg's seminal Stereochemie volume in 1933. Atropisomerism was first experimentally detected in a tetra substituted biphenyl, a diacid, by George Christie and James Kenner in 1922. Michinori Ōki further refined the definition of atropisomers {{taking into account the}} temperature-dependence associated with the interconversion of conformers, specifying that atropisomers interconvert with a half-life of at least 1000 seconds at a given temperature, corresponding to an energy barrier of 93 kJ mol−1 (22 kcal mol −1) at 300 K (27 °C).|$|E
50|$|Ring-closing {{metathesis}} {{is important}} in total synthesis. One example is its use {{in the formation of}} the 12-membered ring in the synthesis of the naturally occurring cyclophane floresolide. Floresolide B was isolated from an ascidian of the genus Apidium and showed cytotoxicity against KB tumor cells. In 2005, K. C. Nicolaou and others completed a synthesis of both isomers through late-stage ring-closing metathesis using the 2nd Generation Grubbs catalyst to afford a mixture of E- and Z- isomers (1:3 E/Z) in 89% yield. Although one prochiral center is present the product is racemic. Floresolide is an <b>atropisomer</b> as the new ring forms (due to steric constraints in the transition state) passing through the front of the carbonyl group in and not the back. The carbonyl group then locks the ring permanently in place. The E/Z isomers were then separated and then the phenol nitrobenzoate protective group was removed in the final step by potassium carbonate to yield the final product and the unnatural Z-isomer.|$|E

Among the columns studied, the BGB- 176 SE capillary column provided the best results, allowing the simultaneous enantioselective resolution of six MeSO 2 -PCBs and six chiral PCBs; the Chirasil-Dex column did not resolve any of the studied MeSO 2 -PCBs; and a poor resolution was obtained for three MeSO 2 -PCBs when the BGB- 172 column was employed. The developed method was successfully applied to two fish oil and one cow liver samples commercially available, which showed different enantioselective pattern. PCBs 91 and 176 presented a clear enrichment of the second eluted <b>atropisomer</b> in codfish oil, whereas in fish oil sample, slight enrichment of the first eluted <b>atropisomer</b> of CB 45 and the second eluted <b>atropisomer</b> of CB 136 were observed...|$|E

Transannular strain within the pyrrolophane structure of this molecule causes restricted rotation that {{gives rise to}} the possibility of (diastereomeric) atropisomers. Neither the relative nor the absolute stereochemistry of streptorubin B is known. NOESY NMR experiments were used to define the relative stereochemistry of the major <b>atropisomer</b> of streptorubin B·HCl in solution as anti. We exploited this finding together with our knowledge of streptorubin B biosynthesis in S. coelicolor to determine the absolute stereochemistry of the anti <b>atropisomer.</b> 2 -Undecylpyrrole stereoselectively labeled with deuterium at C- 4 ′ was synthesized and fed to a mutant of S. coelicolor, which was unable to produce streptorubin B because it was blocked in 2 -undecylpyrrole biosynthesis, and in which the genes responsible for the last two steps of streptorubin B biosynthesis were overexpressed. 1 H and 2 H NMR analysis of the stereoselectively deuterium-labeled streptorubin B·HCl produced by this mutasynthesis strategy allowed us to assign the absolute stereochemistry of the major (anti) <b>atropisomer</b> as 7 ′S. HPLC analyses of streptorubin B isolated from S. coelicolor on a homochiral stationary phase and comparisons with streptorubin B derived from an enantioselective synthesis showed that the natural product consists of an approximately 88 : 7 : 5 mixture of the (7 ′S, anti), (7 ′S, syn), and (7 ′R, anti) stereoisomers...|$|E

Solid-state NMR and X-ray diffraction of 4 established that only the more stable <b>atropisomer</b> (Z) is present in the crystalline state.

40|$|The role of halogens in the 5 -endo-trig cyclizations of {{radicals}} {{derived from}} N-cyclohexenyl-α-haloacetamides {{on the product}} distribution has been thoroughly investigated. Under reductive radical conditions, α-chloroamides produce octahydroindolones, while α-iodoamides primarily give a mixture of hexahydroindolones and N-cyclohexenylacetamides. Kinetic studies showed the rate constants of cyclization are not critically halogen-dependent, but the ratio of cyclized to oxidized products {{is dependent on the}} halogen used in the radical precursor. When the starting halide is easily reducible, a single electron transfer from cyclized intermediates to starting material overrides the normal reductive chain process. This process spurs an ionic, acid-driven reductive halogenation process, which disrupts the anticipated radical chain mechanism. Addition of excess base suppresses the reductive dehalogenation pathway. Enantioenriched derivatives of N-allyl-o-iodoarylcarbamates undergo radical cyclizations to give enantioenriched dihydroindoles in 87 - 100 % yields and 83 - 92 % chirality transfers. Anionic cyclizations of these substrates proceed in 58 - 74 % yields and 84 - 99 % chirality transfers. N-Aryl barriers to rotation were measured and found to be comparable to similar o-iodoacetanilides. The radical and anionic cyclizations proceed with the same sense of chirality. Radical cyclizations of N-cyclohexenyl-o-iodoanilides may only occur through the syn <b>atropisomer</b> when an additional ortho substituent is present on the aromatic ring. When a second ortho substituent is not present, N-aryl rotation of the intermediate radical is faster than all competing processes. Heck cyclizations on these substrates proceed through the anti <b>atropisomer,</b> requiring simultaneous N-aryl and N-cyclohexenyl rotations to achieve the necessary transition state. The β-elimination step of these Heck reactions occurs with complete syn selectivity. Radical cyclizations of axially chiral α-haloacetanilides which contain an ortho-radical acceptor produce dihydroquinolin- 2 -ones in high yields and with high levels of chirality transfer (80 - 100 %). A model of chirality transfer has been determined by absolute configuration determination of a substrate / product pair by X-ray crystallography. Secondary α-haloamides faithfully cyclize with exclusive trans selectivity.

40|$|During {{the thesis}} period {{a new class}} of atropisomeric {{xanthine}} derivatives has been studied. We decided to focus our attention on these purine bases because of their various biological activities, that could {{play an important role in}} the discovery of new bioactive atropisomers. The synthesized compounds bear an Aryl-N chiral axis in position 1 of the xanthine scaffold, around which the rotation is prevented by the presence of bulky ortho substituents. Through a retro synthetic analysis we synthesized three atropisomeric structures bearing in position 1 of the purine scaffold respectively an o-tolyl, o-nitrophenyl and a 1 -naphthyl group. The conformational studies by DFT simulations showed that the interconversion energy barrier between the two available skewed conformations is higher enough to obtain thermally stable atropisomers. After the separation of the atropisomers, the experimental energy of interconversion was investigated by means of kinetic studies following the thermal racemization process using an enantioselective HPLC column. The absolute configuration of each <b>atropisomer</b> was assigned by experimental ECD analysis and TD-DFT simulations of the ECD spectra...|$|E
40|$|The Baltic Sea was earlier {{identified}} as a highly polluted brackish water body and still is. The high concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), p,p’-DDT and related compounds led to severe effects on several species in the Baltic region. However, the situation has improved significantly since the 1970 ’s resulting in lower exposures {{to a range of}} pollutants and healthier wildlife populations. Independent of this positive trend there are still new chemicals leaking into the Baltic Sea environment. The objective of this thesis is to improve the knowledge of sulfone containing compounds and pollutant metabolites in wildlife, with special interest in bis(4 -chlorophenyl) sulfone (BCPS) distribution, temporal trend and exposure levels, and the methylsulfonyl-PCBs (MeSO 2 -PCBs). The latter are of particular interest for chiral MeSO 2 -PCBs. BCPS is used for the production of high temperature polymers and was detected as an environmental contaminant ten years ago. PCBs, p,p’-DDT and related compounds are still of scientific interest. BCPS is biomagnified and especially in the bird guillemot which has levels of up to 2000 ng BCPS/g fat compared to the grey seal with concentrations of about 60 ng/g fat. The seal levels are similar to the herring, the prey of the bird and seal, with concentrations of 30 ng BCPS/g fat. The guillemot concentration of BCPS has been similar over the last 30 years with a minimal, but significant, annual decline of 1. 6 %. The reason for the slow decline is not yet understood. Also MeSO 2 -PCBs and 3 -MeSO 2 -DDE show a small decrease over time in guillemot egg (3 and 9 %, respectively), which is less then for the parent compounds. This shows that the sulfone metabolites are more persistent than their precursors in the guillemot. Furthermore, all these sulfone containing compounds showed a specific retention to liver comparing different tissues in grey seal. The atropisomers of the chiral MeSO 2 -PCB were analysed in both the guillemot and the grey seal and showed to occur in a skewed relationship. This is particularly pronounced in seals where one <b>atropisomer</b> of each chiral congener is very dominating. The dominating atropisomers have been identified with an absolute R configuration, in both grey seal and guillemot. An enantioselective metabolism was indicated to occur when experimentally tested by CB- 132 in rat. This thesis is stressing the high specificity in wildlife for one <b>atropisomer</b> in the pair of chiral PCB methyl sulfones being PCB metabolites, and the high BCPS concentrations in guillemot hatching in the Baltic proper...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 49 - 50). A {{major obstacle}} in drug design {{today is the}} issue of axial chirality, which typically arises from hindered rotation around an sp 2 -sp 2 bond. We have set out to develop new chemical methodologies that enable the facile synthesis of atropisomeric amides, which are ubiquitous throughout biologically active small molecules. The overarching goal is to develop an <b>atropisomer</b> selective amide coupling between a carboxylic acid and an amine. This master???s thesis will discuss a diverse set of methods that we have studied towards this goal. 	Finally, in response to an accident in an undergraduate organic lab there was a need to update and replace a potentially dangerous ???classic??? lab module. To this end we created a new lab module based on chemistry that was recently developed in the Gustafson lab. In the chlorination of caffeine {{through the use of a}} Lewis Base catalyst, students are introduced to electrophilic aromatic substitutions as well as modern concepts and techniques such as catalysis and chromatography. The lab module was successfully ???beta tested??? across two sections of Chemistry 432 in the Spring 2015 section at SDSU and will be extended to all sections in the oncoming semesters...|$|E
40|$|Transition metal {{complexes}} of chiroporphyrins, {{in which}} two adjacent meso substituents are linked by a strap of eight methylene groups, [M(BCP 8) ], can exist as either an αααα or αβαβ <b>atropisomer</b> depending {{on the nature of}} the coordinated metal cation. This remarkable conformational versatility was investigated by density-functional theory calculations for the d 5 chloroiron(III) complex in the low-spin and high-spin states and for the d 4 high-spin chloromanganese(III) complex. The lowest-lying electronic state of all of the conformers of the chloroiron(III) bridled chiroporphyrin is found to be the high-spin state. For the chloroiron(III) complex in the low-spin or the high-spin state and for the high-spin chloromanganese(III) complex, the most stable form is predicted to be the αααα conformer in which the chloride axial ligand is located within the cavity provided by the bridles. The predicted stereochemistries are compared with those similarly obtained (i) for the chloroiron(III) and chloromanganese(III) complexes of the tetramethylchiroporphyrin, which is devoid of straps, and (ii) for the d 10 zinc(II) and low-spin d 8 nickel(II) BCP 8 complexes, on the basis of the effects tied to the occupancy of the stereochemically active dx 2 −y 2 -type antibonding orbital level, to the restraints imposed by the straps, and to the presence of the axial chloride ligand...|$|E
