He was in favour of the Unionist Government's plans to look at introducing trade tariffs. He also opposed Home Rule for Ireland. Beckett's pro-protestant positions unsurprisingly won him the endorsement of the Whitby Protestant Electoral Council, who had sent questions to both candidates about issues of their concern. Both candidates replies were considered and the council favoured that of Beckett so much that they urged all Whitby's protestant voters to vote for and campaign for Beckett.|$|R
50|$|In Italy, {{much of the}} {{agricultural}} land was leased to tenants. There was a concept in place that allowed the tenants to have tenure on the land, {{even though they were}} not the owners. Tax liabilities went with the sales of a land plot, but most of the taxed public land in Italy was leased rather than owned. Therefore, many of the taxes were imposed upon the tenants rather than the land owners. These tenants could also sell and buy leases, which indicates a somewhat flexible and fair property system. According to the Roman courts, <b>agricultural</b> <b>tenants</b> also had rights against landowners who tried to unjustly infringe upon their contracts. This time period indicated a degree of fairness and justice toward the coloni.|$|R

5000|$|When the Agriculture Bill {{was before}} Parliament in 1920, Townley defended the {{inclusion}} of a clause giving compensation to <b>agricultural</b> <b>tenants</b> for disturbance by their landlords, arguing it would not harm any good landlord. He made it clear that his commitment to agriculture dominated other issues, joining a protest in July 1921 against the Government's Corn Production Acts (Repeal) Bill which removed subsidy. Townley asked rhetorically what the Government intended to do with ex-servicemen who had been encouraged to go into farming, and whether it was better [...] "to spend money on British agriculture than to seek to make Palestine a land fit for Hebrews to live in?" [...] He was within the mainstream of the Conservative Party in general, not joining with the right-wing in seeking to limit spending. He opposed making British Summer Time permanent.|$|R
5000|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, {{it was clear}} that the Agricultural Holdings Act 1986 was not working. The 1986 Act had given {{security}} to <b>agricultural</b> <b>tenants</b> and held down rents, and the effect on landlords was so onerous that the amount of farmland available to let in the UK was declining by more than 50,000 acres a year. [...] A loophole in the law was found that enabled landlords to avoid the security of tenure conferred by the 1986 Act (Gladstone v Bower agreements), and by 1994 more than 70% of new agricultural tenancies used this loophole. [...] This held down the term of an agricultural tenancy to less than two years. But most farmland that fell vacant was not available to let at all: the landlords were often hiring contractors to farm it for them, or entering into share farming or partnership arrangements, rather than letting to the small businessman farmer.|$|R

The estate was broken up and sold in 1937.

40|$|Few {{subjects}} {{connected with}} Irish land {{have been the}} cause of more discussion than the Tenant-right Custom of Ulster. For many years before 1870 a controversy was carried on {{with respect to the}} attributes of the custom, and whether it possessed sufficiently definite characteristics to warrant its statutory sanction. As everybody knows, Parliament, by the Land Act of 1870, ended the controversy by legalising the custom, and any discussion that has since taken place has mainly been concerned with the interpretation of the governing statutes. The Land Act of 1881 gave the rights of " free sale" and " fixity of tenure 2 Ì† 7, which the Ulster Custom, to a certain extent secured, to the <b>agricultural</b> <b>tenants</b> of all Ireland, and added the right to a " fair rent" which the Custom claimed, but had hitherto no satisfactory method of enforcing. It would be a mistake, however, to think that the existing Irish Land Code has obviated the necessity for preserving the Ulster Custom. Accordingly, to understand it aright and to give a proper interpretation to the statutes affecting it, we must make ourselves acquainted with its history and its attributes...|$|R

Konda Venkata Ranga Reddy belonging to moderates group having defeated the leftist leader Baddam Yella Reddy of Karimnagar district became the president of this conference. In the eleventh conference held at Bhuvanagiri in 1944 the communists dominated and their leader Raavi Narayan Reddy became the president. This Andhra Mahasabha attended by ten thousand people came under the control of communists. The communist leader Chandra Rajeshwar Rao addressed this eleventh session. This led to a split in the Mahasabha. Moderates like Konda Venkata Ranga Reddy and others formed a separate association called the Nationalist Andhra Mahasabha which held two sessions in 1945 and 1946. The last session of the Nationalist Andhra Mahasabha held at Kandi Village in Medak district in 1946 was presided over by Jamalapuram Keshava Rao.

I offered to keep a school at my own expense, solely on the understanding that what they call Dissenters should be allowed to come there. The parson spread abroad a rumor that I was an atheist, and consequently the School was kept for the Dissenters only. The School-board has come and made that all right, though the parson goes on with his rumor. If he understood me as well as I understand him, he would know that he is more of an atheist than I am. I gave my boys the best education, spending on them more than double what is done by men with twice my means. My tastes were all simple, and were not specially vicious. I do not know that I have ever made any one unhappy. Then the estate became richer, but Mountjoy grew more and more expensive.
