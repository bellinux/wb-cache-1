25|$|As I {{testified to}} the U.S. Senate in 1998, Iraq has the {{indigenous}} capability right now to reconstitute a chemical weapons program {{within a matter of}} weeks. And my concern is if we continue to push for military action against Iraq, and once the writing becomes clear on the wall -- <b>and</b> <b>believe</b> <b>me,</b> if Saddam Hussein doesn't understand that President Bush is dead serious about going to war against him now, I don't know when he'll be -- when he'll recognize that. But at some point, I believe that Iraq will seek to reconstitute militarized nerve agent that will be used in defense of Baghdad. And I think the Iraqi government's efforts to acquire significant stockpiles of atropine are an indication that this is the direction that Saddam Hussein is heading.|$|E

500|$|As in 2008, in 2012 Paul {{ultimately}} {{refused to}} endorse the ticket selected by the Republican Party. He {{said that there was}} no essential difference between Romney and his Democratic opponent, President Obama, on the most critical policies: [...] "I've been in this business a long time <b>and</b> <b>believe</b> <b>me</b> there is essentially no difference from one administration to another no matter what the platforms... The foreign policy stays the same, the monetary policy stays the same, there’s no proposal for any real cuts and both parties support it."

500|$|Georgia Tech coach John Heisman later {{described}} Strupper as follows:"Everett Strupper {{was a small}} {{package of}} condensed lightning when you turned him loose in an open field with a ball you wanted delivered somewhere {{in the neighborhood of}} the enemy's goal line. He was small, but he was put together like a high-powered motor. His arms and legs did just what his mind told them to do, <b>and,</b> <b>believe</b> <b>me,</b> his mind worked faster than Ty Cobb's when he's running the bases. Dodging and twisting, stiff-arming and hipping, he'd run the gauntlet of men big enough, you'd think, to pick him up and spank him, and most of the time, too, he'd get away from them, try as hard as they would." ...|$|E
500|$|Robinson's Hollywood exploits, however, did not {{sit well}} with Dodgers {{co-owner}} Walter O'Malley, who referred to Robinson as [...] "Rickey's prima donna". In late 1950, Rickey's contract as the Dodgers' team President expired. Weary of constant disagreements with O'Malley, and with no hope of being re-appointed as President of the Dodgers, Rickey cashed out his one-quarter financial interest in the team, leaving O'Malley in full control of the franchise. Rickey shortly thereafter became general manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates. Robinson was disappointed at the turn of events and wrote a sympathetic letter to Rickey, whom he considered a father figure, stating, [...] "Regardless of what happens to me in the future, it all can be placed on what you have done <b>and,</b> <b>believe</b> <b>me,</b> I appreciate it." ...|$|E

500|$|After Winehouse's death, {{according}} to Pete Doherty, he and Winehouse were lovers at one point, {{speaking to the}} Daily Mail about it he said [...] "This is {{difficult for me to}} admit. But, yes, it's true. Amy and I were lovers. I loved her then and, well, I still do today. But towards the end, as only lovers can, she became quite mean and cruel to me. She didn't suffer fools… <b>and</b> <b>believe</b> <b>me,</b> she had a mean right hook." [...] However, in July 2008, Rolling Stone reporter Claire Hoffman asked Winehouse about her relationship with Doherty. Winehouse replied: [...] "We're just good friends", and added: [...] "I asked Pete to do a concept EP, and he made this face, he looked at me like I'd pooed on the floor. He wouldn't do it. We're just really close".|$|E
500|$|Three {{weeks after}} his win at Belmont, Secretariat was shipped to Arlington Park for the Arlington Invitational. Laurin explained: [...] "Even before the Belmont, you remember, I said I really didn't know how I could give this horse a rest. He's so strong and full of energy. Well, {{this is only a}} week and a half after the Belmont, <b>and</b> <b>believe</b> <b>me</b> when I tell you, if I don't run this horse he's going to hurt himself in his stall. So we decided it would be nice to race him in Chicago to let the people in the Midwest have a chance to see him run." [...] The race was run at [...] miles with a purse of $125,000. The challengers were grouped as a single betting entry at 6–1: Secretariat was 1–20 (the legal minimum) and created a minus pool of $17,941.|$|E
500|$|Band {{originally}} planned {{to produce a}} sequel called Laserblast II, with production work to begin in August 1986 and a theatrical release expected to follow shortly thereafter. A tagline released for the film read, [...] "The ultimate alien weapon is back." [...] When plans for the sequel were announced, Atlanta-based film critic Scott Journal wrote, [...] "I {{am one of the}} few people in the world who saw the original <b>and,</b> <b>believe</b> <b>me,</b> it did not merit a followup." [...] However, Charles Band Productions fell into financial difficulties shortly after the production of Laserblast, and the project was eventually scrapped. However, the premise and elements of the abandoned sequel were later used in the 1988 Charles Band film, Deadly Weapon, which, like Laserblast, was about a bullied teenager who finds a powerful weapon and uses it to seek revenge against his enemies. Band continued to make films and eventually formed Empire Pictures.|$|E

500|$|López {{is perhaps}} best known for his role as the setup {{reliever}} for the Tigers during their 1984 championship season, when he finished with a 101 record, 14 saves, and a 2.94 ERA. López had a 10 record in both the 1984 American League Championship Series (ALCS) and 1984 World Series, and he did not give up an earned run in over six innings pitched that postseason. He faced seven batters in Game Five of the 1984 World Series, retiring them all. After the pitcher got out of two extra-inning jams to earn a 1984 ALCS win, Detroit manager Sparky Anderson said, [...] "Nothing surprises me about Lopez. I've had him for five years <b>and</b> <b>believe</b> <b>me,</b> there's nothing like him. He's got heart and there is none better. He's one of the all-time hearts." [...] While in Detroit, López had earned the nickname [...] "Señor Smoke", as he hailed from Mexico and threw a powerful fastball.|$|E
500|$|Another myth {{concerns}} Saul Bass, {{the graphic}} designer who created {{many of the}} title sequences of Hitchcock's films and storyboarded some of Psychos scenes, claiming he had directed the shower scene. This was refuted by several figures associated with the film, including Leigh, who stated: [...] "absolutely not! I have emphatically said this in any interview I've ever given. I've said it to his face in front of other people... I was in that shower for seven days, <b>and,</b> <b>believe</b> <b>me,</b> Alfred Hitchcock was right next to his camera {{for every one of}} those seventy-odd shots." [...] Hilton A. Green, the assistant director, also refutes Bass' claim: [...] "There is not a shot in that movie that I didn't roll the camera for. And I can tell you I never rolled the camera for Mr. Bass." [...] Roger Ebert, a longtime admirer of Hitchcock's work, summarily dismissed the rumor, stating, [...] "It seems unlikely that a perfectionist with an ego like Hitchcock's would let someone else direct such a scene." ...|$|E
500|$|The downtempo {{song was}} {{developed}} {{on the following}} day, with Madonna writing the lyrics and Leonard composing the melody. Named [...] "The Look of Love", the song contains the line [...] "No where to run, no place to hide. From the look of love, from the eyes of pride". Madonna {{was inspired by the}} look that actor James Stewart gave actress Grace Kelly in the 1954 film Rear Window. Madonna said: [...] "I can't describe it, but that is the way I want someone to look at me when he loves me. It's the most pure look of love and adoration. Like surrender. It's devastating." [...] After [...] "The Look of Love", Madonna went on to develop two further songs with Bray as the producer. The first was called [...] "Causing a Commotion", and was inspired by Penn and the couple's often tumultuous relationship. Madonna felt that her marriage to Penn {{was on the verge of}} breaking-up, due to Penn's abusive and violent nature. In a Rolling Stone article dated September 10, 1987, Madonna spoke about Penn's impact on her life and the song: [...] "I don't like violence. I never condone hitting anyone, and I never thought that any violence should have taken place. But on the other hand, I understood Sean's anger <b>and</b> <b>believe</b> <b>me,</b> I have wanted to hit him many times. I never would you know, because I realize that it would just make things worse. [...] I felt like he was 'Causing a Commotion' to purposefully distract me. I wrote this song and vented my frustration in it." [...] The last song developed was [...] "Can't Stop", a track inspired by Sixties Motown and the group Martha and the Vandellas. In addition to this, the album also included tracks by some acts on Warner Bros. Records, namely Club Nouveau, Scritti Politti and Michael Davidson. Commercially unsuccessful and unknown in the US, these groups needed a platform to project their songs, and including them in a Madonna album seemed like the right thing to do for Warner. Two tracks by Duncan Faure and Coati Mundi were included on the soundtrack at the request of Madonna since they were her friends. Despite her only performing four of the nine tracks on the album, Who's That Girl was marketed as a Madonna album, with only her face and name appearing on the cover art.|$|E

2500|$|The {{film was}} not storyboarded and was made without a shot list. The camp fire scene was {{originally}} a short, three-page scene that Phoenix re-wrote into an eight-page scene where Mike professes {{his love for}} Scott {{so that it was}} more apparent that his character was gay whereas Van Sant had originally made it more ambiguous. Reeves reportedly was not comfortable with this aspect of the film as he said in an interview, [...] "I'm not against gays or anything, but I won't have sex with guys. I would never do that on film. We did a little of it in Idaho <b>and,</b> <b>believe</b> <b>me,</b> it was hard work. Never again".|$|E

2500|$|Also {{significant}} was {{the theme}} of isolation and disconnection between the commuters. Despite the noticeable discomfort caused by the gas, most of the interviewees {{did not bother to}} ask other passengers what was going on, preferring to wait until the next stop to change trains and distance themselves from the situation.

Commuters, with a few notable exceptions, did not attempt to help them, instead waiting for employees whose authority allowed them to intervene.|$|E

2500|$|Film critics James Berardinelli and Roger Ebert each awarded it 3.5 stars out of {{a maximum}} of 4 stars.

[...] Bloody Disgusting ranked the film 16th in their list of the [...] "Top 20 Horror Films of the Decade", with the article saying, [...] "Peli deserves props for milking the maximum amount of tension out of the spare, modern setting—an ordinary, cookie-cutter tract home in San Diego. It doesn't sound very scary, but Peli manages to make it terrifying. If you aren't white-knuckling your armrest at least once or twice while watching it, you probably don't have a pulse." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rogers was {{outstanding}} among Astaire's partners {{not because}} she was superior to others as a dancer, but because, as a skilled, intuitive actress, she was cagey {{enough to realize that}} acting did not stop when dancing began... the reason so many women have fantasized about dancing with Fred Astaire is that Ginger Rogers conveyed the impression that dancing with him is the most thrilling experience imaginable.According to Astaire, [...] "Ginger had never danced with a partner before Flying Down to Rio. She faked it an awful lot. She couldn't tap and she couldn't do this and that... but Ginger had style and talent and improved as she went along. She got so that after a while everyone else who danced with me looked wrong." [...] In his book Ginger: Salute to a Star author Dick Richards quotes Astaire saying to Raymond Rohauer, curator of the New York Gallery of Modern Art, [...] "Ginger was brilliantly effective. She made everything work for her. Actually she made things very fine for both of us and she deserves most of the credit for our success." [...] When asked who his favorite dancing partner was by British TV interviewer Michael Parkinson on Parkinson in 1976, Astaire said [...] "Excuse me, I must say Ginger was certainly the one. You know, the most effective partner I had. Everyone knows. That was a whole other thing what we did...I just want to pay a tribute to Ginger because we did so many pictures together <b>and</b> <b>believe</b> <b>me</b> it was a value to have that girl...she had it!
