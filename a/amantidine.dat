40|$|ABSTRACT: Background: The {{glutamate}} {{system has}} been implicated in depression recently. This is a departure from previous thinking, which had focused on serotonin and norepinephrine. The glutamate system may represent {{a new avenue for}} treatment and research. NMDA and AMPA are receptors for the neurotransmitter glutamate. Blocking NMDA increases the activity of another receptor, AMPA, and this boost in AMPA activity is crucial for rapid antidepressant actions. <b>Amantidine</b> being a noncompetitive antagonist at NMDA receptor is evaluated for its antidepressant activity in this study. Objectives: To evaluate the antidepressant activity of <b>amantidine</b> and compare it with Imipramine in albino mice. Methodology: Total of 18 swiss albino male mice were used. They were divided into three treatment groups and with normal saline (control) 10 mg/kg, Imipramine (standard) 10 mg/kg and <b>amantidine</b> 26 mg/kg (test drug) given orally. Each group contained 6 animals. Duration of immobility was observed for 6 minutes in tail suspension test and for 4 minutes in forced swimming test on separate set of animals. Results: Results were analyzed by ANOVA followed by Post hoc Tukey’s test. <b>Amantidine</b> at the dose of 26 mg/kg significantly reduced the immobility time in both the tests compared to control (p < 0. 05). Conclusion: Non-competative antagonist, <b>amantidine</b> has significant antidepressant activity in acute models of depression. Key words: NMDA antagonists, <b>amantidine,</b> imipramin...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY The {{treatment}} of two cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease with <b>amantidine</b> is described. The first case made a remarkable initial improvement which was sustained for two months, but then deteriorated and died. Histological {{examination of the}} brain showed changes consistent with early Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The second case which was clinically one of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease has now been followed for 30 months {{since the start of}} treatment and appears to be cured. It is con-sidered that <b>amantidine</b> has a definite effect in this disease and it is suggested that its mode of action, though unknown, {{is more likely to be}} metabolic than antiviral. This paper presents two cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease which have responded to treatment with <b>amantidine</b> in this hospital since Septembe...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{threat of}} a catastrophic {{outbreak}} of influenza is ever present. Vaccines are only partially effective and the two compounds, <b>amantidine</b> and rimantidine, used clinically against influenza A cause side-effects and rapid viral resistance. Recent advances bring hope that specific and potent drugs against influenza may soon {{be available in the}} clinic. These compounds were designed to inhibit influenza neuraminidase (NA), one of the viral coat glycoproteins, using the crystal structure of NA which was first published in 1983. In this review, the application of structure-based drug design approaches to the design of anti-influenza agents targeted at NA and haemagglutinin (HA), the other viral surface glycoprotein, is discussed...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the final}} report of a one-year, Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) project at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). The {{objectives}} of this project were to develop models of the spread of pathogens, such as HIV- 1 and influenza, in humans, and then to use the models to address the possibility of designing appropriate drug therapies that may limit {{the ability of the}} pathogen to escape treatment by mutating into a drug resistant form. We have developed a model of drug-resistance to <b>amantidine</b> and rimantadine, the two major antiviral drugs used to treat influenza, and have used the model to suggest treatment strategies during an epidemic...|$|E
40|$|Parkinson's {{disease is}} a common {{disabling}} disease of old age. The diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease is based on clinical signs and has poor sensitivity, with about 25 % of patients confidently diagnosed as having the disease actually having other conditions such as multi-system atrophy and other parkinsonism-plus syndromes. Benign essential tremor and arteriosclerotic pseudo-parkinsonism can easily be confused with Parkinson's disease. The cause of Parkinson's disease remains unknown. Speculative research highlights the role of oxidative stress and free radical mediated damage to dopaminergic cells. Parkinson's disease is the one neurodegenerative disorder in which drugs have been demonstrated to be of value. There is now {{a wide variety of}} drugs and formulations available, including anticholinergics, <b>amantidine,</b> L-dopa, dopamine agonists including apomorphine, selegiline and soon to be available catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitors. Disabling side-effects of treatment, fluctuations, dyskinesias and psychiatric problems require strategic use of the drugs available. There is an increasing potential for neurosurgical intervention...|$|E
40|$|Levodopa is {{the most}} {{effective}} symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease. However, after an initial period of dramatic benefit, several limitations become apparent including, "dopa resistant" motor symptoms (postural abnormalities, freezing episodes, speech impairment), "dopa resistant" non-motor signs (autonomic dysfunction, mood and cognitive impairment, etc), and/or drug related side effects (especially psychosis, motor fluctuations, and dyskinesias). Motor complications include fluctuations, dyskinesias, and dystonias. They can be very disabling and difficult to treat. Therefore, strategies should ideally be developed to prevent them. Though mechanisms underlying motor complications are only partially understood, recent work has revealed the importance of pulsatile stimulation of postsynaptic dopamine receptors and the disease severity. As a result of intermittent stimulation there occurs a cascade of changes in cell signalling leading to upregulation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate subtype of gamma-aminobutryric acid-ergic neurones. Modified preparations of levodopa (controlled release preparations, liquid levodopa), catecholamine-o-methyltransferase inhibitors, dopamine agonists, <b>amantidine,</b> and various neurosurgical approaches have been used in the prevention and/or treatment of motor complications. Current management of motor complications is less than satisfactory. With better understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms, it is hoped that future therapeutic strategies will provide a safer and targeted treatment...|$|E
40|$|Cells {{were labeled}} using the {{following}} antibodies: For detection of influenza A virus infection anti-H 1 N 1 FITC (ABR) or anti-M 2 (ABR) antibodies were used. For apoptosis detection 7 -Aminoactinomycin D (7 -AAD) (BD) and Annexin V-APC (BD) staining was done using BD Annexin V binding buffer. Acquisition was performed within the hour following the staining, on a BD FACSCanto Flow Cytometer. Analysis was performed using the FlowJo software. Inhibitors, Synthetic Peptides and Cytokines Chloroquine and <b>amantidine</b> were purchased from Sigma, St. Louis, MO. Expression Plasmids and Lentiviral Constructs The cDNA of human MAP 1 LC 3 B sequence (NM_ 022818) was PCR-amplified from a human B-LCL by RT-PCR with gene specific primers and cloned into the multiple cloning site of the mammalian expression vector pEGFP-C 2 (Clontech). The mRFP-GFP-LC 3 encoding expression vector {{was a gift from}} Dr. Tamotsu Yoshimori, Osaka, Japan. For the expression of individual viral proteins pCAGGS vectors containing influenza A/WSN/ 33 matrix protein 1 (M 1), matrix protein 2 (M 2), NP, NS 1, PB 2 and HA were used. The M 2 and NP constructs contain a FLAG tag at their C terminus. siRNA-Mediated Gene Silencing For delivery of siRNAs into epithelial cell lines, siRNAs were transfected with lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), using 200 pmol siRNA + 7 �μl lipofectamine/well in a 6 -well format. 18 hours after the transfection, cells were infected and analyzed after 24 hours. M 2 knockdown efficiency was analyzed by flow cytometric analysis, using the M 2 -E 10 antibody, and by Western blot analysis using the M 2 14 -C 2 antibody. The Atg 12 specific siRNA was purchased from Dharmacon composed of Atg 12 sense 5 ’...|$|E
40|$|Type 1 {{cannabinoid}} receptors (CB 1 R) have a {{well established}} role in modulating GABAergic signalling {{with the central}} nervous system, and {{are thought to be}} the only type present at GABAergic presynaptic terminals. In the medial entorhinal cortex (mEC), some cortical layers show high levels of ongoing GABAergic signalling (namely layer II) while others show relatively low levels (layer V). Using whole-cell patch clamp techniques, I have, for the first time, demonstrated the presence of functional CB 1 R in both deep and superficial layers of the mEC. Furthermore, using a range of highly specific ligands for both CB 1 R and CB 2 R, I present strong pharmacological evidence for CB 2 Rs being present in both deep and superficial layers of the mEC in the adult rat brain. In brain slices taken at earlier points in CNS development (P 8 - 12), I have shown that while both CB 1 R and CB 2 R specific ligands do modulate GABAergic signalling at early developmental stages, antagonists/ inverse agonists and full agonists have similar effects, and serve only to reduce GABAergic signalling. These data suggest that the full cannabinoid signalling mechanisms at this early stage in synaptogenesis are not yet in place. During these whole-cell studies, I have developed and refined a novel recording technique, using an <b>amantidine</b> derivative (IEM 1460) which allows inhibitory postsynaptic currents to be recorded under conditions in which glutamate receptors are not blocked and network activity remains high. Finally I have shown that bath applied CB 1 and CB 2 receptor antagonists/ inverse agonists are capable of modulating kainic acid induced persistent oscillatory activity in mEC. Inverse agonists suppressed oscillatory activity in the superficial layers of the mEC while it was enhanced in the deeper layers. It seems likely that cannabinoid receptors modulate the inhibitory neuronal activity that underlies network oscillations. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
