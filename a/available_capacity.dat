25|$|Battery life (and its synonym battery lifetime) has two {{meanings}} for {{rechargeable batteries}} {{but only one}} for non-chargeables. For rechargeables, it can mean either {{the length of time}} a device can run on a fully charged battery or the number of charge/discharge cycles possible before the cells fail to operate satisfactorily. For a non-rechargeable these two lives are equal since the cells last for only one cycle by definition. (The term shelf life is used to describe how long a battery will retain its performance between manufacture and use.) <b>Available</b> <b>capacity</b> of all batteries drops with decreasing temperature. In contrast to most of today's batteries, the Zamboni pile, invented in 1812, offers a very long service life without refurbishment or recharge, although it supplies current only in the nanoamp range. The Oxford Electric Bell has been ringing almost continuously since 1840 on its original pair of batteries, thought to be Zamboni piles.|$|E

500|$|The cruiser Bayan (Russian: Баян) was {{the name}} ship of the four [...] {{armoured}} cruisers built for the Imperial Russian Navy {{in the first decade}} of the 20th century. The ship had to be built in France because there was no <b>available</b> <b>capacity</b> in Russia. Bayan was assigned to the First Pacific Squadron after completion and based at Port Arthur from the end of 1903. She suffered minor damage during the Battle of Port Arthur at the beginning of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05 and supported destroyers as they patrolled outside the harbour. After bombarding Japanese positions in July 1904, the ship struck a mine and was out of action for the next several months. Bayan was sunk during the Siege of Port Arthur and was then salvaged by the Japanese after the war.|$|E
500|$|By early 1939 it {{was clear}} that the first two s could not be {{delivered}} before 1943 at the earliest and that further battleship construction would be necessary to match the German and Japanese battleships already under construction. The main constraint on the construction of any new battleships was the limited <b>available</b> <b>capacity</b> and the time required to build large-calibre guns and their gun turrets. Using four existing twin 15-inch mountings offered the possibility of bypassing this bottleneck and allowed the construction of a single fast battleship more quickly than building more Lion-class ships. The turrets were originally built for the battlecruisers [...] and [...] during the First World War, and were removed during the conversions of these ships to aircraft carriers in the 1920s. To save time, the Lion design was modified to accommodate the four turrets, and preliminary design work began in July 1939. The square or transom stern was retained as it was estimated to improve speed at full power by [...] This made Vanguard the only British battleship built with a transom stern as the Lions were never finished.|$|E
500|$|Arsenal fans often {{refer to}} {{themselves}} as [...] "Gooners", the name derived from the team's nickname, [...] "The Gunners". The fanbase is large and generally loyal, and virtually all home matches sell out; in 2007–08 Arsenal had the second-highest average League attendance for an English club (60,070, which was 99.5% of <b>available</b> <b>capacity),</b> and, as of 2015, the third-highest all-time average attendance. Arsenal have the seventh highest average attendance of European football clubs only behind Borussia Dortmund, FC Barcelona, Manchester United, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, and Schalke. The club's location, adjoining wealthy areas such as Canonbury and Barnsbury, mixed areas such as Islington, Holloway, Highbury, and the adjacent London Borough of Camden, and largely working-class areas such as Finsbury Park and Stoke Newington, has meant that Arsenal's supporters {{have come from a}} variety of social classes. Much of the Afro-Caribbean support comes from the neighbouring London Borough of Hackney and {{a large portion of the}} South Asian Arsenal supporters commute to the stadium from Wembley Park, North West of the capital. There was also traditionally a large Irish community that followed Arsenal, with the nearby Archway area having a particularly large community, but Irish migration to North London is much lower than in the 1960s or 1970s.|$|E
40|$|We {{developed}} a diffusive load balancing scheme that equalizes the <b>available</b> <b>capacities</b> of nodes in a peer-to-peer (P 2 P) system. These nodes {{may have different}} resource capacities, geographic locations, or availabilities (i. e., length of time {{being part of the}} peer-to-peer system). The services on these nodes may have different service times and arrival rates of requests. Using the diffusive scheme, the system is able to maintain similar response times for its services. Our scheme is a modification of the diffusive load balancing algorithms proposed for parallel computing systems. This scheme is able to handle services with heterogeneous resource requirements and P 2 P nodes with heterogeneous capacities. We also adapted the diffusive scheme to clustered peer-to-peer system, where a load balancing operation may move services or nodes between clusters. After a literature survey of this field, this thesis investigates the following issues using analytical reasoning and extensive simulation studies. The load balancing operations equalize the <b>available</b> <b>capacities</b> of the nodes in a neighborhood to their averages. As a result, the <b>available</b> <b>capacities</b> of all nodes in the P 2 P system converge to a global average. We found that this convergence is faster when the scheme use...|$|R

2500|$|Not until 1936 did the Dutch {{government}} {{recognize the}} growing threat of Nazi Germany, but the resultant budget increases {{were too small}} and too late to establish an effective defense of the country. [...] One factor was practical: by that time, many European countries were rearming and had already placed orders taxing the <b>available</b> <b>capacity</b> of munitions plants, hindering Dutch efforts at procurement. [...] A second factor was continued economic pressure, as Defense Minister Adriaan Dijxhoorn refused to authorize funds for modernizing both main Dutch lines of defense against attack from the east, the Waterline and the Grebbeline. [...] The failure of General Izaak H. Reijnders, leader of the Dutch General Staff, to obtain more funding for these lines led to his replacement on February 6, 1940 by General Henri Winkelman, who opted to concentrate on modernizing the Grebbeline, with its largely wooden bunkers, because German artillery brought up as deep within the country as the Waterline would be within range of Amsterdam. [...] Modernization of the Grebbeline, however, would not be complete or effective {{by the time of}} the invasion, in part because the government balked at the expense of clearing forests and houses blocking lines of sight from many of the fortifications.|$|E

2500|$|Traffic {{congestion}} {{problems on the}} roadways, as with elsewhere in Southern California, {{is the result of}} the demand for driving exceeding the <b>available</b> <b>capacity,</b> especially on area freeways. Many of the existing freeways were completed in the late 1970s, with the exception of the segment of the Foothill Freeway, State Route 210 (SR 210) between San Dimas and San Bernardino completed in July 2007. New freeways or highways [...] "fix-ups" [...] are being planned, such as the expansion of the length of the 215 freeway around Inland Center Mall. However, other problems exist, one being the jobs vs. housing imbalance. The Inland Empire population grew as a result of affordable housing, at least relative to the rest of Southern California. But most of the higher paying jobs are located in Los Angeles, San Diego and Orange counties. Thus, many workers must drive daily from the Inland Empire to their jobs in these counties -sometimes up to two hours each direction, and even longer if by public transportation. As the population increases, the problem is most certainly going to get worse. Forbes magazine recently ranked the area first in its list of most unhealthy commutes in the United States, beating out every other metropolitan area in the country, as Inland area drivers breathe the unhealthiest air and have the highest rate of fatal auto accidents per capita.|$|E
