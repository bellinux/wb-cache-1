However, such practice and the underlying assumed principles are often hidden from the learner's vision, and are therefore difficult to evaluate. Social interactions with others stimulate the learner to re-asses and reflect {{on the nature of the}} learner's own behaviour and practice, such as in professional networking contexts and intercultural encounters. This paper describes the prerequisites of learning from these interactions and the possibilities of technological support. It presents one approach to providing support for developing the required skills, with the example of the CEFcult tool, which supports intercultural communicative competence building. Part of the research described in this article has been conducted within the CEFCult project, which runs from November 2009 until October 2011.

Available at [URL] Networks are online social networks through which partici- pants share knowledge {{with each other and}} jointly develop new knowledge. The ultimate goals are to enrich the experience of formal, school-based learning as well as to form a viable setting for professional development. In order to attain these goals, however, participants should be aware of each other‟s existence in the first place. This paper introduces a case study of a Learning Network: eT- winning, a European network of teachers who exchange their experiences and seek collaboration. Based on multiple sources, a picture of the current state of mutual awareness and sense of connectedness in the eTwinning network is painted. The network proves to be divided. On the one hand there is a strong core group, which feels connected and is clearly aware of each other. On the other hand there are many participants who seem to be isolated. To engage this second group, this paper suggests the use of a peer-support mechanism called Ad Hoc Transient Groups (AHTGs). Through AHTGs participants who have a question can be connected to and helped by other members with relevant ex- perience in the area. Finally the paper presents new areas of research in Learn- ing Networks, particularly the design of a service that aims to encourage par- ticipants to grasp the value and opportunities offered by their Personal Learning Networks for their own professional activities and professional development...|$|R

40|$|Summary. Though the {{transitional}} members between the pyralspite and grandite series occur only very sporadically, there exists under favourable conditions a perfect miscibility between grossular {{on the one}} hand, and spessartine oralmandine or pyrope on the other. The conditions favouring this miscibility are discussed. B ASED on all the garnet analyses available, Boeke constructed in the year 1914 a diagram showing the participation of different end-members {{in the composition of}} garnets. In this diagram a broad gap is visible between the grossular-andradite and the pyropc-alman-dine-spessartine s ries pointing to a restricted miscibility between these series. Pyralspites with a grandite content of more than 35 tool. ~o and grandites having more than 35 tool. ~o pyralspite were not en-countered. Since then, however, as garnet analyses grew in number, garnets have been found falling in this composition gap. Nowadays it may be said that there exist, even if only under special conditions, con-tinuous transitional series to grossular from spessartine or almandine as well as from pyrope. The number of such garnet analyses, though not considerable (about 2 ~o of all published garnet analyses), enables us to reach some conclusions on the conditions of the origin of these garnets with unusual composition, which is the object of the present paper. Table I lists all the reliable analyses taken from the literature acces-sible to the present author concerning <b>arnets,</b> the calcium component of which fails within the limits of 35 and 65 tool. ~o together with reealculations to molecular percentages of the end-members. Garnets displaying unusual constituents, such as calderite, blythite, and others were not included. The description of the occurrences of the garnets under consideration follows the sequence of facies they belong to. The pyroxene-hornfelsfaeies. From the Victory mine, Gabbs, Nevada, Lee (1962) published data on garnets (nos. 1 to 3) with dominant grossular and spessartine; these garnets occur in a rock designated by 390 D. NEMEC ON o...|$|R
