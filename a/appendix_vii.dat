5000|$|The {{crossing}} of trains was generally avoided {{due to a}} lack of appropriate crossing facilities. Only on special occasions, such as holiday periods, trains were timed to cross. For example; on 24 December 1927, the 10.20 Warrnambool passenger service, due at South Geelong at 12.03, was due to cross the 09.35 passenger train from Camperdown, due at 12.02, and had to [...] "wait for P3", P3 being the Warrnambool service. The train was then to wait on the Queenscliff branch line, subject to Rule 15 of <b>Appendix</b> <b>VII,</b> of the Book of Rules and Regulations. Therefore, the train, which had to wait, stood at the up home signal. This also prevented South Geelong giving Drysdale an electric staff for trains to approach, while a train waited for a cross, or shunting trains onto the branch line, while another train was approaching. Eventually, on 1 June 1931, passenger trains ceased on the Queenscliff line, and a week later, the Miniature Electric Staff was abolished. Drysdale was abolished as a staff station, and Staff and Ticket was re-introduced between South Geelong and Queenscliff.|$|E

However, interpreting these trends is confounded {{by a lack of}} information regarding the relationship between counts and habitat. Therefore, I assessed the relationship between woodcock counts and land-cover composition along survey routes using an Information-Theoretic modeling framework. The amount of early successional forest, open space, and a landscape metric Interspersion and Juxtaposition Index (IJI) best explained counts in Wisconsin; in Minnesota, the amount of mature forest, water and models that included open space, wetlands, and early successional forest together best explained counts. These results are, in general, consistent with woodcock-habitat relations described in published literature, and suggest that woodcock counts along SGS survey routes in Minnesota and Wisconsin reflect the amount and composition of land cover along routes, especially the amount and juxtaposition of early successional forest and open space, which were the variables included in competing models for both states.

40|$|This work {{deal with}} the design of {{distributed}} video surveillance system. Our purpose is to realize an embedded video surveillance system capable of video streaming back to a remote server, detecting and tracking any moving object using pan-tilt cameras. The constructed system should be perfectly monitorable from the remote server. We can {{say that we have}} achieved this goal by using embedded technology, socket programing, computer vision resources (algorithms) and distributed system design method. The algorithm used for detection is a background subtraction technique namely temporal frame difference. To be able to locate and track the detected object we made use of camshift algorithm. The built system is composed of four client boards and one server PC. Client’s subsystem is based on an embedded processor (Beagleboard xM) and an embedded microcontroller (MSP 430 F 5438). A pan-tilt camera is also part of each client’s subsystem. From the remote server we make use of one two or three cameras to detect and track the same target. We also can form tracking groups each composed of two cameras to track the two different targets. So, the four cameras are considered as a compound eye of our surveillance system. The major contribution of this work is without doubt the cooperative tracking technique we have implemented. In fact, by using a leader election algorithm, we elect a leader. This leader will then select it direct neighbors (followers) and get them involved in the tracking process. With this approach we get a good cooperative tracking results. Moreover the pan–tilt system automation provide a multi-view of the monitoring scene. At last the embedded technology devices we chose give our system good computation capabilities, mobility and real-time ability.

From a business perspective, the front offices managing Major League Baseball teams are now utilizing and sifting through big data to find hidden value in player assets. This information is then organized into complex information systems to assist in decision making. In the past, Major League Baseball had conducted business in a very traditional manner, with general managers, scouts, and coaches relying on their “baseball instincts,” which have been acquired through spending years in the game. However, baseball’s sacred fraternity, which had been often restricted to baseball lifers or former players, has now found a place for analytically minded individuals. This has completely changed the strategy of the business and the game itself. The thesis is structured into seven sections: (I.) Overview/Introduction, (II.) “What exactly are analytics and how are they used?”, (III.) “How is information used for analytics collected, stored, and used?”, (IV.) “What MLB teams are buying in and which aren’t?

The western river steamboat contained the technology that transformed the trans-Appalachian West from a wilderness to an economically significant region of the country. The following study explores the origin and development of this important steamboat type by analyzing archaeological data and historic sources. This information is used to create a thorough study of steamboat construction and machinery. The first steamboat on the western rivers was built by Robert Fulton in 1811. In the next decade many steamboats followed, but these vessels were not well-adapted to the shallow and swift rivers. Typically these steamboats had deep-drafted, stoutly constructed hulls, heavy low-pressure condensing engines, and many other features akin to ocean-going watercraft. In the 1820 s, shipwrights began to adapt steamboat hull form and machinery to the river conditions. By the close of this decade the high-pressure engine was universally adopted for use on western steamboats because of its power, light weight, low cost, and ease of repair. Advancements in propulsion machinery were paralleled by the construction of shallow, flat-bottomed hulls and multiple decks rising high above the waterline. In the late 1830 s or early 1840 s, the construction of steamboats was materially advanced with the invention of hogging chains. These long iron rods prevented steamboat hulls from hogging or sagging, thereby allowing shipwrights to build vessels with lighter timbers, further reducing vessel draft. The first section of this thesis introduces the reader to the subject and outlines the sources consulted for this study, while Sections II and III present the historic context necessary for understanding the western river steamboat's historic importance. Sections IV through VI contain a detailed analysis of steamboat structure and machinery divided into chronological periods. Conclusions are presented in Section <b>VII.</b> <b>Appendices</b> include a table quantifying steamboat construction on western rivers and a table of measurements from steamboats that plied the Ohio River in 1850...|$|R

40|$|Understorey {{vegetation}} {{could have}} significant impacts on forest regeneration. This research aims {{to understand the}} gap phase regeneration in lowland rainforests in Nanjenshan and the growing strategies of a dominant understory species: Schizostachyum diffusum (climbing bamboo). There are two objectives. The first objective is to understand the canopy closure patterns for different sized-gaps in the study area. The second objective is to understand the distribution features of the climbing bamboo. First, current canopy species and functional composition, canopy height and forest structure were investigated {{to find out how}} the recovery and regeneration process varies among different sized-gaps. Second, light quantity and climbing bamboo coverage were recorded across the study area. Density and abundance of the climbing bamboo were also measured, in order to know the distribution pattern and growth strategies of the dominant understorey. The results of the first part showed that in Nanjenshan, gaps are mostly closed by extended branches from pre-existed tree individuals. The regeneration patterns for the small gaps are similar to quadrats under intact forests. The second part showed that climbing bamboo is more or less evenly distributed in the study area and there is only a weak positive correlation between climbing bamboo coverage and canopy openness. Therefore, I concluded that the climbing bamboo behaves more like a shade tolerant species rather than pioneer species, which is different from previous studies. However, the number of culms (basal branches) of the climbing bamboo is significantly higher in large-sized-gaps. Therefore, the climbing bamboo may possibly inhibit gap-phase regeneration, especially in large-sized-gaps. Further study should focus on monitoring on how those large-sized gaps can recover in the long run. 地被植物在林隙更新扮演重要角色。本研究目的為了解南仁山熱帶雨林林隙更新模式與地被植物莎勒竹之生長策略。本研究有兩大主題。第一旨在了解不同大小林隙之更新模式；第二則欲探討莎勒竹之分布方式。第一個研究主題中，我調查冠層樹種高度及森林組成結構；在第二個主題我則調查光量與莎勒竹覆蓋度之相關性，並測量其密度及豐富度。第一部分結果顯示南仁山林隙的關閉大多來自鄰近樹冠枝條延伸，且不同大小林隙有不同特性樹種更新；第二部分結果顯示光量與莎勒竹覆蓋度呈現低度正相關，且不同大小林隙中之莎勒竹叢數無顯著差異；但分枝數則有顯著差異。因此本研究結論為莎勒竹之特性較偏向耐陰樹種，且具有延遲林隙更新的潛力，尤其是在較大林隙之中。Acknowledgements [...] . i Abstract [...] . ii Abstract (Chinese) [...] . iii Contents [...] . iv List of Figures [...] . vi List of Tables [...] . <b>vii</b> List of <b>Appendixes</b> [...] . <b>vii</b> 1.

40|$|On July 13, 2010, the White House {{released}} the National HIV/AIDS Strategy (NHAS). This ambitious {{plan is the}} nation's first-ever comprehensive coordinated HIV/AIDS roadmap with clear and measurable targets. It is also a new attempt to set clear priorities and provide leadership for all public and private stakeholders to align their efforts toward a common purpose. The goals of NHAS are to: Reduce new HIV infections; Increase access to care and improve health outcomes for people living with HIV; and Reduce HIV-related health disparities. To address {{the challenges of the}} epidemic and maximize the effectiveness of current HIV prevention methods, CDC's Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention (DHAP) pursues a High-Impact Prevention (HIP) approach. This approach uses combinations of scientifically proven, cost-effective, and scalable interventions targeted to populations in geographic areas most affected by the epidemic, and promises to greatly increase the impact of HIV prevention efforts. CDC also acknowledges that strengthening our work in HIV testing, linkage, and care will be essential to achieving the goals of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy. This guidance for HIV planning defines CDC's expectations of health departments and HIV planning groups (HPGs) in implementing HIV prevention planning. The HPG is the official HIV planning body that follows the HIV Planning Guidance to inform the development or update of the health department's Jurisdictional HIV Prevention Plan, which depicts how HIV infection will be reduced in the jurisdiction. HIV planning is a required and essential component of a comprehensive HIV prevention program, as outlined in Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) PS 12 - 1201, Comprehensive HIV Prevention Programs for Health Departments (2012 - 2016). CDC is committed to supporting HIV planning, including significant community involvement, scientific basis of program decisions, and targeting resources to have the greatest effect on HIV acquisition and transmission.
