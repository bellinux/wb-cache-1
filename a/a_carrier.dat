50|$|In telecommunications, {{interconnection}} is {{the physical}} linking of <b>a</b> <b>carrier's</b> network with equipment or facilities not belonging to that network.

50|$|<b>A</b> light {{aircraft}} <b>carrier,</b> or light fleet <b>carrier,</b> is <b>an</b> aircraft <b>carrier</b> that {{is smaller than}} the standard <b>carriers</b> of <b>a</b> navy. The precise definition of the type varies by country; light <b>carriers</b> typically have <b>a</b> complement of aircraft only one-half to two-thirds the size of <b>a</b> full-sized fleet <b>carrier.</b> <b>A</b> light <b>carrier</b> was similar in concept to <b>an</b> escort <b>carrier</b> in most respects, however light carriers were intended for higher speeds to be deployed alongside fleet carriers, while escort carriers usually defended convoys and provided air support during amphibious operations.|$|R
5|$|By early 1943, with Radford's {{training}} programs established and functioning efficiently, he sought combat duty. In April of that year, {{he was ordered}} to report to the office of Commander, Naval Air Forces, Pacific Fleet where he was promoted to rear admiral and tapped to be <b>a</b> <b>carrier</b> division commander. This was an unusual appointment, as most carrier division commanders were appointed only after duty commanding a capital ship. He then spent May and June 1943 on an inspection party under Gates, touring U.S. bases in the south Pacific. Following this, he was assigned under Rear Admiral Frederick C. Sherman, commander of Carrier Division 2 at Pearl Harbor. Radford spent several weeks observing flight operations and carrier tactics for various ships operating out of Hawaii. He was particularly impressed with how carrier doctrine had evolved in the time since his own assignment on <b>a</b> <b>carrier,</b> and in June 1943, {{he was ordered to}} observe operations on the light aircraft carrier , learning the unique challenges of using light carriers.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{nanotechnology}} {{uses the}} unique molecular recognition properties of DNA and other nucleic acids to create self-assembling branched DNA complexes with useful properties. DNA is thus {{used as a}} structural material rather than as <b>a</b> <b>carrier</b> of biological information. This {{has led to the}} creation of two-dimensional periodic lattices (both tile-based and using the DNA origami method) and three-dimensional structures in the shapes of polyhedra. Nanomechanical devices and algorithmic self-assembly have also been demonstrated, and these DNA structures have been used to template the arrangement of other molecules such as gold nanoparticles and streptavidin proteins.|$|E

Gabrielle, afraid of him, gives him her money and lies to the agents about his location {{when they come to}} see her. In actuality, Eladio has returned to the camp where Maria died, where Lozano tries to spur Soledad on in killing his brother. Soledad finds he can't do it, and Lozano struggles with him, being accidentally killed when the gun goes off. Soledad becomes <b>a</b> <b>carrier</b> of the fungal growth himself and flees with Eladio towards Mexico.|$|E
40|$|This study {{seeks to}} measure the safety {{performance}} of compliance reviews (CRs) conducted in Minnesota under the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program (MCSAP). This study employs data gathered by the Federal Highway Administration surrounding two MCSAP activities: compliance reviews and roadside inspections. It specifically investigates the change in <b>a</b> <b>carrier's</b> annual out-of-service violation rate (OOS) in response to receiving a review or a higher number of inspections. A measurable reduction in <b>a</b> <b>carrier's</b> OOS rate occurs in the year after a CR, according to the data.

5|$|Francium coprecipitates {{with several}} caesium salts, such as caesium perchlorate, {{which results in}} small amounts of {{francium}} perchlorate. This coprecipitation {{can be used to}} isolate francium, by adapting the radiocaesium coprecipitation method of Lawrence E. Glendenin and Nelson. It will additionally coprecipitate with many other caesium salts, including the iodate, the picrate, the tartrate (also rubidium tartrate), the chloroplatinate, and the silicotungstate. It also coprecipitates with silicotungstic acid, and with perchloric acid, without another alkali metal as <b>a</b> <b>carrier,</b> which provides other methods of separation. Nearly all francium salts are water-soluble.|$|E
5|$|In December 1940, British Commonwealth forces began counter-{{offensive}}s against Italian {{forces in}} Egypt and Italian East Africa. The offensive in North Africa was highly successful and by early February 1941 Italy had {{lost control of}} eastern Libya and large numbers of Italian troops had been taken prisoner. The Italian Navy also suffered significant defeats, with the Royal Navy putting three Italian battleships out of commission by <b>a</b> <b>carrier</b> attack at Taranto, and neutralising several more warships at the Battle of Cape Matapan.|$|E
5|$|LDLR {{mutations}} {{are more}} common in certain populations, presumably because of a genetic phenomenon known as the founder effect—they were founded by {{a small group of}} individuals, one or several of whom was <b>a</b> <b>carrier</b> of the mutation.

5|$|Less {{reactive}} than iodine, astatine is {{the least}} reactive of the halogens, although its compounds have been synthesized in microscopic amounts and studied as intensively as possible before their radioactive disintegration. The reactions involved have been typically tested with dilute solutions of astatine mixed with larger amounts of iodine. Acting as <b>a</b> <b>carrier,</b> the iodine ensures there is sufficient material for laboratory techniques (such as filtration and precipitation) to work. Like iodine, astatine {{has been shown to}} adopt odd-numbered oxidation states ranging from −1 to +7.|$|E

During lobster season, which runs from 15 March to 30 June, North Island's camp {{is occupied by}} about 130 fishers.

5|$|One central {{coenzyme}} is {{adenosine triphosphate}} (ATP), the universal energy currency of cells. This nucleotide {{is used to}} transfer chemical energy between different chemical reactions. There {{is only a small}} amount of ATP in cells, but as it is continuously regenerated, the human body can use about its own weight in ATP per day. ATP acts as a bridge between catabolism and anabolism. Catabolism breaks down molecules, and anabolism puts them together. Catabolic reactions generate ATP, and anabolic reactions consume it. It also serves as <b>a</b> <b>carrier</b> of phosphate groups in phosphorylation reactions.|$|E

5|$|The Australian Cattle Dog {{is one of}} the dog breeds {{affected}} by progressive retinal atrophy.

5|$|The Sea Dart {{began as}} Convair's entry in a 1948 U.S. Navy contest for a {{supersonic}} interceptor aircraft. During the time, {{there was much}} skepticism about operating supersonic aircraft from carrier decks. So {{in order to address}} this issue, U.S. Navy ordered many subsonic fighters. The worry had some foundation, since many supersonic designs of the time required long takeoff rolls, had high approach speeds, and were not very stable or easy to control—all factors that were troublesome on <b>a</b> <b>carrier.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} {{formed the}} nucleus of the Multinational Force Haiti (MNF Haiti) and Joint Task Force 190 (JTF 190) in Haiti during Operation Uphold Democracy. More than 8,600 of the division's troops deployed during this operation. On 19 September 1994, the 1st Brigade conducted the Army's first air assault from aircraft carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower. This force consisted of 54 helicopters and almost 2,000 soldiers. They occupied the Port-au-Prince International Airport.
