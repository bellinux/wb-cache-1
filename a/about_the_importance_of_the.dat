5|$|After a {{conversion}} {{by his mother}} Mary and older sister Susannah in 1798, all of Hinde's family, including his father, converted to Christianity as Methodists. Thomas delayed a while. Shortly afterward the younger Hinde became close friends with Francis Asbury, who became a prominent bishop in the church. Hinde later described the conversion of his youngest sister, Martha Harrison Hinde, in an 1827 article published in the Methodist Review under his pen name, Theophilus Arminius. Hinde recounted Bishop Asbury visiting his father's home in 1803 and telling Martha that she had better find God, because before he could meet her again she would be dead. The bishop's prophecy came true when Martha died in 1811 without having seen Asbury again. Hinde said she had converted before her death and tried to convert the nonbelievers in the room while on her deathbed. He shared a letter in which his sister had tried to convert her close friends. Hinde named his first daughter after his late sister Martha. Hinde did not immediately convert but attended Methodist camp meetings of the period. During his life, he frequently wrote <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> camp meeting in bringing Christianity and democracy to the west.|$|E
40|$|Sustainable {{corporate}} performance (SCP) requires balancing a corporation's economic, {{social, and}} environmental performance. This research explores values, beliefs <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> SCP, and buying behaviors of supermarket customers from within a stakeholder framework. Beliefs <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> SCP (both social and environmental, but not economic) {{were found to}} be related to values. Also, it was found that customers' environmentally responsible buying behaviors were related to their beliefs <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> environmental SCR However their socially responsible buying was not related to their beliefs <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> social SCP. Responsible buying behavior may be facilitated by providing reliable information about environmental and social aspects of products. Marketing professionals have a central role to play in moving towards a greater level of corporate transparency and sustainability. (C) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R

5|$|Natural gas {{was first}} found in Indiana in 1876 {{but it was}} not until 1886 that the {{magnitude}} of the discovery was known; the Trenton Gas Field was the largest deposit of natural gas discovered in the 19th century and the first giant oil reserve found in the United States. As a professor at a university in the Trenton Field, Haynes offered his services to the drillers and worked to analyze soil samples, determine well pressure, and give estimates on the amount of energy that could be created by the gas. He delivered several lectures to large crowds <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gas discovery and the many possible applications of this new source of fuel. He began a petition to have the local citizens create a corporation to pump the fuel from the ground and pipe it to area homes and businesses. His promotion was successful and Portland Natural Gas and Oil Company was formed; Haynes' father was named to the new company's board of directors.|$|E

500|$|In the 1940s, Marjory Stoneman Douglas, a {{freelance}} writer and former reporter for The Miami Herald, [...] began to research the Everglades for an assignment about the Miami River. She studied the land and water for five years, and published [...] in 1947, describing the area in great detail, including a chapter on its disappearance. She wrote: [...] "What had been a river of grass and sweet water that had given meaning and life and uniqueness to this enormous geography through centuries in which man had no place here was made, in one chaotic gesture of greed and ignorance and folly, a river of fire." [...] The book has sold 500,000 copies since its publication, and Douglas' continued dedication to ecology conservation earned her the nicknames [...] "Grand Dame of the Everglades", [...] "Grandmother of the Everglades" [...] and [...] "the anti-Christ" [...] for her singular focus at the expense of some political interests. She founded and served as president for an organization called Friends of the Everglades, initially intended to protest the construction of a proposed Big Cypress jetport in 1968. Successful in that confrontation, the organization has grown to over 4,000 members, committed to the preservation of the Everglades.

500|$|Fortitude South {{has been}} {{credited}} with ensuring the German 15th Army was not deployed against the Allied invasion force too soon and ensuring the success of Operation Overlord. Gerhard Weinberg stated that the Germans [...] "readily accepted the existence and location" [...] of FUSAG, believed {{the threat to the}} Pas de Calais was real and [...] "it was only at the end of July" [...] that they realized a second assault was not coming; [...] "by that time, {{it was too late to}} move reinforcements". However, Mary Barbier wrote [...] "it is time to consider that the importance of the deception has been overrated". She argues that 15th Army was largely immobile and not combat-ready, that despite the deception numerous German divisions – including the 1st SS Panzer Division, which was held in reserve behind the 15th Army – from across Europe were transferred to Normandy to repel the invasion, and that the Germans had realized as early as May that a real threat to Normandy existed. Barbier further commented that while the Germans believed the deception due to [...] "preconceived ideas <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pas De Calais", the Allied staff had overestimated the effectiveness of the deception after the 15th Army's inaction because they held a [...] "preconceived notion of what FORTITUDE would accomplish". Following the Battle of Normandy, the phantom 80th Division was [...] "transferred" [...] around the east coast of England, moving back and forth between VII Corps and the equally bogus II Corps. The division was eventually [...] "disbanded" [...] in April 1945.|$|E

500|$|Adam's most {{significant}} influence following his death {{is in the}} next episode [...] "Restless", where the cost of defeating Adam is made apparent. Buffys fourth season was a first in the series in that the Scoobies' defeat of the Big Bad did not occur in a two-part grand season finale. [...] "Primeval" [...] is not the last episode of the season. Joss Whedon felt so strongly <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four core characters that he dedicated the finale to exploring their development. [...] "Restless" [...] opens with Buffy, Willow, Xander, and Giles arriving at Buffy's mother's house still brimming with {{the energy of the}} spell that bound them together in [...] "Primeval". Each of them falls asleep quickly, however, and their dreams are a pastiche of enigmatic episodes that both reveal much about each character, but also foreshadow what will occur in seasons to come. Their dreams also mirror their roles in the spell they performed to kill Adam. The magic they used to defeat the influence of science creates an inverse crisis, violating the series' set of laws. Both Riley and Adam, now only in human form, appear in Buffy's dream. They are wearing business suits, sitting together at a glass conference table as Buffy walks into the room, telling her they are naming things—as Adam did in the Garden of Eden—and making plans to take over the world. Buffy asks Adam what his name was before he was a monster, but he cannot tell her. Adam appears once more in the series as one of the faces of the First Evil, the seventh season's Big Bad, in [...] "Lessons".|$|E
500|$|Progressive education, a {{pedagogy}} promoting {{learning through}} real-life experiences, {{was at its}} zenith in the United States in the 1920s and 30s, and the Avery Coonley School was a widely known model of these theories in action. Avery Coonley was featured regularly in Progressive Education and other professional journals, and in 1938, the editor of Progressive Education, Gertrude Hartman, published {{a profile of the}} Avery Coonley School in her book Finding Wisdom: Chronicles of a School of Today. She noted, [...] "isitors {{from all parts of the}} United States and from foreign countries [...] to see the school—sometimes as many as thirty in a day." [...] Hartman described in great detail the curriculum and daily life of the school, which had by then added a seventh and eighth grade, commenting that the most noticeable thing about it is the spirit of earnestness and joy which pervades it... There is a fundamental philosophy of life and education underlying the work of the school, which gives clear direction to all its activities. Broad areas are planned, which form the framework of the curriculum. These however are flexible and subject to modification depending upon conditions. The book described the progress of the students from their first year of kindergarten through their ten years of study, capturing in photos, stories, and examples of students' work their encounters with nature, history, art and other subjects through creative play and collaborative projects. She concluded with observations <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> daily life of the school in developing social responsibility: It is the belief of those concerned with the school that out of the kind of education described here will emerge more socially enlightened members of society than the education of our generation has produced... The method in which those in the school place their faith is the building into the very nature of growing boys and girls, through their growing years, those qualities of mind and spirit from which alone a new attitude towards human relations can evolve. Finding Wisdom became a classic in the education field and solidified the Avery Coonley School's national reputation as a model of progressive education.|$|E
500|$|The {{title is}} a pun on Steven Spielberg's hit war film Saving Private Ryan. Several {{scenes from the}} Army {{training}} contained real-life references; when the recruits are marching, they begin to sing and dance; this is a reference to West Side Story. Additionally, the song playing during the recruitment video bears a close resemblance to the Def Leppard song [...] "Pour Some Sugar On Me". When Peter visits a psychiatrist, the psychiatrist is Dr. Katz. The training {{is similar to that}} in the film Full Metal Jacket, also spoofing the scene when the Sergeant found contraband food. The Sergeant punishes Brian by informing him that he will have to listen to singles from Chris Gaines' album: this entire scene was based on a sketch from Saturday Night Live approximately 10 years ago. Peter references actor Gregory Peck and his [...] "kids" [...] with a cutaway gag featuring four Pecks in a car. Brian shown performing numerous different tasks to complete his army training is a reference to An Officer and a Gentleman, with the music playing in the background from Stripes. The lyrics Lois reads from the Wu-Tang Clan album is from the song [...] "Bring Da Ruckus", the first track from their album Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers). The scene where Marilyn Manson tells Chris about nutrition is a reference to an episode of Clone High, where Manson leads a musical scene <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> food pyramid. The sign outside of the building where the Grammys are being held says [...] "Welcome to the Grammys (Not You, Fred Durst)", a reference to the lead singer of Limp Bizkit. Stewie misunderstands the location of their deployment to be [...] "Fraggle Ir-Rock", rather than Iraq, referring to the TV show Fraggle Rock. The scene where Zinedine Zidane headbutts an old lady while delivering her a birthday cake is based on the incident that happened in the 2006 FIFA World Cup final, when Zidane headbutted Marco Materazzi. [...] When Brian is frustrated with the recruits recommending Chris to join the Army, Stewie says that 10% of his high school class is off to fight another battle. After hearing Stewie, Brian says that he was plagiarizing from The Onion, since Brian read about the war in Iraq in The Onion. During the obstacle course, Brian rides a unicycle, solves a Rubik's Cube, plays Perfection, finds Waldo, offers a couple eating a salad at a dinner table some fresh pepper, and consoles a woman who was just dumped by her boyfriend.|$|E
