5000|$|The Patton Motor Car was a gas-electric hybrid system, {{although}} the term hybrid {{was not yet}} in use. William H. Patton filed for a patent on February 25, 1889; the drawings on his patent application resemble later descriptions of his first prototype. [...] Patton built a tram car that was in experimental service in Pullman, Illinois in 1891 and a small Patton locomotive was sold to a street railway company in Cedar Falls, Iowa in 1897. The latter used a 2-cylinder, 25 hp gasoline engine to drive a 220 volt generator that served to charge the 200 <b>Ampere</b> <b>hour</b> 100 cell lead acid battery in parallel with the traction motors.

5000|$|Like {{the second}} {{generation}} Prius, the third generation Prius battery pack {{is made up of}} the same type of 1.2 volt cells. It has 28 modules of 6 cells for a total nominal voltage of only 201.6 volts. A boost converter is used to produce 500 Volt DC supply voltage for the inverters for MG1 and MG2. The car's electronics only allow 40% of total rated capacity of the battery pack (6,5 <b>Ampère</b> <b>hour)</b> to be used in order to prolong the battery life. As a result, the SoC is allowed to vary only between 40% and 80% of the rated full charge. The battery used in the Highlander Hybrid and the Lexus RX 400h was packaged in a different metal battery casing with 240 cells that deliver high voltage of 288 volts. A button labelled [...] "EV" [...] maintains electric vehicle mode after being powered on and under most low-load conditions at less than 25 mph if the traction battery has enough charge. This permits all-electric driving with no fuel consumption for up to 1 mi. However, the HSD software switches to EV mode automatically whenever it can. Only the Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid has a longer driving all-electric range in blended operation electric-gasoline of 11 mi (EPA rating) until the battery is depleted. The Prius PHEV is outfitted with 4.4 kWh lithium-ion batteries co-developed with Panasonic that weighs 80 kg compared with the nickel-metal hydride battery of the third generation Prius, which has a capacity of only 1.3 kWh, and weighs 42 kg. The larger battery pack enables all-electric operation at higher speeds and longer distances than the conventional Prius hybrid.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} four {{different}} charge methods {{on the energy}} conversion efficiency of 300 <b>ampere</b> <b>hour</b> lead acid traction cells were investigated.

40|$|Six <b>ampere</b> <b>hour</b> {{individual}} {{pressure vessel}} nickel hydrogen cells were charge/discharge cycled to failure. Failure as used here is defined to {{occur when the}} end of discharge voltage degraded to 0. 9 volts. They were cycled under a low earth orbit cycle regime to a deep depth of discharge (80 percent of rated <b>ampere</b> <b>hour</b> capacity). Both cell designs were fabricated by the same manufacturer and represent {{current state of the}} art. A failure model was advanced which suggests both cell designs have inadequate volume tolerance characteristics. The limited existing data base at a deep depth of discharge (DOD) was expanded. Two cells of each design were cycled. One COMSAT cell failed at cycle 1712 and the other failed at cycle 1875. For the Air Force/Hughes cells, one cell failed at cycle 2250 and the other failed at cycle 2638. All cells, of both designs, failed due to low end of discharge voltage (0. 9 volts). No cell failed due to electrical shorts. After cell failure, three different reconditioning tests (deep discharge, physical reorientation, and open circuit voltage stand) were conducted on all cells of each design. A fourth reconditioning test (electrolyte addition) was conducted on one cell of each design.

50|$|Electric-vehicle {{batteries}} {{differ from}} starting, lighting, and ignition (SLI) batteries {{because they are}} designed to give power over sustained periods of time. Deep-cycle batteries are used instead of SLI batteries for these applications. Traction batteries must be designed with a high ampere-hour capacity. Batteries for electric vehicles are characterized by their relatively high power-to-weight ratio, energy-to-weight ratio and energy density; smaller, lighter batteries reduce the weight of the vehicle and improve its performance. Compared to liquid fuels, most current battery technologies have much lower specific energy, and this often impacts the maximal all-electric range of the vehicles. However, metal-air batteries have high specific energy because the cathode is provided by the surrounding oxygen in the air. Rechargeable batteries used in electric vehicles include lead-acid ("flooded", deep-cycle, and VRLA), NiCd, nickel-metal hydride, lithium-ion, Li-ion polymer, and, less commonly, zinc-air and molten-salt batteries. The amount of electricity (i.e. electric charge) stored in batteries is measured in <b>ampere</b> <b>hours</b> or in coulombs, with the total energy often measured in watt hours.|$|R
50|$|Attitude {{control is}} needed to keep a spacecraft’s {{instruments}} and antennas aimed in the correct direction. During course maneuvers, a spacecraft may need to rotate so that its rocket faces the proper direction before being fired. Mariner 10 determined its attitude using two optical sensors, one pointed at the Sun, and the other at a bright star, usually Canopus; additionally, the probe's three gyroscopes provided a second option for calculating the attitude. Nitrogen gas thrusters were used to adjust Mariner 10’s orientation along three axes. The spacecraft’s electronics were intricate and complex: it contained over 32,000 pieces of circuitry, of which resistors, capacitors, diodes, microcircuits, and transistors were the most common devices. Commands for the instruments could be stored on Mariner 10’s computer, but were limited to 512 words. The rest had to be broadcast by the Mission Sequence Working Group from Earth. Supplying the spacecraft components with power required modifying the electrical output of the solar panels. The power subsystem used two redundant sets of circuitry, each containing a booster regulator and an inverter, to convert the panels' DC output to AC and alter the voltage to the necessary level.

40|$|Battery {{currents}} in autonomous renewable energy systems (RES) are generally predicted or {{measured in terms}} of mean values over intervals of 1 min or longer. As a result, battery charge-discharge cycles with periods less than the averaging period are ignored, and the actual battery <b>ampere</b> <b>hour</b> (A h) throughput and resulting battery wear may be seriously underestimated, leading to optimistic prediction of battery lifetime. This paper considers short charge-discharge cycles or microcycles, arising from the characteristics of autonomous renewable energy systems, including generators, regulators, loads, and load inverter. Simulation results are used to show that inverters operating directly from the battery can cause microcycles, resulting in significantly increased battery throughput.
