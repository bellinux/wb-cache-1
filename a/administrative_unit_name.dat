50|$|In 1828, the khanates of Erivan and the Nakhichevan were annexed from Persia by the Russian Empire in {{accordance}} with the Treaty of Turkmenchay. They were included into a single <b>administrative</b> <b>unit</b> <b>named</b> the Armenian Oblast. In 1850 the oblast was reorganized into a governorate, and by 1872, it consisted of seven uyezds. Louis Joseph Jérôme Napoléon (1864-1932), grandnephew of Napoleon I, was made governor in 1905 to help calm the governorate after the Armenian-Tatar conflicts.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} period of Ottoman rule {{the areas that}} form {{contemporary}} Albania were reorganised into an <b>administrative</b> <b>unit</b> <b>named</b> Sancak-i Arnavid or Sancak-i Arnavud. During the onset of Ottoman rule only prominent churches with significant symbolic meaning or cultural value of an urban settlement were converted into mosques. Most early mosques constructed in Albania were mainly built within fortresses for Ottoman garrisons at times by Ottoman Sultans during their military campaigns in the area like Fatih Sultan Mehmet Mosque in Shkodër, the Red Mosque in Berat and others.|$|R

5000|$|Sremčica {{is located}} south of Belgrade and begins some 2 km {{south of the}} southernmost part of the {{neighborhood}} of Železnik (though centers of these two settlements are 6-7 kilometers apart). It is a typical road settlement stretched along the central Beogradska street, with many side streets simply being named Beogradska street part 1, 2, etc., {{but most of them}} got their own, separate names in 2004-2007. The northern section of the neighborhood makes a separate local community (mesna zajednica), sub-municipal <b>administrative</b> <b>unit,</b> <b>named</b> Gorica but is popularly called Naselje (Serbian for [...] "settlement") by the local population, which numbered 5,358 in 2002. Southern part is organized as a local community with the same name as the entire settlement, Sremčica. Bot local communities were later merged into one.|$|R
50|$|The Seto Marine Biological Laboratory (瀬戸臨海実験所, {{also known}} as SMBL), is a marine biology field station of Kyoto University. It {{is located in the}} small town of Shirahama in Wakayama Prefecture about 230 km from Kyoto. Established in 1922, {{research}} at the lab has historically been focused on marine invertebrates. A small island, Hatakejima, belongs to the laboratory and serves as an experimental field site in southeastern Tanabe Bay. The Shirahama Aquarium, open to the public, is located next to the research laboratories and operated by SMBL. In 2003, Kyoto University combined SMBL with the Maizuru Fisheries Research Station, University Forests, and the Subtropical Plant Institute into an <b>administrative</b> <b>unit</b> <b>named</b> the Field Science Education and Research Center (FSERC). The scientific journal Publications of the Seto Marine Biological Laboratory has been published by SMBL since 1949.|$|R
5000|$|Choibalsan (Mongolian: [...] ) is the fourth-largest city in Mongolia after Darkhan, Erdenet and Ulaanbaatar. The name of {{the city}} was Bayan Tu'men (...) until 1941, when it was renamed after the {{communist}} leader Khorloogiin Choibalsan. It is the capital of the province of Dornod. The city <b>administrative</b> <b>unit's</b> official <b>name</b> is Kherlen sum, with area of 281 sqkm sq mi.It is situated at the Kherlen River, at an elevation of 747 m above sea level.|$|R

50|$|Sarawak {{remained}} {{part of the}} Empire of Japan {{for three}} years and eight months. Sarawak, together with North Borneo and Brunei, formed a single <b>administrative</b> <b>unit</b> <b>named</b> Kita Boruneo (Northern Borneo) under the Japanese 37th Army headquartered in Kuching. Sarawak was divided into three provinces, namely: Kuching-shu, Sibu-shu, and Miri-shu, each under their respective Japanese Provincial Governor. The Japanese retained pre-war administrative machinery and assigned Japanese for government positions. The administration of Sarawak's interior was left to the native police and village headmen, under Japanese supervision. Though the Malays were typically receptive toward the Japanese, other indigenous tribes such as the Iban, Kayan, Kenyah, Kelabit and Lun Bawang maintained a hostile attitude toward them because of policies such as compulsory labour, forced deliveries of foodstuffs, and confiscation of firearms. The Japanese did not resort to strong measures in clamping down on the Chinese population because the Chinese in the state were generally apolitical. However, a considerable number of Chinese moved from urban areas into the less accessible interior to lessen contact with the Japanese.|$|R
5000|$|Transylvania ("Land {{beyond the}} Forests") was a {{borderland}} {{in the medieval}} Kingdom of Hungary. The development of royal administration is documented from {{the second half of}} the 11th century. The royal castle at Torda (now Turda in Romania) was first mentioned in 1075, the fortress at Küküllő (now Cetatea de Baltă in Romania) in 1177. Most royal castles developed into the seats of counties, which were important <b>administrative</b> <b>units,</b> each <b>named</b> for its center. A high-ranking royal official, the voivode was the superior of the ispáns (or heads) of the Transylvanian counties from the late 12th century.|$|R
50|$|The Elbe {{delineated}} {{the western}} parts of Germany {{from the eastern}} so-called East Elbia, where soccage and serfdom were more strict and prevailed longer, than westwards of the river, and where feudal lords held bigger estates than in the west. Thus incumbents of huge land-holdings became characterised as East Elbian Junkers. The Northern German area north of the Lower Elbe {{used to be called}} North Albingia in the Middle Ages. When the four Lutheran church bodies there united in 1977 they chose the name North Elbian Evangelical Lutheran Church. Other, <b>administrative</b> <b>units</b> were <b>named</b> after the river Elbe, such as the Westphalian Elbe département (1807-1813) and the Lower Elbe département (1810), and the French département Bouches-de-l'Elbe (1811-1814).|$|R
50|$|The soil {{here is not}} {{particularly}} fertile, {{which may explain why}} Gottenhouse shows no evidence of having been settled until well after the Western Roman empire period. The village appears as Godenhusa in a 10th-century list of the assets of the Abbey of Marmoutier. The settlement appears to have been administratively independent at this stage, but {{by the beginning of the}} next century Gottenhouse and Otterswiller had become part of a single <b>administrative</b> <b>unit.</b> The <b>name</b> of the settlement changed only slightly over the years, to Gotzhuse (1363), Gotenhusen (1371), Gottenhusen (1427), Gottenhausen (1520) and in Alsatian Gottehüse. After 1871, with the annexation of Alsace and Lorraine by Germany, many towns and villages adopted rediscovered German language names, and this is when the name Gottenhausen became mainstream. The adoption of a francophone version of the name, Gottenhouse, dates from 1948.|$|R
500|$|During {{the time}} of British East India Company, the <b>administrative</b> <b>unit</b> by the <b>name</b> Birbhum was formed in 1787. Before that, it was {{administratively}} a part of Murshidabad district. In 1787, when the official [...] "District Beerbhoom" [...] was established, the district was much bigger than it is now. Till 1793, it included [...] "Bishenpore" [...] or Bishnupur, which {{is now part of}} the Bankura district. Till the 1857 Sepoy Mutiny, the Santhal Parganas was part of Birbhum; the district thus sprawled up to Deoghar in the west. The immediate reason then for separating the western tribal majority areas was the Santhal rebellion of 1855–56, which was quelled. Sidhu and Kanu are remembered in Birbhum as martyrs of this uprising.|$|R
5000|$|For {{the century}} {{preceding}} 1920 the U.S. Army was geographically divided into series of Military Divisions, [...] "Departments" [...] and smaller [...] "Districts" [...] and Subdistricts. Departments and divisions were numbered or named for their geographic location. Before the War of 1812 these <b>administrative</b> <b>units</b> were geographically <b>named</b> {{starting with the}} Department of the East and Department of the West. About 1815, the areas were numbered until after the Civil War. After the Civil War, the system used until after World War I was again geographically identified; i.e. Department of the East or Department of the Missouri and subordinate units were called divisions or districts. The last reorganization of departments was done in 1917 after the beginning of World War I.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{the rest}} of Ukraine, most of Western Ukraine was never part of the Russian empire. It is the only {{territory}} in Ukraine whose <b>administrative</b> <b>units</b> are <b>named</b> after its own historic regions often going back centuries, instead of their administrative centers which are used conventionally throughout {{the rest of}} the country. The modern south-western part of Western Ukraine became a province of Austria-Hungary after the partitions of Poland. Its northern flank with the cities of Lutsk and Rivne was acquired in 1795 by Imperial Russia following the third and final partition of Poland. Throughout its existence Russian Poland was marred with violence and intimidation, beginning with the 1794 massacres, imperial land-theft and the deportations of the November and January Uprisings. By contrast, the Austrian Partition with its Sejm of the Land in the cities of Lviv and Stanislavov (Ivano-Frankivsk) was freer politically perhaps because it had a lot less to offer economically. Imperial Austria did not persecute Ukrainian organizations. In later years, Austria-Hungary de facto encouraged the existence of Ukrainian political organizations in order to counterbalance the influence of Polish culture in Galicia. The southern half of West Ukraine remained under Austrian administration until the collapse of the House of Habsburg at the end of World War One in 1918.|$|R
40|$|The {{contemporary}} {{idea of a}} self-government <b>administrative</b> <b>unit</b> in Poland (<b>named</b> a „self-govemment province” by the legislator) {{results from}} many years of debates over the possibility to build democratic local authorities of this level {{with reference to the}} national traditions and the western European models. The Polish regional reform has gained in significance in the recent years as the role of the regions has grown significantly both within the particular member states and in Europe as a whole. Quoting the provisions of the Polish Constitution and the relevant parliamentary acts, the Author discusses the Polish regional reform and the particular provisions regulating the creation and work of the local authorities, comparing them to the systems already existing in the Western Europe. In this discussion the Author quotes above all the provisions of the European Charter of Local Self-Government and the European Charter of Regional Self-Government passed by the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities in Europe in June 1997...|$|R
