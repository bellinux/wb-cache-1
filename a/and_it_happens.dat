[...] The song ends with another sample from Star Search, in which McMahon announces that Knowles' group lost the competition. In a video commentary to the album, Knowles explained {{that in her}} mind , she would have never imagined losing as a possibility, {{and it was the}} best message for her. [...] "I feel like something about the aggression of 'Bow Down' and the attitude of 'Flawless'—the reality is, sometimes you lose. And you're never too good to lose, you're never too big to lose, you're never too smart to lose, it happens. <b>And</b> <b>it</b> <b>happens</b> when it needs to happen.

2500|$|While Kenny {{observes that}} the AOH was [...] "a {{peaceful}} fraternal society", he does {{note that in}} the 1870s the Pinkerton Agency identified a correlation between the areas of AOH membership in Pennsylvania, and the corresponding areas in Ireland from which those particular Irish immigrants emigrated. The violence-prone areas of Ireland corresponded to areas {{of violence in the}} Pennsylvania coalfields. In his book Big Trouble, which traces McParland's history, writer J. Anthony Lukas has written: [...] "The WBA was run by Lancashire men adamantly opposed to violence. But [...] saw an opportunity to paint the union with the Molly brush, which he did in testimony before a state investigating committee ...

60|$|Now, it may {{be argued}} {{that this is not}} a fair sample of our general population, that these facts have been culled from a special section of the population, that here we are dealing with the {{congestion}} of London slums and altogether exceptional conditions.

50|$|However, {{he would}} reach his artistic {{peak in the}} 1950s. Vajda's movies during this period are clearly {{influenced}} by German director Fritz Lang.

6000|$|It {{may appear}} strange to some readers that I put the tree-pipit, with his thin, shrill, canary-like pipe, in this list; but his notes {{are not all}} of this character; he is {{moreover}} a most variable singer; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>happens</b> that in some individuals the concluding notes of the song have more of that peculiar human quality than any other British songster. No doubt it was a bird in which these human-like, languishing notes {{at the close of}} the song were very full and beautiful that inspired Burns to write his [...] "Address to a Wood-lark." [...] The tree pipit is often called by that name in Scotland, where the true wood-lark is not found.|$|E

"He {{sat down}} on the rough bench outside my inn and drank some wine from the {{vineyards}} below, sighing with ecstasy over it like one who had travelled long among alien, cruel things and found at last something that he knew.

It is old, but of no value; my grandmother gave it to me long ago: she was devout, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>happens</b> that the glass is painted with a crude picture of Bethlehem and the Wise Men and the Star.
