The constant α is also a keystone for the determination of other fundamental physical constants, especially the ones involved {{in the framework of}} the future International System of units. This paper presents Paris experiment, where the {{fine structure}} constant is determined by measuring the recoil velocity of a rubidium atom when it absorbs a photon. The impact of the recent improvement of QED calculations of the electron moment anomaly and the recent measurement of the cesium atom recoil at Berkeley will be discussed.

40|$|International audienceThe ratio h/m u {{between the}} Planck {{constant}} and the unified <b>atomic</b> <b>mass</b> <b>constant</b> {{should have a}} special status {{in the framework of}} the future International System of Units. Currently (before the redefinition), this ratio allows to compare determinations of h (watt balance) and determinations of m u (XRCD method). In the future SI, as the Planck constant h will be fixed, the ratio h/m u will ensure the realization of the new kilogram (quantum kilogram) at the atomic scale. Furthermore as the Avogadro constant will be fixed, the carbon molar mass M(12 C), which will no longer be equal to 12 g · mol − 1, will be determined from m u. This ratio is also a key data for the realization of the kilogram at the macroscopic scale using the XRCD method. In this paper we present {{the state of the art}} on experiments that provide the most precise value of the ratio h/m u.

40|$|We derive {{expression}} for energy flux {{in terms of}} lattice normal mode coordinates. Energy transmission across solid junctions from lattice dynamic {{point of view is}} given and its relation with <b>atomic</b> <b>masses,</b> lattice <b>constants,</b> and group velocities is clarified. A scattering boundary method (SBM) is proposed for calculating the amplitude transmission across solid junctions. The phonon transmission coefficients and thermal conductance are calculated for two kinds of acoustically mismatched junctions: different chirality nanotubes (11, 0) to (8, 0), and Si-Ge interface structure. Our calculation shows a mode-dependent transmission in nanotube junction due to the high symmetry vibrating motions for nanotube atoms, indicating its possible important role in nanotube mixture thermal conductance. Energy transmission and Kapitza conductance across the Si-Ge interface [001] are calculated for the Si-Ge diamond-type structure. It is shown that the energy transmission across the Si-Ge interface depends on the incident angle and on the interface mode conversion. A critical incident angle about 42 degrees numerically found for waves incident from Ge to Si. Our numerical result of the Kapitza conductance at temperature T= 200 K is G_K= 4. 6 x 10 ^ 8 W/(Km^ 2) We find numerically scaling law G_K proportional to T^{ 2. 87 } for [001] interface at low temperature.
