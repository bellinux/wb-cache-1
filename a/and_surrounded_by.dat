5|$|In {{the late}} 18th century and early 19th century Warsaw grew quickly. As Poland {{was going through}} a period of turmoil and {{constant}} devastating wars, it lacked modern permanent fortifications. To make up for it, three lines of earthworks, ramparts and palisades were constructed {{on both sides of the}} Vistula. The earthworks, usually several metres high and constructed mostly of sand and clay, were reinforced with gabions <b>and</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> a dry moat, a stockade and a line of trous de loup.|$|E

A sufficient quantity of enriched uranium arrived at Los Alamos by April 1944, and the Water Boiler commenced operation in May. By the end of June it had achieved all of its design goals.|$|E

5|$|The suburb was {{originally}} three low lying islands that {{were covered in}} shell grit and saltbush <b>and</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> mangrove and samphire swamps.

5|$|Ben Nevis's popularity, {{climate and}} complex {{topography}} {{contribute to a}} high number of mountain rescue incidents. In 1999, for example, there were 41 rescues and four fatalities on the mountain. Some accidents arise over difficulties in navigating to or from the summit, especially in poor visibility. The problem {{stems from the fact that}} the summit plateau is roughly kidney-shaped <b>and</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> cliffs on three sides; the danger is particularly accentuated when the main path is obscured by snow. Two precise compass bearings taken in succession are necessary to navigate from the summit cairn to the west flank, from where a descent can be made on the Pony Track in relative safety.|$|E
