This book published pieces by Truman Capote, Hunter S.

25|$|The Routemaster was {{developed}} between 1947 and 1956 {{by a team}} directed by AAM Durrant and Colin Curtis, with vehicle styling by Douglas Scott. The design brief was to produce a vehicle that was lighter (hence more fuel-efficient), easier to operate <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> maintained by the existing maintenance practices at the recently opened Aldenham Works, but with easier and lower-cost servicing procedures. The resulting vehicle seated 64 passengers, despite being three-quarters of a ton lighter than buses in the RT family, which seated 56.|$|E

25|$|The factory at Sèvres was nationalized in 1793 {{after the}} French Revolution. After 1800 it stopped {{producing}} soft-paste and standardized on an unusually hard type of hard-paste using china clay from Saint-Yrieix, near Limoges. The factory produced many different painted designs for decoration. Later in the 19th century the art director Théodore Deck (1823–91) introduced manufacture of siliceous soft-paste pieces. The factory could make large objects {{that did not}} crack or split, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> decorated in rich colors due to the low firing temperature.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{formation}} of various organizations overseeing martial arts, {{a problem of}} commonality appeared.

Two of the largest Japanese organizations, All Japan Kendo Federation (ZNKR) and All Japan Iaido Federation (ZNIR), each created their own representative set of kata for this purpose.|$|E

25|$|The Civil War era {{also showed}} {{a spirit of}} sexual revolution. The anarchist women's {{organization}} Mujeres Libres established an equal opportunity for women {{in a society that}} traditionally had held women in lower regard. Women acquired power they had not previously had in Spanish society, fighting at the front and doing heavy jobs, things that had been forbidden to them until then. Free love became popular, although some parents' distrust produced the creation of the revolutionary weddings, informal ceremonies in which the couples declared their status, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> annulled if both parties didn't want to continue their relationship.|$|E
25|$|The major {{competitor}} for the Panorama Elite III was the Duple Dominant launched at the 1972 Commercial Motor Show in London. The Duple was of all steel {{design and}} built at Duple's Blackpool factory. The Dominant had {{many of the}} design cues of the Panorama Elite <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> because the managing director {{at that time was}} an ex Plaxton employee. The Dominant sold well but never caught up with the Elite. The mere fact that at the 1972 Commercial Motor Show only one Dominant was available due to a long strike at the Blackpool factory couldn't have helped much. The launch of the Dominant was at Lake Garda in Italy and was Duple's most important launch for years.|$|E
25|$|Development of the 959 (originally {{called the}} Gruppe B) started in 1981, {{shortly after the}} company's then-new Managing Director, Peter Schutz, took his office. Porsche's head {{engineer}} at the time, Helmuth Bott, approached Schutz with some ideas about the Porsche 911, or more aptly, a new one. Bott knew that the company needed a sports car that they could continue to rely on {{for years to come}} <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> developed as time went on. Curious as to how much they could do with the rear-engined 911, Bott convinced Schutz that development tests should take place, and even proposed researching a new all wheel drive system. Schutz agreed, and gave the project the green light. Bott also knew through experience that a racing program usually helped to accelerate the development of new models. Seeing Group B rally racing as the perfect arena to test the new mule and its all wheel drive system, Bott again went to Schutz and got the go ahead to develop a car, based on his development mule, for competition in Group B.|$|E

25|$|The {{seats of}} the disqualified Senators were filled by countbacks of the 2016 Senate {{election}} results in their states of Western Australia, Queensland and New South Wales. The countback results were announced on 10 November: in Western Australia, the Greens' Scott Ludlam {{was replaced by}} Jordon Steele-John; in Queensland, the Greens' Larissa Waters was replaced by former Australian Democrats leader Andrew Bartlett and One Nation's Malcolm Roberts was replaced by Fraser Anning. However, the court has delayed the appointment of Nationals' Fiona Nash's replacement Liberal Hollie Hughes due to concerns that Hughes may also be ineligible under s 44(iv) of the Constitution as a holder of an office of profit under the Crown, due to her reappointment to the Administrative Appeal Tribunal in the period following her apparent election defeat. If Hughes is found to not {{be eligible for the}} vacant Senate post, the spot could be filled by former general Jim Molan, who was a Liberal candidate at the 2016 election. But according to constitutional law professor George Williams, as Hughes was a valid candidate {{at the time of the}} July 2, 2016 election, if the High Court rules her out then a casual vacancy would be created <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> filled as such, including by Nash.|$|E

Karthik Keramalu of CNN-IBN, in his review of Kumari 21F, stated that Sukumar’s lead characters are [...] "psychologically wired differently", adding {{that at least one}} of the characters in his films [...] "behaves in a way that will amuse the audience and the other characters present in the film". Regarding the same, Sukumar said, [...] "We all have a lot of emotions and we suppress most of them fearing rejection. Instead we sport a smile and move on in this world. Problems arise when we don’t enjoy all feelings like jealousy, selfishness and don’t express them. To achieve something, there must be a driving force <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> jealousy which you term as negative".|$|E

2500|$|Details {{regarding}} the album were sparse; {{completion of the}} album was announced via a blog post on 8 July 2006. While the record was in the writing and recording stages, some band members were based in New York City and others in Los Angeles. Aaron Turner later confessed that the album [...] "suffered" [...] due to this situation. Jeff Caxide also felt discontent and dissatisfaction with the album, stating that In the Absence of Truth was “the kind of record I listen to and think ‘that could be better, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> better, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> better,’ and I think we all kind of felt that way”. Drummer Aaron Harris felt that the band pushed themselves too far musically, too; having learned a wealth of new techniques prior to its recording, he says he “grew {{so much as a}} drummer [...] that it was overwhelming even for me.” He continues: “I think I was trying to show off a little bit [...] I think everybody was.” The eventual record proved dissatisfactory, with him opining that “some of it sounded a bit jumbled. I think a lot of things were happening that we didn't know what to do with.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Accuracy and {{repeatability}} {{are different}} measures. Repeatability {{is usually the}} most important criterion for a robot and {{is similar to the}} concept of 'precision' in measurement—see accuracy and precision. ISO 9283 [...] sets out a method whereby both accuracy and repeatability can be measured. Typically a robot is sent to a taught position a number of times and the error is measured at each return to the position after visiting 4 other positions. Repeatability is then quantified using the standard deviation of those samples in all three dimensions. A typical robot can, of course make a positional error exceeding that <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> a problem for the process. Moreover, the repeatability is different {{in different parts of the}} working envelope and also changes with speed and payload. ISO 9283 specifies that accuracy and repeatability should be measured at maximum speed and at maximum payload. But this results in pessimistic values whereas the robot could be much more accurate and repeatable at light loads and speeds.|$|E

He took his team members on [...] "writing trips" [...] to places such as Rocky's, the La Brea Tar Pits, and the wilderness. If he liked the story premises, the writers produced full outlines from the premises. Outlines approved by both him and Nickelodeon became Rocko's Modern Life episodes.

Murray stated that each episode of Rocko's Modern Life stemmed from the personal experiences of himself and/or {{one or more of}} the directors or writers. He said that he did not intend to use formulaic writing seen in other cartoons; he desired content that [...] "broke new ground" [...] and [...] "did things that rode the edge", <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> described as [...] "unexpected". He did not hire writers who had previous experience with writing cartoons, instead hiring writers who worked outside of animation, including improv actors and comic artists. He said that story concepts that [...] "ever smacked close to some formula idea that we had all seen before" [...] received immediate rejection.|$|E
