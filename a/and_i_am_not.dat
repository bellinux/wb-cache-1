5|$|I was {{of course}} happy to meet the Hizbullah people, {{because it is a}} point of view that is rarely heard in the United States. I have no problem saying that I do want to express {{solidarity}} with them, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> going to be a coward of (sic) a hypocrite about it. I don't care about Hizbullah as a political organization. I don't know much about their politics, and anyhow, it's irrelevant. I don't live in Lebanon. It's a choice that the Lebanese have to make: Who they want to be their leaders, who they want to represent them. But there is a fundamental principle. People have the right to defend their country from foreign occupiers, and {{people have the right to}} defend their country from invaders who are destroying their country. That to me is a very basic, elementary and uncomplicated question.|$|E

Anti-Semitism predates the birth of Israel. Neither Israel's policies nor the critics of those policies should {{be held responsible for}} anti-Semitism. At the same time, I do believe that attitudes toward Israel are influenced by Israel's policies, and attitudes toward the Jewish community are influenced by the pro-Israel lobby's success in suppressing divergent views.|$|E

500|$|In {{more recent}} years, frontwoman Love {{stated that the}} album {{contains}} [...] "nothing melodic". In a 2011 interview for Hit So Hard (2011), a documentary on later Hole drummer Patty Schemel, Love referred to Pretty on the Inside as [...] "unlistenable", going on to say: [...] "That record was a calling card for rock critics and hardcorers, [...] 'This is what I do, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> going to back down from it.

In what was called [...] "a brave homage to her daughter", Jyoti's mother, Asha Devi, said, [...] "My daughter's name was Jyoti Singh <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> ashamed to name her.

500|$|Rand {{said her}} most {{important}} contributions to philosophy were her [...] "theory of concepts, [...] ethics, and [...] discovery in politics that evil—the violation of rights—consists of {{the initiation of}} force". She believed epistemology was a foundational branch of philosophy and considered the advocacy of reason to be the single most significant aspect of her philosophy, stating, [...] "I am not primarily an advocate of capitalism, but of egoism; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> primarily an advocate of egoism, but of reason. If one recognizes the supremacy of reason and applies it consistently, all the rest follows." ...|$|E
500|$|Due to {{international}} fixtures, Arsenal {{did not play}} another game for two weeks. On the resumption of club football, they faced newly promoted Portsmouth at home. Striker Teddy Sheringham gave the visitors a deserved lead, before Arsenal were awarded a penalty when Pirès was adjudged to have been fouled in the penalty area by Dejan Stefanović. Henry scored, and though their performance noticeably improved in the second half, the game ended in a draw. Portsmouth manager Harry Redknapp complained about the penalty decision post-match and felt Pirès [...] "…was {{going to get a}} yellow card [...]" [...] The player himself denied accusations that he deceived the referee: [...] "I did not dive <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> a cheat. That is not the way I play." ...|$|E
500|$|As it {{continued}} eastward, Epsilon developed characteristics of an annular hurricane; such cyclones, more {{often found in}} the deep tropics with greater intensity, have circular eyes, surrounded by a nearly uniform ring of convection and {{a general lack of}} thunderstorms outside the ring. For several days, the intensity fluctuated in a narrow range, and although Epsilon was briefly downgraded to tropical storm status on December4, the NHC assessed it as remaining a hurricane. After it was thought to have weakened, the eye became more symmetric as the ring of convection became stronger. The hurricane remained difficult to forecast, as NHC forecaster Lixion Avila remarked, [...] "There are no clear reasons... <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> going to make one up... to explain the recent strengthening of Epsilon." ...|$|E

500|$|Fox made no {{promises}} that his efforts {{would lead to}} a cure for cancer, but he closed his letter with the statement: [...] "We need your help. The people in cancer clinics all over the world need people who believe in miracles. I am not a dreamer, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> saying that this will initiate any kind of definitive answer or cure to cancer. I believe in miracles. I have to." [...] The Cancer Society was skeptical of his dedication, but agreed to support Fox once he had acquired sponsors and requested he get a medical certificate from a heart specialist stating that he was fit to attempt the run. Fox was diagnosed with left ventricular hypertrophy– an enlarged heart– a condition commonly associated with athletes. Doctors warned Fox of the potential risks he faced, though they did not consider his condition a significant concern. They endorsed his participation when he promised that he would stop immediately if he began to experience any heart problems.|$|E
500|$|Some media sources {{proposed}} that the dress {{could be interpreted as}} anti-vegan. Vegetarian singer Morrissey stated that he felt the dress was acceptable {{as long as it was}} a social or political statement, and not just a [...] "loony idea", pointing out that artist Linder Sterling had previously worn a meat dress in 1982 to protest against what she believed to be the perception of women by men. Ellen DeGeneres presented Gaga with a bikini made of vegetables when the singer appeared on her talk show, and the singer used the platform to respond to the controversy surrounding the dress saying, [...] "... it has many interpretations. For me this evening, if we don't stand up for what we believe in and if we don't fight for our rights pretty soon, we're going to have as much rights as the meat on our own bones. <b>And,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> a piece of meat." [...] She explained further that she was also using the dress to highlight her distaste for the US military's [...] "don't ask, don't tell" [...] policy.|$|E
500|$|Chopra {{described}} her character Sweety as [...] "feisty and vivacious". She said, [...] "Sweety is very busy, {{and does not}} have time {{to take care of her}} looks and apply make up. Her only aim in life is to bunk her lectures and visit her boyfriend's college or stay in his hotel, and eventually marry him." [...] Chopra described both her character and herself as being [...] "outspoken and fun loving" [...] as well as honest and unable to [...] "hide something that is wrong". She said she had a different cultural background to Sweety, and found it challenging to convincingly portray a Maharashtrian Marathi girl. She had to adopt body language and a Maharashtrian accent to suit the character. She learnt the Marathi language to make the character as authentic as possible, which she found difficult as a Punjabi. Chopra said: [...] "I am speaking a lot of Marathi in the film. It was difficult for me because it's a difficult language <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> good at Marathi. But I think it's my luck that through Kaminey I got to learn one more language." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{some months}} in London, Lambert was visited by Józef Boruwłaski, a [...] dwarf then in his seventies. Born in 1739 to a poor family in rural Pokuttya, Boruwłaski was {{generally}} considered to be the last of Europe's court dwarfs. [...] He was introduced to the Empress Maria Theresa in 1754, and after a short time residing with deposed Polish king Stanisław Leszczyński, he exhibited himself around Europe, thus becoming a wealthy man. At age60, he retired to Durham, where he became such a popular figure that the City of Durham paid him to live there and he became one of its most prominent citizens. [...] Boruwłaski had a superb memory, and recalled that Lambert, while still employed by Patrick's die casting works and before he grew fat, had paid to see him in Birmingham. Boruwłaski remarked [...] "I have seen this face twenty years before at Birmingham, but certainly it be another body". He had been told that Lambert's bulk was a hoax, and he therefore felt his leg to prove to himself that it was not. The two men compared their respective outfits, and calculated that one of Lambert's sleeves would provide enough cloth to make an entire coat for Boruwłaski. Lambert enquired after Boruwłaski's wife, Isalina Barbutan, whereupon the latter replied [...] "No, she is dead, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> very sorry, for when I affront her, she put me on the mantle-shelf for punishment." ...|$|E
500|$|Peter Buck's {{style of}} playing guitar has {{been singled out}} {{by many as the}} most {{distinctive}} aspect of R.E.M.'s music. During the 1980s, Buck's [...] "economical, arpeggiated, poetic" [...] style reminded British music journalists of 1960s American folk rock band The Byrds. Buck has stated [...] " [...] Roger McGuinn was a big influence on me as a guitar player", but said it was Byrds-influenced bands, including Big Star and The Soft Boys, that inspired him more. Comparisons were also made with the guitar playing of Johnny Marr of alternative rock contemporaries The Smiths. While Buck professed being a fan of the group, he admitted he initially criticized the band simply because he was tired of fans asking him if he was influenced by Marr, whose band had in fact made their debut after R.E.M. Buck generally eschews guitar solos; he explained in 2002, [...] "I know that when guitarists rip into this hot solo, people go nuts, but I don't write songs that suit that, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> interested in that. I can do it if I have to, but I don't like it." [...] Mike Mills' melodic approach to bass playing is inspired by Paul McCartney of The Beatles and Chris Squire of Yes; Mills has said, [...] "I always played a melodic bass, like a piano bass in some ways [...] [...] [...] I never wanted to play the traditional locked into the kick drum, root note bass work." [...] Mills has more musical training than his bandmates, which he has said [...] "made it easier to turn abstract musical ideas into reality." ...|$|E
500|$|Richard Dawkins {{dedicated}} {{a chapter}} in The Blind Watchmaker to correcting, in his view, the wide confusion regarding rates of change. His first point is to argue that phyletic gradualism — understood {{in the sense that}} evolution proceeds at a single uniform rate of speed, called [...] "constant speedism" [...] by Dawkins — is a [...] "caricature of Darwinism" [...] and [...] "does not really exist." [...] His second argument, which follows from the first, is that once the caricature of [...] "constant speedism" [...] is dismissed, we are left with one logical alternative, which Dawkins terms [...] "variable speedism." [...] Variable speedism may also be distinguished one of two ways: [...] "discrete variable speedism" [...] and [...] "continuously variable speedism." [...] Eldredge and Gould, proposing that evolution jumps between stability and relative rapidity, are described as [...] "discrete variable speedists," [...] and [...] "in this respect they are genuinely radical." [...] They assert that evolution generally proceeds in bursts, or not at all. [...] "Continuously variable speedists," [...] on the other hand advance that [...] "evolutionary rates fluctuate continuously from very fast to very slow and stop, with all intermediates. They see no particular reason to emphasize certain speeds more than others. In particular, stasis, to them, is just an extreme case of ultra-slow evolution. To a punctuationist, there is something very special about stasis." [...] Dawkins therefore commits himself here to an empirical claim about the geological record, in contrast to his earlier claim that [...] "The paleontological evidence can be argued about, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> qualified to judge it." [...] It is this particular commitment that Eldredge and Gould have aimed to overturn.|$|E

500|$|The album saw {{the band}} take on {{much more of}} a commercially {{influenced}} sound, and also the appearance of Moog synthesizers, while being lyrically focused on a comedic approach, as with [...] "Seven Days in the Sun", but also dark emotions, such as those shown on [...] "Turn", [...] "Oxygen", and [...] "Satellite News". It was during the campaign for Echo Park that the band played another slot on the main stage at the Reading and Leeds festival, including T in the Park. As of August 2003, the album has shipped 300,000 units in the UK going platinum, with counter sales standing at 293,000 as of February 2005. Grant said in a Melody Maker interview that if the album did not sell well enough the band would probably split up; he said at the time that [...] "It's the same with any band. That's just the way the music business is. There is only {{a certain amount of money}} a label will put into a band. I'm just being realistic. We've been around for seven or eight years <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> planning on giving up, but we're putting everything into this record and I'm just hoping that people like it". The album campaign helped the band in August 2001 win the [...] "Best British Live Act" [...] accolade at the Kerrang! awards, before ending the year supporting the Stereophonics, and then releasing the [...] "Just a Day" [...] single in December. In February 2015, [...] "Buck Rogers" [...] gained a silver certification for 200,000 physical sales, digital downloads and streaming points combined.
