40|$|Abstract — We {{present the}} QuestMonitor system, which <b>allows</b> <b>to</b> {{visualize}} dynamic networks, and monitor {{the execution of}} protocols written in a data centric and declarative language: Netlog.

Nevertheless, their behavior is sometimes tricky to understand in dynamic networks. QuestMonitor, <b>allows</b> <b>to</b> monitor all the communication between the nodes, {{the evolution of the}} data stores on each node, as well as the execution of the declarative code. It also <b>allows</b> <b>to</b> color the virtual data structures, such as routes, backbones, etc. It <b>allowed</b> us <b>to</b> identify flaws in programs.

Hester was <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> keep number 23, a number normally used for cornerbacks, since it sits outside the 50-79 range. Along with former Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Dwight Stone, who wore number 20 during his eight-year stint in Pittsburgh, Hester was one of two wide receivers to wear a 20's jersey number since the NFL adopted the current uniform numbering system in 1973.|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} of microwaves <b>allows</b> <b>to</b> overcome technical hitches {{related to the}} regeneration of soot-filters <b>allowing</b> <b>to</b> perform it independently on the engine operating conditions. The performance of a SiC foam filter during microwave regeneration was investigated with and without a catalyst coating. The regeneration efficiency and the energy required for regeneration were evaluated for catalytic and uncatalytic SiC foams by varying the operating conditions of soot trapping. Results showed that for both catalytic foams, Fe/V/K and Cu/V/K, the capability to be heated independently {{of the amount of}} soot <b>allows</b> <b>to</b> maintain temperature sufficiently high to perform a complete foam filter regeneration. Moreover, the microwave absorbing properties of the catalytic phases <b>allow</b> <b>to</b> perform regeneration with a lower energy consumption with respect to the uncatalytic case. The presence of a catalyst also <b>allows</b> <b>to</b> overcome the dependence of microwave-assisted regeneration process on the operating conditions of soot loading...|$|R
