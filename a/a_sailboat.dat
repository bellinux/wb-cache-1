5|$|September 26, 1992– Tropical Storm Danielle moves inland {{over the}} Delmarva Peninsula, causing up to 3inches (8cm) of rain along the coast. The storm also causes {{moderate}} tidal flooding {{of up to}} 7.2feet in Atlantic City and minor beach erosion. Strong waves {{off the coast of}} New Jersey sank <b>a</b> <b>sailboat,</b> causing the death of its driver.|$|E
5|$|West of Haiti, the {{hurricane}} brought hurricane-force winds to Cuba. A fisherman {{on the eastern}} tip of Cuba was killed by rough seas while trying to secure his boats. Since {{the hurricane}} passed largely east of the Bahamas, only minor damage was reported there. Hazel passed directly over Inagua, where it claimed six lives when <b>a</b> <b>sailboat</b> capsized while taking shelter from the storm.|$|E
5|$|After {{reaching}} peak intensity, Frances began tracking over cooler SST's, which gradually {{weakened the}} storm. The eye featured became indistinct and by late on October 25, Frances was downgraded to a tropical storm. Over {{the next two}} days, Frances began losing tropical characteristics, and was declared extratropical by early on October 27. One sailor was reported missing, however, it is unknown if it was {{as a result of}} Frances. In addition, one person on <b>a</b> <b>sailboat</b> suffered injuries during an encounter with Frances. On land, Frances caused minimal impact, limited to light rainfall across Newfoundland.|$|E

5|$|If {{one game}} is played as a sequel to the other by a linked password, Twinrova captures Princess Zelda, {{lighting}} the Flame of Despair. Link enters a warp point by the Maku Tree and faces Twinrova, who is attempting to use the three Flames to revive Ganon, the primary antagonist in the Zelda series. Link defeats both Twinrova and a mindless, poorly resurrected Ganon. He frees Zelda, whose sacrifice {{would have been the}} full resurrection of Ganon; together, they exit the crumbling castle. After the credits, Link is seen waving to a crowd from <b>a</b> <b>sailboat</b> off the shore of a land with a castle in the background.|$|E
5|$|Josephine {{also caused}} major effects to marine interests. High waves, {{estimated}} to have exceeded 15ft (4.6m), disabled <b>a</b> <b>sailboat</b> with a crew of six on it. They were quickly rescued after issuing a distress signal to a nearby tanker vessel. The storm caused the loss of 1,799bags of sorghum from water damage when a freighter encountered Josephine en route to Baltimore, Maryland. The major shipping lanes of North America were severely impacted, with more than 25 ships reporting winds of at least 58mph (93km/h) {{over a period of}} nine days. Furthermore, at least five of those ships reported hurricane force winds during a period of six days. The highest wind speed reported from a ship was 92mph (148km/h), which was observed on October16.|$|E
5|$|The {{flooding}} on Mangaia {{was regarded}} as the worst in almost 50years, as nearly the entire island was affected. According to locals, the ocean surrounding the island became red at one point due {{to the amount of}} soil being washed out to sea. Despite initial reports that the local water supply was contaminated, the International Federation of Red Cross And Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) stated that it was safe to drink and there was a sufficient amount for all of the islands' 744 residents. Offshore, <b>a</b> <b>sailboat</b> was severely damaged by large swells produced by the storm and {{was on the verge of}} sinking. The sailor managed to secure the vessel and make it safely to shore.|$|E

5|$|The outer {{bands of}} Hurricane Dean {{produced}} heavy rainfall and winds up to 75mph (121km/h) across Antigua and Barbuda. There was no reported {{damage in the}} Leeward Islands or the Virgin Islands since the hurricane turned northward. In the Atlantic, <b>a</b> <b>sailboat</b> bound for Bermuda was caught off guard by the hurricane. The boat, which carried no radio equipment, was spotted by a hurricane hunter plane. The occupants of the boat suffered no injuries. In Bermuda, the hurricanes eastern eyewall produced 81mph (130km/h) sustained winds with gusts up to 113mph (182km/h). Bermuda highest rainfall total from Dean was 2.45in (50.8mm) while parts of the island received 3-5in (76.2–127mm) of rain.|$|E
5|$|The victims' {{bodies were}} found {{floating}} in Tampa Bay on June 4, 1989. The first body was found when several people on board <b>a</b> <b>sailboat,</b> crossing under the Sunshine Skyway, saw an object in the water. The second body was seen floating off the pier in St. Petersburg, two miles north from the first. While the Coast Guard went to recover the second body, a call came in about a third, which was seen floating 200 yards to the east. All three female {{bodies were found}} face down, bound with a rope around the neck, and naked below the waist.|$|E
5|$|The outer {{fringes of}} Hurricane Dean swept over Haiti {{bringing}} heavy squalls. On Gonâve Island, {{thousands of people}} lost power and some took shelter in schools and churches. The roof of the Hopital St. Michel in Jacmel, damaged before the storm, leaked significantly leading to water damage in the operating room. Two {{people were killed in}} Tiburon and Moron, towns in the south and southeast of the island, respectively. Seven other storm-related deaths were confirmed but few details were given. Another four were injured in <b>a</b> <b>sailboat</b> after disregarding warnings to stay in port. Several hundred homes were destroyed due to the resulting landslides. In the department of Sud-Est, Nippes, Centre, and Artibonite, 5,154people retreated to temporary shelters. Hurricanes typically pose significant hazards to potable water in Haiti, but Hurricane Dean produced only a modest 2.06inches (52mm) of rainfall. As such, the storm caused no major problems with water and sanitation, except in the town of Bainet, where the temperamental water system was compromised.|$|E

5|$|In Florida, {{waves of}} over 10feet (3m) in height capsized a boat near Lantana; the two {{occupants}} were rescued without injury. Additionally, the waves displaced <b>a</b> <b>sailboat</b> {{that had previously}} been washed ashore in Juno Beach. Large waves flooded a parking lot and destroyed several fences and tree branches at Jupiter Beach, which resulted in its temporary closure; nearby a maintenance shed was destroyed. Eight leatherback sea turtle nests in Boca Raton were destroyed after the surf reached the dunes. Due to high surf, the beach pier at Flagler Beach was closed for about a day. Minor to moderate beach erosion caused the Florida Department of Transportation to fill in areas near the seawall with sand. One death occurred when a surfer drowned in the rough waves off the coast at New Smyrna Beach in Volusia County. Outer rainbands produced light rainfall, with the highest report in the Jacksonville National Weather Service area of responsibility totaling 0.77inches (20mm); the bands also caused tropical storm force wind gusts in the northeastern portion of the state. The winds spread smoke from local brush fires through the Tampa Bay area to Miami. High winds from Andrea were reported as fueling severe wildfires in northern Florida and southern Georgia.|$|E
5|$|The extratropical {{remnants}} of Barry produced gusty winds along the Atlantic coastline which peaked at 60mph (97km/h) near Charleston, South Carolina. Around 200houses in Craven County, North Carolina, were without power after winds downed a power line. In North Carolina, adverse conditions {{from the storm}} delayed an elimination baseball game between the East Carolina University and Western Carolina University teams. In southeastern Virginia, the {{remnants of}} Barry caused over 60traffic accidents, which resulted in 10injuries. Rough seas off of Cape Fear left <b>a</b> <b>sailboat</b> containing three people requiring rescue from the Coast Guard. Rainfall extended into the Mid-Atlantic states through New England, with 4.50inches (113mm) reported at Absecon, New Jersey, 3.91inches (99mm) recorded near Central Park, New York, and 3.19inches (81mm) at Taunton, Massachusetts. The remnants of Tropical Storm Barry contributed to heavy rainfall and flooding in the Finger Lakes region of New York State. Roads and several driveways were washed out. Flash flooding was also reported in southeast New York, and high wind gusts caused sporadic tree damage. In New Jersey, northeast onshore flow associated with the remnants of Barry produced high tides and minor coastal flooding.|$|E

25|$|The main {{by-product}} of enrichment is depleted uranium (DU), principally the U-238 isotope, with a U-235 content of ~0.3%. It is stored, either as UF6 or as U3O8. Some {{is used in}} applications where its extremely high density makes it valuable such as anti-tank shells, and {{on at least one}} occasion even <b>a</b> <b>sailboat</b> keel. It is also used with plutonium for making mixed oxide fuel (MOX) and to dilute, or downblend, highly enriched uranium from weapons stockpiles which is now being redirected to become reactor fuel.|$|E
