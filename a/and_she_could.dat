5|$|Additionally, the Portland-class cruisers were {{designed}} with space to be outfitted as fleet flagships, with accommodations for an Admiral {{and his staff}} to operate. The class also featured two aircraft catapult amidships, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> carry four aircraft which were stored in a hangar. Her total crew complement varied, with a regular designed crew complement of 848, a wartime complement of 952, and a complement 1,229 when the cruiser was operating as a fleet flagship.|$|E
5|$|During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, Kursura {{operated}} in the Arabian Sea. She {{was given the}} patrol duties at two designated areas before the war started, but was ordered to operate under two restrictions: she was not to cross demarcated shipping corridors <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> attack a target only after positive identification. The aims of her patrol were to sink any Pakistani naval warships, to sink merchant shipping when specifically ordered, and to conduct general patrol and surveillance.|$|E
5|$|Foster and Eddy {{finally arrived}} at Truckee Lake on March 14, {{where they found}} their {{children}} dead. Keseberg told Eddy that he had eaten the remains of Eddy's son, and Eddy swore to murder Keseberg if they ever met in California. George Donner and one of Jacob Donner's children were still alive at Alder Creek. Tamsen Donner had just arrived at the Murphy cabin, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have walked out alone but chose {{to return to her}} husband, even though she was informed that no other relief party was likely to be coming soon. Foster and Eddy {{and the rest of the}} third relief left with four children, Trudeau, and Clark.|$|E
50|$|Prior to {{the release}} of Inquisition, Kimberly Wallace of Game Informer {{considered}} the potential of her return to the series, <b>and</b> thought <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be interesting due to the mystery surrounding her, what <b>she</b> <b>could</b> bring to the group, <b>and</b> how <b>she</b> <b>could</b> develop.|$|R
60|$|And moreover, if now <b>and</b> then <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{have a good}} {{talk with}} someone {{understanding}} <b>and</b> intelligent, someone <b>she</b> <b>could</b> trust, someone who cared {{enough for her to}} think with her and for her....|$|R
60|$|Her painful hesitancy brought Frona to a {{realization}} {{of her own}} thoughtlessness. But she had made the step, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> knew <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not retrace it.|$|R
5|$|It is {{not clear}} when Taft met Helen Herron (often called Nellie), {{but it was no}} later than 1880, when she {{mentioned}} in her diary receiving an invitation to a party from him. By 1884, they were meeting regularly, and in 1885, after an initial rejection, she agreed to marry him. The wedding took place at the Herron home on June 19, 1886. William Taft remained devoted to his wife throughout their almost 44 years of marriage. Nellie Taft pushed her husband much as his parents had, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be very frank with her criticisms. The couple had three children, of which the eldest, Robert, became a U.S. senator.|$|E
5|$|Operation Paravane was a British {{air raid}} of World War II that inflicted heavy {{damage on the}} German {{battleship}} Tirpitz. The attack was conducted on 15 September 1944 by 21 Royal Air Force heavy bombers, which flew from an airfield {{in the north of}} the Soviet Union. The battleship was struck by one bomb, and further damaged by several near misses. This damage rendered Tirpitz unfit for combat, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not be repaired as it was no longer possible for the Germans to sail her to a major port.|$|E
5|$|The bow {{section was}} badly damaged, but not irreparably so, {{and the rest}} of the ship, {{including}} the boilers and engines, were not damaged at all. It was determined that if the ship could be lightened, the tide would then lift her off the bottom <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be sailed to port. With this in mind, three days later, on 20 March, the cargo was unloaded into small coastal freighters. Initially, it appeared that the attempt would succeed, but a week later, after various other vessels had attempted to pull Suevic off the rocks, the weather deteriorated, and waves drove her farther onto shore, from whence she could not be moved.|$|E

5|$|In {{classical}} Athenian marriages, {{husband or}} wife could legally initiate a divorce. The woman's closest male relative (who {{would be her}} kyrios if she were not married) could also do so, apparently even against the couple's wishes. After divorce, the husband was required to return the dowry or pay 18 percent interest annually so the woman's livelihood would continue <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> remarry. If there were children {{at the time of}} the divorce, they remained in their father's house and he remained responsible for their upbringing. If a woman committed adultery, her husband was legally required to divorce her. A married epikleros would be divorced so she could marry her nearest relative.|$|E
5|$|Sarah's frankness and {{indifference}} for rank, so admired by Anne earlier in their friendship, was now {{seen to be}} intrusive. Unlike most women of the time—many of whom did not have influence with their own husbands—Sarah had a powerful intimacy with the two most powerful men in the country, Marlborough and Godolphin. Godolphin, though a great friend of Sarah's, had even considered refusing high office after Anne's accession, preferring to live quietly {{and away from the}} political side of Sarah, who was bossy, interfering, and presumed to tell him what to do when Marlborough was away. Sarah, although a woman in a man's world of national and international politics, was always ready to give her advice; express her opinions; antagonize with outspoken censure; and insist on having her say on every possible occasion. However, she had a charm and vivaciousness which was admired by many; <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> easily delight those she met with her wit.|$|E
5|$|The emperor's most {{powerful}} relative was the empress dowager, widow {{to the previous}} emperor and usually the natural mother of the emperor. If the grandmother of an emperor—the grand empress dowager—was still alive during his reign, she enjoyed a superior position over the empress dowager. Emperors often sought {{the approval of the}} empress dowager for their decisions. If an emperor was only a child, he acted merely as a figurehead while the empress dowager dominated court politics. She not only had the right to issue edicts and pardons, but if the emperor died without a designated heir, she had the sole right to appoint a new emperor. Below the empress dowager were the empress and imperial concubines. Although she was the wife of the emperor, the empress's position at court was not secure <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be removed by the emperor. However, the empress did enjoy the submission of concubines as her subordinates, who advocated the elevation of their sons over the empress's at their own peril.|$|E

60|$|So <b>she</b> started up, <b>and</b> finding <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{grow faster}} than he, <b>she</b> wound round <b>and</b> round him {{until she had}} passed up all the line she had. The oak, however, {{continued}} to grow, <b>and</b> as <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not disengage her coils, she was just lifted out by the root. So that ends the oak-and-ivy business, and removes a powerful temptation from {{the path of the}} young writer.|$|R

5|$|Zenobia: {{the wife}} of Odaenathus was accused by the Augustan History of having {{formerly}} conspired with Maeonius, as Hairan I was her stepson <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not accept {{that he was the}} heir to her husband instead of her own children. However, there is no suggestion in the Augustan History that Zenobia was involved in the event that saw her husband's murder; the act is attributed to Maeonius' degeneracy and jealousy. Those accounts by the Augustan History can be dismissed as fiction. The hints in modern scholarship that Zenobia had a hand in the assassination out of her desire to rule the empire and dismay with her husband's pro-Roman policy can be dismissed as there was no reversal of that policy during the first years following Odaenathus' death.|$|E
5|$|Historian Ban Zhao (45116 CE) {{wrote in}} her Lessons for Women that, like the {{opposite}} and complementary forces of yin and yang, men's great virtues were strength and rigidity, while a woman's great virtues were respect and compliance. Throughout her life, a Han woman was to bend {{to the will of}} first her father, then her husband, and then her adult son (三從四德). However, there are many recorded deviations from this rule, as some Han women are written to have engaged in heated arguments with their husbands over concubines (sometimes beating concubines out of jealousy and to punish the husband), wrote essays and letters for husbands serving as government officials, and sometimes husbands turned to their wives for advice on political affairs of the court. When a father died, the eldest son was theoretically the senior member of the family, yet as hinted in various works of Han literature, they still had to obey the will of their mother <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> even force them to kowtow to her when apologizing for an offense. Deviations from common customs regarding gender were especially pronounced in the imperial family. The empress was able to give orders to her male relatives (even her father) and if they disobeyed her, she could publicly reprimand and humiliate them.|$|E
25|$|On March 17, 1899 a board {{appointed}} by the Secretary of the Treasury consisting of two Survey officer, two Revenue-Marine Service officers and a United States local inspector of boilers made trial runs on the new ship which demonstrated compliance with requirements. The minimum specified speed of twelve knots was bettered <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> make more than thirteen knots under forced draft.|$|E

25|$|In 1161, Melisende {{had what}} appears to be a stroke. Her memory was {{severely}} impaired <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> no longer take part in state affairs. Her sisters, the countess of Tripoli and abbess of Bethany, came to nurse her before she died on 11 September 1161. Melisende was buried next to her mother Morphia in the shrine of Our Lady of Josaphat. Melisende, like her mother, bequeathed property to the Orthodox monastery of Saint Sabbas.|$|E
25|$|In June 2011, Elliott told People {{magazine}} that her {{absence from the}} music industry was due to a hyperthyroidism disorder known as Graves' disease. She was diagnosed after she nearly crashed a car from having severe leg spasms while driving. She experienced severe symptoms from the condition, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not even hold a pen up to write songs. After treatment, her symptoms stabilized, and she has announced that {{she would like to}} get back to her career.|$|E
25|$|Praed {{never lost}} her {{interest}} in her native country and though {{most of her life}} was passed in England, a large proportion of her novels were based on her Australian experiences. Others dealt with the occult, with spiritualism, or with abnormal states of mind. She was much interested in psychological problems, her character-drawing is good although her women are better than her men, she had some sense of humour, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> tell a story. She is entitled to a leading place among the Australian novelists who developed in the nineteenth century.|$|E

25|$|Sufia {{was born}} in Shaestabad, Barisal. She was a {{daughter}} of a Zamindar family. During her childhood, women's education was prohibited <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not afford to get academic education. But she learned Bengali, Hindi, English, Urdu, Arabic, Kurdish and Persian language from her house tutors. In 1918, she went to Kolkata with her mother where she came to meet with Begum Rokeya. She was first married {{at the age of}} 11 to her cousin Syed Nehal Hossain, then a law student. They had a daughter, Amena Kahar. Hossain died in 1932. Five years later, Sufia married Kamaluddin Ahmed.|$|E
25|$|In late December 1934 the Ulmarra {{was partly}} disabled, {{by the loss}} of a {{propeller}} blade when the blade was snapped off when it came into contact with a submerged object in the Clarence River the Nimbin came to assistance and towed the Ulmarra the voyage of nearly 300 miles. The master of the Ulmarra (Captain Bysanton) said that the Ulmarra was not rendered helpless by the accident, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>could,</b> if necessary, have steamed unaided, but as the motor ship Nimbin, was coming down to Sydney from Richmond River it was considered advisable for her to assist. During the long tow the Ulmarra was able to run her engines, and at times a speed of well lover 11 knots was attained.|$|E
25|$|During {{the later}} part of Genie's {{stay at the}} {{hospital}} she also started engaging in physical play with adults, and eventually began to enjoy giving and receiving hugs. She continued to exhibit frustration and have tantrums, but these were more typical of behavior found in most young children, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> sulk {{for a long time}} despite receiving an object she liked. In April 1971, to the great surprise of doctors she began attacking another girl because she felt she owned the hospital dress the other girl had on. This was both her first exhibition of a sense of possession over items she thought were hers but was otherwise impartial towards and the first time she directed her anger outwards, but she did not entirely stop harming herself when angry.|$|E
