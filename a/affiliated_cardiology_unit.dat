In this study, we investigated the indications for transthoracic echocardiography and spectrum of cardiac disease found in patients referred to our cardiac unit for echocardiography. Methods: A prospective two-dimensional, pulsed, continuous, and color-flow Doppler echocardiographic evaluation was done using the transthoracic approach in 2501 patients over an eight-year period. Univariate data analysis was performed for mean age, gender, clinical indications, and diagnoses. Results: The subject age range was less than 12 months to 97 years (mean 52. 39 years). There were 1352 (54. 06 %) males and 1149 (45. 94 %) females. The most common indication for echocardiography was hypertension (52. 1 %) followed by congestive cardiac failure (13. 9 %). Others were for screening (6. 1 %), arrhythmias (5 %), cerebrovascular disease (5 %), chest pain (3. 3 %), chronic kidney disease (3. 2 %), congenital heart disease (2. 6 %), cardiomyopathy (1. 8 %), rheumatic heart disease (1. 7 %), diabetes mellitus (1. 3 %), thyrocardiac disease (1. 2 %), ischemic heart disease (1. 2 %), and pericardial disease (1. 1 %). The echocardiographic diagnosis was hypertensive heart disease in 59. 4 % of subjects and normal in 14. 1 %. Other echocardiographic diagnoses included rheumatic heart disease (3. 1 %), congenital heart disease (2. 1 %), cardiomyopathy (1. 7 %), pericardial disease (1. 1 %), and ischemic heart disease (0. 1 %).

Abstract OBJECTIVE: To evaluate cardiac {{involvement in}} children with metabolic disease in the out patient clinic of the Pediatric <b>Cardiology</b> <b>Unit</b> of Maria Pia Children's Hospital and their follow-up. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-nine medical records belonging to out patients with metabolic disease in consultation at our unit were reviewed. The following data from each record was analyzed: sex, metabolic disease diagnosis, age and motive for referral to a pediatric <b>cardiology</b> <b>unit,</b> <b>cardiology</b> diagnosis, therapy and evolution. RESULTS: Seventeen patients were boys and 12 girls. The average age of referral was 7. 2 years (SD 4. 8). The motives for referral were: screening for heart disease, 16; heart murmur, 7; congestive heart failure, 3; heart murmur and fatigue, 2; poor weight gain, 1. The following metabolic diagnoses were made: lysosomal diseases, 21; mitochondrial citopathies, 5; disorder of beta-oxidation of fatty acids, 2; carbohydrate deficient glycoprotein syndrome (CDG syndrome), 1. The cardiologic evaluation was normal in ten patients (4 with lysosomal disease, 4 with mitochondrial citopathy, one disorder of beta-oxidation of fatty acids, the CDG syndrome). Mitral and aortic valve lesions predominated in lysosomal diseases (12 / 21); myocardial involvement alone was present in two patients, and both myocardial and valvular lesions were present in three. Dilated cardiomyopathy was the presented manifestation in two patients-one with mitochondrial citopathy and one with a disorder of beta-oxidation of fatty acids. Three patients died and 26 remain out-patients. One patient was submitted to valve surgery. The average duration of follow-up was 21 months (SD 24). COMMENTS: Lysosomal diseases were the most representative in our patients, {{as described in the}} literature. Heart valve disease was the most frequent alteration. Indication for heart valve surgery is dependent on systemic involvement of the primary disease. All children with a metabolic disease with eventual heart involvement should be evaluated periodically by a <b>cardiology</b> <b>unit.</b> On the other hand, it is mandatory to screen a cardiomyopathy of unknown cause for a metabolic disease.

MATERIAL AND METHOD: Descriptive transversal cut study. 103 medical records of DPM diagnosed patients were analyzed by simple random sampling in the <b>Cardiology</b> <b>Unit</b> of the La Serena Regional Hospital. Patients with electrical impulse generation disorders and/or hearth electrical conduction abnormalities aged > 18 years old were included. Data collecting and analyzing were realized by Microsoft Excel 2007. The studied variables included: sex, age, rurality, disease, clinical symptoms, {{presence or absence of}} Chagas Disease and cardiopathies. Odss Ratio (OR) was calculated in significant differences situations in order to evaluate risk associated. A p< 0. 05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Of the total of patients, 47. 1 % was women.

Discrepancies were classified as justified (e. g., based on the pharmacotherapeutic guidelines of the hospital studied) or unintentional. Treatments were reviewed within 48 hours following hospitalization. Unintentional discrepancies were further classified according to the categorization of medication error severity. Pharmacists verbally contacted the prescriber to recommend actions to resolve the discrepancies. A total of 181 discrepancies were found in 50 patients (86 %). Of these discrepancies, 149 (82. 3 %) were justified changes to the patient's home medication regimen; however, 32 (17. 7 %) discrepancies found in 24 patients were unintentional.
