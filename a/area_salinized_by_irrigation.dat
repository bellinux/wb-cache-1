This groundwater body, formed during the last Wisconsin regression, extends offshore into deposits on the continental shelf. The authors found that this paleowater is slowly being <b>salinized</b> <b>by</b> downward solute transport from overlying Holocene marine clays and upward transport from saline Cretaceous sediments.

30|$|From 1977 to 1982, {{value of}} {{pressurized}} irrigation has been increased therefore; a minor decreasing is observable for area waterlogged. However, value of <b>area</b> <b>salinized</b> has been increased due to increase of agricultural water withdrawal and consequently {{a part of}} it that is used for irrigation. From 1982 to 1987, localized irrigation has been increased (Pollok et al. 1990) hence; value of area waterlogged has been diminished. Also, percentage of area equipped for irrigation salinized has been increased due to increase of agricultural water withdrawal again. From 1987 to 1992, pressurized irrigation and agricultural water withdrawal have been increased. Hence, percentage of area equipped for irrigation salinized has been increased and area waterlogged has been decreased. From 1992 to 1997, values of surface irrigation (in comparison with pressurized irrigation), area waterlogged, agricultural water withdrawal, and percentage of area equipped for irrigation salinized, have been increased due to lack of appropriate management in the previous years and high costs as well as the dilemmas of these systems (Biswas 1986; Famoriyo 1984; Alam 1991). Note that NRI has been decreased from 1992 to 1997 and this indicates highlighted role of increase of surface irrigation (Houk et al. 2006). From 1997 to 2002, problems occurred in the previous period raised tendency to use of pressurized irrigation systems afresh but with a reasonable approach and competent management (Qadir and Oster 2004). This approach led to increase of pressurized irrigation as well as decrease of area waterlogged <b>by</b> <b>irrigation.</b> From 2002 to 2007, pressurized irrigation was still growing (Kigalu et al. 2008; Karlberg et al. 2007; Kheira 2009 b) and values of area waterlogged <b>by</b> <b>irrigation</b> and percentage of area equipped for irrigation salinized were decreased due to suitable management and decrease of agricultural water withdrawal. From 2007 to 2011, we could see a fall in agricultural water withdrawal (however, this index is allowable to increase if a suitable use), percentage of area equipped for irrigation <b>salinized,</b> and <b>area</b> waterlogged and a growth in spate irrigation that needs to specific attention to deal with sedimentation (Embaye et al. 2012). The good event is raise of localized irrigation and its considerable impact on water conservation (Ward and Pulido-Velazquez 2008). However, value of conservation agriculture area is not desirable yet. In the final step, cropping intensity (area equipped) has been studied for Africa in the previous half of century.|$|R
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the increased risk of <b>salinized</b> <b>by</b> the sea-level rise, the freshwater lens is at risk from over extraction due to the large population that now occupies Fongafale islet; the increased extraction can be exacerbated by a decrease of the rainfall recharge rate associated with the climate change. Water pollution is also a chronic problem, with domestic wastewater identified as the primary pollution source. [...] Approximately 92% of households on Fongafale islet have access to septic tanks and pit toilets. However these sanitary facilities are not built as per the design specifications or they are not suitable for the geophysical characteristics, which results in seepage into the fresh water lens and run off into coastal waters.|$|R

40|$|Root system {{hydraulic}} conductivity (LP) was measured on soybean (Glycine max [L. ] Merr. var Harosoy) seedlings grown in solution culture and exposed to {{varying levels of}} osmotic stress. Hydroponic growth solutions were <b>salinized</b> <b>by</b> additions of NaCl, and the permeability of excised seedling root systems to water was measured. Conductance was estimated at high rates of water flux, where osmotic effects are negligible. LP was reduced as the salinity of the growth solution increased. Growth in NaCl for 14 days at − 0. 17 megapascals and − 0. 26 megapascals resulted in reductions in LP from that of controls by 27 % and 72 %, respectively. LP was correlated with the root/shoot biomass ratio (RS), with larger values of LP observed in seedlings with lower RS...|$|R

40|$|Europe {{has a long}} {{continental}} and island coastline {{along which}} many human activities are concentrated. Coastal aquifer development is often intensive and subject to salinity problems {{as a result of}} seawater intrusion, upconing of deep saline water, and residual salinity in aquitards. These coastal aquifers are important freshwater sources that risk being <b>salinized</b> <b>by</b> different processes. Often important coastal aquifers are of relatively small size but crucial to supply human needs, which vary from mostly urban and industrial supply in mid to high latitudes, to dominantly seasonal for irrigation and tourism in the Mediterranean area and many of the islands. To prevent quality loss through salinization, management is needed. This is a complex objective, full of difficulties and with scarce experience. Solutions are highly dependent on local circumstances. Some aquifers are carefully studied, monitored and managed. Examples can be found in different countries, such as The Netherlands, Belgium, and northeastern Spain. Postprint (published version...|$|R
