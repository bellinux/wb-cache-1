This event is said to have changed Stuart's demeanour <b>and</b> <b>plunged</b> him into a depression. He never again took time off work and left his children to the sole care and maintenance of his four maiden sisters in England. In 1934 he took over his last and most important seagoing role as Commodore of the CPS fleet and was placed in command of the 42,000-ton liner RMS Empress of Britain on her transatlantic route.|$|E

5|$|Making for the harbour mouth, the British ship's bow {{and stern}} {{alternately}} rose <b>and</b> <b>plunged</b> into the incoming waves; the propeller at times was spinning in air, requiring a careful hand on the throttle to keep the shaft from running away to destruction. Green seas were boarding the vessel and running {{the length of the}} deck. There were ten men on the wheel and more below handling relieving tackle on the tiller to assist in maintaining control of the rudder. Taking two hours to travel four cables, the cruiser finally escaped the anchorage into the open sea, an achievement not known to Calliopes crew for some time, as sea spray and spume had reduced visibility to nothing.|$|E
5|$|Murdoch {{had been}} {{concerned}} lest {{he and his}} men should be engaged when they reached the Kapyong River in an exhausted condition and with little ammunition. Luck was with the Australians, and due to difficulties of communication and navigation along the ridge line in the dark, elements of A Company had become separated and the last two platoons descended to the river too early to strike the ford. However, reaching a deserted part of the bank they realised their mistake and immediately turned west again, following the river-bank to the ford. The Chinese did not follow this sudden final turn <b>and</b> <b>plunged</b> on into the river, giving A Company an unexpected opportunity to break free. The Chinese were subsequently detected by the Canadians on Hill 677 and were fired on. Fortunately for the Australians, the Canadian fire did not hit them. This possibility had been foreseen earlier; however, problems with the radio relay between the Canadians and Australians meant that there had been no guarantee that the withdrawing force would not be mistaken for Chinese as they crossed the river.|$|E

25|$|The {{clock in}} the {{building}} tower was originally mechanical in nature, and kept accurate time via gravity. A cable was wrapped around a drum, and a large weight attached {{to the end of}} the cable. As the cable unwound due to the force of gravity, the clock hands turned. The cable was rewound once or twice a day. On October 10, 1956, the weight came loose from the cable <b>and</b> <b>plunged</b> through two floors (narrowly avoiding killing a man, who had just gotten up from his desk). The mechanical clock was later replaced with an electric one.|$|E

According to Pynchon, in February 1891 he and geologist Herbert Marshall of the USGS were conducting geologic research in the Hanging Hills when they saw the dog. Pynchon had seen the dog once before. Marshall, who had seen the dog twice, scoffed at the legend. Shortly after the two of them saw the dog, Marshall slipped on the ice atop one of the cliffs <b>and</b> <b>plunged</b> to his death. His body was recovered by authorities.

40|$|Fluid physics {{associated}} with a pitching <b>and</b> <b>plunging</b> airfoil, while critical {{to the development of}} flapping wing air vehicles, is not adequately understood. To help assess the state-of-the-art of engineering predictive tools, we utilize recently obtained experimental information based on particle image velocimetry (PIV) in a water tunnel from two different facilities {{to examine the effects of}} chord Reynolds number, and the airfoil shape on the associated flow structures. Two rigid airfoils, SD 7003 and flat plate, undergoing pitching <b>and</b> <b>plunging</b> motion in nominally two-dimensional conditions are investigated with the aid of the original Menter's Shear Stress Transport (SST) turbulence model and a modified version which limits the production of turbulence kinetic energy to reduce the build-up of turbulence in stagnation regions. We consider two kinematic schemes, a pitching <b>and</b> <b>plunging,</b> <b>and</b> a pure <b>plunging</b> motion. For the SD 7003 airfoil under pitching <b>and</b> <b>plunging</b> motion, the original SST model offers consistently favorable agreement with both PIV measurements. For the pure plunging SD 7003 airfoil case, depending on the turbulence characteristics including those caused the motion of the wing, and the implied eddy viscosity level, qualitatively different flow structures are observed experimentally and computationally. The flat plate creates flow fields insensitive to the Reynolds number, and quite different from those around the SD 7003 airfoil, due to the leading edge effect.
