5|$|Visual {{differentiation}} {{from the}} fish crow (C. ossifragus) {{is extremely difficult}} and often inaccurate. Nonetheless, differences apart from size do exist. Fish crows {{tend to have more}} slender bills and feet. There may also be a small sharp hook {{at the end of the}} upper bill. Fish crows also appear <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> shorter legs when walking. More dramatically, when calling, fish crows tend to hunch and fluff their throat feathers.|$|E
5|$|Deborah Jean Lodge and colleagues, in a {{reorganization}} of the family Hygrophoraceae based on molecular phylogenetics, proposed that H.appalachianensis should be the type species of the new section Pseudofirmae in genus Hygrocybe. Species in this section, which include Hygrocybe chloochlora, H.rosea, and H.trinitensis, have sticky or glutinous caps that often have perforations in the center. Their spores and basidia are dimorphic (of two sizes), {{and the development of}} the microbasidia and macrobasidia is often staggered. The macrobasidia are club shaped and appear <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> a stalk.|$|E
25|$|Occupational {{stress is}} stress related to one's job. Occupational stress often stems from {{unexpected}} responsibilities and pressures {{that do not}} align with a person's knowledge, skills, or expectations, inhibiting one's ability to cope. Occupational stress can increase when workers do not feel supported by supervisors or colleagues, or feel <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> little control over work processes.|$|E

5000|$|In 1995, Victoria Husted Medvec and two colleagues {{reported}} that [...] "athletes {{who had just}} won silver medals tended to be less happy {{than those who had}} just won bronze medals." [...] The researchers explained this as follows: silver medalists felt <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> just missed out on a gold, while bronze medalists felt <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> almost not won anything.|$|R

25|$|While {{most would}} see the lions as {{aggressive}} and dangerous, the lions of Gir rarely attack people. They live in a very close proximity to people, which makes their behavior different almost <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> an acquaintanceship with the neighboring people. The lions who remember being hunted have now taken the higher road and stopped the circle of life.|$|E
25|$|To prevent {{dehydration}} {{readily available}} fluids, preferably {{with a modest}} amount of sugars and salt such as vegetable broth or salted rice water, may be used. The drinking of additional clean water is also recommended. Once dehydration develops oral rehydration solutions are preferred. As much of these drinks as the person wants can be given, unless {{there are signs of}} swelling. If vomiting occurs, fluids can be paused for 5–10 minutes and then restarting more slowly. Vomiting rarely prevents rehydration as fluid are still absorbed and the vomiting rarely last long. A severely malnourished child with what appears to be dehydration but who has not had diarrhea should be treated <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> an infection.|$|E
25|$|As {{suddenly}} as they appeared, the tourists vanish. The fugitive {{returns to the}} museum to investigate and finds no evidence of people being there during his absence. He attributes the experience to a hallucination caused by food poisoning, but the tourists reappear that night. They {{have come out of}} nowhere and yet they talk <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> been there for a while. He watches them closely while still avoiding direct contact and notices more strange things. In the aquarium he encounters identical copies of the dead fish he found on his day of arrival. During a day at the pool, he sees the tourists jump to shake off the cold when the heat is unbearable. The strangest thing he notices is the presence of two suns and two moons in the sky.|$|E

500|$|The book {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} Andrew Cayton and Janet Maslin of The New York Times. Both felt that Chernow {{had been able}} to show an intimate side of Washington that had previously been unrecognized in biographies of the man. Maslin stated that Chernow presented Washington as a [...] "more human and accessible" [...] individual, and Cayton wrote that [...] "ost readers will finish this book feeling <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> actually spent time with human beings." ...|$|E
500|$|About {{two dozen}} wigs {{are used for}} the actresses. Made of human hair and up to [...] in length, they cost up to $7,000 each and are washed and styled like real hair. Applying the wigs is time-consuming; Emilia Clarke, for example, {{requires}} about two hours to style her brunette hair with a platinum-blonde wig and braids. Other actors, such as Jack Gleeson and Sophie Turner, receive frequent hair coloring. For characters such as Daenerys (Clarke) and her Dothraki, their hair, wigs and costumes are processed to appear <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> not been washed for weeks.|$|E

500|$|Barjatya {{later told}} India Abroad, [...] "My attempt {{in this movie}} has been to reexpose the cinema-going public to the quintessential family life ... not {{to make people feel}} that they have come to see a movie, but make them feel <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> come to visit a big joint family that is {{preparing}} for a wedding". The story was constructed differently than what was popular at the time. There were no villains, violence, or battles between good and evil. From conception to finished product, the film took four years. Madhuri Dixit was paid a salary of [...] for playing the role of Nisha. Thereafter she became highest paid movie star (Males and Females) that remained till 2002.|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{included}} the {{song on the}} set-list of her 2004 Re-Invention World Tour in the military segment. She was dressed in military garments and played the electric guitar for the performance. As she sang the song, the backdrops displayed scenes of war and sex which were scrambled to appear <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> been shot with a camcorder. Kelefa Sanneh from The New York Times described the performance and the video backdrops as being reminiscent of the prisons in Abu Ghraib. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine commented that [...] "it was a hoot to see her [...] strap on an electric guitar and sing classics like 'Burning Up'." [...] Madonna also included a remixed version of the song on the 2015 Rebel Heart Tour. Similar to the Re-Invention World Tour, the singer played the electric guitar during the performance, {{dressed in a black}} short nun's outfit.|$|E
500|$|The {{interaction}} between Reynolds and Bullock was well received by critics. Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly opined that the chemistry {{between the two}} actors was [...] "fresh and irresistible." [...] Zorianna Kit of The Huffington Post exclaimed that [...] "what [...] audiences of this lite-fare comedy in their seats is the undeniable on-screen chemistry between leads Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds." [...] She continued: [...] "The two are so adept at comedy and have so much fun with one another, viewers watching The Proposal won't be able to resist their charms, even {{when some of the}} plot veers in to unnecessarily silliness." [...] Betsey Sharkley of the Los Angeles Times felt that their relationship was a [...] "cheeky update of The Taming of the Shrew." [...] She opined, [...] "Bullock's deft physical comedy, one of her most endearing qualities, is given a full run. [...] Reynolds' ability to deliver a line, or a look, with withering, surgical precision is there at every turn." [...] Giving it a one out of five stars, The Guardian writer Peter Bradshaw gave a negative reaction to the {{interaction between}} Reynolds and Bullock. Bradshaw stated: [...] "Their initial sparky detestation isn't convincing, and neither is their later thawing and romance. In each scene, it looks <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> never met before. And Margaret isn't permitted to be a convincing cow, because that would make her unsympathetic [...] Andrew can't be a total wimp, because that would be unsexy, so the fundamental comic premises of the film are fudged." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{factitious}} disorder {{is a condition}} in which a person, without a malingering motive, acts <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> an illness by deliberately producing, feigning, or exaggerating symptoms, purely to attain a patient's role. [...] Factitious disorder imposed on another ("{{factitious disorder}} by proxy", also called Munchausen's syndrome by proxy) is {{a condition in which}} a person deliberately produces, feigns, or exaggerates the symptoms of someone in their care. [...] In either case, the perpetrator's motive is to attain (for themselves or for another) a patient's role. [...] Factitious disorder differs fundamentally from malingering in that the malingerer simulates illness with a view to obtaining a material benefit or avoiding an obligation or responsibility.|$|E
2500|$|People with {{hypomania}} or mania {{may experience}} a decreased need of sleep, impaired judgment, and speak excessively and very rapidly. [...] Manic individuals {{often have a}} history of substance abuse developed over years as a form of [...] "self-medication". At the more extreme, a person in a full blown manic state can experience psychosis; a break with reality, a state in which thinking is affected along with mood. They may feel unstoppable, or <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> been [...] "chosen" [...] and are on a [...] "special mission", or have other grandiose or delusional ideas. This may lead to violent behavior and, sometimes, hospitalization in an inpatient psychiatric hospital. The severity of manic symptoms can be measured by rating scales such as the Young Mania Rating Scale, though questions remain about the reliability of these scales.|$|E
2500|$|Before Cantor, {{the notion}} of {{infinity}} was often taken as a useful abstraction which helped mathematicians reason about the finite world; for example the use of infinite limit cases in calculus. [...] The infinite was deemed to have at most a potential existence, rather than an actual existence. [...] "Actual infinity does not exist. What we call infinite is only the endless possibility of creating new objects {{no matter how many}} exist already". Carl Friedrich Gauss's views on the subject can be paraphrased as: 'Infinity {{is nothing more than a}} figure of speech which helps us talk about limits. The notion of a completed infinity doesn't belong in mathematics'. In other words, the only access we have to the infinite is through {{the notion of}} limits, and hence, we must not treat infinite sets <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> an existence exactly comparable to the existence of finite sets.|$|E
