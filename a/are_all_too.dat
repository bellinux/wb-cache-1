Mr. Milsap offers Scully a room at the local boarding house, but Scully tries the rest of the town only to be ignored by everyone; they <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>too</b> engrossed in Bible study groups. Disturbed by the turn of events, she keeps her gun close at hand. The next morning, Mr. Milsap tells Scully that there is a man who needs help downstairs. She goes with him and finds the hitchhiker from the teaser having a seizure. She advises them {{to take him to the}} hospital, but they pretend that they do not have any cars. While examining the man, Scully discovers a strange circular wound on his back. Meanwhile, Doggett calls the local sheriff and learns that Scully has not arrived yet, and so he sets out to find her.|$|E

He agrees to invite his colleagues to the house. When they come several days later, Nunung impresses all present with her piano-playing and singing. However, the men <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>too</b> old, and Nunung's grandmother insists that Sukandar find a younger man. Nenny, overhearing the conversation, suggests that they hold a party; this too is a failure, as Nunung takes {{no interest in the}} festivities.|$|E
500|$|Conway {{described}} the panel as indicating [...] "an astonishing depth of psychological insight" [...] {{for an artist}} not yet 20 years old. In its simple design and detail it shares many of the characteristics of, and is a key precursor to, Dürer's mature work. He [...] portrayed his father again in 1497, when the older man would have been around 70. He has aged noticeably in the intervening seven years: his skin is saggier, the wrinkles deeper and more pronounced. In this later portrait Dürer seems at pains to convey these effects of ageing, which <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>too</b> evident on his father's face. According to Brion, his eyes have lost their [...] "distant, mystic" [...] appearance and now seem less contented. Conway agrees, seeing traces of haggardly agitation, but holds that the two paintings convey a similar overall highly favourable and compassionate impression of the man.|$|E

500|$|David Orr of The New York Times {{describes}} Jon as [...] "a complex, {{thoughtful and}} basically good character". David Benioff and D. B. Weiss, the creators and executive {{producers of the}} television adaptation of the series, explain that Jon {{is one of several}} characters in the series who must [...] "face hard truths about the world they live in, and adapt themselves to those truths" [...] because [...] "The struggle many of them face is how to do that without losing their grip on who they are." [...] Ned Stark teaches all his children about leadership, selflessness, duty and honor. Following his father's example becomes more difficult as Jon faces challenges to his identity as a man, a Stark, and a brother of the Night's Watch. Benioff and Weiss note that [...] "Jon Snow tries to live with honor, while knowing that honor often gets his family members murdered." [...] Writing for Variety about the season 6 episode [...] "Battle of the Bastards", Laura Prudom suggests that Jon [...] "has the same shortcomings" [...] as his father: [...] "he fights with honor against opponents who <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>too</b> willing to use that predictable morality against him".|$|E
500|$|In Camelot on New Year's Day, King Arthur's {{court is}} exchanging gifts {{and waiting for}} the feasting to start when the king asks first to see or hear of an {{exciting}} adventure. A gigantic figure, entirely green in appearance and riding a green horse, rides unexpectedly into the hall. He wears no armour but bears an axe {{in one hand and a}} holly bough in the other. Refusing to fight anyone there on the grounds that they <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>too</b> weak to take him on, he insists he has come for a friendly [...] "Christmas game": someone is to strike him once with his axe on condition that the Green Knight may return the blow in a year and a day. The splendid axe will belong to whoever takes him on. Arthur himself is prepared to accept the challenge when it appears no other knight will dare, but Sir Gawain, youngest of Arthur's knights and his nephew, begs for the honour instead. The giant bends and bares his neck before him and Gawain neatly beheads him in one stroke. However, the Green Knight neither falls nor falters, but instead reaches out, picks up his severed head and remounts, holding up his bleeding head to Queen Guinevere while its writhing lips remind Gawain that the two must meet again at the Green Chapel. He then rides away. Gawain and Arthur admire the axe, hang it up as a trophy and encourage Guinevere to treat the whole matter lightly.|$|E
2500|$|One {{story told}} of Dominic {{during this time}} that expresses his sense of humour is {{that while he was}} visiting a convent of nuns who were instructing many converts, some of them male.

[...] Jennie Punter of The Globe and Mail said the film is [...] "kind of fun, but the twists and turns <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>too</b> familiar."

2500|$|In November 2001, in {{response}} to an Abu-Dhabi television broadcast depicting Ariel Sharon drinking the blood of Palestinian children, the Israeli government set up the [...] "Coordinating Forum for Countering Antisemitism," [...] headed by Deputy Foreign Minister Rabbi Michael Melchior. According to Melchior, [...] "in each and every generation antisemitism tries to hide its ugly face behind various disguises — and hatred of the State of Israel is its current disguise." [...] He added that, [...] "hate against Israel has crossed the red line, having gone from criticism to unbridled antisemitic venom, which is a precise translation of classical antisemitism whose past results <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>too</b> familiar to the entire world." ...|$|E

2500|$|In recent years, and {{especially}} since the tenure of Michael Noonan in 1994–1997, being appointed as minister has become somewhat of a [...] "poisoned chalice" [...] in government circles and a portfolio to be avoided by aspiring politicians, during his tenure Brian Cowen famously referred to the Department of Health as Angola due {{the fact that there}} were landmines everywhere. A number of scandals, mostly due to medical negligence, have meant that the minister immediately becomes identified with the scandal. For instance the Hepatitis C scandal, the withholding of baby organs without parental consent or knowledge, the Michael Neary saga in Drogheda and other high-profile medical scandals have dogged the minister and department. Additionally the minister has to deal with logistic issues not seen in other departments such as strikes, shortages and queues which <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>too</b> familiar in clinics and hospitals around the country.|$|E
2500|$|There is a {{trend to}} believe in pseudoscience more than {{scientific}} evidence. Some people believe the prevalence of pseudoscientific beliefs is due to widespread [...] "scientific illiteracy". Individuals lacking scientific literacy {{are more susceptible to}} wishful thinking, since they are likely to turn to immediate gratification powered by System 1, our default operating system which requires little to no effort. This system encourages one to accept the conclusions they believe, and reject the ones they don't. Further analysis of complex pseudoscientific phenomena require System 2, which follows rules, compares objects along multiple dimensions, and weighs options. These two systems have several other differences which are further discussed in the dual-process theory. The scientific and secular systems of morality and meaning are generally unsatisfying to most people. Humans are, by nature, a forward-minded species pursuing greater avenues of happiness and satisfaction, but we <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>too</b> frequently willing to grasp at unrealistic promises of a better life.|$|E
2500|$|In a July 2002 {{article in}} The New Yorker Gladwell {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} [...] "The Talent Myth" [...] that companies and organizations, supposedly, incorrectly follow. This work examines different managerial and administrative techniques that companies, both winners and losers, have used. He states that the misconception {{seems to be that}} management and executives <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>too</b> ready to classify employees without ample performance records and thus make hasty decisions. Many companies believe in disproportionately rewarding [...] "stars" [...] over other employees with bonuses and promotions. However with the quick rise of inexperienced workers with little in-depth performance review, promotions are often incorrectly made, putting employees into positions they should not have and keeping other more experienced employees from rising. He also points out that under this system, narcissistic personality types are more likely to climb the ladder, since {{they are more likely to}} take more credit for achievements and take less blame for failure. He states both that narcissists make the worst managers and that the system of rewarding [...] "stars" [...] eventually worsens a company's position. Gladwell states that the most successful long-term companies are those who reward experience above all else and require greater time for promotions.|$|E

2500|$|When it debuted, Fallen Angels {{received}} mixed {{to critical}} notices. In his review for the Associated Press, Scott Williams wrote, 'We're {{asking a lot}} of TV to deliver entertainment about that stylish, moral abyss. Fallen Angels delivers. It lets us look over the edge and measure our souls against the darkness". The Chicago Sun-Times gave the series two out of four stars and Ginny Holbert wrote, [...] "Part {{of the problem is}} the series' arch, self-conscious obsession with style. Instead of a '90s interpretation of film noir, [...] "Fallen Angels" [...] offers contrived, full-color cliche noir, replete with cocked fedoras, plumes of curling smoke and harsh sunlight sliced by venetian blinds". In his review for The New York Times, John J. O'Connor called it, [...] "uneven but diverting, even when just hovering around film-school level". In his review for the Houston Chronicle, Louis B. Parks wrote, [...] "The big problem with film noir homages is they usually overdo the ingredients, with none of the subtlety of the great originals. Fallen Angels has a touch of that. But the directors and actors play straight, and the adaptations, taken from the real McCoy writers, are pretty good stuff". In his review for the Washington Post, Tom Shales wrote, [...] "Creating period pieces out of their period seems to be fairly easy now for the gifted artisans of Hollywood. Even by today's commonplace high standards, however, {{the look and feel of}} the six Fallen Angels films seem transportingly authentic and sensuous, stylized in ways that evoke the milieu without spoofing it. Occasionally, the films veer into the arch and ridiculous, but overall, they at least look darn good". Newsweek magazine's David Gates wrote, [...] "no show this summer will do a better job of whisking you away from the increasingly unacceptable '90s. These half hours <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>too</b> short". Entertainment Weekly magazine's Lisa Schwarzbaum wrote, [...] "One unintended result of all this happy, naughty cigarette-puffing, however, is that, at their weakest, these films look like the work of boys (and don't be fooled, this is a boys' fantasy production) dressed up in their dads' big suits".|$|E
