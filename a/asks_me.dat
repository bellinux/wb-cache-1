500|$|At the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, Beyoncé {{performed}} [...] "Love On Top" [...] {{after having}} {{said on the}} black carpet about an hour previous to going on stage {{that she would be}} making an announcement. Before beginning her live performance, she said to the audience: [...] "Tonight I want you to stand up on your feet, I want you to feel the love that's growing inside of me", giving a hint about the news that she had alluded to on the black carpet. She took the stage in [...] "a purple spangly tuxedo jacket, black pants and white tuxedo shirt, still rocking her fierce six-inch heels of old, pregnant or not", as stated by Gil Kaufman of MTV News. As she performed, her blond hair blowing in the wind, and backed by six dancers wearing similar shimmering tuxes, Beyoncé gave new meaning to the lyrics: [...] "Now everybody <b>asks</b> <b>me</b> why I'm smiling out from ear to ear." [...] She kept her dancing to a minimum for most of the song as she held onto the microphone stand while singing [...] "Love On Top". Eventually making her way to the extended lip in front of the stage and throwing down, she encouraged the audience to put their hands together. Beyoncé ended the performance by dropping the microphone, opening her jacket, rubbing her belly, and thus announcing her pregnancy to the world.|$|E

2500|$|The album {{combines}} the downtuned riffs of nu metal/alternative metal with elements of New Jersey hardcore, hip hop, jazz and hard rock. Regarding the album's sound, rhythm guitarist Joey D'Amico remarked in September 2001 that [...] "the music is definitely emotional, but its hardcore in its roots". Songs such as [...] "Falling Down" [...] and [...] "Rejection" [...] feature a volatile brand of singing which frequently alternates between melodic crooning, rapping and more extreme vocal stylings. Jordan Plingos stated [...] "If somebody <b>asks</b> <b>me</b> what this band sounds like, I say 'go listen to 'Falling Down,' {{because it has}} everything.

2500|$|However, {{when the}} Great Railroad Strike of 1877 occurred, {{after only a}} couple of months into Grant's tour, he began {{receiving}} numerous letters from America with references to the situation, many of them expressing the general idea that a [...] "strong man fitted to cope with the emergency" [...] like himself, was presently lacking in the U.S. government. The crisis did not persist long, but Badeau estimated that if it had, Grant was likely to have returned {{out of a sense of}} duty. After the strike ended, the idea of entertaining a third attempt at a presidential nomination had quickly become an unlikely consideration. By March 1878, Grant wrote to Badeau, that since the railroad crisis ended [...] "Most every letter I get from the States, like Porter's to you, <b>asks</b> <b>me</b> to remain abroad", suggesting it was best for Grant to spare himself any political trouble and inquiry.|$|E

College presidents, academic deans and deans of admission do not know enough about other institutions to make meaningful comparisons. This gives a false sense of reliability to what is a ranking system without any real validity." [...] Sweet Briar College president, Elizabeth S. Muhlenfeld stated that, [...] "one of our colleagues likened it to trying to rank composers. It's a great analogy. How can you say that Beethoven and Brahms are better than Mahler or Mozart?" [...] Trinity Washington University president Patricia McGuire argued that, [...] "the survey <b>asks</b> <b>me</b> to 'rate the academic quality of undergraduate programs,' assigning each school a single score using a 1-to-5 scale from 'marginal' to 'distinguished.' That I have little real information about these 181 institutions does not seem to matter to the U.S. News editors [...] Some of the actual best colleges in this nation do not fare well in the U.S. News survey because {{they do not have the}} wealth, big-time sports notoriety or public relations clout to influence the peer voting system." [...] Finally, DePauw University president, Robert G. Bottoms, argued that, [...] "I, in fact, did not fill out the reputational survey for this past year. [...] I came to the conclusion that I am not in a position to make judgments on other schools, many of which I have little or no familiarity with. The fact that one quarter of a college's ranking is based upon what is, in essence, its popularity, is very disturbing and we choose not to be a part of the process." ...|$|E
