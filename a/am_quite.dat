5|$|I {{understand}} {{there is a}} clerkship vacant in your office, and I beg {{to apply for the}} same. I have passed the Matriculation Examination and studied up to the F.A. but was prevented from pursuing my studies further owing to several untoward circumstances. I have, however, been devoting all my time to Mathematics and developing the subject. I can say I <b>am</b> <b>quite</b> confident I can do justice to my work if I am appointed to the post. I therefore beg to request that you will be good enough to confer the appointment on me.|$|E

I could forever tell of the qualities of this beloved man, Horatio Nelson. I have not shed a tear before the 21st October, and since whenever I am alone, I <b>am</b> <b>quite</b> like a child.|$|E
25|$|Former {{students}} of Hindu College were strongly {{in favour of}} Thomas Babington Macaulay’s move for western education. They even went {{to the extent of}} supporting his theory, expounded in 1835, “I <b>am</b> <b>quite</b> ready to take oriental learning at the valuation of orientalists themselves. I have never found one among them, who could deny that that a single shelf of a good European library was worth the whole native literature of India and Arabia.” That was an age when India’s past was still to be fully realised.|$|E

25|$|When such a {{complete}} convulsion has shaken the State, and hardly left any thing whatsoever, either in civil arrangements, {{or in the}} Characters and disposition of men's minds, exactly where it was, whatever shall be settled although in the former persons and upon old forms, will be in some measure a new thing and will labour under something of the weakness {{as well as other}} inconveniences of a Change. My poor opinion is that you mean to establish what you call 'L'ancien Régime,' If any one means that system of Court Intrigue miscalled a Government as it stood, at Versailles before the present confusions as the thing to be established, that I believe will be found absolutely impossible; and if you consider the Nature, as well of persons, as of affairs, I flatter myself you must be of my opinion. That was tho' not so violent a State of Anarchy as well as the present. If it were even possible to lay things down exactly as they stood, before the series of experimental politicks began, I <b>am</b> <b>quite</b> sure that they could not long continue in that situation. In one Sense of L'Ancien Régime I am clear that nothing else can reasonably be done.|$|E

He is happy to do that; I <b>am</b> <b>quite</b> happy {{to make my own}} way around things." ...|$|E
500|$|In his decision, Hartwicke went {{counter to}} the {{prevailing}} view that the Statute of Anne should be interpreted very strictly, proclaiming, [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>quite</b> of a different opinion, and that it ought to receive a liberal construction, for {{it is far from}} being a monopoly, as it is intended to secure the property of books in the authors themselves, or the purchasers of the copy, as some recompense for their pains and labour in such works as may be of use to the learned world." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1861, Tchaikovsky {{attended}} {{classes in}} music theory {{organized by the}} Russian Musical Society and taught by Nikolai Zaremba. A year later he followed Zaremba to the Saint Petersburg Conservatory. Tchaikovsky would not give up his Ministry post [...] "until I <b>am</b> <b>quite</b> certain that I am destined to be a musician rather than a civil servant." [...] From 1862 to 1865 he studied harmony, counterpoint and fugue with Zaremba, while Rubinstein taught him instrumentation and composition. In 1863 he abandoned his civil service career and studied music full-time, graduating in December 1865.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the viscounty bestowed on Mary Anne Disraeli; the earldom of Beaconsfield {{was to have been}} bestowed on Edmund Burke in 1797, but he had died before receiving it. The name Beaconsfield, a town near Hughenden, also was given to a minor character in Vivian Grey. Disraeli made various statements about his elevation, writing to Selina, Lady Bradford on 8 August 1876, [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>quite</b> tired of that place [...] " [...] but when asked by a friend how he liked the Lords, replied, [...] "I am dead; dead but in the Elysian fields." ...|$|E

I {{will make a}} book about two disagreeable people, called Tommy Brock and Mr. Tod." [...] He altered the text to read, [...] "I have made many books about well-behaved people." [...] Potter responded:If it were not impertinent to lecture one's publisher—you are a great deal too much afraid of the public, for whom I have never cared one tuppenny-button. [...] I have always thought the opening paragraph distinctly good, because it gets away from [...] "once upon a time".|$|E
500|$|The bailout {{referendum}} on 5 July {{resulted in a}} 'No' vote {{to the adoption of}} the bailout package. The following day, Varoufakis resigned as finance minister. As he left the finance ministry, he suggested that Tsakalotos was likely to succeed him, and Tsakalotos was subsequently sworn-in later that day. In the process of this, Tsakalotos relinquished his previous ministerial position of Alternate Minister for International Economic Relations. Tsakalotos was noted for his differences with Varoufakis, for example, the Financial Times noted that he [...] "could hardly be more different from his flamboyant predecessor". At a press conference shortly following his appointment, Tsakalotos said: [...] "I cannot hide from you that I <b>am</b> <b>quite</b> nervous. I am not taking on this job at the easiest point in Greek history." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics {{writing at}} the end of the nineteenth century praised Planché with sentiments such as [...] " [...] raised {{theatrical}} extravaganza and burlesque to the dignity of a fine art, and wrote verses to be sung on the stage which could be read with pleasure in the study." [...] and [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>quite</b> certain that such masters of lyrical writing as W. S. Gilbert ... would confirm me in my opinion that the songs and lyrics in the extravaganzas of Planché were as faultless in tone, tact and taste as they were rhythmically perfect". (The converse was also true; Planché approved of, and strongly influenced Gilbert's works) Planché's dramatic reputation was already fading before his death, and continued to do so in the twentieth century. He is still remembered for his influence on and contributions to British theatre over a long career.|$|E

500|$|Commentator and Simpson's {{close friend}} David Saunders stated in his 1971 book, Cycling in the Sixties, that {{although}} he did not condone Simpson's use of drugs, he thought it was not the reason for his death. He said: [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>quite</b> convinced that Simpson killed himself because he just did not know when to stop. All his racing life he had punished his frail body, pushing it to the limits of endurance with his tremendous will-power and single-mindedness and, on Mont Ventoux, he pushed it too far, perhaps the drug easing the pain of it all." [...] Saunders {{went on to say that}} Simpson was not alone in the taking of drugs in professional cycling and that the authorities ignored their use. His opinion was that Simpson did not take drugs to gain an unfair advantage, but because [...] "he was not going to be beaten by a pill".|$|E
500|$|The {{work was}} premiered by the Vienna Philharmonic on December 4, 1898, {{conducted}} by Gustav Mahler, {{a friend and}} supporter of Dvořák. Mahler wrote to Dvořák before the premiere, [...] "I have just received your second work 'The Hero's Song' and, as with , <b>am</b> <b>quite</b> enchanted with it." [...] Dvořák {{was present at the}} premier and had planned to conduct it himself with the Berlin Philharmonic on November 14, 1899, but cancelled his plans due to a sudden nervous breakdownin Dvořák's words, [...] "I was so indisposed that I had to leave Berlin with my wife without even seeing Simrock." [...] The piece had been performed the previous day, conducted by Arthur Nikisch. It was also performed in London, Hamburg, Boston and Leipzig in October and November 1899. Dvořák was finally able to personally conduct the piece in Budapest in December of that year.|$|E
500|$|On 20 September 2006, Alonso scored {{what the}} BBC {{described}} as [...] "an outrageous strike" [...] {{from his own}} half in a 2–0 Premiership win against Newcastle United. Andy Hunter of The Independent described it as [...] "one of the most audacious goals in Anfield's rich 115-year history". Alonso rebutted claims that his 70-yard goal was all down to luck and stated that he took long range shots {{as part of his}} training routine. Despite the similarity of the goals struck from inside his own half, Alonso was in no doubt which was his best. He said, [...] "I think this was better. The Luton goal bounced a few times, this one went quite straight. The Luton one was left-footed– it was different– but I <b>am</b> <b>quite</b> happy to score the goal." [...] It was his first goal for Liverpool since the goal against Luton, making distinct history as the only outfield player in modern professional football history to score two consecutive goals from inside his own half of the pitch.|$|E

500|$|Prince Frederick settled Anderson in {{a former}} army barracks in the small village of Unterlengenhardt, {{on the edge of}} the Black Forest, where she became a sort of tourist attraction. Lili Dehn, a friend of Tsarina Alexandra, visited her and {{acknowledged}} her as Anastasia, but when Charles Sydney Gibbes, English tutor to the imperial children, met Anderson he denounced her as a fraud. In an affidavit, he swore [...] "She in no way resembles the true Grand Duchess Anastasia that I had known... I <b>am</b> <b>quite</b> satisfied that she is an impostor." [...] She became a recluse, surrounded by cats, and her house began to decay. In May 1968, Anderson was taken to a hospital at Neuenbürg after being discovered semi-conscious in her cottage. In her absence, Prince Frederick cleaned up the property by order of the local board of health. Her Irish Wolfhound and 60 cats were put to death. Horrified by this, Anderson accepted her long-term supporter Gleb Botkin's offer to move to the United States.|$|E
500|$|At the Second Battle of El Alamein, the 9th Division {{was given}} {{responsibility}} for clearing a corridor through the German and Italian {{forces in the}} North and threatening to cut off those between the coastal road and the sea. In the initial assault the division hacked {{its way through the}} enemy defences but failed to clear the minefields. As the British attack faltered, the main effort switched to the 9th Division, which punched a massive dent into the German and Italian position over the next five days at great cost, [...] "crumbling" [...] the Afrika Korps in the process, and ultimately forcing Rommel to retreat. [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>quite</b> certain", Leese informed Morshead, [...] "that this breakout was made possible by Homeric fighting over your divisional sector." [...] During the El Alamein Campaign, the 9th Division suffered 22% of the British Eighth Army's casualties; 1,177 Australians were killed, while 3,629 were wounded, 795 were captured and 193 were missing. Morshead received yet another mention in despatches in June 1942, and in November 1942 he was also created a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath.|$|E
500|$|Leeds were {{resigned}} to losing their senior players after going into administration, with Championship club Stoke City signing Cresswell on {{a three-year contract}} for an undisclosed fee on 2 August 2007, after Hull City had pulled out of a deal after expressing concerns following his medical. He made his debut in a 1–0 win at Cardiff City on 11 August 2007, before scoring in his second appearance with an equaliser during stoppage time of extra time in a 2–2 draw away to Rochdale in the League Cup first round on 14 August, although Stoke lost 4–2 in a penalty shoot-out. He scored the last ever goal at Colchester United's Layer Road ground in a 1–0 win. Cresswell made 46 appearances for Stoke in 2007–08, scoring 12 goals, as the club won promotion into the Premier League as Championship runners-up. He was regularly used on the left wing by Stoke manager Tony Pulis, even though his natural position is as a striker. He {{was quoted as saying}} he enjoyed playing as a winger, saying [...] "I do my best, and I <b>am</b> <b>quite</b> a fit lad so I get through quite a bit of mileage". During 2008–09, Cresswell played on the wing and as a striker, featuring in 34 matches and scoring one goal.|$|E
