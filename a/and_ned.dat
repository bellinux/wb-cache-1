40|$|Soil {{organic matter}} (SOM) is a carbon (C) <b>and</b> {{nitrogen}} (<b>N)</b> reservoir comprising {{a continuum of}} overlapping pools of different sizes, composition, turnover times and levels of significance to C <b>and</b> <b>N</b> cycling in terrestrial systems. The mineralization of SOM provides C, <b>N</b> <b>and</b> energy to microorganisms <b>and</b> <b>N</b> to plants. Soil C <b>and</b> <b>N</b> dynamics are linked to each other <b>and</b> <b>N</b> is usually the limiting substrate for C microbial turnover. Soil C <b>and</b> <b>N</b> demand increase with higher crop yields and risks of depletion of soil reserves arise when removals are larger than inputs. Assessing the C <b>and</b> <b>N</b> dynamics in sensitive SOM pools {{is a key to}} measure changes in soil quality under intensive agriculture. Short-term (18 -month) C <b>and</b> <b>N</b> dynamics was studied using stable isotopes (15 <b>N</b> <b>and</b> 13 C) in four SOM pools under maize-soybean cropping systems. ^ Temporal changes in total soil C (TSC) <b>and</b> <b>N</b> (TSN) were related to the amount of C <b>and</b> <b>N</b> inputs <b>and</b> removals each cycle. The LF and MHA were the most labile fractions with greater sensitivity to C <b>and</b> <b>N</b> of residue inputs. The LF displayed the largest seasonal fluctuation in C <b>and</b> <b>N</b> gains <b>and</b> removals. The change in 13 C <b>and</b> 15 <b>N</b> enrichment revealed the sequence of C <b>and</b> <b>N</b> turnover as LF 3 ̆e MHA 3 ̆e CaHA 3 ̆e Humin. Biological activity dominates the C <b>and</b> <b>N</b> turnover in the LF and MHA due to their simpler chemical composition and reduced protection by minerals while the turnover of CaHA and Humin suggest that abiotic processes dominate turnover. The contribution of individual fractions to TSN follows Humin-N 3 ̆e CaHA-N 3 ̆e MHA-N 3 ̆e LF-N. Manipulation of C <b>and</b> <b>N</b> cycling in agricultural ecosystems depends on the rate and timing of C <b>and</b> <b>N</b> additions to soil, the removals at harvest and the changes in the physical environment. TSC gains were measured only in systems attaining high crop productivity. ...|$|R

40|$|The grazing {{exclusion}} in degraded grassland {{has been extensively}} used to prevent the loss of grassland resources and to improve grassland services. The effects of {{grazing exclusion}} on C <b>and</b> <b>N</b> balance, however, have not been well addressed but are essential for assessing grassland C sinks, the sustainable use of grassland resources {{and the support of}} grassland services. To understand the response of ecosystem C <b>and</b> <b>N</b> to grazing exclusion in semiarid grassland, we determined the C <b>and</b> <b>N</b> in litter, aboveground biomass, roots and soils from ungrazed grassland fenced at different times in northwest China. Our results showed that the aboveground biomass, root biomass and plant litter were 70 - 92 %, 56 - 151 % and 59 - 141 % higher, respectively, in grazer excluded grassland than in grazed grassland. Grazing exclusion significantly increased C <b>and</b> <b>N</b> stored in plant biomass and litter and increased the concentrations and stocks of C <b>and</b> <b>N</b> in soils. Grazing exclusion thus significantly increased the C <b>and</b> <b>N</b> stored in grassland ecosystems. The increase in C <b>and</b> <b>N</b> stored in soil contributed to more than 95 % and 97 % of the increases in ecosystem C <b>and</b> <b>N</b> storage. The highest C <b>and</b> <b>N</b> stocks in ecosystems were observed in 17 -year grazer excluded grassland.

5|$|In 1747, Fleetwood's playhouse patent expired. The theatre and {{a patent}} renewal were {{purchased}} by actor David Garrick (who had trained under Macklin earlier) and partner James Lacy.

Some of Shakespeare's surge in popularity during this period can be traced to the Licensing Act of 1737, which mandated governmental approval of any play before it could be performed and thereby created something of a vacuum of new material to perform. Garrick shared the stage with company including Peg Woffington, Susannah Cibber, Hannah Pritchard, Kitty Clive, Spranger Barry, Richard Yates <b>and</b> <b>Ned</b> Shuter.
