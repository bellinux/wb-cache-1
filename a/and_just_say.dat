500|$|Walters re-signed {{with the}} Eagles before {{training}} camp in 1983. He played in the first preseason game against the Detroit Lions, but {{had to leave the}} game due to an injury. Three days later, on August 8, he announced his retirement from football, saying [...] "After 12 years of playing in the NFL, I earned the right to go to my head coach <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>say</b> I've fought my battle. It's over." [...] However, when his replacement, Dean Miraldi, suffered a sprained knee in the next preseason game, Walters ended his week-long retirement to re-join the Eagles on August 15. The contract offered to him included a clause that the organization would put up a barn next to his house. He re-injured his knee against the St. Louis Cardinals on September 25 and had to leave the game. Before the November 20 game against the New York Giants, Walters was benched, along with four other starters, by head coach Marion Campbell in an attempt to rejuvenate the team with younger players after five straight losses. He finished the season with ten starts in twelve games. He ended a streak of 122 consecutive starts at left tackle for the Eagles during the 1983 season.|$|E

Ken is way past his prime, {{it gets to the}} point where it's dangerous for that guy to still be fighting." [...] WWE announcer Jim Ross said before Shamrock's scheduled fight with Bobby Lashley in early 2009; [...] "There was a time that I could see the veteran, 45-year-old Shamrock, a former WWE superstar, schooling the MMA rookie Lashley but that ship has long since sailed. I have great respect for Ken but he's outstayed his welcome in the octagon, cage, whatever and needs to teach and coach and stop fighting...Kenny is fighting for one more pay day while Lashley is fighting to help establish what he hopes will be a long term, lucrative, MMA career." ...|$|E

In June of '69 they got a call—man down—it was Jones. They put the paddles on him, he was in VF, started CPR, zapped him, he came back to sinus rhythm, brought him into ER and three days later he was out and walking around. In gratitude, about a week later, he came down to Station 1, which he had never done before, and he {{said he would like to}} talk to the man who saved his life.

[...] In his review for the Washington Post, Desson Howe praised Jack Black as [...] "a bundle of {{verbally}} ferocious energy. Frankly, whenever he's in the scene, he shoplifts this movie from Cusack." [...] In his review for The New York Times, Stephen Holden praised Cusack's performance, writing that he was [...] "a master at projecting easygoing camaraderie, he navigates the transitions with such an astonishing naturalness and fluency that you're almost unaware of them." [...] USA Today did not give the film a positive review: [...] "Let's be kind <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>say</b> High Fidelity doesn't quite belong beside Grosse Pointe Blank and The Sure Thing in Cusack's greatest hits collection. It's not that he isn't good. More like miscast." [...] In his review for Entertainment Weekly, Owen Gleiberman gave the film a [...] "B-" [...] rating and wrote, [...] "In High Fidelity, Rob's music fixation is a signpost of his arrested adolescence; he needs to get past records to find true love. If the movie had had a richer romantic spirit, he might have embraced both in one swooning gesture." ...|$|E
