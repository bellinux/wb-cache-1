5|$|The Wii system {{supports}} wireless connectivity with the Nintendo DS without any additional accessories. This connectivity allows the player {{to use the}} Nintendo DS microphone and touchscreen <b>as</b> <b>inputs</b> for Wii games. The first game utilizing Nintendo DS-Wii connectivity is Pokémon Battle Revolution. Players with either the Pokémon Diamond or Pearl Nintendo DS games are able to play battles using the Nintendo DS as a controller. , released on both Nintendo DS and Wii, features connectivity in which both games can advance simultaneously. Nintendo later released the Nintendo Channel, which allows Wii owners to download game demos or additional data to their Nintendo DS in a process {{similar to that of}} a DS Download Station. The console is also able to expand Nintendo DS games.|$|E

Farmers combine fed aquaculture (e.g., fish, shrimp) with inorganic extractive (e.g., seaweed) and organic extractive (e.g., shellfish) aquaculture to create balanced systems for environment remediation (biomitigation), economic stability (improved output, lower cost, product diversification and risk reduction) and social acceptability (better management practices).|$|E
25|$|To {{perform a}} docking screen, the first {{requirement}} is {{a structure of}} the protein of interest. Usually the structure has been determined using a biophysical technique such as x-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy, but can also derive from homology modeling construction. This protein structure and a database of potential ligands serve <b>as</b> <b>inputs</b> to a docking program. The success of a docking program depends on two components: the search algorithm and the scoring function.|$|E
25|$|Strategic {{management}} {{involves the}} related concepts of strategic planning and strategic thinking. Strategic planning is analytical {{in nature and}} refers to formalized procedures to produce the data and analyses used <b>as</b> <b>inputs</b> for strategic thinking, which synthesizes the data resulting in the strategy. Strategic planning may also refer to control mechanisms used to implement the strategy once it is determined. In other words, strategic planning happens around the strategic thinking or strategy making activity.|$|E

25|$|Maintenance {{is based}} on the results of the Evaluation sub-process and insight in the {{changing}} risks. These activities will produce proposals. The proposals either serve <b>as</b> <b>inputs</b> for the plan sub-process and travel through the cycle or can be adopted as part of maintaining service level agreements. In both cases the proposals could lead to activities in the action plan. The actual changes are made by the Change Management process.|$|E
25|$|These assumptions, while unrealistic, yield {{acceptable}} {{models for}} flight dynamics applications. The last assumption of a velocity field {{that does not}} vary with time is especially unrealistic, since measurements of atmospheric turbulence {{at one point in}} space always vary with time. These models rely on the airplane's motion through the gusts to generate temporal variations in wind velocity, making them inappropriate for use <b>as</b> <b>inputs</b> to models of hovering, wind turbines, or other applications that are fixed in space.|$|E
25|$|It is NP-complete to {{determine}} whether a graph G has a branch-decomposition of width at most k, when G and k are both considered <b>as</b> <b>inputs</b> to the problem. However, the graphs with branchwidth at most k form a minor-closed family of graphs, from which it follows that computing the branchwidth is fixed-parameter tractable: there is an algorithm for computing optimal branch-decompositions whose running time, on graphs of branchwidth k for any fixed constant k, is linear {{in the size of the}} input graph., at the expense of an increase in the dependence on the number of vertices from linear to quadratic.|$|E

25|$|Many real {{dynamical}} {{systems do}} not exactly fit this model. In fact, unmodelled dynamics can seriously degrade the filter performance, {{even when it}} was supposed to work with unknown stochastic signals <b>as</b> <b>inputs.</b> The {{reason for this is that}} the effect of unmodelled dynamics depends on the input, and, therefore, can bring the estimation algorithm to instability (it diverges). On the other hand, independent white noise signals will not make the algorithm diverge. The problem of distinguishing between measurement noise and unmodelled dynamics is a difficult one and is treated in control theory under the framework of robust control.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{current drawn}} into the {{operational}} amplifier from the power supply can be used <b>as</b> <b>inputs</b> to external circuitry that augment {{the capabilities of the}} operational amplifier. For example, an operational amplifier may not be fit for a particular high-gain application because its output would be required to generate signals outside of the safe range generated by the amplifier. In this case, an external pushpull amplifier can be controlled by the current {{into and out of the}} operational amplifier. Thus, the operational amplifier may itself operate within its factory specified bounds while still allowing the negative feedback path to include a large output signal well outside of those bounds.|$|E
25|$|In {{economics}} and especially macroeconomics, {{the effects of}} proposed policy actions, such as fiscal policy changes or monetary policy changes, are simulated to judge their desirability. A mathematical model of the economy, having been fitted to historical economic data, {{is used as a}} proxy for the actual economy; proposed values of government spending, taxation, open market operations, etc. are used <b>as</b> <b>inputs</b> to the simulation of the model, and various variables of interest such as the inflation rate, the unemployment rate, the balance of trade deficit, the government budget deficit, etc. are the outputs of the simulation. The simulated values of these variables of interest are compared for different proposed policy inputs to determine which set of outcomes is most desirable.|$|E

25|$|The GRN {{is created}} from a graph with the desired topology, {{imposing}} in-degree and out-degree distributions. Gene promoter activities {{are affected by}} other genes expression products that act <b>as</b> <b>inputs,</b> {{in the form of}} monomers or combined into multimers and set as direct or indirect. Next, each direct input is assigned to an operator site and different transcription factors can be allowed, or not, to compete for the same operator site, while indirect inputs are given a target. Finally, a function is assigned to each gene, defining the gene's response to a combination of transcription factors (promoter state). The transfer functions (that is, how genes respond to a combination of inputs) can be assigned to each combination of promoter states as desired.|$|E
25|$|Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) {{analysis}} involves {{creating an}} inventory of flows from and to nature for a product system. Inventory flows include inputs of water, energy, and raw materials, and releases to air, land, and water. To develop the inventory, a flow model of the technical system is constructed using data on inputs and outputs. The flow model is typically illustrated with a flow chart that includes the activities {{that are going to}} be assessed in the relevant supply chain and gives a clear picture of the technical system boundaries. The input and output data needed for the construction of the model are collected for all activities within the system boundary, including from the supply chain (referred to <b>as</b> <b>inputs</b> from the technosphere).|$|E
25|$|Continuous network {{models of}} GRNs are an {{extension}} of the boolean networks described above. Nodes still represent genes and connections between them regulatory influences on gene expression. Genes in biological systems display a continuous range of activity levels and {{it has been argued that}} using a continuous representation captures several properties of gene regulatory networks not present in the Boolean model. Formally most of these approaches are similar to an artificial neural network, <b>as</b> <b>inputs</b> to a node are summed up and the result serves as input to a sigmoid function, e.g., but proteins do often control gene expression in a synergistic, i.e. non-linear, way. However, there is now a continuous network model that allows grouping of inputs to a node thus realizing another level of regulation. This model is formally closer to a higher order recurrent neural network. The same model has also been used to mimic the evolution of cellular differentiation and even multicellular morphogenesis.|$|E

25|$|Adding {{a second}} serial {{line to the}} device, and adding another {{latching}} region would allow for the latching of two input values at the two different outputs. To perform computation, a gate that takes <b>as</b> <b>inputs</b> both serial lines at their respective outputs is added. The gate is placed over a new latching region configured to process data only when both latching regions {{at the end of}} the serial lines hold the values of interest at the same instant. Figure 10 shows such an arrangement. If correctly configured, latching regions 5 and 6 will each hold input values of interest to latching region 7. At this instant, latching region 7 will let the values latched on regions 5 and 6 through the AND gate, thus the output could be configured to be the AND result of any two inputs (i.e. R and Q) by merely configuring the latching regions 5, 6 and 7.|$|E
