5|$|A similar issue again {{arose in}} 2009 when Burger King {{diverted}} {{several million dollars}} of advertising rebates paid to its American franchises by Coca Cola Corporation and Dr. Pepper Snapple Group to its own coffers. The company intended to utilize these funds to increase its advertising presence in the United States {{at a time when}} corporate advertising costs were falling, which would allow an increased media presence of approximately 25% from the previous year (2008). The NFA contended that Burger King Corporation improperly redirected 40% of restaurant operating funds (ROF) paid by the two beverage suppliers to franchises since 1990 into the corporate <b>advertising</b> <b>budget.</b> These funds were often used by the franchises to pay for beverage support systems such as filtration units and local marketing, and diversion of the funds would cost franchises at least $65 million (USD) between 2010-2012. These funds often helped the franchises' bottom lines, as they were often used to offset other costs imposed on the franchises by Burger King, such as the $1 (USD) Double Cheeseburger.|$|E

40|$|A good {{product is}} like having no product at all unless {{information}} {{about it is}} communicated to the target consumer group, and a company without products cannot survive. It is therefore {{not a question of}} whether the company should communicate with the market or not, but how the company can communicate with the market as efficiently as possible. There is very little guidance available to the practitioner in this area: the absence of accounting standards for advertising and promotion costs and a lack of communications knowledge make it hard to know whether too much is spent or not enough. Academic research has shown that there has been an increased use of the objective and task method over the years, which indicates an increased degree of sophistication. Looking into more details about <b>advertising</b> and promotion <b>budgeting,</b> however, shows that most companies have to rely on approximations of the objective and task method. The technological development that would allow consumer product companies to establish a cause-effect relationship between advertising and sales has not been introduced in Sweden yet, and only large companies will be able to afford to use the method in the future. On the whole, one can conclude that academic recommendations on theoretically sound budgeting practices lie one step ahead of what is possible for the practitioners to accomplish. <b>Advertising</b> <b>budgets</b> <b>advertising</b> <b>advertising</b> <b>budgeting</b> methods <b>advertising</b> <b>budgeting</b> practices...|$|R

25|$|Once {{production}} has finished, the film undergoes post production (provided a Post Production Building has been erected), where music, sound effects, subtitles, speech and titles {{can be added}} to the movie. Cuts and changes can also be made to the length and order of the scenes, making editing the film easier. The player can also record sounds and a dialogue track for each character in that particular scene. The game allows for lip-synching, matching the speech to the actors. However, this only works for short sound files, and only shows basic lip movements. Once the movie has been completed, it can be saved in a proprietary file format for transferring to other PC users, or WMV format for online sharing. Outstanding player-made films can be nominated for a Stanley, a version of the Oscars. Once the player has reached Level 3 in story mode, the publicity office becomes available. This allows actors to hold press conferences and organizes marketing for the player's movie. Once a publicity office is built, players can also choose an <b>advertising</b> <b>budget</b> when releasing a film. A heavily-advertised movie can make much more money, but using too much advertising can result in the movie being 'over-exposed'.|$|E
