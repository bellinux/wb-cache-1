500|$|The CT scan in 2006, led by Alexander Huppertz, the {{director}} of the Imaging Science Institute in Berlin, revealed a wrinkled face of Nefertiti carved in the inner core of the bust. The results were published in the April 2009 Radiology journal. The scan revealed that Thutmose placed layers of varying thickness on top of the limestone core. The inner face has creases <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> and cheeks and a swelling on the nose. The creases and the bump on the nose are leveled by the outermost stucco layer. According to Huppertz, this may reflect [...] "aesthetic ideals of the era". The 2006 scan provided greater detail than the 1992 one, revealing subtle details just 1â€“2mm under the stucco.|$|E
500|$|Naomi Alderman of The Guardian branded her {{purposely}} failing her maths {{tests to}} get Mike's attention as [...] "ridiculous", however she added: [...] "As a teenager I remember having earnest discussions with other girls about it: {{was it really}} true? Did men not like clever girls? Ought we to try to appear less clever?" [...] Whilst Owen Gibson of the newspaper said she was the [...] "school swot" [...] before she turned into a [...] "beauty queen". Columnist Felicity Cloake compiled an advice guide to attending Christmas parties for the workplace, on style she advised her readers to look to Jane for inspiration {{if they want to}} [...] "dress to impress". Josh Burt of entertainment website Hecklerspray ran a make over feature inspired by Jane's make over, he also branded Jane a whore and said he thought her make over was astonishing. He also stated: [...] "Ever since Plain Jane the Superbrain took off her glasses, smeared some slutty red lipstick <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> and rubbed ice cubes on her stupid nipples, the celebrity makeover has been a must for anyone hoping to increase their fame. For those unaware, the whole Plain Jane thing happened in the Australian drama serial, Neighbours. She went from geek to whore in a matter of moments." ...|$|E
500|$|Elsie Kelly played Angela's mother Maggie, {{on whose}} {{birthday}} the episode is set. The part was not written with anyone in mind, though Pemberton already knew Kelly well from {{their time together}} on the sitcom Benidorm. Lorraine Ashbourne played Angela's sister Carol, and Pat, Carol's husband, was played by Shearsmith. Carol was Pemberton's favourite character in the whole series; Shearsmith worried that an actor may not portray the character as they had hoped, but was very happy with Ashbourne's performance. Ashbourne said she was [...] "thrilled" [...] {{to be working with}} Pemberton and Shearsmith, for whom she had great admiration. She described the character of Carol as [...] "hilarious", characterising her as [...] "sexually frustrated" [...] and [...] "sad". To reflect Carol's alcoholism, Ashbourne swilled whiskey <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> before filming. Shearsmith wore a red wig to play Pat, something he had never done before. His skin-tone needed to be changed to match the hair, necessitating a white spray on his face every morning. In order not {{to give the impression that}} Pat was a thief or murderer (rather than simply a practical joker), Shearsmith was directed to chuckle while Pat set up his jokes. Christopher Whitlow plays a paramedic seen at the beginning and end of the episode. The scene featuring the paramedic at the end of the episode was longer in the final cut than had been initially intended in order to show more of the character's actions.|$|E
60|$|It was {{probable}} Rose was not displeased at this {{allusion to}} herself, for a smile struggled <b>around</b> <b>her</b> pretty <b>mouth,</b> {{and she did}} not look at all angry. After another short pause, she resumed the discourse.|$|R
60|$|Lucy looked deeply gratified; and I {{saw another}} of those inexplicable smiles lurking <b>around</b> <b>her</b> lovely <b>mouth,</b> which almost tempted me to demand an {{explanation}} of its meaning. Ere there was time for this, however, her countenance became very, very sad, and she turned her tearful eyes toward me.|$|R

After chastising Kelly, the family then embraces and Zoe apologises. The next shot shows the children eating in David's car and Zoe looking very troubled. David indicates to Zoe {{that he wants to}} have a chat.|$|R

2500|$|On October 2, 2016, while {{attending}} Paris Fashion Week, Kardashian was robbed at gunpoint {{in the apartment}} where she was staying. Five individuals, dressed as police officers, bound and gagged her, then stole $10 million worth of jewelry. The thieves got in her residence by threatening the concierge. Once they accessed Kardashian's room, they held a gun to her head, tying her wrists and legs and wrapping duct tape <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> as a gag. Kardashian, who {{was placed in the}} bathtub, was physically unharmed and reportedly begged for her life. She managed to wriggle her hands free from the plastic ties around her wrists and scream for help. The thieves escaped. On October 6, 2016, it was revealed that filming for the next season of Keeping up with the Kardashians had been placed [...] "on hold indefinitely" [...] after the robbery. Production resumed on October 26. Kardashian postponed a makeup demonstration in Dubai due to the incident.|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly," [...] she answered, with patient sweetness. [...] "You may gag me {{in any way}} you please. I am {{perfectly}} {{sure you}} can secure the proof you want." [...] Upon this hint I acted. Taking a large kerchief from my pocket, I tied it tightly <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> knotting it at the back, and then, in growing excitement, challenged the ghostly voice: [...] "Now, 'Wilbur,' let's hear from you." ...|$|E
60|$|Poor Rose sighed, {{and gave}} up the {{explanation}} in despair. Then a smile played <b>around</b> <b>her</b> pretty <b>mouth.</b> It was not at her aunt that she smiled; this she never permitted herself to do, weak as was that person, and weak as she saw her to be; she smiled at the recollection how often Mulford had hinted at her good looks--for Rose was a female, and had her own weaknesses, as well as another. But the necessity of acting soon drove these thoughts from her mind, and Rose sought Jack Tier, to confer {{with him on the}} subject of their new duties.|$|R
60|$|She {{was almost}} {{relieved}} by detecting otherwise little resemblance; the height was nearly the same, {{but there was}} not the plump softness of outline. Mrs. Arnott was small, thin, brisk and active, with a vivacious countenance, once evidently very fair and pretty, but aged and worn by toil, not trouble, for the furrows were the traces of smiles <b>around</b> <b>her</b> merry <b>mouth,</b> and beautiful blue eyes, that had a tendency lo laugh and cry both at once. Dr. May who had led her into the light, {{seemed to be looking}} her all over, while Richard was taking the wraps from her, and Ethel tried to encourage herself to go forward.|$|R
2500|$|In late September 2013, the San Diego County Medical Examiner's office {{released}} {{results of}} the autopsies of Christina and Ethan Anderson. [...] The autopsy of Christina Anderson found that a plastic cable tie {{had been used to}} bind her ankles, and that duct tape was wrapped <b>around</b> <b>her</b> neck and <b>mouth.</b> <b>Her</b> right arm and both legs were fractured, and there was a cut on her neck. She had been struck at least twelve times in the head. The autopsy of Ethan Anderson determined that the boy died because of the fire, though he also had skeletal fractures that could have been caused by events the day of the murders.|$|R
6000|$|After a moment's pause she answered, while {{a sudden}} smile dimpled <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> {{and the big}} glove went up to hide her {{telltale}} cheeks: [...] "Uncle, if I must have lovers, I do wish they'd be more interesting. How can I like or respect men who go on as {{some of them do}} and then imagine women can feel honored by the offer of their hands? Hearts are out of fashion, so they don't say much about them." ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Temple {{had gone}} forward to meet her, but I stood staring, marvelling, forgetful, in the path. They were talking, {{they were coming}} towards me, and I heard Mrs. Temple {{pronounce}} my name and hers--Madame de Montmery. I bowed, she courtesied. There was a baffling light in the lady's brown eyes when I dared to glance at them, and a smile playing <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b> Was there no word in the two languages to find its way to my lips? Mrs. Temple laid {{her hand on my}} arm.|$|E
6000|$|She motioned shyly {{towards the}} cabin, and then led the way. The stranger, with an inarticulate murmur, {{afterwards}} {{disguised as a}} cough, followed her meekly. Nevertheless, {{by the time they}} had reached the cabin he had shaken his long hair over his eyes again, and a dark abstraction gathered chiefly in his eyebrows. But it did not efface from the girl's mind the previous concession of a blush, and, although it added to her curiosity, did not alarm her. He drank the milk awkwardly. But by the laws of courtesy, even among the most savage tribes, she felt he was, at that moment at least, harmless. A timid smile fluttered <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> as she said:-- ...|$|E
2500|$|Biographer Barbara Leaming {{wrote that}} Hayworth aged prematurely {{because of her}} {{addiction}} to alcohol and {{also because of the}} many stresses in her life. [...] "Despite the artfully applied make-up and shoulder-length red hair, there was no concealing the ravages of drink and stress," [...] she wrote of Hayworth's arrival in New York in May 1956 in order to begin work on [...] Fire Down Below, her first film in three years. [...] "Deep lines had crept <b>around</b> <b>her</b> eyes and <b>mouth,</b> and she appeared worn, exhaustedâ€”older than her thirty-eight years." ...|$|R
60|$|Again {{she tried}} to scream, but his hand covered <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b> His arm was {{suddenly}} <b>around</b> <b>her.</b> Then he started back with an oath and looked towards {{the door of her}} bedroom.|$|R
50|$|In the beginning, {{the video}} shows {{a woman in}} a bikini in an {{apartment}} looking in the mirror with Fred Durst watching her. Then she turns <b>around</b> and opens <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> and spits out a mechanical arm holding a levitating bomb that is aimed in Durst's direction, causing Durst to jump out of the window and then blows up the whole apartment. Durst then goes to a burger stand called Bolacha Mole (which means Limp Biscuit in Portuguese), where he sits next to a person with a scar under his eye, across from Wes Borland, whose head falls off. Durst starts to eat his burger, but discovers that it is crawling with worms. After this, a car crashes into the stand and it explodes.|$|R
6000|$|When she {{got home}} {{she looked at her}} face in the glass more {{critically}} than she had done for years. Anne Stockard at her best had never been pretty. When young she had been called [...] "gawky." [...] She was very tall and her figure was lank and angular. She had a long, pale face and dusky hair. Her eyes had been good--a glimmering hazel, large and long-lashed. They were pretty yet, but the crow's feet about them were plainly visible. There were brackets <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> too, and her cheeks were hollow. Anne suddenly realized, as she had never realized before, that she had grown old--that her youth was left far behind. She was an old maid, and Harriet Warren was young, and pretty. Anne's long, thin lips suddenly quivered.|$|E
60|$|Of Marion Fay's {{appearance}} {{something has}} already been said; enough, perhaps,--not to impress any clear idea of her figure on the mind's eye of a reader, for that I regard as a feat beyond the power of any writer,--but to enable the reader to form a conception of his own. She was small of stature, it should be said, with limbs exquisitely made. It was not the brilliance of her eyes or the chiselled correctness of her features which had struck Hampstead so forcibly as a certain expression of earnest eloquence which pervaded her whole form. And there was a fleeting brightness of colour which went about her cheeks and forehead, and ran <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> which gave {{to her when she}} was speaking a brilliance which was hardly to be expected from the ordinary lines of her countenance. Had you been asked, you would have said that she was a brunette,--till she had been worked to some excitement in talking. Then, I think, you would have hardly ventured to describe her complexion by any single word. Lord Hampstead, had he been asked what he thought about her, as he sat waiting for his friend, would have declared that some divinity of grace had been the peculiar gift which had attracted him. And yet that rapid change of colour had not passed unobserved, as she told him that she was sorry that he did not go to church.|$|E
60|$|The stigma gone, Hester {{heaved a}} long, deep sigh, {{in which the}} burden of shame and anguish {{departed}} from her spirit. O exquisite relief! She had not known the weight until she felt the freedom! By another impulse, she took off the formal cap that confined her hair, and down it fell upon her shoulders, dark and rich, with at once a shadow and a light in its abundance, and imparting the charm of softness to her features. There played <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> and beamed out of her eyes, a radiant and tender smile, that seemed gushing from {{the very heart of}} womanhood. A crimson flush was glowing on her cheek, that had been long so pale. Her sex, her youth, and the whole richness of her beauty, came back from what men call the irrevocable past, and clustered themselves with her maiden hope, and a happiness before unknown, within the magic circle of this hour. And, as if the gloom of the earth and sky had been but the effluence of these two mortal hearts, it vanished with their sorrow. All at once, as with a sudden smile of heaven, forth burst the sunshine, pouring a very flood into the obscure forest, gladdening each green leaf, transmuting the yellow fallen ones to gold, and gleaming adown the gray trunks of the solemn trees. The objects that had made a shadow hitherto, embodied the brightness now. The course of the little brook might be traced by its merry gleam afar into the wood's heart of mystery, which had become a mystery of joy.|$|E
40|$|A 17 -year-old female who {{had been}} expressing suicidal {{ideation}} following domestic problems {{was found dead in}} her room next to a towel and an empty can of insect spray. There were no suspicious circumstances and it appeared that the deceased had inhaled insect spray using the towel to maintain the concentration of vapour <b>around</b> <b>her</b> nose and <b>mouth.</b> There was no history of recreational inhalation of volatile substances or other illicit drug use. Inhalation of insect spray is a rare method of suicide in keeping with the suggestion that young suicide victims utilize unusual methods of self-destruction determined to some degree by availability and accessibility.

60|$|The {{tears were}} in Phoebe's eyes; a smile, dewy with affectionate regret, was glimmering <b>around</b> <b>her</b> {{pleasant}} <b>mouth.</b> She wondered {{how it came}} to pass, that her life of a few weeks, here in this heavy-hearted old mansion, had taken such hold of her, and so melted into her associations, as now to seem a more important centre-point of remembrance than all which had gone before. How had Hepzibah--grim, silent, and irresponsive to her overflow of cordial sentiment--contrived to win so much love? And Clifford,--in his abortive decay, with the mystery of fearful crime upon him, and the close prison-atmosphere yet lurking in his breath,--how had he transformed himself into the simplest child, whom Phoebe felt bound to watch over, and be, as it were, the providence of his unconsidered hours! Everything, at that instant of farewell, stood out prominently to her view. Look where she would, lay her hand on what she might, the object responded to her consciousness, as if a moist human heart were in it.|$|R
5000|$|In {{an alleged}} July 2008 rape case {{reported}} by The Village Voice on August 5, 2008, {{the alleged victim}} claimed [...] "that someone entered her cell in the 1,000-bed Rose M. Singer Center while she was asleep, sometime before 6 a.m. on July 3. She says the intruder (or intruders) bound and gagged her with bedsheets and then used a dildo-like object to sexually assault her. Other inmates may have acted as lookouts during the alleged assault. The woman, who was being held on grand-larceny charges {{for the past three}} months, was discovered at about 6 a.m. by an officer and a captain who were touring the building. The officer saw her lying on her back on the floor of her cell with bedsheets wrapped <b>around</b> <b>her</b> neck, <b>mouth,</b> and legs. She had also been blindfolded. The incident was reported to central command at 7:30 a.m., and the woman was transported to the Elmhurst Hospital Center. Because she didn't share a cell with anyone, a major question is how the alleged assault happened in the first place. Officials won't talk about the investigation, and there's no word on whether any arrests have been made." ...|$|R

5000|$|Thom {{returns to}} the house, where he finds Arletty half-crazed; she is cold, cannot feel pain, and thinks she may be dead or undead. She even finds a bug {{crawling}} <b>around</b> in <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> and immediately vomits up various beetles, mealworms and an anole. While Thom was gone, Arletty was visited by her father, who had warned her not to follow him and begs her to leave {{to tell the world}} about Point Dune. He then attacks her, reluctantly giving in to his [...] "vampire" [...] urges, and after she stabs him with garden shears before burning him alive. Startled by Thom, she stabs him in the arm with the shears. The two of them flee to the beach, but the ersatz vampires follow them, even in broad daylight. They swim out to the breakers, but Thom drowns. Arletty survives and is captured by the townspeople. Instead of killing her, she is let free under the condition that she spread word of the religious movement throughout California and the world. This causes her to be locked up in an insane asylum. Each day, all day, she sits in the sun painting, dreading the day the Messiah and his followers come to take her away.|$|R

50|$|The {{climax of}} the festival of Ochpaniztli was the {{sacrifice}} {{of a young woman}} from one of the peoples subjected {{to the power of the}} Mexica who for four days was bedecked with flowers and perfume and was teased by the woman taking care of her day about her impending doom. The woman was dressed as Toci and had black make-up applied <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> while the rest of her face was covered in white make-up, thereby making her resemble Toci whose face was a deathly shade of white except for her area <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> where her skin was black. One of Toci's favorite foods besides for human flesh was human excrement, and this diet had turned the skin <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> permanently black. The woman chosen as the sacrifice victim was forced to smile at all times and was severely beaten by the other women guarding her if she cried because it was felt that her tears would spoil the ceremony as it was believed that every tear would cause a stillbirth or the death of a warrior in battle in the next year. By contrast, the rain god Tlaloc required the sacrifice of children to honor him, and it was believed that the tears of the doomed children would ensure rain in the coming year, so the Mexica went to great lengths to have the children destined to die for Tlaloc to cry as much as possible before their hearts were ripped out.|$|E
