On four occasions, the Defensive Player of the Year winner was not voted to the All-Defensive first team in the same year.

The Nuggets were founded as the Denver Rockets of the American Basketball Association (ABA) in 1967.

25|$|Several NBA {{observers}} accused NBC <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>NBA</b> {{of being}} biased with only certain teams and individual players.

25|$|In the G League All-Star Game, {{twenty of}} the league's top players were {{selected}} to the All-Star roster {{by a combination of}} fan balloting on the official league website and voting by the head coaches of the teams.

Players who have been selected by coaches and fans must be on an active roster of a G League team during the All-Star Weekend. If a player cannot participate whether because of injury, a recall by his NBA team, or a call-up by an NBA team, a replacement player will be named. The starting lineups were picked by the head coaches. The coaches for the All-Star game are the head coaches who currently lead the teams with the best winning percentage in the league through the three weeks before the All-Star game. The first two games were played in four quarters of 12 minutes, similar to a regular NBA or a G League game <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>NBA</b> All-Star Game.

The San Antonio Spurs were initially led by the 'Twin Towers' tandem of center David Robinson and power forward Tim Duncan. With the arrival of Duncan, the veteran Robinson modified his game by playing primarily in the high post to accommodate Duncan's strengths as a low-post scorer and defender.|$|E
