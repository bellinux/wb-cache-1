40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} tooth morphology and positioning on the occurrence of dental caries in permanent teeth. Design: Retrospective study. Method: Data was extracted from the case notes of patients that underwent extraction at the Plateau State Dental Centre, Jos, Nigeria from January 2000 to December 2001, as a result of dental caries and its sequalae. Result: 12696 patients attended the clinic, with a total of 11546 -teeth extracted. 6145 (53. 2 %) permanent teeth were extracted due to caries and it’s sequalae within the period under review. The upper <b>anteriors</b> accounted for 3. 2 %, pre-molars 7. 7 % and molars 29. 8 % while lower <b>anteriors</b> accounted for 0. 4 %, pre-molars 3. 3 % and molars 55. 6 %. The upper <b>anteriors</b> were eight times more vulnerable to caries attack compared to their corresponding lower <b>anteriors.</b> The upper right (43. 3 %) and left (36. 9 %) first premolars were four times prone to losses due to caries compared to their corresponding lower right (11. 5 %) and left (8. 3 %) first premolars. Similar pattern was observed for the upper and lower second premolar (P = 0. 001). The lower right (31. 3 %) and left (31. 3 %) first molar were about two times more susceptible to caries than their corresponding upper right (18. 2 %) and left (19. 2 %) first molar. The same trend holds for the second and third molars (P = 0. 000). Conclusion: The result of this study revealed that the upper premolars were more susceptible to dental caries than the corresponding lower teeth. The study also revealed that the molars were most susceptible to dental caries and would benefit from the use of prophylactic pits and fissure sealants...|$|R

40|$|Adult {{patients}} seeking orthodontic care were increased nowadays {{not only}} on esthetic need but also on functional demand. But problems with adult patients were not only malocclusions but also dental caries, pulpal pathology, missing teeth, muco-gingival problems and loss of supporting structures. We report here a case of 35 -year-old female with complete transposition referred as a positional interchange of two permanent teeth within the same quadrant of the dental arch along with gingival recession of the lower <b>anteriors</b> and missing molars. Gingival health was improved by free gingival graft in lower <b>anteriors</b> followed by fixed orthodontic procedure to correct transposition. Based on transposition crown recontouring and restoration was done along with replacement of missing molars with fixed prosthesis. Thus, proper treatment planning with interdisciplinary management improves not only the esthetics and occlusal relationship but also with stable results...|$|R

5|$|The first {{axillary}} sclerite (lAx) is the <b>anterior</b> {{hinge plate}} {{of the wing}} base. Its <b>anterior</b> part is supported on the <b>anterior</b> notal wing process of the tergum (ANP); its posterior part articulates with the tergal margin. The <b>anterior</b> end of the sclerite is generally produced as a slender arm, the apex of which (e) is always associated with {{the base of the}} subcostal vein (Sc), though it is not united with the latter. The body of the sclerite articulates laterally with the second axillary. The second axillary sclerite (2Ax) is more variable in form than the first axillary, but its mechanical relations are no less definite. It is obliquely hinged to the outer margin of the body of the first axillary, and the radial vein (R) is always flexibly attached to its <b>anterior</b> end (d). The second axillary presents both a dorsal and a ventral sclerotization in the wing base; its ventral surface rests upon the fulcral wing process of the pleuron. The second axillary, therefore, is the pivotal sclerite of the wing base, and it specifically manipulates the radial vein.|$|E

5|$|The {{internal}} carotid arteries are {{branches of}} the common carotid arteries. They enter the cranium through the carotid canal, travel through the cavernous sinus and enter the subarachnoid space. They then enter the circle of Willis, with two branches, the <b>anterior</b> cerebral arteries emerging. These branches travel forward and then upward along the longitudinal fissure, and supply the front and midline parts of the brain. One or more small <b>anterior</b> communicating arteries join the two <b>anterior</b> cerebral arteries shortly after they emerge as branches. The internal carotid arteries continue forward as the middle cerebral arteries. They travel sideways along the sphenoid bone of the eye socket, then upwards through the insula cortex, where final branches arise. The middle cerebral arteries send branches along their length.|$|E

40|$|This {{case report}} {{demonstrates}} an orthodontic method that offers short treatment {{time and the}} ability to simultaneously reshape and increase the buccolingual thickness of the supporting alveolar bone. A 23 -year-old female with Angle′s Class I moderately to severely crowded malocclusion with periodontal pocket with 31 and reduced thickness of the buccal cortical plate of lower <b>anteriors,</b> requested shortened orthodontic treatment time. This surgery technique included buccal full-thickness flaps, selective partial decortication of the cortical plates, concomitant bone grafting/augmentation, and primary flap closure. Following the surgery, orthodontic adjustments were made approximately every 2 weeks. From bracketing to debracketing, the case was completed in approximately 7 months and 3 weeks. Posttreatment evaluation of patient revealed good results. Preexisting thin labial bony cortical plate with lower <b>anteriors</b> was covered. This finding suggests credence to the incorporation of the bone augmentation procedure into the corticotomy surgery because this made it possible to complete the orthodontic treatment with a more intact periodontium. The rapid expansive tooth movements with no significant apical root resorption may be attributed to the osteoclastic or catabolic phase of the regional acceleratory phenomenon...|$|R

5|$|The main {{muscular system}} in {{bivalves}} is the posterior and <b>anterior</b> adductor muscles, although the <b>anterior</b> muscles {{may be reduced}} or even lost in some species. These strong muscles connect the two valves and contract to close the shell. They work {{in opposition to the}} ligament which tends to pull the valves apart. In sedentary or recumbent bivalves that lie on one valve, such as the oysters and scallops, the <b>anterior</b> adductor muscle has been lost and the posterior muscle is positioned centrally. In file shells that can swim by flapping their valves, a single, central adductor muscle occurs. These muscles are composed of two types of muscle fibres, striated muscle bundles for fast actions and smooth muscle bundles for maintaining a steady pull.|$|E

40|$|Background: There {{has always}} been a {{constant}} search for the definition of idealistic and realistic orthodontic treatment goals for different ethnic groups around the world. This study was hence devised to study the mesio-distal angulations and labio-lingual inclinations of the clinical crowns in Dravidian population with pleasing profiles and non-orthodontic normal occlusion. Materials and Methods: Forty dental casts from a Dravidian sample (21. 5 years) with Class I canine and molar relation; normal maxillo-mandibular relationship; well-aligned arches; with no dental anomaly, restorations or attrition; no history of previous orthodontic treatment, and exhibiting normal growth were studied. A custom-made tip-torque device was used to measure the crown angulations and inclinations. The arithmetic mean and standard deviations for each tooth type were compared with those of Andrew′s Caucasian norms using Student′s ′t′ test. Results: The study group exhibited statistically significant decrease in crown angulation (mesial tip) and increased labial crown torque in both upper and lower <b>anteriors.</b> The lower <b>anteriors</b> exhibited distal crown tip while the posteriors were significantly tipped more mesially. All the posteriors demonstrated increased lingual crown torque. Conclusion: Tip and torque modifications are suggested for the fine finishing and easy retention of occlusion in Dravidians while using straight wire appliance...|$|R
40|$|Corticotomy {{facilitated}} orthodontics {{has been}} practising for longer periods, but {{a novel approach}} of a periapical incision to make horizontal cuts 5 mm above {{the apex of the}} maxillary <b>anteriors</b> along with vertical cuts requires a detailed investigation. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the outcome of skeletal cases with spacing in the <b>anteriors</b> using a novel method of modified surgical approach utilizing the corticotomy facilitated orthodontics. Patients for this study were randomly selected from a very intensive screening in the Department of Orthodontics, Saveetha Dental College and Hospital, Chennai, out of which seven patients were selected for this procedure. The patients were subjected for corticotomy procedure under local anesthesia after the leveling and aligning stage (0. 019 " × 0. 025 " stainless steel wire), and the retraction was continued still the space was closed. AutoCAD and palatal rugae assessment programs were used to assess the orthodontic tooth movement. The results of the study demonstrated that when compared to conventional orthodontics alone, the corticotomy facilitated approach produced faster tooth movements in all the seven patients reducing the overall treatment time by 60 %. The use of this modified technique of labial, palatal and apical cuts could be beneficial for adult patients with difficult surgical access from the lingual side...|$|R
