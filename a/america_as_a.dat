5|$|Representations of <b>America</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> female Native American, or Indian princess, dated {{back to the}} 16thcentury; cartographers {{would place}} a native woman, often wearing a {{feathered}} headdress, upon their version of the North American continent.

5|$|A {{controversial}} {{aspect of}} McKinley's presidency is territorial expansion {{and the question}} of imperialism—with the exception of the Philippines, granted independence in 1946, the United States retains the territories taken under McKinley. The territorial expansion of 1898 is often seen by historians as the beginning of American empire. Morgan sees that historical discussion as a subset of the debate over the rise of <b>America</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> world power; he expects the debate over McKinley's actions to continue indefinitely without resolution, and notes that however one judges McKinley's actions in American expansion, one of his motivations was to change the lives of Filipinos and Cubans for the better.|$|E
