60|$|And {{that this}} last was no empty threat is proved by the plain facts of their sacred history. For they DID forget God, and worshipped Baalim, the sun, moon, and stars; and ruin {{of every kind}} DID come upon them, till they were carried away captive to Babylon. And this we must think of when we read the book of Deuteronomy, and nothing else. If they wished to prosper, they were to know and {{consider}} in their hearts that Jehovah was God, and there was none else. Yes-- this was the continual thought which <b>a</b> <b>true</b> <b>Jew</b> was to have. The thought of a God who was HIS God; the God of his fathers before him, and the God of his children after him; the God of the whole nation of the Jews, throughout all their generations.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "harp" [...] {{has also}} been applied to many {{instruments}} which are not chordophones. The vibraphone was (and is still) {{sometimes referred to as}} the [...] "vibraharp," [...] though it has no strings and its sound is produced by striking metal bars. In blues music, the harmonica is often casually referred to as a [...] "blues harp" [...] or [...] "harp", but it is a free reed wind instrument, not a stringed instrument, and is therefore not <b>a</b> <b>true</b> harp. The <b>Jew's</b> harp is neither Jewish nor a harp; it is a plucked idiophone and likewise not a stringed instrument. The laser harp is not a stringed instrument at all, but is a harp-shaped synthesized electronic instrument that has laser beams where harps have strings.|$|R
40|$|This study compares {{dynamics}} in the contestation {{of history and}} identity between Paul to post- 1994 white Afrikaners in South Africa. In reference to Paul, I am interested in how the followers of the nascent Hellenistic Gentile Christian movement claimed legitimacy as the <b>true</b> <b>Jews,</b> usurping the monopoly of the identity ‘true Jews’ from the Jews, who believed that they alone, stand to claim the Abrahamic promise. Instead, Paul contested the Jewish history and identity, claiming that his Gentile Christians were, in fact, the <b>true</b> <b>Jews</b> – how so? The analysis shall be juxtaposed, providing a discursive analysis to the Afrikaners, who regularly receive claims {{that they do not}} belong to South Africa. Specifically, I look into how they contest the South African oral history, claiming that in fact, they are legitimate and the original inhabitants. The study notes that in both cases, identity is constructed through the contestation of history and identity. Thus, the comparison shall be narrowed down to how history is variably, contested for identity formation. Though living within the same locale, the different social groups interpret history differently and variously, appeal to different conspicuous figures and events as their identity markers.

For example, according to Epiphanes (Panarion 29.29), the 'profession of faith Nazarene is that of the Jews in everything but say they believe in Christ.

25|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, {{many of the}} Bnei Menashe started {{studying}} normative Judaism. Hundreds emigrated to Israel, some completing the required formal conversions there to be accepted as Jews.

Others criticised these people as economic migrants, and not <b>true</b> <b>Jews.</b> In 2005, the Chief Rabbinate of Israel accepted them as Jews due to the devotion displayed by their practice through the decades, but still required formal ritual conversion to be accepted as Jews.

40|$|In 1988 I became {{interested}} in the relationship between the ideas of Confucius and those of Mencius. I noticed that what appeared in one form or other in discussions of this relationship was the unelucidated notion of ‘true succession’. 1 The relation has some interesting features. Nietzsche probably had no true successor and Wittgenstein was not his own true successor. Although Marx was <b>a</b> <b>true</b> successor of Hegel and Lenin was <b>a</b> <b>true</b> successor of Marx, Lenin was not <b>a</b> <b>true</b> successor of Hegel. Thus true succession is not transitive. Zeno was <b>a</b> <b>true</b> successor of Pythagoras, but so too was Parmenides. Thus <b>true</b> succession is <b>a</b> one-to-many relation. In Williams 1988 I argued that Mencius was not <b>a</b> <b>true</b> successor of Confucius. One argument I opposed is that the Ta Hsửeh (the authorship of which is obscure) and the Chung Yung are reliable expressions of the ideas of Confucius and since Mencius was <b>a</b> <b>true</b> successor of the author of these two works, it follows that Mencius was <b>a</b> <b>true</b> successor of Confucius (Lu 1983, 81).
