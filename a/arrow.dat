5|$|A replica <b>Arrow</b> {{built by}} Allan Jackson {{was used in}} The <b>Arrow,</b> a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) production. He began {{building}} a full-scale replica of the <b>Arrow</b> in 1989, and was approached by the producers of the <b>Arrow</b> miniseries in 1996, then about 70% complete, who made an offer to complete the construction if the replica {{could be used for}} the production. It was used on the miniseries and several public appearances at air shows. The replica was later donated to the Reynolds-Alberta Museum in his home town of Wetaskiwin, Alberta. While in a temporary outdoor collection, it was damaged in a wind storm in 2009. It has since been repaired, but is no longer on public display.|$|E

5|$|Arrowmen are {{identified}} {{by a white}} sash bearing a red <b>arrow</b> that is worn over their right shoulder. An Ordeal member wears a sash with a lone <b>arrow.</b> The Brotherhood member wears a sash bearing an <b>arrow</b> with a red bar {{at each end of}} the <b>arrow.</b> A Vigil Honor member wears a sash with the same bars of as the Brotherhood sash {{at each end of the}} <b>arrow,</b> and a Vigil Honor triangle on the center of the shaft. Members wear the sash at Order of the <b>Arrow</b> functions and special Scouting activities when members need to be identified as Arrowmen rendering special services. The OA sash is not worn at the same time as the merit badge sash, nor worn folded in the belt. The sash as a form of recognition dates to the founding of the Order and has a long history of changes in usage and design.|$|E

So now the commutative diagrams consist not only of <b>arrows,</b> but <b>arrows</b> between <b>arrows.</b> Composition is given by pasting diagrams.

5|$|Fire arrow: One of the {{earliest}} weaponized forms of gunpowder was the fire <b>arrow</b> which received {{its name from the}} translated Chinese term huǒjiàn (火箭), which literally means fire <b>arrow.</b> In China a 'fire arrow' referred to a gunpowder projectile consisting of a bag of incendiary gunpowder attached to the shaft of an <b>arrow</b> from the 9th century onward. Later on solid fuel rockets utilizing gunpowder were used to provide arrows with propulsive force and the term fire <b>arrow</b> became synonymous with rockets in the Chinese language. In other languages such as Sanskrit 'fire arrow' (agni astra) underwent a different semantic shift and became synonymous with 'cannon.' Fire arrows are the predecessors of fire lances, the first firearm.|$|E

Since its founding in 1915, the Order of the <b>Arrow</b> has grown to become a nationwide program having thousands of members, which recognizes those Scouts who best exemplify the virtues of cheerful service, camping, and leadership by membership in BSA's honor society. As of 2007, the Order of the <b>Arrow</b> has more than 183,000 members.|$|E

Black <b>Arrow</b> was designed to reuse as much technology from the earlier programmes as possible {{in order to reduce}} costs, and simplify the development process. Many senior staff of the Black Knight programme transferred directly to Black <b>Arrow,</b> including the Chief Missile Scientist, Roy Dommett, the Chief Design Engineer, Ray Wheeler and the Deputy Chief Engineer, John Underwood.|$|E

Rama fails to kill Ravana with his {{ordinary}} arrows, but finally kills with a magical <b>arrow.</b> While Valmiki's Ramayana narrates that the magical <b>arrow</b> {{was given to}} Rama by Indra, in other versions the magical <b>arrow</b> is hidden in Mandodari's bed chambers or under her bed. While Mandodari is engrossed in worshipping the goddess Parvati for Ravana's wellbeing, Hanuman comes to her disguised as a Brahmin. After winning her confidence, he tricks her into revealing the secret location of the <b>arrow.</b> Hanuman seizes the <b>arrow</b> and gives it to Rama, leading to Ravana's end. Mandodari appears at the death scene of Ravana in a disarrayed state and laments his death. In this battle, Mandodari loses her husband, her sons, and her kinsmen.|$|E
