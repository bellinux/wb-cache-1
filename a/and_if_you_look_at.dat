[...] Commenting on Ford's political family, Corker said, [...] "I think it's evident there's been a Ford in this (9th District congressional district) seat for 32 years, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the number of Fords that are on the ballotespecially I think the most recent one, I know it concerns a lot of people right here in Memphis." [...] Ford responded, [...] "I don't know why Mr. Corker keeps bringing up my family[...] [...] [...] It's you and I running for the Senate. It's our ideas, our plans to make the future better for everybody. Let's stick to you and I. And if you come up with a recipe to pick family, say it. Otherwise be quiet and let's run for the Senate." ...|$|E
2500|$|He said, [...] "In {{the early}} days, {{every time you}} saw the {{exterior}} of Hogwarts, it was a physical miniature," [...] which was made by craftsmen and occupied a large sound stage. [...] "We {{ended up with a}} profile of how Hogwarts looked, a skyline that actually I didn't design, and it wasn't always satisfactory, and as all the novels got written and movies got made there were new requirements [...] The [...] definitely wasn't there originally, and so we were able to add that substantial piece. And in the last film, we needed an arena for the battle for Hogwarts – the big courtyard outside doubled in size, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the first movie it wasn't there at all. There were quite some liberties taken with the continuity of Hogwarts." [...] In the last film, Craig used a digital model instead of a miniature to [...] "embrace the latest technology".|$|E

5000|$|Wessels {{has been}} trained in both jazz singing and {{classical}} singing.She was first trained in jazz, but later her instructor suggested classical singing to her.

5000|$|The four-door compact saloon body [...] {{was unlike}} any other Porsche, and did not feature the Porsche badge anywhere.

I have a very big band, there are, what, 14 of us, so what you’re going to end up with is more of a live feel in that it's going to be filled in and more dramatic with more layers to it, but never to the point where it's going to feel noisy or overcrowded." ...|$|E
