5|$|Fraser's {{experiences}} {{as an intern}} convinced her that she would prefer medical research to <b>actual</b> <b>practice</b> with patients. When she completed her New York internship in 1926, she moved to Philadelphia, after a brief visit home to Toronto to visit {{her mother and her}} brother Donald. In Pennsylvania, Fraser began her post-doctorate training under the direction of Muriel McPhedran at the Phipps Institute for the Study, Treatment and Prevention of Tuberculosis in January 1927, specialising in bacteriology The experiences in her internships were markedly different in that in New York, she lived at the hospital and the staff was predominantly made up of women. In Philadelphia, she lived in her own apartment in the town and often had to struggle to be accepted as a doctor and be able to see patients. In March, 1927, Fraser was offered a position in the Connaught Laboratories, a research facility dedicated to developing vaccines, where her brother worked. Accepting the position to begin {{at the end of her}} internship in October meant that she would not be joining Williams in England. Williams had hoped that Fraser would join her, where they might be able to live together, but recognized with the choice of going back to Toronto, that would not be possible.|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{analyzing}} Iranian EFL teachers’ beliefs toward classroom {{management and the}} relationship between teachers’ beliefs and their <b>actual</b> <b>practices</b> of classroom management in regard with individual variables such as gender, education degree, and teaching experience. The data were collected using a behavior and instructional management scale inventory and direct class observation through a researcher made classroom management observation checklist. The findings showed that EFL teachers favored interactionalist orientation on behavior and instructional management dimensions. Findings also indicated that male teachers were not significantly different from females in terms of the relationship between their beliefs and <b>actual</b> <b>practices.</b> However, there was a significant relationship between teachers’ beliefs and their <b>actual</b> <b>practices</b> of classroom management among less experienced teachers. It was further found that increase in teachers’ educational level led to decrease in discrepancy between their beliefs and <b>actual</b> <b>practices...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine Turkish English as a Foreign Language Learners' (EFL) {{handling}} of unknown words while reading English texts. The study also examines the relationship between these learners' perceptions and <b>actual</b> <b>practices</b> in the employment of knowledge sources while trying to guess the meaning of unknown words. The participants involved in this study were 40 pre-service teacher education students between the ages of 18 - 22 years old. Data were collected through mixed (qualitative and quantitative) methods, namely, by a twofold vocabulary strategy survey and a lexical inference test. Pearson correlation coefficients were conducted to determine what relationships exist among the perceived behaviours and <b>actual</b> <b>practices</b> of learners for unknown words. The results of the correlation analyses identified an insignificant correlation between the <b>actual</b> <b>practices</b> and perceptions of students for the contextual and intralingual knowledge sources...|$|R
