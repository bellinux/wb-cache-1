Organic photovoltaic cells (OPV), relying on organic light-absorbing molecules, also contain a variety of metals (e. g., Zn, Al, In, Sn, Ag). The environmental impact of such technologies is largely unknown, in particular when the physical integrity deteriorates upon end-of-life, possibly facilitating cell constituent leaching. This study analyzed long-term inorganic leaching from damaged OPV and CIGS into different model waters.

40|$|In this master thesis {{there has}} been studied {{possible}} effects from <b>acidic,</b> metalrich <b>runoff</b> on blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) in the Kaldvellfjord (Lillesand county), {{as a result of}} sulphide oxidation from deposits in the precipitation area with sulphide-containing bedrock. Blue mussels from 6 stations and two depths 1 and 5 m were investigated at different times in 2014. Al, Fe and Mn exhibited the highest concentrations during high freshwater runoffs in both water and blue mussels at 1 m depth. Also at 1 m depth, all investigated metal concentrations in water had positive correlations with runoff. For blue mussels most of the metals showed the same positive correlation pattern. The results were compared to the Norwegian pollution guidelines for metal concentrations in water and soft tissue from blue mussels. The median metal concentrations from the Kaldvellfjord showed polluted values, though the stream Stordalsbekken had periodically values within the most polluted category. Water samples from 1 m depth in the Kaldvellfjord showed significant higher concentrations than the samples from 5 m depth. The concentrations in blue mussels did not show any critical values, although higher concentrations were found in small mussels (20 - 35 mm) compared to big mussels (> 36 mm) in addition to the higher concentrations at 1 m compared to 5 m. High concentration inputs of inorganic dissolved Al from strongly acidified streams are the factor of most biological concern for this fjord, especially near the fresh water outlets. When the fjord with high pH and poor metal concentrations is supplied with metal rich freshwater with low pH, several metals will start to polymerize and precipitate. Among metals, aluminum is known to be very toxic to many gill-breathing organisms during polymerization/precipitation conditions. This may be the reason for the blue mussel mortality seen near acidic, metal rich stream outlets in the Kaldvellfjord. As polymerization/precipitation are very unstable processes, it is difficult to both measure and model the actual chemical conditions. During conditions like this, the use of different bio-monitors like blue mussels is essential for the ability to verify the actual biological effect of various pollutions in the environment. During conditions like this, biological monitoring programs will be of high importance as a background reference in an effect evaluation...|$|R
40|$|Ocean acidification, {{a complex}} {{phenomenon}} that lowers seawater pH, is the net outcome of several contributions. They include {{the dissolution of}} increasing atmospheric CO 2 that adds up with dissolved inorganic carbon (dissolved CO 2, H 2 CO 3, HCO 3 −, and CO 3 2 −) generated upon mineralization of primary producers (PP) and dissolved organic matter (DOM). The aquatic processes leading to inorganic carbon are substantially affected by increased DOM and nutrients via terrestrial <b>runoff,</b> <b>acidic</b> rainfall, increased PP and algal blooms, nitrification, denitrification, sulfate reduction, global warming (GW), and by atmospheric CO 2 itself through enhanced photosynthesis. They are consecutively associated with enhanced ocean acidification, hypoxia in acidified deeper seawater, pathogens, algal toxins, oxidative stress by reactive oxygen species, and thermal stress caused by longer stratification periods as an effect of GW. We discuss the mechanistic insights into the aforementioned processes and pH changes, with particular focus on processes taking place with different timescales (including the diurnal one) in surface and subsurface seawater. This review also discusses these collective influences to assess their potential detrimental effects to marine organisms, and of ecosystem processes and services.

40|$|Abstract. The {{treatment}} of <b>acidic</b> coal pile <b>runoff</b> (CPR) using an alternative constructed wetland design was evaluated. This alternative design, which provided improved wetland performance, {{was based on}} the partial re-circulation of treated water into a detention basin located immediately upstream from a Reducing and Alkalinity Producing System (RAPS). This modification created a semi-passive RAPS-based system we refer to as a Recirculating RAPS (ReRAPS). Previous work suggested that this wetland, utilizing the ReRAPS modification, could dampen the effects of intermittent, or “shock”, loading usually associated with CPR and still achieve desired effluent contaminant concentrations. The {{purpose of this study was}} to confirm the previous results through more frequent chemical and hydrological monitoring. The ReRAPS was monitored during 41 days of CPR treatment, which included four storm events during January through March 2001. The CPR contained an average iron concentration of 12. 8 mg/L, 24. 8 mg/L of aluminum, 2. 9 mg/L of manganese, and 178. 0 mg/L of acidity. The detention pond removed 82 % of the total iron, 59 % of the aluminum, and 35 % of the acidity loading prior to the RAPS component. Manganese behaved conservatively in the detention pond. Average concentrations at the wetland discharge for total iron, aluminum and manganese were less than 0. 20 mg/L. The 2001 wetland monitoring has confirmed that the ReRAPS modification enhances the basic RAPS wetland design by moderating the pH of contaminated water and reducing the contaminant loading prior to the RAPS component...|$|R

Most sites show a large range in pH and major cation and major anion concentrations. The waters draining from the smaller catchments are more acidic and aluminium bearing reflecting {{a higher proportion of}} <b>runoff</b> from the <b>acidic</b> soils in each area. However, there is often a less <b>acidic</b> component of <b>runoff</b> under base-flow conditions due to ground-water contributions particularly within the larger streams. Higher concentrations of nitrate occur for sites which have been felled although declines in concentration occur several years after felling. Multiple regression analysis reveals the importance of cation exchange and within catchment acidification associated with sulphate and nitrate generation. Sulphate also has a component associated with weathering but the patterns vary from catchment to catchment. Analysis of the influence of changing anion concentrations associated with tree harvesting reveals that the acidification induced by increases in nitrate can be offset or reversed by the lowering of chloride and sulphate concentrations due to decreased atmospheric scavenging by the vegetation, reduced evapotranspiration and increased surface runoff diluting the acidity generated. It is concluded that contemporary UK forestry guidelines with an emphasis on phased harvesting of catchments over several years and careful harvesting methodologies can alleviate most problems of stream acidification associated with felling activities and in some cases can reverse the acidification pattern...|$|R

The upland rivers drain acidic soils subjected to long-term acidic deposition. Nonetheless, the <b>acidic</b> <b>runoff</b> from the soils is largely neutralised by high alkalinity groundwaters, although the rivers retain, perhaps as colloids, elements such as Al and Fe that are mobilised under acid conditions.

40|$|Water {{quality in}} fish ponds is af-fected by the {{interactions}} of sev-eral chemical components. Carbon dioxide, pH, alkalinity and hard-ness are interrelated and can have profound effects on pond produc-tivity, the level of stress and fish health, oxygen availability and the toxicity of ammonia {{as well as that}} of certain metals. Most features of water quality are not constant. Carbon dioxide and pH concentra-tions fluctuate or cycle daily. Alka-linity and hardness are relatively stable but can change over time, usually weeks to months, depend-ing on the pH or mineral content of watershed and bottom soils. pH and carbon dioxide The measure which indicates whether water is acidic or basic is known as pH. More precisely, pH indicates the hydrogen ion concen-tration in water and is defined as the negative logarithm of the molar hydrogen ion concentration (-log [H+]). Water is considered acidic when pH is below 7 and basic when pH is above 7. Most pH values encountered fall be-tween O and 14. The recom-mended pH range for aquaculture is 6. 5 to 9. 0 (Figure 1). Fish and other vertebrates have an average blood pH of 7. 4. Fish * Kentucky State University blood comes into close contact with water (1 - or 2 -cell separation) as it passes through the blood ves-sels of the gills and skin. A desir-able range for pond water pH would be close to that of fish blood (i. e., 7. 0 to 8. 0). Fish may be-come stressed and die if the pH drops below 5 (e. g., <b>acidic</b> <b>runoff)</b> or rises above 10 (e. g., low alkalin-ity combined with intense photo-synthesis by dense algal blooms – phytoplankton or filamentous algae). Pond pH varies throughout the day due to respiration and photo-synthesis. After sunset, dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations de-cline as photosynthesis stops and all plants and animals in the pond consume oxygen (respiration). In heavily stocked fish ponds, carbon dioxide (CO 2) concentrations can become high as a result of respira-tion.

40|$|The {{construction}} {{and use of}} roads and tunnels takes a toll on natural resources and especially the biological integrity of downstream freshwater environments. Consequently, aquatic biota is exposed to elevated levels {{of a wide range}} of contaminants, both natural and man-made, which in turn may have negative physiological and ecological effects on resident species. Since the autumn of 2013, the Norwegian Public Roads Administration (NPRA) has been constructing a new tunnel and associated roads on Rv 4 Gran. The bedrock is partly alum shale, which is known to cause a host of environmental issues, such as <b>acidic</b> <b>runoff</b> and subsequent release of metals (e. g. aluminium) and radionuclides (e. g. uranium). These impacts are of great concern, but there are unfortunately considerable knowledge gaps as to their specific impacts at all spatial scales. This study seeks to assess if the Rv 4 project has imposed any negative ecological effects on benthic macroinvertebrate communities in streams and brooks inside impacted areas. In order to do so, benthic macroinvertebrates were sampled using kick-nets during spring and autumn in both 2013 (reference) and 2015 (impact). Macroinvertebrates are relevant bioindicators of environmental disturbance, and are frequently used to assess temporal changes in community composition and metal pollution history. Metals were analysed from mayflies (Ephemeroptera) and water quality variables were measured in situ. In general, although to varying degrees, when compared with reference sites impacted areas were associated with: lower taxa richness, lower taxa diversity, much higher proportion of tolerant than sensitive species, lower ASPT index scores, elevated levels of mayfly metals, and a slightly decreased pH. ASPT index scores were found to be significantly negatively correlated with mayfly metal concentrations (all tested metals and a largely metal-loaded principal component first axis), supporting the use of ASPT index as a relevant indicator and response variable for metal contamination. The results show that road and tunnel construction in areas with alum shale bedrock presents concerns related to ecological integrity and elevated metal concentrations, and measures ought to be taken in order to avoid compromising the health of recipient freshwater ecosystems...|$|E

Samples, collected by local forestry workers (Forest Enterprise staff) on a campaign basis on up to eight occasions, were for 16 mature first rotation standing forest: the remainder represented areas completely clear felled from less than one to up to forty years previously. As the waters drain acidic and acid sensitive soils, <b>acidic</b> <b>runoff</b> is often encountered. However, higher pH values with associated positive alkalinities and base cation enrichments are observed due {{to the influence of}} weathering reactions within the bedrock. There is little systematic variation in water quality between baseflow and stormflow for each site indicating a complex and erratic contribution of waters from the soil and underlying parent material. 80 % or more of the data points show hardly any changes with felling time, {{but there are a few}} outlier points with much higher concentrations that provide important information on the processes operative. The clearest outlier felling response is for nitrate at five of the more recently felled sites on brown earth, gley and podzolic soil types. ANC, the prime indicator of stream acidity, shows a diverse response from both high to low outlier values (>+ 400 to - 300 ?Eq/l). In parallel to nitrate, aluminium, potassium and barium concentrations are higher in waters sampled up to 4 years post felling, but the time series response is even less clear than that for nitrate. Cadmium, zinc and lead and lanthanides/actinides show large variations from site to site due to localized vein ore-mineralization in the underlying bedrock. The survey provides a strong indication that forest harvesting can have marked local effects on some chemical components of runoff for the first four years after felling but that this is confined to a small number of sites where nitrate production and aluminium leaching are high. In general, deforestation leads to a reversal of acidification when the nitrate pulse is low. The variability in water quality from catchment to catchment is too high for generalized conclusions to be made over the extent of the potential changes from site to site. The value of an organised campaign of opportunistic sampling using an infrastructure of enthusiastic staff from regionally dispersed organisations associated with environmental matters (in this case the forestry industry) is highlighted...|$|E
40|$|This thesis assesses {{aspects of}} the wetland development, {{permafrost}} dynamics and associated changes in carbon and nutrient cycling of the Stordalen Mire in northern Sweden. Various ecological and biogeochemical analyses of one peat and two lake sediment sequences were conducted, including analyses of organic matter and carbonate content, mosses, diatoms, testate amoebae, pigments, carbon and nitrogen and their stable isotopes, near infrared spectroscopy and biogenic silica. Results revealed that the structural development of the mire occurred during the later part of the Holocene. Peat inception was dated at 4700 cal BP and onset of organic sedimentation in two adjacent lake basins occurred at 3400 and 2650 cal BP. Fen peat accumulated until minimum 2800 cal BP, and after c. 2650 cal BP an early permafrost aggradation phase likely caused frost heave and {{significant changes in the}} wetland structure and hydrology. Peat is largely missing in the examined core between 2800 and 1350 cal BP, reflecting either environmental stress causing a decrease/cease of peat accumulation and/or erosion of previously formed peat. An increased content of redeposited peat in one of the lakes after c. 2100 cal BP, points to mire erosion caused by permafrost decay. A high nutrient/productivity layer in the other lake between 1900 and 1800 cal BP may have been related to the same event in the mire. Sedge peat accumulated from 1350 cal BP. Renewed permafrost aggradation is indicated indirectly around 700 cal BP and directly 120 cal BP from changes in peat building vegetation. Fen peat and transitions between dominating mire vegetation communities were characterized by frequent diatoms and high nutrient concentrations. Permafrost phases were associated with poor fen and bog formation, and thus considerably more acidic conditions in the mire as compared to pH conditions when richer fen communities dominated. This development resulted in more <b>acidic</b> <b>runoff</b> to adjacent lakes and affected carbonate precipitation there. Further, poor catchment retention of nutrients during poor fen/bog stages, probably caused increased fluxes of nutrients out of the system, stimulating primary lake productivity in adjacent lakes. Increased lake productivity in turn caused increased oxygen consumption for decomposition at the lake bottom, and thus anoxic conditions. Thereby an increased flux of phosphorous from the sediment triggered a state of self-sustained eutrophication during two centuries, preceding the onset of 20 th century permafrost thaw. Proxy indications of peat surface moisture conditions and lake-water TOC concentration dynamics during the last 100 years were reconstructed by means of testate amoebae assemblages in peat and near infrared spectroscopy and the carbon isotopic composition of lake sediment bulk organic matter. These results revealed a close connection with decadal trends of total annual and summer precipitation as well as single years with anomalously high precipitation, especially in the late summer. The data could thus not be directly linked to monitored trends in active layer thickness...|$|E
40|$|Veterinary {{pharmaceuticals}} {{are routinely}} used in livestock production to treat diseases, prevent infections, and promote growth. However, the potential release of pharmaceuticals from agricultural activities has raised concerns {{because they may}} pose detrimental effects to the ecosystems and human health, for example fostering the evolution of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the natural environment. A {{better understanding of the}} environmental fate of veterinary pharmaceuticals is critical to properly assess and mitigate their risks. This dissertation focuses on a major group of veterinary pharmaceuticals, ionophore antibiotics (IPAs), which is sold at over 4 million kilograms per year and constitutes more than one third of the total antibiotic consumption by the livestock industry in the U. S. Despite the extensive usage of IPAs, their environmental fate was not well-understood. Therefore, this study aimed at achieving a comprehensive understanding of the occurrence, persistence, and transformation of IPAs from poultry litter before and after applications to the agricultural lands. Three of the most commonly used members of IPAs were investigated in this study: monensin (MON), salinomycin (SAL), and narasin (NAR). Based on the common management practices of poultry litter, the potential abiotic and biotic transformation reactions of IPAs were examined under varying conditions relevant to the water-soil-litter systems. This dissertation consists of three sections. First, a robust analytical method was developed to quantify IPAs in various environmental compartments, especially in high organic-containing matrices such as poultry litter, and soil and runoff from litter-fertilized lands. Efforts were made to optimize the analytical method with respect to improving extraction recovery, reducing matrix effects, and validating a surrogate standard. Second, lab-scale experiments were set up to determine the chemical properties of IPAs in aqueous environments and to study the abiotic transformation of IPAs, including hydrolysis and photolysis. The results showed that IPAs are prone to hydrolytic transformation in acidic environments, which are likely to be encountered in acidic soils, alum-amended litter (alum: Al₂(SO₄) ₃• 12 H₂O), and <b>acidic</b> <b>runoff.</b> Multiple transformation pathways were proposed based on the identified hydrolysis products. It is also noteworthy that the hydrolysis products of MON still exhibited a toxic effect on the selected microorganism (Bacillus subtilis). SAL and NAR were found to undergo direct photolysis under both UV light and sunlight irradiation. In natural water matrix, IPAs were also degraded by indirect photolysis with hydroxyl radicals generated by light-excited nitrate. Dissolved organic matter can shield IPAs from light and slow down their photolysis. Third, the biodegradation potential of IPAs was first tested in litter and soil microcosms. Factor analysis was conducted to delineate the interaction of water and temperature on IPA degradation in the litter. Litter-fertilized and non-fertilized soil microcosms were compared on the degradation of MON and SAL. Furthermore, the inhibition and biotransformation potential of IPAs were assessed under different redox conditions with litter-enriched cultures. Inhibition tests focused on examining IPAs’ impact on microbial community functions, including denitrification, sulfate-reduction, and methane production. Biodegradation tests were conducted with different electron acceptors, including oxygen, nitrate, sulfate, and organic carbons, with efforts to elucidate primary biotransformation products. On the basis of the results obtained in this study, several recommendations on litter management and IPA selection were made to help mitigate the release and transport of IPAs, as well as enhance their degradation. Overall, this study significantly improved the understanding of the environmental fate of IPAs and the obtained knowledge can aid proper selection of IPAs and management strategies in future applications to minimize the risks of antibiotic micropollutants in the environment.
