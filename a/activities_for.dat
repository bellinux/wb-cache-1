50|$|According to the {{completed}} research {{associated with this}} model, {{it was found that}} people of both sexes who engaged in sexual <b>activity</b> <b>for</b> self-determined motivation had more positive psychological well-being. While engaging in sexual <b>activity</b> <b>for</b> self-determined reasons, the participants also had a higher need for fulfillment. When this need was satisfied, they felt better about themselves. This was correlated with greater closeness to their partner and higher overall satisfaction in their relationship. Though both sexes engaged in sexual <b>activity</b> <b>for</b> self-determined reasons, there were some differences found between males and females. It was concluded that females had more motivation than males to engage in sexual <b>activity</b> <b>for</b> self-determined reasons. Females also had higher satisfaction and relationship quality than males did from the sexual activity. Overall, research concluded that psychological well-being, sexual motivation, and sexual satisfaction were all positively correlated when dating couples partook in sexual <b>activity</b> <b>for</b> self-determined reasons.|$|R
