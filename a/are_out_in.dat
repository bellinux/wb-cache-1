5|$|Specific mating {{courtship}} occurs {{more often}} in the Fall months and usually during the afternoon hours from 11:00 to 13:00 when many of the turtles <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the population feeding. Mating {{is based on a}} male competitive hierarchy where a few higher ranked males gain the majority of mates in the population. Male wood turtles fight to gain access to female mates. These fights involve aggressive behaviors such as biting or chasing one another, and the males defend themselves by retreating their heads into their hard shells. The higher ranked winning males in the hierarchy system have a greater number of offspring than the lower ranked male individuals, increasing the dominant male's fitness. Female wood turtles mate with multiple males and are able to store sperm from multiple mates. Although the mechanism of sperm storage is unknown for the Wood Turtle species, other turtle species have internal compartments that can store viable sperm for years. Multiple mating ensures fertilization of all the female's eggs and often results in multiple paternity of a clutch, which is a common phenomenon exhibited by many marine and freshwater turtles. Multiple paternity patterns have been made evident in wood turtle populations by DNA fingerprinting. DNA fingerprinting of turtles involves using an oligonucleotide probe to produce gender specific markers, ultimately providing multi-locus DNA markers.|$|E
500|$|The Virgin {{occupies}} an earthly {{space as}} opposed to a sacred one, but remains aloof. This approach is emphasised by secondary midground figures who <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the open air, while the main figures are positioned in an elevated room containing a throne, grand arches and wood carvings. Van der Weyden's setting is less artificial than van Eyck's; here Luke and Mary face each other as equals, rather than in van Eyck's painting where, as Blum describes [...] "a divinity and a mortal" [...] face one another. Van der Weyden omits the winged angel holding a crown hovering above the Virgin; the figure was included in the underdrawings, but eventually abandoned. [...] The landscape is more secular than van Eyck's, which is dominated by church spires.|$|E
500|$|Speaking {{about the}} reveal that Fitz was just imagining the {{presence}} of Simmons due to the injuries he sustained {{at the end of}} the first season, Tancharoen said, [...] "We didn’t want him to come out of that experience unscathed. He clearly suffered major trauma to his body. The lack of oxygen to his brain has to have consequences because that’s how it is in real life. We wanted there to be a price. Basically, he in his own Fitz way had professed his love for her, and then he came out of that. How do you come out of that experience without any physical damage, there would still be probably a change to their relationship because the feelings <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the open. But, of course, being the people that we are, we wanted to make it even more painful and compound it." ...|$|E

An exception to this non-scheduling was in 2013 when there was racing {{on the afternoon of}} Mad Sunday. In 2013, Inspector Derek Flint said: [...] "Even though the benefits of the mountain being one way are in place for the entire two weeks these days, Mad Sunday is traditionally a time for that little bit of extra exuberance, which creates us problems when people run out of skill, then run out of road". [...] Police <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> force, and in 2013 [...] large numbers of fans were expected to ride due to very favourable weather forecasts.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1980s in Copenhagen, Denmark, D-A-D started playing {{together}} under their original name Disneyland After Dark. Stig {{came up with}} the name {{based on the idea that}} when the lights <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> Disneyland, anything can happen. He thought the name reflected their music. The first lineup of D-A-D consisted of Jesper, Stig, Peter and Stig’s girlfriend, Lene Glumer. The band's debut concert was at the youth club Sundby Algaard. In December 1982 they forced [...] Lene Glumer to leave the band, as she did not fit in, according to their opinion. The three of them kept playing together and on March 3. 1984 Jespers younger brother, Jacob joined the band at a concert at Musikcaféen in Copenhagen. They all liked the idea of him playing in the band and little by little he became a member of D-A-D.|$|E

2500|$|Gandhi's {{advocacy}} for women's rights began with her help {{in establishing the}} Congress Party's Women's Section. In 1956, she wrote in a letter: [...] "It is because of this that I am taking a much more active part in politics. I {{have to do a}} great deal of touring in order to set up the Congress Party Women's Section, and am on numerous important committees." [...] Gandhi {{spent a great deal of}} time throughout the 1950s helping organize women. She wrote to Norman in 1959, irritable that women had organized around the communist cause but had not mobilized for the Indian cause: [...] "The women, whom I have been trying to organize for years, had always refused to come into politics. Now they <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the field." [...] Once appointed president in 1959, she [...] "travelled relentlessly, visiting remote parts of the country that had never before received a VIP...she talked to women, asked about child health and welfare, inquired after the crafts of the region" [...] Gandhi's actions throughout her ascent to power clearly reflect a desire to mobilize women. Gandhi did not see the purpose of feminism. Gandhi saw her own success as a woman, and also noted that [...] "Given the opportunity to develop, capable Indian women have come to the top at once." ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{are three}} ways that an {{individual}} could become a registered nurse in Japan. After obtaining a high school degree the person {{could go to a}} nursing university for four years and earn a bachelor's degree, go to a junior nursing college for three years or go to a nursing school for three years. [...] Regardless of where the individual attends school they must take the national exam. Those who attended a nursing university have a bit of an advantage over those who went to a nursing school. They can take the national exam to be a registered nurse, public health nurse or midwife. In the cases of become a midwife or a public health nurse, the student must take a one-year course in their desired field after attending a nursing university and passing the national exam to become a registered nurse. The nursing universities are the best route for someone who wants to become a nurse in Japan. [...] They offer a wider range of general education classes and they also allow for a more rigid teaching style of nursing. These nursing universities train their students {{to be able to make}} critical and educated decisions when they <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the field. Physicians are the ones who are teaching the potential nurses because there are not enough available nurses to teach students. This increases the dominance that physicians have over nurses.|$|E
