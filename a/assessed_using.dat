5|$|The {{pathological}} {{absence of}} a discriminatory or selective attachment needs to be differentiated from the existence of attachments with either typical or somewhat atypical behavior patterns, known as styles or patterns. There are four attachment styles ascertained and used within developmental attachment research. These are known as secure, anxious-ambivalent, anxious-avoidant, (all organized) and disorganized. The latter three are characterised as insecure. These are <b>assessed</b> <b>using</b> the Strange Situation Procedure, designed to assess the quality of attachments rather than whether an attachment exists at all.|$|E
5|$|There {{is as yet}} no universally {{accepted}} diagnostic protocol for reactive attachment disorder. Often a range of measures is used in research and diagnosis.

For older children, actual interviews such as the Child Attachment Interview and the Autobiographical Emotional Events Dialogue can be used.

5|$|Epileptic {{seizures}} {{are thought}} to relate to abnormal electrical activity. Seizure activity can manifest as absence (of consciousness), focal effects such as limb movement or impediments of speech, or be generalized in nature. Status epilepticus refers to a seizure or series of seizures that have not terminated within 30 minutes, although this definition has recently been revised. Seizures have {{a large number of}} causes, however many seizures occur without a definitive cause being found. In a person with epilepsy, risk factors for further seizures may include sleeplessness, drug and alcohol intake, and stress. Seizures may be <b>assessed</b> <b>using</b> blood tests, EEG and various medical imaging techniques based on the medical history and exam findings. In addition to treating an underlying cause and reducing exposure to risk factors, anticonvulsant medications can play a role in preventing further seizures.|$|E

The American College of Physicians recently launched its High-Value Care Initiative to help physicians and patients understand the benefits, harms, and costs of interventions and to determine whether services provide good value.
