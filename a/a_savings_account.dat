Fifty years later, he completed the full ring of six bells: one of the six was original, and the other five were rescued from abandoned churches.

In 2009, the hospital opened a new heart care center during its latest expansion. Bassett Army Hospital on Fort Wainwright went through a $132 million renovation in 2005. To meet the demand for a convention center and large sporting arena, the city paid for construction of the Carlson Center, a 5,000-seat arena that opened in 1990. In 1996, the city of Fairbanks privatized its utilities when the Municipal Utilities Service was sold to a private company. About $74 million from the sale was deposited into <b>a</b> <b>savings</b> <b>account</b> called the Fairbanks Permanent Fund, which was invested and managed in a fashion similar to the Alaska Permanent Fund, though residents do not receive any income from the Fairbanks Permanent Fund.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of Argentina's public social programs, aside from {{those related to}} health and housing, are administered by ANSES. Around 95% of Argentine senior citizens (5.7 million) receive ANSES pensions, whose amount is adjusted semi-annually. Argentines {{in the labor force}} earning less than 5,200 pesos (us$350) monthly, are entitled to benefits upon marriage; pregnancy, birth, or adoption of a child; for maternity leave or prenatal care; and for a disability in a child or spouse, as well as to a modest unemployment insurance benefit for up to 6 months. The most important poverty relief program administered by the ANSES is the Asignación Universal por Hijo (Universal Childhood Entitlement). The benefit, 340 pesos (us$70) a month per child, is assigned to 3.6 million children under age 18 (30% of the nation's total), and includes the deposit of 20% of the check in <b>a</b> <b>savings</b> <b>account</b> accessible only upon certification of the child's vaccination and enrollment in school. The program was budgeted at around us$2.5 billion for 2011 (6% of the total). Other recent programs include Conectar Igualdad, which envisaged the purchase of 3 million netbooks for secondary school students and teachers; and PRO.CRE.AR, a subsidized mortgage initiative for moderate income borrowers largely shut out of the nation's tight credit market.|$|E
500|$|After DelaCerna {{stated that}} she would always make sure Copeland could dance, both the {{emancipation}} papers and restraining orders were dropped. Copeland, who claimed she {{did not understand the}} term emancipation, withdrew the petition after informing the judge that such charges no longer represented her wishes. Still, DelaCerna wanted the Bradleys out of her daughter's life. Copeland re-enrolled at San Pedro High School for her junior year (1998–99), on pace to graduate with her original class of 2000. DelaCerna sought Cantine's advice on finding a new ballet school. Copeland began ballet study at Lauridsen Ballet Centre with former ABT dancer Diane Lauridsen, although her dancing was now restricted to afternoons in deference to her schooling. Late in 1998, all parties appeared on Leeza Gibbons' talk show, Leeza, where Copeland sat silently as the adults [...] "bickered shamelessly". As a student, Copeland had a 3.8/4.0 GPA through her junior year of high school. In 2000, DelaCerna stated that Copeland's earnings from ballet were set aside in <b>a</b> <b>savings</b> <b>account</b> and only used as needed.|$|E

2500|$|Reforms {{were carried}} out in 1993. Although all feminist {{projects}} seeking clear recognition of the two sexes were not carried to term, reforms inclined towards a sharing of authority between the two spouses instead of the exclusive authority of the father. Amendment no. 93-74 of July 12, 1993 modified the Code giving wives the right to transfer her patrimony and nationality to children {{to the same extent}} as husbands, even if she was married to a foreigner, on the sole condition that the father has given his approval. Other measures consecrated the participation of the mother in the conduct of business concerning children and the obligatory consent of the mother for the marriage of her minor child. Furthermore, women acquired the right to represent their children in several judicial procedures, to open and to manage <b>a</b> <b>savings</b> <b>account</b> for their benefit. Furthermore, the text makes it obligatory for spouses to be treated with [...] "kindness" [...] and to participate in the management of the home. Until then women had to accept the husband's prerogative. Finally, another prescription annulled the privilege of paternal grandparents to receive support payments for children. It made maternal grandparents equally entitled, eliminating the concept of the patriarchal family.|$|E
2500|$|Five {{years after}} {{serving in the}} missions, Ferrer swore the solemn vows. She was {{subsequently}} transferred from Long Island to Cabo Rojo per request of Ponce's Bishop. Upon arriving, she was received by a procession. As part of this mission, She and the nuns organized baseball teams and sewing schools. She continued working in this convent for 11 years, until she was promoted to abbess. As Mother Superior, Ferré remained in Cabo Rojo for six more years, which is the time limit that a Mother Superior can work within the a mission before receiving another assignment. She was then sent to Hato Rey, where she was assigned to a religious school. Here she replaced part of the institution's materials with new ones, using part of <b>a</b> <b>savings</b> <b>account</b> created by the previous directory. Shortly after she contracted Sepsis, and {{was removed from the}} position. Some time later Ferré traveled to The Bronx, where several of the nuns that studied with her in Philadelphia resided. This congregation focused their attention in discouraging street crime. One day, Ferré was forced to dress a gang member in nun's clothing, to confuse the members of a rival gang. Due to her actions, she was promoted to abbess of the convent. She led the other nuns in an effort to revitalize the city's landscape. New York's governor Nelson Rockefeller, awarded her the city's [...] "Republican Woman" [...] recognition. The community elected her as their official representative in New York's [...] "Committee Against Poverty", but she declined the offer and granted the position to another Puerto Rican resident. She did this because Mayor John Lindsay had previously appointed her as his personal representative. Ferré focused her work in promoting education among street gangs. The convent, interested in promoting community acceptance regardless of religion, was originally called [...] "Dr. White Catholic Center" [...] was renamed [...] "Dr. White Center". During this timeframe she continued her education, briefly attending Holly Family College and completing her bachelor's degree at St. Joseph's College for Women. After a stint as a teacher in Philadelphia, she was sent back to New York in order to complete and further her studies. Ferré completed a sociology master's degree at Fordham University, submitting a thesis based in {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} Puerto Rican families that faced conditions of discrimination and poverty after migrating to the city. Her final work in the United States took place in Chicago, where she coached a group of Puerto Rican community leaders.|$|E
