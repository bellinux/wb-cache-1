5|$|A team {{typically}} {{consists of}} nine competitors: three honors, three scholastic and three varsity.

Students may compete in a higher category than the one they are assigned to, but generally {{it is to the}} students' advantage to compete in the lowest category they can. Scores in Varsity are typically lower than those in Scholastic, and those in Scholastic are typically lower than those in Honors.|$|E
