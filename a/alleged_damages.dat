2500|$|In {{a lawsuit}} {{organized}} by activist organization Our Children's Trust, {{a group of}} plaintiffs aged 8–19 sued the U. S. Federal Government, claiming [...] "the government has known for decades that carbon dioxide (CO2) pollution has been causing catastrophic climate change and has failed to take necessary action to curtail fossil fuel emissions." [...] On April 8, 2016, U. S. Magistrate Judge Thomas Coffin denied defendant's motion to dismiss, arguing plaintiffs have standing to sue because they will be disproportionately affected by the <b>alleged</b> <b>damages.</b> [...] "The intractability of the debates before Congress and state legislatures and the alleged valuing of short term economic interest despite the cost to human life," [...] argued Coffin, [...] "necessitates a need for the courts to evaluate the constitutional parameters of the action or inaction taken by the government".|$|E
2500|$|The {{major players}} of the Trial Smelter dispute were {{the owners of the}} smelter, the Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company of Canada (COMINCO), and the American {{residents}} (mostly farmers and landowners who were affected by the smoke generated from the smelter). The farmers and landowners in Washington who had a mutual concern for the smoke drifting from the smelter, formed the Citizens' Protective Association (CPA) when their direct complaints to COMINCO were not addressed. Initially the regional governments became involved, both the province of British Columbia and Washington State, but eventually the two federal governments took leadership roles in the dispute because of the issue of national boundaries and extraterritoriality. [...] Both governments were initially involved in the foundation of the International Joint Commission (IJC) in 1909, which was later responsible for investigating and then recommending a settlement for the <b>alleged</b> <b>damages</b> in the Trail case. The transformation of the smelter dispute into a foreign policy issue resulted in more institutions joining the dispute. [...] This included the Canada's National Research Council (NRC) and the American Smelting and Refining Company, which each contributed scientific experts to assess the damages from the smelter's smoke.|$|E

Downing, however, calculated that Friesland, and the land provinces, could be counted upon to keep the Dutch position weak, as he thought they would refuse to pay their share of the cost of a war with England. This was in itself not improbable, if only because the land provinces felt threatened by Bernhard von Galen, the Prince-Bishop of Münster, who made territorial demands on parts of Overijssel in the early 1660s. They, not unreasonably, demanded military protection against this aggressor from the Generality. However, Downing miscalculated. De Witt managed to strengthen his position and to start a program of naval rearmament in the summer of 1662. Nevertheless, in the autumn of the same year the Netherlands actually signed a treaty of alliance with England.

50|$|After Brito (in {{his version}} of events) lost part of his farm, he staged a range of public protests {{in order to raise}} public support for his cause, {{including}} a total of six hunger strikes.

In 2006 an appeal to a higher court was ruled inadmissible. A second hunger strike followed, in response to which the president of INTI attended to his case. INTI said that a December 2006 inspection by it found that there was no overlap with neighbours' claims, and new access roads and other improvements made to his property, carried out and financed by INTI. In 2007 the Supreme Tribunal of Justice turned down his case. In 2008, in the face of another hunger strike, according to Agencia Venezolana de Noticias, the president of INTI again intervened over Brito's attempt to invalidate his neighbours' ownership titles, donating agricultural supplies and a tractor, and deforesting 40 acre of Brito's land. According to The Economist, the government had a habit of reneging on its promises after he ended his hunger strikes. At one point Brito turned down almost all of a government settlement of $230,000 on the grounds that he believed it could be seen as illegal and potentially lead to his incarceration for corruption.|$|E

50|$|In October 1995, Dumpit {{was hired}} by the Associated Broadcasting Company to lead its news team as anchor of Balitang Balita, an early evening {{newscast}} and three years later in 1998, she became the anchor of the late night newscast The Big News replacing Tina Monzon-Palma as the lead anchor due to her transfer to ABS-CBN's The World Tonight as Loren Legarda left the newscast when she ran and won as senator in the 1998 elections. Palma took Legarda's chair. After four years as its senior news anchor, Dumpit negotiated for a change in the terms and conditions of her work status and when her contract was not renewed in October 1999, she sent a letter to Jose Javier, Vice President for News and Public Affairs of ABC, stating that she considered this a constructive dismissal of her services. On December 20, 1999 Dumpit filed a complaint against the company for illegal constructive dismissal and demanded payment for <b>alleged</b> <b>damages.</b> After the initial dismissal of the complaint by the Labor Arbiter, the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) reversed the decision and ruled in favor of reinstatement and payment of 2.6 million pesos for back wages. Following the NLRC appeal, ABC filed a petition to the Court of Appeals. The appellate court ruled on January 30, 2004 that NLRC committed a grave abuse of indiscretion and reversed the NLRC's ruling. After almost eight years, on June 8, 2007 the appellate court decision and the subsequent resolution denying the motion for reconsideration were reversed and set aside by a landmark ruling of the Supreme Court of the Philippines. The Supreme Court affirmed NLRC's decision that Dumpit was a regular employee of ABC and that the company's actions constituted illegal dismissal. The decision ruled that Dumpit was to be reinstated to her position as ABC 5 news anchor without lost to seniority and to be awarded almost three million pesos to cover backwages and benefits due a regular employee and for moral damages.|$|E
5000|$|In Canada {{there are}} more ambiguities, as Canadian libel law permits suits to succeed even if no false {{statements}} of fact are involved, and even if matters of public controversy are being discussed. In British Columbia, as part of [...] "a spate of lawsuits" [...] against online news sites, according to legal columnist Michael Geist, several cases have put key issues in online journalism up for rulings. Geist mentioned that Green Party of Canada financier Wayne Crookes filed a suit in which he <b>alleged</b> <b>damages</b> for an online news service that republished resignation letters from that party and let users summarize claims they contained. He had demanded {{access to all the}} anonymous sources confirming the insider information, which Geist believed would be extremely prejudicial to online journalism. The lawsuit, [...] "Crookes versus openpolitics", attracted attention from the BBC and major newspapers, perhaps because of its humorous name. Crookes had also objected to satire published on the site, including use of the name [...] "gang of Crookes" [...] for his allies. Subsequently, Crookes sued Geist, expanding the circle of liability. Crookes also sued Google, Wikipedia, Yahoo, PBwiki, domain registrars and Green bloggers who he felt were associated with his political opponents. Crookes' attempt to enforce BC's plaintiff-friendly libel laws on California, Ontario and other jurisdictions led to an immediate backlash in bad publicity but the legal issues remain somewhat unresolved as of November 2009. Crookes lost four times on the grounds that he had not shown anyone in BC had actually read the materials on the minor websites, but this left the major question unresolved: How to deal with commentary deemed fair in one jurisdiction but actionable in another, and how to ensure that universal rights to free speech and reputation are balanced {{in a way that does}} not lead to radically different outcomes for two people who might for instance participate in a conversation on the Internet.|$|E
