50|$|Advocacy {{groups and}} {{opposition}} political parties {{are likely to}} ask for public inquiries for all manner of issues. The government of the day typically only accedes to a fraction of these requests. The political decision whether to appoint <b>a</b> public <b>inquiry</b> into <b>an</b> event {{was found to be}} dependent on several factors. The first is the extent of media coverage of the event. Events that receive more media interest {{are more likely to be}} inquired. Second, since the appointment of <b>a</b> public <b>inquiry</b> is typically made by government ministers, events that involve allegations of blame on the part of the relevant minister are less likely to be investigated by <b>a</b> public <b>inquiry.</b> <b>A</b> public <b>inquiry</b> generally takes longer to report and costs more on account of its public nature. Thus when a government refuses <b>a</b> public <b>inquiry</b> on some topic, it is usually on these grounds.|$|R

40|$|POLICY Where {{the accused}} does not request <b>a</b> {{preliminary}} <b>inquiry,</b> Crown Counsel should not request one {{unless it is}} required by exceptional circumstances. It is expected that this will occur rarely. Before requesting <b>a</b> preliminary <b>inquiry</b> in such cases, Crown Counsel should consult with Regional or Deputy Regional Crown Counsel and consider all alternatives to <b>a</b> preliminary <b>inquiry,</b> such as preserving the evidence of an ill, aged, transient or potentially recanting witness {{by means of a}} statement which meets the requirements for admissibility set out in Regina. v. B. (K. G.) [1993] 1 S. C. R. 740. Further, Crown Counsel should not request <b>a</b> preliminary <b>inquiry</b> where deficiencies in relation to the investigation, particularly in regard to the taking of witness statements, can reasonably be remedied by means other than <b>a</b> preliminary <b>inquiry.</b> In exercising discretion on whether to request <b>a</b> preliminary <b>inquiry,</b> Crown Counsel should also consider whether a trial can be set for an earlier date than <b>a</b> preliminary <b>inquiry</b> and whether there is a delay factor (Askov) in proceeding with <b>a</b> preliminary <b>inquiry.</b> Where <b>a</b> preliminary <b>inquiry</b> has been requested, Crown Counsel should conduct the preliminary inquiry in as efficient a manner as possible while still calling sufficient evidence to ensure that the preliminary inquiry is of value in the conduct of the trial. Crown Counsel are encouraged to conduct an efficient and focused preliminary inquiry while recognizing that considerable flexibility is necessary {{in order to deal with}} the unique circumstances of individual cases. Where the statement of issues and witnesses provided by defence counsel under section 536. 3 of the Criminal Code is not, in the opinion of Crown Counsel, sufficiently focused on the relevant issues and essential witnesses, Crown Counsel should engage in discussions with defence counsel to seek an agreement to limit the scope of the preliminary inquiry...|$|R

The twenty-fourth charge related to {{his opposition to the}} hydrogen bomb.
