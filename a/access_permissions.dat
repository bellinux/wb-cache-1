25|$|Android {{applications}} {{run in a}} sandbox, {{an isolated}} area {{of the system that}} does not have access {{to the rest of the}} system's resources, unless <b>access</b> <b>permissions</b> are explicitly granted by the user when the application is installed.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{the similar}} command su, users must, by default, supply their own {{password}} for authentication, {{rather than the}} password of the target user. After authentication, and if the configuration file, which is typically located at /etc/sudoers, permits the user access, the system invokes the requested command. The configuration file offers detailed <b>access</b> <b>permissions,</b> including enabling commands only from the invoking terminal; requiring a password per user or group; requiring re-entry of a password every time or never requiring a password at all for a particular command line. It can also be configured to permit passing arguments or multiple commands.|$|E
25|$|When the kernel has an {{appropriate}} device driver in place, it can then access {{the contents of}} the disk drive in raw format, which may contain one or more file systems. A file system driver is used to translate the commands used to access each specific file system into a standard set of commands that the operating system can use to talk to all file systems. Programs can then deal with these file systems on the basis of filenames, and directories/folders, contained within a hierarchical structure. They can create, delete, open, and close files, as well as gather various information about them, including <b>access</b> <b>permissions,</b> size, free space, and creation and modification dates.|$|E

50|$|The Domain {{mechanism}} {{is the heart}} of the protection mechanism. Each BD (bank descriptor) has a lock field consisting of a ring number and domain number. There is also a key field in the state of each activity. If the key matches the lock or the ring in the key is less than the ring in the lock, the activity has Special <b>Access</b> <b>Permission.</b> Otherwise, the activity has General <b>Access</b> <b>Permission.</b>|$|R
25|$|Many modern CPU {{architectures}} (including {{the popular}} Intel x86 architecture) include {{some form of}} ring protection, although the Windows NT operating system, like Unix, does not fully utilize this feature. OS/2 did to some extent, using three rings: ring 0 for kernel code and device drivers, ring 2 for privileged code (user programs with I/O <b>access</b> <b>permissions),</b> and ring 3 for unprivileged code (nearly all user programs). Under DOS, the kernel, drivers and applications typically run on ring 3 (however, this is exclusive to the case where protected-mode drivers and/or DOS extenders are used; as a real-mode OS, the system runs with effectively no protection), whereas 386 memory managers such as EMM386 run at ring 0. In addition to this, DR-DOS' EMM386 3.xx can optionally run some modules (such as DPMS) on ring 1 instead. OpenVMS uses four modes called (in order of decreasing privileges) Kernel, Executive, Supervisor and User.|$|E
2500|$|In Unix-like {{operating}} systems, [...] is {{the command}} and system call which may change the <b>access</b> <b>permissions</b> to file system objects (files and directories). It may also alter special mode flags. The request is filtered by the umask. The name is an abbreviation of change mode.|$|E
2500|$|In Microsoft Windows, $ is {{appended}} to {{the share}} name {{to hide a}} shared folder or resource. For example, [...] "\\server\share" [...] will be visible to other computers on a network, while [...] "\\server\share$" [...] will be accessible only by explicit reference. Hiding a shared folder or resource will not alter its <b>access</b> <b>permissions</b> but may render it unaccessible to programs or other functions which rely on its visibility. Most administrative shares are hidden in this way.|$|E

50|$|Opaque binary blob (OBB) is a {{term used}} in network {{engineering}} and computer science {{to refer to a}} sizeable piece of data, which looks like binary garbage from outside, by entities which do not know what that blob denotes or carries, but make sense to entities which have <b>access</b> <b>permission</b> and <b>access</b> functions to them. It is also a pejorative term for compiled code without the source code made available (see: binary blob).|$|R
50|$|Tumby Island {{is a low}} bedrock island located 500 m east of the {{southern}} tip of Tumby Bay (Tumby Point) in Spencer Gulf, South Australia. The island is a conservation park comprising 35 hectares. The island can be accessed on foot at low tide by traversing shallow water-covered rock flats and curving sand. Visitors should request <b>access</b> <b>permission</b> from DEWNR (Government of South Australia) before visiting and be mindful of the presence of Death adders.|$|R
50|$|LXR {{limitations}} {{are those of}} the support tools, mainly Exuberant ctags. But the primary cause of difficulties comes essentially from incorrect <b>access</b> <b>permissions</b> to files.|$|E
50|$|The BD also {{contains}} a key value and access control fields. The fields indicate whether read, write, or execute permission is granted to the instruction processor (3 bits). The Special <b>Access</b> <b>Permissions</b> (SAP) applies only to activities executing within the owning subsystem (really only those with a matching key value). The General <b>Access</b> <b>Permissions</b> (GAP) applies to everyone else and is usually zero (no access). The Exec sets a key value {{in the state of}} each activity which may be changed by gate and interrupt transitions.|$|E

State variables (i.e. can access, has accessed) can be declared on these fields. For example an analyst may have <b>access</b> <b>permission</b> for the field weightanon but may not have <b>permission</b> to <b>access</b> weight. This will mean {{that they may be}} allowed access to pseudonymized weight data for statistical purposes but should be prevented from matching any value to an individual.|$|R
5000|$|In {{computer}} security, discretionary {{access control}} (DAC) {{is a type of}} access control defined by the Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria [...] "as a means of restricting access to objects based on the identity of subjects and/or groups to which they belong. The controls are [...] in the sense that a subject with a certain <b>access</b> <b>permission</b> is capable of passing that permission (perhaps indirectly) on to any other subject (unless restrained by mandatory access control)".|$|R
40|$|Identity-based proxy re-encryption schemes {{have been}} {{proposed}} to shift the burden of managing numerous files from the owner to a proxy server. Nevertheless, the existing solutions suffer from several drawbacks. First, the <b>access</b> <b>permission</b> {{is determined by the}} central authority, which makes the scheme impractical. Second, they are insecure against collusion attacks. Finally, only queries from the same domain (intra-domain) are considered. We note that one of the main applications of identity-based proxy re-encryption schemes is in the cloud computing scenario. Nevertheless, in this scenario, users in different domains can share files with each other. Therefore, the existing solutions do not actually solve the motivating scenario, when the scheme is applicable for cloud computing. Hence, it remains an interesting and challenging research problem to design an identity-based data storage scheme which is secure against collusion attacks and supports intra-domain and inter-domain queries. In this paper, we propose an identity-based data storage scheme where both queries from the intra-domain and inter-domain are considered and collusion attacks can be resisted. Furthermore, the <b>access</b> <b>permission</b> can be determined by the owner independently. © 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
