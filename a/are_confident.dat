5|$|Mesoscale {{discussions are}} issued to provide {{information}} on certain individual regions where severe weather is becoming a threat and states whether a watch is likely and details thereof, particularly concerning conditions conducive {{for the development of}} severe thunderstorms in the short term, as well as situations of isolated severe weather when watches are not necessary. Watches are issued when forecasters <b>are</b> <b>confident</b> that severe weather will occur, and usually precede the onset of severe weather by one hour, although this sometimes varies depending on certain atmospheric conditions that may inhibit or accelerate convective development.|$|E

Physicians should therefore take steps to encourage and facilitate effective communication, and should consider psychosocial intervention.|$|E
5|$|While {{analyses}} by {{molecular phylogeny}} <b>are</b> <b>confident</b> {{that members of}} Lophotrochozoa are {{more closely related to}} each other than of non-members, the relationships between members are mostly unclear. The Lophotrochozoa are generally divided into: Lophophorata (animals that have lophophores), including Phoronida and Brachiopoda; Trochozoa (animals many of which have trochophore larvae), including molluscs, annelids, echiurans, sipunculans and nemerteans; and some other phyla (such as Platyhelminthes, Gastrotricha, Gnathostomulida, Micrognathozoa, and Rotifera).|$|E

5|$|Open circuit scuba divers by {{definition}} {{are independent of}} surface supply, and must take any gas mixture with them {{that is to be}} used on the dive. However, if they <b>are</b> <b>confident</b> of returning by a specific route, the decompression gas may be stored at appropriate places on that route. The cylinders used for this purpose are called stage cylinders, and they are usually provided with a standard regulator and a submersible pressure gauge, and are usually left at the stop with the regulator pressurized, but the cylinder valve turned off to minimize the risk of gas loss. Similar cylinders are carried by the divers when the route back is not secure. They are commonly mounted as sling cylinders, clipped to D-rings at the sides of the diver's harness.|$|E
5|$|Receipt of Banking Services: A Lebanese Identity Card holder {{can use the}} Lebanese Identity Card as {{identity}} verification document when opening bank account, withdrawing money from the bank or receiving money transfers in the Republic of Lebanon. It is easier for a Lebanese Identity Card holder to also take loan from the bank whether you work in an identifiable institution or not. This is because their identity can be easily verified and the banks <b>are</b> <b>confident</b> {{that they can be}} traced in the event of loan default based on their PIN or biometric information stored on the Lebanese Identity Card.|$|E
5|$|As of 2010 {{there are}} no indisputable body fossils of phoronids. There is good {{evidence}} that phoronids created trace fossils found in the Silurian, Devonian, Permian, Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, and possibly in the Ordovician and Triassic. Phoronids, brachiopods and bryozoans (ectoprocts) have collectively been called lophophorates, because all use lophophores to feed. From about the 1940s to the 1990s, family trees based on embryological and morphological features placed lophophorates among or as a sister group to the deuterostomes, a super-phylum which includes chordates and echinoderms. While a minority adhere to this view, most researchers now regard phoronids {{as members of the}} protostome super-phylum Lophotrochozoa. Although analysts using molecular phylogeny <b>are</b> <b>confident</b> that members of Lophotrochozoa are more closely related to each other than of non-members, the relationships between members are mostly unclear. Some analyses regard phoronids and brachiopods as sister-groups, while others place phoronids as a sub-group within brachiopoda.|$|E

5|$|The {{government}} rejected most of {{the negative}} criticism. The DfES said that the database would only contain basic information and 'will certainly not be including any information on children's diet or school attainment'. Laming had said that information for every child needs to be kept {{so that they would}} not be at risk. The government denied any possibility of function creep. They rebutted the concerns over privacy, with a spokesman for the DfES saying 'we are conscious of the need to respect personal privacy'. Hodge said that the database would be secure, that it would not undermine child protection and that it would help various agencies share information. Hughes said that the database would be secure and that 'we <b>are</b> <b>confident</b> we are doing all we could to ensure security'. The government said that they were confident that the database complied with the Data Protection Act and the Human Rights Act. Paul Ennals, chief executive of the National Children's Bureau, said, 'the index is a proportionate response to a continuing problem and any action that helps reduce the number of children who slip through the net must be welcome'.|$|E

[...] Gordon stated he was not focussed on winning races, citing the average finishing position of 2005 champion Tony Stewart during that year's final ten races. Kenseth hoped he would secure a top-five finishing position at Dover, where he d√©buted in 1998, although he did not rule out the possibility of challenging for the victory.|$|R

25|$|The altarpiece was {{probably}} commissioned in the mid-1470s {{for the new}} apse, and almost certainly completed in 1479. The central frame is inscribed in Latin and reads; OPUS. IOHANNES MEMLING. ANNO. M. CCCC. LXXIX, The date gives clues to the donors on the exterior panels; and because one died in 1475, scholars <b>are</b> <b>confident</b> in a start date before that year. Memling probably began work on the piece as early as 1473, when plans were made to extend the already large 240-bed infirmary, which, with two patients per bed, served about 500 people. As at the Hospices de Beaune, patients in Sint-Janshospitaal could follow the Liturgy of the Hours from their beds.|$|E

Various sponsors including the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the People's Dispensary for Sick Animals and UK's largest dog welfare charity Dogs Trust have since pulled out of the show. On 24 October, principal sponsor Pedigree Petfoods withdrew their sponsorship of Crufts‚Äîestimated at between ¬£0.5 to ¬£1.5 million per year‚Äîending a 44-year relationship, however remained an official sponsor through their Royal Canin Brand. That was followed by major sponsor Hill's Pet Nutrition's withdrawal from the event one week later.|$|E
