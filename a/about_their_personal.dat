5|$|FreeFall Stage {{discouraged}} {{people under the}} age of fifteen from attending because of {{the subject matter of the}} play, but encouraged older teenagers to attend because teenagers are at the greatest risk of being trafficked.

In particular, participants spoke <b>about</b> adjusting <b>their</b> <b>personal</b> styles based upon Michelle Obama’s example (i.e. sleeveless dresses). In that same vein, participants also felt Mrs. Obama gave them authorization to defy traditional social norms for women regarding dress, and empowered them to try more contemporary options.|$|R
25|$|Doctors perform surgery {{with the}} consent of the patient. Some {{patients}} are able to give better informed consent than others. Populations such as incarcerated persons, people living with dementia, the mentally incompetent, persons subject to coercion, and other people who are not able to make decisions with the same authority as a typical patient have special needs when making decisions <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>personal</b> healthcare, including surgery.|$|E
25|$|The {{trial began}} with opening {{statements}} by Theodore Olson and San Francisco Deputy City Attorney Therese Stewart for the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs sought {{to show that}} marriage is a fundamental right; that depriving gays and lesbians {{of the right to}} marry hurts them and their children; {{and that there was no}} reason or societal benefit in prohibiting them from getting married. Charles J. Cooper made an opening statement for the defendants, saying that marriage had been universally limited to opposite-sex couples. The plaintiffs then testified <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>personal</b> experiences as gay Americans, and the reasons why they wished to marry.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{opposing}} {{sides of the}} sex education argument amongst parents: the sexual liberals and the sexual conservatives. Sexual liberals see knowledge on sex as equipping individuals {{to make informed decisions}} <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>personal</b> sexuality, and they are in favor of comprehensive sexual education all throughout schooling, not just in high school. Sexual conservatives see knowledge on sex as encouraging adolescents to have sex, and they believe that sex should be taught inside the family in order for their morals {{to be included in the}} conversation. Sexual conservatives see the importance of teaching sex education, but only through abstinence-only programs.|$|E
50|$|Dynamic consent {{is a new}} {{approach}} to consent that engages individuals in decisions <b>about</b> how <b>their</b> <b>personal</b> information should be used. It is a personalised, digital communication interface that enables two-way communication between participants and researchers, and puts participants at the centre of decision making. It is a practical example of how software can be developed to give research participants control over how their data is used.|$|R
40|$|The aim was {{to examine}} the degree to which people's {{personal}} drug use affects how they perceive other drug users, with a view to investigating the possibility that drug use attributions are a function of self-image bias. University students (n = 60), categorized post hoc as drug users or nonusers, completed questionnaires assessing locus, control, and stability attributions <b>about</b> <b>their</b> own <b>personal</b> drug use or imagined drug use. Attributions pertaining to presented vignettes of light and heavy drug use by others were also assessed. Heavy drug use elicited the most “addicted” attributions (dispositional locus, low control, and high stability) and drug-using participants made more addicted attributions <b>about</b> <b>their</b> own <b>personal</b> drug use than did nonusing participants <b>about</b> <b>their</b> imagined use. Additionally, attributions made by non-drug users regarding <b>their</b> imagined <b>personal</b> drug use were similar to those they made for the light drug use described in presented vignettes. Conversely, drug users made attributions which were similar for <b>their</b> <b>personal</b> drug use and for the heavy drug-use vignette. These data lend support to conceptualizing addiction as a product of the functional attribution process—“addict” attributions being applied mainly where drug use is more problematic (heavy) and thus in need of explanation. The data also lend support to the notion that a self-image bias is operating in drug use attributions when people can identify with the behavior of others...|$|R

25|$|According to the authors, since sexual {{identity}} and orientation is a contentious issue, many healthcare workers are not comfortable in approaching this topic. But if the physicians initiate the conversation, {{it is more}} likely that the veterans will provide this information. Based on their data, if the gay and lesbian veterans can divulge information <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>personal</b> medical history, values, and preferences, they may experience higher levels of patient satisfaction. It is also more likely for them to receive appropriate preventive care and diagnostic screenings for their unique health risks, such as sexually transmitted diseases. Moreover, comprehensive medical records can provide a multitude of information useful not only for medical treatments but also for evaluations, such as the fitness of the veterans for duty.|$|E
25|$|Cabinet Ministers held {{a conference}} at 10 Downing Street on 5pm {{on the day}} of the assassination. They {{suspected}} Anti-Treaty forces (who had recently seized the Four Courts in Dublin) might be responsible – this was in fact not the case – and thought the Irish Provisional Government “should be pressed to deal with the matter”. Macready was summoned to London, where he found the Cabinet worried <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>personal</b> safety but also keen for a dramatic gesture of retaliation, and was asked whether it was possible for British troops to seize the Four Courts – he said that it was but cautioned against precipitate action which might reunite the two Irish factions, and on his return to Dublin deliberately delayed taking such action. Nonetheless, suspicion of Anti-Treaty complicity in Wilson’s murder, and perceived British pressure to do something about it, was one of several triggers of the Irish Civil War.|$|E
25|$|The {{need for}} body {{satisfaction}} and appearance esteem {{continues to increase}} with the abundance of; billboards, magazines, and conversations, displaying “unrealistic images of beauty” (LiveLifeGetActive, 2016). Weight prejudices {{brought up in the}} media or social settings are also prevalent within society. The tendency to link physical attractive qualities with positive personal qualities has been documented since the 1970s. People assign positive personality traits and overall life outcomes to those they perceive as attractive both mentally and physically. The very thin and beautiful models within the media are therefore seen as the most successful and socially desirable people on the planet. In most societies, thinness is typically associated with happiness, success, youthfulness, and social acceptability.  This ideal is heavily portrayed throughout the mainstream media, whereby women are assumed to be perfect in every way. In addition, the idea that a person can never be too thin or too rich, makes it difficult for females to attain any sort of happiness <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>personal</b> appearance. Hence, a women’s attitude towards her body are thus a result of comparing it with those depicted in the media, along with society’s obsession with thinness.|$|E

500|$|The first-look {{poster of}} the film was {{released}} in January 2009. It resembled a book cover and was designed by Nabeel Abbas. The first teaser, featuring all twelve female characters along with the male protagonist, swaying to the title song, was released in July 2009. To promote the film, the makers teamed up with Facebook to develop an application for users to check their compatibility with their partners {{as well as to}} make new friends based on their sun sign. This required users to answer questions <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>personal</b> preferences; based on common characteristics with other signs, a list of users with whom they were compatible was shown and they were offered the opportunity to add those people as friends. According to the makers, the application was launched to tie the promotional activity with the theme {{of the film}}. Sunita A.

500|$|In {{the second}} segment, Springer reveals the second piece of baggage, {{contained}} in the medium-sized suitcase. The suitcases are placed in random order, so the central character does not know to whom each belongs. The three contestants are placed {{on the other side}} of the stage, along with the central contestant. Only the three contestants know which piece of baggage belongs to whom. The main contestant chooses the piece of baggage which is the [...] "deal breaker" [...] (i.e., the one secret that they cannot accept). After stating this, the contestants then return to the other side of the stage and reveal which suitcase belongs to them. The person who claims the deal breaker baggage is immediately eliminated, and later backstage reveals the largest piece of baggage that would have been shown in the final round. The central contestant and two remaining contestants discuss the secrets in the medium pieces of baggage; the two contestants then plead their cases as to why they should be the central contestant's choice. Springer then asks the two remaining contestants, one at a time, a few questions (usually five or six each) <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>personal</b> lives.|$|E
500|$|As Spielberg wanted another {{writer to}} rework the script, Universal {{president}} Casey Silver recommended him David Koepp, co-writer of Death Becomes Her. Koepp started afresh from Marmo's draft, and used Spielberg's idea of a cartoon shown to the visitors to remove much of the exposition that fills Crichton's novel. While Koepp tried to avoid excessive character detail [...] "because whenever they started talking <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>personal</b> lives, you couldn't care less", he tried to flesh out the characters and make for a more colorful cast, with moments such as Malcolm flirting with Sattler leading to Grant's jealousy. Some characterizations were changed from the novel. Hammond went from a ruthless businessman to a kindly old man, because Spielberg identified with Hammond's obsession with showmanship. He also switched the characters of Tim and Lex; in the book, Tim is aged eleven and interested in computers, and Lex is only seven or eight and interested in sports. Spielberg did this {{because he wanted to}} work with the younger Joseph Mazzello, and it also allowed him to introduce the sub-plot of Lex's adolescent crush on Grant. Koepp changed Grant's relationship with the children, making him hostile to them initially to allow for more character development.|$|E
500|$|However, the ban was {{not always}} enforced. Restrictions were briefly lifted during the 1992 general election, {{allowing}} a political debate between the Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams and the Social Democratic and Labour Party leader John Hume to be heard during the election campaign, but the ban resumed once the polls were closed, even preventing Adams' reaction {{to the loss of}} his parliamentary seat from being directly aired. An individual's real voice could also be broadcast if the news item in question did not directly relate to their political beliefs or paramilitary activities. Similarly, anyone subject to the restrictions who was an eyewitness to an event or incident could be heard. In February 1992, the voice of Gerard McGuigan, a Sinn Féin councillor, was broadcast when he spoke about an attack on his house by the Ulster Defence Association. Adams was also allowed to speak about a similar attack against his property. On another occasion, the journalist Peter Taylor was given access to inmates at the Maze Prison for a documentary about the jail, but while the prisoners were allowed to speak freely <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>personal</b> lives, a complaint by the IRA prisoners' food spokesman concerning the size of the prison's sausage rolls had to be revoiced.
