5|$|Whale {{returned}} to California in November 1952 and advised David Lewis {{that he planned}} to bring Foegel over early the following year. Appalled, Lewis moved out of their home. While this ended their 23-year romantic relationship, the two men remained friends. Lewis bought a small house and dug a swimming pool, prompting Whale to have his own pool dug, although he did not himself swim in it. He began throwing all-male swim parties and would watch the young men cavort in and <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool.</b> Foegel moved in with Whale in early 1953 and remained there for several months before returning to France. He returned in 1954 permanently, and Whale installed him as manager of a gas station that he owned.|$|E
25|$|Radiation <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> can get so {{high that}} a person is not allowed to stay more than 2 minutes, seriously {{affecting}} decommissioning. The pool is not watertight; time and weather have created cracks in the concrete, letting contaminated water leak.|$|E
25|$|In 1762, Ahmad Shah Durrani {{returned}} {{and had the}} Golden Temple blown up with gunpowder. Sikhs {{returned and}} celebrated Divali in its premises. In 1764, Jassa Singh Ahluvalia collected donations to rebuild the Golden Temple. A new main gateway (Darshani Deorhi), causeway and sanctum were completed in 1776, while the floor <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> was completed in 1784. The Sikhs also completed a canal to bring in fresh water from Ravi River for the pool.|$|E
50|$|<b>Around</b> <b>the</b> <b>pools</b> is a garden, as well {{as various}} stones, {{including}} some {{in the shape of}} lingga and yoni. In 1876, the Dutch scholar R.H.T. Friederich proposed {{that there may have been}} two temples at the site, although no bases have been discovered. His proposal of two temples is supported by similarities in the carving of the stones and reliefs, suggesting that they were not part of the same temple.

25|$|Wilder {{was adamant}} that {{the corpse of}} Joe Gillis {{be seen from the}} bottom of the pool, but {{creating}} the effect was difficult. The camera was placed inside a specially constructed box and lowered underwater, but the result disappointed Wilder, who insisted on further experiments. The shot was finally achieved by placing a mirror on the bottom of the pool and filming Holden's reflection from above with the distorted image of the policemen standing <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> and forming a backdrop.|$|E
25|$|The Golden Temple complex {{originally}} {{was open and}} had numerous trees <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool.</b> It is now a walled, two storey courtyard with four entrances, that preserve three Ber trees (jujube). One of them is {{to the right of}} the main ghanta ghar deori entrance with the clock, and it is called the Ber Baba Buddha. It is believed in the Sikh tradition to be the tree where Baba Buddha sat to supervise the construction of the pool and first temple.|$|E
25|$|On 11 March 1977, {{three years}} after making Chinatown, Polanski was arrested at Jack Nicholson's home for the sexual assault of 13-year-old Samantha Gailey, who was {{modeling}} for Polanski during a Vogue magazine photo shoot <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool.</b> Polanski was indicted on six counts of criminal behavior, including rape. At his arraignment, he {{pleaded not guilty to}} all charges. Many executives in Hollywood came to his defense. Gailey's attorney next arranged a plea bargain in which five of the six charges would be dismissed, and Polanski accepted.|$|E

25|$|The Harmandir Sahib is an {{open house}} of worship for all men and women, {{from all walks of}} life and faith. It has a square plan with four entrances, has a circumambulation path <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool.</b> The temple is a {{collection}} of buildings around the sanctum and the pool. One of these is Akal Takht, the chief center of religious authority of Sikhism. Additional buildings include a clock tower, the offices of Gurdwara Committee, a Museum and a langar – a free Sikh community run kitchen that serves a simple vegetarian meal to all visitors without discrimination. Over 100,000 people visit the holy shrine daily for worship.|$|E
25|$|The Morris water {{navigation}} task is {{a classic}} test for studying spatial learning and memory in rats and was first developed in 1981 by Richard G. Morris for whom the test is named. The subject is placed in a round tank of translucent water with walls that are too high for it to climb out and water that is too deep for it to stand in. Additionally, {{the walls of the}} tank are decorated with visual cues to serve as reference points. The rat must swim <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> until by chance it discovers just below the surface the hidden platform onto which it can climb.|$|E

500|$|After hearing Quagmire {{brag about}} his sexual exploits, Peter {{feels that he}} has missed out on enjoying the single lifestyle. Death is summoned to The Drunken Clam on a false alarm (thinking that Horace had died), and decides to grant Peter's wish by sending him, along with Brian, back to 1984 for one night. He notices his friend Cleveland, in his '80s look, who high-fives him <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool.</b> He then sees 18-year-old Lois Pewterschmidt walking around the country club pool, taking her high-heeled shoes off and jumping off the diving board into the pool with [...] "Mr. Night" [...] playing in the background, a {{reference}} to Caddyshack. [...] Appearing to others as his 18-year-old self, Peter cancels his scheduled movie date to see Zapped! with Lois, instead accepting an invitation from Cleveland to go and party at a bar. Peter enjoys the evening, and ends up making out with actress Molly Ringwald before Death appears to return him to the present.|$|E
500|$|The album's artwork {{was photographed}} by Harry Langdon in the {{swimming}} pool of the Jackson family's home. Jackson described Langdon as [...] "the sweetest man imaginable". She took inspiration from a photograph of actress Elizabeth Taylor submerged {{in a swimming pool}} which was taken early in her career. In the photograph, nothing could be seen apart from Taylor's face above the water; her body was hidden beneath the surface. Jackson thought the pose was dramatic and loved the fact that she could do the same thing, and not to have to reveal anything except for her face. With the photographer, his assistant and other people <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool,</b> she was still reluctant to take off her robe, and stand there in her bathing suit. She waited until everybody got distracted to slip into the pool. After they took the photos, she waited until everybody was gone {{to get out of the}} pool.|$|E
500|$|After he {{read the}} script, Connery {{realised}} {{the risk of the}} sequence with the sharks in Largo's pool and insisted that production designer Ken Adam build a Plexiglas partition inside the pool. The barrier was not a fixed structure, so when one of the sharks managed to pass through it, Connery fled the pool, seconds away from attack. Ken Adam later told UK daily newspaper The Guardian, [...] "We had to use special effects, but unlike special effects today, they were real. The jet pack we used in Thunderball was real - it was invented for the United States Army. Bloody dangerous, and it only lasted a couple of minutes. The ejector seat in the Aston Martin was real and Emilio Largo's boat, the Disco Volante, was real. You had power boats at that time, but there were no good-sized yachts that were able to travel at 40 to 50 knots, so it was quite a problem. But by combining a hydrofoil, which we bought in Puerto Rico for $10,000, and a catamaran, it at least looked like a big yacht. We combined the two hulls with a one-inch slip bolt and when they split it worked like a dream. We used lots of sharks for this movie. I'd rented a villa in the Bahamas with a saltwater pool which we filled with sharks and used for underwater filming. The smell was horrendous. This was where Sean Connery came close to being bitten. We had a plexiglass corridor to protect him, but I didn't have quite enough plexiglass and one of the sharks got through. He never got out of a pool faster in his life - he was walking on water." [...] When special-effects coordinator John Stears provided a supposedly dead shark to be towed <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool,</b> the shark, which was still alive, revived at one point. Due to the dangers on the set, stuntman Bill Cummings demanded an extra fee of £250 to double for Largo's sidekick Quist as he was dropped into the pool of sharks.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{the effect of}} research and investment activities on patents across countries, industries and over time, using Poisson and negative binomial distribution models. The first result of {{the paper is the}} recognition of the importance of investment activities in contributing to technical change. The positive role of research expenditures is also confirmed but its elasticity is found to be lower than in previous studies. Important differences across sectors emerge: research expenditures are found to be more effective in generating patents in science based industries, while investment is particularly significant in supplier dominated and production intensive industries. Finally, in most sectors, the estimated R&D and investment coefficients lie outside the confidence intervals calculated <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>pooled</b> coefficients. ...|$|R

2500|$|Mall B was {{landscaped}} with a reflecting {{pool and}} fountains after {{the convention center}} was completed. This space, designed by landscape architects Gilmore David Clarke and Michael Rapuano, featured a [...] deep, [...] reflecting pool. The bottom of the pool featured gravel-impregnated grout laid down in alternating grey and white sections, each section separated by a thin brass rail. A pitched lip of German granite, [...] wide, surrounded the pool. Grey slabs of German granite formed a sidewalk <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool.</b> The pool was surrounded by 10 fountains.

I scouted quite a few pools, but when I saw this pool in the YMCA in Central London, which was dark blue tiled with light blue lane stripes instead of the normal reverse colors, I knew it was the ideal location. I wanted to give it an eerie underwater night-time feel, and this setting was perfect. We used a number of 1000K and 2000K lights <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> edge.
