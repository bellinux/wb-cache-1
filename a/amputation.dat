According to Solvang (2007), “Devotees adhere to standard conceptions of attractiveness in all other matters outside of amputations.” A Jungian explanation for the fetish is that it stems from a desire to resolve discontinuities in the collective subconscious by means of distorting the geometric representation of man, which traditionally involves five points, six when focusing on male sexuality, and seven when discussing incarnations of the Logos from certain religious cultures.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{retrospective}} study was to evaluate the changes in diabetes-related lower extremity <b>amputations</b> following {{the implementation of a}} multidisciplinary programme for prevention and treatment of diabetic foot ulcers in a 0. 2 million population with a 2. 4 % prevalence of diabetes. All diabetes-related primary <b>amputations</b> from toe to hip from 1 January 1982 to 31 December 1993 were included. In 294 diabetic patients, 387 primary major (above the ankle) or minor (through or below the ankle) <b>amputations</b> were performed, constituting 48 % of all lower extremity <b>amputations.</b> The annual number of <b>amputations</b> at all levels decreased from 38 to 21, equalling a decrease of incidence from 19. 1 to 9. 4 / 100, 000 inhabitants (p = 0. 001). The incidence of major <b>amputations</b> decreased by 78 % from 16 / 1 to 3. 6 / 100, 000 inhabitants (p < 0. 001). The absolute number of <b>amputations</b> with a final level below the ankle showed no increase, but their proportion increased from 28 to 53 % (p < 0. 001) and the reamputation rate decreased from 36 to 22 % (p < 0. 05) between the first and last 3 -year period. Thus, a substantial long-term decrease in the incidence of major <b>amputations</b> was seen as well as a decrease in the total incidence of <b>amputations</b> in diabetic patients. Seventy-one per cent of the <b>amputations</b> were precipitated by a foot ulcer. These findings indicate that a multidisciplinary approach plays an important role to reduce and maintain a low incidence of major <b>amputations</b> in diabetic patients...|$|R

40|$|The authors {{consecutively}} recorded all {{lower limb}} <b>amputations</b> {{performed at the}} University Hospital of Trondheim from January 1 st, 1994 to January 1 st, 1997. A total of 215 primary lower limb <b>amputations</b> were {{carried out in the}} study period: 40 partial foot <b>amputations,</b> 2 ankle disarticulations, 51 trans-tibial <b>amputations,</b> 68 knee disarticulations, 50 trans-femoral <b>amputations</b> and 4 hip disarticulations. Seventy-four (74) (34 %) of the amputees had diabetes mellitus, 113 (53 %) had peripheral vascular disease and 28 (13 %) of the amputees had various diagnoses. In those who were amputated due to diabetic and peripheral vascular disease the overall reamputation rate was 19 % and 20 %, respectively. The rates of reamputation at the trans-tibial and knee level were similar. In the city of Trondheim the annual incidence of primary <b>amputations</b> was 34 per 100, 000 and 4. 4 per 1, 000 diabetic subjects.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to give a {{retrospective}} review of all lower limb <b>amputations</b> performed in the 3 northern provinces of the Netherlands in 1991 - 1992. Assembled data were compared with the existing information in the National Medical Register (NMR) over the same period. With the participation of all regional hospitals, 473 lower limb <b>amputations</b> from transpelvic to transmetatarsal level were identified. Of the <b>amputations</b> 94 % were performed for vascular pathology, 3 % for trauma, and 3 % for oncologic reasons. After surgery a prosthesis was provided to 48 % of the amputees. The actual number of performed <b>amputations</b> exceeds the number of <b>amputations</b> registered by the NMR by 9 %. Incidence rates of lower limb <b>amputations</b> in the Netherlands are 18 - 20 / 100, 000 over the last 12 years.

5|$|A. piscivorus venom is more toxic {{than that}} of A. contortrix, and is rich with {{powerful}} cytotoxic venom that destroys tissue. Although deaths are rare, the bite can leave scars, and on occasion, require <b>amputation.</b> Absent an anaphylactic reaction in a bitten individual, however, the venom does not cause systemic reactions in victims and does not contain neurotoxic components present in numerous rattlesnake species. Bites can be effectively treated with CroFab antivenom; this serum is derived using venom components from four species of American pit vipers (the eastern and western diamondback rattlesnakes, the Mojave rattlesnake, and the cottonmouth).|$|E
