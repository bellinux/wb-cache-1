50|$|An <b>acoustic</b> <b>board</b> is {{a special}} kind of board made of sound {{absorbing}} materials. Its job is to provide sound insulation. Between two outer walls sound absorbing material is inserted and the wall is porous. Thus, when sound passes through an <b>acoustic</b> <b>board,</b> the intensity of sound is decreased. The loss of sound energy is balanced by producing heat energy.|$|E

40|$|This study {{proposes a}} room {{equalizer}} {{which uses a}} movable and variable <b>acoustic</b> <b>board</b> and revises frequency response, and is also applicable {{to a variety of}} places. When equalizing frequency response, commonly used electric graphic equalizers or parametric equalizers have the same effect as the sound signals such as audio passing through electrical elements like condenser or coil, and phase shift of audio signal occurs at this time. Accordingly, they secure frequency response by adjusting and equalizing the characteristics of sound-absorbing materials without any distortion of the original sound. Therefore, this study proposes a room equalizer that does not use these electrical characteristics, but uses non-electronic spatial matching with an excellent sound persistency rate to enable its application to various changes in space and time...|$|E
40|$|Acoustic ranging based indoor {{positioning}} solutions {{have the advantage}} of higher ranging accuracy and better compatibility with commercial-off-the-self consumer devices. However, similar to other time-domain based approaches using Time-of-Arrival and Time-Difference-of-Arrival, they suffer from performance degradation in presence of multi-path propagation and low received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in indoor environments. In this paper, we improve upon our previous work on asynchronous acoustic {{indoor positioning}} and develop ARABIS, a robust and low-cost acoustic positioning system (IPS) for mobile devices. We develop a low-cost <b>acoustic</b> <b>board</b> custom-designed to support large operational ranges and extensibility. To mitigate the effects of low SNR and multi-path propagation, we devise a robust algorithm that iteratively removes possible outliers by taking advantage of redundant TDoA estimates.

40|$|Many {{countries}} in hot-humid regions cope with rapid urbanisation. Land cost becomes higher especially in high-density areas. There is a demand of {{residential and commercial}} buildings due to the {{economic growth in the}} cities. Row house became a popular building type since it combines both functions in one place. A large amount of row houses are found in Bangkok, Thailand. Despite their versatility, they are not properly designed for the climate and urban conditions. The occupants adopt air conditioning systems to control indoor comfort whereas row houses are not properly designed for the installation of the airconditioners. This increases the energy demand. This research aims to establish appropriate design guidelines and recommendations to ensure indoor comfort in urban row houses in hot-humid climates. Thermal comfort is the main concern apart from others such as visual, acoustic and indoor air quality. Thermal stress should be minimised by primarily passive means as long as possible and the building design should also provide the flexibility for operating active systems whenever they are required. To achieve this aim, it is important to assess indoor conditions in existing row houses to provide a basis of comparison. A case study in Bangkok has been selected for a field investigation during the hottest month of the year to examine how the case study responds to the critical condition. Flow visualisation tests have been conducted to compare the results of indoor air velocity to those of the field investigation. Computer simulations have been carried out to investigate and compare the performance of design variables affecting indoor comfort such as orientation, zone location, roof and wall materials, aperture schedules, and shading devices. Two blocks of 4 -level row houses have been simulated and three units: an intermediate and two units at the both ends of the row have been examined. There are two sets of the simulations: naturally ventilated and air-conditioned cases. Then, the design guidelines and recommendations are developed based on the results from the two series of simulations. Results from the 3 -day field investigation show that indoor conditions of the case study are overheated. The indoor temperatures are slightly lower than To during the day while they are higher than To during the night. These results correspond to those of simulation runs for a verification study. The wind tunnel test shows low indoor air velocities. It is recommended to install ceiling fans to increase the wind speed enough to generate cooling effect. The level of interior illuminance drops with distance from the window. It should be improved by installing artificial light sources in the area far from the opening. The sound levels exceed the noise control limit at all times. Results from the simulations for the naturally ventilated and air-conditioned row houses show some similarities. In the former, internal conditions of the occupied units are above the comfort limit almost all day. Orientation is a crucial factor affecting the indoor thermal condition. The front of a row house should face either north or south and the end unit with east-facing side wall performs better than that with west-facing side wall. The worst orientation is generally west but the east could be worse for the end unit with south-facing side wall at such an orientation. The effect of zone location is also related to the orientation. The intermediate unit is more sensitive to design variables since it generally shows the biggest T difference between the variants with the best and the worst design factors. Aperture schedule has a great effect on indoor conditions for naturally ventilated cases. Closing windows during the day could keep the zone cooler than opening the windows which would admit the hot air from the outside. Concrete flat roof with ceiling insulation gives the best results while metal sheet roof gives the worst. Concrete block with <b>acoustic</b> <b>board</b> performs best for both naturally ventilated and air-conditioned buildings while the worst wall type is aerated concrete in cases of the naturally ventilated buildings and common brick wall in cases of the air-conditioned ones. However, the results from the effect of roof and wall material study show that adding insulation could improve the indoor condition more effectively than changing the roof and wall materials. An additional height from the mezzanine floor only affects the thermal performance of the room on ground floor. In comparison to the row house without mezzanine floor, the presence of mezzanine slightly increases indoor temperature in naturally ventilated cases while increases cooling load of the room on the ground floor drastically in air-conditioned cases. Shading devices should be designed particularly for each orientation since their effects are tremendous once applied to the opening to protect it from solar radiation. The limited distance between the front of row houses and the street as allowed in the existing building regulations should be extended for the devices to provide enough shading for the building...|$|E

30|$|The <b>acoustic</b> {{properties}} of <b>board</b> material are well defined and are gauged {{in terms of}} absorption, reflection, impedance, admittance, and transmission loss. Sound-absorbing materials are those materials designed and used for absorbing sound {{that might otherwise be}} reflected. Sound is absorbed when part of the energy striking a surface or an object is converted into heat energy in the pores of the material. Therefore, sound absorption is described as heat conversion of energy. The sound-absorbing characteristics of acoustical materials vary significantly with frequency. For the vast majority of conventional acoustical materials, material thickness has the greatest influence on the material’s sound-absorbing qualities. The absorption coefficient also varies with the frequency and angle of incidence of the sound. Generally, higher frequencies are more easily absorbed than the low frequencies. Materials that are good absorbers allow sound to pass through them relatively easily. Sound-absorbing materials commonly used in construction include porous materials such as glass wool, gypsum, and similar materials.|$|R
40|$|The {{industrial}} waste dumped 180 n. {{miles south of}} Galveston was monitored in July 1977 by water sampling, hydrographic measurements, <b>acoustic</b> tracking on <b>board</b> two vessels, and by aerial photography. The plume of the waste diffused vertically and horizontally. Photodensitometry of aerial photos of the plume showed lateral dispersion of the plume in agreement with two other methods: acoustic tracking of the waste suspensoid and transmissometer sampling. In addition, the method showed small scale features like the lateral and longitudinal variations in the photodensity, indicating the waste concentration. This waste concentration showed periodic changes in its axial distance, with the spectral peak at about 160 m wave length. It shows a sharp increase at the windward edge of the plume as do the acoustic records.

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this study}} was to present a new method for {{resource}} utilization of nonmetal particles from waste printed circuit <b>boards.</b> <b>Acoustic</b> properties of loose particle mixes and their consolidated composites were investigated. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation shows that the nonmetal particles exhibit high irregular shapes and forms an extensive network of micro-pores in the consolidated composites. The acoustic absorbers made from the nonmetal particles exhibit excellent sound absorption ability in broadband frequency ranges. When the particle size is larger than 0. 3 mm, the average absorption coefficients are 0. 79 and 0. 74 for the loose and consolidated materials in the frequency range from 100 to 6, 400 Hz. It was found that the consolidation process did not significantly affect the absorption performance when the particle size is larger than 0. 15 mm.

40|$|Solder bump {{technology}} {{is being used}} increasingly {{as a method of}} interconnection of chips or packages to the substrate. Underfill is used to encapsulate the solder joints commonly in flip chips and is starting to be used between BGA packages and the boards. The condition of the underfill layer is critical to the operation of the device as this layer serves to redistribute the mechanical stresses in the sample and thereby reduce the stresses on the solder interconnections[1]. Voids and delaminations in the underfill can compromise the reliability of the device and seriously reduce its lifetime. For reliability assessment of the underfill a nondestructive method is needed. X-ray imaging has been used to examine the condition of the solder bumps in flip chip and BGA packages; however, the contrast provided in the x-ray images is insufficient for analysis of the underfill. Acoustic Micro Imaging (AMI) is a method that has been used {{over the past several years}} for evaluation of underfill in flip chips with successful results.

40|$|International audienceSonar data is {{commonly}} affected by noise {{due to the}} processing of scatter signals and interference of acoustic waves scattered from the seabed. To overcome this problem and to limit the noise in sonar images, the sonar operator can change the sonar settings (e. g. range, pulse length, modulation, inter-track distance, etc.) to acquire the best possible <b>acoustic</b> data. On <b>board</b> autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV), due to the low bandwidth of the communication with the robot, the real time definition of the best settings by an operator is nearly unfeasible. For these reasons, we have developed an analysis method for automatically assessing {{the quality of the}} data. The results of this process are then sent to the AUV planning module which can change the sonar settings (e. g. inter-track distance). The classical approach is based on the correction of the artefacts related to the wave propagation in water column and the characteristics of the sonar system. This approach requires strong a priori knowledge of the system and the conditions of acquisition of the sonar data. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} propose a statistical measure of quality of the sonar data acquired using AUVs. This statistical measure would be representing a quality map for the input sonar data. As no prior measurement of similarity or dissimilarity of sonar images is given, the decision to whether accept the quality of data as noisy/non-noisy will be based upon statistical hypothesis testing. To accomplish the quality mapping, spectral domain filtering is performed to extract the residual image representing the speckle. Based on Maximum Likelihood (ML) method, parameters are estimated from the data for Rayleigh distribution and its fit is evaluated using Goodness-of-fit (Gof) test. Experimental results show the viability of the proposed approach while mapping the data into quality matrix representing the acceptable regions on sonar data acquired using DAURADE...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} {{development}} and deployment of a remotely-controlled underwater robotic vehicle capable of being teleoperated under ice under real-time human supervision. The Nereid Under-Ice (Nereid-UI or NUI) vehicle enables exploration and detailed examination of biological and physical environments including the ice-ocean interface in marginal ice zones, {{in the water column}} of ice-covered seas, at glacial ice-tongues, and ice-shelf margins, delivering realtime high definition video in addition to survey data from on <b>board</b> <b>acoustic,</b> optical, chemical, and biological sensors. The vehicle employs a novel lightweight fiber-optic tether that will enable it to be deployed from a ship to attain standoff distances of up to 20 km from an ice-edge boundary. We conducted NUI’s first under-ice deployments during the July 2014 F/V Polarstern PS 86 expedition at 86 ° N 6 W° in the Arctic Ocean - near the Aurora hydrothermal vent site on the Gakkel Ridge approximately 200 km NE of Greenland. We conducted 4 dives to evaluate and develop NUI’s overall functioning and its individual engineered subsystems. On each dive, dead-reckoning (Ice-locked Doppler sonar and north-seeking gyrocompass) complemented by acoustic ranging provided navigation, supporting closed-loop control of heading, depth, and XY position relative to the ice. Science operations included multibeam transects of under-ice topography, precision vertical profiles for the bio-sensor suite and IR/radiance sensor suite, IR/radiance/multibeam transects at constant depth interlaced with vertical profiles and upward-looking digital still-camera surveys of the ice, including areas rich with algal material. The fiber-optic tether remained intact throughout most of all 4 dives. Consistent with the NUI concept of operations, in 3 of 4 dives the fiber-optic tether eventually failed, and the vehicle was then commanded acoustically in a series of short-duration maneuvers to return to Polarstern for recovery. These preliminary dives ranging up to 800 m from Polarstern at a max. depth of 45 m, and traveling up to 3. 7 km under moving sea ice.

40|$|The {{upwelling}} {{zones in}} Mauritanian coastal waters provide food-rich conditions for fish. Fish-stocks are exploited {{by a large}} international fleet of freeze-trawlers. Trawlers, fish and fish predators therefore congregate in a relatively narrow strip where the upwelling takes place. As an unwanted side-effect large animals, such as cetaceans, sharks and rays are accidentally caught in the nets. To be able to estimate the effect of by-catches on local populations of these groups informationon densities and occurrence in relation to season and environmental variables is needed. In April 2004 the Netherlands Institute for Fisheries Research (RIVO) and Alterra conducted a pilot survey of marine mammals and seabirds {{in cooperation with the}} Mauritanian Institute for Oceanographic and Fisheries Research (IMROP). As sea mammals often interact and form multi- species feeding associations with seabirds, the census included both sea mammals and seabirds. The main aim of the project was to investigate the suitability of the combination of a survey of marine mammals and seabirds with an acoustic survey that is carried out twice per year to assess pelagic fish stocks. The ultimate goal is to set up a monitoring program with several surveys per year. If the combination with the acoustic survey is useful and successful, the monitoring program can be carried out at relatively low cost. Between 16 and 28 April 2004 two observers joined the <b>acoustic</b> survey on <b>board</b> the Al Awam, the research vessel of IMROP. A total of 28 transects positioned East-West at distances of 10 nm apart were sampled, at depths varying from 20 m to 500 m. All marine mammals and seabirds encountered were noted, using standard seabirds at sea counting methods. Besides assessing numbers, also behaviour was recorded, following the observation protocol for ship-based seabird surveys in Europe. Observations were carried out when the ship was steaming. During fishing operations (2 - 5 times per day) observations were interrupted. In this report a short overview of the results is presented. Cetaceans were only rarely encountered during the survey. In total, ten groups or singles were observed during 91. 5 hours of counts. The sightings included two large whales (Fin Whale and Humpback Whale), three species of small whales (Killer Whale, Long- or Short-finned Pilot Whale and unidentified Beaked Whale) and two species of dolphin (Common and Bottlenose Dolphin). In total 51. 838 seabirds and 314 species were recorded of which Common/Arctic Tern, Black Tern, Wilson’s Storm-petrel and Sabine’s gull were the most abundant species. The general pattern can be characterised by a clear near shore-offshore gradient, with peak densities of most species at the drop-off of the continental shelf.

40|$|The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and {{collaborators}} {{from the}} Johns Hopkins University and the University of New Hampshire are developing for the Polar Science Community a remotely-controlled underwater robotic vehicle {{capable of being}} tele-operated under ice under remote real-time human supervision. The Nereid Under-Ice (Nereid-UI) vehicle will enable exploration and detailed examination of biological and physical environments at glacial ice-tongues and ice-shelf margins, delivering high-definition video in addition to survey data from on <b>board</b> <b>acoustic,</b> chemical, and biological sensors. Preliminary propulsion system testing indicates the vehicle {{will be able to}} attain standoff distances of up to 20 km from an ice-edge boundary, as dictated by the current maximum tether length. The goal of the Nereid-UI system is to provide scientific access to under-ice and ice-margin environments that is presently impractical or infeasible. FIBER-OPTIC TETHER: The heart of the Nereid-UI system is its expendable fiber optic telemetry system. The telemetry system utilizes many of the same components pioneered for the full-ocean depth capable HROV Nereus vehicle, with the addition of continuous fiber status monitoring, and new float-pack and depressor designs that enable single-body deployment. POWER SYSTEM: Nereid-UI is powered by a pressure-tolerant lithium-ion battery system composed of 30 Ah prismatic pouch cells, arranged on a 90 volt bus and capable of delivering 15 kW. The cells are contained in modules of 8 cells, and groups of 9 modules are housed together in oil-filled plastic boxes. The power distribution system uses pressure tolerant components extensively, each of which have been individually qualified to 10 kpsi and operation between - 20 C and 40 C. THRUSTERS: Nereid-UI will employ eight identical WHOI-designed thrusters, each with a frameless motor, oil-filled and individually compensated, and designed for low-speed (500 rpm max) direct drive. We expect an end-to-end propulsive efficiency of between 0. 3 and 0. 4 at a transit speed of 1 m/s based on testing conducted at WHOI. CAMERAS: Video imagery is one of the principal products of Nereid-UI. Two fiber-optic telemetry wavelengths deliver 1. 5 Gb/s uncompressed HDSDI video to the support vessel in real time, supporting a Kongsberg OE 14 - 522 hyperspherical pan and tilt HD camera and several utility cameras. PROJECT STATUS: The first shallow-water vehicle trials are scheduled for September 2013. The trials are designed to test core vehicle systems particularly the power system, main computer and control system, thrusters, video and telemetry system, and to refine camera, lighting and acoustic sensor placement for piloted and closed-loop control, especially as pertains to working near the underside of ice. Remaining vehicle design tasks include finalizing the single-body deployment concept and depressor, populating the scientific sensing suite, and the software development necessary to implement the planned autonomous return strategy. Final design and fabrication for these remaining components of the vehicle system will proceed through fall 2013, with trials under lake ice in early 2014, and potential polar trials beginning in 2014 - 15.
