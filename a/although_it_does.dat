5|$|Bristol notably {{does not}} award by title any bachelor's degrees in music, which is {{available}} for study but awarded B.A. (<b>although</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> award MMus and DMus), nor any degree in divinity, since divinity is not available for study (students of theology are awarded a B.A.). Similarly, the university does not award BLitt (Bachelor of Letters), <b>although</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> award both MLitt and DLitt. In regulations, the university does not name MD or DDS as higher doctorates, although they are in many universities as these degrees are normally accredited professional doctorates.|$|E

5|$|As {{discussed}} above, in the PostgreSQL {{implementation of}} SQL, Null {{is used to}} represent all UNKNOWN results, including the UNKNOWN BOOLEAN. PostgreSQL does not implement the UNKNOWN literal (<b>although</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> implement the IS UNKNOWN operator, which is an orthogonal feature.) Most other major vendors {{do not support the}} Boolean type (as defined in T031) as of 2012. The procedural part of Oracle's PL/SQL supports BOOLEAN however variables; these can also be assigned NULL and the value is considered the same as UNKNOWN.|$|E
5|$|As the RSPB's busiest reserve, Titchwell Marsh has a {{significant}} economic impact on its locality. A 2002 survey reported that an estimated 137,700 visitors spent £1.8million locally in 1998. The tiny village of Titchwell has two three-star hotels and a shop selling telescopes and binoculars, <b>although</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not have a general store or a public house.|$|E
5|$|In 1992 Hezbollah {{decided to}} {{participate}} in elections, and Ali Khamenei, supreme leader of Iran, endorsed it. Former Hezbollah secretary general, Subhi al-Tufayli, contested this decision, {{which led to a}} schism in Hezbollah. Hezbollah won all twelve seats which were on its electoral list. At the end of that year, Hezbollah began to engage in dialog with Lebanese Christians. Hezbollah regards cultural, political, and religious freedoms in Lebanon as sanctified, <b>although</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not extend these values to groups who have relations with Israel.|$|E

5|$|Little {{research}} has been done on this species, and not much is known about its ecology. The purple-throated cotinga is primarily frugivorous, <b>although</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> occasionally eat small insects. A solitary male attracts a female by perching in the canopy and letting the sunlight reflect off its iridescent feathers. It is suspected to breed year-round and is non-migratory. Despite being considered naturally uncommon or rare across its vast range, the purple-throated cotinga is listed as a species of Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|Noble gases {{have very}} low boiling and melting points, {{which makes them}} useful as {{cryogenic}} refrigerants. In particular, liquid helium, which boils at , is used for superconducting magnets, such as those needed in nuclear magnetic resonance imaging and nuclear magnetic resonance. Liquid neon, <b>although</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not reach temperatures as low as liquid helium, also finds use in cryogenics because it has over 40times more refrigerating capacity than liquid helium and over three times more than liquid hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|Several {{stars in}} Serpens {{have been found}} to have planets. The brightest, Omega Serpentis, located between Epsilon and Mu, is an orange giant with a planet of at least 1.7 Jupiter-masses. NN Serpentis, an eclipsing post-common-envelope binary {{consisting}} of a white dwarf and a red dwarf, is very likely to have two planets causing variations in the period of the eclipses. <b>Although</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not have a planet, the solar analog HD 137510 has been found to have a brown dwarf companion within the brown-dwarf desert.|$|E

5|$|The {{small village}} of Titchwell shows {{the effect that}} {{wildlife}} visitors can have locally. It adjoins the RSPB's busiest reserve, Titchwell Marsh, and a 2002 survey reported that an estimated 137,700 visitors spent £1.8million {{in the area in}} 1998.

5|$|The {{south side}} of the {{mountain}} along Suksdorf Ridge is moderately glacier-free, with the only glaciers being the relatively small Gotchen Glacier and the Crescent Glacier. The south side, however, does have some perennial snowfields on its slopes. The Crescent Glacier is the source of Morrison Creek; and, <b>although</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not feed it directly, the Gotchen Glacier is the source of Gotchen Creek. Both creeks drain to the White Salmon River.|$|E

5|$|Xenon gas can {{be safely}} kept in normal sealed glass or metal {{containers}} at standard temperature and pressure.

5|$|Caversham has no {{secondary}} schools, <b>although</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> contain {{two primary}} schools {{and a special}} needs school. Caversham Primary School, {{at the corner of}} South Road and Surrey Street, has been at its present site since 1921. The school dates back to the early 1860s, and has a current enrollment of around 80 pupils. The school's two-storey 1920s brick buildings were pulled down and replaced in 1961, because of their structural unsoundness. The school's main gate– the only surviving remnant of the earlier structure– is the suburb's war memorial.|$|E
5|$|Drosera anglica, {{commonly}} known as the English sundew or great sundew, is a carnivorous plant species belonging to the sundew family Droseraceae. It is a temperate species with a generally circumboreal range, <b>although</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> occur as far south as Japan, southern Europe, and the island of Kauai in Hawaii, where it grows as a subtropical sundew. It is thought to originate from an amphidiploid hybrid of D. rotundifolia and D. linearis, meaning that a sterile hybrid between these two species doubled its chromosomes to produce fertile progeny which stabilized into the current D. anglica.|$|E
