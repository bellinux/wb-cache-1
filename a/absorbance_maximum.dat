50|$|Reaction centers from {{different}} bacterial species may contain slightly altered bacterio-chlorophyll and bacterio-phaeophytin chromophores as functional co-factors. These alterations cause {{shifts in the}} colour of light that can be absorbed, thus creating specific niches for photosynthesis. The reaction center contains two pigments that serve to collect and transfer the energy from photon absorption: BChl and Bph. BChl roughly resembles the chlorophyll molecule found in green plants, but, due to minor structural differences, its peak absorption wavelength is shifted into the infrared, with wavelengths as long as 1000 nm. Bph has the same structure as BChl, but the central magnesium ion is replaced by two protons. This alteration causes both an <b>absorbance</b> <b>maximum</b> shift and a lowered redox-potential.|$|E

5000|$|Phytochromes are characterised by a red/far-red photochromicity. Photochromic {{pigments}} {{change their}} [...] "colour" [...] (spectral absorbance properties) upon light absorption. In {{the case of}} phytochrome the ground state is Pr, the r indicating that it absorbs red light particularly strongly. The <b>absorbance</b> <b>maximum</b> is a sharp peak 650-670 nm, so concentrated phytochrome solutions look turquoise-blue to the human eye. But once a red photon has been absorbed, the pigment undergoes a rapid conformational change to form the Pfr state. Here fr indicates that now not red but far-red (also called [...] "near infra-red"; 705-740 nm) is preferentially absorbed. This shift in absorbance is apparent to the human eye as a slightly more greenish colour. When Pfr absorbs far-red light it is converted back to Pr. Hence, red light makes Pfr, far-red light makes Pr. In plants at least Pfr is the physiologically active or [...] "signalling" [...] state.|$|E
5000|$|Water-soluble {{tetrazolium}} salts {{are more}} recent alternatives to MTT: they {{were developed by}} introducing positive or negative charges and hydroxy groups to the phenyl ring of the tetrazolium salt, or better with sulfonate groups added directly or indirectly to the phenyl ring. MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium), {{in the presence of}} phenazine methosulfate (PMS), produces a formazan product that has an <b>absorbance</b> <b>maximum</b> at 490 nm in phosphate-buffered saline. The MTS assay is often described as a 'one-step' MTT assay, which offers the convenience of adding the reagent straight to the cell culture without the intermittent steps required in the MTT assay. However this convenience makes the MTS assay susceptible to colormetric interference as the intermittent steps in the MTT assay remove traces of coloured compounds, whilst these remain in the microtitre plate in the one-step MTS assay. Precautions are needed to ensure accuracy when using this assay and there are strong arguments for confirming MTS results using qualitative observations under a microscope.
