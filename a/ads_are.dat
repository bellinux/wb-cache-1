In some cases, genetic factors explain AD risk, but {{a high percentage of}} late-onset <b>AD</b> <b>is</b> unexplained. The fact that <b>AD</b> <b>is</b> associated with a number of physical and systemic manifestations suggests that <b>AD</b> <b>is</b> a multifactorial disease that affects both the CNS and periphery. Interestingly, a common feature of many systemic processes linked to <b>AD</b> <b>is</b> involvement in energy metabolism. The goals of this review are to 1) explore the evidence that peripheral processes contribute to AD risk, 2) explore ways that AD modulates whole-body changes, and 3) discuss the role of genetics, mitochondria, and vascular mechanisms as underlying factors that could mediate both central and peripheral manifestations of AD. Despite efforts to strictly define AD as a homogeneous CNS disease, there may be no single etiologic pathway leading to the syndrome of AD dementia. Rather, the neurodegenerative process may involve some degree of baseline genetic risk that is modified by external risk factors. Continued research into the diverse but related processes linked to <b>AD</b> risk <b>is</b> necessary for successful development of disease-modifying therapies...|$|R
40|$|Alzheimer’s disease (<b>AD)</b> <b>is</b> {{the most}} common form of dementia, with a {{prevalence}} that increases with age. By 2050, the worldwide number of patients with <b>AD</b> <b>is</b> projected to reach more than 140 million. The prominent signs of <b>AD</b> <b>are</b> progressive memory loss, accompanied by a gradual decline in cognitive function and premature death. <b>AD</b> <b>is</b> the clinical manifestation of altered proteostasis. The initiating step of altered proteostasis in most <b>AD</b> patients <b>is</b> not known. The progression of <b>AD</b> <b>is</b> accelerated by several chronic disorders, among which the contribution of diabetes to <b>AD</b> <b>is</b> well understood at the cell biology level. The pathological mechanisms of AD and diabetes interact and tend to reinforce each other, thus accelerating cognitive impairment. At present, only symptomatic interventions are available for treating AD. To optimise symptomatic treatment, a personalised therapy approach has been suggested. Intranasal insulin administration seems to open the possibility for a safe, and at least in the short term, effective symptomatic intervention that delays loss of cognition in AD patients. This review summarizes the interactions of AD and diabetes from the cell biology to the patient level and the clinical results of intranasal insulin treatment of cognitive decline in AD...|$|R
