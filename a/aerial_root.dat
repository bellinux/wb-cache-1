2500|$|Estuaries are {{an example}} of a coastal sink in that they tend to trap {{sediment}} which can be due to tidal circulations and the mixing of fresh and salt water, the injection of river sediment and the presence of mangroves. As the tide rises and falls water and sediment is pumped into the estuary. Because salt water and sediment particles are heavier than fresh water they tend to be carried [...] the bottom until the sediment sinks to the floor and is trapped within the estuary. The movement of sands and offshore material into an estuary generally depends on the direction of longshore drift and the movement of bottom waters across the continental shelf. Estuaries can often trap a lot of coarse bedload sediments that are fed down rivers, intercepting them before they reach the coast. The North Island of New Zealand experiences sediment sinks into estuaries often, enhanced by the presence of mangroves. Mangroves are sediment hungry and trap a lot of suspended sediment with their complex <b>aerial</b> <b>root</b> structure, thus functioning as land builders.|$|E
25|$|<b>Aerial</b> roots: <b>roots</b> entirely {{above the}} ground, {{such as in}} ivy (Hedera) or in epiphytic orchids. Many <b>aerial</b> <b>roots,</b> are used to receive water and {{nutrient}} intake directly from the air - from fogs, dew or humidity in the air. Some rely on leaf systems to gather rain or humidity and even store it in scales or pockets. Other <b>aerial</b> <b>roots,</b> such as mangrove <b>aerial</b> <b>roots,</b> are used for aeration and not for water absorption. Other <b>aerial</b> <b>roots</b> are used mainly for structure, functioning as prop roots, as in maize or anchor roots or as the trunk in strangler fig. In some Epiphytes - plants living above the surface on other plants, <b>aerial</b> <b>roots</b> serve for reaching to water sources or reaching the surface, and then functioning as regular surface roots.|$|R
40|$|This article {{reports on}} a study to {{investigate}} the nature of <b>aerial</b> <b>roots</b> in Chinese banyan trees, Ficus microcarpa L. f. and the common belief that their presence and growth is associated with wet atmospheric conditions. First, the form and distribution of free-hanging <b>aerial</b> <b>roots</b> on eight selected Ficus microcarpa trees growing in a public space in Hong Kong, were mapped on their form and distribution. Secondly the extension of selected sample <b>aerial</b> <b>roots</b> from each tree were measured over twelve months against prevailing atmospheric humidity. Lastly, section samples of <b>aerial</b> <b>roots</b> of different ages were taken, and the anatomical structure was observed and {{compared with that of}} terrestrial water-absorbing roots to assess the mechanism by which they might take up water. The distribution and growth of <b>aerial</b> <b>roots</b> was observed to be highly variable, but there was a clear link between growth and high levels of atmospheric humidity. The anatomical structure of the <b>aerial</b> <b>roots</b> suggests that while <b>aerial</b> <b>roots</b> could absorb water under certain conditions, their growth was generated from water drawn from terrestrial roots via trunk and branches, and that the association with humid conditions was most likely to be due to the greater availability of ground water in such conditions...|$|R

50|$|The genus has a {{monopodial}} {{growth habit}} with highly variable leaves according to habitat. Some have flat, typically broad, ovoid leaves (strap-leaves), {{while others have}} cylindrical (terete), fleshy leaves and are adapted to dry periods. The stems of these orchids vary considerably in size; some are miniature plants and some have a length of several meters. The plants can become quite massive in habitat and in cultivation, and epiphytic species possess very large, rambling <b>aerial</b> <b>root</b> systems.|$|E
50|$|These plants prefer {{consistent}} conditions day-to-day in cultivation {{to avoid}} dropping their bottom leaves. The epiphytic species are best accommodated in large wooden baskets, bare rooted, {{which allows for}} the large <b>aerial</b> <b>root</b> systems. Disturbing or damaging the roots of large, mature vandaceous orchid plants, and in particular, Vanda and Aerides species, can result in the plants failing to flower and going into decline for a season or more. These plants do not tolerate disturbance or damage of their root systems in cultivation when they become mature. The terete-leaved terrestrial species are very easy to cultivate.|$|E

50|$|The banyan tree {{is located}} {{close to the}} port in the {{historical}} Lahaina town, which was the former capital of Hawaii. It is the oldest banyan tree in Hawaii. The banyan tree, received as a gift by the Smith family in the 1870s, was planted on April 24, 1873, at Lahaina by William Owen Smith, the then sheriff of Lahaina. The tree was planted to mark the 50th anniversary of {{the arrival of the}} first Protestant mission in Maui; the mission had been invited to Maui by Queen Keōpūolani, wife of late King Kamehameha. Its extensive trunk and <b>aerial</b> <b>root</b> system now covers 0.66 acre, located in the Courthouse Square, which is renamed as the Banyan Tree Park covering 1.94 acres. It is not only the largest in Hawaii but also in the United States. The park is managed by the County of Maui and the Lahaina Restoration Foundation.|$|E
50|$|If {{the fruit}} {{is more than}} 15 cm in length, it is {{categorized}} as first-quality. The largest fruits greater than 16 cm and up {{to as much as}} 21 cm are usually reserved for the gourmet vanilla market, for sale to top chefs and restaurants. If the fruits are between 10 and 15 cm long, pods are under the second-quality category, and fruits less than 10 cm in length are under the third-quality category. Each fruit contains thousands of tiny black vanilla seeds. Vanilla fruit yield depends on the care and management given to the hanging and fruiting vines. Any practice directed to stimulate <b>aerial</b> <b>root</b> production has a direct effect on vine productivity. A five-year-old vine can produce between 1.5 and 3 kg pods, and this production can increase up to 6 kg after a few years. The harvested green fruit can be commercialized as such or cured to get a better market price.|$|E

Although this species is a bivalve, only the upper valve is normally visible, and that valve is elongated or oval with a low dome, and thus the general appearance which is {{like that of a}} limpet. The umbone of the shell is off centre, near the dorsal margin of the shell. A few fine ridges radiate from the umbone and there is a sculpting of concentric growth rings. The lower valve has a hole or notch in it through which byssus threads pass which attach it to a hard surface, usually a branch, leaf or <b>aerial</b> <b>root</b> of a mangrove tree. [...] The lower valve is curved so as to adhere closely to the surface on which it rests. Unlike most other bivalves, but like others in the genus, it has a single adductor muscle holding the two valves together.|$|E

The odd forms include those forms that grew because of unusual circumstances that affected the tree, or those trees that simply have an unusual growth form not seen in most other tree species. Frank proposed a classification system for various tree forms: 1) Single Trunk Trees; 2) Multi-trunk Trees; 3) Clonal Coppices; 4) Clonal Colonies; 5) Conjoined and Hugging Trees; 6) Fallen Trees; 7) Tree complexes, and 8) Banyan-like trees; 9) Trees with Large <b>Aerial</b> <b>Root</b> Systems; and 10) Epiphytic Trees. This initial framework has continued to evolve in discussions within the NTS, but provides an initial beginning and {{suggestions on how to}} approach measuring these various tree growth forms.Since most of these trees are unique or unusual in their form and not amenable to easy measurement, the recommended approach is to write a detailed narrative description of the tree with what measurements that can be taken to amplify and better illuminate the descriptions. These trees should be documented even if the results are {{in the form of a}} written narrative rather than a collection of numerical measurements.There are some parameters that should be consistently measured whenever possible, height is one example. The cross-sectional areas occupied by the trunks and the crown are also parameters that are generally measurable. Other measurements could be taken where they seem to add to the narrative description of that particular tree. GPS locations should be taken whenever possible. Absent a GPS instrument, the locations should be pulled from Google Maps, or topographic maps. Beyond these basics, values like number of trunks larger than a prescribed value, the maximum girth of the largest trunk, and whatever seems appropriate for that particular tree grouping should be recorded. Photographs of these unusual trees are important as they can immensely improve the understanding of what is being described, and help others to visualize the tree. A process or system is needed whereby the photos of a particular tree can be associated with the description of the tree in the researcher’s notes. The goal of the narrative and measurements is to document the tree or tree grouping.An approach needs to be developed that is appropriate for each of these unusual forms. For example, clonal colonies, such as the Pando aspen, may occupy many acres. The area occupied by the colony should be measured as well as the size of the largest individual trunk present. Banyan-like trees similarly consist of multiple trunks spread across a large area. In many of these specimens the interior trunks are not easily accessible, if accessible at all. An approach to their measurement would be to measure the area occupied by the many trunks, the area occupied by the crown of the tree, the height of the tree, and any other measurements the investigator deems appropriate. These measurements would then be supplemented by a narrative description and photographs. The goal in all of these cases of trees with unusual forms is to document their characteristics.Girth can also be thought of as essentially a snapshot of the cross-section of a tree at one particular elevation. In some cases the base of the tree may be so complex that simply wrapping a tape around the base would misrepresent the true wood girth or character of the tree. An example of this would be Big Tree of Tule in Santa María del Tule, Oaxaca, Mexico described above. The Tule tree has a diameter of 38 ft as measured by tape wrap, but because of its irregularity a cross-sectional wood area expressed as a circle gave an effective diameter of only 30 ft. The base of the tree was mapped in three dimensions using a frame mapping technique. A rectangular frame was strung around the perimeter of the tree. A series of measurements from the reference lines to the edge of the trunk mapping the irregularities of the tree surface and converted to Cartesian x-y coordinates. The process was repeated at different heights to create a three-dimensional model of the tree.This mapping process can be automated. Taylor has been developing a cloud mapping process using optical parallax scanning technology whereby thousands of measurements are made around the trunk of a tree. These can be used to recreate a three-dimensional model of the trunk and girth and diameter data are among the values that can be calculated.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{surprising}} {{results in}} studies on <b>aerial</b> <b>roots</b> of Orchids {{show that the}} 'Velamen' - the white spongy envelop of the <b>aerial</b> <b>roots,</b> are actually totally water proof, preventing water loss but not allowing any water in.
