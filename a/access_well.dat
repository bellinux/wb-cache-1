40|$|The {{ability to}} control the degree of spin, or {{rotational}} velocity, for catalytic swimming devices opens up the potential to <b>access</b> <b>well</b> defined spiralling trajectories, enhance cargo binding rate, and realise theoretically proposed behaviour such as chiral diffusion. Here we assess the potential to impart a well-defined spin to individual catalytic Janus swimmers by using glancing angle metal evaporation onto a colloidal crystal to break the symmetry of the catalytic patch due to shadowing by neighbouring colloids. Using this approach we demonstrate a well-defined relationship between the glancing angle and the ratio of rotational to translational velocity. This allows batches of colloids with well-defined spin rates in the range 0. 25 to 2. 5 Hz to be produced. With reference to the shape and thickness variations across the catalytically active shapes, and their propulsion mechanism we discuss the factors {{that can lead to}} the observed variations in rotational propulsion...|$|E

As a result of the decade-long `War on Drugs ' waged by the federal government as part of a broad `law and order ' policy, the incarceration rate of African-Americans doubled in a short 10 years, 1 rising from 3544 inmates per 100, 000 adults in 1985 to 6926 per 100, 000 in 1995, which is nearly seven times the rate of their white compatriots (919 per 100, 000) and over 20 times the rates posted by France, England, or Italy. If persons sentenced to probation or released on parole are taken into account, it turns out that more than one of every three young black men (and close to two in three in the big cities of the Rust Belt) ®nd themselves under the supervision of the criminal justice system.

40|$|Higher {{education}} {{in most countries}} plays {{a pivotal role in}} the socio-economic development of citizens, hence the perception that no country can be better than the quality of its higher education system (Okwakol, 2012). It is at higher education that most governments have channelled considerable human and financial resources with a strategic view to develop human capital in the form of entrepreneurs, professionals, academics, political, religious and business leaders, who are further expected to contribute to the attainment of national goals and aspirations as embodied in Namibia’s Vision 2030 (National Planning Commission Secretariat, 2004). The National Council for Higher Education (NCHE) in Namibia was thus mandated by Parliament, Act 26 of 2003, to promote access and monitor quality assurance in higher education (NCHE, 2009). In view of emergent forces of Commodification in education, the study examined the challenges on access to higher education, the rise in tuition fees and the impact this may have on quality provision and to the economy at large. Following an interpretive paradigm, the study used semi structured questionnaires through snowballing on 25 school leavers and purposive sampling which accounted for 20 grade 12 students, 10 university lecturers, 50 university students and conducted interviews on 3 university administrators on key issues inhibiting access and impacting the quality of {{education in}} Namibia’s higher education. Using Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) the study formed themes for discussion so as to describe and capture the challenges inherent. The study concluded that while Namibia has made tremendous strides in funding education in general, the funding of higher education has gradually declined over the years thus negatively impacting access to higher Education especially for students from poor backgrounds. It was also noted that the rise in higher education enrolments may be a masking of social inequalities on <b>access</b> <b>well</b> as a threat to quality provision. <br /...|$|E

Data analysis was done by using an interactive model of Miles and Huberman. Based on {{the result showed that}} first, output of the project on the number of business groups amounted to 6 groups of 60 people (already existed before the project), 16 groups with total membership of 128 people (formed after the project). The target group did not involve the poor households as whole. Project intervention for targeted bussiness group consisted of fisherman as many as 68 people, 14 fish farmers, fish processing busness, 50 people, 17 fish traders, tourist services as much as 8 people and other types of businesses as many as 31 people. Training on these projects provided great benefits for beneficiaries in running the business Venture capital (micro credit) in the project as a whole amounted to Rp. 1. 575. 500. 000,-. Secondly, project outcomes on shredded fish business revenues was decline in recently 3 to 4 years. The decline of consumer’s demand was as one of revenues decline factor.

40|$|Fine root {{dynamics}} is a main {{driver of}} soil carbon stocks, particularly in tropical forests, yet major uncertainties still surround estimates of fine root production and turnover. This {{lack of knowledge}} {{is largely due to}} the fact that studying root dynamics in situ, particularly deep in the soil, remains highly challenging. We explored the interactions between fine root dynamics, soil depth and rainfall in mature rubber trees (Hevea brasiliensis Müll. Arg.) exposed to sub-optimal edaphic and climatic conditions. A root observation <b>access</b> <b>well</b> was installed in northern Thailand to monitor root dynamics along a 4. 5 m deep soil profile. Image-based measurements of root elongation and lifespan of individual roots were carried out at monthly intervals over 3 years. Soil depth was found to have a significant effect on root turnover. Surprisingly, root turnover increased with soil depth and root half-life was 16, 6 - 8 and only 4 months at 0. 5, 1. 0, 2. 5 and 3. 0 m deep, respectively (with the exception of roots at 4. 5 m which had a half-life similar to that found between depths of 1. 0 and 2. 5 m). Within the first two meters of the soil profile, the highest rates of root emergence occurred about three months after the onset of the rainy season, while deeper in the soil, root emergence was not linked to the rainfall pattern. Root emergence was limited during leaf flushing (between March and May), particularly within the first two meters of the profile. Between soil depths of 0. 5 and 2. 0 m, root mortality appeared independent of variations in root emergence, but below 2. 0 m, peaks in root emergence and death were synchronized. Shallow parts of the root were more responsive to rainfall than their deeper counterparts. Increased root emergence in deep soil towards the onset of the dry season could correspond to a drought acclimation mechanism, with the relative importance of deep water capture increasing once rainfall ceased. The considerable soil depth regularly explored by fine roots, even though significantly less than in surface layers in terms of root length density and biomass, will impact strongly the evaluation of soil carbon stock...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. U. R. P.) -University of Natal, Durban, 1995. One of {{the most}} {{controversial}} and dramatic features of recent city development is the phenomenon of access to land through informal means, which {{is a reflection of the}} lack of alternative delivery systems. Constraints on the supply of land for housing the urban poor have resulted in a large housing backlog, reSUlting in overcrowding, the emergence of unplanned housing such as backyard shacks and free standing informal settlements. In South Africa, the majority of the popUlation who have been historically constrained by racist and restrictive land allocation processes found it difficult to <b>access</b> <b>well</b> located and affordable serviced land. These constraints have resulted in poor people obtaining access to land through informal delivery systems. This effective exclusion of the urban poor from the formal land market has resulted in the emergence of the informal systems of land delivery, such as land invasions etc. Both internationally and in South Africa, informal settlements and squatting have represented a way of addressing and challenging market relations and state regUlation and thus, allow for poorer people to move into better located areas. The existing informal settlement within the Cato Manor area (Cato Crest) can be regarded as an example of this kind of urban process. The purpose of this dissertation is to assess the performance of the informal delivery systems in Cato Crest, to establish whether these systems have reached the urban poor and to look for ways of dealing with informal land mechanisms in the future. The findings from the survey indicated that in Cato Crest these illegal land supply systems have benefitted poor people in terms of job opportunities, proximity to the city and location. A number of recommendations can be made in this regard: that there is a need for a land policy on informal land supply systems, that which should seek to make strategically located land available for low income housing in the future. If this is not accomplished, illegal land occupation will continue unabated until no land will be available for low income housing...|$|E
40|$|Climate is an {{important}} factor of agricultural productivity and many rural dwellers in developing countries depend on agriculture and are highly affected by climate change and variability. The world is currently experiencing climatic changes and variability conditions which results in high temperatures, low rainfall patterns, shortage of water and drought persistence. Climate change and variability is affecting weather patterns and shifting seasons which results in serious repercussions on smallholder farmers. Smallholder farmers are extremely vulnerable to climate change and variability because their farming and production systems are climate sensitive and are not rebound to climate stresses. These adverse effects in developing countries arise from different climate change and variability-related causes, notable extreme weather events, food security, increased health risks in agriculture from vector home diseases, and temperature-related morbidity in environments. The study was carried in King Sabata Dalindyebo Municipality in the Eastern Cape Province in South Africa. This study examines farmers’ awareness of climate change and variability and its effects on agricultural productivity in King Sabata Dalindyebo municipality using a Descriptive Statistics, Binary and Ricardian Model fitted to data from a cross-sectional survey of 200 farmers in King Sabata Dalindyebo Municipality. Both primary and secondary data was used. This research study estimates the effects of climate change and variability on King Sabata Dalindyebo agricultural productivity using a continental dimension of Ricardian analysis. Results revealed that local farmers were aware of climate change and variability and perceived changes in average temperatures and rainfall. The changes in average temperatures and rainfall had adverse effects on crop and livestock production. However, farmers’ awareness of climate change is not to an extent that they presume adaptation to climate change as a necessity and crucial. The results show that climate change and variability affects farm income and there is a non-linear relationship existing between climatic variables (temperature and precipitation) and farm income which depicts U-shaped. The study results indicated that climate change and variability affect agricultural productivity and have an effect on agricultural productivity in King Sabata Dalindyebo Municipality. In view of the research findings, several policy proposals are suggested. The study findings suggest that climate change and variability must be taken seriously and monitored. Policy makers and government officials must support farmers with information distribution,education, market <b>access,</b> <b>well</b> trained extension agents, credit and information about mitigation strategies to climate change and variability which includes institutional and technological methods, particularly smallholder farmers.

40|$|Ethiopia is {{predominantly}} an agricultural {{country with the}} vast majority of its population directly involved in the production of crops and livestock. It contributes for about 46. 7 % of the GDP and provides employment for 85 % of the population (CSA, 2006). It also accounts for highest proportion of the export revenue and contributes significant amount in supply of raw materials requirements of the country’s industries. However, for various reasons Ethiopia’s agriculture is characterized by its subsistent nature. When the issue of economic growth and development of the country is raised, one has {{to take into account the}} performance of the smallholder farmers. Reducing the challenges they are facing and utilizing their potentials can help to accelerate the agricultural sector and economic development of the country as a whole. Agricultural cooperatives are an ideal means for self-reliance, higher productivity level and promotion of agricultural development. In Ethiopia many cooperative unions are being established to strengthen the existing primary level cooperatives by pooling their scarce resources and increasing their bargaining power. However, the union’s management lacks the required knowledge and training in managing their resources. Therefore, skill development training is also required in resource management, use of funds and conditions which will enable those unions to stand by themselves as competent entities. The development of an efficient and equitable grain marketing system is a critical component for improving food security in Ethiopia, increasing both food availability and food <b>access.</b> <b>Well</b> functioning grain markets benefit both producers and consumers by reducing marketing margins and the transaction costs. This research is conducted to assess grain marketing performance through Assosa woreda primary multi-purpose cooperative societies. Assosa woreda is selected for the study due to its greatest potential among other woredas of the region. Data were collected from two sources known as primary sources and secondary sources. Primary data were gathered through interviews using structured interview schedules and check lists. Secondary data were gathered to support the information collected from primary sources. These were from reports and records of the cooperative societies, regional and woreda agriculture and rural development bureaus, regional finance and economic development bureau, the statistics authority regional office etc. Tools used for collection of primary data were structured interview schedules. In addition, group discussions were conducted with the key communicators of the woreda. JMP 5 software was employed for analysis of primary data collected through interview schedules. According to the multivariate correlation test, education level and access to market information are positively correlated indicating that the higher the education level, the better would be the knowledge of the farmer to acquire news and education about the benefits of the cooperatives. This education level is also found to have a positive relationship with the farmer’s level of participation in his/her society. Multivariate Correlation test of farm size and marketed surplus has shown also a positive relationship. The positive relationship can indicate that an increase in one of the two could be an evidence for increase in the other. Size of family is found to have negative influence on marketed surplus. Through simple linear regression, it is found that an increase in family member by 1 brings a decrease in marketed surplus by 2. 11 quintals. Availability of market infrastructures, access to inputs and access to credit services are analyzed using rating scales and checklists. Grain varieties marketed through the cooperatives were Maize, Sorghum and Niger seed. The past three successive years’ sales data was taken from the sample societies’ records and analyzed to assess the year-to-year increase/decrease in annual gross sales and gross profit. Constraints of grain marketing performance were found to have two aspects. These are production constraints and marketing constraints. Under production constraints are farmland scarcity, soil degradation, weed and pests, lack of input supply, poor extension services and weather shocks etc. Marketing constraints include lack of capital, lack of timely and accurate market information, lack of storage facilities, poor roads & high transport costs, poor marketing management and lack of trainings on marketing and related business issues...|$|E
