Ibrahim's army was led by a Laconian from Bardounia named Bosinas who had assistance from the Egyptian fleet. On August 27, he reached Kariopoli {{in an attempt to}} take a safe path through the mountains. Before he reached the town of Polytsaravos, his army of 8,000 Egyptians was delayed by Theodoros Stathakos and his family of thirteen men who refused to let the invaders past their tower. Bosinas tried to negotiate with Stathakos. Stathakos, feigning surrender, told Bosinas to come <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>his</b> family's guns. As Bosinas came to retrieve the guns, the Stathakos family killed him. In retaliation, the Egyptians used their two cannons and blew up the tower.|$|E
5|$|Arrington {{completed}} much of {{the research}} for Great Basin Kingdom in the LDS Church library archives. Aware of the LDS Church Archives's hostility to academic research at the time, Arrington took John A. Widtsoe's advice and started his research with published materials and theses, working up to unpublished materials. Arrington was able to circumvent A. William Lund's policy of personally approving all notes taken in the archives: Arrington took his notes on a typewriter using carbon copy paper, enabling him to leave a copy with Lund <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>his</b> own copy home. In order to rewrite his dissertation into Great Basin Kingdom, Arrington took a sabbatical 1956–1957 and was granted a fellowship at the Huntington Library in San Marino, California.|$|E
5|$|In 1983's Return of the Jedi, the Emperor {{appears in}} person {{to oversee the}} last stages of the second Death Star's construction. He assures Darth Vader that they will {{together}} turn Luke, now revealed to be Vader's son, to the dark side. Unknown to Vader, the Emperor plans to replace his apprentice with Luke. When Vader brings Luke before his master, the Emperor tempts Luke to join the dark side by appealing to the young Jedi's fear for his friends, whom he has lured into a trap. This leads to a lightsaber duel in which Luke defeats and nearly kills Vader. The Emperor tells Luke to kill Vader <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>his</b> place, but Luke refuses and declares himself a Jedi. Enraged, the Emperor attacks Luke with Force lightning. Moved by his son's cries for help, Vader throws the Emperor into the Death Star's reactor shaft, killing him.|$|E

5|$|In {{the next}} match against Leicestershire, Loxton was given his first chance on English soil. Batting at No. 7, he managed only four before being trapped leg before wicket by Australian {{expatriate}} left arm orthodox spinner Vic Jackson, as Australia amassed 448. He {{then opened the}} bowling and castled home captain Les Berry for one to leave the hosts at 1/1 <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>his</b> first wicket on English soil. He also took two catches, both from the bowling of fellow Victorian Doug Ring as the hosts fell for 130. Loxton again opened the bowling in the second innings as Australia enforced the follow on and dismissed the hosts for 147 to seal another innings win. Loxton took 1/11 and 0/12 from six and seven overs respectively.|$|E
5|$|With great celebration {{among the}} gods, Horus takes the throne, and Egypt at last has a {{rightful}} king. The divine decision that Set {{is in the}} wrong corrects the injustice created by Osiris's murder and completes the process of his restoration after death. Sometimes Set is made to carry Osiris's body to its tomb {{as part of his}} punishment. The new king performs funerary rites for his father and gives food offerings to sustain him—often including the Eye of Horus, which in this instance represents life and plenty. According to some sources, only through these acts can Osiris be fully enlivened in the afterlife <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>his</b> place as king of the dead, paralleling his son's role as king of the living. Thereafter, Osiris is deeply involved with natural cycles of death and renewal, such as the annual growth of crops, that parallel his own resurrection.|$|E
5|$|The Simpsons uses a {{floating}} timeline {{in which the}} characters do not physically age, and as such the show {{is assumed to be}} set in the current year. In several episodes, events have been linked to specific times, though sometimes this timeline has been contradicted in subsequent episodes. Maggie is the youngest child of Marge and Homer, and sister to Bart and Lisa. When Marge became pregnant with Bart, she and Homer got married at a chapel in Las Vegas. To support his impending family, Homer all but demanded a job at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, impressing its owner, Mr. Burns, with his aggressive submissiveness. When Marge became pregnant with Lisa, two years later, she and Homer bought their first house. Another six years later, Homer felt financially secure enough to finally quit his job at the Power Plant <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>his</b> dream job at Barney's Bowlarama. However, Marge became pregnant with Maggie, so Homer, once again unable to support his family, was forced to reapply for his old job. By the time Maggie was born, Homer had shown great signs of distress, but he managed to find motivation in the form of his newborn baby girl.|$|E

5|$|Years go by as Scar squanders the kingdom's {{resources}} and allows his army of hyenas to wreak havoc upon the Pride Lands, which turn barren. Meanwhile, an alive and adult Simba is visited by Mufasa's ghost, who encourages {{him to return}} to the Pride Lands <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>his</b> rightful place as king. Aided by his friends Nala, Timon and Pumbaa, Simba arrives at Pride Rock and witnesses Scar striking his mother Sarabi and confronts Scar, who demands that Simba admit to the pride that he killed Mufasa. As he prepares to throw Simba off Pride Rock and have him meet a similar fate to that of his father, Scar whispers that {{he was the one who}} killed Mufasa. Enraged, Simba tackles Scar and forces his uncle to admit the truth to the pride, initiating a ferocious battle between the pride, Timon, Pumbaa, Zazu, Rafiki and Scar's hyenas. Scar tries to escape, but is cornered by Simba on the top of Pride Rock; Scar begs for mercy and even attempts to blame his crimes on the hyenas, unaware that they are listening nearby. Simba ignores Scar and gives him one last chance to run away and never return. When Simba's back is turned, Scar attacks him and they fight. Simba bests Scar in combat and throws him over the cliff edge and into a pit. Scar survives the fall, but is attacked and killed by the vengeful hyenas.|$|E
25|$|In {{another version}} of the story, Pallas was a Gigante; Athena slew him during the Gigantomachy and flayed off his skin to make her cloak, which she wore as a victory trophy. In an {{alternate}} variation of the same myth, Pallas was instead Athena's father, who attempted to assault his own daughter, causing Athena to kill him <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>his</b> skin as a trophy.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally, {{the only}} {{way in which a}} bastard child of a Portuguese monarch could have been made {{legitimate}} <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>his</b> or her place in the line of succession was if his or her parents subsequently were married. At the time of Maria Pia's birth, Carlos was married to Queen Amelie and had two sons with her. Children born of adultery were specifically excluded from the line of succession.|$|E

25|$|The opening quatrain {{begins with}} the {{personification}} of time, a destroyer of great things built by man, a force man cannot equal.

The concluding couplet, in contrast to Shakespeare's typical practice, provides no solution, no clever twist; only inevitable tears.|$|E
