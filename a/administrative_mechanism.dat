25|$|At {{the time}} there were {{diplomatic}} contacts with the Ottoman Empire to initiate reforms in Macedonia and in Thrace, {{which at the time}} were {{under the control of the}} Ottoman Empire, for improving the living conditions of the Christian populations. Failure of such reforms would leave as a single option to remove Turkey from the Balkans, an idea that most Balkan countries shared. This scenario appeared realistic to Venizelos, because Turkey was under a constitutional transition and its <b>administrative</b> <b>mechanism</b> was disorganized and weakened. There was also no fleet capable of transporting forces from Asia Minor to Europe, while in contrast the Greek fleet was dominating the Aegean Sea. Venizelos did not want to initiate any immediate major movements in the Balkans, until the Greek army and navy were reorganized (an effort that had begun from the last government of Georgios Theotokis) and the Greek economy was revitalized. In light of this, Venizelos proposed to Turkey to recognize the Cretans the right to send deputies to the Greek Parliament, as a solution for closing the Cretan Question. However, the Young Turks (feeling confident after the Greco-Turkish war in 1897) threatened that they would make a military walk to Athens, if the Greeks insisted on such claims.|$|E

In particular, several recent studies have drawn attention to <b>administrative</b> <b>mechanisms</b> including leadership support to examine how OCBs are managed. The general premise is that explicit <b>administrative</b> <b>mechanisms</b> can be deployed by an organisation to influence employees’ OCBs. Previous {{research has shown that}} OCBs can be influenced by different mechanisms and employee responses. However, the tendency has been to examine OCBs as a unidimensional construct and to examine employee responses in isolation. The authors develop hypotheses about interdependences between <b>administrative</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> employee responses and OCBs. They also examine the effects of <b>administrative</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and employees responses on separate dimensions of OCBs. The results generally support the premise that OCBs can be influenced by selectively deploying <b>administrative</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> However, the effect of <b>administrative</b> <b>mechanisms</b> on OCBs is mediated by employee responses including oganisational commitment.

500|$|Baxter's biggest {{clashes with}} {{academic}} staff were over governance issues. He had {{a preference for}} industry-style organisation, with clear lines of authority. In 1957, he created a committee of deans, chaired by himself, that met every Wednesday. This became the vice-chancellor's advisory committee in 1960. Through this he created an <b>administrative</b> <b>mechanism</b> which set the university free from the traditional constraints. He did away {{with the election of}} deans by the faculty, replacing it with one in which deans were appointed by the University Council on his recommendation. This provided for more efficient administration, but violated the academic tradition of a dean being primus inter pares among academic colleagues. This aroused the ire of academic staff, and in the end a compromise was reached whereby each faculty elected a chairman who was responsible for academic matters, while the council appointed a dean {{who was in charge of}} administrative matters. This proved to be quite successful, and was retained by Baxter's successors. Ronald Hartwell characterised Baxter's administration as [...] "unusual, undemocratic and unacademic".

The censuses that came later were much broader and, according to Crispin Bates, [...] "more sophisticated" [...] attempts at social engineering. Denzil Ibbetson, the Deputy Superintendent of the census in Punjab Province in 1881, said in his official report that [...] Our ignorance of the customs and beliefs of the people among whom we dwell is surely in some respects a reproach to us; for not only does that ignorance deprive European science of material which it greatly needs, but it also involves a distinct loss of administrative power to ourselves. [...] Administrative needs were indeed a necessity and the imperative increased with a recognition that the 1857 Rebellion had been a significant challenge to Britain's presence in India. It was the shock of that which caused the end of the Company Rule and it also caused influential members of the Indian Civil Service, such as the folklorist Richard Carnac Temple, to think that, if further discontent were to be avoided, it was necessary to obtain {{a better understanding of the}} colonial subjects.
