5|$|When {{the chicks}} hatch, they {{are covered with}} gray down. This down is {{eventually}} cleared in about 40 to 50 days. The young chicks lack tail streamers. The juvenile looks similar to the adult with a mostly white crown. In the juvenile, the stripes above the eye usually are connected <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>nape.</b> The tail feathers usually have black tips or subterminal dots and without the tail streamers that are distinctive on the adult. Occasionally, a juvenile will have black markings on its flanks and undertail coverts.|$|E
5|$|The Cuban macaw had a red {{forehead}} fading {{to orange}} {{and then to}} yellow <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>nape</b> of the neck. It had white unfeathered areas around the eyes, and yellow irises. The face, chin, chest, abdomen and thighs were orange. The legs were brown. The upper back was brownish red with feathers scalloped with green. The rump, undertail feathers, and lower back were blue. The wing feathers were brown, red and purplish blue. The upper surface of the tail was dark red fading to blue at the tip, and the under surface of the tail was brownish red. The beak has variously been described as dark, all-black, and greyish black. The sexes were identical in external appearance, as with other macaws.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>nape</b> is <b>the</b> {{back of the}} neck. In {{technical}} anatomical/medical terminology, <b>the</b> <b>nape</b> {{is referred}} to by the word nucha, which also gives the adjective corresponding to [...] "nape" [...] in English, [...] "nuchal". An English and French word for <b>the</b> <b>nape</b> of <b>the</b> neck is [...] "nuque".|$|R
5|$|There is {{very little}} {{geographic}} variation in size. The main differences are {{the presence or absence}} of a whitish partial collar <b>at</b> <b>the</b> base of <b>the</b> <b>nape,</b> <b>the</b> variations in the shade of <b>the</b> <b>nape</b> and <b>the</b> tone of the underparts. Populations in central Asia have slightly larger wings and western populations have a slightly heavier bill. Body colour becomes darker further north, in mountain regions and humid climates, and paler elsewhere. However, individual variation, particularly in juveniles and also during the months before moulting, can often be greater than geographic differences.|$|R
25|$|Wigs {{were worn}} for formal occasions, or the hair was worn long and powdered, brushed {{back from the}} {{forehead}} and clubbed (tied back <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>nape</b> of the neck) with a black ribbon.

500|$|The Titans are giant {{humanoid}} figures ranging between [...] {{tall and}} are usually masculine in body structure but lack reproductive organs. Although they {{do not appear to}} need food, they instinctively attack and eat humans on sight; it is mentioned that they derive their energy from sunlight. Furthermore, the Titans also do not have a proper digestive tract; once they have eaten their fill of human prey, Titans will vomit large, slimy balls, derisively referred to as [...] "hairballs". Finally, their skin is tough and difficult to penetrate, and they regenerate quickly from injuries, save for a weak spot <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>nape</b> of their neck.|$|E
2500|$|In warmer climates {{including}} Italy and Spain, {{hair was}} more often worn uncovered, braided or twisted with ribbons and pinned up, or confined in a net. [...] A Spanish {{style of the}} later 15th century was still worn in this period: the hair was puffed over the ears before being drawn back at chin level into a braid or wrapped twist <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>nape.</b>|$|E
50|$|The dove has a blue-grey {{breast with}} {{chequered}} brown-bronze wings. <b>The</b> <b>nape</b> {{is similar to}} that of the peaceful dove in that <b>the</b> <b>nape</b> feathers are striated but differs in that the bar-shouldered dove does not have striated throat feathers like the peaceful dove. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>nape</b> feathers are copper in colour. These doves are also often confused with the introduced and common spotted turtle dove. The eye ring tends to be grey but red-brown when breeding. The juveniles are duller in colour.|$|R

[...] Later, wigs or the natural hair were worn long, brushed back from the forehead and clubbed or tied back <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>nape</b> of the neck with a black ribbon. From about 1720, a bag wig gathered the back hair in a black silk bag. Black ribbons attached to the bag {{were brought to the}} front and tied in a bow in a style called a [...] "solitaire".|$|E
2500|$|AAVE {{also has}} words that either {{are not part}} of most other American English dialects or have strikingly {{different}} meanings. For example, there are several words in AAVE referring to white people that {{are not part of}} mainstream American English; these include gray as an adjective for whites (as in gray dude), possibly from the color of Confederate uniforms; and paddy, an extension of the slang use for [...] "Irish". [...] "," [...] which is pejorative, is another general term for a white person; it might derive from the Ibibio word afia, which means [...] "light-colored", from the Yoruba word ofe, spoken in hopes of disappearing from danger, or via Pig Latin from [...] "foe". However, most dictionaries simply say its etymology is unknown. Kitchen refers to the particularly curly or kinky hair <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>nape</b> of the neck, and siditty or seddity means [...] "snobbish" [...] or [...] "bourgeois".|$|E

2500|$|According to {{witnesses}} {{it started}} on 17 August 1922 when Krishnamurti complained of {{a sharp pain}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>nape</b> of his neck. Over {{the next two days}} the symptoms worsened, with increasing pain and sensitivity, loss of appetite, and occasional delirious ramblings. He seemed to lapse into unconsciousness, but later recounted that he was very much aware of his surroundings, and that while in that state he had an experience of [...] "mystical union". The following day the symptoms and the experience intensified, climaxing with a sense of [...] "immense peace". Following - and apparently related to - these events [...] the condition that {{came to be known as}} the process started to affect him, in September and October that year, as a regular, almost nightly occurrence. Later the process resumed intermittently, with varying degrees of pain, physical discomfort and sensitivity, occasionally a lapse into a childlike state, and sometimes an apparent fading out of consciousness, explained as either his body giving in to pain or his mind [...] "going off".|$|E
2500|$|Also {{known as}} matianak or kuntilanak, {{it is the}} ghost of a {{stillborn}} female. To prevent this, as with its mother the lang suir, a needle is placed in each of the corpse's hands and a hen's egg under each armpit. Depicted as an ugly woman wiith sharp nails and a white dress, the pontianak can also {{take the form of a}} beautiful young woman or a night-bird. When she is close, she gives off a strong smell of frangipani. It is usually encountered by the roadside or under a tree, and attack men and drink their blood. The Indonesian kuntilanak, however, typically uses its bird form to attack virgin women. The bird, which makes a [...] "ke-ke-ke" [...] sound as it flies, may be sent through black magic to make a woman sick, the characteristic symptom being vaginal bleeding. A pontianak can be made into a good wife, by placing a nail into the hole <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>nape</b> of its neck (called Sundel Bolong). Modern popular culture often confuses the pontianak with its mother the lang suir. However, traditional myth is clear that the pontianak is {{the ghost of a}} dead baby and not a pregnant woman. A similar ghost called tiyanak exists in Philippine lore.|$|E

40|$|The National Association of Physicians for <b>the</b> Environment (<b>NAPE)</b> {{has assumed}} a {{leadership}} role in protecting environmental health in recent years. The Committee of Biomedical Research Leaders was convened <b>at</b> <b>the</b> recent <b>NAPE</b> Leadership Conference: Biomedical Research and the Environment held on 1 [...] 2 November 1999, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland. This report summarizes the discussion of the committee and its recommendations. The charge to the committee was to raise and address issues that will promote and sustain environmental health, safety, and energy efficiency within the biomedical community. Leaders from every important research sector (industry laboratories, academic health centers and institutes, hospitals and care facilities, Federal laboratories, and community-based research facilities) were gathered in this committee to discuss issues relevant to promoting environmental health. The conference and this report focus on the themes of environmental stewardship, sustainable development and "best greening practices. " Environmental stewardship, an emerging theme within and outside the biomedical community, symbolizes the effort to provide an integrated, synthesized, and concerted effort to protect the health of the environment in both the present and the future. The primary goal established by the committee is to promote environmentally responsible leadership in the biomedical research community. Key outcomes of the committee's discussion and deliberation were a) the need for a central organization to evaluate, promote, and oversee efforts in environmental stewardship; and b) immediate need to facilitate efficient information transfer relevant to protecting the global environment through a database/clearinghouse. Means to fulfill these needs are discussed in this report...|$|R
