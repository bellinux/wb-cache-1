5|$|In the 2010s, Russia's economy {{suffered}} from a financial crisis, depressed oil prices, and international sanctions put into place during the Ukrainian crisis. With less disposable income to spend, citizens were forced to take drastic measures.

5|$|Though {{the exact}} extent of losses was unclear, the {{earthquake}} caused further damage to many structures in Christchurch; <b>approximately</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{buildings in the}} centre of the city were already damaged or destroyed by previous strong earthquakes. Preliminary assessments indicate over 100 additional buildings were rendered beyond repair in the area. Despite its moderate magnitude, the preceding magnitude 5.6 ML tremor caused several two-story buildings at a road intersection in the city to collapse. Multiple hospitals and residential care facilities in Christchurch were left without essential services, and some reported considerable damage to infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|Although once {{dominated}} by large public and multilateral underwriters, private insurance firms accounted for <b>approximately</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> political risk insurance market in 2007. As a result, MIGA has paid {{closer attention to}} exceptionally risky countries that have little appeal to foreign investors, and has insured projects among nations in the global south. MIGA conducted a survey in 2010 which showed that political risk {{is the most important}} deterrent of long-term foreign direct investment in developing countries, even more than economic uncertainty and poor public infrastructure. MIGA's Council of Governors amended the agency's convention in 2010 in an attempt to improve the organization's effectiveness by expanding the range of investments eligible for political risk insurance.|$|E

5|$|Enthusiasts {{worked to}} reorient the breed towards driving and {{recreation}} pursuits, and since 1982 have again reorganized the breed association. In 1992, a new studbook {{was created for}} the breed, with new selection criteria designed to preserve {{the quality of the}} breed, particularly its gaits. The latest editions of the breed registry and studbook are controlled by the Syndicat national des éleveurs et utilisateurs de chevaux Cob normand (SNEUCCN, National Union of Farmers and Users of Normandy Cob Horses), based in Tessy-sur-Vire. The association works to preserve and promote the breed throughout France, focusing especially on Normandy, Vendee and Anjou. In 1994, Normandy contained 2000 Percheron and Norman Cob horses, and annually bred around 600 foals of these two breeds. This included <b>approximately</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Norman Cobs bred in France.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, the 25 {{personnel}} of the Comité {{joined the}} CIA officers in sorting and processing the seized documents. The CIA officers had a separate side {{entrance to the}} building in which the operations took place, {{in order to maintain}} the image that the operation was a Guatemalan internal affair. The task of sorting through the papers proved to be daunting: by September, the main index of the material contained 15,800 cards. All hand-written material was preserved, and multiple copies of printed material were kept. Every document had to be reproduced, because the original copies of every document was to remain in Guatemala. <b>Approximately</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> paper that had been gathered was incinerated. The CIA gave the highest priority to the documents seized from the PGT.|$|E
5|$|In 1774, the {{government}} of Prince Edward Island passed the Quit Rent Act 1774 to force the proprietors to pay their dues to maintain civil infrastructure on the island. However, many proprietors continued to simply not pay their quitrent. In 1781, {{the government}}, led by Governor Walter Patterson, compulsorily acquired <b>approximately</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> island using {{a process known as}} escheat. That same year, the government held a public auction to sell off the land that had been compulsorily acquired. However, following a concerted effort by the proprietors to get the Colonial Office to reverse the action, the Crown overturned the sales conducted at the auction in 1783. The proprietors requested that Governor Patterson be removed from his office, and the Colonial Office did so in 1786.|$|E

5|$|In October 2007, Time Magazine ran {{an article}} condemning the V-22 as unsafe, overpriced, and {{completely}} inadequate; the Marine Corps responded {{by arguing that}} parts of the article's data were dated, obsolete, inaccurate, and reflected expectations too high for any new field of aircraft. In 2011, it was reported by the controversial defense industry supported Lexington Institute that the average V-22 mishap rate per flight hour over the past 10 years was <b>approximately</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> average accident rate for the USMC fleet; the V-22's accident rate was the lowest of any Marine rotorcraft. In 2011 Wired Magazine reported that the safety record was achieved by excluding ground incidents; the USMC responded that MV-22 reporting was to the same standards as other aircraft in the Department of the Navy.|$|E
5|$|The A5 is a tolled {{motorway}} {{based on}} the vehicle classification in Croatia using a closed toll system. Toll charged along the A5 route between Osijek and the Sredanci interchange depends on the route traveled and ranges from 4.00 kuna (0.54 euro) to 30.00 kuna (4.05 euro) for passenger cars and 13.00 kuna (1.76 euro) to 98.00 kuna (13.24 euro) for semi-trailer trucks. Motorcycles are charged <b>approximately</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> passenger car rate. The toll is payable in either Croatian kuna or euros using major credit cards, debit cards {{and a number of}} prepaid toll collection systems. The latter include smart cards issued by the motorway operator and ENC, an electronic toll collection system which is used by motorways across Croatia, with discounted rates for dedicated lanes at toll plazas. Toll collection systems along the A5 and A3 are unified; vehicles switching from one motorway to the other at Sredanci, for example, do not pass toll plazas at the interchange.|$|E
5|$|The soundtrack in MediEvil: Resurrection is orchestrated, {{unlike the}} first instalment. <b>Approximately</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> themes from the {{original}} were removed while new themes were created to fit with the new levels. The music is split into two halves; the cues from the first half are largely reminiscent of a select number of cues {{from the original}} game {{with the addition of}} extra thematic elements to strengthen them. The other half of the music is original and composed exclusively for Resurrection. The new soundtrack was composed by Bob & Barn and features performances from members of the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra that was recorded in the Czech Republic. The orchestra, headed by Nic Raine, consisted of approximately 80 performers and in addition benefits from a 32 piece choir, also recorded in the same venue. This was in similar vain to SCE Cambridge Studio's previous orchestral game Primal, which was also recorded in Prague by the same performers.|$|E

5|$|At around 10:00, after battle {{had been}} joined {{all along the}} front, Russian General Pyotr Bagration, who had won the cavalry action {{a few days earlier}} at Wissau, pulled his forces back from the {{advancing}} enemy infantry from the V Corps. Meanwhile, the Austrian Prince Johann I Joseph, Prince of Liechtenstein threw his 4,000-sabre Austro-Russian cavalry reserve into combat against Murat's 6,000 sabres. The Austro-Russians did not provide infantry or artillery support to the cavalry attack, while Murat's cavalrymen were able to cooperate with Lannes's infantry and artillery. Taking immense casualties after a first series of actions against Lannes's infantry, elements of the Coalition cavalry withdrew and were reformed by their commanders. Joined by Bagration's own cavalry, they set off again, this time aiming directly at Murat's command centre. As the Austro-Russian cavalry was closing in on its target, they were steadily met by four of Nansouty's regiments (the two Carabiniers regiments and the 2nd and 3rd Cuirassiers). The sounds of the two massed cavalries colliding could be heard some distance away. After a brief combat, the Austro-Russian horsemen broke and were driven off. However, Liechtenstein soon reformed his men and, seeing that all the French cavalry was positioned on the left of Caffarelli's infantry division, he launched his men against the right wing of this division, but was instantly met with sustained musket volleys that disorganised his cavalrymen. Seeing this development, Nansouty wheeled right with his men and crossed the infantry intervals by platoons, and then formed his men on two battle lines in front of the infantry. Three charges ensued in brief succession, with Nansouty skilfully committing the 1st and 2nd Carabiniers-à-Cheval and the 2nd Cuirassiers from his first line, then the 9th Cuirassiers and Saint-Germain's brigade from his second line. The Austro-Russian cavalry was finally broken and repulsed for good. After another series of well-coordinated cavalry and infantry actions, Murat and Lannes were able to force Bagration's entire force to withdraw, with a loss 2,000 men (<b>approximately</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> force) and 16 guns.|$|E
