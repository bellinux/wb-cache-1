50|$|The pressure, {{temperature}} and acceleration sensors generate analog signals which are converted to their digital equivalents using analog to digital converters. The <b>acceleration</b> <b>sensor</b> measures the centrifugal force generated when the wheel rotates. This force {{is proportional to}} the rotational speed. The <b>acceleration</b> <b>sensor</b> may be a simple switch rather than an analog transducer (accelerometer). This is usually referred to as a roll switch. The <b>acceleration</b> <b>sensor</b> allows the TPM to be placed in a low-power communication device mode, when the vehicle is stationary which can extend the battery life. The advantage of a roll switch over an accelerometer is that the switch is purely mechanical and doesn't use any power to take a measurement.|$|E

In this work a sensor system has been developed that meets the special requirements of heavyload manipulation systems. The geometrical structure of the sensor has been adapted to the acceleration range of large manipulators. In addition, a new almost exclusively digital readout circuit has been developed. This special circuit allows the measurement of high precision accelerations during regular operation, but can also detect very high accelerations (shock), e. g. those generated by the collision of the manipulator with another object.

5000|$|In {{co-operation}} {{with the}} University of Bremen and the German Aerospace Center (DLR), the machtWissen.de Corporation from Bremen, Germany developed the weightlessness demonstrator [...] "Gravity Jumper" [...] {{based on a}} trampoline. Due to the acceleration during the jump, an acceleration force takes effect {{in addition to the}} usual gravitational force. Both forces add up and the person on the trampoline seems to become heavier. As soon as the jumper leaves the trampoline, he is under a free fall condition, which means that the jumper seems weightless and does not feel the acceleration due to gravity.Every person receives a three-axis <b>acceleration</b> <b>sensor,</b> fastened to them with a belt. The sensor transmits the data of the flight path to a monitor; a monitor shows the course of the acceleration, including the weightless phase.

50|$|In the ABC system, a {{computer}} detects body movement from sensors located throughout the vehicle, and controls {{the action of}} the active suspension with the use of hydraulic servomechanisms. The hydraulic pressure to the servos is supplied by a high pressure radial piston hydraulic pump. A total of 13 sensors continually monitor body movement and vehicle level and supply the ABC controller with new data every ten milliseconds. Four level sensors, one at each wheel measure the ride level of the vehicle, three accelerometers measure the vertical body acceleration, one <b>acceleration</b> <b>sensor</b> measures the longitudinal and one sensor the transverse body acceleration. At each hydraulic cylinder, a pressure sensor monitors the hydraulic pressure. As the ABC controller receives and processes data, it operates four hydraulic servos, each mounted in series on a spring strut, beside each wheel. Almost instantaneously, the servo regulated suspension generates counter forces to body lean, dive and squat during various driving maneuvers. A suspension strut, consisting of a steel coil spring and a shock absorber are connected in parallel, as well as a hydraulically controlled adjusting cylinder, are located between the vehicle body and wheel. These components adjust the cylinder {{in the direction of the}} suspension strut, and change the suspension length. This creates a force which acts on the suspension and dampening of the vehicle in the frequency range up to five hertz.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Early {{detection}} of respiratory overload {{is crucial to}} mechanically ventilated patients, especially during phases of spontaneous breathing. Although a diversity of methods and indices has been established, there is no highly specific approach to predict respiratory failure. This study aimed to evaluate <b>acceleration</b> <b>sensors</b> in abdominal and thoracic wall positions to detect alterations in breathing excursions in a setting of gradual increasing airway resistance. Methods Twenty-nine healthy volunteers were committed to a standardized protocol of a two-minutes step-down spontaneous breathing on a 5  mm, 4  mm and then 3  mm orally placed endotracheal tube. Accelerator sensors in thoracic and abdominal wall position monitored breathing excursions. 15 participants passed the breathing protocol (“completed” group), 14 individuals cancelled the protocol due to subjective intolerance to the increasing airway resistance (“abandoned” group). Results Gradual increased respiratory workload led to a significant decrease of acceleration in abdominal wall position in the “abandoned” group compared to the “completed” group (p[*]<[*] 0. 001), while these gradual accelerating changes were not observed in thoracic wall position (p[*]=[*] 0. 484). Thoracic <b>acceleration</b> <b>sensors</b> did not detect any time- and group-specific changes (p[*]=[*] 0. 746).
