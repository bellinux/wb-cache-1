30|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{age of the}} {{household}} head shows negative correlation with soil <b>and</b> water <b>conservation</b> <b>and</b> seasonal migration at p <  1 and p <  10  % which means that a one unit increase {{in the age of}} the household decreases the probability of using soil <b>and</b> water <b>conservation</b> <b>and</b> seasonal migration by 0.7 and 0.8 times greater relative to the base category. This implies that older farmers’ are less likely to take soil <b>and</b> water <b>conservation</b> <b>and</b> seasonal migration which require more labor. The probability of adapting soil <b>and</b> water <b>conservation</b> <b>and</b> seasonal migration decreases the older a farmer is. Thus, younger households’ are active and energized than older households’ in the application of soil <b>and</b> water <b>conservation</b> <b>and</b> seasonal migration as a strategy. This finding is in agreement with Madison (2006) who noted that older households’ are less likely to use the two adaptation measures compared with younger ones.|$|R

40|$|Soil erosion {{is one of}} the {{important}} causes of land degradation. Many soil <b>and</b> water <b>conservation</b> practices have been implemented in order to decrease soil erosion and prevent land degradation for a long period in Yanhe River Basin which is characteristic of serious soil erosion for concentrated rainfall, erodible soil and hilly and gully terrain. Soil <b>and</b> water <b>conservation</b> practices cannot only reduce soil and water loss but also change the situation of the land surface and influence the structure and functions of the eco-system. This study tried to quantitatively assess influence on ecosystem service caused by soil <b>and</b> water <b>conservation</b> with the index of ecosystem service value. Ecosystem service value was calculated using the data of precipitation, soil, terrain and soil <b>and</b> water <b>conservation</b> practice with the guidance of the theory of soil <b>and</b> water <b>conservation</b> science <b>and</b> science of ecological economics based on GIS. For the study area the ecological service value of eco-system was 13. 693 billion and 24. 464 billion RMB, respectively, in 1997 and 2006 in the initial state of soil <b>and</b> water <b>conservation</b> <b>and</b> 14. 264 and 25. 620 billion RMB in the end state. The ecosystem service value could increase by 0. 571 and 1. 156 billion RMB caused by the accumulated soil <b>and</b> water <b>conservation</b> practices in 1997 and 2006 and soil <b>and</b> water <b>conservation</b> improved the quality of environment...|$|R
