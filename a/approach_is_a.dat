The rationale for this <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> presumed synergy between vancomycin, which causes {{the death of the}} bacteria by breakdown of the cell wall, and clindamycin, which is a powerful inhibitor of toxin synthesis. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have shown clindamycin reduces the production of exotoxins by staphylococci; it may also induce changes in the surface structure of bacteria that make them more sensitive to immune system attack (opsonization and phagocytosis).|$|E

This <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> problem even in Windows-only systems: there is no support for per-user timezone settings, only a single system-wide setting. In 2008 Microsoft hinted that future versions of Windows will partially support a Windows registry entry RealTimeIsUniversal that had been introduced many years earlier, when Windows NT supported RISC machines with UTC clocks, but had not been maintained.

25|$|The MOF {{encapsulation}} approach invites {{comparison to}} earlier studies of oxidative catalysis by zeolite-encapsulated Fe(porphyrin) {{as well as}} Mn(porphyrin) systems. The zeolite studies generally employed iodosylbenzene (PhIO), rather than TPHP as oxidant. The difference is likely mechanistically significant, thus complicating comparisons. Briefly, PhIO is a single oxygen atom donor, while TBHP is capable of more complex behavior. In addition, for the MOF-based system, {{it is conceivable that}} oxidation proceeds via both oxygen transfer from a manganese oxo intermediate as well as a manganese-initiated radical chain reaction pathway.

Simon Riches, in an essay included in The Philosophy of David Lynch, has noted that the Red Room dream sequence {{is an example of the}} difficulty in rationalizing a priori knowledge—the [...] "lack of empirical evidence that... a faculty of intuition exists" [...] in the mind is here represented by the [...] "nonphysical", dreamlike Red Room. Cooper's heuristic approach [...] "pointedly avoids the routine deductive apparati of logic, clues or muscle". The fact that the series' protagonist embraces this intuitive manner of deduction sets Twin Peaks [...] "at odds with the naturalistic trend in analytic philosophy".

500|$|Political Animals and Animal Politics was {{reviewed}} by Garner for Environmental Values, and the philosophers Josh Milburn and Dan Hooley for the Political Studies Review and the Journal of Animal Ethics respectively. Garner lamented {{the absence of}} many of the key voices in the political theory literature on animal ethics—such as Cochrane, Donaldson and Kymlicka, O'Sullivan, Tony Milligan, Kimberly Smith or Garner himself—in the book, meaning that Political Animals and Animal Politics [...] "takes on the role of an observer of this debate rather than directly contributing to it in a leading sense". In addition, he felt that the book offered little consideration of the details of the work of these leading theorists, identifying the absence of discussion of Cochrane's interest-based rights approach, a superficial consideration of Regan's account of animal rights, an oversimplification of his own position and a lack of context to understand the respective work of Kimberly Smith and O'Sullivan. He considered Wisseburg's chapter to be the only one which engages with the debate about the political turn in general, but notes that Wissenburg's <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> negative one; Garner considers this unsurprising, given that Wissenburg is a green political theorist with little sympathy for [...] "animal political theory".|$|E
500|$|A printed inverted-F antenna can be {{implemented}} in the classic inverted-F shape, usually {{to one side of}} the circuit board where the ground plane has been removed from underneath the antenna. [...] However, another <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> modified patch antenna, the shorted patch antenna. [...] In this approach, one edge of the patch, or some intermediate point, is grounded with grounding pins or vias through to the ground plane. [...] This works on the same principle as an inverted-F; viewed sideways, the F shape can be seen, it is just that the antenna element is very wide in the horizontal plane. [...] The shorted patch antenna has a wider bandwidth than the thin line type due to the greater radiation area. [...] Like the thin line type, the shorted patch antenna can be printed on the same printed circuit board as the rest of the circuitry. [...] However, they are commonly printed on to their own board, or on to a dielectric fixed to the main board. [...] This is done so that the antenna, can be suspended and effectively be in air dielectric, is a greater distance from the ground plane than it would otherwise be, or the dielectric used is a more suitable material for RF performance.|$|E

500|$|Punk rock vocals {{sometimes}} sound nasal, {{and lyrics}} are often shouted instead of sung {{in a conventional}} sense, particularly in hardcore styles. Shifts in pitch, volume, or intonational style are relatively infrequent. Punk rock's [...] "hoarse, rasping" [...] vocals and chanting were a {{sharp contrast to the}} [...] "melodic and sleeker" [...] singing in mainstream rock. Early punk vocals had an [...] "arrogant snarl". Complicated guitar solos are considered self-indulgent and unnecessary, although basic guitar breaks are common. Guitar parts tend to include highly distorted power chords or barre chords, creating a characteristic sound described by Christgau as a [...] "buzzsaw drone". Some punk rock bands take a surf rock approach with a lighter, twangier guitar tone. Others, such as Robert Quine, lead guitarist of the Voidoids, have employed a wild, [...] "gonzo" [...] attack, a style that stretches back through the Velvet Underground to the 1950s' recordings of Ike Turner. Bass guitar lines are often uncomplicated; the quintessential <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> relentless, repetitive [...] "forced rhythm", although some punk rock bass players—such as Mike Watt of the Minutemen and Firehose—emphasize more technical bass lines. Bassists often use a pick due to the rapid succession of notes, which makes fingerpicking impractical. Drums typically sound heavy and dry, and often have a minimal set-up. Compared to other forms of rock, syncopation is much less the rule. Hardcore drumming tends to be especially fast. Production tends to be minimalistic, with tracks sometimes laid down on home tape recorders or simple four-track portastudios. The typical objective is to have the recording sound unmanipulated and real, reflecting the commitment and authenticity of a live performance.|$|E
500|$|To the {{southeast}} of the hall is the stable block which partly surrounds a courtyard. [...] It has a south front of nine bays, the middle three of which project forwards and have a pediment carried on four large Doric pilasters. [...] The block originally had a cupola, but this has been removed. [...] A formal garden has been built between the east wing and the stable block. [...] Standing in this garden is a lead statue of a reclining, naked male figure, said to be Father Tiber, the river god. [...] This formerly stood in the Wilderness garden. [...] On {{the wall behind the}} statue are two carved unicorn heads, the emblem of the Legh family. [...] These formerly stood on pillars at the eastern entrance to the grounds. [...] The statues have been designated as a GradeII listed building. [...] A GradeII building is one that is [...] "nationally important and of special interest". [...] To the south of the formal garden is a stone statue of Napoleon carved by George Turner and dated 1837. [...] To the west of the hall is a ha-ha in rubble sandstone dating from the 18thcentury. It was built to act as a barrier between {{the west side of the}} garden and the deer park beyond it, and is listed GradeII. [...] Immediately to the south of the hall is a circular lawn, in the centre of which is a sundial that probably dates from about 1825. [...] Constructed in ashlar buff sandstone and standing on a pair of circular steps, it consists of an octagonal base with a partly fluted baluster supporting an octagonal moulded capstone. The capstone carries a copper plate inscribed with Roman numerals and the initials [...] "TL", and has a simple triangular gnomon. [...] The sundial is also listed GradeII. [...] Leading south from the lawn is a walk known as the Lime Avenue, which is entered through gates dated 1688. [...] The gates are in wrought iron and the piers in ashlar buff gritstone; these are again listed GradeII. [...] The avenue leads to another GradeII listed building, a structure known as the Shell House, so-called because its interior is decorated with shells and coloured mirrors. [...] It is a single-storey cottage constructed in red brick with buff sandstone dressings. [...] The roof is in stone-slate and the chimney is brick. [...] The wall is in brick with a stone coping. [...] In front of Shell Cottage another sundial, also listed GradeII. [...] This was probably built in the early 18thcentury for John Legh, and moved to its present position in the middle of that century. [...] It is thought that the pillar on which it stands was originally a Saxon cross base. [...] The octagonal copper plate is inscribed with Roman numerals, the longitude of Adlington, and John Legh's initials. [...] To the front of the Shell House is another walk, known as the Yew Walk. [...] At the back and side of the house is a rockery. [...] To the south and west of the Shell House is a wooded area known as the Wilderness, through which runs the River Dean (or Dene). [...] Many of the winding paths created by Charles Legh in the Wilderness are now overgrown, and some of the buildings are in a poor condition, or have collapsed into ruin. [...] One building still in good condition is the Tig House, a small square pavilion overlooking the river, an early example of a building in the Chinoiserie style. [...] It is constructed in red brick and partly clad in black and white timber framing. [...] It has a stone-slate pyramidal roof with a wooden finial, and is listed GradeII. [...] Near to this is the a bridge known as the Chinese Bridge crossing the river, but the summerhouse which once stood on the bridge is no longer present. [...] Another structure in the Wilderness is the Temple of Diana. [...] This is a circular temple with a dome constructed in ashlar buff sandstone. [...] It stands on a stylobate which supports six Doric columns and an entablature. [...] The structure is listed GradeII. [...] This appears to be in good condition, but in the early 2000s was said to be suffering from damp. [...] Other buildings known as the Rathouse and the Hermitage, have been damaged by falling trees. [...] At the north entrance to the grounds is a pair of gate piers that are listed GradeII. [...] The piers are in rusticated ashlar sandstone and are surmounted by ball finials. The gates are iron and are similar to those at the end of the lime avenue. [...] At the other end of the grounds, at the site of the former south <b>approach,</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> pair of sandstone gate piers dating from the middle of the 18th century.
