5|$|The gospel {{has been}} {{depicted}} in live narrations and dramatized in productions, skits, plays, and Passion Plays, {{as well as}} in film. The most recent such portrayal is the 2014 film 'The Gospel of John', directed by David Batty and narrated by David Harewood and Brian Cox, with Selva Rasalingam <b>as</b> <b>Jesus.</b> The 2003 film The Gospel of John, was directed by Philip Saville, narrated by Christopher Plummer, with Henry Ian Cusick <b>as</b> <b>Jesus.</b>|$|E
5|$|John Turturro <b>as</b> <b>Jesus</b> Quintana. The Coen {{brothers}} let Turturro {{come up with}} a lot of his {{own ideas}} for the character, like shining the bowling ball and the scene where he dances backwards, which he says was inspired by Muhammad Ali.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, John Turturro {{expressed}} {{keen interest}} in reprising his role <b>as</b> <b>Jesus</b> Quintana, and announced in 2014 that he had requested {{permission to use the}} character. In August 2016, it was reported that Turturro is reprising his role <b>as</b> <b>Jesus</b> Quintana in Going Places, a spin-off of The Big Lebowski, based on the 1974 French film Going Places, with Turturro starring, writing, and directing; it is currently filming. The Coen brothers, although having granted Turturro the right to use the character, will not be involved, and no other character from The Big Lebowski will be featured.|$|E

25|$|Paul {{describes}} God <b>as</b> declaring <b>Jesus</b> {{to be the}} Son of God {{by raising}} him from the dead, and Sanders argues Mark portrays God <b>as</b> adopting <b>Jesus</b> <b>as</b> his son at his baptism, although many others do not accept this interpretation of Mark. Sanders argues that for Jesus to be hailed as the Son of God {{does not mean that}} he is literally God's offspring. Rather, it indicates a very high designation, one who stands in a special relation to God.|$|R
5|$|According to Theissen and Merz, it {{is common}} for {{extraordinary}} charismatic leaders, such <b>as</b> <b>Jesus,</b> to come into conflict with their ordinary families. In Mark, Jesus' family comes to get him, fearing that he is mad (Mark 3:20–34), and this account is likely historical because early Christians would not have invented it. After Jesus' death, many members of his family joined the Christian movement. Jesus' brother James became a leader of the Jerusalem Church.|$|E

Kuncoro received a nomination at the 2011 Indonesian Film Festival for Best Supporting Actor for his role, but lost to Mathias Muchus of Pengejar Angin (The Wind Chaser).|$|E
5|$|Attitudes towards suicide slowly {{began to}} shift during the Renaissance. John Donne's work Biathanatos, {{contained}} {{one of the first}} modern defences of suicide, bringing proof from the conduct of Biblical figures, such <b>as</b> <b>Jesus,</b> Samson and Saul, and presenting arguments on grounds of reason and nature to sanction suicide in certain circumstances.|$|E
2500|$|In the novel, {{a line of}} the Gospel of Philip {{is quoted}} where Mary Magdalene is {{referred}} to <b>as</b> <b>Jesus's</b> [...] "companion", and a character of The Da Vinci Code says that Aramaic scholars know that this means [...] "wife". James M. Robinson, an authority on the gnostic gospels, has responded to this passage {{by pointing out that}} [...] "companion" [...] was not necessarily a sex-related term. In addition, [...] "the Gospel of Philip is in Coptic, translated from Greek, so there is no word in the text for Aramaic scholars to consider. The Gospel of Philip depicts Mary <b>as</b> <b>Jesus's</b> koinonos, a Greek term indicating a 'close friend', 'companion' or, potentially, a lover. In context of Gnostic beliefs, Gnostic writings use Mary to illustrate a disciple's spiritual relationship with Jesus, making any physical relationship irrelevant.|$|R

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>Jesus</b> vs. Santa {{became more}} popular, Parker and Stone began talks of {{developing}} the short into a television series. Fox refused {{to pick up the}} series, not wanting to air a show that included the character Mr. Hankey, a talking piece of feces. The two then entered negotiations with both MTV and Comedy Central. Parker preferred the show be produced by Comedy Central, fearing that MTV would turn it into a kids show. When Comedy Central executive Doug Herzog watched the short, he commissioned for it to be developed into a series.|$|E

5|$|The mural {{painted on}} {{the dome of the}} apse (pictured right) depicts Jesus seated on a cloud, red and golden rays {{radiating}} out of his golden halo. God the Father, pictured as a white-bearded man with triangular halo, looks down from a cloud above Jesus. A dove with a white halo, representing the Holy Spirit, flies just below God, wings outstretched, completing the Trinity. Above Jesus fly four cherubim. Seated to Jesus' right is Mary, his mother, and to his left Saint John the Baptist. On the same cloud <b>as</b> <b>Jesus,</b> three angels flank on each side. Slightly below Jesus, Mary, and John, two more flanking angels are depicted kneeling on their own clouds and swinging censers. Under the entire scene, a banner displays Gloria in Excelsis Deo.|$|E
5|$|The first {{event in}} which the team participated in 2009 was the Tour Down Under. As it was Armstrong's first event back {{after four years of}} retirement, he made lots of {{headlines}} and was even specially promoted on the event's webpage, though neither he nor the team were especially competitive in the event. Armstrong finished 29th overall, with the same time <b>as</b> <b>Jesús</b> Hernández in 28th as the best-placed Astana riders. The team did not finish in the top ten in any stage. In February, the team competed in the Tour of California, where Leipheimer won the individual time trial in Solvang and the Tour itself for the third straight year. The team also won the teams classification. While the Tour of California was ongoing, the team sent another eight-man squad including Contador and Andreas Klöden to the Volta ao Algarve. Contador and Klöden were first and third, respectively, in the time trial in Stage 4, giving Contador the overall lead which he retained through the conclusion of the race the next day.|$|E
