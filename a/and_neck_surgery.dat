50|$|Hiranandani was {{credited}} with several achievements in interventional medical treatment and medical administration. He pioneered many new surgical methods in otorhynolaryngology, which collectively {{came to be known}} as Dr Hiranandani's Operations. He initiated a treatment protocol for throat cancer, an initiative which was considered outside the purview of an ENT surgeon till then, which, reportedly, integrated head <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> <b>surgeries</b> with ENT. At BYL Nair Charitable Hospital, he established an ENT department incorporating head <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> <b>surgeries,</b> reported to be the first time in India an ENT department included head <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> surgical treatment also in its treatment range. The department was later named as Dr. Hiranandani's Department of Otolaryngology <b>and</b> Head & <b>Neck.</b> He also established the Post Graduate ENT Hospital, Speech and Audiology School and Vestibular Research Unit at BYL Hospital. He served as a member of the Advisory Committee of the Government of India for setting up medical colleges in the private sector and it was during his tenure at the committee that 14 medical colleges were established in Maharashtra and the retirement age of the medical academics of the state was raised from 58 to 65.|$|R

2500|$|These {{improvements}} in surgical techniques have allowed many tumours to be resected (removed) [...] by transoral (through the mouth) surgical approaches (TOS), using transoral endoscopic head <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> <b>surgery</b> (HNS). Consequently surgery became used more, increasing to 35% of cases by 2012. This approach has proven safety, efficacy and tolerability, and includes two main minimally invasive techniques, transoral robotic surgery (TORS) and transoral laser microsurgery (TLM). No direct comparisons {{of these two}} techniques have been conducted, and clinical trials in head and neck cancer such as ECOG 3311 allow either. They are associated with substantial postoperative morbidity, depending on extent of resection but compared to older techniques have shorter hospital stay, faster recovery, less pain, and less need for gastrostomy or tracheostomy, and less long term effects, which are minimal {{in the absence of}} postoperative radiation (RT), or chemoradiation (CRT). TORS has the practical advantage that angled telescopes and rotating robotic surgical arms provide better line of sight. Outcomes of minimally invasive procedures also compare favourably with more invasive ones. In early stage disease, including involvement of neck nodes, TORS produces a 2-year survival of 80–90%. TLM similarly, is reported to have a five-year survival of 78% and local control rates of 85–97%. In addition to early disease, minimally invasive surgery has been used in advanced cases, with up to 90% local control and disease specific survival. Postoperative swallowing was excellent in 87%, but long term dysphagia was associated with larger (T4) cancers, especially if involving the base of the tongue.|$|E
40|$|Head <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> cancers {{often require}} complex, labor-intensive surgeries, {{especially}} when free flap reconstruction is required. Enhanced recovery {{is important in}} this patient population but evidence-based protocols on perioperative care for this population are lacking. To provide a consensus-based protocol for optimal perioperative care of patients undergoing head <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> cancer <b>surgery</b> with free flap reconstruction. Following endorsement by the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) Society to develop this protocol, a systematic review was conducted for each topic. The PubMed and Cochrane databases were initially searched to identify relevant publications on head <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> cancer <b>surgery</b> from 1965 through April 2015. Consistent key words for each topic included "head <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> surgery," "pharyngectomy," "laryngectomy," "laryngopharyngectomy," "neck dissection," "parotid lymphadenectomy," "thyroidectomy," "oral cavity resection," "glossectomy," <b>and</b> "head <b>and</b> <b>neck.</b> " The final selection of literature included meta-analyses and systematic reviews as well as randomized controlled trials where available. In the absence of high-level data, case series and nonrandomized studies in head <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> cancer <b>surgery</b> patients or randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews in non-head <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> cancer <b>surgery</b> patients, were considered. An international panel of experts in major head <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> cancer <b>surgery</b> <b>and</b> enhanced recovery after surgery reviewed and assessed the literature for quality and developed recommendations for each topic based on the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. All recommendations were graded following a consensus discussion among the expert panel. The literature search, including a hand search of reference lists, identified 215 relevant publications that {{were considered to be}} the best evidence for the topic areas. A total of 17 topic areas were identified for inclusion in the protocol for the perioperative care of patients undergoing major head <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> cancer <b>surgery</b> with free flap reconstruction. Best practice includes several elements of perioperative care. Among these elements are the provision of preoperative carbohydrate treatment, pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis, perioperative antibiotics in clean-contaminated procedures, corticosteroid and antiemetic medications, short acting anxiolytics, goal-directed fluid management, opioid-sparing multimodal analgesia, frequent flap monitoring, early mobilization, and the avoidance of preoperative fasting. The evidence base for specific perioperative care elements in head <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> cancer <b>surgery</b> is variable and in many cases information from different surgerical procedures form the basis for these recommendations. Clinical evaluation of these recommendations is a logical next step and further research in this patient population is warranted...|$|R
