40|$|The geared {{permanent}} magnet d. c. starter motor has several significant advantages over the wound-field starter, {{some of which}} are discussed. The acceleration pegonnance and the cold cranking are shown to depend on both the battery internal resistance and the motor armature resistance. Typical motor characteristics and principles of design optimization are discussed, and it is shown that a motor of reduced weight and high eflciency is achieved compared with comparative conventional machines.

50|$|The ohm {{is defined}} as an {{electrical}} resistance between two points of a conductor when a constant potential difference of one volt, applied to these points, produces in the conductor a current of one <b>ampere,</b> the <b>conductor</b> not being the seat of any electromotive force.|$|R
40|$|The voltaic pile {{opened a}} new chapter in the history of electricity. Electrodynamics, which deals with flowing charges, became a basis for the {{practical}} utilization of electricity. In addition to classical electrostatics, the research of electrodynamics became increasingly extensive. Ányos Jedlik, professor of physics was a prominent personality at Pest University, in the period after Volta. In 1829 he experimented with <b>Ampére’s</b> <b>conductor</b> frame and, by using a commutator, fabricated a device capable of continuous rotation. He made high-power galvanic cells, and then his attention turned to induction-based generators. In 1861 he constructed a unipolar generator and came to the idea of self-excitation (the dynamo-electrical principle). He also continued dealing with electrostatics. By means of a cascade-connection capacitor battery, he multiplied the high voltage of the typical induction device of that age, which was the spark inductor, and thus created a connection between electrodynamics and electrostatics (1863). His scholarly activities span a period from the theoretical research in Volta’s age to the emergence of the electrical industry. 1. Electricity before Volt...|$|R
50|$|In {{applications}} where high currents (up {{to thousands}} of <b>amperes)</b> flow, solid <b>conductors</b> are usually replaced by tubes, completely eliminating the inner portion of the conductor where little current flows. This hardly affects the AC resistance, but considerably reduces {{the weight of the}} conductor. The high strength but low weight of tubes substantially increases span capability. Tubular conductors are typical in electric power switchyards where the distance between supporting insulators may be several meters. Long spans generally exhibit physical sag but this does not affect electrical performance. To avoid losses, the conductivity of the tube material must be high.|$|R
