500|$|... "Outrageous" [...] is an R {{song with}} {{influences}} of hip hop. The beat was compared by Gavin Mueller of Stylus Magazine to R. Kelly's 2003 single [...] "Snake". Jennifer Vineyard of MTV noted that [...] "she whispers and moans [...] with a snake charmer melody giving the song an exotic feel". Nick Southall of Stylus Magazine compared the background vocals {{to those of}} Punjabi musician Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. According to the sheetmusic published at Musicnotes.com by Universal Music Publishing Group, [...] "Outrageous" [...] is composed in the key of D major, with a tempo of 105 beats per minute. The song's lyrics talk about materialism and amusement, with Spears referencing in the chorus <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> give her pleasure, such as [...] "my world tour" [...] and [...] "my sex drive". Vineyard noted, [...] "the cumulative effect seems like it's designed to put the listener in the lover's shoes—taking {{full advantage of the}} aural male gaze". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine said the track [...] "includes a telling parallel that reveals a lot about one of music's biggest—as Alanis Morissette would put it—treadmill capitalists: she sings [...] "my sex drive" [...] and [...] "my shopping spree" [...] with the same dripping gusto".|$|E
500|$|... "Showdown" [...] has [...] "bubbly" [...] {{beats and}} its lyrics, about [...] "fighting and making up with carnal relations", include the lines [...] "I don’t {{really want to}} be a tease / But would you undo my zipper, please?" [...] Rolling Stone {{classified}} the song a pop-dancehall. The fourth track, [...] "Breathe on Me", was described as the most sensual song of the record. Containing trip hop influences, Spears sings, [...] "Oh, it's so hot, and I need some air/ And boy, don't stop 'cause I'm halfway there" [...] and [...] "Just put your lips together and blow." [...] "Early Mornin'" [...] depicts Spears looking for men at a club in New York City. The song has a percolating beat and featured subdued vocals from Spears, who purrs and yawns through the track. The nightclub Show is referenced. [...] "Toxic", which Spears later named as her favorite song from her career, was originally offered to Kylie Minogue. Released as the album's second single, it contains elements of electropop and bhangra music, and features varied instrumentation, such as drums, synthesizers, high-pitched strings and surf guitars. Lyrically, [...] "Toxic" [...] talks about being addicted to a lover. [...] "Outrageous", the fourth and final single from the album, is a hip hop-inspired track that according to MTV features Spears [...] "whisper and moan [...] with a snake charmer melody giving the song an exotic feel." [...] The lyrics talk about materialism and amusement, with the singer referencing in the chorus <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> give her pleasure. In [...] "Touch of My Hand", which Spears felt it was comparable to Janet Jackson's [...] "That's the Way Love Goes" [...] (1993), she sings in a lower register. The instrumentation contains elements of Middle Eastern music and its lyrics refer to masturbation, [...] "I will be bold/ Going to the places where I can be out of control/ Don't want to explain tonight/ All the things I try to hide." ...|$|E

60|$|In Sir Richmond, Dr. Martineau {{found the}} most {{interesting}} and encouraging confirmation of the fundamental idea of THE PSYCHOLOGY OF A NEW AGE, the immediate need of new criteria of conduct altogether. Here was a man whose life was evidently ruled by standards that were at once very high and very generous. He was overworking himself to the pitch of extreme distress and apparently {{he was doing this}} for ends that were essentially unselfish. Manifestly there were many things that an ordinary industrial or political magnate would do that Sir Richmond would not dream of doing, and <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> such a man would not feel called upon to do that he would regard as imperative duties. And mixed up with so much fine intention and fine conduct was this disreputable streak of intrigue and this extraordinary claim that such misconduct was necessary to continued vigour of action.|$|E

No one said anything about a next meeting when they parted at the gate of Palazzo Pinti, and Mrs. Bowen bade her coachman drive Colville to his hotel. But both the ladies' voices called good-night to him as he drove away. He fancied a shade of mocking in Miss Graham's voice.|$|E
6000|$|Tilb. Alas! my gentle Nora, Thy tender youth as yet hath never mourn'd Love's fatal dart. Else wouldst thou know, {{that when}} The soul is sunk in comfortless despair, It cannot taste of merriment." [...] Dang. That's certain. [...] "Con. But see where your stern father comes It is not meet {{that he should}} find you thus." [...] Puff. Hey, what the plague!--what a cut is here! Why, what is become of the {{description}} of her first meeting with Don Whiskerandos--his gallant behaviour in the sea-fight--and the simile of the canary-bird? Tilb. Indeed, sir, you'll find {{they will not be}} missed. Puff. Very well, very well! Tilb. [To CONFIDANT.] The cue, ma'am, if you please. [...] "Con. It is not meet that he should find you thus. Tilb. Thou counsel'st right; but 'tis no easy task For barefaced grief to wear a mask of joy. Enter. GOVERNOR.. Gov. How's this!--in tears?--O Tilburina, shame! Is this a time for maudling tenderness, And Cupid's baby woes?--Hast thou not heard That haughty Spain's pope-consecrated fleet Advances to our shores, while England's fate, Like a clipp'd guinea, trembles in the scale? Tilb. Then is the crisis of my fate at hand! I see the fleets approach--I see--" [...] Puff. Now, pray, gentlemen, mind. This {{is one of the most}} useful figures we tragedy writers have, by which a hero or heroine, in consideration of their being often obliged to overlook things that are on the stage, is allowed to hear and see <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> are not. Sneer. Yes; a kind of poetical second-sight! Puff. Yes.--Now then, madam. [...] "Tilb. I see their decks Are clear'd!--I see the signal made! The line is form'd!--a cable's length asunder! I see the frigates station'd in the rear; And now, I hear the thunder of the guns! I hear the victor's shouts--I also hear The vanquish'd groan!--and now 'tis smoke-and now I see the loose sails shiver in the wind! I see--I see--what soon you'll see-- Gov. Hold, daughter! peace! this love hath turn'd thy brain The Spanish fleet thou canst not see--because--It is not yet in sight!" [...] Dang. Egad, though, the governor seems to make no allowance for this poetical figure you talk of. Puff. No, a plain matter-of-fact man;--that's his character. [...] "Tilb. But will you then refuse his offer? Gov. I must--I will--I can--I ought--I do. Tilb. Think what a noble price. Gov. No more--you urge in vain. Tilb. His liberty is all he asks." [...] Sneer. All who asks, Mr. Puff? Who is-- Puff. Egad, sir, I can't tell! Here has been such cutting and slashing, I don't know where they have got to myself. Tilb. Indeed, sir, you will find it will connect very well. [...] "--And your reward secure." [...] Puff. Oh, if they hadn't been so devilish free with their cutting here, you would have found that Don Whiskerandos has been tampering for his liberty, and has persuaded Tilburina to make this proposal to her father. And now, pray observe the conciseness with which the argument is conducted. Egad, the pro and con goes as smart as hits in a fencing match. It is indeed a sort of small-sword-logic, which we have borrowed from the French. [...] "Tilb. A retreat in Spain! Gov. Outlawry here! Tilb. Your daughter's prayer! Gov. Your father's oath! Tilb. My lover! Gov. My country! Tilb. Tilburina! Gov. England! Tilb. A title! Gov. Honour! Tilb. A pension! Gov. Conscience! Tilb. A thousand pounds! Gov. Ha! thou hast touch'd me nearly!" [...] Puff. There you see-she threw in Tilburina. Quick, parry Carte with England! Ha! thrust in tierce a title!--parried by honour. Ha! a pension over the arm!--put by by conscience. Then flankonade with a thousand pounds--and a palpable hit, egad! [...] "Tilb. Canst thou--Reject the suppliant, and the daughter too? Gov. No more; I would not hear thee plead in vain: The father softens--but the governor Is fix'd! [Exit.]" [...] Dang. Ay, that antithesis of persons is a most established figure. [...] "Tilb. 'Tis well,--hence then, fond hopes,--fond passion hence; Duty, behold I am all over thine-- Whisk. [Without.] Where is my love--my-- Tilb. Ha! Enter DON FEROLO WHISKERANDOS. Whisk. My beauteous enemy!--" [...] Puff. O dear, ma'am, you must start a great deal more than that! Consider, you had just determined in favour of duty--when, in a moment, the sound of his voice revives your passion-- overthrows your resolution--destroys your obedience. If you don't express all that in your start, you do nothing at all. Tilb. Well, we'll try again. Dang. Speaking from within has always a fine effect. Sneer. Very. [...] "Whisk. My conquering Tilburina! How! is't thus We meet? why are thy looks averse? what means That falling tear--that frown of boding woe? Ha! now indeed I am a prisoner! Yes, now I feel the galling weight of these Disgraceful chains--which, cruel Tilburina! Thy doting captive gloried in before.--But thou art false, and Whiskerandos is undone! Tilb. O no! how little dost thou know thy Tilburina! Whisk. Art thou then true?--Begone cares, doubts, and fears, I make you all a present to the winds; And if the winds reject you--try the waves." [...] Puff. The wind, you know, is the established receiver of all stolen sighs, and cast-off griefs and apprehensions. [...] "Tilb. Yet must we part!--stern duty seals our doom Though here I call yon conscious clouds to witness, Could I pursue the bias of my soul, All friends, all right of parents, I'd disclaim, And thou, my Whiskerandos, shouldst be father And mother, brother, cousin, uncle, aunt, And friend to me! Whisk. Oh, matchless excellence! and must we part? Well, if--we must--we must--and in that case The less is said the better." [...] Puff. Heyday! here's a cut!--What, are all the mutual protestations out? Tilb. Now, pray, sir, don't interrupt us just here: you ruin our feelings. Puff. Your feelings!--but, zounds, my feelings, ma'am! Sneer. No, pray don't interrupt them. [...] "Whisk. One last embrace. Tilb. Now,--farewell, for ever. Whisk. For ever! Tilb. Ay, for ever! [Going.]" [...] Puff. 'Sdeath and fury!--Gad's life!--sir! madam! if you go out without the parting look, you might as well dance out. Here, here! Con. But pray, sir, how am I to get off here? Puff. You! pshaw! what the devil signifies how you get off! edge away at the top, or where you will--[Pushes the CONFIDANT off.] Now, ma'am, you see-- Tilb. We understand you, sir. [...] "Ay, for ever. Both. Oh! [Turning back, and exeunt.--Scene closes.]" [...] Dang. Oh, charming! Puff. Hey!--'tis pretty well, I believe: you see I don't attempt to strike out anything new--but I take it I improve on the established modes. Sneer. You do, indeed! But pray is not Queen Elizabeth to appear? Puff. No, not once--but she is to be talked of for ever; so that, egad, you'll think a hundred times that she is on the point of coming in. Sneer. Hang it, I think it's a pity to keep her in the green-room all the night. Puff. O no, that always has a fine effect--it keeps up expectation. Dang. But are we not to have a battle? Puff. Yes, yes, you will have a battle at last: but, egad, it's not to be by land, but by sea--and that is the only quite new thing in the piece. Dang. What, Drake at the Armada, hey? Puff. Yes, i'faith--fire-ships and all; then we shall end with the procession. Hey, that will do, I think?, Sneer. No doubt on't. Puff. Come, we must not lose time; so now for the under-plot. Sneer. What the plague, have you another plot? Puff. O Lord, yes; ever while you live have two plots to your tragedy. The grand point in managing them is only to let your under-plot have as little connection with your main-plot as possible.--I flatter myself nothing can be more distinct than mine; for as in my chief plot the characters are all great people, I have laid my under-plot in low life, and as the former is to end in deep distress, I make the other end as happy as a farce.--Now, Mr. Hopkins, as soon as you please. Enter UNDER PROMPTER. Under Promp. Sir, the carpenter says it is impossible you can go to the park scene yet. Puff. The park scene! no! I mean the description scene here, in the wood. Under Promp. Sir, the performers have cut it out. Puff. Cut it out! Under Promp. Yes, sir. Puff. What! the whole account of Queen Elizabeth? Under Promp. Yes, sir. Puff. And the description of her horse and side-saddle? Under Promp. Yes, sir. Puff. So, so; this is very fine indeed!--Mr. Hopkins, how the plague could you suffer this? Mr. Hop. [Within.] Sir, indeed the pruning-knife-- Puff. The pruning-knife--zounds!--the axe! Why, here has been such lopping and topping, I shan't have the bare trunk of my play left presently!--Very well, sir--the performers must do as they please; but, upon my soul, I'll print it every word. Sneer. That I would, indeed. Puff. Very well, sir; then we must go on.--Zounds! I would not have parted with the description of the horse!--Well, sir, go on.--Sir, it was one of the finest and most laboured things.-- Very well, sir; let them go on.--There you had him and his accoutrements, from the bit to the crupper.--Very well, sir; we must go to the park scene. Under Promp. Sir, there is the point: the carpenters say, that unless there is some business put in here before the drop, they sha'n't have time to clear away the fort, or sink Gravesend and the river. Puff. So! this is a pretty dilemma, truly!--Gentlemen, you must excuse me--these fellows will never be ready, unless I go and look after them myself. Sneer. O dear, sir, these little things will happen. Puff. To cut out this scene!--but I'll print it--egad, I'll print it every word! [Exeunt.] ...|$|E
