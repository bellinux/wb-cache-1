By December 1790, Hamilton believed import duties, which were the government's primary source of revenue, had been raised as high as was feasible. He therefore promoted passage of an excise tax on domestically distilled spirits. This {{was to be the}} first tax levied by the national government on a domestic product. Although taxes were politically unpopular, Hamilton believed the whiskey excise was a luxury tax that would be the least objectionable tax the government could levy. The tax also had the support of some social reformers, who hoped a [...] "sin tax" [...] would raise public awareness about the harmful effects of alcohol. The Distilled Spirits Duties Act, commonly known as the [...] "Whiskey Act", became law on March 3, 1791, and went into effect on June 1.|$|E
5000|$|In 1843, Spencer was {{appointed}} Secretary of the Treasury after {{the resignation of}} Walter Forward. As Treasury Secretary, he was preoccupied with the tariff and believed that the deficit and other federal expenditures should be funded by duties on imports rather than by internal taxation, something {{he was forced to}} announce for the fiscal year in 1843. [...] The expenditures of the treasury had exceeded its receipts and he advocated <b>additional</b> <b>import</b> <b>duties</b> on articles such as coffee and tea. To help fund the federal deficit he engaged in controversial issues of Treasury Notes. He also continued to develop a plan, originally initiated by Forward, for a Board of Exchequer to keep and disburse public funds raised by duties. The Exchequer bill, which reflected continuing interest in some form of independent treasury system, failed due to a political conflict in the United States Congress.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{critically}} {{reviews the}} main {{findings of the}} Appellate Body in the case India – Additional and Extra-Additional Duties on Imports from the United States (India – <b>Additional</b> <b>Import</b> <b>Duties).</b> This case {{is the first to}} assess the validity of border tax adjustment under Article II: 2 (a) of the GATT. Our analysis of this dispute raises some concerns about the legal reasoning of the Appellate Body, but comes {{to the conclusion that the}} Appellate Body’s economic reasoning was mostly correct. In its ruling, the Appellate Body considered that charges inconsistent with Article II: 2 (a) GATT fall within the scope of Article II: 1 (b) GATT and hereby underscored the distinction between ‘border charges’, covered under Article II GATT, and ‘internal charges’, covered under Article III GATT. Unfortunately, the Appellate Body failed to reveal the substantive obligation imposed on these charges under Article II: 1 (b). In our opinion, such charges should be covered under ‘other duties or charges’ and therefore only be deemed consistent with Article II: 1 (b) GATT in the unlikely case that they are explicitly recorded. status: publishe...|$|E

30|$|Firstly, Taiwan’s exports will be {{severely}} disadvantaged {{in regard to}} tariffs (Chinese National Federation of Industries 2015). Approximately 35 % of Taiwan’s manufacturing sector export products are liable to <b>import</b> <b>duty</b> in TPP member economies, with products liable to <b>import</b> <b>duty</b> of more than 5 % representing approximately 13 % of Taiwan’s total exports. In the Chilean, Australian and Vietnamese markets, more than 60 % of Taiwan’s export product items are liable to <b>import</b> <b>duty,</b> in most cases {{at a rate of}} 5 % or higher. Overall, tariff barriers in the US market are not as high as in the ASEAN member states; however, the US ranks second highest among the TPP member economies in terms of the total value of Taiwan’s exports that are liable to <b>import</b> <b>duty.</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an empirical analysis {{as to what}} extent countries {{have been able to}} recover revenue losses from <b>import</b> <b>duties</b> due to trade liberalization policies through indirect taxes. In contrast to the existing literature, we identify major trade liberalization policies and explore their revenue effects. Specifically, we investigate how revenues from <b>import</b> <b>duties</b> and consumption tax revenues change as a result over the course of GATT/WTO accession. Employing a robust difference-in-difference specification as well as non-parametric methods, our results reveal a substantial, statistically significant inverse relationship between GATT/WTO membership and <b>import</b> <b>duties</b> supporting concerns about revenue losses. At the same time, however, we find a significant increase in revenues from indirect taxes and VAT. Our findings indicate that countries joining GATT/WTO, including low income countries, have successfully substituted revenues from <b>import</b> <b>duties</b> with higher indirect taxes including VAT...|$|R
