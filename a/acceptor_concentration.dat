Samples have been grown by cold-wall chemical vapor deposition (CVD) in the Al <b>acceptor</b> <b>concentration</b> range from 3 × 1015  to  5. 5 × 1019  cm− 3.

Numerical calculations of the hole Hall mobility and the Hall scattering factor have been performed based on the low-field transport model using relaxation-time approximation.

Thin layers of poly (vinyl alcohol) of 10 or 20 nm with homogenously distributed donor (Cy 3) and acceptor (Cy 5) molecules were coated on silver islands and continuous silver films. Several geometrical configurations were studied with multiple donor-acceptor (D-A) samples with various <b>acceptor</b> <b>concentrations.</b> The <b>acceptor</b> <b>concentrations</b> were adjusted to yield FRET efficiencies from about 10 to 92 % on bare glass surfaces. Time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy {{was used to determine}} the energy transfer efficiency and the relative transfer rate.

The largest enhancements in the energy transfer efficiency, up to 90 %, were observed for low <b>acceptor</b> <b>concentrations</b> (large donor-acceptor separations). To a first approximation, observed changes in FRET efficiencies were explained by an increase of the quantum yield of the donor molecules in the presence of silver islands.

The measurement temperature at which the maximum light output occurs and the magnitude of the light output depend on the post-growth thermal anneal temperature.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of HIV reverse transcriptase (RT) catalyzed strand transfer synthesis (i. e., switching of the primer {{to a new}} template) from internal regions on RNA templates in the presence and absence of HIV nucleocapsid protein (NCp) was investigated. Two different systems each consisting of DNA-primed RNA donor (on which primer extension initiated) and acceptor (to which DNAs initiated on the donor could transfer) templates {{were used to determine}} kinetic parameters of strand transfer. The donor and acceptor shared an internal region of homology where homologous strand transfer could occur. The rate of strand transfer at various <b>acceptor</b> <b>concentrations</b> was determined by monitoring the production of transfer products over time. These rates were used to construct Lineweaver-Burk plots. In each system, NCp increased the Vmax about 3 -fold while the Km for acceptor template was decreased severalfold. NCp 2 ̆ 7 s effects on RT extension ranged from no effect to inhibition depending on the primer-template used. The lowered Km shows that NCp increases the affinity of the acceptor template for the transferring DNA. Vmax increases despite the inhibition of RT extension. The increased Vmax implies a stimulatory mechanism that cannot be mimicked by high <b>acceptor</b> <b>concentrations.</b> Therefore, NCp does not act by merely increasing the effective concentration of nucleic acids...|$|R

Both the above-bandgap steady-state and the below-bandgap transient photoconductivities of SI-GaAs wafers are measured using a Ka-band reflection-type microwave setup in which t ere {{is no need to}} fabricate electrical contacts on SI-GaAs wafers. A photoconductivity model adopted from the two-energy-level defect model for undoped LEC semi-insulating GaAs is used to derive the relationship between the photoinduced microwave response and the concentration of shallow acceptors, mainly carbon. In the above-bandgap hotoconductivity measurement, it is found that the steady-state microwave response is inversely proportional to the square root of the shallow <b>acceptor</b> <b>concentration.</b> In the below-bandgap photoconductivity measurement, the transient microwave response shows an initial fast decay and a second slower decay which has a Na-related ecay time constant.

40|$|Acyl-{{transfer}} catalysed by gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase from bovine kidney was studied using gamma-L- and gamma-D-Glu-p-nitroanilide as {{the donor}} and GlyGly as the acceptor. The {{transfer of the}} gamma-Glu group to GlyGly was shown {{to be accompanied by}} transfer of the gamma-Glu group to water (hydrolysis). The results were compared with acyl-transfer catalysed by the representative serine protease, alpha-chymotrypsin. The main difference between the kinetic mechanism of the acyl-transfer reactions catalysed by these enzymes, which contain an active-site serine and form an acyl-enzyme intermediate but belong to different enzyme classes, was found to consist {{in the role of the}} enzyme-donor-acceptor complex. This complex is not formed at any <b>acceptor</b> <b>concentrations</b> in the acyl-transfer reactions catalysed by the serine proteases. In contrast, in the gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase-catalysed acyl-transfer the pathway going through the ternary enzyme-donor-acceptor complex formed from the enzyme-acceptor complex becomes the main pathway of the transfer reaction even at moderate <b>acceptor</b> <b>concentrations.</b> As a result, gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase catalysis follows a sequential mechanism with random equilibrium addition of the substrates and ordered release of the products. The second distinction concerns the inhibitory effect of the acceptor. In the case of alpha-chymotrypsin this was the result of true inhibition, i. e. a dead-end formation of the enzyme-acceptor complex.

Previous studies investigating {{the reduction of}} Fe(III) oxides by DMRB focused on reactions under constant initial electron donor (lactate) and electron <b>acceptor</b> (Fe oxide) <b>concentrations.</b> Because the concentrations of these reactants can vary greatly in the environment and would be expected to influence the rate and extent of oxide reduction, the influence of variable electron <b>acceptor</b> and donor <b>concentrations</b> on hydrous ferric oxide (HFO) bioreductionwas investigated. Batch experiments were conducted in pH 7 HCO− 3 buffered media using Shewanella putrefaciens strain CN 32.

HFO was transformed to a variety of crystalline minerals including goethite, lepidocrocite, and siderite but was almost completely dissolved at high lactate to HFO ratios. These results indicate that electron donor and <b>acceptor</b> <b>concentrations</b> can greatly impact the bioreduction of HFO and the suite of Fe minerals formed as a result of reduction.
