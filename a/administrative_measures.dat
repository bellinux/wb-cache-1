5|$|Walter's chief <b>administrative</b> <b>measures</b> {{were his}} {{instructions}} to the itinerant justices of 1194 and 1198, his ordinance of 1195, an attempt to increase order in the kingdom, and his plan of 1198 {{for the assessment of}} a land tax. In 1194 the justices were ordered to secure the election of four coroners by each county court. The coroners were to keep, or register, royal pleas, which had previously been a duty of the sheriff. The juries were to be chosen by a committee of four knights, also elected by the county court. This introduction of coroners and constables eventually led to a change in the role of sheriffs, and a lessening of their importance in royal administration. Although he probably did not take part in the decision to set up a special exchequer for the collection of Richard's ransom, Walter did appoint the two escheators, or guardians of the amounts due, who were Hugh Bardulf in the north of England and William of Sainte-Mère-Eglise in the south. His instructions for the eyre, or circuits of traveling justices, are the first that survive in English history. It was during his tenure of the justiciarship that the judicial role of the Exchequer became separated from the purely financial aspects.|$|E

25|$|After depreciating {{during the}} last quarter of 2003/04, the afghani has been appreciating steadily, gaining 8 percent against the U.S. dollar between end-March 2004 and end-July 2004. This appreciation, at a time of {{increasing}} inflation, appears to reflect a greater willingness by the population to use the afghani as a medium of exchange and as a store of value. This trend appears to be attributable to the relative stability of the exchange rate since the introduction of the new currency, <b>administrative</b> <b>measures</b> aimed at promoting its use, such as the requirement that shopkeepers must price goods in afghani.

25|$|Although in Slovak, Romanian and Serbian history writing {{administrative}} and often repressive Magyarization is usually {{singled out as}} the main factor accountable for the dramatic change in the ethnic composition of the Kingdom of Hungary in the 19th century, {{it should be noted}} that spontaneous assimilation was also an important factor. In this regard, it must be pointed out that large territories of central and southern Kingdom of Hungary lost their previous, predominantly Magyar population during the numerous wars fought by the Habsburg and Ottoman empires in the 16th and 17th centuries. These empty lands were repopulated, by <b>administrative</b> <b>measures</b> adopted by the Vienna Court especially during the 18th century, by Hungarians and Slovaks from the northern part of the Kingdom that avoided the devastation (see also Royal Hungary), Swabians, Serbs (Serbs were majority in most southern parts of the Pannonian Plain during Ottoman rule, i.e. before those Habsburg <b>administrative</b> <b>measures),</b> Croats and Romanians. Various ethnic groups lived side by side (this ethnic heterogeneity is preserved until today in certain parts of Vojvodina, Bačka and Banat). After 1867, Hungarian became the lingua franca on this territory in the interaction between ethnic communities, and individuals who were born in mixed marriages between two non-Magyars often grew a full-fledged allegiance to the Hungarian nation. Of course since Latin was the official language until 1844 and the country was directly governed from Vienna (which excluded any large-scale governmental assimilation policy from the Hungarian side before the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, the factor of spontaneous assimilation should be given due weight in any analysis relating to the demographic tendencies of the Kingdom of Hungary in the 19th century.|$|E

Member states of the Arab League began implementing these resolutions through legal and <b>administrative</b> <b>measures.</b> After the Partition of Palestine into Arab and Jewish states was introduced at the United Nations on 29 November 1947, efforts to apply the boycott were intensified. However, the boycott was unsuccessful, as established in the first annual report of the Boycott Committee, and trade between Palestine (the vast majority by Jews) and Arab States neighboring Palestine continued to thrive.|$|E
25|$|The yatra caused growing {{unrest in}} its wake, {{resulting}} in the government being forced {{to take action against}} it. Throughout the yatra, the organizers chose multiple times to defy <b>administrative</b> <b>measures</b> to minimize the impact of the yatra. Sumanta Banerjee stated that the people arrested along the course of the rath yatra had all committed to violating the law. Advani paused the yatra in Delhi for several days, daring the central government to arrest him, which it did not. However, on 23 October the Indian Prime Minister V. P. Singh authorized Lalu Prasad Yadav, the Chief Minister of Bihar, to arrest Advani as the procession crossed the border with the state of Uttar Pradesh. Advani was placed in preventive custody. Following his imprisonment, Advani was held in the Masanjore Guest House, a luxury government accommodation. After his release, he stated that through the success of the rally, the power of the people had defeated the power of the state. Vishwa Hindu Parishad leader Ashok Singhal was also arrested, but managed to escape from police custody within a day. Other activists arrested were often improperly detained, or allowed to escape.|$|E
