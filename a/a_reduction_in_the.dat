5|$|Members of {{the family}} Theridiidae weave irregular, tangled, {{three-dimensional}} webs, popularly known as cobwebs. There {{seems to be an}} evolutionary trend towards <b>a</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> amount of sticky silk used, leading to its total absence in some species. The construction of cobwebs is less stereotyped than that of orb-webs, and may take several days.|$|E
5|$|Pingré also {{reported}} that the island was becoming deforested by tortoise hunters who set fires to clear vegetation. Along with direct hunting of the parrots, this likely led to <b>a</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> population of Rodrigues parrots. Pingré's 1761 account is the last known mention of the species, and it probably became extinct soon after.|$|E

5|$|Argentina had a tense {{relationship}} with the United Kingdom because of the recently ended Falklands War. The British government banned all foreign ships from the exclusion zone of the islands in 1986. Argentina organised air and marine patrols, as well as military maneuvers in the Patagonia. However, this {{was not enough to}} placate the military hard-liners in Argentina. Alfonsín proposed the postponement the sovereignty discussions, instead negotiating for a de jure cease of hostilities, with <b>a</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> number of military forces and a normalization of Argentina–United Kingdom relations. The United Kingdom did not trust the proposal, suspecting that it was a cover-up for sovereignty discussions.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the heavy security, {{businesses}} around the tower had seen decreased patronage due to less foot traffic around the heavily secured area. Protests around the tower subsided after his inauguration in January 2017, and by summer 2017, the security measures around the tower had been loosened somewhat, owing to the fact that most security measures were implemented only when Trump was actually in the tower. However, several businesses at the tower's base had closed by then because of <b>a</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> number of customers.|$|E

An Air Accidents Investigation Branch inquiry recommended a review of arrangements for aircraft taking off or landing towards the M11. As a result, the CAA and Duxford agreed to <b>a</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> runway's 1500m declared length, from 1350m to 1200m, in order to provide a greater margin of error.|$|E

5|$|By 1961, workers' basic wages {{had risen}} {{to an average of}} about 73 percent of their total {{earnings}}; piece-rate workers saw an average of 71 percent and time workers 76 percent of their earnings as their basic wage. There was also <b>a</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> overall level of quota overfulfillment—with quotas raised, many could not meet their own personal quota. The proportion of workers who achieved 100 percent or less of their quota varied from as low as 5.1 percent in iron and steel industries, to 31.4 percent in coal mining. Across Soviet industry, the average level of quota fulfillment fell from 169 percent before the reform, to 120 percent in October 1963.|$|E
5|$|Carletonomys cailoi is an extinct rodent {{from the}} Pleistocene (Ensenadan) of Buenos Aires Province, Argentina. Although known {{only from a}} single maxilla (upper jaw) with the first molar, its {{features}} are so distinctive that it is placed in its own genus, Carletonomys. Discovered in 1998 and formally described in 2008, {{it is part of}} a well-defined group of oryzomyine rodents that also includes Holochilus, Noronhomys, Lundomys, and Pseudoryzomys. This group is characterized by progressive semiaquatic specializations and <b>a</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> complexity of molar morphology.|$|E

5|$|Cádiz {{had been}} {{invested}} by the French in early 1810, leaving it accessible from the sea, but in March {{of the following}} year <b>a</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> besieging army gave its garrison of British and Spanish troops an opportunity to lift the siege. A large Allied strike force was shipped south from Cádiz to Tarifa, and moved to engage the siege lines from the rear. The French, {{under the command of}} Marshal Victor, were aware of the Allied movement and redeployed to prepare a trap. Victor placed one division on the road to Cádiz, blocking the Allied line of march, while his two remaining divisions fell on the single Anglo-Portuguese rearguard division under the command of Sir Thomas Graham.|$|E

5|$|In the Senate, {{the most}} {{prominent}} fight was over {{the need for a}} strong protective tariff, which made foreign goods more expensive but encouraged domestic manufacturing. Payne supported a high tariff, but thought some small reductions would be prudent {{in order to reduce the}} federal government's surplus. He joined fellow Senate Democrats in rejecting a tariff bill proposed by Iowa Republican William B. Allison, which would have raised the rates even higher than Payne thought prudent. His only contribution to the debate was to argue against <b>a</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tariff on steel and iron. This Allison bill passed the Republican-controlled Senate, but failed to pass in the House, which was controlled by Democrats.|$|E
