500|$|The {{scene in}} which Kurt comes out to his father was taken {{verbatim}} from series creator Ryan Murphy's own life. Murphy felt that the scene was [...] "a great thing to put on television", as, while audiences have seen gay characters isolated and attacked, they have rarely seen them ultimately winning and triumphing. He commented that: [...] "The show is about making you feel good in the end. It's about happy endings and optimism {{and the power of}} your personal journey and making you feel that the weird thing about me is the great thing about me. I’ve done other shows with gay characters, and I will say that in many of those cases, the gay characters didn't have a happy ending. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> know what? Enough." [...] Colfer has commented that his biggest challenge was in ensuring the scene felt [...] "honest" [...] and not comical or [...] "used as a punchline". He explained: [...] "I think it's probably the first time a character's sexuality has been respected and almost dignified in a way, and I think that's really important, and there needs to be more of that on TV." ...|$|E
