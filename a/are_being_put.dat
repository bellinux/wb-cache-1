5|$|Committee {{inquiries}} typically {{begin with}} the reference of an issue or a proposed law to the committee for inquiry and report back to the Senate. The committee will make a call for submissions, seeking public input on the matter referred to the committee. It will often publish those submissions to help inform stakeholders of the views that <b>are</b> <b>being</b> <b>put</b> to the committee. A committee will often hold one or more public hearings, at which committee members ask questions of key stakeholders interested in the issue under inquiry. These hearings may be held anywhere in Australia, are often broadcast, and result in a published transcript (Hansard) that records the evidence taken. The opportunity to make submissions, and the greater accessibility of the committees compared to parliament itself, can provide disadvantaged individuals and organisations valued opportunities to engage in democratic processes. Committees also frequently ask relevant government agencies to respond to issues raised by submissions or evidence given to the inquiry. Once evidence has been gathered there usually follows a period of research and analysis by the committee. It will then deliver {{a report to the}} Senate, which will generally include recommendations. The Commonwealth government is then expected to table a response to the report, stating responses to any recommendations the committee may have made.|$|E

Mali's cotton production has grown from 500,000 tonnes in 1997 to a record 635,000 tonnes in 2003, which has pleased the African Association of Cotton Producers, but has also led to a claim that cash crops <b>are</b> <b>being</b> <b>put</b> before food and fodder crops in Mali, Burkina Faso and Chad.|$|E

The Akha also participate in the regular tourist industry through the sale of their handicrafts and goods to local tourists, which they must often do under financial duress. Many of the Akha people {{do not see the}} tourism as halting the Westernizing and globalizing pressures but, rather, as a coercive commercialization and commodification of their culture.|$|E
25|$|The OpenType font format {{includes}} {{features for}} associating multiple glyphs {{to a single}} character, used for ligature substitution. Typesetting software {{may or may not}} implement this feature, even if it is explicitly present in the font's metadata. XeTeX is a TeX typesetting engine designed {{to make the most of}} such advanced features. This type of substitution used to be needed mainly for typesetting Arabic texts, but ligature lookups and substitutions <b>are</b> <b>being</b> <b>put</b> into all kinds of Western Latin OpenType fonts. In OpenType, there are standard liga, historical hlig, contextual clig, discretionary dlig and required rlig ligatures. These can be enabled or disabled in CSS3 using font-feature-settings.|$|E

[...] But Barr did state that [...] "doing nothing would not be advisable" [...] and that the government [...] "has to do something." [...] He explained that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac must be restructered. Barr was criticized by some Libertarians for these remarks.|$|E

2500|$|In 2012, it was {{announced}} that the single would be re-released on 28 May 2012, coinciding with the 35th anniversary of the original release and the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II. Lydon has voiced his disapproval over the re-release and the campaign, saying in a statement: [...] "I would like to very strongly distance myself from the recent stories and campaign to push 'God Save The Queen' for the number one spot. This campaign totally undermines what The Sex Pistols stood for. It is certainly not my personal plan or aim. I am proud of what The Sex Pistols achieved and always will be but this campaign totally undermines what The Sex Pistols stood for. This is not my campaign. I am pleased that the Sex Pistols recordings <b>are</b> <b>being</b> <b>put</b> out there for a new generation, however, I wish for no part in the circus that is being built up around it." [...] The 2012 re-release peaked at no. 80 in the singles chart.|$|E

2500|$|But {{there have}} been accusations of {{systematic}} trial delays, especially {{with regards to the}} New York City stop-and-frisk program. Out of more than 11,000 misdemeanor cases pending in 2012 in the Bronx, there were 300 misdemeanor trials. The Bronx criminal courts were responsible {{for more than half of}} the cases in New York City's criminal courts that were over two years old, and for two-thirds of the defendants waiting for their trials in jail for more than five years. In 2016, councilman Rory Lancman, noting that only about half of the about 107 appointed Criminal Court judges currently serve because the Chief Administrative Judge and Office of Court Administration have transferred them to Supreme Court to hear felony cases, said major reasons for the backlogs were a shortage of judges, court officers and courtrooms; a haphazard discovery process that frustrates timely plea deal negotiations; and a speedy trial statute unique to New York that allows the parties to game the system. The New York Times editorial board has criticized the Criminal Court judges for rarely excusing defendants from having to show up at every court appearance, as allowed by law, instead requiring them [...] "to return to court every several weeks and spend all day waiting for their cases to be called, only to be told that the proceedings <b>are</b> <b>being</b> <b>put</b> off for another month … [...] these defendants miss work, lose wages and in some cases their jobs." ...|$|E
