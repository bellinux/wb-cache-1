As expected, both sexes preferred partners low in the Dark Triad traits for long-term mating, while those high in these traits were preferred for <b>one-night</b> <b>stands.</b> However, women high in psychopathy considered the Dark Triad traits in potential male partners more physically attractive and desirable for <b>an</b> <b>one-night</b> <b>stand,</b> {{as well as a}} potential husband.
