40|$|Recently, discussions {{surrounding}} {{the prevalence of}} <b>anti-social</b> <b>behaviours</b> in the workplace have gained momentum due to their potential to negatively affect organisational productivity and individual effectiveness. Broadly speaking, 䡮tisocial behaviour? includes any behaviour that can result in emotional, psychological, physical and/or economic harm and can include violence, organisation-motivated and employee aggression, dysfunctional behaviours, victimisation and incivility in the workplace. Although there is much discussion on the topic in academic and practitioner circles, at present {{little is known about}} the prevalence of <b>anti-social</b> <b>behaviours</b> from an Australian perspective. This study seeks to address this gap, through conducting a national survey of Australia?s working population to gain this understanding. Preliminary findings from a pilot study due to be conducted in early 2011 will be presented and discussed in full at the symposium. Full Tex...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Proper {{nurturing}} {{of children}} is the primary responsibility of parents. Parents have inescapable responsibilities when bringing up their children. These responsibilities are automatically conferred on both parents of the child right from the child’s birth. They are expected to guide and modify the behaviour of their child to conform with the acceptable behaviours in the society as well as participate in activities aimed at preventing crime or disorder being committed by their children. Ironically, some parents have failed in these roles and functions. They adopt too much permissive and laissez-faire parenting styles that inadvertently make their children vulnerable to <b>anti-social</b> <b>behaviours.</b> This paper focuses on parents as the catalysts for children’s behaviour. The rationale for children’s <b>anti-social</b> <b>behaviours</b> are highlighted {{as well as some}} of the corrupt behaviours parents exhibit. The root causes of these behaviours are brought to the limelight and suggestions proffered for improving the task of parenting...|$|R

5|$|Parts of New Labour's {{political}} philosophy linked crime with social exclusion and pursued policies to encourage partnerships between social and police authorities to lower crime rates. Other areas of New Labour's policy maintained a traditional approach to crime; {{the prison population}} in 2005 rose to over 76,000, mostly owing to the increasing length of sentences. Following the September 11 attacks, the Labour government attempted to emphasise counter-terrorism measures. From 2002, the government followed policies aimed at reducing anti-social behaviour; in the 1998 Crime and Disorder Act, Labour introduced <b>Anti-Social</b> <b>Behaviour</b> Orders (ASBOs).|$|E

30|$|Although the {{proportion}} of 19 -year-old teenagers who drink regularly is quite low (less than 1 % drink alcohol {{on a daily basis}} and 3 % at least once per week), alcohol consumption increases tremendously between age 15 and 19 as for the number of times they abuse from alcohol consumption.

5|$|The village {{developed}} along Town Street, a school, {{chapel and}} church {{were built in}} the 19th century but after the land was acquired by Leeds Council in 1920 a large council housing estate was built on the flatter land to the south, completely changing the rural nature of the settlement. Early transport was provided by a tram line and the Leeds Ring Road was built to Middleton. After the colliery closed the area began to decline and by 2001, had areas of multiple deprivation and high levels of unemployment and <b>anti-social</b> <b>behaviour.</b> The Middleton Regeneration Board has been established with the remit of addressing these issues.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{budget cuts}} by Gateshead Council {{have seen the}} local {{authority}} transfer {{the management of the}} park to the community, despite a local petition raised in protest. The reserve remains popular with residents; in May 2012 dozens of volunteers cleared rubbish and engaged in a 'Windy Nook Wildlife Festival' with face-painting and other traditional activities. Local police continue to make 'targeted patrols' of the reserve to maintain the downward trend of <b>anti-social</b> <b>behaviour</b> in the area. In November 2012 a 'green gym' was opened at the reserve. This saw fitness equipment installed in clusters of three and four machines which is available for use by the public free of charge. This is one of only two such outdoor public gyms in Gateshead, the other being opened simultaneously at Saltwell Park.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{exposure}} in children is also correlated with neuropsychiatric {{disorders such as}} {{attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}} and <b>anti-social</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Elevated lead levels in children are correlated with higher scores on aggression and delinquency measures. A correlation has also been found between prenatal and early childhood lead exposure and violent crime in adulthood. Countries with the highest air lead levels have also been found to have the highest murder rates, after adjusting for confounding factors. A May 2000 study by economic consultant Rick Nevin theorizes that lead exposure explains 65% to 90% of the variation in violent crime rates in the US. A 2007 paper by the same author claims to show a strong association between preschool blood lead and subsequent crime rate trends over several decades across nine countries. Lead {{exposure in}} childhood appears to increase school suspensions and juvenile detention among boys. It is believed that the U.S. ban on lead paint in buildings in the late 1970s, as well as the phaseout of leaded gasoline in the 1970s and 1980s, partially helped contribute to the decline of violent crime in the United States since the early 1990s.|$|E

40|$|The {{utilization}} of banned substances by the athletes is a cheating approach and criminal act to sports practice. It increases unhealthy and <b>anti-social</b> <b>behaviours</b> in sports. It is {{against this background}} that this paper examined the behavioural dispositions of athletes within sport setting. A descriptive research design {{was used for the}} study. A sample of 510 elite athletes drawn from nine tertiary institutions in three states in Nigeria- Lagos, Ogun and Osun was selected using purposive, sample and stratified random sampling techniques. The researchers constructed A 21 – item questionnaire to gather relevant information for the study. The instrument was validated and had a reliability coefficient of 0. 79. Frequency counts, percentages, means scores, standard deviation and t-test were used to analyze the data collected. Findings of the study revealed that most athletes who were involved in doping felt uncomfortable when defeated in sports contest, afraid to approach their coaches and exhibited various <b>anti-social</b> <b>behaviours</b> after sports competitions. However, {{there was no significant difference}} between the athletes who used doping substances and those who did not use in their behavioural dispositions. The behaviours exhibited were recognized by the coaches and rebuked accordingly. It was therefore recommended that sports handlers should educate their athletes on the psychological problems of doping to achieve competitive advantage.

The results suggest that low-level disruptive and disengaged student behaviours occur frequently and teachers find them difficult to manage. Aggressive and <b>anti-social</b> <b>behaviours</b> occur infrequently. Teachers employ strategies to manage unproductive behaviours that locate the problem with the student. This paper argues that teachers could benefit from understanding how the classroom ecology influences engagement and therefore student behaviour, rather than focusing on ‘fixing’ unproductive behaviour...|$|R

40|$|In {{the context}} of social and {{emotional}} education, this research sets out to examine influential factors in peer perception {{and the effects of}} negative perceptions on selfesteem and academic success. Children's pro-social and <b>anti-social</b> <b>behaviours</b> are discussed in relation to how they might influence perception and how classroom dynamics are affected. Variables linked to peer popularity are examined in more detail with support from relevant literature before methodologies for social research are presented. A series of observations and interviews help to identify children with different levels of peer acceptance (popular, accepted, neglected, rejected and controversial) while case studies of children in each of these sociometric niches aims to establish correlations between variables and levels of peer acceptance. Findings are summarised with implications for practice and a reminder of the importance of peer acceptance on self-esteem, emotional development and academic success. Faculty of Educatio...|$|R
40|$|Try {{to imagine}} a fire {{emergency}} evacuation. What is the first image {{that you have in}} your mind? Here there are some guesses. Probably a parent running inside a house trying to rescue her children, but not managing since she is too scared? An old man stuck crying in a corner of a room with flames and smoke all around him? Or a group of people crushing aggressively against each other in order {{to get out of a}} building through a very small exit door? Almost surely you have thought about people shouting and screaming for help, without doing any constructive actions. Well, these scenarios represent a significant minority of what a fire evacuation generally is. When we think about a fire emergency, we often think about people losing their rationality, rushing irrationally in search of an exit or searching desperately for help. Nevertheless, researchers generally do not agree with this interpretation. This misconception comes from the public opinion, in which a fire emergency is often linked to the word “panic”. Human behaviour in fire emergencies used in media accounts and survivors’ statement is generally associated with panic behaviour. In contrast with this stereotype, the concept that a fire might cause panic has been abandoned by the scientific community [1]. The definition of panic itself has been largely questioned in several research studies [2, 3]. Feelings such as anxiety and stress may occur during a fire emergency, but they do not generally lead to irrational or <b>anti-social</b> <b>behaviours</b> [1]. Evacuees generally tend to behave rationally, with non-rational and <b>anti-social</b> <b>behaviours</b> occurring in very rare occasions, mostly in very extreme scenarios in which the probability of surviving perceived is extremely low [2]. In fact, most people do not develop shock reactions, and tend to act in accordance to what they think is in their best interest, given the limited understanding they have of the situation...|$|R
