40|$|Pediatric {{patients}} are {{at higher risk}} to the adverse effects from exposure to ionizing radiation than adults. The smaller sizes of the anatomy and the reduced X-ray attenuation of the tissues provide special challenges. The goal of this effort is to investigate strategies for pediatric fluoroscopy {{in order to minimize}} the radiation exposure to these individuals, while maintaining effective diagnostic image quality. Modern fluoroscopy systems are often entirely automated and computer controlled. In this paper, various selectable and automated modes are examined to determine the influence of the fluoroscopy parameters upon the patient radiation exposures and image quality. These parameters include variable X-ray beam filters, <b>automatic</b> <b>brightness</b> <b>control</b> programs, starting kilovolt peak levels, fluoroscopic pulse rates, and other factors. Typical values of radiation exposure rates have been measured for a range of phantom thicknesses from 5 cm to 20 cm of acrylic. Other factors that have been assessed include spatial resolution, lowcontrast discrimination, and temporal resolution. The selection menu for various procedures is based upon the examination type, anatomical region, and patient size. For pediatric patients, the automated system can employ additional filtration, special <b>automatic</b> <b>brightness</b> <b>control</b> curves, pulsed fluoroscopy, and other features to reduce the patient radiation exposures without significantly compromising the image quality. The benefits gained from an optimal selection of automated programs and settings for fluoroscopy include ease of operation, better image quality, and lower patient radiation exposures.

It {{is also important to}} gain the benefits of image processing and the higher sensitivity of flat panel detectors as compared to image intensifier-TV systems. Proper positioning of the patient with respect to detector and X-ray tube is of fundamental importance to image quality and radiation dose to the patient. Both image quality and radiation dose are also affected by the methodology used with parameters such as magnification factor, increased filtration, use of last-image-hold and the use of a grid. There is a direct relation between patient dose and the absorbed dose to the personnel since this is mostly due to scattered radiation from the patient. If the correct methodology and the correct radiation protection devices are used, the absorbed dose to the personnel could be minimised to acceptable levels even for those working with complex procedures. In order to have an organised review of all aspects of optimisation, it is recommendable to have an active qualit...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Visible light {{communication}} (VLC) {{systems can}} provide illumination and communication simultaneously via {{light emitting diodes}} (LEDs). Orthogonal frequency division multi-plexing (OFDM) waveforms transmitted in a VLC system will have high peak-to-average power ratios (PAPRs). Since the transmitting LED is dynamic-range limited, OFDM signal has to be scaled and biased to avoid nonlinear distortion. <b>Brightness</b> <b>control</b> is an essential feature for the illumination function. In this paper, we will analyze the performance of dynamic range constrained visible light OFDM systems with biasing adjustment and pulse width modulation (PWM) methods. We will investigate the trade-off between duty cycle and forward ratio of PWM and find the optimum forward ratio to maximize the achievable ergodic rates.

Clipping can cause the performance degradation of communication as well as illumination. In this paper, we will propose an iterative clipping method considering <b>brightness</b> <b>control</b> and flicker mitigation.
