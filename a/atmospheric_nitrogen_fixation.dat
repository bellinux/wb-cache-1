40|$|Mycorrhiza is the {{symbiotic}} association of fungi in {{the roots of}} autotrophs. Arbuscular Mycorrhizae Fungi (AMF) {{is a type of}} endomycorrhiza. About two-thirds of modern plants form arbuscular mycorrhizas making this the most ubiquitous and abundant terrestrial symbiosis. AFM contribute to a more efficient water use and uptake of nutrients, especially of phosphorus, by plants, while prevent the absorption of toxic elements, and protect plants from pathogens. Except from the productivity and nutrient cycling, AFM also can influence species composition and thereby species diversity in a plant community, through the development of specialized associations with plants. There is a wealth of information from experiments under controlled conditions to indicate that AMF improve P relations and plant growth. However, results from more realistic field-based studies are less conclusive. Evidence for a general role of AMF in plant P-relations in temperate regions is at best conflicting, or at worst absents, probably because soils in those regions are not strongly P-limited. On the other hand, AMF in tropical regions, where soils may be strongly P-limiting, have be shown to improve plant P-relations The objectives of this study were to determine: (a) whether and in what degree AMF occur in natural plant communities of Greece and how fungicides and availability of nitrogen, phosphorus and water influence their colonization, (b) how AFM together with nitrogen phosphorus and irrigation, or with species richness influence primary productivity and phosphorus uptake in plant communities of non productive soils. An additional objective {{of this study was to}} investigate whether nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations and ratios of individual species appear to depend on the particular ecological context in which species have grown or by species-specific physiological requirements for nitrogen and phosphorus. Furthermore and in the case of dependence of nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations of individual species on the particular ecological context in which species have grown, another objective was to examine whether the relationship between nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations is influenced by AMF, <b>atmospheric</b> <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixation</b> of legumes and the differences among plant species in distribution of roots with the depth of soil A three years field experiment in an upland grassland and a two years experiment in pots have shown that: (a) AMF are abundant mainly among legumes and forbs. (b) AMF activity was suppressed by the fungicide applications, but suppression was influenced by active ingredients and formulations. (c) Τhis suppression reduced the above-ground biomass and phosphorus uptake of phosphorus demanding forbs, and these reductions were compensated by respective increases of grasses. (d) Νitrogen and phosphorus concentrations of non legume species were positively related in all harvests made; the proportion of variance attributed to linear regression (i. e. R 2) tended to decrease in the late harvests of the growing period; legumes were always deviated from the best fitted regression lines because either they have specific nitrogen requirements or because they take up additional nitrogen through <b>atmospheric</b> <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixation.</b> (e) Αmong the species used in the pot experiment, there was no relationship between productivity in monocultures and competitive ability in mixed cultures. (f) Plant community productivity and phosphorus accumulation tended to increase with increasing species richness, although there were monocultures with greater performance than the mixed cultures of the highest species richness; complementary effect also increased with increasing species richness and effect was more pronounced in phosphorus accumulation than in productivity. These results indicate that AMF improve plant growth phosphorus uptake by plants in the usually phosphorus limiting soils of Mediterranean climate regions. Moreover, it is documented that non-legumes species take up nitrogen and phosphorus in proportions determined by the particular ecological context in which species have grown. Legumes take up proportionally more nitrogen because either they have specific nitrogen requirements or because they take up additional nitrogen through <b>atmospheric</b> <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixation.</b> If the latter is correct, nitrogen fixation could be estimated by these deviations in nitrogen concentrations from the regression line between nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations of non legume species. ...|$|E
