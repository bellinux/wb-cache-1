25|$|While {{talks with}} the Raiders were {{secretly}} under way, the Glazers publicly pursued another respected offensive mind, San Francisco 49ers head coach Steve Mariucci. Just when initial reports indicated that Mariucci had agreed to become both the Bucs' head coach and their general manager, Raiders owner <b>Al</b> <b>Davis</b> agreed to release Gruden to Tampa Bay.|$|E
25|$|Foss {{stepped aside}} as {{commissioner}} in April 1966, {{two months before}} the historic agreement that led to the merger of AFL and NFL and the creation of the Super Bowl. <b>Al</b> <b>Davis</b> succeeded him, but disagreed with the merger and resigned after 3½ months. Milt Woodard, the assistant commissioner under Foss, was named to the new office of president of the AFL in July and served through the league's final season in 1969.|$|E
5000|$|Despite the {{animosity}} {{between the}} Raiders and Kiffin, he {{released a statement}} following <b>Al</b> <b>Davis's</b> death in October 2011 stating that although their relationship had not ended well, he appreciated the opportunity Davis had given him and had [...] "nothing but the greatest respect" [...] for the late Raiders owner.|$|R
5000|$|Entering the 2006 season, Porter {{publicly}} voiced his {{dissatisfaction with}} newly hired head coach Art Shell, and during training camp, demanded to be traded. Porter's conflict with Shell occurred {{very early in}} training camp, when Shell announced that champagne {{would no longer be}} allowed at the training facility. In addition to his public complaints, he reportedly parked in owner <b>Al</b> <b>Davis's</b> personal parking spot. As a result of his attitude, Coach Shell deactivated him [...] "until further notice".|$|R
5000|$|His {{football}} {{career was}} often overshadowed by his even more famous use of drugs. In his autobiography, {{he stated that}} he took many painkillers {{as well as other}} narcotics while playing professional football. Because of this, an article written for Sports Illustrateds website in January 2005 named him one of the top five all-time [...] "bad boys" [...] of the NFL. Although his performances {{made him one of the}} best Raider defenders of all time, his volatile actions contributed to him not being popular with teammates and not being in <b>Al</b> <b>Davis's</b> favour.|$|R
25|$|During that time, {{the most}} {{significant}} suit in modern NFL history was brought. The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission (LAMCC) sued the league over its provision requiring unanimous approval from other owners for franchise moves, which had otherwise hindered its efforts to conclude a lease with the Raiders, then playing in Oakland, where owner <b>Al</b> <b>Davis</b> was unhappy with the condition of Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum. Davis had also been incensed that the league had allowed the LA Coliseum's previous NFL team, the Los Angeles Rams, to move to Anaheim Stadium despite his abstention from the vote. His team began play in the LA Coliseum in 1982.|$|E
25|$|The AFL also spawned coaches whose {{style and}} {{techniques}} have profoundly affected {{the play of}} professional football to this day. In addition to AFL greats like Hank Stram, Lou Saban, Sid Gillman and <b>Al</b> <b>Davis</b> were eventual hall of fame coaches such as Bill Walsh, a protégé of Davis with the AFL Oakland Raiders for one season; and Chuck Noll, who worked for Gillman and the AFL LA/San Diego Chargers from 1960 through 1965. Others include Buddy Ryan (AFL's New York Jets), Chuck Knox (Jets), Walt Michaels (Jets), and John Madden (AFL's Oakland Raiders). Additionally, many prominent coaches began their pro football careers as players in the AFL, including Sam Wyche (Cincinnati Bengals), Marty Schottenheimer (Buffalo Bills), Wayne Fontes (Jets), and two-time Super Bowl winner Tom Flores (Oakland Raiders). Flores also has a Super Bowl ring as a player (1969 Kansas City Chiefs).|$|E
25|$|In 1966, {{the rivalry}} between the AFL and NFL reached an all-time peak. On April 7, Joe Foss {{resigned}} as AFL commissioner. His successor was Oakland Raiders {{head coach and}} general manager <b>Al</b> <b>Davis,</b> who had been instrumental in turning around the fortunes of that franchise. No longer content with trying to outbid the NFL for college talent, the AFL under Davis started to recruit players already on NFL squads. Davis's strategy focused on quarterbacks in particular, and in two months he persuaded seven NFL quarterbacks to sign with the AFL. Although Davis's intention was to help the AFL win the bidding war, some AFL and NFL owners saw the escalation as detrimental to both leagues. Alarmed with the rate of spending in the league, Hilton Hotels forced Barron Hilton to relinquish his stake in the Chargers {{as a condition of}} maintaining his leadership role with the hotel chain.|$|E

25|$|Jackson held true to his threat not to sign, and the Buccaneers {{forfeited}} {{his rights}} before the 1987 draft. Jackson was {{in spring training}} with the Royals when someone informed {{him that he had}} a chance to play football again. Inquiring who it was, Jackson found out that he was taken in the seventh round of the draft with the 183rd pick by the Los Angeles Raiders. Initially Jackson had said he would continue to focus on baseball and would not sign, but his interest was piqued. Raiders owner <b>Al</b> <b>Davis</b> was a fan of Jackson and was receptive to the idea of Jackson playing both baseball and football. Thus, a contract was negotiated where Jackson would be permitted to play the entire baseball season with the Royals and would report to the Raiders once the season was finished. In addition to this, Davis gave Jackson a salary that was in line with what a top-flight starter at halfback would make.|$|E

500|$|Cannon {{was traded}} to the Oakland Raiders before the 1964 season. Raiders head coach <b>Al</b> <b>Davis</b> liked Cannon's {{abilities}} but did not know how he wanted to use him. At first Davis moved Cannon to fullback, where he was an asset in catching passes, an attribute not all fullbacks then possessed. After a slow start, he finished the season with 37 receptions for 454 yards and eight touchdowns. He also rushed for three more touchdowns. Next season Davis moved him to tight end, to the chagrin of Cannon; he expected to be made into a wide receiver, but the Raiders had both Art Powell and rookie Fred Biletnikoff to cover that position. He eventually accepted his [...] new role and adapted quickly to it. However, the tight end was seldom used in the Raiders' offense. He caught only seven passes that season with no touchdowns. Before the 1966 season, John Rauch took over as head coach as <b>Al</b> <b>Davis</b> became AFL commissioner and the Raiders' general manager. Cannon established himself as a deep threat in Rauch's offense and caught fourteen passes for 436 yards—an average of 31.4 yards per reception.|$|E

After attempts to have Sacramento State upgrade or replace the facility failed, he announced in October 1994—with two weeks {{to go in the}} season—that the Gold Miners would be playing elsewhere in 1995. [...] Anderson initially intended to move to Oakland, but quickly abandoned those plans after it became apparent that Los Angeles Raiders owner <b>Al</b> <b>Davis</b> was seriously considering moving his NFL franchise back to their original city. The Gold Miners eventually moved to the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas; where they would play as the San Antonio Texans.|$|E
500|$|However, while Culverhouse's {{relationship}} with Tampa had been problematic for years, the Bo Jackson 1986 draft debacle permanently ruined the owner's reputation {{in his home}} city. Jackson, the Heisman Trophy-winning running back from Auburn, was the consensus #1 player headed into the draft. But Jackson disliked Culverhouse from their first meeting, later writing in his book [...] "Bo Knows Bo" [...] that the Bucs' owner had a miserable record and also that after Jackson's agents requested Tampa Bay not pick him, the Bucs refused all trade offers (including what Jackson described as a generous offer from <b>Al</b> <b>Davis)</b> and later told Jackson they would cut their contract offer in half if he didn't accept a below-market deal. Jackson announced he would play major league baseball instead, signing {{a contract with the}} Kansas City Royals and leaving the Bucs as the NFL's laughingstock.|$|E

It seems the Jets always lose to us because of penalties. But I like them and don't want any feud in case we visit New York December 29 [...] ". The Jets left their white road uniforms in Oakland to be laundered and sent to them in San Diego, where they were to play their next game. The uniforms were not seen again once the team removed them in the Oakland locker room, and Jets management hastily ordered the green home uniforms, as well as the white uniforms the team had worn in the preseason, to be shipped from New York.|$|E

500|$|Culverhouse {{was named}} one of the executors of Rosenbloom's estate, and after Rosenbloom's death, Culverhouse {{continued}} a business relationship with his widow, Georgia. Georgia's marriage to composer Dominic Frontiere took place at Culverhouse's home, with Culverhouse himself, a notary public, performing the ceremony. The relationship, in which Culverhouse served as an advisor to the Los Angeles Rams while maintaining ownership of the Buccaneers, was criticized as a conflict of interest. The Los Angeles Coliseum Council accused the Rams of seeking Culverhouse's counsel when several players held out during the 1980 preseason; the Buccaneers won a 10–9 victory over that same unprepared Rams team early that season. Culverhouse also oversaw a reorganization of the Rams' front office; the relationship earned him the nickname of [...] "Godfather" [...] of the Rams. Culverhouse and Frontiere were two of the owners named in a lawsuit brought by <b>Al</b> <b>Davis,</b> who alleged that their campaign contributions to Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia were an attempt to buy his support in helping to prevent Davis' planned move of the Oakland Raiders to Los Angeles.|$|E
500|$|Shell is {{the only}} coach {{to have more than}} one tenure with the team, and Flores and Shell are the only coaches to have coached the team in both Oakland and Los Angeles. The worst coach {{statistically}} in Raiders history is Red Conkright, with a winning percentage of [...]111, while Rauch is statistically the best, with a winning percentage of [...]805. However, the all-time leader in both games coached and wins is Madden, with 142 and 103 respectively. Of the 20 Raiders coaches, <b>Al</b> <b>Davis</b> and Madden are the only Raider coaches to be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame for their contributions as coaches. Davis, who was also the Managing General partner and an AFL Commissioner, was in the Hall of Fame class of 1992. Madden was in the 2006 class. Two coaches, Flores and Shell, are also former players for the Raiders. Shell was also inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1989, but as a player. The current coach is Jack Del Rio.|$|E
500|$|The {{two teams}} {{did not play}} in the same division. However, each AFL team played all other {{teams in the league}} each year, {{allowing}} the Raiders and Jets to forge a bitter rivalry. In 1963, Oakland general manager (later owner) <b>Al</b> <b>Davis</b> traded guard Dan Ficca to New York during training camp, without mentioning to Ewbank (who was also the Jets' general manager) that Ficca would not be released from his military service for another six weeks. In 1966, with less than a minute to go and the Raiders leading at the new Oakland Coliseum, 28–20, Jets left tackle Winston Hill predicted to Namath in the huddle that the man he was blocking, Ben Davidson, would rush on the next play, leaving the Raiders exposed to a draw play. Namath called the draw, and handed the ball off to running back Emerson Boozer for 47 yards and a touchdown. After a Jets two-point conversion, the game ended in a 28–28 tie, and an embittered Davidson stated, [...] "I'll get even. They still have to play us next year." [...] They did, twice. In Week 4, the Jets defeated the Raiders at Shea Stadium, 27–14; this was the Raiders' only regular season loss. In Week 14, each team's 13th game, the teams met again, in Oakland.

500|$|The AFL {{became a}} viable {{alternative}} to the NFL as it made a concerted effort to attract established talent away from the NFL, signing half of the NFL's first-round draft choices in 1960. The AFL worked hard to secure top college players, many from sources virtually untapped by the established league: small colleges and predominantly black colleges. Two of the eight coaches of the Original Eight AFL franchises, Hank Stram (Texans/Chiefs) and Sid Gillman (Chargers) eventually were inducted to the Hall of Fame. Led by Oakland Raiders owner and AFL commissioner <b>Al</b> <b>Davis,</b> the AFL established a [...] "war chest" [...] to entice top talent with higher pay than they got from the NFL. Former Green Bay Packers quarterback Babe Parilli became a star for the Boston Patriots {{during the early years of}} the AFL, and University of Alabama passer Joe Namath rejected the NFL to play for the New York Jets. Namath became the face of the league as it reached its height of popularity in the mid-1960s. Davis's methods worked, and in 1966, the junior league forced a partial merger with the NFL. The two leagues agreed to have a common draft and play in a common season-ending championship game, known as the AFL-NFL World Championship. Two years later, the game's name was changed to the Super Bowl.|$|E
500|$|Auburn University {{running back}} Bo Jackson was {{selected}} with the Buccaneers' first overall {{pick in the}} draft, but refused to sign with them. Jackson was angry with the Buccaneers after accepting a private jet ride to attend a team workout caused him to lose his eligibility to play baseball at Auburn. Although NCAA rules allow a professional athlete to compete collegiately in a different sport, stricter Southeastern Conference rules disqualify a professional athlete from competing in any college sports. Jackson accused the Buccaneers of sabotaging his college baseball career, although Phil Krueger insisted that the SEC had advised them that the flight was allowable, {{and that it was}} Jackson himself who had insisted on using a private flight. Jackson had been rated as the best running back prospect to come out of college since O.J. Simpson 17 years earlier. Jackson was said to have ridiculed Tampa Bay's offensive line, and shortly before the baseball draft to have told two teams that {{he had no intention of}} playing football. Most teams did not believe him, but the Kansas City Royals, although they were unsure enough that they waited until the fourth round of the Major League Baseball Draft to select him. [...] Jackson vowed never to play football again and accepted an offer from the Royals worth much less than what the Buccaneers offered. The Buccaneers turned down several impressive trade offers for Jackson, including the San Francisco 49ers' offer of Ronnie Lott, Wendell Tyler, and first- and second-round draft picks. Jackson's statements about not playing football were contradictory, as he alternated between stating he didn't want to play at all and between saying he didn't want to play for a terrible team and organization like Tampa Bay. In his book, Jackson recalls a meeting with <b>Al</b> <b>Davis</b> where he said he liked Davis and told the Raider boss he would love to play for them, and that the Raiders made offers for the #1 pick to Tampa Bay that were spurned.|$|E
