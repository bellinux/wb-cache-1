50|$|Concerns {{about the}} work {{environment}} quality of nail salons can be discussed in conversations about Occupational safety and health, as {{there is some evidence}} that suggest nail salon workers are subjected to potentially unjust, hazardous working conditions. Occupational safety and health concerns is a component of environmental justice. In surveys conducted of Vietnamese-American nail salon workers, many responses suggest that the work environment may be setting the space for negative health consequences. According to Standard 62-1989: Ventilation for Acceptable Indoor Quality of the American Society for Heating, Refrigeration, Air Condiitoning Engineers, adequate supply of outdoor air should be about 20 cubic feet per minute per occupant. This necessitates multiple pathways for air to enter and exit the room. Such pathways include, but are not limited to windows and doors. However, the study showed that one-third of the surveyed shops had only one single door for ventilation with no secondary <b>air</b> <b>pathway.</b>|$|E
50|$|In mammals the cues for hearing {{are usually}} based on inter-aural {{intensity}} differences, which {{occur as a}} result of the diffraction of a progressive sound wave by the head and pinna. They could also be based on inter-aural time differences that are present because of the distance between their two ears. Moles have no pinnae so they are thought to hear at low frequencies. In addition to this, their inner ear is unusual for that of a mammal due to the large trabeculation of the posterior ventral skull between the ears. The tympana of the ear lies almost horizontally and the manubrial tips are separated by a distance of 8 mm. The results of several studies confirm that there is good transmission through the European mole's head for a range of low frequencies. Because of this it is expected that there will be acoustic interaction at each tympanic membrane. The results of the study also suggest that the ears of this mole act as balanced pressure-difference receivers. This system has never been suggested for a mammal in the past, but reptiles, amphibia, birds, and crickets have been shown to have a direct <b>air</b> <b>pathway</b> between the tympana.|$|E
50|$|The M17 Protective Mask is {{a series}} of gas masks that were {{designed}} and produced in 1959 (as a replacement of the M-9 gas mask) to provide protection from all types of known chemical and biological agents present. The M-17 was issued to troops in the Vietnam war, and was standard issue for the U.S. Military until it was replaced by the M40 Field Protective Mask for the U.S. Army and USMC in the mid 1990s while the U.S. Navy and U.S. Air Force replaced it for the MCU-2/P Gas Mask. The mask has different components including a filter, a face piece and outserts. Filter elements in the face piece prevent harmful agents from entering the mask. The M17 series includes three types of masks, the M17, M17A1 and M17A2. An experimental transparent-silicone model called the XM27 was designed in late 1966, but was turned down in favor of the XM28E4. Many countries have copied the M17 design. Notable copies include the Bulgarian PDE-1, Japanese Type-3, the Polish Mp-4 and the Czech OM10 or M10M.These protective masks have inbuilt voice emitter systems that facilitate communication, a tube for drinking water from the M1 canteen cap (A1 & A2), and a pair of outserts to protect eye lenses and an <b>air</b> <b>pathway</b> that reduced fogging. The mask is packed in a carrier that also contains other items like a nerve agent antidote kit (NAAK), a convulsive antidote for nerve agents (CANA) and an M-258A1 decontamination kit. It also contains a M1 waterproof bag to protect filter elements from water damage. Other components attached are mask hoods to protect the head and neck area, a winterization kit to prevent frost accumulation during cold weather conditions and optical inserts for soldiers with vision defects.The M17A1 was designed with intent to allow a masked soldier to provide artificial respiration to an unmasked casualty, the resuscitation tube was a noble idea gone wrong. The problem with it being the exposure of both soldiers to contamination, the soldier giving aid ran the risk of encountering resistance from the airway of the casualty, pushing air back into his mask and breaking the seal on it. The casualty would remain unmasked, and would continue absorbing the contaminated environment. It was for this reason that the resuscitation tube system was no longer issued for the A1 and was dropped on the M17A2.|$|E

40|$|This Performance Assessment for the Savannah River Site E-Area Low-Level Waste Facility was {{prepared}} to meet requirements of Chapter IV of the Department of Energy Order 435. 1 - 1. The Order specifies that a Performance Assessment should provide reasonable assurance that a low-level waste disposal facility will comply with the performance objectives of the Order. The Order also requires assessments of impacts to water resources and to hypothetical inadvertent intruders for purposes of establishing limits on radionuclides that may be disposed near-surface. According to the Order, calculations of potential doses and releases from the facility should address a 1, 000 -year period after facility closure. The point of compliance for the performance measures relevant to the all pathways and <b>air</b> <b>pathway</b> performance objective, {{as well as to}} the impact on water resources assessment requirement, must correspond to the point of highest projected dose or concentration beyond a 100 -m buffer zone surrounding the disposed waste following the assumed end of active institutional controls 100 years after facility closure. During the operational and institutional control periods, the point of compliance for the all pathways and <b>air</b> <b>pathway</b> performance measures is the SRS boundary. However, for the water resources impact assessment, the point of compliance remains the point of highest projected dose or concentration beyond a 100 -m buffer zone surrounding the disposed waste during the operational and institutional control periods. For performance measures relevant to radon and inadvertent intruders, the points of compliance are the disposal facility surface for all time periods and the disposal facility after the assumed loss of active institutional controls 100 years after facility closure, respectively. The E-Area Low-Level Waste Facility is located in the central region of the SRS known as the General Separations Area. It is an elbow-shaped, cleared area, which curves to the northwest, situated immediately north of the Mixed Waste Management Facility. The E-Area Low-Level Waste Facility is comprised of 200 acres for waste disposal and a surrounding buffer zone that extends out to the 100 -m point of compliance. Disposal units within the footprint of the low-level waste facilities include the Slit Trenches, Engineered Trenches, Component-in-Grout Trenches, the Low-Activity Waste Vault, the Intermediate-Level Vault, and the Naval Reactor Component Disposal Area. Radiological waste disposal operations at the E-Area Low-Level Waste Facility began in 1994. E-Area Low-Level Waste Facility closure will be conducted in three phases: operational closure, interim closure, and final closure. Operational closure will be conducted during the 25 -year operation period (30 -year period for Slit and Engineered Trenches) as disposal units are filled; interim closure measures will be taken for some units. Interim closure will take place following the end of operations and will consist of an area-wide runoff cover along with additional grading over the trench units. Final closure of all disposal units in the E-Area Low-Level Waste Facility will take place at the end of the 100 -year institutional control period and will consist of the installation of an integrated closure system designed to minimize moisture contact with the waste and to serve as a deterrent to intruders. Radiological dose to human receptors is analyzed in this PA in the all-pathways analysis, the inadvertent intruder analysis and the <b>air</b> <b>pathway</b> analysis, and the results are compared to the relevant performance measures. For the all-pathways analysis, the performance measure of relevance is a 25 -mrem/yr EDE to representative members of the public, excluding dose from radon and its progeny in air. For the inadvertent intruder, the applicable performance measures are 100 -mrem/yr EDE and 500 mrem/yr EDE for chronic and exposure scenarios, respectively. The relevant performance measure for the <b>air</b> <b>pathway</b> is 10 -mrem/yr EDE via the <b>air</b> <b>pathway,</b> excluding dose from radon and its progeny in air. Protection of groundwater resources is addressed by comparing calculated compliance point concentrations in groundwater with the relevant performance measure, which was determined to be the Safe Drinking Water Act MCLs for beta-gamma and alpha-emitting radionuclides, and for radium and uranium. Radon fluxes for each disposal unit are calculated and compared to the average flux of 20 pCi/m{sup 2 }/s upper limit specified in the relevant performance objective. Thirty-five parent radionuclides are addressed in the groundwater transport calculations, 15 radionuclides in the <b>air</b> <b>pathway</b> calculations, and 78 parent radionuclides in the intruder analysis for all disposal units.

Researchers from the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium and the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) have visualized {{them for the first}} time, therefore proving their hypothesized existence. In apples, the pathways appear as irregular cavities between cells, whilst in pears they have the shape of tiny interconnected channels. These results allow {{a better understanding of how}} the fruit degrades after harvest and provide a scientific explanation of the everyday experience that pears are more susceptible to decay during storage. Apples and pears continue to “breathe ” after picking. To keep the fruit healthy, a minimum level of oxygen must be supplied to all cells of the fruit. If this does not happen, internal browning disorders appear and fruit quality decreases. This is why fruit is stored in dedicated cool rooms with accurate control of oxygen levels.

The GSA {{contains}} the F and H Area Separations Facilities, the S-Area Defense Waste Processing Facility, the Z-Area Saltstone Facility, and the E-Area Low-Level Waste Disposal Facilities. The FTF is a nearly rectangular shaped area and comprises approximately 20 acres, which is bounded by SRS coordinates N 76, 604. 5 to N 77, 560. 0 and E 52, 435. 0 to E 53, 369. 0. SRS {{is in the process}} of preparing a Performance Assessment (PA) to support FTF closure. As part of the PA process, an analysis was conducted to evaluate the potential magnitude of gaseous release of radionuclides from the FTF over the 100 -year institutional control period and 10, 000 -year post-closure compliance period. Specifically, an air and radon pathways analysis has been conducted to estimate the flux of volatile radionuclides and radon at the ground surface due to residual waste remaining in the tanks following closure. This analysis was used as the basis to estimate the dose to the maximally exposed individual (MEI) for the <b>air</b> <b>pathway</b> per Curie (Ci) of each radionuclide remaining in the combined FTF waste tanks. For the <b>air</b> <b>pathway</b> analysis, several gaseous radionuclides were considered. These included carbon- 14 (C- 14), chlorine- 36 (Cl- 36), iodine- 129 (I- 129), selenium- 79 (Se- 79), antimony- 125 (Sb- 125), tin- 126 (Sn- 126), tritium (H- 3), and technetium- 99 (Tc- 99).

The following changes have been implemented since the last baseline model, Version 4. 105 : (1) Updated the inventory and disposal unit configurations with data {{through the end of}} FY 2010. (1) Implemented Federal Guidance Report 13 Supplemental CD dose conversion factors (U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1999). Version 4. 110 PA results comply with <b>air</b> <b>pathway</b> and all-pathways annual total effective dose (TED) performance objectives (Tables 2 and 3, Figures 1 and 2). Air pathways results decrease moderately for all scenarios. The time of the maximum for the <b>air</b> <b>pathway</b> open rangeland scenario shifts from 1, 000 to 100 years (y). All-pathways annual TED increases for all scenarios except the resident scenario. The maximum member of public all-pathways dose occurs at 1, 000 y for the resident farmer scenario. The resident farmer dose was predominantly due to technetium- 99 (Tc- 99) (82 percent) and lead- 210 (Pb- 210) (13 percent). Pb- 210 present at 1, 000 y is produced predominantly by radioactive decay of uranium- 234 (U- 234) present at the time of disposal. All results for the postdrilling and intruder-agriculture scenarios comply with the performance objectives (Tables 4 and 5, Figures 3 and 4). The postdrilling intruder results are similar to Version 4. 105 results. The intruder-agriculture results are similar to Version 4. 105, except for the Pit 6 Radium Disposal Unit (RaDU). The intruder-agriculture result for the Shallow Land Burial (SLB) disposal units is a significant fraction of the performance objective and exceeds the performance objective at the 95 th percentile. The intruder-agriculture dose is due predominantly to Tc- 99 (75 percent) and U- 238 (9. 5 percent). The acute intruder scenario results comply with all performance objectives (Tables 6 and 7, Figures 5 and 6). The acute construction result for the SLB disposal units decreases significantly with this version.

The most important changes are implementation of a 1, 000 year time for compliance, rather than 10, 000 years, and consideration of additional radon precursors. Other revisions include refinement of the aquifer mesh to more accurately model the footprint of two intermediate level (IL) vaults, a new Pu chemistry model accounting for the different transport properties of oxidation states III/IV and V/VI, and implementation of a timed sum-of-fractions approach to setting limits. A significant decrease in the groundwater pathway limits for I- 129 was speculated in the FY 2003 interim measures assessment, in response to refinement of the aquifer mesh and source node definition. In fact, the new limits for these nuclides are only slightly lower.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedOver {{the past few}} decades, advances in aeronautic and control technologies have established a new vision for future air transportation systems. NASA has initiated the motion with several programs supporting the "highway of the sky," a system of launch pads and <b>air</b> <b>pathways</b> enabling smaller and more easily piloted aircraft to travel the open space above instead of busy freeways and crowded city streets. Previous investigations into crossflow fan technology as a propulsion source have identified its potential for use in personal aircraft and vertical takeoff and landing applications. To further development, performance characteristics must be determined for the possible configurations and under variable conditions to understand factors critical to design. This experiment studied flow characteristics of a crossflow fan incorporating 30 blades of six inch length in a six inch diameter rotor. Comparison was made against {{the performance of a}} fan of similar design but one-fourth the length span previously tested. Results were plotted for various parameters along constant speed lines of operation and general trends were determined. These results were used to quantitatively deduce scaling relationships for this device. US Navy (USN) author...|$|R
40|$|Results from {{a chamber}} study to {{characterize}} emissions from combustion of selected pure energetic materials {{are presented in}} this paper. The study was carried out {{as a part of}} a comprehensive <b>air</b> <b>pathways</b> risk assessment for a propellant and explosive manufacturing facility that engages in open burning methods for manufacturing waste disposal. Materials selected for emissions characterization in this study included both aluminized and non-aluminized composite propellant, a double base propellant and a plastic bonded explosive. Combustion tests in a specialized chamber revealed very low emissions for gaseous products of incomplete combustion such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides. Analysis of gaseous and aerosol emission products for a pre-selected target analyte list that included both volatile and semi-volatile organics revealed either low or non-detectable emissions for the four energetic types tested. Hydrogen chloride was detected as a major emission product from propellants containing ammonium perchlorate. Results from this work reveal that about one-half of the chlorine in the original material is released as hydrogen chloride. Based on earlier work, the balance of the chlorine emissions is expected to be in the form of chlorine gas...|$|R
40|$|Many {{millions}} of office workers {{are exposed to}} radon while at work and at home. Though {{there has been a}} multitude of studies reporting the measurements of radon concentrations and potential lung and effective doses associated with radon and progeny exposure in homes, similar studies on the concentrations and subsequent effective dose rates in the workplace are lacking. The purposes of this study were to measure radon concentrations in office and residential spaces in the same county and explore the radiation dose implications. Sixty-five track-etch detectors were deployed in office spaces and 47 were deployed in residences, all within Los Alamos County, New Mexico, USA. The sampling periods for these measurements were generally about three months. The measured concentrations were then used to calculate and compare effective dose rates resulting from exposure while at work and at home. Results showed that full-time office workers receive on average about nine times greater exposure at home than while in the office (691 mrem yr{sup - 1 } versus 78 mrem yr{sup - 1 }). The estimated effective dose rate for a more homebound person was 896 mrem yr{sup - 1 }. These effective dose rates are contrasted against the 100 mrem yr{sup - 1 } threshold for regulation of a 'radiological worker' defined in the Department of Energy regulations occupational exposure and the 10 mrem yr{sup - 1 } <b>air</b> <b>pathway</b> effective public dose limit regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency...|$|E
40|$|An {{improved}} air amplifier {{design that}} {{takes advantage of}} the combined effects of aerodynamic and electrodynamic focusing was developed to couple a nanoelectrospray ionisation (nano-ESI) source and the heated mass spectrometer inlet to improve the sensitivity of a mass spectrometer. The new design comprises an electrodynamic ion funnel integrated into the main <b>air</b> <b>pathway</b> of the air amplifier to more effectively focus and transmit gas-phase ions from the nano-ESI source into the heated mass spectrometer inlet. Numerical computational fluid dynamics simulations were carried out using a commercial software package, ANSYS FLUENT, to provide more detailed information about the device's performance. The gas flow field as well as the electric field patterns and the Lagrangian ion motion were conveniently simulated using this single package and custom-written, user-defined functions. Experimental results show a nearly five-fold improvement in reserpine ion intensity with the air amplifier operated at a nitrogen gauge pressure of 40 kPa and no direct current (DC) or radiofrequency (RF) potentials applied to the ion funnel when the distance between the electrospray emitter and sampling inlet tube was 24 mm, as compared to direct sample infusion from the same distance without the air amplifier. More importantly, a nearly three-fold additional gain in ion intensity was measured when both DC and RF potentials were co-applied, resulting in more than a 13 -fold overall ion intensity gain which could be attributed to the combined air amplifier aerodynamic and ion funnel electrodynamic focusing effect...|$|E
40|$|During 1996, {{atmospheric}} {{releases of}} tritium from the Savannah River Site (SRS) were dramatically {{less than in}} 1995. The total amount of atmospheric tritium released during 1996 was 55, 300 curies, which was 43 % less than the total of 96, 700 curies. Of the total tritium released, 40, 100 curies were tritium oxide, this was 27 % less than the 1995 atmospheric tritium oxide release total of 55, 000 curies. Releases of radioactive liquid effluents from SRS decreased during 1996. Liquid releases of tritium (which constitutes more than 99 % of the total radioactivity released to the Savannah River) in 1996 (8, 950 curies) were about 21 % less than during 1995 (11, 400 curies). In 1996, the potential dose to the maximally exposed individual from SRS atmospheric releases {{was estimated to be}} 0. 05 mrem, 0. 5 % of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and US Department of Energy (DOE) <b>air</b> <b>pathway</b> dose standard of 10 mrem/year. The 80 -kilometer-radius population of 620, 100 people potentially received a collective dose of 2. 8 person-rem from SRS atmospheric radioactive releases. The 1996 collective dose was about 20 % lower than the 1995 collective dose of 3. 5 person-rem. The potential dose to the maximally exposed individual from 1996 SRS liquid radioactive releases was estimated to be 0. 14 mrem, 0. 14 % of the DOE all-pathway dose standard of 100 mrem/year. The collective dose from SRS liquid releases during 1996 was estimated at 2. 2 person-rem. The major exposure pathway to the population was drinking water, with tritium accounting for more than 70 % of the total collective dose...|$|E

40|$|Farmworkers {{and their}} {{families}} may experience increased levels of agricultural pesticides in their homes due to both (1) take-home/soil track-in on shoes, clothes and skin, and (2) air infiltration from nearby agriculture fields via agricultural pesticide drift in the vapor phase or adhered to resuspended soil particles. This dissertation estimates the relative contributions o the take-home/soil track-in and <b>air</b> infiltration <b>pathways</b> of agricultural pesticides into homes, as well as identifies the risk factors for increased in-home agricultural pesticide levels for farmworkers {{and their families}} living near agriculture fields. Samples of outdoor air, yard soil, and house dust from 21 farmworkers' homes in Yuma County, Arizona were collected and analyzed for a suite of agricultural pesticides. To capture household information, such as behaviors, demographics, and housing structure, a participant questionnaire was administered {{at the time of}} the sampling. A pesticide transport model was developed, evaluated, and applied to quantify relative contributions of the air infiltration and the take-home/soil track-in pathways of agricultural pesticides into the house dust of the farmworkers' homes. To explore a wide-range of potential risk factors for increased agricultural pesticide levels in the homes, traditional statistical methods and Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analyses were used. The results of this study, found that the <b>air</b> infiltration <b>pathway</b> contributes to over 90 % of some agricultural pesticides in the house dust found in the farmworkers' homes. In addition, among the influential risk factors for increased in-home agricultural pesticide levels was the home being a closer distance to an agricultural field, as well as the home having carpeted floors, more farmworkers per square footage of the home, and less months of heating and cooling the home. It is suggested that future intervention efforts to reduce in-home agricultural pesticide levels put more emphasis on targeting the <b>air</b> infiltration <b>pathway,</b> and take into consideration relevant risk factors for increased pesticide levels in the home...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Evaporative cooling systems using {{relatively}} expensive cellulosic paper pads {{are widely}} used in residential, commercial, and agricultural buildings in Saudi Arabia. However, the fast minerals and dust build up shorten the useful life of theses pads. This article describes design and performance of new alternative non-cellulosic evaporative cooling pads made from galvanized metal sheets. Pad media and top water distribution bath arrangement in the new design differ from other commercially existing evaporative cooling systems. The sheets aligned vertically in a zigzag shape and {{the gap between the}} sheets is around 7. 5 mm. Water drips from the top distribution bath over the pads through small holes. Outside air is cooled by evaporating water droplets and moisture retained at the surface of the wetted sheets in the zigzagged <b>air</b> <b>pathways.</b> Performance of three pad’s depths (0. 15, 0. 30, and 0. 45 m) was tested. Each test lasted 24 hours, and dry-bulb temperature and relative humidity of outside and conditioned air and reservoir’s water temperatures were scanned and recorded every ten seconds. At the peak outside air dry-bulb temperatures, the averaged cooling efficiencies (η) at the pad depths of 0. 15, 0. 30, and 0. 45 m were 76, 86, and 88 %, respectively...|$|R
