With C. A. Rosetti and Brătianu, he supported the transit of Russian troops and persuaded Carol to accept the Russian alliance, contrary to the initial advice of the Crown Council. He also sought advice on this matter from the French Third Republic, who was {{still one of the}} powers supervising Romania; Louis, duc Decazes, the French Foreign Minister, declined to give him <b>a</b> <b>reassuring</b> answer, and pointed that, were Romania to join up with Russia, the other powers would cease offering their protection. Making note of this, Kogălniceanu expressed his hope that France would still support his country at the decisive moment.|$|E

25|$|On {{the evening}} of 22 September, Jones in Bonhomme Richard (an armed East India trading vessel he had reluctantly adapted for {{military}} use), accompanied by the little brigantine Vengeance, had been off Spurn Head, hoping to catch a few prizes emerging from the Humber estuary, but he decided to head northward during the hours of darkness, and rendezvous with his frigates Alliance and Pallas, which had parted company from him further up the coast. Shortly after midnight, two vessels were seen, so signal lanterns were set. The strangers did not give the response that would identify them as members of his squadron. Jones’s crew was called to quarters, but when daylight approached, about 5:30am, and a chequered flag was hoisted on the mizzen mast, the mystery vessels finally identified themselves as the Alliance and Pallas. Captain Cottineau of the Pallas (in full, Denis Nicolas Cottineau de Kerloguen) later reported that Captain Pierre Landais of the Alliance had advised a rapid retreat if the approaching warship proved to be British—not <b>a</b> <b>reassuring</b> suggestion, given that his frigate, which had been acclaimed as the best warship yet made in America, was by a fair margin the faster and more manoeuvrable of the two.|$|E

[...] Chicago Tribune critic Michael Phillips wrote that [...] "as two-hour tours go, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel goes smoothly." [...] While he felt that the film focused on [...] "pleasantly {{predictable}} story", he noted that the project was one of those films which [...] "are better off concentrating on <b>a</b> <b>reassuring</b> level of actorly craft [...] going easy on the surprises." ...|$|E
500|$|The final {{episode of}} Temperatures Rising aired on August 29, 1974. The attempt to {{resuscitate}} {{the series was}} unsuccessful, and ABC finally cancelled it permanently. Andy Siegel, a comedy development executive for ABC at the time, felt the series failed because audiences {{did not want to}} watch a show displaying inadequate medical care, even though it was done in a humorous fashion. In reminiscing about the series he stated: [...] "When people see doctors on television they really want to feel that they're in good hands. That no matter what happens it is <b>a</b> <b>reassuring</b> experience." [...] William Asher, in a 2000 interview, summed up the demise of the series by saying: [...] "It didn't get on. It's too late. You can't do that to an audience. They won't accept it." ...|$|E

Author Ian Inglis views [...] "I'd Have You Anytime" [...] as working as a straightforward love song, with Harrison's [...] "Let me into your heart" [...] serving as [...] "not a desperate plea but <b>a</b> <b>reassuring</b> conversation", and Dylan's [...] "All I have is yours / All you see is mine" [...] providing the same [...] "element of reciprocity that distinguished the declaration of love" [...] in Harrison's song [...] "Something".|$|E

500|$|These novels used {{standard}} {{characters and}} plot. The mounted policeman was, as Dawson describes, an Anglo-Saxon, [...] "chivalric, self-abnegating hero", who would pursue his suspect – typically a foreigner or French-Canadian – across a hostile landscape, often overcoming them bloodlessly. The stories championed what the historian Andrew Graybill describes as [...] "Victorian manliness", with the narrative focusing on [...] "romance, manners and {{the preservation of}} justice through fair play". Within the genre, some national differences emerged. British writers often portrayed the police as upper-class colonial soldiers, carrying out their duty in serving the British Empire {{on the fringes of}} civilisation. Canadian novels embraced much of this imperial narrative, but also depicted the force as a protector of wider moral authority and order, forming <b>a</b> <b>reassuring,</b> conservative image in the face of contemporary fears of immigrants and social instability. In contrast, authors in the United States usually reused familiar Western plot-lines, but using Canadian characters and scenery.|$|E
500|$|Despite being {{popular with}} many, the {{character}} of Ruth has also gained much criticism over the years. In 2007, Karen Price from the Western Mail called Ruth a [...] "much-loved character" [...] and The Scotsman's Fordyce Maxwell called Ruth [...] "the archetype of common sense and forward planning". Victoria Summerley from The Independent noted the character was [...] "instantly recognisable" [...] {{because she is a}} Geordie and bemoaned the fact [...] "poor inoffensive Ruth" [...] was disliked by some of the more hardcore fans because of this. Nicholas Lezard from the same publication disliked Ruth, branding her [...] "highly irritating". He later thought the scriptwriters had created in David and Ruth [...] "the only couple in the Western Hemisphere who are delighted that their parents are coming for Christmas." [...] Ruth and David were described by The Times critic, Tim Teeman, as [...] "the series' golden couple — the future Phil and Jill". While The Herald's Anne Simpson said the couple were [...] "the standing stones of Ambridge: rooted, solid, weathered by storms but unbeaten, <b>a</b> <b>reassuring</b> constant in our national life." ...|$|E
500|$|The British steel {{industry}} was protected from more efficient foreign competition by the government's high tariff wall. The BISF, through its control of pricing, could also present {{a united front}} against new competition at home. When the feasibility report was received by the BISF in March 1935 [...] the Federation's chairman, Sir Andrew Duncan, at first reacted positively; his members from the north-east were rather less enthusiastic. Only {{one of the large}} steel firms in the region, the Consett Iron Company, offered support for a Jarrow steelworks, while other BISF members put pressure on London's financial institutions to withhold capital from the new scheme. Reports of such tactics caused great anxiety in the Jarrow area, where the people were desperate for the new works to come about. In <b>a</b> <b>reassuring</b> speech shortly before the November 1935 general election, Baldwin, now leading the National Government, informed his listeners in Newcastle: [...] "There is no truth in any of the reports that either the banks or any other authorities... are making a dead set to prevent anything of the kind being done in the area".|$|E

500|$|At the 2004 Summer Olympics Opening Ceremony, where Björk premiered the song, {{she wore}} a very large dress which {{unfolded}} during her performance of [...] "Oceania" [...] to eventually occupy the entire stadium, and showed {{a map of the}} world in sign of union. Additionally, Björk wore [...] "bluish-purple glittery eye shadow across her lids. Her dark hair dangled in tiny twists that framed her pixieish, freckled face". Immediately after the performance at the Olympics opening ceremony, the song was downloaded more than 11,000 times on the iTunes Store. Jake Coyle from Today commented that her dress was [...] "reminiscent in its uniqueness to the infamous swan dress she wore to the Oscars in 2001". According to Jeremy D. Larson from Time, if it weren't for the fireworks {{at the end of the}} song, he was legitimately unsure if people in the audience would have cheered. Dominique Leone of Pitchfork was surprised by the committee's choice of bringing Björk to perform at the ceremony, and stated: [...] "They could have had anyone-- say, <b>a</b> <b>reassuring</b> Celine Dion or a physically ideal Beyoncé-- but they chose a prickly, decidedly uncomfortable Icelandic woman. On aesthetic grounds, I can't argue with their choice, but I continue to wonder about Björk's significance". [...] "Oceania" [...] was also performed during the Volta Tour (2007–08).|$|E
500|$|... "It's Not Up to You" [...] {{has been}} {{described}} as a [...] "dizzying ballad" [...] and a song that lifts the album upward. Michael Paoletta of Billboard described the track as [...] "melancholy". Its lyrics are about [...] "love for the unknown devices that culminate in 'perfect days'", and [...] "pleas to find beauty in unlikely places". The [...] "caressing lyrics" [...] of [...] "Undo" [...] assure that: [...] "It's not meant to be a strife/It's not meant to be a struggle uphill". Biographer Mark Pytlik writes, [...] "Undo" [...] is a held hand, <b>a</b> <b>reassuring</b> reminder that anything can happen once you let it. If you are in pain, undo it, Björk suggests, no hint of disingenuousness in her voice, over climbing strings and a rising choir". [...] "Pagan Poetry" [...] is a [...] "harp-splashed" [...] song that concerns unrequited love. The track builds slowly, [...] "with Björk wailing over swelling keyboard crescendos," [...] until, at the four-minute mark, [...] "all the music drops away, leaving Björk utterly exposed" [...] as she sings [...] "I love him, I love him/I love him, I love him/I love him, I love him". The song also features [...] "a flotilla of music boxes with an Asian-teahouse touch." [...] The instrumental interlude [...] "Frosti" [...] {{has been described}} as a [...] "metallic tundra". Its sound stems from a music box, creating an intimate, fairy tale-like effect.|$|E
500|$|Life Is People is a singer-songwriter {{album that}} {{contains}} twelve tracks {{with a total}} running time of 58 minutes. Eleven tracks were written by Fay. The piano ballad [...] "Jesus, Etc." [...] is a cover version of a Wilco song originally written by Jay Bennett and Jeff Tweedy, which first appeared on their 2002 album Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. [...] "This World", which was described by Grayson Currin of Pitchfork Media {{as one of the}} album's key songs, features additional vocals from Tweedy that were recorded at the Loft studio in Chicago. Life Is Peoples lyrics were described by Thom Jurek as [...] "bittersweet reflections on wasted life, loss, death, grief, environmental apocalypse, and human frailty ... balanced by themes that affirm tolerance, healing, love, and spiritual redemption." [...] Currin described the songs as [...] "pleas for redemption in a world drunk on its promise, coupled with <b>a</b> <b>reassuring</b> contentment for simply having lived this life." [...] The song [...] "City of Dreams", the lyrics of which refer to a street sweeper, was written by Fay 15 years before it was recorded. The album's title is derived from the song [...] "Cosmic Concerto (Life Is People)", which refers to a comment made to Fay by his father while they were observing passers-by during a childhood visit to the seaside. [...] "Be at Peace With Yourself", which begins with [...] "liturgical" [...] organ and piano, features a gospel choir and was described as the album's [...] "centerpiece".|$|E

Furthermore, he benefited from divisions in the right-wing majority. He obtained 25.85% of votes in the first round (against 15% for the PCF candidate Georges Marchais), then defeated President Giscard d'Estaing in the second round, with 51.76%. He became the first left-wing politician elected President of France by universal suffrage.|$|E

The accident also caused him to make a change in his driving style that later paid dividends: his tendency to use his brakes more sparingly than his rivals meant that they lasted longer, especially in endurance races. Gurney was known to give the brake pedal <b>a</b> <b>reassuring</b> tap just before hard application — a habit Gurney himself jokingly referred to as [...] "the chicken-shit school of braking." ...|$|E

Commanding general Christopher von Stoffeln coerced army doctors to conceal the outbreak, which was not made public until Gustav Orreus, a Russian-Finnish surgeon reporting directly to Field Marshal Pyotr Rumyantsev, examined the situation, identified it as plague and enforced quarantine in the troops. Shtoffeln, however, refused to evacuate the infested towns and himself fell victim to the plague in May 1770. Of 1,500 patients recorded in his troops in May–August 1770, only 300 survived.|$|E
