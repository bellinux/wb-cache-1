30|$|All {{over the}} world, road {{congestion}} {{is among the}} most prevalent transport challenges usually in urban environments which not only increases fuel consumption and emission of harmful gases, but also causes stress for the drivers. Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) enables a better use of the infrastructure by connecting vehicles to other vehicles as well as infrastructure and thus delivers a faster communication opportunity to ensure safe and secure driving. Machine-to-machine (M 2 M) communication is one of the latest information and communication technologies which offers ubiquitous connectivity among several smart devices. The use of mobile (cellular) M 2 M communications has emerged due to the wide range, high reliability, increased data rates, decreased costs as well as easy and short-term deployment opportunities. Since the radio spectrum is a scarce resource, M 2 M traffic can potentially degrade the performance of mobile networks due to the large number of devices sending small-sized data. This paper presents <b>an</b> efficient <b>data</b> <b>multiplexing</b> scheme by using Long-Term Evolution Advanced (LTE-Advanced) Relay Nodes, which aggregates M 2 M traffic to maximize radio resource utilization.

Simulation results show that approximately 40  % more smart M 2 M devices used in ITS and logistics are served per LTE-Advanced cell under the present system settings.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In recent years, {{the ever}} growing need for higher {{capacity}} in wireless systems has fueled {{the interest in}} exploiting the spatial dimension—through the use of antennas arrays—to improve the utilization of the available radio spectrum. As a result, {{a large number of}} space–time techniques have been proposed wherein arrays are used to mitigate interference and enhance signal levels. More recently, information theory has shown that, with spatial <b>data</b> <b>multiplexing,</b> very large spectral efficiencies can be attained in multipath channels using transmit and receive antenna arrays. In this paper, the system benefit of using transmit and receive arrays in multicell scenarios is evaluated as a function of both the propagation environment and the number of antennas. Our results confirm the potential for very large system spectral efficiencies {{associated with the use of}} transmit and receive arrays, in particular in interference-limited rich-multipath conditions wherein the ability to perform interference mitigation—leading to tighter spectral reuse—and spatial <b>data</b> <b>multiplexing</b> grows with the number of antennas.
