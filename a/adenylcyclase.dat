40|$|A {{possible}} {{role for}} <b>adenylcyclase</b> in insulin secretion was investigated. Isoproterenol, a predominantly β-adrenergic agent, when mixed with an α-adrenergic blocking agent (phenoxybenzamine), stimulated insulin secretion from {{pieces of the}} rat's pancreas in vitro. Theophylline, caffeine, 3 ′ 5 ′-cyclic AMP, glucagon, adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), and thyrotropin (TSH), {{all of which are}} thought to act through the <b>adenylcyclase</b> systems in the liver and adipose tissue, also stimulated insulin secretion in vitro; oxytocin and vasopressin, which do not stimulate lipolysis in adipose tissue, were inactive. In all cases, stimulation of insulin secretion could not be detected when glucose was absent or present in only low concentrations (less than 100 mg/ 100 ml) and was maximal at high levels of glucose (300 mg/ 100 ml). When pancreatic tissue was obtained from normoglycemic rats and contained no detectable glycogen in the Islets, the stimulant effects of glucose and of theophylline were reduced or abolished by mannoheptulose and 2 -deoxyglucose. When tissue was derived from rats infused for 8 - 10 hr with glucose and contained glycogen, theophylline, {{even in the absence of}} glucose, stimulated secretion and this effect was reduced by 2 -deoxyglucose but not by mannoheptulose. It is suggested that the β-cell contains an <b>adenylcyclase</b> system through which phosphorylase and possibly phosphofructokinase could be activated; and that insulin secretion could depend upon and be regulated by hormones and other substances which influence the rate at which glycolysis proceeds within the β-cell...|$|E

40|$|Autorhythmic contractions of {{the rabbit}} {{testicular}} capsule were measured in vivo and in vitro in preparations from animals 2 to 18 weeks of age. The {{response of the}} testicular preparations to prostaghandin (PG) F, PGE 1, Epinephrine, and Acetylcholine (ACH) was determined and log dose-response curves plotted. The data indicate that spontaneous autorhythmic contractions occur in vivo and in vitro throughout postnatal development, that the amplitude of the contractions in-creases while {{the mass of the}} testis and the thickness of the testicular capsule increases, and that the relative response to PGF 2 a, epinephrine and ACH remains constant throughout postnatal de-velopment. However, the response of the testicular capsule to PGE 1 became progressively more in-hibitory at higher concentrations throughout postnatal development, which may be indicative of the development of <b>adenylcyclase</b> activity within the testicular tissues...|$|E
40|$|We have {{measured}} {{the changes in}} C 2 production and in cyclic nucleotide levels in mononuclear leucocytes cultured {{in the presence of}} agents which change intracellular cAMP. <b>Adenylcyclase</b> activators, cholera toxin and phosphodiesterase inhibitors increased cAMP levels and reduced C 2 production. Imidazole, hydrocortisone and prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors reduced cAMP and increased C 2 synthesis. The level of cAMP after 2 hr incubation showed an inverse correlation with C 2 levels in the culture supernatants. When histamine, which increases cAMP and reduces C 2 production, and imidazole, which reduces cAMP and increases C 2 synthesis, were added together, levels of cAMP and C 2 did not differ significantly from those found in control cultures. On the basis of these observations we have concluded that changes in monocyte cAMP alter the production of C 2...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} the metabolism of arachidonic acid in normal skin-derived fibroblasts (NF) {{as well as}} in keloid-derived fibroblasts (KF) in response to macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), a pluripotent cytokine. We found that MIF enhanced cyclooxygenase- 2 activity in NF more than in KF. Consistent with this finding, prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2), an antifibrogenic molecule, was more significantly increased in NF than in KF by MIF treatment. As regarding E prostanoid receptor 2, the level of expression was significantly lower in KF than in NF. On the other hand, Forskolin, a direct activator of <b>adenylcyclase,</b> decreased collagen synthesis in both NF and KF, which indicates that cAMP {{plays an important role in}} regulating collagen synthesis. As PGE 2 induces cAMP production, it is conceivable that increased collagen synthesis in KF might be owing to decreased PGE 2 and cAMP production. These findings may aid in the development of a therapeutic strategy for the regulation of collagen synthesis in keloid fibroblasts...|$|E

40|$|This paper reports {{synthesis}} and {{pharmacological properties}} of thienyl, pyrrol, indolyl and benzofuryl-O-(3 -alkylamine- 2 -hydroxypropyl) oximes and some 3 -(3 -alkylamine- 2 -hydroxypropyl) alkyloxy indoles aiming {{to study the}} influence of five membered and condensed heterocyclic substituents on the beta-adrenoreceptor inhibiting potency. All heterocyclic derivatives synthesized (1 - 17) were less active than the reference propranolol on the rat heart, while showed a comparable potency on the guinea pig trachea, exhibiting a significant beta 2 -selectivity. The low beta-blocking potency of the five membered derivatives seemed to confirm the negative influence of the polarization of the oximic carbon in the binding with non polar region of the beta-adrenoreceptor. Another important interaction could take place with the enzyme adenyl-cyclase which is responsible of the signal of transduction. It could be hypothesized that the heteroatom of the heterocyclic nucleus acted as an electron-donor group and engaged a coordinative bond with magnesium atom present on the <b>adenylcyclase</b> system, responsible of the agonist activity.

40|$|Intravenous {{infusion}} of adrenaline {{was performed in}} three healthy subjects on two occasions. In one case subjects performed a maximal isometric contraction before infusion. Biopsies {{were taken from the}} quadriceps femoris muscle before and after infusion for 0. 5 and 2 min, and analysed for muscle pH, cyclic AMP, metabolites and activities of glycogen phosphorylase and synthetase. Isometric contraction resulted in a decrease of muscle pH to 6. 60 (normal value at rest 7. 0 - 7. 1). By this experimental procedure the effect of adrenaline infusion could be studied on a muscle with normal pH and one with low pH. Cyclic AMP increased from 3 to about 9. 5 mumol per kg dry weight after 0. 5 min of adrenaline infusion. When isometric contraction preceded the infusion, cyclic AMP increased more slowly and was about 5. 5 mumol per kg dry weight after the same time of infusion. Phosphorylase a constituted about 22 % of total phosphorylase in resting muscle but increased rapidly to 80 % after 0. 5 min infusion. When exercise preceded infusion phosphorylase a decreased and was still lower after 2 min infusion. The results can be explained by inhibition of <b>adenylcyclase</b> and phosphorylase b kinase at low muscle pH...|$|E
40|$|Dopamine {{is known}} to play roles in the {{processing}} of emotion. To test whether dopamine has effects on synaptic plasticity in emotion-processing areas, I examined callosally-evoked field potentials in coronal slices of rat anterior cingulate cortex （ACC） when low-frequency stimulation （LFS ）was applied to corpus callosum as a conditioning stimulus. Neither dopamine nor the D_ 2 agonist, quinpirole, {{had a significant effect}} on synaptic plasticity, while the D_ 1 agonist, SKF- 38393, facilitated induction of long-term depression （LTD）. This facilitative effect of SKF- 38393 was completely blocked by the D_ 1 antagonist, SCH- 23390. LFS-induced LTD was not blocked by application of the metabotropic glutamatergic receptor antagonist, MCPG or the voltage-gated calcium channel blocker, nifedipine, but was blocked by application of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor （NMDAR） antagonist, APV. The facilitative effect of SKF- 38393 on LTD induction was not mimicked by forskolin, an <b>adenylcyclase</b> activator, but was partially mimicked by phorbol 12, 13 -didecanoate, which {{is known to}} activate the intracellular PKC pathway. These findings suggest that LTD in ACC is induced via NMDAR and facilitated by D_ 1 agonists at least in part via the PKC-related intracellular pathway.

The sensitivity derives from the liberation of fluorescein from an artificial substrate, fluorescein-di-β-galactopyranoside (FDβG). After incubation with 100 ng/ml of poly A:U, only 40 % of the cells previously showing antigen-binding were still active. The optimum range of activity lay between 0. 01 – 1. 0 µg/ml poly A:U. Such cells showed increased RNA and protein synthesis as indicated by [3 H]uridine and [14 C]amino acid incorporation. The polynucleotide effect was abolished by incubation of the cells with sodium azide or iodoacetate, but not by puromycin. When the proteins on the cell surface were labeled by 125 I, poly A:U caused their release into the medium. Reports by others that the enhancing effect of polynucleotides on the immune response involves the <b>adenylcyclase</b> system are consistent with the finding reported here that reduction of binding by dibutryl 5 '-cyclic monophosphoric acid (cAMP) and poly A:U were parallel in extent, and that theophylline and poly A:U acted synergistically in suboptimal concentrations of each...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{establish}} whether the age-related reduced growth hormone (GH) responsiveness to GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) could be improved by treatment with low amounts of theophylline, a drug mainly acting through cyclic adenosine 3 ', 5 '•monophosphate (cAMP), and calcium-mediated mechanisms, eight adult subjects (aged 20 - 37) and eight elderly men (aged 64 - 79) were tested with GHRH (50 |xg in an iv bolus), theophylline (1. 67 mglminfor 3 h), or the combination of both drugs. The GH response to GHRH was significantly lower in the older than in the younger group (mean peaks were 4. 5 and 7. 5 times higher than baseline, respectively). Theophylline did not change basal GH levels in any subjects and GHRH-induced GH rise in the younger group, whereas it restored normal GH responses to GHRH in the older subjects (mean peak responses were eight times higher than baseline in both groups). These data show that in elderly subjects the mechanism underlying the GHRH-induced GH secretion may be fully activated by GHRH during treatment with low amounts of theophylline. GROWTH hormone (GH) is under the stimulatory controlof hypothalamic GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) (1). In vitro experiments have shown that GHRH stimulates GH secretion by increasing <b>adenylcyclase</b> activity with conse-quent increase of intracellular cyclic adenosine 3 ', 5 '-monophosphate (cAMP) (2 - 6).

40|$|Separation of {{particulate}} matter in rabbit muscle extracts by differential centrifugation leads, in first approximation, to {{the isolation of}} fraction I (15, 000 to 41, 000 g) and fraction II (41, 000 to 150, 000 g). The former consists mainly of sarcotubular material, actively transporting calcium ions, and displaying relaxation factor activity. The latter is heterogeneous, shows little calcium accumulation, and contains factors both inhibiting and activating myofibrillar ATPase. Fraction I is resolved by density gradient centrifugation into 2 main subfractions. The lighter one represents sarcotubular material in the best state of preservation, with biochemical activities stable for weeks in the cold. The heavier one may consist of the same material in a less well preserved form. Upon aging, it develops an activating activity toward myofibrillar ATPase, when the relaxing effect has declined. Fraction II is resolved by density gradient centrifugation into 3 or more fractions, with some variability. Relaxing activity in terms of inhibition of myofibrillar ATPase predominates among the lighter subfractions, increase of ATPase among the heavier. The intrinsic ATPase of fraction II is activated by calcium ions, {{but there is little}} or no bulk accumulation of calcium oxalate. Nevertheless, its limited calcium uptake seems to suffice to explain its relaxing activity. The particulate material contains mucopolysaccharidc and lipid.

40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this study was to test the {{hypothesis}} that exposure to municipal effluents can disrupt the neuroendocrine system in Elliptio complanata freshwater mussels. The capacity of ozonation to mitigate these effects was also examined. Mussels were exposed for 14 days to a continuous flow of increasing concentrations of the effluent before and after ozonation. Neuroendocrinal effects were examined by tracking changes in acetylcholinesterase, glutamate, gamma-aminobutyrate, serotonin, dopamine and their respective <b>adenylcyclase</b> activities in synapse membranes, monoamine oxidase and vitellogenin-like proteins. Oxidative stress and damage were examined by superoxide dismutase and lipid peroxidation, respectively, in the visceral tissues. The results revealed that the exposure of freshwater mussels increased the levels of vitellogenin-like proteins in both the primary-treated and ozonated effluents, dopamine and glutamate, and decreased the turnover of the neurostimulant acetylcholine. Moreover, these endpoints were significantly correlated with oxidative stress and damage. A canonical analysis of the responses revealed that dopamine and the neuroexcitatory neuromediators [...] acetylcholesterase and glutamate [...] were the endpoints more strongly related with oxidative stress and damage. Mussel morphology and estrogenic biomarkers (vitellogenin-like proteins, gonad lipid stores) were also significantly related, albeit to a lesser extent, to oxidative stress and damage. In general, ozone treatment was not sufficient to mitigate the observed neuroendocrinal effects in freshwater mussels.

Many common genetic variants have been identified for obesity and body mass index (BMI), but they cumulatively explain very little of the variation in these phenotypes. To better understand the biological mechanisms involved in weight changes, this study aimed to characterize the metabolic pathways affecting BMI during childhood and adolescence. Longitudinal BMI profiles and DNA samples were collected from two biracial cohort studies, the Bogalusa Heart Study (BHS) and Project HeartBeat! (PHB). Up to 128, 141 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were analyzed for each race based on candidate gene genotyping using two microarrays. Multilevel models of individual SNP effects and SNP-by-age interactions were constructed for white and black participants aged 8 - 18 years. Effect estimates from each cohort were combined between each race using meta-analysis and analyzed at the gene and pathway levels. After sensitivity analysis of the identified pathways, four KEGG pathways were significantly associated with longitudinal BMI changes: calcium signaling, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, toxoplasmosis, and glutathione metabolism. Integration of the pathway results with previous findings revealed a complex interactive network connecting pathway functions regulating BMI of children and adolescents. These findings support a complex signaling dynamic between ghrelin, neuropeptide Y, epinephrine, norepinephrine, acetylcholine, and pituitary <b>adenylcyclase</b> involving calcium signaling, cAMP formation, and the insulin-glucagon control of glucose levels. FTO and leptin were found to be linked to these pathways through functional implications with the identified genes.

40|$|In Escherichia coli, the {{synthesis}} of the flagellar organelle is sensitive to catabolite repression. Synthesis requires {{the presence of the}} cyclic adenosine monophosphate receptor protein (Crp) and 3 ′, 5 ′-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP); i. e., mutants that lack Crp or <b>adenylcyclase</b> (Cya) synthesize no flagella. We isolated and characterized a series of mutants (cfs) that restored flagella-forming ability in a Crp strain of E. coli. The mutations in these strains were transferred onto episomes and they were then introduced into a variety of other strains. The presence of the mutation resulted in flagella synthesis in Cya and Crp strains {{as well as in the}} wild type grown under conditions of catabolite repression. Deletion analysis and other genetic studies indicated that: (i) the cfs mutations had a dominant effect when they were in the transconfiguration in merodiploids: (ii) they occurred in or very close to the flaI gene: and (iii) their expression required the presence of an intact flaI gene adjacent to the cfs mutation. Biochemical studies showed that {{the synthesis}} of at least two flagellar polypeptides, the hook subunit and an amber fragment of flagellin, were absent in strains that carried a cya mutation. Their synthesis was depressed in strains grown under conditions of catabolite repression. The presence of the cfs mutation restored the specific synthesis of these two polypeptides.

40|$|Abstract Background Nicotine {{plays an}} {{important}} role in cigarette-smoke-associated airway disease. The present study was designed to examine if nicotine could induce airway hyperresponsiveness through kinin receptors, and if so, explore the underlying mechanisms involved. Methods Murine tracheal segments were cultured for 1, 2 or 4 days in serum-free DMEM medium in presence of nicotine (1 and 10 μM) or vehicle (DMSO). Contractile responses induced by kinin B 1 receptor agonist, des-Arg 9 -bradykinin, and B 2 receptor agonist, bradykinin, were monitored with myographs. The B 1 and B 2 receptor mRNA expressions were semi-quantified using real-time PCR and their corresponding protein expressions assessed with confocal-microscopy-based immunohistochemistry. Various pharmacological inhibitors were used for studying intracellular signaling pathways. Results Four days of organ culture with nicotine concentration-dependently increased kinin B 1 and B 2 receptor-mediated airway contractions, without altering the kinin receptor-mediated relaxations. No such increase was seen at day 1 or day 2. The airway contractile responses to 5 -HT, acetylcholine and endothelin receptor agonists remained unaffected by nicotine. Two different neuronal nicotinic receptor antagonists MG 624 and hexamethonium blocked the nicotine-induced effects. The enhanced contractile responses were accompanied by increased mRNA and protein expression for both kinin receptors, suggesting the involvement of transcriptional mechanisms. Confocal-microscopy-based immunohistochemistry showed that 4 days of nicotine treatment induced activation (phosphorylation) of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK 1 / 2) and p 38. Inhibition of JNK with its specific inhibitor SP 600125 abolished the nicotine-induced effects on kinin receptor-mediated contractions and reverted the enhanced receptor mRNA expression. Administration of phosphodiesterase inhibitors (YM 976 and theophylline), glucocorticoid (dexamethasone) or <b>adenylcyclase</b> activator (forskolin) suppressed the nicotine-enhanced airway contractile response to des-Arg 9 -bradykinin and bradykinin. Conclusions Nicotine induces airway hyperresponsiveness via transcriptional up-regulation of airway kinin B 1 and B 2 receptors, an effect mediated via neuronal nicotinic receptors. The underlying molecular mechanisms involve activation of JNK- and PDE 4 -mediated intracellular inflammatory signal pathways. Our results might be relevant to active and passive smokers suffering from airway hyperresponsiveness, and suggest new therapeutic targets for the treatment of smoke-associated airway disease. </p...|$|E
40|$|Up to now {{respiratory}} physiologists {{have paid}} little attention to the functional disorders of the respiratory apparatus that are liable to arise during diseases which start at a distance from the lung. This lack of interest is no doubt related {{to the fact that the}} lung has long been considered a passive organ controlling gaseous exchanges whose own metabolism was negligible. Several recent studies, however, have reminded us that the development and function of the lung are affected by various hormones, including the growth hormone and thyroid hormones. This is a good opportunity to clarify the position in this field and to review the respiratory functional anomalies described in endocrine disorders. It must be emphasized that the published results are fragmentary and sometimes even contradictory: moreover, throughout this review the authors have tried to separate probabilities from uncertainties, while indicating the points which seem to deserve complementary investigations. It must also be emphasized that this work deals with endocrine disorders; in no way does it try to review the biochemical changes observed in experimental pathology through the action of certain hormones. Thus, there is no reference to the role of glucocorticoids in the maturation of the system which can produce surface acting agents, nor of the effects of the catecholamines on <b>adenylcyclase,</b> or of their part in the control of the tonus of the smooth muscle of the bronchi. In the same way, there is no attempt to define exactly the cellular activity of the different hormones. Lastly, the authors do not consider the reaction of respiratory failures or their treatment of the endocrine glands. The studies analysed in this review clearly show that the lung is not an inert organ but that its structure, and therefore its functioning, can be affected by general biochemical or metabolic changes, produced either by hormonal dysfunctions or other types of aggression. Another example of functional respiratory disorders produced by acute disorders arising outside the lung can be found in acute pancreatitis, even when there are no clinical or radiological signs of a pulmonary lesion. Moreover, the lung itself is only one stage in a complex system whose extrapulmonary components vary, as is illustrated by the complex anomalies induced by thyroid disorders. The time seems to have arrived for the respiratory physiologist to expand his routine fields of investigation to improve the definition of the place of the respiratory system in the general management of the organism.

40|$|Agmatine ureohydrolase (EC. 3. 5. 3. 11) was {{purified}} 3, 300 fold from an E. coli strain by {{ammonium sulphate}} precipitation, heat treatment, ion-exchange column chromatography, gel permeation column chromatography and chromatofocusing. The active enzyme {{is probably a}} dimer of identical subunits with a molecular weight of 38, 000, and a pI of 8. 3. The Km for agmatine was 1. 3 mM, L-arginine was a competitive inhibiter and ornithine inhibited in a mixed manner. In crude extracts the enzyme was associated with another factor, probably a protein, which reduced the pI to 5. 5 and decreased {{the activity of the}} enzyme. This factor also blocked reaction with antibodies raised against the purified enzyme in rabbits. In a strain known to express both biosynthetic and biodegradative ornithine decarboxylase and arginine decarboxylase, there was evidence for only the biosynthetic form of agmatine ureohydrolase. [...] Agmatine ureohydrolase was negatively regulated by cAMP and the cAMP receptor protein, CRP. The specific activity of agmatine ureohydrolase was determined in crude extracts prepared from wild type strains of E. coli, from strains carrying a mutation in the structural gene for <b>adenylcyclase</b> (EC. 4. 6. 1. 1) (cya) or from strains carrying mutations in both cya and cAMP receptor protein gene (crp). Cyclic AMP when added to a glucose based medium repressed the specific activity of agmatine ureohydrolase, in contrast, cAMP induced the specific activity of β -galactosidase in both the wild type and the cya mutant, but not in the crp mutant. Addition of 1 mM agmatine to a glucose based medium induced an the specific activity of agmatine ureohydrolase in wild type, ∆cya or ∆cya, ∆crp strains. Chloramphenicol (150 μg/ml) abolished the inducibility of agmatine ureohydrolase by agmatine. In mutants blocked in the steps leading to the biosynthesis of polyamines, the addition of putrescine repressed the specific activities of arginine decarboxylase and ornithine decarboxylase, but did not affect agmatine ureohydrolase activity. The negative regulation of speA, speB and speC (encode arginine decarboxylase, agmatine ureohydrolase and ornithine decarboxylase respectively) by cAMP was shown not to be mediated by the repressive effect of cAMP on glutamine synthetase (EC. 6. 3. 1. 2), as cAMP repressed the expression of all three genes in a strain deleted for glnA (encodes glutamine synthetase). [...] The speB gene was cloned into the plasmid vector pBR 322 at the BamHI site, and was localised by exonuclease digestion of the plasmid pKA 5. The extent of digestion of the plasmid was determined and was related to the ability of these religated plasmids to restore agmatine ureohydrolase activity to an speBsup- strain of E. coli. Using a cell-free transcription and translation system the direction of transcription and the approximate location of the promoter was determined. The direction of transcription was also determined by cloning fragments in both directions into the promoterless genes of lacZ (encodes β -galactosidase) and galK {encodes galactokinase). The ability of these hybrid genes to confer enzymatic activities (β -galactosidase or galactokinase) to strains deleted in their respective genes confirmed the location of the speB promoter. [...] cAMP:CRP was shown to interact with the promoters of speA and speB using a cell-free transcription and translation system in which cloned copies of the genes served as templates. This was also shown in vivo, by demonstrating that cAMP, inhibited the expression of β -galactosidase and galactokinase in plasmids carrying fusions of the speA and speB promoters to the structural genes of these enzymes. In addition, cAMP supplementation of minicells carrying the plasmid pKA 5 (carries speB) caused repression of agmatine ureohydrolase synthesis. Cyclic AMP decreased and agmatine increased the steady state mRNA concentrations of speB, while those of lacZ were increased by cAMP in the ∆cya strain. In contrast, cAMP did not affect the steady state concentrations of lacZ or speB mRNAs in the ∆crp strain...|$|E
