25|$|The current constitution, {{created in}} 1982, states in Article V that no {{organization}} or individual {{is above the}} law and in Article III makes the People’s Congresses and state administration responsible to the people, {{paving the way for}} later efforts to allow enforcement of individual rights. Passage of the <b>Administrative</b> <b>Litigation</b> Law of 1987 created legal recourse for individuals from arbitrary government action, an avenue previously unavailable. Despite the deep-seated norm against legal proceedings, litigation in the Chinese courts has increased dramatically, especially in recent years. The continuing weakness of courts resulting from their dependence on the local government for financial support and enforcement undermines the effectiveness of these remedies but this has also begun to change with China’s initiatives to increase legal training and the professionalism of the judiciary.|$|E

40|$|This study explores how {{state power}} in China affects the {{development}} of the legal system in a changing environment. Based on a survey of about 290 lawyers, it is found that Chinese lawyers are selective in taking on lawsuits. They are more willing to represent clients in litigations pertaining to economic and civil affairs, as opposed to <b>administrative</b> <b>litigations</b> and criminal cases. For one thing, lawyers receive high payment for lawsuits of an economic nature. For another, there are risks involved in taking on <b>administrative</b> <b>litigations</b> and criminal cases. Selective legal representation by lawyers suggests that legal development in China is unbalanced. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Ltd...|$|R

30|$|Therefore, the {{analyses}} of conflicts {{based on the}} observation of legal and <b>administrative</b> <b>litigations</b> are conducted at small administrative unit (department, district, division etc.) level.

40|$|The {{suspension}} in prevention, as a {{precautionary measure}} in <b>administrative</b> law <b>litigation</b> in Colombia, {{in its first}} bill was established as an action, by which, citizens who had serious evidence {{that they were going}} to be illegal or unconstitutional actions or operations to their detriment, they could prevent such actions or operations from happening by means of <b>Administrative</b> Law <b>litigation.</b> This was established by Article 153 of the C. C. A, (Colombian Administrative Statute) included in the Extraordinary Decree 01 of 1984, in Title XVII of the provisional suspension. This tool was essentially a precautionary measure that prevented an unconstitutional or illegal administrative action, not subject to any other legal action, from happening, and its purpose was to prevent any harm that would result from such action. It was different from other protection measure of temporary suspension in which the action had already happened and such action was already producing effects. The suspension in prevention was revoked after a short period of judicial enforcement, resulting in a legal emptiness caused by the absence of this important procedural protection tool that allowed citizens to preventively stop administrative actions against the Constitution or the law. Finally, such suspension affects the constitutional development of effective judicial protection, specifically as it relates to precautionary measures in <b>administrative</b> law <b>litigation,</b> issue that is to be hugely developed in the Colombian legal system...|$|R

40|$|According to article 53, {{paragraph}} 1 of the Constitution of the Republic of Moldova, adopted on July 27 th, 1994, the lawgiver {{establishes the}} institution of the administrative contentious and it determines the parties in this litigious: a) the public authority and b) the injured person, through an administrative act or by refusing to solve a claim. Subsequently, administrative contentious law establishes the legal functioning regime of this institution. Since Soviet law, applied to the Republic of Moldova for 47 years, did not recognize the <b>administrative</b> contentious <b>litigations,</b> today is quite difficult to implement this as a state responsibility towards the citizen. The causes are various: the transition period from totalitarian regime to a democratic one, which lasted about two decades, the low level of legal culture of the citizens, political instability and justice dependence on politics, etc. In this paper we will analyze the normative stipulations that govern the legal position of parties in <b>administrative</b> contentious <b>litigation</b> established in the actual legislation in Republic of Moldova...|$|R

30|$|The {{structure}} {{of this article}} is as follows: we shall first present the scope of our investigations, placing particular emphasis on the questions of definition, origins and expression of conflicts. The second section of the paper is devoted to the presentation of our data collection method. We begin by describing the procedure of identification and diagnosis of the conflicts that occur in the area we have selected, and then discuss the identification method per se and more specifically its three foundation stones: the analysis of the daily regional press, of <b>administrative</b> <b>litigations</b> and the exploitation of surveys conducted by experts. In the third section we first present the Conflict © database compiled from the information gathered. It addresses the questions of the construction and classification of the objects of conflicts, of the actors' profiles, of their utilization of land and of their arguments, successively. We end the article with a brief presentation of the results obtained from the exploitation of the database on conflictuality on selected case studies from developed to developing countries.|$|R
