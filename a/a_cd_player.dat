5|$|Shortly {{after the}} release of the Genesis, Sega's Consumer Products Research and Development Labs led by manager Tomio Takami were tasked with {{creating}} a CD-ROM add-on for the system, which became the Sega CD. The Sega CD was originally intended to equal the capabilities of the TurboGrafx-CD, but with twice as much random-access memory (RAM), and sell for about JP¥20,000 (or US$150). In addition to relatively short loading times, Takami's team planned for the device to feature hardware scaling and rotation similar to that found in Sega's arcade games, which required the use of a dedicated digital signal processor (DSP). However, two changes made later in development contributed to the final unit's higher than expected price. Because the Genesis' Motorola 68000 CPU was too slow to handle the Sega CD's new graphical capabilities, an additional 68000 CPU was incorporated into the add-on. In addition, upon hearing rumors that NEC planned a memory upgrade to the TurboGrafx-CD, which would bring its available RAM from 0.5 Mbit to between 2 and 4 Mbit, Sega decided to increase the Sega CD's available RAM from 1 Mbit to 6 Mbit. This proved {{to be one of the}} greatest technical challenges during development since the Genesis' access speed was initially too slow to run programs effectively. The cost of the device was now estimated at $370, but market research convinced Sega executives that consumers would be willing to pay more for a state-of-the-art machine. Sega partnered with JVC, which had been working with Warner New Media to develop <b>a</b> <b>CD</b> <b>player</b> under the CD+G standard, to develop the Sega CD.|$|E

5000|$|When {{two or more}} drums are used, {{there is}} the {{potential}} for more variation of which notes are chosen; however, tuning between or during compositions is rare in live performance. With only two drums, it is common to find them tuned a perfect fourth apart (the same interval used in [...] "Here Comes the Bride") as is the tradition in western classical music for the timpani. Having three drums (typically the tumba, conga, and quinto) invites experimentation and individual customization. Some congueros like using the intervals of a major chord (e.g. F, <b>A,</b> <b>C).</b> Some <b>players</b> use the second inversion of a major chord (e.g. G, C, E); and some prefer a major second between the quinto and conga, with a perfect 4th descending to the tumba. Raul Rekow of Santana often plays five conga drums and tunes them to the opening phrase of a Latin tune.|$|R
50|$|Hailing from Rotterdam city Deformer {{integrated}} {{the local}} Gabber sound to their formula {{and the track}} ‘Slasher’ became a blueprint for future productions. The sound was different {{at the time and}} during that period the artwork for Drum and Bass records was usually very clean and mostly consisted of abstract computer graphics. Deformer took an opposite approach and made record sleeves that would more easily be associated with the artwork of Death Metal records. The cover for the maxi single ‘Meatcleaver’ was banned in several countries; it shows a monkey’s head composed of pornographic images. Due to the unorthodox record sleeves Deformer often failed to reach the more mainstream audience that buy Drum and bass records. Deformer is known for going against the grain and also like to induct hidden messages in their recordings and artwork. For example; in their 2005 album ‘Revolution Theory’ there is a hidden track before position 1 on the CD. This can only be found when rewinded in <b>an</b> external <b>cd</b> <b>player.</b> ‘Meatcleaver’ has reversed speech in the track, the artwork contains almost unrecognizable pop icons.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we study}} timed games played on {{weighted}} timed automata. In this context, the reachability problem asks if, given a set T of locations and <b>a</b> cost <b>C,</b> <b>Player</b> 1 has <b>a</b> strategy {{to force the}} game into T with a cost less than C no matter how Player 2 behaves. Recently, this problem has been studied independently by Alur et al and by Bouyer et al. In those two works, a semi-algorithm is proposed to solve the reachability problem, which is proved to terminate under a condition imposing the non-zenoness of cost. In this paper, we show that in the general case {{the existence of a}} strategy for Player 1 to win the game with a bounded cost is undecidable. Our undecidability result holds for weighted timed game automata with five clocks. On the positive side, we show that if we restrict the number of clocks to one and we limit the form of the cost on locations, then the semi-algorithm proposed by Bouyer et al always terminates. ...|$|R
25|$|The {{interior}} {{received a}} few major upgrades {{during the first}} generation's production run. In 1988, the 1989 model year Taurus got new door panels that had built in armrests and side speakers for the stereo. For the 1990 model year in 1989, it got a redesigned dashboard. This dash was designed {{similar to the one}} it replaced, although it had a different placement for the radio, and was designed to be able to contain either cupholders or <b>a</b> <b>CD</b> <b>player,</b> depending on the customer's choice of options. It also received a new steering wheel with an airbag, as Ford was making it standard in all of its cars.|$|E

For an additional £1,000 the Finesse added alloy wheels, air conditioning, <b>a</b> <b>CD</b> <b>player,</b> fog lamps and metallic paint. The more competitive prices {{managed to keep}} European Escort sales going until the last one rolled off the Halewood assembly line in July 2000, making it the last Ford car to be assembled there. The plant was transferred to Jaguar that year for the new X-Type saloon, and following the later merger with Land Rover and {{the sale of the}} plant to Tata, Ford now only has a small presence at Halewood - retaining the transmission works at the site.|$|E
25|$|From October 1995, the V6 {{models were}} simply {{known as the}} Vienta—losing the Camry {{identity}} altogether. The availability of manual transmission on the CSi and Touring Series V6 sedan variants coincided with the update, while the V6 Grande superseded the V6 Ultima. Perforated leather upholstery and wood grain trim on the Grande was optional. Towards {{the end of the}} model run, special edition Getaway (October 1996) and Intrigue (April 1997) sedan models were launched. Based on the CSi, the Getaway was further equipped with 14-inch alloy wheels, <b>a</b> <b>CD</b> <b>player</b> and air conditioning. Also based on the CSi, the Intrigue added air conditioning, CD player, Jacquard upholstery, extra seat-back map pockets, and 15-inch wheels. Toyota fitted the four-cylinder Intrigue with the same wheel covers as the Vienta CSi, with the Vienta Intrigue upgraded to alloy wheels.|$|E

40|$|International audienceVideogame {{interactions}} show {{a rather}} complex participation framework: players interact with present or absent players {{in and out}} of the game, directly or by avatars. The avatar, as fictional character which a player embodies in the videogame, has a central position: it is only through him and his actions that the player can act in the game. We therefore propose to question in detail the place the players of videogames give to the avatars. We will focus particularly on the organization of turn-taking in a complex and dynamic activity (Mondada, 2013), in which the participants constantly address their co-players as well as the different avatars in the game played by themselves. The space itself is constantly changing because the game goes on constantly. Our study is based on a collection of extracts from four French videogame interactions. The analysis revealed a particular form of turn-taking in videogame interactions (Colón de Carvajal, 2011; Piirainen-Marsh & Tainio, 2009), where the switch of turns of speech is highly dependent on the actions in the virtual world of the videogame. Thus, we have identified four forms of exchange as if a turn or action (Goodwin & Goodwin, 2004) is addressed to: a) a <b>player,</b> b) <b>an</b> avatar, <b>c)</b> <b>a</b> <b>player</b> and his avatar together, and d) an unclear referent...|$|R

25|$|Applications for car stereos varied widely. Auto {{manufacturers}} in the U.S. typically would fit a cassette slot into their standard large radio faceplates. Europe and Asia would standardize on DIN and double DIN sized faceplates. In the 1980s, a high-end installation {{would have a}} Dolby AM/FM cassette deck, and they rendered the 8-track cartridge obsolete in car installations because of space, performance, and audio quality. In the 1990s and 2000s, {{as the cost of}} building CD players declined, many manufacturers offered <b>a</b> <b>CD</b> <b>player.</b> The CD player eventually supplanted the cassette deck as standard equipment, but some cars, especially those targeted at older drivers, were offered with the option of a cassette player, either by itself or sometimes in combination with a CD slot. Most new cars can still accommodate aftermarket cassette players, and the auxiliary jack advertised for MP3 players can be used also with portable cassette players, but 2011 was the first model year for which no manufacturer offered factory-installed cassette players.|$|E
25|$|Introduced at the 1993 New York Auto Show, {{the main}} {{changes for the}} P10 came as a midyear refresh in April 1993 (model year 1993.5), when dual airbags {{replaced}} motorized seatbelts, leather interiors came standard with power front seats, matte-black side moldings were replaced by body-colored ones, the refrigerant was converted from R12 to R134a, the audio system was upgraded to six speakers with <b>a</b> <b>CD</b> <b>player</b> instead of the previously-standard cassette deck, and other new options such as remote keyless entry were added. In February 1994, the 1994 model year was given a new larger chrome-plated grille and door handles, a lowport engine (replacing the original highport SR20DE, in which the intake plenum is below the fuel injectors and fuel rail), {{a change in the}} vehicle's self-diagnostic system to OBD-II, and larger 195/65R14 tires. The Touring models, introduced in February 1994, featured a limited-slip differential in the transmission; 195/65R14 Yokohama tires, sportier, more highly bolstered black leather front bucket seats and fold-down rear seats; fog lights; and a spoiler on the rear decklid.|$|E

5000|$|Options are {{directed}} by MLB Rule 11 (<b>C).</b> <b>A</b> <b>player</b> has {{a finite number}} of option years in which he may be moved between the major and minor leagues an unlimited number of times. If a player is on the 40-man roster but not on the active major league roster, he is said to be on optional assignment—his organization may freely move him between the major league club and the minor league club. The rules for this are as follows. (In all cases, an assignment of a player on a major-league disabled list to the minors while on a rehabilitation assignment does not count as time spent in the minors.) A common misconception, based on the phrase, [...] "out of options," [...] is that a player may only be moved between the major and minor leagues a restricted number of times.|$|R

Assume that s and t are both over an integer {{alphabet}} [σ], where the first string contains n non-zero entries. We would wish to answer to the following basic question. Assuming that s and t differ in at most k positions, how many bits does player A need to send to <b>player</b> <b>C</b> so that he can recover s with certainty? Further, how much time does player A need to spend to compute the sent bits and how much time does <b>player</b> <b>C</b> need to recover the string s? This problem has a certain number of applications, for example in databases, where each of the two parties possesses a set of n key-value pairs, where keys are from the universe [u] and values are from [σ] and usually n≪ u. In this paper, we show a time and message-size optimal Las Vegas reduction from this problem to the problem of systematic error correction of k errors for strings of length Θ(n) over an alphabet of size 2 ^Θ(σ+ (u/n)). The additional running time incurred by the reduction is linear randomized for player A and linear deterministic for player B, but the correction works with certainty. When using the popular Reed-Solomon codes, the reduction gives a protocol that transmits O(k(u+σ)) bits and runs in time O(n·polylog(n) (u+σ)) for all values of k. The time is randomized for player A (encoding time) and deterministic for <b>player</b> <b>C</b> (decoding time). The space is optimal whenever k≤ (uσ) ^ 1 -Ω(1). Comment: 14 pages.
