5|$|I {{wanted to}} speak a little <b>about</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> {{impressed}} the most, and somehow I kept on ignoring his performances in my previous two banters during this Olympiad, which is ridiculous, but I think pride of place goes to Eugenio Torre. You probably know who he is, and you probably have read about his results by now, but what he achieved during this Olympiad is absolutely tremendous. He {{is by no means}} a young man by now and he... played a tremendous level of opposition. The Philippines are a decently strong team and they played very, very decent opposition almost throughout the tournament. The result Eugenio showed in this event is absolutely fantastic.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, attitudes <b>about</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> are {{homosexual}} {{may vary}} {{on the basis}} of partisan identification. Republicans are far more likely than Democrats to have negative attitudes <b>about</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> are gay and lesbian, according to surveys conducted by the National Election Studies from 2000 through 2004. This disparity is shown in the graph on the right, which is from a book published in 2008 by Joseph Fried. The tendency of Republicans to view gay and lesbian people negatively could be based on homophobia, religious beliefs, or conservatism with respect to the traditional family.|$|E

25|$|The {{onset of}} the {{southwest}} monsoon is anticipated to reach Punjab by May, but since the early 1970s the weather pattern has been irregular. The spring monsoon has either skipped over the area or has caused it to rain so hard that floods have resulted. June and July are oppressively hot. Although official estimates rarely place the temperature above 46°C, newspaper sources claim that it reaches 51°C and regularly carry reports <b>about</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> have succumbed to the heat. Heat records were broken in Multan in June 1993, when the mercury {{was reported to have}} risen to 54°C. In August the oppressive heat is punctuated by the rainy season, referred to as barsat, which brings relief in its wake. The hardest part of the summer is then over, but cooler weather does not come until late October.|$|E
25|$|Juliet is {{diagnosed}} with tuberculosis and {{is sent to}} a clinic. Again her parents leave the country, leaving her alone and desperately missing Pauline. Pauline is desolate without her, and the two begin an intense correspondence, writing not only as themselves, but in {{the roles of the}} royal couple of Borovnia. During this time Pauline begins a sexual relationship with a lodger, which makes Juliet jealous. For both of them, their fantasy life becomes a useful escape when under stress in the real world, and the two engage in increasingly violent, even murderous, fantasies <b>about</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> oppress them. After four months, Juliet is released from the clinic and their relationship intensifies. Juliet's father blames the intensity of the relationship on Pauline and speaks to her parents, who take her to a doctor. The doctor suspects that Pauline is homosexual, and considers this a cause of her increasing anger at her mother as well as her dramatic weight loss.|$|E

This is displayed in his contempt for the writers of The Itchy & Scratchy Show.|$|E
500|$|Jackman {{suggested}} that Aronofsky cast Rachel Weisz as his character's wife. The director, {{who was in}} a relationship with the actress, had originally hesitated to show the studio signs of favoritism in casting Weisz. With Jackman's earnest recommendation, the actress was cast as Izzi/Isabel. For her role, Weisz read books and first-person accounts <b>about</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> had terminal illnesses. The actress also visited hospitals to see young people who were dying and under hospice care. [...] "There were a few days where I was in the headspace where I could say: 'I could go now'," [...] said Weisz.|$|E

After being rebuffed by several institutes in the United Kingdom, Brinkley found a willing suitor {{in the university}} in Pavia, Italy.

Benito Mussolini himself revoked the degree, though Brinkley claimed it until he died. [...] Fishbein's interest in putting Brinkley out of business grew and he wrote more articles featuring stories <b>about</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> had grown sick or died after seeing Brinkley. But the AMA journal's readership was mostly restricted to other doctors, while Brinkley's radio station poured directly into peoples' homes every day.|$|E
