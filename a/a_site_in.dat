5|$|A fossil site at a {{borrow pit}} in near Cheswold, Delaware created during highway {{construction}} unearthed 11 specimens of fragmentary and unassociated avian fossils, which {{were identified by}} Rasmussen as including a small loon, a small gull-like species and five specimens of a gannet-like seabird, probably Morus loxostylus, a common species in the Miocene. All of these forms were already known from <b>a</b> <b>site</b> <b>in</b> Chesapeake Bay, Maryland. The finds suggests that the Delaware site was the near-shore area of a large bay {{at the time of}} deposition.|$|E
5|$|Apeomyoides savagei is {{a fossil}} rodent from the Miocene of the United States, the only {{species in the}} genus Apeomyoides. It is known from fragmentary jaws and {{isolated}} teeth from <b>a</b> <b>site</b> <b>in</b> the early Barstovian, around 15–16 million years ago, of Nevada. Together with other species from scattered localities in the United States, Japan, and Europe, Apeomyoides is classified in the subfamily Apeomyinae of the extinct rodent family Eomyidae. Apeomyines are a rare but widespread group {{that may have been}} adapted to a relatively dry habitat.|$|E
5|$|Ethnographies also caution against over-interpretation of sites. At <b>a</b> <b>site</b> <b>in</b> Chaco Canyon can {{be found}} a {{pictograph}} with a star, crescent and hand. It has been argued by some astronomers {{that this is a}} record of the 1054 Supernova. However recent reexaminations of related 'supernova petroglyphs' raises questions about such sites in general and anthropological evidence suggests other inrepretations. The Zuni people, who claim a strong ancestral affiliation with Chaco, marked their sun-watching station with a crescent, star, hand and sundisc, similar to those found at the Chaco site.|$|E

5|$|In {{common with}} many Oxford colleges, Jesus {{provides}} sporting facilities for students, including playing fields at <b>a</b> <b>site</b> <b>in</b> east Oxford off the Cowley Road known as Bartlemas (for {{its proximity to}} St Bartholomew's Chapel). Football, rugby, netball, field hockey, cricket, and tennis can be played there. Squash courts are at a separate city-centre site on St Cross Road. The college also provides students with membership of the university's gym and swimming pool on Iffley Road.|$|E
5|$|The Malice farming {{culture of}} {{southern}} Poland (all of 5th millennium and until 3800 BCE, named after <b>a</b> <b>site</b> <b>in</b> Malice near Sandomierz) {{was the first}} Neolithic culture to originate north of the Carpathian Mountains and spread south. A rare discovery of 5th millennium Malice culture buildings and decorated pottery was made in Targowisko, Wieliczka County.|$|E
5|$|The Pilgrim {{settlers}} {{realized that}} they did not have a patent to settle in the region, so they signed the Mayflower Compact prior to disembarking. The Pilgrims explored various parts of Cape Cod, and eventually sought a suitable location for a permanent settlement to the westward in Cape Cod Bay. The Pilgrims eventually came across the sheltered waters of Plymouth Harbor on December 17. The appealing protected bay led to <b>a</b> <b>site</b> <b>in</b> the present-day Harbor District being chosen for the new settlement after three days of surveying.|$|E

Located southwest of the Trans–Canada is the Cypress Hills Interprovincial Park, which features Fort Walsh and the highest elevation of Saskatchewan. Highway 1 traverses ranch lands, the Missouri Coteau topographical area, and rolling prairie agricultural plains.|$|E
5|$|Wilson Popenoe and {{his wife}} in 1931, at <b>a</b> <b>site</b> <b>in</b> Honduras dating back to 600 AD, found the lower {{mandible}} of a young Mayan woman, with three missing incisors replaced by pieces of shell, shaped to resemble teeth. Bone growth around two of the implants, {{and the formation of}} calculus, indicates that they were functional as well as esthetic. The fragment is currently part of the Osteological Collection of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology at Harvard University.|$|E
5|$|Although Triceratops are {{commonly}} portrayed as herding animals, {{there is currently}} little evidence that they lived in herds. While several other genera of horned dinosaurs are known from bonebeds preserving bones from two to {{hundreds or thousands of}} individuals, to date there is only one documented bonebed dominated by Triceratops bones: <b>a</b> <b>site</b> <b>in</b> southeastern Montana with the remains of three juveniles. It may be significant that only juveniles were present. Another, more recent find may reveal that Triceratops lived in small family groups. In 2012, a group of three Triceratops in relatively complete condition, each of varying sizes from a full-grown adult to a small juvenile, were found in Wyoming, near Newcastle. The remains are currently under excavation by paleontologist Peter Larson and a team from the Black Hills Institute. It is believed that the animals were traveling as a family unit, but it remains unknown if the group consists of a mated pair and their offspring, or two females and a juvenile they were caring for. The remains also show signs of predation or scavenging from Tyrannosaurus, particularly on the largest specimen, with the bones of the front limbs showing breakage and puncture wounds from Tyrannosaurus teeth.|$|E

5|$|B'alam Nehn (often {{referred}} to as Waterlily Jaguar) was the first king to actually record his position in the dynastic succession, declaring that he was seventh in line from K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo'. Stela15 records that he was already ruling Copán by AD504. B'alam Nehn is the only king of Copán to be mentioned in a hieroglyphic text from outside of the southeastern Maya region. His name appears in a text on Stela16 from Caracol, <b>a</b> <b>site</b> <b>in</b> Belize. The stela dates to AD534, but the text is not well understood. B'alam Nehn undertook major construction projects in the Acropolis, building over an early palace {{with a number of}} important structures.|$|E
5|$|Blakeney Point has a mixed {{colony of}} about 500 harbour and grey seals. The harbour seals have their young between June and August, and the pups, which can swim almost immediately, {{may be seen}} on the mud flats. Grey seals breed in winter, between November and January; their young cannot swim until they have lost their first white coat, so they are {{restricted}} to dry land for their first three or four weeks, and can be viewed on the beach during this period. Grey seals colonised <b>a</b> <b>site</b> <b>in</b> east Norfolk in 1993, and started breeding regularly at Blakeney in 2001. It is possible that they now outnumber harbour seals off the Norfolk coast. Seal-watching boat trips run from Blakeney and Morston harbours, giving good views without disturbing the seals. The corpses of 24 female or juvenile harbour seals were found in the Blakeney area between March 2009 and August 2010, each with spirally cut wounds consistent with the animal having been drawn through a ducted propeller.|$|E
5|$|Bridges {{and other}} key points were {{prepared}} for demolition at short notice by preparing chambers filled with explosives. A Depth Charge Crater was <b>a</b> <b>site</b> <b>in</b> a road (usually at a junction) prepared with buried explosives that could be detonated to instantly form a deep crater as an anti-tank obstacle. The Canadian pipe mine (later known as the McNaughton Tube after General Andrew McNaughton) was a horizontally bored pipe packed with explosives– once in place this {{could be used to}} instantly ruin a road or runway. Prepared demolitions had the advantage of being undetectable from the air—the enemy could not take any precautions against them, or plot a route of attack around them.|$|E

5|$|During the 1982–83 Football League season, both Oxford United and Reading {{competed in}} the Football League Third Division, then the third tier of English football—equivalent to today's League One. Managed by Jim Smith, Oxford {{challenged}} for promotion throughout the season, while Maurice Evans' Reading team languished near the relegation zone {{for much of the}} year, despite possessing one of the division's top-scoring forwards in Kerry Dixon. The colourful media mogul and former MP Robert Maxwell owned and chaired Oxford, having prevented the club's bankruptcy by buying it in 1982. One of the world's oldest football teams (established in 1871), Reading were a public limited company, chaired by Frank Waller, a prominent local businessman; while owning Oxford, Maxwell also held 19% of Reading's shares. The two clubs share a local rivalry. At the time, both were in financial difficulties, particularly Reading. Maxwell sought to build a new stadium for Oxford United; he had negotiated with the council over potential locations since the time of his takeover, favouring <b>a</b> <b>site</b> <b>in</b> the northern suburb of Marston, but had yet to win council permission to buy the land.|$|E
5|$|During the Cold War, new U.S. Air Force bases were {{constructed}} {{along the northern}} border of the continental U.S.; their most direct route to the Soviet Union was through the Arctic Circle. These sites were high-importance strategic bases for hosting long-range missiles and aircraft. In 1947, the New England Division of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers chose <b>a</b> <b>site</b> <b>in</b> northeastern Maine, within both the Limestone Township and Caswell Plantation. The remote site consisted mostly of dense forest, shallow marshes, and wild blueberry bogs, on a slight plateau over the town, which helped keep it above the fog most of the time. Only {{a small part of}} the base was suitable for farming, so there was little impact on Aroostook County's agricultural community. Additionally, Loring was not far from sources of materials for runway, taxiway, and parking apron construction. The most important benefit of the site was that it was a few hundred miles closer than any other base to potential targets in Europe.|$|E
5|$|In 1803, Secretary of War Henry Dearborn {{appointed}} Scott and Governor James Garrard {{to evaluate}} sites in Kentucky {{on which to}} construct a replacement for Fort Washington. Garrard, a central Kentucky native, insisted that the fort should be built at Frankfort. Scott disagreed, contending that the fort {{should not be in}} the state's interior and that the hilly terrain around Frankfort was unsuitable for constructing a fort. He waited several days for an appointment with Garrard to try and reach an agreement, but when he was unable to secure one, he asked Dearborn for permission to act alone. Dearborn granted the request and accepted Scott's recommendation of <b>a</b> <b>site</b> <b>in</b> Newport, Kentucky. In 1804, Scott was again chosen a presidential elector with minimal opposition.|$|E

5|$|In central California, the {{non-profit}} White Stag Leadership Development Academy sponsors a Learning for Life group, a Venturing crew, and a Boy Scout troop in the Silicon Valley Monterey Bay Council and the Alameda Council. These youth plan {{and put on}} a program each summer in Central California. In 2009 they offered for the first time two camps, one at Camp Tamarancho in Marin County in Northern California, and the second at Camp Lindblad in the Santa Cruz Mountains. They have continued to offer two weeks of summer camp and in 2012 based the program at <b>a</b> <b>site</b> <b>in</b> the Santa Lucia Range near Arroyo Seco. Youth staff participants are registered as members of the Boy Scouts or Venturing programs in the Silicon Valley Monterey Bay Council and the Alameda Council.|$|E
5|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} talk of {{building}} a replica of the memorial. On 31 May 2008 on Anzac Parade, Canberra, the formal dedication of <b>a</b> <b>site</b> <b>in</b> which will be placed a new national Boer War memorial was held. A National Boer War Memorial Committee was formed prior to that date, and they will be conducting a national competition to find a design for the new memorial. In the design brief for the memorial, the committee state that it is their desire to build a memorial along the same lines as Adelaide's: {{going so far as to}} say that they would be willing to accept a replica of the statue from the South Australian memorial if the original mould could be located or if a duplicate could otherwise be produced.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{this left}} open the {{question}} of where to locate the capital. Initially the Bombala district in the far south of NSW was proposed, to which southern Monaro, (which incorporated Bombala), Orange and Yass were soon added. The NSW Premier, John See, offered to provide any of the three recommended sites as a future capital territory. Edmund Barton, the first Prime Minister of the new Federal Government, added another four sites to this list: Albury, Tamworth, Armidale and Tumut, and members of the new government toured the various sites in 1902. The tour proved inconclusive, and upon their return the members decided to refer the problem to a Royal Commission, with the Minister for Home Affairs, William Lyne, pushing for Tumut or Albury as he preferred <b>a</b> <b>site</b> <b>in</b> his electorate. Subsequently, the Commission presented its report to Parliament in 1903, recommending the sites of Albury, Tumut and Orange, in that order. However, there continued to be problems, as the House of Representatives backed the Tumut option, while the Senate preferred the town of Bombala. As a result of this disagreement the bill lapsed, and it was left to the second Parliament to choose a location for the capital.|$|E
