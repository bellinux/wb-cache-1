25|$|Coward was in {{the middle}} of an {{extensive}} Asian tour when he contracted influenza in Shanghai. He spent the better part of his two-week convalescence sketching out the play and then completed the actual writing of the piece in only four days. He immediately cabled Gertrude Lawrence in New York to ask her to keep autumn 1930 free to appear in the play. After spending <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>weeks</b> revising it, he typed the final draft in The Cathay Hotel in Shanghai and sent copies to Lawrence and his producer and manager, John C. Wilson, with instructions to cable him with their reactions.|$|E
25|$|Double-tailed web spiders mate during summer. After mating, {{the female}} will lay her eggs in an egg sac (an ovoid ball of spider silk) in her sanctuary. She then {{stretches}} her body {{over the surface}} of the egg sac and guards it. This behavior is distinctive and makes the species easy to recognise. The mother does not feed nor leave the sanctuary until the eggs have hatched, which is usually after two or three weeks. Only then will she return {{to the center of the}} web and resume her normal activities. The spiderlings will remain in her sanctuary for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>weeks</b> before setting out on their own.|$|E
25|$|In early September 1950, Yoshida {{nominated}} Hayashi to {{head the}} NPR {{with support from the}} Emperor, who not only had confidence in Hayashi, but also appreciated his performance as Vice-Minister of Imperial Household. This time the nomination of Hayashi was opposed by Willoughby and his intelligence staff, which was responsible for recruitment matters of NPR. They not only favored Hattori and other prewar Japanese army officers, but also even tried to prevent Hayashi from getting appointed. Nevertheless, their views were not shared by other parties within the GHQ. In particular, both Brigadier-General Courtney Whitney, Chief of the Government Section (GS), which was responsible for the NPR's personnel matters, and Major-General Whitfield P. Shepard, Chief of the Civil Affairs Section Annex (CASA), which was responsible for the development and training of the NPR, favored Hayashi. G-3 Division of the GHQ, which dealt with military operations, law enforcement and repatriation, also showed their support to Hayashi. Because of Willoughby's opposition, the nomination of Hayashi dragged on for a month and it took <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>weeks</b> before the nomination was approved only after the intervention of MacArthur and Yoshida.|$|E
50|$|Starting in {{the late}} 1880s, the U.S. Army had adopted the system of filling each brigadier general {{position}} not by qualifications, but by mere seniority. The system usually gave elderly colonels <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> months, <b>weeks</b> or days of active duty with a new title, followed by nearly immediate retirement at a higher pay rate. Jacob Smith was slightly younger and his promotion to general was made earlier than typical; he had three years left until retirement became mandatory by law.|$|R
60|$|But Theodora wished herself less {{necessary}} at home, when, in <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>more,</b> she had {{to gather}} that matters were going on well from the large round-hand note, with nursery spelling and folding, in which Johnnie {{announced that he had}} a little brother.|$|R
60|$|Charlie {{was obliged}} to content himself with this arrangement. Next day he was {{galloping}} eastward--convoyed {{part of the way}} by the scout on Black Polly and Dick Darvall on Wheelbarrow. Soon he got into the region of railways and steam-boats, and, in <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>more</b> was once again in Old England.|$|R
25|$|The initial deaths {{occurred}} during organised clashes between {{the army and}} the PKI including Indonesian armed forces units who were sympathetic to communism and were trying to forcibly resist General Suharto's crackdown. For example, much of the Marine Corps, the Air Force, and the Brigade of Police (Brimob) were infiltrated up to commander level by the PKI. In early October, forces of the Strategic Command (Suharto's Kostrad), and the RPKAD paracommandos led by Colonel Sarwo Edhie Wibowo were sent to Central Java, a region with strong Communist allegiances, while troops of uncertain loyalty were ordered out. At the same time, the Siliwangi Division was deployed to guard Jakarta and West Java, both of which, unlike Central and East Java, remained relatively immune to the mass killings. Early fighting in the Central Java highlands and around Madiun suggested the PKI might be able to establish a rival regime centred on these regions. However, widespread fears of a civil war, between factions supported by the United States and China respectively, quickly evaporated, as the forces sent by Suharto took control. Many rebel commanders chose not to fight as Suharto-deployed forces arrived, although resistance came from some, like General Supardjo, for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>weeks.</b>|$|E
25|$|They {{find that}} a large party has {{assembled}} at his home and that the champagne is already flowing. Present are Lebedyev, his daughter Vera, Ippolit, Burdovsky, Kolya, General Ivolgin, Ganya, Ptitsyn, Ferdyschenko, Keller, and, to Myshkin's surprise, Yevgeny Pavlovich, who has come to ask for his friendship and advice. The guests greet the Prince warmly and compete for his attention. Stimulated by Lebedyev's eloquence, everyone engages for some time in intelligent and inebriated disputation on lofty subjects, but the good-humoured atmosphere begins to dissipate when Ippolit suddenly produces a large red-sealed envelope and announces that it contains an essay he has written which he now intends to read to them. The essay {{is a series of}} verbose psychological observations on the subject of his own approaching death, written in a defiant, self-conscious style, and culminating in the announcement that, rather than go on living for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>weeks,</b> he will be shooting himself at sunrise. The reading drags on for over an hour and by its end, the sun has risen. Most of his audience, however, is bored and resentful, apparently not at all concerned that he is about to shoot himself. Only Vera, Kolya, Burdovsky and Keller seek to restrain him. He distracts them by pretending to abandon the plan, then suddenly pulls out a small pistol, puts it to his temple and pulls the trigger. There is a click but no shot: Ippolit faints but is not killed. It turns out, to the great amusement of some, that he had taken out the cap earlier and forgotten to put it back in. Ippolit is devastated and tries desperately to convince everyone that it was an accident. Eventually, he falls asleep and the party disperses.|$|E
500|$|With Norwich {{back in the}} Premier League, Hooper was {{struggling}} to hold down {{a place in the}} team. By September 2015 he had only played ten minutes in the opening league match against Crystal Palace, and an 89th-minute substitute appearance against Southampton. A loan move to Sheffield Wednesday fell through despite the Yorkshire club agreeing to pay Norwich £500,000 and match Hooper's £32,000 weekly wage. Hooper denied press reports that the move collapsed due to his demand for Sheffield Wednesday to provide him with a VIP box at their stadium for his family and friends. [...] He remained at Norwich for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>weeks,</b> but sustained an ankle injury in training. [...] Sheffield Wednesday made a further attempt to sign Hooper on loan, and on 27 October he agreed to join them until January 2016.|$|E
25|$|The disease {{suddenly}} appeared in Hamburg, spreading so rapidly that, in <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks,</b> <b>more</b> than <b>a</b> thousand people died. The sickness swept through eastern Europe as an epidemic causing high mortality rates. It arrived in Switzerland in December, then was carried northwards to Denmark, Sweden and Norway, and eastwards to Lithuania, Poland and Russia.|$|R

50|$|GSN {{originally}} aired repeats of {{the series}} on Sunday nights in mid-2010, later putting the show additionally on weeknights for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>more,</b> until removing the show from the schedule completely. It was then re-added in a Saturday afternoon slot in January 2011. In June 2013, GSN removed the series from the schedule permanently.|$|R
500|$|Phips sailed {{from the}} Downs on 12 September 1686, and on 28 November arrived in Hispaniola, Samana Bay, where they {{spent two weeks}} {{restocking}} their water and provender. The weather was bad, and the search consequently did not get under way for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>weeks.</b> January 12, Phips sent out Captain Rogers in the smaller Henry of London along with three Native American divers (Jonas Abimeleck and John Pasqua, name of other diver not listed) to search what was then called the Ambrosia Bank (now the Silver Bank). There was a bit more delay from weather but Peter Earle writes, [...] "There {{is no doubt that}} he knew exactly where he was going." [...] January 20, they spotted cannons from a shipwreck lying on the white sands of the reef. The ship they had found was the Almiranta of the Spanish silver fleet (later determined to be Nuestra Señora de la Concepción; the English did not know the name of the ship) wrecked in 1641. Over the next two days, the divers were able to bring up 3,000 coins and 3 silver bars. They decided to travel back to Phips' to let him know but {{this turned out to be}} a somewhat slow and treacherous trip among the reefs.|$|E
2500|$|Minesweeping {{operations}} {{would continue}} for months, the UN ships constantly swept various areas {{to ensure that}} no new mine fields were laid. Incidents of shore batteries scoring hits on allied warships also became less common and for weeks no vessels were damaged until October 29 when the [...] was engaged. The Ospreys engine room flooded after being hit three times and communications went out, one man was seriously wounded though the ship was saved from sinking. By November 9, the minesweeping mission was eighty percent complete, accurate shore battery fire delayed the UN ships from completing the operation for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>weeks.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In {{late summer}} 1939 Lloyd {{was invited to}} Hollywood, to join Welles and other Mercury Theatre members in the first film being {{prepared}} for RKO Pictures — Heart of Darkness. Given a six-week guarantee at $500 a week, he {{took part in a}} reading for the film, which was to be presented entirely through a first-person camera. After elaborate pre-production the project never reached production because Welles was unable to trim $50,000 from its budget, something RKO insisted upon as revenue was declining sharply in Europe by autumn 1939. Welles asked the actors to stay <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>weeks</b> as he put together another film project, but Lloyd was ill-advised {{by a member of the}} radio company and impulsively returned to New York. [...] "Those who stayed did Citizen Kane," [...] Lloyd wrote. [...] "I have always regretted it." ...|$|E

They were not likely to {{live to see the}} ultimate overthrow of the capitalist system. Were they also to forgo the release of perhaps two hours a day from the hated work? That was all they could hope to see realized in their lifetime.|$|R
50|$|Despite the royalist {{tendencies of}} Peru, junta {{movements}} did emerge, often fomented by {{the approach of}} patriot armies from Buenos Aires. There were two short-lived uprisings in {{the southern city of}} Tacna in 1811 and 1813. One significant movement, led by Natives in Huánuco, began on February 22, 1812. It involved various leaders, including curacas and township magistrates (alcaldes pedáneos), but was suppressed within <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks.</b> <b>More</b> enduring was the rebellion of Cuzco from 1814 to 1815.|$|R
60|$|But {{this remark}} of my friend's {{appeared}} <b>more</b> evident in <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>more,</b> for the decrease went on, and another week in October it decreased 1843, {{so that the}} number dead of the plague was but 2665; and the next week it decreased 1413 more, {{and yet it was}} seen plainly that there was abundance of people sick, nay, abundance more than ordinary, and abundance fell sick every day but (as above) the malignity of the disease abated.|$|R
2500|$|Strained yogurt {{has been}} {{strained}} through a filter, traditionally made of muslin {{and more recently}} of paper or non-muslin cloth. This removes the whey, giving a much thicker consistency. [...] Strained yogurt is becoming more popular with those who make yogurt at home, especially if using skimmed milk which results in a thinner consistency. Yogurt that has been strained to filter or remove the whey is known as Labneh in Middle Eastern countries. It has a consistency between that of yogurt and cheese. It is popular for sandwiches in Middle Eastern countries. Olive oil, cucumber slices, olives, and various green herbs may be added. It can be thickened further and rolled into balls, preserved in olive oil, and fermented for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>weeks.</b> It is sometimes used with onions, meat, and nuts as a stuffing {{for a variety of}} pies or kibbeh balls.|$|E
2500|$|In Petrograd Trotsky argued passionately against signing, {{proposing that}} instead [...] "they should {{announce}} {{the termination of}} the war and demobilization without signing any peace." [...] Lenin was for signing rather than having an even more ruinous treaty forced on them after <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>weeks</b> of military humiliation. [...] The [...] "Left Communists", led by Nikolai Bukharin and Karl Radek, were sure that Germany, Austria, Turkey, and Bulgaria were all on the verge of revolution. They wanted to continue the war with a newly-raised revolutionary force while awaiting for these upheavals. Consequently Lenin agreed to Trotsky's formula [...] a position summed up as [...] "no war – no peace" [...] which was announced when the negotiators reconvened on 10 February 1918. [...] The Russians thought their stalling was succeeding until 16 February when Hoffmann notified them that the war would resume in two days, when fifty-three divisions advanced against the near-empty Russian trenches. [...] On the night of 18 February the Central Committee supported Lenin's resolution that they sign the treaty by a margin of seven to five. [...] Hoffmann kept advancing until 23 February when he presented new terms that included the withdrawal of all Russian troops from Ukraine and Finland. [...] They were give 48 hours to decide. [...] Lenin told the Central Committee that [...] "you must sign this shameful peace in order to save the world revolution". [...] If they did not agree he would resign. [...] He was supported by six Central Committee members, opposed by three, with Trotsky and three others abstaining. [...] Trotsky resigned as foreign minister and was replaced by Grigori Sokolnikov.|$|E

60|$|It {{is not my}} {{intention}} to delay over my life either at home or at North Villa, during the spring and summer. This would be merely to repeat much {{of what has been}} already related.

6000|$|Four {{years he}} lingers; friends begin to arise from one quarter and another, but he, not {{altogether}} wisely or well, refuses all pecuniary help.

50|$|The journey resumed. The help of Duarte Barbosa {{was crucial}} in facing the riot in Puerto San Julian; Magellan {{appointed}} him as {{captain of the}} Victoria.
