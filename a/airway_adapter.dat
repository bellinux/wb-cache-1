40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} three prototype {{versions of}} semi-quantitative end-tidal CO 2 monitors with different alarm features during prehospital or inter-facility use. Methods: Subjects were 43 adult, non-pregnant patients requiring intuba-tion, or who already were intubated and required transport. Teams at one AirEvac and seven Advanced Life Support (ALS) paramedic stations {{were trained in}} the use of the monitors. Team members at each station evaluated each model for eight days. Participants completed questionnaires following each use. Results: The monitors performed properly in all cases, but in one case, vomit in the <b>airway</b> <b>adapter</b> tube prevented obtaining a readout. The moni-tors aided management in 40 of 43 cases (93 %); in one, the monitor reading was reported as variable (between 20 and 30 mmHg) although the teams knew the monitors were semi-quantitative; in another, the monitor was not required, but performed properly; and the third was the one in which vomit in the tube prevented a reading. In 26 of 43 cases (60. 4 %), the monitor was used to confirm endotracheal tube placement (there were no instances of incorrect placement). In all cases, the devices were used to monitor respira-tion and oxygen saturation. Alarms were audible in the environment, but only preferred in the AirEvac situation. The “breath beep ” feature was use-ful, particularly in patients in whom chest movements during respiration were difficult to observe. Conclusions: “Breath beeps ” were clearly audible and were a useful feature in all prehospital and transport environments, while audible alarms were desired only in the AirEvac situation. Semi-quantitative CO 2 detection is valuable in the ALS/AirEvac environment, even for teams with high intu-bation success rates.
