The goal of IDEA’s regulations for evaluation is to help minimize the number of misidentifications, to provide a variety of assessment tools and strategies, to prohibit the use of any single evaluation as the sole criterion of which a student is placed in special education services, and to provide protections against evaluation measures that are racially or culturally discriminatory. Overall, the goal of <b>appropriate</b> <b>evaluation</b> is to get students who need help, extra help that is appropriate for the student and helps that specific student to reach his or her goals set by the IEP team.|$|E

50|$|Evaluation of an {{intelligent}} tutoring system {{is an important}} phase; however, it is often difficult, costly, and time consuming. Even though there are various evaluation techniques presented in the literature, there are no guiding principles for the selection of <b>appropriate</b> <b>evaluation</b> method(s) {{to be used in}} a particular context. Careful inspection should be undertaken to ensure that a complex system does what it claims to do. This assessment may occur during the design and early development of the system to identify problems and to guide modifications (i.e. formative evaluation). In contrast, the evaluation may occur after the completion of the system to support formal claims about the construction, behaviour of, or outcomes associated with a completed system (i.e. summative evaluation). The great challenge introduced by the lack of evaluation standards resulted in neglecting the evaluation stage in several existing ITS'.|$|E
5000|$|Surgery for {{epilepsy}} patients {{has been}} used for over a century, but due to technological restrictions and insufficient knowledge of brain surgery, this treatment approach was relatively rare until the 1980s and 90s. [...] Prior to the 1980s, no classification system existed {{due to the lack of}} operations performed up until the time. As surgery as a treatment grew more prevalent, a classification system became a necessity. The <b>appropriate</b> <b>evaluation</b> of patients following epilepsy surgery is extremely important, as medical professionals must know the appropriate course of action to follow in order to achieve seizure freedom for patients. [...] Accordingly, the Engel classification guidelines were devised by UCLA neurologist Jerome Engel Jr. in 1987 and made public at the 1992 Palm Desert Conference on Epilepsy Surgery. The Engel classification system has since become the standard in reporting postoperative outcomes of epilepsy surgery.|$|E

40|$|The {{last three}} years have seen an {{increasing}} interest in evaluation {{in the public sector}} in New Zealand. This trend could result in an adequately resourced and sophisticated approach to evaluation, involving policy and provider levels within government, Mäori and third-sector/community organisations.

On the other hand, it is possible that unrealistic expectations, an unsophisticated model of evaluation, lack of strategic involvement of stakeholders and inadequate investment in <b>appropriate</b> <b>evaluation</b> capacity building will result in the current wave of enthusiasm ultimately turning to disillusionment.
