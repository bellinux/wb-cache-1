40|$|The {{market risk}} of returns for BRIC Eurobonds {{has not been}} {{thoroughly}} analyzed via nonparametric estimation methods. The significance of risk <b>and</b> <b>jumps</b> is examined in a monthly sampling frequency. A detailed comparison upon significance of risk <b>and</b> <b>jumps</b> between BRIC Eurobonds is provided. Comparison concerns risk <b>and</b> <b>jumps</b> during the international financial crisis period: February 2007 up to February 2010. Among the BRIC countries, Chinese Eurobonds are the most significant {{in terms of both}} risk <b>and</b> <b>jumps.</b> The most significant estimator is the monthly Yang & Zhang range across the set of BRIC Eurobonds. The shorter the expiry period, the higher is the significance of risk <b>and</b> <b>jumps.</b> This is evident in all BRIC Eurobonds.

5|$|Kroonland was {{the scene}} of an {{attempted}} murder-suicide in October 1908. Two acquaintances in steerage had an argument over a young female second-class passenger that both men knew. One man threw a knife at the other—only slightly wounding him—and then fled <b>and</b> <b>jumped</b> over the railing into the English Channel near Dover. U.S. Senator Benjamin Tillman and his wife were aboard the liner at the time and saw the young man jump overboard. Although the ship lowered a boat to look for him, no trace of him was found, and he was presumed drowned.|$|E
5|$|One notable Dream Shake {{happened}} in Game 2 of the 1995 Western Conference Finals against the Spurs. With David Robinson guarding him, Olajuwon performed a cross-over, {{drove to the}} basket and faked a layup. Robinson, an excellent defender, kept up with Olajuwon and remained planted. Olajuwon spun counterclockwise and faked a jump shot. Robinson, who was voted the 1995 NBA MVP, fell for the fake <b>and</b> <b>jumped</b> to block the shot. With Robinson in the air, Olajuwon performed an up-and-under move and made an easy layup.|$|E

This left the 36th Battalion, Virginia Cavalry, between Gibson's Brigade and General Johnson's headquarters at the McNeill house. The 36th offered the best resistance Gibson had faced so far, but the surprised Confederates were forced to retreat toward the McNeill farm. Near the McNeill house the men from the Confederate Baltimore Battery attempted to fire canister from their two guns, but the unit and guns were captured by the 8th Ohio Cavalry before they could be fired. General Johnson was nearly captured when his headquarters was partially surrounded by Union cavalry. He escaped out the back door <b>and</b> <b>jumped</b> on a horse—racing south to the 8th Virginia Cavalry.|$|E

40|$|Significant jumps {{have been}} found in stock prices and stock indexes, which implied that jump risk is part of {{systematic}} risks. Since jump risk is priced, adding jump risk into the traditional finance models has significant empirical and theoretical meanings. Earlier attempts to model <b>and</b> estimate <b>jumps</b> are based on parametric jump-diffusion models. Due to the limitation of parametric models, the literature is rapidly moving towards using nonparametric methods to study various attributes of jumps in stock prices <b>and</b> the associated <b>jump</b> risks. Two nonparametric methods are employed to extract two different types of jump risks in this thesis. The Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard (2006) method tests for large <b>and</b> rare <b>jumps</b> <b>and</b> can only be used to estimate the total jump risks. Macinni (2009) method allows for both small jumps with infinite activity <b>and</b> large <b>jumps</b> with finite activity. However, the latter method is computationally intensive and is only used to extract the systematic jump risks by applying it only to the market returns. Jump estimations are computed on 1300 individual stocks <b>and</b> 1 index. <b>Jump</b> risks are found in all 1300 stocks and the index <b>and</b> <b>jump</b> risk is a small component of the total risk. SmallCap stocks tend to have higher diffusion <b>and</b> <b>jump</b> risks than MidCap and LargeCap stocks. When SmallCap stocks are used to form portfolio, its diversification gain is higher than that of portfolios formed by MidCap or LargeCap stocks. A portfolio's diffusion <b>and</b> <b>jump</b> risks decrease at a diminishing speed as the number of its constituents increase <b>and</b> its <b>jump</b> risk decreases faster than diffusion risk. However, the uncertainty associated with the diversification gain of jump risk is much higher than that of the diffusion risk. To measure the systematic diffusion <b>and</b> <b>jump</b> risks, CAPM is dichotomised into a two-factor model, two independent factors representing the diffusion <b>and</b> <b>jump</b> return processes. The diffusion <b>and</b> <b>jump</b> betas for the 1300 stocks are estimated. The diffusion <b>and</b> <b>jump</b> betas for stocks tend to be statistically different from each other...|$|R

5|$|The third {{match was}} between Monty Brown and Jeff Hardy to {{determine}} the number-one contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Hardy scored a two-count on Brown by slamming the back of Brown's head and neck into the mat with a reverse neckbreaker. Hardy then {{climbed to the top}} rope <b>and</b> <b>jumped</b> off with a somersault toward Brown, who was laying on his back in the ring, to attempt his signature Swanton Bomb maneuver.

Brown followed by pinning Hardy at 8 minutes and 43 seconds to win the contest and become number-one contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E
5|$|Any hope of {{resistance}} was centered on two young princes, Emperor Gong's brothers. The older boy, Zhao Shi, who {{was nine years}} old, was declared emperor on June 14, 1276, in Fuzhou. The court sought refuge in Quanzhou, seeking an alliance with the Superintendent of Maritime Shipping, the Muslim Pu Shougeng. However, he secretly formed an alliance with Kublai, so the Song court was forced to flee in 1277. The court then sought refuge in Silvermine Bay (Mui Wo) on Lantau Island. The older brother became ill and died on May 8, 1278 at age ten, and was succeeded by his younger brother who became Emperor Huaizong of Song, aged seven. The Sung Wong Toi monument in Kowloon commemorates his enthronement. On March 19, 1279 the Song army was defeated in its last battle, the Battle of Yamen, fought against the Yuan army led by the Chinese general Zhang Hongfan in the Pearl River Delta. Song Prime Minister Lu Xiufu {{is said to have}} taken the boy emperor in his arms <b>and</b> <b>jumped</b> from his sinking ship into the sea, drowning both of them.|$|E
40|$|It is {{well-documented}} that stock returns have different sensitivities {{to changes in}} aggregate volatility, however less is known about their sensitivity to market jump risk.

5|$|Hill {{commanded}} the battalion {{during its first}} airborne operation in North Africa, dropping near the towns of Souk el-Arba and Béja, in Tunisia. It secured Beja and then sent out patrols to harass German troops, ambushing a convoy and inflicting numerous German casualties, and defended a bridge at Medjez el Bab, although it was eventually forced to retreat. Hill was wounded during an attack by the battalion on Gue Hill, in which he attempted to capture three Italian tanks using his revolver; the crews of two were successfully subdued without incident, but the third opened fire and hit Hill in the chest several times. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) and Légion d'Honneur for his service in North Africa and then evacuated back to England. There he took command of the 3rd Parachute Brigade in the newly formed 6th Airborne Division, <b>and</b> <b>jumped</b> with the brigade during Operation Tonga, the British airborne landings in Normandy {{on the night of}} 5/6 June 1944. After nearly being killed on D-Day, by an aircraft strafing his position, Hill {{commanded the}} brigade {{throughout the rest of the}} time it was in Normandy, once leading a counter-attack during a German assault and later winning the first Bar to his DSO.|$|E
5|$|Michigan {{was never}} in {{contention}} during the game, as Michigan's offense was shut {{out in the first}} half, while Wisconsin's offense dominated Michigan's defense <b>and</b> <b>jumped</b> out to a 24–0 halftime lead. Wisconsin's only score of the first quarter was a 1-yard touchdown run by Montee Ball. In the second quarter, they added to their lead with a 25-yard field goal by Philip Welch, a 27-yard touchdown run by Montee Ball, and a 61-yard run by James White. Michigan started the second half by finally getting on the board with 2 touchdowns: a 24-yard reception by Darryl Stonum, and then a 4-yard run by Denard Robinson. Wisconsin responded with a 23-yard run by James White. Michigan replied with an 11-yard run by Denard Robinson. The Badgers added to their lead on the opening play of the fourth quarter with a 3-yard run by Montee Ball. Wisconsin then more added points with a 40-yard field goal. Michigan's only score of the quarter was a 28-yard catch by Roy Roundtree. Wisconsin sealed its win with a 4-yard run by Montee Ball.|$|E
5|$|Next was the Deuces Wild Tag Team Tournament finals for {{the vacant}} TNA World Tag Team Championship between LAX, {{accompanied}} by Guerrero and Salinas, and Team 3D. The duration was eleven minutes and thirty seconds. Devine tried {{to interfere in}} the contest by setting up a table for Team 3D, but Guerrero stopped him {{and set up the}} table for himself outside the ring, placing Devine on top. Guerrero then climbed a padded turnbuckle <b>and</b> <b>jumped</b> onto Devine with a diving foot stomp, forcing him through the table. In the ring, Team 3D performed one of their signature tag team maneuvers, the 3D II, forcing Homicide into the mat and following with a cover, but the referee refused to count because Homicide was not the legal man in the contest. Hernandez then performed his signature Border Toss maneuver on Devon, slamming him into the mat from the top of a turnbuckle. Homicide followed with a splash from the top of a padded turnbuckle on Devon for the pinfall victory, winning the Deuces Wild Tag Team Tournament and the vacant TNA World Tag Team Championship.|$|E

5|$|The Six Man Tag Team Street Fight {{between the}} team of Jay Lethal and MCMG (Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin) and {{the team of}} Johnny Devine and Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray). The {{stipulation}}s were if Lethal and MCMG won then Team 3D {{would be forced to}} work with a weight limit, while if Devine and Team 3D won the TNA X Division would dissemble. Another added stipulation before the contest was whoever gained the pinfall would win the TNA X Division Championship. It lasted twelve minutes and thirty seconds. A Street Fight is fought under no disqualification and no count-out rules, with weapons legal and provided for the match. During the final minutes, both Sabin and Shelley were scripted to appear unconscious at ringside, which caused Lethal to have to fight off Devine and Team 3D alone. Near the end of the match Team 3D set up a table; Lethal followed by sending both out of the ring and laying Devine over the table. Lethal then stood {{on the top of a}} padded turnbuckle <b>and</b> <b>jumped</b> off to perform an elbow drop on Devine through the table to win the match. With the victory, Lethal won the TNA X Division Championship, prevented the X Division from disbanding, and forced Team 3D to work with a weight limit in the company.|$|E
5|$|The TNA X Division Championship was {{defended by}} A.J. Styles against Petey Williams next. Williams was {{accompanied}} by A-1. The duration of the contest was 18 minutes and 20 seconds. Early in the bout, Styles jumped over the top rope to ringside aiming to land on Williams, he instead overshot and crashed into the guardrail. Mid-way through the contest, Styles attempted to perform his signature Styles Clash maneuver, but Williams countered. Afterwards, Williams attempted to perform his signature Canadian Destroyer, but this time Styles counter. Williams held Styles in his signature Sharpshooter submission hold during the encounter. Styles fought out of it by grabbing the bottom rope and forcing it to be released. Samoa Joe interfered in the bout by distracting Styles. Near the end, both men fought on the top rope with Styles getting the advantage. He then set up Williams for his Styles Clash maneuver <b>and</b> <b>jumped</b> off, slamming Williams face-first into the mat from the top rope. Styles followed with a pin, thus winning the match and retaining the TNA X Division Championship.|$|E
5|$|The lack of patrolling by MacGregor's troops {{allowed the}} Spanish to march {{straight}} into Porto Bello early on 30 April 1819. MacGregor {{was still in}} bed when the Spaniards found his riflemen drilling in the main square and opened fire. Awoken by the noise, MacGregor threw his bed and blankets from the window onto the beach below <b>and</b> <b>jumped</b> out after them, then attempted to paddle out to his ships on a log. He passed out and would probably have drowned {{had he not been}} picked up and brought aboard the Hero by one of his naval officers. MacGregor would claim that on regaining consciousness he immediately raised his standard over the Hero, then despatched runners to Rafter ordering him not to surrender. The version of events favoured by Sinclair is that Rafter received orders to this effect only after he had himself contacted MacGregor on the Hero. Rafter, in the fort with 200 men, kept up a steady barrage and waited for his commander to fire on the royalists from the ships—but to the colonel's astonishment MacGregor instead ordered his fleet to turn about and made for the high seas. Abandoned, Colonel Rafter and the remnants of MacGregor's army {{had no choice but to}} surrender; most of the surviving officers and troops entered miserable existences in captivity. Rafter was ultimately shot with 11 other officers for conspiring to escape.|$|E

5|$|John Wilkes Booth had {{originally}} planned to kidnap Lincoln, and recruited conspirators, including Lewis Powell. Having found {{no opportunity to}} abduct the president, on April 14, 1865, Booth assigned Powell to assassinate Seward, with George Atzerodt to kill Vice President Johnson and himself to kill Lincoln, which would slay the three {{senior members of the}} Executive Branch. Accordingly, another member of the conspiracy, David Herold, led Powell to the Seward home on horseback and was responsible for holding Powell's horse while he committed the attack. Seward had been hurt in an accident some days before, and Powell gained entry to the home on the excuse he was delivering medicine to the injured man, but was stopped {{at the top of the}} stairs by Frederick Seward, who insisted Powell give him the medicine. Powell instead attempted to fire on Frederick, and beat him over the head with the barrel of his gun when it misfired. Powell burst through the door, threw Fanny Seward (the secretary's daughter) to one side, <b>and</b> <b>jumped</b> on the bed, and stabbed William Seward in the face and neck five times. A soldier assigned to guard and nurse the secretary, Private George F. Robinson, jumped on Powell, forcing him from the bed. Powell fled, stabbing a messenger, Emerick Hansell, as he went, to find that Herold, panicked by the screams from the house, had left with both horses. Seward was at first thought dead, but revived enough to instruct Robinson to send for the police and lock the house until they arrived.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was a King of the Mountain {{match for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship with Kevin Nash as Special Guest Ringside Enforcer between then-champion Samoa Joe and the challengers Booker T, Christian Cage, Rhino, and Robert Roode. In a King of the Mountain match, the {{objective}} is to climb a ladder and hang the championship belt on a hook above the ring. In order to do so, a wrestler must first qualify by either pinning or making another wrestler submit in the match. A wrestler who is pinned or made to submit is this placed in a penalty box for two minutes. The match is fought under no disqualification rules. Booker T was the first to qualify by pinning Rhino after slamming him back-first into the mat with his signature Book End maneuver. Rhino was this placed in the penalty box. Roode was the next to qualify after bashing a ladder Cage held with a chair into him and following with a pin. Immediately afterwards, Rhino pinned Roode with a roll-up pin to qualify. Later, Joe held Booker T in his signature Coquina Clutch submission hold when Cage ascended a padded turnbuckle <b>and</b> <b>jumped</b> off onto Booker T and Joe. He followed by pinning Booker T to qualify and send Booker T to the penalty box. When Booker T was released from the box, he attacked Nash with the title belt and then attempted to hang it. Nash stopped him and then dropped Booker T back-first against the mat with his signature Jackknife Powerbomb maneuver. Joe was the last to qualify by pinning Roode after slamming him back and neck-first into the mat with his signature Muscle Buster maneuver. Joe then hung the title belt at 19 minutes and 49 seconds to win the competition.|$|E
5|$|The {{secondary}} rivalry {{was between}} The Undertaker and Mr. Kennedy. On the September 8, 2006 episode of SmackDown!, Kennedy {{announced that he}} was looking for a new opponent, one that he had never faced before. Long informed Kennedy that he knew a SmackDown! superstar that had never faced Kennedy, The Undertaker. A match was made between the two for No Mercy, in which Kennedy defeated Undertaker by disqualification. At Survivor Series, Kennedy once again defeated Undertaker in a First Blood match. On the December 1 episode of SmackDown!, Undertaker fought Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) in a match where neither wrestler won. During the match, MVP was scripted to attempt escaping from the ring, but Kennedy caught him during the process and tried to throw him back into the ring. MVP instead threw Kennedy in. Undertaker then kicked Kennedy in the face, and Kane attacked MVP at ringside. The following week as Kennedy was in the ring, the hearse, appearing to have nobody in the driver's seat, drove into the arena; suddenly, The Undertaker appeared from the back of the hearse, as Kennedy sprung from the ring. Later that night, Kane defeated Kennedy by disqualification after MVP interfered on Kennedy's behalf. On the December 15 episode of SmackDown!, The Undertaker and Kane teamed together to face Kennedy and MVP in a tag team match, which ended in neither team winning. Kennedy knocked Kane down in the aisle <b>and</b> <b>jumped</b> into the driver's seat of the hearse that had been at ringside for the match, and threatened to run him over with it however the Undertaker appeared in the passenger side seat scaring Kennedy off.|$|E
