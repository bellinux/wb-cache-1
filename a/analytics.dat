40|$|Prior {{research}} has found that persons who favor more <b>analytic</b> modes of thought are less religious. We propose that individual differences in <b>analytic</b> thought are associated with reduced religious beliefs particularly when <b>analytic</b> thought is measured (hence, primed) first. The current study provides a direct replication of prior evidence that individual differences in <b>analytic</b> thinking are negatively related to religious beliefs when <b>analytic</b> thought is measured before religious beliefs. When religious belief is measured before <b>analytic</b> thinking, however, the negative relationship is reduced to non-significance, suggesting that the link between <b>analytic</b> thought and religious belief is more tenuous than previously reported. The current study suggests that whereas inducing <b>analytic</b> processing may reduce religious belief, more <b>analytic</b> thinkers are not necessarily less religious. The potential for measurement order to inflate the inverse correlation between <b>analytic</b> thinking and religious beliefs deserves additional consideration...|$|R
