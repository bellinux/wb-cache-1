Although he was seriously wounded {{in the back and}} legs by fragments, and was blown several feet by the concussion, he crawled back to his comrade and administered first aid to him. Although suffering severe pain from his multiple wounds, he refused to seek medical aid for himself until he had completed treatment of his comrade, and then, refusing a stretcher, crawled part of the way to the aid station.|$|E

50|$|Guerrillas in all {{the various}} revolutionary {{movements}} {{used a variety of}} mines, often combining anti-tank with <b>anti-personnel</b> <b>mines</b> to ambush Portuguese formations with devastating results. A common tactic was to plant large anti-vehicle mines in a roadway bordered by obvious cover, such as an irrigation ditch, then seed the ditch with <b>anti-personnel</b> <b>mines.</b> Detonation of the vehicle mine would cause Portuguese troops to deploy and seek cover in the ditch, where the <b>anti-personnel</b> <b>mines</b> would cause further casualties.|$|R

25|$|Criticism of United States {{foreign policy}} {{encompasses}} {{a wide range}} of opinions and views on failures and shortcoming of United States policies and actions. There is a partly-held sense in America which views America as qualitatively different from other nations and therefore cannot be judged by the same standards as other countries; this belief is sometimes termed American exceptionalism and {{can be traced to the}} so-called Manifest destiny. American exceptionalism has widespread implications and transcribes into disregard to the international norms, rules and laws in U.S. foreign policy. For example, the U.S. refused to ratify a number of important international treaties such as Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, and American Convention on Human Rights; did not join the <b>Anti-Personnel</b> <b>Mine</b> Ban Convention; and routinely conducts drone attacks and cruise missile strikes around the globe. American exceptionalism is sometimes linked with hypocrisy; for example, the U.S. keeps a huge stockpile of nuclear weapons while urging other nations not to get them, and justifies that it can make an exception to a policy of non-proliferation.|$|E

500|$|While the {{electronic}} barrier program in Laos {{became the most}} visible part of the anti-infiltration program, the physical barrier project in South Vietnam was largely abandoned after 1968 in favor of mobile operations. The SPOS outlined in the original Dyemarker plan envisioned a virtual defensive wall stretching from the South China Sea to Dong Ha Mountain. The plan called for a fence, a line of twin steel apron and barbed steel tape, an <b>anti-personnel</b> <b>mine</b> field, a passive sensor detection system, and another line of twin steel apron and barbed steel tape, to [...] "trace" [...] this path, providing a physical obstacle to enemy infiltration. Observation posts and towers would line the route, and six specifically designed strong points would be constructed, with associated battalion base areas. A combined force of a single US Marine Corps Regiment and a single ARVN Regiment were to man these positions.|$|E
500|$|Land mines {{were first}} {{used by the}} JNA in early 1991, before its {{withdrawal}} from Croatia, to protect military barracks and other facilities. Even JNA facilities located in urban centres were secured in this way, using mines such as the PROM-1 bounding mine and MRUD directional <b>anti-personnel</b> <b>mine.</b> The Croatian Army (HV) and Croatian police began laying land mines in late 1991, relying heavily on them to stop advances by the JNA and the Army of the RSK (ARSK) until early 1992. These early minefields were laid with little documentation. In 1992 the ARSK increased its use of mines to secure the front line, largely due to its limited number of troops. Consequently, the ARSK constructed static defensive lines (consisting of trenches, bunkers and large numbers of mines designed to protect thinly-manned defences) to delay HV offensives. This approach was necessitated by the limited depth of RSK territory {{and the lack of}} reserves available with which to counterattack (or block) breaches of its defensive line, which meant that the ARSK was unable to employ defence in depth tactics. [...] The combination of poor documentation of minefield locations and the lack of markings (or fencing) led to frequent injuries to military personnel caused by mines laid by friendly forces. It is estimated that a total of 1.5million land mines were laid during the war.|$|E

The reality is stands to reason, because the implementation of the state responsibility principle for the total prohibition <b>anti-personnel</b> <b>mines</b> are less than the maximum and seemed to slow.

2500|$|According to {{explosives}} experts, Basayev {{was most}} likely a victim of careless handling of the mine, {{but it is also}} not out of the question that the FSB could have been involved– as they would claim {{in the aftermath of the}} detonation. This could have happened if the shipment of weapons was seized and the smugglers detained; in forcing the captured smugglers to cooperate, an ordinary-looking <b>anti-personnel</b> <b>mine</b> rigged with an extra-sensitive fuse or radio-controlled detonator could have been inserted amongst the cargo. The device almost certainly would have caused suspicion when discovered in the shipment, which might explain why Basayev stopped to inspect it, at that point triggering the explosion. It was also not ruled out that an unknown FSB operative set off the blast by remote control, but in the event that this was indeed the case, it almost assuredly would not have been a [...] "targeted" [...] killing, as identifying Basayev in the dark– even with the aid of night-vision goggles– would have been exceedingly difficult. Thus, experts have concluded that if it was a remote-controlled blast, it was intended to eliminate the weapons shipment and whoever the recipients were, rather than specifically Basayev.|$|E

The device consisted of a horizontally oriented cone filled with [...] of TNT explosive into which was embedded approximately 80small sharp-edged steel cubes. It was fitted to the inward-facing side of the border fence at intervals of around [...] The device was triggered if the tripwire connected to the firing mechanism was pulled or cut. It was potentially lethal to a maximum range of around , though its effective lethal range was 25 metres (82ft). On one occasion, when a deer fell victim to an SM-70, an observer noted that [...] "an approximately 5 meter area appeared {{as if it had been}} worked over by a rake." [...] By 1976, SM-70s had been installed along 248km of the border and conventional minefields lined another 491km. The mines were eventually removed by the end of 1984 in the face of international condemnation of the East German government.|$|E
