60|$|Marilla looked scandalized {{and glanced}} apprehensively <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> {{the twins were}} not within earshot. They {{came around the corner}} of the house just then.|$|E
6000|$|... "You ask me an {{embarrassing}} question," [...] he whispered, looking <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> {{that no one}} overheard. [...] "Although I pose {{as one of the}} nobility, I am, as a matter of fact, a great fraud!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Sammy Jay {{winked at}} each of the others. He cleared his throat and looked all <b>around,</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that no one else was near. Then he leaned forward and whispered: [...] "Let's invite {{ourselves}} to the party." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Ball glanced <b>around</b> him, <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> {{that no one}} {{was within}} {{shouting}} distance.|$|R
6000|$|The captain now winked in his turn, looked <b>around</b> him <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> {{no one was}} listening, {{and laying}} a finger on his nose, he answered, in a much lower key than was usual for him-- ...|$|R
60|$|Nikasti assented silently. Fischer glanced <b>around</b> {{as though}} <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> {{that they were}} still alone.|$|R
60|$|When the men {{got ready}} to turn in for the night, {{one or the other}} might take a fancy to have a look <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> they had no unwelcome visitors, in which case the spies would be discovered.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{might as}} well {{tell you how it}} is," [...] {{continued}} Roger, as he drove up to the little railroad station. He looked <b>around,</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that no outsiders were listening. [...] "You know father comes up for re-election this fall." ...|$|E
60|$|Then he {{returned}} {{up the mountain}} and, after gazing cautiously <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> he was not observed, he touched a spring in a rock and it swung slowly backward, disclosing a broad passageway. This he entered, swinging the rock in place behind him.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Hamilton Fynes {{leaned over}} the wooden counter which {{separated}} him from {{the interior of the}} office. Before he spoke, he glanced <b>around</b> as though <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that he had not forgotten to close the door.|$|R
5000|$|Sean Barrett, an {{economist}} at Trinity College, Dublin described Tansey as a [...] "'dedicated writer' who 'stayed <b>around</b> until 1am' <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> the newspaper was printed properly", {{in an interview with}} the RTÃ‰ Radio 1 show, Morning Ireland.|$|R
5000|$|The main {{exhibit is}} a 1,000 m2, [...] tank with four large 49 m2 acrylic windows on its sides, and smaller focus windows {{strategically}} located <b>around</b> it <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> it {{is a constant}} component throughout the exhibit space. It is 7 m deep, which allows pelagic swimmers to swim above the bottom dwellers, and provides the illusion of the open ocean. About 100 species {{from around the world}} are kept in this tank, including sharks, rays, barracudas, groupers, and moray eels. One of the main attractions is a large sunfish.|$|R
6000|$|Looking <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> {{that no one}} {{was within}} hearing, he went up very close to the old driver and said, in almost a whisper: [...] "I was feelin' bad 'cause I just come from Mr. and Mrs. Treat, an' I've been sayin' goodby to them. I'm goin' to run away tonight." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At {{the very}} idea of me with my short legs {{trying to keep up with}} you," [...] replied Danny. [...] "I wish you would sit up and take a good look all <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that Old Man Coyote and Reddy Fox and Redtail the Hawk and Black Pussy, that pesky Cat from Farmer Brown's, are nowhere about." ...|$|E
60|$|MURRAY. And I {{can send}} them out right away. They're all typed, thanks to you. That's what's brought me luck, I know. I {{never had a}} bit by myself. (Then, after a quick glance <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> they are alone, he bends down and kisses her.) There! A token of gratitude--even if it is against the rules.|$|E
60|$|Then {{a curious}} thing happened, {{for a man}} who was {{crossing}} the street seemed to see the Challoners and, turning suddenly, stepped back behind a passing cab. They had their backs to him when he went on, but he looked <b>around,</b> as if <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> he had not been observed, before he entered the hotel.|$|R
5000|$|Since March 2012, AARP's You've Earned a Say {{campaign}} {{has sought to}} foster nonpartisan conversations about how to strengthen Social Security and Medicare. The Richmond (VA) Times-Dispatch reported, [...] "AARP took the debate about Medicare and Social Security from what it called behind closed doors in Washington {{to a series of}} town hall meetings <b>around</b> the country <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> retirees have a voice in the discussion." ...|$|R
50|$|The story {{centers on}} Paul Santee, a reclusive Vietnam War veteran and gun collector, who lives {{isolated}} {{on the outskirts}} of Grantville. Set in the weeks immediately after the Ring of Fire, Santee remains unaware of his current situation until being met by Eddie Cantrell, one of several outreach workers combing the remote regions <b>around</b> Grantville <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> everyone is informed about the Grantville Emergency Committee's edicts, and soliciting resources for the community. Furthermore, Santee learns that Frank Jackson wants him to join Grantville's army as a trainer of cadre, as he has more combat and years of general military experience than everyone else in town put together. Initially Santee flatly refuses to reenter military service.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{monotony of}} our lives is now likely to be interrupted, Mr Wilder," [...] {{commenced}} the former, first glancing his eye <b>around,</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> they were alone. [...] "I have seen enough of your spirit and steadiness, to be sure, that, should accident disable me to conduct the fortunes of these people, my authority will fall into firm and able hands." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Lord was {{thoroughly}} enraged when Toby left the wagon, {{and saw the}} boy just as he stepped to the ground. The angry man gave a quick glance <b>around,</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that none of Toby's friends were in sight, and then caught him by the coat collar and commenced to whip him severely with the small rubber cane that he usually carried.|$|E
6000|$|There he {{cautiously}} {{crept into}} {{a thicket of}} young spruce and, his heart beating like a trip-hammer with excitement, carefully parted the branches until {{he could get a}} clear view. His hands trembled as he drew out the glasses. Would he discover anything, or had he been wrought up to such a pitch over nothing? The little spruce leaped out clear and distinct as he got the focus. [...] "Ha!" [...] The exclamation was wholly involuntary and he experienced an absurd impulse to look <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that he had not been overheard, although {{he knew that he was}} absolutely alone.|$|E
500|$|Vespertine is {{an album}} {{made by a}} {{character}} who's very introvert.(sic) And it's about the universe inside every person. This time <b>around,</b> I wanted <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that the scenery of the songs is not like a mountain or a city or outside, it's inside, so it's very internal. So I guess all three videos are very internal. [...] Sort of how you communicate with {{the world in a}} very intimate, personal way.|$|R
30|$|The facilities, {{resources}} {{should be}} located <b>around</b> the urban <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that all demand points are covered {{and all the}} needs are met. It is noted that the facility locations are important for the organizations and the governments <b>to</b> control and <b>make</b> the best urban area for a city. So, some searches are done on solving the facility location problems. Performing spatial clustering has used the Euclidean distance between two points as the dissimilarity function.|$|R
50|$|To {{manage the}} land, {{the state had}} created a Forest Commission, making New York second only to California in having a state-level {{forestry}} agency. Most of its members were either openly or covertly connected to timber interests, however, and routinely approved dodges <b>around</b> the legislation <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> logging would continue. In 1893 the legislature retroactively approved many of these practices by giving the commission the right to sell timber from the lands and trade them as it saw fit.|$|R
60|$|He {{was driven}} in silence {{back to the}} Dormy House. When he arrived there the place was deserted. The other men were lunching at the golf club. He made his way slowly to the impromptu shed which served for a garage. His own car was {{standing}} there. He looked all <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that he was absolutely alone. Then he lifted up the cushion by the driving-seat. Carefully folded and arranged in the corner were the horn-rimmed spectacles and the silk handkerchief {{of the man who}} was lying at Market Burnham with a bullet through his forehead.|$|E
6000|$|Now {{this was}} a {{beautiful}} summer day and Reddy knew that in summer men and boys seldom hunt foxes. [...] "It's only Bowser the Hound," [...] thought Reddy, [...] "and when I've had a good run, I'll play a trick on him so that he will lose my track." [...] So Reddy didn't use {{his eyes as he}} should have done. You see, he thought himself so smart that he had grown careless. Yes, Sir, Reddy Fox had grown careless. He kept looking back to see where Bowser the Hound was, but didn't look <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that no other danger was near.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hush!" [...] {{whispered the}} High Coco-Lorum, looking uneasily <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> {{they were not}} overheard. [...] "In reality, I am the King, but the people don't know it. They think they rule themselves, {{but the fact is}} I have {{everything}} my own way. No one else knows anything about our laws, and so I make the laws to suit myself. If any oppose me or question my acts, I tell them it's the law and that settles it. If I called myself King, however, and wore a crown and lived in royal style, the people would not like me and might do me harm. As the High Coco-Lorum of Thi, I am considered a very agreeable person." ...|$|E
50|$|Currently {{the fashion}} {{industry}} relies more on mass market sales. The mass market caters {{for a wide range}} of customers, producing ready-to-wear garments using trends set by the famous names in fashion. They often wait <b>around</b> a season <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> a style is going to catch on before producing their own versions of the original look. In order to save money and time, they use cheaper fabrics and simpler production techniques which can easily be done by machine. The end product can therefore be sold much more cheaply.|$|R
50|$|As the DHIII {{does not}} have wheels, it does not land like most {{airplanes}} do. It {{is important that the}} vehicle lands as close to horizontally as possible. To perform a proper skid landing, the operator must take into account, the angle of descent, the wind, and the terrain on which the vehicle is landing. The operator of the DHIII may bring the device <b>around</b> multiple times <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> the landing goes smoothly. The aircraft is designed to break apart on impact, to dissipate its kinetic energy without causing damage to the components so they can be reused.|$|R
40|$|For {{the last}} five years {{universities}} in Australia and New Zealand have experimented {{with the use of the}} Engineers Without Borders (EWB) Challenge in their first-year engineering courses. In evaluating the initiative we asked 'What works for whom under what circumstances?' Here we report specifically on the third phase of the project which examined three attempts to embed the findings of the evaluation in the next year's teaching: one concerned adjustments to assessment to improve alignment; another concerned the use of the EWB Challenge projects in a multidisciplinary subject outside of engineering; and the third set of changes revolved <b>around</b> attempts <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> a large teaching team was implementing the projects in a consistent way. In all of these cases it emerged that maintaining communication and collaboration amongst stakeholders was critically important and practically difficult. We conclude that embedding the results of research may require as much time and attention as actually doing the research and reflect on how practical strategies may be developed. ...|$|R
6000|$|Then Striped Chipmunk {{had hidden}} himself {{where he could}} see all that happened. He had seen Happy Jack look all <b>around,</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> {{that no one was}} near, and then tear open the little round doorway of Chatterer's {{storehouse}} until it was big enough for him to squeeze through. He had seen Chatterer come up, fly into a rage, and pull Happy Jack out by the tail. Indeed, he had had to clap both hands over his mouth to keep from laughing out loud. Then Happy Jack had turned tail and run away with Chatterer after him, shouting [...] "Thief" [...] and [...] "Robber" [...] {{at the top of his}} voice, and this had tickled Striped Chipmunk still more, for he knew that Chatterer himself is one of the greatest thieves in the Green Forest. So he sat on the mossy old log and laughed and laughed and laughed.|$|E
6000|$|Since the {{war broke}} out, his zest for life {{has become almost}} terrible. He can {{scarcely}} lift a newspaper and read of a hero without remembering that he knows some one of the name. The Soldiers' Rest he is connected with was once a china emporium, and (mark my words), he had bought his tea service at it. Such is life {{when you are in}} the thick of it. Sometimes he feels that he is part of a gigantic spy drama. In the course of his extraordinary comings and goings he meets with Great Personages, of course, and is the confidential recipient of secret news. Before imparting the news he does not, as you might expect, first smile expansively; on the contrary, there comes over his face an awful solemnity, which, however, means the same thing. When divulging the names of the personages, he first looks <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that no suspicious character is about, and then, lowering his voice, tells you, 'I had that from Mr. Farthing himself--he is the secretary of the Bethnal Green Branch,--h'sh!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{he told a}} queer {{story about}} a nugget of gold brought down to this place from Alaska. He was very mysterious, and at last he said the nugget was right down in my cellar, and if I'd dig it up fer him he'd give me half. At first I thought he was fooling, or wasn't just right in his mind, but a nugget of gold--even a little one--isn't to be sneezed at, and it wouldn't cost me nuthing to go down cellar and look. So I starts {{to go down the}} stairs when he says to be careful, that he would look <b>around,</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> nobuddy was a-spying on him. He said the nugget was in the {{northwest}} corner. I went down and the next thing I knew I heard a strange cry upstairs. 'You shan't rob me! The nugget is mine!' yells that fellow and bang! goes that trap door, and then he up and bolts it fast, so I couldn't open it. I calls to let me out, and he calls back for me to keep quiet until he got some friends, so I couldn't rob him of that nugget. Then he slammed around upstairs here something awful. At last he went away; and that's the last I seen or heard of him." ...|$|E
5000|$|Torrio, having {{undergone}} emergency surgery, recovered {{slowly from}} the assassination attempt. Capone had men guarding Torrio <b>around</b> the clock <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> his beloved mentor was safe. Throughout this entire ordeal, Torrio, observing the gangland principle of [...] "omertÃ " [...] (total silence), never mentioned {{the names of}} his assailants. After his release from the hospital, Torrio served {{a year in jail}} for Prohibition violations. Throughout his reign as boss of the Chicago mob, Torrio had witnessed the massive increase in violence within organized crime. The near-death experience frightened him badly, and combined with his prison sentence and the increasing difficulty in his work, it persuaded Torrio to retire while he was still alive.|$|R
50|$|Finally, {{the robbers}} put {{the man in}} a bag and lugged him to the sea, but first they rested in a church because it was hot. A swineherd with a herd of pigs came by, and the {{shoemaker}} told {{that he was in}} the bag because they wanted him to marry the king's daughter and he wouldn't. The swineherd traded places with him, the shoemaker left with the pigs, and the robbers threw the bag into the sea. When the thieves later saw the shoemaker with the herd of pigs, he told them there were pigs in the sea and they had to tie a stone <b>around</b> their necks <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> they reached those depths. They did so and drowned.|$|R
60|$|I {{returned}} to the sawing process, {{and at the end}} of half an hour succeeded in severing the rope. The rest was easy. My hands once free, it was a matter of minutes to loosen my legs and to take the gag out of my mouth. I ran <b>around</b> the island <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> it WAS an island and not by any chance a portion of the mainland. An island it certainly was, one of the Marin group, fringed with a sandy beach and surrounded by a sea of mud. Nothing remained but to wait till daylight and to keep warm; for it was a cold, raw night for California, with just enough wind to pierce the skin and cause one to shiver.|$|R
