25|$|Vastly {{outnumbered by}} the natives, the humans {{are forced to}} attempt a perilous return to known space by {{reversing}} the erroneous transition. Max must pilot the ship; he must also supply the missing <b>astrogation</b> tables from his eidetic memory. To add to his burdens, the remaining officers inform Max that he must take command, as only an astrogator can be the captain. The pressure is immense, but Max succeeds and the ship returns to known space.|$|E
25|$|When, through Ellie's machinations, the ship's {{officers}} {{discover that}} Max had learned <b>astrogation</b> from his uncle, Max is {{promoted to the}} command deck.

50|$|In the MMORPG Pirate Galaxy, stargates allow travel between star systems. Each stargate must be {{unlocked}} by {{the player}} upon completing every storyline mission in a star system and stealing an <b>astrogation</b> chip from an enemy mantis, usually after {{some sort of}} boss battle involving a large mantis ship. Each planetary system, including Sol solar system has one each.|$|E

50|$|The story {{concerns}} Andrew Jackson Libby (here nicknamed Pinky, for his red hair, {{but later}} nicknamed Slipstick), a boy from Earth with extraordinary mathematical ability but meager education. Finding few opportunities on Earth, he joins the Cosmic Construction Corps, a future military-led {{version of the}} Civilian Conservation Corps employing out-of-work youth to colonize the Solar System. With a group of other inexperienced young men he is assigned to a ship traveling to the asteroid belt where their task is to move an asteroid into a more convenient orbit between Mars and Earth. Pinky comes to the Captain's attention {{during the process of}} blasting holes in the asteroid for rocket engines when Pinky realizes that a mistake has been made in calculating the size of the charge, preventing a catastrophic blast. He is assigned to the ship's <b>astrogation</b> computer. During the trip back to Earth, the computer malfunctions and Libby takes over, performing all the complex calculations in his head. The asteroid is settled successfully into its final orbit.|$|E
