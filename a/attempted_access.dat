40|$|Enantiopure α-alkyl-substituted {{aldehydes}} {{are widely}} recognised as important building blocks in synthesis. Despite this, methods to prepare such substrates are limited. Strategically, asymmetric intermolecular S N 2 α-alkylation represents a highly straightforward transformation, but still remains an elusive feat. This thesis describes {{efforts to address}} this challenge, with <b>attempted</b> <b>access</b> to enantioenriched α-alkyl aldehydes by way of C -alkylation of chiral, non-racemic, hindered aldenamines using simple alkyl halides. Enamines derived from four types of auxiliary (a tropane, an oxazolidine, a pyrrolidine and a homotropane) have been prepared, and their alkylation profile examined. While the desired levels of asymmetric induction were not attained, use of the tropane and homotropane auxiliaries, which differ only by a single methylene group, interestingly, gave complimentary diastereocontrol during alkylation with EtI. The observed stereoselectivity is supported by density functional studies performed for ethylation of both enamines. Additionally, {{in the course of}} preparing the homotropane a highly efficient asymmetric synthesis of a homotropinone bearing gem -α-substitution has been developed.

[Full text {{of this article is}} not available in the UHRA]In this paper we introduce a distributed object-based document architecture called DODA in order to illustrate a novel strategy for achieving both high availability and high integrity in the context of open processing distributed between mutually suspicious domains without a common management hierarchy. Our approach to availability is to structure documents into small components called folios {{in such a way as}} to allow the maximum opportunity for concurrent processing, and to allow these components to be freely replicated and distributed. Integrity conflicts are resolved using an optimistic form of control called optimistic integrity control (OIC) applied to recoverable work units. Our approach to security is to shrinkwrap the document components using cryptographic checksums, and to provide a set of building block components called functionaries which a group of users can combine in such a way as to provide each user with a means of ensuring that an agreed notion of integrity is enforced while relying upon a minimum of non-local trust. In particular, we do not rely upon a trusted computing base or a shared system infrastructure. The local availability of document versions and of the resources to process them are completely under local user control. The lack of availability of the functionaries does not have severe consequences, and the presence of mutual suspicion makes it easier to ensure that users can trust the functionaries to provide the intended service. A major benefit of using OIC is that it allows the integration of untrusted components such as filestores and directory servers into the system. In particular, an untrusted soft locking service can be used in order to reduce the number of concurrency conflicts, and untrusted security components can be used to screen out <b>attempted</b> <b>access</b> control violations...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study of}} realizing commercial security, as defined in the Clark and Wilson Model (CW 87), using Object-Oriented (O-O) concepts.;Role-based security is implied in the Clark and Wilson model in which specified operations are grouped to compose roles. This approach to protection is suitable for applications involving large numbers of users with overlapping user requirements and/or {{where there is a}} large number of objects. It {{presents a}} flexible (hence adaptive) means for enforcing differing ranges of security policies. It enforces the principle of least privilege, hence minimizing the risk of Trojan horse attacks.;Consequently, in part, this work focuses on role-based protection, formalizes the role concept and proposes a model for role organization and administration. This model, intended to ease access rights administration, is defined by a set of properties. Algorithms for role administration are presented. These guarantee the properties of the role organization model. Role-based protection is also studied with respect to traditional protection schemes. One aspect of this enquiry focuses on information flow analysis in role-based security systems; the other addresses the realization of mandatory access control using role-based protection. This involves the imposition of acyclic information flows and rules that ensure secrecy. It demonstrates the strength of the role-based protection approach.;A role is a named collection of responsibilities and functions which we term privileges. Execution of one or more privileges of a role facilitates access to information available via the role. Access to information is realized both via user authorization to the role and the role 2 ̆ 7 s privilege list. A role exists as a separate entity from the role-holder and/or the role administrator. In determining role organization, role relationships are used based on privilege sharing. This results in an acyclic role graph with roles being nodes and edges being role relationships. These relationships help us infer those privileges of a role that are implicitly defined. Analysis of this model indicates that it can simulate lattice-like models, hierarchical structures and privilege graphs.;Principles from the O-O paradigm are utilized to impose segmented access to object information. This approach uses methods to 2 ̆ 2 window 2 ̆ 2 an object 2 ̆ 7 s interface to facilitate segmented access to object data through different roles, and hence different users. By defining these methods to suit the intended functionality and associating them with specific roles, we in effect distribute the object interface to different roles and users. An object model is proposed as the basis of O-O executions. Further, in order to impose the well-formed transaction (WFTs) requirement, a transaction model is proposed that imposes transactional properties on method executions. By use of transaction scripts we can design executions to realize desirable outcomes.;Separation of duty is another major requirement in the Clark and Wilson model. It requires object history for its enforcement. Our proposal ensures that objects track their history. Moreover, every execution on an object utilizes the object history to determine access and updates the history with any <b>attempted</b> <b>access.</b> (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|E
