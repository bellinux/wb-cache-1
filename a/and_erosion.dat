5|$|Hawaiian volcanoes {{follow a}} {{well-established}} {{life cycle of}} growth <b>and</b> <b>erosion.</b> After a new volcano forms, its lava output gradually increases. Height and activity both peak when the volcano is around 500,000 years old and then rapidly decline. Eventually it goes dormant, and eventually extinct. Erosion then weathers the volcano until it again becomes a seamount.|$|E

Inflammatory lesions <b>and</b> <b>erosions</b> of the {{glans penis}} defined as {{balanitis}} or balanoposthitis constitute a disease {{in which the}} effectiveness of conservative treatment is not sufficient. Objective. To present the therapeutic efficacy of magneto-LED therapy in the treatment, and to present a patient with inflammatory lesions <b>and</b> <b>erosions</b> of the glans penis. Case report. The patient, 68 years old with inflammatory lesions <b>and</b> <b>erosions</b> of the glans penis of 2 – 4 years duration, was previously treated with various methods of local therapy without effect. As {{a result of a}} 32 -week long magneto-LED therapy cycle, complete resolution of skin lesions with subsidence of the burning sensation during urination and reduced swelling and inflammatory erythema of the glans, as well as disappearance of the white coating and unpleasant smell, was achieved. Conclusions. Magneto-LED therapy is an efficient method of treatment of inflammatory lesions <b>and</b> <b>erosions</b> of the glans penis...|$|R

5|$|The bedrock {{under the}} {{watershed}} includes {{part of the}} last exotic terrane, a chain of seamounts, acquired by the North American Plate as it moved west during the Eocene. Known as the Waverly Hills Formation, it lies buried under ash and lava from later volcanic eruptions, sediments from flooding <b>and</b> <b>erosion,</b> and layers of wind-blown silt. Two dormant volcanoes from the Boring Lava Field are in the Tryon Creek watershed.|$|E
5|$|The fern {{thrives in}} thin {{serpentine}} soils on sunny, disturbed habitats such as roadcuts and talus slopes, in dunite and other ultramafic rocks. Anthropogenic disturbance has removed thicker soils and increased sun exposure {{in many of}} these sites; for instance, many of the Quebec stations are in asbestos mines, both abandoned and active. In more natural habitats, frost weathering <b>and</b> <b>erosion</b> may promote rock fall and maintain suitable habitat.|$|E
5000|$|Surface <b>and</b> bulk <b>erosion</b> are two {{different}} forms of erosion that describe how a degrading polymer erodes. In surface erosion, the polymer degrades from the exterior surface. The inside of the material does not degrade until all the surrounding material around it has been degraded. [...] In bulk erosion, degradation occurs throughout the whole material equally. Both the surface and {{the inside of the}} material degrade. [...] Surface <b>erosion</b> <b>and</b> bulk <b>erosion</b> are not exclusive, many materials undergo a combination of surface <b>and</b> bulk <b>erosion.</b> [...] Therefore, surface <b>and</b> bulk <b>erosion</b> {{can be thought of as}} a spectrum instead of two separate categories.|$|R

40|$|An <b>erosion</b> <b>and</b> {{sedimentation}} model, <b>erosion</b> <b>and</b> sedimentation estimation tool (EROSET), {{was developed}} and applied to a watershed in Happy Valley, South Australia. The model simulates the dynamics of event runoff, soil detachment, and transport processes. The <b>erosion</b> <b>and</b> sedimentation model is able to predict watershed <b>erosion</b> <b>and</b> deposition for storm events at an element as well as watershed scale. The model {{was developed and}} incorporated into an existing rainfall-runoff model based on a contour-based digital elevation framework. It combines {{the use of the}} USLE data source <b>and</b> extended <b>erosion</b> <b>and</b> transportation modeling into a distributed <b>and</b> intra storm <b>erosion</b> <b>and</b> deposition analysis. This results in storm-based, time-variant, distributed <b>erosion</b> <b>and</b> deposition modeling in the watershed for both storm-based and long-term sediment estimation. The modeling can better enable land managers to identify the areas in a watershed where <b>erosion</b> <b>and</b> deposition may occur. The modeled processes and results can be related to total storm erosion estimated by MUSLE, although they operate on different temporal and spatial frames. Satisfactory modeling results were obtained with very limited calibration which compares well with other studies. H. Sun, P. S. Cornish and T. M. Daniel...|$|R
5|$|A {{long period}} of uplift <b>and</b> <b>erosion</b> was {{concurrent}} with and followed the above events, creating a major unconformity. Sediments worn off the Death Valley region were shed both east and west and carried by wind and water; the eastern sediments ended up in Colorado and are now famous for their dinosaur fossils. No Jurassic to Eocene sedimentary formations exist in the area except for some possibly Jurassic-age volcanic rock around Butte Valley. Large parts of previously deposited formations were removed; probably by streams that washed the sediment into the Cretaceous Seaway that longitudinally divided North America to the east.|$|E

Very sensitive to dieback, B. verticillata (like most other western Australian banksias) perishes quickly in humid conditions or poor drainage. It has been grafted successfully onto Banksia integrifolia. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 19 to 49 days to germinate.|$|E

5|$|From {{the end of}} the Mesozoic to present, {{the region}} went through a series of uplifts and erosional sequences. Commencing 66million years ago the Laramide orogeny was a period of mountain-building <b>and</b> <b>erosion</b> in western North America that created the ancestral Rocky Mountains. This cycle of uplift <b>and</b> <b>erosion</b> left behind one of the most {{complete}} non-marine Cenozoic rock sequences found in North America. Conglomerate rocks composed of quartzite and interspersed with mudstone and sandstones were deposited during erosion from a now vanished mountain range that existed to the northwest of the current Teton Range. These deposits also have trace quantities of gold and mercury. During the Eocene and Oligocene, volcanic eruptions from the ancestral Absaroka Range buried the region under various volcanic deposits. Sedimentary basins developed in the region due to drop faulting, creating an ancestral Jackson Hole and by the Pliocene (10million years ago), an ancestral Jackson Lake known as Teewinot Lake. During the Quaternary, landslides, erosion and glacial activity deposited soils and rock debris throughout the Snake River valley of Jackson Hole and left behind terminal moraines which impound the current lakes. The most recent example of rapid alteration to the landscape occurred in 1925 just east of the park, when the Gros Ventre landslide was triggered by spring melt from a heavy snowpack as well as heavy rain.|$|E
5|$|In {{areas with}} {{wet and dry}} seasons, soil {{nutrients}} diminish <b>and</b> <b>erosion</b> increases during the wet season. Animals have adaptation and survival strategies for the wetter regime. The previous dry season leads to food shortages into the wet season, as the crops have yet to mature. Developing countries have noted that their populations show seasonal weight fluctuations due to food shortages seen before the first harvest, which occurs late in the wet season. Rain may be harvested {{through the use of}} rainwater tanks; treated to potable use or for non-potable use indoors or for irrigation. Excessive rain during short periods of time can cause flash floods.|$|E

It was not explored until Ferdinand Hayden and his team surveyed it in 1873. At the time it was known as Hunter Pass.|$|E

50|$|Rainfall, and {{the surface}} runoff which may result from rainfall, {{produces}} four main types of soil erosion: splash erosion, sheet <b>erosion,</b> rill <b>erosion,</b> <b>and</b> gully <b>erosion.</b> Splash erosion is generally seen as the first and least severe stage in the soil erosion process, which is followed by sheet erosion, then rill <b>erosion</b> <b>and</b> finally gully <b>erosion</b> (the most severe of the four).|$|R

Indigenous peoples lived throughout the upper reaches of the basin as well.|$|E
5|$|Splash dams, greased chutes, {{railroad}} landings, railroad {{branch lines}} and steam donkey operations {{were among the}} strategies utilized to exploit the watershed's resources of timber. Unfortunately, railroad embankments and fills used to build up tributaries had artificially straightened them in the process, <b>and</b> <b>erosion</b> increased dramatically on the barren hillside, causing many streams to become much siltier than they naturally would be. Nearly all the old-growth forest in the watershed is now gone, and the forests that remain are mostly second-growth stands.|$|E

40|$|The black soil {{region of}} Northeast China has {{suffered}} from severe soil erosion by water. Hillslope <b>and</b> gully <b>erosion</b> are the main erosion types. The objective {{of this research was}} to integrate the assessment of hillslope <b>and</b> gully <b>erosion</b> <b>and</b> explore spatial coupling relations between them in the Mushi River sub-catchment using geographical conditions monitoring (GCM) including remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) techniques. The revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) model and visual satellite image interpretation were used to evaluate hillslope <b>and</b> gully <b>erosion,</b> respectively. The results showed that (1) the study area as a whole had slight erosion due to rill <b>and</b> sheet <b>erosion,</b> but suffered more serious gully erosion, which mainly occurs in cultivated land; (2) GCM contributed to the overall improvement of soil erosion assessment, but the RUSLE model likely overestimates the erosion rate in dry land; (3) the hillslope <b>and</b> gully <b>erosion</b> were stronger on sunny slopes than on shady slopes, and mainly occurred at middle elevations. When the slope was greater than 15 degrees, the slope was not the main factor restricting the erosion, while at steeper slopes, the dominant forest land significantly reduced the soil loss; (4) trends of gully <b>erosion</b> intensity <b>and</b> density were not consistent with the change in soil erosion intensity. To our knowledge, this study {{was one of the first}} that attempted to integrate gully <b>erosion</b> <b>and</b> hillslope <b>erosion</b> on a watershed scale.
