5|$|The formal {{controversy}} over {{the legality of the}} <b>annexation</b> <b>of</b> Texas {{stems from the fact that}} Congress approved the <b>annexation</b> <b>of</b> Texas as a state, rather than a territory, with simple majorities in each house, instead of annexing the land by Senate treaty, as was done with Native American lands. Tyler's extralegal joint resolution maneuver in 1844 exceeded strict constructionist precepts, but was passed by Congress in 1845 as part of a compromise bill. The success of the joint house Texas annexation set a precedent that would be applied to Hawaii's annexation in 1897.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1930s, Hitler began {{pursuing}} {{an increasingly}} aggressive foreign policy; in 1936 he re-militarized the Rhineland, and in 1938 completed the Anschluss of Austria and the <b>annexation</b> <b>of</b> Czechoslovakia. He then demanded German {{control over the}} city of Danzig, which had become a free city after World War I.|$|E
5|$|Republican President Benjamin Harrison (1889–1893) attempted, in 1893, to annex Hawaii {{through a}} Senate treaty. When this failed, {{he was asked}} to {{consider}} the Tyler joint house precedent; he declined. Democratic President Grover Cleveland (1893–1897) did not pursue the <b>annexation</b> <b>of</b> Hawaii. When President William McKinley took office in 1897, he quickly revived expectations among territorial expansionists when he resubmitted legislation to acquire Hawaii. When the two-thirds Senate support was not forthcoming, committees in the House and Senate explicitly invoked the Tyler precedent for the joint house resolution, which was successfully applied to approve the <b>annexation</b> <b>of</b> Hawaii in July 1898.|$|E
5|$|Tyler {{is buried}} in Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia, near the gravesite of former President James Monroe.

5|$|Work on {{establish}} an administration was initiated by Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld in 1871. After contacting the invested governments, {{he concluded that}} only Russia and Norway would object to an <b>annexation</b> <b>of</b> the island. Fridtjof Nansen's endeavors raised the Norwegian public's consciousness of the Arctic, which again brought forth public support for <b>annexation</b> <b>of</b> Svalbard. Industrialization and permanent settlements on Svalbard began in the 1900s {{with the introduction of}} coal mining. This resulted in the need for jurisdiction. Firstly, there was no means to make a mining claim legal. Secondly, there was a need for conflict resolution, particularly regarding labor conflicts, which often saw the mining company and the workers have different nationalities.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} component to the Holocaust in Lithuania {{was that the}} occupying Nazi German administration fanned antisemitism by blaming the Soviet regime's recent <b>annexation</b> <b>of</b> Lithuania, a year earlier, on the Jewish community. Another significant factor was the large {{extent to which the}} Nazis' design drew upon the physical organization, preparation and execution of their orders by local Lithuanian auxiliaries of the Nazi occupation regime.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the start}} of the 20th century. the City of Omaha annexed several {{surrounding}} communities, including Florence, Dundee and Benson. At the same time, the city annexed all of South Omaha, including the Dahlman and Burlington Road neighborhoods. From its first annexation in 1857 (of East Omaha) to its recent and controversial <b>annexation</b> <b>of</b> Elkhorn, Omaha has continually had an eye towards growth.|$|E
50|$|Among several <b>annexations</b> <b>of</b> {{what had}} been Papeton, Papeton Addition of 0.76 acre was annexed into Colorado Springs on January 1, 1968. It {{was one of several}} small towns—like Ivywild, Pikeview and Roswell—to become part of Colorado Springs.|$|R
50|$|The City Council has {{proposed}} many <b>annexations</b> <b>of</b> nearby unincorporated communities which will increase its population and land area {{over the next}} few years.

50|$|Manfred also {{continued}} his father's {{extension of the}} margravial territory, mostly through <b>annexations</b> <b>of</b> land and castles. In 1322, in return for reorganising the debts of the Del Carretto family, he obtained the castles of Cairo Montenotte, Rocchetta, and Cortemilia.|$|R
5|$|By 1931, many Duval County {{residents}} were warming {{to the idea}} of merging municipal and county governments to reduce bureaucracy, corruption and weak management. As a result, in 1932, citizens of both cities voted for the <b>annexation</b> <b>of</b> South Jacksonville into Jacksonville. While full city-county consolidation was voted down, the efforts of the 1930s set the stage for further attempts, ultimately resulting in the 1968 Jacksonville Consolidation.|$|E
5|$|Deception {{contributed to}} major Soviet {{victories}} including the Battle of Stalingrad, the Battle of Kursk, and Operation Bagration (in Belarus): in these cases, surprise was achieved despite very large concentrations of force, both in attack and in defence.

5|$|Highway27 was {{designated}} as a two lane road travelling north from Highway2 (Lake Shore Boulevard) towards Barrie. As Toronto grew outwards following the <b>annexation</b> <b>of</b> various municipalities, the Ontario Department of Highways (DHO) began planning for a bypass of the city, aptly named the Toronto Bypass. A significant portion of this bypass {{was designed to be}} incorporated into the Transprovincial Highway, now Highway401. The remainder was designed to follow the existing right-of-way of Highway27 between the QEW and Richview Sideroad (now Eglinton Avenue).|$|E
2500|$|The City of Houston annexed the Intercontinental Airport area in 1965. This annexation, {{along with}} the 1965 <b>annexations</b> <b>of</b> the Bayport area, the Fondren Road area, and an area west of Sharpstown, {{resulted}} in a gain of [...] of land for the city limits.|$|R
50|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1980s the planned {{communities}} of Eastlake, Otay Ranch, Milennia, and Rancho del Rey began to develop in the annexed areas east of Interstate 805 and California State Route 125.

50|$|Pitts was {{defeated}} for re-election on November 8, 2005, by Tony Chavonne. Chavonne received around 55% {{of the vote}} in 2005.

5|$|In 1841, Morehead {{was elected}} to the U.S. Senate and served from March 4, 1841 to March 3, 1847.

During his service in the Senate, he defended a federal bank bill and opposed the <b>annexation</b> <b>of</b> Texas, though he supported the U.S.-Mexican War after it began. He was also a staunch supporter of fellow Kentuckian Henry Clay.|$|E
5|$|In 1869, Grant {{proposed}} to annex the independent largely black nation of the Dominican Republic, {{then known as}} Santo Domingo. Previously in 1868, President Andrew Johnson had attempted to annex the Dominican Republic and Santo Domingo, but the House of Representatives defeated two resolutions {{for the protection of}} the Dominican Republic and Santo Domingo and for the <b>annexation</b> <b>of</b> the Dominican Republic. In July, 1869 Grant sent Orville E. Babcock and Rufus Ingalls who negotiated a draft treaty with Dominican Republic President Buenaventura Báez for the <b>annexation</b> <b>of</b> Santo Domingo to the United States and the sale of Samaná Bay for $2million. To keep the island nation and Báez secure in power, Grant ordered naval ships, unauthorized by Congress, to secure the island from invasion and internal insurrection. Báez signed an annexation treaty on November 19, 1869 offered by Babcock under federal State department authorization. Secretary Fish drew up a final draft of the proposal and offered $1.5million to the Dominican national debt, the <b>annexation</b> <b>of</b> Santo Domingo as an American state, the United States' acquisition of the rights for Samaná Bay for 50 years with an annual $150,000 rental, and guaranteed protection from foreign intervention. On January 10, 1870 the Santo Domingo treaty was submitted to the Senate for ratification. Despite his support of the annexation, Grant made the mistakes of not informing Congress of the treaty or encouraging national acceptance and enthusiasm.|$|E
5|$|In early-to-mid 1912, Stojanović and his schoolmate Todor Ilić joined Narodna Odbrana (National Defence), an {{association}} founded in Serbia in December 1908 on {{the initiative of}} Branislav Nušić.

National Defence soon established a network of local committees throughout Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Its members from the latter territory gathered intelligence on the Austrian army and passed it to the Serbian secret service.|$|E

5000|$|Mitchell Township is {{a former}} {{township}} in Davison County, South Dakota, United States, now primarily overlaid {{by the city of}} Mitchell.
