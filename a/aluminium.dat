5|$|Mercury readily {{combines}} with <b>aluminium</b> {{to form a}} mercury-aluminium amalgam {{when the}} two pure metals come into contact. Since the amalgam destroys the <b>aluminium</b> oxide layer which protects metallic <b>aluminium</b> from oxidizing in-depth (as in iron rusting), even small amounts of mercury can seriously corrode <b>aluminium.</b> For this reason, mercury is not allowed aboard an aircraft under most circumstances {{because of the risk}} of it forming an amalgam with exposed <b>aluminium</b> parts in the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|<b>Aluminium</b> {{chloride}} {{belongs to}} the point group D3h in its monomeric form and D2h in its dimeric form. Both forms of <b>aluminium</b> chloride, however, do not possess a dipole moment because the bond dipole moments cancel each other out.|$|E
5|$|<b>Aluminium</b> {{chloride}} {{combined with}} <b>aluminium</b> {{in the presence}} of an arene can be used to synthesize bis(arene) metal complexes, e.g. bis(benzene)chromium, from certain metal halides via the so-called Fischer-Hafner synthesis.|$|E
5|$|It {{has some}} {{properties}} that are {{unusual for a}} metal; taken together, these are sometimes used as a basis to classify <b>aluminium</b> as a metalloid. Its crystalline structure shows some evidence of directional bonding. <b>Aluminium</b> bonds covalently in most compounds. The oxide Al2O3 is amphoteric, and a conditional glass-former. <b>Aluminium</b> can form anionic aluminates, such behaviour being considered nonmetallic in character.|$|E
5|$|Silicon carbide is a semiconductor, {{which can}} be doped n-type by {{nitrogen}} or phosphorus and p-type by beryllium, boron, <b>aluminium,</b> or gallium. Metallic conductivity has been achieved by heavy doping with boron, <b>aluminium</b> or nitrogen.|$|E
5|$|The DB9 is {{the first}} Aston Martin model to be {{designed}} and developed on Ford's <b>aluminium</b> VH (vertical/horizontal) platform. The body structure is composed of <b>aluminium</b> and composites melded together by mechanically fixed self-piercing rivets and robotic assisted adhesive bonding techniques. The bonded <b>aluminium</b> structure is claimed to possess {{more than double the}} torsional rigidity of its predecessor's, despite being 25 percent lighter.|$|E
5|$|Alloys of zinc {{with small}} amounts of copper, <b>aluminium,</b> and {{magnesium}} are useful in die casting as well as spin casting, especially in the automotive, electrical, and hardware industries. These alloys are marketed under the name Zamak. An {{example of this is}} zinc <b>aluminium.</b> The low melting point together with the low viscosity of the alloy makes possible the production of small and intricate shapes. The low working temperature leads to rapid cooling of the cast products and fast production for assembly. Another alloy, marketed under the brand name Prestal, contains 78% zinc and 22% <b>aluminium,</b> and is reported to be nearly as strong as steel but as malleable as plastic. This superplasticity of the alloy allows it to be molded using die casts made of ceramics and cement.|$|E
5|$|<b>Aluminium</b> acetate and iron(II) acetate—used as mordants for dyes.|$|E
5|$|<b>Aluminium</b> also forms a lower {{chloride}}, aluminium(I) chloride (AlCl), {{but this}} is very unstable and only known in the vapour phase.|$|E
5|$|<b>Aluminium</b> {{chloride}} {{reacts with}} calcium and magnesium hydrides in tetrahydrofuran forming tetrahydroaluminates.|$|E
5|$|Another {{example is}} {{furnished}} by substances like <b>aluminium</b> hydroxide, Al(OH)3.|$|E
5|$|Chromic acid {{anodizing}} (or Type I anodizing) of <b>aluminium</b> {{is another}} electrochemical process, {{which does not}} lead to the deposition of chromium, but uses chromic acid as electrolyte in the solution. During anodization, an oxide layer is formed on the <b>aluminium.</b> The use of chromic acid, instead of the normally used sulfuric acid, leads to a slight difference of these oxide layers.|$|E
5|$|CuCl is {{used with}} carbon monoxide, <b>aluminium</b> chloride, and {{hydrogen}} chloride in the Gatterman-Koch reaction to form benzaldehydes.|$|E
5|$|In the US in 1993, {{approximately}} 21,000 tons were produced, {{not counting}} the amounts consumed {{in the production of}} <b>aluminium.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lutetium <b>aluminium</b> garnet (Al5Lu3O12) {{has been}} {{proposed}} {{for use as a}} lens material in high refractive index immersion lithography. Additionally, a tiny amount of lutetium is added as a dopant to gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG), which is used in magnetic bubble memory devices. Cerium-doped lutetium oxyorthosilicate (LSO) is currently the preferred compound for detectors in positron emission tomography (PET). Lutetium <b>aluminium</b> garnet (LuAG) is used as a phosphor in LED light bulbs.|$|E
5|$|Maximum weight {{limits for}} <b>aluminium,</b> brass, {{magnesium}} and zinc castings are approximately , , , and , respectively.|$|E
5|$|Some ions are classed as amphoteric, {{being able}} to react with either an acid or a base. This is also true of some {{compounds}} with ionic character, typically oxides or hydroxides of less-electropositive metals (so the compound also has significant covalent character), such as zinc oxide, <b>aluminium</b> hydroxide, <b>aluminium</b> oxide and lead(II) oxide.|$|E
5|$|Steel {{cylinders}} {{are more}} susceptible than <b>aluminium</b> to external corrosion, particularly in seawater, and may be galvanized or coated with corrosion barrier paints to resist corrosion damage. It {{is not difficult to}} monitor external corrosion, and repair the paint when damaged, and steel cylinders which are well maintained have a long service life, often longer than <b>aluminium</b> cylinders, as they are not susceptible to fatigue damage when filled within their safe working pressure limits.|$|E
5|$|The Manufacture of <b>Aluminium,</b> The Technologist, July 1864.|$|E
5|$|The {{alkylation}} {{reaction is}} more widely used than the acylation reaction, although its practice is more technically demanding because {{the reaction is}} more sluggish. For both reactions, the <b>aluminium</b> chloride, {{as well as other}} materials and the equipment, should be dry, although a trace of moisture is necessary for the reaction to proceed. A general problem with the Friedel–Crafts reaction is that the <b>aluminium</b> chloride catalyst sometimes is required in full stoichiometric quantities, because it complexes strongly with the products. This complication sometimes generates a large amount of corrosive waste. For these and similar reasons, more recyclable or environmentally benign catalysts have been sought. Thus, the use of <b>aluminium</b> trichloride in some applications is being displaced by zeolites.|$|E
5|$|The alloy Al20Li20Mg10Sc20Ti30 is {{as strong}} as titanium, light as <b>aluminium,</b> and hard as ceramic.|$|E
5|$|The chassis was {{manufactured}} from <b>aluminium</b> using Alcan's bonded <b>aluminium</b> structure vehicle technology (ASVT), {{and had a}} wheelbase of 2845mm. The {{design for}} the chassis featured rear wheel steering and packaged the fuel tank behind the centre bulkhead. Suspension design largely focused on road use, but a good compromise for racing use was achieved and the suspension height was adjustable. The concept car was fitted with a four-channel anti-lock braking system.|$|E
5|$|The {{high demand}} of <b>aluminium</b> created {{the need for}} the {{production}} of sodium. After the introduction of the Hall–Héroult process for the production of <b>aluminium</b> by electrolysing a molten salt bath ended the need for large quantities of sodium. A related process based on the reduction of sodium hydroxide was developed in 1886.|$|E
5|$|The {{properties}} of scandium compounds are intermediate between those of <b>aluminium</b> and yttrium. A diagonal relationship {{exists between the}} behavior of magnesium and scandium, {{just as there is}} between beryllium and <b>aluminium.</b> In the chemical compounds of the elements in group 3, the predominant oxidation state is +3.|$|E
5|$|The {{second largest}} {{application}} for manganese is in aluminum alloys. <b>Aluminium</b> with roughly 1.5% manganese has increased {{resistance to corrosion}} through grains that absorb impurities which would lead to galvanic corrosion. The corrosion-resistant <b>aluminium</b> alloys 3004 and 3104 (0.8 to 1.5% manganese) are used for most beverage cans. Before year 2000, more than 1.6 million tonnes of those alloys were used; at 1% manganese, this consumed 16,000 tonnes of manganese.|$|E
5|$|Vanadium stabilizes {{the beta}} form of {{titanium}} {{and increases the}} strength and temperature stability of titanium. Mixed with <b>aluminium</b> in titanium alloys, it is used in jet engines, high-speed airframes and dental implants. The most common alloy for seamless tubing is Titanium 3/2.5 containing 2.5% vanadium, the titanium alloy of choice in the aerospace, defense and bicycle industries. Another common alloy, primarily produced in sheets, is Titanium 6AL-4V, a titanium alloy with 6% <b>aluminium</b> and 4% vanadium.|$|E
5|$|Vehicular {{access to}} the Quays has been {{improved}} by the construction of Broadway Link Road, which links the site to the M602 motorway at junction 2, and by the provision of car parking. The high-rise 2116 space multi-storey car park was completed in August 2009. It is a pre-cast curved structure clad {{in a mixture of}} <b>aluminium</b> mesh panels and shaded <b>aluminium</b> tiles, comprising 11 floors of parking above the development's energy centre and commercial units.|$|E
5|$|While Klein's use of <b>aluminium</b> for {{a bicycle}} frames {{was not entirely}} novel, his use of large {{diameter}} tubes was. <b>Aluminium</b> alloys have a Young's modulus around a third that of steel, but with thicker tubes {{he was able to}} make a bicycle that weighed around 15% less than a conventional model.|$|E
5|$|Zinc oxide {{can react}} violently with <b>aluminium</b> and {{magnesium}} powders, with chlorinated rubber and linseed oil on heating causing fire and explosion hazard.|$|E
5|$|A further {{point to}} note is that drinking-water {{treatment}} commonly involves {{the addition of}} treatment chemicals such as <b>aluminium</b> sulfate or ferric chloride as flocculants, lime for pH adjustment, chlorine for disinfection and fluoride compounds for dental health.|$|E
5|$|A {{well-known}} practical joke among chemists is {{to fashion}} gallium spoons {{and use them}} to serve tea to unsuspecting guests, since gallium has a similar appearance to its lighter homolog <b>aluminium.</b> The spoons then melt in the hot tea.|$|E
5|$|<b>Aluminium</b> casting {{fitted to}} rear of crankcase. Houses drives to the camshafts, magnetos, coolant and oil pumps, supercharger, hand and {{electric}} starters, and the electric generator.|$|E
5|$|<b>Aluminium</b> {{chloride}} {{can also}} be used to introduce aldehyde groups onto aromatic rings, for example via the Gattermann-Koch reaction which uses carbon monoxide, hydrogen chloride and a copper(I) chloride co-catalyst.|$|E
5|$|<b>Aluminium</b> {{cylinders}} {{are usually}} manufactured by cold extrusion of <b>aluminium</b> billets {{in a process}} which first presses the walls and base, then trims {{the top edge of}} the cylinder walls, followed by press forming the shoulder and neck. The final structural process is machining the neck outer surface, boring and cutting the neck threads and O-ring groove. The cylinder is then heat-treated, tested and stamped with the required permanent markings. <b>Aluminium</b> diving cylinders commonly have flat bases, which allows them to stand upright on horizontal surfaces, and which are relatively thick to allow for rough treatment and considerable wear. This makes them heavier than they need to be for strength, but the extra weight at the base also helps keep the centre of gravity low which gives better balance in the water and reduces excess buoyancy.|$|E
5|$|Anhydrous <b>aluminium</b> {{chloride}} is {{a powerful}} Lewis acid, capable of forming Lewis acid-base adducts with even weak Lewis bases such as benzophenone and mesitylene. It forms tetrachloroaluminate AlCl4− {{in the presence of}} chloride ions.|$|E
5|$|Arc {{discharge}}: {{this is a}} {{high power}} thermal discharge of very high temperature (≈10,000 K). It can be generated using various power supplies. It is commonly used in metallurgical processes. For example, {{it is used to}} smelt minerals containing Al2O3 to produce <b>aluminium.</b>|$|E
