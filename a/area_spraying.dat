50|$|The malarial season came too. The Bekaa {{valley is}} a highly malarious area, and from 4 April every {{possible}} weapon was turned against its bearer, the too friendly anopheles mosquito. Anti-malaria squads could be seen prowling the <b>area</b> <b>spraying</b> stagnant water with insecticide. Complicated personal precautions appeared in routine orders—mosquito nets to be tucked in round blankets at dusk, sleeping quarters sprayed every morning, face nets and gloves for sentries, repellent cream smeared on exposed skin. You even saw inspecting officers running their fingers along a man's cheek {{to see if he}} had greased himself properly. Later in April, when summer clothes were issued, the unlovely Bombay bloomers at last came into their own, being unhitched and let down below the knee at dusk to dissuade the ‘mossies’. In 18 Battalion, as in every other unit, the men were apt to look on all these precautions with a tolerant contempt, and observe them when convenient. But {{this was not the case}} with typhus, which was reported in the Bekaa valley in March. This most unpleasant disease commanded more respect among the Kiwis, who were quite ready to co-operate by obeying ‘out of bounds’ restrictions where typhus was concerned.|$|E
40|$|The salient {{feature of}} a {{supercapacitor}} {{is its ability}} to deliver much higher power density than a battery. A hierarchical design and a cost-effective approach to fabricate high performance supercapacitors using functional carbon nano-particles is reported. A special arc synthesis method is used to produce amorphous/crystalline composite with nitrogen and boron co-doped high charge density carbon nanoparticles. Upon etch removal of the amorphous phase in the composite nanoparticle, a crystalline carbon framework emerges, consisting of a mixture of nano-graphitic sheets mostly in the middle and single nanohorns distributed around the surface of the nanoparticle. These nanoparticles have large internal/external surfaces with subnano channels and sharp nano-tips for high speed charge transport and local charge accumulation. To deliver high power density, the internal resistance of the device is reduced by assembling the nanoparticles via electro-spraying and compacting them into dense films (without any binder) under 700 MPa of pressure before supercapacitor assembly. Taken together, the hierarchical processed supercapacitor has a very high (compared to literature values) power density of nearly 4. 5 kW cm− 3 and a respectable energy density of 2. 45 mWh cm− 3. Combining these carbon nanoparticles with large <b>area</b> <b>spraying</b> coating, it can lead to a cost-effective production of high performance supercapacitors...|$|E
40|$|A pot {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} on during the two successive seasons of 2011 and 2012 at Ornamental Plants Research Branch, Antoniades Botanical Gardens, Alex, Egypt, to evaluate the effect of different amino acids mixture concentrations (0, 1. 0, 1. 5 and 2 ml/l) as foliar application on growth, flowering, bulbs production {{as well as some}} chemical constituents of two Longiflorum-Asiatic lily (L. A) Hybrids namely., 'Rubino ' and 'Red Alert ' The results revealed that all studied vegetative growth parameters were significantly affected by amino acid treatments. Spraying the plants with 900 mg/l amino acid gave the highest significant records of plant height, leaf number, fresh and dry weights of leaves in both seasons. The "Red Alert " cultivar showed higher significant response than "Rubino " cultivar for the vegetative growth parameters of plant height, leaf number/plant, and leaf area. Whereas, the "Rubino " cultivar gave higher significant records with respect to leaf fresh weight. As for the "Rubino ",the results indicated that foliar spray with 2 ml/l amino acid gave the highest significant records in fresh and dry weight of leaves. While applying the aforementioned treatment on "Red Alert " cultivar resulted in the highest records for plant height, leaf number/plant and leaf <b>area.</b> <b>Spraying</b> the plants with the highest concentration (2 ml/l) gave the highest significant values of flowering duration, petiole length and flower fresh and dry weights as well as advanced the flowering compared to the control.

For both data sets a multiple regression using average monthly rainfall from November-February (including October or March rainfall if 200 mm or more), total raindays of at least 0. 1 mm from November-February, {{and the percentage of}} susceptible <b>area</b> <b>sprayed</b> in the previous season to predict <b>area</b> <b>sprayed</b> gave reasonable results. The Kaingaroa data set gave an R 2 of 0. 53 and for Kinleith R 2 = 0. 70.

Further work to enhance the model should be carried out. This includes refining the input data, adding more observations, testing other combinations of predictive variables, and establishing disease progress field trials. Such enhancements should result in a model sufficiently robust to predict accurately the size of spray programmes and in turn reduce costs associated with over- or under-estimating supplies needed to service the programme...|$|R

40|$|Aedes aegypti is a container-inhabiting {{mosquito}} and a vector of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses. In 2009 {{several cases}} of autochthonous dengue transmission {{were reported in}} Key West, Florida, USA prompting a comprehensive response to control A. aegypti. In Key West, larvae of this mosquito develop in containers around human habitations which can be numerous and labor intensive to find and treat. Aerial applications of larvicide covering large areas {{in a short time}} can be an efficient and economical method to control A. aegypti. Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti) is a bacterial larvicide which is highly target specific and appropriate for wide <b>area</b> <b>spraying</b> over urban areas, but to date, there are no studies that evaluate aerial spraying of Bti to control container mosquitoes like A. aegypti. This paper examines the effectiveness of aerial larvicide applications using VectoBac® WG, a commercially available Bti formulation, for A. aegypti control in an urban setting in the USA. Droplet characteristics and spray drop deposition were evaluated in Key West, Florida, USA. The mortality of A. aegypti in containers placed under canopy in an urban environment was also evaluated. Efficacy of multiple larvicide applications on adult female A. aegypti population reduction was compared between an untreated control and treatment site. Droplet characteristics showed that small droplets can penetrate through dense canopy to reach small containers. VectoBac WG droplets reached small containers under heavy canopy in sufficient amounts to cause > 55 % mortality on all application days and > 90 % mortality on 3 of 5 application days while controls had 50 %. Aerial larvicide applications using VectoBac WG can cover wide areas {{in a short period of}} time and can be effective in controlling A. aegypti and reducing A. aegypti-borne transmission in urban areas similar to Key West, Florida, USA...|$|E

The SCE frequencies for the high and moderate TCDD groups from the <b>sprayed</b> <b>area</b> and for the non <b>sprayed</b> <b>area</b> group were 2. 40, 2. 19, and 1. 48 per cell, respectively. Multiple regression analysis showed that the standardized β values for 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8 -hexaCDD (β = 0. 60), 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 -heptaCDD (β = 0. 64), and octaCDD (β = 0. 65) were higher than those for TCDD (β = 0. 34) and 1, 2, 3, 7, 8 -pentaCDD (β = 0. 42). The adjusted R 2 value for polyCDDs (R 2 = 0. 38) was higher than that for polyCDD toxic equivalents (TEQ (toxic equivalents); R 2 = 0. 23). This study therefore shows that levels of hexa-, hepta-, and octaCDD, which were previously regarded as being less toxic than TCDD, are closely related to SCE frequency and that the level of dioxin (pg/g lipid) is potentially more useful as an indicator than TEQ value for explaining SCE frequency...|$|R

The characteristic data was extracted from spray images grabbed by a high speed visualization system. The results showed that the ambient pressure and injection pressure had significant effects on the spray characteristics. As the ambient pressure increased, the spray angle increased, while the spray tip penetration and the peak of average tip velocity decreased. As the injection pressure increased, the spray tip penetration, <b>spray</b> angle, <b>spray</b> <b>area</b> and <b>spray</b> volume increased. The increasing blend ratio of biodiesel brought about a shorter spray tip penetration and a smaller spray angle compared with those of diesel.
