5|$|On 16 May 1968 <b>a</b> <b>parachute</b> brigade of two regiments (each {{of three}} battalions) was formed which {{eventually}} was {{to grow in}} size to a full division.|$|E
5|$|A precise search {{area was}} {{difficult}} to define, as even small differences in estimates of the aircraft's speed, or the environmental conditions along the flight path (which varied significantly by location and altitude), changed Cooper's projected landing point considerably. An important variable was {{the length of time}} he remained in free fall before pulling his rip cord—if indeed he succeeded in opening <b>a</b> <b>parachute</b> at all. Neither of the Air Force fighter pilots saw anything exit the airliner, either visually or on radar, nor did they see <b>a</b> <b>parachute</b> open; but at night, with extremely limited visibility and cloud cover obscuring any ground lighting below, an airborne human figure clad entirely in black clothing could easily have gone undetected. The T-33 pilots never made visual contact with the 727 at all.|$|E
5|$|On 12 November 2008, Felton {{appeared}} alongside Jack Osbourne on Adrenaline Junkie as {{he participated}} in various challenges in South Africa, including a 200ft bungee jump on Bloukrans Bridge, took a ride in a helicopter, followed by <b>a</b> <b>parachute</b> freefall and came face-to-face with Great White sharks.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> drogue <b>parachute</b> is more {{elongated}} {{and has a}} {{far smaller}} area than <b>a</b> conventional <b>parachute</b> and therefore provides less drag. This means that <b>a</b> drogue <b>parachute</b> cannot slow <b>an</b> object as much as <b>a</b> conventional <b>parachute,</b> {{but it can be}} deployed at speeds at which conventional parachutes would be torn apart.|$|R
5|$|The 4th Parachute Brigade was an airborne, {{specifically}} <b>a</b> <b>parachute</b> infantry, brigade {{formation of}} the British Army during the Second World War. Formed in late 1942 in the Mediterranean and Middle East, the brigade was composed of three parachute infantry units, the 10th, 11th and 156th Parachute Battalions.|$|E
5|$|The Landing at Nadzab was an {{airborne}} {{landing on}} 5 September 1943 during the New Guinea campaign of World War II {{in conjunction with}} the landing at Lae. The Nadzab action began with <b>a</b> <b>parachute</b> drop at Lae Nadzab Airport, combined with an overland force.|$|E
5|$|Witnesses {{reported}} seeing <b>a</b> <b>parachute</b> drifting {{away from the}} falling F-100F, leading to the hope that a pilot had ejected, but when the parachute was located it {{was determined to be}} a drag parachute that is meant to be deployed on landing to help slow the fighter down.|$|E
50|$|Sister Evangelina is {{described}} as <b>a</b> <b>parachuting</b> VAD in Jennifer Worth's Call the Midwife.|$|R

5|$|A Drax Industries Moonraker {{space shuttle}} on loan to the United Kingdom is hijacked in mid-air. M, head of MI6, assigns James Bond, Agent 007, to investigate.

He survives by stealing <b>a</b> <b>parachute</b> from the pilot, whilst Jaws lands on a trapeze net within a circus tent.|$|E
5|$|During the 1980s and 1990s, Lamason was {{a regular}} speaker at KLB (initials for Konzentrationslager Buchenwald) Club reunions, a club formed by the allied airmen while {{detained}} in Buchenwald. Lamason was {{also a member of}} the Caterpillar Club, an informal association of people who have successfully used <b>a</b> <b>parachute</b> to bail out of a disabled aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Impressed by {{the success}} of German {{airborne}} operations during the Battle of France in May–June 1940, the British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, directed the War Office to investigate the possibility of creating a force of 5,000 parachute troops. As a result, on 22 June 1940, No. 2 Commando assumed parachute duties, and on 21 November was re-designated the 11th Special Air Service Battalion, with <b>a</b> <b>parachute</b> and glider wing. This later became the 1st Parachute Battalion.|$|E
50|$|On 22 March 1956, Ben-Boulaïd died in {{the blast}} of <b>a</b> <b>parachuted</b> French radio bomb, along with a friend, Abdelhamid Amrani.|$|R

5|$|The 1st Parachute Battalion was <b>a</b> <b>parachute</b> {{infantry}} {{battalion of}} the Australian Army. Raised for service during the Second World War, it {{was formed in}} early 1943 from volunteers for airborne training.

5|$|Two {{men were}} {{killed during the}} {{construction}} of the bridge. In 1885, a 22-year-old woman named Sarah Ann Henley survived a suicide attempt off the bridge when her billowing skirts acted as <b>a</b> <b>parachute</b> and she landed in the thick mud banks of the tidal River Avon at low tide; she subsequently lived into her eighties.|$|E
5|$|At 17:30 {{a flight}} of Luftwaffe Focke-Wulf Fw 190s {{attacked}} the Orne bridgehead, causing {{little in the way}} of any damage. Soon afterward, Royal Air Force Short Stirling bombers arrived to carry out <b>a</b> <b>parachute</b> resupply for the division. Included in the parachute drop were 6 pounder anti-tank guns, which until then had always been delivered by glider. Some forty-one of the 9th Parachute Battalion's missing men arrived at their position at 21:00, bringing the battalion strength up to around 200 men.|$|E
5|$|Hunter (1991) {{has been}} {{described}} as the first sandbox game featuring full 3D, third-person graphics, thus making it an important precursor to the Grand Theft Auto series. The game consisted of a large, open world in which there were numerous possibilities to complete different missions. The character could travel on foot, or steal different vehicles such as cars, tanks, or even bicycles, boats, helicopters and hovercrafts. Moreover, Hunter also had many unique features such as day and night lighting, fuel modelling, a log book, aerial observation units, tank traps, land mines and computer-controlled rocket batteries and tracer guns. It was also possible to ride a bicycle, swim, windsurf or even make <b>a</b> <b>parachute</b> jump from a helicopter.|$|E

50|$|In 1928, {{she became}} the first Romanian woman to ever obtain <b>a</b> <b>parachuting</b> license (receiving it in Berlin, Germany), {{and one of the first}} women in the world to do so.|$|R
5|$|In Paris it {{was planned}} that two stunt men, B.J. Worth and Don Caldvedt, would help film two takes of <b>a</b> <b>parachute</b> drop off a (clearly visible) {{platform}} that extended from a {{top edge of}} the Eiffel Tower. However, sufficient footage was obtained from Worth's jump, so Caldvedt was told {{he would not be}} performing his own jump. Caldvedt, unhappy at not being able to perform the jump, parachuted off the tower without authorisation from the City of Paris. He was subsequently sacked by the production team for jeopardising the continuation of filming in the city.|$|E
5|$|In outline, the XV Mountain Corps {{plan was}} for a heavy aerial {{bombardment}} of Partisan positions in and around Drvar by Luftwaffe aircraft, followed by <b>a</b> <b>parachute</b> and glider assault by the 500th SS Parachute Battalion who had the task of capturing or killing Tito and destroying his headquarters. The assault also included tasks to capture or destroy the Allied military missions to the Partisans. On the same day, ground elements of XV Mountain Corps were to converge on Drvar to link up with the 500th SS Parachute Battalion. A small reconnaissance aircraft was tasked to fly into Drvar after its capture to retrieve Tito or his body.|$|E
5|$|Rawlinson {{was living}} in the Melbourne suburb of Ivanhoe and had been working as a clerk for two-and-a-half years when he joined the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) on 19July 1938. He {{underwent}} flying instruction as an air cadet at No.1 Flying Training School, Point Cook, and was granted a short-service commission as a pilot officer on probation from 22June 1939. On 7July he was posted to No.3 (Army Cooperation) Squadron, which operated Hawker Demon biplane fighters out of RAAF Station Richmond, New South Wales. He spent much of the remainder of the year learning instrument flying on the Link Trainer, and undertaking <b>a</b> <b>parachute</b> training course.|$|E
