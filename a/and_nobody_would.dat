25|$|Surprisingly, gauge {{symmetry}} {{can give}} a deeper explanation {{for the existence of}} interactions, such as the electric and nuclear interactions. This arises from a type of gauge symmetry relating to the fact that all particles of a given type are experimentally indistinguishable from one another. Imagine that Alice and Betty are identical twins, labeled at birth by bracelets reading A and B. Because the girls are identical, nobody would be able to tell if they had been switched at birth; the labels A and B are arbitrary, and can be interchanged. Such a permanent interchanging of their identities is like a global gauge symmetry. There is also a corresponding local gauge symmetry, which describes the fact that from one moment to the next, Alice and Betty could swap roles while nobody was looking, <b>and</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>would</b> be able to tell. If we observe that Mom's favorite vase is broken, we can only infer that the blame belongs to one twin or the other, but we cannot tell whether the blame is 100% Alice's and 0% Betty's, or vice versa. If Alice and Betty are in fact quantum-mechanical particles rather than people, then they also have wave properties, including the property of superposition, which allows waves to be added, subtracted, and mixed arbitrarily. It follows that we are not even restricted to complete swaps of identity. For example, if we observe that a certain amount of energy exists in a certain location in space, there is no experiment that can tell us whether that energy is 100% A's and 0% B's, 0% A's and 100% B's, or 20% A's and 80% B's, or some other mixture. The fact that the symmetry is local means that we cannot even count on these proportions to remain fixed as the particles propagate through space. The details of how this is represented mathematically depend on technical issues relating to the spins of the particles, but for our present purposes we consider a spinless particle, for which {{it turns out that the}} mixing can be specified by some arbitrary choice of gauge θ(x), where an angle θnbsp&=nbsp&0° represents 100% A and 0% B, θnbsp&=nbsp&90° means 0% A and 100% B, and intermediate angles represent mixtures.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} years saw Morrissey cast in two high-profile feature films; while filming the Brian Jones biopic Stoned (2005), {{he got an}} audition for psychiatrist Dr. Michael Glass, the male lead in Basic Instinct 2 (2006). He was flown out to Los Angeles for a one-hour screen test with Sharon Stone. Their immediate rapport led to the screen test being extended by another hour and Morrissey's casting in the role. Morrissey had enjoyed the first film and liked the script for the sequel. He read up on psychiatry and worked out in a gym for the nudity scenes. The film was a box office and critical failure. The Washington Post criticised the film's focus on Morrissey's character and called the actor [...] "overmatched by Stone" [...] and [...] "a sad sack", and the Seattle Post-Intelligencer called him [...] "a charisma-challenged non-entity". The same Washington Post critic later wrote in the Los Angeles Times that because Morrissey was not a film star, the chemistry between him and Stone had been spoiled. Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club wrote that Morrissey had [...] "the charisma of beige wallpaper" [...] and that [...] "the producers could have replaced him halfway through shooting with a handsome mahogany coat rack <b>and</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>would</b> {{be able to tell}} the difference". The bad reviews depressed Morrissey, and he briefly considered giving up acting, but instead saw the role as a chance to learn.|$|E
500|$|Zack Handlen {{reviewed}} the episode for The A.V. Club in April 2010. He {{said that the}} aliens in the episode were [...] "one note", and overall [...] "Code of Honor" [...] didn't generate any emotional investment. He gave the episode a score of C−, summing it up as [...] "I'm not sure I'd believe a great show {{could come out of}} TNG after watching 'Code', but I could at least say it had promise without sounding like a complete tool." [...] Keith DeCandido watched [...] "Code of Honor" [...] for Tor.com in May 2011. He thought the episode was riddled with clichés, and says that the episode only seems racist because of the casting even though the script didn't call for it. [...] "If the Ligonians had been played by white people, none of the dialogue would change, <b>and</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>would</b> call it racist", he said and gave it a score of two out of ten. Michelle Erica Green of TrekNation thought the episode was very slowly paced, and that the fight scene at the end was [...] "clunky and awkward", suggesting that this {{had something to do with}} the opposition of the cast and crew to the episode overall. She thought there were several plot holes, including why sickbay couldn't replicate the vaccine, and that the only redeeming quality of the episode was the beginning of the friendship between Data and La Forge.|$|E

2500|$|Although Hazlitt {{retained}} a few devoted admirers, his reputation {{among the general}} public had been demolished by the cadre of reviewers in Tory periodicals whose efforts Hazlitt had excoriated in [...] "On the Jealousy and the Spleen of Party". [...] According to John Wilson of Blackwood's Magazine, for example, Hazlitt had already [...] "been excommunicated from all decent society, <b>and</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>would</b> touch a dead book of his, {{any more than they}} would the body {{of a man who had}} died of the plague".|$|E
2500|$|The {{prosecution}} {{also presented}} {{other pieces of}} circumstantial evidence linking Zach to the murder, including that he drove a white truck; a neighbor of the Bobo family had seen a white truck driving rapidly {{the morning of the}} murder. A number of other witnesses testified that Zach made statements implicating himself in her disappearance. Zach's then-girlfriend, Rebecca Earp, testified that [...] "He said he would tie me up just like he did Holly Bobo <b>and</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>would</b> ever see me again." [...] He also allegedly threatened Dylan after his arrest that he would [...] "put him in a hole beside her" [...] if he didn't keep his mouth shut.|$|E

[...] He also advocates investigating why the various intelligence agencies could not collaborate on information to prevent the attacks while spending $40 billion per year. He has called the 9/11 Commission Report a [...] "charade", saying [...] "spending more money abroad or restricting liberties at home will do nothing to deter terrorists, yet this is exactly what the 9–11 Commission recommends." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tatangelo, meanwhile, {{decided to}} run for mayor to {{challenge}} the status quo, or the so-called [...] "Old Party" [...] or the [...] "patron system" [...] or the [...] "Independent Club", by which voters defer to one or two usually elected officials in the community with the expectation that those individuals will provide personal favors when needed. The Laredo leadership claimed that citizens preferred the patron system so that major political decisions would be handled on their behalf by trusted officials. Fernando Pinon, a former Laredo Morning Times editor, wrote a book Patron Democracy, about this peculiar phenomenon. He told The Laredo Morning Times: [...] "I would go to the city council meeting, <b>and</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>would</b> pay attention to me. I said, 'Maybe I should be inside, instead of outside looking in.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1952 {{she had an}} {{operational}} link-loader, {{which at the time}} was referred to as a compiler. She later said that [...] "Nobody believed that," [...] and that she [...] "had a running compiler <b>and</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>would</b> touch it. They told me computers could only do arithmetic." [...] She {{goes on to say that}} her compiler [...] "translated mathematical notation into machine code. Manipulating symbols was fine for mathematicians but it was no good for data processors who were not symbol manipulators. Very few people are really symbol manipulators. If they are they become professional mathematicians, not data processors. It’s much easier for most people to write an English statement than it is to use symbols. So I decided data processors ought to be able to write their programs in English, and the computers would translate them into machine code. That was the beginning of COBOL, a computer language for data processors. I could say “Subtract income tax from pay” instead of trying to write that in octal code or using all kinds of symbols. COBOL is the major language used today in data processing.”“ ...|$|E

St. Michel highlighted the song as an album standout, praising Zedd's collaboration with Amuro. Michael McCarthy from Otakudx.com gave the song a mixed review. In his track-by-track comments, {{he said that he}} felt [...] "Heaven" [...] was the weakest song on the album, saying also, [...] "Which isn't to say that it's a bad song. I actually like it quite a bit, but the lyrics are cheesy and ZEDD's production here feels a bit thin compared to his usual work. Also, it almost sounds like Namie is singing in a different key than the music during parts of this song." [...] He criticized Amuro's vocals for being [...] "sliced and diced", the lyrical content and Amuro's English pronunciation.

2500|$|The {{characters}} of Rosario + Vampire have received criticism from publications dedicated to anime, manga, and other media.

[...] Carlo Santos of Anime News Network, in reviewing the manga, noted Tsukune's character design as lazy: [...] "shove in any other male protagonist from a harem series <b>and</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>would</b> notice too much". He found the girls [...] "distinctive, if predictable (the beauty, the boobs, the jailbait)", but concluded in a later volume that [...] "The story's never going to go anywhere, the characters {{are never going to}} go anywhere, and the artwork is always going to have that same polished-but-flawed look." [...] Stig Høgset of THEM Anime Reviews found Moka to be ditzy and a [...] "pink-haired dolt"; he criticized her lack of vampire weaknesses such as walking around in broad daylight at a beach, but found her alternate personality as [...] "pretty damn badass", [...] "a great addition to the show, if a severely underutilized one", and wished that her character was developed better. Deb Aoki of About.com called Moka a magical ditz who loves the doofus but also kicks butt. Neil Lumbard of DVD Talk noted that Kokoa is not another character that has a massive crush on the same guy; however, Høgset noted that her anime role was reduced to obnoxious comedy acts.|$|E
