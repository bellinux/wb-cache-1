5|$|On 21 October 1999, Warnock {{announced}} her departure {{at the next}} election for personal reasons, <b>and</b> <b>threw</b> <b>her</b> support behind former Town of Vincent mayor John Hyde, {{a member of the}} Centre faction of the Labor Party who had the support of the Left faction and some Centre members of Parliament. However, the key Centre unions had backed former ministerial adviser Adele Farina for the post, and Labor's affirmative action policy for candidates in winnable seats meant that failing to pick a female candidate would risk sitting male MPs. A week later, the Centre faction openly split, with a breakaway group endorsing Hyde. On 5 November, Farina withdrew from the contest, leaving Hyde to be preselected unopposed ahead of the 2001 election. He maintained the seat for Labor at the election, becoming the first openly gay man to sit in the Western Australian parliament.|$|E
5|$|In October 2012, {{new details}} emerged in her murder investigation. Charges were brought against Jorge Antonio Hernández Silva (alias El Silva) and José Adrián Hernández Domínguez (alias El Jarocho), {{two men who}} were alleged to have murdered Martínez Pérez. Silva, who had already been arrested, confessed to the murder. According to Silva's confession, the {{reporter}} knew Domínguez and therefore allowed both of them into her house {{on the night of}} her murder. After some conversation, Domínguez grew angry and started beating Martínez Pérez with the intention of forcing her to reveal where she hid her money and other valuable possessions. Silva then joined his accomplice in the beating until they killed her. Investigators said that the attackers had plunged the journalist's head into a toilet bowl, hit her on the head several times with brass knuckles, <b>and</b> <b>threw</b> <b>her</b> against a tub, where she cracked her skull. Martínez Pérez unsuccessfully tried to defend herself by grabbing a kitchen knife and stabbing one of the attackers in the forearm, but they managed to outweigh her because she only weighed 108lbs (48.9kg). Both men then stole a plasma TV, two cellphones, a laptop computer, a camera and a small box, and the journalist's wristband from her home before leaving the crime scene.|$|E

25|$|On 28 August 1984, when Elisabeth was 18 {{years of}} age, her father lured {{her into the}} {{basement}} of the family home, saying he needed help carrying a door. This was the last piece needed to seal the chamber. Elisabeth held it in place while Josef fitted it into the frame. Then he held an ether-soaked towel on Elisabeth's face until she was unconscious, <b>and</b> <b>threw</b> <b>her</b> into the chamber.|$|E
25|$|Miss Elizabeth {{disappeared}} from WWF television until WrestleMania VII, when Savage lost a retirement match to The Ultimate Warrior. Upon his loss, Sherri began beating and kicking the defeated Savage until Elizabeth, {{who was sitting}} at ringside, entered the ring and defended Savage. Elizabeth grabbed Sherri by the hair <b>and</b> <b>threw</b> <b>her</b> out of the ring, reuniting Savage and Elizabeth. Macho Man punctuated the reunion by holding down the ropes for Elizabeth after years of her doing it for him.|$|E
25|$|In Missouri in 1993, 17-year-old Christopher Simmons, {{along with}} two younger friends, Charles Benjamin and John Tessmer, concocted a plan to murder Shirley Crook. The plan was to commit {{burglary}} and murder by breaking and entering, tying up a victim, and tossing the victim off a bridge. The three met {{in the middle of}} the night; however, Tessmer dropped out of the plot. Simmons and Benjamin broke into Mrs. Crook's home, bound her hands and covered her eyes. They drove her to a state park <b>and</b> <b>threw</b> <b>her</b> off a bridge.|$|E

25|$|Jason and Cyane tracked Iphigénie and {{initially}} fired on her but broke off the engagement {{because they were}} outgunned. Cyane continued the chase for over three days until Venerable was able to rejoin the fight after having sailed 153 miles in the direction she believed that Iphigénie had taken. On 20 January 1814, after a 19-hour chase, or what amounted in all to a four-day chase Iphigénie, Venerable captured the quarry, having again left Cyane behind. In the chase, Iphigénie cast off her anchors <b>and</b> <b>threw</b> <b>her</b> boats overboard {{in order to try}} to gain speed. She had a complement of 325 men, under the command of Captain Emerie. She apparently did not resist after Venerable came up. Before meeting up with the British ships, the two French vessels had taken some eight prizes.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, a sixty-five-year-old {{advertising}} executive with no prior history of crime or violence after an argument strangled his wife, {{opened the window}} <b>and</b> <b>threw</b> <b>her</b> out of their 12th-floor apartment. His defense team had a structural brain scan done using MRI and PET scan. The images showed a big piece missing from the prefrontal cortex of the brain, i.e., a subarachnoid cyst was growing in his left frontal lobe. The defense team used these images to argue that Weinstein had an impaired ability to regulate his emotions and make rational decisions. The team went with an insanity defense, and the prosecution and defense agreed to a plea of manslaughter. As a result, Weinstein was given a seven-year sentence {{in contrast to the}} twenty-five-year sentence he would have served if he had been convicted of second-degree murder.|$|E
25|$|On Saturday, February 23, 1985 {{during a}} game at Bloomington between Purdue and Indiana, just five minutes into the game, a {{scramble}} for a loose ball resulted in a foul call on Indiana's Marty Simmons. Immediately after the resumption of play, a foul was called on Indiana's Daryl Thomas. Knight, irate, insisted {{the first of the}} two calls should have been for a jump ball and ultimately received a technical foul. Purdue's Steve Reid stepped to the free throw line to shoot the resulting free throws, but before he could, Knight grabbed a red plastic chair from Indiana's bench and threw it across the floor toward the basket in front of Reid. Knight was charged with second and third technical fouls and was ejected from the game. He apologized for his actions the next day and was given a one-game suspension and two years probation from the Big Ten. Since the incident, Knight has occasionally joked about throwing the chair by saying that he saw an old lady standing on the opposite sideline <b>and</b> <b>threw</b> <b>her</b> the chair so she could sit down.|$|E

500|$|The trophy was {{presented}} by former Cambridge student Prince Edward. Cambridge stroke John Pritchard said [...] "After our initial start we built up for 20 strokes, steadied {{and then just}} grinded away." [...] He added [...] "I was just stirring the tea while the others did the work." [...] Cambridge cox Carole Burton noted [...] "I went where I wanted to go." [...] Following tradition, Pritchard picked her up <b>and</b> <b>threw</b> <b>her</b> into the river. Oxford's Jones remarked [...] "we were as well prepared as last year but we found no magic." [...] Topolski conceded that even had Oxford been at their best, they would still have lost the race.|$|E
500|$|At {{the age of}} 15, Collings fell in {{love with}} Dudley Beaumont, a British painter who could neither shoot nor climb cliffs and whom her father thus {{considered}} a [...] "weakling". In 1901, her father {{made it clear that he}} was adamantly opposed to the relationship. When she continued seeing Beaumont, he dragged her out of her bedroom at midnight <b>and</b> <b>threw</b> <b>her</b> out of the seigneurial residence barefoot and in a nightgown. Collings remained in a hedge until Beaumont, alerted by her mother, found her predawn. She boarded a boat for the neighbouring island of Guernsey. When the Seigneur stormed aboard looking for her, she was hidden by the captain. She then travelled to the house of a relative in London. Beaumont soon married her at St James's Church, Piccadilly.|$|E

500|$|There were officially ten {{suspects}} for the murder, {{though the}} ten were {{not known to}} viewers or cast members, who speculated about {{the identity of the}} killer. On Christmas Eve, storylines showed Archie evicting his wife Peggy, daughters Ronnie and Roxy, Peggy's son Phil and Phil's son Ben (Charlie Jones) from their home, The Queen Victoria public house, after he became the landlord. Ronnie had a further motive as Archie had caused her to suffer a miscarriage and she blamed him for the death of her daughter Danielle Jones (Lauren Crace) earlier in 2009. Peggy discovered that Archie had paid her daughter Sam Mitchell (Danniella Westbrook) to skip bail, thus plunging the Mitchells into debt, and Sam returned on Christmas Day to discover she had been manipulated. Phil was also a suspect after failing to kill Archie on Peggy's request earlier in 2009. Simons explained that the killer was likely to be the most unsuspecting person, and stated that Roxy was [...] "pretty much the only non-suspect," [...] but said she felt the character would not {{go so far as to}} kill her father, even though she had seen his true colours. Woodyatt said his character, Ian Beale, would have done anything to stop his wife Jane (Laurie Brett) from finding out that he had sex with Janine, so it would be plausible if it turned out that Ian had killed Archie. Archie had a laptop recording of Ian and Janine together that he had threatened to give to Jane. Janine, who was engaged to Archie, also had a motive as Archie had been using her to gain ownership of The Queen Victoria <b>and</b> <b>threw</b> <b>her</b> out on Christmas Day. She was seen holding a knife before Archie was killed.|$|E
2500|$|As the {{post-mortem}} examination began, Frank Paroubek {{was the first}} witness. Disregarding questions put {{to him by the}} coroner, Frank plunged into charges his daughter had been murdered.

2500|$|The {{civilian}} {{driving the}} open wagon abandoned his vehicle as the gunfight began, fleeing to safety.

[...] The bandits called Campbell's name and fired a couple shots in her direction before turning their attention elsewhere. [...] Campbell then crawled behind a bush and some rocks located about [...] past the ambulance. [...] She observed the rest of the fight from this position.|$|E
2500|$|... "Then the Maid , surpassing {{the nature}} of a woman, took on a great force, and took much pain to save her company from defeat, {{remaining}} behind as the leader and as the bravest of the troop. [...] But there fortune permitted for the end of her glory and for the last time that she would ever carry arms. [...] An archer, a rough and very sour man, full of much spite because a woman, who so much had been spoken about, should have defeated so many brave men, as she had done, grabbed the edge of her cloth-of-gold doublet, <b>and</b> <b>threw</b> <b>her</b> from her horse flat to the ground." ...|$|E
2500|$|The gypsies {{sing the}} Anvil Chorus: Vedi le fosche notturne / [...] "See! The endless sky casts off her sombre nightly garb...". Azucena, the {{daughter}} of the Gypsy burnt by the count, is still haunted by her duty to avenge her mother (Aria: Stride la vampa / [...] "The flames are roaring!"). The Gypsies break camp while Azucena confesses to Manrico that after stealing the di Luna baby she had intended to burn the count's little son along with her mother, but overwhelmed by the screams and the gruesome scene of her mother's execution, she became confused <b>and</b> <b>threw</b> <b>her</b> own child into the flames instead (Aria: Condotta ell'era in ceppi / [...] "They dragged her in bonds").|$|E
