40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityThis study {{examines}} whether the {{corporate social responsibility}} (CSR) performance of the target firms influences the <b>acquisition</b> <b>premiums</b> paid by the acquirers. Using U. S. public merger and acquisition (M&A) deals, I found that <b>acquisition</b> <b>premiums</b> increase in the targets' perceived CSR quality, an effect incremental to previously documented drivers of such premiums. These findings are robust to (1) using four proxies for CSR measures, and (2) using three proxies for <b>acquisition</b> <b>premiums.</b> Greater value-enhancing and synergistic capabilities of targets with superior quality CSR, acquirers' environmental, social and reputational risk protection needs, and market imperfections- related incorrect valuation of CSR activities are possible explanations for this observed positive association between targets' CSR and <b>acquisition</b> <b>premiums.</b> Analysis specific to each CSR attribute reveals that targets' environmental performance has positive and the strongest effects on <b>acquisition</b> <b>premiums.</b> In addition, superior-quality community and diversity influence <b>acquisition</b> <b>premiums</b> significantly and positively. However, this analysis does not indicate any consistent association between target firms' product attributes and <b>acquisition</b> <b>premiums.</b> Additionally and perhaps more strikingly, this investigation reports a significant negative association between targets' employee relations and <b>acquisition</b> <b>premiums.</b> Additional tests document that the positive association between target firms' perceived CSR quality and <b>acquisition</b> <b>premiums</b> is stronger for acquirers with high quality CSR and large targets. Overall, in this study, I combine the CSR and M&A literature by demonstrating that superior quality CSR performance affects <b>acquisition</b> <b>premiums</b> positively. Thus, this study expands {{our understanding of the}} value-enhancing role of CSR by studying the M&A market...|$|R

5000|$|Despite {{the goal}} of {{performance}} improvement, results from mergers and acquisitions (M&A) are often disappointing compared with results predicted or expected. Numerous empirical studies show high failure rates of M&A deals. Studies are mostly focused on individual determinants. A book by Thomas Straub (2007) [...] "Reasons for frequent failure in Mergers and Acquisitions" [...] develops a comprehensive research framework that bridges different perspectives and promotes an understanding of factors underlying M&A performance in business research and scholarship. The study should help managers in the decision making process. The first important step towards this objective {{is the development of}} a common frame of reference that spans conflicting theoretical assumptions from different perspectives. On this basis, a comprehensive framework is proposed with which to understand the origins of M&A performance better and address the problem of fragmentation by integrating the most important competing perspectives in respect of studies on M&A. Furthermore, according to the existing literature, relevant determinants of firm performance are derived from each dimension of the model. For the dimension strategic management, the six strategic variables: market similarity, market complementarities, production operation similarity, production operation complementarities, market power, and purchasing power were identified as having an important effect on M&A performance. For the dimension organizational behavior, the variables acquisition experience, relative size, and cultural differences were found to be important. Finally, relevant determinants of M&A performance from the financial field were <b>acquisition</b> <b>premium,</b> bidding process, and due diligence. Three different ways in order to best measure post M&A performance are recognized: synergy realization, absolute performance, and finally relative performance.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the gains to acquiring shareholders in cash-acquisitions which occurred in Thailand {{in the period}} between 1992 and 2001. It analyses the impact of stock market valuations {{at the time the}} acquisitions occurred and the impact of toehold acquisition strategy on acquirers' post-acquisition performance. The first part reviews the merger and acquisition (M&A) history in the US and Thailand, Thai stock market history and corporate governance. It shows that the merger waves which took place in both countries are positively correlated to economic prosperity. However, after the Asian crisis in 1997, this relationship is reversed for Thailand. Accordingly, the second part empirically investigates the impact of stock market valuations and acquiring shareholders' long-term performance. The findings show that high-valuation acquirers perform significantly less well than low-valuation acquirers. The underperformance is due to an overpayment of acquisition premiums. Two-stage regressions allow us to discover that the <b>acquisition</b> <b>premium</b> is endogenously determined by the acquirer's financial constraint and the target's leverage. The acquirer's financial constraint is found to have a positive relationship with the <b>acquisition</b> <b>premium</b> whereas the target's leverage is found to be negatively related to the <b>acquisition</b> <b>premium.</b> The findings suggested that stock market valuation has a significant impact on acquiring shareholders. Engaging in an acquisition during a high-valuation period destroys shareholders' value in the long-run whereas low-valuation acquisition {{is considered to be a}} profitable strategy. In the third part, the role of toeholds 1 and their impact on acquirers long-term performance is examined. Simultaneous equations are employed in order to investigate the relationship between the size of the toehold, the stock price run-up 2, the <b>acquisition</b> <b>premium,</b> and the acquirer's long-term performance. Since acquiring a toehold alerts the market to the possibility of a successful takeover and to a target's value, the size of the toehold is found to increase the target's stock price run-up. However, the size of the toehold is not found to have a direct effect on the <b>acquisition</b> <b>premium</b> but indirectly influences the <b>acquisition</b> <b>premium</b> through the stock price run-up. An increase in the stock price run-up is found to positively influence the <b>acquisition</b> <b>premium.</b> Both the stock price run-up and the <b>acquisition</b> <b>premium</b> have significant negative impacts on acquiring shareholders' post-acquisition gains. Therefore, toehold acquisition induces an added cost of acquisition by increasing the target's share price prior to the announcement date and leading to an <b>acquisition</b> <b>premium...</b>|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{critical}} issue in M&A operations is the <b>acquisition</b> <b>premium.</b> This quantity is usually expressed as a percentage value. This thesis explains how the <b>acquisition</b> <b>premium</b> is usually represented by business analysts and academic literature. We highlight advantages and limits of this common premium measure. The purpose of our analysis is to prove the intuition of academics that the pre-deal leverage of the target company may overstate the dimension of percentage <b>acquisition</b> <b>premium.</b> We also analysed possible adjustment methods to correct this effect for the purpose of business valuation. This document is organized in four main chapters. The first chapter introduces the main concepts on the issue and the theoretical framework of reference. It illustrates how the value created inM&A operations is represented, how values are computed and the link between value and <b>acquisition</b> <b>premium.</b> The second chapter contains a theoretical analysis on the representation of <b>acquisition</b> <b>premium</b> and its relationship with leverage through an intense academic literature review. It illustrates different studies on premiums and how these studies reported them.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} value {{relevance}} of fair value accounting for non-financial tangible and intangible {{assets in the}} United States by examining the association of asset recognitions and revaluations accompanying business combinations with future performance.

Future performance is measured as subsequent-period changes in operating income and changes in operating cash flows. The paper addresses three related research questions. First, to what extent are the components of <b>acquisition</b> <b>premium</b> generated in a business combination associated with the stock price of the combined firm? Second, do the components of <b>acquisition</b> <b>premium</b> reflect changes in future performance, where performance is measured as operating income and operating cash flows? And, third, does the accounting treatment in business combinations result in differential associations of the components of <b>acquisition</b> <b>premium</b> with stock prices or changes in future performance? I find that, consistent with prior research, acquisition premia generated in business combinations are positively associated with the market values of equity of the combined firms. Also, I find acquisition premia generated in purchase transactions are positively associated with changes in future operating income and cash flows from operations. However, acquisition premia generated in pooling transactions are not associated with changes in future performance. I conclude that the value relevance of fair value accounting for non-financial assets depends in part on the context in which it is valued. ...|$|E
40|$|Announcements of {{acquisitions}} {{of publicly}} traded companies are usually accompanied by their share price booming by tens of percent.

Following Shleifer and Vishny (2003), we further argue that for overvalued acquirer firms the acquisitions enable acquirer CEOs to improve the long-term value of their illiquid wealth. Using a sample of 250 acquisitions during 1993 - 2001, we document several incentive effects of illiquid stock and option holdings.

Using a sample of 85, 560 cross-border mergers and acquisitions in 57 countries over the period 1990 to 2010, we find that firms with higher leverage are less likely to acquire foreign targets, whereas firms with lower leverage tend to be targets acquired by foreign firms. These effects are more pronounced in Asian countries than North America. <b>Acquisition</b> <b>premium,</b> the likelihood of all-cash offer and the percentage of cash in the acquisition offer decrease with leverage in cross-border mergers and acquisitions. Foreign targets gain positive abnormal returns in the both short run and long run, while acquirers earn positive abnormal returns in the short-run, but negative returns in the long run. We also find that firms adjust their capital structure after the acquisition by issuing more equity if they were overleveraged, or issuing more debt if they were underleveraged before the acquisition. Our results provide international evidence on how leverage affects managerial decision to acquire foreign targets, payment method and <b>acquisition</b> <b>premium</b> in cross-border mergers and acquisitions.

The objective of this thesis is to determine which synergies that different market actors consider as key synergies, how the actors quantify and value synergies and how the synergies impact the <b>acquisition</b> <b>premium.</b> The topic has been investigated through semi structured interviews and a survey with eight different market actors in the merger and acquisition industry. Our conclusions indicate that the assessment of what are key synergies depends on the reason to acquire and the time horizon of the buyer. Most actors find cost reducing synergies the easiest to quantify and common industry practice seems to be to only account for these in the acquisition business case. The most preferred method when valuing synergies related to mergers and acquisition is to use a discounted cash flow model and to utilize different comparable multiples as benchmarks. The value of the synergies creates a range for the <b>acquisition</b> <b>premium,</b> but since there is significant uncertainty related to the realization of them, the buyer is seldom willing to pay for more than fifty percent of the discounted value of the synergies...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: This master's thesis {{examines}} {{whether the}} change from local U. K. GAAP to IFRS has any impact on acquisition premiums paid in the U. K. The {{purpose of the study}} is to identify critical changes in acquisition accounting and study whether related changes in future reported earnings are likely to impact premiums paid despite zero impact on the intrinsic target firm value. DATA AND METHODOLOGY: The main sample consists of 178 acquisitions of control among firms listed in the U. K. between announcement dates of 1999 and 2012. Deal data is gathered from SDC, financial data from Worldscope and stock data from Datastream. The data is further complemented manually with CEO compensation, board stock holdings and purchase price allocation information from the annual reports of the acquirer for each transaction. The effect of variables related to IFRS is investigated using OLS regression with and without year fixed effects. The Baseline model is built from scratch by combining relevant literature and statistical methods to maximize adjusted r-square. The dependent variable in cross-sectional regressions is <b>acquisition</b> <b>premium.</b> The main hypothesis suggests that goodwill has a negative correlation with the premium paid and that effect is decreased after the adoption of IFRS. In addition the impact of CEO bonuses, managerial discretion in avoiding goodwill write-offs and the recognition of acquired finite life intangibles to <b>acquisition</b> <b>premium</b> is studied. FINDINGS OF THE STUDY: Before IFRS, goodwill variables correlate negatively and significantly with acquisition premiums. Although after the adoption of IFRS this association stays negative it is not significant anymore. Subsample analysis reveals that goodwill variables have significantly negative coefficients under U. K. GAAP only for transactions where CEOs have reported earnings related incentives. Goodwill recognised in business combinations is further significantly and positively correlated with <b>acquisition</b> <b>premium</b> for same transactions under IFRS. Results, however, do not support the view that organisationally complex firms could pay higher premiums after adopting IFRS due to increased managerial discretion in purchase price allocations. Results are relatively robust to an exhaustive number of control variables, alternative model specifications and variable transformations including Inverse Hyperbolic Sine transformations, as well as eliminations of statistically significant outliers...|$|E
