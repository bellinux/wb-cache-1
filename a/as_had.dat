5|$|A new note in Coutances' {{administration}} was his custom of issuing writs {{not in his}} own name, <b>as</b> <b>had</b> previously been the practice, but in the king's name. The archbishop also stressed that his decisions were made with the advice and consent {{of many of the}} leading nobles of the realm, as well as the barons of the Exchequer. This was a reaction against Longchamp's authoritarian method of government.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} {{infantry}} {{landing in the}} second wave, supporting arms began to arrive, meeting the same chaos and destruction <b>as</b> <b>had</b> the rifle companies.

50|$|In 2011, 96.3% {{of people}} {{described}} themselves as white, 2.2% <b>as</b> <b>having</b> mixed or multiple ethnic groups, 1.1% as being British Asian and 0.1% <b>as</b> <b>having</b> other ethnicity. 64.7% {{described themselves as}} Christian, 27.4% described themselves <b>as</b> <b>having</b> no religion, 6.7% did not specify a religion and 1% described themselves <b>as</b> <b>having</b> another religion.|$|R

30|$|We {{constructed}} {{a set of}} vignettes which allowed us to gauge how people who are described <b>as</b> <b>having</b> special needs are viewed in relation {{to people who are}} described <b>as</b> <b>having</b> a disability. If special needs is an ineffective euphemism, as we predicted, then people described <b>as</b> <b>having</b> special needs should be viewed more negatively than people described <b>as</b> <b>having</b> a disability, which is what we observed. Indeed, as we predicted, when people were described <b>as</b> <b>having</b> special needs, they were viewed more negatively than when they were described <b>as</b> <b>having</b> a specific disability (e.g., is blind, has Down syndrome, is autistic, has ADHD).|$|R
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>had</b> {{been made}} clear {{several times before}} and during the trial, Lamb's court victory did not make him a free man.

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>had</b> {{been the}} case with several {{previous}} films in the series, an entirely original story was required as there remained no Ian Fleming novels or stories to adapt. The scriptwriting process was finished very late due to lengthy disputes.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 20th century, Michigan's harsh winters {{had taken a}} toll on the terra cotta statue, <b>as</b> <b>had</b> {{vandalism}} by fans of MSU's rival school, the University of Michigan. While annual repair work helped stem {{the damage done by}} precipitation, extreme cold, and vandalism, the statue needed more intensive repair.|$|E
25|$|In 1930, Eglantine was {{recorded}} on Lloyd's Register <b>as</b> <b>having</b> a GRT of 6,325 with a NRT of 3,972.

30|$|As predicted, {{characters}} {{were significantly more}} likely to be chosen last when they were described <b>as</b> <b>having</b> special needs than when they were described <b>as</b> <b>having</b> a disability (z[*]=[*] 2.362, p[*]=[*] 0.009, one-tailed). Similarly, and as predicted, {{characters were}} significantly more likely to be chosen last when they were described <b>as</b> <b>having</b> special needs than when they were described <b>as</b> <b>having</b> a certain disability (z[*]=[*] 1.908, p[*]=[*] 0.028, one-tailed).|$|R

5|$|Following the Gator Bowl loss, Virginia Tech {{offensive}} coordinator and quarterbacks coach Rickey Bustle became {{the head coach}} at Louisiana-Lafayette <b>as</b> <b>had</b> been announced prior to the game. His position {{offensive coordinator}} was filled by then-offensive line coach Bryan Stinespring. To fill the quarterbacks coach position vacated by Bustle, Tech hired former Notre Dame offensive coordinator Kevin Rogers.|$|E
5|$|Henry Herbert Southey, {{physician}} to the recently deceased George IV, had travelled in the Duke's train, <b>as</b> <b>had</b> Dr Hunter, professor of anatomy at the University of Edinburgh. The {{two of them}} rushed to Huskisson's side, joined shortly afterwards by Joseph Brandreth, a Liverpool surgeon who had been travelling behind Phoenix. The doctors suggested returning Huskisson to Liverpool for treatment, but George Stephenson insisted {{that it would be}} better to take him on to Manchester.|$|E
5|$|In July 1995, Governor Rowland {{signed a}} bill {{ordering}} various studies, including one that analyzed extending service to New London <b>as</b> <b>had</b> been originally planned. Before the study was completed, ConnDOT unilaterally decided to implement New London service, which the report commended. On February 1, 1996, two round trips per weekday were extended to New London. At that point, ridership was up 18% over 1991 numbers.|$|E

5000|$|Hera Diani, {{writing in}} The Jakarta Post, {{describes}} the band <b>as</b> <b>having</b> a sound reminiscent {{of music from}} the 1960s and 1970s.

5|$|Linnaeus {{used the}} Latin {{name for the}} plant in {{formally}} describing the genus, although Matthias de l'Obel had previously used the name in describing various species of Narcissi in his Icones stirpium of 1591, and other publications, <b>as</b> <b>had</b> Clusius in Rariorum stirpium (1576).|$|E
5|$|Progress M1-5, {{which had}} {{originally}} been built to resupply and refuel either Mir or the International Space Station, was selected to perform the deorbit manoeuvre. Its mission earned it the nickname Hearse. It was a Progress-M1 11F615A55 spacecraft, with the serial number 254. An uninhabited area of the southern Pacific Ocean was selected for the station to be deorbited into, <b>as</b> <b>had</b> been done with five earlier Salyut spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|Sharp {{took office}} at a {{critical}} time Kentucky's history. Still reeling from the financial Panic of 1819, state politicians had split into two camps: those who supported legislation favorable to debtors (the Debt Relief Party) and those who favored the protection of creditors (typically called Anti-Reliefers.) Sharp had identified with the Relief Party, <b>as</b> <b>had</b> Governor Adair.|$|E
30|$|Thus, {{characters}} described <b>as</b> <b>having</b> {{special needs}} were most frequently chosen last, indicating that special needs is an ineffective euphemism. Characters described <b>as</b> <b>having</b> special needs were chosen last even {{more frequently than}} characters described <b>as</b> <b>having</b> a disability or a certain disability, suggesting that the euphemism special needs conveys more negativity than the non-euphemized term disability or the names of specific disabilities (e.g., blind). If special needs was an effective euphemism, then we would have observed that characters described <b>as</b> <b>having</b> special needs were chosen last less often than characters described <b>as</b> <b>having</b> a disability or a certain disability. But, as predicted, we observed just the opposite.|$|R

This identification was accepted by the British Ornithologists Union's Records Committee, leading to the addition of this species to the British List. The record is currently being reviewed again by BBRC to establish whether this earlier decision should be upheld.|$|E
