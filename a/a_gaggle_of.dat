500|$|A {{group of}} editors writing for People also praised the record's [...] "fresh and original" [...] melodies and [...] "quick-tempoed cool", adding, [...] "Kudos to Green Day, young punk's reigning purists, for {{sticking}} {{with what they}} know best." [...] Sandy Masuo of the Los Angeles Times enjoyed the [...] "mature songwriting that really makes this album tick", noting that [...] "Naturally, a couple of thrash 'n' bash hard-core paeans are included, but they're surrounded by songs that are surprisingly varied in character and grounded in a pop aesthetic that evokes <b>a</b> <b>gaggle</b> <b>of</b> great tunesmiths." [...] Stephen Thompson of The A.V. Club wrote, [...] "If Green Day still has a loyal following, its fans are bound {{to find something to}} like on Nimrod; for all the attempts at diversity, the record is packed with mile-wide hooks and sing-along anthems." ...|$|E
500|$|The moody [...] "It Gets Heavy" [...] {{features}} Guerrero and Gresham Taylor singing, and {{is reminiscent}} of trip hop artist Tricky, contributing to the album's general sound of hip-hop infected Latin soul. Its lyrics {{have been described as}} [...] "socially conscious but thought-provoking". Cited by critics as the standout track on the album, Bryan Carroll described it as [...] "the sole hip-shaker among <b>a</b> <b>gaggle</b> <b>of</b> moodier pieces". The bongo-driven track [...] "Lost Unfound" [...] has Guerrero occupying all instruments, and the album's third vocal track, [...] "Gettin' It Together", features rapper Lyrics Born delivering a blend of emceeing and singing, which is a departure from his previous work. One music writer described the album's closing track, [...] "Falling Awake", as [...] "the most beautiful song Guerrero’s written to date". The song contains melancholic piano arrangements. Another critic noted [...] "Falling Awake"s meditative sound, writing that its light guitar melodies are [...] "slowly ascending on a journey of Satori".|$|E

The [...] "dynamic duo take a saber saw to a glistening new Maybach {{and turn it}} into a tricked-out 'Thunderdome' cruiser, then do doughnuts in a parking lot with <b>a</b> <b>gaggle</b> <b>of</b> models packed in the back." [...] The video [...] "eschews the narrative spazzouts and stoner-boggling tricks of previous Jonze videos" [...] preferring instead to [...] "luxuriate in the icon status of its two principals. We get fireworks, fist bumps, a fast car, and general larger-than-life camaraderie rather than, say, guys on fire running in slow-motion. It's like The Expendables, if that movie only starred two guys, and both of them were rappers who didn't do any onscreen fighting."

Though factious and disparate, these groups attempt to coordinate their activities through a loose alliance called the Caucus.

Three 7" [...] singles were {{released}} in 1997 and 1998, the latter ("Evil Heat") getting considerable airplay on BBC Radio 1. These singles were compiled onto the 6 Fingers of Benson mini-album on Deceptive Records. The United Colors of Benson EP followed in November 1998, these early release seeing them described as <b>a</b> [...] "geeky <b>gaggle</b> <b>of</b> quirk-rock experimentalists".|$|R
500|$|Dre's {{handling}} of the production was praised by critics. AllMusic writer Stephen Erlewine stated: [...] "Dre realized that it wasn't time to push the limits of G-funk, and instead decided to deepen it musically, creating easy-rolling productions that have more layers than they appear". He added that the beats were [...] "laid-back funky, continuing to resonate after many listens". Rolling Stone writer Touré noted [...] "The Chronics slow, heavy beats were a sonic representation of angry depression as accurate as Cobain's feedback blasts; Doggystyle is leaner, with its high-tempo Isaac Hayes- and Curtis Mayfield-derived tracks". He {{went on to say}} that [...] "Most of Dre's hooks and nearly all his beats refuse to linger, as if the songs themselves are nervous, fearful of exposure, restless to get offscreen." [...] Entertainment Weekly magazine's David Browne mentioned that [...] "The mix of samples and live music on Dre's latest, The Chronic, gave it texture and depth, and he continues his knob-turning growth on Doggystyle, fluidly weaving together <b>a</b> <b>gaggle</b> <b>of</b> background singers and rappers, quirky samples, his trademark horror-flick keyboard lines". The Source magazine columinst wrote: [...] "Dre's brand of G-funk may be common now, but it is still painstakingly well-produced".|$|E

2500|$|Some dinosaurs in {{the film}} are feathered. Brusatte said, [...] "Over the past 15 years, we have {{collected}} thousands of specimens of feathered dinosaurs – proper bona fide dinosaurs covered in feathers." [...] New Scientist reported that [...] "no evidence has yet been found" [...] {{to suggest that the}} Pachyrhinosaurus or the Gorgosaurus were feathered. Director Cook said of the Gorgosaurus, [...] "We decided that we wouldn't put feathers on that one, but we did give that dinosaur iridescent scales." [...] National Geographic said, [...] "Many paleontologists and dinosaur fans are disappointed that CGI docudrama's villains, <b>a</b> <b>gaggle</b> <b>of</b> iridescent Gorgosaurus, are devoid of any fluff or fuzz." [...] Shortly after the filmmakers designed their Gorgosaurus for the film, the tyrannosauroid Yutyrannus was discovered with direct evidence of feathers. While older than Gorgosaurus, Yutyrannus provides further evidence of feathers in tyrannosauroids. National Geographic also noted that Gorgosaurus was depicted as feathered in the 2011 direct-to-video film March of the Dinosaurs.|$|E
40|$|Light of Extinction {{presents}} a diverse series of views into the complex antics <b>of</b> <b>a</b> semi-autonomous <b>gaggle</b> <b>of</b> robotic actants. Audiences initially {{enter into the}} 'backend' of the experience to be rudely confronted with the raw, messy operations of a horde of object-manipulating robotic forms. Seen through viewing apertures these ‘things’ deny any opportunity to grasp their imagined order. Audiences then flow on into the 'front end' of the work where now, seen through another aperture, the very same forms seemingly coordinate a stunning deep-field choreography, floating lusciously within inky landscapes of media, noise and embodied sound. As one series of conceptions slip into extinction, so others flow on in. The idea of the 'extinction of human experience' expresses a projected fear for that which will disappear when biodiverse worlds have descended into an era of permanent darkness. ‘Light Of Extinction' re-positions this anthropomorphic lament in order to suggest a more rounded acknowledgement of what might still remain - suggesting the previously unacknowledged power and place of autonomous, synthetic creation. Momentary disbelief gives way to a relieving celebration of the imagined birth of ‘things’ – without need for staples such as conventional light or the harmonious lullabies of long-extinguished sounds...|$|R

50|$|With {{the delayed}} Superbike and Sidecar Race 'A' {{the race to}} be held on Monday were moved to Tuesday 9 June 2009 with an amended race {{schedule}} with the first race being held was the 4 lap (150.73 mile) Supersport Race 1. The pole time for the Supersport race was set by Michael Dunlop at an average speed of 126.299 mph. In what {{was considered to be}} a highly contested race it was the unfortunate Michael Dunlop that was the first retirement on lap 1 at Snugbrough near the 2nd Milestone. Despite only setting fifth fastest in practice it was Bruce Anstey riding a 600 cc Suzuki that led at the official timing point at Glen Helen by 1.73 seconds from the 600 cc Honda of Guy Martin with Ian Hutchinson just 0.5 second behind in third place also riding a Honda motorcycle. <b>A</b> further <b>gaggle</b> <b>of</b> riders covered by five seconds included the Honda of John McGuinness in fourth place followed by the Kawasaki of Conor Cummins then Keith Amor with the 600 cc Yamaha of Ian Lougher in seventh place at Glen Helen on lap 1. The places were reversed at the Ramsey Hairpin on lap 1 with Guy Martin now leading Bruce Anstey by 0.3 seconds. The first lap of the Supersport Race 1 was completed by Guy Martin in 18 minutes and 3.37 seconds at an average speed of 125.375 and Ian Hutchinson passed Bruce Anstey for second place on the Mountain Section of the course on corrected time.|$|R

40|$|I {{am writing}} my fi rst paper as a postdoc and am wrangling {{with the head}} of the lab over—of all things— the title. Our {{different}} ideas started off as an easygoing give and take conversation a few weeks ago, with him wanting a title I consider too bland and me wanting one with a bit more punch, which he thinks is too “glitzy. ” (We are the only two authors, so at least there isn’t <b>a</b> whole <b>gaggle</b> <b>of</b> ideas and viewpoints.) But now he is digging in his heels and I am sensing that the temperature is rising. We have a good relationship and I don’t want to imperil it over something like the title of a paper. I won’t give more details here to protect my anonymity, but I would appreciate Labby’s general perspectives on how to craft titles of scientifi c papers. —Entitled Dear Entitled, There are many views on this and it is not uncommon for a young scientist and a more senior coauthor to have different outlooks. For one thing, an investigator who is well into his or her career may have established a certain style in previous publications not co-authored and may wish to maintain it—at least to some degree. An interesting twist in your case is that it is the more junior of you who wants the more creative title, whereas it is often the other way around. Labby personally believes that titles should be quite engaging, but, of course, not coercive or misleading. Presumably your mentor at least disavows titles like “Effects of Cobalt on the Activity of Guinea Pig Spleen Phosphodiesterase Between pH 6. 5 and 8. 0 in th...|$|R
