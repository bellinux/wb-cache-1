5|$|Construction of the {{motorway}} {{began in}} 1990, lbut a decade-long hiatus between the mid-1990s and 2004 caused by funding {{issues and the}} setting up of a separate company to develop and operate the motorway meant it was not completed until 2007. As of July 2011, the entire motorway route is completed, consisting of a dual-carriageway and four traffic lanes, except for <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>short</b> segment which is still a single carriageway road. The motorway is currently operated by Autocesta Zagreb - Macelj.|$|E
5|$|Convective rain, or showery precipitation, occurs from {{convective}} clouds (e.g., cumulonimbus or cumulus congestus). It falls as showers with {{rapidly changing}} intensity. Convective precipitation falls over a certain area for <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>short</b> time, as convective clouds have limited horizontal extent. Most precipitation {{in the tropics}} appears to be convective; however, {{it has been suggested}} that stratiform precipitation also occurs. Graupel and hail indicate convection. In mid-latitudes, convective precipitation is intermittent and often associated with baroclinic boundaries such as cold fronts, squall lines, and warm fronts.|$|E
5|$|Discontinuation of benzodiazepines or abrupt {{reduction}} of the dose, even after <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>short</b> course of treatment (three to four weeks), may result in two groups of symptoms—rebound and withdrawal.

40|$|This study aims {{to examine}} {{recidivism}} patterns {{and the influence of}} imprisonment length for all homicide offenders who have been convicted in the Netherlands between 1996 and 2004. In addition, we tested whether imprisonment effects differed between homicide offenders with different characteristics. Analyses on 621 homicide offenders indicate that longer imprisonment systematically increases recidivism frequency, not recidivism speed. We find some indications that imprisonment length increases recidivism to a greater extent for offenders with an intimate partner, with a Western ethnic background and for offenders with <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>shorter</b> detention history prior to the homicide...|$|R
5|$|Adiantum viridimontanum largely reproduces asexually by {{branching}} {{rather than}} sexually through spores. While wind-blown spores {{can result in}} sexual reproduction for the species, most spores probably fall within <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>short</b> radius of the plant. In addition, reproduction through spore dispersal requires the spore to land in suitable conditions for generating a gametophyte, typically in bright sunlight on thin serpentine soils. These requirements allow A.viridimontanum to colonize recently disturbed sites on ultramafic outcrops, where bedrock has been exposed and competing plants have been removed. The populations appear stable, with the long life of individuals compensating for low recruitment rates.|$|E
5|$|After the six 735kV wires {{split up}} {{into two groups}} of three power lines each, the HVDC line follows the eastern group, and the western set diverges away. The line remains {{overhead}} until it reaches {{the north shore of}} the Saint Lawrence River near Grondines, where the 450kV HVDC line descends into an underwater tunnel traversing the river. The power line surfaces on the south shore near Lotbinière substation. After the river crossing, the line enters into the Nicolet terminal near Sainte-Eulalie, northeast of Drummondville. South of the terminal, the line heads south and after <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>short</b> distance, it enters the Des Cantons close to Sherbrooke.|$|E
5|$|Bottom-dwelling and inactive, {{the tiger}} {{catshark}} feeds {{on a wide}} variety of fishes and invertebrates from on or near the sea floor. An oviparous species, the female retains her eggs internally until the embryos are at an advanced state of development, resulting in <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>short</b> hatching time after laying. Between 12 and 22 encapsulated eggs are produced at a time, which the female attaches to the bottom. The tiger catshark is caught incidentally by commercial and recreational fishers but has no economic value. It has been listed as Data Deficient by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), pending more information.|$|E

5|$|Cairano's career covers {{just over}} two decades (circa 1490–1510), <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>short</b> period, during which, moreover, the {{majority}} of works produced is concentrated in the latter decade. Among these, nearly three-quarters are religious commissions, executed {{mainly because of the}} greater funding available from such sources and the increased likelihood of their conservation over time. Numerous sculptures also stemmed from private commissions, especially funerary tombs, as well as secular cycles such as that of the Caesars. In many works, there is an evident, and sometimes overwhelming architectural component that indicates the careful preparations made by Cairano in this field. Cairano was lauded, as for example by the municipality of Chiari where he was explicitly named lapicida architectum et ingeniarum optimum.|$|E
5|$|Decompression {{theory is}} the study and {{modelling}} of {{the transfer of the}} inert gas component of breathing gases from the gas in the lungs to the tissues of the diver and back during exposure to variations in ambient pressure. In the case of underwater diving and compressed air work, this mostly involves ambient pressures greater than the local surface pressure—but astronauts, high altitude mountaineers, and occupants of unpressurized aircraft, are exposed to ambient pressures less than standard sea level atmospheric pressure. In all cases, the symptoms of decompression sickness occur during or within <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>short</b> period of hours, or occasionally days, after a significant reduction of ambient pressure.|$|E
5|$|Fourteen {{isotopes}} of berkelium {{were identified}} with mass numbers 238–252.

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the energy {{utilization}} of rotary hearth furnace (RHF), some methods were raised to solve the problem. Through changing the inlet angle of the nozzle, a higher and more uniform temperature field can be got. Thus, the burden in the furnace can be heated to the reduction temperature in <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>shorter</b> time. By using multilayer pellets technology, the energy can be utilized as much as possible. However, the top layer pellets would be reoxidized when the middle and bottom layer pellets were reduced.

50|$|Hems of {{different}} depths (which includes the seam allowance) {{may have a}} particular style to achieve, which requires more or less fabric depending upon the style. A handkerchief-style edge requires a hem allowance of 0.6 cm or a quarter inch. A typical skirt or pant hem may be 5-7.6 cm. The hem's depth affects the way {{the fabric of the}} finished fabric will drape. Heavier fabric requires <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>shorter</b> hem. An interface fabric sewn to the fabric in the hem has a useful function in some hem styles. A bias strip is sometimes used as a hem interface.
