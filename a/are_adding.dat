Examples of applying inflectional morphemes to words <b>are</b> <b>adding</b> -s to the root dog to form dogs and adding -ed to wait to form waited. In English, there are eight inflections.|$|E

We interviewed six site creators {{to understand the}} motivations they felt and the challenges they encountered. We found that these challenges ultimately resulted {{from a lack of}} information visibility, particularly concerning work in progress. Less technically skilled interviewees coped with these challenges by collaborating with other people, but they were less positive about their respective site’s success compared to interviewees whose skills enabled them to work alone. We conclude by outlining opportunities for research aimed at helping people more rapidly and effectively collaborate on future web-centric projects...|$|R

25|$|Several {{major cities}} in the world <b>are</b> <b>adding</b> hybrid taxis to their taxicab fleets, led by San Francisco where hybrid {{represent}} almost 50% of its taxicab fleet by March 2010, and New York City where hybrids taxis represent 45% of the city's total fleet by September 2012. Unlike conventional gasoline cars, hybrids get better fuel economy, do well at slow speeds or idling, and have cleaner emissions.|$|E
25|$|Unsustainable {{land use}} {{practices}} {{are threatening to}} degrade watersheds and <b>are</b> <b>adding</b> to the growing complexities of managing groundwater. Additionally, the volcanic aquifers consist mainly of interstratifications of gaps and fissures which allow for high permeability and infiltration. In many cases, these make the aquifers highly vulnerable to human contamination from the cities in which they support. The heterogeneity of these aquifers make them complicated to study and manage. Consequently, growing signs of conflict and competition for water use between sector needs are being observed in some regions.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason for}} this is that human {{activities}} <b>are</b> <b>adding</b> CO2 to the atmosphere faster than natural processes can remove it (see carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere for a complete explanation). This is analogous to a flow of water into a bathtub. So long as the tap runs water (analogous to the emission of carbon dioxide) into the tub faster than water escapes through the plughole (the natural removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere), then the level of water in the tub (analogous to the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere) will continue to rise.|$|E

25|$|The {{convergence}} of content, technology, and broadband access allows consumers to stream television shows and movies to their high-definition television {{in competition with}} traditional service providers (Cable TV and Satellite Television). The research company SNL Kagan expects 12 million households, roughly 10%, to go without cable, satellite or telco video service by 2015 using Over The Top services. This represents a new trend in the broadcast television industry, as the list of options for watching movies and TV over the Internet grows every day. Research also shows that even as traditional television service providers are trimming their customer base, they <b>are</b> <b>adding</b> Broadband Internet customers. Nearly 76.6 million U.S. households get broadband from leading cable and telephone companies, although only a portion have sufficient speeds to support quality video streaming. Convergence devices for home entertainment will likely play a much larger role {{in the future of}} broadcast television, effectively shifting traditional revenue streams while providing consumers with more options.|$|E
