5|$|Flagg first {{appeared}} in The Stand as a demonic figure who wreaks havoc after a plague kills most of the population. He makes his second appearance in The Eyes of the Dragon as an evil wizard trying to plunge the fictional medieval city of Delain into chaos. Flagg was a primary antagonist in King's epic series, The Dark Tower, who tries to keep protagonist Roland Deschain from reaching the Tower—the linchpin of existence—so he can claim it for himself and become a god. The Dark Tower expanded on Flagg's background <b>and</b> <b>motivation,</b> linking his previous appearances. Aside from King's novels, Flagg was featured in a television miniseries adaptation of The Stand {{in which he was}} portrayed by Jamey Sheridan and The Dark Tower film adaptation in which he was portrayed by Matthew McConaughey. He has also appeared in Marvel Comics' adaptations of The Dark Tower and The Stand.|$|E

5|$|On December9, 1964, Clarence13X {{was shot}} {{twice in the}} torso while at a popular {{gathering}} place {{in the basement of}} a Harlem tenement. He was brought to Harlem Hospital, where he was treated and released. He later claimed that he died and returned to his body a short time later. In a 2007 study of the Five Percent movement, American journalist Michael Muhammad Knight speculates that this caused his followers to see him as a Christ figure. The identity <b>and</b> <b>motivation</b> of the shooter are unknown; Knight notes that law enforcement and rival Muslim groups both had a motive to attack Clarence13X. Some Five Percenters have speculated that the attack was part of a robbery attempt or retaliation for unpaid gambling debts. Clarence13X's companions reported that he instructed them not to seek revenge on the shooter and to forswear violence. While recuperating from his wounds, Clarence13X sought to distinguish his movement from other Islamic movements, abandoning Arabic greetings for English expressions.|$|E

5|$|Struggling with {{injuries}} <b>and</b> <b>motivation</b> issues after his exhaustive U.S. tour in 1925, Nurmi found his long-time rivals Ville Ritola and Edvin Wide ever more serious challengers. At the 1928 Summer Olympics, Nurmi recaptured the 10,000 m title but was beaten {{for the gold}} in the 5000 m and the 3000 m steeplechase. He then {{turned his attention to}} longer distances, breaking the world records for events such as the one hour run and the 25-mile marathon. Nurmi intended to end his career with a marathon gold medal, as his idol Kolehmainen had done. In a controversial case that strained Finland–Sweden relations and sparked an inter-IAAF battle, Nurmi was suspended before the 1932 Games by an IAAF council that questioned his amateur status. Two days before the opening ceremonies, the council rejected his entries. Although he was never declared a professional, Nurmi's suspension became definite in 1934 and he retired from running.|$|E

5|$|Psilocybin {{is rapidly}} dephosphorylated {{in the body}} to psilocin, which is a partial agonist for several {{serotonin}} receptors, which are also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors. Psilocin has a high affinity for the 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptors in the human brain, and with a slightly lower affinity for the 5-HT2A receptor. Psilocin binds with low affinity to 5-HT1 receptors, including 5-HT1A and 5-HT1D. Serotonin receptors are located in numerous parts of the brain, including the cerebral cortex, and {{are involved in a}} wide range of functions, including regulation of mood <b>and</b> <b>motivation.</b> The psychotomimetic (psychosis-mimicking) effects of psilocin can be blocked in a dose-dependent fashion by the 5-HT2A antagonist drug ketanserin. Various lines of evidence have shown that interactions with non-5-HT2 receptors also contribute to the subjective and behavioral effects of the drug. For example, psilocin indirectly increases the concentration of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the basal ganglia, and some psychotomimetic symptoms of psilocin are reduced by haloperidol, a non-selective dopamine receptor antagonist. Taken together, these suggest that there may be an indirect dopaminergic contribution to psilocin's psychotomimetic effects. Unlike LSD, which binds to D2-like dopamine receptors in addition to having strong affinity for several 5-HT receptors, psilocybin and psilocin have no affinity for the dopamine D2 receptors.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{investigation}} was to examine the impact of experienced regret on the formation of goal-relevant intentions <b>and</b> <b>motivations.</b> Based on functional emotion theories, which posit emotions are coordinated responses that resolve challenges to goals, experienced regret was expected to increase the formation of goal relevant intentions <b>and</b> <b>motivations,</b> even in domains unrelated to the source of regret. The present investigation also assessed one potential mechanism that might contribute to this relationship ? narrowed focus of attention. Study 1 examined the impact of experienced regret on attention and formation of goal-relevant intentions <b>and</b> <b>motivations.</b> Participants wrote narratives to elicit experienced regret, anticipated regret, or a neutral state. They then completed a global-local task to measure attention, and indicated intentions <b>and</b> <b>motivations</b> to pursue an important goal. Study 2 examined the impact of experienced regret on attention and formation of goal-relevant intentions <b>and</b> <b>motivations</b> in a same or different domain as the source of regret. Participants read scenarios to elicit experienced regret (over a social situation) or a neutral state. They then completed a global-local task to measure attention, and indicated intentions <b>and</b> <b>motivations</b> to pursue either an important social goal (same domain) or health goal (different domain). Study 3 examined the impact of experienced regret on goal pursuit over time, and in a real world domain. Participants wrote narratives to elicit experienced regret, and then indicated intentions <b>and</b> <b>motivations</b> to pursue their New Year?s Resolution. Overall, hypotheses were not supported in this investigation- experienced regret did not increase goal-relevant intentions or motivations in either a same or different domain. Although null findings cannot be clearly interpreted, the findings in the present investigation might suggest that experienced regret has no impact on goal pursuit, or that its impact is at least limited to decisions in a particular domain. Future investigations should address potential limitations, as well as assess goal pursuit under more controlled condition...|$|R
