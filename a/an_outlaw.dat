5|$|During the game, Quickdraw must {{locate the}} wanted outlaws one by one. Once <b>an</b> <b>outlaw</b> {{has been found}} and shot (shooting the outlaw does not kill him, but only initiates a duel), the game shifts to the first-person {{targeting}} minigame. This time, the player must shoot the rapidly moving outlaw as quickly as possible. The player can either wait for the outlaw to draw, or take the initiative and shoot first, which will make the bandit draw his weapon as well. If the player successfully shoots <b>an</b> <b>outlaw,</b> a bounty is paid (increasing with every round), and a new outlaw enters the town.|$|E

5|$|During the 13th century, a folktale {{developed}} in which Richard’s minstrel Blondel roamed (singing a song {{known only to}} him and Richard) to find Richard's prison. This story was the foundation of André Ernest Modeste Grétry's opera Richard Coeur-de-Lion, and inspired the opening of Richard Thorpe's film version of Ivanhoe. Sixteenth-century tales of Robin Hood began describing him as a contemporary (and supporter) of Richard the Lionheart; Robin became <b>an</b> <b>outlaw</b> {{during the reign of}} Richard's evil brother, John, while Richard was fighting in the Third Crusade.|$|E

Desha confessed that he had been living as <b>an</b> <b>outlaw</b> since his father's pardon. Crawford urged Desha to abandon his illegal activities and offered to give him free passage to New Orleans, Louisiana. Desha accepted, telling Crawford that he planned to travel on to a distant place, assume a new name, and seek a fresh start.|$|E
5|$|In 1858, {{the rival}} Obrenović dynasty seized {{power in the}} country and forced Prince Alexander Karađorđević into exile. Ljotić's father was forced out of the country in 1868 after being implicated in a {{conspiracy}} against the Obrenović dynasty and its head, Prince Milan. He did not return to Serbia until Milan's abdication on 6 March 1889. Apart from being a close friend of Serbia's future king, Peter I, Ljotić's father was also the first person to translate The Communist Manifesto into Serbian.

The Eastern Cape region of South Africa has the impundulu, which can {{take the form of a}} large taloned bird and can summon thunder and lightning, and the Betsileo people of Madagascar tell of the ramanga, <b>an</b> <b>outlaw</b> or living vampire who drinks the blood and eats the nail {{clippings}} of nobles.|$|E
5|$|During the Chunin exams, Team 7 {{encounters}} Orochimaru, an infamous ninja exiled from Konoha, who infects Sasuke with a curse mark. When active, {{the mark}} increases Sasuke's physical abilities, but makes him cruel and sadistic, as the mark contains {{a fragment of}} Orochimaru's consciousness. Soon after, Kakashi teaches Sasuke his own Chidori technique, attempting to appease his desire for power. During the siege of Konoha, Sasuke is beaten by Gaara, but is rescued by Naruto. Not long after, Itachi returns to Konoha and Sasuke attempts to kill him, only to be beaten and tortured. In response, Sasuke decides he has to leave Team 7 and Konoha {{in order to become}} stronger. Believing Orochimaru's tutelage will make him more powerful, Sasuke defects from Konoha and becomes <b>an</b> <b>outlaw.</b> Naruto follows him, and the two fight when Sasuke refuses to return.

5|$|Forster was {{a central}} figure of the Enlightenment in Germany, and corresponded with most of its adherents, {{including}} his close friend Georg Christoph Lichtenberg. His ideas and personality influenced Alexander von Humboldt, {{one of the great}} scientists of the 19th century. When the French took control of Mainz in 1792, Forster became {{one of the founders of}} the city's Jacobin Club and went on to play a leading role in the Mainz Republic, the earliest republican state in Germany. During July 1793 and while he was in Paris as a delegate of the young Mainz Republic, Prussian and Austrian coalition forces regained control of the city and Forster was declared <b>an</b> <b>outlaw.</b> Unable to return to Germany and separated from his friends and family, he died in Paris of illness in early 1794.|$|E
5|$|Harrison Clark left South Africa in 1887, but it {{is unclear}} why; {{according}} to a story that may be apocryphal, he fled the country as <b>an</b> <b>outlaw</b> soon after his revolver fired—by accident, so the story goes—and killed a man. Whatever the truth, he travelled to Mozambique, then a Portuguese territory, where {{he made his way}} upriver along the Zambezi until he reached Feira, a long-abandoned Portuguese settlement at the confluence of the Zambezi and Luangwa Rivers, in what is today southern Zambia. Feira was founded by missionaries from Portugal in about 1720, but by 1887 it was a ghost town. Its last inhabitants had fled amid a native rising about half a century before, and since then it had been deserted.|$|E
5|$|The Ordainers {{once more}} sent Gaveston into exile in 1311, but by 1312 he was back. Now the king's {{favourite}} was officially <b>an</b> <b>outlaw,</b> and Arundel {{was among the}} earls who swore to hunt him down. The leader of the oppositionafter Lincoln's death the year beforewas now Thomas, Earl of Lancaster. In June 1312 Gaveston was captured, tried before Lancaster, Arundel and the earls of Warwick and Hereford, and executed. A reconciliation was achieved between the king and the offending magnates, and Arundel and the others received pardons, but animosity prevailed. In 1314 Arundel was among the magnates who refused to assist Edward in a campaign against the Scots, contributing to the disastrous English defeat at the Battle of Bannockburn.|$|E

5|$|There {{were four}} Exigenters tasked with issuing and {{controlling}} {{the process of}} declaring someone <b>an</b> <b>Outlaw,</b> with each Exigenter assigned a set of counties. The most valuable of the Exigenterships was that for London, Middlesex, Sussex, Kent, Dorset, Somerset, Devon, Cambridgeshire, Huntingdonshire, Bristol and Exeter due {{to the number of}} processes each year, with London alone handling over 100 documents a year by the mid-1550s. By tradition the Exigenter for Yorkshire and the other northern counties was also Filazer for Northumberland, Westmorland, Cumberland and Newcastle, and Clerk of the King's Silver for the entire country. There were also thirteen Filazers, who shared counties between them according to historical divisions, and were tasked with filing judicial writs for their counties and transferring them to the Custos Brevium for filing. A fourteenth Filazer was appointed for Monmouthshire in 1542, but other than this there were no changes to the position until the abolition of the court.|$|E
5|$|After Godwin left England, {{he went to}} Flanders, and {{gathered}} a fleet and mercenaries to force the king to allow his return. In the summer of 1052, Godwin returned to England and was met by his sons, who had invaded from Ireland. By September, they were advancing on London, where negotiations between the king and the earl were conducted {{with the help of}} Stigand, the Bishop of Winchester. When it became apparent that Godwin would be returning, Robert quickly left England with Bishop Ulf of Dorchester and Bishop William of London, probably once again taking Wulfnoth and Hakon with him as hostages, whether with the permission of King Edward or not. Robert was declared <b>an</b> <b>outlaw</b> and deposed from his archbishopric on 14September 1052 at a royal council, mainly because the returning Godwin felt that Robert, along with a number of other Normans, had been the driving force behind his exile. Robert journeyed to Rome to complain to the pope about his own exile, where Leo IX and successive popes condemned Stigand, whom Edward had appointed to Canterbury. Robert's personal property was divided between Earl Godwin, Harold Godwinson, and the queen, who had returned to court.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{a decree}} by Emperor Francis II inflicting punishments on German {{subjects}} who {{collaborated with the}} French revolutionary government, Forster was declared <b>an</b> <b>outlaw</b> and placed under the Imperial ban; a prize of 100 ducats was set {{on his head and}} he could not return to Germany. Devoid of all means of making a living and without his wife, who had stayed in Mainz with their children and her later husband Ludwig Ferdinand Huber, he remained in Paris. At this point the revolution in Paris had entered the Reign of Terror introduced by the Committee of Public Safety under the rule of Maximilien Robespierre. Forster had the opportunity to experience the difference between the promises of the revolution of happiness for all and its cruel practice. In contrast to many other German supporters of the revolution, like for instance Friedrich Schiller, Forster did not turn back from his revolutionary ideals under the pressure of the terror. He viewed the events in France as a force of nature that could not be slowed and that had to release its own energies to avoid being even more destructive.|$|E

50|$|Outlaw {{cards are}} worth two capture points each. A meld of three must be played {{the first time}} any player lays down cards for <b>a</b> {{particular}} <b>outlaw.</b> After that, outlaw cards can be played individually, by any player, though rules encourage multiple cards to be played at a time. That's because playing <b>a</b> single <b>outlaw</b> card does not increase <b>an</b> <b>outlaw's</b> reward; playing {{two at a time}} add $1000 to the reward, playing three at a time adds $2000, and so on; in other words, the reward added for a play is (N &minus; 1) &times; $1000, whereN is the number of outlaw cards being played together.|$|R

5|$|In June 1832 Yagan led a {{party of}} Aborigines in attacking two labourers sowing a field of wheat {{alongside}} the Canning River near Kelmscott. One of the men, John Thomas, escaped, but the other, William Gaze, was wounded and later died as a result. The settlement declared Yagan <b>an</b> <b>outlaw</b> and offered a reward of £20 for his capture. He avoided capture until early October 1832. A group of fishermen enticed Yagan and two companions into their boat, then pushed off into deep water. The fishermen took the three Noongar men to the Perth guardhouse, from which they were transferred to the Round House at Fremantle. Yagan was sentenced to death, but he was saved by the intercession of settler Robert Lyon. Arguing that Yagan was defending his land against invasion, Lyon said Yagan {{should not be considered}} a criminal but a prisoner of war and suggested he should be treated as such. At the recommendation of John Septimus Roe, the Surveyor-General of Western Australia, Yagan and his men were exiled on Carnac Island under the supervision of Lyon and two soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Red Dead Redemption {{makes use}} of a {{morality}} system where players {{have the ability to}} gain positive or negative honor. Honor can be gained by making morally positive choices, such as taking in <b>an</b> <b>outlaw</b> alive or saving a woman from a kidnapping. The player character's overall honor standard is lowered for committing crimes or other negative choices. This works in conjunction with another system, fame, which affects how people react based on Marston's honor status. If Marston has little honor, non-player characters will feel insecure around him. If he has a high amount of honor, other characters will usually greet him and feel safe around him. He will also receive discounts in some stores, more pay for jobs and other bonuses. A very low honor rating can result in a town's establishments closing their doors when Marston arrives. To combat this he can disguise himself by wearing a bandana when performing criminal acts; alternatively, a very negative or criminal reputation warrants the player a large amount of respect and steep discounts from bandits and fencers at criminal hideouts, such as Thieves' Landing.|$|E
5|$|Two {{days after}} Knox arrived in Edinburgh, he {{proceeded}} to Dundee where {{a large number of}} Protestant sympathisers had gathered. Knox was declared <b>an</b> <b>outlaw,</b> and the Queen Regent summoned the Protestants to Stirling. Fearing the possibility of a summary trial and execution, the Protestants proceeded instead to Perth, a walled town that could be defended in case of a siege. At the church of St John the Baptist, Knox preached a fiery sermon and a small incident precipitated into a riot. A mob poured into the church and it was soon gutted. The mob then attacked two friaries in the town, looting their gold and silver and smashing images. Mary of Guise gathered those nobles loyal to her and a small French army. She dispatched the Earl of Argyll and Lord Moray to offer terms and avert a war. She promised not to send any French troops into Perth if the Protestants evacuated the town. The Protestants agreed, but when the Queen Regent entered Perth, she garrisoned it with Scottish soldiers on the French pay roll. This was seen as treacherous by Lord Argyll and Lord Moray, who both switched sides and joined Knox, who now based himself in St Andrews. Knox's return to St Andrews fulfilled the prophecy he made in the galleys that he would one day preach again in its church. When he did give a sermon, the effect was the same as in Perth. The people engaged in vandalism and looting.|$|E
