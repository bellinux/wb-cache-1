An oceanic reanalysis data set is used to investigate {{the response of the}} circulation in the Southern Ocean to the decadal variability of SAM. Our results indicate the strengthening and the poleward shift of the northward Ekman velocity as well as the Ekman pumping rate, which led to a corresponding strengthening trend in the Deacon Cell. This strengthening, in turn, intensified the meridional density gradient and the tilting of the isopycnal surfaces.

Historical hydrographic and altimetric measurements in the region suggest that the most likely explanation for the change is increased entrainment of warmer mid-depth Circumpolar Deep Water by cascading shelf water plumes close to Cape Darnley, where the Indian-sourced AABW entering the Weddell gyre from the east is ventilated.

5|$|Distance {{from the}} sea is another {{important}} geographic factor. Owing {{to the shape of}} the country, the close proximity to the ocean means that most of the country, excluding the north is moderated by the surrounding oceans, leading to lower thermal amplitudes than comparable latitudes in the northern hemisphere.

The Malvinas Current cools the coastal areas, particularly during winter when the current is more stronger. Thus, coastal areas of the Pampas have cooler summers and a longer frost period owing to the cold Malvinas Current.

40|$|M. Sc. The main aim of {{this study}} was to analyse ships' drift data for the South West Indian and South East Atlantic Oceans in order to find out more about the general {{characteristics}} and seasonal flow patterns of the surface ocean currents in these regions. A ship's drift observation consists of the difference between a course steered between two positions (estimated arrival time is based on the speed of the ship through the water) and the course made good during the same period (figure 1. 1). The speed of the drift can be computed by dividing the vector difference by the time elapsed. Since the most important contributors to the drift of a ship are the surface ocean currents, ship's drift data can be analysed in order to provide information about the speeds and directions of flow of the surface ocean currents in a particular area. Data, showing the mean prevailing winds, were also obtained from oceanic climatic atlases in order to investigate the relationship between the winds and the surface ocean currents. The ships' drift data as well as the wind data were used to investigate the following characteristics of the ocean currents in the study area: Geographic location including their spatial and temporal variability Speeds and directions of flow including their spatial and temporal variability The relationship between the currents and the mean prevailing winds and The eddy kinetic energy (a measure of variability around the mean flow) associated with the currents. Additional features investigated included: The discontinuity of the Mozambique Current The source currents of the Agulhas Current, and The possible existence of an offshore branch of the Agulhas Current, known as the Mozambique Ridge Current. The geographical locations, as well as the speeds and directions of flow of the main surface ocean currents in the study area were successfully determined, with the exceptions of the Angola, South Atlantic, Agulhas Return, South Indian Ocean and <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Circumpolar</b> <b>Currents.</b> These exceptions can be traced to the lack of data in the regions in which these currents occur. A large seasonal difference in the speeds of flow of the South Equatorial (in the Indian Ocean), the East Madagascar and the northern Mozambique Currents was found. The southern Mozambique, the Agulhas and Benguela Current as well as the currents inshore of the Agulhas Current over the Agulhas Bank were shown to exhibit small seasonal differences in their speeds of flow. Owing to a lack of data, very little could be determined regarding the seasonal variability of the Angola, South Atlantic, Agulhas Return, South Indian Ocean and <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Circumpolar</b> <b>Currents.</b> A seasonal variability pertaining to the geographical location of the extreme northern Mozambique Current was determined, but no seasonal variability was found in relation to the geographical location of any of the other currents in the study area. In the northern parts of the South West Indian Ocean a strong relationship was found between the mean prevailing winds and the surface currents. The main driving force for the currents in this region would seem to be the winds. However, as these currents flow southwards and become stronger, as is the case for the Agulhas Current, the relationship between the winds and the currents appears to be somewhat weaker. This may be owing to the fact that the main driving force for these currents is not the winds but the inflow of water from the north. In regions where the currents are weak, such as the Benguela Current region and the Agulhas Bank area, the relationship between the winds and currents was also shown to be strong. The eddy kinetic energy gives a measure of the variability around the mean flow of a current. Often this variability is manifested by the presence of eddy features. Some regions exhibited high values of eddy kinetic energy. These areas included: Parts of the East-Madagascar Current Parts of the Mozambique Current The Agulhas Current, including the region of the Agulhas Retroflection, and Parts of the South Equatorial Current in the Indian Ocean. Two areas of special interest regarding the eddy kinetic energy are the regions of the Agulhas and Madagascar Currents Retroflections. In these areas values of eddy kinetic energy greater then 750 cm 2 /s 2 occur (figure 4. 34). This appears to reinforce the findings of previous researchers, that have postulated the existence of current retroflections in these areas and have indicated that these areas are regions for the formation of eddy features. Unfortunately the maps and charts generated from ships' drift data do not provide clear representations of the retroflections of the East Madagascar and Agulhas Currents. This is owing to the high degree of spatial and temporal variability of these current retroflections. Thus, despite the difficulty of providing conclusive evidence for the existence of these features from ships' drift data, this investigation into the eddy kinetic energy in this study may give additional evidence for the possible presence of the East Madagascar and Agulhas Current Retroflections. The Mozambique Current was found to be a discontinuous, ill-defined western. The Mozambique Current was found to be a discontinuous, ill-defined western boundary current. Both the Mozambique and the East Madagascar Currents were shown to be source currents for the Agulhas Current, but probably in a weak and intermittent manner. The source water from the East Madagascar Current may be in the form of eddies. The existence of an offshore branch of the Agulhas Current, could not be verified from ships' drift data. This study makes two significant contributions to the descriptive physical oceanography of the South West Indian and South East Atlantic Oceans. These are: A detailed analysis relating to the seasonal variability of the currents. In the case of the Benguela Current; the- investigation into the seasonal variability was more detailed than any previous study. A comprehensive investigation pertaining to the eddy kinetic energy associated with the currents. This was done on a one degree grid scale. The only other study which used ships' drift data to examine the eddy kinetic energy for these regions used a five degree grid scale, which could lead to the smoothing out of high values associated with narrow western boundary currents...|$|R

25|$|There is {{no obvious}} single {{reason for the}} pseudotooth birds' extinction. A {{scenario}} of general ecological change – exacerbated by the beginning ice age and changes in ocean currents due to plate tectonic shifts (e.g. {{the emergence of the}} <b>Antarctic</b> <b>circumpolar</b> <b>current</b> or the closing of the Isthmus of Panama) – is more likely, with the pseudotooth birds as remnants of the world's Paleogene fauna ultimately failing to adapt. In that respect it may be significant that some lineages of cetaceans, like the primitive dolphins of the Kentriodontidae or the shark-toothed whales, flourished contemporary with the Pelagornithidae and became extinct at about the same time. Also, the modern diversity of pinniped and cetacean genera evolved largely around the Mio-Pliocene boundary, suggesting that many ecological niches emerged or became vacant. In addition, whatever caused the Middle Miocene disruption and the Messinian Salinity Crisis did affect the trophic web of Earth's oceans not insignificantly either, and the latter event led to a widespread extinction of seabirds. Together, this combination of factors led to Neogene animals finally replacing the last remnants of the Paleogene fauna in the Pliocene. In that respect, it is conspicuous that the older pseudotooth birds are typically found in the same deposits as plotopterids and penguins, while younger forms were sympatric with auks, albatrosses, penguins and Procellariidae – which, however, underwent an adaptive radiation of considerable extent coincident (and probably caused by) with the final demise of the Paleogene-type trophic web. Although the fossil record is necessarily incomplete, as it seems cormorants and seagulls were very rarely found in association with the Pelagornithidae.|$|E

40|$|The {{location}} of fronts {{has a direct}} influence on both the physical and biological processes in the Southern Ocean. Moreover, the Subtropical Front (STF) is believed {{play a key role}} in the global climate system. Model simulations have shown that a wind induced poleward shift of the STF may strengthen the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation by allowing a stronger salt flux from the Indian to the Atlantic Ocean. This hypothesis has important implications for our future climate, as global warming scenarios predict an intensification and southward shift of the Southern Hemisphere Westerlies. Nonetheless, confirmation of the theory has been limited by a lack of data and also our poor dynamical understanding of fronts. In this thesis we produce a new working dynamical definition of the STF and study the relation of this and other Southern Ocean fronts to the winds and topography. We first explore the relative importance of bottom topography and winds for determining the location and structure of Southern Ocean fronts, using 100 years of a control and climate change simulation on the high resolution coupled climate model HiGEM. Topography has primary control on the number and intensity of fronts at each longitude. However, there is no strong relationship between the position or spacing of jets and underlying topographic gradients because of the effects of upstream and downstream topography. The Southern Hemisphere Westerlies intensify and shift south by 1. 3 ° in the climate change simulation, but there is no comparable meridional displacement of the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Circumpolar</b> <b>Current’s</b> (ACC) path or the fronts within its boundaries, even over flat topography. Instead, the current contracts meridionally and weakens. North of the ACC, the STF shifts south gradually, even over steep topographic ridges. We suggest the STF reacts more strongly to the wind shift because it is strongly surface intensified. In contrast, fronts within the ACC are more barotropic and are therefore more sensitive to the underlying topography. We then use satellite sea surface temperature (SST) data to show that the traditional STF, as defined by water mass properties, is comprised of two distinct dynamical regimes. On the western side of each basin the traditional STF coincides with a deep current that has strong SST gradients and no seasonal cycle. We define this as the Dynamical STF (DSTF). Further east, the DSTF diverges from the traditional STF and tracks south-eastwards into the centre of each basin to merge with the Sub-Antarctic Front. The traditional STF continues to the eastern side of the basins where it coincides with the so-called Subtropical Frontal Zone, a zone of shallow SST fronts that have little transport and large seasonal cycles. Finally, we compare the position of our DSTF and previous STF climatologies to the mean wind stress curl field, from satellite scatterometry winds. We find that contrary to previous suggestions, the position of the STF does not coincide with the zero or maximum wind stress curl. Using output from the HiGEM model we show that instead of being controlled purely by the wind field, transport south of the subtropical gyre, including the latitude of the zero wind stress curl, is forced strongly by the bottom pressure torque that is a product of the interaction of the ACC with the ocean floor topography. Here in these studies we have provided a new simple and reproducible method for identifying fronts. We have also given new insights into the seasonal and decadal variability of fronts, as well as how fronts may respond to future climate change. This has highlighted previous misconceptions regarding the relationship between the position of fronts and winds. Finally we have provided a new framework to study the behaviour of the STF and interpret observations, paving the way for better predictions on the likelihood and impact of future STF changes...|$|R
