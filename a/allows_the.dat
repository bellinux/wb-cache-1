5|$|A diving stage, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the basket, or diver launch and recovery system (LARS), is a platform on which one or two divers stand which is hoisted into the water, lowered to the workplace or the bottom, and then hoisted up again to return the diver {{to the surface and}} lift him out of the water. This equipment is almost exclusively used by surface supplied professional divers, as it requires fairly complex lifting equipment. A diving stage <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> surface team to conveniently manage a diver's decompression as it can be hoisted at a controlled rate and stopped at the correct depth for decompression stops, and <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> divers to rest during the ascent. It also <b>allows</b> <b>the</b> divers to be relatively safely and conveniently lifted {{out of the water and}} returned to the deck or quayside.|$|E

Experience points are {{used to determine the}} Kid's ability level; higher values give the player more health and increase the number of upgrades they can select.|$|E
