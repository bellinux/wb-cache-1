5|$|The {{difficulty}} of using NVC {{as well as}} the dangers of misuse are common concerns. In addition, Bitschnau and Flack find <b>a</b> <b>paradoxical</b> potential for violence in the use of NVC, occasioned by its unskilled use. Bitschnau further suggests that the use of NVC is unlikely to allow everyone to express their feelings and have their needs met in real life as this would require inordinate time, patience and discipline. Those who are skilled in the use of NVC may become prejudiced against those who are not and prefer to converse only among themselves.|$|E

5000|$|Paradoxical effects: In some cases, {{paradoxical}} {{effects can}} occur with benzodiazepines, such as increased hostility, aggression, angry outbursts, and psychomotor agitation. These effects are seen more commonly with lorazepam than with other benzodiazepines. Paradoxical effects {{are more likely}} to occur with higher doses, in patients with pre-existing personality disorders and those with a psychiatric illness. Frustrating stimuli may trigger such reactions, though the drug may have been prescribed to help the patient cope with such stress and frustration in the first place. <b>As</b> <b>paradoxical</b> effects appear to be dose-related, they usually subside on dose reduction or on complete withdrawal of lorazepam.|$|R

Another text, Insights: wisdom and requisite variety, gives a list of several sources of wisdom which, in interrelation, may be required in a value system to ensure the long-term viability of a complex society.|$|E

It also may reduce the seizure threshold and hence a corresponding titration of anticonvulsant treatments should be considered. Prochlorperazine and desferrioxamine may also interact with chlorpromazine to produce transient metabolic encephalopathy.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} steps taken to further the intimacy between medicine and art was taken by Santiago Ramón y Cajal, who was subsequently regarded as the father of modern neuroscience.

However, they were eventually proven wrong, and today Cajal’s sketches are known for their brilliant clarity and accuracy.

Wenzlaff and Bates also note that the beneficiality of concentration in their study participants was better optimized when the subjects employed positive thoughts.|$|E

Socrates says that he who sees with his eyes is blind, and this idea is most famously captured in his Allegory of the Cave, and more explicitly in his description of the divided line. The Allegory of the Cave (begins Republic 7.514a) is <b>a</b> <b>paradoxical</b> analogy wherein Socrates argues that the invisible world is the most intelligible ("noeton") and that the visible world ("(h)oraton") is the least knowable, and the most obscure.|$|E
25|$|In Step 3, {{the sphere}} was {{partitioned}} into orbits {{of our group}} H. To streamline the proof, the discussion of points that are fixed by some rotation was omitted; since the paradoxical decomposition of F2 relies on shifting certain subsets, {{the fact that some}} points are fixed might cause some trouble. Since any rotation of S2 (other than the null rotation) has exactly two fixed points, and since H, which is isomorphic to F2, is countable, there are countably many points of S2 that are fixed by some rotation in H, denote this set of fixed points D. Step 3 proves that S2 − D admits <b>a</b> <b>paradoxical</b> decomposition.|$|E

25|$|In <b>a</b> <b>paradoxical</b> turn of events, the United States {{government}} recognized cantors as {{the first}} Jewish clergy, even before rabbis were recognized: as a congregation could be organized and led by a committee of Jewish laypersons, who {{would not have the}} expertise in liturgy a hazzan would have, newly forming congregations in the late 19th and early 20th centuries sometimes hired a hazzan for a synagogue (and made sure that a kosher butcher was established in the neighborhood) for some time before setting about hiring a rabbi, seeing the hazzan (and the butcher) as a more immediate need. The hazzan therefore solemnized marriages and otherwise represented the congregation in the eyes of civil authorities.|$|E
25|$|For step 4, it {{has already}} been shown that the ball minus a point admits <b>a</b> <b>paradoxical</b> decomposition; it remains to be shown that the ball minus a point is equidecomposable with the ball. Consider a circle within the ball, {{containing}} the point {{at the center of the}} ball. Using an argument like that used to prove the Claim, one can see that the full circle is equidecomposable with the circle minus the point at the ball's center. (Basically, a countable set of points on the circle can be rotated to give itself plus one more point.) Note that this involves the rotation about a point other than the origin, so the Banach–Tarski paradox involves isometries of Euclidean 3-space rather than just SO(3).|$|E
