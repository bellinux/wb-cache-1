5|$|According to BAE Systems, the Nimrod MRA4 systems was {{to enable}} the crews to gather, process and display up to 20 times more {{technical}} and strategic data than the MR2. The Searchwater 2000 radar was stated to have been capable over land as well as water; {{with the ability to}} have swept <b>an</b> <b>area</b> <b>the</b> size of the UK every 10 seconds. The Aircraft Synthetic Training Aids (ASTA) provided by Thales Training & Simulation was an electronic training suite to allow the training of crew members to transfer from active MRA4 aircraft to ground-based training systems; this change was made to increase the availability of the aircraft for operational missions and allow for more intensive training exercises.|$|E
5|$|<b>An</b> <b>area</b> <b>the</b> Reform Act did {{not address}} was the issue of {{municipal}} and regional government. As a result of archaic traditions, many English counties had enclaves and exclaves, which were mostly abolished in the Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844. Furthermore, many new conurbations and economic areas bridged traditional county boundaries by having been formed in previously obscure areas: the West Midlands conurbation bridged Staffordshire, Warwickshire and Worcestershire, Manchester and Liverpool both had hinterlands in Cheshire but city centres in Lancashire, while in the south Oxford's developing southern suburbs were in Berkshire and London was expanding into Essex, Surrey and Middlesex. This led to further acts to reorganise county boundaries {{in the late nineteenth}} and twentieth centuries.|$|E
5|$|The Fleet Air Arm units {{selected}} for Operation Tungsten conducted intensive training from February 1944. A {{high proportion of}} the airmen were inexperienced, and the captain of Victorious estimated that 85 per cent of the aircrew embarked on his ship had not previously operated at sea. The training program was centred on Loch Eriboll in northern Scotland which, like Kaafjord, was surrounded by steep hills. Flying from RNAS Hatston in the Orkney Islands, the aircrew practised manoeuvring around this terrain to familiarise themselves with the tactics needed to avoid German anti-aircraft guns and successfully attack Tirpitz. The Royal Navy drew on intelligence on the defences of Kaafjord to make the exercise range as similar to the conditions around Tirpitz as was possible, and the aircrew were extensively briefed on the locations of German positions. <b>An</b> <b>area</b> <b>the</b> size of the battleship was also marked out on {{an island in the}} centre of the loch and repeatedly bombed.|$|E
