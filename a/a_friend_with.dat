5|$|A left-arm medium-pacer, Toshack {{made his}} {{first-class}} cricket {{debut in the}} 1945–46 upon the resumption of cricket after World War II. His performances were enough to ensure his selection for the tour of New Zealand in early-1946, where Toshack made his Test debut in the one-off match against the hosts' national team. From then on, Toshack was a regular {{member of the national}} team and played in every Test over the next two summers, fitness permitting. Toshack played in eight of the 11 Tests during this period, taking 36 wickets. Towards the end of the Test series against India in 1947–48 in Australia, knee injuries began to hamper Toshack, and he was in doubt for the 1948 tour of England. He only made the trip after a 3–2 majority vote by a medical panel, despite being one of the first players chosen by the selectors on cricketing merit. Two Melbourne doctors ruled him unfit, but three specialists from his home state of New South Wales presented a more optimistic outlook; this allowed him to tour. As a member of Bradman's Invincibles, the tour was to immortalise him in cricketing history. He grew tired of signing autographs during the sea voyage to England, and entrusted <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>with</b> the task. However, his friend was unaware of the correct spelling of his name; as a result, there are still sheets in circulation signed Toshak. The team manager Keith Johnson gave Toshack a talking to over this incident.|$|E

Tancredi and the Count react with disgust, saying there was no way they could stay with such a rough outfit when positions with the new king's army were available. Tancredi then produces the ring he has purchased for Angelica. A moment later, Angelica rushes in, having been informed by a note that Tancredi is back.

As well as excavating he undertook a major reorganisation of the on-site Stratigraphical Museum, a task in which Seiradaki would take a large part. She was accepted as {{a student of the}} British School at Athens {{at the same time as}} Edith Eccles who became <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>with</b> whom she worked and travelled.

There were several young women archaeologists from the UK and all were determined not to be put off by difficult terrain and challenging routes, and yet Seiradaki stood out for her reluctance even to ride a mule instead of walking.|$|E

This aphorism, beginning [...] "Scan not <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>with</b> a microscopic glass", had resonated with Harrison since he bought Friar Park in 1970, and it was a quote he often used when discussing his difficult relationship with his former Beatles bandmate Paul McCartney.|$|E

500|$|George Harrison {{purchased}} the 33-acre Friar Park estate, in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, in January 1970, and soon afterwards composed [...] "Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp (Let It Roll)" [...] {{as a tribute}} to the property's original owner, an eccentric Victorian lawyer and horticulturalist named Frank Crisp. Harrison included the song on his All Things Must Pass triple album, released in November 1970, by which time he had begun incorporating into his new compositions some of the homilies and aphorisms that Crisp had inscribed around the property, 70 or more years before. A four-line verse beginning [...] "Scan not <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>with</b> a microscopic glass" [...] particularly resonated with Harrison, who eventually used it in his 1975 song [...] "The Answer's at the End". It similarly took Harrison several years to turn two inspirational lines of verse from carvings in the house's drawing room into song lyrics. These lines provided the repeated verse in [...] "Ding Dong, Ding Dong": [...] "Ring out the old, ring in the new" [...] – which he took from the carving {{to the left of the}} fireplace – and [...] "Ring out the false, ring in the true" [...] – from the one to the right. In his 1980 autobiography, I, Me, Mine, Harrison credits English poet Lord Tennyson as the original source for these lines.|$|E
500|$|From {{midway through}} the twentieth century until 1969, {{ownership}} of Friar Park resided with the Roman Catholic Church. As a result, paint masked some of Crisp's inscriptions inside the house, but outside, signs reading [...] "Don't keep off the grass", [...] "Herons will be prosecuted" [...] and [...] "Eton boys are a Harrowing sight" [...] remained intact. Harrison also discovered inscriptions with a more profound meaning, which he described to his Hare Krishna friend Shyamasundar Das as [...] "like songs really, about the devil, about friendship, life". One example was [...] "Shadows we are and shadows we depart", written on a stone sundial; another began: [...] "Scan not <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>with</b> a microscopic glass / You know his faults, now let his foibles pass..." [...] This four-line verse was written above an entrance-way in a garden wall, {{and it was an}} aphorism that Harrison soon took to quoting in interviews. On 28 April 1970, just over two weeks after the Beatles' break-up, he used the words during an interview for New York's WPLQ Radio, as Village Voice reporter Howard Smith repeatedly pushed for details on the animosity between Paul McCartney and the other three Beatles. In October 1974 – towards the end of what Harrison termed a [...] "bad domestic year", following his split with Boyd – he used the same quote in an interview with BBC Radio's Alan Freeman, when again discussing the current relationship among the four ex-Beatles.|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} the Indian series, knee {{injuries}} {{had begun}} to hamper Toshack, and he only made the trip to England for the 1948 tour on a 3–2 majority vote by a medical team, despite being one of the first selected by the board.

He grew tired of signing autographs during the voyage, and entrusted <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>with</b> the task. As a result, there are still sheets circulating with his name mis-spelt as Toshak. Between the new-ball attacks of Lindwall, Keith Miller and Johnston every 55 overs, Toshack played the role of stifling England's scoring. In one match against Sussex, his 17 overs yielded only three scoring shots. He finished the match bowling 32 overs while conceding 29runs. At Bramall Lane, Sheffield, he recorded the best innings analysis of his first-class career, taking 7/81 from 40 consecutive overs, bemusing the Yorkshire spectators with the his accent and distinctive [...] "Ow Wizz Ee" [...] appealing. Bradman considered his 6/51 against the Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's as the best performance of all. He removed the leading English batsmen Len Hutton and Denis Compton, as well as Martin Donnelly and Ken Cranston. In particular, Toshack was involved in an extended battle with Compton before dismissing him; Bradman said that their duel was [...] "worth going a long way to see". This performance helped Australia to take an innings victory over a team that was virtually a full-strength England outfit and allowed Australia to take a psychological victory in a dress rehearsal ahead of the Tests.|$|E

500|$|Newspapers also reported, in July 1829, {{that the}} Duke {{had been thrown}} out of Lord Lyndhurst's house for assaulting his wife Sarah, Lady Lyndhurst. In early 1830, a number of {{newspapers}} printed articles hinting that Ernest {{was having an affair}} with Lady Graves, a mother of fifteen now past fifty. In February 1830, Lord Graves wrote a note to his wife expressing his confidence in her innocence, then cut his own throat. Two days after Lord Graves's death (and the day after the inquest), The Times printed an article connecting Lord Graves's death with Sellis's. After being shown the suicide note, The Times withdrew its implication there might be a connection between the two deaths. Nonetheless, many believed the Duke responsible for the suicide—or guilty of a second murder. The Duke later stated that he had been [...] "accused of every crime in the decalogue". Ernest's biographer, Anthony Bird, states that while there is no proof, he has no doubt that the rumours against the Duke were spread by the Whigs for political ends. Another biographer, Geoffrey Willis, pointed out that no scandal had attached itself to the Duke during the period of over a decade when he resided in Germany; it was only when he announced his intent to return to Britain that [...] "a campaign of unparalleled viciousness" [...] began against him. The Duke of Wellington once told Charles Greville that George IV had said of Ernest's unpopularity, [...] "there was never a father well with his son, or husband with his wife, or lover with his mistress, or <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>with</b> his friend, that he did not try to make mischief between them." [...] According to Bird, Ernest was the most unpopular man in England.|$|E
