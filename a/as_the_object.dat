25|$|A {{plane mirror}} forms a virtual image {{positioned}} behind the mirror. Although {{the rays of}} light seem to come from behind the mirror, light from the source only exists {{in front of the}} mirror. The image in a plane mirror is not magnified (that is, the image is the same size <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>object)</b> and appears to be as far behind the mirror <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>object</b> is in front of the mirror.|$|E

25|$|Sir Richard Blackmore (22 January 1654 – 9 October 1729), English {{poet and}} physician, is remembered {{primarily}} <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>object</b> of satire and dull poet, {{but he was}} also a respected medical doctor and theologian.|$|E
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>object</b> {{is pulled}} toward the massive body, it falls toward that body. However, {{if it has}} enough {{tangential}} velocity it will not fall into the body but will instead continue to follow the curved trajectory caused by that body indefinitely.

25|$|A {{strain gauge}} is a device {{used to measure}} the strain of an object. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>object</b> is deformed, the foil is deformed, causing its {{electrical}} resistance to change. The strain gauge was invented in 1936 by Edward E. Simmons, a professor at the California Institute of Technology, and re-invented in 1938 by Arthur C. Ruge, an earthquake specialist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.|$|E

50|$|Interceptions {{during the}} {{terminal}} phase {{are among the}} simplest, both technically {{and in terms of}} tracking. Once <b>the</b> <b>objects</b> in <b>the</b> cloud begin to enter the lower atmosphere, the lighter decoys and chaff begin to slow down more rapidly than the much denser warheads. Examining the deceleration of the cloud will reveal <b>the</b> warheads <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>objects</b> with <b>the</b> least deceleration. This atmospheric decluttering becomes more pronounced <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>objects</b> continue to fall, which makes it advantageous to wait until the last possible moment before attacking. This was the premise behind the Nike-X system, where interceptions took place only a few seconds before the warheads would explode.|$|R

25|$|The Beuren chapel was consecrated to Saint Anthony, thus {{meaning that}} it {{would go back to}} the 12th century at the earliest. In the chapel in pre-Reformation times was a picture of the saint, which is {{likewise}} witnessed <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>object</b> of pilgrimages. Of the chapel, only the tower still stands today, for the nave was torn down about 1950, supposedly because it was falling into disrepair.|$|E
25|$|Within {{the context}} of Cubism, artists were forced into the {{position}} of re-evaluating {{the role of the}} observer. Classical linear and aerial perspective, uninterrupted surface transitions and chiaroscuro were pushed aside. What remained was a series of images obtained by the observer (the artist) in different frames of reference <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>object</b> was being painted. Essentially, observations became linked through a system of coordinate transformations. The result was Metzinger's 'total image' or a combination of successive images.|$|E
25|$|For flat mirrors, {{the law of}} {{reflection}} implies that images of objects are upright and the same distance behind the mirror as the objects are {{in front of the}} mirror. The image size is the same <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>object</b> size. The law also implies that mirror images are parity inverted, which we perceive as a left-right inversion. Images formed from reflection in two (or any even number of) mirrors are not parity inverted. Corner reflectors retroreflect light, producing reflected rays that travel back in the direction from which the incident rays came.|$|E
5000|$|The {{relative}} acceleration Aμ of <b>the</b> two <b>objects</b> is defined, roughly, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> second {{derivative of}} the separation vector Xμ <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>objects</b> advance along their respective geodesics.

30|$|As {{observed}} in Figure  11, the image contrast produced by HE is over-saturated <b>as</b> <b>the</b> image becomes too bright and reddish. ICM and UCM do not significantly improve <b>the</b> images contrast <b>as</b> {{there is more}} blue-green illumination in the output images. Moreover, the coral in the background is also over-saturated. PDSCC reduces the blue-green illumination in the output image but the overall contrast does not improve <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>objects</b> are hardly differentiated from the background. The proposed method improves <b>the</b> contrast better <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>objects</b> in <b>the</b> image are better differentiated from the background. In addition, the blue-green illumination is reduced more {{compared to the other}} methods.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} where an object has its own local {{coordinate}} system, it can be useful to store a bounding box relative to these axes, which requires no transformation <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>object's</b> own transformation changes.|$|R
25|$|Araki allows two verb {{roots to}} appear in one single verb phrase, thus forming a sort of complex verb {V1, V2}; usually {{no more than two}} verbs can appear at a time. This series of two verbs share one mood-subject clitic and the same aspect markers. This does not imply that they semantically have the same subject. No object or other {{complement}} can insert between these two verbs. The transitivity suffix -i, as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>object</b> suffix, appear on the right of the second verb, provided this is authorized by the morphology of V2 and by the syntactic context.|$|E
25|$|With {{diverging}} lenses, incoming parallel rays diverge {{after going}} through the lens, {{in such a way}} that they seem to have originated at a spot one focal length in front of the lens. This is the lens's front focal point. Rays from an object at finite distance are associated with a virtual image that is closer to the lens than the focal point, and on the same side of the lens <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>object.</b> The closer the object is to the lens, the closer the virtual image is to the lens. As with mirrors, upright images produced by a single lens are virtual, while inverted images are real.|$|E
25|$|Early proposals, in 1835 and 1836, for {{the railway}} favoured a route broadly {{following}} the Old Road through Launceston and Okehampton, {{and on to}} Basingstoke or Reading. This huge undertaking failed for lack of funds, but it established the presumption that the part of this route west of Exeter, the Central Route, was the natural choice, and that the coastal route was not. The Central Route had the principal advantage of providing the shortest route to London, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>object</b> was to secure the packet traffic. The intermediate terrain was largely unpopulated; the route traversed high altitudes, but the topography was easier than a route following the south coast because of the multiple valleys and river inlets near the coast.|$|E
50|$|Most known {{objects that}} are in orbital {{resonance}} are orbiting in <b>the</b> same direction <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>objects</b> they are in resonance with, however a few retrograde asteroids {{have been found in}} resonance with Jupiter and Saturn.|$|R
50|$|This {{allows people}} to make out moving objects even when other details (such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>objects</b> color or outline) are obscured. This ability likely arose from the {{evolutionary}} need to distinguish a camouflaged predator from its background.|$|R
5000|$|The above {{can then}} {{be turned into a}} {{category}} by taking <b>the</b> types <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>objects.</b> <b>The</b> morphisms [...] are equivalence classes of pairs [...] where x is a variable (of type [...] ) and t is a term (of type [...] ), having no free variables in it, except for (optionally) x. Closure is obtained from currying and application, as usual.|$|R
25|$|Since Everett's {{original}} work, {{there have}} appeared {{a number of}} similar formalisms in the literature. One such is the relative state formulation. It makes two assumptions: first, the wavefunction {{is not simply a}} description of the object's state, but that it actually is entirely equivalent to the object, a claim it has in common with some other interpretations. Secondly, observation or measurement has no special laws or mechanics, unlike in the Copenhagen interpretation which considers the wavefunction collapse as a special kind of event which occurs as a result of observation. Instead, measurement in the relative state formulation is the consequence of a configuration change in the memory of an observer described by the same basic wave physics <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>object</b> being modeled.|$|E
25|$|During a {{free-fall}} with no aerodynamic forces, {{the object}} accelerates due to gravity, resulting in increasing velocity <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>object</b> descends. During parachuting, animals use the aerodynamic forces on their body {{to counteract the}} force or gravity. Any object moving through air experiences a drag force that is proportion to surface area and to velocity squared, and this force will partially counter the force of gravity, slowing the animal's descent to a safer speed. If this drag is oriented {{at an angle to}} the vertical, the animal's trajectory will gradually become more horizontal, and it will cover horizontal as well as vertical distance. Smaller adjustments can allow turning or other maneuvers. This can allow a parachuting animal to move from a high location on one tree to a lower location on another tree nearby.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to his preoccupation for the simplification of geometric structure, Cézanne was concerned with the means of rendering the effect of volume and space. His rather classical color-modulating system consisted of changing colors from warm to cool <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>object</b> {{turns away from the}} source of light. Cézanne's departure from classicism, however, would be best summarized in the treatment and of application of the paint itself; a process in which his brushstrokes played an important role. The complexity of surface variations (or modulations) with overlapped shifting planes, seemingly arbitrary contours, contrasts and values combined to produce a strong patchwork effect. Increasingly in his later works, as Cézanne achieves a greater freedom, the patchwork becomes larger, bolder, more arbitrary, more dynamic and increasingly abstract. As the color planes acquire greater formal independence, defined objects and structures begin to lose their identity.|$|E
