25|$|In the United States, {{creating}} an improvised firearm {{for personal use}} does not require licensure, registration, <b>a</b> <b>background</b> <b>check,</b> or the stamping of a serial number, but must be detectable by a metal detector per federal law. Though California passed a law in 2016 that requires anyone planning to build a homemade gun to obtain a serial number from the state (de facto registration) and pass <b>a</b> <b>background</b> <b>check.</b> However, such firearms are often illegal in other jurisdictions and are commonly associated with gangs, where they {{may be used to}} facilitate violent crime, such as homicide.

25|$|The Sitaras Method {{consists}} in an initial comprehensive evaluation system (which can take between 6-12 sessions) for assessing flexibility, cardio-respiratory fitness, strength, endurance, and body fat. Sitaras {{takes into account}} the unique musculature of the person, isolating differences between right and left sides of the body, different parts of each muscle, and the two major muscle fiber types (those for strength, and those for endurance), in order to design a workout tailored to each student's genetic aptitude, level of fitness, health conditions, and goals. An important goal is to develop muscular balance, which is the foundation for more specific goals such as aesthetics, strength and flexibility gains, or developing a more powerful athletic ability. The students must commit to working out at least twice a week, and are subject to <b>a</b> <b>background</b> <b>check.</b> They resume the muscle evaluation every three months with a variety of tools including digital scales, body fat and flexibility readers, and proprietary fitness software that helps track the clients strength gains over time.
