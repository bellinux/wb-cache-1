50|$|The {{aircraft}} was inspected by a maintenance crew {{on the evening}} before the flight. While the aircraft passed inspection, it was {{found out that the}} aircraft's <b>antiskid</b> <b>system</b> on the right hand landing gear was inoperative. This had previously been an issue--a problem with the system was detected on 27 September 2002 and it had been replaced. However, on 24 October 2002, the same <b>antiskid</b> <b>system</b> was inoperative again. Despite changing the outboard wheel speed sensor, the system remained inoperative. On 5 November 2002, one day before the accident, the problem was solved by replacing the inboard wheel speed sensor.|$|E
5000|$|... 2000: New wheels {{featured}} a fancier six-spoke design. New to the option list for 2000 was an <b>antiskid</b> <b>system</b> called the Precision Control System. Precision Control System {{was designed to}} help keep the car on its intended path by selective braking of one or more individual wheels. Though optional on all models, GX buyers had to order optional traction control to get the new <b>antiskid</b> <b>system.</b> Heated power front seats were now standard on GLS models. Standard leather door inserts trim not cloth, Retained accessory power was standard this year. [...] "Oldsmobile" [...] emblem on deck lid is larger than on 1999 models, although some early 2000 models carried the smaller version. A new gold-trim package was also available. New automatic headlights were now standard on all models.|$|E
5000|$|When {{launching}} the M24 Volga, GAZ envisioned an average, for the USSR, production run of a decade. The newer designs were produced by smaller numbers due to development of other {{projects in the}} Soviet automotive industry, in particular the coming about of the VAZ plant and a much bigger Moskvitch, the project 3-5, to replace the 408 and 412 series. The latter's being more economic would have proved a natural relieve the Volga of its traditional taxi role, leaving GAZ's new vehicle as a more exclusive personal luxury car for the mid-range Soviet nomenklatura. With this in mind, the vehicle's mock-up demonstrated in 1976was to grow in size, have the V6 powerplant as standard, and a perspective 4.2 litre V8 optional with many other features of the contemporary foreign cars of the 1970s. In 1976-7, the new GAZ-3101 appeared in prototype form, but it {{was little more than}} [...] "a cosmetic tart-up of the mainstream Volga", with new front door windows, door handles, and lights; it also got longer front overhang and longer trunk. This would be renamed the 3102 in time. A few were built with a [...] V8 as the 31011, but this never entered serial production, nor did the continuing GAZ-desired V6 model. (Among its standard features were a fire extinguisher.) It was powered by a twelve-valve version (ZMZ 402.10) of the venerable [...] inline four with electronic ignition, producing , enough for 94 mph. Disk brakes were fitted in front, while the rear drums were equipped with a crude <b>antiskid</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

These programs include {{experimental studies of}} four <b>antiskid</b> <b>systems</b> on the Langley Landing Loads Track, flights tests with a DC- 9 airplane, and computer simulation studies. Results from these research efforts include identification of factors contributing to degraded antiskid performance under adverse weather conditions, tire tread temperature measurements during antiskid braking on dry runway surfaces, and {{an assessment of the}} accuracy of various brake pressure-torque computer models. This information should lead to the development of better <b>antiskid</b> <b>systems</b> in the future...|$|R
40|$|A {{research}} project to investigate <b>antiskid</b> braking <b>systems</b> {{for the space}} shuttle vehicle was conducted. System from the Concorde, Boeing 747, Boeing 737, and Lockheed L- 1011 were investigated. The characteristics of the Boeing 737 system which caused it to be selected are described. Other subjects which were investigated are: (1) trade studies of brake control concepts, (2) redundancy requirements trade study, (3) laboratory evaluation of <b>antiskid</b> <b>systems,</b> and (4) space shuttle hardware criteria...|$|R
40|$|To brake in minimum distance, {{the tire}} slip must be {{controlled}} {{to ride the}} peak of the mu-slip curve so that maximum ground force is developed between tire and pavement. The resulting control <b>system</b> differs from <b>antiskid</b> <b>systems</b> which react to impending wheel lockup. A simplified model is presented to permit development of a sound control strategy. Liapunov techniques are used to derive a peak riding adaptive controller applicable to each wheel of a breaking vehicle. The controller is applied to a more sophisticated model of a braking airplane with strut bending dynamics included. Simulation results verify the peak riding property of the controller and the rapid adaption of the controller to extreme runway conditions. The effect of actuator dynamics, perturbation frequency, type and location of sensors, absence of a free wheel, and a method in which the pilot's braking commands can be interfaced with the peak riding system are also considered...|$|R
40|$|During maximum braking {{the average}} ratio of drag-force {{friction}} coefficient {{developed by the}} <b>antiskid</b> <b>system</b> to maximum drag-force friction coefficient available at the tire/runway interface was higher on dry surfaces than on wet surfaces. The gross stopping power generated by the brake system on the dry surface was {{more than twice that}} obtained on the wet surfaces. With maximum braking applied, the average ratio of side-force friction coefficient developed by the tire under antiskid control to maximum side-force friction available at the tire/runway interface of a free-rolling yawed tire was shown to decrease with increasing yaw angle. Braking reduced the side-force friction coefficient on a dry surface by 75 percent as the wheel slip ratio was increased to 0. 3; on a flooded surface the coefficient dropped to near zero for the same slip ratio. Locked wheel skids were observed when the tire encountered a runway surface transition from dry to flooded, {{due in part to the}} response time required for the system to sense abrupt changes in the runway friction; however, the <b>antiskid</b> <b>system</b> quickly responded by reducing brake pressure and cycling normally during the remainder of the run on the flooded surface...|$|E
40|$|The {{results from}} {{recent studies of}} some factors {{affecting}} tire braking and cornering performance are presented together {{with a discussion of}} the possible application of these results to the design of aircraft braking systems. The first part of the paper is concerned with steady-state braking, that is, results from tests conducted at a constant slip ratio or steering angle or both. The second part deals with cyclic braking tests, both single cycle, where brakes are applied at a constant rate until wheel lockup is achieved, and rapid cycling of the brakes under control of a currently operational <b>antiskid</b> <b>system...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{behavior}} of various antiskid systems was investigated under controlled conditions. Results from utilizing a single main {{wheel of a}} DC- 9 aircraft suggest that the systems investigated perform well under most circumstances {{but there may be}} room for improvement. For example, it was demonstrated that pressure bias modulation can adversely affect the response of antiskid systems to rapid changes in the runway friction level. Results also indicate that antiskid systems designed to operate at a slip ratio of approximately 0. 1 can provide a maximum braking effort without undue loss in the cornering capability of the tire. Time histories of braking friction coefficient were shown to provide a means of determining <b>antiskid</b> <b>system</b> performance and for systems that employed pressure bias modulation it was shown that performance could also be estimated from time histories of brake pressure and torque...|$|E

A runway arresting hook was fitted under the tail behind the engine exhausts.|$|R

40|$|A {{computer}} {{study was}} performed to assess the accuracy of three brake pressure-torque mathematical models. The investigation utilized one main gear wheel, brake, and tire assembly of a McDonnell Douglas DC- 9 series 10 airplane. The investigation indicates that the performance of aircraft <b>antiskid</b> braking <b>systems</b> is strongly influenced by tire characteristics, dynamic response of the antiskid control valve, and pressure-torque response of the brake. The computer study employed an average torque error criterion to assess {{the accuracy of the}} models. The results indicate that a variable nonlinear spring with hysteresis memory function models the pressure-torque response of the brake more accurately than currently used models...|$|R
40|$|Antilock {{braking systems}} (ABS) have been {{introduced}} on all passenger cars in recent years. This electronic control system prevents wheels from locking-up and so improves braking performance while ensuring the steerability of the car. Modeling the ABS is essential in order to simulate the vehicle behavior during braking and to achieve a good agreement between the vehicle model and the experimental data. An {{hardware in the loop}} test bench has been realized to test an industrial ABS control unit, thus allowing the development of anumerical model of the antilock braking system. Several braking simulations have been carried out to make acomparison between the implemented ABS model and the real <b>antiskid</b> <b>system</b> tested in the HILS platform. Moreover, a validation of the model has been carried out, comparing the ABS model, integrated within a 14 d. o. f. vehicle model, and the experimental data collected on an instrumented passenger car during various kind of braking maneuvers...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted at the Langley aircraft landing loads and traction facility to study the braking and cornering response of a slip ratio controlled aircraft antiskid braking system with ground speed reference derived from an unbraked nose wheel. The investigation, conducted on dry and wet runway surfaces, utilized one main gear wheel, brake, and tire assembly of a DC- 9 series 10 airplane. During maximum braking, the average ratio of the drag force friction coefficient developed by the <b>antiskid</b> <b>system</b> to the maximum drag force friction coefficient available was higher on the dry surface than on damp and flooded surfaces, and was reduced with lighter vertical loads, higher yaw angles, and when new tire treads were replaced by worn treads. Similarly, the average ratio of side force friction coefficient developed by the tire under antiskid control to the maximum side force friction coefficient available to a freely rolling yawed tire decreased with increasing yaw angle, generally increased with ground speed, and decreased when tires with new treads were replaced by those with worn treads...|$|E
40|$|Active {{antiskid}} {{systems for}} high performance motorbikes {{are difficult to}} implement due to the necessity to combine performance, equilibrium, handling and safety. In order to design and optimize a fuzzy controlled <b>antiskid</b> <b>system</b> for motorbikes a fuzzy model of the pilot was applied to a lumped-mass model of the motorcycle (two different models have been considered). The fuzzy pilot acts on the steering angle to control trajectory, yaw angle, yaw velocity and roll angle. Throttle position vs. time curve, gear and an adherence model between tire and road are given as input. The fuzzy pilot is implemented with Matlab/Simulink, and simply tries to keep equilibrium. Only measurable inputs were given as input variables of the antiskid fuzzy controller. The output is the percent reduction in throttle position. The motorcycle-fuzzy-pilot model proved to be quite accurate. Motorcycle maximum velocity resulted higher than the real one due to the simplifying hypothesis. In curves the fuzzy pilot is less efficient than the real pilot. In fact there was a low frequency oscillation around the optimum steering angle. This fuzzy controlled antiskid proved to work quite well since equilibrium is attained also in critical situations where the motorcycle-fuzzy-pilot model alone fails to keep equilibrium...|$|E

The investigation, conducted on dry and wet runway surfaces, utilized one main gear wheel, brake, and tire assembly of a McDonnell Douglas DC 9 series 10 airplane. The {{landing gear strut}} {{was replaced by a}} dynamometer. The parameters, which were varied, included the carriage speed, tire loading, yaw angle, tire tread condition, brake system operating pressure, and runway wetness conditions. The effects of each of these parameters on the behavior of the skid control system is presented. Comparisons between data obtained with the skid control system and data obtained from single cycle braking tests without antiskid protection are examined...|$|R

The results indicated that under cyclic braking conditions the braking and cornering-force friction coefficients may be influenced by fluctuations in the vertical load, flexibility in the wheel support, and the spring coupling between the wheel and the tire-pavement interface. The cornering capability was shown to be negligible at wheel slip ratios well below a locked-wheel skid under all test surface conditions. The maximum available brake-force friction coefficient was shown to be dependent upon the runway surface condition, upon velocity, and, for wet runways, upon tire differences.

40|$|The {{research}} described herein {{is composed}} of four major areas of practice. It examines the overall performance of runways and provides tools designed to improve current runway operations and management with particular emphasis on contaminated surfaces. Presented in this thesis is an overview of how to design airport pavements {{in order to achieve}} optimal friction by specifically focusing on material selection and construction techniques for rigid and flexible pavements. Rubber buildup and the impact rubber accumulation has on decreasing runway friction, particularly in a range of climatic conditions, is discussed. Four commonly used rubber removal techniques are presented and evaluated. Through this research, an analytical hierarchy process (AHP) decision making protocol was developed for incorporation into airport pavement management systems (APMS). Runway surface condition reporting practices used at the Region of Waterloo International Airport are evaluated and recommendations for improving current practices are identified. Runway surface condition reporting can be improved by removing subjectivity, reporting conditions to pilots in real time, standardizing terminology and measurement techniques, and including runway pictures or sketches to identify contaminant locations where possible. Reports should be incorporated and stored in the APMS. Aircraft braking systems and their effects on landing distances under contaminated conditions are discussed. This thesis presents a proposed solution for monitoring and measuring contaminated runway surfaces and identifying the risks associated with aircraft landing through using the Braking Availability Tester (BAT). Also proposed in this thesis is a testing framework for validating the Braking Availability Tester. The proposed BAT measures interaction between aircraft <b>antiskid</b> braking <b>systems</b> and runway contaminants to determine landing distances more accurately. Finally, this thesis includes a discussion explaining how pavement design, contaminant removal, results from friction tests, and results from the BAT can be incorporated into airport pavement management systems. APMS data can be analyzed to economically optimize and prioritize scheduling of pavement maintenance, preservation and rehabilitation treatments to maintain a high level of service, thereby contributing to runway safety and optimization...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of current antiskid braking systems operating under {{adverse weather conditions}} was analyzed {{in an effort to}} both identify the causes of locked-wheel skids which sometimes occur when the runway is slippery and to find possible solutions to this operational problem. This analysis was made possible by the quantitative test data provided by recently completed landing research programs using fully instrumented flight test airplanes and was further supported by tests performed at the Langley aircraft landing loads and traction facility. The <b>antiskid</b> <b>system</b> logic for brake control and for both touchdown and locked-wheel protection is described and its response behavior in adverse weather is discussed in detail with the aid of available data. The analysis indicates that the operational {{performance of}} the antiskid logic circuits is highly dependent upon wheel spin-up acceleration and can be adversely affected by certain pilot braking inputs when accelerations are low. Normal antiskid performance is assured if the tire-to-runway traction is sufficient to provide high wheel spin-up accelerations or if the system is provided a continuous, accurate ground speed reference. The design of antiskid systems is complicated by the necessity for tradeoffs between tire braking and cornering capabilities, both of which are necessary to provide safe operations in the presence of cross winds, particularly under slippery runway conditions...|$|E
