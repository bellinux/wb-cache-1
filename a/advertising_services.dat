5|$|New York City {{does not}} pay for the system because CityBridge oversees the installation, ownership, and operations, and is {{responsible}} for building the new optic infrastructure under the streets. CityBridge stated in a press release that the network would be free for all users, and that the service would be funded by advertisements. This advertising will provide revenue for New York City {{as well as for}} the partners involved in CityBridge. The advertising is estimated to bring in over $1 billion in profits over twelve years, with the City of New York receiving over $500 million, or about half of that amount. Technically, the LinkNYC network is intended to act as a public internet utility with <b>advertising</b> <b>services.</b>|$|E
5|$|Several {{lawsuits}} {{have been}} filed against Yelp accusing it of extorting businesses into buying advertising products. Each have been dismissed by a judge before reaching trial. In early 2010, a class-action lawsuit was filed against Yelp alleging it asked a Long Beach veterinary hospital to pay $300 a month for <b>advertising</b> <b>services</b> that included the suppression or deletion of disparaging customer reviews. The following month, nine additional businesses joined the class-action lawsuit, and two similar lawsuits were filed. That May the lawsuits were combined into one class-action lawsuit, which was dismissed by San Francisco U.S. District Judge Edward Chen in 2011. Chen said the reviews were protected by the Communications Decency Act of 1996 {{and that there was}} no evidence of manipulation by Yelp. The plaintiffs filed an appeal. In September 2014 the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the dismissal, finding that even if Yelp did manipulate reviews to favor advertisers, this would not fall under the court's legal definition of extortion.|$|E
5|$|The poor demand {{resulted}} in price cuts for various Windows RT products; in April 2013 {{the price of}} Dell's XPS 10 fell from US$450 US to $300, and Microsoft began offering free covers for its Surface tablet in some territories as a limited-time promotionâ€”itself a US$130 value for the Type Cover alone. Microsoft also reportedly reduced the cost of Windows RT licenses for devices with smaller screens, hoping that this could spur interest in the platform. In July 2013, Microsoft cut {{the price of the}} first-generation Surface worldwide by 30%, with its U.S. price falling to $350. Concurrently, Microsoft reported a loss of US$900 million due to the lackluster sales of the device. In August 2013, Dell silently pulled the option to purchase the XPS 10 from its online store without a keyboard dock (raising its price back up to US$479), and pulled the device entirely in September 2013. Microsoft's discount on the Surface tablet did result in a slight increase of market share for the device; in late-August 2013, usage data from the advertising network AdDuplex (which provides <b>advertising</b> <b>services</b> within Windows Store apps) revealed that Surface usage had increased from 6.2 to 9.8%.|$|E

500|$|Although {{state legislators}} {{maintained}} that reforming {{the public school}} system was too large an issue to tackle during the 60-day legislative session of 1990 and requested that Wilkinson call a special legislative session in June 1990 to consider the issue, the governor insisted that the issue be resolved during the regular session and said that he would not allow consideration of tax increases to fund improvements in the system if he had to call a special session. Wilkinson presented a budget proposal to the General Assembly that contained measures increasing taxes on cigarettes and corporations and eliminating sales tax exemptions on legal, engineering, and <b>advertising</b> <b>services.</b> Legislators favored raising the sales tax to six percent instead. For much of the legislative session, Wilkinson remained steadfastly opposed to an increased sales tax, repeatedly calling it a [...] "dead issue" [...] and threatening to veto it. Then on March 9, 1990, Wilkinson announced that he would drop his opposition to the tax in exchange for the Assembly's approval of a $600 million bond issue to finance road improvements he had promised during the campaign. The Lexington Herald-Leader called the move [...] "a stunning reversal" [...] and noted that Wilkinson would not comment on why he changed his mind. With the impasse between the legislature and Wilkinson resolved, House Speaker Don Blandford announced that the remainder of the session would focus only on approving the state budget and passing the court-mandated education reforms; any bills still in committees would not be brought to a vote, he said. On April 11, 1990, the Assembly passed the Kentucky Education Reform Act (KERA) to comply with the Supreme Court's decision. Besides increasing funding for schools, it mandated high performance measures and held schools accountable for meeting them. Educators hailed the legislation as being among the nation's best education reform plans.|$|E
2500|$|Bon Jour was reflagged to Panama and renamed Magda Maria. On 6 December 1961, {{the ship}} {{was caught in a}} severe storm and almost foundered. The next day, she put into Sandhamn for repairs which {{included}} a broken mast stay. Her broadcasting equipment was not confiscated as it was recognised that putting into port was an emergency situation. On 8 March, Bon Jour returned to her anchorage. Radio Nord ceased broadcasting on 30 June 1962. On 4 July 1962, Magda Maria sailed for Ferrol, Spain where she was to undergo a refit, arriving on 2 August. Radio Nord was closed by the Swedish authorities and {{the ship was}} put up for sale. A law had been passed [...] prohibiting Swedes from supplying offshore radio ships with stores, or from providing <b>advertising</b> <b>services</b> to the stations. This law was said to have been brought in to discourage Soviet propaganda ships from being based off the Swedish coast. A similar law was passed simultaneously by Denmark; both came into effect on 1 August 1962. Danish station Radio Mercur closed on July 31; having closed one month earlier, Radio Nord has the distinction of being the first offshore pirate to be closed as a result of government legislation.|$|E
2500|$|After Derry v Peek it {{was thought}} that negligent {{misrepresentation}} was not actionable in tort. However, in Nocton v Lord Ashburton a claim was allowed where parties were in a fiduciary relationship and in Candler v Crane, Christmas and Co Denning LJ delivered a blistering dissent against the bar to recovery for negligent words. His dissent was approved in the leading case, Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller & Partners Ltd, where Heller & Partners Ltd (a bank) warranted to Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd (an advertising company) that its prospective client, Easipower Ltd, was creditworthy. When Easipower Ltd could not in fact pay for the <b>advertising</b> <b>services,</b> Hedley Byrne sued the bank for misrepresentation. This is a tort action, so the question did not actually involve a claim for misrepresentation inducing a contract. But the principle was the same. Could one sue for losses after being told negligent, rather than fraudulent, statements? The House of Lords answered [...] "yes" [...] if there was a special relationship between the parties showing that one had [...] "assumed responsibility" [...] to the other. In the instant case this would have worked, except that Heller & Partners had said in their warrant that they disclaimed any responsibility for their statement's accuracy. They had an exclusion clause (see below, and Misrepresentation Act 1967 s 3). So in absence of the exclusion clause, Heller & Partners would have been liable for negligent misstatement.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} about value {{creation}} in an emerging context of technology intensive professional services. The {{purpose is to}} examine what kind of value advertisers derive from a mobile <b>advertising</b> <b>service</b> that is still being developed.

The five customer perceived value drivers {{that emerged from the}} data are; service quality, service support, service providerâ€™s know-how, interaction and pioneer status. In addition, different types of mobile advertisers were identified according to their depth of involvement in the service production. The paper concludes with theoretical implications to value creation in the context of innovative services, and managerial suggestions both to companies providing mobile <b>advertising</b> <b>service</b> and advertisers learning to use this new advertising media...|$|R
