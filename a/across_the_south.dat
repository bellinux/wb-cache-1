5|$|On August11, a {{tropical}} cyclone appeared east of Luzon. Over {{the next few}} days, it moved across the Philippines, passing near the island of Mindoro on August13.

Although it paralleled the coast, the system dissipated over the Gulf of Tonkin on August17.|$|E

5|$|From 1890 to 1910, poll {{taxes and}} {{literacy}} tests were instituted <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>South,</b> effectively disenfranchising {{the great majority}} of black men. White male-only primary elections also served to reduce the influence of black men in the political system. Along with increasing legal obstacles, blacks were excluded from the political system by threats of violent reprisals by whites in the form of lynch mobs and terrorist attacks by the Ku Klux Klan. Some Democrats even advocated a repeal of the amendment, such as William Bourke Cockran of New York.|$|E
5|$|In 1861, a stone {{addition}} to the original 1774 Georgian structure was built. The large stone blocks used {{for the construction of}} the addition were quarried from the plantation's Mill Creek Mountain, a ridge located <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> Branch Potomac River {{to the west of the}} mansion. The stone blocks were hewed by sawyers, then transported across the river to the mansion, and lifted upon the addition's scaffolding with wheelbarrows. A Mr. Ferrybe supervised and managed the stone addition's construction.|$|E

5|$|On October 26, 1861, Monroe's 114th Regiment {{took part}} in a {{skirmish}} against a unit within the left column formation of Union Army troops under the command of Brigadier General Benjamin Franklin Kelley. The skirmish took place at present-day Blues Beach where a wire bridge carried the Moorefield and North Branch Turnpike <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> Branch Potomac River at the Lower Hanging Rocks. Monroe also led 300 soldiers of the 114th Regiment in the Battle of Blue's Gap on January 7, 1862.|$|E
5|$|Southampton was an {{important}} trading port in the 12th century, with trade routes to Normandy, the Levant and Gascony. The castle played {{an important}} role in this trade, in part forming a warehouse for the king's imports, this process being managed by a Crown Bailiff. Royal purchases of wine were particularly important for the castle, being stored and distributed to royal properties <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>south</b> of England. The former castle hall was turned into a subterranean vault in the 13th century, probably for storing wine.|$|E
5|$|The {{guidelines}} set by Judah Benjamin in 1861 {{soon became}} {{the choice of}} the clothing depots <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> as the war went into its second year. This easier-to-produce jacket, with the loosened hat and trouser regulations, made it easier to clothe Confederate infantrymen. The typical uniform by the end of 1861 and beginning of 1862 was a slouch hat or kepi, a shell-jacket, and a pair of sky-blue or gray cloth trousers, with brogans.|$|E

5|$|A typhoon {{was first}} {{observed}} southwest of Guam on October 1, which progressed steadily westward. On October 4, the storm crossed the Philippines, entering from Borongan in Eastern Samar to Capiz {{and into the}} South China Sea. Heavy damage occurred along the path, and several boats were wrecked in Capiz, resulting in several fatalities. The island of Mindoro lost communications with Manila during the storm. Shifting to the west-northwest, the storm moved ashore eastern Vietnam on October 8 near Danang. Another typhoon followed a similar path, originating near Guam on October4 and progressing westward. Five days later, the storm struck the Philippine province of Camarines Norte, causing damage as it moved westward through Luzon. Moving <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> China Sea, the storm struck {{the east coast of}} what was then Indochina on October11.|$|E

5|$|Allied air {{and naval}} attacks against Japanese {{shipping}} in the South China Sea were expanded during early 1945 as additional USAAF units moved into {{bases in the}} Philippines and other demands on these forces permitted. Land-based patrol aircraft and medium bombers operated over the sea from liberated areas of the Philippines and Dutch East Indies from February. While Allied submarines and these aircraft failed to prevent the escape of the Ise-class battleships when they sailed for Japan during Operation Kita in mid-February, the medium bombers were sinking large numbers of Japanese merchant ships {{by the end of}} the month. Medium and heavy bombers also raided Japanese-held ports <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> China Sea area. As a result of the air and submarine attacks, the Japanese ceased sending ships through the South China Sea in April.|$|E
5|$|Edward's grandson, {{the young}} Richard II, faced {{political}} and economic problems, many resulting from the Black Death, including the Peasants' Revolt that broke out <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>south</b> of England in 1381. Over the coming decades, Richard and groups of nobles vied for power and control of policy towards France until Henry of Bolingbroke seized the throne {{with the support of}} parliament in 1399. Ruling as Henry IV, he exercised power through a royal council and parliament, while attempting to enforce political and religious conformity. His son, Henry V, reinvigorated the war with France and came close to achieving strategic success shortly before his death in 1422. Henry VI became king at the age of only nine months and both the English political system and the military situation in France began to unravel.|$|E
5|$|Golondrina points (formerly Plainview Golondrina) are {{lanceolate}} spear or dart projectile points, {{of medium}} size, dated to the transitional Paleo-Indian Period, between 9000–7000 BP. Golondrina points were attached on split-stem hafts {{and may have}} served to bring down medium-sized animals such as deer, as well as functioning as butchering knives. Distribution is widespread throughout most of Texas, and points have also been discovered in Arkansas and Mexico. The concentration of Golondrina specimens is highest <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> Texas Plains, where the point is the most prevalent of Paleo-Indian types and defines a distinctive cultural pattern for the region. The Golondrina point is so named for its flared basal corners ("ears"), which resemble a swallow's (golondrina in Spanish) split tail. Classification of Golondrina can be difficult because of its similarity to other types, particularly the Plainview point, to which it was originally thought to be related.|$|E

5|$|Golondrina {{points are}} {{widespread}} {{across much of}} central, southern, and western Texas, with distribution extending northward along the Balcones Escarpment. They are particularly prevalent <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> Texas Plains, so much {{so as to be}} said to represent the first unique cultural pattern in the area. Most Golondrina specimens from the South Texas Plains are not excavated but rather found on the site's surface. They often appear as part of mixed collections with artifacts of later periods. Several sites have also been found in Arkansas {{as well as in the}} Lower Pecos Canyonlands and the Mexican states of Tamaulipas and Nuevo León.|$|E
5|$|In a {{departure}} from the political traditions of the day, Weaver himself campaigned, making speeches <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> in July and August. As the Greenbackers had the only ticket that included a Southerner, Weaver and Chambers hoped to make inroads in the South. As the campaign progressed, however, Weaver's message of racial inclusion drew violent protests in the South, as the Greenbackers faced the same obstacles the Republicans did in the face of increasing black disenfranchisement. In the autumn, Weaver campaigned in the North, but the Greenbackers' lack of support was compounded by Weaver's refusal to run a fusion ticket in states where Democratic and Greenbacker strength might have combined to outvote the Republicans.|$|E
5|$|On March 1 ("Super Tuesday"), Clinton {{won seven}} of eleven contests, {{including}} {{a string of}} dominating victories <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> buoyed, as in South Carolina, by African-American voters and opened up a significant lead in pledged delegates over Sanders. She maintained this delegate lead across subsequent contests during the primary season, with a consistent pattern throughout being that Sanders did better among younger, whiter, more rural and more liberal voters and in states that held caucuses or where eligibility was open to independents, while Clinton did better among older and more diverse voter populations and in states that held primaries or where eligibility was restricted to registered Democrats.|$|E
