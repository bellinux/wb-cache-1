I wish to see you—It was {{perfectly}} well when I went to bed—I awoke in the night to give it suck it appeared to be sleeping so quietly that I would not awake it. It was dead then, but we did not find that out till morning—from its appearance it evidently died of convulsions—Will you come—you are so calm a creature & Shelley is afraid of a fever from the milk—for I <b>am</b> <b>no</b> longer a mother now.|$|E
5|$|A plain {{soldier and}} {{business}} man. I <b>am</b> <b>no</b> politician, nor have I {{any desire to}} be one. In {{the course of my}} commercial career it has been my fate to have had much experience of politicians and their ways. What I have seen in the course of that experience has given me little respect either for the professional politician or his methods. I am desirous of seeing this country governed in the ways of clear common sense and good sound business principles, and I think that desire of mine is heartily share by {{the vast majority of the}} population.|$|E

40|$|This paper entertains {{the notion}} that without their {{opposite}}s, things, and by extension, human thought would not exist. Without its opposite aspect, each thing or thought loses the condition for its existence. Without life, there would <b>be</b> <b>no</b> death; without death, there would <b>be</b> <b>no</b> life. Without "above", there would <b>be</b> <b>no</b> "below " without "below", there would <b>be</b> <b>no</b> "above". Without misfortune, there would <b>be</b> <b>no</b> fortune; without fortune, there would <b>be</b> <b>no</b> misfortune. Without facility, there would <b>be</b> <b>no</b> difficulty, without difficulty, there would <b>be</b> <b>no</b> facility. Without landlords, there would <b>be</b> <b>no</b> tenants; without tenants, there would <b>be</b> <b>no</b> landlords. A definition of a thing, entity or a concept necessarily implies its opposite. Reflected alongside this contradiction, education in which its definition bears transmission of knowledge cannot exclude ignorance, which implies the absence of knowledge. Without ignorance, there would <b>be</b> <b>no</b> knowledge, without knowledge, there would <b>be</b> <b>no</b> ignorance. It <b>is</b> the object of this paper to qualify ignorance as a dimension of education, hence its inclusion {{in the definition of}} education...|$|R
25|$|There were 72 {{restaurant}} staff {{present in}} the restaurant, including acting manager Christine Anne Olender, whose desperate calls to Port Authority police represented the restaurant's final communications. 16 Incisive Media-Risk Waters Group employees, and 76 other guests/contractors were also present. The last people to leave the restaurant before Flight 11 collided with the North Tower at 8:46 AM were Michael Nestor, Liz Thompson, Geoffrey Wharton, and Richard Tierney. They departed at 8:44 AM and survived the attack. After about 9:40 <b>AM,</b> <b>no</b> further distress calls from the restaurant were made.|$|E
25|$|When evening comes, I go back home, {{and go to}} my study. On the threshold, I {{take off}} my work clothes, covered in mud and filth, and I put on the clothes an {{ambassador}} would wear.

I am not ashamed {{to talk to them}} and ask them to explain their actions and they, out of kindness, answer me. Four hours go by without my feeling any anxiety. I forget every worry.

25|$|Only {{three minutes}} after the collision, the San Juan capsized {{completely}} onto her port side and sank by the stern. It was the fastest sinking of any ship on the West Coast of the United States. During this final plunge, the San Juan's deck was torn apart. Survivors reported the final plunge took many by surprise, {{to the point where}} many were nearly dragged down with the sinking vessel. Many lifeboats were unable to be launched due to the speed of San Juan's foundering. The S.C.T. Dodd and the freighter Munami immediately began pulling survivors from the water. After 8:00 <b>A.M.,</b> <b>no</b> more survivors could be located. The Munami subsequently transferred its injured survivors to the Coast Guard cutter Shawnee, where they would be transported to San Francisco. In total, the disaster claimed 77 people, leaving only 42 survivors.|$|E

When John Bell Hood and his wife died in 1879, leaving ten destitute orphans, Beauregard used his influence to get Hood's memoirs published, with all proceeds going to the children. He was appointed by the governor of Virginia to be the grand marshal of the festivities associated with the laying of the cornerstone of Robert E. Lee's statue in Richmond. But when Jefferson Davis died in 1889, Beauregard refused the honor of heading the funeral procession, saying [...] "We have always been enemies. I cannot pretend I am sorry he is gone.

500|$|Larter next {{appeared}} as Zerelda Mimms {{in the western}} comedy American Outlaws. Directed by Les Mayfield and co-starring Colin Farrell and Scott Caan, the movie was poorly received by critics and at the box office, garnering US$13 million {{at the end of}} its theatrical run. She also starred in Kevin Smith's Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. That year, Larter appeared on the cover of Maxim magazine and performed in the stage play The Vagina Monologues in New York City. In Spring 2002, Larter moved from Los Angeles to New York. [...] "I was too young and impressionable to handle the pressures of L.A." [...] Larter recalled in an interview, [...] "I'm a woman now.

When Mason became chairman of the manufacturing firm Nash-Kelvinator in 1948, he invited Romney along [...] "to learn the business from the ground up" [...] as his roving assistant, and the new executive spent a year working {{in different parts of the}} company. At an inefficient Detroit refrigerator plant of the Kelvinator appliance division, Romney battled the Mechanics Educational Society of America union to institute a new industrial–labor relations program that forestalled the whole facility being shut down. He appealed to the workers by saying, [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>no</b> college man. I've laid floors, I've done lathing. I've thinned beets and shocked wheat." [...] As Mason's protégé, Romney assumed executive assignment for the development of the Rambler.|$|E

All elements of the battalion were ashore by 11:30 <b>am.</b> <b>No</b> opposition was encountered, and the 14th/32nd Battalion began to establish defensive and living positions. In addition, personnel from the battalion were detailed to unload stores. Sandover regarded the lack of opposition as fortunate, as the landing craft which were to carry the soldiers from the ships to the shore arrived late and he perceived that the RAAF had failed to provide adequate support. However, he was pleased with his brigade's performance during operations in New Britain up to that time, and expressed pleasure at having [...] "nearly reached the war". The 180 man-strong advanced party of the 5th Base Sub Area was landed on 5 November, and began work on establishing logistics facilities.|$|E

500|$|On May 21, 1937, Roosevelt visited Westmoreland Homesteads to {{mark the}} arrival of the community’s final homesteader.

I do not like charities," [...] she had said earlier. But {{cooperative}} communities such as Westmoreland Homesteads, she went on, offered an alternative to [...] "our rather settled ideas" [...] that could [...] "provide equality of opportunity for all and prevent the recurrence of a similar disaster [...] in the future." [...] Residents were so taken by her personal expression of interest in the program that they promptly agreed to rename the community in her honor.
