40|$|DNA {{sequences}} coding for 81 % of the ompA gene from 24 chlamydial strains, representing all chlamydial species, {{were determined}} from DNA amplified by polymerase chain reactions. Chlamydial strains of serovars and strains with similar chromosomal {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} had identical ompA DNA sequences. The ompA sequences were segregated into 23 different ompA alleles and aligned with each other, and phylogenetic relationships {{among them were}} inferred by neighbor-joining and maximum parsimony analyses. The neighbor-joining method produced a single phylogram which was rooted at the branch between two major clusters. One cluster included all Chlamydia trachomatis ompA alleles (trachoma group). The second cluster was composed of three major groups of ompA alleles: psittacosis group (alleles MN, 6 BC, A 22 /M, B 577, LW 508, FEPN, and GPIC), pneumonia group (Chlamydia pneumoniae AR 388 with the allele KOALA), <b>and</b> polyarthritis group (<b>ruminant</b> <b>and</b> <b>porcine</b> chlamydial alleles LW 613, 66 P 130, L 71, and 1710 S with propensity for polyarthritis). These groups were distinguished through specific DNA sequence signatures. Maximum parsimony analysis yielded two equally most parsimonious phylograms with topologies similar to the ompA tree of neighbor joining. Two phylograms constructed from chlamydial genomic DNA distances had topologies identical to that of the ompA phylogram with respect to branching of the chlamydial species. Human serovars of C. trachomatis with essentially identical genomes represented a single taxonomic unit, while they were divergent in the ompA tree. Consistent with the ompA phylogeny, the porcine isolate S 45, previously considered to be Chlamydia psittaci, was identified as C. trachomatis through biochemical characteristics. These data demonstrate that chlamydial ompA allelic relationships, except for human serovars of C. trachomatis, are cognate with chromosomal phylogenies...|$|R

In this study, a total of 86 fecal samples from suspected dairy cattle were obtained from 11 traditional dairy farms in Moghan region. All samples were evaluated by direct microscopic examination. Subsequently, milk sample of the related cattle were tested by PCR technique. Twenty samples from positive and 10 specimens of negative samples in direct microscopic assay were selected randomly for PCR examination. Among the 86 samples, 51 (59 %) samples were positive, while, 35 (41 %) samples were found as negative by microscopic assay. From 20 positive samples, 19 (95 %) samples showed positive result by PCR, however, among negative samples, 3 (30 %) samples were positive in PCR assay. Results revealed {{that there is a}} direct relation between contamination of fecal and milk samples. Moreover, due to the correlation between the results of microscopic examination of fecal samples and PCR assay of milk specimens, direct microscopic evaluation of feces could be performed prior to PCR-based detection of Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis in milk samples. According to the results, high contamination rate of Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis was found in milk samples. On the other hand, duo to possible etiological role of this bacterium in the development of Crohn’s diseases in human, it should be considered as a serious concern indeed...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of animal}} {{by-products}} in feed {{depends on their}} nature defined {{by the type of}} tissue or body parts and the species of origin. Currently, the detection of unauthorised processed animal proteins (PAPs) is based on light microscopy and PCR methods. Light microscopy identifies structures {{on the basis of their}} morphology and enables identification of particles (such as bones, cartilages, muscle fibres,…) while PCR is able to detect and identify the presence of specific animal DNA in feed. Nevertheless, for some scenarios, even combined, these methods do not succeed in determining the taxonomic origin of the PAPs. A typical example is that of an aquafeed containing authorised porcine PAP together with dairy products: the analysis will conclude of the potential presence of ruminant PAP. Therefore, there is a need for developing methods allowing a taxonomic characterisation of visual structures such as bones fragments and muscle fibres. For the characterisation of bones, NIRM has yet demonstrated its potential. However the limitation of NIRM is when the presence of bones is reduced or absent. This study investigated the potential of NIRM for the determination of the taxonomic origin of muscle fibres. The NIRM was experimented on 2 porcine PAPs vs. 6 <b>ruminant</b> PAPs <b>and</b> 7 fishmeals all of industrial origin. Results showed that NIRM allows differentiating muscle fibres from different taxonomic origins: fish, <b>ruminant</b> <b>and</b> pig. In addition to this taxonomic classification, results also reveal differences inside taxonomic clusters of PAPs (e. g among different <b>ruminant</b> PAPs <b>and</b> <b>porcine</b> PAPs). The results obtained on this type of meals are promising and offer new perspectives. Tests on adulterated feeds need to be performed by NIRM prior to validation. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The X {{chromosome}} {{linkage group}} is conserved in placental mammals. However, X chromosome morphological differences, due to internal chromosome rearrangements, exist among mammalian species. We have developed bovine chromosome painting probes for Xp and Xq to assess segment homologies between the submetacentric bovine X chromosome and the acrocentric {{sheep and goat}} X chromosomes. These painting probes and their corresponding DNA libraries were developed by chromosome micromanipulation, DNA micropurification, microcloning, and PCR amplification. The bovine Xp painting probe identified an interstitially located homologous segment in the sheep and goat Xq region, most probably resulting from chromosome inversion. Ten type II (microsatellite) markers obtained from the bovine Xq library and five other X chromosome assigned, but unlinked, markers were used to generate a linkage map for Xq spanning 89. 4 centimorgans. The chromosome painting probes and molecular markers generated in this study would be useful for comparative mapping and tracing of internal X chromosome rearrangements in <b>all</b> <b>ruminant</b> species <b>and</b> would contribute {{to the understanding of}} mammalian sex chromosome evolution...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Bluetongue virus (BTV) is an {{icosahedral}} non-enveloped virus {{within the}} genus Orbivirus of Reoviridae and exists as 24 distinct serotypes. BTV can infect <b>all</b> <b>ruminant</b> species <b>and</b> causes severe sickness in sheep. Recently, {{it was reported}} that BTV can infect some human cancer cells selectively. Because of the important oncolysis of this virus, we developed a novel purifying method for large-scale production. The purifying logic is simple, which is picking out all the components unwanted and the left is what we want. The process can be summarized in 4 steps: centrifugation, pulling down cell debrises and soluble proteins by co-immunoprecipitation with agarose Protein A, dialysis and filtration sterilization after concentration. Results The result of transmission electron microscope (TEM) observation showed that the sample of purified virus has a very clear background and the virions still kept intact. The result of 50 % tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50) assay showed that the bioactivity of purified virus is relatively high. Conclusions This method can purify BTV- 10 with high quality and high biological activity on large-scale production. It also can be used for purifying other BTV serotypes. </p...|$|R

40|$|Species {{dependent}} geonetical {{differences in}} renal clearance and urinary excretion of kanamycin were investigated in adult female buffaloes, cows, sheep and goats. The drug was administered {{as a single}} intravenous dose (5 mg/kg b. wt). Blood and urine samples were collected at various time intervals after drug administration. The plasma and urine concentrations of the drug were determined using the microbiological assay. The mean (± SE) values for endogenous creatinine clearance (an index of glomerular filtration rate) were 0. 77 ± 0. 05, 0. 49 ± 0. 07, 0. 81 ± 0. 07 and 0. 98 ± 0. 13 ml/min. kg in buffaloes, cows, sheep and goats, respectively. Experiments regarding kidney handling of kanamycin in these ruminant species revealed respective values of renal clearance as 0. 08 ± 0. 01, 0. 07 ± 0. 01, 0. 19 ± 0. 02 and 0. 23 ± 0. 04 ml/min. kg. Besides glomerular filtration, kanamycin was reabsorbed from the renal tubules of <b>all</b> <b>ruminant</b> species <b>and</b> actively secreted into the renal tubules of buffaloes and goats. The cumulative percentages of intravenous dose of kanamycin excreted through urine during 12 hours in buffaloes, cows, sheep and goats were 4. 31 ± 0. 37, 2. 53 ± 0. 30, 11. 0 ± 1. 04 and 15. 8 ± 2. 22, respectively.

These infections cause significant {{diseases such as}} polyarthritis, pneumonia, enteritis, genital infections and fertility disorders, and occasionally sporadic bovine encephalomyelitis. Subclinical respiratory infections of calves with C. pecorum {{have been associated with}} airway obstruction, pulmonary inflammation, and reduced weight gains. This investigation examined four chlamydial strains with biological properties of C. pecorum isolated from feces of clinically normal cattle, from calves with pneumonia, and from bulls with posthitis. The objective was to characterize the evolutionary relationships of these bovine chlamydial isolates to other chlamydiae by genetic analysis of the ompA gene, and by the immunological cross-reactivities in Western immunoblot analysis. PCR typing of the ompA gene identified these isolates as C. pecorum. The OmpA-deduced amino acid dissimilarities between these four strains spanned 10 - 20 %. In phylogenetic analysis, the four isolates clustered with C. pecorum <b>ruminant,</b> <b>porcine,</b> <b>and</b> koala strains of different geographic origins rather than with each other. All four isolates showed different patterns of Western immunoblot reactivity with antiserum against bovine C. pecorum strain LW 63, and, interestingly, no cross-reactivity of the OmpA proteins with the anti-LW 613 OmpA antibodies. These data underscore the polyphyletic population structure of C. pecorum and suggest that the spectrum of C. pecorum OmpA proteins in a host species can occupy the entire evolutionary bandwidth within C. pecorum. The variant immunoblot reactivities support the notion of considerable genomic plasticity of C. pecorum...|$|R

40|$|Gelatin is {{a mixture}} of polypeptides {{obtained}} by hydrolysis of collagen primarily from bovine <b>and</b> <b>porcine</b> skin <b>and</b> bones. The similarity between different gelatins makes it difficult to trace their species origin. In this work, a new method for differentiation between bovine <b>and</b> <b>porcine</b> gelatin was developed based on detection and identification of marker peptides in digested gelatins. Sequence alignment analysis indicates that bovine <b>and</b> <b>porcine</b> Type I collagen contain differential sequences. The gelatins were digested by trypsin, and the resulting peptides were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). The marker peptides specific for bovine <b>and</b> <b>porcine</b> were successfully detected in the digested bovine <b>and</b> <b>porcine</b> gelatin, respectively. Comparative analysis indicated that more marker peptides could be detected in gelatin with a higher mean molecular weight. It was found that proline hydroxylation was a key factor affecting the peptide identification. For peptides such as GPPGSAGSPGK and GPPGSAGAPGK detected in digested bovine <b>and</b> <b>porcine</b> gelatin, respectively, the sequence should be verified manually since the mass shift caused by proline hydroxylation can be confused with the mass difference between Set and Ala residues. The results indicate that detection of marker peptides in the digested gelatin sample using HPLC-MS/MS is an effective method to differentiate between bovine <b>and</b> <b>porcine</b> gelatin.
