5|$|<b>Afternoon</b> is a {{time when}} the sun is {{descending}} from its daytime peak. During the <b>afternoon,</b> the sun moves from roughly the center of the sky to deep in the west. In late <b>afternoon,</b> sunlight is particularly bright and glaring, because the sun is at a low angle in the sky. The standard working time in most industrialized countries goes from the morning to the late <b>afternoon</b> or evening—archetypally, 9 am to 5 pm—so the latter part of this time takes place in the <b>afternoon.</b> Schools usually let out during the <b>afternoon</b> as well.|$|E
5|$|As Allen {{approached}} the Gulf of Mexico, hurricane warnings were raised for the northeast Yucatán peninsula of Mexico from the <b>afternoon</b> of August 6 {{into the morning}} of August 8. Gale warnings were in effect for the Florida Keys from the evening of August 6 into the early morning of August 8. As Allen approached its final landfall, the northeast Mexican coast and Texas coast were placed under a hurricane watch from the morning of August 8 until the morning of August 9 for Mexico and the <b>afternoon</b> of August 9 for Texas. Hurricane warnings were posted for the Texas coast during the <b>afternoon</b> of August 8, and were lowered north of Freeport, Texas during the <b>afternoon</b> of August 9 and south of Freeport during the <b>afternoon</b> of August 10. Gale warnings and a hurricane watch were issued for the Louisiana coast from Vermilion Bay westward from the <b>afternoon</b> of August 8 into the <b>afternoon</b> of August 9. Hurricane warnings were in effect for northeast Mexico from the early <b>afternoon</b> of August 9 into the late <b>afternoon</b> of August 10. Hurricane warnings were downgraded to gale warnings between High Island, Texas and Freeport, Texas between the late <b>afternoon</b> of August 9 and the late <b>afternoon</b> of August 10. Hurricane watches were dropped for the Louisiana coast during the late <b>afternoon</b> of August 9. Hurricane warnings were downgraded to gale warnings for the lower Texas coast south of Freeport from the late <b>afternoon</b> of August 10 into the early morning of August 11.|$|E
5|$|<b>Afternoon</b> is {{the time}} {{occurring}} between noon and evening. The specific range of time this encompasses varies in one direction: noon is currently defined as a constant 12:00 pm, but when <b>afternoon</b> ends is dependent on when evening begins, {{for which there is}} no standard definition. However, before a period of transition from the twelfth to fourteenth centuries, noon instead referred to 3 pm—possible explanations include shifting times for prayers and midday meals, along which one concept of noon was defined—and so <b>afternoon</b> would have referred to a narrower timeframe.|$|E

5|$|Human {{productivity}} routinely {{decreases in}} the <b>afternoon.</b> Power plants have shown significant reductions in productivity in the <b>afternoon</b> {{compared to the}} morning, the largest differences occurring on Saturdays and the smallest on Mondays. One 1950s study covering two female factory workers for six months found that their productivity was 13 percent lower in the <b>afternoon,</b> the least productive time being their last hour at work. It was summarized that the differences came from personal breaks and unproductive activities at the workplace. Another, larger study found that <b>afternoon</b> declines in productivity were greater during longer work shifts.|$|E
5|$|The <b>afternoon,</b> {{especially}} the early <b>afternoon,</b> {{is associated with}} a dip in a variety of areas of human cognitive and productive functioning. Notably, motor vehicle accidents occur more frequently in the early <b>afternoon,</b> when drivers presumably have recently finished lunch. A study of motor accidents in Sweden between 1987 and 1991 found that the time around 5 pm had by far the most accidents: around 1,600 at 5 pm compared to around 1,000 each at 4 pm and 6 pm. This trend may have been influenced by the <b>afternoon</b> rush hour, but the morning rush hour showed a much smaller increase. In Finland, accidents in the agriculture industry are most common in the <b>afternoon,</b> specifically Monday afternoons in September.|$|E
5|$|The word <b>afternoon,</b> which {{derives from}} after and noon, has been attested from {{about the year}} 1300; Middle English {{contained}} both <b>afternoon</b> and the synonym aftermete. The standard locative marking for the word was at <b>afternoon</b> in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries but has shifted to in the <b>afternoon</b> since then. In Southern U.S. and Midland American English, the word evening is sometimes used to encompass all times between noon and night. The Irish language contains four different words to mark time intervals from late <b>afternoon</b> to nightfall, this period being considered mystical. Metaphorically, the word <b>afternoon</b> refers to a relatively late period in the expanse of time or in one's life.|$|E
