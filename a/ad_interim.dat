5|$|The Runaway Scrape events {{took place}} mainly between September 1835 and April 1836, {{and were the}} {{evacuations}} by Texas residents fleeing the Mexican Army of Operations during the Texas Revolution, from the Battle of the Alamo through the decisive Battle of San Jacinto. The <b>ad</b> <b>interim</b> government of the new Republic of Texas {{and much of the}} civilian population fled eastward ahead of the Mexican forces. The conflict arose after Antonio López de Santa Anna abrogated the 1824 constitution of Mexico and established martial law in Coahuila y Tejas. The Texians resisted and declared their independence. It was Sam Houston's responsibility, as the appointed commander-in-chief of the Provisional Army of Texas (before such an army actually existed), to recruit and train a military force to defend the population against troops led by Santa Anna.|$|E

During early skirmishes, some Texian soldiers surrendered, believing that they would become prisoners of war — but Santa Anna demanded their executions. The news of the Battle of the Alamo and the Goliad massacre instilled fear in the population and resulted in the mass exodus of the civilian population of Gonzales, where the opening battle of the Texian revolution had begun and where, only days before {{the fall of the}} Alamo, they had sent a militia to reinforce the defenders at the mission. The civilian refugees were accompanied by the newly forming provisional army, as Houston bought time to train soldiers and create a military structure that could oppose Santa Anna's greater forces. Houston's actions were viewed as cowardice by the <b>ad</b> <b>interim</b> government, as well as by some of his own troops. As he and the refugees from Gonzales escaped first to the Colorado River and then to the Brazos, evacuees from other areas trickled in and new militia groups arrived to join with Houston's force.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} the Constitution-making dispute mechanism {{in relation to the}} making of the 2010 of Kenya. What forcefully triggered the process of constitution-making was the 2007 - 2008 post-election violence which was brought to an end by the efforts of the Kofi-Annan dialogue and reconciliation initiatives. Of the several issues which required urgent attention so as to restore peace and order, the central item was the commencement of constitutional reforms which had stalled in the past. While the relevant statutory infrastructure in form of the Constitution of Kenya Review Act 2008 was established, the Act failed to address the manner in which disputes arising from the process of constitution-making would be settled in spite that at the time, the judiciary was generally an appendage of the executive. Later, an amendment to the Constitution was made which established the <b>ad</b> hoc <b>Interim</b> Independent Constitution Dispute Resolution Court (IICDRC). Notwithstanding the political climate then prevailing, there was no haste in the operationalization of the Court. After the Court commenced its work, it made some decisions which this paper considers a grave misdirection of the law thus denying itself an opportunity to fully determine the legitimacy of the draft constitution and thereby the 2010 Constitution of Kenya. The paper recommends that dispute settlement mechanisms and related matters should be fully integrated in constitution-making or reform enterprise...|$|R

He made an Application (Motion) in the Supreme Court of Ontario {{to declare the}} election invalid {{on the grounds that}} the government of Premier David Peterson failed to ensure the [...] "Equal access to goods and services as any other business or any other person" [...] for all political parties and all candidates as stipulated by the Ontario Election Finances Act. Among many other problems, Siroky was refused campaign banking services by several Canadian chartered banks for himself and the [...] "New Tories". Some bank managers, publishers and other providers of goods and services refused to provide any services, several facetiously stating that they were [...] "Old Tories". This prevented Siroky from legally constituting the New Tory Party by fielding then-required 50 candidates because he was prevented from legally raising and disbursing funds for the campaign, running advertisements and engaging in recruiting candidates in all electoral districts of Ontario. The Supreme Court Motion failed since Siroky, the <b>ad</b> hoc <b>interim</b> leader and spokesman of the [...] "New Tory Party", who acted in Court on his own behalf, had [...] "standing" [...] only in his electoral district of St. George and therefore did not have the legal standing to declare the whole election invalid. Siroky did not avail himself of the opportunity verbally to amend the Motion so as to limit it to the electoral district of St. George only. Siroky failed to see any merit in rerunning the election in St. George, where the position of the incumbent Susan Fish (PC) was very strong and at any rate this would not enable [...] "New Tory Party" [...] legally to constitute itself. The Presiding Justice of the Supreme Court of Ontario had no option but to deny Siroky's Motion to Declare Election Invalid. Siroky apparently believed that he made his point and accomplished his objective of ensuring equal access to goods and services for all political candidates in future elections.|$|R
40|$|Although HAART {{suppresses}} HIV replication, it {{is often}} unable to restore immune homeostasis. Consequently, non-AIDS-defining diseases are increasingly seen in treated individuals. This is attributed to persistent virus expression in reservoirs and to cell activation. Of note, in CD 4 (+) T cells and monocyte-macrophages of virologically-suppressed individuals, there is continued expression of multi-spliced transcripts encoding HIV regulatory proteins. Among them, Tat is essential for virus gene expression and replication, either in primary infection or for virus reactivation during HAART, when Tat is expressed, released extracellularly and exerts, on both the virus and the immune system, effects that contribute to disease maintenance. Here we report results of an <b>ad</b> hoc exploratory <b>interim</b> analysis (up to 48 weeks) on 87 virologically-suppressed HAART-treated individuals enrolled in a phase II randomized open-label multicentric clinical trial of therapeutic immunization with Tat (ISS T- 002). Eighty-eight virologically-suppressed HAART-treated individuals, enrolled in a parallel prospective observational study at the same sites (ISS OBS T- 002), served for intergroup comparison. Immunization with Tat was safe, induced durable immune responses, and modified the pattern of CD 4 (+) and CD 8 (+) cellular activation (CD 38 and HLA-DR) together with reduction of biochemical activation markers and persistent increases of regulatory T cells. This {{was accompanied by a}} progressive increment of CD 4 (+) T cells and B cells with reduction of CD 8 (+) T cells and NK cells, which were independent from the type of antiretroviral regimen. Increase in central and effector memory and reduction in terminally-differentiated effector memory CD 4 (+) and CD 8 (+) T cells were accompanied by increases of CD 4 (+) and CD 8 (+) T cell responses against Env and recall antigens. Of note, more immune-compromised individuals experienced greater therapeutic effects. In contrast, these changes were opposite, absent or partial in the OBS population. These findings support the use of Tat immunization to intensify HAART efficacy and to restore immune homeostasis. ClinicalTrials. gov NCT 00751595...|$|R
40|$|Thesis [...] University of WashingtonThe eastern Pacific {{tropical}} tuna fishery has {{developed in the}} last seven decades from its antecedents in a small pole-and-line fishery for albacore tuna in near-shore California waters to a large technologically-advanced multi-national tuna purse seine fishery in the eastern Pacific Ocean from Mexico to Peru and offshore to 2000 miles. Concerns raised by the rapid development of the tuna fishery resulted in the formation in 1949 of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) to study scientifically the tuna and associated bait fisheries in the area, and to make any needed management recommendations to the Commission's member governments. An ad hoc Inter-Governmental Meeting (IGM) was initiated in 1961 as an informal adjunct to the IATTC, to deal with international regulation of the tuna fishery. The fishery for yellowfin tunas was first regulated in 1966. This limitation of the catch, the increasing number of nations in the fishery, the growing capacity of these fleets to harvest the yellowfin quota, the economic and national needs of the Latin-American Pacific coastal states and the developing trend to control by the coastal states of fishery resources to 200 miles offshore led to increasingly difficult annual resolution of the allocation of the yellowfin quota among the participants in the fishery. More and more aware that neither the IATTC Convention developed in 1949 nor the IGM mechanism devised in 1961 could deal satisfactorily with the new problems of the 1970 's, Mexico and Costa Rica in late 1977 convened a Conference of Plenipotentiaries to develop a new management regime for the eastern Pacific tuna fishery. During subsequent meetings and at a second Conference of Plenipotentiaries in early 1979, important understandings toward a new management regime were reached, but the fundamental problem of the allocation of the resource among the participants eluded resolution throughout the negotiations. If an international management regime is not agreed upon for the 1980 tuna fishing season, unregulated fishing with concomitant eventual damage to the yellowfin resource will very probably occur. <b>Interim</b> <b>ad</b> hoc management arrangements which might develop {{as a result of the}} breakdown of regulation would have negative economic, social and biological consequences. An understanding by the participants of these consequences may force the development of an interim 3 to 5 year tuna management agreement which, while not completely satisfactory to any, will provide a period of relative stability during which new arrangements can be evolved...|$|R

His time spent as an office clerk proved to be beneficial in allowing him to acquire the knowledge that would lead him to enter the law office of John Passmore, Esquire. Porter was settled in Philadelphia in 1813 when rumors spread across the city that the British were coming during the War of 1812. Porter took matters into his own hands and organized militia units along the Delaware River. Although the British never arrived, the people of Philadelphia applauded his efforts. His military service ceased upon his arrival in Easton, Pennsylvania in 1818, but resumed in 1843 when President John Tyler appointed him Secretary of War. President Tyler named Porter his secretary <b>ad</b> <b>interim,</b> hoping that after time, the Senate would approve Porter's nomination. However, Porter served in the Cabinet only eleven months because the Senate did not confirm his nomination.

This was why the attack was conducted in a column four horses wide. After the first battery was taken, chevaulegers, without slowing the full gallop charge gained the top of the Pass in about eight minutes. All four batteries were taken, and the road to Madrid opened for Napoleon's Army. The charge was led by Kozietulski who, however, lost his horse after taking the first battery. The squadron was then joined by Lt. Andrzej Niegolewski, who had previously been on reconnaissance with his troop. The charge was continued under Dziewanowski, and when he fell from his horse after taking the third battery, by Piotr Krasiński.
