5|$|The {{fuselage}} of {{the aircraft}} is built around the cannon. The GAU-8/A is mounted slightly to the port side; the barrel in the firing location is on the starboard side at the 9 o'clock position so it is aligned with the aircraft's centerline. The gun's 5-foot, 11.5-inch (1.816 m) <b>ammunition</b> <b>drum</b> can hold up to 1,350 rounds of 30mm ammunition, but generally holds 1,174 rounds. To protect the GAU-8/A rounds from enemy fire, armor plates of differing thicknesses between the aircraft skin and the drum are designed to detonate incoming shells.|$|E
25|$|A larger 20 {{millimeter}} <b>ammunition</b> <b>drum,</b> {{derived from}} the General Dynamics F-111, was fitted, which required a deeper fuselage.|$|E
25|$|The GAU-8/A {{ammunition}} is linkless, reducing {{weight and}} avoiding {{a great deal}} of potential for jamming. The feed system is double-ended, allowing the spent casings to be recycled back into the <b>ammunition</b> <b>drum,</b> instead of ejected from the aircraft, which would require considerable force to eliminate potential airframe damage. The feed system is based on that developed for later M61 installations, but uses more advanced design techniques and materials throughout, to save weight.|$|E

50|$|The 30 mm Gatling {{gun mount}} {{designated}} as H/PJ-12 is extremely {{similar to the}} General Electric GAU-8/A Avenger. Although there are sources claiming {{that it is the}} Chinese version of the Russian Gryazev-Shipunov GSh-6-30 Gatling gun, this appears to be unlikely, since the Russian Gatling gun only has six barrels. H/PJ-12 is versatile in that its FCS system can be either separately installed at different locations like the Soviet AK-630, or directly integrated on the gun mount. Like the American GAU-8/A Avenger, it is recommended not to fire longer than a single minute at a rate of 4,200 rounds per minute, after which the generated heat would begin melting the rifling of the barrels, shortening its useful life. Rates of fire beyond 4,200 rounds per minutes increase wear. There are one or two <b>ammunition</b> <b>drums</b> each contains 640 or 1000 rounds, and other versions of the <b>ammunition</b> <b>drums</b> have been reportedly developed.|$|R
50|$|Standard {{accessories}} {{supplied with}} the weapon include an ammunition container, extra belts, a cleaning rod (carried {{on the left}} side of the receiver), cleaning kit (stowed in a compartment inside the stock), sling and pouches for the <b>ammunition</b> <b>drums.</b> (Although not designed for such a position, an RPD is capable of being fired from the hip by utilizing the sling to hang the gun over the user's shoulder).|$|R
25|$|The {{much longer}} and heavier MG FF {{had to be}} mounted farther along the wing in an outer bay. A large hole was cut through the spar {{allowing}} the cannon to be fitted with the ammunition feed forward of the spar, while the breech block projected rearward through the spar. A 60-round <b>ammunition</b> <b>drum</b> {{was placed in a}} space closer to the wing root causing a bulge in the underside. A small hatch was incorporated in the bulge to allow access for changing the drum. The entire weapon could be removed for servicing by removing a leading edge panel.|$|E
25|$|The French Nieuport 11 {{and later}} on, the Nieuport 17 and the British Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5 aircraft, the Lewis was mounted above the top wing, {{sometimes}} on a Foster mount, which allowed firing directly forward outside the propeller arc. The Foster mount usually incorporated an arc-shaped I-beam rail as its rearmost structural member, that a Lewis gun could be slid backwards and downwards along the rail towards the cockpit, {{to allow the}} <b>ammunition</b> <b>drum</b> to be changed in flight — but fighter ace Albert Ball V.C. also understood that the Lewis gun in such a mount also retained its original trigger, and could thus be fired upwards. He used the upward firing Lewis to attack solitary German two-seater aircraft from below and behind, where the observer could not see him or fire back. It was {{his use of the}} weapon in this way, in a Nieuport, that led to its later introduction on the S.E.5/S.E.5a. Ball had acted in a consultant capacity on the development of this aeroplane. The later Sopwith Dolphin, already armed with twin synchronized Vickers guns just forward of the pilot and just above its V-8 engine, could also use one or two Lewis guns mounted on the forward crossbar of its cabane structure, between the top wing panels, as an anti-Zeppelin measure.|$|E
2500|$|A6M5a, Model 52甲 (Kō, a) – Starting at Mitsubishi number 4651, an {{armament}} change substituted the belt-fed Type 99-2 Mark 4 cannon, with 125 rounds per gun, {{in place}} of the drum-fed Type 99-2 Mark 3 cannon that carried 100 rounds per gun. Hence, the bulge in the underside of the wing for each cannon's <b>ammunition</b> <b>drum</b> was deleted and the ejection port for spent cartridge cases was moved. [...] Thicker wing skinning was installed to permit higher diving speeds.|$|E
25|$|Pilots of 87 Squadron, {{including}} Arthur Vigers, experimentally fitted some aircraft {{with two}} forward firing, unsynchronized Lewis guns mounted {{on top of}} the lower wing, just inboard of the inner wing struts. These guns could fire incendiary ammunition, which could not be used with the synchronized Vickers guns. The 97-round <b>ammunition</b> <b>drums</b> could not be changed once empty, nor could the pilot clear gun jams and the field modification did not become standard.|$|R
50|$|The weapon {{combines}} two barrels into {{a single}} mechanism so that the recoil from firing one barrel loads and charges the second. Ammunition feeds into the gun from two vertically mounted cylindrical drums, one on each side. The drums held 180 rounds of German 7.92 mm rifle ammunition, feeding them into the breech using a compressed spring. An experienced gunner could change <b>ammunition</b> <b>drums</b> in a few seconds. The weapon could fire single shots if {{one side of the}} mechanism had a problem.|$|R
60|$|A {{very large}} amount of spoil had been captured, the first haul of any {{importance}} {{that had been made}} during the campaign. Among the loot were the king of the Kokofu's iron boxes, containing much official correspondence; union jacks, elephant tails, and other symbols of royalty, together with gold ornaments, gold dust, and two hundred pounds of English money; numbers of brass-nailed, vellum-backed chairs, part of the Ashanti chief's regalia; robes, guns, <b>ammunition,</b> <b>drums,</b> and horns, and also sheep and poultry.|$|R
2500|$|The Universal wing {{also took}} into account {{the fact that the}} Hispano cannon had been {{converted}} to belt-feed, a move which allowed each cannon to carry double the ammunition load, or 120 rpg in ammunition trays instead of 60 rpg as in the original drum-fed cannon of the F.Mk Vb. This also eliminated the need for under- and over-wing blisters to accommodate the large-diameter <b>ammunition</b> <b>drum,</b> instead only requiring a small blister to cover the electrical [...] "Chattellerault" [...] feed mechanism.|$|E
2500|$|The GAU-8 itself weighs , but the {{complete}} weapon, with feed system and drum, weighs [...] {{with a maximum}} ammunition load. It measures [...] from the muzzle to the rearmost point of the ammunition system, and the <b>ammunition</b> <b>drum</b> alone is [...] in diameter and [...] long. Power for operating the gun is provided by twin hydraulic motors pressurized from two independent hydraulic systems. The magazine can hold 1,174 rounds, although 1,150 is the typical load-out. Muzzle velocity when firing Armor-Piercing Incendiary rounds is 1,013m/s, almost {{the same as the}} substantially lighter M61 Vulcan's 20mm round, giving the gun a muzzle energy of just over 200 kilojoules.|$|E
2500|$|A Honeywell ring laser {{gyroscope}} {{was used for}} spin rate determination and to obtain an inertial timing reference before the MHV separated from the second stage. [...] The infrared sensor was developed by Hughes Research Laboratories. The sensor utilized a strip detector where four strips of Indium Bismuth were arranged in a cross and four strips were arranged as logarithmic spirals. As the detector was spun, the infrared target's position could be measured as it crossed the strips in the sensor's field of view. The MHV infrared detector was cooled by liquid helium from a dewar installed {{in place of the}} F-15's gun <b>ammunition</b> <b>drum</b> and from a smaller dewar located in the second stage of the ASM-135. Cryogenic lines from the second stage were retracted prior to the spin up of the MHV.|$|E
25|$|Some of the {{challenges}} encountered during the Crucible are team and individual obstacle courses, day and night assault courses, land navigation courses, individual rushes up steep hills, large-scale martial arts challenges and countless patrols to and from each of these. These challenges are often made even more difficult by the additions of limitations or handicaps, such as the requirement to carry several <b>ammunition</b> <b>drums,</b> not touching portions of an obstacle painted red to indicate simulated booby traps and evacuating team members with simulated wounds.|$|R
50|$|In August 1917, Gast's {{demonstration}} {{so impressed}} ordnance experts that a production order for 3,000 guns, along with spare parts and ten <b>ammunition</b> <b>drums</b> for each gun, {{was awarded to}} Vorwerk und Companie at a unit price of 6,800 marks each. Delivery of the first 100 guns was promised for 1 June 1918, with production increasing to 500 guns per month by September 1918. Production of the weapon exceeded these initial projections, and the weapons were favorably received with promises of an order for a further 6,000 guns being promised in September 1918.|$|R
5000|$|In early 1916 Sergeant Foster of 11 Squadron RFC {{improved}} the French hinged mounting {{for the upper}} wing Lewis gun on a Nieuport 11 or 16, by replacing the awkward double hinge of the French mount with a quadrant shaped sliding rail. The sliding rail became the feature of all later [...] "Foster" [...] mountings, and enabled the breech of the gun to swing back and down in one movement, bringing the breech conveniently {{in front of the}} pilot, and making it much easier to change <b>ammunition</b> <b>drums</b> or to clear stoppages.|$|R
2500|$|The B-type wing was {{structurally}} an A type {{modified to}} carry one 20mm Hispano cannon per wing, which replaced the two inner [...]303 machine guns. The retractable underwing landing lamp was repositioned. The cannon {{was installed in}} the innermost machine gun bay, next to the wheelwell, while the second gun was deleted altogether. The area where the inner guns ammunition trays had been located, outboard of the cannon bay, was converted into a compartment to accommodate the 60-round drum magazine for the cannon. The upper and lower wing skins now incorporated blisters to clear the large <b>ammunition</b> <b>drum</b> (the underwing blisters came in two different shapes). The remaining outer pairs of [...]303's were not changed at all. Only one armament suite could be fitted to a Spitfire with the B-type wing: Two 20mm Hispano Mk II cannon, each with a 60-round drum, and four [...]303 caliber Browning machine guns in the outer positions, with 350 rpg. Alloy-covered ailerons were standardised on this wing type.|$|E

50|$|A larger 20 {{millimeter}} <b>ammunition</b> <b>drum,</b> {{derived from}} the General Dynamics F-111, was fitted, requiring the KingCobra have a deeper fuselage.|$|E
50|$|Further {{development}} of Type 730 {{resulted in the}} Type 1130, which first appeared on Chinese aircraft carrier Liaoning. This successor of Type 730 is also 30 mm caliber and has a total 11 barrels, with reported rate of fire of 9,000 to 10,000 rounds per minute. Originally developed with 10 barrels, later productions included 11 barrels when completed. Although it is reported that FL-3000 missiles can be integrated to the gun like FCS, this has not occurred yet, and FL-3000 was installed separately on the first Chinese aircraft carrier in its own launchers. There are two <b>ammunition</b> <b>drums</b> each contains 1280 rounds.|$|R
50|$|He {{earned his}} VC during the Arras offensive. On 9 April 1917 near Arras, Sergeant Cator's platoon had {{suffered}} heavy casualties from a hostile machine-gun. Under heavy fire the sergeant, with one man, advanced {{across the open}} to attack the gun and when his companion was killed, he went on alone. Picking up a Lewis gun and some <b>ammunition</b> <b>drums</b> on his way, he succeeded in reaching the enemy trench and sighting another hostile machine-gun, he killed the entire team and the officer. He held {{the end of the}} trench with such effect that a bombing squad were able to capture 100 prisoners and five machine-guns.|$|R
25|$|A {{proof of}} concept {{prototype}} was built with a 4.02inch (102mm) barrel, but otherwise was as intended. It was mostly automatic, and could be operated by a single person sitting in a covered control cabin on the right hand side of the vehicle. However, the enormous power and ammunition requirements for the piece resulted in it having to have two trailers in support - one for power, and one for ammunition - and a crew with a small crane in order to reload the two <b>ammunition</b> <b>drums.</b> With only 28 rounds available in the drums, and an 80-90 rounds/minute fire rate, reloading was a frequent task. It took a crew between ten and fifteen minutes to reload.|$|R
50|$|Developed in the Soviet Union by arms {{designer}} Vasily Degtyaryov.The PPD {{was designed}} to chamber the new Soviet 7.62×25mm Tokarev pistol cartridge, {{which was based on}} the similar 7.63×25mm Mauser cartridge used in the Mauser C96 pistol. The PPD utilized a large <b>ammunition</b> <b>drum.</b>|$|E
50|$|The GAU-8/A {{ammunition}} is linkless, reducing {{weight and}} avoiding {{a great deal}} of potential for jamming. The feed system is double-ended, allowing the spent casings to be recycled back into the <b>ammunition</b> <b>drum,</b> instead of ejected from the aircraft, which would require considerable force to eliminate potential airframe damage. The feed system is based on that developed for later M61 installations, but uses more advanced design techniques and materials throughout, to save weight.|$|E

25|$|From the outset, each Meteor was {{constructed}} from several modular sections or separately produced units, a deliberate design choice {{to allow for}} production to be dispersed and for easy disassembly for transport. Each aircraft comprised five main sections: nose, forward fuselage, central section, rear fuselage and tail units; the wings were also built out of lengthwise sections. The forward section contained the pressure cabin, gun compartments, and forward undercarriage. The center section incorporated much of the structural elements, including the inner wing, engine nacelles, fuel tank, <b>ammunition</b> <b>drums,</b> and main undercarriage. The rear fuselage was of a conventional semi-monocoque structure. Various aluminium alloys were the primary materials used throughout {{the structure of the}} Meteor, such as the stressed duralumin skin.|$|R
50|$|The Foster {{mounting}} was {{a device}} fitted to some fighter aircraft of the Royal Flying Corps during the First World War. It {{was designed to}} enable a machine gun (in practice, a Lewis Gun) to fire over, rather than through the arc of the spinning propeller. It took several forms when applied to different aircraft types, but all shared the feature of a quadrant shaped slide on which the gun could be drawn back and down in one movement. The primary purpose was to facilitate the changing of spent <b>ammunition</b> <b>drums,</b> but some pilots {{also found that the}} mounting permitted the gun to be fired directly upward or at an angle, permitting a fighter aircraft to attack an opponent from beneath.|$|R
50|$|On 13 August 1918, Coler and Gladman {{destroyed}} three Fokker D.VIIs {{and drove}} down two others {{out of control}} within a few minutes; Seeley won the DFC for this mission. The action began when Coler dived on 20 Fokker D.VIIs, setting one with a red nose and yellow fuselage on fire {{from a range of}} ten yards. He sent another spinning down out of control before his Vickers machine guns jammed. While he was clearing the jam, Gladman knocked a Fokker down out of control. As Coler cleared his guns' stoppage, a Fokker crossed before him 50 yards out; Coler fired 60 rounds into it and set it afire. Gladman then was shot in the right shoulder while changing <b>ammunition</b> <b>drums.</b> Nothing daunted, he shot it down left-handed, sending it down in flames.|$|R
50|$|Upon {{promotion}} to Flight Commander, Libby transferred to 25 Squadron, which shared its airfield with 43 Squadron. He was assigned B Flight. Libby was nearly killed by accident around this time. The DH-4 had controls {{accessible to the}} observer, and while engaged in a dogfight, a Lewis <b>ammunition</b> <b>drum</b> jammed the rudder, slewing it into a constant right hand turn. Once the problem was remedied, Libby returned to base. His experience led to the rear seat rudder bar being covered by plywood.|$|E
50|$|The Type 99 Mark 1 {{was adopted}} by the Japanese for both fixed and {{flexible}} installations. The fixed installation was developed first, as a fighter gun fed by a 60 round drum magazine, mounted in the wings of the famous Mitsubishi A6M Zeke or Zero. A flexible version, initially developed for the Mitsubishi G3M bomber, was inverted to put the <b>ammunition</b> <b>drum</b> below the line of sight of the gunner. Smaller drums (45, 30 or 15 rounds) were used on flexible installations where space was limited.|$|E
50|$|Practically no powered rotary cannon is {{supplied}} with sufficient ammunition {{for a full}} minute of firing, due to its weight. In order to avoid using the few hundred rounds carried all at once, a burst controller is generally used {{to limit the number}} of rounds fired at each trigger pull. Bursts of from two or three up to 40 or 50 can be selected. The size of the airframe and available internal space limits the size of the <b>ammunition</b> <b>drum</b> and thus limits the ammunition capacity.|$|E
50|$|Tents {{were used}} for billeting and for support facilities; an access road was built to the {{existing}} road infrastructure; a dump for supplies, <b>ammunition,</b> and gasoline <b>drums,</b> along with a drinkable water and minimal electrical grid for communications and station lighting.|$|R
5000|$|The Beaufighter's {{armament}} {{was located}} in various positions on the lower fuselage and wings. The bomb bay of the Beaufort had been entirely omitted, however a small bomb load could be carried externally. A total of four forward-firing 20 mm Hispano Mk III cannons were mounted in the lower fuselage area. These were initially fed from 60-round drums, requiring the radar operator to change the <b>ammunition</b> <b>drums</b> manually—an arduous and unpopular task, especially at night and while chasing a bomber. As a result, they were soon replaced by a belt-feed system. [...] The cannons were supplemented by six [...]303 in (7.7 mm) Browning machine guns in the wings (four starboard, two port, the asymmetry caused by the port mounting of the landing light). This {{was one of the}} heavier, if not the heaviest, fighter armament of its time. When Beaufighters were developed as fighter-torpedo bombers, they used their firepower (often the machine guns were removed) to suppress flak fire and hit enemy ships, especially escorts and small vessels. The recoil of the cannons and machine guns could reduce the speed of the aircraft by around 25 knots.|$|R
50|$|In addition, tents {{were used}} for billeting and also for support facilities; an access road was built to the {{existing}} road infrastructure; a dump for supplies, <b>ammunition,</b> and gasoline <b>drums,</b> along with a drinkable water and minimal electrical grid for communications and station lighting.|$|R
