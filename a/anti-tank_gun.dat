5|$|The 37mm Gun M3 was {{the first}} {{dedicated}} <b>anti-tank</b> <b>gun</b> fielded by United States forces in numbers. Introduced in 1940, it became the standard <b>anti-tank</b> <b>gun</b> of the U.S. infantry with its size enabling it to be pulled by a jeep. However, the continuing improvement of German tanks quickly rendered the 37mm ineffective and, by 1943, it was being gradually replaced in the European and Mediterranean theaters by the more powerful British-developed 57 mm Gun M1. In the Pacific, where the Japanese tank threat was less significant, the M3 remained in service {{until the end of}} the war.|$|E
5|$|The T48 57mm Gun Motor Carriage was a {{self-propelled}} <b>anti-tank</b> <b>gun</b> {{produced by}} the Diamond T company in 1943 for the United States. The design incorporated a 57 mm gun M1, a US production of the British Ordnance QF 6 pounder, mounted on an M3 Half-track.|$|E
5000|$|The RPG has {{its roots}} in the 20th century with the early {{development}} of the explosive shaped charge, in which the explosive is made in a pointed cone shape, which concentrates its power on the impact point. Before the adoption of the shaped charge, <b>anti-tank</b> <b>guns</b> and tank guns relied primarily on kinetic energy of metal shells to defeat armor. As tank armor increased in thickness and effectiveness, the <b>anti-tank</b> <b>guns</b> needed to defeat them became increasingly heavy, cumbersome and expensive. During WW II, as tank armor got thicker, larger calibre <b>anti-tank</b> <b>guns</b> were developed. While larger <b>anti-tank</b> <b>guns</b> were more effective, the heaviness of these <b>anti-tank</b> <b>guns</b> meant that they increasingly were mounted on wheeled, towed platforms.|$|R
50|$|The 64th (QORGY) A-T Regt, R.A. was {{the first}} unit in the Italian {{campaign}} to be issued with the powerful 17 Pounder <b>anti-tank</b> <b>guns,</b> though some troops in the Regiment were later moved to M10 Self-Propelled 3in <b>Anti-Tank</b> <b>Guns.</b>|$|R
50|$|From the {{invention}} of tanks through to the Second World War, tank armour increased in thickness to resist the increasing size and power of <b>anti-tank</b> <b>guns.</b> A tank with sufficient armour could resist the largest <b>anti-tank</b> <b>guns</b> then in use.|$|R
5|$|At around 13:00, {{tanks of}} the Panzer-Lehr Division {{advanced}} into Villers-Bocage unsupported by infantry. Four Panzer IVs tried to enter {{from the south}} near a wrecked Panzer IV and two were knocked out by anti-tank fire. Some Tigers were brought up and, in an exchange of fire, silenced the anti-tank position. Möbius divided the primary counter-attack down the main highway through Villers-Bocage and through the southern section of town parallel to the main road, to secure the town centre. The Tigers advanced slowly to intimidate the British into withdrawing {{and ran into the}} British ambush. The Firefly opened fire on the lead tank and missed but the <b>anti-tank</b> <b>gun</b> knocked it out. A group of three Tigers split up and drove through the back streets to flank the British; one was engaged by an <b>anti-tank</b> <b>gun</b> and destroyed, the other two were engaged with PIATs, one was knocked out and the other immobilised.|$|E
5|$|Fearing {{that the}} U.S. troops {{were on the}} verge of {{breaking}} through their defenses, Hyakutake's 17th Army headquarters hurriedly sent whatever troops could be found on-hand to bolster the 4th Infantry's defensive efforts. The troops included the 2d <b>Anti-Tank</b> <b>Gun</b> Battalion with 12 guns and the 39th Field Road Construction Unit. These two units took position in pre-prepared fighting emplacements around the south and west of Point Cruz.|$|E
5|$|The Sd.Kfz. 10 (Sonderkraftfahrzeug - special {{motorized}} vehicle) was a German half-track {{that saw}} widespread use in World War II. Its main role {{was as a}} prime mover for small towed guns such as the 2 cm FlaK 30, the 7.5 cm leIG, or the 3.7 cm PaK 36 <b>anti-tank</b> <b>gun.</b> It could carry eight troops in addition to towing a gun or trailer.|$|E
50|$|In 2010, {{to honor}} the 65th anniversary of Victory in Great Patriotic War three tanks were {{installed}} {{in front of the}} monument: T-34-76, T-34-85, T-54/55, two <b>anti-tank</b> <b>guns</b> ZIS-2, and ZiS-3. Tanks and <b>anti-tank</b> <b>guns</b> participated in the liberation of Stalino.|$|R

25|$|<b>Anti-tank</b> <b>guns</b> {{continued}} {{to be used in}} a number of conflicts around the world, such as the Six Day War and the South African Border War. Soviet <b>anti-tank</b> <b>guns</b> in particular were exported to at least eighteen other countries after being retired from service and have {{continued to}} see action.|$|R
5|$|Defences were {{in place}} at both bridges. On {{the west bank of}} the Caen Canal bridge there were three machine-gun emplacements and on the east bank a machine-gun and an <b>anti-tank</b> <b>gun.</b> To their north were another three machine-guns and a {{concrete}} pillbox. An anti-aircraft tower equipped with machine-guns stood to the south. At the River Orne bridge, the eastern bank south of the bridge had a pillbox with anti-tank and anti-aircraft guns. To the north of the bridge were two machine-guns. Both bridges had sandbagged trench systems along the banks.|$|E
5|$|In late 1938, another PanzerI {{was sent}} to the Armament Factory of Seville in order to mount a 45mm gun, {{captured}} from a Soviet tank (a T-26 or BT-5). A second was sent sometime later in order to exchange the original armament for a 37-millimeter Maklen <b>anti-tank</b> <b>gun,</b> which had been deployed to Asturias in late 1936 on the Soviet ship A. Andreiev. It remains unknown to what extent these trials and adaptations were completed, although it is safe to assume neither adaptation was successful beyond the drawing board.|$|E
5|$|The 55th Infantry Division {{guarding}} Sedan {{had little}} time for combat training, as its time had been spent in construction work. The division consisted mainly of reservists, most of who were {{over the age of}} 30. Little attempt was made to improve the poor combat quality of the division. One officer, First Lieutenant Delas of the 1st Battalion 147th Fortress Infantry Regiment was arrested and confined for 15 days for ordering firing practice with a 25mm <b>anti-tank</b> <b>gun</b> in a nearby quarry.|$|E

5|$|The T48 {{originated}} from an Anglo-American requirement for a self-propelled 6-pounder <b>anti-tank</b> <b>gun.</b> The requirement {{was met by}} emplacing a 57mm gun M1 – the U.S. production version of the British Ordnance QF 6-pounder – {{in the rear of}} an M3 Half-track. The first production batch was ordered in April 1942. The Americans dropped their requirements because of the design of another tank destroyer, the M10. Afterwards, it was intended solely to be supplied overseas {{under the terms of the}} Lend-Lease Program; the T48 was never officially type-classified.|$|E
5|$|The tank used in {{the film}} is a {{modified}} M5A1 Stuart. It was purchased from the government of Peru about twelve years prior to filming and had already been used in several films. Among numerous modifications made for Tank Girl, the tank's 37mm <b>anti-tank</b> <b>gun</b> {{was covered with a}} modified flag pole to give the appearance of a 105mm gun. An entire 1969 Cadillac Eldorado was added onto the tank, with the rear section welded at the back and the fender welded to the front.|$|E
5|$|Wittmann drove towards Villers-Bocage {{and along}} the road, the Rifle Brigade troops {{attempted}} to reply with PIAT anti-tank weapons and a 6-pounder <b>anti-tank</b> <b>gun</b> but, as the Tiger drew closer, panic set in and the riflemen looked for cover. The brigade vehicles were set on fire by machine guns and high-explosive shells, but few casualties were inflicted. At {{the east end of}} Villers-Bocage, Wittmann engaged and knocked out three M5 Stuart light tanks of the 4th CLY Reconnaissance Troop.|$|E
50|$|The {{need for}} a large bore made HEAT rounds {{relatively}} ineffective in existing small-caliber <b>anti-tank</b> <b>guns</b> of the era. Germany worked around this with the Stielgranate 41, introducing a round that was placed over the end {{on the outside of}} otherwise obsolete 37 mm <b>anti-tank</b> <b>guns</b> to produce a medium-range low-velocity weapon.|$|R
50|$|The {{effective}} {{range of the}} 4.7 cm Pak(t) is 1000 to 1200 m with a maximum range of 1500 m. When attacking an enemy position equipped with <b>anti-tank</b> <b>guns</b> and artillery, namely near Mogilev and Rogachev, its rather tall superstructure presented a target for artillery and <b>anti-tank</b> <b>guns.</b> Thus the Panzerjäger is destroyed before it can get into action. When large shells explode close-by, shrapnel pierced the thin armor. Russian 4.5 cm <b>anti-tank</b> <b>guns</b> already penetrate at 1200 m range. The 1st Kompanie lost 5 out of the 10 vehicles (Kampffahrzeuge) in such actions, of which only two could be repaired.|$|R

5|$|Between 1934 and the mid-1940s, several {{variants}} of the Panzer I were designed, {{especially during the}} later years of its combat history. Because they were obsolescent from their introduction, incapable of defeating foreign armor, and outclassed by newer German tanks, the PanzerI chassis were increasingly adapted as tank destroyers and other variants. One of the best-known variants was the kleiner Panzerbefehlswagen ("small armoured command vehicle"), built on the Ausf. A and Ausf. B chassis—200 of these were manufactured. The Panzer I Ausf. B chassis was also used to build the German Army's first tracked tank destroyer, the Panzerjäger I. This vehicle was armed with a Czech 47-millimeter (1.85in) <b>anti-tank</b> <b>gun.</b>|$|E
5|$|Operation Heiderose was a {{significant}} success for the division, inflicting serious losses on the Partisans. More than 900 Partisans were killed and {{a large amount of}} equipment was captured: one <b>anti-tank</b> <b>gun,</b> two mortars, 22 machine guns, over 800 rifles and nearly 500,000 rounds of small arms ammunition. The division suffered 24 killed and over 150 wounded. Communist sources hold that the Partisans suffered serious losses, with the 12th Corps alone having 250 dead, wounded and missing. However, Partisan reports estimate that German losses were significantly larger than their own. Erich Braun was recommended for the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross but the recommendation was not supported, apparently due to disagreements between the divisional staff and Phleps that had occurred during the division's formation.|$|E
5|$|The British up-gunned the Sherman {{with their}} highly {{effective}} QF 17 pounder <b>anti-tank</b> <b>gun,</b> {{resulting in the}} Firefly; although {{this was the only}} Allied tank capable of dealing with all current German tanks at normal combat ranges, few (342) were available in time for the Normandy invasion. From D-Day {{to the end of the}} Normandy campaign, a further 550 Fireflies were built. A second British tank equipped with the 17pdr gun, the Cruiser Mk VIII Challenger, could not participate in the initial landings having to wait for port facilities to be ready to land. It was not until July 1944 that American Shermans, fitted with the 76-mm (3-inch) M1 tank gun, achieved a parity in firepower with the Panzer IV.|$|E

5|$|Wittmann briefed the Panzer-Lehr Division {{intelligence}} officer {{and was given}} a Schwimmwagen to return to Point 213. Kauffmann ordered Hauptmann Helmut Ritgen to block the northern exits of the town with 15 Panzer IV, mainly from 6th Company, 2nd Battalion Panzer-Lehr Regiment 130 and ten from a workshop south of Route Nationale 175. Ritgen rendezvoused with the Panzer-Lehr Division commanding officer, Generalleutnant Fritz Bayerlein, at Villy-Bocage. As Ritgen's tanks moved towards Villers-Bocage they ran into a British <b>anti-tank</b> <b>gun</b> screen and lost a tank. Four Panzer IVs entered the town {{from the south and}} the first two tanks were knocked out; the others withdrew.|$|E
5|$|As rations {{and water}} dwindled, {{unsuccessful}} {{attempts were made}} on 10 June to rescue {{the men in the}} stranded barge with support from artillery and aircraft. While Corsairs flew close support missions, Beaufort and Mitchell bombers dropped life rafts but the survivors were unable to reach them due to machine-gun fire. Further casualties occurred when, in the early morning of 11 June, a Japanese soldier managed to reach the vessel and fired upon the occupants with a machine-gun, killing two and wounding others before he was killed himself. Shortly after this a Japanese <b>anti-tank</b> <b>gun</b> fired two shells at the landing craft, destroying its stern. Further shots were prevented when Australian artillery ranged in on the gun, having been directed by Captain John Whitelaw, an artillery observer on one of two landing craft that had been despatched with canvas assault boats, crewed by engineers from the 16th Field Company.|$|E
5|$|For the Chemical Troops (Nebeltruppen) each {{decontamination}} battery (Entgiftungs-Batterie) {{was authorized}} six Sd.Kfz. 10/1 and six Sd.Kfz. 10/2. Eighteen Sd.Kfz. 10/3 {{were held at}} the battalion level for issue to the batteries in lieu of their Sd.Kfz. 10/2s if needed. If necessary they could be substituted for Sd.Kfz. 11s of the appropriate type. When the decontamination units were authorized to be re-equipped with heavy rocket launchers in November 1941 seven Sd.Kfz. 10/1s were used to tow the 28/32 cm Nebelwerfer 41 launchers and another {{was used by the}} platoon leader to tow an <b>anti-tank</b> <b>gun.</b> Similarly decontamination units usually retained their Sd.Kfz. 10/2s and used them just like the 10/1s after removing their special equipment. However, it seems that the 10/3s were turned in when the unit was reorganized.|$|E
