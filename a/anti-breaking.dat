40|$|Glycation {{consists}} in formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGE) during non-enzymatic reaction between reducing sugars and proteins, lipids or nucleic acids. This review is focused mainly on glycation of collagen {{and its role}} in acceleration of vascular disease. Collagen is an extracellular matrix protein characterized by unique structure forming fibrils with great anti-tensile and <b>anti-breaking</b> strength. The protein builds the connective tissue and is responsible for biomechanical properties of blood vessels. It is reported that higher content of glycated collagen correlates with lower elasticity and greater toughness of the vessel walls and, as a consequence, a faster rate of atherosclerosis development. Numerous mechanisms connected with AGE formation are involved in atherogenesis, among others: receptor-mediated production of free radicals, triggering an inflammatory process, activation of leukocytes and thrombocytes, facilitation of LDL binding, change in level of growth factors, adhesion molecules, MMP and some other proteinsâ€™ expression. The coverages allow the development of therapeutic strategies to prevent or slow down the pathological processes connected with glycation of collagen and other proteins in the artery wall. The main strategies are based on limitation of exogenous AGE, consumption of products which contain rutin, treatment with drugs which inhibit AGE formation, such aspyridoxamine, and chemicals which are able to cleave already formed AGE protein-protein crosslinks, such as ALT- 711...|$|E
40|$|The soil {{aggregate}} {{stability is}} a key property of soil quality and reflects soil quality and anti-erosion ability. The transition matrix between initial and final aggregates condition was established by modifying Niewczas and Witkowska-Walczak's method by not considering the artificial weights and each size of aggregates fraction {{on the basis of}} three reasonable assumptions, and soil aggregate stability index (ASI) was formed through preserving each size of aggregates probability. This ASI is identical to the result by reference, and the transition matrix can be showed to evaluate the soil aggregates stability. Using the transition matrix was furthermore to analyze <b>anti-breaking</b> ability of different size aggregate by reference material. We found there were different effects for each size aggregate by four methods, simulation rainfall, one cycle of wettingdrying, ten cycles of wettingdrying, and Yoder wettingsieving. The Yoder wettingsieving is a severe method that destructed soil aggregates. The ASI by modifying transition matrix method was used to evaluate the aggregates stability under different land utilization in Karst region in Chongqing, China. The ASI of agricultural utilization was lower than abounded cultivated land, shrub-grass land, secondary forest land, and primeval forest land. For some selected soil properties, when SOM content was 60 ?g/kg, the ASI was almost unchanged. The sorption moisture content of air-drying acutely affected ASI too, and the ASI increased along the sorption moisture increasing. SOM content and sorption markedly affected the preserving probability of larger aggregates such as 105, 53, 32, 21, and 10. 5 ?mm size class. Although CaCO 3 and clay content did not influence preserving probability of each size class of aggregates fiercely, but the influence on small aggregates was higher than that of larger aggregates. The modified transition matrix method could not only calculate soil aggregates stability index, but also analyze more parameters of aggregate experiment, and bring out the each size aggregates characteristics. Thus, the modified transition matrix method could be a better tool to understand soil quality.
