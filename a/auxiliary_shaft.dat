In a multiengine aircraft an interruption may be acceptable for a few moments but for an aircraft that is required to fly a long distance, it would be necessary for the gearbox to drive an addition electrical generator for back up reasons. Thus, duplication of electrical power generators leads to difficulties in positioning the gearbox and heavy modifications to the gearbox.|$|E

The part on which water flowed is barely corroded, whereas the moist part near the pouring joints is seriously corroded. We first studied the mechanism of this phenomenon by chromatography, X-ray diffraction, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. We then used simplified models built by particle flow code software (i. e., particle flow code in three dimensions, PFC 3 D) to analyse how increasing degradation depth affects compressive strength and failure patterns. The results were as follows. (1) Gypsum and calcite in corrosive water were supersaturated. The part on which water flowed was protected by the crystallized precipitation on the concrete. By contrast, the degradation of the part where water flowed through pouring joints was aggravated by internal crystallization and dissolution. (2) PFC 3 D numerical simulation indicated that decreases in vertical ultimate stress were strongly linearly correlated with degradation depth. As for the − 355. 5 m damaged part, reinforcement should be conducted before degradation depth reaches 250 mm. (3) No obvious signs were observed prior {{to the failure of}} the corroded sidewall.

40|$|International audienceThe silver mines of Laurion {{were the}} most {{important}} mining district of ancient Greece during the fifth and fourth centuries BC. These mineral resources highly contributed to the power of Athens. Even today, mining, ore dressing and metallurgical remains cover about 120 km 2. We focused on the most obvious traces left by the ancient miners in Laurion, namely the figure of the deep vertical shafts. In {{the southern part of the}} district, 4 km SW of Lavrio, fifteen shafts sinked in the Spitharopoussi plateau have been studied. They constitute the whole inventory of shafts in a given area. Among them, twelve are major deep shafts (65. 6 m in average, 101. 5 m for the deepest). One wonders how miners were able to breathe at such a depth. The location of the shaft heads, on the plateau surface, in roughly horizontal field, has only low level variations. According to the regularity of the geological structure, all these shafts are mainly open in the marbles of the Kamareza unit (Rosenthal and al. in this conference) with a broadly rectangular shaped section (average size : 1. 35 m x 1. 64 m). Subsequent field surveys and meteorological data, indicate uniform climatic conditions with the same distribution of wind directions. At ground level, against all the odds, the straight sections of shafts are not oriented according to the direction of prevailing winds, for the purpose of ventilation; their orientation depends on the natural slope. This gives a clue that a particular plan was followed in the arrangement of surface hoisting workshops. These shafts revealed heterogeneous characteristics : different depths, twisted sections, traces of notches on the sides. They also revealed different techniques of ventilation for deep workings that could have been applied at different times. In three cases, an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>shaft</b> was located closed to the main one; both are connected by one or more galleries (twin shafts or parallel shaft in literature). For the others, did the ancient miners take advantage of continuous blowing winds over the plateau to direct airflow into the depth, using different kinds of deflectors ?

40|$|Being {{particularly}} critical components, the serviceability {{of rolling}} element bearings is usually {{essential for the}} machines operation. They {{have been the subject}} of research for more than a 100 years. The work of this manuscript investigates two aspects of rolling element bearings. Firstly, the dynamic behaviour of a rolling element bearing is analysed. The study emphasises the influence of the lubricant film on the bearing dynamics. Secondly, the lifetime of the bearing is analysed. The study discusses the influence of external dynamic loads on the lubricant film formation and wear of the raceway surfaces. The bearing dynamics and lifetime are experimentally analysed using an innovative and versatile test rig. The first contribution of the current work consists of the development of this test rig. The test rig is designed and constructed in-house and characterised by three unique features. Firstly, the test rig allows easy adjustment to test different types and sizes of rolling element bearings. The test bearing is mounted in a modular structure consisting of an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>shaft</b> and an intermediate sleeve. Secondly, the test rig allows applying a multi-axial static and dynamic load on the test bearing. The bearing load is controlled in both the radial and axial direction and has a static and dynamic component in both directions. Thirdly, the test rig allows simultaneous measurement of the bearing motion, the bearing dynamics and the behaviour of the lubricant film. Relations between the different measurements can be derived experimentally. The radial, axial and tilt motion are measured free from disturbances of the surrounding structure. The bearing dynamics are identified in a frequency range below the resonances of the surrounding structures flexible modes. The behaviour of the lubricant film is analysed based on the electrical resistance through the bearing. In the current study, a single row deep groove ball bearing is used as a test bearing. The bearing motion, the behaviour of the lubricant film and cage slip are analysed for different operational conditions of the bearing. The three properties are derived using techniques which can be applied in most rotating machinery: measurement of the radial bearing displacement and the electrical resistance through the bearing. Clear trends w. r. t. the bearing load, temperature and speed are obtained. Clean analysis of the bearing motion and cage slip further proves precise operation of the test rig. The electrical resistance reveals the formation of the lubricant film during a run-up of the bearing speed. Estimation of the lubricant film thickness based on the electrical resistance is validated using an analytical model. Exploring the possibilities to easily and accurately identify the properties is the second contribution of this work. Accurate knowledge on the bearing dynamic properties is essential during the design of many rotating machinery. They determine the machines critical speeds, the forces acting on the different components, etc. This work investigatestwo dynamic properties of the test bearing: the radial stiffness and damping in the direction of the static load. Variation of the bearing temperature reveals the influence of the lubricants viscosity on the identified stiffness and damping. Variation of the bearing speed reveals the influence of the film formation on the identified stiffness and damping. In the literature, no experimental measurements showing the relations between the behaviour of the lubricant film and the dynamic properties are reported. Revealing these relations is the third contribution of the current study. The results help to evaluate the significance of modelling the lubricant film when numerically analysing the vibrations of a bearing system. Precise prediction of the lifetime of rolling element bearings is a crucial step towards a reliable design of many rotating machines. For bearings subjected to highly varying loads, a strong reduction of the actual bearing lifetime w. r. t. the classically calculated bearing lifetime is observed. This work investigates the effect of external dynamic loads on the lubricant film formation and surface wear of the test bearing. When introducing a radial or axial excitation on the bearing, the lubricant film thickness follows the imposed variations of the load. An increase of metallic contact or breakdown of the lubricant film is not detected. Under axial excitation, sliding motion between asperities of the contacting surfaces in the bearing does occur. Accelerated lifetime tests under high axial dynamic load reveal polishing of the raceway honing structure. This polishing is clearly observed on SEM images of the inner raceway after a test duration of only 0. 5 % of the calculated L 10 life. Analysis of the lubricant film behaviour under dynamic load is not described in the current literature and is considered to be the fourth contribution of this work. Finally, the study promotes further research to analyse surface wear due to external dynamic loads. status: publishe...|$|E
5000|$|A simple 90° V6 cannot {{achieve the}} same {{smoothness}} with only crankshaft counterweights, and if the 90° V6 uses shared crankpins like the V8, the engine will have uneven firing intervals, {{such as in the}} original [...] "odd-fire" [...] Buick V6 engine.

40|$|The {{hypocycloid}} mechanism, in {{its basic}} or modified version, {{can be used}} in reciprocating machines as an alternative solution to the conventional crankshaft-connecting rod system. This kinematic device is quite old in concept, but still gives rise to some research since it has some positive mechanical features, and it allows several functions to be easily combined. In the hypocycloid mechanism in fact the connecting rod has a perfectly sinusoidal straight-line motion, a characteristic that theoretically reduces the piston side thrust to zero and permits a perfect balance of inertia forces without <b>auxiliary</b> rotating <b>shafts.</b> Moreover, by means of a second head with suitable seals that prevent leakage to the crankcase, the lower portion of the cylinder {{can be used as a}} second working chamber without using the crosshead thus reducing the dimensions of the double acting machine.

40|$|Meuse/Haute-Marne {{underground}} {{research laboratory}} is {{installed in a}} region rated at very low seismic hazard for obvious safety reasons. No earthquake of magnitude greater than 3. 5 has been reported or identified {{in the area of}} interest through historical evidence or records. There are nevertheless a few active faults over the 60 km distance range whose induced traveling vibrations can be detected. Known historical earthquakes (primarily in the Vosges mountainous region) showed a magnitude between 3 and 6 (Brulhet, 2005). Even if the seismic waves, as a transient mechanical input, are of very low levels, it is of interest to characterize their amplitudes in the laboratory to find out if they may have some influence on the design of underground installations. Another issue is to know whether or not seismic waves are amplified or attenuated according to depth and the lithology of the geological overburden. It is known that seismic ground-motion is generally stronger at the surface than underground. For shallow underground structures, Power et al (1996) have estimated the ratio between the maximum acceleration and the surface at different depths; they observed that it decreased by 10 % every 15 meters. This result cannot be generalized since it depends largely on the geological setting. More recently Aydan et al (2009) compared the acceleration of the earthquake in L'Aquila in Italy (6. 3 magnitude) between a surface station and a station located at the Underground Physics Laboratory at Gran Sasso, 1400 m depth. In this case, the maximum acceleration of the surface wave was found to be more than 6 times higher than in the deep gallery. This amplification is due mainly to the interface between soil and atmosphere, where the bulk waves are largely reflected or refracted and while surface waves (Love or Rayleigh waves) are dominant. There are also site effects that amplify the wave amplitude especially in the superficial sedimentary layers. Furthermore, for the same wave, the amplitude of ground motion is inversely proportional to the stiffness of the rock strata. Vibration amplitude in a deep underground structure in a hard competent rock is expected to be lower than in a soft loosened rock. To highlight those phenomenons, a monitoring network composed of three-components accelerometric stations is installed in the laboratory with a frequency range of 0. 1 Hz- 100 Hz. The network layout consists of a surface station, a station - 254 m deep located in the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>shaft</b> (in the limestones of the oxfordian superior), a station in the experimentation gallery - 445 m deep (in the mudstones of the oxfordian medium) and finally a station at the main level - 490 m deep in the host layer of the oxfordian inferior (Figure 1). The largest acceleration recorded was measured during the earthquake of Besançon the 23 rd april 2004 (magnitude 5. 5 and 150 km distant) on the station of surface with a peak ground acceleration of 0. 02 m. s- 2. Since this earthquake, only 1 or 2 earthquakes per year are recorded with a peak acceleration exeeding the 0. 0005 m. s- 2 triggering threshold. Despite the very low rate of detection, their analysis on the different station of the network shows a systematic amplification of their amplitude and energy on the surface station {{and to a lesser extent}} at the mean level - 490 m. It is the station in the shaft (- 254 m) that measures the lowest solicitation. In parallel, a field study to characterize rock damping properties has been undertaken from data coming from both a temporary accelerometric network and three vertical seismic profiles in deep boreholes located in the neighborhoods. As regards the temporary accelerometric network, data analysis was based on the H/V method that compares the spectrum of the vertical component of the seismic signal with the spectrum of the horizontal components (Nakamura, 1989). H/V Measurements of recorded earthquakes have highlighted a likely weak site effect on the surface with a dominant frequency of 2. 5 Hz and corresponding to a the 125 m thick Kimmeridgian marl geological layer overlying to the underground laboratory. If the absolute amplitude of this site effect could not be determined from this preliminary study, it could be estimated with the analysis of the recorded waveforms on the regional stations. Variations in the attenuation properties of seismic waves through the rock cover were estimated from the data of 3 vertical seismic profiles. These show a consistent trapping like effect of waves in the layers with low seismic impedance. This result should however take into account the change in the frequency range for a direct transposition of the seismic sources (14 to 140 Hz) to the characteristics of earthquakes (1 - 7 Hz). This result calls for further investigations and numerical modeling to specifically quantify its influence. Le laboratoire de recherche souterrain de Meuse/Haute-Marne a été installé dans une zone asismique pour des raisons évidentes. Il y a néanmoins des failles actives à moins de 200 km dont les vibrations peuvent être ressenties.

Dans ce but, un dispositif avec 4 stations accélérométriques 3 composantes a donc été installé à différentes profondeurs dans le laboratoire en liaison avec le CENARIS...|$|E
40|$|Increased {{activity}} at ports {{is an indication}} of economic development and growth; however, it also puts public health, regional air quality and global climate at risk because the exhaust from the marine diesel engines is not subjected to the stringent regulations as on-road engines. This dissertation characterizes the effectiveness of strategies and technologies to mitigate criteria pollutants and the long-lived greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide (CO 2) from marine diesel engines. The dissertation also provides insight into the current state-of-art of gaseous and particulate matter portable emission measurement system (PEMS). Results from a project show how to determine the measurement allowance for PEMS in order to provide accurate measurements for the development of emission inventories and subsequently, air pollution mitigating regulations. In-use gaseous emissions from the two main engines were measured at sea {{for the first time in}} order to evaluate the performance of a Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) compliant PEMS against instruments meeting the simplified measurement method (SMM) complaint with International Maritime Organization (IMO). For the first time, emissions were measured from a modern container vessel with newest engine technologies. The vessel was operated on marine gas oil, a cleaner fuel, in regulated waters and on heavy fuel oil in unregulated waters. Impact of cleaner fuel and newest technologies on the engine was assessed. A simple equation was developed to estimate time required to completely switch fuels which can be used by vessel owners to comply with regional/international fuel regulations. Vessel speed reduction (VSR), which is a worldwide acceptable strategy for ocean-going vessels (OGVs), was evaluated. The study showed that putting a speed limit on a container OGVs as they sail near ports and coastlines could cut emissions of air pollutants by up to 70 %. This study also found that by reducing the vessel speed by a mere 3 - 6 knots from cruise speed will result in significant reductions of criteria pollutants and carbon dioxide. Towards the goal of reducing emissions and dependency on fossil fuels, this dissertation explores benefits of consuming hydrotreated algae biofuel in small marine diesel engines for the first time. Significant particulate matter (PM 2. 5) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) benefits were reported with slight improve in fuel economy when fuel was switched from ultra low sulfur diesel (ULSD) to 50 : 50 blend of ULSD and algae fuels. The dissertation investigates the benefits associated with the hybridization of the tugboat. A conventional tugboat was retrofitted with one <b>auxiliary</b> engine, <b>shaft</b> generators, addition of lithium polymer batteries and an energy management system. Up to 30 % reduction in NOx, PM 2. 5 and CO 2 was found. The energy management system in the hybrid tugboat allows the use of the auxiliary engine for propulsion as opposed to the only main engines during transit mode, thus leading to the significant reductions. Another section of this dissertation provides an evaluation of latest PM-PEMS under different environmental and in-use conditions and features performance, accuracy and precision of PM-PEMS compared to the gravimetric reference method. The research from this study shows current PM-PEMS typically underreport the PM emissions compared to the reference method, with the exception of PEMS with photo-acoustic technology which incorporated a gravimetric filter.
