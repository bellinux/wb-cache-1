Design. Cross-sectional study. Setting. Routine antenatal care in six European countries. Population. In total 6923 pregnant women. Methods. Cross-tabulation and Pearson’s chi-square was used to study prevalence and characteristics for women reporting <b>abuse</b> <b>in</b> healthcare. Associations with selected obstetric factors were estimated using multiple logistic regression analysis. Main outcome measures. <b>Abuse</b> <b>in</b> healthcare, fear of childbirth and preference for birth by cesarean section. Results. One in five pregnant women attending routine antenatal care reported some lifetime <b>abuse</b> <b>in</b> healthcare. Prevalence varied significantly between the countries. Characteristics for women reporting <b>abuse</b> <b>in</b> healthcare included a significantly higher prevalence of other forms of abuse, economic hardship and negative life events as well as a lack of social support, symptoms of post-traumatic stress and depression. Among nulliparous women, <b>abuse</b> <b>in</b> healthcare was associated with fear of childbirth, adjusted odds ratio 2. 25 (95 % CI 1. 23 – 4. 12) for severe <b>abuse</b> <b>in</b> healthcare.

Abir was only involved with primary resource gathering and, despite being owned by European industrialists, operated in a style similar to warlords such as Tippu Tip. Abir was supported in its operations by the Free State which required the enormous profits generated to strengthen its control over the country during its formative years. The concession companies gave the Free State the time and revenue required to secure the Congo and to plan a long-term and more stable program of colonisation. Abir ultimately failed as its harvesting process valued high production over sustainability and it doomed to live out its own boom and bust cycle. Despite this the Abir production model {{was used by the}} French government as the basis for its concession system in the French Congo.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} whether dimensions of attachment (close, depend, anxiety) {{and social support}} would significantly contribute {{to the prediction of}} abuse across three generations. Generation three (G 3) consisted of adult children (82 males and 98 females) while generation two (G 2) consisted of their parents (89 males and 161 females). Both groups served as the pivotal reporters responding to questionnaires regarding parental spouse abuse and child abuse, G 2 child <b>abuse,</b> <b>abuse</b> <b>in</b> their own intimate relationships, attachment, and social support. Regression analyses were conducted to assess the extent to which: child and spouse <b>abuse</b> <b>in</b> generation one (G 1) would predict partner <b>abuse</b> <b>in</b> G 3 and whether the inclusion of G 3 attachment and social support would add to this prediction; child and spouse <b>abuse</b> <b>in</b> G 1 would predict child and spouse <b>abuse</b> <b>in</b> G 2 and whether G 2 attachment and social support when included would contribute to this prediction; child and spouse <b>abuse</b> <b>in</b> G 2 would predict partner <b>abuse</b> <b>in</b> G 3 and whether G 2 and G 3 attachment and social support would add to the prediction; child and spouse <b>abuse</b> <b>in</b> G 1 and G 2 would predict partner <b>abuse</b> <b>in</b> G 3 and whether the inclusion of G 2 and G 3 attachment and social support would add to this prediction. For G 2 women, ability to feel comfortable with closeness and maternal child abuse predicted spouse <b>abuse</b> <b>in</b> their own intimate relationships. Additionally, G 2 women 2 ̆ 7 s anxiety about being abandoned and their ability to depend on others predicted <b>abuse</b> <b>in</b> their children 2 ̆ 7 s intimate relationships. Furthermore, the extent to which G 2 women felt they could depend on others solely predicted <b>abuse</b> <b>in</b> their offspring 2 ̆ 7 s intimate relationships when G 1 and G 2 variables were considered together. However, only paternal and maternal child abuse predicted child abuse for G 2 women. For G 2 men, paternal child abuse and parental spouse abuse predicted child abuse while parental spouse <b>abuse</b> predicted <b>abuse</b> <b>in</b> their own intimate relationships.

The archives of the Soviet Ministries of Internal Affairs (MVD) and Health (USSR Health Ministry), and of the Serbsky Institute for Forensic Psychiatry, which between them hold evidence about the expansion of psychiatry and the regulations governing that expansion, remain totally closed to researchers, says Gushansky. Dan Healey shares his opinion that the abuses of Soviet psychiatry under Stalin and, even more dramatically, in the 1960s to 1980s remain under-researched: {{the contents of the}} main archives are still classified and inaccessible. Hundreds of files on people who underwent forensic psychiatric examinations at the Serbsky Institute during Stalin's time are on the shelves of the highly classified archive in its basement where Gluzman saw them in 1989.

5|$|In 2009, the {{university}} {{responded to a}} series of New York Times interviews that showed a pattern of labor <b>abuses</b> <b>in</b> its fledgling Abu Dhabi location, creating a statement of labor values for Abu Dhabi campus workers. A 2014 follow-up article found that while some conditions had improved, contractors for the multibillion-endowment university were still frequently subjecting their workers to third-world labor conditions. The article documented that these conditions included confiscation of worker passports, forced overtime, recruitment fees and cockroach-filled dorms where workers had to sleep under beds. According to the article, workers who attempted to protest the NYU contractors' conditions were promptly arrested. Reports also claimed that those arrested by police were later abused at the police station. Many workers who were not local were then deported to their home countries. The university quickly responded to the reports with an apology to the workers. In 2015, NYU compensated thousands of migrant workers on its Abu Dhabi complex.|$|E
5|$|In January 1908, Sheppard {{published}} {{a report on}} colonial <b>abuses</b> <b>in</b> the American Presbyterian Congo Mission (APCM) newsletter, and both he and Morrison were sued for libel against the Kasai Rubber Company (Compagnie de Kasai), a prominent Belgian rubber contractor in the area.

The judge acquitted Sheppard (Morrison had been acquitted earlier on a technicality) {{on the premise that}} his editorial had not named the major company, but smaller charter companies instead. However, {{it is likely that the}} case was decided in favor of Sheppard as a result of international politics; the U.S., socially in support of the missionaries, had questioned the validity of King Leopold II's rule over the Congo.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} from the 1960-s to 1986, the abuse of {{psychiatry}} for political purposes {{was reported to have}} been systematic in the Soviet Union and episodic in other Eastern European countries such as Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia. The practice of incarceration of political dissidents in mental hospitals in Eastern Europe and the former USSR damaged the credibility of psychiatric practice in these states and entailed strong condemnation from the international community. Psychiatrists have been involved in human rights <b>abuses</b> <b>in</b> states across the world when the definitions of mental disease were expanded to include political disobedience. As scholars have long argued, governmental and medical institutions have at times classified threats to authority during periods of political disturbance and instability as a form of mental disease.

40|$|Sexual <b>abuse</b> <b>in</b> prisoni is {{a global}} human rights crisis. In many cases, the {{perpetrators}} are prison staff, the very people responsible for keeping inmates safe.

It is the absolute responsibility of government to protect the safety of inmates. Sexual <b>abuse</b> <b>in</b> prison, regardless of the perpetrator, represents a government’s failure to uphold this responsibility. In most countries, there are no official studies on the prevalence of sexual <b>abuse</b> <b>in</b> prison, and few inmates come forward to report that they have been abused.

This {{analysis}} also covers how <b>abuse</b> <b>in</b> health care {{is different from the}} related concepts of medical error, patient satisfaction and personal identity threat. Background:  <b>Abuse</b> <b>in</b> health care is an emerging concept in need of a clear analysis and definition. At the same time, boundaries to the related concepts are not demarcated. Design:  Concept analysis as developed by Walker and Avant. Method:  The databases Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Medline, and Google Scholar were used to obtain articles published between 1997 and 2009. A total of eleven articles are referred to on <b>abuse</b> <b>in</b> health care, four on medical error, six on patient satisfaction and three on personal identity threat. Results:  <b>Abuse</b> <b>in</b> health care is defined by patients’ subjective experiences of encounters with the health care system, characterized by devoid of care, where patients suffer and feel they lose their value as human beings. The events are most often unintended. We also found differences with the aforementioned related concepts: medical error does not share the patients’ perspective, and patient satisfaction does not offer room for patients’ abusive experiences. The concept of personal identity threat shares all attributes with <b>abuse</b> <b>in</b> health care, but it lacks an antecedent that signifies the social structures underlying the phenomenon. Conclusions:  <b>Abuse</b> <b>in</b> health care covers a phenomenon that has severe consequences but is invisible if seen from a medical error or patient satisfaction perspective...|$|R
