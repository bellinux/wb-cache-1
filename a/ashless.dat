Advantages of this approach as well as potential applications which could {{have an impact on the}} design, manufacture, and performance of existing and future automotive engines are presented and discussed. Tribopolymerization, a novel concept of molecular design developed by Furey and Kajdas, involves the continuous formation of thin polymeric films on rubbing surfaces; the protective films formed are self-replenishing. The antiwear compounds developed from this technology are effective with metals as well as ceramics and in the liquid as well as vapor phases. Furthermore, they are <b>ashless</b> and contain no harmful phosphorus or sulfur; and many are biodegradable. Thus, potential applications of this technology are diverse and include a variety of cost/performance/energy/environmental advantages. Examples include the following: (a) machining and cutting applications using thin films to reduce friction and ceramic tool wear; (b) the lubrication of ceramic engines (e. g., low heat rejection diesel engines) or ceramic components; (c) the development of <b>ashless</b> lubricants for existing and future automotive engines to reduce exhaust catalyst poisoning and environmental emissions; (d) <b>ashless</b> antiwear or ``lubricity`` additives for fuels, including gasoline, diesel and jet fuel; (e) vapor phase applications of this technology to high temperature gaseous systems or to fuel injector wear problems associated with the use of natural gas engines; and (f) the use of the concept of tribopolymerization as an enabling technology in the development of new engines and new automotive propulsion systems...|$|E

The results demonstrate that adding this synethesized additive even at a low amount (, 2. 0 wt. %) can evidently improve its load-carrying capacity by 1. 5 times and enhance its antiwear performance; in addition, the friction-reducing effect of additive in the high load was better than that in low load.

40|$|The {{reaction}} {{rate in the}} reaction of NO with an <b>ashless</b> carbon black was considerably enhanced {{in the presence of}} oxygen. A similar effect has also been observed in the reaction of NO with the oxidized carbon black. The creation of more active sites on the carbon surface in the reaction with oxygen and NO 2 (produced by the reaction of NO with O 2) is proposed to be responsible for this enhancement. A lower apparent activation energy was observed in the reaction of NO with the oxidized carbon black than with the unmodified carbon black. It was found that the adsorption of NO is restrained to some extent on the carbon black surface mostly covered by carbon–oxygen (C(O)) complexes. However, the adsorption of NO and the formation of products at ca. 40 °C were enhanced only when C(O) complexes of higher thermal stability were left on the surface.

40|$|Opposed-flow {{flame spread}} over solid fuels is a {{fundamental}} area of research in fire science. Typically combustion wind tunnels are used to generate the opposing flow of oxidizer against which a laminar flame spread occurs along the fuel samples. The spreading flame is generally embedded in a laminar boundary layer, which interacts with the strong buoyancy-induced flow to affect the mechanism of flame spread. In this work, two different approaches for creating the opposed-flow are compared. In the first approach, a vertical combustion tunnel is used where a thin fuel sample, thin acrylic or <b>ashless</b> filter paper, is held vertically along the axis of the test-section with the airflow controlled by controlling the duty cycles of four fans. As the sample is ignited, a flame spreads downward in a steady manner along a developing boundary layer. In the second approach, the sample is held in a movable cart placed in an eight-meter tall vertical chamber filled with air. As the sample is ignited, the cart is moved downward (through a remote-controlled mechanism) at a prescribed velocity.

40|$|Developing new {{technological}} solutions, such as use of lightweight materials, less harmful fuels, controlled {{fuel combustion}} processes or more efficient exhaust gas after-treatment, are possible {{ways to reduce}} the environmental impact of machines. Both the reduction of wear and the friction control are key issues for decreasing of energy losses, improving efficiency and increasing of the life-span of an engine. Dialkyldithiophosphates (DTPs) of different metals have been extensively used as multifunctional additives in lubricants to control friction and reduce wear in mechanical systems. Among these DTP-compounds, zinc dialkyldithiophosphates (ZnDTPs) are the most common additives used for more than 60 years. These additives form protective films on steel surfaces and, thus, control friction and reduce wear. However, ZnDTPs contain zinc and large amounts of phosphorus and sulphur, which are human health hazards and cause environmental pollution by degrading catalytic converters in automobiles. Therefore, replacement of ZnDTPs byzinc free compounds with reduced amounts of sulphur and phosphorus are urgently needed. Boron-containing compounds are known as corrosion inhibitors, antioxidants, friction modifiers and effective anti-wear additives either dissolved in oil or as an insoluble and inorganic borate salts dispersed in oil in the nanoparticulate form. These compounds are emerging as attractive replacements for the compounds already used as additives in lubricants. The focus of the present work is on the development and tribological investigations of new boron compounds as highperformance additives in lubricants. These should be <b>ashless</b> with significantly reduced amounts sulphur and phosphorus, which is favourable for the environment protection. The work was carried out in the following steps: (1) Synthesis of new additives; (2) Characterization of the additives with FTIR, (1 H, 13 C, 31 P, 11 B) NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis and thermal analysis (TG/DTG, DTA and QMS); (3) Tribological evaluation using four ball Tribometer; (4) Surface analysis using an optical profiler and Scanning Electron Microscopy coupled with X-ray Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (SEM/EDS). It was found that the novel boroncompounds have considerably better antiwear performance and higher stability of the coefficient of friction with time as compared with ZnDTP. These novel compounds are <b>ashless</b> with reduced amounts of sulphur and phosphorus. They also have excellent tribological properties, high thermal stability, good miscibility with oils and positive environmental issues which make them an attractive alternative to ZnDTP.

40|$|Surface {{radiometry}} is {{an established}} technique for noncontact temperature measurement of solids. We adapt this technique {{to the study}} of solid surface combustion where the solid fuel undergoes physical and chemical changes as pyrolysis proceeds, and additionally may produce soot. The physical and chemical changes alter the fuel surface emissivity, and soot contributes to the infrared signature in the same spectral band as the signal of interest. We have developed a measurement that isolates the fuel's surface emissions in the presence of soot, and determine the surface emissivity as a function of temperature. A commercially available infrared camera images the two-dimensional surface of <b>ashless</b> filter paper burning in concurrent flow. The camera is sensitive in the 2 to 5 gm band, but spectrally filtered to reduce the interference from hot gas phase combustion products. Results show a strong functional dependence of emissivity on temperature, attributed to the combined effects of thermal and oxidative processes. Using the measured emissivity, radiance measurements from several burning samples were corrected for the presence of soot and for changes in emissivity, to yield quantitative surface temperature measurements. Ultimately the results will be used to develop a full-field, non-contact temperature measurement that will be used in spacebased combustion investigations...|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of the reaction of NO with <b>ashless</b> carbon black was studied in detail. The differences between the amounts of oxygen and nitrogen measured and the calculated concentrations of oxygen and nitrogen suggest the formation of surface carbon–oxygen complexes C(O) and carbon–nitrogen complexes C(N). The dependence of the specific rate of reaction at its initial stage on temperature {{is different from that}} at steady state, pointing to different rate-determining steps for the two reaction regimes. The decomposition of surface complexes is suggested to be the rate-determining step for the reaction under steady-state conditions. This explains very well the measured zero reaction order with respect to NO. NO is proposed to adsorb parallel to the carbon black surface. The dissociation of the N–O bond leads to the formation of C(O) and C(N) complexes which are heterogeneous in structure. The adsorbed NO molecules are not stable on the carbon black surface at temperatures above 300 °C. The reaction of NO with carbon at higher temperatures results in the formation of more surface complexes with higher thermal stability.

Because of the environmental pollution and health hazards of these compounds, <b>ashless</b> compounds with reduced amounts of sulfur and phosphorus are desirable. This work reports on the synthesis, characterization, and tribological properties of {{a new class of}} compounds, alkylborate-dithiophosphates. This class combines two high-iron-affinity surface active groups, borate and dialkydithiophosphate, into a single molecule. The final products, viscous liquids, were characterized by FT-IR, multinuclear (13) C, (13) P, and (13) B NMR spectroscopy and thermal analyses. Residues of one representative compound from this class, DPB-EDTP, after thermal analyses were additionally characterized by multinuclear (13) C, (31) P and (11) B MAS and (31) P CP/MAS NMR spectroscopy.

Host preference in lyctines is determined by some features like vessel size, moisture and starch content of the targeted host.

This study discusses the effects of nutritional quality of diets on oviposition of Lyctus africanus after feeding with cellulose-, cellulose powder (CP) and alpha cellulose (AC), and wood-based diets. Oviposition test was conducted on quantitative <b>ashless</b> filter papers which served as oviposition sites. The filter papers had been impregnated with nutritive solution and water to attract females laying their eggs. Those oviposition sites were put separately into a plastic jar with 10 pairs of lyctines adult. Then the eggs number and survived adults after two weeks were observed. The results showed that lyctine adults emerged from the cellulose-based diets ovipositing more eggs significantly on nutritive solution- than water-impregnated filter papers. This result may confirm that starch and sugar are the vital nutrients for L. africanus which could attract adult females to lay their eggs. The cellulose-based diets, both CP- and AC-based diet, are likely to affect adult stage of L. africanus to be more fecund by laying more eggs on filter papers. Also, CP-based diet generated the adults with higher survivals after ovipositing the eggs on both nutritive content and water-impregnated filter paper. The diet composition, in the case of cellulose content, is thus suggested to influence the fecundity of the adult insects of L. africanus...|$|E

Twenty two sites were surveyed by electric fishing between June 11 th and July 11 th 1996. Information was gathered on the presence and density of fish populations in the river catchment, and analysed according to the National Fisheries Classification Scheme in order to determine how these populations compare nationally with sites of similar habitat features. From this report, recommendations were made to improve and develop the fishery potential in relation to water quality and habitat prioritising areas classed as being <b>Ashless.</b> It was recommended that juvenile coarse fish should be stocked in the Houghton Bottoms area. This area has excellent fishery habitat and was found to contain a minor coarse fish population. Water quality in this stretch of river was thought to be good enough to establish a major coarse fish population. Fish were introduced {{for the first time in}} 1998 at Houghton Bottoms from the Agency's Leyland Fish Farm. 3000 each of Roach, Chub and Dace were introduced. Further fish introductions occurred in 2000 with the stocking of 1000 Chub, again from the Agency's Leyland Fish Farm in the Lower Darwen and Witton areas of the main river on a trial basis...|$|E

In this thesis, the decomposition rate of a standard material (cellulose) is assessed for three types of wetlands, which differ in water regime. The study took place at two localitites of marginal wetlands with standing water (Mokré louky near Třeboň, Záblatské louky), two floodplain localities (Brouskův mlýn and Hamerské louky) and two peatbog localities (intact and mined parts of Červené blato, respectively). The intensity of decomposition processes was compared among the sites using the method of cellulose bags. The bags were made from nylon nets, each was divided into five pockets and a cellulose strip was inserted in each pocket. A filter paper was used as the cellulose. These bags were placed vertically into the soil profile so that the upper sample was lying on the surface and the lowest was at the depth of 25 cm below the surface. At each locality four places were randomly selected and four replicate bags with cellulose were placed on each of them. In total 96 bags were put in place, which makes 480 cellulose samples. Two experiments, differing in length of exposition, were carried out in 2013. The samples were taken from the field sites after three and five weeks of exposure (experiment No. 1 and 2, respectively). In both experiments, the decrease in ash-free dry matter was the highest at Hamerské louky. The lowest decrease in ash-free dry matter was in the mined part of Červené blato peatbog. In the second experiment the decrease of the <b>ashless</b> dry matter was more noticable, which was caused by the prolonged exposure. The lowest decrease of ash-free dry matter was found in depths of 0 - 10 cm below the soil surface at all the sites...|$|E
40|$|The Solid Surface Combustion Experiment (SSCE) was {{the first}} {{combustion}} experiment to fly in the space shuttle and the first such experiment in the NASA spaceflight program since Skylab. SSCE was actually a series of experiments designed to begin to characterize flame spreading over solid fuels in microgravity and the differences of this flame spreading from normal gravity behavior. These experiments should lead {{to a better understanding}} of the physical processes involved [...] increasing our understanding of fire behavior, both in space and on Earth. SSCE results will help researchers evaluate spacecraft fire hazards. These experiments were conceived by the principal investigator, Professor Robert A. Altenkirch, Dean of Engineering at Washington State University. In the first five flights, the fuel sample [...] <b>ashless</b> filter paper instrumented with three thermocouples [...] was mounted in a sealed chamber filled with a 50 -percent or 35 -percent mixture of oxygen in nitrogen at pressures of 1. 0, 1. 5, and 2. 0 atm. In the next three flights, a polymethyl methacrylate (plexiglass) fuel was instrumented with three thermocouples and tested in a 70 -percent or 50 -percent mixture of oxygen and nitrogen at pressures of 1. 0 and 2. 0 atm. SSCE is a self-contained, battery-operated experiment that can be flown either in the shuttle middeck or in the Spacelab module. More information about the hardware configuration have been published. This past year, the final two of eight flights were completed on STS- 64 and STS- 63. The NASA Lewis Research Center designed and built the SSCE payload and performed engineering, testing, scientific, and flight operations support. The SSCE project was supported in some way by nearly every major sector of Lewis' organization. Professor Altenkirch developed a numerical simulation of the flame-spreading process from first principles (of fluid mechanics, heat transfer, and reaction kinetics). The spread rates, flame shape, and thermodynamic data from the SSCE flights are being compared directly with the results of the computational model. Results from the eight flights will be used to formulate an improved solid-phase pyrolysis model. In addition, some results of the flights have been published and presented at international combustion symposiums. Additional solid fuel combustion experiments are being investigated for future tests with the existing hardware...|$|E
40|$|A unique {{environment}} in which flame spreading, a phenomenon of fundamental, scientific interest, has importance to fire safety is that of spacecraft in which the gravitational acceleration is low {{compared with that of}} the Earth, i. e., microgravity. Experiments aboard eight Space Shuttle missions between October 1990 and February 1995 were conducted using the Solid Surface Combustion Experiment (SSCE) payload apparatus in an effort to determine the mechanisms of gas-phase flame spread over solid fuel surfaces {{in the absence of any}} buoyancy induced or externally imposed oxidizer flow. The overall SSCE effort began in December of 1984. The SSCE apparatus consists of a sealed container, approximately 0. 039 cu m, that is filled with a specified O 2 /N 2 mixture at a prescribed pressure. Five of the experiments used a thin cellulosic fuel, <b>ashless</b> filter paper, 3 cm wide x 10 cm long, 0. 00825 cm half-thickness, ignited in five different ambient conditions. Three of the experiments, the most recent, used thick polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) samples 0. 635 cm wide x 2 cm long, 0. 32 cm half-thickness. Three experiments, STS 41, 40 and 43, were designed to evaluate the effect of ambient pressure on flame spread over the thin cellulosic fuel while flights STS 50 and 47 were at the same pressure as two of the earlier flights but at a lower oxygen concentration in order to evaluate the effect of ambient oxygen level on the flame spread process at microgravity. For the PMMA flights, two experiments, STS 54 and 63, were at the same pressure but different oxygen concentrations while STS 64 was at the same oxygen concentration as STS 63 but at a higher pressure. Two orthogonal views of the experiments were recorded on 16 mm cine-cameras operating at 24 frames/s. In addition to filmed images of the side view of the flames and surface view of the burning samples, solid- and gas-phase temperatures were recorded using thermocouples. The experiment is battery powered and follows an automated sequence upon activation by the Shuttle Crew. In this study we separate the SSCE data into two groups according to the fuel type: (1) thin cellulose; and (2) thick PMMA. The experimental spread rates are compared with prediction from a number of models in an effort to uncover the important physics that characterize microgravity flame spread. Both steady and unsteady solutions are employed to explore the flame evolution, especially for thick fuels. Finally, the flame structure in downward spread is compared with the microgravity flame structure and modeling results to delineate the difference between the two configurations and the influence of normal gravity...|$|E
40|$|The {{study is}} an {{examination}} of the sediment loads and erosion rates of three small catchments in south-eastern Tasmania. Only that part of the load known as the wash load has been considered. Also, the suspension and solution load components of the wash load have been determined. The bed load has not been examined because of the absence of any accurate method for its determination. The previous literature on sediment yields is examined showing the dominance of work carried out in the United States of America in this field. Only a small number of studies have been carried out in Australia, with no previous studies in Tasmania. • A review of methods used in sediment studies revealed a wide range, many of which proved unsatisfactory for this study. The method used in this study, involving the use of <b>ashless</b> filters, was the most accurate known to the author {{at the time of the}} study although it is subject to some limitations. A description of the environment of the area is given. The landforms, geology, vegetation and climate of the three catchments are similar varying only in the proportions of each catchment which are made up of the various lithological and vegetational units. The wash load of the streams was sampled over a period of twelve months while the suspension and solution loads were examined for only - three months. From the information obtained sediment rating curves and daily sediment yields were determined. The computed daily sediment yields revealed the dominance of individual run-off episodes where up to 20 per cent of the annual load was removed in one episode. These episodes were separated by long periods of basal flow when sediment transport was minimal. It also illustrated the importance of the solution load which made up 65 to 85 per cent of the total wash load. This high figure is due to some degree to the inability of the laboratory method to separate colloidal material from the solution load. The solution load was much more constant than total wash load with individual run-off episodes not being so dominant. The suspension load however was extremely concentrated in individual run-off episodes with only negligible transport during basal flows. Erosion rates were also determined ranging from 140 to 156 tons per square mile. These fall into a similar range to those found elsewhere in Australia. A linear relationship was found between erosion rates and rainfall in Australia. This contrasts with results obtained in America where erosion rates increased with rainfall to a maximum at 12 inches per annum and then decreased as rainfall increased. These differences are due to differences in vegetation with the American vegetation changing with climate while that in Australia is relatively constant. An examination of the influence of various catchments revealed significant relationships with lithology and vegetation. Erosion rates were greatest on sandstone and mudstone areas and lower from dolerite areas. Also, a greater proportion of the sandstone and mudstone was carried in suspension while the dolerite was transported in solution or colloidal suspension. Wash load was also greater from forest areas than from the other vegetational types. This is due to the lack of ground cover in the forest area...|$|E
