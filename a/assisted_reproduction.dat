5|$|In {{spite of}} these steps toward equal treatment, a legal flaw remained: if {{children}} were born within a lesbian marriage, the non-biological mother was not legally regarded as a parent; she still had to undergo the lengthy financial process of adoption. This right was granted to heterosexual couples (married or not), where a stepfather could declare his wife's children to be his without further process. On 7 November 2006, the Spanish Parliament amended the law on <b>assisted</b> <b>reproduction,</b> allowing the non-biological mother {{to be regarded as}} a parent alongside her female spouse who is the birth-mother.|$|E
5|$|With {{the signing}} into {{law of the}} Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 on 6 April 2015, {{same-sex}} couples {{have the ability to}} jointly adopt children and stepchildren, as well as be able to obtain parental recognition in <b>assisted</b> <b>reproduction</b> methods of child creation. On 18 January 2016, key provisions of the law (including spouses, stepparents, civil partners and cohabiting partners being able to apply to become guardians of a child or for custody) went into effect, following the signing of a commencement order by the Minister for Justice and Equality. Portions of the Act allowing for joint adoption have not yet come into effect.|$|E
25|$|Ontario, however, has no {{concrete}} regulations regarding PGD. Since 2011, the Ministry of Children and Youth Services in Ontario {{advocates for}} the development government-funded 'safe fertility' education, embryo monitoring and <b>assisted</b> <b>reproduction</b> services for all Ontarians. This government report shows that Ontario not only has indefinite regulations regarding <b>assisted</b> <b>reproduction</b> services like IVF and PGD, but also does not fund any of these services. The reproductive clinics that exist are all private and located only in Brampton, Markham, Mississauga, Scarborough, Toronto, London and Ottawa. In contrast, provinces such as Alberta and Quebec not only have more clinics, but have also detailed laws regarding <b>assisted</b> <b>reproduction</b> and government funding for these practices.|$|E

25|$|Embryo {{transfer}} {{refers to}} {{a step in the}} process of <b>assisted</b> <b>reproduction</b> in which embryos are placed into the uterus of a female with the intent to establish a pregnancy. This technique (which is often used in connection with in vitro fertilization (IVF)), may be used in humans or in animals, in which situations the goals may vary.|$|E
25|$|Female {{infertility}} may {{be overcome}} by <b>assisted</b> <b>reproduction</b> technology, particularly embryo transfer techniques. Male infertility caused by absence of the vas deferens may be overcome with testicular sperm extraction, collecting sperm cells directly from the testicles. If the collected sample contains too few sperm cells to likely have a spontaneous fertilization, intracytoplasmic sperm injection can be performed. Third party reproduction is also a possibility for women with CF. Whether taking antioxidants affects outcomes is unclear.|$|E
25|$|Due to 2012's {{national}} budget cuts, the AHR was removed. The regulation of <b>assisted</b> <b>reproduction</b> was then delegated to each province. This delegation provides provinces {{with a lot}} of leeway to do as they please. As a result, provinces like Quebec, Alberta and Manitoba have put almost the full costs of IVF on the public healthcare bill. Dr. Santiago Munne, developer of the first PGD test for Down's syndrome and founder of , saw these provincial decisions as an opportunity for his company to grow and open more Reprogenetics labs around Canada. He dismissed all controversies regarding catalogue babies and states that he had no problem with perfect babies.|$|E

Gender identity and intersex rights in Malta are of the highest standard in the world under the Gender Identity, Gender Expression And Sex Characteristics Act. Same-sex marriage has been legal since September 2017 and prior to that civil unions (which are equal to marriage in all but name, with the same rights and obligations including joint adoption rights) were enacted in April 2014. However <b>assisted</b> <b>reproduction</b> is pending and access to surrogacy is banned for all.

25|$|The {{black-footed ferret}} {{is an example}} of a species which {{benefits}} from strong reproductive science. A captive-breeding program was initiated in 1987, capturing 18 living individuals and using artificial insemination. This is one of the first examples of <b>assisted</b> <b>reproduction</b> contributing to conservation of an endangered species in nature. The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (USFWS), state and tribal agencies, private landowners, conservation groups, and North American zoos, have actively reintroduced ferrets back into the wild since 1991. Beginning in Shirley Basin in Eastern Wyoming, reintroduction expanded to Montana, 6 sites in South Dakota in 1994, Arizona, Utah, Colorado, Saskatchewan, Canada and Chihuahua, Mexico. The Toronto Zoo has bred hundreds, most of which were released into the wild. Several episodes of Zoo Diaries show aspects of the tightly controlled breeding. In May 2000, the Canadian Species at Risk Act listed the black-footed ferret as being an extirpated species in Canada. A population of 35 animals was released into Grasslands National Park in southern Saskatchewan on October 2, 2009, and a litter of newborn kits was observed in July 2010. Reintroduction sites have experienced multiple years of reproduction from released individuals.|$|E
25|$|For instance, with {{relation}} {{to social security}} and general family law, same-sex couples were not previously recognised as a couple for social security or family assistance purposes. A person who had a same-sex de facto partner {{was treated as a}} single person. The reforms ensured that same-sex couples were (for the first time under Australian law) recognised as a couple akin to opposite-sex partners. Consequently, a same-sex couple receives the same rate of social security and family assistance payments as an opposite-sex couple. Generally speaking a couple in a de facto relationship is treated equally to a married couple in legal proceedings, though a few small differences exist in family law disputes, including property settlements and entitlements to spousal maintenance. A partner in a de facto relationship may also be required to prove the existence of a relationship before a court in order to access benefits, a process which is automatic for married couples and consequently can have a discriminatory impact on same-sex couples, who cannot yet marry in Australia. De facto relationships also have different time eligibility requirements than marriages when it comes to laws dealing with Centrelink, migration, family law matters and <b>assisted</b> <b>reproduction.</b> The greater burden of proof can impact on a person's ability to arrange their partner's funeral, and the rights of a de facto partner may be poorly understood by government departments. Despite large equality of rights, Australia does not have a national registered partnership, civil union or same-sex relationship scheme.|$|E
