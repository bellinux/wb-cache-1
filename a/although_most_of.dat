5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> NY37 in {{the town}} of Bombay is {{contained}} within the reservation, a short portion east of Hogansburg and the St. Regis River and west of Tarbell Road is located outside the reservation limits. Within this stretch, NY37 meets both the eastern end of NY37C and the northern terminus of NY95. East of the reservation, NY37 roughly parallels the CSX Transportation-owned Montreal Subdivision northeast to Fort Covington, where NY37 crosses the railroad line and intersects Water Street (unsigned NY970T), a connector to Quebec Route132 on the northern side of the Canadian border.|$|E

5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the character's {{specifications}} {{could be}} customized, some elements {{were to be}} determined by the game's two character types, Legendary and Dreaded.

5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> {{the figures}} are generic {{representations}} of human forms in various walks and stages of life, Taft included himself, {{with one of his}} assistants following him, along {{the west side of the}} sculpture.

5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> {{the judging}} had been {{completed}} before the fire, suggestions {{at the time that}} the committee could use what they had learned from the entrants to propose a new competition with greater clarity as to the requirements led to naught: a 1925 letter to the then Premier John Gunn reveals that there was little to be learned from the competition, as the assessors had found that none of the designs were suitable.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Drakken (voiced by John DiMaggio): born Drew Theodore P. Lipsky, Drakken is Kim's archnemesis {{and most}} {{resilient}} adversary; a mad scientist plotting world domination, <b>although</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> his schemes fail {{at the hands}} of Kim because he lacks both the patience and intelligence to perfect his ideas, which often suffer {{as a result of his}} own mistakes and oversights. His skin has permanently been turned blue as a result of a laboratory accident. Additionally, Drakken is a former college roommate of Kim's father James.|$|E
5|$|Ebrey {{argues that}} <b>although</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> Emperor Wu's fiscal {{policies}} were repealed during Eastern Han, their {{damage to the}} merchant class and the subsequent laissez-faire policies of Eastern Han allowed the wealthiest landowners to dominate society, ensuring that China's economy would remain firmly agrarian-based for centuries. The Eastern Han central government lost {{an important source of}} revenue by relinquishing its salt and iron industries and purchasing its armies' swords and shields from private manufacturers. However, this loss of revenue was often compensated by higher taxes levied on the merchants.|$|E

5|$|It is salient to {{note that}} in {{taxonomy}} and binomial nomenclature, the genus name of the martins (the larger-bodied among swallow genera) is Progne, a Latinized form of Procne.

5|$|Like all sundews, D. anglica uses stalked {{mucilaginous}} glands called tentacles which cover its laminae to attract, trap, and digest small arthropods, usually insects.

Small butterflies, damselflies, and even dragonflies can become immobilized by the plant's sticky mucilage.|$|E
