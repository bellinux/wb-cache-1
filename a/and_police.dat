40|$|The {{purpose of}} this essay was to study social workers´ <b>and</b> <b>polices</b> {{contributions}} with criminal youth gangs and get an insight in how co-operation in the contributions between these governments comes to rank and works. To find out, we carried out a study with a qualitative design based on document studies and interviews with social workers´ <b>and</b> <b>polices</b> who were meeting youths in their work. Our findings were that it's hard to define a criminal youth gang. The social workers´ <b>and</b> <b>polices</b> have both individual and common contributions with criminal youth gangs. One of their most important lining is to prevent new recruitment of young people to criminality. The social workers´ <b>and</b> <b>polices</b> both have an intention to cooperate but they can’t agree about the method of work they shall use, “the kid-glove or the whip”...|$|R
5|$|In October 1998, Milošević and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke {{reached an}} {{agreement}} to temporarily end the fighting, whereby Yugoslavia would halve the amount of troops <b>and</b> <b>police</b> personnel stationed in Kosovo. The agreement came after Holbrooke convinced the KLA to consider negotiations with Belgrade, while making it clear to Milošević that failing to find a peaceful solution to the conflict {{would lead to a}} NATO bombing campaign against Serbia. The agreement required Yugoslavia to let Kosovo Verification Mission (KVM) observers enter Kosovo to ensure that the Yugoslavs were abiding by their commitment to withdraw thousands of soldier <b>and</b> <b>police</b> officers from the province. Small-scale clashes continued, and by December, over 1,000 people had been killed and more than 300,000 displaced in the fighting.|$|E

40|$|Against a {{background}} of discourses that link economic vitality of city-centres, consumption and safety to greater need for surveillance <b>and</b> <b>policing,</b> the current study takes particular interest in the city-centre night-time economy (NTE). This is a distinctive space-time where significant increases in surveillance <b>and</b> <b>policing</b> can be witnessed across cities in Europe and beyond. It is not evident, however, if {{and to what extent}} such interventions increase subjectively experienced safety and reduce fear of crime among people visiting city-centre bars and clubs on their nights out. Drawing on existing literatures on the NTE in cities, emotional geography, studies of surveillance <b>and</b> <b>policing</b> <b>and</b> the authors' previous research, this study develops a 'thicker' and situational quantitative approach to examining the effects on subjectively experienced safety of different manifestations of surveillance <b>and</b> <b>policing</b> in the NTE context. The visible proximity of <b>police</b> officers <b>and</b> door staff of bars and clubs are shown to have stronger effects on experienced safety than the positioning of CCTV and whether their footage is watched live or not. Nonetheless, the effects of surveillance <b>and</b> <b>policing</b> on experienced safety are rather complex insofar that they are to a considerable extent relational in nature and also ambiguous. For instance, a key difference between <b>police</b> <b>and</b> door staff is that police officers are more often seen as a friend of everybody and their presence as enhancing experienced safety; responses to door staff are more ambiguous and differentiated along lines of ethnicity. It is also demonstrated that surveillance <b>and</b> <b>policing</b> reduce rather than enhance experienced safety for a minority of the study participants...|$|R
