5|$|The logical {{positivism}} movement {{originated in the}} Vienna Circle and was continued by British philosopher A. J. Ayer. The Vienna Circle adopted the distinction between analytic and synthetic statements: analytic statements are those whose meaning is contained within the words themselves, such as definitions, tautologies or mathematical statements, while synthetic statements make claims about reality. To determine whether <b>a</b> <b>synthetic</b> statement is meaningful, the Vienna Circle developed a verifiability theory of meaning, which proposed that for <b>a</b> <b>synthetic</b> statement to have cognitive meaning, its truthfulness must be empirically verifiable. Because claims about God cannot be empirically verified, the logical positivists argued that religious propositions are meaningless.|$|E
50|$|After {{ruling out}} the {{possibility}} of analytic a posteriori propositions, and explaining how we can obtain knowledge of analytic a priori propositions, Kant also explains how we can obtain knowledge of <b>synthetic</b> <b>a</b> posteriori propositions. That leaves only the question of how knowledge of <b>synthetic</b> <b>a</b> priori propositions is possible. This question is exceedingly important, Kant maintains, because all important metaphysical knowledge is of <b>synthetic</b> <b>a</b> priori propositions. If it is impossible to determine which <b>synthetic</b> <b>a</b> priori propositions are true, he argues, then metaphysics as a discipline is impossible. The remainder of the Critique of Pure Reason is devoted to examining whether and how knowledge of <b>synthetic</b> <b>a</b> priori propositions is possible.|$|R

5|$|While a great {{solution}} for the actors' performances the technique presented enormous VFX challenges: relighting shots captured in a tall white tube to match the sky over the Bolivian desert, and the impossibility of filming medium to wide shots of the actors. An array of eight Dalsa Origin cameras (supported by seven HD cameras and a 35mm hand-held camera, all running in sync) was {{used to create a}} virtual camera with which to shoot the actors floating in the simulator. Ged Wright and his team at Double Negative developed a method to use the data from these cameras that allowed these real performances to be placed in <b>a</b> <b>synthetic</b> environment as seen by <b>a</b> <b>synthetic</b> camera.|$|E
