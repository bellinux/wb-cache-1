How this asymmetry influences the activation of voltage-gated dendritic channels, and consequent neuronal behavior, remains unclear. Based on {{the analysis of}} asymmetry in several types of motoneurons, we extended our previous methodology for reducing a fully reconstructed motoneuron model to a two-compartment representation that preserved <b>asymmetric</b> <b>signal</b> propagation. The reduced models accurately replicated the dendritic excitability and {{the dynamics of the}} anatomical model involving a persistent inward current (PIC) dispersed over the dendrites. The relationship between <b>asymmetric</b> <b>signal</b> propagation and dendritic excitability was investigated using the reduced models while varying the asymmetry in signal propagation between the soma and the dendrite with PIC density constant. We found that increases in signal attenuation from soma to dendrites increased the activation threshold of a PIC (hypo-excitability), whereas increases in signal attenuation from dendrites to soma decreased the activation threshold of a PIC (hyper-excitability). These effects were so strong that reversing the asymmetry in the soma-to-dendrite vs. dendrite-to-soma attenuation, reversed the correlation between PIC threshold and distance of this current source from the soma.

Different from the traditional symmetric signaling scheme, proper Gaussian signaling (PGS), that is parametrized by its variance, IGS needs additional statistical-quantity called the pseudo-variance to be fully described. The cooperative system under consideration suffers from two types of interferences, the residual self-interference (RSI) and IQI. To evaluate the system performance gain using IGS, first we express the end-to-end achievable rate for different IQI. Then, we optimize the pseudo-variance to compensate the interferences impact and improve the end-to-end achievable rate. Interestingly, IGS-based scheme outperforms its counterpart PGS-based scheme, especially at higher interference-to-noise ratio.

Although the mutant embryos express Nodal at gastrulation stages, the subsequent expression of this gene in the node and left LPM is lost. A transgene that conferred Nodal expression specifically in the node rescued the L-R defects of the Nodalneo/neo embryos. Conversely, ectopic expression of the Nodal inhibitor Lefty 2 in the node of Nodalneo/+ embryos resulted in a phenotype {{similar to that of the}} Nodalneo/neo mutant.

Leftward flow of extracellular fluid at the node (nodal flow) is critical for normal LR axis determination in the mouse.

The cation channel polycystin- 2 is also required to establish LR asymmetry. We show that lrd localizes to a centrally located subset of node monocilia, while polycystin- 2 is found in all node monocilia. <b>Asymmetric</b> calcium <b>signaling</b> appears at the left margin of the node coincident with nodal flow.

Quantitative live cell imaging combined with modeling analyses revealed that intraneuritic anterograde transport and retrograde diffusion of shootin 1 account for its neurite length-dependent accumulation.
