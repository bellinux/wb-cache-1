40|$|In this paper, the {{performance}} of a manual GPS <b>guidance</b> <b>system</b> to assist farming operations is evaluated. The distribution of granular fertilizer was simulated in order to discretize areas with excessive application of fertilizers and areas with fertilizer application rates below the intended rate. The path of travel followed by a tractor with the manual GPS <b>guidance</b> <b>system</b> was analysed and compared with a commercial parallel tracking <b>system</b> and <b>without</b> <b>guidance</b> assistance. In addition, the analysis evaluated how the use of manual GPS <b>guidance</b> <b>systems</b> improves {{the performance}} of field operations that require large distances between passes. Under the experimental conditions used, the best results were obtained using a commercial parallel tracking system but, for our purposes, small differences were observed between the results obtained with the commercial system and the results obtained with the developed manual GPS <b>guidance</b> <b>system,</b> getting pass-to-pass average error values of 0. 26 and 0. 73 m, respectively. The results obtained with both systems were significantly better than the results obtained when no guidance assistance was used. In our trials, area with appropriate fertilizer rate was clearly increased when guidance assistance was used. Values of area with correct fertilizer rate applied ranged between 87 % with commercial parallel tracking and 59 % <b>without</b> <b>guidance</b> assistance. The use of the manual GPS <b>guidance</b> <b>system</b> presented in this paper has proved sufficient to obtain good results for mechanical fertilizer spreading...|$|R
40|$|The International Aerial Robotics Competition is {{an annual}} event {{sponsored}} by the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems (AUVS).

Creating a flying robot with these capabilities presents many challenges. The robot has to make control decisions that achieve its goals based upon imperfect sensory data while adapting to unexpected situations such as gusts of wind or sensor failure.

40|$|Although most pilots will {{name the}} takeoff {{as the most}} {{hazardous}} phase of the flight operations, historically more accidents have occurred during the approach and landing operational phases. A study on executive turboprop and jets revealed that during the 20 year period from 1964 to 1984, 71 percent of corporate aircraft accidents occurred in the approach and landing phase. l A careful analysis of most landing accidents suggest that they are simply the inevitable result of a poor approach. Many landing accidents {{are the result of}} overshoots (touchdown too late on the runway) and to a lesser extent, undershoots (descending too soon or quickly). Hard landings are also uncomfortable for the passengers as well as dangerous since the impact may cause loss of control of the aircraft. Because of the potential for disaster during landing, the airline industry takes the approach and landing phase of operation very seriously. With the growing consumer airline industry in the past 20 years, there has been a growing concern for safety. As the aircraft industry began to develop more complex, heavier aircraft, more sophisticated landing aids were needed.

The <b>guidance</b> <b>system</b> was built upon a previous incarnation that utilised Garmin GPS 35 receivers providing position data at a rate of 1 Hz. The <b>guidance</b> <b>system</b> currently uses an indicating arrow on a computer screen to provide guidance information to operators.

The accuracy of the <b>guidance</b> <b>system</b> to guide an operator along parallel paths offset a distance from each other was also quantifed. The ability for the software to offset over different distances was also determined.
