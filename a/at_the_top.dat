5|$|All the WindSeekers have {{speakers}} {{mounted to}} the inside of the gondola structure. They play 18 different tracks, among which are Hedwig's theme from the Harry Potter films, the theme songs from E.T., , and Superman, and songs from Flight of the Valkyries. At Cedar Point and Kings Island, the WindSeeker sign changes colors during night operation. At Cedar Point, as the gondola makes its way up the tower, the LED lights <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of the tower go out, making the tower invisible, though the LED lights on the gondola remains lit. When the gondola comes back down, the lights <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of the tower come on again.

5|$|Most sponges work {{rather like}} chimneys: they {{take in water}} {{at the bottom and}} eject it from the osculum ("little mouth") <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top.</b> Since ambient {{currents}} are faster <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top,</b> the suction effect that they produce by Bernoulli's principle does some of the work for free. Sponges can control the water flow by various combinations of wholly or partially closing the osculum and ostia (the intake pores) and varying the beat of the flagella, and may shut it down if {{there is a lot of}} sand or silt in the water.|$|E

The gap was cut to two points after Arsenal suffered their first defeat in 2003, against Blackburn Rovers. By the time Arsenal played Everton on 23 March 2003, they were displaced <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of the table by Manchester United.

40|$|With {{conventional}} photolithography and {{wet chemical}} etching, we have realized GaAs/AlGaAs buried ridge-quantum-well-wires (RQWWs) with vertically stacked wires in lateral arrays promising for device application, which were grown in situ by a single-step {{molecular beam epitaxy}} growth and formed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ridge <b>tops</b> of mesas on nonplanar substrates. Confocal photoluminescence (CPL) and polarization-dependent photoreflectance (PR) are applied to study optical characteristics of RQWWs. Lateral bandgap modulation due to lateral variation of QW layer thickness is demonstrated not only by CPL but also by PR. As one evidence for RQWWs, a large blue shift is observed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> energy level positions for electronic transitions corresponding to quantum wells (QWs) <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ridge <b>tops</b> of mesas compared with those corresponding to QWs on nonpatterned areas of the same sample. The blue shift is in contradiction {{with the fact that}} the GaAs QW layers <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> of <b>the</b> mesas are thicker than those on nonpatterned areas. The other evidence for RQWWs, optical anisotropy is provided by the polarization-dependent PR, which results from lateral quantum size effect existing <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> of <b>the</b> mesas...|$|R
