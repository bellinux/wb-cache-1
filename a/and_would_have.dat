5|$|A two-track Madison Avenue Line {{would have}} run from the {{proposed}} 59th tunnel via Madison Avenue <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> tied into the then-under utilized BMT Broadway Line {{in the vicinity of}} Madison Square.|$|E
5|$|Another {{alternative}} landing {{concept was}} the US Air Force's proposal to attach wings to the spacecraft. This proposal arose {{soon after the}} cancellation of the X-20 Dyna-Soar, <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> seen a Gemini spacecraft attached {{to a set of}} wings developed during the ASSET program. This would have been launched by a Titan II rocket, <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been unable to maneuver in orbit. Another proposal saw the spacecraft being launched by a Titan IIIA or IIIC, using the Transtage for maneuvering. Once the mission was complete, the spacecraft would have been deorbited by means of five solid rocket motors.|$|E
5|$|Coevolution theory : Viruses {{may have}} evolved from complex {{molecules}} of protein and DNA {{at the same}} time as cells first appeared on earth <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> depended on cellular life for many millions of years.|$|E
6000|$|How {{different}} it all <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been, I {{could not}} but reflect, if this {{girl had been}} the sort of girl one chirrups cheerily to over the telephone and takes for spins in the old two-seater. In that case, I <b>would</b> simply <b>have</b> said, [...] "Listen," [...] <b>and</b> she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> said, [...] "What?" [...] <b>and</b> I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> said, [...] "You know Gussie Fink-Nottle," [...] <b>and</b> she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> said, [...] "Yes," [...] <b>and</b> I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> said, [...] "He loves you," [...] <b>and</b> she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> said either, [...] "What, that mutt? Well, thank heaven for one good laugh today," [...] or else, in more passionate vein, [...] "Hot dog! Tell me more." ...|$|R
25|$|Although {{the overall}} result {{would not be}} changed, Bosnia <b>and</b> Herzegovina <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{achieved}} an 8th position instead of France, Denmark <b>would</b> <b>have</b> achieved 12th position instead of Ukraine, <b>and</b> Sweden <b>would</b> <b>have</b> achieved 20th position instead of Germany.|$|R
5|$|Cheah, Kim <b>and</b> No <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been in {{the lower}} dan ranks, <b>and</b> <b>would</b> not yet <b>have</b> held the title of 'Master,' when they were invited to teach in Australia. A {{biography}} of No indicates that he had four years' training when he arrived. Rozinsky <b>and</b> Walsh <b>would</b> <b>have</b> held 1st dan ranking in the 1960s. Both Rhee (KTA) <b>and</b> Yun (ITF) <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{been in the}} middle dan ranks and held the title of 'Master' when they arrived, as they were sent to Australia by their respective Korean governing bodies.|$|R
5|$|New Hampshire {{was to be}} {{the fourth}} Montana-class battleship, and was to be named in honor of the ninth state. She was {{assigned}} to the New York Navy Yard, <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been the third ship to bear that name had she been commissioned.|$|E
5|$|The {{connection}} of the IND South Brooklyn Line and the BMT Culver Line at Ditmas Avenue would be {{opened in the}} spring, <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> allowed eight more trains to run per hour on the BMT Brighton Line.|$|E
5|$|The initial party {{reached the}} Missouri River on June 14. It was {{apparent}} that the Latter-day Saints could not {{make it to the}} Great Basin that season <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to winter on the Missouri River..|$|E
60|$|Some girls, {{addressed}} {{with this}} reckless intermingling of jest <b>and</b> earnest, <b>would</b> <b>have</b> felt confused, <b>and</b> some <b>would</b> <b>have</b> felt flattered. With a good-tempered resolution, which never passed {{the limits of}} modesty and refinement, Emily met Alban Morris on his own ground.|$|R
6000|$|Grace sobbed {{herself to}} sleep! Poor, poor Grace! She {{had been looking}} for this {{opportunity}} of speaking about herself--about their future. This was to have been the beginning of her confidence about Dr. Devarges's secret; she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> told him frankly all the doctor had said, even his suspicions of Philip himself. <b>And</b> then Philip <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been sure to have told her his plans, <b>and</b> they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> gone back with help, <b>and</b> Philip <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been a hero whom Gabriel <b>would</b> <b>have</b> instantly recognised as the proper husband for Grace, <b>and</b> they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> all been very happy. And now they were all dead, and had died, perhaps, cursing her, and--Philip--Philip had not kissed her good-night, and was sitting gloomily under a tree! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have had}} a narrow escape," [...] he said. [...] "There is a sword-thrust just below your collar-bone. An inch or two lower <b>and</b> it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> gone hard with you; {{a little more to}} the left <b>and</b> it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> pierced your throat." ...|$|R
5|$|These {{earliest}} tetrapods {{were not}} terrestrial. The earliest confirmed terrestrial forms are {{known from the}} early Carboniferous deposits, some 20 million years later. Still, they may have spent very brief periods out of water <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> used their legs to paw {{their way through the}} mud.|$|E
5|$|Written by Gareth Roberts and Clayton Hickman. Planned for {{the seventh}} and eighth episodes of the fifth series, <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> seen Mr. Smith, Sarah Jane's alien computer, {{adopting}} a human form.|$|E
5|$|A crisis erupted {{over the}} writs of {{assistance}} on December 27, 1760, {{when the news}} of King George II's death on October 23 arrived in Boston. All writs automatically expired {{six months after the}} death of the King, <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> had to be re-issued by George III, the new king, to remain valid.|$|E
25|$|The “Undefeated” army now {{created a}} unique problem for Carthage. Had Hamilcar {{suffered}} a decisive defeat, casualties <b>and</b> prisoners <b>would</b> <b>have</b> diminished their numbers <b>and</b> Carthage <b>would</b> <b>have</b> had an {{excuse not to}} pay anything. But now the 20,000 man army had to be paid their full due.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{answered}} Bucklaw, [...] "and he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> collared you, <b>and</b> cried 'help,' <b>and</b> {{then you}} <b>would</b> <b>have</b> shaken the soul OUT of him, I suppose. Your very look <b>and</b> manner <b>would</b> <b>have</b> frightened {{the old man}} to death." ...|$|R
50|$|Based {{on their}} final league positions, Juventus <b>and</b> Milan <b>would</b> <b>have</b> earned a direct {{entry into the}} UEFA Champions League, Inter <b>and</b> Fiorentina <b>would</b> <b>have</b> entered the third {{qualifying}} round of the Champions League, while Roma, Lazio <b>and</b> Chievo <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been eligible for the UEFA Cup. On 6 June 2006, the FIGC officially withdrew from the 2006 Intertoto Cup, costing Palermo {{a place in the}} third round of the competition, citing the fact that the 2005-06 Serie A standings could not be confirmed by the 5 June deadline.|$|R
5|$|A second range stood {{along the}} north-west wall, <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been {{connected}} to the hall range by the donjon tower. The ground floor housed a kitchen. In 1725 the range was remodelled into a two-storey house, accessed via a stone stair, and topped with the dormer windows which now form part of the gatehouse. The well in front is original, although the large stone surround is of 19th century date.|$|E
5|$|A unique {{feature of}} {{architecture}} of ancient Sri Lanka, vatadages were {{built for the}} protection of small stupas that had an important relic enshrined in them or were built on hallowed ground. If the Polonnaruwa Vatadage is the shrine built by Parakramabahu I, the relic of the tooth of the Buddha would have been enshrined within it. Another possibility is that the alms bowl used by the Buddha may have been enshrined here. Both these relics were important objects in ancient Sri Lankan culture, <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> made the Polonnaruwa Vatadage {{one of the most significant}} and venerated buildings in the country.|$|E
5|$|AS-204 {{was to be}} {{the first}} manned test flight of the Apollo Command/Service Module (CSM) to Earth orbit, {{launched}} on a Saturn IB rocket. AS-204 was to test launch operations, ground tracking and control facilities and the performance of the Apollo-Saturn launch assembly <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> lasted up to two weeks, depending on how the spacecraft performed.|$|E
60|$|Anne {{laughed at}} Jerome as she <b>had</b> always done, <b>and</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> owned {{for the world}} {{that she could have}} missed him. Jerome was useful, she admitted, and a {{comfortable}} friend; <b>and</b> she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> liked him well enough if he would only omit that ridiculous yearly ceremony of proposal.|$|R
2500|$|It is {{not certain}} {{which side of the}} railway the {{motorway}} <b>would</b> <b>have</b> run but {{the south side of the}} railway through Balham is likely to have offered the road planners the easier route. At Tooting Common the Balham Loop <b>would</b> <b>have</b> had a Y-shaped junction with the end of the M23 motorway coming north from Streatham Vale <b>and</b> <b>would</b> then <b>have</b> continued through Streatham Hill, over the A23 <b>and</b> then <b>would</b> <b>have</b> cut through a residential area to reach the triangular railway junction south of Tulse Hill station. Here the Balham Loop <b>would</b> <b>have</b> met the [...] "South Cross Route to Parkway D Radial" [...] motorway <b>and</b> traffic <b>would</b> <b>have</b> had the option of turning north-east towards Brixton or south-east to West Norwood.|$|R
6000|$|... "The triumph is yours, Ernest," [...] Harry said. [...] "He <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{got away}} had you not stopped him with your bullet, <b>and</b> he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> made short work of me had you {{not come to}} my rescue, for I was half stunned with the fall, <b>and</b> he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> done for me {{as quickly as he}} did for that poor fellow there." ...|$|R
5|$|An {{extension}} {{of a proposed}} Madison Avenue Line and the IND Sixth Avenue Line operating via 59th Street, with two branches. One branch would have operated along Second Avenue with a branch connecting to the IRT Pelham Line, which {{would have had to}} be modified to fit B Division subway cars, and a branch connecting to the IND Concourse Line. The other branch would have continued under the East River, <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been connected to the Long Island Rail Road main line in the Sunnyside area. Subway trains would have continued via the Port Washington Branch to Little Neck, and via the LIRR Main Line to Rego Park, where it would have turned via the former Rockaway Beach Branch and then would have turned onto the Lower Montauk Branch, <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> continued on the branch through Jamaica, where it would continue via the Atlantic Branch until Rosedale, staying within city limits. The report claims that its proposed routes would serve up to twice as many people as the NYCTA's proposed routes.|$|E
5|$|Another {{canceled}} {{proposal to}} orbit Ganymede was the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter. It {{was designed to}} use nuclear fission for power, ion engine propulsion, <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> studied Ganymede in greater detail than previously. However, the mission was canceled in 2005 because of budget cuts. Another old proposal was called The Grandeur of Ganymede.|$|E
5|$|Bennett and Crow founded Exploring the Arts, a {{charitable}} {{organization dedicated to}} creating, promoting, and supporting arts education. At {{the same time they}} founded (and named after Bennett's friend) the Frank Sinatra School of the Arts in Queens, a public high school dedicated to teaching the performing arts, which opened in 2001 <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> a very high graduation rate. On June 21, 2007, Bennett married Crow in a private civil ceremony in New York that was witnessed by former Governor Mario Cuomo.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Verily, my Lord,' said Berenger, 'I {{think the}} King meant us kindly, <b>and</b> <b>would</b> gladly <b>have</b> sped us well away. Methought {{he felt his}} bondage bitterly, <b>and</b> <b>would</b> fain <b>have</b> dared {{to be a true}} king. Even at the last, he bade me to his garde-robe, and all there were unhurt.' ...|$|R
25|$|The Sabine River was {{too deep}} to ford, and {{proved to be}} navigable. Early {{travelers}} <b>and</b> settlers <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to swim the river on horseback <b>and</b> cattle <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to be driven into the river to swim across. Ferries were later put into service. By the 1840s steamboats were traveling from Logansport to Sabine Lake.|$|R
6000|$|... "There <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> {{been so much}} need, Gerald. They needn't {{have bothered}} about the thatch, when it only rains once in six months, or so; while as for clothes, it is little enough they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> needed. <b>And</b> the bogs <b>would</b> all <b>have</b> dried up, <b>and</b> they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> had crops without more trouble than just {{scratching}} the ground, and sowing in the seed; <b>and</b> they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> grown oranges, instead of praties. Oh, it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been a great country, entirely!" ...|$|R
5|$|Caerphilly's water defences {{were almost}} {{certainly}} inspired by those at Kenilworth, where a similar set of artificial lakes and dams was created. Gilbert de Clare had fought at {{the siege of}} Kenilworth in 1266 <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> seen these at first hand. Caerphilly's water defences provided particular protection against mining, which could otherwise undermine castle walls during the period, and are considered the most advanced of their kind in Britain.|$|E
5|$|Clinton said Republican {{amendments}} would {{strip the}} U.S. Treasury {{of its ability}} to dip into federal trust funds to avoid a borrowing crisis. Republican amendments would have limited appeals by death-row inmates, made it harder to issue health, safety and environmental regulations, <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> committed the president to a seven-year balanced budget. Clinton vetoed a second bill allowing the government to keep operating beyond the time when most spending authority expires.|$|E
5|$|Director Quentin Tarantino {{expressed}} interest in directing an adaptation of Casino Royale, but Eon were not interested. He claims to have worked behind the scenes with the Fleming family, and believed this was the reason why filmmakers finally went ahead with Casino Royale. Tarantino also {{said he would have}} set it in the 1960s <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> only made it with Pierce Brosnan as Bond. In February 2005, Martin Campbell was announced as the film's director. Later in 2005, Sony led a consortium that purchased MGM, allowing Sony to gain distribution rights starting with the film.|$|E

500|$|Written by Clayton Hickman. Planned for {{the fourth}} series, it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> seen {{children}} {{from all over the}} world being a part of fantasy books.
