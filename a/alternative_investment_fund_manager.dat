40|$|The highly politicized {{debate about}} the recent <b>Alternative</b> <b>Investment</b> <b>Fund</b> <b>Manager</b> (AIFM) Directive of the European Union led many {{observers}} to suspect an ideological battle between countries seeking to impose transnational regulation on financial service industries such as hedge funds and liberal market economies insisting {{on the benefits of}} market discipline in order to protect their financial centers. The battle that appeared to particularly pit France against the United Kingdom can thus be interpreted {{as an example of a}} regulatory paradigm shift in the aftermath of the crisis. This article cautions against such an ideas-centered account of financial regulation and points to the economic interests that drove the French and German agendas. However, contrary to the assumptions of traditional political economy approaches, national preferences were not simply defined by the aggregate of a country’s economic interests. Rather, industry success in shaping government positions on alternative investment regulation crucially depended on how a given industry fit into the government’s overarching geo-political agenda. By highlighting this feedback loop between government strategy and industry lobbying, the paper proposes a strategic analysis of financial regulation, as opposed to accounts that consider positions to be pre-determined by ideas or socio-economic structures. economic policy; financial markets; ideas; liberalization; regulation...|$|E

The recession {{of the global economy}} affected the commercial and financial relations between European economies and between Europe {{and the rest of the}} world. European Commission has indicated how it intends to apply state aid rules to state support schemes and individual assistance for financial institutions; has provided guidance on the treatment of asset relief and impaired assets; and has presented proposals for establishing regulatory and supervisory standards for <b>alternative</b> <b>investment</b> <b>fund</b> <b>managers.</b> In this condition European Union has two major challenges: one to continue its Agenda on the integration phenomenon, and the other to apply measures to recover the crisis...|$|R
2500|$|In the EU, {{managers}} {{are subject to}} the EU's Directive on <b>Alternative</b> <b>Investment</b> <b>Fund</b> <b>Managers</b> (AIFMD). According to the EU, the aim of the directive is to provide greater monitoring and control of <b>alternative</b> <b>investment</b> <b>funds.</b> AIFMD requires all EU hedge <b>fund</b> <b>managers</b> to register with national regulatory authorities and to disclose more information, on a more frequent basis. It also directs hedge <b>fund</b> <b>managers</b> to hold larger amounts of capital. AIFMD also introduced a [...] "passport" [...] for hedge funds authorised in one EU country to operate throughout the EU. The scope of AIFMD is broad and encompasses managers located within the EU as well as non-EU managers that market their funds to European investors. An aspect of AIFMD which challenges established practices in the hedge funds sector is the potential restriction of remuneration through bonus deferrals and clawback provisions.|$|R
40|$|The 2007 - 2009 global {{financial}} turmoil has taught risk managers lessons {{that will be}} crucial for developing more stable financial markets in the future. Private equity funds are sometimes believed to have {{played a major role}} during this {{global financial}} turmoil. In the light of serious economic problems, questions arose whether the regulation of these funds were sufficient or whether the effects of the global crisis would have been mitigated if regulation and supervision had been stricter. In this paper we argue that the private equity regulatory proposals included in the Directive on <b>Alternative</b> <b>Investment</b> <b>Fund</b> <b>Managers</b> in the European Union and the Dodd-Frank at Act in the USA will be inefficient, i. e. the costs of such regulations will outweigh its benefits and will not offer future market protection...|$|R

40|$|The <b>Alternative</b> <b>Investment</b> <b>Fund</b> <b>Managers</b> Directive (Directive) is a European Union (EU) {{directive}} {{issued in}} response to recent economic crises {{with the goal of}} reducing systemic economic risk and protecting EU investors, primarily through enhanced corporate governance requirements, leverage limits, liquidity requirements, transparency measures, and disclosure requirements. The Directive regulates <b>alternative</b> <b>investment</b> <b>fund</b> <b>managers</b> and creates two harmonized regulatory regimes called “passport systems,” one for use by EU <b>fund</b> <b>managers,</b> and one for use by third-country <b>fund</b> <b>managers.</b> The passport system for EU <b>fund</b> <b>managers</b> is already in effect, but the European Commission has not yet implemented the passport system regulating third-country <b>fund</b> <b>managers.</b> The third-country passport system is a novelty in EU law and invokes unique policy issues. For example, both EU and third-country regulatory authorities face the challenge of supervising and enforcing compliance by third-country <b>fund</b> <b>managers</b> with the Directive. They also must determine how to address regulatory arbitrage that results from discrepancies in the legal frameworks of different jurisdictions. Furthermore, the Directive contains numerous vague provisions that are relevant to the implementation of the third-country passport regime; {{and the ways in which}} these provisions are interpreted will have significant consequences for stakeholders. This Comment constructs and applies a systemic cost-benefit analysis framework and assesses the merits of potential interpretations of the Directive’s provisions. The framework incorporates the Directive’s policy objectives, applicable regulations, and related EU financial law, as well as the private and social costs imposed by each interpretation. This Comment illustrates this framework’s utility by applying it to two vague provisions of the Directive that are significant in light of the pending expansion of the passport system to cover third-country <b>funds</b> and <b>fund</b> <b>managers.</b> In the course of analyzing these two provisions, this Comment raises important considerations that are relevant in evaluating interpretations of numerous other provisions of the Directive. Finally, this Comment suggests which interpretation is preferred for the two provisions examined and discusses important empirical assumptions and questions, highlighting relevant facts that may favor a different interpretation...|$|R

In the first of eight chapters I introduce this topic in the historical context, which provides a brief excursion into the progress of regulation of collective investment at the European and Czech level, and further explain the reasons which led to creation of a unified regulation for collective investment business. The second chapter describes the current regulatory framework in accordance with the European regulation, based primarily on the <b>Alternative</b> <b>Investment</b> <b>Fund</b> <b>Managers</b> Directive (AIFMD) and its subsequent transposition into the Czech Act on Investment Companies and <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds</b> (ICIFA) [...] . ...|$|R

40|$|The {{financial}} and economic crisis is laying bare the serious shortcomings {{in the regulation}} and supervision of financial markets.

The proposal for a directive under consideration here is intended to establish just such {{a balance between the}} risk inherent in the activities of <b>investment</b> <b>funds</b> and the responsibility they bear as a result. On 30 April 2009, in response to a number of Parliament own-initiative reports and ever increasing public pressure, the Commission put forward a proposal for a directive on <b>Alternative</b> <b>Investment</b> <b>Fund</b> <b>Managers</b> which is designed to create a legal framework for all funds not covered by the UCITS Directive.

40|$|The European Union's <b>Alternative</b> <b>Investment</b> <b>Fund</b> <b>Managers</b> Directive ('AIFMD') has now beenapproved by the European Parliament and Council. The AIFMD is {{designed}} to provide for clear, streamlined regulation of mutual <b>fund</b> <b>managers</b> and therefore, indirectly mutual funds, with a view to ensuring that funds actively marketed to professional investors in Europe are managed in a transparent and secure manner. The AIFMD provides for additional requirements when non-EU domiciled <b>fund</b> <b>managers</b> and/or <b>funds</b> are targeting European investors. These additional requirements mainly relate to whether the fund manager/fund's place of domicile is considered questionable or not. It has been commented upon that these additional requirements may make non-EU funds jurisdictions (particularly in offshore financial centres) less attractive when European money is being targeted. This article does not take a position in relation to the merits of the AIFMD or the attractiveness of EU versus non-EU jurisdictions in an AIFMD age. Instead, this article notes that the AIFMD may provide opportunities for offshore financial centres that are EU member states, and focuses on how three such EU offshore centres (Malta, Cyprus and Gibraltar) are positioning themselves to take advantage of what opportunities may arise...|$|R

After the fall of Lehman Brothers, often described as being “too big to fail” the decision was made to increase supervision, focussed on <b>fund</b> <b>managers</b> of <b>alternative</b> <b>investment</b> <b>funds,</b> real estate funds included. This graduation thesis describes the impact of AIFMD on real estate <b>fund</b> <b>managers</b> and the potential effects on the real estate investment market. Through the use of a cost-impact survey on <b>fund</b> <b>managers</b> and by conducting interviews with institutional investors, the main research question has been answered. This report argues that, in general, the cost impact for large, institutional real estate <b>fund</b> <b>managers</b> is not significant. However, smaller, private real estate <b>fund</b> <b>managers</b> do suffer a significant cost impact. This probably has far-reaching consequences for the real estate investment market. The report also presents the expected transparency benefits for the real estate investment market, caused by AIFMD. Short-term, private investors are expected to benefit the most in terms of transparency. On the long-term, the real estate sector as a whole may benefit from an improved image and more trust.
