25|$|The {{opening of}} the Bærum Tunnel, {{the second phase of}} the Asker Line, 26 August 2011, meant that express and {{regional}} trains bypassed Stabekk Station <b>all</b> <b>together</b> <b>and</b> run directly from Lysaker to Sandvika. Subsequently the segment of the Drammen Line between Lysaker and Sandvika was upgrades. To carry out efficient construction work, the segment of track was closed and all trains diverted via the Bærum Tunnel from 7 April 2013 to 13 December 2014.|$|E
25|$|The {{opening of}} the Bærum Tunnel, {{the second phase of}} the Asker Line, 26 August 2011, meant that express and {{regional}} trains bypassed Høvik Station <b>all</b> <b>together</b> <b>and</b> run directly from Lysaker to Sandvika. As part of the Asker Line project, Lysaker Station was upgraded, allowing the Norwegian State Railways to terminate more of their trains there instead of at Skøyen Station. The work on Lysaker Station was completed in August 2011, but because of there was no capacity to turn around trains at Lysaker, the increased capacity was placed on hold until December 2014. This required that a new site to turn around trains was found.|$|E
25|$|After the battle, Ostorius was honoured with triumphal {{insignia}} but {{the victory}} did not entirely quell {{resistance in the}} Welsh borders. The Silures especially continued to harass Roman troops, supposedly after Ostorius had publicly said that they posed such a danger {{that they should be}} either exterminated or transplanted. A large legionary force occupied in building forts in Siluran territory was surrounded and attacked and only rescued with difficulty and considerable loss. This violent desperation {{on the part of the}} Silures can be attributed to their reaction to what Peter Salway calls Ostorius' lack of political judgement. The Silures had been galvanised by Ostorius' ill-thought out threats to destroy them and began taking Roman prisoners as hostages and distributing them amongst their neighbouring tribes. This had the effect of binding them <b>all</b> <b>together</b> <b>and</b> creating a new resistance movement.|$|E

500|$|In casting his nine-member crew, Whedon looked {{first at}} the actors and {{considered}} their chemistry with others. Cast member Sean Maher recalls, [...] "So then he just sort of put us <b>all</b> <b>together,</b> <b>and</b> I {{think it was very}} quick, like right out of the gate, we all instantly bonded". All nine cast members were chosen before filming began. However, while filming the original pilot [...] "Serenity", Whedon decided that Rebecca Gayheart was unsuitable for the role of Inara Serra, and shot her scenes in singles so that {{it would be easier to}} replace her. Morena Baccarin auditioned for the role and two days later was on the set in her first television show. [...] "Joss brought me down from the testing room like a proud dad, holding my hand and introducing me," [...] Baccarin recalled.|$|E
500|$|GamePro did {{not find}} the game worthy of its name, {{although}} the cutscenes were praised, stating, [...] "The cinemas {{at the opening of}} the game and between each level are stunning; however, the game graphics, particularly buildings and enemies, are lackluster at best. The sound effects are bland, and there are no weapon power-ups to be found. Put that <b>all</b> <b>together</b> <b>and</b> you get a very generic game." [...] Next Generation criticized the game for being tedious, but recognized that it is still an enjoyable game. Computer and Video Games offered similar criticism, declaring that [...] "it was too repetitive to become anything more than a good game." [...] Edge criticized the gameplay features such as camera control and boss difficulty. Electronic Gaming Monthly reviewers criticized the game for its easy bosses and its repetitive and short gameplay value. Famitsu liked the battles but complained about the Fuchikoma attaching to walls when not intended.|$|E

500|$|Turner interviewed flautist John Payne for the book, who had {{sat in on}} {{sessions}} with Van Morrison and later collaborated with him. Payne comments on their work together on the album Astral Weeks, which also included musicians Connie Kay, Warren Smith, Jay Berliner, and Richard Davis: [...] "Ironically, the image you have {{when you listen to}} the album now is of these guys who are <b>all</b> <b>together,</b> <b>and</b> they realise they are creating a monumental work of art. The fact is that it was just another session for them." [...] Payne states of his observations of Van Morrison's performance style: [...] "When (Van) was on stage, he would look like a space cadet, but then he'd open his mouth and you would realize that he had channeled everything into the sound of his voice. The rest of it was just a shell that was there for the purpose of producing this noise." ...|$|E
500|$|Broussard {{reported}} in a January 2006 interview that many of Duke Nukem Forevers elements had been finished; [...] "we're just basically pulling it <b>all</b> <b>together</b> <b>and</b> {{trying to make it}} fun". Later that year Broussard demonstrated samples of the game, including an early level, a vehicle sequence, and a few test rooms. Among the features seen was the interactive use of an in-game computer to send actual e-mails. The developer seemed contrite and affected by the long delays; while a journalist demoed the game Broussard referenced note cards and constantly apologized for the state of the game. In filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, Take-Two revealed they had renegotiated the Duke Nukem Forever deal, with the former publisher receiving $4.25million instead of $6million on release of the game. Take-Two offered a $500,000 bonus if Duke Nukem Forever was commercially released by December 31, 2006. However, Broussard denied the rumors that DNF would be released, saying that 3D Realms never cared for or asked for the bonus. He stated that he would [...] "never ship a game early." ...|$|E
500|$|Conversely, IGN's Ramsey Isler {{viewed the}} episode more positively, and rated it 7.9/10. He {{explained}} it [...] "deserves praise for {{doing a lot}} of things well," [...] and lauded the actors' performances, the props, the direction, and cinematography. Despite however finding Walter less entertaining than the previous season, and believing {{the first half of the}} episode moved too slowly and resembled [...] "an ordinary procedural crime show," [...] Isler enjoyed the ending for [...] " [...] it <b>all</b> <b>together</b> <b>and</b> [...] the previous 90% worthwhile". After watching the episode, MTV columnist Josh Wigler [...] "declared [...] fondness" [...] for Joshua Jackson, stating the actor had [...] "won [...] over thanks to Peter's central role in these first few episodes of Fringes" [...] second season". Wigler continued that it was [...] "an excellent mystery-of-the-week episode to be sure, though I'm really itching for more details on the alternate reality. Luckily, that's supposed to come next week with the return of Nimoy's William Bell, which makes tonight's less mythology-oriented outing easier to swallow. Plus, the end reveal with the Observer was pretty spicy, to say the least." ...|$|E

500|$|Another VFX {{supervisor}} from Zoic Studios, Andrew Orloff, {{believed the}} episode's special effects were {{possibly the most}} difficult of the season. He wrote, [...] "Originally, {{it was supposed to be}} a practical effect but they couldn't get it to fall in a natural way, so what we had to do was shoot the practical elements in pieces and we put them <b>all</b> <b>together</b> <b>and</b> timed all those plates and ended up rebuilding a significant part of it and tying it all together in CG. So we took a cyberscan of the guy's body, and on top of all the practical elements we used as a base, we had a matte painting, a reveal matte painting of the cracks that ran through the body, 3D particles of large chunks of ash falling out, 3D particles of small ash bits floating down, residual dust flying off of it and, at one point, his head falls off and crashes to the ground as ash. So we had to do a full-CG head and tumble it down the body. That was pretty complicated and entailed lots of R there was 2D work in After Effects, tracking, retiming, we did a lot of CG lighting for the body parts in Maya/mental ray and all of the particles were a combination of Maya software, and rendered in Maya/mental ray." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although Collectivist anarchism shares many {{similarities}} with Anarchist communism {{there are}} also many key differences between them. For example, collectivist anarchists believe that the economy and most or all property should be collectively owned by society while anarchist communists by contrast believe {{that the concept of}} ownership should be rejected by society and replaced with the concept of usage. Also Collectivist anarchists often favor using a form of currency to compensate workers according to {{the amount of time spent}} contributing to society and production while Anarcho-communists believe that currency and wages should be abolished <b>all</b> <b>together</b> <b>and</b> goods should be distributed [...] "to each according to his or her need".|$|E

2500|$|By 1964, the {{majority}} of American vocal groups especially all female bands such as the Shirelles and the Ronettes started struggling with finding a hit after the arrival of British pop and rock acts. In the meantime, other Motown girl groups such as Martha and the Vandellas and the Supremes were starting to get promoted by Motown staff with the Vandellas becoming the top girl group of 1963. The following year, the Supremes took their place as the label's top primary female group after a succession of hit recordings that year, culminating in the release of their second album, Where Did Our Love Go, which Motown was able to promote successfully. Regarding the aforementioned 'Where Did Our Love Go', page 97 of the book The Original Marvelettes: Motown's Mystery Girl Group by Marc Taylor {{makes it clear that}} the Marvelettes did turn it down. Gladys recalls [...] "When they played 'Where Did Our Love Go' they played 'Too Many Fish In The Sea'. We picked 'Too Many Fish In The Sea' because it had all the music and all the bongos. We were <b>all</b> <b>together</b> <b>and</b> said {{at the same time we}} didn't want 'Where Did Our Love Go'." ...|$|E
2500|$|A major {{claim to}} fame for Edelbrock was beating all the Offenhauser-powered midget cars that had {{dominated}} midget car racing for several years; this feat was remarkable because Offenhausers had a significant power advantage over all the other motors. Using his Kurtis Kraft V8-60 [...] "shaker" [...] midget car powered by a secret blend of 20% nitromethane (disguised {{with the scent of}} orange oil), Rodger Ward made history on August 10, 1950, when his Edelbrock-powered #27 car broke the winning streak of the [...] "Offy"-equipped midget cars at Gilmore Stadium, the track that originated midget car racing. This was the only V8-60 to ever beat the Offys in the Gilmore 386-Race history. The same car raced at the Orange Show Stadium in San Bernardino the following night, again beating the Offenhauser cars. This feat was never duplicated in the history of midget racing. Edelbrock was not the only racer in the period to experiment with nitromethane; fellow racers Joaquin Arnett and Tony Capanna had tried it in their hot rods, as well. Edelbrock, however, is generally considered {{to be the one who}} pulled it <b>all</b> <b>together</b> <b>and</b> made it work.|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{departure}} from Geffen, the band {{has continued to}} tour. During the summer of 2009, they launched the ambitious Saturday Night Rebel Rockers Traveling Circus and Medicine Show tour with longtime Bay Area friend Michael Franti, his band Spearhead, and the band Augustana. Instead of the traditional concert format of a short set by an opening act, followed by a longer set from a main supporting act, and then a long set by the headlining band, the shows featured members {{of all of the}} bands joining each other for songs from each bands' catalogs at various points throughout the evening. As Duritz explained in a welcoming message on the official website for the tour, each show [...] "is going to start with EVERYONE onstage together and we're going to all be running on & off stage all night playing one each other's songs <b>all</b> <b>together</b> <b>and</b> basically just playing whenever we feel like playing." [...] The success of the first tour spawned a second in the summer of 2010 with Counting Crows and Augustana joined by rock/hip-hop artist (and formally trained jazz trumpeter) NOTAR, whom Duritz had signed to his independent Tyrannosaurus Records label, in place of Franti & Spearhead.|$|E
