A Swiss referendum held on 6 December 1992 rejected EEA membership.

The popular initiative entitled [...] "Yes to Europe!", calling {{for the opening of}} immediate negotiations for EU membership, was rejected in a 4 March 2001 referendum. The Swiss Federal Council, which was in favour of EU membership, had advised the population to vote against this referendum since the preconditions for the opening of negotiations had not been met. It is thought that the fear of a loss of neutrality and independence is the key issue against membership among eurosceptics.

The accession procedure and the current status of the accession process are then discussed. Using a computable general equilibrium (CGE) modeling analysis of China’s WTO accession as a prototype, the potential use of CGE modeling of Russian accession is considered as well as Russia’s participation in the Doha Development Round and preferential trading arrangements. It is concluded that Russia may realize significant benefits from WTO accession and from the multilateral trade liberalization to be effected in the Doha Round...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{sets out}} to answer two questions: to what extend is {{competition}} policy in Estonia - one of the applicant countries for accession to the European Union - a duplication of EU policy, and has Estonia established a true competition discipline with high {{public awareness of the}} rules and effective public and private enforcement? It is shown that although Estonian antitrust policy includes some additional features to the core EU rules - both with possible positive and negative welfare consequences - one can basically really speak of a copy of EU policy both with respect to legislation and enforcement provisions. Since the EU has a long and successful tradition of fighting competition-distorting conduct, this should weigh positively in the country's <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>accession.</b> However, a real competition discipline is still lacking in Estonia. Higher public awareness, as well as a more stringent enforcement and especially sanctioning policy are necessary. ...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{reflects}} on the British attitude towards membership in the European Communities and the European Union under the premiership of Harold Macmillan and David Cameron, respectively. The theoretical section of the thesis defines the basic concepts related to the topic and presents available theoretical approaches. Closer attention is dedicated to traditional institutionalism, which defines the categories of costs and benefits {{as well as the}} sources of preferences that determine the government's decisions on ascension to the European integration process. In its practical section, the thesis outlines British opinions on individual stages and milestones of the European integration ranging from World War II to the filing of the official <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>accession</b> to the European Economic Community. The paper also identifies specific factors that participate in the decision-making process to redefine European politics under Macmillan's and Cameron's governments. The principal finding is that the two governments ascribe highly differing importance to individual types of costs and benefits and prefer different viewpoints in the decision-making process, which naturally leads to different conclusions...|$|E

40|$|The Republic of Cyprus is {{the only}} country in the European Union (EU) whose health system is {{comprised}} of public and private sectors of relatively similar sizes. The division within the health system, combined with a lack of efficient payment mechanisms and monitoring systems, contributes to inequalities in access to care, and inefficient allocation and utilization of resources. In part to address these issues, a new General Health Insurance Scheme (GHIS), was proposed by stakeholders from the Cypriot government along with a team of international consultants in 1992 and eventually approved by the Parliament in 2001. However implementation of the GHIS has been repeatedly delayed since that time due to cost concerns. In 2012, following recommendations by the European Commission, the Cypriot Cabinet decided to recommit to the reform. In light of this development, the recent Cyprus <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>accession</b> to the EU support mechanism due to the economic crisis, and the international spotlight associated with Cyprus’ EU Presidency, this article discusses the anticipated Cypriot health system reform—which is now slated to go into effect in 2016 —and examines lessons from other countries...|$|E

40|$|The {{future of}} the more western {{transition}} economies (TEs) is usually directly linked to the eastward enlargement of the European Union (EU) for two reasons. First, accession is supposed to spur on growth of the TEs, enabling them {{to catch up with}} the more developed EU members. Second, once the conditions <b>for</b> <b>accession</b> met, perhaps by 2002 or 2003, it signals in some sense successful completion of the transition toward a market economy. This paper examines the conditions <b>for</b> <b>accession</b> as spelled out at recent European Councils and subsequently elaborated in concrete recommendations by the European Commission. I show that these official conditions <b>for</b> <b>accession</b> are fuzzy and that the TEs will have to meet other, as yet unspecified, conditions that shape the profile of “suitable“ future EU members, although such candidates may well fail to exist. In addition, the negotiation process itself may modify these conditions, if only because there may be a need for derogations and transitional arrangements upon entry. ...|$|R
