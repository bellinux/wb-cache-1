25|$|During flight testing, the snag on {{the leading}} edge of the stabilators was filled in, and the gap between the leading-edge {{extensions}} (LEX) and the fuselage mostly filled in. The gaps, called the boundary layer <b>air</b> <b>discharge</b> (BLAD) slots, controlled the vortices generated by the LEX and presented clean air to the vertical stabilizers at high angles of attack, but they also generated a great deal of parasitic drag, worsening the problem of the F/A-18's inadequate range. McDonnell filled in 80% of the gap, leaving a small slot to bleed air from the engine intake. This may have contributed to early problems with fatigue cracks appearing on the vertical stabilizers due to extreme Structural loads, resulting in a short grounding in 1984 until the stabilizers were strengthened. Starting in May 1988, a small vertical fence was added to the top of each LEX to broaden the vortices and direct them away from the vertical stabilizers. This also provided a minor increase in controllability as a side effect. F/A-18s of early versions had a problem with insufficient rate of roll, exacerbated by the insufficient wing stiffness, especially with heavy underwing ordnance loads.|$|E

Whereas a round pipe with holes drilled has an average coefficient of discharge of 0.6 (60% efficient), the teardrop-shaped air knife is commonly 0.95 (95% efficient), which provides much higher-impact air velocity to the surface at which the air is directed with the lowest blower motor power demand. These teardrop designs are available in extruded aluminum shapes as well as fabricated carbon and stainless steels.|$|E

2500|$|The above {{peak voltage}} is only {{achieved}} in coils in which <b>air</b> <b>discharges</b> do not occur; in coils which produce sparks, like entertainment coils, {{the peak voltage}} on the terminal {{is limited to the}} voltage at which the air breaks down and becomes conductive. [...] As the output voltage increases during each voltage pulse, it reaches the point where the air next to the high voltage terminal ionizes and coronas, brush discharges and streamer arcs, break out from the terminal. This happens when the electric field strength exceeds the dielectric strength of the air, about 30kV per centimeter. [...] Since the electric field is greatest at sharp points and edges, <b>air</b> <b>discharges</b> start at these points on the high voltage terminal. [...] The voltage on the high voltage terminal cannot increase above the air breakdown voltage, because additional electric charge pumped into the terminal from the secondary winding just escapes into the air. [...] The output voltage of open-air Tesla coils is limited to around several million volts by air breakdown, but higher voltages can be achieved by coils immersed in pressurized tanks of insulating oil.|$|R
50|$|After {{dealing with}} coal {{shortages}} through the World War II era, the Victorian Railways reactivated earlier experiments with Pulverised Brown Coal. Locomotives X32 and R707 were modified {{to take the}} fuel, which was prepared at special plants and railed to depots as required in a small fleet of seven CK-class wagons. These vehicles {{were based on a}} standard four-wheel underframe, with two pressurised drums fitted for <b>air</b> <b>discharge</b> directly into the engine tenders. The first two were built in 1949, and a further five, CK3-CK7, entered service in 1952. At the time it was thought that a further fifteen X Class would be built or converted to run with PBC, justifying the extra expense, but the early diesel locomotives were more economic to operate on grounds of higher utilisation.|$|E
50|$|While certain {{authorisations}} {{had been}} obtained for Kaitorete, such as stormwater and <b>air</b> <b>discharge</b> permits from Environment Canterbury, a coastal permit for {{occupation of the}} area, and a Department of Conservation permit, the Christchurch City Council had not consented to the development due to an incomplete Cultural Impact Assessment, resulting in no action under Sections 95 and 104 of the Resource Management Act 1991. The company said that efforts would continue to gain consent for a launch pad on Kaitorete Spit due to its logistical superiority and the foreseen need for additional facilities, but that the Mahia site offered superior launch corridor and flight rate opportunities because of its geographical location and relatively sparse air traffic. The Mahia site is licensed for a maximum launch rate of once every 72 hours {{over a period of}} 30 years—Rocket Lab believes the actual rate would average once per week—while the Kaitorete site would only have been licensed to launch once per month.|$|E

40|$|Two {{mathematical}} {{models were}} developed to study the air distribution normal to and along an aeration duct. The airflow distribution normal to the duct was analyzed using a finite element model. Example simulations of airflow in grain piles were performed on triangular and trapezoidal pile cross sections because of their widespread use in flat storage. The equivalent radial grain depth representative of the triangular pile cross section was determined. ^ A model to predict the air distribution along the aeration duct was developed from basic principles of fluid mechanics and from experimental data for static pressure regain coefficients reported in the literature. The model handles both negative and positive pressure systems. ^ Experimental tests on a duct covered with grain were performed to verify the model for static pressure distribution along an aeration duct. ^ The predicted results using the same input data of the experimental test agreed favorably with the experimental results for both negative and positive pressure systems. ^ The effects of the various duct parameters on the uniformity of <b>air</b> <b>discharge</b> along grain aeration ducts were studied. ^ The performed analyses indicate that {{the problems of the}} static pressure distribution along aeration ducts operated under positive or negative pressure should be looked at as two different mathematical problems. This is due to the effect of the air intake or discharge on the velocity distribution across the duct diameter. ^ The total airflow delivered in a system is influenced by the duct length, duct diameter, air velocity in the duct, and grain depth. Increasing the air velocity at the duct entrance increases the airflow but contributes to the deterioration of the uniformity of <b>air</b> <b>discharge</b> along an aeration duct. The effect of the air velocity in the duct on the uniformity of <b>air</b> <b>discharge</b> is more pronounced on the negative pressure system than on the positive pressure one. ^ To deliver equal volumes of air, a large diameter duct is preferred to a small diameter one with regard to <b>air</b> <b>discharge</b> uniformity and power requirement. ^ Increasing the duct length while keeping the air delivered constant results in low airflow rate per metric ton of grain. It also results in deterioration of air distribution along a perforated duct operated under negative pressure. The air distribution along a duct operated under positive pressure may improve depending on the relative magnitudes of the friction loss and the static pressure regain. However, the airflow rate per ton of grain decreases with increase of duct length. ^ An increase in wall roughness results in deterioration of uniformity of <b>air</b> <b>discharge</b> along a duct operated under negative pressure. It slightly improves the <b>air</b> <b>discharge</b> distribution along a duct operated under positive pressure. Excessive increase in wall roughness reverses the problem of the air distribution without solving it, the end result being waste of energy. The increase in roughness of both duct wall and the perforations increases the static pressure requirement sharply. ^ Increasing the grain depth improves the <b>air</b> <b>discharge</b> uniformity for both negative and positive pressure systems. Delivering the recommended average airflow rate may be the limiting factor for increasing the grain depth beyond a certain depth using a particular duct diameter. ^ The main concern when operating positive or negative pressure systems should be the total airflow delivered together with the uniformity of <b>air</b> <b>discharge</b> and the power requirement. ^ Comparing the positive and negative pressure systems, it has been concluded that the positive pressure system gives better air uniformity at lower power requirement, assuming all other variables are the same. ...|$|E
40|$|In active chilled beams, {{primary air}} from the air {{handling}} unit induces room air which passes a cooling coil before it mixes with the primary <b>air</b> and <b>discharges</b> into the room.

The purpose of the work presented in this paper is to investigate whether other operating conditions also influence the IR.
