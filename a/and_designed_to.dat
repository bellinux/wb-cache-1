5|$|In March 2015, the Department of Justice and Equality {{published}} the general scheme of a Marriage Bill 2015. The bill {{set out the}} changes {{to be made to}} legislation if the proposed amendment was approved. These changes included removing the existing legislative bar on same-sex couples marrying (though the wording of the amendment is self-executing <b>and</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> invalidate it irrespective of legislative delay), addressing the situation of civil partnership, and updating terminology of existing legislation to reflect the new provision.|$|E

5|$|Skis are lighter, {{narrower}} <b>and</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> {{be faster}} than {{those used in}} recreational cross-country skiing and made of composite materials. For classic events, typical ski lengths are between 195 and 210 centimetres, while ski lengths for skating are 170 to 200cm. Skis for skating are also more rigid than skis for classical. Skis are waxed for speed and, {{in the case of}} classic skis, traction when striding forward. Racing ski boots are also lighter than recreational ones and are attached at the toe only to bindings that are specialized for classic or skate skiing.|$|E

5|$|The church did {{not want}} to sell its former home to just anyone, or for it to be torn down. At this time the city was looking for a space to use as an arts center. Plans for an arts and culture center in Hillsboro were made in the city’s Hillsboro 2020 Vision. This {{community}} plan was finalized in 2000 <b>and</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> improve the livability of the city located in the Portland metropolitan area. Hillsboro purchased the property from the church for $1.325 million in November 2000.|$|E

Wallis later discovered forged letters purportedly sent by him <b>and</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> implicate him in controversial acts. Wallis assumed this was a reaction by the Guardian's Office to The Road to Total Freedom.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, after {{receiving}} {{approval from the}} government, the Parks Commission began to expropriate land {{along the length of}} the river. The broadened strip of land was used to construct a new paved parkway, which was opened in segments. The new parkway was ornamental <b>and</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> be aesthetically pleasing, a prime consideration of road construction at that time. The section south of the falls was completed first, opening in 1912. It was extended north to the Whirlpool Rapids, incorporating the existing River Road, by 1915. The section between the rapids and Queenston was opened between 1921 and 1923. Finally, the remaining section between Queenston and Niagara-on-the-Lake opened in 1931, completing the present parkway.|$|E
5|$|In {{the town}} of Zoah, Edge meets an engineer, Paet, who will trade {{information}} about the Tower for ancient artifacts. Searching an ancient vessel for parts, Edge is captured by imperial soldiers but rescued by Gash. Paet reveals that the Tower {{can be reached via}} the ruins of Uru; there, Edge and the dragon are attacked again by the girl and Atolm. After the battle, separated from their dragons, he and the girl fall into an ancient underground facility and form a truce to escape. The girl explains that she is an ancient bio-engineered being named Azel, created in the facility <b>and</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> interface with ancient technology. After Edge's dragon rescues them, Azel warns Edge that she will kill him if he crosses Craymen's path again and leaves on Atolm.|$|E

5|$|The {{building}} did {{not last}} very long—damage to the Inn during the Blitz completely destroyed the Library and {{a large part of}} its collection, although the rare manuscripts, which had been moved elsewhere, survived. After the destruction of much of the Inn's collection, George VI donated replacements for many lost texts. A prefabricated building in the Walks was used to hold the surviving books while a new Library was constructed, and the new building (designed by Sir Edward Maufe) was opened in 1958. It is similar in size to the old Holker Library, but is more workmanlike <b>and</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> allow for easy access to the books.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the machine was very complicated <b>and</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> mislead those who observed it. When opened on the left, the front doors of the cabinet exposed a number of gears and cogs similar to clockwork. The section was designed so that if the back doors of the cabinet were open {{at the same time}} one could see through the machine. The other side of the cabinet did not house machinery; instead it contained a red cushion and some removable parts, as well as brass structures. This area was also designed to provide a clear line of vision through the machine. Underneath the robes of the Ottoman model, two other doors were hidden. These also exposed clockwork machinery and provided a similarly unobstructed view through the machine. The design allowed the presenter of the machine to open every available door to the public, to maintain the illusion.|$|E
5|$|The {{preceding}} German large cruiser design, , was {{an incremental}} increase over previous armored cruisers. Blücher was armed with twelve 21cm(8.3in) guns, <b>and</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> counter what the Germans {{knew about the}} British , which were assumed to be larger iterations of the basic armored cruiser type. Once sufficient information about the new British cruisers became available, {{it was obvious that}} they were not simply an enlargement on previous designs but a whole new type of warship—the battlecruiser—to which Blücher was quite inferior. However, there were insufficient funds to alter Blüchers layout, so the cruiser assigned for 1907 would have to be an entirely new design.|$|E

5|$|When the Phase II {{series was}} in development, {{original}} series designer Matt Jefferies updated the Enterprise design to feature a larger saucer with twin elevators (turbolifts) to the bridge, a wider secondary hull, docking ports, a dedicated photon torpedo weapon assembly {{at the base}} of the ship's neck, and angled struts supporting the nacelles. The nacelles themselves were completely changed to less cylindrical shapes <b>and</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> feature glowing grilles on the sides. Likewise, an orbiting drydock, space office complex, and V'ger has been designed by artist Mike Minor. At the time Phase II was cancelled a roughly five foot long model of the Enterprise was under construction by Don Loos of Brick Price Movie Miniatures, and models of the drydock and V'ger were under construction as well. All of these models were abandoned, unfinished (although a Brick Price Enterprise was repurposed as the exploded Enterprise wreck in Star Trek III: The Search for Spock).|$|E
5|$|While {{mourning}} Roth, Lara accepts {{that the}} storms are not natural, but are somehow {{connected to the}} Sun Queen <b>and</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> prevent anyone from leaving the island. She meets up with her friends (Reyes, Jonah, Alex, and Sam), who have evaded the Solarii long enough to secure a boat for escaping the island, provided {{that it can be}} repaired. They are joined by Whitman, who claims to have escaped, though Lara begins to suspect him of working with the cultists. Lara joins Alex in finding parts for the boat in the wreck of the Endurance. She finds him injured and stuck under some rubble. They come under attack by the Solarii and Alex triggers an explosion, sacrificing himself so that Lara can escape with the tools.|$|E
5|$|In 1932 Wilkinson {{was invited}} by the India League {{to join a}} small delegation, to report on {{conditions}} in India. During the three-month visit she met Gandhi, then in prison, and became convinced that his co-operation was essential to any prospect of peace in the subcontinent. On her return home she delivered her conclusions in an uncompromising report, The Condition of India, published in 1934. She visited Germany shortly after Hitler {{came to power in}} 1933, and published a pamphlet, The Terror in Germany, that documented early incidents of Nazi outrage. She collaborated with a refugee from Hitler's Germany, Edward Conze, to produce a major book, Why Fascism?, which condemned the Labour Party's gradualism and focus upon parliament as well as the failure of communist strategy, arguing for the need for grassroots workers' unity and revolution to check the threat of fascism across Europe. Meanwhile, her parliamentary prospects had been revived by her selection as Labour candidate for Jarrow, a Tyneside shipbuilding town. Jarrow had been devastated early in the 1930s by the run-down and closure of Palmers shipyard, the town's main source of employment. Early in 1934 Wilkinson led a deputation of Jarrow's unemployed to meet the prime minister, MacDonald, in his nearby Seaham constituency, and received sympathy but no positive action. She was unimpressed by the government's Special Areas Act, passed late in 1934 <b>and</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> assist distressed areas such as Jarrow; she thought the legislation provided inadequate funding, and benefited employers more than workers.|$|E
