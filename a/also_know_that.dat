500|$|Gore's use of long ice core {{records of}} CO2 and {{temperature}} (from oxygen isotope measurements) in Antarctic ice cores {{to illustrate the}} correlation between the two drew some scrutiny; Schmidt, Steig and Michael E. Mann back up Gore's data. [...] "Gore stated that the greenhouse gas levels and temperature changes over ice age signals had a complex relationship but that they 'fit'. Both of these statements are true," [...] said Schmidt and Mann. [...] "The complexity though is actually quite fascinating...a full understanding of why CO2 changes in precisely the pattern that it does during ice ages is elusive, but among the most plausible explanations is that increased received solar radiation in the southern hemisphere due to changes in Earth‚Äôs orbital geometry warms the southern ocean, releasing CO2 into the atmosphere, which then leads to further warming through an enhanced greenhouse effect. Gore‚Äôs terse explanation of course does not mention such complexities, but the crux of his point‚Äìthat the observed long-term relationship between CO2 and temperature in Antarctica supports our understanding of the warming impact of increased CO2 concentrations‚Äìis correct. Moreover, our knowledge of why CO2 is changing now (fossil fuel burning) is solid. We <b>also</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> CO2 is a greenhouse gas, and that the carbon cycle feedback is positive (increasing temperatures lead to increasing CO2 and CH4), implying that future changes in CO2 will be larger than we might anticipate." [...] "Gore is careful not to state what the temperature/CO2 scaling is," [...] said Steig. [...] "He is making a qualitative point, which is entirely accurate. The fact is that it would be difficult or impossible to explain past changes in temperature during the ice age cycles without CO2 changes. In that sense, the ice core CO2-temperature correlation remains an appropriate demonstration of the influence of CO2 on climate." ...|$|E
