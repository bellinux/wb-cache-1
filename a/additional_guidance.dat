Participants meet people with similar interests, live on the same floor and take courses with others in their community, while receiving <b>additional</b> <b>guidance</b> related to those interests. The university's Learning Community programs are divided into two categories, Freshman Learning Communities and Living Learning Communities. The freshman program offers 16 different concentrations, including business, nursing, and education. The Living program offers six concentrations for students residing in the Heritage Park Towers dormitory, including engineering, computer science, and a Women's Leadership program.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, Florence Ballard—a {{junior high}} school student living in the Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects in Detroit—met Paul Williams and Eddie Kendricks, two members of a Detroit male singing group known as the Primes. Since Ballard sang, as did Paul Williams' girlfriend Betty McGlown, the Primes's manager Milton Jenkins decided to create a sister group to the Primes called the Primettes. Ballard {{recruited}} her best friend Mary Wilson, who in turn recruited classmate Diane Ross. Mentored and funded by Jenkins, the Primettes began by performing hit songs by artists such as Ray Charles and the Drifters at sock hops, social clubs and talent shows around the Detroit area. Receiving <b>additional</b> <b>guidance</b> from group friend and established songwriter Jesse Greer, the quartet quickly earned a local fan following. The girls crafted an age-appropriate style that {{was inspired by the}} collegiate dress of popular doo-wop group Frankie Lymon & the Teenagers; and, for the most part, Ballard, Ross and Wilson performed equal leads on songs. Within a few months, guitarist Marvin Tarplin was added to the Primettes' lineup—a move that helped distinguish the group from Detroit's many other aspiring acts by allowing the girls to sing live instead of lip-synching.|$|E

500|$|The Supreme Court {{provided}} <b>additional</b> <b>guidance</b> on the [...] "totality of the circumstances" [...] test in Johnson v. De Grandy (1994). The Court {{emphasized that}} the existence of the three Gingles preconditions may be insufficient to prove liability for vote dilution through submergence if other factors weigh against such a determination, especially in lawsuits challenging redistricting plans. In particular, the Court held that even where the three Gingles preconditions are satisfied, a jurisdiction is unlikely to be liable for vote dilution if its redistricting plan contains a number of majority-minority districts that is proportional to the minority group's population. The decision thus clarified that Section 2 does not require jurisdictions to maximize the number of majority-minority districts. The opinion also distinguished the proportionality of majority-minority districts, which allows minorities to have a proportional opportunity to elect their candidates of choice, from the proportionality of election results, which Section 2 explicitly does not guarantee to minorities.|$|E

He was unreliable from Pini's perspective, and looked to Austria for <b>additional</b> <b>guidance.</b> As the Eterists and the National Party colluded in the build-up to the Greek Revolution, the Filipescus withdrew from the intrigues. In June 1820, by his own admission, Dimitrie Macedonski wanted to co-opt Alecu into a rebellion against Soutzos and the Phanariotes. Filipescu agreed on principle that [...] "it would be possible and rather good that we remove this country of ours from the yoke of [...] tyrants"; still, he adamantly refused to be involved beyond this statement, feeling himself betrayed by the National Party. However, with Pini's assurances and possibly seeking appointment in a revolutionary government, he abetted the Eterists, without formally rejoining their movement.|$|E

Ellington was also inspired by his first encounters with stride pianists James P. Johnson and Luckey Roberts. Later in New York he took advice from Will Marion Cook, Fats Waller, and Sidney Bechet. Ellington started to play gigs in cafés and clubs in and around Washington, D.C.

40|$|Actuators {{for small}} machine tools usually need {{separate}} guidance elements since they cannot carry transversal loads. Hence, cross section and mass {{as well as}} the complexity of the actuator system increase. In the paper we present a novel Shape-Memory-Alloy (SMA) actuator design, which does rather not require <b>additional</b> <b>guidances.</b> The stiffness in directions different from the actuators moving direction is realized by the geometric arrangement of the SMA elements. Those are designed by general formulations regarding the requested degrees of freedom, geometry, applied load, and control aspects. To evaluate this general design approach a multi domain model of a linear actuator is developed. That covers not just the mechanical part of the arrangement; but also the transient behavior of the SMA. Beyond that an adaptive closed loop control concept for positioning applications, which considers the nonlinear positioning behavior of SMA actuators, is developed and implemented. Furthermore, a linear actuator is designed to validate the design approach experimentally and to investigate the actuators capabilities to serve as miniaturized drive...|$|R

40|$|Cardiovascular {{surgeons}} increasingly {{resort to}} catheter-based diagnostic and therapeutic interventions {{because of their}} limited invasiveness. Although, these approaches allow treatment of patients considered unfit for conventional open surgery, exposure to radiation and high procedural complexity could lead to complications. These factors motivated the introduction of robotic technology offering more dexterous catheters, enhanced visualization and opening new possibilities in terms of guidance and coordinated control. In addition to improvements of patient outcome, through teleoperated catheter control radiation exposure of surgeons can be reduced. In order to limit surgical workload, intuitive mappings between joystick input and resulting catheter motion are essential. This paper presents and compares two proposed mappings and investigates the benefits of <b>additional</b> visual <b>guidance.</b> The comparison is based on data gathered during an experimental campaign involving 14 novices and three surgeons. The {{participants were asked to}} perform an endovascular task in a virtual reality simulator presented {{in the first part of}} this paper.
