40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore why <b>audit</b> <b>assistants</b> leave the <b>audit</b> profession. By {{including}} both the perceptions held by <b>audit</b> <b>assistants</b> that left the audit profession and the perceptions of <b>audit</b> <b>assistants</b> still working in the audit profession, this study aims to explore how determinants of job satisfaction are associated with decisions to leave the audit profession. Design/methodology/approach - To explore the association between determinants of job satisfaction and decisions to leave, a survey was developed based on a literature review of determinants of job satisfaction. The survey was sent to both current and former Swedish <b>audit</b> <b>assistants.</b> The subsequent analysis was based on 231 complete surveys, of which 78 were from former <b>audit</b> <b>assistants.</b> Findings - The main finding of this study is that there is a negative association between the choice to leave the profession and <b>audit</b> <b>assistants</b> perceptions of the profession and between the choice to leave and work-life balance. Another finding was thatmet expectations and Big 4 were found to be positively associated with career change. Originality/value - By approaching both current and former <b>audit</b> <b>assistants,</b> this study contributes to the literature on audit employee turnover by exploring determinants of actual career change, rather than turnover intentions. It also contributes by identifying and testing a variable not previously used as a determinant of job satisfaction, namely, perceptions of the audit profession...|$|R
40|$|This study {{attempts}} to understand factors influencing Malaysian auditors' ethical behavior, i. e., code of ethical conduct, {{people at the}} office or those at homes. The relationship between demographic traits of respondents and their perceptions on peers' unethical behavior are studied as the integrity of auditors will affect investors' perception of financial statements. Three hundred and ninety six questionnaires were distributed to Certified Public Accountants whose membership information indicated auditing specialties. The findings revealed that those with a major responsibility (i. e., Senior <b>Audit</b> <b>Assistants)</b> behave more ethically than those with a lesser duty-bound answerability (i. e., <b>audit</b> <b>assistants).</b> The survey revealed that <b>audit</b> <b>assistants</b> are repeatedly engaged in unethical behavior compared to senior managers who rarely engaged in such behavior.

Incorrect expectations of the job can create a lot of damage since it decreases the trust and leads to more criticism towards the audit profession. Education for both auditors and stakeholders has been suggested as a solution, however, something that hasn’t been investigated as thoroughly is the education for future auditors, i. e. students and auditor assistants, and how the education at both the university and the workplace affects their knowledge and expectation gap. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study is}} to describe the audit expectation gap of future auditors, i. e. students and auditor assistants, concerning current regulations and practices. Method: The study was to some extent based on previous research about the audit expectation gap and socialization process etc., however, since the research is limited we developed our own model on both quantitative and qualitative research. Results and conclusions: This study confirms the existence of an audit expectation gap for future auditors concerning current regulations and practices. Our main contribution is our model that shows factors which has an affect the gap. The three most prominent factors are type of education, grade and age. Throughout this study students’ with work integrated learning showed greater knowledge than those with traditional theoretical education. The findings prove that the different audit firms’ socialization processes don’t affect the knowledge of their <b>audit</b> <b>assistants.</b> As a solution to bridge the gap for future auditors we suggest additional qualitative education. ...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{design an}} audit {{questionnaire}} and pilot its use by an <b>audit</b> <b>assistant</b> to monitor inpatient management of acute asthma and {{to compare the}} care given by chest physicians and general physicians. DESIGN [...] Retrospective review by a chest physician and <b>audit</b> <b>assistant</b> of {{a random sample of}} 76 case records of patients by a criterion based questionnaire developed from hospital guidelines on management of acute asthma. SETTING [...] One district general hospital. PATIENTS [...] 76 adult patients with acute asthma: 38 admitted with a relevant primary diagnosis between April 1988 and March 1989 and a further 38 admitted through the accident and emergency department between April 1989 and March 1990. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Conformity with recognised standards for assessment and management of acute asthma before and after the audit and by chest physicians and general physicians. RESULTS [...] Age and sex did not differ significantly between the different groups of patients. Overall, deviations from the guidelines occurred in recording measures of severity of asthma, emergency treatment with beta 2 agonists (60 / 76, 79 %) and steroids (43 / 76, 57 %), and prescription of antibiotics in accordance with at least one criterion of the guidelines (29 / 45, 64 %). Chest physicians were more rigorous than general physicians in recording severity measures, especially serum potassium concentration (chi 2 = 3. 6, df = 1, p = 0. 06), emergency steroid treatment within the correct period (chi 2 = 3. 9, df = 1, p = 0. 05), and referral for follow up at an outpatient chest clinic. Recording of arterial blood gas tensions improved significantly between the 1988 - 9 and 1989 - 90 samples (chi 2 = 7. 0, df = 1, p = 0. 08).

Because rural residents live farther from supermarkets than their urban- and suburban-dwelling counterparts, they may be more reliant on smaller corner stores that offer fewer healthful food items. Methods As part of a Communities Putting Prevention to Work (CPPW) healthy corner store initiative, we reviewed audit tools in the fall of 2010 to measure the consumer food environment in eastern North Carolina and chose the NEMS-S-Rev (Nutrition Environment Measures Survey-Stores-Revised) to assess 42 food stores.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop and {{evaluate}} an information system for monitoring impact of acute hospital care on health status of elderly patients, burden on carers, and consumer satisfaction with care. The study was undertaken on four acute care wards of an elderly care unit of a teaching hospital. We used a consensus-building process to achieve within-and-between-team convergence of policy and practice in the use of structured assessments on three wards, with parallel data collection by a research nurse on one ward. We describe the changes to our working practices, the costs of data collection, staff attitudes to the system and the assessment instruments, using 5 -point Likert Scales, with additional in-depth interviews with senior staff for their attitudes to the system. We found that only nursing staff were able to change their practice. On admission, it was feasible to undertake functional assessment of activities of daily living (ADL), depression, perceived life quality and carer strain. Discharge assessment was only feasible for ADL. Other discharge assessments and follow-up assessments including consumer satisfaction interviews required <b>audit</b> <b>assistant</b> support. The total annual cost per ward was £ 6, 225 for the adopted system, or £ 6, 455 to incorporate follow-up assessments by <b>audit</b> <b>assistant</b> in a random sample of 50 patients. Staff attitudes to the system were positive, especially for use of the Relatives' Stress Scale, and for the value of follow-up interviews. We conclude that the participatory approach to the introduction of the information system produced a system which was perceived to be beneficial for patient care. The system has potential for measuring the outcomes of care, but greater efficiency is required before the system can be regarded as cost-effective...|$|E
40|$|The {{auditing}} profession {{is a popular}} career choice among business graduates, and the Big N firms hire large cohorts of audit assistants every year. The {{auditing profession}} is special {{in the way that}} it has a defined career ladder, as well as a high employee turnover rate. The hiring process involves contact both with the HR department and auditors from the operating business. Since the audit assistants are not expected to have great technical knowledge {{at the beginning of their}} employment, other things than the actual auditing skills must be tested during the hiring process.    In prior research, studies have been conducted from the perspective of the applicant, rather than the organizational perspective. There has been relatively little research on the recruitment of auditors, and most research has been conducted in another context than a Swedish one. The research question used for this thesis is: How do audit firms hire entry-level audit assistants, and what profile is desired by the HR department and the operating business?   The main purposes of this study are to explore the hiring process and what profile is desired, from both the HR department’s perspective and the operating business’ perspective. The study is qualitative, and the data was collected through semi-structured interviews with delegates from the largest audit firms in Sweden. The sample consisted of eleven informants including seven auditors and four recruiters.   The empirical findings suggest that the Big N firms in Sweden hire through a centralized HR-department, with a standardized process that is similar among all the firms. A lot of responsibility lies with the HR-department, but the auditors make the final determination if the applicant will fit into the group. The most important characteristics desired of an <b>audit</b> <b>assistant</b> are found to be social skills, team ability, and dedication, and these are assessed at the different steps of the hiring process. Finally, the findings suggest that the HR department and the delegates from the operating business of the HR firms agree on what profile they are looking for, however, there is no formal way of evaluating the hiring process in any of the firms. The contributions of this thesis can be of use for various actors, for example audit firms when developing their hiring strategies, regulatory authorities when discussing the development of the industry and educational bodies and students when preparing for a career within auditing. From an academic perspective, this study can be used as a point of departure for future research...|$|E
40|$|Introduction : Although many {{protocols}} {{are available}} in the field of the prehospital medical care (PMC), there is still a notable gap between protocol based directions and applied clinical practice. This study measures the rate of protocol adherence in PMC provided for patients with chest pain and loss of consciousness (LOC). Method : In this cross-sectional study, 10 educated research <b>assistants</b> <b>audited</b> the situation of provided PMC for non-traumatic chest pain and LOC patients, presenting to the emergency department of a tertiary level teaching hospital, compare to national recommendations in these regards. Results : 101 cases with the mean age of 56. 7 ± 12. 3 years (30 - 78) were audited (55. 4 % male). 61 (60. 3 %) patients had chest pain and 40 (39. 7 %) cases had LOC. Protocol adherence rates for cardiac monitoring (62. 3 %), O 2 therapy (32. 8 %), nitroglycerin administration (60. 7 %), and aspirin administration (52. 5 %) in prehospital care of patients with chest pain were fair to poor. Protocol adherence rates for correct patient positioning (25 %), O 2 therapy (75 %), cardiac monitoring (25 %), pupils examination (25 %), bedside glucometery (50 %), and assessing for naloxone administration (55 %) in prehospital care of patients with LOC were fair to poor. Conclusion : There were more than 20 % protocol violation regarding prehospital care of chest pain patients regarding cardiac monitoring, O 2 therapy, and nitroglycerin and aspirin administration. There were same situation regarding O 2 therapy, positioning, cardiac monitoring, pupils examination, bedside glucometery, and assessing for naloxone administration of LOC patients in prehospital setting...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Falls are {{the most}} {{frequent}} adverse event reported in hospitals. Approximately 30 % of in-hospital falls lead to an injury and up to 2 % result in a fracture. A large randomised trial found that a trained health professional providing individualised falls prevention education to older inpatients reduced falls in a cognitively intact subgroup. This study aims to investigate whether this efficacious intervention can reduce falls and be clinically useful and cost-effective when delivered in the real-life clinical environment. Methods: A stepped-wedge cluster randomised trial will be used across eight subacute units (clusters) which will be randomised to one of four dates to start the intervention. Usual care on these units includes patient's screening, assessment and implementation of individualised falls prevention strategies, ongoing staff training and environmental strategies. Patients with better levels of cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination > 23 / 30) will receive the individualised education from a trained health professional in addition to usual care while patient's feedback received during education sessions will be provided to unit staff. Unit staff will receive training to assist in intervention delivery and to enhance uptake of strategies by patients. Falls data will be collected by two methods: case note <b>audit</b> by research <b>assistants</b> and the hospital falls reporting system. Cluster-level data including patient's admissions, length of stay and diagnosis will be collected from hospital systems. Data will be analysed allowing for correlation of outcomes (clustering) within units. An economic analysis will be undertaken which includes an incremental cost-effectiveness analysis. Ethics and dissemination: The study was approved by The University of Notre Dame Australia Human Research Ethics Committee and local hospital ethics committees. Results: The results will be disseminated through local site networks, and future funding and delivery of falls prevention programmes within WA Health will be informed. Results will also be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and medical conferences...|$|R
