25|$|Otonashi {{is asked}} to join the SSS by its founder and leader Yuri Nakamura. The SSS fight against Kanade Tachibana, also {{referred}} to as Angel, the student council president of the afterlife school whose responsibilities require her to suppress the team's disruptive activities. Although the SSS initially views Kanade as their enemy, Otonashi eventually befriends her and she joins the SSS. Following this, Otonashi begins helping the other SSS members overcome <b>any</b> <b>regrets</b> they had in life so they can move on. In the process, Otonashi grows closer to the other characters as he learns more about them. Although the story contains romantic plot lines between Otonashi and each of the heroines, the pasts and conflicts of the characters are not meant to simply enliven the romantic elements, but also provide a significance that goes beyond romance.|$|E
500|$|Although Lenore {{had been}} more {{independent}} than many women of the time, she later stated that she [...] "never had <b>any</b> <b>regrets</b> about giving up movies." [...] Another time {{she said that she}} had never had a choice of both marriage and an acting career: [...] "In an acting career, I would have been upstaging him, and he couldn't stand that. It was never either and; it was always either or." [...] George would later consider his successful seven-year courtship of her to be his greatest sales achievement.|$|E

500|$|Qureshi was {{initially}} scheduled {{to make her}} film debut with Billa II, a Tamil gangster-thriller, directed and produced by Chakri Toleti, after surviving an audition out of 700 candidates. Although cast as the female lead, when the film was delayed, Qureshi left the project to honour other work commitments. When asked whether she had <b>any</b> <b>regrets,</b> she said: [...] "I have no regrets. I wish it had worked out, but it didn't. I am not someone who sits and laments over things. I was approached for several other south films too, but the roles weren't what I was looking for".|$|E
500|$|... "We {{dared to}} hope we had invented {{something}} that would bring lasting peace to the earth. But we were wrong... No, I don't have <b>any</b> <b>regrets</b> about my part in {{the invention of the}} airplane, though no one could deplore more than I do the destruction it has caused. I feel about the airplane much the same as I do in regard to fire. That is, I regret all the terrible damage caused by fire, but I think it is good for the human race that someone discovered how to start fires and that we have learned how to put fire to thousands of important uses." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{graduating from}} Notre Dame in 2000, Dunst {{continued}} the acting career {{that she had}} begun. As a teenager, she {{found it difficult to}} deal with her rising fame, and for a period she blamed her mother for pushing her into acting as a child. However, she later expressed that her mother [...] "always had the best intentions". When asked if she had <b>any</b> <b>regrets</b> about the way she spent her childhood, Dunst said: [...] "Well, it's not a natural way to grow up, but it's the way I grew up and I wouldn't change it. I have my stuff to work out... I don't think anybody can sit around and say, 'My life is more screwed up than yours.' Everybody has their issues." ...|$|E

6000|$|If Aunt Rebecca {{had shown}} <b>any</b> <b>regret</b> {{at the thought}} of Jane Lavinia's departure, Jane Lavinia would have foregone New York on the spot. But Aunt Rebecca only said coldly, [...] "I guess you needn't worry over that. I can get along well enough." ...|$|R

He joined Gateshead on a free transfer, signing for the club alongside Eddie Odhiambo; the two had previously played alongside each other at Oxford United, Stevenage, and Newport County.

Gateshead is a good club that is moving in the right direction and I'm sure we can kick on next season. I don't look back with <b>any</b> <b>regrets</b> as things happen for a reason. I am always looking forward. Gateshead is a new challenge for me and I can only see good things coming from it". He made his Gateshead debut on 13 August 2011 in the club's 3–2 away win against Kidderminster Harriers at Aggborough, assisting Kris Gate's goal in the 80th minute. Odubade scored his first goal for Gateshead three days later at Gateshead International Stadium in Gateshead's 3–0 win against Mansfield Town, which was voted Goal of the Season in the club's end of season awards.

Despite the injuries, he made 34 appearances throughout the season, scoring seven times. He signed a one-year contract extension with Gateshead in May 2012.|$|E

6000|$|... "I think not," [...] John Thorndyke said gravely. [...] "I {{am doing}} {{my duty to}} the village, and still more I am doing my duty to an old friend, and I am not likely ever to feel <b>any</b> <b>regret</b> that I have so acted. Now, Parson, let's be off." ...|$|R

2500|$|Shortly {{before her}} death, Binchy told The Irish Times: [...] "I don't have <b>any</b> <b>regrets</b> about any roads I didn't take.

I've been very lucky and I {{have a happy}} old age with good family and friends still around." [...] Just before dying, she read her latest short story at the Dalkey Book Festival. She once said {{she would like to}} die [...] "...on my 100th birthday, piloting Gordon and myself into the side of a mountain".|$|E
2500|$|The idea {{of killing}} Supergirl was first {{conceived}} by DC's vice president/executive editor Dick Giordano, who lobbied {{for the death}} to DC's publishers. He later said he has never had <b>any</b> <b>regrets</b> about this, explaining, [...] "Supergirl was created initially {{to take advantage of}} the high Superman sales and not much thought was put into her creation. She was created essentially as a female Superman. With time, writers and artists improved upon her execution, but she never did really add anything to the Superman mythos—at least not for me." [...] The poor initial reception of the 1984 film Supergirl was also blamed by some sources.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in {{solitude}} {{on what had}} passed. He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motives his cousin could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other way.

2500|$|Asked {{if he had}} <b>any</b> <b>regrets,</b> he said: [...] "If I {{had seen}} the banking crisis coming. Nobody advised me, no economist, all those people now writing books saying 'I told you so' – none of them." [...] On Anglo Irish Bank, he said: [...] "I can {{honestly}} say that not once did anyone or any delegation that came in to see me ever say, ‘Watch out for Anglo’ ... I wish they had have." [...] Referring to the [...] "great economic storm" [...] currently under way in Ireland, he warned against excessive pessimism: [...] "Some gains have been lost, but in truth many remain.

2500|$|As from May 2010 Clapton {{was writing}} his autobiography, which {{he hoped would}} appear later that year.

He told Paul Cashmere of Noise11.com [...] "I went through a really miserable divorce ... I wrote a couple of songs like 'Over the Borderline' which was a last ditch attempt to make amends with my ex-wife. The divorce got very long and drawn out. It went on for about five years which is just absurd". On 1 August 2014 Clapton wrote his autobiography, The Best Years of Our Lives, which was published by Allen & Unwin.|$|E
2500|$|However, not all {{opinions}} on the subject among prominent mountaineers are strictly negative.

Everest" [...] and claimed that [...] "Having people pay $65,000 and then be led up the mountain by a couple of experienced guides...isn't really mountaineering at all", nevertheless noted that he was pleased by the changes brought to Everest area by Westerners, [...] "I don't have <b>any</b> <b>regrets</b> because I worked very hard indeed to improve the condition for the local people. When we first went in there they didn't have any schools, they didn't have any medical facilities, all over the years we have established 27 schools, we have two hospitals and a dozen medical clinics and then we've built bridges over wild mountain rivers and put in fresh water pipelines so in cooperation with the Sherpas we've done a lot to benefit them." ...|$|E
5000|$|Speaking {{of their}} victims at trial, Volkovich stated that [...] "they were nothing to me, not people, just items in a list". He then added that murders became {{like a drug}} to him.

60|$|Mela {{went on to}} eat her {{breakfast with}} her own good appetite. She now always came down to keep her father company, as she said, and she {{did her best to}} cheer and comfort him. At least she kept the talk going, and she had it nearly all to herself, for Mrs. Mandel was now merely staying on provisionally, and, in the absence of <b>any</b> <b>regrets</b> or excuses from Christine, was looking ruefully forward to the moment when she must leave even this ungentle home for the chances of the ruder world outside.|$|E
60|$|This {{was enough}} to set Elizabeth {{thinking}}, and in thinking she seized hold of the idea, at one feminine bound, that the caged bird had been brought by Henchard for her as a wedding gift and token of repentance. He had not expressed to her <b>any</b> <b>regrets</b> or excuses {{for what he had}} done in the past; but it was a part of his nature to extenuate nothing, and live on as one of his own worst accusers. She went out, looked at the cage, buried the starved little singer, and from that hour her heart softened towards the self-alienated man.|$|E

Well, the bit of parchment is sold, Bob has got his in its place, while the difference in price is in my pocket, and no more need be said--and here come our dear girls, Wilhelmina, to prevent <b>any</b> <b>regrets.</b> The father of two such daughters ought, at least, to be happy." ...|$|E
