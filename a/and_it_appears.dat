5|$|Documents {{from the}} Crusader period {{indicate}} that Ashdod {{belonged to the}} lordship of Ramla, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> probable that in 1169 the old Arab sea fort was given by Hugh, lord of Ramla, to his knight Nicolas de Beroard. From this period the fort is known as Castellum Beroart.|$|E

5|$|In 2008, {{as part of}} the Tawani Foundation 2008 Antarctic International Expedition (see below), Dale Andersen and Ian Hawes {{discovered}} conical stromatolites {{growing in}} Lake Untersee, the largest living ones known to date. Small microbial pinnacles are also present, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> that the large conical stromatolites and the small pinnacles are made by different microbial communities. These communities provide an important analog to some of the oldest fossil stromatolites found to date.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that Thomas was still at the papal court when the cathedral chapter of the diocese of Ross were carrying out their elections for the successor of Robert de Fyvie. Two separate elections {{took place in the}} period between 17 November 1292 and 18 November 1295, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> that the chapter elected both the cathedral precentor, Adam de Darlington, as well as Thomas de Dundee, who then held a canonry in the diocese.|$|E
5|$|RAD {{is one of}} {{the least}} {{researched}} and most poorly understood disorders in the DSM. There is little systematic epidemiologic information on RAD, its course is not well established <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> difficult to diagnose accurately. There is a lack of clarity about the presentation of attachment disorders over the age of five years and difficulty in distinguishing between aspects of attachment disorders, disorganized attachment or the consequences of maltreatment.|$|E

5|$|The {{causeway}} {{was originally}} a toll road, and costs for crossing ranged from one penny (1d) {{for a person}} on foot to 6d for a horse-drawn cart. The tolls were subject to an additional levy of 50 per cent during the night hours. The tolls were later removed, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> to have been Perth's only toll road.|$|E
5|$|The single reel comedy, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on January 6, 1911. The film had a wide national release; advertising theaters are known in Indiana, North Carolina, South Dakota, Iowa, Pennsylvania, and Texas. In Arizona, the film would be advertised by one theatre as Baseball Bloomers <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> to also {{have been the case}} in another Kansas theater. The film would also be shown in Hawaii in August 1912.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} {{paintings}} on {{the north and south}} walls depicting the Camoys family. Camoys was the lord of the manor <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> he had the church built primarily for his family. This would explain the unusual detail in the paintings. They were intended as rich decoration rather than simply for educating an illiterate congregation.|$|E

5|$|Writing around 1200, Niketas Choniates equated {{the office}} with the Western marshal, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> to have been used interchangeably with the latter title in the Latin Empire and the other Latin states formed after the Fourth Crusade. The office {{continued}} to exist during the Palaiologan period until the Fall of Constantinople in 1453. It remained {{one of the highest}} dignities of state, ranking eighth overall in the hierarchy, although from the late 13th century on, multiple persons could hold it.|$|E
5|$|A near-contemporary {{account of}} Æthelwig's life, or Vita, is {{included}} in the Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham, the monastic chronicle for Evesham Abbey. This was a 13th-century work by Thomas of Marlborough, which was written to bolster the Evesham's case for exemption from the jurisdiction of the Bishops of Worcester, in whose diocese Evensham was. In order to do this, Thomas incorporated earlier works dealing with Evesham's history, including the work on Æthelwig. However, because of Thomas' purpose in composing the Chronicon, he probably altered some of the texts he included, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> that the life of Æthelwig was first incorporated into a complete history of the abbey and then that composit work was adapted by Thomas into his Chronicon. The main evidence for this is internal stylistic evidence, where the Æthelwig material is stylistic uniform with other material dating to prior to 1077, with information after 1077 forming a separate writing style.|$|E
5|$|A variant, {{in which}} the motif is {{enclosed}} within a relieving blind arch that unifies the motif, is not Palladian, though Burlington seems to have assumed it was so, in using a drawing in his possession showing three such features in a plain wall (see illustration of Claydon House above right). Modern scholarship attributes the drawing to Scamozzi. Burlington employed the motif in 1721 for an elevation of Tottenham Park in Savernake Forest for his brother-in-law Lord Bruce (since remodelled). Kent picked it up in his designs for the Houses of Parliament, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> in Kent's executed designs for the north front of Holkham Hall.|$|E

5|$|As {{the video}} begins, Rihanna is walking towards a {{dressing}} room mirror while {{preparing for a}} show. This is intercut with scenes of Rihanna with her boyfriend in a restaurant. While they talk to each other, Rihanna's boyfriend leaves the table and is absent for some time, during which Rihanna watches the other tables. One diner writes a note and gives it to a waiter, who passes it to Rihanna, who reads and quickly hides the note as her boyfriend returns to the table. Rihanna starts to sing the song's lyrics while she leaves the dressing room and approaches the stage, where she continues singing while a man plays a piano on the stage. The arena is empty <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> as though Rihanna is rehearsing.|$|E
5|$|At midnight, Homer quietly {{gets out}} of bed, visits each family member, who are all asleep, and says goodbye. Feeling glum, {{he goes to the}} living room and listens to Larry King read the Bible on tape. The tape plays out to which {{suddenly}} his head drops <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> he has succumbed to the poison. Marge awakens the next morning and is panicked that her husband is not by her side. She runs downstairs and finds Homer, collapsed in the armchair. As she mourns, she realizes that his drool is still warm. She wakes him up and drums in {{the fact that he is}} alive and had not been poisoned after all. Homer then prances around in an overjoyed state and vows to live life to its fullest. Back to living his normal life, Homer returns to the couch watching a bowling tournament and eating pork rinds.|$|E
5|$|By March, Clarke's {{deception}} operations {{had grown}} {{and it was}} decided to create a formal department. He chose the name Advanced Headquarters 'A' Force - the 'A' being a subtle reference to airborne - in the hope that it would help support the existence of paratroopers in the area (as well as hide the true purpose of the department). Clarke continued actively promoting the existence of 1st SAS until around June 1941, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> that Axis commanders accepted the brigade as real. Clarke had created the unit with no specific aims, although it did mean that the enemy command had to factor the existence of airborne troops into any battle plan. However, Abeam and the 1st SAS represented his first attempt at inflating the apparent strength of Allied forces, a tactic he would use significantly over the rest of the war. The brigade occasionally featured in Clarke's tactical deceptions; such as a March 1941 threat to Axis supply lines near Tripoli.|$|E

5|$|Cynesige, the {{archbishop}} of York, died on 22 December 1060, and Ealdred was elected Archbishop of York on Christmas Day, 1060. Although a bishop was promptly appointed to Hereford, none was named to Worcester, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> that Ealdred intended to retain Worcester along with York, which several of his predecessors had done. There were a few reasons for this, {{one of which was}} political, as the kings of England preferred to appoint bishops from the south to the northern bishoprics, hoping to counter the northern tendency towards separatism. Another reason was that York was not a wealthy see, and Worcester was. Holding Worcester along with York allowed {{the archbishop}} sufficient revenue to support himself.|$|E
5|$|Greenway {{suggested}} {{that both the}} French settlers and their slaves ate the Guadeloupe amazon, as well as destroying its habitat. The supposedly related imperial amazon survives in the steep mountain forests of Dominica, whereas Guadeloupe is less mountainous and more suitable for farming, and has a larger population of humans. Because of this, {{there would have been}} a greater pressure on the Guadeloupe amazon, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> to have become extinct by the end of the 18th century. The amazons still surviving on the West Indian islands are all endangered since they are trapped for the pet-trade, overhunted for food, and because of destruction of their habitat.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, Bonnet's crew {{represented}} him {{as being}} a leader, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> likely that, after his rescue of Blackbeard's marooned crewmen, he became at least a co-equal commander aboard the Royal James. He {{appears to have been}} entrusted with the company's treasure, and made most major command decisions such as the direction of the ship and what vessels to attack. Most significantly, at Delaware Bay he ordered two of his crew to be flogged for breaches of discipline. Pirates did not lightly submit to flogging, as they resented the frequent use of this punishment in the naval and merchant services from which most of them came, and thus only a leader who commanded the obedience of his crew could successfully order such penalties.|$|E
