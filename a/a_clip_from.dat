Several participants in the strike, including Charles I. Krause, went on to greater prominence within the union.

It apparently showed the Queen storming out of a session with American photographer Annie Leibovitz over a disagreement about what she should wear, but the BBC subsequently admitted that the scenes used in the trailer had been edited out of their correct order, meaning that a false impression was given.

25|$|A music & memory {{program was}} {{developed}} by Dan Cohen, the executive director for a non-profit organization.

In 2010, the program became an official non-profit organization, which then led to a documentary two years later based on the program called , which gave the program more attention. Mainly because <b>a</b> <b>clip</b> <b>from</b> the documentary showed a patient awakening from Alzheimer's disease by listening to songs from his era such as Cab Calloway. Once the documentary was previewed, Alive Inside gained at least 11 millions views, which gave awareness to the program and treatments.|$|E
25|$|According to the {{relatives}} of Betty Ong, a flight attendant on a hijacked American Airlines plane, <b>a</b> <b>clip</b> <b>from</b> her call to headquarters {{was used in the}} beginning of the film without attribution.

Her family also asked that the film's U.S. distributors make a charitable donation in Ong's name, and should go on record that the Ong family does not endorse the use of torture. The end of the film already includes a statement paying tribute to the victims and the families of the 9/11 attacks, and the film producers have already contributed to the National September 11 Memorial & Museum.
