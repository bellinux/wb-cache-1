5|$|By 2012, {{only a few}} {{manufacturers}} offered Itanium systems, including HP, Bull, NEC, Inspur and Huawei. In addition, Intel offered <b>a</b> <b>chassis</b> {{that could}} be used by system integrators to build Itanium systems.|$|E
5|$|Sinclair {{had become}} one of the UK's best-known millionaires, and earned a knighthood, {{on the back of the}} highly {{successful}} Sinclair Research range of home computers in the early 1980s. He hoped to repeat his success in the electric vehicle market, which he saw as ripe for a new approach. The C5 emerged from an earlier project to produce a small electric car called the C1. After a change in the law, prompted by lobbying from bicycle manufacturers, Sinclair developed the C5 as an electrically powered tricycle with a polypropylene body and <b>a</b> <b>chassis</b> designed by Lotus Cars. It was intended to be the first in a series of increasingly ambitious electric vehicles, but in the event the planned development of the follow-up C10 and C15 electric cars never got further than the drawing board.|$|E
5|$|For 1987, Forti {{moved up}} to International Formula 3000 with less {{immediate}} success than experienced in Formula Three. The main reason for this was the chassis the team chose to compete with. Instead of using customer Lolas, Marches or Ralts, {{all of which were}} produced by established companies who had many years' experience of designing and building such cars, Forti stuck with their Italian Formula Three chassis supplier Gian Paolo Dallara, who had just designed his company's first F3000 machine. Forti was the first team to use this machine, which was dubbed the Dallara 3087 (<b>a</b> <b>chassis</b> which later would make a single appearance in Formula One for the BMS Scuderia Italia team, as that team's car was not ready for the first race of the 1988 season). This combination of an inexperienced team and an untested car did not score any points in its first F3000 year, nor did the team attend every race on the schedule. Forti used 1988 to gain valuable experience in F3000, and this helped the team to perform better in following seasons, as did a change to more competitive Lola and then Reynard chassis.|$|E
5000|$|KAMAZ Barhan 4x4 {{multipurpose}} vehicle, a large prototype SUV {{built on}} <b>a</b> Kamaz-43501 <b>chassis,</b> made by CaRS, a private company. Original prototype was on <b>a</b> GAZ-66 <b>chassis.</b>|$|R
25|$|The 40hp {{engine and}} chassis {{used with the}} {{double-decker}} bus was also used with lorries and drays, while a half-ton delivery van was based on <b>a</b> 12hp <b>chassis</b> similar to <b>a</b> car <b>chassis.</b>|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} <b>chassis</b> options; <b>a</b> 3-slot <b>chassis</b> most {{commonly}} used for access or distribution / aggregation of switches which has a MTBF of 2,043,676hr., <b>a</b> 6-slot <b>chassis</b> for backbones of low density or high space premium environments, and <b>a</b> 10-slot <b>chassis</b> for high availability and high scalability. The chassis can be configured {{with one or two}} CPU modules and is normally configured with two or three load balancing power supplies.|$|R
5|$|The revised LC2s {{appeared}} {{once again}} at the 1000 km of Monza to start the 1984 season, with suspension redesigned {{to work with the}} Dunlop tyres. Lancia opened the season with a podium finish, followed by another pole position on the fast Silverstone Circuit for the 1000 km of Silverstone led to a fourth-place finish. For the 24 Hours of Le Mans, both cars qualified on the front row {{in the absence of the}} Rothmans Porsche team, with Bob Wollek's pole time of 3:17.11 being some 11 seconds faster than the fastest Porsche 956's from Joest Racing who occupied the second row. Wollek and Nannini led at mid-race after battles with the Kremer Porsche of Vern Schuppan (the defending race winner) and Alan Jones, only for problems with the gearboxes on both cars to lose the team their lead. Wollek and Nannini at least proved the potential reliability of the LC2 by completing the full race distance and finishing in eighth position, with Nannini setting the races fastest lap of 3:28.90. The team also ran a private entry LC2 in the race for drivers Pierluigi Martini, Xavier Lapeyre and Beppe Gabbiani. This car crashed heavily in qualifying, with most observers believing it would require a new chassis to be repaired. As changing <b>a</b> <b>chassis</b> was prohibited by the Automobile Club de l'Ouest, the car was repaired in time to qualify and race, though rumours persisted that Lancia had broken the rules and used a new chassis to replace the original.|$|E
25|$|This {{would be}} the final year for the B-bodied, {{full-sized}} Grand Prix. The 1969 GP would feature a dramatic new body shell atop <b>a</b> <b>chassis</b> based on the smaller Pontiac A-body intermediates.|$|E
25|$|XLR {{connectors}} {{are available}} in male and female versions in both cable and chassis mounting designs, {{a total of four}} styles. This is slightly unusual as many other connector designs omit one of the styles (typically <b>a</b> <b>chassis</b> mounting male connector).|$|E
50|$|In early 2000, {{the first}} three B2K/10s would be {{delivered}} to customers, with Team Rafanelli receiving <b>a</b> Judd-powered <b>chassis,</b> Philip Creighton Motorsport <b>a</b> Ford-powered <b>chassis,</b> and Champion Racing <b>a</b> Porsche-powered <b>chassis.</b> While Creighton Motorsport's chassis was not quite ready, the other two teams made their debut at the 12 Hours of Sebring. Unfortunately neither car managed to finish, with Champion suffering a suspension failure in the closing hours and Rafanelli dropping out early on.|$|R
50|$|In 2005, Minardi used <b>a</b> PS04B <b>chassis</b> for {{the first}} three races of the season before they made <b>a</b> new PS05 <b>chassis</b> due to {{assembly}} problems.|$|R
50|$|The first Grizzly {{was built}} on <b>a</b> {{commercial}} GMC <b>chassis.</b> The current versions are built on <b>a</b> custom <b>chassis</b> supplied by Seagrave Fire Apparatus, Clintonville, Wisconsin.|$|R
25|$|A {{knockout}} punch, {{also known}} as <b>a</b> <b>chassis</b> punch, panel punch, Greenlee punch, or a Q-max, is a hand tool used to punch a hole through sheet metal. It is a very simple tool that consists of a punch, die, and screw. There are three different drive systems: manual, ratchet, and hydraulic.|$|E
25|$|Brimbank Models has a {{range of}} 3D-printed Siemens 3-carriage sets which can be {{purchased}} and assembled for standard mechanisms. The carriages are available as complete-body kits with <b>a</b> <b>chassis</b> kits with chassis. The cost is generally around $275 per three carriage set including chassis' plus mechanisms for motor cars, which the purchaser must source separately.|$|E
25|$|The Suzuki Cultus and Cultus Crescent {{were two}} {{distinct}} but related models sold in Japan by Suzuki – with the Cultus Crescent eventually superseding the Cultus. The Cultus Crescent {{was introduced in}} the Japanese market in 1995 sharing the same platform and many components from the Cultus – although with <b>a</b> <b>chassis</b> stretched by 10cm (4in) and featuring completely different styling.|$|E
50|$|It {{was also}} decided that <b>a</b> wheeled <b>chassis</b> {{would be better}} suited for the Pantsir-S rather than <b>a</b> tracked <b>chassis.</b> The {{reasoning}} being that wheeled vehicles are faster, less prone to breakdowns, easier to maintain, and cheaper to produce.|$|R
50|$|The ShKH Himalaya is an {{adaptation}} of the system to <b>a</b> tracked <b>chassis</b> required by export customers. It is essentially a tracked variant of ShKH Zuzana with the same 155 mm turret mounted on <b>a</b> T-72 <b>chassis</b> with S1000 engine.|$|R
50|$|Structurally, <b>an</b> {{exoskeleton}} <b>chassis</b> is {{midway between}} <b>a</b> ladder <b>chassis</b> and <b>a</b> spaceframe <b>chassis.</b> At its simplest, {{it consists of}} two ladder chassis, one above the other. The classic ladder chassis is stiff against sideways forces, but weak against vertical bending forces. Using paired tubes, separated vertically, makes the chassis much stiffer in this direction. Unlike a spaceframe though, the main forces act as bending loads upon these tubes, rather than the pure tension or compression forces of the true spaceframe.|$|R
25|$|Later drives were {{designed}} to fit entirely into <b>a</b> <b>chassis</b> that would mount in a 19-inch rack. Digital's RK05 and RL01 were early examples using single 14-inch platters in removable packs, the entire drive fitting in a 10.5-inch-high rack space (six rack units). In the mid-to-late 1980s the similarly sized Fujitsu Eagle, which used (coincidentally) 10.5-inch platters, was a popular product.|$|E
25|$|Shake-the-box kits are simple, easy-to-assemble kits; {{a freight}} car might include a {{one-piece}} body, <b>a</b> <b>chassis,</b> trucks, couplers, and a weight, while a structure kit might include walls, windows, doors, and glazing. The name {{derives from the}} joke that no skill was required – you shake the box, and the kit falls together. A common synonym is screwdriver kit as many kits can be assembled with a screwdriver and tweezers.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} more recent cases with Ligier (1995), Sauber (2004), Scuderia Toro Rosso (2006 & 2007) and Super Aguri (2007 & 2008) where teams {{have been accused of}} using <b>a</b> <b>chassis</b> {{produced}} by another constructor (respectively Benetton, Ferrari, Red Bull Racing and Honda). No action was taken against any of these teams, the sporting authorities being satisfied in each case that the team owned the intellectual property to the chassis they raced.|$|E
50|$|Note: the Enterprise 220R is an Ultra 60 {{motherboard}} in <b>a</b> rackable server <b>chassis</b> with hot-swappable power supplies. Similarly, the Enterprise 420R is an Ultra 80 motherboard in <b>a</b> server <b>chassis.</b>|$|R
50|$|While <b>a</b> bare <b>chassis</b> {{instead of}} <b>a</b> cowled <b>chassis,</b> the 3900/3000 {{maintained}} mechanical commonality with the 3800 conventional. This included shared powertrain and suspension components, while interior parts included Navistar instrument panels and steering columns. The 3800 itself {{was based on}} the International 4700/4900.|$|R
5000|$|In {{pursuit of}} {{developing}} heavier-duty and higher-capacity school buses, Crown introduced the first school bus with dual rear wheels in 1927 (on <b>a</b> Reo <b>chassis).</b> [...] In 1930, it produced its first all-metal school bus body (on <b>a</b> Mack <b>chassis),</b> with <b>a</b> 43-passenger capacity.|$|R
25|$|The first Minerva {{was built}} in 1928 on an {{imported}} chassis with a 29-seat capacity by local firm Johnson and Smith. A second Minerva {{was added to the}} fleet in 1931 after the Board was offered <b>a</b> <b>chassis</b> and engine for £750 following the failure of the local Minerva dealer. Johnson and Smith also won the contract for the second vehicle, and constructed a 30-seat capacity body on the chassis with several improvements over the first Minerva.|$|E
25|$|Ironically, Owen Maddock's first bespoke Formula One design wasn't {{actually}} {{produced for}} the Cooper Car Company's own use. In early 1953 industrialist, {{and owner of}} the Norton Motorcycle Company, Tony Vandervell approached the Coopers to obtain their assistance in building <b>a</b> <b>chassis</b> for his forthcoming racing engine. Vandervell {{had been one of the}} early backers of the British Racing Motors project, but had become disillusioned with the management of that enterprise and had decided to strike out on his own.|$|E
25|$|To achieve AAR's dual aims {{of winning}} in both Formula One and Champ Car formulae, AAR hired ex-Lotus {{designer}} Len Terry {{to work for}} the American outfit. His brief was to create <b>a</b> <b>chassis</b> that could be used both for the twisting road course circuits of the F1 series, as well as the broad ovals of the North American series. Terry was ideally placed to be able to fulfill such a brief, having just completed the 1965 Indianapolis 500-winning Lotus 38 for Colin Chapman's team.|$|E
50|$|This {{was based}} on <b>a</b> {{lengthened}} <b>chassis.</b>|$|R
50|$|The car {{was first}} {{introduced}} as the Marcos 1800 in 1964, with <b>a</b> wooden <b>chassis</b> and <b>a</b> Volvo P1800 engine, although later models had <b>a</b> steel <b>chassis</b> and commonly Ford engines although others were also available. The majority of these sports cars were sold in kit form.|$|R
50|$|Technically the new Bungartz Butz {{model was}} {{very similar to the}} Standard Superior, {{introduced}} one year earlier. It featured <b>a</b> tubular <b>chassis,</b> <b>a</b> mid-mounted engine, and independent wheel suspension with swing-axles at the rear.|$|R
25|$|The 1968 {{models were}} fully {{redesigned}} with an extensive restyle on a longer 111-inch wheelbase that gave Chevy's compacts <b>a</b> <b>chassis</b> {{that was just}} one inch shorter {{than that of the}} midsize Chevelle coupe. The station wagon and hardtop sport coupe were discontinued, the former in line with an industry trend which left AMC the only American maker of compact station wagons until Chrysler rejoined the market in 1976 (the 1966–70 Ford Falcon wagon was actually a midsize, using a bodyshell identical to the Fairlane wagon's).|$|E
25|$|Nissan {{unveiled}} the car, {{known as the}} ZEOD RC, during the 2013 24 Hours of Le Mans weekend. The ZEOD RC was designed by Ben Bowlby, who created the 2012 Garage 56 entry DeltaWing with backing from Nissan. The ZEOD RC utilized a hybrid electric drivetrain with lithium ion battery packs in <b>a</b> <b>chassis</b> similar in design to the DeltaWing. The car featured a turbocharged three-cylinder internal combustion engine and two electric drive motors. Nissan planned to attempt a full lap of the Circuit de la Sarthe under all-electric power, a goal achieved during the pre-race warm-up session.|$|E
25|$|Chapman's {{next major}} {{innovation}} was popularising monocoque chassis construction within automobile racing, with the revolutionary 1962 Lotus 25 Formula One car. The technique {{resulted in a}} body that was both lighter and stronger, and also provided better driver protection {{in the event of}} a crash. Although a previously little-used concept in the world of motorsport, the first vehicle to feature such <b>a</b> <b>chassis</b> was the road-going 1922 Lancia Lambda. Lotus had been an early adopter of this technology with the 1958 Lotus Elite. The modified monocoque body of the car was made of fibreglass, making it also one of the first production cars made of composite materials.|$|E
50|$|The 40 hp {{engine and}} chassis {{used with the}} {{double-decker}} bus was also used with lorries and drays, while a half-ton delivery van was based on <b>a</b> 12 hp <b>chassis</b> similar to <b>a</b> car <b>chassis.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Wayne Busette was {{the first}} small school bus {{designed}} on <b>a</b> cutaway van <b>chassis.</b> <b>A</b> product of Wayne Corporation of Richmond, Indiana, first developed in 1972, the Busette utilized <b>a</b> van <b>chassis</b> equipped with dual rear wheels. With a low center of gravity, Busette provided the combination of increased seating capacity and handling stability over a Chevy Suburban, conventional vans, and van conversions.|$|R
