OBJECTIVE : To determine the {{prevalence of}} NIHL and current noise <b>abatement</b> <b>techniques</b> implemented at a steel manufacturing plant. METHODS : Structured questionnaires were completed by permanent employees at a steel-manufacturing plant {{for the purpose of}} collecting information on occupational and medical histories, noise exposure in and outside the work environment, use of hearing protection devices (HPDs), and current noise abatement procedures. A walk-through survey was also conducted to observe implemented noise <b>abatement</b> <b>techniques</b> using the Noise Induced Hearing Loss Regulations of 2003 as a guideline. RESULTS : A total of 17. 9 % of workers suffered from NIHL (95 % CI 11. 8 % - 22. 5 %). Administrative controls, lubrication and mufflers were identified by more than 70 % of the respondents as control procedures most often implemented by the company.

When emitted into the environment can affect climate change and plants growth, and cause long term human health risks. Absorption <b>abatement</b> <b>technique</b> has been the most preferred to reduce VOCs from contaminated gaseous streams, hence the need for a polymeric solvent with a greater affinity for end-pipe inventory. This phase equilibrium study investigated the ability of diisononyl phthalate (DINP) as an absorbent to 80 selected VOCs at infinite dilution. The solvent-solute(s) interactions were studied using modified UNIFAC Lyngby and Dortmund group contribution methods, with the latter being consistent and reliable, as its results are related to literature. Alkanes, alkanes, aldehydes and cyclo-alkanes with shorter carbon-chain length are highly soluble in DINP, with their solubility decreasing with increasing molecular weight or size, at infinite dilution. Alkynes, ketones, alcohols and carboxylic acids are less soluble in DINP, {{as a result of their}} dominating polarity compared to the DINP non-polarity structure.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} environmental policy instruments on the choice of pollution control techniques. I ¯rst recast the existing theoretical model of pollution abatement technology choice. Previous {{studies have found that}} the cost savings to a ¯rm that adopts a technical innovation in pollution control are greater under a market-based instrument, such as an emissions tax or tradeable permit system, than under a command-and-control instrument such as an emissions rate standard. I show that this result is more general than previously recognized: in particular, it holds whether the new technique is more capital intensive (as in previous models) or less capital intensive. Hence, the choice of technique by ¯rms should be more responsive to abatement costs under market-based instruments. I then provide an empirical test of the theoretical predictions, using data from sulfur dioxide regulation of coal-¯red electric power plants. My principal ¯nding is that electric generating units sub ject to a tradeable permits regime were indeed more responsive to abatement costs than units under an emissions rate standard. That is, a given change in the average cost of scrubbing or coal-switching had a greater impact on the probability of scrubbing for units under the market-based regime. I also ¯nd that long-term coal contracts, regional location, and utility ownership class had signi¯cant e®ects on the choice of <b>abatement</b> <b>technique.</b> ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the impact of the co-existence of overarching ‘command and control’ regulatory policies on the cost-effectiveness of subordinate Emission Trading Systems (ETS). The Netherlands introduced an ETS in 2005 as a cost-effective measure to decrease the emission of Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) in stationary sources. The ETS was repealed after eight years, however, because of the limited effectiveness of the scheme. The influence of the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control Directive (IPPC), a regulatory standard adopted to achieve industrial emission objectives at the European level, was anticipated to be a cause of this limited effectiveness. The Dutch NOx ETS was, therefore, chosen as the focus for this study as it allows key questions to be addressed about the influence of vertical interactions between overarching climate regulations and Emission Trading Schemes on the cost-effectiveness of the trading scheme. The influence on the cost-effectiveness of the ETS was assessed by calculating the specific costs of the actual implemented <b>abatement</b> <b>techniques</b> in terms of EUR/kg NOx abated and comparing these to the remaining least-cost abatement potential. Data from the emission reports of all participants of the NOx ETS, as provided by the NEa, was used to assess the <b>abatement</b> <b>techniques.</b> The <b>abatement</b> <b>techniques</b> not found in the emission reports were found by means of a company survey and cost functions in the literature were used to assess the specific cost of each measure. The results, explaining 17. 5 ktons of the total 20. 2 ktons NOx NOx abatement achieved in 2012, showed that 16 ktons abated NOx emissions were attained at relatively low-cost. Since virtually all abatement originated from companies subject to the IPPC, it is clear that the directive undermined the functioning of the emission market. Because of the interaction between the Directive and the NOx ETS, 1 kton of abatement was attained at significantly higher cost than remaining least-cost abatement potential and thus caused estimated additional abatement costs of 10 million EUR per year. Compared to the regulatory cost of the ETS, however, the additional abatement costs were shown to be relatively limited. The IPPC Directive succeeded in enforcing a large proportion of abatement at relatively low cost, thereby reducing the gain in cost-effectiveness achievable by an ETS with no interactions. The reason for this was found to be due to the sensitivity of the IPPC emission limits to the cost-effectiveness of abatement measures and the relative homogeneity of the cost of NOx <b>abatement</b> <b>techniques...</b>|$|R

Helcom, the Convention of Helsinki has stated that the abatement targets for phosphorus and nitrogen have still not been reached. Research has shown that mussel farming could function as an <b>abatement</b> <b>technique</b> at a low cost. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to estimate if mussel farming could function as an offset in mitigating eutrophication in the Baltic Sea. Additional, the purpose is also to estimate an uncertainty discount for mussel farming since the mussel has an uncertainty treatment capacity. The theoretical framework is a mathematical optimization model where the cost of the total abatement in the sea is minimized subject to the level of total abatement, which includes other abatement techniques plus the abatement level of mussel farming, should be equal or larger than the abatement requirement that is set for the country. The cost minimization problem is then solved by the Lagrange method. The result shows that Sweden and Germany would benefit when crediting mussels for nitrogen. For phosphorus, Sweden, Poland, Denmark, Germany and Lithuania would benefit from introducing mussel farming. When including the uncertainty factor the level of mussel farming decreases in all countries. In a scenario analysis the marginal cost of mussel farming were given weights of 0. 5 for nitrogen and phosphorus respectively.

Increase in the atmospheric concentration of these gasses cause serious environmental impact locally and globally. There is therefore a need for <b>abatement</b> <b>technique</b> to reduce the gas emission from manure, and for safe and reliable measuring methods. The Photoacoustic Multi-gas Monitor (PMM) is an efficient and handy method for continuous and simultaneous measurements of concentrations of different gases and its reliability was therefore tested during measurements of gas emission from a store of composting livestock manure. Concentrations of ammonia, methane (CH 4) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) in airflows entering and leaving a store of composting livestock manure was estimated by the PMM method and compared to estimations of gas concentrations attained by different types of measuring techniques. The PMM measuring system gave similar estimates for ammonia concentration as observed by Kitagawa measuring technique when concentrations of ammonia were lower than 50 ppm, but slightly lower estimates when concentrations of ammonia were higher than 50 ppm. The PMM measuring technique measured similar concentrations of CH 4 as the gas chromatograph (GC) method, when measuring concentrations above background levels. However, when used for measuring background level of CH 4, estimations obtained by the PMM method were different from estimations obtained by the GC method {{and seemed to be}} correlated with air humidity.

40|$|Title IV of the 1990 Clean Air Act {{instituted a}} {{nationwide}} system of tradeable pollution permits for sulfur dioxide emitted by electric power plants. This paper asks: What were the cost savings from using a market-based instrument, {{rather than a}} more conventional prescriptive approach? Using an econometric model of the decision {{whether or not to}} install a scrubber under different policy regimes, I simulate the decisions that would have been made under prescriptive regulation. I find that under an uniform emissions-rate standard chosen to achieve the same aggregate abatement as actually occurred, the total number of scrubbers would have been about one-third higher than under the baseline cap-and-trade program. The change in the distribution of scrubbers among units is more striking. Under prescriptive regulation, installed scrubbers would have had systematically higher scrubbing costs than they actually did, and would have been installed at plants with significantly higher costs of switching to low-sulfur coal (the principal alternative to scrubbing). At the aggregate level, these effects translate into aggregate costs of compliance that would have been greater than actual costs by an estimated $ 150 million to $ 270 million per year. Thus the use of the market-based instrument resulted in cost savings of between 16 % and 25 %.

40|$|Cooling systems used {{to reduce}} heat stress in dairy {{operations}} require high energy, water usage, or both. Steady increases in electricity costs and reduction of water availability {{and an increase in}} water usage regulations require evaluation of passive cooling systems to cool cows and reduce use of water and electricity. A series of experiments were conducted to evaluate the use of heat exchangers buried as components in a conductive system for cooling cows. In the first experiment six cows were housed in environmentally controlled rooms with tiestall beds, which were equipped with a heat exchanger and filled with 25 cm of either sand or dried manure. Beds were connected to supply and return lines and individually controlled. Two beds (one per each kind of bedding material) constituted a control group (water off), and the other 4 (2 sand and 2 dried manure) used water at 7 °C passing through the heat exchangers (water on). The experiment was divided in 2 periods of 40 d, and each period involved 3 repetitions of 3 different climates (hot and dry, thermo neutral, and hot and humid). Each cow was randomly assigned to a different treatment after each repetition was over. Sand bedding remained cooler than dried manure bedding in all environments and at all levels of cooling (water on or off). Results from this experiment demonstrated that bed temperatures were lower and heat flux higher during the bed treatment with sand and water on. We also detected a reduction in core body temperatures, respiration rates, rectal temperatures, and skin temperatures of those cows during the sand and water on treatment. Feed intake and milk yield numerically increased during the bed treatment with sand and water on for all climates. No major changes were observed in the lying time of cows or the composition of the milk produced. The efficiency of conductive cooling as a heat <b>abatement</b> <b>technique</b> in dairy production is highly correlated with the distance between the cooling system and the skin of the cow and the type of bedding material used. A second experiment was conducted to identify possible improvements in the utilization of conductive cooling for cooling cows. Heat exchangers buried 12. 7 cm below the surface as components in a conductive system ware evaluated in this study. Six cows were housed in environmentally controlled rooms with tie-stall beds, which were equipped with a heat exchanger and filled with 12. 7 cm of either sand or dried manure. Beds were connected to supply and return lines and individually controlled. Two beds (one per bedding material type) constituted a control group (water OFF), and the other four (two sand and two dried manure) used water at 7 °C passing through the heat exchangers (water ON). The experiment was divided into two periods of 40 days and each period involved three repetitions of three different climates hot dry (HD), thermo neutral(TN) and hot humid (HH). Each cow was randomly assigned to a different treatment after each repetition was over. The sand and water on treatment was the most efficient treatment under heat stress conditions (humid or dry heat). Cows in stalls with the sand and water on treatment demonstrated lower rectal temperatures, respiration rates, skin surface temperatures and core body temperatures compared to the other three treatments. Additionally, the sand and water on treatment increased milk yield and resting time of cows under heat stress. Also, the sand and water on treatment had the lowest bed surface temperatures and highest heat exchange compared to the other treatments. From these two experiments we confirm that heat exchangers are a viable heat <b>abatement</b> <b>technique</b> that could reduce the heat load of heat stressed cows; however, this system should be paired with additional cooling systems (e. g. fans and or misters) to most efficiently reduce the negative effects of heat stress on dairy production. Additionally, Sand was superior to dried manure as a bedding material in combination with heat exchangers. To make further recommendations of the use of heat exchangers in commercial dairy farm, a third study was developed. Based on the data obtained in the previous experiments, a comprehensive energy balance was developed to fully understand conductive cooling in two different environments (HD and HH), two bedding materials (sand and dried manure) and two depths between cows and the heat exchangers (25 vs. 12. 5 cm). The energy balance estimates indicated that sand is the most efficient bedding material when utilized as bedding material with conductive cooling in both hot dry and hot humid environments. In the hot-dry environment there was an increase in the conductive heat exchanged with the reduction in bedding depth to 12. 5 cm, however this did not result in a reduction in the heat storage of cows. In the hot-humid environment when heat exchangers were placed 12. 5 cm {{from the top of the}} bed there was an increase in both the conductive heat loss and heat storage of cows when compared to 25 cm. Additionally, results demonstrated that the efficiency of heat exchangers as measured by heat flux was improved when heat exchangers were at a depth of 12. 5 cm. The sensibility analysis indicated that a reduction in the depth and/or an increase in the thermal conductivity of both bedding materials would maximize conductive heat exchange. These results should be utilized as recommendations for the utilization of heat exchangers and conductive cooling in commercial dairy farms. Evaporative cooling is widely used in dairy farms located in arid environments. Even though, these cooling systems have been shown to effectively reduce the heat stress of lactating dairy cows, a growing shortage of water and rising cost of electricity compromise its future usage. An experiment was developed to compare two evaporative cooling systems, their interaction with lactating dairy cows and their usage of natural resources. The efficacy of 2 evaporative cooling systems (Korral Kool, KK, Korral Kool Inc., Mesa, AZ; FlipFan dairy system, FF, Schaefer Ventilation Equipment LLC, Sauk Rapids, MN) was estimated utilizing 400 multiparous Holstein dairy cows randomly assigned to 1 of 4 cooled California-style shade pens (2 shade pens per cooling system). Each shaded pen contained 100 cows (days in milk = 58 ± 39, milk production = 56 ± 18 kg/d, and lactation = 3 ± 1). Production data (milk yield and reproductive performance) were collected during 3 months (June–August, 2013) and physiological responses (core body temperature, respiration rates, surface temperatures, and resting time) were measured in June and July to estimate responses of cows to the 2 different cooling systems. Water and electricity consumption were recorded for each system. Cows in the KK system displayed slightly lower respiration rates in the month of June and lower surface temperatures in June and July. However, no differences were observed in the core body temperature of cows, resting time, feed intake, milk yield, services/cow, and conception rate between systems. The FF system used less water and electricity during this study. In conclusion, both cooling systems (KK and FF) were effective in mitigating the negative effects of heat stress on cows housed in arid environments, whereas the FF system consumed less water and electricity and did not require use of curtains on the shade structure. Results of this research indicate that effective use of conductive cooling in combination with efficient evaporative cooling systems offer opportunities to reduce both water and electricity consumption on dairy farms under both hot dry and hot humid environments...|$|E
40|$|TEP are gel-like and {{extremely}} sticky particles, consisting of polysaccharides and formed out of exudates from algae and bacterial mucus. Membrane technologists recently started recognizing {{the importance of}} these particles as biofouling initiators since they are ubiquitous in all natural waters, sticky and well colonised by bacteria and hereby ideally designed to induce biofouling. Once attached to membrane surfaces, these particles start poreblocking and serve as both an attachment site and nutritious substrate for microbial growth. Earlier studies observed 70 % of TEP in influent water sticking on reverse osmosis (RO) membranes and limited TEP removal efficiency in RO-pretreatment systems. It was also seen that early EPS deposition on membranes only originates from TEP present in the feed water, an indication that TEP can be an important factor for the initiation of biofilms. However, not a single study described the occurrence of TEP in drinking water treatment trains. The limited removal efficiencies in several systems and the conclusions about TEP as a possible important factor in biofilm initiation suggest that TEP can be present in drinking water and play a role in drinking water safety. Therefore, this study {{was the first one to}} evaluate the occurrence of TEP in drinking water facilities. The TEP concentrations in raw water and throughout different drinking water production trains were measured and common water treatment methods were evaluated on their TEP removal. A focus was laid on ‘Torreele’, a Belgian installation treating effluent from a wastewater treatment plant via ultrafiltration (UF) and RO. This water is infiltrated in the dunes and recharges the local groundwater reserves. After infiltration, this water is pumped up and treated to drinking water. Hereby, this is one of the only installations worldwide based on the re-use of wastewater to drinking water. Next to this plant (‘Plant A’), 2 other plants treating respectively surface water and groundwater were comprised in this research (‘Plant B’ and ‘Plant C’). The waste water effluent in plant A contained the considerable amount of 1571 μg/L TEP. In comparison, Plant B had raw water containing 699 μg/L TEP while not any considerable amount of TEP could be detected in the groundwater of plant C. In plant A, TEP-concentrations were raised after addition of chlorine. This was probably due to cell lysis and TEP release induced by chlorine. In this installation, UF proved to be a very efficient <b>abatement</b> <b>technique</b> for TEP. RO is known to be a very powerful method and completely removed the whole TEP fraction, however the aquatic life in the infiltration pond caused the reappearance of TEP. Infiltration reduced the TEP amounts again until a minimal and stable level. In plant B, coagulation efficiently sticked the TEP together, enabling the double sand filtration to efficiently remove this bigger TEP-fraction. The following ozonation, activated carbon filtration and chlorination was able to minimize TEP concentrations so that only a very limited amount of TEP could reach the final drinking water. Finally, 13 more chemical and biological parameters were measured: pH, conductivity, COD, TOC, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, Na+, K+, NO 3 -, SO 4 2 -, Cl-, viable and total bacteria concentration. All data was merged together in one data set and statistics were used in search for significant associations between TEP and other parameters. A significant association was found for TEP versus either viable or total cell concentrations, TOC and COD. It could be concluded that limited or no TEP could reach the final drinking water. In the re-use system, TEP was not a possible contaminant endangering the final drinking water quality.

This will support the development of management options and to assess the ease of implementation of the selected abatement option and also to allow identification of “low hanging fruit”.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} an {{assessment}} of the economic costs of environmental policies in the Netherlands, using a dynamic Applied General Equilibrium model with bottom-up information on <b>abatement</b> <b>techniques.</b> Empirical <b>abatement</b> cost curves are used to determine substitution possibilities between pollution and abatement and the characteristics of abatement goods. The results show that an absolute decoupling of economy and environment is possible. Smog formation is the most costly environmental theme, due to the absence of technical abatement options. For all environmental themes, the least-cost way to reduce emissions is via a combination of technical abatement measures and substantial economic restructuring.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{specification}} of pollution abatement in dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) models and analyses the dynamic feedback mechanisms between economy and abatement {{in the context of}} environmental policy. A Ramsey-type economic model is presented, in which bottom-up technical and economic information on <b>abatement</b> <b>techniques</b> is integrated in a top-down dynamic CGE context. The practical suitability of the specification is illustrated by an empirical application for climate change and acidification in the Netherlands. The results show that a mixture of some slowdown of economic growth, a substantial restructuring of the economy and implementation of most technical abatement measures is optimal.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} systematic {{work done}} {{in the field of}} atmospheric emissions from Portuguese Kraft pulp mills, focused mainly on the gaseous emissions responsible for its characteristic odour. These mal-odorous gases, which were identified as hydrogen sulphide, methyl mercaptan, deimethyl mercaptan and dimethyl-disulphide, were experimentally quantified and classified into groups so that alternatives for abatement could be devised. The considered <b>abatement</b> <b>techniques</b> were evaluated economically and it was concluded that the costs to be incurred by pulp mills for an efficient abatement of TRS gases are not dramatic and could be easily covered by this industry, resulting in an evident reduction of an important and noticeable environmental impact...|$|R
40|$|The article {{presents}} the methodological and technical bases {{for the creation}} of regression models that adequately reflect reality. The focus is on methods of removing residual autocorrelation in models. Algorithms eliminating heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation of the regression model residuals: reweighted least squares method, the method of Cochran-Orkutta are given. A model of "pure" regression is build, as well as to compare the effect on the dependent variable of the different explanatory variables when the latter are expressed in different units, a standardized form of the regression equation. The scheme of <b>abatement</b> <b>techniques</b> of heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation {{for the creation of}} regression models specific to the social and cultural sphere is developed...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} and impacts of different nitrogen pollutants are inextricably linked. To understand the problem fully, {{the interactions between}} the different pollutants {{need to be taken}} into account. This is particularly important when it comes to <b>abatement</b> <b>techniques,</b> since measures to reduce emissions of one nitrogen pollutant can often lead to an increase in another. This project represents a step towards greater understanding of these issues by linking together new and existing nitrogen flux models into a larger framework. The modelling framework has been constructed and some of the nitrogen flows between fields, farms and the atmosphere have been modelled for a UK study area for typical farm management scenario...|$|R
40|$|This chapter summarises the {{information}} in the preceding chapters, which builds on the outcomes of an Expert Workshop held by the UNECE Task Force on Reactive Nitrogen in October 2010 in Paris, France, which examined the state-of-the-art regarding abatement measures for ammonia in agriculture. Cost information is provided by farm activity and abatement measure, including a discussion on integrated nitrogen management at the farm scale. The chapter also reports the conclusions of the Expert Workshop, noting the finding that in many cases the costs for the <b>abatement</b> <b>techniques</b> were cheaper than previously estimated. Wider policy contexts of {{the information}} are explored, including identifying priority measures for ammonia abatement and links to Annex IX of the Gothenburg Protocol...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} use {{of modern}} lightweight materials in the aircraft industry raises the demand for innovative and lightweight-compliant noise <b>abatement</b> <b>techniques.</b> Smartstructures technology is able to overcome the passive constraints in the low-frequency range (< 500 Hz) by augmenting the light-weight structure with structurally integrated transducers and a suitable control scheme. In these investigations, an active carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) panel was designed, manufactured and experimentally investigated in an acoustic wind tunnel. Measurement data of turbulent wall pressure fluctuations, structural vibration and active sound power provide a database for the verification and validation of the developed simulation models. Active control of the smart CFRP-panel showed a broadband reduction of third-octave band sound power level up to 6 dB(A). ...|$|R
40|$|The {{papers in}} this volume reflect the {{progress}} in aeroacoustic research which {{has been made in}} the field of VTOL and V/STOL aircraft noise. The research was directed mainly at developing better methods for predicting noise generation and propagation, at determining the effects of pressure fluctuations on surfaces and interior noise, and at developing noise <b>abatement</b> <b>techniques.</b> Among the topics covered are: scrubbing noise of externally blown flaps; propulsive-lift noise of an upper-surface-blown flap configuration; the aeroacoustic characteristics of model slot nozzles with straight flaps; fluctuating pressures on aircraft wing and flap surfaces associated with powered-lift systems; acoustic characteristics of a large upper-surface-blown configuration with turbofan engines; the effect of forward speed on jet/flap interaction noise; and airframe noise in the far field...|$|R
