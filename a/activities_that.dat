5|$|According to Hepburn (2006, pp.238–239), “it {{should be}} {{expected}} that industry will lobby furiously against any auctioning.” Hepburn et al. (2006) state {{that it is an}} empirical fact that while businesses tend to oppose auctioning of emissions permits, economists almost uniformly recommend auctioning permits. Garnaut notes that the complexity of free allocation, and the large amounts of money involved, encourage non-productive rent-seeking behaviour and lobbying of governments, <b>activities</b> <b>that</b> dissipate economic value.|$|E
5|$|According to Liz Tynan from James Cook University, the Maralinga {{tests were}} a {{striking}} {{example of what}} can happen when the popular media are unable to report on <b>activities</b> <b>that</b> the government may be trying to hide. Maralinga was an example of extreme secrecy, but by the late 1970s there was a marked change in how the Australian media covered the British nuclear tests. Some resourceful investigative journalists emerged, whistle-blowers such as Avon Hudson spoke out and political scrutiny became more intense. The investigative journalist Brian Toohey ran a series of stories in the Australian Financial Review in October 1978, based in part on a leaked Cabinet submission.|$|E
5|$|<b>Activities</b> <b>that</b> reduce {{physiological}} {{arousal and}} cognitive activity promote falling asleep, so engaging in relaxing activities before bedtime is recommended. Conversely, continuing important work activities or planning shortly before bedtime or once in bed {{has been shown}} to delay falling asleep. Similarly, good sleep hygiene involves minimizing time spent thinking about worries or anything emotionally upsetting shortly before bedtime. Trying purposefully to fall asleep may induce frustration that further prevents falling asleep, so in such situations a person may be advised {{to get out of bed}} and try something else for a brief amount of time.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Clarke had {{a varied}} {{military}} career {{that began with}} a posting to Mesopotamia in 1919. During the Iraqi revolt of 1920, he helped evacuate Europeans from the region by boat.

Clarke volunteered to help the local British force and was tasked with feeding misinformation to Turkish nationalists– a first taste of the <b>activities</b> <b>that</b> would define his later military career. In 1925, during another period of leave, Clarke covered the Rif War for the Morning Post.|$|E
5|$|Allocations {{will be made}} to firms who {{undertake}} <b>activities</b> <b>that</b> {{are deemed}} to be both 'trade-exposed' and 'emissions-intensive'.

Allocation per unit of output will decrease by 1.3% per year from 2013 (on an exponential basis rather than a summation basis).|$|E

The study found that participants' age, sex, housing age, current hobbies with potential for lead exposure, and game consumption were all associated with blood lead level (PbB).|$|E

Humans are the greatest threat to crocodilian populations through <b>activities</b> <b>that</b> include hunting and habitat destruction, but farming of crocodilians has greatly reduced unlawful trading in wild skins. Artistic and literary representations of crocodilians have appeared in human cultures around the world since at least Ancient Egypt. The earliest known mention of the story that crocodiles weep for their victims was in the 9th century; it was later spread by Sir John Mandeville in 1400 and then by William Shakespeare in the late 16th century and early 17th century.|$|E
