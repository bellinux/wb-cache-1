Crystal size distributions were obtained from fifteen vertical thin sections of 20cm × 10cm (height × width) and a thickness of 0.4 ±0.1mm of ice evenly distributed in the depth interval 115 – 880 m. Peak sizes with depth were ~1.9mm 115 m, ~2.2mm 165 m, ~2.8mm 220 m, ~3.0mm 330 m, ~3.2mm 440 m, ~3.3mm 605 m, whereas mean sizes with depth were ~1.8 115 m, ~2.2mm 165 m, ~2.4mm 220 m, ~2.8mm ~270 m, ~2.75mm 330 m, ~2.6mm ~370 m, ~2.9mm 440 m, ~2.8mm ~490 m, ~2.9mm ~540 m, ~2.9mm 605 m, ~3.0 ~660 m, ~3.2mm ~720 m, ~2.9mm ~770 m, ~2.7mm ~820 m, ~2.8mm 880 m. <b>And,</b> <b>here</b> <b>again</b> as with Dye 3, steady state in grain growth was reached and continued through the post-glacial climatic optimum.|$|E
500|$|Professional {{concern was}} raised in several {{countries}} {{about the quality of}} memorials. Australians expressed critical concern from 1919 onwards about the poor quality of the sculptures of soldiers on memorials, the blame being placed on the cheap reproductions by stone masons. Their government responded by establishing advisory boards to discourage this trend. Britain also saw concerns over the [...] "stereotyped designs" [...] being supplied by firms of stone masons, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>again</b> numerous bodies issued guidance on better practices, including the Royal Academy of Art, the Church of England; the Civic Arts Association was formed specifically to help. The opinion of professional artists and critics remained quite important for committees when choosing designs, however, and there was vigorous discussion between supporters of different styles and architectural traditions.|$|E
2500|$|Binob penöl is {{literally}} 'I am writing', though penob is also used. [...] For [...] "I write" [...] as habitual action, the habitual aspect is used. [...] This is formed by adding -i- after the tense prefix, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>again</b> the present-tense a- is required. The forms are thus active ai-, äi-, ei-, ii-, oi-, ui-, passive pai-, päi-, pei-, pii-, poi-, pui-. [...] All are pronounced as two syllables.|$|E

2500|$|In 1763, {{the philosopher}} Immanuel Kant (1724–1804), {{then at the}} {{beginning}} of his career, was impressed by these accounts and made inquiries to find out if they were true. [...] He also ordered all eight volumes of the expensive Arcana Cœlestia (Heavenly Arcana or Heavenly Mysteries). One Charlotte von Knobloch wrote Kant asking his opinion of Swedenborg’s psychic experiences. [...] Kant wrote a very affirmative reply, referring to Swedenborg's [...] "miraculous" [...] gift, and characterizing him as [...] "reasonable, agreeable, remarkable and sincere" [...] and [...] "a scholar," [...] in one of his letters to Mendelssohn, and expressing regret that he (Kant) had never met Swedenborg. [...] Joseph Green, his English friend, who investigated the matter for Kant, including by visiting Swedenborg’s home, found Swedenborg to be a [...] "sensible, pleasant and openhearted" [...] man <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>again,</b> a scholar.|$|E
2500|$|In 2004 M'bilia Bel and Suzy Kaseya {{released}} {{their second}} collaborative CD [...] "Belissimo", but the album wasn't a huge success, even though She used different voice {{techniques such as}} Melisma and Belting to project another vocal's dimension of her, the Whole local Congolese press accused the singer of neglecting {{the promotion of the}} entire album by resisting to approach them that year. [...] M'bilia bel thereafter suffered a brief downfall as the Queen of Congolese Rumba and also with the venue of young singers such as Mj 30 and Cindy Le Coeur the terrain was getting tighter. [...] Mbilia Bel as time went by she gained more knowledge of the show-biz, things changed for the better with her savoir-faire as old school. In 2009, she went back to an elder collaborative which is Lutumaba Simaro [...] "One of The Congolese [...] Rumba Master Guitarists" [...] to interpret his song [...] "Mobali Ya Bato" [...] that quickly topped the chart <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>again,</b> M'bilia Bel was fully back on the road with her career.
