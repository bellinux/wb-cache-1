40|$|Abstract Introduction Acute Human Immunodeficiency Virus {{infection}} {{is associated with}} a range of neurological conditions. Guillain-Barré syndrome is a rare presentation; <b>acute</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>demyelinating</b> <b>polyneuropathy</b> is the commonest form of Guillain-Barré syndrome. <b>Acute</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>demyelinating</b> <b>polyneuropathy</b> has occasionally been reported in acute Immunodeficiency Virus infection but little data exists on frequency, management and outcome. Case presentation We describe an episode of Guillain-Barré syndrome presenting as <b>acute</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>demyelinating</b> <b>polyneuropathy</b> in a 30 -year-old man testing positive for Immunodeficiency Virus, probably during acute seroconversion. Clinical suspicion was confirmed by cerebrospinal fluid analysis and nerve conduction studies. Rapid clinical deterioration prompted intravenous immunoglobulin therapy and early commencement of highly active anti-retroviral therapy. All symptoms resolved within nine weeks. Conclusion Unusual neurological presentations in previously fit patients are an appropriate indication for Immunodeficiency-Virus testing. Highly active anti-retroviral therapy with adequate penetration of the central nervous system should be considered as an early intervention, alongside conventional therapies such as intravenous immunoglobulin. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Introduction The {{combination}} of polyethylene glycol (PEG) ylated interferon (pegylated interferon) and ribavirin {{has been shown}} to be an effective treatment for chronic hepatitis C virus. In general, common side effects related to this combination therapy are mild and are well tolerated. However, peripheral neuropathy including demyelinating polyneuropathy related to PEG-interferon α 2 a (pegylated interferon alfa- 2 a) is extremely rare. In the literature, only one case of <b>acute</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>demyelinating</b> <b>polyneuropathy</b> related to PEG-interferon α 2 a has been published previously. Case presentation To the best of our knowledge we present only the second case of <b>acute</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>demyelinating</b> <b>polyneuropathy</b> related to PEG-interferon α 2 a, occurring in a 63 -year-old Caucasian man. He developed tingling, numbness, and weakness of his upper and lower extremities with acute neurological deficits after five weeks of a combination therapy with PEG-interferon α 2 a and ribavirin for chronic hepatitis C virus infection. His clinical course, neurological findings, and his electromyogram results were all consistent with <b>acute</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>demyelinating</b> <b>polyneuropathy.</b> Our patient recovered completely after interferon was stopped and symptomatic treatment and a further electromyogram showed a disappearance of neuropathy. Four weeks later, PEG-interferon α 2 a was reintroduced with a gradually increasing dose without any reappearance of neurological symptoms allowing hepatitis C seroconversion. Conclusions Recognition of this rare yet possible presentation is important for early and accurate diagnosis and treatment. This case report also suggests that the reintroduction of PEGylated interferon in patients who had presented with <b>acute</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>demyelinating</b> <b>polyneuropathy</b> related to interferon α may be safe, but this must be confirmed by further studies. </p...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE—When {{to suspect}} a paraneoplastic {{disorder}} is a puzzling {{problem that has}} not recently been studied in a large series of patients referred for peripheral neuropathy.  METHODS—From 422 consecutive patients with peripheral neuropathy, 26 were analysed who concomitantly had carcinoma but no tumorous infiltration, drug toxicity, or cachexia. Their clinical, pathological, and electrophysiological data were analysed {{according to the presence}} of anti-onconeural antibodies, the latency between presentation and cancer diagnosis, and the incidence of carcinoma in the corresponding types of neuropathy of the population of 422 patients.  RESULTS—Seven patients (group I) had anti-onconeural antibodies (six anti-Hu, one anti-CV 2) and 19 did not (groups IIA and B). In group I, subacute sensory neuropathy (SSN) was the most frequent but other neuropathies including demyelinating neuropathies were present. Patients in group II A had a short latency (mean 7. 88 months), and a rapidly and usually severe neuropathy which corresponded in 11 / 14 to an established inflammatory disorder including neuropathy with encephalomyelitis, mononeuritis multiplex, and <b>acute</b> or chronic <b>inflammatory</b> <b>demyelinating</b> <b>polyneuropathy</b> (CIDP). Patients in group IIB had a long latency (mean 8. 4 years) and a very chronic disorder corresponding in four of five to an axonal non-inflammatory polyneuropathy. In this population, the incidence of carcinoma occurring with a short latency was 47 % in sensory neuronopathy, 1. 7 % in Guillain-Barré syndrome, 10 % in mononeuritis multiplex and CIDP, and 4. 5 % in axonal polyneuropathy.  CONCLUSIONS—Paraneoplastic neuropathies associated with carcinoma are heterogeneous disorders. Neuropathies occurring with a long latency with tumours probably resulted from a coincidental association. Neuropathies which occurred within a few years of the tumour evolved rapidly and corresponded mostly to inflammatory disorders. As dysimmune neuropathies are probably paraneoplastic in a limited number of cases, patients with these disorders should probably not be investigated systematically for carcinoma in the absence of anti-onconeural antibodies, except when the neuropathy is associated with encephalomyelitis and probably with vasculitis. Questions remain concerning CIDP. ...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. Polyneuropathies or {{peripheral}} neuropathies {{present a}} dysfunction or disease of {{larger number of}} peripheral nerves or their dysfunction. Considering their morbidity - mortality characteristics they present an important aspect in daily clinical practice. One particular polyneuropathy that deserves special review is chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, which, due to its clinical - laboratory presentation, {{does not include the}} group of „simple” neuropathies, thus requiring further examinations. Neurophysiological testing should be performed using the protocol for neuropathy examinations. Neurophysiological examination, during the electroneurographic examination, shows neurographic parameters referring to polyneuropatic demyelinating type of lesion, while the electromyographic finding records the presence of neuropathic lesions (denervation activity, great action potentials with a reduced sample). Case report. A 54 -year-old patient was diagnosed to have a “complicated” demyelinating polyneuropathy according to the clinical-laboratory findings and electromyographic examination. Exclusion criteria, targeted diagnostic examinations, considering the mentioned peripheral neuropathies, pointed to <b>acute</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>demyelinating</b> <b>polyneuropathy.</b> However, the chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy was finally differentiated during the clinical and electromyographic monitoring. Conclusion. The presented case is interesting because it shows how one can ”wander” towards the diagnosis, which is eventually {{made on the basis of}} electromyographic examination and monitoring as well as according to exclusion criteria, which have differentiated the <b>acute</b> <b>inflammatory</b> <b>demyelinating</b> <b>polyneuropathy</b> from the chronic one...|$|E
