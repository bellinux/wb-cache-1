The {{production}} ran for a disappointing 96 performances, although it had opened to a standing ovation from the audience and a generally optimistic reaction from critics. The Daily Telegraph wrote, [...] "Elaine Paige is a good sport... enduring jokes about her reputation for being 'difficult' with <b>a</b> <b>grin</b> that doesn't seem all that forced.... Only the self-importantly serious and the chronically depressed will fail to enjoy this preposterously entertaining evening".
