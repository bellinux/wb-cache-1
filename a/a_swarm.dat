40|$|A phage able to transduce a {{streptomycin}} {{resistance marker}} in Proteus mirabilis can also separately transduce the swarming characteristic between variants of two strains of P. mirabilis. Motile non-swarming variants {{were made to}} swarm on agar by incorporation of <b>a</b> <b>swarming</b> gene via <b>a</b> phage lysate of <b>a</b> <b>swarming</b> strain. The production of swarms by motile non-swarming variants when treated with phage lysates of other pheno-typically similar strains indicated that a t least three non-homologous factors control swarming., 4 n 0 variant could also act as a donor of the swarming gene. This is because the 0 strain possesses <b>an</b> intact <b>swarming</b> centre which is masked {{by the absence of}} active flagella. This 0 variant was transduced to swarming by phage lysates of motile non-swarming strains or of <b>a</b> <b>swarming</b> strain. The gene transduced here was concerned with the presence of flagella. Factors controlling two morphological varieties of swarming were separately transduced to suitable recipients and a locus able to modify wild-type swarms was identified...|$|R
5|$|Rorquals use throat pleats {{to expand}} their mouths, which allow them to feed more effectively. However, {{rorquals}} need to build up water pressure in order {{to expand their}} mouths, leading to a lunge-feeding behavior. Lunge-feeding is where a whale rams a bait ball (<b>a</b> <b>swarm</b> of small fish) at high speed. Rorquals generally have streamlined physiques to reduce drag in the water while doing this.|$|E

5|$|According to Lafcadio Hearn, a {{butterfly}} {{was seen in}} Japan as the personification of a person's soul; whether they be living, dying, or already dead. One Japanese superstition says that if {{a butterfly}} enters your guest room and perches behind the bamboo screen, the person whom you most love is coming to see you. Large numbers of butterflies are viewed as bad omens. When Taira no Masakado was secretly preparing for his famous revolt, there appeared in Kyoto so vast <b>a</b> <b>swarm</b> of butterflies that the people were frightened— thinking the apparition to be a portent of coming evil.|$|E

5|$|Because army ants are {{unpredictable}} {{in their}} movements, it is impractical for obligate ant-followers {{to maintain a}} territory that always contains swarms to feed around. Antbirds have evolved a more complicated system than the strict territoriality of most other birds. They generally (details vary among species) maintain breeding territories but travel outside those territories in order to feed at swarms. Several pairs {{of the same species}} may attend <b>a</b> <b>swarm,</b> with the dominant pair at the swarm being the pair which holds the territory that the swarm is in. In addition to competition within species, competition among species exists, and larger species are dominant. In its range, the ocellated antbird is the largest of the obligate ant-following antbirds and is dominant over other members of the family, although it is subordinate to various species from other families (including certain woodcreepers, motmots and the rufous-vented ground cuckoo). At <b>a</b> <b>swarm,</b> the dominant species occupies positions above the central front of the swarm, which yields the largest amount of prey. Smaller, less dominant species locate themselves further away from the centre, or higher above the location of the dominant species, where prey is less plentiful.|$|E

Lang breaks free and he and Hope dispatch most of the Hydra agents, though one flees with a vial of Cross' particles and Pym is shot. Lang pursues Cross, while the explosives detonate, imploding the building as Pym and van Dyne escape.|$|E

2500|$|Enthusiasts of {{swarming}} sometimes {{apply it}} to situations that have superficial similarities, but really do not qualify as swarms. While swarms do converge on a target, not every military action, where multiple units attacked from all sides of <b>a</b> target, constitute <b>swarming.</b> [...] Other conflicts, especially historical ones, fit <b>a</b> <b>swarming</b> paradigm, but the commanders involved {{did not use the}} concept. Nevertheless, historical examples help illustrate what modern analysts do and do not consider swarming.|$|R
2500|$|The {{essence of}} <b>a</b> <b>swarmer</b> is {{non-stop}} aggression. Many short in-fighters utilize their stature to their advantage, employing a bob-and-weave defense by bending {{at the waist}} to slip underneath or {{to the sides of}} incoming punches. Unlike blocking, causing an opponent to miss a punch disrupts his balance, this permits forward movement past the opponent's extended arm and keeps the hands free to counter. A distinct advantage that in-fighters have is when throwing uppercuts, they can channel their entire bodyweight behind the punch; Mike Tyson was famous for throwing devastating uppercuts. Marvin Hagler was known for his hard [...] "chin", punching power, body attack and the stalking of his opponents. Some in-fighters, like Mike Tyson, have been known for being notoriously hard to hit. The key to <b>a</b> <b>swarmer</b> is aggression, endurance, chin, and bobbing-and-weaving.|$|R
