5|$|Amongst {{local media}} outlets, only Apple Daily and Ming Pao ran {{coverage}} on their front pages initially, while other local newspapers carried only brief pieces about <b>a</b> <b>missing</b> <b>person.</b> Television viewers remarked that TVB {{did not run}} the story during its prime time news programmes {{for the first few}} days after news of the Lee Bo disappearance broke. Lee Bo's disappearance spurred renewed interest about Lam Wing-kee, and his family received a police visit the same day after chief executive CY Leung spoke publicly on the case.|$|E
5|$|Chris Chibnall {{wanted to}} write a story that tackled the issue of loss and {{revolved}} around <b>a</b> <b>missing</b> <b>person</b> case. Executive producer Russell T Davies appreciated the character dynamics and domestic themes in the episode and cited the script as one of his inspirations in continuing the series. Ruth Jones, who is generally better known for her comedic roles, was cast against type in the central guest role of Nikki Bevan. The episode was filmed largely on location in South Wales with the island of Flat Holm featuring prominently. Response to the episode was generally positive. Reviewers generally praised the episode for illuminating the conflicting elements of Gwen's character and providing a central dilemma with no easy answer. Some critics identified ostensible plot holes, though felt that the episode's emotional successes negated these.|$|E

5|$|On 13 March 1995, {{a pair of}} legs, severed at the knees, {{was found}} in a plastic bag {{floating}} off Clifford Pier. Three days later, a pair of thighs and a torso were found in the same area, also in a plastic bag. Initially, Singapore police could only determine that the body parts belonged to a Caucasian, and they had a possible name after receiving <b>a</b> <b>missing</b> <b>person</b> report for Lowe from the South African High Commission. Vanessa Lowe filed the report because she was distressed that her husband, who used to make daily contact with his family when overseas, had not called home or returned to South Africa by 12 March. Lowe's colleagues at work also tried to determine his whereabouts through personal contacts in Singapore. On 1 April, she confirmed that the body parts were her husband's through visual identification. However, his arms and head were never found.|$|E

Shruti files <b>a</b> <b>missing</b> <b>person</b> report for Jhilmil. The Darjeeling police learn about the report, resume their pursuit of Barfi and arrest him. As he is being interrogated, another ransom demand for Jhilmil is made and she is apparently killed in the process of the exchange, though her body is never found. In order to conclude the case, the police try to frame Barfi for Jhilmil's murder. Policeman Sudhanshu Dutta, who grew fond of Barfi after investigating him for his nuisances, asks Shruti to take him away, offering him a second chance at life. She agrees and hopes that now Jhilmil is gone, she can finally be with Barfi.|$|E

5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) asks to {{be a part}} of the {{investigation}} looking for a little girl, Amber Lynn LaPierre, who disappeared from her home in Sacramento, California. Mulder's superior, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), initially denies his request, noting that {{the investigation}} is not an X-file, but simply a missing persons case. Mulder, however, convinces Skinner to allow him to investigate. The parents of Amber, Billie and Bud, tell Mulder that they found a note in the girl's bedroom, but the teaser for the episode revealed that the note was written by Billie herself. The note contains a mention of Santa Claus, which everyone finds out of place. Although the family is held for questioning, Mulder does not believe they did it. Looking through previous cases, Mulder finds a similar note, with a reference to Santa Claus, from <b>a</b> <b>missing</b> <b>person</b> case in Idaho from 1987. In the case, the mother was convicted and sentenced to twelve years. The file notes that she had a vision of her son dead before he disappeared, as did Bud on the night his daughter disappeared.|$|E
5|$|When the Griffin family {{decide to}} go for a hike in the local woods, Chris and Stewie get lost while chasing after a {{floating}} butterfly. As a result, they go missing for several days, with only limited supplies. As Lois is at her wits' end, she decides to see a psychic medium who assures her of the children's safety and well being. Eventually the boys are found and rescued by Bruce, and returned to their home in Quahog which only furthers Lois's psychic obsession to the annoyance of a skeptical Brian. In defiance of Lois's assertion that extrasensory perception exists, Brian has Peter perform a cold reading on a passerby in the park in order to demonstrate that psychic readings are purely an act, and not real. However, Peter is struck by his success as a medium, convincing himself that he actually has extrasensory perception, and decides to capitalize on it by opening his own psychic readings business and performing in front of a live audience. Soon after, Peter's bluff is finally called when Joe requests his help in a frantic search for <b>a</b> <b>missing</b> <b>person</b> who has been strapped to a bomb. Peter stalls for time during the search (as he just wants to feel the victim's daughter's breasts), eventually resulting in a gruesome death when the bomb explodes, prompting Peter to flatly admit that he actually has no psychic powers whatsoever.|$|E

25|$|Vivian Alvarez Solon (born 30 October 1962) is an Australian who was unlawfully {{removed to}} the Philippines by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) in July 2001. In May 2005, it became public {{knowledge}} {{that she had}} been deported, although DIMIA knew of its mistake in 2003. Solon's family had listed her as <b>a</b> <b>missing</b> <b>person</b> since July 2003, and until May 2005, did not know {{that she had been}} deported. The circumstances surrounding Solon's unlawful deportation have caused much controversy in the Australian media.|$|E
25|$|In July 2003, the Missing Persons Bureau in Queensland {{contacted}} DIMIA with an enquiry about Solon, who {{had been}} listed as <b>a</b> <b>missing</b> <b>person</b> for two years. Two DIMIA officers in Canberra conducted searches of records, and made a match between Vivian Solon (as she was known to the missing persons authorities) and Vivian Alvarez (as she was known to DIMIA – Alvarez is her middle name). They told their supervisor (referred to in the Comrie Report as officer 'A') on 14 July that an Australian citizen had been deported, but the supervisor did nothing.|$|E

Neither Dowler's clothes, nor any of the possessions—the purse, rucksack or mobile phone—she had with her {{at the time of her}} disappearance have ever been recovered. The discovery of the body led the police to reclassify the case from <b>a</b> <b>missing</b> <b>person</b> to a homicide investigation.

DIMIA replied that she had not left, and was still in the country.|$|E
25|$|DIMIA {{officers}} first interviewed Solon on 3 May 2001.

40|$|Purpose: The {{application}} of situation calculus for knowledge representation in <b>missing</b> <b>persons</b> investigations. Design/methodology/approach: The {{development of a}} knowledge representation model for the <b>missing</b> <b>persons</b> investigation process based upon situation calculus, with {{a demonstration of the}} use of the model for <b>a</b> <b>missing</b> <b>persons</b> example case. Findings: Situation calculus is valuable for knowledge representation for <b>missing</b> <b>persons</b> investigations, since such investigations have state changes over time, and due to the complexity of the differing investigation activities applicable to different situations, can be difficult to represent using simpler approaches such as tables or flowcharts. Research limitations/implications: Situation calculus modelling for <b>missing</b> <b>persons</b> investigations adds formalism to the process beyond that which can be afforded by the current use of text, tables or flowcharts. The additional formalism is useful in dealing with the uncertainty present in such investigations. Practical implications: A simplification of the {{application of}} the current police guidelines, and thoroughness in the application of such guidelines for <b>missing</b> <b>persons</b> investigations via situation calculus modelling. Social implications: Supporting the management of <b>missing</b> <b>person</b> investigations, by utilizing the most critical variables in <b>a</b> <b>missing</b> <b>persons</b> investigation to determine relevant investigation and search activities applicable to the circumstances of a given case. Originality/value: The novelty of the knowledge representation approach is the application of situation calculus via state and action vectors and a matrix of fluents to the process of <b>missing</b> <b>persons</b> investigations...|$|R
