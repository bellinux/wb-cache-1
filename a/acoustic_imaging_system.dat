40|$|In virtual <b>acoustic</b> <b>imaging</b> <b>systems,</b> the {{perception}} of a sound source anywhere in space can theoretically be reproduced for one listener by using only two loudspeaker and an appropriate set of filters, called crosstalk cancellation (CTC) filters. However, the ideal position of the loudspeakers in such systems is still a question that is currently addressed by many researchers. Several analytical models {{with varying degrees of}} complexity have been used to analyze this matter. The fact is that, so far, all implemented CTC systems were built for a single listener use. When it comes to two listener CTC systems, the conditioning of the matrix of transfer functions between the loudspeakers and the listener&# 039;s ear seems to be more irregular than the conditioning of the matrix for a one listener CTC system. Using a simplified model made it possible to verify that the position of the sound sources also plays a major role as far as the two listeners system&# 039;s performance is concerned. Now, the influence of the presence of the listener&# 039;s head in this model is evaluated.

40|$|The {{research}} {{topic of}} this thesis {{is the use}} of inverse filtering for the design and implementation of two-channel virtual <b>acoustic</b> <b>imaging</b> <b>systems</b> that utilise loudspeakers. The basic objective of such systems is to invert the electroacoustic plant between the input to the loudspeakers and the output at the listener’s ears and hence make it possible for a pair of binaural signals to be locally reproduced at the position of the listener’s ears. As a starting point for the research presented, a previously introduced type of inverse filtering design is considered in which the inverse is implemented with FIR filters. The basic formulation of this design is described and a number of innovative points regarding its implementation are made. An experimental procedure is then formulated for the evaluation of the effectiveness of this inverse filtering design that is based on objective measurements of the inversion process. Unlike previously employed methods that are based on computer simulations or subjective experiments, the introduced experimental procedure is shown to be very efficient in isolating and exactly quantifying the effect on the accuracy of the inversion of a number of errors and approximations typically present in the implementation. A detailed evaluation is thus presented of the inverse filtering design at hand in realistic conditions of implementation. Subsequently, a novel method for the off-line implementation of the inverse filtering is presented that utilises recursive filters of lower order. In this method, the responses of the inverse filters are decomposed into two parts, one realisable in forward time and one in backward time. The effectiveness of this new method for the implementation of the inverse is tested and compared with a small selection of the objective evaluation results described above. Finally, an algorithm for the on-line implementation of the forward-backward inverse filtering is proposed and its computational cost is compared with the currently available frequency-domain block-processing filtering algorithms.

30|$|The {{point target}} {{reference}} spectrum (PTRS) {{is an important}} basis to focus the SAIS signal in the frequency domain where the time-consuming superposition integrals in the space time domain is substituted by the fast convolution in the frequency domain [6, 7]. Thus, the processing efficiency can be highly improved. The {{focus of this article}} is to exploit the potentialities of an analytical spectrum model for FMCW SAIS system with both acoustic source and electromagnetic wave. Unlike conventional pulse SAR system, the signal PTRS model is based on the stop-and-go approximation, which assumes that the instantaneous slant range remains constant during the pulse duration time [6]. The analytical FMCW SAIS PTRS generally expresses FMCW SAIS signal by accurately addressing the variation of the instantaneous slant range during the pulse duration time [2]. This variation introduces a range-invariant range walk and a range–azimuth coupling term [2, 7] (range–azimuth coupling term is a spectrum phase term which is dependent on both range and azimuth frequency variables at the same time). In [5], the author developed a signal model under synthetic aperture <b>acoustic</b> (SAA) <b>imaging</b> <b>system,</b> where the invalidation of stop-and-go approximation is taken into account. It is assumed that the time from the transmitter to the reflector equals to half of the round-trip delay.
