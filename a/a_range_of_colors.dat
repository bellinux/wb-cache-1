Hydnellum packii produces gray, brown, and olive colors. Hydnuferrugin and hydnuferruginin are pigments responsible for the coloration of H. ferrugineum and H. zonatum. Geogenin is a yellow pigment found in H. geogenium.|$|E
5|$|The ancient Egyptians could {{fabricate}} a {{wide variety}} of objects from glass with great skill, {{but it is not clear}} whether they developed the process independently. It is also unclear whether they made their own raw glass or merely imported pre-made ingots, which they melted and finished. However, they did have technical expertise in making objects, as well as adding trace elements to control the color of the finished glass. <b>A</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>colors</b> could be produced, including yellow, red, green, blue, purple, and white, and the glass could be made either transparent or opaque.|$|E
5|$|Very rarely (about 1 in 10,000 conchs), a conch pearl may {{be found}} within the mantle. Though they occur in <b>a</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>colors</b> {{corresponding}} to {{the colors of the}} interior of the shell, pink specimens are the most valuable. These pearls are considered semi-precious, and a popular tourist curio. The best specimens have been used to create necklaces and earrings. A conch pearl is a non-nacreous pearl (formerly referred to by some sources as a 'calcareous concretion') which differs from most pearls that are sold as gemstones.|$|E

25|$|The beaver's fur {{consists}} of long, coarse outer hairs and short, fine inner hairs (see Double coat). The fur has <b>a</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>colors,</b> but usually is dark brown. Scent glands near the genitals secrete an oily substance known as castoreum, which the beaver uses to waterproof its fur.|$|E
25|$|Crude oil (petroleum) fluoresces in <b>a</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>colors,</b> from dull-brown {{for heavy}} oils and tars through to bright-yellowish and bluish-white for very light oils and condensates.

25|$|The {{earliest}} known pigments were natural minerals. Natural {{iron oxides}} give <b>a</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>colors</b> and {{are found in}} many Paleolithic and Neolithic cave paintings. Two examples include Red Ochre, anhydrous Fe2O3, and the hydrated Yellow Ochre (Fe2O3.H2O). Charcoal, or carbon black, has also {{been used as a}} black pigment since prehistoric times.|$|E

25|$|Many organisms {{have evolved}} to produce light in <b>a</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>colors.</b> At the {{molecular}} level, the difference in color arises from the degree of conjugation of the molecule, when an electron drops down from the excited state to the ground state. Deep sea organisms {{have evolved to}} produce light to lure and catch prey, as camouflage, or to attract others. Some bacteria even use bioluminescence to communicate. The common colors for the light emitted by these animals are blue and green because they have shorter wavelength than red and can transmit more easily in water.|$|E
25|$|Depending {{on their}} {{location}} and altitude, A. pallipes {{can vary from}} 9.05mm-9.21mm in length and are yellow with black maculation. Their head displays <b>a</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>colors</b> of black, yellow and brown. Their bodily terga vary from yellow to brown and black. Their legs and wings are also yellow. There is clear dimorphism between queens (egg-layers) and sterile female workers with the former displaying physical superiority and size in 17 of 22 characteristics relating to the head, mesosoma, metasoma and wings. There is also clear dimorphism between ovary development of the two different castes of females. Longer and developed ovaries are seen in queens whereas short, thread-like ovaries are seen in workers. There is a stark absence of no transitional females (workers with developed ovaries) thus showing unambiguous division between castes. Furthermore, what separates workers from queens {{is the presence of}} a brown or black stripe on the humeri.|$|E
25|$|Fluorescence in {{minerals}} {{is caused}} by a wide range of activators. In some cases, the concentration of the activator must be restricted to below a certain level, to prevent quenching of the fluorescent emission. Furthermore, the mineral must be free of impurities such as iron or copper, to prevent quenching of possible fluorescence. Divalent manganese, in concentrations of up to several percent, is responsible for the red or orange fluorescence of calcite, the green fluorescence of willemite, the yellow fluorescence of esperite, and the orange fluorescence of wollastonite and clinohedrite. Hexavalent uranium, {{in the form of the}} uranyl cation, fluoresces at all concentrations in a yellow green, and is the cause of fluorescence of minerals such as autunite or andersonite, and, at low concentration, is the cause of the fluorescence of such materials as some samples of hyalite opal. Trivalent chromium at low concentration is the source of the red fluorescence of ruby. Divalent europium is the source of the blue fluorescence, when seen in the mineral fluorite. Trivalent lanthanides such as terbium and dysprosium are the principal activators of the creamy yellow fluorescence exhibited by the yttrofluorite variety of the mineral fluorite, and contribute to the orange fluorescence of zircon. Powellite (calcium molybdate) and scheelite (calcium tungstate) fluoresce intrinsically in yellow and blue, respectively. When present together in solid solution, energy is transferred from the higher-energy tungsten to the lower-energy molybdenum, such that fairly low levels of molybdenum are sufficient to cause a yellow emission for scheelite, instead of blue. Low-iron sphalerite (zinc sulfide), fluoresces and phosphoresces in <b>a</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>colors,</b> influenced by the presence of various trace impurities.|$|E
50|$|Color tools {{can vary}} in their interface. Some may use sliders, buttons, text boxes for color values, or direct manipulation. Often a two {{dimensional}} square is used to create <b>a</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>color</b> values (such as lightness and saturation) that can be clicked on or selected in some other manner. Drag and drop, color droppers, and various other forms of interfaces are commonly used as well.|$|R

500|$|The first shoe {{polish to}} {{resemble}} the modern varieties (aimed primarily at inducing shine) were the British and British Commonwealth brands like Cherry Blossom, Kiwi and Wren's. An advertisement published in March 1947 by Wren's claimed that William Wren originated the first wax polish in 1889. As the advertisement was endorsed with the Royal Warrant, its claim would be deemed creditable. However, the most well known brand was Kiwi. Scottish expatriates William Ramsay and Hamilton McKellan began making [...] "boot polish" [...] in a small factory in 1904 in Melbourne, Australia. Their formula was a major improvement on previous brands. It preserved shoe leather, made it shine, and restored color. By the time Kiwi Dark Tan was released in 1908, it incorporated agents that added suppleness and water resistance. Australian-made boot polish was then considered the world's best. Black and <b>a</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>colors</b> became available, and exports to Britain, continental Europe, and New Zealand began, although the polish is now made in the Far East. Previously owned by the Sara Lee Corporation since 1984, Kiwi was sold in 2011 to SC Johnson.|$|E
