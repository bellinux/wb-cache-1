5|$|Etty died in 1849, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>work</b> {{enjoyed a}} brief boom in popularity. Interest in him {{declined}} over time, {{and by the}} end of the 19th century the value of all his paintings had fallen below their original levels. Following his death, nude paintings went out of fashion very rapidly in Britain.|$|E

5|$|After his much publicized {{problems}} on the base paths the previous season, Kemp arrived at spring training early to work with new Dodger coach Davey Lopes on his base running. Kemp announced his intention to steal 40 bases this season and Lopes hoped they would be high percentage steals. At {{the end of the}} season, Kemp had the 40 steals and was only caught 11 times, a significant improvement in percentage from the previous year, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>work</b> with Lopes was credited for much of the improvement.|$|E

I later became interest ed in the various literary trends that appear in <b>his</b> <b>works.</b> Hence, {{the purpose of this study}} is to give an appreciation of Gustavo Adolfo Bécquer <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>works.</b> Switzer, Rebecca, Dr. Moore, Jerome, Dr...|$|R

5|$|Alkan's {{attachment}} to his Jewish origins is displayed both {{in his life}} <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>work.</b> He was the first composer to incorporate Jewish melodies in art music. Fluent in Hebrew and Greek, he devoted much time to a complete new translation of the Bible into French. This work, {{like many of his}} musical compositions, is now lost. Alkan never married, but his presumed son Élie-Miriam Delaborde was, like Alkan, a virtuoso performer on both the piano and the pedal piano, and edited a number of the elder composer's works.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{was never}} a {{vigorous}} apologist for that tradition, he always maintained the standards of clarity and rigour which it prizes, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>work</b> {{is a model of}} all that is best in the tradition. It is brilliant, deep, and imaginative. It is also extraordinarily tight. There cannot be many critics of his work who have not thought of some objection to what he says, only to find, on looking for a relevant quotation to turn into a target, that Williams carefully presents his views in a way that precisely anticipates the objection.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of his writing, {{at the time of his}} death Wallace had been for many years a {{well-known}} figure both as a scientist and as a social activist. He was often sought out by journalists and others for his views on a variety of topics. He received honorary doctorates and a number of professional honours, such the Royal Society's Royal Medal and Darwin Medal in 1868 and 1890 respectively, and the Order of Merit in 1908. Above all, his role as the co-discoverer of natural selection <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>work</b> on zoogeography marked him out as an exceptional figure.|$|E

5|$|Beginning with Michel Zink, whose {{influential}} 1979 monograph Roman rose et rose rouge: Le Roman de la rose ou de Guillaume de Dole {{ushered in}} a new era of criticism, critics have recognized Guillaume de Dole as a work of literature about literature, a self-referential poem that comments on the improbability of some of its own plot elements and on its own fictional status, encouraging a trend in studies of Renart <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E
5|$|Beyond architecture, Burges {{designed}} metalwork, sculpture, jewellery, {{furniture and}} stained glass. Art Applied to Industry, {{a series of}} lectures he gave to the Society of Arts in 1864, illustrates the breadth of his interests; the topics covered including glass, pottery, brass and iron, gold and silver, furniture, the weaver's art and external architectural decoration. For most of the century following his death, Victorian architecture was neither the subject of intensive study nor sympathetic attention and Burges's work was largely ignored. However the revival of interest in Victorian art, architecture, and design in the later twentieth century {{has led to a}} renewed appreciation of Burges <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E
5|$|George Forbes was {{the first}} to {{postulate}} the existence of trans-Neptunian planets in 1880, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>work</b> is considered similar to more recent Planet Nine theories. In Forbes's model the planet had a semi-major axis of ∼300 AU (roughly three hundred times the distance from Earth to the Sun); locations were based on clustering of the aphelion distances of periodic comets.|$|E

5|$|His {{plays and}} songs {{achieved}} new {{popularity in the}} 1960s and 1970s, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>work</b> and style continue to influence popular culture. Coward did not publicly acknowledge his homosexuality, but it was discussed candidly after his death by biographers including Graham Payn, his long-time partner, and in Coward's diaries and letters, published posthumously. The former Albery Theatre (originally the New Theatre) in London was renamed the Noël Coward Theatre in his honour in 2006.|$|E
5|$|In 1899, Pope Leo XIII {{declared}} him a Doctor of the Church. He is {{the only}} native of Great Britain to achieve this designation; Anselm of Canterbury, also a Doctor of the Church, was originally from Italy. Bede was moreover a skilled linguist and translator, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>work</b> made the Latin and Greek writings of the early Church Fathers much more accessible to his fellow Anglo-Saxons, which contributed significantly to English Christianity. Bede's monastery had access to an impressive library which included works by Eusebius, Orosius, and many others.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, he {{resigned}} from Square to form his own music company, Basiscape, {{through which he}} continues to compose music for games, along with some anime series. Basiscape has expanded since its founding to 10 composers, and is currently the largest independent video game music production company. In addition to video game soundtracks, over the years Sakimoto has also worked on projects such as anime series and vocal albums. His music has been played at numerous music concerts by {{groups such as the}} Eminence Symphony Orchestra, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>work</b> on Final Fantasy XII has been arranged for the piano and published as sheet music.|$|E

5|$|In the 1920s, Negus {{worked on}} aspects of both throat surgery and {{the anatomy of}} the larynx, the latter work {{contributing}} to his degree of Master of Surgery (1924). His surgical innovations included designs for laryngoscopes, bronchoscopes, oesophagoscopes, an operating table, and tracheotomy equipment. His major publications were The Mechanism of the Larynx (1929) <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>work</b> on the clinical text Diseases of the Nose and Throat, starting with the fourth edition of 1937. Negus was also awarded several lectureships and published many medical papers and other works on comparative anatomy and laryngology. He became a senior surgeon at King's College Hospital in 1940 and a consulting surgeon in 1946.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, Blatty worked {{as the public}} {{relations}} director at Loyola University of Los Angeles and as a publicity director at the University of Southern California. He published his first book, Which Way to Mecca, Jack? in 1960, a humorous look at both his early life, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>work</b> at the United States Information Agency in Lebanon. In 1961, while still working in public relations, Blatty appeared as a contestant on the Groucho Marx quiz show You Bet Your Life, winning $10,000, enough money to quit his job and to write full-time. Thereafter, he never held a regular job.|$|E
5|$|In {{the romantic}} period, typified by Sylves (1927) and Volumes (1928), Rabearivelo's poems are shorter and reflect a purer form of {{traditional}} models. He identified himself <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>work</b> as post-symbolist {{in the early}} part of his artistic career. Regarding Rabearivelo's works from this period, editor Jacques Rabemananjara acknowledged the poet's evident talent but critiqued his over-adherence to form and poetic conventions at the expense of innovation and genuine self-expression.|$|E

5|$|Leonardo's fame {{within his}} own {{lifetime}} was such that the King of France carried him away like a trophy, and was claimed to have supported him in his old age and held him in his arms as he died. Interest in Leonardo <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>work</b> has never diminished. Crowds still queue to see his best-known artworks, T-shirts still bear his most famous drawing, and writers continue to hail him as a genius while speculating about his private life, as well as about what one so intelligent actually believed in.|$|E
5|$|Marx {{has been}} {{described}} {{as one of the most}} influential figures in human history <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>work</b> has been both lauded and criticised. His work in economics laid the basis for much of the current understanding of labour and its relation to capital, and subsequent economic thought. Many intellectuals, labour unions, artists and political parties worldwide have been influenced by Marx's work, with many modifying or adapting his ideas. Marx is typically cited as one of the principal architects of modern social science.|$|E
5|$|Musidora was {{extremely}} well received when first exhibited, and {{considered one of}} the finest works by an English artist. Etty died in 1849 <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>work</b> rapidly went out of fashion. At the same time, the topic of Musidora itself became a cliche, and from the 1870s Thomson's writings faded into obscurity. Etty's Musidora is likely to have influenced The Knight Errant by John Everett Millais, but other than that has had little influence on subsequent works. The Tate's version of the painting was exhibited in major exhibitions in 2001–02 in London and in 2011–12 in York.|$|E
