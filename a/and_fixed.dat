5|$|A third {{approach}} achieves some of {{the output}} benefits of tracking, with a lesser penalty in terms of land area, capital and operating cost. This involves tracking the sun in one dimension – in its daily journey across the sky – but not adjusting for the seasons.

5|$|Europa Barbarorum {{was first}} {{released}} to the public as an open beta in December 2005. After several more minor releases throughout 2006 which mostly fixed bugs and made small adjustments to the modification, the next major release of Europa Barbarorum was version 0.80 in December 2006. Its changes included the addition of the Sabaean faction, new music, and the inclusion of a new military–industrial complex system. There were three more 0.8-series releases {{during the first half of}} 2007 which primarily made minor adjustments to the modification <b>and</b> <b>fixed</b> bugs. In total, over 135,000 downloads of the 0.80–0.81 versions were tracked.|$|E
5|$|Finally, Brian Reynolds {{discussed}} {{the use of}} the demo in the development process. Originally a marketing tool released prior to the game, they started getting feedback.

According to Brian Reynolds, they made improvement in the game's interface, added a couple of new features <b>and</b> <b>fixed</b> a few glitches. They also improved some rules, fine-tuned the game balance and improved the AI. Finally, he adds that they continued to add patches to enhance the game after the game was released.|$|E
5|$|On 21 July 1768, Endeavour {{sailed to}} Galleon's Reach {{to take on}} armaments to protect her against {{potentially}} hostile Pacific island natives.

Twelve swivel guns were also supplied, <b>and</b> <b>fixed</b> to posts along the quarterdeck, sides and bow. The ship departed for Plymouth on 30 July, for provisioning and to board her crew of 85, including 12Royal Marines. Cook also ordered that twelve tons of pig iron be brought on board as sailing ballast.|$|E
30|$|This method detects <b>and</b> <b>fixes</b> cycle slip on a satellite-wise, {{real-time}} basis. The cycle slip detection <b>and</b> <b>fix</b> {{for each}} satellite is completely independent {{and does not}} rely on the information of any other satellites. The success of this method heavily relies {{on the use of}} the ionospheric physical property: TECR not exceeding the specified TECR threshold. Taking advantage of this property, cycle slip detection <b>and</b> <b>fix</b> is still successful even if all the GNSS satellites of a given epoch simultaneously experience arbitrarily large SIPE and any kind of cycle slips in the carrier phase data. The only disadvantage of the current method is that the parameter SIPEmax needs to be specified in advance before actual cycle slip detection <b>and</b> <b>fix.</b> Thus a sufficiently large value has to be defined to prepare for the worst situation. This might unnecessarily increase computational burden.|$|R

5|$|Teams {{choosing}} {{to develop new}} air vehicle types have never won, as they are disadvantaged in comparison to those which adapt existing, working, air vehicles, and can therefore concentrate on performing the mission rather than developing something that will fly at all. As a result, adaptations of conventional rotary wing <b>and</b> <b>fixed</b> wing entries {{have always been the}} overall winners, with airships and ducted fans a close second.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} was easily recognisable by its inverted gull wings <b>and</b> <b>fixed</b> spatted undercarriage. Upon the leading edges of its faired main gear legs were mounted the Jericho-Trompete (Jericho trumpet) wailing sirens, becoming the propaganda symbol of German air {{power and the}} blitzkrieg victories of 1939–1942. The Stuka's design included several innovative features, including automatic pull-up dive brakes under both wings {{to ensure that the}} aircraft recovered from its attack dive even if the pilot blacked out from the high g-forces.|$|E

Some constants in that expression do not contribute significantly to the uncertainty; only the significant factors are noted. The value of the relative uncertainty by the data of CODATA of 2014 is given, and is expressed in the relative uncertainty of the significant factors, noted with ur(constant). An approximately equals sign (≈) is used if an uncertainty is only approximated by the expression. This is due to unsignificant factors or rounding errors.|$|E

5|$|Unlike the B-1A, the B-1B cannot reach Mach2+ speeds; {{its maximum}} speed is Mach1.25 (about 950mph or 1,530km/h at altitude), but its {{low-level}} speed increased to Mach0.92 (700mph, 1,130km/h). The {{speed of the}} current version of the aircraft is limited by the need to avoid damage to its structure and air intakes. To help lower its radar cross section (RCS), the B-1B uses serpentine air intake ducts (see S-duct) <b>and</b> <b>fixed</b> intake ramps, which limit its speed compared to the B-1A. Vanes in the intake ducts serve to deflect and shield radar emissions from the highly reflective engine compressor blades.|$|E
5|$|With a {{molecular}} formula of C3H4Cl2F2O and a condensed structural formula of CHCl2CF2OCH3, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) name for methoxyflurane is 2,2-dichloro-1,1-difluoro-1-methoxyethane.

From the ticket hall enclosed stairs descend to the platforms under integral concrete canopies on paired piers in alternating broad and narrow bay formation.
