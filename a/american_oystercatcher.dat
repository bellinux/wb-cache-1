40|$|We {{investigate}} parental food provisioning and chick {{growth to}} better understand how parental effort and territory structure relate to reproductive success in the <b>American</b> Black <b>Oystercatcher.</b> <b>American</b> Black <b>Oystercatcher</b> chick diet was comprised mainly of limpets. Most prey items were 20 mm or shorter in length. Provisioning rates (kJ h- 1) were significantly correlated with mean delivery rates rather than mean prey size, and higher provisioning rates resulted from {{a greater number of}} deliveries of small prey items. Provisioning rates were extremely variable among pairs but increased significantly with brood size and brood age. Larger brood sizes occurred more frequently on shallow sloped territories, therefore provisioning rates were significantly higher on shallow sloped than steep sloped territories. Provisioning rates appeared to decrease with increasing intertidal slope, a trend significantly supported by the growth patterns of the slow-growing chick in multi-chick broods. The effect of intertidal slope became more important when chicks were older and demand was higher, with parents occupying shallow territories achieving higher provisioning rates to older chicks relative to parents on steep territories. We discuss the hypothesis that <b>American</b> Black <b>Oystercatcher</b> parents adjust parental effort with respect to territory quality and propose possible parental adjustment mechanisms...|$|R
50|$|The Refuge’s {{undisturbed}} coastal salt marshes, tidal creeks, and tidal flats {{are some}} of the most productive ecosystems in the world.

50|$|The {{local chapter}} of the National Audubon Society has {{recorded}} the presence of 104 different species of birds on Figure Eight. Most live in Rich Inlet, generally considered the southernmost nesting area for the critically endangered Great Lakes piping plover. In 2015, approximately 800 Least Tern nested on northern section of the island, making it the largest Least Tern colony in the state, and one of the largest on the Eastern seaboard. Other birds that nested there include <b>American</b> <b>Oystercatchers,</b> Common Terns, Black Skimmers, Piping Plovers, Wilson’s Plovers and Willets. Savannah Sparrows, Atlantic Plovers, Greater Yellowlegs, and pelicans have been found in Mason Inlet to the south.|$|R

40|$|Rising {{sea levels}} in the mid-Atlantic region pose a {{long-term}} threat to marshes and their avian inhabitants. Gull-billed Terns (Sterna nilotica), Common Terns (S. hirundo), Black Skimmers (Rynchops niger), and <b>American</b> <b>Oystercatchers</b> (Haematopus palliatus) nest on low, shell edges of salt marsh islands in coastal Virginia. Marsh shellpiles are free of mammalian predators, but subject to frequent floods that reduce reproductive success. Previous studies of these species suggested that elevation was an important nest-site determinant (Lauro and Burger 1989). To test this, we created twenty-eight 4 m 2 elevated shell plots, with matched controls, at 5 shellpile sites to examine habitat selection. We monitored nest-site choice and fate of each species from May 1 to August 1, 2002. Forty-seven percent of early season nests were destroyed during a flood on June 7. Only 4 % of late season nests were lost to floods. Only 5 % of pairs of all species nested in elevated plots, although the plots were immune from flooding. Common Tern nests were significantly lower in elevation than random points at 3 shellpiles and were often on low-lying areas exposed to open water. Common Terns had higher hatching success at higher elevations, and in the late season. Gull-billed Terns, Black Skimmers, and <b>American</b> <b>Oystercatchers</b> primarily chose sites at higher elevations in areas protected from flooding; however 56 % of Gull-billed Tern nests were flooded at one site. Flooding has {{a significant impact on}} waterbird breeding success on low-lying shellpiles and is likely to increase with rising sea levels; however, our experiment met with limited success in improving breeding success. We suspect previous experience at sites may bias nest-site choices...|$|R
50|$|The <b>American</b> <b>oystercatcher</b> has {{distinctive}} {{black and}} white plumage and a long, bright orange beak. The head and breast are black and the back, wings and tail greyish-black. The underparts are white, as are feathers on the inner part of the wing which become visible during flight. The irises are yellow and the eyes have orange orbital rings. The legs are pink. Adults are between 42-52 cm in length.|$|E
50|$|The black {{oystercatcher}} {{is the only}} representative of the oystercatcher family (Haematopodidae) over most of its range, overlapping slightly with the <b>American</b> <b>oystercatcher</b> (H. palliatus) {{on the coast of}} Baja California. Within its range it is most commonly referred to as the {{black oystercatcher}}, although this name is also used locally for the blackish oystercatcher and the African oystercatcher. Its scientific name is derived by John James Audubon from that of his friend John Bachman.|$|E
50|$|These are gregarious birds. Their diet {{consists}} {{primarily of}} insects, carrion, and food items obtained through kleptoparasitism from other birds. In particular they steal crabs from the red-gartered coot (Fulica armillata) and clams from the <b>American</b> <b>oystercatcher</b> (Haematopus palliatus). The profitability of stealing from these birds is 3.5 times {{higher for the}} coots than the oystercatchers. They build floating nests among aquatic vegetation {{at the edges of}} ponds and lakes. Three to four eggs are usually laid.|$|E
5000|$|Woodland lanes {{lined with}} stately live oaks, glistening tidal flats thronged with {{sandpipers}} and terns, and broad, sweeping salt marshes where wading birds abound—these {{are just a}} few of the memorable landscapes waiting for visitors along the Georgia coast. Practically anywhere in this region can be good for birding, but to find the best of the best, binocular-clad travelers can focus on the 18 sites featured on this birding trail. Most of these locations are also designated Important Bird Areas, underscoring how vital they are to all sorts of migrating birds that stream by. Birds like black skimmers, clapper rails, and <b>American</b> <b>oystercatchers</b> may be found in every season, and fall migration brings many more, including piping plovers and varied songbird flocks.|$|R
40|$|Many {{species of}} {{shorebirds}} (Charadrii) are long-distance migrants {{that rely on}} disturbance-free stopover sites with abundant food. Adequate protection of stopover sites requires knowledge of migration chronology, effects of anthropogenic disturbances, and factors affecting habitat selection. We studied shorebird migration ecology at Monomoy National Wildlife Refuge (Refuge), Cape Cod, Massachusetts, {{one of the most}} important shorebird stopover sites in eastern North America. Our findings can be implemented by land managers in the future to maintain the integrity of this stopover site. ^ In the first manuscript, we studied seasonal variation in shorebird abundance during migration and determined peak periods of human use. Peak shorebird densities during southward migration (48 - 52 shorebird-use-days ha- 1) were approximately three to five times greater than northward migration (9 - 15 shorebird-use-days ha- 1), but were similar between years. We detected 22 species, but six species accounted for 87 % of all shorebirds detected. Two migration strategies emerged with species either exhibiting a rather short, distinct window of migration, or a protracted migration. We documented low density human use in both years (0. 018 ± 0. 003 humans ha- 1 in 2006 and 0. 008 ± 0. 001 humans ha- 1 in 2007). ^ In the second manuscript, we determined shorebird flush distances (to pedestrians) and recommended buffer distances to reduce disturbance. We also examined effects of shellfishing activity on shorebird abundance. Smaller shorebird species generally had shorter flush distances compared to larger species. Age was the most influential variable; juveniles generally flushed at closer distances than adults. Recommended buffer distances ranged from 50 m for Dunlins (Calidris alpina) to over 200 m for Black-bellied Plovers (Pluvialis squatarola). <b>American</b> <b>Oystercatchers</b> (Haematopus palliatus) and Ruddy Turnstones (Arenaria interpres) were the only species whose densities were correlated (positively) with shellfishing. ^ In the last manuscript, we examined the spatial distribution of shorebirds using mudflats at lower tides, and evaluated the importance of physical and biological variables in observed shorebird densities. All species exhibited clumped distributions which varied between years and between species. Habitat types (preference for mudflat over saltmarsh), water depth (generally presence of shallow water), and prey densities (especially annelids and horseshoe crab eggs) were all important variables influencing shorebird densities. ...|$|R
40|$|Morphometric {{differences}} {{between males and}} females are a common feature among oystercatcher species (Hockey 1996), although breeding partners often appear similar when observed from a distance. Combinations of different biometric parameters such as bill size and shape, body mass, wing and tarsus lengths have been used to discriminate males and females in the field in European Oystercatchers Haematopus ostralegus (Zwarts et al. 1996), <b>American</b> Black <b>Oystercatchers</b> Haematopus bachmani (Guzzetti et al. 2008) and the three oystercatcher species present in New Zealand (Baker 1973). Sexual dimorphism also occurs in the African Black Oystercatcher Haematopus moquini, an endemic species living on the coasts of Namibia and South Africa. In this species, females tend to have longer and sharper bills than males (Hockey 1981, Hockey 2005). However, sex determination based solely on this parameter can be inaccurate because the ranges of bill size {{between males and females}} overlap. Variations in bill morphology between sites and/or regions may also occur in relation to feeding habits and prey assemblages (Hulscher 1996). Another way to sex oystercatchers is checking for cloacal distension in females during the period immediately after egg laying. Although molecular markers remain the most reliable tool for sexing non-ratite birds (Fridolfsson and Ellegren 1999), these techniques require capturing the birds, are relatively expensive and the 25 between the CHD 1 W and CHD 1 Z introns located on the sex chromosomes (Fridolfsson and Ellegren 1999) ...|$|R

50|$|The Labrador duck {{was also}} known as the pied duck and skunk duck, the former being a vernacular name that it shared with the surf scoter and the common {{goldeneye}} (and even the <b>American</b> <b>oystercatcher),</b> a fact that has led to difficulties in interpreting old records of these species. Both names refer to the male's striking white/black piebald coloration. Yet another common name was sand shoal duck, referring to its habit of feeding in shallow water. The closest evolutionary relatives of the Labrador duck are apparently the scoters (Melanitta).|$|E
5000|$|The <b>American</b> <b>oystercatcher</b> {{is found}} on the Atlantic coast of North America from New England to {{northern}} Florida, where it is also {{found on the}} Gulf coast, and south to Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina. It is found also in the Pacific coast of California, Mexico, Central America, Peru, and Chile. [...] In the 19th century they became locally extinct in the northeast of the United States due to market hunting and egg collecting. After receiving protection under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, their range extended northward to re-occupy historical habitat in New England.|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{evidence}} suggests that the occurrence and magnitude of trophic cascades are highly context-dependent, yet the mechanisms mediating these indirect effects remain difficult to detect and predict. We examined the strength of evidence for a cross-system trophic cascade whereby invasive terrestrial predators (Norway rats, Rattus norvegicus) were hypothesized to directly reduce avian shoreline predators and indirectly magnify intertidal macroinvertebrates, thereby reducing macroalgal biomass. Simultaneously, we quantified the extent to which wave intensity mediated these indirect effects. We found that densities of successful <b>American</b> Black <b>Oystercatcher</b> (Haematopus bachmani) breeding pairs were, on average, 50 % lower on rat-invaded than rat-free islands. Furthermore, we detected evidence for an effect of rats on grazer biomass (Wi= 0. 996) and this effect was reduced on wave exposed islands. We found no consistent pattern however, in grazer density between rat-free and rat-infested islands, regardless of wave exposure intensity or quantification method. Sheltered islands with rats had 74 % less macroalgal biomass than those without, whereas exposed rat-invaded islands had 39 % less macroalgal biomass than their rat free counterparts. Consequently, we found strong evidence that the mediating effect of wave exposure on invasion status appears to drive intertidal macroalgal biomass (Wi= 0. 998). Identifying the conditions that promote or inhibit the cascading effects of introduced and/or recovering natural predators will allow managers to better anticipate where these indirect effects might occur and tailor their conservation and management actions...|$|R
