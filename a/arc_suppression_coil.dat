40|$|Abstract. In {{case of the}} <b>arc</b> <b>suppression</b> <b>coil</b> for {{neutral point}} {{grounding}} of small current grounding system, when single-phase grounding fault occurs, due to the <b>arc</b> <b>suppression</b> <b>coil</b> for fault line of the compensation effect of the zero sequence current, the fault features is not obvious, it can't implement the fault line selection and fault point location. This paper puts forward a method of change fault lines zero sequence current shortly, namely a resistance inductance (RL) series branch parallel in <b>arc</b> <b>suppression</b> <b>coil,</b> the series branch acts on the system shortly and changes <b>arc</b> <b>suppression</b> <b>coil</b> compensation degree temporarily in single-phase grounding fault.

40|$|The {{tightening}} of {{requirements for the}} distribution networks’ quality of supply obliges distribution system operators to make large investments in distribution networks. Medium voltage network cabling is one prominent method to improve the reliability of delivery. However, the cable characteristics {{are different from the}} characteristics of an overhead line. An underground cable produces significant amount of both reactive power and earth fault current. In order to keep the touch voltages in acceptable limits during an earth fault, in addition to centralized <b>coils</b> also distributed <b>arc</b> <b>suppression</b> <b>coils</b> are being increasingly used. Transferring reactive power causes losses and major cost are caused by the Fingrid’s fee for inputting reactive power in main grid. The reactive power is being compensated by shunt reactors. The objective of this thesis was to find the development needs to ABB MicroSCADA Pro DMS 600 software in the aspect of medium voltage network cabling. Representatives of 4 distribution system operators were interviewed and both measurements and simulations were performed to find the needs for improvements. Also the feasibility of active voltage level management feature Volt-VAr Control for Finnish customers was discussed. As an outcome of this thesis, several development needs were gathered. New devices such as shunt reactors and Dyn 11 +YN transformers need to be accurately modelled to enhance load flow calculation and to ease the network coding. The earth fault analysis method of present DMS 600 version includes multiple simplifications that may cause inaccuracies in networks containing long cable feeders and multiple <b>arc</b> <b>suppression</b> <b>coils.</b> More accurate earth fault calculation method was presented to improve the accuracy of the earth fault analysis method. Needs for features and notices to support the distribution system operators in the planning and operation of distribution network consisting of distributed compensation coils were presented. For example visualizing the compensation degree of feeders could help the planning and operation of feeders containing distributed <b>arc</b> <b>suppression</b> <b>coils.</b> Also the analysing of multiple network plans that are in the area of same HV-MV substation should be possible. That way the growth of reactive power and earth fault current could be taken into consideration during network planning.

40|$|Recent Storms in Nordic {{countries}} were a reason of long power outages in huge territories. After these disasters distribution networks' operators {{faced with a}} problem how to provide adequate quality of supply in such situation. The decision of utilization cable lines rather than overhead lines were made, which brings new features to distribution networks. The main idea of this work is a complex analysis of medium voltage distribution networks with long cable lines. High value of cable’s specific capacitance and length of lines determine such problems as: high values of earth fault currents, excessive amount of reactive power flow from distribution to transmission network, possibility of a high voltage level at {{the receiving end of}} cable feeders. However the core tasks was to estimate functional ability of the earth fault protection and the possibility to utilize simplified formulas for operating setting calculations in this network. In order to provide justify solution or evaluation of mentioned above problems corresponding calculations were made and in order to analyze behavior of relay protection principles PSCAD model of the examined network have been created. Evaluation of the voltage rise in the end of a cable line have educed absence of a dangerous increase in a voltage level, while excessive value of reactive power can be a reason of final penalty according to the Finish regulations. It was proved and calculated that for this networks compensation of earth fault currents should be implemented. In PSCAD models of the electrical grid with isolated neutral, central compensation and hybrid compensation were created. For the network with hybrid compensation methodology which allows to select number and rated power of distributed <b>arc</b> <b>suppression</b> <b>coils</b> have been offered. Based on the obtained results from experiments it was determined that in order to guarantee selective and reliable operation of the relay protection should be utilized hybrid compensation with connection of high-ohmic resistor. Directional and admittance based relay protection were tested under these conditions and advantageous of the novel protection were revealed. However, for electrical grids with extensive cabling necessity of a complex approach to the relay protection were explained and illustrated. Thus, in order to organize reliable earth fault protection is recommended to utilize both intermittent and conventional relay protection with operational settings calculated by the use of simplified formulas...|$|R

40|$|Arc {{suppression}} coils {{provide a}} low cost method of increasing both {{the reliability and}} safety of high voltage transmission and distribution systems. Although the concept is not new, the advent of modern control equipment allows fresh opportunities {{for them to be}} used to save lives and to decrease the cost and inconvenience to industry and the community in general that is caused by electricity supply interruptions without incurring large expenditure. Earth fault currents are reduced to almost zero, thus eliminating many short time power supply interruptions and preventing damage to the electricity supply system {{at the time of the}} initial fault. Because of the reduction in damage at the time of the fault, many longer duration interruptions are avoided. It is common for live high voltage conductors to be close to the ground and for the fault not to be detected by conventional power system protection equipment. <b>Arc</b> <b>suppression</b> <b>coil</b> systems can detect high impedance earth faults and broken conductors which cannot be detected by conventional protection systems. There are many system abnormalities which can cause neutral voltages in <b>arc</b> <b>suppression</b> <b>coil</b> systems. The appropriate action to be taken by the protection system depends on the type of system abnormality. The causes of neutral voltages in <b>arc</b> <b>suppression</b> <b>coil</b> systems are analysed and criteria are developed to differentiate between them based on the phase angle and magnitude of the neutral voltage. Fully computerised power system protection systems are now being implemented. These modern protection systems will be able to utilise the criteria developed in this research to take immediate appropriate action based on the neutral voltage caused by the system abnormality. In existing distribution systems there is a widespread use of two single phase pole mounted auto-transformers connected in open-delta configuration to provide economic in-line three phase voltage regulation. An original method of representing open delta regulators in symmetrical component analyses is developed. It is shown that when open-delta regulators are used in a power system equipped with an <b>arc</b> <b>suppression</b> <b>coil</b> very high voltages can occur. A solution is proposed whereby three single phase pole mounted auto-transformers connected in a closed-delta arrangement are used.

These transient over-voltages are analysed in detail and a method of testing the capability of existing system components to withstand the over-voltages is developed. Simple methods to estimate the transient voltages on overhead power systems are derived. A new method of minimising the transient over-voltages is proposed. ...|$|E

40|$|Summary	Distribution {{power systems}} {{experience}} {{a lot of}} faults due to high network utilisation and reduced investment in the infrastructure. Single phase faults are the most common. The standard distribution systems are radial operated. Failure of any one component in the series path would result into service disruption to all customers located downstream. Current methods used to localise faults are manual and lengthy. For permanent faults, {{it is a common}} practice to sectionalise a feeder to reduce the fault investigation area. The exact location of the fault is obtained by visual inspection. However, with the introduction of the new marketing policy resulting from deregulation and liberalisation of the power industry, utility companies are required to compensate consumers for non delivery of service. Distribution networks also records high growth rates due to new customer connections arising from increased demand for electric energy. An increase in consumption introduces transmission constraints on the distribution network, demanding for reinforcement on the main circuits. The penetration of distributed production facilities intends to curtail such investment costs and provide continuity of supply to the affected customers while the fault is being resolved. The objective of the thesis was to investigate the impacts caused by different power system configurations and parameters on automatic single phase fault localisation in power systems with distributed production using power frequency quantities. It was also required to reveal the present ground fault protection schemes and recommend requirements on a system with distributed generation. The approach used in the thesis included informal conversation, field research, literature review on similar topics, modelling and simulations using PSCAD/EMTDC software. A field research was conducted in Zambia on the pretext of understanding the problem from a practical perspective. The main focus was placed on power system configuration and layout, current methods used to localise faults and fault statistics. Secondary research on automated fault localisation methods for distribution systems based on fundamental power frequency quantities was done. Much of the literature available focuses on typical radial distribution feeders. In the thesis, two different methods were used in the simulation of distances to the fault location so that the findings could be consolidated. One of the methods is a standard approach used in numerical distance protection relays and the other, was derived, taking into account the presence of a distributed generator. The distribution system can be solidly grounded, ungrounded, grounded through an <b>arc</b> <b>suppression</b> <b>coil</b> or through a resistor. Each type of grounding configuration has its own impact on fault localisation. Different system grounding possibilities were used in the model when investigating the effect of parameter change, on fault localisation. Simulation results revealed that the distances to the fault locations are affected by all parameters selected for investigation. An increase in load with the same load angle was seen to have an impact of reducing the distance to the fault. An increase in the fault resistance had an effect of increasing the distance to the fault location. Moving the distributed generator away from the substation was seen to have had an effect of reducing the distance to the fault location. However, investigations were carried out without compensation for any of the parameters. This could have contributed to inaccuracies in the results obtained. While automatic localisation of ground faults is at the premium, it is required to minimise damages at the fault position and neighbouring equipment so that restoration of supply is prompt. This could be achieved with effective operation of the protection system. Integration of distributed production facilities can affect the dynamic behaviour of the distribution network and change the power flow. This affects operation of the conversional protection schemes deployed on the radial distribution systems. Therefore, protection schemes with a directional feature are recommended in order to improve selectivity. It can be deduced that precise ground fault localisation based on the use of power frequency quantities is a challenge due to many influencing parameters. However, automated fault localisation in power systems with distributed production is the future solution, especially from the operational perspective...|$|E
