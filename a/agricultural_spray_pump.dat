50|$|FMC Corporation is an American {{chemical}} {{manufacturing company}} headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The company {{was founded by}} chemist John Bean in 1883 as the Bean <b>Spray</b> <b>Pump</b> Company in Los Gatos, California, producing piston pumps for insecticides.

At this time the company {{changed its name to}} Food Machinery Corporation, and began using the initials FMC. In 1941 the company FMC received a contract to design and build amphibious tracked landing vehicles for the United States Department of War, and afterwards the company continued to diversify its products.

50|$|<b>Agricultural</b> <b>spray</b> {{adjuvants}} {{are used}} to enhance the effectiveness of pesticides such as herbicides, insecticides, fungicides and other agents that control or eliminate unwanted pests. As with medical adjuvants, <b>agricultural</b> <b>spray</b> adjuvants are not themselves active in controlling or killing pests. Instead, these additives modify some property of the spray solution, which improves {{the ability of the}} pesticide to penetrate, target or protect the target organism. Among the typical types of ingredients used are surfactants, emulsifiers, oils and salts. Each of these ingredients, and others, modifies the spray solution itself to improve such properties as spreading, penetration, droplet size or other characteristics.|$|R
50|$|<b>Agricultural</b> <b>spray</b> {{adjuvants}} do {{not reduce}} the amount of pesticide needed below the recommended use rate on a pesticide label. In fact, it is illegal to use a pesticide outside of the instructions on the label, although, FIFRA, the act governing pesticide use, does allow for the use of pesticides at rates below the label, as long as the label does not specifically deny such use. <b>Agricultural</b> <b>spray</b> adjuvants are used to enhance the performance of the legal amount of a pesticide that may be used. These adjuvants give more consistent performance and may make up for underperformance under certain conditions.|$|R

5000|$|Inside each tank {{there are}} {{typically}} three submerged pumps.

It can also be used for [...] "stripping" [...] out the last of the cargo in discharge operations. All of these pumps are contained within what is known as the pump tower which hangs from the top of the tank and runs the entire depth of the tank. The pump tower also contains the tank gauging system and the tank filling line, all of which are located near the bottom of the tank.|$|R
