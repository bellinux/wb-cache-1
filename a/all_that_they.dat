5|$|No {{body parts}} were {{recovered}} by the Soviet search {{team from the}} surface of the sea in their territorial waters, though they would later turn over clothes and shoes to a joint U.S.–Japanese delegation to Nevelsk on Sakhalin. On Monday, September 26, 1983, a delegation of seven Japanese and U.S. officials arriving aboard the Japanese patrol boat Tsugaru, had met a six-man Soviet delegation at the port of Nevelsk on Sakhalin Island. KGB Major General A. I. Romanenko, the Commander of the Sakhalin and Kuril Islands frontier guard, headed the Soviet delegation. Romanenko handed over to the U.S. and the Japanese, among other things, single and paired footwear. With footwear that the Japanese also retrieved, the total came to 213 men's, women's and children's dress shoes, sandals, and sports shoes. The Soviets indicated these items were <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had retrieved floating or on the shores of Sakhalin and Moneron islands.|$|E

It was the second time the two teams had drawn the series in the last three Ashes series, with 15 of the 20 Tests being drawn (the next series was also drawn 1–1).

25|$|In {{southern}} Saskatchewan {{there was}} one main group of plains Indians who were called Assiniboine. They moved around the area that is modern day Willow Bunch. This band {{is thought to have}} arrived 11,000 years ago, just after the last glacier retreated. Like most bands at the time, this group moved where their food went. They depended on the bison for almost everything. They used the bison to make clothing, build their shelter and to make tools. Since they moved around a lot they made a very smart way of transporting their tipis. The poles of the tipis would make a sled of sort that was called a travois and would be pulled by dogs. This carried <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> needed and transported their home at the same time.|$|E
25|$|According to {{cognitive}} linguist George Lakoff, liberal philosophy {{is based on}} five basic categories of morality. The first, the promotion of fairness, is generally described as an emphasis on empathy as a desirable trait. With this social contract based on the Golden Rule comes the rationale for many liberal positions. The second category is assistance to those who cannot assist themselves. A nurturing, philanthropic spirit {{is one that is}} considered good in liberal philosophy. This leads to the third category, the desire to protect those who cannot defend themselves. The fourth category is the importance of fulfilling one's life; allowing a person to experience <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> can. The fifth and final category is the importance of caring for oneself, since only thus can one act to help others.|$|E

Xander Bogaerts went deep in the fourth with one on, and two more runs scored in the fifth, {{with the help of}} a fielding error. Uehara pitched a scoreless ninth with a hit and two strike outs. David Price went eight innings of shutout ball in the final game of the first half of the season, striking out 10 and allowing only 4 hits and a walk. The offense provided him with three runs in the first and an additional run in the second and that's <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> needed. Brad Ziegler made his Red Sox debut with a perfect ninth inning, striking out two, to complete the sweep.|$|E

500|$|Before the Thraliana, Thrale kept {{two sets}} of anecdotes: the first was devoted to Samuel Johnson {{and the other for}} {{miscellaneous}} events. She relied on these, along with her memory, to write the early portions of her work. Boswell, when trying to find information for his own work, wrote: [...] "Mr. Thrale told me, I am not sure what day, that there is a Book of Johnsoniana kept int heir Family, in which all Mr. Johnson's sayings and <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> can collect about him is put down ... I must try to get this Thralian Miscellany, to assist me in writing Mr. Johnson's Life, if Mrs. Thrale does not intend to do it herself." [...] After Johnson's death, Thrale used the Thraliana to create the Anecdotes of the Late Samuel Johnson (1786). The manuscript passed through many hands and was owned by A. Edward Newton until his death in autumn 1940. The Thraliana was eventually published in 1942, and it was produced by the Clarendon Press in England while its editor, Katharine Balderston, was prohibited from travelling across the ocean from Wellesley College because of World War II.|$|E
500|$|... "Can't Hold Us Down" [...] lyrically {{discusses}} feminism; {{the song}} criticizes [...] "common" [...] gender-related double standards, {{in which men}} are applauded for their sexual behaviors, while women who behave {{in a similar fashion}} are disdained. In the book Therapeutic Uses of Rap and Hip-Hop, Susan Hadley and George Yancy discuss that [...] "Can't Hold Us Down" [...] is a hip hop song that [...] "encourages young women to be proud, strong, and empowered to be <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> can be". At the song's first verse, Aguilera sings [...] "Call me a bitch 'cause I speak what's on my mind / Guess it's easier for you to swallow if I sat and smiled"; she later rejects that all women [...] "should be seen, not heard" [...] and encourages them to [...] "shout louder" [...] during the chorus. Aguilera comments on the double standard with the lyrics [...] "The guy gets all the glory the more he can score / While the girl can do the same and yet you call her a whore". Lil' Kim shares a similar sentiment during her verse in the bridge, questioning why a man is able to give a woman [...] "some sex or sex her raw" [...] while [...] "if the girl do the same and then she's a whore".|$|E

Is it possible at <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> can actually get out of this?" [...] Eric Goldman of IGN rated the episode a [...] "masterful" [...] 10 out of 10, stating [...] "watching the season premiere of Battlestar Galactica is a great reminder that this is truly still the best show on television." [...] Ian Berriman of SFX reacted positively towards the episode, stating [...] "Although {{there are a couple}} of great surprises in this episode – Casey, the Great Escape-homaging finale – the highlights are a fistful of fabulous face-offs: Baltar discussing the bombing with Roslin; Roslin questioning Tigh's methods; Apollo telling Adama that his plan is madness. James Callis's performance as the haggard, tortured Baltar is outstanding." [...] Berriman rated the episode five stars out of five. Patrick Sauriol of UGO felt that although it was set a year since [...] "Lay Down Your Burdens", it [...] "hasn't lost a thing by jumping ahead," [...] and that the episode, along with [...] "Occupation", [...] "confirm that it's still the best show on television."

500|$|While {{writing the}} lyrics to Lightning Bolt, Vedder tried to be less cryptic in expressing his {{feelings}} compared to the [...] "word games" [...] of previous Pearl Jam albums. The songs discuss lasting relationships, bad faith ("Getaway," [...] "Mind Your Manners"), {{the state of the}} world ("Infallible") and life's transience ("Pendulum"), which Vedder summed up as [...] "the same mysteries that I’ve been trying to unravel for a few decades now." [...] Gossard explained that the reflective tone was indicative of the bandmembers' age: [...] " [...] 40-something, almost 50-something, you're looking at life through your kids' eyes, through the filter of relationships that are 20 or 30 years long, through the filter of your parents getting older and the passing of friends and relatives-relationships and <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> encompass, the difficulties of them and the sacrifices you make in them and also the joy they bring you." [...] Vedder at first was afraid of writing songs about mortality, but relented given he felt that [...] "death is everywhere" [...] and writing about death would help [...] "getting through it", as [...] "living to the day you die, and being cognizant of the end, you might lead a more appreciative life". One of the compositions about the theme was [...] "Future Days", which discusses the loss of Vedder's friend Dennis Flemion, who accidentally drowned in 2012. The concernment in the songs also owed to Vedder being a father, as the singer detailed that [...] "It’s going to be their world and what is their future? It feels like there is a lot that can be lost in the next 50 years if people don’t pay attention." ...|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weekly Chris Willman {{awarded the}} show an A- rating, and commended Knowles' ability {{to sing and}} dance simultaneously. Similarly, Shaheem Reid of MTV News commented, [...] "There are few (very few) ladies out there who can really sing, a lot who can dance, a lot more who look good — but really no other who can combine all three and add iconic star power like Miss Knowles, arguably the best {{all-around}} stage performer in the game right now." [...] J. Freedom du Lac of The Washington Post praised the concert's fast pace and called it a [...] "pure pop spectacle" [...] further describing it as [...] "brilliant... fiery". He noted that the opening, was with a [...] "dramatic, over-the-top entrance about which every aspiring diva dreams", but however he was disappointed in the show's ending. He further wrote, [...] "Though Beyoncé owned the spotlight, this being her 'Experience' and all, her band co-starred in the show, playing hard and tight behind the singer and vamping expertly for sustained periods whenever Beyoncé left the stage to change." [...] The Daily Mail John Aizleman {{was impressed with the}} high energy Knowles showed during the performance, and lauded the dance choreography, particularly that of [...] "Bills, Bills, Bills". However, Aizleman criticized the appearance of a dancer dressed as an angel at the end of [...] "Flaws and All" [...] as being awkward, and wrote that that moment was reminiscent of a [...] "misguided school nativity play". He further added, [...] "Big, brave and bold, the Beyoncé Experience is how pop music would work if it were choreographed by Busby Berkeley... If anyone had the temerity to doubt Beyoncé's star quality and her place in the diva pantheon, they would doubt no more after last night." [...] Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe wrote in her review that the tour title reminded her of a concert theme park rid and added [...] " [...] was an elaborate affair. It was part Vegas review, part hard-edged rock concert, part sweaty funk and soul revival, part diva concert hall performance, and almost all fun to watch as the singer threw herself into the various settings and costumes". Eamon Sweeney from the Irish Independent described Knowles' performance as [...] "the best pop show on the planet" [...] adding that the title of the tour [...] "does exactly what it says on the tin". David Schmeichel of Jam! wrote that the [...] "Splashy Beyonce 'experience' gives a lesson in diva-hood for pop princesses everywhere", further praising her [...] "goddess" [...] like entrance, vocals and performance which he desrcibed as [...] "tightly scripted as her film forays". Ashante Infantry of the Toronto Star noted that the concerts served as a testament to Knowles' talent and power and compared her with [...] Prince for the versatility and musicianship and Tina Turner for the sass and sheer power. Herald Sun Cameron Adams also compared Knowles' performing ability to that of Prince, and stated, [...] "Beyoncé is an old-fashioned, all- round entertainer." [...] Jim Harrington writing for San Jose Mercury News graded the tour as an A-plus affair. A writer of The StarPhoenix praised the show, writing that Knowles [...] "set the stage on fire" [...] for two hours. The writer also added that she had [...] "an honest, God-given talent she's not afraid to share. Her songs, ranging from sultry to soulful were performed with all her heart... With a clear passion for showmanship and a voice not easily matched, Beyonce simply bypassed the mediocrity of most concerts and took her performance to another level." [...] Arielle Castillo of Miami New Times heavily praised Knowles' performance, writing that [...] "B performed like her life depended on it; fresh to death choreography, flawless vocals, crazysexy wardrobe and her trademark lioness mane all in A+ form... Beyonce gave the crowd <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> expected, and multiplied that by 1000." [...] She concluded her review by writing that the concert was reminiscent of a Las Vegas show due to the elaborate costumes, sets, and [...] "over-the-topness of the whole thing" [...] further praising Knowles for acting, dancing and singing on stage.|$|E
