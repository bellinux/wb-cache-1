Parallel streams of data were sent between a client and a server PC and the effect on power consumption by the routers was recorded.

50|$|G.lite is a {{modulation}} profile {{which can}} be selected on a DSLAM port by an ADSL provider and provides greater resistance to noise and tolerates longer loop lengths (DSLAM to customer distances) for a given bandwidth.

The transmission speed of G.lite (G.992.2) is 1.5 Mbit/s downstream and 512 kbit/s upstream.|$|R

5000|$|With {{commonly}} deployed ADSL over POTS (Annex A), {{the band}} from 26.075 kHz to 137.825 kHz {{is used for}} upstream communication, while 138-1104 kHz is used for downstream communication. Under the usual DMT scheme, each of these is further divided into smaller frequency channels of 4.3125 kHz. These frequency channels are sometimes termed bins. During initial training to optimize transmission quality and speed, the <b>ADSL</b> <b>modem</b> tests each of the bins to determine the signal-to-noise ratio at each bin's frequency. Distance from the telephone exchange, cable characteristics, interference from AM radio stations, and local interference and electrical noise at the modem's location can adversely affect the signal-to-noise ratio at particular frequencies. Bins for frequencies exhibiting a reduced signal-to-noise ratio will be used at a lower throughput rate or not at all; this reduces the maximum link capacity but allows the modem to maintain an adequate connection. The DSL modem will make a plan on how to exploit each of the bins, sometimes termed [...] "bits per bin" [...] allocation. Those bins that have a good signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) will be chosen to transmit signals chosen from {{a greater number of}} possible encoded values (this range of possibilities equating to more bits of data sent) in each main clock cycle. The number of possibilities must not be so large that the receiver might incorrectly decode which one was intended in the presence of noise. Noisy bins may only be required to carry as few as two bits, a choice from only one of four possible patterns, or only one bit per bin in the case of ADSL2+, and very noisy bins are not used at all. If the pattern of noise versus frequencies heard in the bins changes, the DSL modem can alter the bits-per-bin allocations, in a process called [...] "bitswap", where bins that have become more noisy are only required to carry fewer bits and other channels will be chosen to be given a higher burden.|$|E
