Fans of the manga series responded negatively to its anime adaptation, criticizing the alterations made to the characterizations and stories. Japanese website New Akiba, hosted a petition intended to show fans' dissatisfaction <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> Madhouse and Nippon Television to be more faithful to the original work. In North America, it was also not well received, according to Viz Media's representative Amy Mar who said the show is of low priority since {{it has not been}} among the most-watched on VizAnime.|$|E
5|$|Adam Gopnik was {{selected}} to deliver the 2011 Massey Lectures, the annual week-long series of lectures on a political, cultural or philosophical topic given in Canada by a noted scholar. Gopnik was chosen by the panel of representatives from Massey College, House of Anansi Press and the CBC, the organizations responsible for coordinating the lectures. This would be the 50th anniversary of the Massey Lectures and coincide with the 75th anniversary of the CBC. Ideas executive producer Bernie Lucht contacted Gopnik by email to inform him of the panel's decision <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> if he would accept. At the time Gopnik was living in New York City, working as {{a staff writer for}} The New Yorker magazine. He had previously authored several books on different topics, the most successful being Paris to the Moon, a collection of essays published in 2000. Gopnik read Lucht's email while waiting for a bus on Madison Avenue. Gopnik later stated {{that by the end of}} the 20-minute bus ride he had already selected a topic and had a good idea of the issues he would address.|$|E

5|$|Sudirman {{first went}} to his {{official}} home and gathered sensitive documents, which he burned to prevent them falling into Dutch hands. His convoy, consisting of Sudirman, {{a small group of}} soldiers, and his personal doctor, then made their way south, towards Kretek, Parangtritis, Bantul. There they were received by the district head at 18:00. After several days in Kretek, during which time Sudirman sent undercover troops into the Dutch-occupied city for reconnaissance <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> his wife for jewellery to sell and help fund the guerrilla movement, he and his group travelled east along the south coast to Wonogiri. Before the Dutch attack it had already been decided that Sudirman would be able to better control the guerrillas from eastern Java, where there were still several bases. Meanwhile, Alfiah and the children were ordered to stay in the Kraton. Aware that he was being pursued by the Dutch, on 23 December Sudirman ordered his troops to continue to Ponorogo, where they stopped at the home of Mahfuz, a kyai and Islamic religious leader; Mahfuz gave the general a cane to help him walk, although Sudirman was, and continued to be, carried on a litter. They then continued east.|$|E

25|$|During {{a public}} meeting at Zion United Methodist Church in Marion on February 28 after Jackson's death, {{emotions}} were running high. James Bevel, {{as director of}} the Selma voting rights movement for SCLC, called for a march from Selma to Montgomery to talk to Governor George Wallace directly about Jackson's death, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> him if he had ordered the State Troopers to turn off the lights and attack the marchers. Bevel strategized that this would focus the anger and pain of the people of Marion and Selma toward a nonviolent goal, as many were so outraged they wanted to retaliate with violence.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of the battle of Canusium, the army of Marcellus was {{effectively}} put out of action. Sparing his soldiers, most of whom were wounded, the proconsul retired to Sinuesa (Campania) according to Plutarch, or Venusia (Apulia) according to Livy, where he was inactive the rest of the summer, allowing Hannibal to traverse southern Italy unchecked. This prompted Marcellus' political enemies in Rome to accuse him of bad generalship <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> the Senate and People to relieve him of his command. Nevertheless, Marcellus was elected consul once again and was authorized to seek a decisive engagement with Hannibal in the following year.|$|E
25|$|The DOJ {{response}} to Inslaw was {{to emphasize that}} the implementation contract called for a version of PROMIS in which the government had unlimited rights <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> for information about the enhancements Inslaw claimed as proprietary. Inslaw agreed to provide this information, but noted that {{it would be difficult to}} remove the enhancements from the time-sharing version of Promis and offered to provide the Vax version of Promis if the DOJ would agree to limit their distribution. In March 1983, the DOJ again informed Inslaw that the implementation contract required Inslaw to produce software in which the government had unlimited rights, and that delivery of software with restrictions would not satisfy the contract.|$|E

25|$|After their {{defeat in}} the battle of White Tunis the Carthaginians sent {{messengers}} to Hamilcar in Sicily. They asked him for assistance as soon as possible and delivered him the bronze beaks of the Greek ships. Hamilcar sent some of the messengers to Syracuse with the bronze beaks. They presented the beaks as evidence to convince the Syracusans that the army of Agathocles had been destroyed <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> for their surrender. Many inhabitants believed the story and mourned their lost relatives, but the magistrates were in doubt and turned away the Carthaginian messengers. Even so, some desperate citizens fled the city and were offered safety by Hamilcar. Hamilcar, thinking that the morale of the Syracusans was broken and that they lacked men to defend the city, prepared to assault the walls of Syracuse.|$|E
25|$|A {{large number}} of the {{evacuees}} were also directed to the nearby Concordia University, where the Concordia Student Union (CSU) is located. The CSU cancelled all remaining Orientation activities, and instead used its venues to temporarily shelter the evacuated Dawson students and provide them with food, water, blankets, and phones to reach other loved ones. A coordination team {{was put in place}} from the CSU and the DSU used the Sir George Williams campus as a temporary crisis centre and offered counselling (psychologist, psychiatrist) to traumatized students and staff. Claude Dauphin (Mayor of the borough of Lachine and Vice-President of the City of Montreal executive committee) had a very close relationship with both of the student unions during the night of the events; Dauphin went to the CSU office's the night of the shooting to meet with both unions to inform them of what the city was doing, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> how he could help.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} year of the Revolution, the Rolands moved to Lyon, where their {{influence}} grew and their political ambitions became clear. From the beginning of the Revolution, they affiliated with the liberal cause. The articles they contributed to the Courrier de Lyon came to the attention of the Parisian press; although Roland signed them, it was Madame Roland who wrote them. The city then sent Roland to Paris to inform the Constituent Assembly of the critical state of the silk industry <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> for relief of Lyon's debt. As a result, a correspondence began between Roland, Jacques Pierre Brissot and other supporters of the Revolution, whom he had met in Paris. The Rolands arrived in Paris during February 1791, and remained there until September. They frequented the Society of the Friends of the Constitution, entertaining deputies who later became leading Girondists, and taking an active part in the political landscape. Meanwhile, Madame Roland opened her first salon, helping her husband's name become better known in the capital.|$|E

25|$|Fifty-two Cardinals {{entered the}} {{conclave}} on May 12. On {{that same day}} in the evening {{they were joined by}} one more, Granvelle, Viceroy of Naples and official representative of Philip II of Spain. The first step taken by Granvelle was to inform Alessandro Farnese that the King of Spain would not accept his election <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> him to withdraw his candidature in order to maintain peace in Italy. Surprised, Farnese understood that with such strong opposition he would never obtain the required majority, but, admitting his defeat, he wished {{to be able to use}} his influence effectively in the choice of the new pontiff. Almost the whole next day leaders of the main factions: Farnese, Bonelli, Granvelle and Borromeo, spent looking for a compromise candidate, and finally agreed to elect the 70-year-old Ugo Boncompagni. The first scrutiny took place on May 13 at six o’clock in the evening. At the end of the phase of accessus Ugo Boncompagni was elected Pope, receiving all votes except of his own, which he gave to Granvelle. He accepted his election and took the name of Gregory XIII, in honour of Pope Gregory I.|$|E

For some people, harming themselves {{can be a}} means of drawing attention {{to the need for}} help <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> for assistance in an indirect way. It may also be an attempt to affect others and to manipulate them in some way emotionally. However, those with chronic, repetitive self-harm often do not want attention and hide their scars carefully.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to East Francia and Moravia, the first Bulgarian Empire {{was the third}} power {{deeply involved in the}} Carpathian Basin in the 9th century. A late 10th-century Byzantine lexicon known as Suda adds that Krum of Bulgaria attacked the Avars from the southeast around 803. [...] The Royal Frankish Annals narrates that the Abodrites inhabiting [...] "Dacia on the Danube" [...] (most probably along the lower courses of the river Tisza) sought the assistance of the Franks against the Bulgars in 824. Bulgarian troops also invaded Pannonia, [...] "expelled the Slavic chieftains and appointed Bulgar governors instead" [...] in 827. An inscription at Provadia refers to a Bulgarian military leader named Onegavonais drowning in the Tisza around the same time. The emerging power of Moravia brought about a rapprochement between Bulgaria and East Francia in the 860s. For instance, King Arnulf of East Francia sent an embassy to the Bulgarians in 892 in order [...] "to renew the former peace <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> that they should not sell salt to the Moravians". The latter request suggests that the route from the salt mines of the Eastern Carpathians to Moravia was controlled around that time by the Bulgarians.|$|E
