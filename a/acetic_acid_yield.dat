Four different hydrolysates obtained after steam pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass were selected and fermented to acetic acid in batch fermentations. The bacterial strain (ATCC 39073) can effectively ferment xylose and glucose in steam exploded hydrolysates from wheat straw, forest residues, switchgrass, and sugarcane straw to acetic acid. This homoacetogen prefers xylose over glucose.

40|$|According to statistics, {{the total}} amount of {{municipal}} solid waste in China has reached about 180 million tons in 2005, and is still increasing at the rate between 8 % to 10 %. Kitchen waste is expanding at even more staggering speed, which has put its utilization in significant place. In this paper, the technology of sub-critical water was applied to the disposal of the kitchen waste based on sub-critical water’s small density, viscosity and orgnic solvent features. The organic component of the kitchen waste mainly consists of cellulose, starch and highly fatty acid, which can be converted into small molecules(acetic acid, formic acid) employing wet oxidation technology. Initially, rice and fecula were used as model compound. In the absence of oxidation, the main yields were 5 -hydroxymethyl- 2 -furaldehyde, 2 -furaldehyde,lactic acid after the sub-critical water oxidation. When oxidation was applied, comparison was made between kitchen waste representatives (rice and cabbage) and real kitchen waste to study the rule of acid and <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>yield.</b> The results indicated that: reaction time, reaction temperature and the amount of the oxygen in the sub-critical water play important roles in wet oxidation. Within the range of 0 ~ 2. 5 min, acid acid yield, <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>yield</b> and carbon conversion increases with reaction time intially followed by a drop as reaction time further increases. This trend was also observed when the temperature was between 0 ~ 330 ℃ and amount of oxygen was between 0 ~ 150 % respectively. Optimal parameter was determined considering various factors: for rice, the optimal reaction time is 1 ~ 1. 5 min; oxygen amount, 70 %~ 100 %; temperature, 280 ℃; for cabbage, it’s 2 ~ 2. 5 min， 70 %~ 100 % and 280 ℃~ 300 ℃ respectively; For kitchen waste, it’s 1 ~ 2 min， 70 %~ 100 % and 300 ℃ respectively. Under these condition, carbon conversion rate for real kitchen waste is 30 %. It’s concluded from comparison that starch. yields less organic acid than starch and its carbon conversion rate is lower than that of cellulose. 据统计， 2005 年我国城市垃圾的排放总量已达到约 1. 8 亿吨，并且还在以每年 8 %- 10 %的速度增长，其中，厨余垃圾的增长速度较为突出，因此厨余垃圾资源化已成为重要的研究课题。 本论文实验主要利用亚临界水密度和粘度小、扩散速度较大、介电常数小、具备有机溶剂的特性、离子积较大、同时具备了酸和碱的催化剂特性等特点，实现将亚临界水技术应用于厨余垃圾的资源化的研究。在城市厨余垃圾的有机成分里，纤维类、淀粉类物质占了很大一部份，可以通过亚临界水氧化将这些大分子物质变成小分子的低级脂肪酸（醋酸、甲酸等）或其它有机产物，从而实现厨余垃圾的高效资源化处理。 首先，在不加氧化剂（H 2 O 2 ）的条件下，选取大米、生粉作为厨余垃圾中淀粉的代表物质，利用亚临界水处理后的主要产物为糠醛（ 2 -FA）、 5 -羟甲基糠醛（HMF）、乳酸（LA）等；在加氧化剂的条件下，选取作为厨余垃圾的代表物质和选取的厨余垃圾进行对比，研究了利用亚临界氧化反应后生成甲酸、乙酸的反应规律。最后实验结果表明，亚临界法处理工艺中，反应温度、反应时间、加氧量对厨余垃圾处理后甲酸、乙酸产量以及碳的转化率都有不同程度的影响。反应时间、反应温度、加氧量的范围分别确定在 0 ~ 2. 5 min、 0 ~ 330 ℃、 0 ~ 150 %，甲酸、乙酸产量以及碳转化率均随着反应温度、反应时间、加氧量的增加，总体趋势都是先增大后减小的。因此，综合考虑各种因素，在此范围确定的比较好的工艺条件：大米，反应时间为 1 ~ 1. 5 min，加氧量为 70 %~ 100 %，反应温度为 280 ℃；白菜，反应时间为 1 ~ 2 min，加氧量为 70 %~ 100 %，反应温度为 280 ℃~ 300 ℃；厨余，反应时间为 2 ~ 2. 5 min，加氧量为 70 %~ 100 %，反应温度为 300 ℃，在此工艺条件下碳的转化率可以达到 30 %。另外，通过结果比较，得出淀粉类物质生成的有机酸较纤维素类物质少...|$|E

The data show that the Pt/SnOx/C catalysts are composed of Pt and tin oxide Danoparticles with an average Pt particle diameter of about 2 nm. The steady-state activity of the Pt/SnOx/C catalysts towards the EOR decreases with tin content at room temperature, but increases at 80 degrees C. On all Pt/SnOx/C catalysts, acetic acid and acetaldehyde represent dominant products, CO 2 formation contributes 1 - 3 % for both potentiostatic and potentiodynamic reaction conditions. With in creasing potential, the acetaldehyde yield decreases and the <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>yield</b> increases. The apparent activation energies of the EOR increase with tin content (19 - 29 kJ mol(- 1)), but are lower than on Pt/C (32 kJ mol(- 1)). The somewhat better performance of the Pt/SnOx/C catalysts compared to alloyed PtSnx/C catalysts is attributed to the presence of both sufficiently large Pt ensembles for ethanol dehydrogenation and C-C bond splitting and of tin oxide for OH generation.

Propionic and butiric acid that was produced by cellulolytic rumen bacteria isolate of buffalo more higher than cattle (Animal Production 1 (1) : 1 - 9 (1999) Key Words: Cellulolytic, VFA, Rumen Bacteria, Buffalo, Cattle...|$|E
40|$|Lactobacillus buchneri 40788 and the fibrolytic enzymes &# 946;-glucanase and {{xylanase}} {{were applied}} to chopped sugarcane to study their effects on the nutritive value of silage. Sugarcane was mechanically harvested after 14 mo of growth and treated without (control) or with L. buchneri at a theoretical application rate of 5 × 10 (4) cfu/g, 1 × 10 (5) cfu/g, or 1 × 10 (5) cfu/g plus enzymes. Forage was packed into farm-scale bag silos (40 t/silo) and stored for 92 d. Fifty-six bulls (32 Nellore and 24 Charolais × Nellore) were housed in 20 collective pens and fed diets comprising (dry matter [DM] basis) 458 g/kg sugarcane silage and 542 g/kg concentrates for an 84 -d period. Treated silages had higher concentrations of acetic acid and lower concentrations of ethanol. Total mixed rations (TMR) containing inoculated silages exhibited significantly lower neutral detergent fiber (NDF) concentration and, consequently, higher in vitro DM digestibility (IVDMD). Thus, animals fed TMR containing treated silages spent less time chewing per day and per kilogram of DM intake (DMI), even at higher DMI levels. Nonetheless, the intake of NDF was similar across treatments (0. 77 to 0. 79 kg/ 100 kg BW) but markedly lower than the value reported for traditional forages. Average daily gain was significantly greater for animals fed TMR based on inoculated silages due to the higher DMI (14 % on average) and the higher energy content of the diets, {{as indicated by the}} higher feed efficiency (12 % on average). The dose of inoculants used and the addition of fibrolytic enzymes had no significant effects on silage parameters or animal performance. Therefore, inoculation of L. buchneri during sugarcane ensilage can alter the fermentation pattern by increasing <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>yield,</b> reducing silage nutrient losses, and improving feed efficiency by bulls...|$|E
40|$|In batch {{cultures}} of a respiratory deficient mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae the maximum specific growth {{rate and the}} yield coefficient decreased, but the specific glucose consumption rate increased, {{in the presence of}} <b>acetic</b> <b>acid.</b> The ATP <b>yield</b> decreased from approximately 14 to 4 g biomass (mol ATP) 31 when the concentration of <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> increased from 0 to 170 mM.

25|$|Both of {{the amino}} analogs are {{prepared}} from the condensation of 3-aminopiperidine-2,6-dione hydrochloride (Compound 3) which is synthesized in a two step reaction from commercially available Cbz-L-glutamine. The Cbz-L-glutamine is treated with CDI in refluxing THF to yield Cbz-aminoglutarimide. To remove the Cbz protecting group hydrogenolysis, under 50–60 psi of hydrogen with 10% Pd/C mixed with ethyl acetate and HCl, was performed. The formulated hydrochloride (Compound 3 in Scheme 3) was then reacted with 3-nitrophthalic anhydride in refluxing <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> to <b>yield</b> the 4-nitro substituted thalidomide analog and the nitro group then reduced with hydrogenation to give pomalidomide.|$|R

Treatment of the 4 -(2, 6 -difluoro- and dichlorobenzylideneamino) derivatives 6 o and 6 q with 1 -substituted piperazines, and formaldehyde solution in ethanol afforded good yields of the corresponding 5 -(1 -adamantyl) - 4 -(2, 6 -dihalobenzylideneamino- 2 -(4 -substituted- 1 -piperazinylmethyl) - 1, 2, 4 -triazoline- 3 -thiones 7 a–p. 5 -(1 -Adamantyl) - 4 -arylideneamino- 2 -(4 -ethoxycarbonyl- 1 -piperidylmethyl) - 1, 2, 4 -triazoline- 3 -thiones 8 a–n, were similarly prepared via the {{reaction of}} the corresponding arylideneamino derivative with ethyl 4 -piperidinecarboxylate and formaldehyde solution in ethanol. Compounds 6 a–v, 7 a–p and 8 a–n were tested for in vitro activities against a panel of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and the yeast-like pathogenic fungus Candida albicans. Several derivatives showed good or moderate activities, particularly against the tested Gram-positive bacteria. In addition, the in vivo anti-inflammatory activity of 21 compounds was determined using the carrageenan-induced paw oedema method in rats.
