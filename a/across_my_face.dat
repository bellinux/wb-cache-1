2500|$|Chase J. Nielsen, {{one of the}} U.S. airmen {{who flew}} in the Doolittle raid {{following}} the attack on Pearl Harbor, was subjected to waterboarding by his Japanese captors. At their trial for war crimes following the war, he testified [...] "Well, I was put on my back {{on the floor with}} my arms and legs stretched out, one guard holding each limb. The towel was wrapped around my face and put <b>across</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> and water poured on. They poured water on this towel until I was almost unconscious from strangulation, then they would let up until I'd get my breath, then they'd start over again... I felt more or less like I was drowning, just gasping between life and death." [...] In 2007, Senator John McCain claimed that the United States military hanged Japanese soldiers for waterboarding American prisoners of war during World War II. A minimal sentence for Japanese soldiers convicted of waterboarding American soldiers was 15 years.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, it will. I shall lay some boughs of bush <b>across</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> and the kegs, so {{that there}} will be no fear of my face showing; and if a sentry should happen to catch sight of it, he will suppose that it is merely a bush {{drifting}} in the stream." ...|$|E
6000|$|If it were true, as the {{excellent}} doctor had informed me, that seamen reported islands not far distant from these shores, chance might bear me blissfully {{to one of}} these. And if not true ... I turned a rather startled face to the water, and made haste not to think. Fortune pierces deep, and baits her hooks with sceptics. Away I went, bobbing mightily over the waves that leapt and wrestled where sea and river met. These safely navigated, I rowed the great creature straight forward <b>across</b> the sea, <b>my</b> <b>face</b> towards dwindling land, my prow to Scorpio.|$|R
6000|$|I felt <b>my</b> <b>face</b> grow {{hot with}} passion as I turned swiftly round towards Father Adrian. [...] "It is you who should go," [...] I cried. [...] "Why {{have you come}} here? Why are you always {{creeping}} <b>across</b> <b>my</b> life like a dark, noisome shadow? Go away! Begone! I will not be left with you!" ...|$|R

60|$|As {{the rains}} advanced, insects {{seemed to be}} called into {{existence}} in countless swarms; large and small moths, cockchafers, glow-worms, and cockroaches, made my tent a Noah's ark by night, when the candle was burning; together with winged ants, May-flies, flying earwigs, and many beetles, while a very large species of Tipula (daddy-long-legs) swept its long legs <b>across</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> as I wrote my journal, or plotted off my map. After retiring to rest and putting out the light, they gradually departed, except a few which {{could not find the}} way out, and remained to disturb my slumbers.|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, I see {{how little}} you have changed!" [...] he {{answered}} bitterly. [...] "You are {{of those that}} will not learn, Citizen. The fault lies here," [...] he added, tapping his head, [...] "and it will remain until we remove {{the ones with the}} other. But now for the business that brings me," [...] he proceeded, more briskly. [...] "Four years ago, Citizen Bellecour, you laid your whip <b>across</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> in the woods out yonder, and when I spoke of seeking satisfaction action you threatened me with your grooms. I will not speak of your other brutalities on that same day. I will confine myself to that first affront." ...|$|E
60|$|I dreamed in my sleep. I {{dreamed that}} a very {{beautiful}} woman who wore upon her naked breast the emblem of the moon fashioned in crystal, stood over me, looking down upon me with large dark eyes. And as she looked she sighed. Thrice she sighed, each time more deeply than the last. Then she knelt down by me--or so it seemed in my dream, and laid a tress of her long dark hair against my yellow locks, as though she would match them together. She did more, indeed--in my dream--for lifting that tress of fragrant hair, she let it fall like thistledown <b>across</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> and mouth, and then kissed the hair, for I felt her breath reach me through its strands.|$|E
60|$|As {{the terrible}} picture forced itself vividly <b>across</b> <b>my</b> imagination, I buried <b>my</b> <b>face</b> in <b>my</b> arms, and {{only with the}} {{greatest}} difficulty was it that I repressed the tears that welled to my eyes despite my every effort. To think of that beautiful creature torn and rended by the cruel fangs of the hideous white apes! It was unthinkable. Such a horrid fact could not be; and yet my reason told me that within thirty days my incomparable Princess would be fought over {{in the arena of}} the First Born by those very wild beasts; that her bleeding corpse would be dragged through the dirt and the dust, until at last a part of it would be rescued to be served as food upon the tables of the black nobles.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then {{you knew}} me at once?' he said, holding <b>my</b> <b>face</b> between his hands. 'That's bad, darling! I flattered myself I had {{transformed}} <b>my</b> <b>face</b> into the complete Indian.' ...|$|R
60|$|He glanced from <b>my</b> <b>face</b> to <b>my</b> jacket, {{and from}} my jacket to <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> and at length, with a pleased but {{somewhat}} puzzled expression, begged me to accompany him on a walk.|$|R
60|$|It {{was down}} again at once. As the light beat <b>across</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> my fore-wheels took the turf {{of a great}} still lawn from which sprang {{horsemen}} ten feet high with levelled lances, monstrous peacocks, and sleek round-headed maids of honour--blue, black, and glistening--all of clipped yew. Across the lawn--the marshalled woods besieged it on three sides--stood an ancient house of lichened and weather-worn stone, with mullioned windows and roofs of rose-red tile. It was flanked by semi-circular walls, also rose-red, that closed the lawn on the fourth side, and at their feet a box hedge grew man-high. There were doves on the roof about the slim brick chimneys, and I {{caught a glimpse of}} an octagonal dove-house behind the screening wall.|$|E
60|$|The syces, impassive as Orientals always are, {{had come}} up with the recaptured horses; and as Kitty sprang into her saddle I caught hold of the bridle, entreating her to hear me out and forgive. My answer was the cut of her riding-whip <b>across</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> from mouth to eye, and a word or two of {{farewell}} that even now I cannot write down. So I judged, and judged rightly, that Kitty knew all; and I staggered back {{to the side of the}} 'rickshaw. My face was cut and bleeding, and the blow of the riding-whip had raised a livid blue wheal on it. I had no self-respect. Just then, Heatherlegh, who must have been following Kitty and me at a distance, cantered up.|$|E
60|$|Hardly {{were the}} words {{out of my mouth}} before the deck gave a mighty leap, a hot wind that seemed half of flame blew <b>across</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> and the roar started the pain {{throbbing}} in my ears. At the same instant the screech of shot sounded overhead, we heard the sharp crack-crack of wood rending and splitting,--as with a great broadaxe,--and a medley of blocks and ropes rattled to the deck with the 'thud of the falling bodies. Then, instead of stillness, moans and shrieks from above and below, oaths and prayers in English and French and Portuguese, and in the heathen gibberish of the East. As the men were sponging and ramming home in the first fury of hatred, the carpenter jumped out under the battle-lanthorn at the main hatch, crying in a wild voice that the old eighteens had burst, killing half their crews and blowing up the gundeck above them. At this many of our men broke and ran for the hatches.|$|E
60|$|It {{struck me}} that the air might be better nearer the floor, and I proved it when I dropped {{on my hands and}} knees. I rolled Uchino out of his {{blankets}} with a quick jerk, wrapped the blankets about <b>my</b> head, <b>face,</b> and mouth, arose to my feet, and dashed for'ard into the hall. After a couple of collisions with the wood-work I again dropped to the floor and rearranged the blankets so that, while my mouth remained covered, I could draw or withdraw, a thickness <b>across</b> <b>my</b> eyes.|$|R

6000|$|... "And, {{with all}} this, {{there is nothing}} that I can {{complain}} of--nothing marked enough to justify me in noticing it. His disappointment shrinks from all open confession; his resignation collects itself by such fine degrees that even my watchfulness fails to see the growth of it. Fifty times a day I feel the longing in me to throw my arms round his neck, and say: 'For God's sake, do anything to me, rather than treat me like this!' and fifty times a day the words are forced back into my heart by the cruel considerateness of his conduct; which gives me no excuse for speaking them. I thought I had suffered the sharpest pain that I could feel when my first husband laid his whip <b>across</b> <b>my</b> <b>face.</b> I thought I knew the worst that despair could do on the day when I knew that the other villain, the meaner villain still, had cast me off. Live and learn. There is sharper pain than I felt under Waldron's whip; there is bitterer despair than the despair I knew when Manuel deserted me.|$|E
5000|$|A {{music video}} was {{released}} featuring the band playing at a chapel. During the video shoot, lead vocalist Maria Brink broke her nose. She tells MTV News, [...] "I literally got my head split open during the shoot. I {{have a big}} scar <b>across</b> <b>my</b> <b>face.</b> The camera dolly came a little close, and I was headbanging, and we just collided and my whole face split open. There was blood all over the place." [...] The band's management tried to call off the shoot but Brink insisted they finish the filming of the video.|$|E

5000|$|The German tank {{commander}} Otto Carius, who {{was credited}} with over 150 'kills' described an action in a 38(t) in 8 July 1941: It happened like greased lightning. A hit against our tank, a metallic crack, the scream of a comrade, {{and that was all}} there was! A large piece of armour plating had been penetrated next to the radio operator's seat. No one had to tell us to get out. Not until I had run my hand <b>across</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> while crawling in the ditch next to the road did I discover that they had also got me. Our radio operator had lost his left arm. We cursed the brittle and inelastic Czech steel that gave the Russian 47mm anti-tank gun so little trouble. The pieces of our own armour plating and assembly bolts caused considerably more damage than the shrapnel of the round itself.|$|E

60|$|At length when {{nearly all}} had fallen and I had {{nothing left to}} defend myself with except my revolver, I {{made up my mind}} {{that it was time to}} go. My first impulse was to ride for the river nine miles away. Looking behind me I saw that the rough road was full of Zulus hunting down those who tried to escape. Still I thought I would try it, when {{suddenly}} there flashed <b>across</b> <b>my</b> brain the saying of whoever it was that personated Mameena in the Valley of Bones, to the effect that in the great rout of the battle I was not to join the flying but to set <b>my</b> <b>face</b> towards Ulundi and that if I did so I should be protected and no harm would come to me.
