This study highlights how lack of a uniform representation and lack of a uniform scheme to generate communication structures and parallel code for regular and irregular <b>accesses</b> in a mixed regularirregular application prevent sophisticated optimizations. Furthermore, we also show that code generated for regular <b>accesses</b> using compile-time schemes are not always compatible to code generated for irregular <b>accesses</b> using run-time schemes.

However, current applications written in C, make extensive use of pointer arithmetic making compiler analysis and optimisation difficult. This paper presents a method for conversion of a restricted class of pointer-based memory <b>accesses</b> typically found in DSP codes into array <b>accesses</b> with explicit index functions. C programs with pointer <b>accesses</b> to array elements, data independent pointer arithmetic and structured loops can be converted into semantically equivalent representations with explicit array <b>accesses.</b> This technique {{has been applied to}} several DSPstone benchmarks on three different processors where initial results show that this technique can give on average a 11. 95 % reduction in execution time after transforming pointer-based array <b>accesses</b> into explicit array <b>accesses...</b>|$|R
