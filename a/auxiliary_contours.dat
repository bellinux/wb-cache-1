40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} novel {{technique}} that significantly improves {{the performance of}} oriented chamfer matching on images with cluttered background. Different to other matching methods, which only measures how well a template fits to an edge map, we evaluate the score of the template in comparison to <b>auxiliary</b> <b>contours,</b> which we call normalizers. We utilize AdaBoost to learn a Normalized Oriented Chamfer Distance (NOCD). Our experimental results demonstrate that it boosts the detection rate of the oriented chamfer distance. The simplicity and ease of training of NOCD on {{a small number of}} training samples promise that it can replace chamfer distance and oriented chamfer distance in any template matching application. ...|$|E

40|$|A general {{formulation}} by dual boundary integral equations and a computational solution algorithm for {{the general}} mixed-mode crack in a linearly elastic, isotropic medium is presented. Traction boundary integral equations are collocated at the points on one crack surface while displacement boundary integral equations are collocated at the opposite points on the other surface to ensure a unique solution. The hypersingular and strongly singular integrals in the traction and displacement boundary integral equations are regularized before the numerical implementation. The singular integration elements on both crack surfaces are replaced by smooth curved auxiliary surfaces to avoid the direct integration over the singular elements. Usage of these detoured <b>auxiliary</b> <b>contours</b> is justified by certain identities of the fundamental solutions. Convergence tests for integration order and subdivision of the auxiliary surface elements were performed. To demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the present technique, the deformation and the stress intensity factors for two- and three-dimensional embedded and edge crack problems are given...|$|E
