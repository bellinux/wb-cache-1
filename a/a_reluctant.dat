5|$|After {{meeting a}} gay soldier, Sam persuades <b>a</b> <b>reluctant</b> Kunal {{to pretend that}} they are lovers so they can rent the apartment. They regret their {{decision}} when they meet Neha, since they are attracted to her. The three become good friends, and Sam and Kunal {{fall in love with}} her.|$|E
5|$|Many logical flaws {{were found}} in COBOL 60, leading GE's Charles Katz to warn {{that it could not}} be {{interpreted}} unambiguously. <b>A</b> <b>reluctant</b> short-term committee enacted a total cleanup and, by March 1963, it was reported that COBOL's syntax was as definable as ALGOL's, although semantic ambiguities remained.|$|E
5|$|Although a professional—captains at {{the time}} were almost {{exclusively}} amateurs—the respect in which Hobbs was held meant that he was accepted as a captain. Many, but not all, critics considered him a competent tactician and leader. He regularly led the Players team against the Gentlemen and sometimes at Surrey in the absence of Percy Fender, but he was <b>a</b> <b>reluctant</b> captain. He disliked the responsibility and decision-making of leadership, and rarely even offered tactical advice.|$|E

5|$|Bradman saw Miller as a top-order batsman {{and as his}} new ball {{partner for}} Lindwall, {{although}} the Victorian allrounder was <b>a</b> <b>reluctant</b> bowler. The Australian captain felt that Miller was crucial to his strategy of attacking England's strong batting line-up—which boasted the likes of Hammond, Denis Compton, Len Hutton, Bill Edrich and Cyril Washbrook—with high pace. Miller was duly selected for the Australian team for the First Test.|$|E
5|$|Edward's {{relationship}} with Gaveston inspired Christopher Marlowe's 1592 play Edward II, {{along with other}} plays, films, novels and media. Many of these {{have focused on the}} possible sexual relationship between the two men. Edward's contemporaries criticised his performance as a king, noting his failures in Scotland and the oppressive regime of his later years, although 19th-century academics later argued that the growth of parliamentary institutions during his reign was a positive development for England over the longer term. Debate has continued into the 21st century as to whether Edward was a lazy and incompetent king, or simply <b>a</b> <b>reluctant</b> and ultimately unsuccessful ruler.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, Ash Ketchum {{gets his}} Pokémon journey {{off to a}} rough start when he {{receives}} his first Pokémon, <b>a</b> <b>reluctant</b> Pikachu. After many failed attempts at capturing some Pokémon, Ash throws a rock at a Spearow, which gets angry and starts attacking him and Pikachu. Soon, an entire flock of Spearow start chasing them, and Pikachu {{is the only one}} able to step in and stop the flock.|$|E

5|$|Later one night, cloaked by {{darkness}} and rain, Sullivan dispatches Rooney's entire entourage with his Thompson submachine gun and walks directly up to Rooney. As Rooney mutters {{that he is}} glad his killer is Sullivan, <b>a</b> <b>reluctant</b> Sullivan pulls the trigger. Seeing no further reason to protect Connor, Nitti reveals his location, after making Sullivan promise to end the feud. Sullivan goes to the hotel where Connor is hiding and kills him.|$|E
5|$|Later, Jon gathers {{the various}} Northern lords, the Knights of the Vale, and the Free Folk {{to plan for}} the fight against the White Walkers. Lady Lyanna Mormont, leader of Bear Island, shames the handful of Northern lords that did not come to Jon's aid. The Northern lords, Knights of the Vale, and Free Folk declare <b>a</b> <b>reluctant</b> Jon the new King in the North.|$|E
5|$|Walton himself, {{although}} <b>a</b> <b>reluctant</b> conductor, conducted {{many of the}} EMI recordings, {{and some}} for other labels. He made studio recordings of the First Symphony, the Viola Concerto, the Violin Concerto, the Sinfonia Concertante, the Façade Suites, the Partita, Belshazzar's Feast, and suites from his film scores for Shakespeare plays and The First of the Few. Some live performances conducted by Walton were recorded and have been released on compact disc, including the Cello Concerto and the Coronation Te Deum.|$|E

5|$|While Miller was <b>a</b> <b>reluctant</b> bowler, Bradman {{used him}} heavily {{because of his}} desire to have every {{possible}} spin option. Miller thus played as a middle-order batsman batting at No. 5 ahead of the wicket-keeper and the other bowlers, and an opening fast bowler, partnering Lindwall. For Victoria, Miller often batted higher at No. 3 or No. 4 and bowled less. For his state, Miller averaged more with the bat, which he felt {{was because he was}} able to concentrate more on his batting, as Hassett gave him a smaller workload with the ball.|$|E
5|$|Willow is a 1988 American high fantasy film {{directed}} by Ron Howard, produced {{and with a}} story by George Lucas, and starring Warwick Davis, Val Kilmer, Joanne Whalley, Jean Marsh, and Billy Barty. Davis plays the eponymous lead character and hero: <b>a</b> <b>reluctant</b> farmer who plays {{a critical role in}} protecting a special baby from a tyrannical queen who vows to destroy her and take over the world in a high fantasy setting.|$|E
5|$|Battleship {{doctrine}} emphasised {{the concentration}} of the battlegroup. In order for this concentrated force {{to be able to}} bring its power to bear on <b>a</b> <b>reluctant</b> opponent (or to avoid an encounter with a stronger enemy fleet), battlefleets needed some means of locating enemy ships beyond horizon range. This was provided by scouting forces; at various stages battlecruisers, cruisers, destroyers, airships, submarines and aircraft were all used. (With the development of radio, direction finding and traffic analysis would come into play, as well, so even shore stations, broadly speaking, joined the battlegroup.) So for most of their history, battleships operated surrounded by squadrons of destroyers and cruisers. The North Sea campaign of the First World War illustrates how, despite this support, the threat of mine and torpedo attack, and the failure to integrate or appreciate the capabilities of new techniques, seriously inhibited the operations of the Royal Navy Grand Fleet, the greatest battleship fleet of its time.|$|E

5|$|By mid-1842, {{popular opinion}} had {{turned against the}} Mormons. After an unknown assailant shot and wounded Missouri {{governor}} Lilburn Boggs in May 1842, anti-Mormons circulated rumors that Smith's bodyguard, Porter Rockwell, was the shooter. Though the evidence was circumstantial, Boggs ordered Smith's extradition. Certain he would be killed if he ever returned to Missouri, Smith went into hiding twice during the next five months, before the U.S. district attorney for Illinois argued that Smith's extradition to Missouri would be unconstitutional. (Rockwell was later tried and acquitted.) In June 1843, enemies of Smith convinced <b>a</b> <b>reluctant</b> Illinois Governor Thomas Ford to extradite Smith to Missouri on an old charge of treason. Two law officers arrested Smith, but were intercepted by a party of Mormons before they could reach Missouri. Smith was then released on a writ of habeas corpus from the Nauvoo municipal court. While this ended the Missourians' attempts at extradition, it caused significant political fallout in Illinois.|$|E
5|$|Dexter {{manages to}} keep the lab a secret from his clueless, cheerful Mom (voiced by Kath Soucie) and Dad (voiced by Jeff Bennett), who never take notice of it. However, he is {{frequently}} in conflict with his hyperactive older sister, Dee Dee (voiced by Allison Moore in seasons 1 and 3; Kat Cressida in seasons 2 and 4). In spite of Dexter's advanced technology, Dee Dee eludes all manner of security, and once inside her brother's laboratory, she delights in playing haphazardly, often wreaking havoc with his inventions. Though seemingly dim-witted, Dee Dee often outsmarts her brother and even gives him helpful advice. For his part, Dexter, though annoyed by his intrusive sibling, feels <b>a</b> <b>reluctant</b> affection for her and will come to her defense if she is imperiled.|$|E
5|$|Euskaltel-Euskadi has {{in their}} history been reticent to ride the Giro d'Italia, favoring the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España instead. After first {{indicating}} <b>a</b> <b>reluctant</b> willingness to participate as per the requirements of holding a ProTeam license, the team later stated that they intended to seek overall victory in the race with Antón. Antón was named {{as the leader of}} the squad, which included Nieve, Oroz, Isasi, Aramendía, Azanza, Cazaux, Sesma and Minguez to ride in support. Antón tempered the expectations somewhat, saying that a stage win would be nice, as would General Classification success should it come, but that he was only banking on riding for the overall at the Vuelta a España.|$|E

5|$|Homer {{stops by}} the Kwik-E-Mart {{on the way}} home from work, and {{witnesses}} a robbery committed by a masked clown, resembling Krusty. He identifies the clown as Krusty to the police, and Krusty is arrested, upsetting Bart, who considers him to be his idol. During his trial the next day, Krusty is revealed to be illiterate. After being called out to the stand, Homer points out Krusty as the robber, and he is convicted and sentenced to jail. The community then gathers up in a public burning as they burn up all of Krusty's merchandise. Krusty's sidekick Sideshow Bob becomes the new host of his show, making it a more educational program. Still refusing to accept that his hero could have committed the crime, Bart enlists the help of <b>a</b> <b>reluctant</b> Lisa and they set out to prove Krusty's innocence.|$|E
5|$|It was alleged by medieval chroniclers that Edward II and Piers Gaveston were lovers, a rumour {{that was}} {{reinforced}} by later portrayals in fiction, such as Christopher Marlowe's late 16th-century play Edward II. This assertion has received the support of some modern historians, while others have questioned it. According to Pierre Chaplais, {{the relationship between the}} two was that of an adoptive brotherhood, and Gaveston served as an unofficial deputy for <b>a</b> <b>reluctant</b> king. Other historians, like J. S. Hamilton, have pointed out that concern over the two men's sexuality was not at the core of the nobility's grievances, which rather centred on Gaveston's exclusive access to royal patronage.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1678, Danby was impeached by the House of Commons on {{the charge}} of high treason. Although {{much of the nation}} had sought war with Catholic France, Charles had {{secretly}} negotiated with Louis XIV, trying to reach an agreement under which England would remain neutral in return for money. Danby had publicly professed that he was hostile to France, but had reservedly agreed to abide by Charles's wishes. Unfortunately for him, the House of Commons failed to view him as <b>a</b> <b>reluctant</b> participant in the scandal, instead believing that he was the author of the policy. To save Danby from the impeachment trial, Charles dissolved the Cavalier Parliament in January 1679.|$|E

6000|$|I said I {{could not}} deny {{that this was a}} strong point. I said it (people often do so, in such cases) like <b>a</b> rather <b>reluctant</b> {{concession}} to truth and justice;--as if I wanted to deny it! ...|$|R
