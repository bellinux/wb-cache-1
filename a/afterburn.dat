5|$|<b>Afterburn</b> is a steel {{inverted}} {{roller coaster}} located at Carowinds amusement park. After {{more than two}} years of planning and construction, the roller coaster opened on March 20, 1999. The ride previously operated as Top Gun: The Jet Coaster, before it was renamed <b>Afterburn</b> following Cedar Fair's purchase of the park in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Top Gun: The Jet Coaster soft {{opened to}} guests and media on March 16, 1999. Riders {{of the first}} cycle {{included}} NASCAR drivers Stanton Barrett, Tony Stewart, Jerry Nadeau, and Kenny Wallace. The ride officially {{opened to the public}} on March 20, 1999. On July 1, 2006, the Cedar Fair Entertainment Company announced their acquisition of all of the Paramount Parks, including Carowinds. The aforementioned Top Gun roller coasters at other parks were all renamed to Flight Deck by the 2008 season, with Carowinds' installation being renamed to <b>Afterburn.</b> For the 2014 season, the ride's 15th season, <b>Afterburn</b> received a new coat of paint.|$|E
5|$|<b>Afterburn</b> has {{appeared}} in Amusement Todays annual Golden Ticket Awards several times. It debuted at position 18 in 1999, before disappearing from the poll for the three years to follow. The ride returned to the poll, before hitting a low of 45 in 2012.|$|E
40|$|Parametric {{studies were}} made with a {{multilayer}} atmospheric diffusion model to place quantitative limits on the uncertainty of predicting ground-level toxic rocket-fuel concentrations. Exhaust distributions in the ground cloud, cloud stabilized geometry, atmospheric coefficients, the effects of exhaust plume afterburning of carbon monoxide CO, assumed surface mixing-layer division in the model, and model sensitivity to different meteorological regimes were studied. Large-scale differences in ground-level predictions are quantitatively described. Cloud alongwind growth for several meteorological conditions is shown to be in error because of incorrect application of previous diffusion theory. In addition, rocket-plume calculations indicate {{that almost all of}} the rocket-motor carbon monoxide is <b>afterburned</b> to carbon dioxide CO 2, thus reducing toxic hazards due to CO. The afterburning is also shown to {{have a significant effect on}} cloud stabilization height and on ground-level concentrations of exhaust products...|$|R
5|$|As <b>Afterburn</b> {{exits the}} batwing, it climbs through a {{camelback}} hill over the station before entering its final inversion, a corkscrew to the right.

5|$|In Mitch Hawker's {{worldwide}} Best Roller Coaster Poll, <b>Afterburn</b> entered {{at position}} 12 in 1999, before slowly declining {{to a low}} of 41 in 2012. The ride's ranking in subsequent polls is shown in the table below.|$|E
5|$|After hosting NXT, Striker began {{interviewing}} WWE {{employees on}} Raw and SmackDown. During {{the summer of}} 2012, Striker became the host of WWE <b>Afterburn</b> for international broadcasts. On the October 12 SmackDown, Striker tried to interview Team Hell No (Kane and Daniel Bryan), but they both attacked him. On the October 15 episode of Raw, Striker demanded that he receive an apology and was instead forced to face Kane in his final WWE match, which Striker lost. On June 20, 2013, Striker departed WWE after the company opted to not renew his contract.|$|E
5|$|On 15 November 1982, {{while on}} a {{training}} flight outside Kunsan Air Base in South Korea, USAF Captain Ted Harduvel died when he crashed inverted into a mountain ridge. In 1985, Harduvel's widow {{filed a lawsuit against}} General Dynamics claiming an electrical malfunction, not pilot error, as the cause; a jury awarded the plaintiff $3.4 million in damages. However, in 1989, the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled the contractor had immunity to lawsuits, overturning the previous judgment. The court did remand the plaintiff's claim of electrical malfunction as the cause, noting that General Dynamics and the USAF knew about chafing of instrumentation wiring, which they had not initially disclosed. The accident and subsequent trial was the subject of the 1992 film <b>Afterburn.</b>|$|E

2500|$|<b>Afterburn</b> is a 1992 {{dramatic}} film {{written and}} produced for television, {{based on a}} true story where one woman takes on the United States military and General Dynamics, manufacturer of the F-16 jet fighter aircraft that took her husband's life. The docudrama starred Laura Dern, Robert Loggia, and Vincent Spano. The film's name is derived from the [...] "Afterburner" [...] bar where the central character (Janet Harduvel), who works as a waitress, met her future husband, a setting that forms the focus of the first part of the film.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Afterburn</b> {{received}} {{a number of}} nominations in various categories including Molly Lopata nominated for the [...] "Artios" [...] Best Casting for TV Movie of the Week for the 1992 Casting Society of America Award, Isidore Mankofsky for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Cinematography for a 1992 Emmy in the Miniseries or a Special category and Jerrold L.

2500|$|Originally {{aired in}} the United States by HBO on May 30, 1992, <b>Afterburn</b> was re-broadcast in October {{that year and}} {{released}} shortly after as a home video in both VHS and DVD formats. Although not garnering {{a great deal of}} attention from critics, most reviews were favorable, centering on the drama in the story. Ken Tucker [...] considered the film, dedicated to the memory of Ted Harduvel was successful because of [...] "complex performances of Spano and, especially, Dernâ€”they give 'Afterburn' the emotional weight its real-life subjects deserve." [...] Sandra Brennan called it [...] "... riveting, fact-based made-for-cable drama." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{technical}} {{issues that are}} dealt with in <b>Afterburn</b> is that the F-16 [...] "Viper" [...] is entirely reliant on its electrical systems to relay flight commands as well as digital instrument reading, instead of traditional [...] "steam-driven" [...] instruments and mechanically-linked controls, leading to the early moniker of [...] "the electric jet". In Capt. Harduvel's final mission, he relied on his faulty instrument reading that showed him close to terrain, but did not indicate that he was upside down and his [...] "pull out" [...] actually propelled him at full power, inverted, into a hillside. General Dynamics was aware of a potential problem of wiring becoming chafed by the high-G forces inherent in the F-16's flight envelope, and had a maintenance advisory issued.|$|E
2500|$|Yousef was {{assisted}} by Iraqi bomb maker Abdul Rahman Yasin, who helped assemble the complex [...] bomb, {{which was made}} of a urea nitrate main charge with aluminum, magnesium and ferric oxide particles surrounding the explosive. The charge used nitroglycerine, ammonium nitrate dynamite, smokeless powder and fuse as booster explosives. Three tanks of bottled hydrogen were also placed in a circular configuration around the main charge, to enhance the fireball and <b>afterburn</b> of the solid metal particles. The use of compressed gas cylinders {{in this type of}} attack closely resembles the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing 10 years earlier. Both of these attacks used compressed gas cylinders to create fuel-air and thermobaric bombs that release more energy than conventional high explosives. According to testimony in the bomb trial, only once before the 1993 attack had the FBI recorded a bomb that used urea nitrate.|$|E
2500|$|Pressure cooker {{bombs were}} placed on trains on the western line of the {{suburban}} ("local") train network, which forms {{the backbone of the}} city's transport network. Pressure cookers were used in this bombing and other recent explosions to increase the <b>afterburn</b> in a thermobaric reaction, more powerful than conventional high explosives. The first blast reportedly took place at 18:24 IST (12:54 UTC), and the explosions continued for approximately eleven minutes, until 18:35, during the after-work rush hour. All the bombs had been placed in the first-class [...] "general" [...] compartments (some compartments are reserved for women, called [...] "ladies" [...] compartments) of several trains running from Churchgate, the city-centre end of the western railway line, to the western suburbs of the city. They exploded at or in the near vicinity of the suburban railway stations of Matunga Road, Mahim, Bandra, Khar Road, Jogeshwari, Bhayandar and Borivali. Home Minister Shivraj Patil told reporters that authorities had [...] "some" [...] information an attack was coming, [...] "but place and time was not known".|$|E
