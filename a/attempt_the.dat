5|$|A {{procedure}} {{for dealing with}} omitted decompression stops is described in the US Navy Diving Manual. In principle the procedure allows a diver who is not yet presenting symptoms of decompression sickness, to go back down and complete the omitted decompression, with some extra added {{to deal with the}} bubbles which are assumed to have formed during the period where the decompression ceiling was violated. Divers who become symptomatic before they can be returned to depth are treated for decompression sickness, and do not <b>attempt</b> <b>the</b> omitted decompression procedure as the risk is considered unacceptable under normal operational circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Even {{with these}} efforts, {{fundraising}} lagged. Grover Cleveland, {{the governor of}} New York, vetoed a bill to provide $50,000 for the statue project in 1884. An <b>attempt</b> <b>the</b> next year to have Congress provide $100,000, sufficient to complete the project, also failed. The New York committee, with only $3,000 in the bank, suspended work on the pedestal. With the project in jeopardy, groups from other American cities, including Boston and Philadelphia, offered to pay {{the full cost of}} erecting the statue in return for relocating it.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of French ally Hyder Ali in December 1782, British commanders at Madras decided to <b>attempt</b> <b>the</b> {{recapture}} of Cuddalore. The army marched south from Madras, circling around the city and then encamping south of it. The British fleet, eighteen ships-of-the-line including Gibraltar, under Admiral Sir Edward Hughes, anchored to the south to protect the army and its supply ships. By early June 1783 the Siege of Cuddalore was under way.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{elimination}} of the United States ice hockey team, American television stations needed to fill airtime and chose to focus on the Jamaican bobsleigh team in the four-man event. The first run ended poorly, as when Dudley Stokes jumped into the bobsleigh, the push-bar in the sleigh broke, resulting in the team coming in third from last in 24th place. On their second <b>attempt,</b> <b>the</b> team ranked second to last, due in part to White struggling to crouch down properly in his seat, remaining almost upright through the first corner.|$|E
5|$|In 1827, William Edward Parry led a British Royal Navy {{expedition}} {{with the}} aim {{to be the first}} men to reach the North Pole. In the 50 years following Parry's <b>attempt,</b> <b>the</b> Americans would mount three such expeditions: Elisha Kent Kane in 1853–55, Isaac Israel Hayes in 1860–61, and Charles Francis Hall with the Polaris in 1871–73.|$|E

5|$|Mountain {{climbing}} on Mount Rainier is difficult, involving traversing the largest glaciers in the U.S. south of Alaska. Most climbers require {{two to three}} days to reach the summit, with a success rate of approximately 50%. Climbing teams require experience in glacier travel, self-rescue, and wilderness travel. About 8,000 to 13,000people <b>attempt</b> <b>the</b> climb each year, about 90% via routes from Camp Muir on the southeast flank.|$|E
5|$|On 22 December Hinkler, {{accompanied}} by John F. Leeming, {{president of the}} Lancashire Aero Club, made another <b>attempt.</b> <b>The</b> landing was no problem. On the steep slope and with a strong headwind the plane stopped quickly. Professor E. R. Dodds witnessed the landing. The uphill take-off was more difficult and the plane dived {{off the edge of}} the summit with insufficient airspeed, but picked up speed as it dived, narrowly missing Striding Edge, to return to Manchester.|$|E

5|$|Robben's first {{participation}} at {{an international}} tournament came at UEFA Euro 2004 when manager Dick Advocaat called up younger players, such as Wesley Sneijder and John Heitinga. During the group stage of the tournament, Advocaat substituted Robben in the 66th minute to defend a 2–1 lead over the Czech Republic. The Czechs, however, then scored two goals and won 3–2, which led to criticism about Advocaat's decision. In the quarter-finals, Robben scored the deciding kick in the penalty shootout between the Netherlands and Sweden, which ensured that at the fifth <b>attempt,</b> <b>the</b> Dutch finally won a shootout.|$|E
5|$|Rovers found {{a better}} playing surface for the 1886–87 season, {{at the rear}} of the Lord Nelson pub and it became known as the Lord Nelson Ground. In November 1886, the East End Football Association was formed, along with the Senior Cup Competition. Millwall made it to the final against London Caledonians, which was played at Leyton Cricket Ground. The match {{finished}} 2–2 and the teams shared the cup for six months each. Millwall won the East London Senior Cup at the first <b>attempt.</b> <b>The</b> club also won it the following two years, and the trophy became their property.|$|E
5|$|The New Zealand Division {{continued}} to advance, with the 2nd Brigade capturing Haplincourt on 3 September following a failed <b>attempt</b> <b>the</b> previous day. It moved onto the outer defences of the Hindenburg Line, including Trescault Spur, which overlooked the German positions. In conjunction with 37th Division and {{elements of the}} 38th Division, the New Zealanders attacked the spur on 12 September. The crest of the spur was captured, although not the trench system on the far side. During this action, Sergeant Harry Laurent earned the VC for his exploits in leading a patrol that captured a company of Germans.|$|E

5|$|The actor John Payne {{attempted}} {{to take up}} the option on the film rights to the book in 1955, but nothing came of the <b>attempt.</b> <b>The</b> Rank Organisation also came to an agreement to make a film, but this likewise fell through. The novel was not one of Fleming's stories acquired by Eon Productions in 1961; in 1969 the company acquired the rights and commissioned Gerry Anderson to produce and co-write a screenplay. Anderson and Tony Barwick prepared a 70-page treatment that was never filmed, but some elements were similar to the final screenplay of The Spy Who Loved Me.|$|E
5|$|The club, Thames Ironworks {{were the}} first ever winners of the West Ham Charity Cup in 1895 contested by clubs in the West Ham locality, then won the London League in 1897. They turned {{professional}} in 1898 upon entering the Southern League Second Division, and were promoted to the First Division at the first <b>attempt.</b> <b>The</b> following year they came second from bottom, but had established themselves as a fully fledged competitive team. They comfortably fended off the challenge of local rivals Fulham in a relegation play-off, 5–1 in late April 1900 and retained their First Division status.|$|E
5|$|The {{involvement}} of Dante and Petrarch {{in establishing the}} sestina form, together with the contributions {{of others in the}} country, account for its classification as an Italian verse form—despite not originating there. The result was that the sestina was re-imported into France from Italy in the 16th century. Pontus de Tyard was the first poet to <b>attempt</b> <b>the</b> form in French, and the only one to do so prior to the 19th century; he introduced a partial rhyme scheme in his sestina.|$|E

5|$|To {{finance the}} scheme, Otto, Augustus and Charles Morse met with Charles T. Barney, {{president}} of the city's third-largest trust, the Knickerbocker Trust Company. Barney had provided financing for previous Morse schemes. Morse, however, cautioned Otto that he needed much more money than he had to <b>attempt</b> <b>the</b> squeeze and Barney declined to provide funding. Otto decided to <b>attempt</b> <b>the</b> corner anyway. On Monday, October 14, he began aggressively purchasing shares of United Copper, which rose in one day from $39 to $52 per share. On Tuesday (Oct. 15), he issued the call for short sellers to return the borrowed stock. The share price rose to nearly $60, but the short sellers {{were able to find}} plenty of United Copper shares from sources other than the Heinzes. Otto had misread the market, and the share price of United Copper began to collapse.|$|E
5|$|A {{precocious}} student, Durkheim {{entered the}} École Normale Supérieure (ENS) in 1879, at his third <b>attempt.</b> <b>The</b> entering class that year {{was one of}} the most brilliant of the nineteenth century and many of his classmates, such as Jean Jaurès and Henri Bergson, would go on to become major figures in France's intellectual history. At the ENS, Durkheim studied under the direction of Numa Denis Fustel de Coulanges, a classicist with a social scientific outlook, and wrote his Latin dissertation on Montesquieu. At the same time, he read Auguste Comte and Herbert Spencer. Thus Durkheim became interested in a scientific approach to society very early on in his career. This meant the first of many conflicts with the French academic system, which had no social science curriculum at the time. Durkheim found humanistic studies uninteresting, turning his attention from psychology and philosophy to ethics and eventually, sociology. He obtained his agrégation in philosophy in 1882, though finishing next to last in his graduating class owing to serious illness the year before.|$|E
