5|$|McCarthyism {{declined}} in late 1954 after television journalist Edward R. Murrow and others publicly chastised McCarthy. The controversies over the Bill of Rights that were {{generated by the}} Cold War ushered {{in a new era}} in <b>American</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>liberties.</b> In 1954 in Brown v. Board of Education, the Supreme Court unanimously overturned state-sanctioned school segregation, and thereafter a flood of civil rights victories dominated the legal landscape.|$|E
50|$|On the Court, Davis {{became famous}} for writing {{one of the}} most {{profound}} decisions in the Supreme Court history, Ex Parte Milligan (1866). In that decision, the court set aside the death sentence imposed during the Civil War by a military commission upon a civilian, Lambdin P. Milligan. Milligan had been found guilty of inciting insurrection. The Supreme Court held that since the civil courts were operative, the trial of a civilian by a military tribunal was unconstitutional. The opinion denounced arbitrary military power, effectively becoming one of the bulwarks of held notions of <b>American</b> <b>civil</b> <b>liberty.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The basic obverse {{design of}} the Seated Liberty coinage {{consisted}} of the figure of Liberty clad in a flowing dress and seated upon a rock. In her left hand, she holds a Liberty pole surmounted by a Phyrgian cap, which had been a pre-eminent symbol of freedom during the movement of Neoclassicism (and in fact traces its roots back to Ancient Greece and Rome). Although it {{had fallen out of}} favor in Europe by 1830, Neoclassicism remained in vogue in the United States until after the <b>American</b> <b>Civil</b> War. <b>Liberty's</b> right hand rested on the top corner of a striped shield with a diagonal banner inscribed with the word [...] "Liberty". The shield represented preparedness in the defense of freedom. The date of the coin appeared on the bottom below Liberty.|$|R

5|$|Legally, the ACLU {{consists}} of two separate but closely affiliated nonprofit organizations: the <b>American</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Liberties</b> Union, a 501(c)(4) social welfare group, and the ACLU Foundation, a 501(c)(3) public charity. Both organizations engage in civil rights litigation, advocacy, and education, but only donations to the 501(c)(3) foundation are tax deductible, and only the 501(c)(4) group can engage in unlimited political lobbying. The two organizations share office space and employees.|$|E

5|$|While at {{one time}} a long-time {{supporter}} of the <b>American</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Liberties</b> Union, Hentoff became a vocal critic of the organization in 1999 for its advocacy of government-enforced university and workplace speech codes. He {{served on the board}} of advisors for the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, another civil liberties group. Hentoff's book Free Speech for Me—But Not for Thee outlines his views on free speech and excoriates those whom he feels favor censorship in any form.|$|E

50|$|Tom Drake is {{a former}} senior {{executive}} with the National Security Agency (NSA) who blew the whistle on multi-billion dollar programmatic fraud, waste, and abuse; the critical loss and suppression of 9/11 intelligence; and the Stellar Wind project's dragnet electronic mass surveillance and data-mining (conducted on a vast scale by the agency {{with the approval of}} the White House after 9/11). Drake argued that Stellar Wind violated the Constitution and <b>American</b> citizens' <b>civil</b> <b>liberties</b> while weakening national security. In April 2010, the Department of Justice charged him with 10 felonies (five under the Espionage Act) and he faced 35 years in prison. He was the first whistleblower charged with espionage by the Obama administration. All charges were eventually dropped when Drake pleaded to a misdemeanor count of exceeding the authorized use of a government computer with no fine or prison time. He is the 2011 recipient of the Ridenhour Truth-Telling Prize, and with Jesselyn Radack the co-recipient of the 2011 Sam Adams Associates for Integrity in Intelligence Award, and the 2012 Hugh M. Hefner First Amendment Award.|$|R

5|$|In March 2016, the New York Civil Liberties Union (NYCLU), the New York City {{office of}} the <b>American</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Liberties</b> Union, {{wrote a letter to}} Mayor de Blasio {{outlining}} their privacy concerns. In the letter, representatives for the NYCLU wrote that CityBridge could be retaining too much information about LinkNYC users. They also stated that the privacy policy was vague and needed to be clarified. They recommended that the privacy policy be rewritten so that it expressly mentions whether the Links' environmental sensors or cameras are being used by any NYPD or city systems.|$|E
5|$|The ACLU {{continues}} to defend individuals who feel abused or improperly {{treated by the}} government. Often the <b>American</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Liberties</b> Union is the group {{to stand up for}} an individual when being discriminated against because of their religion, sex, gender, sexuality, race, or class, even when they are not the popular opinion. The Reproductive Freedom Project, however, goes deeper than the ACLU. The Project promotes sexual and reproductive health by providing lessons about contraception, knowing about one's reproductive rights and assisting with the financial burdens of abortions and all of the logistics that may go into that.|$|E
5|$|The Free Expression Policy Project {{was founded}} by Marjorie Heins, who became its initial director. It was formed as a nonprofit {{organization}}.

It started as {{an outgrowth of the}} National Coalition Against Censorship. Prior to founding the organization, Heins served as director of the Art Censorship Project at the <b>American</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Liberties</b> Union. The FEPP monitors incidents of censorship against artists, and is based in Manhattan, New York.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} cases were tried before the Supreme Court of the United States {{during the period of}} the <b>American</b> <b>Civil</b> War.

5000|$|James Cameron (February 25, 1914 [...] - [...] June 11, 2006) was an <b>American</b> <b>civil</b> rights activist. In the 1940s, {{he founded}} three {{chapters}} of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). He also served as Indiana's State Director of the Office of <b>Civil</b> <b>Liberties</b> from 1942 to 1950.|$|R
5000|$|On May 29, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), an <b>American</b> Islamic <b>civil</b> <b>liberties</b> group, held a {{news conference}} in Orlando at which it {{presented}} photographs of Todashev's body which it said showed that he was shot seven times, once in the head. CAIR asked the Department of Justice (DOJ) for an investigation separate from the FBI investigation into the shooting to determine whether the FBI violated Todashev's civil rights. A DOJ spokesman said that they would determine whether an investigation by the Civil Rights Division is warranted. The FBI immediately responded by releasing a statement saying: [...] "The FBI takes very seriously any shooting incidents involving our agents, and as such, we have an effective, time-tested process for addressing them internally. The review process is thorough and objective and conducted as expeditiously as possible under the circumstances." [...] In early August, the DOJ finished a preliminary probe into Todashev's death. Executive director of CAIR-Florida Hassan Shibly said: [...] "It was the FBI agent who shot all of the bullets. If this were a survival shooting, typically all of the officers will draw their weapons," [...] adding that [...] "sympathetic" [...] federal sources within the DOJ and FBI assured CAIR that Todashev was unarmed.|$|R
