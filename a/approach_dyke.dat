50|$|Gyngell {{pursued the}} same lightweight, populist <b>approach</b> that <b>Dyke</b> had forged to {{establish}} the station's viability, a model parodied later in a Guardian newspaper headline as 'Snap, Crackle and Pap'. The station overhauled its children's Saturday morning programme with Wide Awake Club, replacing Data Run and SPLAT {{as part of the}} cost-cutting by management.|$|R
50|$|After three injury plagued {{years at}} Parramatta, <b>Dykes</b> <b>approached</b> the club asking {{them for a}} {{termination}} on his final year with the club, citing wanting to return home to the Sharks.|$|R
60|$|Guided by {{the light}} of the fireships they <b>approached</b> the <b>dyke,</b> and the Zeelanders sprang ashore and climbed up. They were met by several hundred Spanish troops, who, as soon as they saw the fireships burn out harmlessly, sallied out from their forts. The Zeelanders were {{beginning}} to give way when the Antwerp fleet came up on the other side, headed by Sainte Aldegonde. The new arrivals sprang from their boats and climbed the dyke. The Spaniards were driven off, and three thousand men occupied all the space between Fort George and the Palisade Fort.|$|R

Hutton described <b>Dyke's</b> <b>approach</b> to checking news stories as [...] "defective"; when Alastair Campbell complained about the story, Dyke had immediately defended it without investigating whether there was any merit to the complaint.|$|R
60|$|Upon the 26th of {{the same}} month the grand attack, from which the people of Antwerp hoped so much, took place. Two hundred vessels were ready. A portion of these were to come up from Zeeland, under Hohenlohe; the rest to advance from Antwerp, under Sainte Aldegonde. At {{two o'clock in the}} morning the Spanish {{sentinels}} saw four fireships <b>approaching</b> the <b>dyke.</b> They mustered reluctantly, fearing a repetition of the previous explosion, and retired to the fort. When the fireships reached the stakes protecting the dyke, they burned and exploded, but without effecting much damage. But in the meantime a swarm of vessels of various sizes were seen approaching. It was the fleet of Hohenlohe, which had been sailing and rowing from ten o'clock on the previous night.|$|R
50|$|Filling the gap {{of supply}} and demand of fish and {{vegetables}} for improving household nutrition, the ANEP (Agriculture and Nutrition Extension Project) funded by the European Union (EU) works in Barisal District of Bangladesh following an integrated aquaculture-agriculture <b>approach.</b> Pond <b>dykes</b> in Barisal are commonly used for planting trees by the rural people which provide cooking fuel, fruits, and timber for sale. Trees on the pond dyke create shadow, which reduce sunlight penetration to the edges of the pond and the dykes. In this context, IFCAS was developed in the shaded ponds without changing the vegetative nature of pond dykes following the collegial principles of action research. In the whole process of action research, farmers, researchers and developers from Bangladesh Agricultural University (BAU), Mymensingh, Patuakhali Science and Technology University, Bangladesh, WorldFish-ANEP, and Bangladesh Fisheries Research Forum (BFRF) together were involved in the trial of this technology. The concept of IFCAS was developed by Dr. M. Mahfujul Haque (Ripon), Professor, Department of Aquaculture, BAU, Mymensingh who led the action research as the Principal Investigator.|$|R
40|$|The chapter explores {{approaches}} to learning that we argue best reflect a constantly changing, dynamic environment {{as reflected in}} current thinking (Giddens, 2000; Beck, 1992; Castells, 1996). We acknowledge {{that there are many}} different schools of thought in terms of learning theories, but we would like to focus here on those we believe are most relevant and applicable to e-learning. This will include a discussion of the following: a critique of behaviourist approaches and their impact, advocacy of the application of experiential/reflective, social constructivism and socio-cultural approaches, and the argument that effective e-learning usually requires, or involves, high quality educational discourse (Ravesncroft, 2004) combined with an experiential and reflective <b>approach</b> (Conole & <b>Dyke,</b> 2004; Mayes & de Freitas, 2004) ...|$|R
50|$|After The Way Wast, Hecht {{continued}} {{working on}} a great many film projects and never retired from his profession. The next film he worked on was The Comic, his second of the two-picture contract at Columbia Pictures. Adapted from the original story Baggy Pants by Walter Newman, The Comic was first adapted by the author in late 1965. The story dealt with a silent screen star, his rise to fame and his downfall. In the summer of 1967 Hecht <b>approached</b> Dick Van <b>Dyke</b> to star in the film and Carl Reiner to direct and co-produce it. With them on board The Comic became {{a joint venture between}} Harold Hecht Productions, Van Dyke's DFI Productions and Reiner's Acre Enterprises. Later that summer Hecht screen-tested May 1967 Playboy Playmate of the Month model, Anne Randall, for the female lead. Reiner, Van Dyke and screenwriter Aaron Ruben re-wrote the screenplay considerably over the next year and by the summer of 1968, Hecht was out of the picture. The film was eventually released in late 1969, strictly as a Reiner production, and it is currently unknown if any of Hecht's contributions remained in {{the final version of the}} film.|$|R
40|$|The spatial {{distribution}} of eruptive vents around volcanoes can be complex and evolve as a volcano grows. Observations of vent distribution at contrasting volcanoes, from scoria cones to large shields, show that peripheral eruptive vents concentrate close to the volcano base. We use analogue experiments to explore the control of volcano load on magma ascent and on vent location. Results show that the local loading stress field favors eruption of rising magma away from the volcano summit if a central conduit is not established or is blocked. Two sets of scaled experiments are developed with contrasting rheological properties to analyze similarities and differences in simulated magma rise below a volcano: (1) Golden syrup (magma analogue) is injected into a sand-plaster mixed layer (crust analogue) under a cone; (2) water or air (magma analogues) is injected into gelatin under a sand cone. Rising <b>dykes</b> <b>approaching</b> the cone stress field are stopped by the load compressive stress. With continued intrusion, dyke overpressure builds up; dykes extend laterally until their tips are able to rise vertically again and to erupt in the flank or {{at the base of}} the volcano. Lateral offset of the extrusion point relative to the edifice summit depends on substratum thickness, volcano slope, and dyke overpressure. The 3 D geometry of Golden syrup intrusions varies with experimental parameters from cylindrical conduits to dyke and sill complexes. Experimental results are compared with illustrative field cases and with previously published numerical models. This comparison enables applications and limitations of the analogue models to be highlighted and allows us to propose a conceptual model for the evolution of vent distribution with volcano growth...|$|R
30|$|Most {{parts of}} the sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are {{vulnerable}} to flooding with East, South and Central regions having the most prevalent flood disaster, followed by West Africa (Ngoran et al. 2015). Burkina Faso, Chad, Ethiopia, Ghana, Senegal, Sudan, Togo, Kenya, Liberia, Mali, Niger, Rwanda, Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria and Uganda are the worst hit by floods in SSA, affecting farmlands, settlements and other ecosystem services. The worst single flood incidents in SSA happened in East Africa: one incident in 1997 slew 2, 311 people in Somalia; and another in 1999 affected 1.8 million people in Sudan. Sub-Saharan Africaâ€™s disaster profile is {{closely linked to the}} vulnerability of its population and economy and their often-low capacities to cope with natural hazards. For example, in Madagascar, Post Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) indicates some losses were avoidable and often caused by weak housing and construction standards. Following a disaster, poor populations often have no other option than to carry out sub-standard reconstruction and resettlement in high-risk areas. Most responses address only one type of hazard or economic sector such as urban floods in Senegal, or droughts in Ethiopia. This is approach is comparable to disaster response in Kano Plains where a number of projects only address one type of hazard: floods. In this area, the limited intervention for disaster risk reduction has consisted mainly of conventional methods such as structural techniques and the provision of relief (Nyakundi et al. 2010). This study and Nyakundi et al. (2010) indicate a growing belief and dependency on technical <b>approach</b> such as <b>dykes</b> seemingly to be the only method to control the floods. Awareness of other measures for flood mitigation such as public education is still very low.|$|R
