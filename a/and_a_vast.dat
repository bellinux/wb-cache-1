5|$|Music in {{religious}} rituals, especially Roman Catholic, {{manifests itself in}} a number of ways. Parish bands, for example, are quite common throughout Italy. They may be as small as four or five members to as many as 20 or 30. They commonly perform at religious festivals specific to a particular town, usually in honor of the town's patron saint. The historic orchestral/choral masterpieces performed in church by professionals are well-known; these include such works as the Stabat Mater by Giovanni Battista Pergolesi and Verdi's Requiem. The Second Vatican Council from 1962 to 1965 revolutionized music in the Roman Catholic Church, leading to {{an increase in the number}} of amateur choirs that perform regularly for services; the Council also encouraged the congregational singing of hymns, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>vast</b> repertoire of new hymns has been composed in the last 40 years.|$|E
5|$|Tethys is {{the third}} largest of Saturn's inner moons. Its most {{prominent}} features are a large (400km diameter) impact crater named Odysseus on its leading hemisphere <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>vast</b> canyon system named Ithaca Chasma extending at least 270° around Tethys. The Ithaca Chasma is concentric with Odysseus, and these two features may be related. Tethys appears to have no current geological activity. A heavily cratered hilly terrain occupies {{the majority of its}} surface, while a smaller and smoother plains region lies on the hemisphere opposite to that of Odysseus. The plains contain fewer craters and are apparently younger. A sharp boundary separates them from the cratered terrain. There is also a system of extensional troughs radiating away from Odysseus. The density of Tethys (0.985g/cm3) is less than that of water, indicating that it is made mainly of water ice with {{only a small fraction of}} rock.|$|E
