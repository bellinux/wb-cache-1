5|$|Some isopod {{groups have}} evolved a {{parasitic}} lifestyle, particularly as external parasites of fish. They can damage or kill their hosts {{and can cause}} significant economic loss to commercial fisheries. In reef aquariums, parasitic isopods can become a pest, endangering the fish and possibly injuring the aquarium keeper. Some {{members of the family}} Cirolanidae suck the blood of fish, and others, in the family Aegidae, consume the blood, fins, tail <b>and</b> <b>flesh</b> and can kill the fish in the process.|$|E
5|$|Strobilomyces strobilaceus {{is roughly}} similar in {{appearance}} {{because of its}} rough scaly cap and lacerated margin, but may be distinguished from B.ananas by smooth stem without a ring, different spores, <b>and</b> <b>flesh</b> that is less tough. The Australian species Boletellus ananiceps has spores with narrow longitudinal ribs {{that do not have}} cross-striae. B.dissiliens has colors that are not red as in B.ananas, and pores that can become reddish in maturity. Further, the cap flesh of B.dissiliens turns blue upon exposure to air.|$|E
5|$|The Costa Rican bolete Leccinum neotropicalis is {{a closely}} allied species. It is {{distinguished}} from L.rugosiceps by its dark brown to dark reddish-brown color, <b>and</b> <b>flesh</b> {{that does not}} stain with injury. L.viscosum, found in Belize, features a similar cap and scaber pigmentation on the stipe, and similar color changes in response to injury in {{the flesh of the}} cap and the apex of the stipe; unlike L.rugosiceps, however, it also stains at the stipe base, and the cap is sticky rather than dry.|$|E

5|$|F-Zero GX is {{the first}} F-Zero game to feature a Story mode. Its story has the player {{assume the role of}} F-Zero pilot Captain Falcon in nine {{chapters}} of various racing scenarios; such as Falcon's training regiment, a race against a rival through a canyon with falling boulders, attack and eliminate a rival's gang, and escape from a collapsing building through closing blast doors. Each chapter can be completed on a normal, hard, and very hard difficulty setting. Toshihiro Nagoshi, one of the game's co-producers, stated that this mode was included because the development team felt that the F-Zero universe was unique and they wanted to explain some of the characters' motivations <b>and</b> <b>flesh</b> out the game world.|$|E
5|$|Young {{specimens}} of Tylopilus rubrobrunneus have a purplish cap, but unlike T.plumbeoviolaceous, their stems are never purple. The species Tylopilus microsporus, known only from China, {{is characterized by}} pale violet to violet cap, paler purple to purplish brown stem, <b>and</b> <b>flesh</b> color to pale purplish red pores. In addition to its different distribution, it can be distinguished from T.plumbeoviolaceus by its smaller spores. Another similar Asian species, T.obscureviolaceus, is only known from the Yaeyama Islands in southwestern Japan. It differs from T.plumbeoviolaceous in having a cap that does not fade in color to grayish or brownish when mature, shorter spores (6–7.2 by 3.3–4µm), and other microscopic characteristics.|$|E
5|$|Alongside {{traditional}} piercing techniques, modern body adornment includes variant {{techniques such}} as pocketing <b>and</b> <b>flesh</b> stapling, although as of 2007 these were still not widely made available by piercers. In the first of these, a scalpel opens the skin or mucous membranes, into which the larger end {{of a piece of}} jewellery or—if using a bar—two ends are inserted. These kinds of piercings may be difficult to remove, as fibrous tissue can form around the end or ends of the jewellery or the implanted tube into which the jewellery is placed. When a bar is used, pocketing looks quite similar to flesh stapling. The latter technique is frequently done {{in the form of a}} ladder. Modern body piercing practices also include dermal anchoring or dermal piercing, which combines piercing and implantation to create a single point of opening in the body (whereas pocketing creates two) to permit one end of the jewellery to show above the surface of the skin. While this technique can be performed almost anywhere on the body, as of 2007 it was popularly done between the eyes, on the chest, or on the finger, to simulate a ring.|$|E

5|$|Boletellus ananas, {{commonly}} known as the pineapple bolete, is a mushroom in the family Boletaceae, and the type species of the genus Boletellus. It is distributed in southeastern North America, northeastern South America, Asia, and New Zealand, where it grows scattered or in groups on the ground, often at the base of oak and pine trees. The fruit body is characterized by the reddish-pink (or pinkish-tan to yellowish if an older specimen) scales on the cap that are often found hanging from the edge. The pore surface {{on the underside of the}} cap is made of irregular or angular pores up to 2mm wide that bruise a blue color. It is yellow when young but ages to a deep olive-brown color. Microscopically, B.ananas is distinguished by large spores with cross striae on the ridges and spirally encrusted hyphae in the marginal appendiculae <b>and</b> <b>flesh</b> of the stem. Previously known as Boletus ananas and Boletus coccinea (among other synonyms), the species was given its current name by William Alphonso Murrill in 1909. Two varieties of Boletellus ananas have been described. Although the mushroom may be considered edible, it is not recommended for consumption.|$|E
5|$|Russula emetica {{is one of}} over 100 red-capped Russula species known worldwide. The related {{beechwood}} sickener (R.nobilis) {{is found}} under beech in Europe. Many, such as the bloody brittlegill (R.sanguinaria), are inedible; this species can be distinguished from R.emetica by the reddish flush in its stem. R.aurea, however, is edible. It has a yellow stem, gills <b>and</b> <b>flesh</b> under its red cap. The edible R.rugulosa—common in mixed woods in the eastern and northern United States—has a wrinkled and pimpled cap cuticle, cream spores, and mild taste. Another inedible species, R.fragilis, has notched gills, and its stem stains blue with naphthol. The uncommon European subspecies R.emetica longipes is distinguished by its longer stem and ochre gills. The paler European mushroom R.betularum, found in coniferous forests and moorland, is sometimes considered a subspecies of R.emetica. R.nana is restricted in distribution to arctic and subarctic highland meadows where dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) or alpine bearberry (Arctostaphylos alpina) are abundant.|$|E
5|$|There {{are a few}} greenish Stropharia {{with which}} S.caerulea might be confused. Stropharia pseudocyanea is an {{uncommon}} species that grows in meadows. It has a more slender form than S.caerulea, a soft, spongy stipe, <b>and</b> <b>flesh</b> with an odour similar to fresh pepper. Microscopically, it has a dense palisade of slender, capitate (with a spherical tip) non-staining cheilocystidia on the gill edge. This gives the gills of young, fresh fruit bodies a whitish edge, a feature that is absent from S.caerulea. Another lookalike, S.aeruginosa, is less common than S.caerulea. It is distinguished from the latter by the well-developed ring zone on its stipe, darker gills with white edges, and more numerous whitish scales around the cap margin. Additionally, S.aeruginosa has more stable colours than S.caerulea, the colouration of which tends to quickly wash out. However, collections of Stropharia often show characteristics that are intermediate between two or more species, making them difficult to identify accurately.|$|E

5|$|Between 1692 and 1806, {{only four}} {{descriptions}} of frozen mammoths {{were published in}} Europe. None of the remains of those five were preserved, and no complete skeleton was recovered during that time. While frozen woolly mammoth carcasses had been excavated by Europeans as early as 1728, the first fully documented specimen was discovered near the delta of the Lena River in 1799 by Ossip Schumachov, a Siberian hunter. Schumachov let it thaw until he could retrieve the tusks for sale to the ivory trade. While in Yakutsk in 1806, Michael Friedrich Adams heard about the frozen mammoth. Upon arrival at the location, Adams discovered that wild animals had eaten most of the organs <b>and</b> <b>flesh</b> of the mammoth, including the trunk. He examined the carcass and realised what was left would still be the most complete mammoth recovered by that time. Adams recovered the entire skeleton, apart from the tusks, which Shumachov had already sold, and one foreleg, most of the skin, and nearly 18kg (40lb) of hair. During his return voyage he purchased a pair of tusks that he believed {{were the ones that}} Shumachov had sold. Adams brought it to the Zoological Museum of the Zoological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and the task of mounting the skeleton was given to Wilhelm Gottlieb Tilesius. The Kunstkamera, the museum established by Peter the Great, contained the skeleton of an Indian elephant that could be used as reference. This {{was one of the first}} attempts at reconstructing the skeleton of an extinct animal. Most of the reconstruction is correct, but Tilesius placed each tusk in the opposite socket, so that they curved outward instead of inward. The error was not corrected until 1899, and the correct placement of mammoth tusks was still a matter of debate into the twentieth century.|$|E
