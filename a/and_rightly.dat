During a morning inspection, Hunt observed activity in the Confederate lines <b>and</b> <b>rightly</b> concluded an assault was being readied. Later, with the Union line on Cemetery Ridge under massive bombardment from Longstreet's corps artillery chief, Col. Edward Porter Alexander, Hunt was able to resist command pressure from fiery II Corps commander Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock who had demanded Union fire to lift {{the spirits of the}} infantrymen pinned down under Alexander's bombardment. Hunt ordered that counter-battery fire cease to conserve ammunition, reserving sufficient amounts for anti-personnel fire in the attack he knew was coming. Hunt also directed his cannons to cease fire slowly to create the illusion that they were being destroyed one by one, which fooled the Confederates into thinking his batteries were destroyed and triggered their disastrous charge. His concealed placement of Lt. Col. Freeman McGilvery's batteries north of Little Round Top caused massive casualties in the infantry assault. Hunt was rewarded for his service with the brevet of colonel in the Regular Army. Hunt reported in detail on the artillery's role at Gettysburg.|$|E

On [...] 1799, French soldiers under the command of Colonel d'Hautpoul were strengthening the defences of Fort Julien, a couple of miles north-east of the Egyptian port city of Rosetta (modern-day Rashid).

He and d'Hautpoul saw at once that it might be important and informed General Jacques-François Menou, who happened to be at Rosetta.

Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic commented, [...] "Overall, the album adds up to less {{than the sum of}} its parts—partially because the singles are so good, but also because on the first album, she stunned with style and a certain joy. Here, the calculation is apparent, and while that's part of Madonna's essence—even something that makes her fun—it throws the record's balance off a little too much for it to be consistent, even if it justifiably made her a star." [...] Debby Miller from Rolling Stone preferred Madonna's debut album over Like a Virgin. In The Village Voice, Robert Christgau was also lukewarm towards the record, writing [...] " [...] so sure of herself she's asking men and women both to get the hots for the calculating bitch who sells the fantasy even while she bids for the sincerity market where long-term superstars ply their trade.

Avi Shlaim considers this the declaration's [...] "greatest contradiction". This principle of self-determination had been declared on numerous occasions subsequent to the declarationPresident Wilson's January 1918 Fourteen Points, McMahon's Declaration to the Seven in June 1918, the November 1918 Anglo-French Declaration, and the June 1919 Covenant of the League of Nations that had established the mandate system.

The results of the ongoing American King–Crane Commission of Enquiry consultation of the local population – from which the British had withdrawn – were suppressed for three years until the report was leaked in 1922. Subsequent British governments have acknowledged this deficiency, in particular the 1939 committee led by the Lord Chancellor, Frederic Maugham, which concluded that the government had not been [...] "free to dispose of Palestine without regard for the wishes and interests of the inhabitants of Palestine", and the April 2017 statement by British Foreign Office minister of state Baroness Anelay that the government acknowledged that [...] "the Declaration should have called for the protection of political rights of the non-Jewish communities in Palestine, particularly their right to self-determination." ...|$|E

500|$|Electric shock {{treatment}} had become fashionable among the public, but often was not favoured by physicians {{except as a}} last resort.

[...] Bird, however, continued to stand by the treatment when properly administered. [...] He convinced an initially sceptical Addison of its merits, and the first publication (in 1837) describing the work of the electrifying unit was authored by Addison, not Bird, although Bird is clearly, <b>and</b> <b>rightly,</b> credited by Addison. [...] Having the paper authored by Addison did a great deal to gain acceptability in a still suspicious medical fraternity. [...] Addison held great authority, whereas Bird at this stage was unknown. [...] Bird's 1841 paper in Guy's Hospital Reports contained an impressively long list of successful case studies. [...] In 1847 he brought the subject fully into the realm of materia medica when he delivered the annual lecture to the Royal College of Physicians on this subject. [...] He spoke out tirelessly against the numerous quack practitioners, in one case exposing railway telegraph operators who were claiming to be medical electricians, although they had no medical training at all. [...] In this way, Bird was largely responsible for the rehabilitation of electrical treatment among medical practitioners.

The Manchester Guardian noted that Pullin wrote {{at a time when}} many famous cricketers played. It stated that, of these times, he [...] "wrote with a keenness of judgement, a descriptive style, and a fund of anecdote that made the games live again". E.W. Swanton described him as [...] "a thick, bearded fellow" [...] and [...] "a faithful old war-horse". The Yorkshire Post said that Pullin [...] "stood for all the best in sporting critics of the older school... He was proud, <b>and</b> <b>rightly</b> proud, of the high position which he held in sporting journalism and in the administrative circles of the games on which he wrote". The newspaper judged that he wrote about cricket and rugby players [...] "with a clarity akin to genius... There can scarcely be a football or cricket ground in England where he was not known and welcomed, and his striking appearance and still more striking personality became traditional in the Press box which he graced. To the players of the games he was generous in praise and kindly in his criticism." [...] Gerald Pawle was told when he became a journalist in 1931 that Pullin originally sent reports to his newspaper by pigeon. Pawle writes: [...] "For the vast Yorkshire cricketing public Old Ebor wrote at inordinate length, unhampered by any consideration of literary style—he was one of the severely factual school—and it amazed me how any pigeon ever struggled into the air when shackled to one of his weighty effusions." ...|$|E

Cagan and directed by Graff. Graff was hired to direct in early March 2007 and rewrote the screenplay. Before filming, they had two weeks of music rehearsals. The actors and actresses were designated to play their instruments. Donowho and Michalka had extensive experience with the drums and guitar, respectively, so {{they were used to}} their instruments, but Lisa Chung, Scott Porter and Vanessa Hudgens were not. Hudgens told MTV News she didn't expect there to be as much music, and [...] "they are like, 'We are going to have two weeks of music rehearsals,' and I was like, 'What?' But it was really cool. It's definitely not the kind of music I do normally." [...] Principal photography began on February 9, 2008 in Austin, Texas. Although the film is set in New Jersey, Graff felt strongly {{that it was important to}} shoot in a place with a wide array of great live music to choose from. [...] "I'm a big believer in local scenes," [...] he says. [...] "I think it's the lifeblood of music. Austin is renowned as a music town, <b>and</b> <b>rightly</b> so. They have a ton of really great bands just trying to get their music out there. So, it's great we had an opportunity to use several unsigned local Texas bands." [...] In an interview with Los Angeles Times, director Todd Graff admitted there were cultural incongruities underlying the film. [...] "I know, it's demented. Every once in a while on set I would think to myself, 'I can't believe we got away with this'. I always thought if it only sent one kid to listen to a Velvet Underground record, it would be worth it to me." [...] All of the vocals were filmed live by each of the singing cast members, as mentioned by director Graff. One of the requirements for the film was that all actors had to be able to provide their own vocals. Because Aly Michalka was on tour with her sister AJ Michalka and Miley Cyrus, she did not arrive in Austin until midway through rehearsals. Conveniently, the tour's last stop was in Austin, where rehearsal and filming for the movie took place. All of the instruments and singing in the movie were recorded by the actors, with the exception of the guitar parts of Vanessa Hudgens and Scott Porter, as well as Lisa Chung's piano parts. Although Hudgens and Porter learned how to play their songs, they were dubbed by guitarists Jason Mozersky and JW Wright.|$|E
