Some of these processes end as perivascular end-feet on capillary walls.

50|$|Two main {{types of}} <b>astrocytes</b> {{are found in}} the SGZ: radial <b>astrocytes</b> and {{horizontal}} <b>astrocytes.</b> Radial <b>astrocytes</b> are synonymous with the radial glia cells described earlier and play dual roles as both glial cells and neural stem cells. It is not clear whether individual radial <b>astrocytes</b> can play both roles or only certain radial <b>astrocytes</b> can give rise to NSCs. Horizontal <b>astrocytes</b> do not have radial processes; rather, they extend their processes horizontally, parallel to the border between the hilus and the SGZ. Moreover, they do not appear to generate neuronal progenitors. Because <b>astrocytes</b> are in close contact with many of the other cells in the SGZ, they are well-suited to serve as sensory and regulatory channels in neurogenesis.|$|R

In the adult subgranular zone (SGZ), dense clusters of dividing cells were found to be anatomically close to the vasculature, especially capillaries. Contacts between adult SVZ neuronal precursors and blood vessels are unusually permeable and frequently devoid of <b>astrocyte</b> and pericyte interferences, suggesting that blood-derived cues are gaining direct access to adult neural precursors and their progeny. The vasculature also provides the substrate for new neuron migration after injury in the adult striatum.|$|E
25|$|Astrocytes {{are linked}} by gap junctions, {{creating}} an electrically coupled (functional) syncytium.

25|$|The {{cytokine}} {{family of}} glial scar inducers include interferon-γ (IFNγ) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2).

Reactive <b>astrocytes</b> can then lead to abnormal function of <b>astrocytes</b> and affect their regulation and response to inflammation.|$|R
40|$|Ischemia can {{be induced}} by head trauma, stroke, and cardiac arrest. The causes are multifactorial, {{including}} hypoxia, nutrient deprivation {{and failure to}} remove toxic metabolic products. The injury of ischemic damage to neural cells {{is believed to be}} mediated by the excitotoxicity, calcium accumulation and free radical formation. Neurons are more vulnerable than <b>astrocytes</b> to ischemic damage. Brief exposure to ischemia does not cause severe injury to <b>astrocytes</b> and the responses of <b>astrocytes</b> are suggested to be beneficial to other neural cells in CNS. In this study, two in vitro models were used to study the changes of cellular responses and energy metabolism in cultured <b>astrocytes</b> under ischemia. By using the mineral oil induced ischemia model, c-Fos, c-Jun and the constitutively expressed form of HSP 70 proteins in cultured cortical <b>astrocytes</b> were induced by the injury of ischemia. They may act as specific markers for cortical <b>astrocytes</b> in response to ischemia. The anaerobic chamber induced ischemia model was used to study the alteration of energy metabolism in cortical neurons and <b>astrocytes</b> under ischemia. There was a direct correlation between the energy metabolism and cell injury in <b>astrocytes</b> under ischemia. The depletion of ATP in <b>astrocytes</b> was more tolerable than neurons to this simulated ischemic injury. The extent of damage to <b>astrocytes</b> by ischemia incubation was determined in this study. Two hour of ischemia did not cause any significant damage to <b>astrocytes.</b> Four hour of ischemia caused a moderate injury. By exposure to 6 and 8 hours of ischemia, the damage to cultured <b>astrocytes</b> became severe. Nine hour of ischemia was lethal to cultured <b>astrocytes.</b> The viable <b>astrocytes</b> after various lengths of ischemia incubations were able to retain their ability of ATP production. This study also suggested that the critical period for <b>astrocytes</b> in response to ischemia was between 4 to 6 hours. By studying the biochemical and molecular events of <b>astrocytes</b> around this period, it may provide essential information about the tolerance of <b>astrocytes</b> and assist in the development of potential therapies to prevent and cure the damage by ischemia...|$|R

There is a prevailing notion that HIV- 1 Rev protein function in <b>astrocytes</b> is perturbed, leading to restricted viral replication. In earlier studies, our finding of restricted viral entry into <b>astrocytes</b> {{led us to}} investigate whether there are any intracellular restrictions, including crippled Rev function, in <b>astrocytes.</b> Despite barely detectable levels of DDX 3 (Rev-supporting RNA helicase) and TRBP (anti-PKR) in primary <b>astrocytes</b> compared to astrocytic cells, Rev function was unperturbed in wild-type, but not DDX 3 -ablated <b>astrocytes.</b> As in permissive cells, after HIV- 1 entry bypass in <b>astrocytes,</b> viral-encoded Tat and Rev proteins had robust regulatory activities, leading to efficient viral replication.

Our findings on HIV- 1 entry bypass in <b>astrocytes</b> demonstrated that the intracellular environment is conducive to viral replication and that Tat and Rev functions are unperturbed...|$|R
25|$|The <b>astrocyte</b> is bidirectional, {{meaning that}} it can {{communicate}} and exchange information with both pre- and postsynaptic elements. Communication is primarily controlled by the change in Ca2+ concentrations, causing excitability within the <b>astrocyte.</b> The capability of a human to respond to change in both the external and internal environment is increased due to the hormonal regulation of the tripartite synapse.|$|E
25|$|Ammonia {{toxicity}} {{is often}} seen through two routes of administration, either through consumption or through endogenous ailments such as liver failure. One notable case in which ammonia toxicity is common {{is in response to}} cirrhosis of the liver which results in hepatic encephalopathy, and can result in cerebral edema (Haussinger 2006). This cerebral edema can be the result of nervous cell remodeling. As a consequence of increased concentrations, ammonia activity in-vivo has been shown to induce swelling of astrocytes in the brain through increased production of cGMP (Cyclic Guanosine Monophosphate) within the cells which leads to Protein Kinase G-mediated(PKG) cytoskeletal modifications. The resultant effect of this toxicity can be reduced brain energy metabolism and function. Importantly, the toxic effects of ammonia on <b>astrocyte</b> remodling can be reduced through administration of L-carnitine. This <b>astrocyte</b> remodeling appears to be mediated through ammonia-induced mitochondrial permeability transition. This mitochondrial transition {{is a direct result of}} glutamine activity a compound which forms from ammonia in-vivo. Administration of antioxidants or glutaminase inhibitor can reduce this mitochondrial transition, and potentially also <b>astrocyte</b> remodeling.|$|E

40|$|Growing {{evidence}} indicates important roles for <b>astrocytes</b> in neurodevelopment and diseases. However, <b>astrocytes</b> and {{their roles in}} these processes remain poorly understood. Despite recent progress in reprogramming somatic cells into different types of neural cells, reprogramming to <b>astrocytes</b> has lagged. Here, we show that functional <b>astrocytes</b> can be generated from mammalian fibroblasts using only small molecules. Induced mouse astrocytes resemble primary <b>astrocytes</b> in astrocytic gene expression and epigenomic status and exhibit functional properties in promoting neuronal maturation, glutamate uptake, and calcium signaling. Moreover, these cells can recapitulate the Alexander disease phenotype of protein aggregation when expressing Gfap with a disease-causing mutation. The same compounds can also reprogram human fibroblasts into astroglial progenitor cells that can further mature into functional <b>astrocytes.</b> These chemically induced <b>astrocytes</b> may provide cellular models to uncover roles of <b>astrocytes</b> in normal neurodevelopment and pathogenesis of neurological diseases...|$|R
40|$|The role of <b>astrocytes</b> in the {{pathogenesis}} of multiple sclerosis (MS) is not well understood. <b>Astrocytes</b> may modulate the activity of pathogenic T cells by presenting myelin antigens in combination with pro- or anti-inflammatory signals. <b>Astrocytes</b> {{have been shown to}} present myelin basic protein (MBP) and proteolipid protein (PLP) to T cells, but it has remained unresolved whether <b>astrocytes</b> present myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), which has been implicated as an important autoantigen in MS. Here, we asked whether <b>astrocytes</b> presented MOG to T cells. To closer model presentation of human MOG by <b>astrocytes</b> in MS patients, we generated <b>astrocytes</b> from transgenic mice expressing the MS-associated MHC class II alleles HLA-DR 2 (DRB 1 * 1501) and HLA-DR 4 (DRB 1 * 0401). The results show that IFN-gamma-activated HLA-DR 2 and HLA-DR 4 expressing <b>astrocytes</b> efficiently presented immunodominant and subdominant MOG peptides to T cells. The hierarchy of the presented MOG epitopes was comparable to that of professional APCs, including dendritic cells and microglia. Importantly, <b>astrocytes</b> were poor at processing and presenting native MOG protein. Furthermore, <b>astrocytes</b> induced a mixed Th 1 /Th 2 cytokine response in MOG-specific T cells, whereas dendritic cells induced a predominantly Th 1 cell response. Collectively, the results suggest that <b>astrocytes</b> may modulate anti-MOG T cell responses in the CNS...|$|R
25|$|Olomoucine, a purine derivative, is a {{cyclin-dependent kinase}} (CDK) inhibitor. CDK is a cell-cycle {{promoting}} protein, which {{along with other}} pro-growth proteins is abnormally activated during glial scar formation. Such proteins can increase <b>astrocyte</b> proliferation and {{can also lead to}} cell death, thus exacerbating cellular damage at the lesion site. Administration of olomoucine peritoneally has been shown to suppress CDK function. Further, olomoucine has been shown to reduce neuronal cell death, reduce astroglial proliferation (and therefore reduce astrogliosis), and increase GAP-43 expression, a useful protein marker for neurite growth. Moreover, reduced <b>astrocyte</b> proliferation decreases expression of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs), major extracellular matrix molecules associated with inhibition of neuroregneration after trauma to the CNS.|$|E

25|$|Astrocytes are macroglial {{cells in}} the central nervous system. Astrocytes are derived from {{heterogeneous}} populations of progenitor {{cells in the}} neuroepithelium of the developing central nervous system. There is remarkable similarity between the well known genetic mechanisms that specify the lineage of diverse neuron subtypes and that of macroglial cells. Just as with neuronal cell specification, canonical signaling factors like Sonic hedgehog (SHH), Fibroblast growth factor (FGFs), WNTs and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), provide positional information to developing macroglial cells through morphogen gradients along the dorsal–ventral, anterior–posterior and medial–lateral axes. The resultant patterning along the neuraxis leads to segmentation of the neuroepithelium into progenitor domains (p0, p1 p2, p3 and pMN) for distinct neuron types in the developing spinal cord. On the basis of several studies it is now believed that this model also applies to macroglial cell specification. Studies carried out by Hochstim and colleagues have demonstrated that three distinct populations of astrocytes arise from the p1, p2 and p3 domains. These subtypes of astrocytes can be identified {{on the basis of}} their expression of different transcription factors (PAX6, NKX6.1) and cell surface markers (reelin and SLIT1). The three populations of <b>astrocyte</b> subtypes which have been identified are 1) dorsally located VA1 astrocytes, derived from p1 domain, express PAX6 and reelin 2) ventrally located VA3 astrocytes, derived from p3, express NKX6.1 and SLIT1 and 3) and intermediate white-matter located VA2 <b>astrocyte,</b> derived from the p2 domain, which express PAX6, NKX6.1, reelin and SLIT1. After <b>astrocyte</b> specification has occurred in the developing CNS, it is believed that <b>astrocyte</b> precursors migrate to their final positions within the nervous system before the process of terminal differentiation occurs.|$|E
40|$|<b>Astrocytes</b> {{are known}} to express several growth factors in {{response}} to injury and neurological disease. Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) induces <b>astrocytes</b> to divide in vitro and is expressed by developing, but not adult <b>astrocytes</b> both in vivo and in vitro. We tested whether IGF-I is re-expressed by reactive <b>astrocytes</b> in response to injury. We found that <b>astrocytes</b> surrounding the lesioned parenchyma after introduction of cannula through the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and midbrain contain high levels of immunoreactive IGF-I, as determined by immunocytochemistry using a highly sensitive and specific anti-IGF-I monoclonal antibody. Interestingly, the contralateral hippocampus also contained IGF-I positive <b>astrocytes</b> although in substantial lower numbers. Intact animals showed no detectable IGF-I immunoreactivity in <b>astrocytes.</b> IGF-I was detected at the first time point tested after the lesion was made, 1 week, and for at least 1 month thereafter. Reactive <b>astrocytes</b> expressing high levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein were found in a much wider distribution all along the lesioned area and beyond. We conclude that mechanical injury of the brain induces a specific pattern of expression of IGF-I by a subpopulation of <b>astrocytes.</b> These findings suggest that IGF-I is participating in the response of <b>astrocytes</b> to injury.

40|$|L-DOPA is therapeutically efficacious in {{patients}} with Parkinson’s disease (PD), although dopamine (DA) neurons are severely degenerated. Since cortical <b>astrocytes</b> express neutral amino acid transporter (LAT) and DA transporter (DAT), the uptake and metabolism of L-DOPA and DA in striatal <b>astrocytes</b> may influence their availability in the dopaminergic system of PD. To assess possible L-DOPA- and DA-uptake and metabolic properties of striatal <b>astrocytes,</b> we examined the expression of L-DOPA, DA and DAT in striatal <b>astrocytes</b> of hemi-parkinsonian model rats after repeated L-DOPA administration, and measured the contents of L-DOPA, DA and their metabolite in primary cultured striatal <b>astrocytes</b> after L-DOPA/DA treatment. Repeated injections of L-DOPA induced apparent L-DOPA- and DA-immunoreactivities and marked expression of DAT in reactive <b>astrocytes</b> on the lesioned side of the striatum in hemi-parkinsonian rats. Exposure to DA for 4 h significantly increased the levels of DA and its metabolite DOPAC in cultured striatal <b>astrocytes.</b> L-DOPA was also markedly increased in cultured striatal <b>astrocytes</b> after 4 -h L-DOPA exposure, but DA was not detected 4 or 8 h after L-DOPA treatment, despite the expression of aromatic amino acid decarboxylase in <b>astrocytes.</b> Furthermore, the intracellular level of L-DOPA in cultured striatal <b>astrocytes</b> decreased rapidly after removal of extracellular L-DOPA. The results suggest that DA uptaken into striatal <b>astrocytes</b> is rapidly metabolized and that striatal <b>astrocytes</b> act as a reservoir of L-DOPA that govern the uptake or release of L-DOPA depending on extracellular L-DOPA concentration, but are less capable of converting L-DOPA to DA...|$|R
40|$|Glutamate is {{not only}} a {{neurotransmitter}} but also an important neurotoxin in central nervous system (CNS). Chronic elevation of glutamate induces both neuronal and glial cell apoptosis. However, its effect on <b>astrocytes</b> is complex and still remains unclear. In this study, we investigated whether morphine, a common opioid ligand, could affect glutamate-induced apoptosis in <b>astrocytes.</b> Primary cultured <b>astrocytes</b> were incubated with glutamate in the presence/absence of morphine. It was found that morphine could reduce glutamate-induced apoptosis of <b>astrocytes.</b> Furthermore, glutamate activated Ca 2 + release, thereby inducing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in <b>astrocytes,</b> while morphine attenuated this deleterious effect. Using siRNA to reduce the expression of κ-opioid receptor, morphine could not effectively inhibit glutamate-stimulated Ca 2 + release in <b>astrocytes,</b> the protective effect of morphine on glutamate-injured <b>astrocytes</b> was also suppressed. These results suggested that morphine could protect <b>astrocytes</b> from glutamate-induced apoptosis via reducing Ca 2 + overload and ER stress pathways. In conclusion, this study indicated that excitotoxicity participated in the glutamate mediated apoptosis in <b>astrocytes,</b> while morphine attenuated this deleterious effect via regulating Ca 2 + release and ER stress...|$|R

25|$|Astrocytes are glial {{cells that}} are {{abundant}} in {{the central nervous system}}. They are crucial for the metabolic and trophic support of neurons; additionally, astrocytes provide ion buffering and neurotransmitter clearance. Growing axons are guided by cues created by astrocytes; thus, astrocytes can regulate neurite pathfinding and subsequently, patterning in the developing brain. The glial scar that forms post-injury in the central nervous system is formed by astrocytes and fibroblasts; it is the most significant obstacle for regeneration. The glial scar consists of hypertrophied astrocytes, connective tissue, and ECM. Two goals of neural tissue engineering are to understand <b>astrocyte</b> function and to develop control over astrocytic growth. Studies by Shany et al. (2006) have demonstrated that <b>astrocyte</b> survival rates are increased on 3D aragonite matrices compared to conventional 2D cell cultures.

40|$|This short review will {{summarize}} the current knowledge on the uptake, storage and export of copper ions by <b>astrocytes</b> and {{will address the}} potential roles of <b>astrocytes</b> in copper homeostasis in the normal and diseased brain. <b>Astrocytes</b> in culture efficiently accumulate copper by processes that include both the copper transporter Ctr 1 and Ctr 1 -independent mechanisms. Exposure of <b>astrocytes</b> to copper induces an increase in cellular glutathione (GSH) content as well as synthesis of metallothioneins, suggesting that excess of copper is stored as complex with GSH and in metallothioneins. Furthermore, exposure of <b>astrocytes</b> to copper accelerates the release of GSH and of glycolytically generated lactate. <b>Astrocytes</b> are able to export copper and express the Menkes protein ATP 7 A. This protein undergoes reversible, copper-dependent trafficking between the trans-Golgi network and vesicular structures. The ability of <b>astrocytes</b> to efficiently take up, store and export copper suggests that <b>astrocytes</b> {{play a key role}} in the supply of neurons with copper and that <b>astrocytes</b> should be considered as target for therapeutic inventions that aim to correct disturbances in brain copper homeostasis...|$|R
40|$|Histaminergic {{signalling}} {{constitutes an}} attractive target {{for treatment of}} neuropsychiatric disorders. One obstacle to developing new pharmacological options has been failure to identify putative specific histamine transporter responsible for histamine clearance. Although high-affinity histamine uptake was detected in neonatal cortical <b>astrocytes,</b> its existence in other brain regions remains largely unexplored. We investigated whether cerebellar and striatal <b>astrocytes</b> participate in histamine clearance and evaluated the role of organic cation transporters (OCT) in astroglial histamine transport. Kinetic and pharmacological characteristics of histamine transport were determined in cultured <b>astrocytes</b> derived from neonatal rat cerebellum, striatum and cerebral cortex. As well as <b>astrocytes</b> of cortical origin, cultured striatal and cerebellar <b>astrocytes</b> displayed temperature-sensitive, high-affinity histamine uptake. Exposure to ouabain or Na+-free medium, supplemented with choline chloride markedly depressed histamine transport in cortical <b>astrocytes.</b> Conversely, histamine uptake in striatal and cortical <b>astrocytes</b> was ouabain-resistant and was only partially diminished during incubation {{in the absence of}} Na+. Also, histamine uptake remained unaltered upon exposure to OCT inhibitor corticosterone, although OCTs were expressed in cultured <b>astrocytes.</b> Finally, histamine transport in cerebellar and striatal <b>astrocytes</b> was not sensitive to antidepressants. Despite common characteristics, cerebellar <b>astrocytes</b> had lower affinity, but markedly higher transport capacity for histamine compared to striatal <b>astrocytes.</b> Collectively, we provide evidence to suggest that cerebellar, striatal as well as cortical <b>astrocytes</b> possess saturable histamine uptake systems, which are not operated by OCTs. In addition, our data indicate that Na+-independent histamine carrier predominates in cerebellar and striatal <b>astrocytes,</b> whereas Na+-dependent transporter underlies histamine uptake in cortical <b>astrocytes.</b> Our findings implicate a role for histamine transporters in regulation of extracellular histamine concentration in cerebellum and striatum.
