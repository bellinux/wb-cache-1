Women's Wear Daily stated that Pat had a [...] "good figure and good posture", as well as [...] "the best-looking legs of any woman in public life today". Some fashion writers tended to have a lackluster opinion of her well tailored, but nondescript, American-made clothes. [...] "I consider it my duty to use American designers", she said, and favored them because, [...] "they are now using so many materials which <b>are</b> <b>great</b> <b>for</b> traveling because they're non crushable". She preferred to buy readymade garments rather than made-to-order outfits. [...] "I'm a size 10," [...] she told The New York Times. [...] "I can just walk in and buy.

500|$|Ayane {{is often}} {{regarded}} as a top-tier character {{in many of the}} games she is playable in, especially in the DOA fighting games where she was noted for being very unpredictable and confusing for the opponent as well as fast and hard to counter. Previewing the original Dead or Alive for the PlayStation, Computer & Video Games opined she [...] "has an unusual floaty kind of fighting style, but has some great moves. Her quick punches make stringing combos together easy, and her throws <b>are</b> <b>great</b> <b>for</b> hitting people into the Danger Zone" [...] (an interactive feature within some arenas). In Prima Games' official guide for Dead or Alive Ultimate (a remake version of Dead or Alive and Dead or Alive 2), Eric Mylonas declared Ayane the [...] "tougher of the two siblings" [...] as she [...] "brings strings of blindingly fast combos into play and has devastating holds and throws." [...] Mylonas wrote Ayane has a major weakness in that she can not stop moving without becoming [...] "an easy prey," [...] and she may not be favored by those who prefer [...] "huge, over-the-top moves," [...] but for a [...] "more patient sort, there's probably no better character in the game." [...] According to GameSpy's guide to Ultimate by Andrew Alfonso, Ayane's key moves include her high kick—which is [...] "a lot" [...] better than Kasumi's—with another move so powerful [...] "it's almost unfair to use it." [...] He also noted how she can be actually more effective with her back turned towards her opponent, {{despite the fact that the}} characters cannot block when facing away from an enemy. In his guide to Dead or Alive 3, Alfonso wrote Ayane is a very unpredictable and quick attacker, even more than in the previous games in the series, and should be played primarily for her backwards position, hers being the best such stance of all the characters in the game. Ayane's speed and deceiving attacks make her a [...] "pretty good" [...] partner for slower fighters for tag team battles, but her primary partners are other ninja characters.|$|E

The next time I go down to see to its [...] "doing up," [...] I will {{try to have a}} photograph taken of the pleasant little old-world town-angle into which its nice old red-bricked front, its high old Georgian doorway and a most delightful little old architectural garden-house, perched alongside of it on its high brick garden-wall--into which all these pleasant features together so happily [...] "compose." [...] Two years ago, after I had lost my heart to it--walking over from Point Hill to make sheep's eyes at it (the more so that it is called Lamb House!)--there was no appearance whatever that one could ever have it; either that its fond proprietor would give it up or that if he did it would come at all within one's means. So I simply sighed and renounced; tried to think no more about it; till at last, out of the blue, a note from the good local ironmonger, to whom I had whispered at the time my hopeless passion, informed me that by the sudden death of the owner and the preference (literal) of his son for Klondyke, it might perhaps drop into my lap. Well, {{to make a long story}} short, it did immediately drop and, more miraculous still to say, on terms, for a long lease, well within one's means--terms quite deliciously moderate. The result of these is, naturally, that they will [...] "do" [...] nothing to it: but, on the other hand, it has been so well lived in and taken care of that the doing--off one's own bat--is reduced mainly to sanitation and furnishing--which latter includes the peeling off of old papers from several roomfuls of pleasant old top-to-toe wood panelling. There are two rooms of complete old oak--one of them a delightful little parlour, opening by one side into the little vista, church-ward, of the small old-world street, where not one of the half-dozen wheeled vehicles of Rye ever passes; and on the other straight into the garden and the approach, from that quarter, to the garden-house aforesaid, which is simply the making of a most commodious and picturesque detached study and workroom. Ten days ago Alfred Parsons, best of men as well as best of landscape-painters-and-gardeners, went down with me and revealed to me the most charming possibilities for the treatment of the tiny out-of-door part--it amounts to about an acre of garden and lawn, all shut in by the peaceful old red wall aforesaid, on which the most flourishing old espaliers, apricots, pears, plums and figs, assiduously grow. It appears that it's a glorious little growing exposure, air, and soil--and all the things that were still flourishing out of doors (November 20th) were a joy to behold. There went with me also a good friend of mine, Edward Warren, a very distingué architect and loyal spirit, who is taking charge of whatever is to be done. So I hope to get in, comfortably enough, early in May. In the meantime one must [...] "pick up" [...] a sufficient quantity of ancient mahogany-and-brass odds and ends--a task really the more amusing, here, where the resources <b>are</b> <b>great,</b> <b>for</b> having to be thriftily and cannily performed.

The [...] "King's Room" [...] will be especially treated with a preoccupation of the comfort and aesthetic sense of cherished sisters-in-law; King's Room so-called by reason of George Second having passed a couple of nights there and so stamped it for ever. (He was forced ashore, at Rye, on a progress somewhere with some of his ships, by a tempest, and accommodated at Lamb House as at the place in the town then most consonant with his grandeur. It would, for that matter, quite correspond to this description still. Likewise the Mayors of Rye have usually lived there! Or the persons usually living there have usually become mayors! That was conspicuously the case with the late handsome old Mr. Bellingham, whose son is my landlord. So you see the ineluctable dignity in store for me.) But enough of this swagger.
