500|$|The God of War comic series {{received}} mixed reviews. Mike Murphy of Platform Nation {{stated that}} although the comic series serves as a good prequel to the video game series, [...] "the story is bogged down by horrible art... muddy, confusing, and consistently pulls {{you out of the}} story <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> figure out just what is going on from panel to panel." [...] Rating it 5 out of 10, Murphy said that he [...] "can’t give this one a pass, even to the hardcore God of War fans" [...] who should [...] "skip it." ...|$|E
500|$|Rolling Stone {{noted the}} genre's {{lack of a}} clear definition. Robert Loss {{acknowledges}} the challenges of defining [...] "grunge"; he states that one can recount stories from the grunge scene to try and explain it, but as soon <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> define grunge this way, [...] "it slips out of your hand". Roy Shuker states that the term [...] "obscured a variety of styles." [...] Stetson states that grunge was not a movement, [...] "monolithic musical genre", or a way to react to 1980s-era metal pop; he calls the term a misnomer mostly based on hype. Shuker states that the [...] "'Seattle sound' became a marketing ploy for the music industry." [...] Stetson also states that prominent bands considered to be grunge (Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, Mudhoney and Hammerbox) all sound different. Mark Yarm, author of Everybody Loves Our Town: An Oral History of Grunge, pointed out vast differences between grunge bands, with some being punk and others being metal-based.|$|E
500|$|Chris True, {{also from}} AllMusic, {{selected}} the song as a standout track on her Greatest Hits 87-97 album. Jason Lipshutz from Billboard listed [...] "Breathe" [...] at four on their [...] "Kylie Minogue Primer: The Top 10 Past Hits You Need to Know" [...] stating [...] "'Breathe’ {{is the obvious}} stand out, sounding almost like a Nine Inch Nails throwaway in its opening seconds and morphing into a silky, sexy defence of Minogue's experimental side." [...] Louis Virtel from The Backlot listed [...] "Breathe" [...] at number14 on their [...] "Kylie Minogue’s 50 Best Songs, in Honor of Her Birthday" [...] and said [...] "'Breathe' would be a meditative masterpiece if it weren't so confrontational, deadpan, and sexually domineering. Impossible Princess unassuming heart stopper trips into unexpected carnality in its choruses, assuring you 'It won’t be long now' <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> time your hyperventilation." [...] According to Tom Parker, who provided the special edition album notes for Impossible Princess, [...] " [...] is a seductive electronic groove, with a hypnotic subtlety and timelessness befitting the theme inward contemplating and resolve." [...] Larry Flick from Billboard said that [...] "Breathe" [...] is a [...] "user-friendly jam" [...] which is [...] "largely due to its big-beat electronic groove and ear-tickling pop chorus." ...|$|E

500|$|Reviews were universally {{less than}} {{positive}} on other systems. While critics praised {{the idea of}} the game, they found fault in the execution. Several critics disliked that the troops spawned by the player simply walk past the troops spawned by the opponent without the two groups fighting. The game's flow also attracted significant criticism, with Peter Eykemans of IGN saying [...] "Even on double speed, the pace is painful. This makes a simple two-person battle turn into a lengthy saga of repeating the same actions over and over again." [...] and Ray Carsillo of Electronic Gaming Monthly complaining of [...] "long drawn out matches on even the easiest difficulty settings <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> force your way past a virtual stalemate". While the visuals did receive praise, critics felt that they also {{got in the way of}} allowing the player to tell what was going on in the game. Opinions about the narrator were mixed. Henry Winchester of PC Gamer praised the voiceover, calling it [...] "a pleasingly booze-obsessed voiceover, delivered by what sounds like a Dalek doing an impression of Sean Connery". Carsillo of Electronic Gaming Monthly was less kind, stating that [...] "your narrator and chief advisor sounds like an awful Sean Connery impersonator and he may be the best of the voice actors you come across". GamesRadar strikes a more neutral tone, stating that [...] "Pre and post-battle dialog is fully voiced by what are only technically 'actors,' but it definitely beats silent text, and does add a bit of flavor to the world." [...] Multiplayer also received mixed reviews. Eykemans of IGN suggested that multiplayer exacerbates the length and flow issues already present in the single player game, while Matt Hughes of GamesRadar calls multiplayer the game's [...] "biggest asset", stating that [...] "Playing against real humans definitely ramps up the intensity and reduces the cheap exploitation found in the campaign.".|$|E

6000|$|Listen to {{the charm}} of birds in any sequestered {{woodland}} on a bright forenoon in early summer. <b>As</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> disentangle the medley of sounds, the first, perhaps, which will strike your ear will be the loud, harsh, monotonous, flippant song of the chaffinch, and the metallic clinking {{of two or three}} sorts of titmice.

Above the pastures outside the skylark sings--as he alone can sing; and close by from the hollies rings out the blackbird's tenor--rollicking, audacious, humorous, all but articulate. From the tree above him rises the treble of the thrush, pure as the song of angels; more pure, perhaps, in tone, though neither so varied nor so rich as the song of the nightingale. And there, in the next holly, is the nightingale himself; now croaking like a frog, now talking aside to his wife, and now bursting out into that song, or cycle of songs, in which if any man find sorrow, he himself surely finds none.

6000|$|We {{have got}} {{something}} out of the lines, I think, and much more is yet to be found in them; but we have done enough by way of example of the kind of word-by-word examination of your author which is rightly called [...] "reading;" [...] watching every accent and expression, and putting ourselves always in the author's place, annihilating our own personality, and seeking to enter into his, so as to be able assuredly to say, [...] "Thus Milton thought," [...] not [...] "Thus I thought, in misreading Milton." [...] And by this process you will gradually come to attach less weight to your own [...] "Thus I thought" [...] at other times. You will begin to perceive that what YOU thought was a matter of no serious importance;--that your thoughts on any subject are not perhaps the clearest and wisest that could be arrived at thereupon:- in fact, that unless you are a very singular person, you cannot be said to have any [...] "thoughts" [...] at all; that you have no materials for them, in any serious matters; {8}--no right to [...] "think," [...] but only to try to learn more of the facts. Nay, most probably all your life (unless, as I said, you are a singular person) you will have no legitimate right to an [...] "opinion" [...] on any business, except that instantly under your hand. What must of necessity be done, you can always find out, beyond question, how to do. Have you a house to keep in order, a commodity to sell, a field to plough, a ditch to cleanse? There need be no two opinions about these proceedings; it is at your peril if you have not much more than an [...] "opinion" [...] on the way to manage such matters. And also, outside of your own business, there are one or two subjects on which you are bound to have but one opinion. That roguery and lying are objectionable, and are instantly to be flogged out of the way whenever discovered;--that covetousness and love of quarrelling are dangerous dispositions even in children, and deadly dispositions in men and nations;--that, in the end, the God of heaven and earth loves active, modest, and kind people, and hates idle, proud, greedy, and cruel ones;--on these general facts you are bound to have but one, and that a very strong, opinion. For the rest, respecting religions, governments, sciences, arts, you will find that, on the whole, you can know NOTHING,--judge nothing; that the best you can do, even though you may be a well- educated person, is to be silent, and strive to be wiser every day, and to understand a little more of the thoughts of others, which so soon <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> do honestly, you will discover that the thoughts even of the wisest are very little more than pertinent questions. To put the difficulty into a clear shape, and exhibit to you the grounds for INdecision, that is all they can generally do for you!-- and well for them and for us, if indeed they are able [...] "to mix the music with our thoughts and sadden us with heavenly doubts." [...] This writer, from whom I have been reading to you, is not among the first or wisest: he sees shrewdly as far as he sees, and therefore it is easy to find out its full meaning; but with the greater men, you cannot fathom their meaning; they do not even wholly measure it themselves,--it is so wide. Suppose I had asked you, for instance, to seek for Shakespeare's opinion, instead of Milton's on this matter of Church authority?--or for Dante's? Have any of you, at this instant, the least idea what either thought about it? Have you ever balanced the scene with the bishops in 'Richard III.' against the character of Cranmer? the description of St. Francis and St. Dominic against that of him who made Virgil wonder to gaze upon him,--"disteso, tanto vilmente, nell' eterno esilio;" [...] or of him whom Dante stood beside, [...] "come 'l frate che confessa lo perfido assassin?" [...] {9} Shakespeare and Alighieri knew men better than most of us, I presume! They were both {{in the midst of the}} main struggle between the temporal and spiritual powers. They had an opinion, we may guess. But where is it? Bring it into court! Put Shakespeare's or Dante's creed into articles, and send IT up for trial by the Ecclesiastical Courts! ...|$|E
