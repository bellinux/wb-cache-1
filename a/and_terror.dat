5|$|By {{the end of}} the war, {{for many}} Italians the name of Kesselring, whose {{signature}} appeared on posters and printed orders announcing draconian measures adopted by the German occupation, had become synonymous with the oppression <b>and</b> <b>terror</b> that had characterised the German occupation. Kesselring's name headed the list of German officers blamed for a long series of atrocities perpetrated by the German forces.|$|E
5|$|Conquest in Africa and the East {{provided}} both wonder <b>and</b> <b>terror</b> to European intellectuals, as {{it led to}} {{the conclusion}} that Eden could never have been an actual geographical location. The Garden references exotic travel literature of the 15th century through the animals, including lions and a giraffe, in the left panel. The giraffe has been traced to Cyriac of Ancona, a travel writer known for his visits to Egypt during the 1440s. The exoticism of Cyriac's sumptuous manuscripts may have inspired Bosch's imagination.|$|E

He sailed along a huge wall of ice that was later named the Ross Ice Shelf.

5|$|On 13 October 1999, the NDA, {{without the}} AIADMK, won 303 seats in {{parliament}} and thus an outright majority. The BJP had its highest ever tally of 183.

Its policy agenda included a more aggressive stance on defence <b>and</b> <b>terror</b> as well as neo-liberal economic policies.|$|E

The Red Army, which was campaigning in Georgia at the time, returned to suppress the revolt and drove its leaders out of Armenia.|$|E

5|$|The Ross {{expedition}} was {{a voyage}} of scientific {{exploration of the}} Antarctic in 1839 to 1843, led by James Clark Ross, with two unusually strong warships, HMS Erebus and HMS Terror. It explored {{what is now called}} the Ross Sea and discovered the Ross Ice Shelf. On the expedition, Ross discovered the Transantarctic Mountains and the volcanoes Erebus <b>and</b> <b>Terror,</b> named after his ships. The young botanist Joseph Dalton Hooker made his name on the expedition.|$|E
5|$|The scholar van Kooij {{notes that}} the {{iconography}} of Chhinnamasta has the elements of heroism (vira rasa) <b>and</b> <b>terror</b> (bhayanaka rasa) as well as eroticism (sringara rasa) {{in terms of the}} copulating couple, with the main motifs being the offering of her own severed head, the spilling and drinking of blood, and the trampling of the couple.|$|E
5|$|The {{second son}} of King Ludwig I of Bavaria, Otto ascended {{the newly created}} throne of Greece while still a minor. His {{government}} was initially run by a three-man regency council made up of Bavarian court officials. Upon reaching his majority, Otto removed the regents when they proved unpopular with the people and he ruled as an absolute monarch. Eventually his subjects' demands for a Constitution proved overwhelming, and {{in the face of}} an armed but bloodless insurrection Otto in 1843 granted a constitution. However he rigged elections using fraud <b>and</b> <b>terror.</b>|$|E

5|$|To reduce costs, no alien {{spacecraft}} is seen at {{the start}} of the film; instead, Kator's arrival is conveyed solely by flashing lights and sound effects. As the low budget also precluded the use of an orchestra, composer Ivor Slaney devised a synthesised score featuring occasional contributions from traditional instruments (such as a piano) that he recorded himself. Slaney also composed for Warren's next film, Terror (1978). The soundtracks for Prey <b>and</b> <b>Terror</b> were released jointly on CD in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Immense {{quantities}} {{of dust and}} coal rose {{high into the air}} in an inverted cone...In the village of Heworth, this cloud caused a darkness like that of early twilight and covered the roads so thickly that the footsteps of passengers were deeply imprinted in it. As soon as the explosion was heard, wives and children of the workmen ran to the pit. Wildness <b>and</b> <b>terror</b> were pictured in every countenance. The crowd soon collected to several hundreds, some crying out for a husband, others for a parent or a son, and all affected by a mixture of horror, anxiety and grief.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Magical Zoo's The Screamer was a bio-horror RPG {{released}} for the NEC PC-88 {{that was}} set in a post-apocalyptic research facility, while the gameplay featured shooter-based combat and permanent death. The {{latter half of the}} 1980s saw the release of several other horror-themed games, including Konami's Castlevania in 1986, and Sega's Kenseiden and Namco's Splatterhouse in 1988, though despite the macabre imagery of these games, their gameplay did not diverge much from other action games at the time. Splatterhouse in particular is notable for its large amount of bloodshed <b>and</b> <b>terror,</b> despite being an arcade beat 'em up with very little emphasis on survival.|$|E

5|$|On 9 April 1940, Germany invaded Denmark, occupying Aarhus the {{following}} day and 5 years hence. The occupation was a destructive period with major disasters, loss of life and economic depression. The Port of Aarhus became a hub for supplies to the Baltics and Norway while the surrounding rail network supplied the Atlantic Wall in west Jutland and cargo headed for Germany. Combined, these factors resulted in a strong German presence, especially in 1944–45. The first years were peaceful {{in conjunction with the}} policies of the Danish Protectorate Government, but following the enactment of the Communist Law in August 1941, the first armed resistance and sabotage commenced, gradually growing in intensity over the years with repression <b>and</b> <b>terror</b> in response.|$|E
5|$|The Act II {{illustration}} from Les Beautés shows a {{dark wood}} {{with a pool}} of water in the distance. The branches of aged trees create a tree tunnel. Beneath these branches on the left is a marble cross with 'Giselle' carved on it. From one of its arms hangs the crown of grape leaves Giselle wore as Queen of the Vintage. On the stage, thick weeds and wildflowers (200 bulrushes and 120 branches of flowers) were the undergrowth. The gas jets of the footlights and those overhead suspended in the flies were turned low to create a mood of mystery <b>and</b> <b>terror.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Crucifixion {{itself is}} conspicuously absent, {{and there is}} no trace or shadow of its {{presence}} in the panels. Writing in 1996, Wieland Schmied noted that the three Furies have replaced Christ and the two thieves crucified on either side of him. The form of the Furies is borrowed directly from Picasso's late 1920s and mid-1930s pictures of biomorphs on beaches, in particular from the Spanish artist's The Bathers (1937). However, the eroticism and comedy of Picasso's figures have been replaced by a sense of menace <b>and</b> <b>terror</b> derived in part from Matthias Grünewald's Mocking of Christ.|$|E

5|$|The {{argument}} that destruction <b>and</b> <b>terror</b> {{are part of}} revolution I do not dispute. I {{know that in the}} past every great political and social change necessitated violence...Black slavery might still be a legalized institution in the United States but for the militant spirit of the John Browns. I have never denied that violence is inevitable, nor do I gainsay it now. Yet {{it is one thing to}} employ violence in combat, as a means of defense. It is quite another thing to make a principle of terrorism, to institutionalize it, to assign it the most vital place in the social struggle. Such terrorism begets counter-revolution and in turn itself becomes counter-revolutionary.|$|E
5|$|Werewolf Canyon {{debuted in}} 2003 in Thunder Canyon. 2004 saw the {{addition}} of CarnEvil and Lair of the Vampire. Werewolf Canyon was also expanded that year. Fear Faire, with a medieval theme, was added in 2006. In 2007, the park added the Monster Midway Invasion Celebration Parade which goes from Gemini to the main midway. In 2008, HalloWeekends received a major expansion. CornStalkers replaced Werewolf Canyon, Club Blood replaced Lair of the Vampire, CarnEvil was relocated to Camp Snoopy <b>and</b> <b>Terror</b> Island was added under Millennium Force. The area near Blue Streak {{was turned into a}} children's area, Magical House on Boo Hill was relocated and a haybale maze was added. HalloWeekends was extended to eight weekends for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Agreeing to fund {{half of the}} {{proposed}} £1million budget, the Hong Kong Shaw Brothers became partners in the film's production. Elder brother Sir Run Run Shaw is credited as the presenter of Inseminoid in the opening titles. With a production staff of 75, principal photography commenced on 12 May 1980. John Metcalfe, camera operator for Satan's Slave <b>and</b> <b>Terror,</b> {{assumed the role of}} cinematographer. His former role fell to the less experienced Dick Pope. Three weeks of location filming at the Chislehurst Caves in Kent preceded a one-week indoor session at Lee International Studios at Wembley Park in London. The second unit completed special effects and linking shots in a fifth week, based at Film House in Wardour Street. To simulate the desolate landscape of the alien planet in long shots, the production team departed for the island of Gozo off Malta for a final shoot of two days, capitalising on the strong Mediterranean sun to produce good lighting.|$|E
