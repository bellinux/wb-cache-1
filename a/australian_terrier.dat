25|$|Development of {{the breed}} began in Australia about 1820, {{and the dogs}} were at first called the Rough Coated Terrier. The breed was officially {{recognised}} in 1850, and later renamed as the <b>Australian</b> <b>Terrier</b> in 1892. The <b>Australian</b> <b>Terrier</b> was shown at a dog show {{for the first time}} in 1906 in Melbourne, and was also shown in Great Britain about the same time. The Kennel Club (UK) recognised the breed in 1933. The American Kennel Club recognised the <b>Australian</b> <b>Terrier</b> in 1960, and the United Kennel Club (US) in 1970. It is now recognised by all of the kennel clubs in the English speaking world, and also is listed by various minor kennel clubs and other clubs and registries.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>Australian</b> <b>Terrier</b> is {{descended from}} the rough coated type terriers brought from Great Britain to Australia in the early 19th century. The ancestral types {{of all of these}} breeds were kept to {{eradicate}} mice and rats. [...] The <b>Australian</b> <b>Terrier</b> shares ancestors with the Cairn Terrier, Shorthaired Skye Terrier, and the Dandie Dinmont Terrier; Yorkshire Terriers and Irish Terriers were also crossed into the dog during the breed's development.|$|E

2500|$|The breed {{standard}} describes the ideal <b>Australian</b> <b>Terrier</b> temperament as spirited, alert, [...] "with the natural aggressiveness of a ratter and hedge hunter". Aussies [...] rank 34th in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, being of above average [...] "Working and Obedience" [...] intelligence, indicating good trainability. As with other terriers, {{they can be}} dog-aggressive and somewhat bossy, and {{care must be taken}} when living in a multi-pet household. In general, adult male terriers do not get along well with other adult male dogs. [...] Since the <b>Australian</b> <b>Terrier</b> was also bred for companionship, they tend to be very people friendly, and enjoy interacting with people.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are three}} {{completed}} health surveys for Australian Terriers. [...] Two surveys, one in 1997 {{and one in}} 2002, have been conducted by the <b>Australian</b> <b>Terrier</b> Club of America. The Club is currently collecting data for their next survey.|$|E
2500|$|The UK Kennel Club has a 2004 survey, {{but it has}} a {{much smaller}} sample size than the <b>Australian</b> <b>Terrier</b> Club of America surveys. [...] Some of the {{respondents}} in the American surveys were from Australia, but there is no separate Australian health survey.|$|E
50|$|Demyelinating diseases/disorders {{have been}} found {{worldwide}} in various animals. Some of these animals include mice, pigs, cattle, hamsters, rats, sheep, Siamese kittens, {{and a number of}} dog breeds (including Chow Chow, Springer Spaniel, Dalmatian, Samoyed, Golden Retriever, Lurcher, Bernese Mountain Dog, Vizsla, Weimaraner, <b>Australian</b> Silky <b>Terrier,</b> and mixed breeds).|$|R
25|$|The famous 1860s showdog Huddersfield Ben {{came from}} Paisley Terrier {{stock in the}} 1860s, and is {{considered}} by all authorities to be the founding sire of the Yorkshire Terrier breed, although the Yorkshire Terrier was not recognised as a separate breed until 1898. When the Paisley Terrier went into decline, the smaller and more popular Yorkshire variety superseded it. Through the Yorkshire, the Paisley Terrier is also the ancestor of several other modern breeds, notably the <b>Australian</b> Silky <b>Terrier</b> and the Biewer Terrier.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Australian</b> Silky <b>Terrier</b> is a {{small and}} compact short-legged terrier, 23 to 26 cm at the withers, alert and active. The long silky grey and white or blue and tan coat is an {{identifying}} feature, hanging straight and parted along the back, and described as [...] "flat, fine and glossy". All proportions and aspects {{of the body and}} head as well as desirable shades of grey and white and placement of markings are extensively described in the breed standard.|$|R
2500|$|Among 619 living {{dogs in the}} 2002 <b>Australian</b> <b>Terrier</b> Club of America survey, {{the most}} {{commonly}} reported health problems were endocrine (primarily diabetes), allergic dermatitis, and musculoskeletal (primarily luxating patella and ruptured cranial cruciate ligament). [...] Other conditions reported among more than 4% of the surveyed dogs were adult onset cataracts and ear infections. [...] The much smaller 2004 UKC survey, with 28 living dogs, suggested similar health concerns.|$|E
2500|$|In both 1997 and 2002 <b>Australian</b> <b>Terrier</b> Club of America surveys, median {{longevity}} of Australian Terriers was 11 years (total {{sample size of}} 230 deceased dogs). [...] In the Kennel Club (UK) 2004 survey, median longevity was 12.1 years, but the sample size was only 11 deceased dogs. [...] 11 years is a typical median longevity for purebred dogs in general, but on {{the low end of}} longevities for breeds similar in size to Australian Terriers.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Australian</b> <b>Terrier</b> {{is a small}} {{dog with}} short legs, {{weighing}} around [...] and standing about [...] at the withers, with a medium length shaggy harsh double coat that is not normally trimmed. Fur is shorter on the muzzle, lower legs, and feet, {{and there is a}} ruff around the neck. The coat colours are shades of blue or red with a lighter coloured topknot, and with markings on face, ears, body and legs of a colour described in the breed standard as [...] "tan, never sandy". The tail was traditionally docked. As with most pet dog breeds, all proportions and aspects of the body and head as well as colours and markings are extensively described in the breed standard.|$|E
50|$|Dogs of any breed, even mixes, {{can compete}} in Schutzhund today, {{but the most}} common breeds are German Shepherds, Belgian Malinois, Boxers, Rottweilers, Dobermans, Cane Corso, Giant Schnauzers, Bouvier des Flandres, Dutch Shepherd Dogs, Beaucerons, American Bulldogs, Black Russian <b>Terriers,</b> Airedale <b>Terriers,</b> <b>Australian</b> Cattle Dogs, and the like.|$|R
5000|$|In Kerry Blue Terriers, Poodles, and Bearded Collies, [...] "blue" [...] {{refers to}} {{colouration}} that is black at birth and progressively greys {{out as the}} dog matures. In Australian Shepherds, Rough Collies, and Shetland Sheepdogs, blue means a blue (black-based) merle. In <b>Australian</b> Silky <b>Terriers,</b> blue means a saddle-type black and tan pattern, where the black parts of the coat progressively fade to a steel grey as the dog matures, and in Australian Cattle Dogs, blue stands for a densely ticked black-based colouration with an overall blue-grey appearance.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Australian</b> Silky <b>Terrier</b> is a terrier, but {{is usually}} {{placed in the}} Toy Group rather than the Terrier Group due to its small size. As breed groupings are done mostly to organise groups of breeds for dog shows, it is safer for the little dogs to be with others their own size, rather than with larger dogs. The Fédération Cynologique Internationale has a special Section of the Terrier Group that {{includes}} only the smallest dogs, while other kennel clubs place the breed in the Toy Group, but universally everyone agrees that the breed's type is Terrier.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Primary Lens Luxation (PLL) is an {{inherited}} disease common in Terrier breeds. A truncating mutation in the ADAMTS 17 orthologue on CFA 03 {{is reported to}} cause PLL in 17 breeds, mostly Terriers. This study investigated the mode of inheritance and penetrance of PLL, age of the ADAMTS 17 mutation, and other possible causes of PLL in <b>Australian</b> Tenterfield <b>Terriers</b> and Miniature Bull Terriers. The ADAMTS 17 mutation and 30 nearby microsatellites on CFA 03 were genotyped in 66 <b>Australian</b> Tenterfield <b>Terriers,</b> and 74 Miniature Bull Terriers. Lifetime risk of developing clinical PLL in homozygote and heterozygous animals, penetrance of PLL in general population, and recurrence risk of the disease for offspring and siblings of an index case was estimated. The effect of the ADAMTS 17 mutation on the risk of PLL was dose and age dependent, and best fitted an additive model. Primary lens luxation was fully penetrant in homozygotes over 6 years and incompletely penetrant with a significant risk of PLL in heterozygote animals. Microsatellite haplotype testing estimated the mutation {{to be an old}} mutation, consistent with its appearance on several different background haplotypes and suggesting it entered the tested Tenterfield Terrier population at least three times, and the tested Miniature Bull Terrier population once. Finite polygenic model and survival analyses suggested that the ADAMTS 17 mutation is the main cause of PLL in these breeds, and if the PLL phenotype is controlled by factors other than this mutation, such as a second locus or an environmental effect, the effect is much less than that of this diseas...|$|R
50|$|The Yorkshire Terrier breed descends from larger but similar Scottish breeds {{such as the}} now extinct Paisley Terrier and the Skye Terrier. In its turn, other breeds {{have been}} created from the Yorkshire Terrier, such as the <b>Australian</b> Silky <b>Terrier,</b> and the Biewer Terrier, bred from a blue, white, and gold puppy they later named Schneeflocken von Friedheck, by Mr. and Mrs. Biewer of Germany.Demand for unusual pets has {{resulted}} in high prices being paid for Yorkshire Terriers crossed with various other breeds, which are described with a portmanteau word made up of syllables (or sounds) from Yorkshire Terrier and the breed name of the other parent.

50|$|The Yorkshire Terrier {{is a small}} {{dog breed}} of terrier type, {{developed}} during the 19th century in Yorkshire, England, to catch rats in clothing mills. The defining feature of the breed is its maximum size of 7 lb, although some may exceed this and grow up to 15 lb. It {{is placed in the}} Toy Terrier section of the Terrier Group by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale and in the Toy Group or Companion Group by other kennel clubs, including the American Kennel Club. A popular companion dog, the Yorkshire Terrier has also been part of the development of other breeds, such as the <b>Australian</b> Silky <b>Terrier.</b> It has a grey, black, and tan coat, and the breed's nickname is Yorkie.|$|R
50|$|The player {{will have}} {{to build up a}} pack of animals. This is easier for some herbivores, which means the player may not {{necessarily}} be at a disadvantage even if they choose a weaker type. There are 50 breeds and 80 types of animals in the game, including Pomeranians, lions, crocodiles, tigers, giraffes, hippos, cheetahs, chimpanzees, gazelles, chickens, Beagles, Dilophosaurus, hyenas, Deinonychus, and Sika deer. As the player plays through the game, additional playable animals are unlocked. There are other animals which are available for the player to download as downloadable content from the PlayStation Store, which include an <b>Australian</b> Silky <b>Terrier,</b> a Smilodon, a robot dog, a Peking Man, a (human) office worker, white and black Pomeranians, a cat, a panda, a crocodile, a kangaroo, and a giraffe.|$|R
5000|$|The breed {{standard}} describe the ideal <b>Australian</b> Silky <b>Terrier</b> temperament as keenly alert and active.

50|$|Up until 1929 the <b>Australian</b> <b>Terrier,</b> the Australian Silky Terrier, and the Yorkshire Terrier {{were not}} clearly defined. Dogs of three {{different}} breeds might be born in the same litter, to be separated by appearance into the different types once they were grown. After 1932 in Australia, further crossbreeding was discouraged, and in 1955 the breed's name officially became the Australian Silky Terrier.

40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} a possible association between Bull Terrier {{polycystic kidney disease}} (BTPKD) and cardiac disease, to determine the prevalence of mitral valve disease (MVD) and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) in the <b>Australian</b> Bull <b>Terrier</b> population, and to compare auscultation and echocardiography in detection of cardiac disease in Bull Terriers. Design Ninety-nine Bull Terriers, {{ranging in age from}} 8 weeks to 13 years and 11 months were auscultated and examined using renal ultrasonography; 86 were also examined using echocardiography. The prevalence and severity of heart defects in dogs with BTPKD was compared with that in dogs without BTPKD. Results Nineteen of these 99 dogs were diagnosed with BTPKD. Forty-two percent of Bull Terriers with BTPKD and 28 % of those without BTPKD had murmurs characteristic of mitral regurgitation or LVOTO. How recently an animal was descended from an ancestor with BTPKD was associated with presence (P = 0. 008) and loudness of a murmur (P = 0. 009). Overall, echocardiography detected MVD in 39 % of Bull Terriers, with increased prevalence in older animals (P = 0. 003). Mitral stenosis was found in eight cases. Fifty-three percent of dogs in this study had evidence of LVOTO, with obstruction consisting of a complex of lesions including dynamic or fixed subvalvular LVOTO, significantly narrowed left ventricular outflow tract or valvular aortic stenosis. Dogs with BTPKD, or those descended from dogs with BTPKD, {{were more likely to have}} MVD (P = 0. 006), and while LVOTO was not more common in these dogs, if they did have LVOTO, they were more likely to have severe obstruction than dogs with no ancestors with BTPKD (analysed in three ways P = 0. 028 to 0. 001). In this study, 46 % of Bull Terriers without a murmur or arrhythmia had cardiac disease detected on echocardiographic examination. Conclusion Cardiac disease, especially MVD and LVOTO, was common in Bull Terriers in this study, and those with BTPKD had an increased risk of cardiac abnormalities. Auscultation did not detect a significant number of Bull Terriers with cardiac disease...|$|R
