30|$|Empirical data on {{authorisations}} granted {{according to}} the Federal Immission Control Act suggest that only 10  % of all authorisation procedures {{according to the}} Federal Immission Control Act are presented to the general public. The remaining <b>authorisation</b> <b>processes</b> are taking place strictly with the administration (UfU 2005). Furthermore, the number of projects presented to the public is decreasing, because German legislature is working towards listing {{an increasing number of}} projects in “column 2 ” of the relevant decree, consisting of projects with lesser environment relevance {{on the one hand and}} less large industrial facilities are being planned in Germany on the other hand (German Advisory Council on the Environment 2002 : 106).|$|R
30|$|Public {{participation}} in <b>authorisation</b> <b>processes</b> {{according to the}} Federal Immission Control Act {{as well as in}} planning permission procedures for infrastructure projects are examples for public {{participation in}} specific technology assessment. The general public in Germany has the opportunity to take part in 775  ±  150 procedures of that kind every year. Empirical data regarding the frequency of actual public participation show that only one in three <b>authorisation</b> <b>processes</b> according to the Federal Immission Control Act is met by public interest. In the field of planning permission procedures, a significantly higher number of projects displayed to the public are met with public interest due to the participation of acknowledged environmental organisations. Here, four of five projects enjoy actual public participation. There is no solid data regarding the influence of the public on any of these procedures, as no evaluable empirical studies on this issue have been carried out in Germany. Still, there is no sensible combination of informal and formalised public participation. This reduces the likelihood of success of formalised public participation. On the other hand, informal participation procedures are facing a number of major challenges, too, such as the acceptance of the results of informal participation processes (Grunwald 2010 : 80 f.). Participation methods used in participative technology assessment as citizens’ conferences, round tables or dialogue processes have not been implemented in formalised public participation in Germany yet, but they can complement them in a meaningful way. Hereto legislation has to realign public participation fundamentally. Apart from public participation at a much earlier stage of a planning process material means have to be provided to enable the often complicated technical discourse between the public, authorities and investors.|$|R

40|$|MBA thesisIt is a {{well-known}} fact that South Africa is rich with coal resources. Remaining coal reserves {{are estimated to be}} at least 69 billion metric tonnes. Both underground and opencast mining methods are used to extract the energy mineral in South Africa. South Africa uses its coal domestically as well as internationally for electricity generation and heating in the Iron and Steel industries. After the promulgation of South Africa‟s constitution, numerous mining related acts were passed in order to address social, economic and environmental factors in a sustainable way. The study sought to assess the positive and negative impacts of mining legislation in the design and development phase of opencast mining projects. An empirical, interpretivist and simple qualitative design approach was used. Data was collected from mining consultants, government authorities and mining companies through face to face semi-structured interviews. The study found that positive impacts of mining legislation on the budget, time and quality of opencast coal mining projects were: Standardised requirements to enter the mining sector, world class drafted legislation, timelines on authorisations, promotion of environmental consciousness and up-skilling of officials involved in <b>authorisation</b> <b>processes.</b> The negative impacts were: Lack of alignment on pieces of legislation, absence of timelines in some acts, turf war between the Department of Minerals Resources (DMR) and the Department of Environmental and Water Affairs (DWEA), long lead times to issue water use licences and environmental authorisations, insufficient clarity on Social Labour Plans and Political influence on authorisations. Recommendations on negative impacts are: Legislation harmonisation, proper and equal remuneration of staff involved in authorisation, site inspection by authorities, and clarity on SLP and stakeholder engagement...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Environmental Management) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013. The main {{legislation}} governing environmental {{authorisation in}} South Africa is the National Environmental Management Act, 107 of 1998 (NEMA). This legislation {{is administered by}} the environmental affairs departments at national, provincial and local spheres of government. Besides NEMA, there are other pieces of legislation which govern environmental authorisation and, in some instances, are administered by other organs of state. They, like NEMA, require submission of reports to authorities for decision-making. This may result in cumbersome and duplication of processes; which in turn, may delay the initiation of development activities. NEMA provides for co-operative governance, coordination of activities and alignment of processes to counter the above problems. Section 24 L states that activities regulated in another law may be regarded as sufficient for authorisation in terms of NEMA, and vice versa. Furthermore, section 24 K provides for consultation and coordination of legislative requirements to avoid duplication. Flowing from these provisions is that competent authorities may exercise their powers by issuing separate or integrated authorisations. All these provisions aim to promote smooth and seamless interactions between all key role-players involved in <b>authorisation</b> <b>processes.</b> However, there are widespread concerns amongst key role-players and the public at large about the lack of application and/or implementation of the foregoing legislative provisions. This study investigates these concerns through a literature review, case study analysis and administration of a questionnaire. The results show that the fruits of these provisions (i. e. coordinated activities, aligned <b>processes</b> and/or integrated <b>authorisations)</b> in the province of KwaZulu-Natal have yet to be realised. This study recommends, therefore, that clear guidance be provided to provinces on how to implement the legislative provisions described above. Master...|$|R
40|$|Large {{multinational}} corporations {{operate in a}} wide variety of countries with a range of risks associated with their size, infrastructures and operational practices. Increasingly ubiquitous and powerful ICTs have enabled the centralisation of many support functions from local operations to the corporate headquarters. This, in turn, has led to a concentration of contracting for financial services with global and strong regional banks, primarily in Western countries by corporate treasuries. In this context, the development and adoption of standardisation in informational linkages can become a crucial component in remote and centralised decision-making by providing a mechanism for re-engaging financial service providers in emerging markets in the execution of financial services with limited intermediation from global or regional banks. Prime broker services, for example, combined with an efficient processing of transactions, can facilitate enhanced international market access for local financial institutions by providing the necessary credit intermediation between {{multinational corporations}} and local financial institutions. This paper seeks to show how the corporate treasury of a large multinational corporation, through the use of ICT-enabled transactional process innovations, is developing effective and efficient mechanisms for the management of the credit, concentration, and operational risks involved in contracting with local financial services firms. It also demonstrates how interoperability based on ICT standards is an essential component of such an arrangement if the risks of operating in a volatile and heterogeneous global financial environment are to be mitigated rather than just displaced or obscured. The paper also illustrates how over the past five years, significant progress has been made in constructing the infrastructures and establishing the services that will be needed to enable financial services institutions in emerging markets to benefit from enhanced access to global markets. It further shows how the pro-active engagement of these local financial services firms and their regulators with such arrangements is an indispensable part to any strategy to reversed, or at least mitigate, the current trend of financial services provisions migrating from local institutions to regional and global banks. Such a pro-active engagement should involve a focused seeking-out of new ways to deliver financing, liquidity management, FX and related services to international multinational firms. This, as will be show, entails a high degree of standardisation, automated supporting of transaction services, active contracting with prime broker services and engagement with regulators in order to ensure automation of reporting requirements and rapid <b>authorisation</b> <b>processes</b> for cross-border transactions.

Section 24 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996 (Constitution) places a duty on government to, amongst others adopt legislative measures to protect the environment, prevent pollution and degradation, and secure sustainable development, while promoting justifiable economic and social development. Government responded {{with the introduction of}} new acts or the amendment of existing acts most of which require an <b>authorisation</b> <b>process</b> as a “command and control” tool to enforce environmental governance within the mining sector.

30|$|The {{two types}} of project {{approval}} procedures have much in common. In both cases, the approval decisions are adopted {{in the exercise of}} circumscribed powers and have a concentration effect. This means that all aspects of the projects were examined by different administration departments (such as the nature conservation authority, the water authority and the building authority) during the approval process. They also have a toleration effect. After the approval was granted, any demands to omit the project or to remove or modify the facilities are ruled out. The differences between the {{two types of}} project approval procedures are, for example, that an <b>authorisation</b> <b>process</b> according to the Federal Immission Control Act has to be completed after seven resp. 3  months, whereas there is no strict time limit for planning permission procedures.

40|$|As {{with the}} {{majority}} of Johannesburg areas, the Newtown Electric Power Station Heritage Precinct does not fully realise its potential for spatial relations facilitating creative means of living. Creativity is a powerful tool to engage present and future possibilities. A Centre to stimulate creativity will benefit the direct area users, as well as contribute to the prominence of the historical and cultural richness of Newtown. The vacant site adjacent to the Sci-Bono Discovery Centre provides an apt location for the Creativity Centre as the intervening programme will activate, strengthen and define the presently underutilised street corner edges. The proposed architectural spaces aim to direct the site’s current movement routes created by pedestrian commuters, in order for creativity to become more ingrained in daily life. The proposed architectural elements aim to facilitate creative activities - both curatorial and organically inspired through community appropriation of specifically designed open, or adaptable, spaces. The Centre aims to become a creative community gathering hub: becoming integral to the existing creative individuals currently pursuing artistic practices in Newtown. Gesamtkunstwerk theoretically guides the project: in terms of the architectural intervention being comprised of singular elements all contributing to a greater whole. Gesamtkunstwerk also programmatically unites the entire Electric Power Station city block, through promoting the unification of art forms with life, as a holistic, creative entity. The Centre acts as a crucial beacon highlighting the importance of creativity in the contemporary South African situation where it is undervalued and underutilised. It also articulates that as a directorial element of societal <b>authorisations</b> and <b>processes,</b> architectural design should articulate the value of creativity through facilitating and inspiring creative modes of living.
