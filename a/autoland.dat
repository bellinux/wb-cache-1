25|$|On June 20, 1994, the DC-X rose {{once again}} for the first flight of second series after {{additional}} SDIO funding was received. Operating with a full propellent load, the flight tested the radar altimeter in control loop and reached an altitude of 870 m during a 136-second flight. Demonstrating an unplanned event on June 27, 1994, the DC-X became the first unmanned vehicle to save itself when an in-flight abort occurred after a gaseous hydrogen explosion. The vehicle demonstrated <b>autoland</b> its capabilities after reaching an altitude of 790 meters during a 78-second flight. After repairs were made, the DC-X continued expansion of the flight envelope on May 16, 1995, demonstrating constant angle of attack after reaching an altitude of 1330 m during a 124-second flight.

40|$|The {{authors have}} {{assessed}} {{the capability of}} various neural-aided classical feedback controllers that have been designed for <b>autolanding</b> of a typical modern high performance fighter aircraft under unknown actuator failures and external wind disturbances. Analysis of the fault tolerance envelopes of these neural-aided controllers revealed that position and rate saturation of the healthy actuators resulted in loss of control and failure to complete the <b>autolanding</b> task. Therefore, the over-all fault-tolerance region was not simply connected and exhibited gaps. In this paper we have successfully overcome the problem of gaps in the fault-tolerance envelope of the basic feedback controller by a judicious choice of feedback variables and developing a strategy for optimal gain selection to enlarge the failure tolerance envelopes {{in the presence of}} severe winds. The controller is motivated by Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion (NDI) approach and is able to handle six different types of single / double control surface failures. This is achieved by exploiting the full capability of control allocation inherent in the redundant control surfaces. The <b>autolanding</b> controller discussed in this paper is the most robust controller designed so far for the benchmark <b>autolanding</b> problem chosen for study...|$|R

Enforcing physical constraints such as loads, vertical descent rate, continuity and smoothness reduces the design problem to a two point boundary value problem with conditions on the initial and final dynamic pressure. Finding a solution required the development of trajectory simulation techniques that constrained the flight profile to a prescribed geometry. The design methodology can be extended beyond the <b>autolanding</b> flight regime by repeating the series of geometric segments and solving multiple two-point boundary values problems (one for each series).

40|$|Abstract- During landing, aircrafts {{have to face}} low-altitude {{wind shear}} that can be fatal. Most {{commercial}} aircrafts currently have optimal automatic landing systems, but they are activated only if well-specified wind speed limitations are met. The reason is that these <b>autolanding</b> systems are not designed {{to work in the}} presence of strong wind gusts. In this paper, we apply a modified version of brain emotional learning based intelligent controller (BELBIC) to the <b>autolanding</b> system whose multivariable and non-minimum phase nature make the task difficult. By comparing the results with the results derived from using a high-gain controller, we show that our proposed solution can achieve robust and satisfactory performance...|$|R
50|$|<b>Autoland</b> {{requires}} {{the use of}} a radar altimeter to determine the aircraft's height above the ground very precisely so as to initiate the landing flare at the correct height (usually about 50 ft). The localizer signal of the ILS may be used for lateral control even after touchdown until the pilot disengages the autopilot. For safety reasons, once <b>autoland</b> is engaged and the ILS signals have been acquired by the <b>autoland</b> system, it will proceed to landing without further intervention, and can be disengaged only by completely disconnecting the autopilot (this prevents accidental disengagement of the <b>autoland</b> system at a critical moment) or by initiating an automatic go-around. At least two and often three independent autopilot systems work in concert to carry out <b>autoland,</b> thus providing redundant protection against failures. Most <b>autoland</b> systems can operate with a single autopilot in an emergency, but they are only certified when multiple autopilots are available.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, several {{research}} activities {{have been developed}} {{in order to increase}} the autonomy features in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), to substitute human pilots in dangerous missions or simply in order to execute specific tasks more efficiently and cheaply. In particular, a significant research effort has been devoted to achieve high automation in the landing phase, so as to allow the landing of an aircraft without human intervention, also in presence of severe environmental disturbances. The worldwide research community agrees with the opportunity of the dual use of UAVs (for both military and civil purposes), and because of this {{it is very important to}} make the UAVs and their <b>autolanding</b> systems compliant with the present and future rules and with the procedures regarding autonomous flight in ATM (Air Traffic Management) airspace in addition to the typical military aims of minimizing fuel, space or other important parameters during each autonomous task. Developing <b>autolanding</b> systems with the desired level of reliability, accuracy and safety involves an evolution of all the subsystems related to the guide, navigation and control disciplines. The main drawbacks of the <b>autolanding</b> systems are lack of “adaptivity” to the trajectory generating and tracking process to unpredictable external events, such as varied environmental conditions and unexpected threats to avoid, or the missed compliance between the guidelines imposed by certification authorities and the technologies used to get the desired above mentioned adaptivity. During his PhD period the author contributed to the development of an autonomous approach and landing system considering all the indispensable functionalities AS mission automation logic, runway data managing, sensor fusion for optimal estimation of vehicle state, trajectory generation and tracking considering optimality criteria and health management algorithms. In particular the system addressed in this thesis is capable of performing a fully adaptive autonomous landing starting from any point of three dimensional space. The main novel feature of this algorithm is that it generates on line, with a desired updating rate or at a specified event, the nominal trajectory for the aircraft, based on the actual state of the vehicle and on the desired state at touch down point. Main features of the <b>autolanding</b> system based on the implementation of the proposed algorithm are: on line trajectory re-planning in the landing phase, fully autonomyfrom remote pilot inputs, weakly instrumented landing runway (without ILS availability), ability to land starting from any point in space and autonomous management of failures and/or adverse atmospheric conditions, decision-making logic evaluation for key-decisions regarding possible execution of altitude recovery manoeuvre based on the Differential GPS integrity signal and compatible with the functionalities made available by the future GNSS system. All the algorithms developed allow reduction of computational tractability of trajectory generation and tracking problems so as to be suitable for real time implementation but still obtaining a feasible, robust and adaptive trajectory for the UAV. All the activities related to the current study have been conducted at CIRA (Italian Aerospace Research Center) in the framework of the aeronautical TECVOL project whose aim is to develop innovative technologies for the autonomous flight. The <b>autolanding</b> system was developed by the TECVOL team and the author’s contribution to it will be outlined in the thesis. Effectiveness of proposed algorithms has been then evaluated in real flight experiments, using the aeronautical flying demonstrator available at CIRA...|$|R

5000|$|If {{a single}} failure occurs below {{decision}} height <b>AUTOLAND</b> FAULT will be displayed, however {{at that point}} the aircraft is committed to landing and the <b>autoland</b> system will remain engaged, controlling the aircraft on only two systems until the pilot completes the rollout and brings the aircraft to a full stop on the runway or turns off the runway onto a taxiway. This is termed [...] "fail active." [...] However, in this state the <b>autoland</b> system is [...] "one fault away" [...] from disengaging so the <b>AUTOLAND</b> FAULT indication should inform the flight crew to monitor the system behavior very carefully and be ready to take control immediately. The system is still fail active and is still performing all necessary cross checks so that if one of the flight control computers decides that {{the right thing to do}} is order a full deflection of a control surface, the other computer will detect that there is a difference in the commands and this will take both computers off line (fail passive) at which time the flight crew must immediately take control of the aircraft as the automatic systems have done the safe thing by taking themselves off line.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{the fault}} {{tolerant}} {{capabilities of the}} neural aided sliding mode controller for <b>autolanding</b> under actuator failures and severe winds developed earlier are improved significantly by incorporating a novel anti-windup strategy and a phase compensation scheme. This controller further increases {{the size of the}} fault tolerance envelope for various types of control surface stuck faults and provides complete coverage at every point within the envelope boundaries. Earlier work by the authors showed the existence of a neural-aided sliding mode controller which could handle a wide range of actuator stuck faults. One of the major drawbacks of this earlier controller {{is that it does not}} ensure that all points within the range of minimum and maximum bounds of the fault tolerance envelope are covered. The anti-windup proposed in this paper is a generalization of the scheme used for proportional derivative-integral controllers to the cascaded trajectory following controllers designed by the authors. This scheme can handle requirements of state limiting as well as multiple redundant control surface saturation. The proposed anti-wind up design is a simplification over the command filter approach used for adaptive backstepping. The approach is demonstrated for a fixed-wing aircraft undergoing unknown actuator stuck failures and subject to severe wind disturbances during <b>autolanding.</b> An example of three control surface failures (both ailerons and rudder) handled by this controller is also presented...|$|R

Today a similar signal is instead sent across all of North America via commercial satellites, in a system known as WAAS.

40|$|The {{automatic}} {{construction of}} controllers {{would be ideal}} in situations where traditional control theory and algorithms fail, {{as it is the}} case with certain dynamical systems. Genetic programming, a field under the "umbrella" of evolutionary computation, is capable of creating computer programs given a high level description of a problem. The evolution of such computer programs is driven by their fitness. The fitness is defined by an objective function, which measures how well a particular program performs for the specific problem that tries to solve. Any controller can be described in terms of a computer program and thus, at least in theory, genetic programming offers an ideal candidate for the automatic construction of controllers. This paper considers the application of genetic programming on two different problems: the aircraft <b>autolanding</b> problem and the bioreactor control problem, both of which have been suggested in the literature as challenging benchmarks in the quest for building automatic controllers.

The wings of the aircraft are modeled as cantilever beams undergoing bending and torsion about their elastic axis. Distributed variables are discretized in space using the Galerkin method, and unsteady aerodynamic forces are computed using strip theory and finite state induced-flow theory. A landing condition in which the elastic aircraft encounters a crosswind all the way before touchdown is considered. To design the control system, nonlinear coupled equations of motion are linearized about the trim condition and separated into two sets of decoupled equations, in which the elastic variables affect lateral-directional equations. The landing phase is divided into the final approach and flare phases and, for each phase, separate controllers are designed for longitudinal- and lateral-directional channels.
