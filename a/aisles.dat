5|$|After {{the fire}} of 1270, a {{programme}} of reconstruction was launched, with repairs and a major enlargement. Outer <b>aisles</b> {{were added to the}} nave, the eastern wing comprising the choir and presbytery was doubled in length and had <b>aisles</b> provided on its north and south sides, and the octagonal chapterhouse was built off the new north choir aisle (Figs. 8 & 9). The new northern and southern <b>aisles</b> ran the length of the choir, past the first bay of the presbytery, and contained recessed and chest tombs. The south aisle of the choir contained the tomb of bishop John of Winchester, suggesting a completion date for the reconstructed aisle between 1435 and 1460 (Fig. 10). Chapels were added to the new outer <b>aisles</b> of the nave and were partitioned from each other with wooden screens. The first bay at the west end of each of these <b>aisles</b> and adjacent to the western towers did not contain a chapel but instead had an access door for the laity.|$|E
5|$|With two exceptions, the naves {{and eastern}} {{arms of the}} cathedrals have single lower <b>aisles</b> on either side with a {{clerestory}} that illuminates the central space. At Bristol the <b>aisles</b> are {{at the same height}} as the medieval choir like some German cathedrals, and at Chichester there are two <b>aisles</b> {{on either side of the}} nave like some French cathedrals. At a number of the cathedrals where the transepts are large they also have <b>aisles,</b> either on the eastern side as at Peterborough, Durham, Lincoln and Salisbury or both, as at Winchester, Wells, Ely and York.|$|E

5|$|There are benches in {{the main}} aisle and confessionals in the side <b>aisles.</b> The confessionals {{contained}} benches until {{the closure of the}} church in 1938. After its reconstruction, the left side was reserved for women, and the right for men. Both side <b>aisles</b> are separated from the main aisle by pillar files, consisting of four columns and two half columns. The columns and the roof are painted in white, and the walls in cream. The floor is constructed from light and dark grey marble slabs in a chequered pattern.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{very fine}} mosaic floor to the centre aisle and cross <b>aisles</b> by Seddon with inset lozenge panels of Minton encaustic tiles of {{kneeling}} priests.|$|E
5|$|West fronts {{in general}} take three {{distinct}} forms: those that follow {{the elevation of}} the nave and <b>aisles,</b> those that have paired towers {{at the end of}} each aisle, framing the nave, and those that screen the form of the building. The west front at Wells has the paired-tower form, unusual in that the towers do not indicate the location of the <b>aisles,</b> but extend well beyond them, screening the dimensions and profile of the building.|$|E

25|$|In 1360, {{the west}} <b>aisle</b> {{of the south}} {{transept}} and the south <b>aisle</b> of the nave were widened, and the outer south <b>aisle</b> added. Also, at this time, the south porch and the tower were built.|$|R

5|$|Among {{the stained}} glass windows at Kirkpatrick Chapel are {{approximately}} twenty lancet windows along the chapel's side <b>aisles</b> that were donated by graduating classes {{at the turn of}} the nineteenth and twentieth centuries (1890–1912). These windows depict their class year and phrases in Ancient Greek and Latin.|$|E
5|$|Arcades of {{semi-circular}} arches {{divide the}} nave from the <b>aisles.</b> On {{the south side}} of the cathedral, a large chapel, built in 1911, extends three bays parallel to the aisle. This chapel provides a more intimate place of worship than the main church or its <b>aisles.</b> The nave has a cross vaulted ceiling with clerestory windows above the arcades. The cathedral's main neoclassical altar of translucent alabaster is a modern replacement for the original wooden gothic altar, now located in the southern side chapel. The main altar, built in Burgos, Spain, was donated by the local Ferre family. Except for the side chapel where terrazzo is used, the cathedral's floor is of gray and white marble design.|$|E
5|$|St Margaret's Church has a chancel, wide nave with {{a narrow}} {{clerestory}} above and narrow three-bay <b>aisles</b> on {{the north and south}} sides, a tall tower (topped with a spire) at the west end and a porch on the north side. The nave, chancel and chancel-arch all date from the 13th century. The <b>aisles</b> and their arcades are largely unaltered from their 14th-century origins: between them they feature various mouldings and designs typical of that period, including chamfered arches, octagonal columns and squinch corners. Many of the windows also date from that century, while others are a century later; trefoil-headed designs predominate, but there are some larger square-headed Perpendicular Gothic windows as well. Several other windows contain stained glass. The roof of the nave is tall and steeply pitched, with substantial king posts and tie-beams. It is also of medieval origin.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 17th century, a south <b>aisle</b> {{was added to}} the nave. The north <b>aisle</b> was added in 1699. The {{original}} nave and the south <b>aisle</b> were rebuilt in 1750, and iron window frames replaced the original windows in 1850.|$|R

5|$|The <b>aisles</b> of {{the choir}} {{previously}} both extended {{on either side of}} the Lady Chapel. The south aisle was shortened in about 1870 by George Gilbert Scott, and given an apsidal east end, becoming the chapel of StErasmus. The eastern end of the north aisle contains the chapel of St Werburgh.|$|E
5|$|The al-Aqsa Mosque {{has seven}} <b>aisles</b> of {{hypostyle}} naves with several additional small halls {{to the west}} and east of the southern section of the building. There are 121 stained glass windows in the mosque from the Abbasid and Fatimid eras. About a fourth of them were restored in 1924.|$|E
5000|$|The south <b>aisle</b> {{windows are}} all square-headed, {{of three or}} four lights. The details of the windows are not uniform, the west window of the south <b>aisle,</b> and the four-light window in the north <b>aisle,</b> [...] "being of better style than the rest".|$|R

50|$|The chancel and nave {{are under}} a {{continuous}} roof of blue slate. There is an <b>aisle</b> {{to the south}} under a separate gabled slate roof, with an embattled parapet and buttresses. The <b>aisle</b> is separated from the chancel by two wide arches. There is a porch {{to the south of}} the south <b>aisle.</b> A shorter <b>aisle</b> lies {{to the north of the}} church, west of the Butler Chapel.|$|R
5|$|The priory was rebuilt around 1200 on {{a larger}} scale with the Romanesque church {{demolished}} to its first course of ashlar. The construction of the new church continued through much of the 13th century. The enlarged priory had twin towers at the west end flanking a large double doorway above which was a central rose window; piped water was provided using lead pipes from the cloister, under the church to buildings or standpipes to the north or west of the priory. The main body of the church comprised a nave with two <b>aisles,</b> transepts and a choir. The <b>aisles</b> were laid with geometric coloured tiles adjoining the sandstone columns of the nave. The north aisle was divided into alcoves or private chapels where a number of people – probably local nobles and gentry – were buried. An unusual feature of the church was a well, sunk into the nave, possibly built in an effort to safeguard its water supplies.|$|E
5|$|The west front {{rises in}} three {{distinct}} stages, each clearly {{defined by a}} horizontal course. This horizontal emphasis is counteracted by six strongly projecting buttresses defining the cross-sectional divisions of nave, <b>aisles</b> and towers, and are highly decorated, each having canopied niches containing the largest statues on the façade.|$|E
5|$|Though more seats {{had been}} added to the synagogue by {{narrowing}} the <b>aisles,</b> as a result of Sparger's innovations Beth Elohim outgrew its Pearl Street building, and a new one was sought. After a three-year search, in 1885 Beth Elohim purchased the building of the Congregational Church at 305 State Street (near Hoyt) for $28,000 (today $), and moved in that year.|$|E

5|$|Chester Cathedral has an east-west axis, {{common to}} many cathedrals, with the chancel {{at the eastern}} end, and the façade to the west. The plan is cruciform, with a central tower (as is usual in English monastic churches), but is asymmetrical, having a small {{transept}} {{on the north side}} remaining from an earlier building, and an unusually large south transept. As the plan shows, the asymmetry extends to the west front, where the north tower remains from the Norman building, and the south tower is of the early 16thcentury. At the eastern end, the symmetrical arrangement of the <b>aisles</b> was lost when the end of the south aisle was demolished and rebuilt in an apsidal shape. The nave, choir and south transept have wide <b>aisles</b> on either side, and are lit by clerestory windows and large multi-light windows {{in each of the three}} cliff-like ends. To the north of the cathedral are monastic buildings, including the cloister, refectory and a rectangular chapter house. The façade of the building is abutted on the north by later buildings.|$|E
5|$|In 1149 the Crusaders, who had conquered Gaza in 1100, built {{a cathedral}} {{dedicated}} to John the Baptist atop {{the ruins of}} the church upon a decree by Baldwin III of Jerusalem. However, in William of Tyre's descriptions of grand Crusader churches, it is not mentioned. Of the Great Mosque's three <b>aisles</b> today, it is believed that portions of two of them had formed part of the Cathedral of John the Baptist.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{built as}} a prayer hall with five <b>aisles</b> and a modest central courtyard, the mosque has since been {{expanded}} multiple times with additional installations completely surrounding the original structure. Many of Egypt's rulers have shaped the art and architecture of al-Azhar, from the minarets added by the Mamluks and the gates added during Ottoman rule to more recent renovations such as the installation of a new mihrab. None of the original minarets or domes have survived, {{with some of the}} current minarets having been rebuilt several times.|$|E

[...] In 1846-47 the <b>aisle</b> and chapel were reconstructed by John Laing, and in 1870 a burial chapel was added {{to the north of the}} church. In 1883 the church was remodelled, the north <b>aisle</b> being converted to form the nave and chancel, and the former nave becoming the south <b>aisle.</b>|$|R
