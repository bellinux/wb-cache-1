The Nick Knight-directed music video was released on November 19, 2013. The video features his then-fiancée Kim Kardashian, topless, riding atop West's motorbike through Monument Valley and other landscapes. Eric Diep of XXL described it as, [...] "a confident display of love and passion with little to no narrative." [...] Spin felt that [...] "a pretty bad idea seen through so completely that it stops being a bad idea". Tom Breihan from Stereogum found the video confusing, saying [...] "it'll take <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>to</b> figure out what all's going on there". Lanre Bakare of The Guardian described it as [...] "self-indulgent, idiosyncratic and a bit weird".|$|E
500|$|... "Bedtime Story" [...] has {{frequently}} {{been cited as}} one of the songs with the most unfulfilled potential in Madonna's career, nonetheless, the song did enjoy some success, being a club [...] "favorite" [...] in the mid-1990s. It has been described as the record that foreshadowed Madonna's usage of electronic music in her later work, especially Ray of Light (1998), which according to Vicente, owes [...] "its contemplative and electronic techno rave character to 'Bedtime Story'". O'Brien wrote in Madonna: Like an Icon, that the song [...] "foreshadowed [...] move towards electronica" [...] and labelled it an [...] "embryonic moment that went a lot further on the next few albums". De Vries recalled that tackling the song [...] "seemed to set something free in Madonna. She was straining at the leash <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit,</b> <b>to</b> find some other languages to speak, and 'Bedtime Story' was an embryonic moment that went a lot further on to the next few albums." [...] In a review for the Bedtime Stories album on a whole, Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine wrote that the song was [...] "the germ that would later inspire Madonna to seek out and conquer electronica with the likes of William Orbit and Mirwais".|$|E
500|$|... "Worst Episode Ever" [...] {{was written}} by Larry Doyle and {{directed}} by Matthew Nastuk. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on February4,2001. The episode was originally called [...] "The Fiver", {{a reference to a}} scene in the episode that was eventually removed. The episode title was then changed to [...] "Worst Episode Ever", a title which the staff were amused by. According to Doyle, [...] "Worst Episode Ever" [...] is the first episode in which Comic Book Guy has a major role. Because Comic Book Guy is usually sarcastic and unfriendly, the series' staff found it hard to make the character seem likable. For example, Hank Azaria, who plays Comic Book Guy among other characters in the series, had a difficult time trying to make the character sound sincere. [...] "Comic Book Guy only ever pronounces things sarcastically", Azaria said in the DVD commentary for the episode. [...] "It was hard {{to find a way to}} sound believable and have him say sincere things. It took a lot of different takes." [...] Executive producer and former showrunner Mike Scully said, [...] "It's tough when you take a character like Comic Book Guy or Krusty or Moe, to make them suddenly sympathetic and vulnerable. You have to cheat the character <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>to</b> open them up emotionally a little more." ...|$|E

He also found {{returning}} to the stage difficult because of his long departure.

2500|$|Malfoy {{grew into}} one of the series' most popular {{characters}} due to Felton's performances and Felton quickly became synonymous with the character to many female fans, much to Rowling's dismay. [...] "I'm trying to clearly distinguish between Tom Felton, who is a good looking young boy, and Draco, who, whatever he looks like, is not a nice man. It’s a romantic, but unhealthy, and unfortunately all too common delusion of girls ... it actually worried me <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit,</b> <b>to</b> see young girls swearing undying devotion to this really imperfect character ... I mean, I understand the psychology of it, but it is pretty unhealthy." [...] Rowling has also noted that Malfoy [...] "is certainly stylish in the film." ...|$|E

Following this intersection, it passes between several small sized lakes within heavily forested areas before heading through some farm fields. Here, the road intersects CR 721 (East Central Avenue).

2500|$|There {{were also}} children's books like Gremlins 2: The New Batch: Movie Storybook, by Michael Teitelbaum, {{published}} by Goldencraft in December 1990. Little Golden Books published Gremlins 2: The New Batch: Gizmo to the Rescue in July 1990.

Buzz Books had also released other picture books that are particularly suitable for children such as Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends, Fireman Sam, TUGS, The Flintstones, The Animals of Farthing Wood, Looney Tunes, Bugs Bunny, Joshua Jones and Rupert. David Bischoff wrote a novel based on the film published by Avon Books in June 1990. A unique aspect {{of the novel is}} how Bischoff adapts the sequence where the film breaks. In the novel, the Brain Gremlin subdues and locks Bischoff in his bathroom before taking the reins for <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>to</b> explain that the Gremlins take over {{at this point in the}} film, his displeasure at Bischoff using the nickname [...] "Mr. Glasses" [...] instead of his official name, and begins a treatise on politics before Bischoff breaks his way out of the bathroom with an axe and subdues the Brain Gremlin. The novel then continues where the film picked up after the film break.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the first}} {{producers}} of the album was Guy Roche, who produced two tracks ("What a Girl Wants" [...] and [...] "I Turn to You") and co-wrote one of them ("What a Girl Wants"), along with Shelly Peiken. [...] "What a Girl Wants" [...] was later re-recorded for its single release, replacing the [...] "lighter" [...] version for a more [...] "funky" [...] R version. Peiken also re-wrote with Roche the single version for the track [...] "Come on Over", first produced by Johan Aberg, Paul Rein and Aaron Zigman. According to herself, [...] "We're {{going to give it}} more of an edge, R it up a little, maybe rock it out a little, give it a lot of different new directions and get it out there." [...] Aguilera also recorded a cover of All-4-One's song [...] "I Turn to You", written by Diane Warren. Carl Sturken and Evan Rogers (who would eventually broke into the scene as the producers who launched Rihanna's career) wrote and produced two tracks, while the then up-and-coming Robin Thicke co-wrote and co-produced [...] "When You Put Your Hands on Me". Franne Golde (who previously worked with Whitney Houston) also wrote a song for Aguilera. At the final stages, producer and songwriter David Frank presented a song called [...] "Genie in a Bottle", which Aguilera almost didn't record, [...] "because {{there were a lot of}} other artists out there that were after this song, so we had to fight <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>to</b> get it," [...] she claimed. With Heather Holley, Aguilera also co-wrote a track called [...] "I Will Be", which she said was inspired by Mariah Carey's [...] "Vanishing". Producer of the track [...] "So Emotional" [...] revealed that Aguilera in-between recordings [...] "she was only listening to Mariah Carey and Brandy, putting on her walk man and practicing their riffs and runs, before she did her ad-libs.|$|E
