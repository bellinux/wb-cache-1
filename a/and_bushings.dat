2500|$|The {{biggest change}} for the Torino was the switch to body-on-frame {{construction}} from the unit-construction of the 1971 models. The new chassis was a perimeter design {{that was used to}} help give the Torino a quieter and more isolated ride. It featured an energy absorbing [...] "S" [...] shaped front end, torque boxes to isolate road shock, fourteen rubber body mounts and five solid cross members. The front suspension used an unequal length control arm design, with a computer selected coil spring mounted on the strut stabilized lower control arm, much like the fullsize Ford LTD. The rear used the [...] "Stabul" [...] four link suspension with a computer selected coil spring mounted on a solid axle. The new suspension and chassis had a wheel track at least [...] wider than the 1971 models. [...] Motor Trend stated the [...] "road isolation and vibrational dampening is superb" [...] in its test of a 1972 Gran Torino Brougham 4-door. Ford offered two suspension options, the heavy-duty and competition suspension. The heavy-duty suspension included a larger front sway bar, and heavy-duty springs and shocks. [...] Competition suspension, only available in two-door models, included the most heavy-duty springs and shocks, heavy duty rear upper control arms <b>and</b> <b>bushings,</b> a larger front sway bar, and the addition of a rear sway bar. This was the first year that a rear sway bar was offered in the Torino and was only available with competition and police suspension options. Front disc brakes became standard on all Torinos, which no other American intermediate (other than its sister car the Mercury Montego) offered in 1972, however, power brakes remained an option. [...] The only exceptions were that power brakes were standard on the Gran Torino Squire station wagons and a mandatory option for all [...] powered models. The power steering was revised to be integral in the steering box, rather than the external booster style used in previous years. All Torinos used 14-inch wheels, while 15-inch wheels were used for exclusively by police and taxi models.|$|E
