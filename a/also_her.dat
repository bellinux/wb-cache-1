5|$|A Wizard of Earthsea {{was first}} {{published}} in 1968 by Parnassus Press in Berkeley, a year before The Left Hand of Darkness, Le Guin's watershed work. It was a personal landmark for Le Guin, as it represented her first attempt at writing for children; she had written only a handful of other novels and short stories prior to its publication. The book was <b>also</b> <b>her</b> first attempt at writing fantasy, rather than science-fiction. A Wizard of Earthsea was the first of Le Guin's books to receive widespread critical attention, and has been described as her best known work, as part of the Earthsea series. The book has been released in numerous editions, including an illustrated Folio Society edition released in 2015. It was also translated into a number of other languages. An omnibus edition of all of Le Guin's Earthsea works is planned to be released on the 50th anniversary of the publication of A Wizard of Earthsea in 2018.|$|E

When the tour was decided, Madonna appointed Jamie King as choreographer and the tour was planned in a short timespan of three months, including signing up the dancers, musicians and technicians. Designer Jean-Paul Gaultier was the costume designer who designed the costumes in such way that they indicated different phases of Madonna's career. The poster and logo for the tour included references to Kabbalah, which Madonna studied.|$|E

Six weeks later, on March 30, 2007, Kentikian made her first title defense. Before a crowd of 19,500 in the Kölnarena, she fought on the undercard of the popular exhibition bout between German comedian Stefan Raab and WIBF World Champion Regina Halmich. Kentikian beat María José Núñez from Uruguay with a third round technical knockout.

5|$|Opening across 2,602 North American theaters, The Boy Next Door was {{projected}} {{to pull in}} $12–15million over its opening weekend. The film earned $5.7million on its opening day, well over its budget. It opened at number two at the US box office, with an opening weekend gross of $14.9million, {{significantly higher than the}} other new releases for that week. The Hollywood Reporter revealed that 45 percent of the film's opening week audience was Hispanic, while 71 percent of the overall audience was female. The film became Lopez's best opening weekend for a January release, beating her romantic comedy The Wedding Planner (2001) which opened with $13.5million. It was <b>also</b> <b>her</b> best opening weekend for a thriller film, ahead of Angel Eyes (2001, $9.2million), Enough (2002, $14million), and Parker (2013, $7million). Furthermore, it is Lopez's biggest live-action opening since 2005's Monster-in-Law.

5|$|Several of {{the large}} runestones in Scandinavia notify of an inheritance, such as the Hillersjö stone, which {{explains}} how a lady came to inherit the property of not only her children but <b>also</b> <b>her</b> grandchildren and the Högby Runestone, which tells that a girl was the sole heir {{after the death of}} all her uncles. They are important proprietary documents from a time when legal decisions were not yet put to paper. One interpretation of the Tune Runestone from Østfold suggests that the long runic inscription deals with the funeral ale in honor of the master of a household and that it declares three daughters to be the rightful heirs. It is dated to the 5th century and is, consequently, the oldest legal document from Scandinavia that addresses a female's right to inheritance.|$|E

5|$|The Order {{remained}} in collateral {{branches of the}} family of the Dukes of Jülich and Berg until 1521, when the male line holding the two duchies and the county of Ravensberg became extinct. A daughter, Maria von Geldern, remained to inherit the duchies and the county, but, under the Salic law practiced in the northwestern German states, women could only hold property through a husband or guardian. Consequently, the territories passed to her husband—who was <b>also</b> <b>her</b> distant relative—John III, Duke of Cleves and Mark. The couple had three daughters, one of whom, Ann of Cleves, married Henry VIII of England in 1540, and one son, Wilhelm, who subsequently inherited the duchies and the administration of the Order. The duchies included most of the present-day North Rhine-Westphalia that lay outside the ecclesiastical territories of the Electorate of Cologne and Münster. Wilhelm was known as Wilhelm the Rich.|$|E
5|$|The {{provisional}} favourite for the women's {{race was}} Kenyan runner Florence Kiplagat, {{who was the}} fastest entrant in the field through her win at the Lille Half Marathon in September (<b>also</b> <b>her</b> debut for the distance). Her compatriots Peninah Arusei and Sarah Chepchirchir – second and third in Lille – completed the strongest three of the Kenyan women's team, which was considered {{the team to beat}} for the title. The Ethiopians, led by Boston Marathon winner Dire Tune, were their main opposition for the team race, although the nation had sent relatively inexperienced runners to the championships on this occasion. China's leading athlete was Zhu Xiaolin, who despite being an established marathon runner had less experience over the half distance. Although Japan lacked a leading figure individually, their overall consistency (which had brought them team medals in the last five editions) demonstrated their team pedigree. Kenya entered the tournament as the reigning team champions.|$|E

5|$|Around {{the same}} time, Jayanthi (Andrea Jeremiah) arrives in Kochi from Mumbai {{in search of}} her missing husband, Ramesh (Ashvin Mathew), an Indian Revenue Service officer who {{frequently}} disappeared from home for various reasons, but is now {{a suspect in the}} gold smuggling. Jayanthi arranged for a taxi to drive her to various locations in her quest to find Ramesh. The taxi driver Raju (Mohanlal) appears to have an interest of his own in the circumstances surrounding Ramesh's disappearance. At Jayanthi's bidding, Raju drives her to the home of her mother-in-law (KPAC Lalitha) where he cooks for them and interacts in such a way to earn their trust. Jayanthi then asks Raju to drive her to Kochi to the office of her friend, Chandrasekharan (Vijayaraghavan), assistant commissioner of police. Chandrasekharan promises Jayanthi he will investigate the disappearance of Ramesh. After leaving Chandrasekharan's office, Raju drives Jayanthi to see Chandrasekharan's wife, Advocate Rekha (Muthumany), who is <b>also</b> <b>her</b> friend. During their chat, Jayanthi receives a surprise phone call from Ramesh. He explains that he is in Kovalam for an official meeting but will return home the next day, and insists that Jayanthi return home as well. Chandrasekharan later informs Jayanthi that the phone number Ramesh called from was actually in Kochi, not Kovalam. It is also revealed that Sudheer, Ramesh's brother is involved in the smuggling operation.|$|E
5|$|Ranavalona {{maintained}} {{the tradition of}} ruling {{with the support of}} advisers drawn largely from the aristocratic class. The queen's most powerful ministers were <b>also</b> <b>her</b> consorts. Her first chief adviser was a young army officer from Namehana named Andriamihaja, who served as First Minister from 1829 to 1830. Major-General Andriamihaja most likely fathered the queen's only son, Prince Rakoto (later King Radama II), who was born eleven months {{after the death of his}} official father, King Radama I. In the early years of Ranavalona's reign, Andriamihaja was the leader of her court's progressive faction, who favored maintaining the relations with Europe initiated under Radama. The conservative faction was led by the brothers Rainimaharo and Rainiharo, the latter being the official guardian of one of the most powerful royal sampy. These talismans were believed to embody and channel the supernatural powers of the kingship and had played a major role in the spiritual life of the Merina people since at least the 16th century reign of Ralambo. The conservative faction conspired to reduce Andriamahaja's progressive influence over the queen, and in September 1830 they managed to persuade her while highly intoxicated to sign his death warrant for charges of witchcraft and treason. He was immediately captured in his home and killed.|$|E
