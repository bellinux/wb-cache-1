5|$|In {{addition}} to proposing that circumcision {{was taken up}} by the Israelites purely <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>religious</b> mandate, scholars have suggested that Judaism's patriarchs and their followers adopted circumcision to make penile hygiene easier in hot, sandy climates; as a rite of passage into adulthood; or as a form of blood sacrifice.|$|E

5|$|Abd al-Rahman quietly {{began to}} regroup the Ansar <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>religious</b> sect. Until 1914, {{he lived in}} {{seclusion}} in Omdurman or on Aba Island, closely watched by Slatin's intelligence agents. Despite the surveillance he built considerable influence in the White Nile region. He often visited the many mosques in Omdurman to meet his followers with his face covered so {{he would not be}} recognized by government agents. He received many visitors who sought his blessing.|$|E
5|$|After the Dissolution of the Monasteries, and {{the closure}} of Vale Royal Abbey in 1538, St Padarn's Church regained its independence, though now solely as a parish church rather than <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>religious</b> community. The church {{remained}} important {{in part because the}} parish was {{one of the largest in}} Wales (over 240 square miles). However, although the Abbot of Vale Royal was no longer rector, the church did not recover the tithes, nor the ownership of the lands that had once belonged to the church.|$|E

5|$|Agnes Mary Mansour (April 10, 1931 – December 17, 2004) was an American Roman Catholic nun who {{was given}} a choice from the Vatican in 1983 to end her {{religious}} vows or to resign from her position {{as the director of}} the Michigan Department of Social Services which required her to support and allocate public funding for abortions. The controversy involved her belief that abortion was tragic but should be legal, despite her vows <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>religious</b> and the teachings of the Catholic Church.|$|E
5|$|In August and September 1940 the Congress became {{split between}} Ansar and Khatmiyya supporters. At first the Ansar were dominant, but they lost this {{position}} {{by the end}} of 1942. Many of Abd al-Rahman's supporters saw him as a source of financial backing and admired his advocacy of an independent Sudan, but did not follow him <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>religious</b> leader and were not members of the Ansar movement. By the end of 1942 the government had decided the Congress had no political value. The Mahdists had split into rival camps, other factions had emerged, and the attendees {{at the annual meeting of}} the Congress included artisans, merchants and illiterates.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, {{the site}} {{began to be}} used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>religious</b> {{retirement}} community by elderly Lhasans, who constructed small huts {{in which they could}} live out the final years of their lives in intensive Buddhist practice. Nuns began to renovate the site in the 1980s and founded the modern nunnery, as it is seen today, in 1984, and has since grown into one of the largest nunneries in the Lhasa Valley. However, somewhat unusually, the houses are owned individually by the nuns, but the nunnery has an administrative body and a site for communal gathering.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} years in western Virginia, pioneer {{settlers}} were primarily concerned with providing defense from Native American attacks, so little emphasis was placed upon education. Education was viewed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>religious</b> duty, {{to be provided for}} at home, where its quality was dependent upon the spare time and level of education of parents. With the growth of settlement in Pearsall's Flats, and later Romney, the need for educational facilities became apparent and the community began plans for the establishment of schools and churches.|$|E
5|$|Manchester Cathedral {{began as}} a parish church and was re-founded <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>religious</b> college in 1422, much of its {{structure}} being designed by John Wastell (1485 to 1506). It is very different in style from the earlier great churches, sometimes being listed with the 13 Anglican 'parish-church cathedrals'. Double aisles give it the widest nave of any English cathedral (115feet); and {{it also has the}} richest set of late medieval choir stalls and misericords in the country.|$|E
5|$|Mírzá Yahyá's {{leadership}} was controversial. He generally absented {{himself from the}} Bábí community, spending his time in Baghdad in hiding and disguise; on several occasions he {{went so far as}} to publicly disavow allegiance to the Báb. Mírzá Yahyá gradually alienated himself from a large number of the Bábís, who started giving their allegiance to other claimants. During the time that Mírzá Yahyá remained in hiding, Bahá'u'lláh performed much of the daily administration of Bábí affairs. In contrast to Mírzá Yahyá, Bahá'u'lláh was outgoing and accessible and he was seen by an increasing number of Bábís <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>religious</b> leader, rather than just an organizer, and became their center of devotion.|$|E

5|$|On May 18, 1997 (a {{day after}} Flores' 35th wedding anniversary), in a {{follow-up}} report on Televisa, a handful of women {{claimed to have been}} sexually abused by Flores approximately twenty years earlier. In a third report on August 17, shortly after the church's most significant holiday, former member Moisés Padilla Íñiguez also accused Flores of sexually abusing him when he was a teenager. These accusations were spearheaded by Erdely's anti-cult group, which demanded that La Luz del Mundo be stripped of its legal recognition <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>religious</b> organization. Four people later filed formal complaints with the state prosecutor, but the statute of limitations for the alleged crimes had passed.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the first}} part was completed, Smederevo Fortress quickly became an {{important}} connection between the Balkans and central Europe. Shortly after it was built, the city reached its peak importance <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>religious,</b> commercial, and trade center, at which point it was populated mainly by Serbs and colonies of merchants, primarily from Dubrovnik. Around the same time, the relics of Saint Luke the Evangelist, who became {{the patron saint of}} Smederevo, were brought and stored in the church in the fortress.|$|E
5|$|Smart's {{two most}} widely known works are A Song to David and Jubilate Agno, both {{at least partly}} written during his {{confinement}} in asylum. However, Jubilate Agno was not published until 1939 and A Song to David received mixed reviews until the 19th century. To his contemporaries, Smart was known mainly for his many contributions in the journals The Midwife and The Student, along with his famous Seaton Prize poems and his mock epic The Hilliad. Although he is primarily recognised <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>religious</b> poet, his poetry includes various other themes, such as his theories on nature and his promotion of English nationalism.|$|E

5|$|Whistler {{created the}} {{painting}} {{in the winter of}} 1861–62, though he later returned to it and made alterations. It was rejected both at the Royal Academy and at the Salon in Paris, but eventually accepted at the Salon des Refusés in 1863. This exhibition also featured Édouard Manet's famous Déjeuner sur l'herbe, and together the two works gained a lot of attention. The White Girl shows clearly the influence of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, with whom Whistler had recently come in contact. The painting has been interpreted by later art critics both as an allegory of innocence and its loss, and <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>religious</b> allusion to the Virgin Mary.|$|E
5|$|Domitian also {{revived the}} {{practice}} of the imperial cult, which had fallen somewhat out of use under Vespasian. Significantly, his first act as an Emperor was the deification of his brother Titus. Upon their deaths, his infant son, and niece, Julia Flavia, were likewise enrolled among the gods. With regards to the emperor himself <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>religious</b> figure, both Suetonius and Cassius Dio allege that Domitian officially gave himself the title of Dominus et Deus. However, not only did he reject the title of Dominus during his reign, but since he issued no official documentation or coinage to this effect, historians such as Brian Jones contend that such phrases were addressed to Domitian by flatterers who wished to earn favors from the emperor.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{accession}} of Henry I's successor, King Stephen, Nigel {{remained as}} treasurer only briefly before {{his family was}} ousted from political office by the new king. Nigel rebelled and deserted to Stephen's rival Matilda, but eventually reconciled with Stephen. Although he subsequently held some minor administrative posts, he never regained high office under Stephen. On the king's death, Nigel was returned to the treasurership by the new king, Henry II. Nigel's second tenure as treasurer saw him return the administration to the practices of Henry I. He withdrew from much of his public work after around 1164, following an attack of paralysis. He was succeeded as treasurer by his son, Richard fitzNeal, whom he had trained in {{the operations of the}} Exchequer, or Treasury of England. Most historians, then and now, have felt that Nigel's administrative abilities were excellent; he is considered to have been more talented as an administrator than <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>religious</b> figure.|$|E
