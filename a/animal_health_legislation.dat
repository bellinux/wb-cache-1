40|$|Social {{capital is}} about {{relationships}} {{that are often}} based on earned or inherited kernels of commonality. Social capital raises the ethical question of when relationships {{should be allowed to}} influence outcomes. The essential theory underlying the social capital paradigm is that relationships of sympathy or social capital influence almost every interpersonal transaction. Since interpersonal transactions occur in many settings, the study of social capital is multi-disciplinary and interested in such diverse topics as charitable giving, leadership development, educational achievements, migration patterns, formation of cooperatives, how people care for the environment, diffusion of technology, advertising, economic development, family integrity, flow of legal, recreational, and health services, management of organizations, community development, <b>animal</b> <b>health,</b> passage of <b>legislation,</b> and the creation of civil society.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to make a {{retrospective}} analysis of the legal framework in the field of veterinary and sanitary control of raw milk and dairy products for the period 1947 - 2013. The reasons leading to the transformation of <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> <b>legislation</b> in the control of raw milk and dairy products in four periods of socio-economic development of Bulgaria are briefly discussed. These are the period of central planning - 1947 - 1989, the period of transition to a market economy - 1990 - 2000, pre-accession period 2000 - 2007 and the period of membership – after 2007. In operational order an analysis of the acting laws and regulatory documents during these periods is made, as well as their impact on official controls of raw milk and dairy products. Detailed description of the negotiation process in the field of veterinary issues and in particular the harmonization of Bulgarian legislation with the EU commitments is made and its application done by the competent authorities, milk producers and processors. In addition, the role of NVS in the regulatory transposition process and implementation of the newly transposed legislation and the restructuring of the Bulgarian dairy business in implementing the requirements of the transposed legislation in the dairy sector is described...|$|E
40|$|As it {{currently}} stands, {{the management of}} the bottom mussel aquaculture in Ireland is a complex process that is governed by three overriding factors; these are; 1) Government policy and regulation, 2) industry and economics and 3) Science and biology. These three factors are influenced by a range of different issues that influence the implementation of resource management either individually or in combination and include, inter alia, aquaculture licensing, carrying capacity, company structure and operating practices, <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> <b>legislation,</b> vessel registration and licensing and North/South agreements, prevailing weather conditions and uncertainty of seed supply. The mussel seed fishery in the Irish Sea, as the primary source of seed, is integral to the continued viability of the bottom mussel sector in Ireland. This report is the outcome of a project initiated over concerns raised regarding the sustainability of the fishery. A goal of this project is to develop and implement a science based management system for the sustainable exploitation of seed mussels in the Irish Sea. A specific goal of the project was to identify environmental drivers governing the distribution and abundance of the seed mussel resources in the Irish Sea. A number of outputs were expected from this project: 1. A literature search and review of existing biological, fisheries, survey and hydrographic data. 2. Studies to estimate adult reproductive cycles and spatfall patterns. 3. Hydrographic models of targeted areas of high mussel population. These models allow for behavioural characteristics of the larval swimming phases. 4. Draft a management strategy to detail the optimum manner in which to effect the sustainable exploitation of the resource, including the hatchery option. This report addresses the final workpackage above, wherein a series of recommendations encompassing both management and research aspects, based upon the scientific outputs of the project, are presented.

40|$|The {{historical}} evolution of veterinary services in South Africa is {{closely linked to}} the colonial history of the past and the eventual political formation of the Union of South Africa in 1910, as well as the establishment of a fully democratic South Africa in 1994. The majority of the early pioneering veterinarians had close links to military activities and were originally mostly of British origin. The appointment of the first colonial chief veterinary officers occurred in the late 1800 s. These appointments were dictated by the need to combat devastating animal diseases, such as rinderpest and African horse sickness, mainly because they affected draught oxen (used for travel) and horses (used in combat). Veterinary field services was established in 1962 as a separate functional entity within government services when M. C. Lambrechts became Director of Veterinary Services of South Africa. In the context of this article, veterinary field services refers to that sphere of veterinary service delivery conducted by government-appointed or seconded veterinarians applying disease control and prevention, as required by <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> <b>legislation.</b> Paging through the history of veterinary field services in South Africa confirms that the problems faced by the veterinary services of today were just as real during the times of our pioneers. The pioneers of veterinary services transformed unknown animal diseases into textbook descriptions still used today and also demonstrated the important link to, and use of, the observations made by farmers, as well as the need for continued basic and applied research on animal diseases. This article provided a brief overview of the evolution of veterinary field services and the important role played by pioneers over the last two centuries to make South Africa relatively free and safe from the most important trade-sensitive and economically important animal diseases...|$|E

40|$|The South African {{food safety}} and animal food control systems are {{developed}} and enforced by three government departments: Department of Health (DOH), Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) and Department of Trade and Industry (DTI). Animal health relies heavily on veterinary drugs for controlling pests and diseases. Movement of animals and animal products, is also a potential method of transmission of pests and diseases within and between countries. Human health is inextricably linked to animal health and production through zoonotic and foodborne hazards. By eating animal products (meat, milk, eggs, etc.), humans are exposed to microbiological hazards and chemical residues. This paper will describe and critically review the relevant legislation and regulations {{as well as their}} implementation, highlighting discrepancies and overlaps. Four working groups of eight key informants performed a gap analysis and defined actions and steps to remedy the gaps for: 1) Legislation for the registration for veterinary drugs and pesticides in animal feeds; 2) <b>Animal</b> <b>health</b> <b>legislation,</b> including veterinary public health, biosecurity and animal diseases; 3) Microbiological hazards and chemical residues in food of animal origin; and 4) Laboratory capacity for residues and animal diseases surveillance and monitoring. There is a shortage of academic institutions devoted to teach applied regulatory toxicology and aquatic animal health. Furthermore, due to duplication of activities from two authorities regulating the registration of veterinary medicines and stock remedies, there is poor utilization of scare skills for surveillance, monitoring and evaluators responsible for human food safety evaluation of drugs intended for food animals. Food safety of animal products is fragmented as a result of it not being under only one Ministry. Different aspects of legislations fall under the three departments. Lines of responsibility are not always well understood as they sometimes overlap and inconsistently applied. There are also a number of stakeholders involved at local, regional and international level. International standards in line with Codex, World Trade Organization (WTO) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), are followed, in line with international obligations. National governments and private sector standards are applied by producers and processors of animal derived food. At local level there are provincial and municipal regulations for implementation of National directives, as well as private standards of supermarkets, butchers, dairies and other retailers of animal derived foods. In conclusion, South Africa needs to have one broad veterinary legislation which covers animal disease control, registration and control of veterinary drugs (including insecticides manufactured for administration to animals), food safety including food protection, prevention and elimination of zoonoses and aspects of laboratory animal facilities and diagnostic laboratories, health education and extension...|$|E

Websites and online databases which offer agricultural information {{were included in the}} analysis, but the main focus was on research, education and extension information in the core areas of <b>animal</b> <b>health.</b> Content analysis method was used to determine what agricultural academic indexing and abstracting databases have in terms of quality researched <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> information published from Africa or about Africa. Well-known databases, such as AGRICOLA, AGRIS, CAB Direct, PUBMED and Cochrane Library were investigated. The criteria used to determine the African <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> information included the content of research <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> information available on the website, {{how easy it is to}} locate information once the site has been located, the usefulness of the information, and how current and up-to-date the information is. It was found that the representation of African <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> information on the web is generally low. The poor coverage of <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> information on the web emanates from many factors: poor ICT (Information Communications Technology) infrastructure in many African countries, lack of ICT literacy, awareness and mindset, lack of recognition of all the values of information services, poor state of African indexing and abstracting services, inadequate funds, and perceived misconceptions of actual causes of the problem.

40|$|The {{way that}} an {{economist}} and an <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> professional use economics differs and creates frustrations. The economist is {{in search of}} optimizing resource allocation {{in the management of}} <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> and disease problems with metrics associated with the productivity of key societal resources of labour and capital. The <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> professional have a strong belief that productivity can be improved with the removal of pathogens. These differences restrict how well economics is used in <b>animal</b> <b>health,</b> and the question posed is whether this matters. The paper explores the question by looking at the changing role of animals in society and the associated change of the <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> professional's activities. It then questions if the current allocation of scarce resources for <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> are adequately allocated for societies and whether currently available data are sufficient for good allocation. A rapid review of the data on disease impacts - production losses and costs of human reaction - indicate that the data are sparse collected in different times and geographical regions.
