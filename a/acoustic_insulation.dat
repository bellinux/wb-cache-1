40|$|Unreinforced masonry (URM) is {{considered}} one of the oldest construction materials being until the end of XIXth century, the basic material for: foundations, walls, columns, volts, staircases, floor joints, roofs, retaining walls, drainage channels, barrages, etc. Construction with URM elements posses a series of advantages such as: fire resistance, thermal an <b>acoustic</b> <b>insulations</b> between interior and outside spaces, humidity resistance. However the URM elements have some significant inconveniences such as: large self weight (heaviness causes cracks in the other elements of structures), reduced mechanical strengths in comparison with other traditional materials (steel and concrete), low tenacity, great manual labor consumptions, and vulnerability to earthquakes. Various factors cause deteriorations which must be overcome by strengthening solutions. Some strengthening solutions based on fiber reinforced polymers (FRP) products applied directly on URM brick walls are presented in the paper...|$|R

40|$|NoThis study {{presents}} the data elements {{to develop a}} new processing route to transform elastomeric waste residue (particulates) into <b>acoustic</b> and thermal <b>insulation</b> materials that can compete with commercial products. The approach is to bind these grain and fibre particulates with a foaming polyurethane or a similar polymer, the chemistry of which can be manipulated to control the structure stiffness and the evolution of the foaming gas into open or closed cells. Here the study uses two examples of such residues, tyre and carpet shreds both composed of fibres trapping grains of either rubber or PVC. Compounds were made from these systems with different PU binders and the structural properties (density, porosity, air flow resistivity, tortuosity and stiffness) and performance properties (sound absorption, sound transmission, impact sound insulation and thermal conductivity) were measured as a function of binder loading and chemistry. The data obtained show clearly that performance can be tailored by tailoring structural properties resulting with materials that match or even outperform commercial products. The data set obtained here can be usefully exploited with available <b>acoustic</b> and thermal <b>insulation</b> materials model to take the approach further and extended to other waste systems.
