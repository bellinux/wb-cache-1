40|$|The {{opposition}} procedure in Australian patent law permits third parties {{to challenge the}} validity or scope of a patent application before the patent is granted. There have been suggestions, {{in the interests of}} harmonisation with other jurisdictions that the system should change so that the challenge is available after the grant of the patent. This article explores the purposes of the {{opposition procedure}} through a consideration of it in terms of the patent examination procedure, <b>actions</b> <b>for</b> <b>revocation</b> of patents and the principles that underpin the system as a whole. It is after a more complete understanding is achieved that attention is paid to three areas of potential reform - limiting the opposition procedure to an ex parte one (in order to reduce delays); removing the responsibility from the Patent Office; and the possibility of instituting a post-grant opposition procedure...|$|R

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{an effective}} <b>revocation</b> scheme <b>for</b> disconnected Delay Tolerant Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs). Malicious vehicles can exhibit various misbehaviour such as dropping packets due to selfish reasons. Selfishness can {{be due to}} the need to conserve limited resources such as energy and bandwidth. This forces vehicles to either drop all or some of the packets they receive. This is particularly obtainable in multi-hop forwarding networks where packets are routed from one vehicle to another towards their destination. When some packets are dropped, the usefulness of the system is not fully realised since it affects the quality of information available to vehicles for making driving decisions such as road manoeuvres. Additionally, packet dropping can degrade the routing efficiency of the system. In extreme cases of misbehaviour, it is important to stop such vehicles from further participation in network communication. One way of achieving this is through revocation. However, it is important to establish mechanisms for identifying such vehicles before blacklisting them <b>for</b> <b>revocation.</b> Our objective here is to address the question of how much we can use a trust-based scheme where vehicles cannot always be expected to follow normal protocols <b>for</b> <b>revocation.</b> Revocation or suspension of misbehaving vehicles is essential to avoid havoc and possible economic damage...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Providing an {{efficient}} <b>revocation</b> mechanism <b>for</b> attribute-based encryption (ABE) {{is of utmost}} importance since over time an user’s credentials may be revealed or expired. All previously known revocable ABE (RABE) constructions (a) essentially utilize the complete subtree (CS) scheme <b>for</b> <b>revocation</b> purpose, (b) are bounded {{in the sense that}} the size of the public parameters depends linearly on the size of the attribute universe and logarithmically on the number of users in the system, and (c) are either selectively secure, which seems unrealistic in a dynamic system such as RABE, or fully secure but built in a composite order bilinear group setting, which is undesirable from the point of view of both efficiency and security. This paper presents the first fully secure unbounded RABE using subset difference (SD) mechanism <b>for</b> <b>revocation</b> which greatly improves the broadcast efficiency compared to the CS scheme. Our RABE scheme is built on a prime order bilinear group setting resulting in practical computation cost, and its security depends on the Decisional Linear assumption...|$|R
