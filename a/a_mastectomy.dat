5|$|Bellette and Haefliger {{lived and}} worked {{for the rest of}} their lives in Majorca, with {{periodic}} trips to Italy. Friends such as artists Jeffrey Smart and John Olsen visited them regularly in Europe. An injury to her wrist meant that paintings prepared in 1976 for a solo exhibition were her last. Haefliger died in March 1982; Bellette survived breast cancer and <b>a</b> <b>mastectomy</b> in 1986 and died on 16 March 1991.|$|E
5|$|Keene {{had been}} {{persistent}} in her efforts. In 1985 she broke her leg, {{but managed to}} keep to the feeding schedule even on crutches. In the winter of 1994 {{she was diagnosed with}} breast cancer and on her doctor's advice underwent <b>a</b> <b>mastectomy.</b> She hired a friend to conduct feeding operations in her absence, but was back to do it herself three days after surgery.|$|E
5|$|Underwire bras, {{like other}} constrictive garments, may {{contribute}} to clogged milk ducts in lactating women. Fluctuating breast size during pregnancy poses another problem. Because underwire bras are rigid, they do not easily accommodate changes in breast size, and an ill-fitting bra that {{does not support the}} breasts correctly can cause discomfort and pain. For several days after <b>a</b> <b>mastectomy,</b> or as long as the breast is tender, a woman is advised not to use an underwire bra.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: <b>A</b> {{subcutaneous}} <b>mastectomy</b> {{has been}} proven to be oncologically safe for early breast cancer. Although <b>a</b> subcutaneous <b>mastectomy</b> and reconstruction are well es-tablished, most incisions are made directly on the breast. To improve the cosmetic outcome, <b>an</b> endoscopic subcuta-neous <b>mastectomy</b> and immediate reconstruction was un-dertaken, which can be performed through minimal axillary and periareolar semicircular incisions...|$|R
50|$|The {{procedure}} is a surgical option {{for individuals who}} {{are at high risk}} for the development of breast cancer. Women who had <b>a</b> bilateral <b>mastectomy</b> in 2013 were about 10 years younger than those who had <b>a</b> unilateral <b>mastectomy.</b>|$|R
50|$|She was {{a breast}} cancer survivor, having {{undergone}} <b>a</b> double <b>mastectomy</b> in 1974, two weeks after Betty Ford, then First Lady of the United States, underwent <b>a</b> single <b>mastectomy.</b> Happy Rockefeller died following a short illness on May 19, 2015, {{at the age of}} 88.|$|R
5|$|By 1960, Carson {{had more}} than enough {{research}} material, and the writing was progressing rapidly. In addition to the thorough literature search, she had investigated hundreds of individual incidents of pesticide exposure and the human sickness and ecological damage that resulted. However, in January, a duodenal ulcer followed by several infections kept her bedridden for weeks, greatly delaying the completion of Silent Spring. As she was nearing full recovery in March (just as she was completing drafts of the two cancer chapters of her book), she discovered cysts in her left breast, one of which necessitated <b>a</b> <b>mastectomy.</b> Though her doctor described the procedure as precautionary and recommended no further treatment, by December Carson discovered that the tumor was in fact malignant and the cancer had metastasized. Her research was also delayed by revision work for a new edition of The Sea Around Us, and by a collaborative photo essay with Erich Hartmann. Most of the research and writing {{was done by the}} fall of 1960, except for the discussion of recent research on biological controls and investigations of a handful of new pesticides. However, further health troubles slowed the final revisions in 1961 and early 1962.|$|E
5|$|Peggy starts dating {{businessman}} George Palmer (Paul Moriarty), {{unaware that}} he is a criminal involved in illegal money laundering. She instigates a hate campaign against local resident Mark Fowler (Todd Carty) when she discovers he is HIV positive and begins a feud with his mother Pauline (Wendy Richard). Peggy later realises she was wrong when she is diagnosed with breast cancer. She initially refuses surgery and ends things with George, fearing that he {{will not be able to}} handle her illness. However, supported by George and her family, she eventually has a lumpectomy. Peggy and George get engaged but their relationship ends when Phil reveals his criminal nature. Peggy goes on to date local car lot owner, Frank Butcher (Mike Reid), and they become engaged. Peggy has doubts about the wedding when her cancer returns and she has to have <b>a</b> <b>mastectomy,</b> but eventually decides to go through with it. Tension develops between Peggy and Phil when Grant leaves for Rio de Janeiro after a violent fight with his brother. To spite Peggy, Phil sells Grant's share in the pub to local businessman Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass) for £5. Peggy loathes Dan, and the two frequently row over the running of the pub. Eventually, she and Phil call a truce and force Dan out of Walford. Peggy discovers Frank is planning to leave her for his ex-wife, Pat (Pam St. Clement), so she shames them by reading Frank's Dear Jane letter to the entire pub and then slaps them both. She throws Frank out and he leaves Walford. Afterwards, Peggy becomes depressed and begins to rely heavily on tranquillisers. When Frank's daughter, Janine (Charlie Brooks), taunts her on Christmas Day about her father moving on, Peggy begins drinking heavily and smashes up the pub with a baseball bat. The next year, Peggy is forced to sell the pub as Frank left her in debt, and is furious to discover the new owner is Sharon.|$|E
25|$|Some {{other common}} {{reconstructive}} surgical procedures include breast reconstruction after <b>a</b> <b>mastectomy</b> {{for the treatment}} of cancer, cleft lip and palate surgery, contracture surgery for burn survivors, and creating a new outer ear when one is congenitally absent.|$|E
40|$|This study {{compares the}} results of {{modified}} radical mastectomy (144 cases) to radical mastectomy (188 cases) {{in the treatment of}} operable breast cancer. Two hundred five patients had Stage I breast cancer, 60 had Stage II disease and 67 had Stage III disease (TNM System). There was no statistically significant difference in five year survival when {{the results of}} <b>a</b> radical <b>mastectomy</b> were compared to <b>a</b> modified radical <b>mastectomy</b> at any stage of disease. There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of local recurrence in patients with Stage I and Stage II disease when the results of <b>a</b> radical <b>mastectomy</b> were compared to modified radical mastectomy. Those patients with Stage III disease who were treated by <b>a</b> modified radical <b>mastectomy</b> had <b>a</b> statistically significant higher incidence of local recurrence (chest wall and axilla) in comparison to patients treated by radical mastectomy. We have concluded that <b>a</b> modified radical <b>mastectomy</b> is the treatment of choice in patients with Stage I and Stage II diseases. In patients with Stage III disease, <b>a</b> radical <b>mastectomy</b> provides <b>a</b> better chance of local control of the disease but offers no increased chance of survival...|$|R
50|$|Undergoing <b>a</b> {{preventive}} <b>mastectomy</b> {{does not}} guarantee that breast cancer will not develop later, however, it reduces the risk by 90% in high risk women. Also, <b>a</b> preventive <b>mastectomy</b> {{may not be able}} to remove all breast tissue as some of it may be in the arm pit, near the collar bone, or in the abdominal wall.|$|R
50|$|In 1971, Bel Geddes {{underwent}} <b>a</b> radical <b>mastectomy,</b> <b>an</b> {{experience that}} she relived while playing Miss Ellie in the 1979-80 season of Dallas. The performance garnered her the Emmy Award. She was also honored by former First Lady, Betty Ford, {{for helping to}} raise breast cancer awareness.|$|R
25|$|In 1955, Alice {{fell and}} {{suffered}} a broken hip. In 1956, {{she was diagnosed}} with breast cancer, and though she successfully underwent <b>a</b> <b>mastectomy</b> at the time, cancer was found in her other breast in 1970, requiring a second mastectomy.|$|E
25|$|Surgery is {{the primary}} {{management}} for breast cancer. Depending on staging and biologic characteristics of the tumor, surgery can be a lumpectomy (removal of the lump only), <b>a</b> <b>mastectomy,</b> or a modified radical mastectomy. Lymph nodes are often included in the scope of breast tumor removal. Surgery can be performed before or after receiving systemic therapy.|$|E
25|$|Lumpectomy {{techniques}} are increasingly utilized for breast-conservation cancer surgery. Studies indicate that {{for patients with}} a single tumor smaller than 4cm, a lumpectomy with negative surgical margins may {{be as effective as}} <b>a</b> <b>mastectomy.</b> Prior to a lumpectomy, a needle-localization of the lesion with placement of a guidewire may be performed, sometimes by an interventional radiologist if the area being removed was detected by mammography or ultrasound, and sometimes by the surgeon if the lesion can be directly palpated.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> {{preventive}} <b>mastectomy</b> carries certain risks {{including those}} of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, disfiguration, anxiety and disappointment.|$|R

25|$|She {{sent her}} first-person {{account of this}} {{experience}} months later to her sister Esther without rereading it, and it {{remains one of the}} most compelling early accounts of <b>a</b> <b>mastectomy.</b> It is impossible to know today whether the breast removed was indeed cancerous or whether she suffered from mastopathy. She survived and returned to England in 1812 to visit her ailing father and to avoid young Alexander's conscription into the French army, while still in recovery from her own illness.|$|E
25|$|A {{recurring}} storyline {{for many}} years was Lisa Moore's battle with breast cancer. She first dealt with it when she was diagnosed in 1999. Soon after, she learned that Holly Budd was also a breast cancer survivor. After going through chemotherapy and <b>a</b> <b>mastectomy,</b> Lisa's cancer went into remission. Lisa would later use her law practice to defend a client who was wrongfully fired from her job due to disability, and still later, a client unjustly charged with selling pornographic comic books to children.|$|E
25|$|In 1983, after {{filming the}} pilot episode for the {{television}} series Hotel, Davis {{was diagnosed with}} breast cancer and underwent <b>a</b> <b>mastectomy.</b> Within two weeks of her surgery, she suffered four strokes which caused paralysis in the left side of her face and in her left arm, and left her with slurred speech. She commenced a lengthy period of physical therapy, and aided by her personal assistant, Kathryn Sermak, gained partial recovery from the paralysis. Even late in life, Davis smoked 100 cigarettes a day.|$|E
50|$|When Carol is due {{to undergo}} her mastectomy, Bianca persuades her to only have <b>a</b> single <b>mastectomy.</b> Bianca reveals that the family are in debt, so Carol goes {{back to work and}} sells some of her and her family's possessions. Carol confides in her {{colleague}} Tina Carter (Luisa Bradshaw-White) about her money problems, and Tina proposes that they sell marijuana. Carol is appalled but later accepts the proposal because of the debt. Carol and Bianca then attend Sonia's health class, where many of the locals try to persuade Carol to have <b>a</b> double <b>mastectomy.</b> This infuriates Carol, but after talking to Pam Coker (Lin Blakley), she decides to have <b>a</b> double <b>mastectomy,</b> much to Sonia's delight, and calls off her marijuana deal with Tina.|$|R

25|$|Matuschka was mis-diagnosed {{and almost}} died of {{hepatitis}} A in 1968. A near fatal bike accident {{left her with}} many broken bones, a severe back injury and TBI in 1989. Two years later, {{at the age of}} 37, she was diagnosed with breast cancer, undergoing <b>a</b> <b>mastectomy</b> and 6 months of chemotherapy. Matuschka received financial aid from Change, the Robert Rauschenberg Fund, which helps artists facing intense hardships during her injury-related rehabilitation and cancer therapy. In 1991 Matuschka enrolled in the Kushi Institute, Beckett, Mass. and studied macrobiotics with Michio Kushi and Denny Waxman for 10 years.|$|E
25|$|The {{breast cancer}} {{movement}} {{has resulted in}} widespread acceptance of second opinions, the development of less invasive surgical procedures, the spread of support groups, and other advances in patient care. The movement successfully separated diagnostic biopsy from mastectomy surgery; before about 1980, it was common to perform the biopsy and, if a quick review of tissues indicated a probable need, <b>a</b> <b>mastectomy</b> in the same surgery. The one-step surgery prevented women from seeking different opinions about their treatment, and sent them into the surgery without knowing whether their breasts would be removed that day. In response to women's concerns over lymphedema after routine removal of lymph nodes during mastectomy, the more limited approach of sentinel node biopsy was developed. Advocacy efforts also led to the formal recommendation against the routine use of the Halsted radical mastectomy in favor of simple mastectomies and lumpectomies.|$|E
25|$|The breast implant has no {{clinical}} bearing upon lumpectomy breast-conservation {{surgery for}} women who developed breast cancer after the implantation procedure, nor does the breast implant interfere with external beam radiation treatments (XRT); moreover, the post-treatment incidence of breast-tissue fibrosis is common, and thus a consequent increased rate of capsular contracture. The study Breast Cancer Detection and Survival among Women with Cosmetic Breast Implants: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Observational Studies, reported a significant delay in the diagnoses of women who developed breast cancer after undergoing breast augmentation, when compared to breast cancer patients who had not undergone breast augmentation. The metadata study Breast Implants following Mastectomy in Women with Early-stage Breast Cancer: Prevalence and Impact on Survival (2005) reported that breast augmentation patients were statistically likelier to die from breast cancer. Although the use of implants for breast reconstruction after breast cancer mastectomy appears to have no negative effect upon the incidence of cancer-related death, women who underwent <b>a</b> <b>mastectomy</b> procedure tend to die earlier than women who underwent a lumpectomy procedure, with like diagnoses.|$|E

25|$|Viki is {{diagnosed}} with breast cancer in 2000, but survives after <b>a</b> <b>mastectomy</b> and chemotherapy. She and Ben marry in November. In 2001, a girl named Natalie Balsom (Melissa Archer) makes the startling claim that she is Viki and Clint's biological daughter, which is confirmed by a DNA test. Mitch Laurence returns from the dead, divulging to Viki he drugged and raped her around the same time she and Clint conceived Jessica and had unknowingly become pregnant with fraternal twins, one fathered by Clint, Natalie, and the other fathered by Mitch, Jessica (Erin Torpey). Unable to reconcile the revelation, Niki Smith emerges during the ordeal and plots to kill Ben in order to have her freedom, but when Ben is accidentally shot by Antonio Vega (Kamar de los Reyes), Viki returns. Ben is left comatose after the shooting. In 2003, Victor (William Stone Mahoney) is ostensibly revealed to be alive, claiming to have faked his death in 1976; however, shortly after he returns, Victor dies — but not before Viki and Todd confront him on ills inflicted to them in his wake. In 2004, Viki {{is diagnosed}} with heart disease and eventually needs a heart transplant. Coincidentally, a comatose Ben dies just as Viki takes a turn for the worse, and his heart is transplanted into Viki, who recovers but must face widowhood once again.|$|E
500|$|Because [...] "radical, body-altering" [...] {{surgery on}} a long-running {{character}} {{would cause the}} production team ongoing problems with continuity, {{it was decided that}} Peggy would have a [...] "less visible" [...] lumpectomy, rather than <b>a</b> <b>mastectomy.</b> A member of the EastEnders production team explained: [...] "We have to think about costume and what it's going to look like afterwards and what we're lumbering ourselves with [...] you have to think of that for a long-term character." [...] Additionally, giving Peggy a lumpectomy at that stage of her disease was viewed favourably by source organisations, as it helped to spread a message that <b>a</b> <b>mastectomy</b> is not necessary in all breast cancer cases. However, the storyline was revisited several times over the next few years. In August 1997, Peggy was given the [...] "all-clear" [...] at her follow-up mammogram, and in March 1999 the cancer returned and she underwent <b>a</b> <b>mastectomy,</b> while in 2000 she had a breast reconstruction.
