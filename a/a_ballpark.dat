25|$|Final {{deliberations}} in {{the legislature}} centered on whether a referendum either was or should be required for any portion of the financing.

25|$|April 13, 2009 – In {{the first}} Mets game ever played at Citi Field, Jody Gerut of the San Diego Padres {{hit a home}} run off Mike Pelfrey as the first batter of the game, {{becoming}} the first player in Major League Baseball history to open <b>a</b> <b>ballpark</b> with a leadoff home run.|$|E

25|$|With {{the entire}} Minnesota Legislature up for reelection in 2006, the session began with no {{expectation}} that <b>a</b> <b>ballpark</b> bill could pass. All parties were now committed {{to both the}} Hennepin County financing plan and the Rapid Park site, meaning all of the building blocks were {{in place for a}} deal, but optimism among the stakeholders was almost impossible to find.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, during the mid-1980s, Harrisburg Mayor Stephen Reed {{initiated}} a revitalization plan that included <b>a</b> <b>ballpark</b> {{for a new}} Minor League Baseball team in the city. This ballpark, named Riverside Stadium attracted the Pittsburgh Pirates, which moved the Nashua Pirates to Harrisburg. The team was renamed the Harrisburg Senators, in {{a nod to the}} old Senators franchise.|$|E
25|$|Even as the Twins {{were forced}} to {{continue}} playing in 2002, {{the seeds of the}} eventual financing solution were sown when Hennepin County, in which the city of Minneapolis is located, began to express interest in being a financial partner in <b>a</b> <b>ballpark.</b> Unfortunately for the Twins, Minnesota governor Jesse Ventura wanted to foster competition between the various localities, thinking it would spur more creativity in the structure of any deal. Instead, St. Paul legislators, led by new mayor Randy Kelly, and aided by Hennepin County legislators wanting to keep their constituents off the hook, played hardball, and amended the ballpark bill so that only cities -- not counties -- could become financial partners in <b>a</b> <b>ballpark.</b> They knew that this move would eliminate both Hennepin County and Minneapolis (by virtue of the $10 million cap on any contribution), and leave only St. Paul as a viable partner. The bill passed, and Ventura signed it, but the strategy backfired. The Twins investigated and quickly rejected St. Paul as an implausible place to build. Nothing came of the bill, and it effectively ended any serious talk of the team moving to St. Paul.|$|E

25|$|Despite that {{legislative}} misfire, in {{the summer}} of 2001 the city of Minneapolis became quite serious about the warehouse district site for <b>a</b> <b>ballpark,</b> after selecting the Twins' preferred riverfront site to house the new Guthrie Theater. Though no deal was struck to purchase the Rapid Park land at that time, an initial valuation of $10 million was assumed by the city for a roughly 10 acre parcel. Though not a realistic amount, it did fall conveniently within the restrictions of the 1997 referendum. The Twins were not involved in these discussions, and still exhibited no public interest whatsoever in the warehouse district location.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to those numbers being far apart, much had changed since the 2004 deal expired. The Hiawatha Light Rail (later Blue Line) had opened and become a huge success. Funding for the Northstar commuter rail line had been approved. As anticipated, these two lines would eventually converge on {{the northwest corner of}} the Rapid Park Site, now the likely location for a future multi-modal transportation hub. The site itself had been rezoned in 2005, allowing its development into high end commercial and residential space. Land Partners II had entered into a development agreement with Hines Corporation for this purpose, as a backup in the event that the land was not chosen as home for the Twins. Given the scarcity of land available in downtown Minneapolis, the land owners had multiple reasons to believe that the land’s value had, in fact, increased substantially since 2004, with or without <b>a</b> <b>ballpark.</b>|$|E

He was opposed by Roy McDowell, who criticized Harpole's plan to build <b>a</b> <b>ballpark,</b> saying [...] "We didn't get to vote on it, but I am going to make sure from here on out that people get to vote on all major issues". He also mentioned red light cameras, hand-held cell phones, animal control, and the drainage tax as additional issues he wished to put to a vote. Harpole won the May 9 election with 7568 votes, or 54%.|$|E

Flooding in Tamaulipas prompted residents to evacuate and utilize public shelters. A roof collapse at <b>a</b> <b>ballpark</b> injured two people. Damage to roads across the state amounted to 80million pesos (US$6million); however, no single road suffered major damage. Losses from heavy rain in El Mante reached 7million pesos (US$500,000), prompting a state of emergency. Some residences temporarily lost power across Tamaulipas. Road collapses in Veracruz City damaged ten homes and four cars. One of these further threatened 40homes in Infonavit Buena Vista within the city. A rockslide occurred in the remote community of El Tecomate. Flooding in Guanajuato caused notable disruptions and some damage.

500|$|Two {{home runs}} by Ruth on July 5, {{and one in}} each of two {{consecutive}} games a week later, raised his season total to 11, tying his career best from 1918. The first record to fall was the AL single-season mark of 16, set by Ralph [...] "Socks" [...] Seybold in 1902. Ruth matched that on July 29, then pulled ahead toward the major league record of 24, set by Buck Freeman in 1899. Ruth reached this on September 8, by which time, writers had discovered that Ned Williamson of the 1884 Chicago White Stockings had hit 27—though in <b>a</b> <b>ballpark</b> where the distance to right field was only [...] On September 20, [...] "Babe Ruth Day" [...] at Fenway Park, Ruth won {{the game with a}} home run {{in the bottom of the}} ninth inning, tying Williamson.
