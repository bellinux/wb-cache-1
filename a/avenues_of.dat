5|$|The {{campaign}} that Australian planners developed entailed three separate drives: in the north, it was planned that Japanese forces {{would be forced}} into the narrow Bonis Peninsula and contained; in the centre the seizure of Pearl Ridge would give the Australians control of the east–west <b>avenues</b> <b>of</b> approach, as well as affording them protection against further counter-attacks, while also opening {{the way for a}} drive to the east coast; and the main campaign in the south, where the bulk of the Japanese forces were concentrated around Buin.|$|E

5|$|Vahan was {{instructed}} by Heraclius {{not to engage}} in battle until all <b>avenues</b> <b>of</b> diplomacy had been explored. This was probably because Yazdegerd III's forces were not yet ready for the offensive in Iraq. Accordingly, Vahan sent Gregory and then Jabalah to negotiate, though their efforts proved futile. Before the battle, on Vahan's invitation, Khalid came to negotiate peace, to a similar end. These negotiations delayed the battles for a month.|$|E
5|$|Bloodlines is {{presented}} from first- and third-person perspectives. The player assigns their character {{to one of}} several vampire clanseach with unique powers, customizes their combat and dialog abilities and progresses through Bloodlines using violent and nonviolent methods.

The second building was the Hyatt Regency Century Plaza, designed by architect Minoru Yamasaki (1912-1986), and built from 1964 to 1966. At the same time, the Gateway East Building, on the southeast corner of Santa Monica Boulevard and the <b>Avenue</b> <b>of</b> the Stars, was completed in 1965; its exact address is 1800 <b>Avenue</b> <b>of</b> the Stars.

5|$|Deus Exs {{gameplay}} combines {{elements of}} the first-person shooter with stealth elements, adventure, and role-playing genres, allowing for its tasks and missions {{to be completed in}} a variety of ways, that in turn lead to differing outcomes. Presented from the first-person perspective, the player can customize Denton's various abilities such as weapon skills or lockpicking, increasing his effectiveness in these areas; this opens up different <b>avenues</b> <b>of</b> exploration and methods of interacting with or manipulating other characters. The player is able to complete side missions away from the primary storyline by moving freely around the available areas, which can reward the player with experience points to upgrade abilities and alternative ways to tackle main missions.|$|E
5|$|Mental health {{consists}} of a broad scope of measurements of mental well being including depression, stress and measurements of self-worth. Numerous factors affect the prevalence of mental health disorders among women in India, including older age, low educational attainment, fewer children in the home, lack of paid employment and excessive spousal alcohol use. There is also {{evidence to suggest that}} disadvantages associated with gender increase the risk for mental health disorders. Women who find it acceptable for men to use violence against female partners may view themselves as less valuable than men. In turn, this may lead women to seek out fewer <b>avenues</b> <b>of</b> healthcare inhibiting their ability to cope with various mental disorders.|$|E
5|$|Socially, {{economic}} dynamism {{opened up}} one of the <b>avenues</b> <b>of</b> social mobility in the Roman Empire. Social advancement was thus not dependent solely on birth, patronage, good luck, or even extraordinary ability. Although aristocratic values permeated traditional elite society, a strong tendency towards plutocracy is indicated by the wealth requirements for census rank. Prestige could be obtained through investing one's wealth in ways that advertised it appropriately: grand country estates or townhouses, durable luxury items such as jewels and silverware, public entertainments, funerary monuments for family members or coworkers, and religious dedications such as altars. Guilds (collegia) and corporations (corpora) provided support for individuals to succeed through networking, sharing sound business practices, and a willingness to work.|$|E

5|$|The Metroid series {{contains}} gameplay {{elements from}} shooter, platformer, and adventure games. The series is notable for its non-linear progression and solitary exploration format where the player only controls Samus Aran, with {{few or no}} other characters to interact with. The series has been a 2D side-scroller in all its incarnations until the Metroid Prime series changed the perspective to a first-person perspective, leading to a new first-person shooter element. The player gains items and power-ups for Samus's cybernetic suit primarily through exploration, and occasionally by defeating alien creatures through real-time combat with the suit's arm cannon. Many such upgrades enable further <b>avenues</b> <b>of</b> exploration. A recurring upgrade is the Morph Ball, which allows Samus to curl into a ball, roll into tight places and plant bombs.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} subsequently {{developed into}} three separate drives by the Australians, who fanned {{out from the}} main Allied base at Torokina: in the north, centre and southern parts of the island. The first actions were fought around the seizure of Pearl Ridge in late December 1944 to secure control of the east–west <b>avenues</b> <b>of</b> approach across the island, and to prevent any possible Japanese counter-attacks against Torokina. This was followed by actions in the north, where it was planned that Japanese forces would be forced into the narrow Bonis Peninsula and contained, while the main drive {{took place in the}} south, where the main Japanese forces were concentrated, with an initial drive towards Mosigetta, followed by an advance towards Buin on the coast. The drive south subsequently resulted in several actions around Slater's Knoll and around the Hongorai River.|$|E
5|$|The {{crossing}} of the Saint Lawrence by the American troops was observed by Quebec militia, who alerted British troops at Trois-Rivières.

After a brief exchange between an established British line and American troops emerging from the swamp, the Americans broke into a somewhat disorganized retreat. As some <b>avenues</b> <b>of</b> retreat were cut off, the British took a sizable number of prisoners, including General Thompson and much of his staff.|$|E

5|$|The {{ship was}} {{assigned}} the pennant number L134 during 1973. At {{the start of}} the year, Sydney was marked for a potential deployment to Mururoa in support of a Royal New Zealand Navy frigate sent to protest French nuclear testing at the atoll. The former carrier was chosen as she was capable of replenishing smaller vessels, and the RAN's dedicated replenishment oiler, , was undergoing refits. The Australian government did not want to send a warship until all other <b>avenues</b> <b>of</b> protest had been exhausted; the length of this delay meant Supplys refit was finished before Sydney was deployed, and the oiler was sent instead. Sydney visited Singapore in March, returned to Australia, and sailed to New Zealand in April: she participated in training exercises during both visits. The troopship was then involved in a joint warfare exercise in Jervis Bay during May.|$|E

Edney interfered with the investigation {{in order to prevent}} any findings that the Navy had knowingly operated an unsafe ship in an unsafe manner. Also, Edney feared that if the Iowa class battleships were found to be unsafe, the battleships would be decommissioned and the Navy would lose the associated admiral billets plus the other warships and support ships assigned to the battleship groups.|$|E
