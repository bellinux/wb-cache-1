5|$|In the Halo {{science fiction}} universe, the <b>Arbiter</b> is a ceremonial, religious, and {{political}} rank bestowed upon alien Covenant Elites. In the 2004 video game Halo 2, the rank {{is given to}} a disgraced commander {{as a way to}} atone for his failures. Although the <b>Arbiter</b> is intended to die serving the Covenant leadership, the High Prophets, he survives his missions and the Prophets' subsequent betrayal of his kind. When he learns that the Prophets' plans would doom all sentient life in the galaxy to extinction, the <b>Arbiter</b> allies with the Covenant's enemies—humanity—and stops the ringworld Halo from being activated. The <b>Arbiter</b> is a playable character in Halo2 and its 2007 sequel Halo 3; a different <b>Arbiter</b> appears in the 2009 real-time strategy game Halo Wars, which takes place 20years before the events of the main trilogy.|$|E
5|$|While the <b>Arbiter</b> {{remains a}} playable {{character}} in Halo 3 during cooperative gameplay (the second {{player in a}} game lobby controls him), the game's story never switches {{to the point of}} view of the <b>Arbiter,</b> as in Halo2. For much of Halo 3, the <b>Arbiter</b> assists human forces in their fight against hostile Covenant forces alongside John-117. After the Flood arrive on Earth, the <b>Arbiter</b> persuades Rtas 'Vadum not to glass the entire planet to quell the infestation. Along with a group of humans and Elites, the <b>Arbiter</b> follows the Prophet of Truth's forces through a slipspace portal to the Ark, where he kills the Prophet. The Master Chief decides to activate the Halo under construction at the Ark to destroy the local Flood while sparing the galaxy at large; the <b>Arbiter</b> helps to retrieve the artificial intelligence Cortana so that the installation can be fired. During the escape, the ship he and the Master Chief are on split in two; while the Master Chief is presumed lost, the <b>Arbiter</b> crashes safely to Earth. After attending a ceremony honoring the dead, the <b>Arbiter</b> and the rest of the Elites leave for their homeworld.|$|E
5|$|Regret's death {{triggers}} discord {{among the}} races of the Covenant, as the Hierarchs {{have given the}} Brutes the Elites' traditional job of protecting them {{in the wake of}} the death. The <b>Arbiter</b> is sent to find Halo's Index and captures it, Johnson, and Keyes before being confronted by Tartarus. He reveals to the <b>Arbiter</b> that the Prophets have ordered the annihilation of the Elites, and sends the <b>Arbiter</b> falling down a deep chasm.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Arbiters play a {{critical}} role in the performance of electronic systems. In this paper, we describe a novel method to formally verify correctness and performance of random priority-based <b>arbiters.</b> We define a property of random num-ber sequences, called Complete Random Sequence (CRS), to characterize bounded fairness properties of random number generators and random priority-based <b>arbiters.</b> We propose a three step verification method utilizing the notion of CRS to es-tablish deadlock-free operation of the <b>arbiters,</b> and to accurately quantify the request-to-grant delays. The proposed verification method may additionally be leveraged to tune systems composed of random priority-based <b>arbiters</b> and pseudo-random number generators, such as linear feedback shift registers (LFSRs), for optimal performance. We have successfully applied the approach to verify a host of cache <b>arbiters</b> and interconnection network controllers of commercial microprocessors. I...|$|R

5|$|Traveling {{through the}} portal, the humans and Elites {{discover}} an immense artificial structure {{known as the}} Ark, far beyond {{the edges of the}} Milky Way galaxy. Here, Truth can remotely activate all the Halos. The Flood arrive aboard High Charity in full force, beginning to infest the installation. Truth captures Johnson, as he needs a human to use Forerunner technology. Keyes is killed attempting a rescue, and Johnson is forced to activate the rings. Gravemind forges a truce with the Chief and <b>Arbiter</b> to stop Truth. The <b>Arbiter,</b> Master Chief, and Flood forces arrive and overwhelm Truth's guards, rescuing Johnson and halting the installations' activation. After the <b>Arbiter</b> kills Truth, Gravemind turns on the Chief and <b>Arbiter.</b>|$|E
5|$|By {{the events}} of Halo 3 (2007), the Flood {{intelligence}} known as the Gravemind infests and captures High Charity, while the Elites assist humans on Earth in defending themselves. Truth's forces excavate a portal to the Ark, located outside the Milky Way. The Elites follow Truth, and the Covenant <b>Arbiter,</b> or holy warrior, kills Truth ultimately ending the Covenant. After the Flood controlled High Charity arrives at the Ark, the <b>Arbiter</b> and Master Chief decide to activate a partially built Halo ring (the replacement for the ring that the Master Chief destroyed in the first game) destroying the Flood and sparing {{the rest of the}} galaxy. The remaining humans and Elites escape back through the portal. The Human-Covenant war ends in March 2553, and the <b>Arbiter</b> leads his Elites back to their homeworld.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Arbiters are {{commonly}} used components in elec-tronic systems to control access to shared resources. In this paper, we describe a novel method to check starvation in ran-dom priority-based <b>arbiters.</b> Typical implementations of random priority-based <b>arbiters</b> use pseudo-random number generators such as linear feedback shift registers (LFSRs) which makes them sequentially deep precluding a direct analysis of the design. The proposed technique checks a stronger bounded-starvation property; if the stronger property fails, we use the counter-example to construct an underapproximation abstraction. We next check the original property on the abstraction to check for its validity. We have found the approach {{to be a very}} effective bug hunting technique to reveal starvation issues in LFSR-based <b>arbiters.</b> We describe its successful application on formal verification of <b>arbiters</b> on a commercial processor design.

40|$|Crossbars are key {{components}} of communication switches used to construct multiprocessor interconnection networks. Multi-queue input buffers {{have been shown to}} lead to high performance in such networks by allowing packets at an input port to be processed in non-FIFO order. Symmetric crossbar <b>arbiters</b> efficiently resolve conflicting requests in switches with multi-queue input buffers. While these <b>arbiters</b> lead to excellent performance in terms of throughput and average latency, they do not guarantee fairness. Hence, it is possible for an "unlucky" packet to be left in a switch buffer for a long time, potentially forever, while other packets are forwarded quickly through the switch. This paper introduces and evaluates a technique for preventing such starvation situations. The viability of the technique is demonstrated by implementing it in VLSI.

5|$|In an {{interview}} during the preparations (May) for the Olympiad, Israel Gelfer (the Chairman of FIDE's Anti-cheating Committee) {{said that the}} issue of anti-cheating became important {{in the last couple of}} years, with the development of telecommunication technologies (mobile phones, watches and even glasses) that have caused a problem which cannot be ignored. Gelfer explained that they are trying to balance between their will to fight against cheaters and at the same time not to create an unhealthy atmosphere in the chess world. The usual electronic scans before and after the game were of course prescribed, while novel procedures included: having a special anti-cheating <b>arbiter</b> (Klaus Deventer) with approximately 15 arbiters under his authority, one of whose charges was to carry out 30–40 checks during the round; and that players MUST inform their Match <b>Arbiter</b> when leaving the playing area.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Arbiter</b> {{is saved}} by the tentacled {{creature}} and meets the Master Chief {{in the bowels of}} the installation. The creature, Gravemind, is the leader of the Flood on Installation 05. The Gravemind reveals to the <b>Arbiter</b> that the Great Journey would destroy Flood, humans, and Covenant altogether, and sends both the <b>Arbiter</b> and Master Chief to different places to stop Halo's activation. The Master Chief is teleported into High Charity, where a civil war has broken out among the Covenant; In Amber Clad crashes into the city, and Cortana realizes that Gravemind used them as a distraction to infest In Amber Clad and spread the Flood. As the parasite overruns the city, consuming the Prophet of Mercy in the process, the Prophet of Truth orders Tartarus to take Keyes, Johnson, and Guilty Spark to Halo's control room and activate the ring. The Master Chief follows Truth aboard a Forerunner ship leaving the city; Cortana remains behind to destroy High Charity and Halo if Tartarus succeeds in activating the ring.|$|E
5|$|The Ark, also {{referred}} to as Installation 00, is located outside the Milky Way galaxy and serves as the construction and control station for the Halo weapon system. It does not share the ringworld geometry of the other installations. During Halo 3, the Covenant discover a portal on Earth that leads to the Ark and are pursued by the humans and a breakaway faction of Covenant opposed to activating the rings. Gravemind, having hijacked High Charity, crash-lands on the installation. The remote firing of the rings is halted by Master Chief and the <b>Arbiter.</b> In order to end the threat of the Flood, Master Chief decides to activate Installation 04B under construction in The Ark, the replacement for the Halo that he destroyed in Halo: Combat Evolved. Unknown to everyone but 343 Guilty Spark, a premature firing would destroy the installation; the monitor attempted to defend 'his' ring but was destroyed by Master Chief, who proceeded to fire the weapon. The firing tears apart the incomplete Halo and severely damages The Ark as Master Chief, Cortana, and the <b>Arbiter</b> try to escape through the Portal, which closes as they enter, leaving Master Chief and Cortana drifting in space while the <b>Arbiter</b> returns to Earth successfully. The Ark appears in other Halo novels and the video game Halo Wars 2.|$|E

The Chief clears anti-air Covenant defenses so Hood can lead the last of Earth's ships against the Prophet, but Truth activates the buried artifact, creating a slipspace portal which he and his followers enter. A Flood-infested ship crash-lands nearby; Elite forces arrive and vitrify Flood-infected areas of Earth, stopping the threat. Following a message Cortana left aboard the Flood ship, the Chief, <b>Arbiter,</b> Elites, Johnson, Keyes and their troops follow Truth through the portal.

5|$|In {{the fourth}} round, a Japanese player (Tang Tang) was {{forfeited}} {{after he was}} caught with an electronic device in a random check conducted prior to leaving the venue.

Chief <b>Arbiter</b> Faiq Hasanov said that he was approached by an <b>arbiter</b> in the anti-cheating department and informed about the matter. He himself did not bother to check if there was a chess program installed on the device, as possession already violated the rules, leading to an automatic forfeiture. Later information from other arbiters involved indicated there possibly were two devices involved, and their quick check did not indicate a chess program was running. Without sufficient evidence of cheating per se, Hasanov felt that more than game disqualification would be double punishment. The captain of the Japanese team GM Mihajlo Stojanović later addressed some of the related issues in comments on the blog of the Macedonian grandmaster and general secretary of the Association of Chess Professionals Aleksandar Čolooviḱ.|$|E
