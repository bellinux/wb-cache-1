5|$|<b>Antibiotics</b> are {{frequently}} {{applied to the}} skin or taken orally to treat acne and are thought to work due to their antimicrobial activity against P. acnes {{and their ability to}} reduce inflammation. With the widespread use of <b>antibiotics</b> for acne and an increased frequency of antibiotic-resistant P. acnes worldwide, <b>antibiotics</b> are becoming less effective, especially macrolide <b>antibiotics</b> such as topical erythromycin. Commonly used <b>antibiotics,</b> either applied to the skin or taken orally, include clindamycin, erythromycin, metronidazole, sulfacetamide, and tetracyclines such as doxycycline and minocycline. When <b>antibiotics</b> are applied to the skin, they are typically used for mild to moderately severe acne. <b>Antibiotics</b> taken orally are generally considered to be more effective than topical <b>antibiotics,</b> and produce faster resolution of inflammatory acne lesions than topical applications. Topical and oral <b>antibiotics</b> are not recommended for use together.|$|E
5|$|<b>Antibiotics</b> have {{no effect}} against viral infections or against the viruses that cause the common cold. Due to their side effects, <b>antibiotics</b> cause overall harm but are still {{frequently}} prescribed. Some {{of the reasons that}} <b>antibiotics</b> are so commonly prescribed include people's expectations for them, physicians' desire to help, and the difficulty in excluding complications that may be amenable to <b>antibiotics.</b> There are no effective antiviral drugs for the common cold even though some preliminary research has shown benefits.|$|E
5|$|In {{uncomplicated}} cases, UTIs {{are treated}} with a short course of <b>antibiotics</b> such as nitrofurantoin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Resistance {{to many of the}} <b>antibiotics</b> used to treat this condition is increasing. In complicated cases, a longer course or intravenous <b>antibiotics</b> may be needed. If symptoms do not improve in two or three days, further diagnostic testing may be needed. Phenazopyridine may help with symptoms. In those who have bacteria or white blood cells in their urine but have no symptoms, <b>antibiotics</b> are generally not needed, although during pregnancy is an exception. In those with frequent infections, a short course of <b>antibiotics</b> may be taken as soon as symptoms begin or long-term <b>antibiotics</b> may be used as a preventative measure.|$|E
40|$|<b>Antibiotic</b> allergy {{labeling}} {{is highly}} prevalent and negatively impacts patient outcomes and <b>antibiotic</b> appropriateness. Reducing the prevalence and burden of <b>antibiotic</b> allergies requires the engagement of key stakeholders such as allergists, immunologists, pharmacists, {{and infectious diseases}} physicians. To help address this burden of <b>antibiotic</b> allergy overlabeling, we review 3 key <b>antibiotic</b> allergy domains: (1) <b>antibiotic</b> allergy classification, (2) <b>antibiotic</b> cross-reactivity, and (3) multidisciplinary collaboration. We review the available evidence and research gaps of currently used adverse drug reaction classification systems, <b>antibiotic</b> allergy cross-reactivity, and current and future models of <b>antibiotic</b> allergy care...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Ambulatory <b>antibiotic</b> {{prescribing}} {{contributes to}} the development of <b>antibiotic</b> resistance and increases societal costs. Here, we estimate the hidden societal cost of <b>antibiotic</b> resistance per <b>antibiotic</b> prescribed in the United States. Methods In an exploratory analysis, we used published data to develop point and range estimates for the hidden societal cost of <b>antibiotic</b> resistance (SCAR) attributable to each ambulatory <b>antibiotic</b> prescription in the United States. We developed four estimation methods that focused on the antibiotic-resistance attributable costs of hospitalization, second-line inpatient <b>antibiotic</b> use, second-line outpatient <b>antibiotic</b> use, and <b>antibiotic</b> stewardship, then summed the estimates across all methods. Results The total SCAR attributable to each ambulatory <b>antibiotic</b> prescription was estimated to be $ 13 (range: $ 3 –$ 95). The greatest contributor to the total SCAR was the cost of hospitalization ($ 9; 69  % of the total SCAR). The costs of second-line inpatient <b>antibiotic</b> use ($ 1; 8  % of the total SCAR), second-line outpatient <b>antibiotic</b> use ($ 2; 15  % of the total SCAR) and <b>antibiotic</b> stewardship ($ 1; 8  %). This apperars to be an error.; of the total SCAR) were modest contributors to the total SCAR. Assuming an average <b>antibiotic</b> cost of $ 20, the total SCAR attributable to each ambulatory <b>antibiotic</b> prescription would increase <b>antibiotic</b> costs by 65  % (range: 15 – 475  %) if incorporated into <b>antibiotic</b> costs paid by patients or payers. Conclusions Each ambulatory <b>antibiotic</b> prescription is associated with a hidden SCAR that substantially increases the cost of an <b>antibiotic</b> prescription in the United States. This finding raises concerns regarding the magnitude of misalignment between individual and societal <b>antibiotic</b> costs...|$|R

5|$|Approximately half of {{all known}} <b>antibiotics</b> {{interfere}} with the workings of a bacteria's ribosome, a large and complex biochemical machine that performs protein biosynthesis by translating messenger RNA into proteins. Macrolide <b>antibiotics</b> clog the ribosome's exit tunnel, preventing synthesis of essential bacterial proteins. In 2007, the Pande lab received a grant to study and design new <b>antibiotics.</b> In 2008, they used Folding@home to study the interior of this tunnel and how specific molecules may affect it. The full structure of the ribosome was determined only as of 2011, and Folding@home has also simulated ribosomal proteins, as many of their functions remain largely unknown.|$|E
5|$|Cholangitis {{requires}} {{admission to}} hospital. Intravenous fluids are administered, {{especially if the}} blood pressure is low, and <b>antibiotics</b> are commenced. Empirical treatment with broad-spectrum <b>antibiotics</b> is usually necessary until it is known for certain which pathogen is causing the infection, and to which <b>antibiotics</b> it is sensitive. Combinations of penicillins and aminoglycosides are widely used, although ciprofloxacin {{has been shown to}} be effective in most cases, and may be preferred to aminoglycosides because of fewer side effects. Metronidazole is often added to specifically treat the anaerobic pathogens, especially in those who are very ill or at risk of anaerobic infections. <b>Antibiotics</b> are continued for 7–10days. Drugs that increase the blood pressure (vasopressors) may also be required to counter the low blood pressure.|$|E
40|$|Regional {{differences}} of <b>antibiotic</b> use and <b>antibiotic</b> {{resistance in the}} fecal indicator bacteria Escherichia coli and enterococci were determined in different cities in the south, west, and north of The Netherlands. In 1999, differences in <b>antibiotic</b> consumption were observed between the different regions: 11. 19, 10. 84, and 7. 16 DDD (defined daily dosage) per 1, 000 inhabitants per day, respectively. No significant regional {{differences were found in}} the prevalence of <b>antibiotic</b> resistance for both E. coli and enterococci. However, the differences in <b>antibiotic</b> consumption observed might lead to changes in <b>antibiotic</b> resistance in the near future. Surveillance of <b>antibiotic</b> use and <b>antibiotic</b> resistance is strongly recommended to control the development of <b>antibiotic</b> resistance because it provides epidemiological data to set up and control <b>antibiotic</b> guidelines...|$|R
50|$|<b>Antibiotic</b> {{spectrum}} of activity is a component of <b>antibiotic</b> classification.

An example of a commonly used broad-spectrum <b>antibiotic</b> is ampicillin. An example of a narrow spectrum <b>antibiotic</b> is Dicloxacillin, which acts on beta-lactamase-producing Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Objective : to {{evaluate}} the <b>antibiotic</b> prophylaxis in surgical patients at the Gaffrée e Guinle University Hospital - HUGG. Methods : we conducted a rospective study of a cohort of 256 patients undergoing elective operations between January and September 2014. We collected data on demographics, use or not of prophylactic <b>antibiotic</b> and the <b>antibiotic</b> prophylaxis following characteristics: type of <b>antibiotic</b> used, moment of administration and duration of postoperative use. The analyzed outcomes were "justified use or non-use of <b>antibiotic</b> prophylaxis", "correct <b>antibiotic</b> choice," "administration of the <b>antibiotic</b> at the right time" and "discontinuation of the <b>antibiotic</b> at the right time. " Results : <b>antibiotic</b> prophylaxis was used in 91. 8 % of cases.

40|$|Objectives Much {{has been}} written about <b>antibiotic</b> {{stewardship}} although less is known about the structure and content of <b>antibiotic</b> policies at hospital level. As part of the European Commission Concerted Action <b>Antibiotic</b> Resistance Prevention And Control (ARPAC) Project, data on <b>antibiotic</b> stewardship were collated and relationships investigated by <b>antibiotic</b> consumption in European hospitals. Methods A questionnaire survey on <b>antibiotic</b> stewardship factors was completed by 170 hospitals from 32 European countries. Data on committees, <b>antibiotic</b> formularies and policies addressing empirical therapy and prophylaxis were collated. Data on <b>antibiotic</b> use, expressed as defined daily doses per 100 occupied bed-days (DDD/ 100 BD), were provided by 139 hospitals from 30 countries, and 124 hospitals provided both data sets. Six key indicator stewardship variables were analysed by European region, case mix and <b>antibiotic</b> consumption. Results Hospitals from Northern and Western Europe were more likely to convene <b>antibiotic</b> committees or drugs and therapeutic committees compared with those from Southern and South-Eastern Europe (P <  0. 001). One-fifth of hospitals had neither an <b>antibiotic</b> committee nor a policy. Hospital <b>antibiotic</b> policies commonly included recommendations on individual drugs, drug choices, dosage, duration and route but were less likely to contain information on side effects and cost. There were no significant differences by median total (J 01) <b>antibiotic</b> consumption, although other <b>antibiotic</b> subgroups differed by stewardship indicators. Conclusions Policies and practices relating to <b>antibiotic</b> stewardship varied considerably across European hospitals. These data provide a benchmark for newer European strategies tackling <b>antibiotic</b> resistance. More work is required to achieve harmonization of recommended practice, particularly in hospitals from Southern Europe...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The {{continued}} {{emergence of}} multiresistant pathogens and widespread antimicrobial use {{has led to}} a greater emphasis on antimicrobial stewardship programs. Concurrently, an increased awareness of the rising number of <b>antibiotic</b> allergy labels and impact on antimicrobial use has surfaced. The integration of <b>antibiotic</b> allergy de-labeling and antimicrobial stewardship programs may be a pathway worthy of further focus and investigation. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent literature has evaluated the efficacy of <b>antibiotic</b> allergy management (historical de-labeling, in-vitro testing, skin prick testing, intradermal testing, and oral challenges) and impact of <b>antibiotic</b> allergy labels on patient outcome. The importance of true and perceived <b>antibiotic</b> allergy cross-reactivity in the setting of β-lactam allergies has been highlighted. The impact of dedicated <b>antibiotic</b> allergy de-labeling clinics, inpatient <b>antibiotic</b> allergy testing, and integrated antimicrobial stewardship programs has been recently appraised. SUMMARY: More recent literature supports that appropriate <b>antibiotic</b> allergy in-vitro and in-vivo testing and subsequent <b>antibiotic</b> allergy de-labeling, particularly in regard to β-lactams, can decrease broad-spectrum <b>antibiotic</b> use, costs, patient length of stay, and mortality. Integration of <b>antibiotic</b> allergy management into the decision support systems of inpatient and outpatient antimicrobial stewardship programs represents an important opportunity to further improve measured outcomes from <b>antibiotic</b> utilization...|$|R

5|$|A rapid strep test may assist a {{clinician}} {{in deciding}} whether to prescribe an antibiotic to a person with pharyngitis, a common infection of the throat. Viral infections {{are responsible for the}} majority of pharyngitis, but a significant proportion (20% to 40% in children and 5% to 15% in adults) is caused by bacterial infection. The symptoms of viral and bacterial infection may be indistinguishable, but only bacterial pharyngitis can be effectively treated by <b>antibiotics.</b> Since the major cause of bacterial pharyngitis is GAS, the presence of this organism in a person's throat may be seen as a necessary condition for prescribing <b>antibiotics.</b> GAS pharyngitis is a self-limiting infection that will usually resolve within a week without medication.

Pseudomembranous colitis, usually caused by antibiotic use, is managed by discontinuing the causative agent and treating it with either metronidazole or vancomycin. Bacteria and protozoans that are amenable to treatment include Shigella Salmonella typhi, and Giardia species.
