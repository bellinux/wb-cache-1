500|$|Tourette {{syndrome}} {{was once}} thought to be rare: in 1972, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) believed there were fewer than 100 cases in the United States, and a 1973 registry reported only 485 cases worldwide. However, multiple studies published since 2000 have consistently demonstrated that the prevalence is much higher than previously thought. Discrepancies across current and prior prevalence estimates come from several factors: [...] <b>ascertainment</b> <b>bias</b> in earlier samples drawn from clinically referred cases, assessment methods that may fail to detect milder cases, and differences in diagnostic criteria and thresholds. There were few broad-based community studies published before 2000 and until the 1980s, most epidemiological studies of Tourette syndrome were based on individuals referred to tertiary care or specialty clinics. Individuals with mild symptoms may not seek treatment and physicians may not confer an official diagnosis of TS on children out of concern for stigmatization; children with milder symptoms are unlikely to be referred to specialty clinics, so prevalence studies have an inherent bias towards more severe cases. Studies of Tourette syndrome are vulnerable to error because tics vary in intensity and expression, are often intermittent, and are not always recognized by clinicians, patients, family members, friends or teachers; approximately 20% of persons with Tourette syndrome do not recognize that they have tics. Newer studies—recognizing that tics may often be undiagnosed and hard to detect—use direct classroom observation and multiple informants (parent, teacher, and trained observers), and therefore record more cases than older studies relying on referrals. As the diagnostic threshold and assessment methodology have moved towards recognition of milder cases, the result is an increase in estimated prevalence.|$|E

40|$|While {{there are}} now {{extensive}} databases of human genomic sequences from {{both private and public}} efforts to catalog human nucleotide variation, there are very few large-scale surveys designed for the purpose of analyzing human population history. Demographic inference from patterns of SNP variation in current large public databases is complicated by <b>ascertainment</b> <b>biases</b> associated with SNP discovery and the ways that populations and regions of the genome are sampled. Here, we present results from a resequencing survey of 40 independent intergenic regions on the autosomes and X chromosome comprising ∼ 210 kb from each of 90 humans from six geographically diverse populations (i. e., a total of ∼ 18. 9 Mb). Unlike other public DNA sequence databases, we include multiple indigenous populations that serve as important reservoirs of human genetic diversity, such as the San of Namibia, the Biaka of the Central African Republic, and Melanesians from Papua New Guinea. In fact, only 20 % of the SNPs that we find are contained in the HapMap database. We identify several key differences in patterns of variability in our database compared with other large public databases, including higher levels of nucleotide diversity within populations, greater levels of differentiation between populations, and significant differences in the frequency spectrum. Because variants at loci included in this database {{are less likely to be}} subject to <b>ascertainment</b> <b>biases</b> or linked to sites under selection, these data will be more useful for accurately reconstructing past changes in size and structure of human populations...|$|R

2500|$|Only about 10% of Tourette's {{patients}} exhibit coprolalia, but {{it tends}} to attract more attention than any other symptom. [...] There is a paucity of epidemiological studies of Tourette syndrome; <b>ascertainment</b> <b>bias</b> affects clinical studies. Studies on people with Tourette's often [...] "came from tertiary referral samples, the sickest of the sick". [...] Further, the criteria for a diagnosis of Tourette's were changed in 2000, when the impairment criterion {{was removed from the}} DSM-IV-TR for all tic disorders, resulting in increased diagnoses of milder cases. Further, many clinical studies suffer from small sample size. These factors combine to render older estimates of coprolaliabiased towards clinical populations of the more severe casesoutdated. An international, multi-site database of 3,500 individuals with Tourette syndrome drawn from clinical samples found 14% of patients with Tourette's accompanied by comorbid conditions had coprolalia, while only 6% of those with uncomplicated ("pure") Tourette's had coprolalia. The same study found that the chance of having coprolalia increased linearly with the number of comorbid conditions: [...] patients with four or five other conditionsin addition to ticswere four to six {{times more likely to have}} coprolalia than persons with only Tourette's. [...] One study of a general pediatric practice found an 8% rate of coprolalia in children with Tourette syndrome, while another study found 60% in a tertiary referral center (where typically more severe cases are referred). [...] A more recent Brazilian study of 44 patients with Tourette syndrome found a 14% rate of coprolalia; a Costa Rican study of 85 subjects found 20% had coprolalia; a Chilean study of 70 patients found an 8.5% rate of coprolalia; older studies in Japan reported a 4% incidence of coprolalia; and a still older clinical study in Brazil found 28% of 32 patients had coprolalia.

40|$|Abstract Background With the {{increasing}} availability of EST databases and whole genome sequences, SNPs {{have become the}} most abundant and powerful polymorphic markers. However, SNP chip data generally suffers from <b>ascertainment</b> <b>biases</b> caused by the SNP discovery and selection process in which {{a small number of}} individuals are used as discovery panels. The ongoing International Citrus Genome Consortium sequencing project of the highly heterozygous Clementine and sweet orange genomes will soon result in the release of several hundred thousand SNPs. The primary goals of this study were: (i) to estimate the transferability within the genus Citrus of SNPs discovered from Clementine BACend sequencing (BES), (ii) to estimate bias associated with the very narrow discovery panel, and (iii) to evaluate the usefulness of the Clementine-derived SNP markers for diversity analysis and comparative mapping studies between the different cultivated Citrus species. Results Fifty-four accessions covering the main Citrus species and 52 interspecific hybrids between pummelo and Clementine were genotyped on a GoldenGate array platform using 1, 457 SNPs mined from Clementine BES and 37 SNPs identified between and within C. maxima, C. medica, C. reticulata and C. micrantha. Consistent results were obtained from 622 SNP loci. Of these markers, 116 displayed incomplete transferability primarily in C. medica, C. maxima and wild Citrus species. The two primary biases associated with the SNP mining in Clementine were an overestimation of the C. reticulata diversity and an underestimation of the interspecific differentiation. However, the genetic stratification of the gene pool was high, with very frequent significant linkage disequilibrium. Furthermore, the shared intraspecific polymorphism and accession heterozygosity were generally enough to perform interspecific comparative genetic mapping. Conclusions A set of 622 SNP markers providing consistent results was selected. Of the markers mined from Clementine, 80. 5 % were successfully transferred to the whole Citrus gene pool. Despite the <b>ascertainment</b> <b>biases</b> in relation to the Clementine origin, the SNP data confirm the important stratification of the gene pools around C. maxima, C. medica and C. reticulata as well as previous hypothesis on the origin of secondary species. The implemented SNP marker set will be very useful for comparative genetic mapping in Citrus and genetic association in C. reticulata. </p...|$|R

40|$|Strong {{signatures}} of positive selection at newly arising genetic variants are well-documented in humans 1 – 8, but {{this form of}} selection may not be widespread in recent human evolution 9. Because many human traits are highly polygenic and partly determined by common, ancient genetic variation, an alternative model for rapid genetic adaptation has been proposed: weak selection acting on many pre-existing (standing) genetic variants, or polygenic adaptation 10 – 12. By studying height, a classic polygenic trait, we demonstrate the first human signature of widespread selection on standing variation. We show that frequencies of alleles associated with increased height, both at known loci and genome-wide, are systematically elevated in Northern Europeans compared with Southern Europeans (p< 4. 3 × 10 − 4).

40|$|Investigation of {{the origin}} and {{evolution}} of regulatory mechanisms requires comparable estimates for the abundance and co-occurrence of functional protein domains of distantly related genomes. Currently available methods suffer for strong <b>ascertainment</b> <b>biases,</b> requiring methods for unbiased approaches to protein domain contents at genome-wide scales [1, 4]. We will discuss domain distribution patterns between taxonomic groups providing insights into large-scale evolutionary trends. Since version 1. 75, the SUPERFAMILY database provides functional information for protein domains using the gene ontology annotation terms [2, 3]. To use the SUPERFAMILY database for comparison of GO annotation terms between species, one relies on existing, heavily biased gene annotation. To overcome this problem, we propose to perform gene prediction followed by the detection of protein domains via HMMs for SUPERFAMILY domains and subsequent analysis of the abundance and cooccurence of functionally related groups of domains. In this contribution, we will demonstrate that this methods leads to consistent estimates for quantitative comparison. In particular, we systematically study avoidance and preferential co-occurrence of domains associated with certain GO terms [3].
