It has special facilities such as 4 sound insulated circular (to enable lip reading) classrooms with an integrated <b>audio-system.</b> Special mixed transfer classes exist in year 10 and 11, enabling students who have come from specialised educational facilities to integrate into the mainstream system and complete their Abitur.|$|E
50|$|Several {{improved}} {{versions of}} VHS exist, most notably Super-VHS (S-VHS), an analog video standard with improved video bandwidth. S-VHS improved the horizontal luminance resolution to 400 lines (versus 250 for VHS/Beta and 500 for DVD). The <b>audio-system</b> (both linear and AFM) is the same. S-VHS made {{little impact on}} the home market, but gained dominance in the camcorder market due to its superior picture quality.|$|E

The proof-checking revealed an error in the correctness proof (not in the protocol!). 1 Introduction The verification of distributed systems {{is considered to be}} an important topic of current research. Especially real time systems where discrete and continuous quantities play important roles are interesting since these systems are very difficult to build error-free. Where many aspects of human life {{are becoming more and more}} dependent on such systems, the importance of the correctness of these increases. To help us human beings build good systems, the support of the computer can be very worthwile. One approach is to formally check a hand-made correctness proof with the com [...] ...|$|E
