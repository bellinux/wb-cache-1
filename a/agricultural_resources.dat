40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} the impact of instruments of the common agricultural policy (CAP) on the sustainable development of agriculture in areas with different resource conditions in the Wielkopolska region. The article hypothesizes that farmers from areas with favourable <b>agricultural</b> <b>resource</b> conditions more often obtained EU funds for pro-effective actions between 2004 and 2012 than farmers from areas with worse <b>agricultural</b> <b>resource</b> conditions. However, farmers from areas with worse <b>agricultural</b> <b>resource</b> conditions obtained more funds from the EU for environmental actions than farmers from areas with favourable <b>agricultural</b> <b>resource</b> conditions. The study has shown that between 2004 and 2012, farms in areas with favourable <b>agricultural</b> <b>resource</b> conditions in Wielkopolska obtained more funds for pro-effective actions than farmers from districts with worse <b>agricultural</b> <b>resource</b> conditions in Wielkopolska. Differences between the amounts of financial resources obtained by individual farmers in areas with different <b>agricultural</b> <b>resource</b> conditions for environmental activities were insignificant.

5|$|Leaders of Indonesian {{intelligence}} influential with Suharto {{had initially}} envisaged that invasion, subdual of Fretilin resistance, and integration with Indonesia would be quick and relatively painless. The ensuing Indonesian campaigns up through 1976 were devastating for the East Timorese, an enormous drain on Indonesian resources, were severely damaging to Indonesia internationally, and ultimately a failure. The wanton, wholesale killings by the TNI near the coastal regions {{during the opening}} months of the invasion had driven {{a large portion of}} the population and most of the remaining Falintil into the central regions. This proved counterproductive as it left Indonesian troops fighting against an enemy which was well equipped and had access to <b>agricultural</b> <b>resources</b> and population. The civilian population came to see the Falintil as a buffer against the excesses of the Indonesian forces, which led to heightened support for the resistance. From 1975 to 1977, the Fretilin protected at least 40% of the population who had fled the coastal regions, in inhospitable conditions, with the active support of rallied communities. Schwarz suggests the fact that Indonesian military's power base remained barely dented by the mid-1970s intelligence miscalculations and ongoing failures, was a measure of the military's dominance of Indonesian affairs.|$|E
