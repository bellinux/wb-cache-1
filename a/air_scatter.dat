40|$|In protein crystallography, {{observed}} diffraction intensities must {{be corrected}} for background radiation due to scatter from air and scatter and absorption by capillary, crystal and mother liquor. A systematic {{study shows that}} a major contribution to background intensity is <b>air</b> <b>scatter</b> arising from the air intercepted by the direct X-ray beam as 'seen' by the receiving-counter aperture. As a result there is a first-order dependence of background on the 20 angle. The second-order variations in this function are principally due to absorption of the direct beam or air-scattered radiation by the capillary and to diffraction by the glass in the direct beam. To reduce data collection time and crystal exposure, individual background measurements may be approximated by interpolation from empirical background curves or, alternatively, by collecting background intensities for short times and fitting these data with a multidimensional function. If isotropic interpolation is used, i. e., if background {{is considered to be}} a function of 2 θ alone, systematic errors of up to about 30 % can be introduced into the interpolated backgrounds.

40|$|Neutron {{scattering}} with polarization {{analysis is}} a powerful tool to determine magnetic structures and excitations. A common setup is to mount the sample {{at the center of}} a Helmholtz-type coil which can provide a magnetic field of any direction at the sample position and also a guide field along the neutron flight paths around the sample. Recent experiments showed quite a high demand for measurements at low momentum transfers. For the corresponding low <b>scattering</b> angles <b>air</b> <b>scattering</b> gives rise to a very large background. For this reason we have extended the standard setup to a combination of a large vacuum tank surrounded by electrical coils. The vacuum tank eliminates the <b>air</b> <b>scattering</b> and we can use the polarization analysis down to the lowest accessible momentum transfers. The coils themselves also show some new features: In contrary to the classic (symmetric) coil distribution we use an asymmetric setup which gives the advantage of a larger scattering window. Due to a more sophisticated current distribution this modified coil arrangement needs not to be rotated for different scattering conditions. The whole set-up will soon be available at IN 12, a cold neutrons three-axis spectrometer operated by FZ Julich in collaboration with CEA Grenoble as a CRG-B instrument at the Institut Laue Langevin in Grenoble.

40|$|Improvised {{explosive}} devices (IED) pose {{a very serious}} threat to civilians and military forces around the world, and new technologies must be developed for the early detection of these objects. Because of the high concentrations of low atomic number material such as nitrogen and hydrogen present in these explosives, x-ray backscattering provides a viable method of collecting information about these targets by analyzing their shape. Furthermore, a coded aperture {{used in conjunction with}} dynamic reconstruction algorithms offers high sensitivity and resolution even while the target is moving towards the detector. This paper describes a lab-based system that simulated a source-target-detector arrangement to be utilized in a radiation detecting vehicle in order to test dynamic reconstruction methods. Using a 225 kVp x-ray tube as the source, a medical CT-system camera fitted with a drill mask of 50 % fill factor as the detector, and both radioisotope sources and low Z backscatter targets, images were acquired and reconstructed. The geometry of the experimental setup was optimized to reduce background noise from <b>air</b> <b>scatter</b> and environmental sources, as well as to prevent incident photons from directly reaching the detector from the x-ray tube. Measurements of a Co- 60 point source and Co- 57 area source with high activity generated high contrast images for which the shapes of the sources were clearly resolved. Acquisitions with varying target-detector distance of low Z materials, including a filled water jug and a four inch thick polyethylene arrow, produced lower contrast images in which the shapes were not as easily distinguished. The radioisotope tests were a proof of principle for dynamic reconstruction and the backscatter targets provided much insight on methods for improving the lab system, including the addition of steel behind the target, the narrowing of the detector energy window, and reassessment of the x-ray cone-beam. by Tiffany Lee.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{experiment}} {{was to determine the}} combined <b>air</b> <b>scatter</b> and air absorption correction necessary to apply to measurements of the air kerma rate made at a distance of 1 metre from a " 1 " 9 " 2 Ir source free in air. This correction needs to be determined as the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) intends to set up a calibration service whereby secondary standard ionisation chambers can be calibrated against a primary standard in terms of air kerma rate at 1 metre in free space from a " 1 " 9 " 2 Ir source. Measurements were made with 2 types of chamber. Firstly measurements were made with a 100 cm" 3 spherical graphite transfer chamber and then measurements were repeated using a 1. 79 cm" 3 cylindrical cavity chamber which is one of a set of 3 chambers which form the primary standard for " 6 " 0 Co and " 1 " 3 " 7 Cs maintained by the NPL. As both these chambers were originally intended for use with photons of higher energies the graphite caps of the chambers provide a sufficient build up region to develop charged particle equilibrium. The " 1 " 9 " 2 Ir source used is a pellet encapsulated in a stainless steel casing, with diameter 1. 1 mm and length 5 mm. The source was exposed using a High Dose Rate (HDR) microSelectron brachytherapy unit manufactured by Nucletron. Results from measurements made using the transfer chamber gave an air attenuation correction to be applied to the measured charge at a source to chamber distance of 1 metre of (1. 2 #+-# 0. 3) %. Measurements made using the cylindrical cavity chamber could not be used to determine an estimate of the air attenuation correction for this set up.

40|$|A {{method of}} {{adapting}} a 9 - 0 cm X-ray camera isdescribed. Although scattering {{in the region}} 20 - 100;x cannot be called low angle scatter there are many clay mineral investigations in which dear recording of this region is required. We have found that 9 - 0 cm diameter powder cameras based {{on the design of}} the 19. 0 cm camera described by Bradley, Lipson, and Petch (194 I) can be modified to recorded spacings in this region. The cameras we normally use are modified as suggested by MacEwan (1949) and have a punched slot in the film with a locating peg instead of the more usual beam catcher. To eliminate <b>air</b> <b>scatter</b> at low angles the cameras are usually evacuated. For some investigations it is not desirable to evacuate the camera and in these cases a beam catcher is more useful. In this note a modification of the 9 " 0 cm camera is described which allows either a beam catcher or the punched slot method to be used with the same camera. The locating peg and the beam catcher are easily interchangeable and so also are beam catchers of different sizes. There is a fine adjustment which allows the beam catcher or the locating peg to be adjusted accurately and quickly. With a beam catcher 0. 5 mm wide, at a distance of 2 cm from the specimen, spacings up to 80. ~ can be dearly recorded with Co Kct radiation {{and there would be no}} great difficulty in extending this to somewhat lower angles. The short specimen to fihn distance, 4. 5 cm, and the facilities for evacua-tion which the camera already provides are further useful attributes. The beam is collimated by a double slit system both sets of which are adjustable. The first slit is on the film ring and the second slit is as near the specimen as possible. This arrangement combined with a foreshortened view of the focus gives narrow well-collimated beams. The beam catcher or the locating peg for the punched film are carried by a plate which rests on the top plate of the camera and which pivots about the conical specimen holder bearing. This plate has a fine adjustment and two locking screws. The beam catcher or locating peg is carried in a radial rectangular slot in the plate whic...|$|E

40|$|Theoretical {{exploration}} {{is undertaken}} for passive noise control by flush-mounted panels {{in an otherwise}} rigid duct. For a plane sound wave traveling in the flexible segment, the wall compliance renders a wave speed less than the isentropic speed of sound in <b>air.</b> <b>Scattering</b> and reflection occur at the upstream edge of the panel while the energy flux of the transmitted wave is partitioned between the wall flexural waves and the sound in air. For a lossless panel these waves are scattered and reflected again by the downstream edge forming standing waves responsible for the undesirable passbands. For panels with substantial structural damping, however, both flexural and sound waves diminish with distance, eliminating the passbands. It is estimated that the wave dissipation by panel materials like rubber could outperform typical fibrous duct lining.
