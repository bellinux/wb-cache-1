5000|$|Thus after {{a colony}} {{is reduced by}} 1 D, only 10% of the {{original}} organisms remain, i.e., the population number has been reduced by one decimal place in the counting scheme. Generally, each lot of a sterilization-resistant organism is given a unique D-value. When referring to D-values, {{for the purpose of}} thermal analysis, it is proper to give the temperature as a subscript of the [...] "D". For example, given a hypothetical organism which is reduced by 90% after exposure to temperatures of 150° C for 20 minutes, the D-value would be written as D150C = 20 minutes. If generally describing D-value for any temperature, a common abbreviation is DT (where T is temperature) until a value for T is relevant to express, specifically. Another more general <b>abbreviated</b> <b>expression</b> of D-value is D10 (as to denote 10% reduction).|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new Japanese metonymy interpretation method using the examplebased method (Nagao 1984; Murata and Nagao 1997; Murata et al. 1999 b; Murata et al. 1999 a). Metonymy is a metaphorical expression {{in which the}} name of something is substituted for another thing associated with the thing named. For example, in the Japanese sentence of "boku ga torusutoi wo yomu (I read Tolstoi)," the word "torusutoi (Tolstoi) " is a metonymic word. In this case, the word "torusutoi (Tolstoi) " means a book written by him "torusutoi no hon (Tolstoi's book). " The actual meaning "torusutoi no hon (Tolstoi's book) " is replaced by the <b>abbreviated</b> <b>expression</b> "torusutoi (Tolstoi). " In this paper we call an abbreviated word such as "torusutoi (Tolstoi) " a source word, and call the word it replaces [...] - in this case, "torusutoi no hon (Tolstoi's book) " [...] - a target word...|$|E

These include epicuticular wax composition, cell wall characteristics, {{and the presence}} or absence of differentiated epidermal cell types (e. g., epidermal macrohairs and bulliform cells). A transposon-induced mutable allele of Glossy 15 (gl 15 -m 1) was isolated and employed in both phenotypic and genetic analyses to characterize the role of Gl 15 in the maize juvenile-to-adult phase transition. Comparisons between Gl 15 -active and Gl 15 -inactive somatic sectors in the leaves of variegated plants demonstrated that the Gl 15 gene product acts in a cell-autonomous manner to direct juvenile epidermal differentiation but does not affect factors that regulate the overall process of phase change. Examination of the gl 15 -m 1 phenotype in the Corngrass 1, Teopod 1, and Teopod 2 mutant backgrounds showed that the prolonged expression of juvenile epidermal traits associated with these mutations also required Gl 15 activity. These results support a model whereby the cell-autonomous Gl 15 gene product responds to a juvenility program that operates throughout the vegetative shoot to condition the juvenile differentiation of maize leaf epidermal cells...|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} time as defined in physics is the most {{naturally}} interpreted as a block time. According to this interpretation, time is like any other parameter in physics, without any intrinsic flow and without any fundamental difference between past and future. Yet, such a view of time is in a sharp contrast with our intuitive subjective experience of time. Where this discrepancy comes from? I argue that this discrepancy is an artefact of the linguistic inconvenience that we use a single word “time ” to describe two very different things, one described by physics, the other being related to consciousness. To clearly distinguish between them, I refer the former to as pime, <b>abbreviating</b> the <b>expression</b> “physical time ” or “parameter time”. As the phenomenon of consciousness is not truly understood by our current understanding of physics, current physics has little to say about time. Physics is only about pime, which is a block pime without a flow and without a fundamental difference between past and future. The relation between pime and time remains a challenge for the future research {{as a part of}} the hard problem of the relatio...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} of new communication and information media (ICT) has {{an enormous impact on}} the {{development of}} the language system, including its written discourse. The Internet itself has changed the way of communication drastically. People's communication is much faster, less caressly done and often not well conceived. Also other ICT media, such as social network facebooks or chat groups, make the written speech less structured, more <b>abbreviated</b> in its <b>expressions</b> and less polite. Others, such as e-learning, used in education, try to motivate and encourage a learner in his/ her studies and therefore its content must be more dynamic and eye-catching to engage the learner. The purpose of the presentation is therefore to describe the changes in the written speech, particularly in English and show its consequences on communication...|$|R
40|$|Attempting {{to escape}} from the substantialist {{cartesian}} dualism, some take our conceptual schemes as dualist. Thus, Feigl makes the distinction between the mental and the physical from an epistemological viewpoint, accepting as distinctive of the mental a direct and immediate knowledge which has no place in the physical, but however he accepts the identity between mental states and neurological states. In a similar way, Davidson, stating that all events are physical, characterizes the mental as a specific manner of describing neurological events, which is also accepted by Quine in his latest books. I take that theory as implying that there are mental properties, like those defined by Searle as macroproperties of the brain. But I see no reason to talk about the mind, unless with the purpose of <b>abbreviating</b> more complex <b>expressions</b> like ‘the set of mental properties’, or perhaps ‘the set of human psychological capacities’, as Kenny proposes...|$|R
40|$|As the {{popularity}} of sending messages electronically increases, so does the necessity of conveying messages more efficiently. One way of increasing efficiency is to <b>abbreviate</b> words and <b>expressions</b> by combining letters with numbers such as gr 8 for “great,” using acronyms, such as lol for “laughing out loud,” or clippings such as msg for “message. ” The present study compares the processing of shortcuts to the processing of closely matched pseudo-shortcuts. ERPs were recorded while participants were performing a lexical decision task. Response times showed that shortcuts were categorized more slowly as nonwords than pseudo-shortcuts. The ERP results showed no differences between shortcuts and pseudo-shortcuts at time windows 50 – 150 ms and 150 – 270 ms, but {{there were significant differences}} between 270 and 500 ms. These results suggest that at early stages of word recognition, the orthographic and phonological processing is similar for shortcuts and pseudo-shortcuts. However, at the time of lexical access, shortcuts diverge from pseudo-shortcuts, suggesting that shortcuts activate stored lexical representations...|$|R
40|$|Recombinant adenovirus-mediated {{gene therapy}} has {{demonstrated}} great promise for {{the delivery of}} genes to the pulmonary epithelium. However, dose-dependent inflammation and local immune responses <b>abbreviate</b> transgene <b>expression.</b> The purpose of these studies {{was to determine the}} role of TNF- � and individual TNF receptor signaling to adenovirus clearance and immune responses, and whether coexpression of human IL- 10 could reduce inflammation and extend the duration of transgene expression in the lung. �-Galactosidase expression in mice receiving intratracheal instillation of Adv/�-gal (adenovirus construct expressing �-galactosidase) was transient (less than 14 days), but a significant early increase of �-galactosidase expression was seen in mice lacking either or both TNF- � receptors. Absence of TNF- � or the p 55 receptor significantly attenuated the Ab response to both adenovirus and �-galactosidase. Human IL- 10 expression in the lung suppressed local TNF- � production following AdV/hIL- 10 (adenovirus construct expressing human IL- 10) delivery, but did not lead to increased or prolonged transgene expression when coexpressed with �-galactosidase. Expression of human IL- 10 following AdV/hIL- 10 instillation extended at least 14 days, was nonimmunogenic, and suppressed the development of neutralizing Abs against adenoviral proteins as well as against human IL- 10. We conclude that TNF- � signaling through both the p 55 and p 75 receptor plays important roles in the clearance of adenoviral vectors and the magnitude of the humoral immune response. Additionally, although coexpression of human IL- 10 with �-galactosidase had only modest effects on transgene expression, we demonstrate that AdV/hIL- 10 is well tolerated, has extended expression compared with �-galactosidase, and is nonimmunogenic in the lung.

However, a '64 k' circuit will not transmit a '64 k' file in one second. This may not be obvious to those unfamiliar with telecommunications and computing, so misunderstandings sometimes arise. In actuality, a 64 kilobyte file is 64 × 1,024 × 8 bits in size and the 64 k circuit will transmit bits at a rate of 64 × 1,000 bit/s, so the amount of time taken to transmit a 64 kilobyte file over the 64 k circuit will be at least (64 × 1,024 × 8)/(64 × 1,000) seconds, which works out to be 8.192 seconds.|$|R
40|$|The human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) Rev (regulator of virion protein expression) protein exemplifies {{a new type of}} posttranscriptional regulation. One main function of Rev is to increase the cytoplasmic expression of unspliced and incompletely spliced retroviral mRNAs from which viral structural proteins are made. In that way, Rev is essential in order to complete the retroviral life cycle. The biology of Rev in the host cell has remained elusive. In this study, a complex distribution of Rev in single cells was found. Rev was found in the cytoplasm, in a perinuclear zone, in the nucleoplasm, and in the nucleoli. In the nucleoplasm, Rev colocalized in a speckled pattern with host cell factors known to assemble on nascent transcripts. Those factors are involved in the processing of heterogeneous RNA to spliced mRNA in the nucleoplasm of all cells. The distribution of Rev was dependent only on Rev and host cell interactions, since neither the Rev target RNA nor other HIV proteins were expressed in the cells. Rev was found in the same subcellular compartments of cells treated for extended periods with cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis. This finding implies that Rev shuttles continuously between cytoplasmic and nucleoplasmic compartments. The results suggest a potential role for Rev both in the RNA-splicing process and in the nucleocytoplasmic transport of Rev-dependent HIV mRNA.
