An intra­molecular C—H⋯O hydrogen bond results in the formation of a non-planar ten-membered ring. In the crystal structure, inter­molecular O—H⋯Cl and N—H⋯Cl hydrogen bonds link the mol­ecules. There is a C—H⋯π contact between the methyl group and the phenyl ring, and a π–π contact between the hydroxy­phenyl and phenyl rings [centroid–centroid distance = 4. 687  (2)  Å]...|$|E
40|$|The binding cavity of {{histamine}} and histamine antagonist is explored using site {{directed mutagenesis}} of the human histamine H 1 receptor and the amino acids involved in ligand binding are identified. Whereas Asp 107 and Phe 199 are important for both agonist and antagonists, two additional amino acids (Asn 198 and Trp 103) are required for efficient histamine binding. The binding site of antagonists is best defined as resulting from a strong ionic bond to Asp 107, an orthogonal interaction between one of the <b>atomatic</b> rings and the with Phe 199, and probably a hydrophobic interaction between the second aromatic ring and the lipophilic amino acids of {{the upper part of}} TMIV and TMV. This is consistent with structure-activity data of most described antagonists. SCOPUS: cp. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

40|$|We {{have studied}} lepton flavor {{violation}} processes μ→ eγ and μ-e conversion in nuclei induced by unparticle. Both Br(μ→ eγ) and μ-e conversion rate CR(μ-e, Nuclei) strongly {{depend on the}} scale dimension d_ U and the unparticle coupling λ^ff'_ K(K=V, A, S, P). Present experimental upper bounds on Br(μ→ eγ), CR(μ-e, Ti) and CR(μ-e, Au) put stringent constraints on the parameters of unaprticle physics. The scale dimensions d_ U around 2 are favored for the unparticle scale Λ_ U of O(10 TeV) and the unparticle coupling of O(10 ^- 3). CR(μ-e, Nuclei) is proportional to Z^ 4 _effA^ 2 /Z for the pure vector and scalar couplings between unparticle and SM fermions, this peculiar <b>atomatic</b> number dependence {{can be used to}} distinguish unparticle from other theoretical models.

40|$|Electronic {{engineering}} {{world is}} a wide world and develops all time. That’s why so many things created in electronic engineering world to make a job easier. We all knew what is mean by web-cam camera. Along these times, camera system only has as monitoring function, without <b>atomatic</b> video recorder, so we only see it when the camera system working. That’s a reason why automatic video recorder was made. The automatic video recorder was controlled by AT 89 S 51 micro-controller, then the recorder was saved at a picture saving media. The tool made included hardware and software. Hardware design consisted of : censor, micro-controller, keypad, LCD as display, and for software was flowchart working system. To get the observation result, we could state the length of recording time, with time we wanted. After entering the recording time, so the censor would detect is there anything passed {{in front of the}} censor. If the censor split off, the micro-controller would command the computer to start the recording, so the computer program would take the date and time to create the name-file in video recording process. Recording process would begin and end when the duration had passed. Recording file in hard-disc could be played anytime needed to see the recording...|$|E
40|$|Chitosan is {{a linear}} {{polysaccharide}} composed of randomly distributed β-(1 - 4) -linked D-glucosamine and Nacetyl- D-glucosamine. There {{have been many}} reports on the induced systemic resistance and in vivo antifungal activities of higher molecular weight chitosans with molecular weights over 3, 000 amu (<b>atomatic</b> mass unit), but there are few papers on in vivo antifungal activities of low molecular weight chitosans (oligochitosans) with molecular weights less than 3, 000 amu. In our study, an oligochitosan sample (320 ? 3, 000 amu) showed a potent 1 -day protective activity with control values more than 94 % at concentrations of 500 and 1, 000 ?g/ml especially against tomato late blight caused by Phytophthora infestans under growth chamber conditions. It also displayed a moderate 1 -day protective activity with control values of 67 ? 89 % at concentrations of 500 and 1, 000 ?g/ml against wheat leaf rust and red pepper anthracnose. On the other hand, it showed a 16 -hr curative activity against red pepper anthracnose, but not against tomato late blight and wheat leaf rust. In field experiments, oligochitosan effectively suppressed the development of late blight on potato and tomato plants with control values of 72 % and 48 %, respectively. The results strongly indicate that oligochitosan {{can be used as}} an eco-friendly organic material for the control of late blight on tomato and potato plants...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{thesis is}} focused on the problem of the Automatic Tool Change for milling centers, which is recently shown as a very current topic. The content of this work is to conduct a comprehensive research of various types of ATC {{depending on the type of}} machine, as well as research of the current tool interface relating closely with these problems. There was made a comprehensive analysis on the basis of data obtained by comprehensive research, from which both the main factors affecting this topic and the area dealed and developed by this work resulted. The most problematic area of machinery used nowdays for the <b>Atomatic</b> Tool Change was detected as manipulator provided the exchange between spindle and tool storage. Kinematic structure and design of individual elements affects very significantly the dynamics of the whole process of exchange of tools. Therefore, the work {{is focused on}} problematic of the manipulator. The main results of this thesis are constructional design of several types of manipulators, which were partly realized within the project 1. 2. 4 of Brno department of RCMT in the form of the testing stands. There was developed simulation models for selected types of manipulators which were verificated by measuring on the real stand. On the basis of abovementioned problem there was identified another key issue related not only to the exchange process but also with complex problem of service life of spindle. It is a grab force in the process of picking tools. The work outlines the possibilities for further research of these forces on the service file of spindle (especially on service life of bering groups of spindle) ...|$|E
