5|$|In his own time, Whitman {{attracted}} {{an influential}} coterie of disciples and admirers. Some, like Oscar Wilde and Edward Carpenter, viewed Whitman {{both as a}} prophet of <b>a</b> <b>utopian</b> future and of same-sex desire – the passion of comrades. This aligned with their own desires for a future of brotherly socialism.|$|E
5|$|The {{widespread}} Yellow Turban Rebellion {{also occurred}} in 184 CE, its leaders {{claiming that they}} were destined to bring about <b>a</b> <b>utopian</b> era of peace. Like the Five Pecks of Rice society, the Yellow Turbans of the Huai and Yellow River valleys also believed that illness {{was a sign of}} wrongdoing that necessitated confession to church leaders and faith healers. However, the Yellow Turbans typically utilized holy water as a ramification for sickness; if this did not cure the sick, the latter's sins were deemed too great to be exculpated. Since the year 184 CE was the first (and very auspicious) year of a new sexagenary cycle, the Yellow Turban's supreme leader Zhang Jue (d. 184 CE) chose the third month of that year as the time to rebel; when this was leaked to the Han court, Zhang was forced to initiate the rebellion prematurely. Although the Yellow Turbans were able to muster hundreds of thousands of troops, they were overpowered by the combined force of imperial troops and independent generals. By {{the end of the year}} their leadership—including Zhang Jue—had been killed and only scattered groups remained until they were amalgamated into the forces of Cao Cao in 192 CE.|$|E
5|$|Gonsales is a Spaniard {{forced to}} flee the country after killing {{a man in a}} duel. Having made his fortune in the East Indies, he decides to return to Spain, but falls ill on the voyage home and is set off on the island of St Helena to recover. There he discovers a species of wild swan able to carry {{substantial}} loads, the gansa, and contrives a device that allows him to harness many of them together and fly around the island. Once fully recovered, Gonsales resumes his journey home, but his ship is attacked by an English fleet off the coast of Tenerife. He uses his flying machine to escape to the shore, but once safely landed he is approached by hostile natives and is forced to take off again. This time his birds fly higher and higher, towards the Moon, which they reach after a journey of twelve days. There Gonsales encounters the Lunars, a tall Christian people inhabiting what appears to be <b>a</b> <b>utopian</b> paradise. After six months of living among them, Gonsales becomes homesick and concerned for the condition of his birds, and sets off to return to Earth. He lands in China, where he is immediately arrested as a magician, but after learning the language manages to win the trust of the local mandarin. The story ends with Gonsales meeting a group of Jesuit missionaries, who arrange to have a written account of his adventures sent back to Spain.|$|E

25|$|Cross's {{affinity}} with the Neo-Impressionist movement extended beyond the painting style to include their political philosophies. Like Signac, Pissarro, and other Neo-Impressionists, Cross believed in anarchist principles, with hope for <b>a</b> <b>utopian</b> society. In 1896 Cross created a lithograph, L'Errant (The Wanderer). This {{marked the first}} time he had worked with a publisher, and the piece was featured anonymously in Les Temps Nouveaux, Jean Grave's anarchist journal. Cross's anarchist sentiments influenced his choice of subjects: he painted scenes illustrating <b>a</b> <b>utopian</b> world that could exist through anarchism.|$|E
25|$|Eva Funke {{analyses}} {{the description}} of the Inca state as <b>a</b> <b>utopian</b> bourgeois society in the third volume as a critique of Campe’s contemporary society. Thus {{the description of}} the ruling system, for instance, functions as a mirror to the current systems of the German states and shows <b>a</b> <b>utopian</b> ideal where the bourgeois characteristic of competence is more important than birth. In addition, Funke points to the recurring motif of revolution in Discovery. The trilogy is presenting revolutions as {{something that needs to be}} avoided because they can hinder achieving one’s goals and are responsible for the downfall of peoples.|$|E

However, Sequoia trees, unlike their coast redwood relatives, were later discovered to splinter easily and therefore were ill-suited to timber harvesting, though thousands of trees were felled before logging operations finally ceased.|$|E
