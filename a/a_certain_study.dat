While S. epidermidis tends to colonize {{the upper part of}} the body, S. hominis tends to colonize in areas with numerous apocrine glands, such as axillae and the pubic region. In <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>study,</b> S. hominis was calculated to account for 22% of the total staphylococcal species recovered from individuals, second to S. epidermidis at 46%. S. hominis is the predominant species on the head, axillae, arms, and legs.S. hominis, as well as most other staphylococcal species common on the human skin, is able to produce acid aerobically from glucose, fructose, sucrose, trehalose, and glycerol. Some strains were also able to produce acid from turanose, lactose, galactose, melezitose, mannitol, and mannose. Most strains colonize {{on the skin}} for relatively short periods of time compared to other Staphylococcus species. They, on average, stay on the skin for only several weeks or months.The cell wall contains low amounts of teichoic acid and glutamic acid. The cell wall teichoic acid contains glycerol and glucosamine.S. hominis cells are Gram-positive cocci, usually 1.2 to 1.4 μm in diameter. They appear normally in tetrads and sometimes in pairs.|$|E

In this paper a simulator for active databases, named ECAPNSim, is described. ECAPNSim uses the definition of ECA rules like a structure of an extended Petri net model, the Conditional Colored Petri Net (CCPN).

Similarly, collaboration between researchers and policy makers within the EPPSE context seems unique due to their intense and formalised collaboration (e.g. principal investigators met monthly with policy makers discussing a mutually agreed agenda; Sylva et al. 2007).|$|E

Geographic entities occupying <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>study</b> area are conceptualized as discrete loci {{in that same}} n-dimensional space.

Examples based on two different data sets are presented, with population census data providing n-dimensional attributes of geographic entities in both cases.

40|$|This paper aims at {{giving a}} summary of recent {{research}} on the habitat requirements and population structure of beetles and pseudoscorpions living in old, hollow oaks in Sweden. An inventory of old oaks in pasture woodlands revealed that the species richness of beetles is higher at sites that are originally open and are still grazed. The trees in these plots are preferred for two reasons: they are more sun-exposed and have a larger trunk diameter. Many species are harmed by forest regrowth and, thus, to preserve the rarer saproxylic fauna {{it is important to}} continue the management of areas with old oaks. In four of thirteen species (Osmoderma eremita, Tenebrio opacus, Elater ferrugineus and Larca lata), the occupancy per tree were found to be significantly positively correlated with the number of trees in the stand. This finding is noteworthy as there is little scientific evidence available to support that saproxylic beetles suffer from habitat fragmentation. The population dynamics were investigated on <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>study</b> species, O. eremita.

In other words, they are not like typical Japanese when using a foreign language, English", said Hayashi Chikio, president of Japan Poll Association. I have been concerned with the theme that when people speak in a foreign language they sometimes change their attitudes, beliefs, and thought patterns from their own to what they perceive as better suiting the background culture of that language. For example, some Japanese people who are usually quiet and moderate become aggressive and overly frank when speaking in English. This kind of change can be regarded as an instability of self-identity. It is unknown whether or not this tendency is significantly stronger among Japanese people than among speakers of other ethnic groups, but according to the results of <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>study,</b> Japanese people do seem to display this tendency. Although it is difficult to identify the causes, a few of the possible causes can be listed as: 1) trying to fit in smoothly with one's surroundings rather than sticking stubbornly to a fixed individual personality is a traditional behavior pattern in the Japanese character; 2) the high esteem in which most Japanese hold English and English-speaking culture; 3) problems in Japanese foreign language education.

40|$|Detailed {{calculations}} of ground-ice volumes in permafrost deposits {{are necessary to}} understand and quantify the response of permafrost landscapes to thermal disturbance and thawing. Ice wedges with their polygonal surface expression are a widespread ground-ice component of permafrost lowlands. Therefore, the wedge-ice volume (WIV) {{is one of the}} major factors to be considered, both for assessing permafrost vulnerability and for quantifying deep permafrost soil carbon inventories. Here, a straightforward tool for calculating the WIV is presented. This GIS and satellite image-based method provides an interesting approach for various research disciplines where WIV is an important input parameter, including landscape and ecosystem modeling of permafrost thaw or organic carbon assessments in deep permafrost deposits. By using basic data on subsurface ice-wedge geometry, our tool can be applied to other permafrost region where polygonal-patterned ground occurs. One is able to include individual polygon geomorphometry at a specific site and the shape and size of epigenetic and/or syngenetic ice wedges in three dimensions. Exemplarily, the WIV in late Pleistocene Yedoma deposits and Holocene thermokarst deposits is calculated at four case study areas in Siberia and Alaska. Therefor, we mapped ice-wedge polygons sizes on different landscape units by using very-high-resolution satellite data. This information was combined with literature or own field data of individual ice-wedge sizes. We demonstrate that the WIV can vary considerably, not only between different permafrost regions, but also within <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>study</b> site.

In this paper we present a novel approach to quantify the spatial and temporal scale of moisture recycling, independent of {{the size and shape of}} the region under study. In contrast to previous studies, which essentially used curve fitting, the scaling laws presented by us follow directly from the process equation. thus allowing a fair comparison between regions and seasons. The calculation is based on ERA-Interim reanalysis data for the period 1999 to 2008. It is shown that in the tropics or in mountainous terrain the length scale of recycling can be as low as 500 to 2000 km. In temperate climates the length scale is typically between 3000 to 5000 km whereas it amounts to more than 7000 km in desert areas. The time scale of recycling ranges from 3 to 20 days, with the exception of deserts, where it is much longer. The most distinct seasonal differences can be observed over the Northern Hemisphere: in winter, moisture recycling is insignificant, whereas in summer it plays a major role in the climate. The length and time scales of atmospheric moisture recycling can be useful metrics to quantify local climatic effects of land use change. Water ManagementCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
30|$|When {{combining}} Monte Carlo {{approach with}} transition potentials generalized by ANN, this study introduced a parameter “up” {{to make the}} model controllable. This parameter controls the number of cells on which Monte Carlo approach will be used. For all the land use types, if the transition probability generalized by BP network to one land use type of a cell is smaller than “up”, then {{the state of the}} cell would remain the same in the iterative cycle. Otherwise, the state of the cell was then determined by Monte Carlo approach. Thus, if “up” is set zero, all of the cells will be treated according to the rules of combination of Monte Carlo approach and transition probabilities. If “up” is set one, none of the cells will be converted. This process was iterated and land use map was predicted. Since only those cells with transition probabilities larger than “up” would be treated by the Monte Carlo approach and transition probabilities, as the value of “up” increases, the effect of Monte Carlo approach will wane, the output land use map will have less insular land use patches mainly near the boundary between land use types. Theoretically, if a cell has the same possibilities of changing into (or remaining unchanged) other land use types, the probability value should be the reciprocal of the number of land use types. To compromise, a value around the reciprocal of the number of land use types is recommended for “up”. The exact value of “up” can be set by trial simulations for <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>study</b> area.|$|E
