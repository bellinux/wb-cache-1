40|$|Intensive {{computer}} use {{is associated with}} increased risk for musculoskeletal disorders. Past research concerning {{the position of the}} display screen has mainly focused on its vertical position and optimal height. A problem often neglected is the positioning of the screen at an angle to the user due to limited desk space. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of different angled positions of the display screen on neck-shoulder muscle activities. A group of healthy painfree university students (10 males and 10 females) were recruited and muscle activities in the cervical erector spinae (CES) and upper trapezius (UT) muscles were examined. Each subject performed typing tasks for 20 min with a central screen position (CP), angled left position (ALP), and <b>angled</b> <b>right</b> position (ARP). Median muscle activities showed generally higher activities in CES compared to UT. Significant increases were found in ipsilateral CES and contralateral UT muscles in both ALP and ARP. There were also significant increases in subjective discomfort scores in ALP (p= 0. 003) and ARP (p= 0. 009) compared to CP. These results showing higher muscle activities with angled screen positions may indicate greater biomechanical exposure that may in turn contribute to musculoskeletal disorders, especially with prolonged {{computer use}}.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. This three-part study {{examined}} the feasibility of reducing operator radiation exposure during coronary angioplasty. Background. As case loads and complexity increase, some cardiologists are receiving increasing radiation scatter doses. Techniques to reduce this are therefore becoming more important. Methods. First, the determinants of the operator dose were assessed by measuring the differences in scatter dose with different camera views. The relative contribution of fluoroscopy as opposed to cine was then quantified. Finally, operators were provided with these data, and subsequent changes in technique were evaluated. Results. Left anterior oblique views resulted in 2. 6 to 6. 1 times the operator dose of equivalently <b>angled</b> <b>right</b> anterior oblique views. Increasing steepness of the left anterior oblique view also resulted in a progressive increase in operator dose, with left anterior oblique 90 ° causing eight times the dose of left anterior oblique 30 ° and three times that of left anterior oblique 60 °. In the 45 coronary angioplasly cases prospectively analyzed, fluoroscopy {{was found to be}} a greater source of total radiation than cine by a 6. 3 : 1 ratio (range 1. 1 to 15. 8). Once operators were made {{aware of the importance of}} left anterior oblique fluoroscopy, there was a marked reduction in its use. When this was not feasible, there was a reduction in the steepness of the angulation. Left anterior oblique fluoroscopy during angioplasty of the left anterior descending and circumflex coronary arteries was reduced from 40 % of total screening time to ~ 5 %, and left anterior oblique angulation for fluoroscopy during angioplasty of the right coronary artery decreased from 43. 6 ° (± 9. 1 °) to 29. 4 ° (± 2. 2 °). Success rates (90 % vs. 89 %) and screening times (19. 5 vs. 20. 7 min) remained unchanged in 200 coronary angioplasties performed after the study. Average operator radiation dose (Measured by radiation badges worn under lead at waist level) was reduced from 32. 6 to 14. 3 J μSv/operator per week despite a slight increase in case load. Conclusions. Fluoroscopy is the major source of total radiation exposure during coronary angioplasty, with left anterior oblique views providing the highest dose. Modification of views is feasible and will result in significant reduction of operator radiation dose...|$|E

As a function of beam energy this 4 -volume rises sharply in the region 1 GeV <or#approx# E_l_a_b/A <or#approx# 4 GeV and decreases at higher energies. Based on this estimate it is concluded that moderate beam energies {{on the order of}} 10 GeV/u are favourable for studying the restoration of chiral symmetry in baryon-rich matter. At higher energies chiral symmetry restoration is dominated by mesons. Therefore a dedicated machine in the energy regime around 10 GeV/u is needed to study chiral symmetry restoration in baryon-rich matter. Such studies would be complementary to those at SPS-, RHIC- and LHC-energies on meson-dominated chiral-symmetry restoration. (orig.)

40|$|An {{essential}} non-perturbative {{aspect of}} the theory of strong interactions is represented by instantons. Thus, it is of special interest, to investigate their impact in deep inelastic scattering for small values of Bjorken-x_B_j, towards decreasing Q" 2. In particular, it is shown that due to the intrinsic extension scale left <b>angle</b> #rho# <b>right</b> <b>angle</b> of instantons, the latter yield a significant contribution to the much discussed saturation phenomenon. The question of saturation is studied in the colour dipole picture, where one expects an important competition between the dipole size r and the intrinsic instanton scale left <b>angle</b> #rho# <b>right</b> <b>angle.</b> The saturation phenomenon corresponds in this approach to a flattening out of the dipole cross section for larger dipole sizes. A first approach, starts from the known results of instanton perturbation theory and crucially uses information from lattice simulations to continue towards the softer regime. The resulting expressions are then transformed to the colour dipole picture. It is indeed found that in the instanton background, for r >or#sim# left <b>angle</b> #rho# <b>right</b> <b>angle,</b> the rise of the dipole cross section flattens out and tends towards a constant, saturated value #propor to# left <b>angle</b> #rho# <b>right</b> <b>angle</b> " 2 asymptotically. In a second approach, the dipole cross section is investigated within the non-abelian eikonal approximation, where the colour dipole is associated with a Wilson loop describing the interaction with the classical instanton gauge field. The results obtained turn out to be consistent with the first approach and notably, one also observes an analogous saturation behaviour of the dipole cross section. Again, the instanton size left <b>angle</b> #rho# <b>right</b> <b>angle</b> sets the scale for the cross section. (orig.)
