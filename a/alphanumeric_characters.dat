25|$|The Space bar is a {{horizontal}} {{bar in the}} lowermost row, which is significantly wider than other keys. Like the <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>characters,</b> it is also descended from the mechanical typewriter. Its main purpose is to enter the space between words during typing. It is large enough so that a thumb from either hand can use it easily. Depending on the operating system, when the space bar is used with a modifier key such as the control key, it may have functions such as resizing or closing the current window, half-spacing, or backspacing. In computer games and other applications the key has myriad uses {{in addition to its}} normal purpose in typing, such as jumping and adding marks to check boxes. In certain programs for playback of digital video, the space bar is used for pausing and resuming the playback.|$|E
50|$|Each <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>character</b> in the 1401 was encoded by six bits, called B,A,8,4,2,1. The B,A bits {{were called}} zone bits and the 8,4,2,1 bits were called numeric bits, terms {{taken from the}} IBM 80 column punched card.|$|R

500|$|A [...] (or [...] ) clause is {{a string}} of characters, each of which {{represents}} {{a portion of the}} data item and what it may contain. Some picture characters specify the type of the item and how many characters or digits it occupies in memory. For example, a [...] indicates a decimal digit, and an [...] indicates that the item is signed. Other picture characters (called [...] and [...] characters) specify how an item should be formatted. For example, a series of [...] characters define character positions as well as how a leading sign character is to be positioned within the final character data; the rightmost non-numeric character will contain the item's sign, while other character positions corresponding to a [...] to the left of this position will contain a space. Repeated characters can be specified more concisely by specifying a number in parentheses after a picture character; for example, [...] is equivalent to [...] Picture specifications containing only digit (...) and sign (...) characters define purely [...] data items, while picture specifications containing alphabetic (...) or <b>alphanumeric</b> (...) <b>characters</b> define [...] data items. The presence of other formatting characters define [...] or [...] data items.|$|E

5000|$|A keycap is a {{small plastic}} cover placed over the {{keyswitch}} of a computer keyboard. Keycaps are illustrated to indicate the [...] or <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>character</b> they correspond to. Early keyboards were manufactured with the keyswitch and keycap integrated in one unit; separate keycaps were introduced to facilitate the production of different keyboard layouts.|$|R

40|$|A human {{performance}} experiment {{was conducted to}} investigate pixel parameter requirements for three types of flat-panel display images: an <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>character,</b> an oscilloscope waveform, and a real-world image. Subjects performed similarity judgments between an extremely high-quality image and an image composed of different levels of anti-aliasing and pixel width-plus-pixel separation (pitch). It {{was found that the}} effect of pitch had greater influence on perceived image quality for the <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>character</b> and oscilloscope waveform than for the real-world image. The results of this research provide empirical evidence showirg that the pixel pitch requirements for flat-panel systems that are used to display binary, high-contrast images (such as text and waveforms) will be more stringent than for low-contrast pictorial images. The three levels of grey-scale anti-aliasing investigated were found to improve image quality for only the binary, high-contrast images...|$|R
25|$|The {{character}} code produced by any key press {{is determined by}} the keyboard driver software. A key press generates a scancode which is interpreted as an <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>character</b> or control function. Depending on operating systems, various application programs are available to create, add and switch among keyboard layouts. Many programs are available, some of which are language specific.|$|R
50|$|Other early {{computers}} were character oriented, providing instructions for performing arithmetic on character strings of decimal numerals. On these machines the basic data element was an <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>character,</b> typically encoded in six bits. UNIVAC I and UNIVAC II used word addressing, with 12-character words. IBM examples include IBM 702, IBM 705, the IBM 1400 series, IBM 7010, and the IBM 7080.|$|R

5000|$|A {{prominent}} issue {{cited by}} detractors {{is the number}} of stylus strokes required to draw a character. The original Graffiti recognition software required only a single stylus stroke for each <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>character.</b> Graffiti 2, however, required two strokes to draw some commonly used characters. This was perceived as extra work because the default settings for [...] "i" [...] and [...] "t", the fifth and second most frequently-used letters in English, required two strokes. Preferences settings, however, allowed input using single stroke variants for these letters.|$|R
