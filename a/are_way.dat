500|$|The {{music video}} {{received}} mixed reviews from critics, with some arguing that Spears' body was digitally altered.

On August 17, 2008, it was announced that the video was nominated for Best Female Video, Best Pop Video and Video of the Year at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards.

500|$|Sean O'Connell of Cinema Blend {{gave the}} film {{four and a}} half stars out of five, and said it was [...] "the greatest, most {{complete}} and staggeringly entertaining [...] to date". Empire gave it four out of five stars and called it, [...] "The best X-Men film since the second one". [...] Steve Rose of The Guardian rated the film three stars out of five; he said, [...] "Non-devotees might struggle, but director Bryan Singer whips up the action towards a symphonic climax". David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter said, [...] "While it's more dramatically diffuse than the reboot and lacks a definitive villain, the new film is shot through with a stirring reverence for the Marvel Comics characters and their universe". Justin Chang of Variety said, [...] "If the characters' quandaries at times feel overly circumscribed, they're also advanced with a bracing emotional directness, devoid of either cynicism or sentimentalism, that touches genuine chords of feeling {{over the course of the}} film’s fleet 130-minute [...] running time".

500|$|Since the {{previous}} episode [...] "Occupation" [...] {{focused on the}} resistance, writer Ronald D. Moore wanted the second part {{to focus more on}} Jammer's role within the NCP, as he wanted to personalize somebody working for the police force. He also wanted to make Tigh know he's wrong with launching suicide bombers, but has to do so if he believes doing so will defeat the Cylons. This is also Tigh's principal trait and role in the series. Moore stated [...] "why is Colonel Tigh on Galactica? Why does Adama keep him around? Because when the chips are down, and they <b>are</b> <b>way</b> down, baby, in this situation, when you are in a foxhole, who do you want next to you?

[...] The scene where Baltar speaks to an imprisoned Roslin about the suicide bombings was one of Moore's favourite scenes, as he wanted the audience to be unsure who to [...] "root for," [...] since Baltar is the biggest Cylon collaborator among the humans, but Roslin seemingly supports the bombings.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} reviewers found the album overly long, while others felt Feldmann {{was too much}} of an influence.

Other tracks <b>are</b> <b>way</b> too commercial, even for a band the size of blink.... California is {{ultimately}} a step back, rather a throwback." [...] David Anthony from The A.V. Club gave the album a C-, commenting, [...] "California is the sound of Blink-182 desperately trying to remain relevant by outsourcing its creativity. [...] is another homogenous addition to Feldmann's growing résumé. But this time he unintentionally removed the soul of pop-punk's clown princes in the process." [...] Nina Corcoran from Consequence of Sound was similarly negative: [...] "When not cranking the compression on the vocals, Feldmann ruins other songs with nonstop gimmicks: the piano interludes, the stiffened handclaps, the sappy title track." [...] Gwilym Mumford of The Guardian, focusing on the album's turbulent history regarding the departure of DeLonge, deemed the album [...] "a tired – and tiring – work." ...|$|E

500|$|The film's {{reputation}} {{has persisted}} and grown since its release. On Rotten Tomatoes, {{the film has}} an approval rating of 100% based on 41 reviews, with an average rating of 9.1/10.

Frequently identified as James Whale's masterpiece, the film is lauded as [...] "the finest of all gothic horror movies".

In 2008, Bride was selected by Empire magazine as one of The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time. Also in 2008, the Boston Herald named it the second greatest horror film after Nosferatu.

500|$|The game's mission design {{received}} mixed reviews.

Gonzalez {{added that the}} game's variety was sufficient, and is successful in keeping the game interesting. Some critics criticized the game's difficulty curve, and added that the later levels can be frustrating as they are significantly more challenging and demand high levels of time management. Winterhalter however, criticized {{the first half of}} the game, calling it a [...] "tutorial" [...] that must be endured before reaching the better missions, while describing the latter half as addictive. Justin McElroy from Joystiq added that the natural disasters featured <b>are</b> <b>way</b> too unpredictable, and lamented that the game had failed to provide players enough clues when the player failed and destroyed the entire tribe. Tom Francis of PC Gamer echoed similar statements, that the game seldom notified players of their mistakes, and that levels are excessively trial-and-error and feel too stressful for players to play. Jamin Smith of VideoGamer.com criticized the mission structure and objectives for being unrewarding and lacking a sense of progression.|$|E

In 2003, the film topped a poll of [...] "Best Film Endings", and yet it also topped a poll by Film 2003 as [...] "the worst movie of all time". The British film magazine Empire reduced their rating of the film from the maximum five stars and an enthusiastic review, to four stars with a less positive review in a later edition, to accommodate its readers' tastes, who wanted to disassociate themselves from the hype surrounding the film, and the reported activities of its fans, such as those attending multiple screenings. In addition to this, positive and negative parodies and other such spoofs of the film abounded and were circulated on the internet, often inspiring passionate responses from fans of various opinions of the film. Benjamin Willcock of DVDActive.com did not understand the backlash or the passionate hatred for the film.
