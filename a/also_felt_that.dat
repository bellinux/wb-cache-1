5|$|Music critics reacted {{favorably to}} the album, who cited its bombastic {{approach}} and musical composition as highlights. Critics <b>also</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> the album effectively reflected the dance culture in Miami. Club Life: Volume Two Miami performed successfully {{in several countries}} including Canada, Russia, Switzerland and the United States, where it peaked at number sixteen on the Billboard 200.|$|E
5|$|The {{secondary}} battery served several other roles. It was hoped that a medium-calibre shell {{might be able}} to score a hit on an enemy dreadnought's sensitive fire control systems. It was <b>also</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> the secondary armament could {{play an important role in}} driving off enemy cruisers from attacking a crippled battleship.|$|E
5|$|Wharton later {{stated that}} Thin Lizzy {{would have been}} better suited to playing fewer concerts, in bigger venues. He <b>also</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> after the {{experience}} of fronting his own band Dare, it was not satisfying enough to play keyboards behind Gorham and Sykes. Sykes said that all the previous Thin Lizzy members were welcome to play with Thin Lizzy at any time.|$|E
50|$|Reviews of {{the album}} were {{overflowing}} with praise, although those same reviewers <b>also</b> generally <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> it didn't quite measure up to his previous album, 1992's Can You Fly.|$|R
6000|$|The seaman was {{conscious}} of a faint suspicion that Mary was wrestling with another laugh as {{he went off to}} defend the outworks, but he <b>also,</b> happily, <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> the Rock of Gibraltar had been removed from his heart! ...|$|R
60|$|She {{turned to}} him, smiling faintly, {{for the song}} had moved her <b>also,</b> and he <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> he must speak.|$|R
5|$|According to Mihardja, {{religious}} thinkers {{blasted the}} novel for depicting Hasan, whom they interpreted {{as representative of}} religion and religious people, as unable to overcome temptation; they also disliked the novel's lack of in-depth discussion of religion, necessary for {{a better understanding of}} theism. Marxists and anarchists <b>also</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> their ideologies were not well explained. They considered Rusli and Anwar not truly representative of the thoughts of Karl Marx and Friedrich Nietzsche. In response, Mihardja wrote that the characters were meant to be realistic, and that few people have as much knowledge about an ideology as demanded by the critics.|$|E
5|$|Despite debuting with {{moderate}} viewing figures, {{the departure of}} Carell affected the show's ratings, which fell as the season progressed. The season ranked as the eighty-seventh most watched television series during the 2011–12 television year and saw a dramatic decrease in ratings from the previous season. Critical reception was polarized. Many critics argued that the series should have ended after the departure of Carell; many <b>also</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> the season recycled storylines from past episodes. Other critics were more positive, complimenting various actors and their characters. It {{marked the first time}} since season one that the show did not receive any Emmy nominations.|$|E
5|$|Glass Joe's French {{characteristics}} {{have been}} discussed by critics such as writer Sumantra Lahiri and Eurogamer's Oli Welsh. IGN's Craig Harris felt that the NES game focused more on his weaknesses and that the Wii game emphasized his stereotypes. A member of the Retronauts podcast <b>also</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> he was defined more by his weakness than his nationality until he learned more about French stereotypes. Chris Buffa felt that the stereotypes could be considered offensive while Giant Bomb's Ryan Davis {{felt that there was}} nothing legitimately offensive.|$|E
5000|$|Online viewers <b>also</b> <b>felt</b> sympathy <b>that</b> the contestants, {{the host}} {{and even the}} co-hosts (known as [...] "Scientific Assistants") were all facing the [...] "excessive consumption" [...] after the show ended {{in the early months}} of 2014, while criticizing the [...] "wealthy" [...] merchants' consumption.|$|R
2500|$|... may <b>also</b> have <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> he, {{being better}} {{informed}} about the English and the outside world, should have himself seen the change that now seemed to be just around the corner. Sir Syed Ahmad Khan never again wrote a word in praise of the Ai’n-e Akbari and in fact gave up taking active interest in history and archaeology, and became a social reformer.|$|R
50|$|From the beginning, Brzezinski {{made sure}} that the new NSC {{institutional}} relationships would assure him a major voice in the shaping of foreign policy. While he knew that Carter would {{not want him to}} be another Kissinger, Brzezinski <b>also</b> <b>felt</b> confident <b>that</b> the President did not want Secretary of State Vance to become another Dulles and would want his own input on key foreign policy decisions.|$|R
5|$|Historians are {{agreed that}} the {{introduction}} and conclusion were added by a different author {{than that of the}} Libellus. Who that was, however, is open to debate. The historian C. W. David felt that it was {{based on the work of}} the chronicler Symeon of Durham, which thus made a credible date for the creation sometime between 1109 and 1129. David <b>also</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> the Vita was used by a later work of Symeon's, the Historia Regum. Offler, however, felt that although Symeon knew of the Libellus, there was no evidence that he used the Vita, which would leave the author of the Vita unclear.|$|E
5|$|National policy {{relating}} to the Cold War interested Flanders greatly. He {{was concerned about the}} world-wide encroachment of Communism even without force of arms. He felt that President Truman was generally a good president, but was hampered by the Roosevelt legacy of appeasing the Soviets. He <b>also</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> Truman's commitment to bringing the Nationalist and Communist Chinese factions together into an alliance was mistaken. He endorsed the Marshall Plan as a way to avoid Communist influence in Western Europe. However, he was critical of John Foster Dulles, Secretary of State, for mishandling opportunities to create friendly alignment with Egypt and India, countries which instead sided with the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|On 30 March 1945, {{the daily}} comic strip Rikki en Wiske started {{to appear in}} the {{newspaper}} De Nieuwe Standaard, after a positive review by the young illustrator Marc Sleen. It was an immediate success, and the first story ran uninterrupted until 15 December 1945. Vandersteen though was disappointed to see the editor had renamed the strip Rikki en Wiske instead of his suggestion Suske en Wiske, and <b>also</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> Rikki too closely resembled Tintin.|$|E
60|$|This, Miss Schuyler decided, was {{perfectly}} correct, {{so far as}} it went; but she <b>also</b> <b>felt</b> tolerably certain <b>that,</b> while it was commendable, Hetty's loyalty to her father would be strenuously tested, and did not alone account for her restlessness.|$|R
60|$|Lord Belpher was satisfied. He was <b>also</b> relieved. He <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> {{prudence}} and {{a steady}} head had kept him from making himself ridiculous. When George presently returned with the life-saving fluid, he thanked him and turned his thoughts to other things.|$|R
60|$|A tremor {{ran through}} Hetty for she <b>also</b> <b>felt</b> she {{recognized}} <b>that</b> tattered figure. Then {{one of the}} horsemen seized the captive's bridle, and the man made a slight indignant gesture as the jerk flung off his hands. Flora Schuyler closed her fingers tight.|$|R
5|$|Reviewers were {{consistent}} in their praises and {{criticism of the}} album. They noted the high production values {{and the quality of}} the original compositions and the performance of the orchestra. They <b>also</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> the later tracks in the album were notably weaker than the early tracks, that the arrangements in general did not stray far from the source material, and that several of the track choices did not seem to fit as well as orchestral renditions as others.|$|E
5|$|The Dashnaktsutiun held {{a meeting}} on April 26, 1907, dubbed the Fourth General Congress, at which ARF leaders such as Aram Manukian, Hamo Ohanjanyan and Stepan Stepanian {{discussed}} their engagement in the Iranian Constitutional Revolution. They established that the movement was one that had political, ideological and economic components and was thus aimed at establishing law and order, {{human rights and the}} interests of all working people. They <b>also</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> it would work for the benefit and interest of Armenian-Iranians. The final vote was 25 votes in favour and one absentia.|$|E
5|$|The game {{received}} universal acclaim from critics, who {{praised the}} enhanced vehicle physics, updated visuals, and strong sound design. Several reviewers also gave {{high marks for}} the game's Autovista mode. Some critics expressed frustration with Kinect features, and others <b>also</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> the game was not enough of an innovation from its predecessor, Forza Motorsport 3. These critics did, however, concede that the game was a vast improvement over Forza Motorsport 3.|$|E
5|$|Kawada's musical style mainly fuses {{rock with}} trance. When Kawada debuted in 2001, she {{originally}} <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> the music she earned {{in her career}} was pocket money. She <b>also</b> <b>felt</b> happy <b>that</b> she could be based in Sapporo where she could be close to her family and friends, {{as well as to}} I've Sound who she felt was like a second family to her. After Kotoko made her major debut in 2004, I've Sound management began discussing the possibility of Kawada making a major debut. At first, she was hesitant because she <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> she would be thrust into the spotlight, but eventually she accepted the idea. For the first ten years of her career, she always <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> she was a beginner, but this began to change when younger singers made their debuts and began to treat her as an older sister.|$|R
5|$|The Egyptian singer Umm Kulthum {{hosted a}} public celebration for the officers' return despite {{reservations}} from the royal government, {{which had been}} pressured by the British to prevent the reception. The apparent difference in attitude {{between the government and}} the general public increased Nasser's determination to topple the monarchy. Nasser had <b>also</b> <b>felt</b> bitter <b>that</b> his brigade had not been relieved despite the resilience it displayed. He started writing his book Philosophy of the Revolution during the siege.|$|R
25|$|Free Blacks in the South widely {{believed}} that all land would be redistributed {{to those who}} had worked on it. They <b>also</b> <b>felt</b> strongly <b>that</b> they had a right to own this land. Many expected this event to occur by Christmas 1865 or New Year's 1866 Although the freedpeople formed this belief in response to the policies of the Freedmen's Bureau and Circular #13, their hopes were soon downplayed as superstition akin to belief in Santa Claus.|$|R
5|$|The seventh episode {{features}} Stéphane Quême, {{otherwise known}} as DJ Falcon, who spoke of first meeting Daft Punk when the duo began recording their debut album Homework. Quême noted that the group's sound had changed since their debut, and that each of their albums had had a distinct influence. He <b>also</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> the recording of Random Access Memories was such that a producer could potentially sample a track from {{it in the same}} way that Daft Punk themselves had sampled older records in their previous albums. Quême concluded that the duo were always sincere and although their first single was released 20 years ago, it still felt modern.|$|E
5|$|While the {{procession}} was an actual historic event, Matejko took many artistic liberties, such as including persons {{who were not}} in fact present or had died earlier. He did so because he intended the painting to be a synthesis of {{the final years of}} the Commonwealth. He <b>also</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> there was no real historic moment or location that fully captured the spirit of the Constitution, and so he, the artist, needed to create such a moment.|$|E
5|$|Adam Gutschmidt, {{reviewing}} the event for Online Onslaught, gave {{a rating of}} one-quarter star for the Nightstick on a Pole match and one-half star each for the High Energy vs. The Headshrinkers match and the Yokozuna vs. Virgil match. He enjoyed the WWF World Heavyweight Championship match, although he was disappointed by its lack of buildup prior to the event. He <b>also</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> the Flair/Ramon vs. Savage/Perfect match {{was a good one}} until the ending got out of control. Pro Wrestling Torch columnist agreed, stating that the WWF World Heavyweight Championship match was the best and that the Flair/Ramon vs. Savage/Perfect bout was also enjoyable, but he recommended fast-forwarding {{through the rest of the}} show.|$|E
500|$|William distrusted foreigners, {{particularly}} anyone French, {{which he}} acknowledged as a [...] "prejudice". He <b>also</b> <b>felt</b> strongly <b>that</b> Britain should not interfere {{in the internal}} affairs of other nations, which brought him into conflict with the interventionist Foreign Secretary, Lord Palmerston. William supported Belgian independence and, after unacceptable Dutch and French candidates were put forward, favoured Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the widower of his niece, Charlotte, as a candidate for the newly created Belgian throne.|$|R

5|$|After {{being unable}} to win the {{previous}} running of the 6 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps, Dumas said that Porsche had to be focused, remain calm, and ensure that the team did not make any mistakes. Brendon Hartley, driving the No. 1 Porsche vehicle, said he {{was looking forward to}} racing the circuit because it is one of his favourite tracks and he felt {{it would be a good}} race for him and his team-mates. He <b>also</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> his defence of the World Drivers' Championship would be revived at the track following his disqualification from the Silverstone event. Toyota No. 5 car driver Anthony Davidson said that the race would give them an indication of the segments that needed focus on before heading to Le Mans and was looking forward to competing at Spa-Francorchamps. Having missed the previous year's running of the event due to injury, Kazuki Nakajima was pleased to return to the circuit and felt that the race would be better than Silverstone.|$|E
5|$|During a {{visit to}} Pompeii, he lost his passport, {{and went back to}} the amphitheatre he had visited earlier in the day in order to find it. Walking around the deserted ruins, he thought the silence and natural ambient sounds present would make a good {{backdrop}} for the music. He <b>also</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> filming the band without an audience would be a good reaction to earlier films such as Woodstock and Gimme Shelter, where the films paid equal attention to performers and spectators. One of Maben's contacts at the University of Naples, a professor who was a Pink Floyd fan, managed to persuade the local authorities to close the amphitheatre for six days that October for filming.|$|E
5|$|From 1992 to 1995 Reinfeldt was the {{chairman}} of the Moderate Youth League. He ousted the former chairman Ulf Kristersson at the controversial congress known as the Battle of Lycksele, securing 58 of the delegates' votes where Kristersson gained only 55. The congress was controversial because it was the culmination of a long ideological battle within the Moderate Youth League between the conservatives and the libertarians; Reinfeldt represented the conservatives and Kristersson the libertarians. Reinfeldt later stated that although the effects of that deep ideological division and battle in the party lingered on within the Moderate Youth League, he <b>also</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> it was a defining moment in his life. Had he lost the battle he would most likely not be in politics today. From 1995 to 1997 he was chairman of the Democrat Youth Community of Europe.|$|E

5000|$|According to {{the liner}} notes for the CD release, the fictional mineral taranium was {{originally}} called [...] "vitaranium", but was shortened during production {{because of concerns}} about William Hartnell's ability to pronounce it. <b>Also,</b> it was <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> [...] "vitaranium" [...] sounded too much like [...] "vitamin".|$|R
5000|$|Strasser {{was more}} idealistic than Hitler {{and took the}} notion of [...] "socialist" [...] in the party name {{with some degree of}} seriousness. The Communists were a larger factor in the more industrialized north, and Strasser was {{sensitive}} to the appeal that [...] "socialism" [...] had to those dissatisfied workers who were tempted by the red flag. He <b>also</b> apparently <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> the Munich clique was ruled by lesser men, and he chafed under their leadership in Hitler's absence.|$|R
