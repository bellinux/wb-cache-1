[...] Orange Coast praised Nelson's performance of the standards: [...] "Willie Nelson is perhaps the finest male singer in country music [...] his phrasing and sense of understated drama have caused him to be compared with the best jazz singers.

500|$|Sheen had a {{supporting}} role in 2009's , the second film in the highly popular vampire series. In its review, Rolling Stone said: [...] "Late in the film, a real actor, Michael Sheen, shows up as the mind-reading Aro, of the Italian Volturi vampires, and sparks things up. You can <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> young cast thinking, 'Is that acting? It looks hard.' So Sheen is quickly ushered out." [...] While The New York Times said he [...] "preens with plausible menace", USA Today felt he [...] "plays the character with more high-pitched giddiness than menace". He was named Actor of the Year at GQ magazine's annual Men of the Year ceremony. Sheen made two one-off stage appearances in 2009; he performed a scene from Betrayal {{as part of a}} Harold Pinter tribute evening at the National Theatre and performed improvisational comedy as part of The Groundlings' Crazy Joe Show in Los Angeles.|$|E

He wrote, [...] "So, essentially doing a song like this is rocky ground, {{but the good news is}} that Demi generally comes across as the kind of bright, scrappy, girl-next-door type, so it doesn't sound quite so preposterous when she insists that she's still quite normal, really." [...] McAlpine concluded his review, writing, [...] "You can <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> paparazzi cameras going off as she's singing. [...] Of course, the only thing she has to worry about now is that having made this very public declaration, if she slips up for a second, we'll all be watching..." [...] Judy Coleman of The Boston Globe said that Lovato shows [...] "her Gen-Y stripes", and [...] "forcibly rhymes 'everything's the same' with 'the La-La land machine' – pronounced, of course,' ma-SHAYN'." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic noted it as one of the best tracks on Don't Forget. Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic included [...] "La La Land" [...] at number eight on his [...] "Top 10 from the Disney girls" [...] list, and wrote, [...] "Are Disney girls just naturally plagued by insecurity or is it all a plot to seem more real? Like Miley's [...] "Party in U.S.A.," [...] this song is all about how out of place Lovato feels in La La Land." ...|$|E

6000|$|In the {{published}} letters to George Selwyn {{we get a}} mass of correspondence by no means so brilliant and witty as Walpole’s, or so bitter and bright as Hervey’s, but as interesting, and even more descriptive of the time, because the letters are the work of many hands. You hear more voices speaking, as it were, and more natural than Horace’s dandified treble, and Sporus’s malignant whisper. As one reads the Selwyn letters—as one looks at Reynolds’s noble pictures illustrative of those magnificent times and voluptuous people—one <b>almost</b> <b>hears</b> <b>the</b> voice of the dead past; the laughter and the chorus; the toast called over the brimming cups; the shout at the racecourse or the gaming-table; the merry joke frankly spoken to the laughing fine lady.

500|$|William Grimes, {{writing in}} the New York Times, {{described}} The Utility of Force as [...] "a closely argued, searching textbook on strategy and the efficient use of military power in the post-Cold War era". Grimes also {{described it as a}} [...] "difficult, challenging book", saying [...] "you can <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> pointer hit the blackboard as he works his way rigorously through each argument and sub-arguments A, B and C, before proceeding to the next step. At times the history lecture becomes a forced march over very familiar terrain, but patient readers will discover that there is indeed a final destination". In a second review for the New York Times in 2007, Niall Ferguson, a history professor at Harvard University, described The Utility of Force as an update of Clausewitz's On War [...] "for our times". Ferguson went on to criticise Smith for drawing too clear a distinction between [...] "war amongst the people" [...] and [...] "war between peoples", pointing out that in several conflicts there was no single, homogeneous [...] "people" [...] and that wars amongst the people can easily transform into wars between people, citing Bosnia as an example. Ferguson was underwhelmed by Smith's recommendations for the future—Smith believes that new equipment and strategies are required in order for armies to be effective in the new paradigm, but does not offer any suggestions. Ferguson's final criticism was what he described as the book's [...] "limited historical perspective"; Smith argues that [...] "war amongst the people" [...] emerged {{in the second half of}} the 20th century during the proxy wars and de-colonisation campaigns of the Cold War era, but Ferguson gave examples of similar campaigns which pre-dated the Cold War, including the First Boer War (1880–81) and campaigns fought in Eastern Europe during the Second World War. Nonetheless, Ferguson concludes that The Utility of Force is [...] "an impressive and absorbing work", and described Smith as [...] "the Clausewitz of low-intensity conflict and peacekeeping operations".|$|E
500|$|The Los Angeles Times said, [...] " [...] overstuffed with plot lines, set {{pieces and}} villains, {{although}} stars Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone {{do their best}} to give the movie heart." [...] Tim Robey of The Telegraph said, [...] "Marc Webb's Spider-Man sequel is overstuffed with high-voltage villains, but the sparks between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone save the day". Simon Reynolds of Digital Spy said, [...] "Peter's past, present and future all intertwine in a sequel that offers bang for your buck. That said you can't help [...] feel the franchise bean counters at work here thanks to all the ominous foreshadowing and unresolved character arcs. Too many cooks and all that...". Kim Newman of Empire scored the film three out of five stars, saying: [...] "A few too-broad gags aside — and even these are in the funky spirit of '60s Marvel — this is a satisfying second issue with thrills, heartbreak, gasps, and a perfectly judged slingshot ending." [...] Leslie Felperin of The Hollywood Reporter said, [...] "The eponymous hero hits his super-heroic stride here, as does Andrew Garfield in the role, especially when Spider-Man's alter ego Peter Parker learns there's always some fine print in a contract with this many benefits. The plot gets itself tangled up in multiple villain strands, but in the main, this installment is emotionally weightier and more satisfying than its predecessor." [...] Guy Lodge of Variety said, [...] "Redundancy remains a problem, but this overlong superhero sequel gets by on sound, fury and star chemistry." [...] Richard Roeper gave the film a B+, stating that [...] "It's about 20 minutes too long and it's overstuffed with too many characters and too many subplots, but there's enough good stuff in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 to warrant optimism about the next chapter of the franchise." [...] A negative review came from Peter Travers of Rolling Stone, giving the film two stars out of four, he said: [...] "Things go wrong quickly with Amazing 2. Am I the only one who hates the word Amazing to describe a movie that isn't? Just asking." [...] IGN reviewer Daniel Krupa gave 6.9/10 and wrote, [...] "Amazing Spider-Man 2 gets a lot right, yet there’s a constant awkwardness to the machinery of its plot; you can <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> cogs turning. However, what’s worse is that at times it becomes overtly patronising: there are flashing screens and computer voice-overs constantly telling you what something is or what something is doing, just in case the people in the back rows aren’t paying attention, which feels at odds with the film’s emotional intelligence.|$|E

"The Big Show was {{not just}} more grand than most radio shows---it was also more witty, {{smoothly}} produced, smart, and ambitious, with an interesting juxtaposition of guests, but it wasn't significantly different," [...] wrote radio historian Gerald Nachman in Raised on Radio. [...] "It was just a more lavish, inflated revival of radio's earliest form---the variety showcase; you could <b>almost</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> sequins." [...] Yet Nachman admired the show, which he said was [...] "as close to a Broadway show as radio could whip together each week." ...|$|E

5000|$|A {{letter written}} by Stevens in 1921 {{includes}} {{a commentary on}} the poem; he alludes therein to one Miss Fowler at Tufts College who {{wrote a letter to}} the editor of a collection of poetry that included Rosenbloom. Her letter left Stevens uncertain whether she was looking for exegesis or an apology for the editor's choice of the poem. He continues:From time immemorial the philosophers and other scene painters have daubed the sky with dazzle paint. But it all comes down to the proverbial six feet of earth in the end. This is as true of Rosenbloom as of Alcibiades. It cannot be possible that they have never munched this chestnut at Tufts. The ceremonies are amusing. Why not fill the sky with scaffolds and stairs, and go about like genuine realists?The reader of <b>the</b> poem <b>almost</b> <b>hears</b> <b>the</b> tread of the [...] "finical carriers" [...] of Rosenbloom's body in the slow march of this funeral procession. Although the poem's heavy beats leave no doubt that Stevens' naturalism is being expressed, there is a suggestion of ineffability when the tread of the carriers [...] "turns up the sky". The label transcendental naturalism is not ill-suited to characterize the outlook of this and similar poems in Stevens' oeuvre.|$|R
