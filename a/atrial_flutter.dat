40|$|SummaryBackgroundFetal tachycardias {{result in}} serious {{prenatal}} and postnatal morbidity and mortality. Intrauterine treatment can improve prognosis dramatically and the therapeutic protocol is well defined. Currently, amiodarone {{is used as}} third-line therapy and is reserved for refractory cases. AimsOur aim was to review the management and outcome of fetal tachycardia, giving particular consideration to the efficacy and safety of amiodarone therapy. MethodsThis was a retrospective study of 24 consecutive cases of sustained fetal tachycardia, treated mainly with digoxin and/or amiodarone administered by the transplacental route. ResultsThe 24 fetal tachycardias comprised 16 supraventricular tachycardias with 1 : 1 atrioventricular conduction, seven <b>atrial</b> <b>flutters</b> and one ventricular tachycardia. Seven fetuses were hydropic and eight experienced less severe cardiac failure. Digoxin monotherapy converted 5 / 12 non-hydropic fetuses and 0 / 2 hydropic fetuses, with one intrauterine death. Amiodarone monotherapy converted 5 / 5 fetuses, including two hydropic fetuses: one ventricular tachycardia, two <b>atrial</b> <b>flutters</b> and two supraventricular tachycardias. When administered with digoxin, amiodarone converted all but two fetuses (7 / 9). No deaths were associated with amiodarone, but there was moderate morbidity, with six transient elevations of thyroid stimulating hormone at birth, two of which required short-term thyroid hormonal substitution therapy. ConclusionMaternal oral amiodarone seems to be effective and relatively safe, even in hydropic fetuses. We suggest that this treatment could be used earlier than is currently advised...|$|R

25|$|Antiarrhythmic agents, {{also known}} as cardiac {{dysrhythmia}} medications, are a group of pharmaceuticals {{that are used to}} suppress abnormal rhythms of the heart (cardiac arrhythmias), such as atrial fibrillation, <b>atrial</b> <b>flutter,</b> ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation.|$|E
25|$|Digoxin, {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Lanoxin among others, is a {{medication}} used to treat various heart conditions. Most frequently it is used for atrial fibrillation, <b>atrial</b> <b>flutter,</b> and heart failure. Digoxin is taken by mouth or by injection into a vein.|$|E

In the case of <b>atrial</b> <b>flutters</b> the pregnant woman is treated with sotalol administered orally and, if no sinus rhythm is obtained nor a reduced ventricular rhythm occurs, subsequently with digoxin. If there is no hydrops foetalis then this is also the treatment regimen for other forms of foetal supraventricular tachycardia. In the case of hydrops foetalis the treatment is more aggressive: digoxin intravenously or flecanide orally; if the rhythm does not convert into a sinus rhythm nor a reduced ventricular rhythm occurs then both of these medications are administered; if that also proves to be insufficient then direct foetal therapy can be considere...|$|R
25|$|Complications of an {{uncorrected}} secundum ASD include pulmonary hypertension, right-sided heart failure, <b>atrial</b> fibrillation or <b>flutter,</b> stroke, and Eisenmenger's syndrome.|$|R
25|$|AV node {{blockers}} {{should be}} avoided in atrial fibrillation and <b>atrial</b> <b>flutter</b> with WPW or history of it; this includes adenosine, diltiazem, verapamil, other calcium channel blockers, and beta blockers. They can exacerbate the syndrome by blocking the heart's normal electrical pathway (therefore favoring 1:1 atrial to ventricle conduction through the pre-excitation pathway, potentially leading to unstable ventricular arrhythmias).|$|E
25|$|<b>Atrial</b> <b>flutter</b> {{is usually}} well tolerated {{initially}} (a high heart rate is {{for most people}} just a normal response to exercise), however, people with other underlying heart disease or poor exercise tolerance may rapidly develop symptoms, such as shortness of breath, chest pain, lightheadedness or dizziness, nausea and, in some patients, nervousness and feelings of impending doom.|$|E

40|$|Vulnerability to <b>atrial</b> {{fibrillation}} and <b>flutter</b> {{was examined}} in 11 alcohol abusers {{who did not}} have cardiomyopathy or manifest heart failure. Atrial extrastimu-lation was done with rapid pacing (drive cycle length 500 ms) to facilitate induction of atrial vulnerability, seen in four alcohol abusers. The remaining seven were re-tested 30 minutes after drinking 60 to 120 ml of 86 proof whiskey (ethanol blood levels were 49 to 101 mg/ 100 ml but pulmonary capillary wedge pressure remained normal in all) and <b>atrial</b> fibrillation or <b>flutter</b> was induced in three of the drinkers. Three nondrinkers, symptomatic with sinus bradycardia but not in heart failure, were found not to be vulnerable to <b>atrial</b> fibrillation or <b>flutter,</b> but flutter was induced in two of the three after drinking whiskey. Whiskey did not alter atrial functional refractory periods (mean ± standard error of the mean 297 ± 14 to 290 ± 12 ms) or widen the dispersion among three disparate right atrial sites (57 ± 13 to 47 ± 12 ms). Thus, whiskey enhanced vulnerability to <b>atrial</b> fibrillation and <b>flutter</b> in patients without heart failure or cardiomyopathy, substantiating the “holiday heart” syndrome...|$|R

25|$|AF can be {{distinguished}} from <b>atrial</b> <b>flutter</b> (AFL), which appears as an organized electrical circuit usually in the right atrium. AFL produces characteristic saw-toothed F-waves of constant amplitude and frequency on an ECG whereas AF does not. In AFL, the discharges circulate rapidly {{at a rate of}} 300beats per minute (bpm) around the atrium. In AF, there is no regularity of this kind, except at the sources where the local activation rate can exceed 500 bpm.|$|E
25|$|An esophogeal lead can be {{inserted}} to {{a part of}} the esophagus where the distance to the posterior wall of the left atrium is only approximately 5–6mm (remaining constant in people of different age and weight). An esophageal lead avails for a more accurate differentiation between certain cardiac arrhythmias, particularly <b>atrial</b> <b>flutter,</b> AV nodal reentrant tachycardia and orthodromic atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia. It can also evaluate the risk in people with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, as well as terminate supraventricular tachycardia caused by re-entry.|$|E
25|$|Rapid {{heart rates}} may produce {{significant}} symptoms {{in patients with}} pre-existing heart disease {{and can lead to}} inadequate blood flow to the heart muscle and even a heart attack. In rare situations, <b>atrial</b> <b>flutter</b> associated with a fast heart rate persists {{for an extended period of}} time without being corrected to a normal heart rhythm and leads to a tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. Even in individuals with a normal heart, if the heart beats too quickly for a prolonged period of time, this can lead to ventricular decompensation and heart failure.|$|E

30|$|Research also {{suggests}} that scanning patterns are related to diagnostic accuracy. Davies et al. (2016) examined how practitioners perceived electrocardiograms (ECGs) and determined whether visual behaviour can indicate differences in interpretation accuracy. Their results demonstrated {{a difference in the}} gaze behaviour between correct and incorrect interpretations of various heart-related measurements (e.g. identifying hyperkalaemia, torsades de pointes and <b>atrial</b> <b>flutters)</b> and so highlighted this as a factor in interpretation accuracy. Voisin, Pinto, Morin-Ducote, Hudson, and Tourassi (2013) used machine learning to successfully predict radiologists’ errors during the diagnosis of mammographic lesions by merging their gaze behaviour and textural characteristics of the image. Tourassi, Mazurowski, Harrawood, and Krupinski (2010) examined the potential of a context-sensitive computer-assisted detection (CADe) system that is guided by the user’s focus of attention. The context-sensitive mode of the system, which analysed radiologists scanning patterns and diagnostic decisions while inspecting 20 mammograms, reduced radiologists’ perceptual and cognitive errors in the diagnostic interpretation of screening mammograms more effectively than the conventional CADe system. Taken together, the eye-tracking literature indicates that scanning patterns are related to diagnostic accuracy.|$|R
40|$|Catheter {{ablation}} of {{atrial fibrillation}} that targets complex fractionated electrogram sites {{has been widely}} applied {{in the management of}} persistent atrial fibrillation. The clinical outcomes of pulmonary vein isolation alone and pulmonary vein isolation plus the use of complex fractionated electrogram-guided ablation (CFEA) have not been fully compared in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. This prospective study included 70 patients with symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibril-lation that remained inducible after pulmonary vein isolation. For radio-frequency catheter ablation, patients were nonrandomly assigned to a control group (pulmonary vein isolation alone, Group 1, n= 35) or a CFEA group (pulmonary vein isolation plus additional CFEA, Group 2, n= 35). The times to first recurrence of atrial tachyarrhythmias were compared be-tween the 2 groups. In Group 2, CFEA rendered atrial fibrillation noninducible in 16 patients (45. 7 %) and con-verted inducible atrial fibrillation into inducible <b>atrial</b> <b>flutters</b> in 12 patients (34. 3 %). Atrial fi-brillation remained inducible in 7 patients (20 %) after the combined ablation procedures. After a mean follow-up of 23 months, freedom from recurrence of atrial tachyarrhythmia...|$|R
2500|$|Type I <b>atrial</b> <b>flutter,</b> {{also known}} as common <b>atrial</b> <b>flutter</b> or typical <b>atrial</b> <b>flutter,</b> has an atrial rate of 240 to 340 beats/minute. [...] However, this rate may be slowed by {{antiarrhythmic}} agents.|$|E
2500|$|Due to the {{reentrant}} {{nature of}} <b>atrial</b> <b>flutter,</b> {{it is often}} possible to ablate the circuit that causes <b>atrial</b> <b>flutter</b> with radiofrequency catheter ablation. [...] This {{is done in the}} electrophysiology lab by causing a ridge of scar tissue in the isthmus that crosses the path of the circuit that causes <b>atrial</b> <b>flutter.</b> Eliminating conduction through the isthmus prevents reentry, and if successful, prevents the recurrence of the <b>atrial</b> <b>flutter.</b>|$|E

40|$|A recent trial {{unexpectedly}} {{reported that}} atrial fibrillation, when defined as serious, occurred {{more often in}} participants randomized to an annual infusion of the relatively new parenteral bisphosphonate, zoledronic acid, than among those given placebo, but had limited power. Two subsequent population-based case-control studies of patients receiving a more established oral bisphosphonate, alendronic acid, reported conflicting results, possibly due to uncontrolled confounding factors. We used the United Kingdom General Practice Research Database to assess the risk of <b>atrial</b> fibrillation and <b>flutter</b> in women exposed to the oral bisphosphonates, alendronic acid and risedronate sodium. The self-controlled case-series method was used to minimise the potential for confounding. The age-adjusted incidence rate ratio for <b>atrial</b> fibrillation or <b>flutter</b> in individuals during their exposure to these oral bisphosphonates (n = 2195) was 1. 07 (95 % CI 0. 94 - 1. 21). The age-adjusted incidence rate ratio for alendronic acid (n = 1489) and risedronate sodium (n = 649) exposed individuals were 1. 09 (95 % CI 0. 93 - 1. 26) and 0. 99 (95 % CI 0. 78 - 1. 26) respectively. In post-hoc analyses, {{an increased risk of}} incident <b>atrial</b> fibrillation or <b>flutter</b> was detected for patients during their first few months of alendronic acid therapy. We found no robust evidence of an overall long-term increased risk of <b>atrial</b> fibrillation or <b>flutter</b> associated with continued exposure to the oral bisphosphonates, alendronic acid and risedronate sodium. A possible signal for an increase in risk during {{the first few months of}} therapy with alendronic acid needs to be re-assessed in additional studies...|$|R
