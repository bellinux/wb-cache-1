5|$|At Chuck and Sarah's {{rehearsal}} dinner, Morgan tells Alex that he {{will stop}} going on missions and simply become an analyst. Chuck's sister Ellie (Sarah Lancaster) is unable {{to make her own}} video montage, having previewed and rejected Lester's deeply disturbed first cut. However, Jeff offers his own flawless cut of the montage, being rewarded with a kiss from Ellie. During the video, Chuck gets a phone call from Vivian, who intends to make him suffer. Vivian activates the Norseman device on a target at the dinner, who Chuck initially fears is his mother. Suddenly, Sarah's nose starts to bleed and she collapses in Chuck's arms <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> out for help.|$|E
5|$|Mike visits Zoe in prison, despite Lydia {{manipulating}} him, and Zoe is able {{to convince}} him that she was not to blame for Sarah's death. During her trial, Mike tells the court he believes his daughter committed suicide, and Zoe is found not guilty and is released. She then decides to expose Lydia as Sarah's killer. Zoe moves in with Mike and Lydia, and tells Lydia that her feelings towards her have changed. The pair share a kiss, just as Mike and Amy walk in. Mike then tells Zoe to leave. Lydia discovers that Zoe is using her, and plots revenge. On New Year's Eve, she gets Zoe to meet her in a church, so they can admit their 'relationship' to Sarah. Zoe initially goes along with this, but then changes her mind, runs out and is knocked unconscious. Zoe {{is able to}} get a confession from Lydia, before running away again. She is startled to see Sarah's grave for the first time. Lydia finds Zoe and stabs her as Charlotte Lau (Amy Yamazaki), Dave Colburn (Elliot James Langridge) and Mike arrive. Mike then cradles Zoe <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> an ambulance.|$|E
25|$|The Black Death ravaged Ireland 1348–49. One of {{the most}} vivid {{accounts}} of the plague was written by Friar John Clyn at Kilkenny, who thought that all mankind might die. He reports that particularly in the months of September and October, 1348, people came from all over Ireland to St. Mullins, County Carlow, including many no doubt from County Wexford, out of fear, to seek divine protection from the 'pestilence' <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> it – {{as it was then}} very prevalent. He comments on how it was rare for only one member of a family to die, but that usually the entire family was wiped out. John Clyn himself is believed to have died in 1349 from the plague.|$|E

25|$|That 1975 map, {{the first}} Cahill-Keyes projection, {{launched}} a decades long quest to perfect it. One of his goals is a map with a 1:1 million scale, {{about half the}} size of a football field. Each one degree geocell would be large enough to stand in. While the physical Master Map <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> it, remains a dream, in 2010, his partner Mary Jo Graça, using Keyes's extensive calculations, plotted the entire projection and in 2011 digitized the entire map. Absent the physical version, a 9,000 square foot pdf of that full size map can be easily navigated on a home computer. It is the first contiguous world map at a resolution showing all one-degree geocells (except five degrees at the poles). Keyes likewise commissioned the first-ever one-degree globe from Joe Roubal in 2013.|$|E
25|$|Since Korellian law forbids Foundation missionaries {{to be on}} {{the planet}} under penalty of death, the crew determines that the Reverend Jord Parma of Anacreon (<b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> himself) had been {{captured}} by the Korellians but managed to escape before being killed. Rev. Parma is injured, apparently mentally confused, and in need of hospitalization. A short time after Parma has been aboard the ship, an angry mob appears, surrounding the Far Star, and demanding that the missionary be turned over to them as an escaped criminal. This rapid response by the Korellians in what is an extremely remote location arouses Mallow's suspicions: Where did Parma actually escape from? Why was there a mob seemingly already gathered in the middle of nowhere? And how were they able to pinpoint the location of the Far Star and surround it so promptly after Parma boarded the ship? Suspecting a set-up, rather than fight the mob, Mallow decides to turn the missionary over to them (and to certain death), despite Twer's frantic attempt to intervene. Soon afterwards, Mallow is invited to meet with Korell's authoritarian ruler, Commdor ("First Citizen Of The State") Asper Argo, indicating that Mallow had apparently passed a test by the Korellians by showing respect for their laws. Argo appears friendly and welcomes Foundation technological gifts; however, he refuses to allow Scientism on Korell, and Mallow agrees not to encourage missionary work in the Republic.|$|E
500|$|With Aldimir's {{appointment}} as despot of Kran, Smiltsena ensured that his lands were better protected from Smilets' brothers Radoslav and Voysil who, as émigrés in Byzantium, held aspirations for the Bulgarian throne {{or at least}} their former domains. During Smiltsena's regency, Aldimir {{was one of the}} most influential people in Bulgaria; indeed, Byzantine statesman Theodore Metochites refers to the [...] "Scythian [...] venturer", <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> Aldimir, as the queen's right-hand man. Aldimir's leading position leaves little doubt that he was involved in the fruitless anti-Byzantine negotiations between Bulgaria and Serbia in 1299. Pavlov even goes as far as to suggest that the proposed anti-Byzantine union was the brainchild of Aldimir.|$|E

Near the end of the game, he stands by Fujin's plea to the party to help save Seifer from himself. In the ending FMV, he celebrates catching a large fish until Fujin kicks him into the water. In battle, Raijin uses thunder-based magic and a bō staff with large weights on either end. He shares his name with the Japanese god of thunder, Raijin.|$|E
500|$|Russell's view {{of human}} nature, like that of Thomas Hobbes, is {{somewhat}} pessimistic. By Russell's account, the desire to empower oneself is unique to human nature. No other animals besides Homo sapiens, he argues, are capable of being so unsatisfied with their lot, that they should try to accumulate more goods than meet their needs. The [...] "impulse to power", <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> it, does not arise unless one's basic desires have been sated. (Russell 1938:3) Then the imagination stirs, motivating the actor to gain more power. In Russell's view, the love of power is nearly universal among people, although it takes on different guises from person to person. A person with great ambitions may become the next Caesar, but others may be content to merely dominate the home. (Russell 1938:9) ...|$|E
500|$|The English ornithologists Douglas Dewar and Frank Finn {{write in}} their book The Making of Species that Thayer [...] "seems to be of opinion that all animals are cryptically or, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> it, concealingly or obliteratively coloured". They note that Edward Bagnall Poulton had written approvingly of Thayer, and that Thayer had {{asserted}} that almost all animals were countershaded. They agree that countershading exists, but to his suggestion that it is universal [...] "we feel sorely tempted to poke fun at him", and promptly ask any reader who agrees with Thayer that every animal is countershaded {{to look at a}} flock of rooks at sunset. They admit that camouflage is in general advantageous, but point out that the different plumages of seasonally and sexually dimorphic birds cannot all be explained as camouflage, considering the conspicuous colours of the male birds: ...|$|E

500|$|... "Jane {{is engaged}} by Lord Rochester's housekeeper, during his absence from home, and her first meeting with her {{employer}} is both exciting and romantic. She is sitting by {{the edge of the}} road reading when Lord Rochester rides up to his ancestral home. The sight of his huge dog, coming upon her suddenly, so startles Jane that she jumps to her feet, causing Lord Rochester's horse to shy and throw its rider. He injures his ankle, and has to be assisted to remount by 'the little witch,' <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> her, who is the cause of his accident. One evening the maniac escapes from her nurse and sets fire to the room in which Lord Rochester has fallen asleep. He is saved from a horrible death by Jane. When next Jane's haughty aunt and cousins call upon Lord Rochester, they are just in time to be introduced to his bride, who is none other than the despised Jane Eyre." ...|$|E
500|$|After a {{night out}} with Sam Kingston (Scott Wright), Toyah decides to walk home alone but is {{attacked}} and raped. Toyah is found by Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas), who takes her home. Janice initially thinks Toyah has been robbed and is shocked when Toyah tells her she was raped. Toyah gives {{a statement to the}} police and is examined at the hospital. Several male residents are suspected, particularly Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne), but they are ruled out by DNA tests. Toyah struggles to deal with what has happened to her and she develops agoraphobia. While being comforted at home by her friend, Phil Simmonds (Jack Deam), Toyah recognises his voice <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> out her name and realises that he raped her. Phil realizes that she knows and stops her escaping but Peter hears Toyah's screams and rescues her after knocking Phil unconscious. Phil is found guilty of rape and sent to prison. Toyah has a brief romance with Sam and moves into a flat with Fiz Brown (Jennie McAlpine) and Maria Sutherland (Samia Ghadie).|$|E
500|$|Scholars have {{differed}} on {{the issue}} of what is to be made of Mr. Dooley and the often bizarre things Dunne placed in his mouth: whether Dooley is intended to believe that he is a cousin of Admiral Dewey, or that [...] "Mack" [...] (<b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> President McKinley) has actually said the seemingly unlikely things that the barkeeper relates.

Blair contended that Dooley knows only what he reads in the Evening Post and other papers, and gullibly believes quotations he has heard without attribution from his customer Hogan were made up by that bookish patron. Dunne wrote in 1898 that Dooley [...] "reads the newspapers with solemn care, heartily hates them, and accepts all they print for the sake of drowning Hennessy's rising protests against his logic".|$|E

2500|$|In {{the first}} section of the Enquiry, Hume {{provides}} a rough introduction to philosophy as a whole. For Hume, philosophy can be split into two general parts: natural philosophy and the philosophy of human nature (or, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> it, [...] "moral philosophy"). The latter investigates both actions and thoughts. He emphasizes in this section, by way of warning, that philosophers with nuanced thoughts will likely be cast aside in favor of those whose conclusions more intuitively match popular opinion. However, he insists, precision helps art and craft of all kinds, including the craft of philosophy.|$|E

He further noted that the spirit of capitalism could be divorced from religion, and that those passionate capitalists of his era were either passionate against the Church or at least indifferent to it.
