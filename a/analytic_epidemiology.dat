Specifically, we derive log-likelihood functions for finite mixtures of regression models involving counts that come from a Poisson distribution, as well as a negative binomial distribution when the counts are significantly overdispersed. Within our proposed modeling framework, we carry out optimal component selection using the information criteria scores AIC, BIC, CAIC, and ICOMP. We demonstrate applications of our approach on simulated data, as well as on a real data set of HIV cases in Tennessee counties from the year 2010. Finally, using a genetic algorithm within our framework, we perform variable subset selection to determine the covariates that are most responsible for categorizing Tennessee counties.

40|$|The sociocultural {{environment}} exerts {{a fundamental}} influence on health. Interventions to improve education, housing, employment, {{and access to}} health care contribute to healthy and safe environments and improved community health. The Task Force on Community Preventive Services (the Task Force) has conducted systematic reviews of early childhood development interventions and family housing interventions. The topics selected provide a unique, albeit small, beginning of the review of evidence that interventions do effectively address sociocultural factors that influence health. Based on these reviews, the Task Force strongly recommends publicly funded, center-based, comprehensive early childhood development programs for low-income children aged 3 - 5 years. The basis for the recommendation is evidence of effectiveness in preventing developmental delay, assessed by improvements in grade retention and placement in special education. The Task Force also recommends housing subsidy programs for low-income families, which provide rental vouchers for use in the private housing market and allow families choice in residential location. This recommendation is based on outcomes of improved neighborhood safety and families' reduced exposure to violence. The Task Force concludes that insufficient evidence is available on which to base a recommendation for or against creation of mixed-income housing developments that provide safe and affordable housing in neighborhoods with adequate goods and services.

40|$|Reducing {{morbidity}} and mortality and improving {{quality of life for}} persons with diabetes is an ongoing challenge for health-care providers and organizations and public health practitioners. Interventions are available that focus on persons with diabetes, health-care systems, families, and public policies. The Task Force on Community Preventive Services (the Task Force) has conducted systematic reviews of seven population-oriented interventions that can be implemented by health-care organizations and communities. Two of these interventions focus on health-care systems (disease and case management), and five focus on persons with diabetes (diabetes self-management education delivered in community settings). On the basis of these reviews, the Task Force has made recommendations regarding use of these seven interventions. The Task Force strongly recommends disease and case management in health-care systems for persons with diabetes. Diabetes self-management education is recommended in community gathering places (e. g., community centers or faith institutions) for adults and in the home for children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. Evidence was insufficient to recommend diabetes self-management education interventions in other settings (i. e., schools, work sites, and recreational camps) or in the home for adults with type 2 diabetes.

40|$|Objective To {{design a}} functional, patient-centered model of patient {{complexity}} with practical applicability to analytic design and clinical practice. Existing literature on patient complexity has mainly identified its components descriptively and in isolation, lacking clarity {{as to their}} combined functions in disrupting care or to how complexity changes over time. Study design and setting The authors developed a cumulative complexity model, which integrates existing literature and emphasizes how clinical and social factors accumulate and interact to complicate patient care. A narrative literature review is used to explicate the model. Results The model emphasizes a core, patient-level mechanism whereby complicating factors impact care and outcomes: the balance between patient workload of demands and patient capacity to address demands. Workload encompasses the demands on the patient's time and energy, including demands of treatment, self-care, and life in general. Capacity concerns ability to handle work (e. g., functional morbidity, financial/social resources, literacy). Workload-capacity imbalances comprise the mechanism driving patient complexity. Treatment and illness burdens serve as feedback loops, linking negative outcomes to further imbalances, such that complexity may accumulate over time.

40|$|Background: Decreasing {{rates of}} {{participation}} in population-based studies increasingly challenge the interpretation of study results, in both <b>analytic</b> and descriptive <b>epidemiology.</b> Consequently, estimates of possible differences between participants and non-participants are increasingly important for the interpretation of study results and generalization to the background population. Methods: An age-specific, population-based cohort of 1, 198 individuals was examined at age 40, 45, 51, and 60. Participants were compared with non-participants and when possible also with the background population using {{a wide range of}} detailed information on somatic and mental health collected at each examination, including data from a clinical examination, biochemical measurements, questionnaires, interviews, and public registers. Results: Participation rates were higher than 80 % at examinations at age 40, 45, and 51, but decreased to 65 % at age 60. At the baseline investigation at age 40, analyses indicated that participants were representative of the cohort as well as the background population. However, the mortality rate was higher among non-participants in the succeeding 20 years. Among living cohort members at the 60 -year examination, non-participants had lower socioeconomic status, higher hospitalization rate, and a worse overall health profile than participants. Conclusions: The detailed data presented reinforce the contention that the health profile of non-participants is typically worse than that of participants.

40|$|Objective: We {{sought to}} develop an {{intensive}} care unit research database applying automated techniques to aggregate high-resolution diagnostic and therapeutic data from a large, diverse population of adult intensive care unit patients. This freely available database is intended to support epidemiologic research in critical care medicine {{and serve as a}} resource to evaluate new clinical decision support and monitoring algorithms. Design: Data collection and retrospective analysis. Setting: All adult intensive care units (medical intensive care unit, surgical intensive care unit, cardiac care unit, cardiac surgery recovery unit) at a tertiary care hospital. Patients: Adult patients admitted to intensive care units between 2001 and 2007. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: The Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care II (MIMIC-II) database consists of 25, 328 intensive care unit stays. The investigators collected detailed information about intensive care unit patient stays, including laboratory data, therapeutic intervention profiles such as vasoactive medication drip rates and ventilator settings, nursing progress notes, discharge summaries, radiology reports, provider order entry data, International Classification of Diseases, 9 th Revision codes, and, for a subset of patients, high-resolution vital sign trends and waveforms. Data were automatically deidentified to comply with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act standards and integrated with relational database software to create electronic intensive care unit records for each patient stay. The data were made freely available in February 2010 through the Internet along with a detailed user's guide and an assortment of data processing tools. The overall hospital mortality rate was 11. 7 %, which varied by critical care unit. The median intensive care unit length of stay was 2. 2 days (interquartile range, 1. 1 - 4. 4 days). According to the primary International Classification of Diseases, 9 th Revision codes, the following disease categories each comprised at least 5 % of the case records: diseases of the circulatory system (39. 1 %); trauma (10. 2 %); diseases of the digestive system (9. 7 %); pulmonary diseases (9. 0 %); infectious diseases (7. 0 %); and neoplasms (6. 8 %). Conclusions: MIMIC-II documents a diverse and very large population of intensive care unit patient stays and contains comprehensive and detailed clinical data, including physiological waveforms and minute-by-minute trends for a subset of records.

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{is part of}} the Social Values in Medical Research track. Here again we are back at the basic difference of attitude adopted by sociologists and anthropologists toward their raw material. The statistical sociologist takes it for granted that the truth which he is seeking is contained in his questionnaire answers and that the mathematical technique is capable of revealing that truth [...] . it is in the very nature of questionnaire investigation that the “results” tend to err in the direction of ideal stereotypes. Hence any attempt to investigate, by questionnaire research, the degree of fit between an ideal stereotype and actual practice is a waste of time. (Leach, 1967) Questioning claims to objectivity, both in terms of its plausibility and presumed value, have become canonical activities within feminist philosophy of science. The continued relevance of the citation from Leach suggests both the historicity and the contemporary pull of this critique; it also hints at the possibility of understanding the ontological and epistemological problematization of an objectivist stance as being intimately connected to an ethical one. Drawing from a range of philosophical literature, including that of Charles Taylor, Bruno Latour and Michel Foucault, as well as fifteen months of qualitative research within an inner city community, I argue that the objectivist models of human activities employed within epidemiology presuppose a clear distinction between description and evaluation, contributing to an understanding of social reality as consisting of brute data. This ultimately misconstrues modes of social relations as individual actions or behaviours, and in so doing contributing to the persistence of harmful social identities, stereotypes and tropes. By focusing on factors that influence the health of populations, epidemiology provides the foundation of public health and preventive medicine practices. Alan Peterson explains the relationship between epidemiological risk analysis and health services, saying, “epidemiology has become so central to the public health endeavor of identifying, reducing exposure to, or eliminating ‘risks’ that it has become almost synonymous with the public health enterprise itself” (Peterson 1997, p. 197). Social epidemiology, a subfield of <b>analytic</b> <b>epidemiology,</b> examines the relationships between broadly defined socio-behavioural and socioeconomic factors and poor health, and is thus a particularly important source of data for surveillance and public health interventions, including those related to HIV/AIDS. Given this fundamental relationship between epidemiology and the public health enterprise, I consider how, within the context of HIV, this relationship between may assist in perpetuating problematic and harmful social identities. Due to an explosive HIV epidemic in the mid-nineties, the inner city of Vancouver, British Columbia (commonly referred to as the Downtown Eastside) is a highly studied space. The plethora of research surrounding access and adherence to HIV care provides an opportunity to examine the processes by which presumed authority and objectivity within the production of scientific knowledge may confer inadvertent consequences and latent effects. Employing categorizations of barriers to care and risks for non-adherence that are amenable to survey format, studies examine self-regulatory efficacy, medication beliefs, as well as the ability to make certain kinds of projections to the future, i. e. outcome and efficacy expectations. As I examine in this paper, the emphasis on so-called “life skills” can be read as part of the neo-liberal rationality (Peterson, p. 197 - 198), given the emphasis on self-management; the “unhealthy” body thereby designating an individual who lacks control, responsibility and autonomy. Surveillance measures justify a “will to empower,” and are at once totalizing and individualizing— risk group abbreviations (FSWs, IDUs) cement these subjectivities as a given. The failure of those in the inner city to adequately perform self-managing activities {{in the course of their}} HIV care is construed as transgression and deviance, while the resultant pathologies mark them as belonging to a uniform population of similar “kinds” of at-risk caricatures. Although it has become commonplace in the research community to examine so-called environmental factors in access and adherence studies, more often than not these simply reinforce the notion of the community as itself pathological, leading to an additional source of stigma for residents. Moreover, merely reciting a litany of “structural” barriers, in terms of housing shortages and challenges, quantity of time spent interfacing with the correctional system etc., without engaging in methodologies that move away from individual behaviour and causal explanations, does little to examine the multifarious ways in which different institutions are interconnected, how they must simultaneously be negotiated, or the relationship between daily interpersonal interactions and the norms and ideologies of larger structures—a viewpoint that prioritizes the presumed rationality of a biomedical perspective. While I don’t deny that one’s mental life, living arrangements, and the effects of on-going substance use play a role in antiretroviral adherence, I argue here that the emphasis on individual cognitive components of adherence and proxy measures of “structure” detach the act of ingesting medicines from meanings attached to the act, as well as from the relationships individuals have within the health care system. The rationalizing language employed in the analyses imply a cause-effect relationship between the variables under study—while this may be useful for program and policy advocacy, the analyses nonetheless fail to capture the complexity of adherence as a social phenomena; phenomena that cannot be entirely or even adequately understood through cross-sectional data. In the context of HIV, an ethical problem emerges. Describing individual actions as “data,” or “fact,” constructs and entrenches transgressive social identities. As Michel de Certeau suggests, with respect to realism and historical analysis, claiming to represent reality camouflages the practices that determine the representation presented (de Certeau, in Scott 1991, p. 777). The oft-cited limitations of cross-sectional study fail to address the rhetorical implications of causal-type explanation and claims to representativeness, particularly when studies suggest that the lack of direction of observation ought to be addressed by creating new prospective cohorts.
