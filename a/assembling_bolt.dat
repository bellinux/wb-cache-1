40|$|Most {{identification}} {{methods in}} non-linear structural dynamics assume in advance {{a mathematical model}} of the non-linearities. This is however possible in specific situations only, since non-linear effects {{may be caused by}} numerous phenomena and a priori knowledge is generally limited. The present paper investigates the usefulness of piecewise third-order polynomials, termed cubic splines, to identify the complex non-linear dynamics of solar arrays in their stowed configuration. The estimation of the model parameters is achieved using the frequency-domain non-linear subspace identification (FNSI) method. A distinct advantage of the FNSI approach is its capability to calculate accurately a large number of parameters, while maintaining an acceptable computational burden. This makes tractable the use of cubic splines to represent non-linearity in real-life mechanical systems, as the dimensionality of the inverse problem is known to increase dramatically in this case. The experimental structure of interest consists of two parallel aluminium plates <b>assembled</b> with <b>bolted</b> connections.

Automotive fuel cells are likely to operate with neat hydrogen under load-following or load-levelled modes and be expected to withstand variations in environmental conditions, particularly in the context of temperature and atmospheric composition. In addition, they are also required to survive over the course of their expected operational lifetimes i. e., around 5, 500 hrs, while undergoing as many as 30, 000 startup/shutdown cycles.

40|$|International audienceAeronautical {{structures}} are commonly <b>assembled</b> with <b>bolted</b> joints in which friction phenomena, {{in combination with}} slapping in the joint, provide damping on the dynamic behavior. Some models, mostly nonlinear, have consequently been developed and the harmonic balance method (HBM) is adapted to compute nonlinear response functions in the frequency domain. The basic idea is to develop the response as Fourier series and to solve equations linking Fourier coefficients. One specific HBM feature is that response accuracy improves {{as the number of}} harmonics increases, at the expense of larger computational time. Thus this paper presents an original adaptive HBM which adjusts the number of retained harmonics for a given precision and for each frequency value. The new proposed algorithm is based on the observation of the relative variation of an approximate strain energy for two consecutive numbers of harmonics. The developed criterion takes the advantage of being calculated from Fourier coefficients avoiding time integration and is also expressed in a condensation case. However, the convergence of the strain energy has to be smooth on tested harmonics and this constitutes a limitation of the method. Condensation and continuation methods are used to accelerate calculation. An application case is selected to illustrate the efficiency of the method and is composed of an asymmetrical two cantilever beam system linked by a bolted joint represented by a nonlinear LuGre model. The practice of adaptive HBM shows that, for a given value of the criterion, the number of harmonics increases on resonances indicating that nonlinear effects are predominant. For each frequency value, convergence of approximate strain energy is observed. Emergence of third and fifth harmonics is noticed near resonances both on vibratory responses and on approximate strain energy. Parametric studies are carried out by varying the excitation force amplitude and the threshold value of the adaptive algorithm. Maximal amplitudes of vibration and frequency response functions are plotted for three different points of the structure. Nonlinear effects become more predominant for higher force amplitudes and consequently the number of retained harmonics is increased...|$|R
40|$|Many {{engineering}} {{parts in}} industries are <b>assembled</b> by rivets, <b>bolts,</b> pins etc. These joints {{are more vulnerable}} to fatigue loadings and a crack is emanated. As structure is in use crack starts propagating {{over a period of}} time. Crack propagation can be obstructed by inducing a compressive residual stress zone around the vulnerable parts. Cold expansion hole (CEH) is one of the techniques used to induce compressive stress zone, by inserting a tapered pin or a large diameter ball into an undersized hole. As the oversized object is inserted into the hole, the surrounding material is elastically deformed and when the object comes out from the other side, the expanded material springs back to form tangential compressive residual stress around the hole. In most of the cases the crack origins on the surface, a good surface finish is also an important parameter for increasing the strength at the surface and stop crack emanation. However, good surface finish is not achieved by CEH. A novel technique called rotating tool cold expansion (RTCE) technique is developed where a tapered mandrel is inserted into an undersized hole besides rotating it simultaneously. The tool rotation breaks down the coarse grains into fine grain structure achieving good surface finish. In this method, RTCE is performed with three undersized diameters, namely, 9. 2, 9. 5 and 9. 9 mm diameters to a maximum of 10 mm diameter. The tool material is high speed steel and the work piece material is commercial aluminium. The induced residual stresses are measured using X-ray diffraction method and compared for three different Cold expansion holes. Due to the rotation of the tool, heat is generated because of both friction at the interface and plastic deformation. A 3 -D thermo-mechanical analysis is performed in ANSYS FEA for different values of coefficient of friction and plastic deformation rate and validated with experimental results. Compared to the degree of cold expansion through conventional techniques (upto 4 %) the proposed technique is capable to produce good results up to 8. 69 % of cold expansion. Role of heat generated through friction and plastic deformation is critical to attain the best possible result, equal contributions of both are important...|$|R

The model is shown {{to be able to}} understand the many interacting, complex electrochemical, transport phenomena, and stresses distribution that have limited experimental data.

40|$|Concrete {{technology}} has been in changeful evolution since the Roman Empire time. It is remarkable that the technological progress became of higher magnitude from {{the second part of}} the XX Century. Advances in the development of new cements, the appearance of the fibers as a reinforcement for structural applications, and specially the grand progress in the field of the water reducing admixtures enabled the emergence of several types of special concretes. One of the lasts is the Ultra High Performance Fiber Reinforced Concrete (UHPFRC), which incorporates advances of the Self-Compacting Concrete (SCC), Fiber-Reinforced Concrete (FRC) and Ultra High Strength Concrete (UHSC) technology. This exclusive material requires a detailed analysis of the components compatibility and a high control of the materials and processes. Mainly patented products have been used for the few structural elements carried out so far today, but the costs makes doubtful the development of many other potential applications. In accordance with the previously explained, a simplification of the UHPFRC components and processes is needed. This becomes the first main goal of this Ph. D. thesis, which emphasizes in the use of local available components and simpler mixing processes. Moreover, the singular properties of this material, between ordinary concrete and steel, allow not only the realization of slenderer structures, but also the viability of new concepts unthinkable with ordinary concrete. In this field is focused {{the second part of the}} Ph. D. thesis, which develops a bolted connection system between UHPFRC elements. This research summarizes, first of all, the subfamilies belonging to the HPC-UHPC materials. Afterwards, it is provided a detailed comparison between the dosage and properties of more than a hundred of mixtures proposed by several authors in the last ten years of technology. This becomes a useful tool to recognize correlations between dosages and properties and validate or no preconceived ideas about this material. Based on this state of art analysis was performed the later development of mixtures, on Chapter 4, which analized the effect of use of simpler components and processes on the UHPFRC. The main idea was use local components available in the Spanish market, identifying the combinations that provide the best rheological and mechanical properties. Steam curing use was avoided since a process simplification is intended. Diferent dosages were developed to be adapted to various levels of performance, and always trying to be as economical as possible. The concretes designed were selfcompacting and mainly combined two fiber types (hybrid), as the flexural performance was of greater relevance. The compressive strength obtained varied in the range between 100 and 170 MPa (cube L= 100 mm), and the flexural strength between 15 and 45 MPa (prism 100 x 100 x 500 mm). Some of the components introduced are very rarely used in UHPFRC, as limestone coarse aggregate or FC 3 R, a white active residue from the petrol industry. As a result of the research, some simple and practical tips are provided for designers of UHPFRC dosage. At the end of this chapter, five dosages are characterized as examples of useful concretes for different requirement applications. In a second part, the idea of a bolted joint connection between UHPFRC elements was proposed. The connection system would be especially useful for struts and ties elements, as truss structures. The possible UHPFRC failure modes were introduced and two different types of tests were designed and performed to evaluate the joint capacity. The geometry of the UHPFRC elements was modified in order to correlate it with the failure mode and maximum load reached. Also a linear finite element analysis was performed to analyze the UHPFRC elements connection. This supported the results of the experimental tests to deduce formulations that predict the maximum load for each failure mode. Finally, a real size truss structure was <b>assembled</b> with <b>bolted</b> joints and tested to verify the good structural behavior of these connections. To conclude, some applications designed and developed at the Universitat Politècnica de València with the methods and knowledge acquired on UHPFRC are abstracted. In many of them the material was mixed and poured in a traditional precast concrete company, providing adequate rheological and mechanical results. This showed the viability of simpler UHPFRC technology enabling some of the first applications in Spain with this material. Camacho Torregrosa, EE. (2013).
