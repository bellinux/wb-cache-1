Along with the beach itself, Kitsilano Beach Park also {{contains}} a franchise restaurant, Kitsilano Pool, and the Kitsilano Showboat. The Kitsilano Showboat, operating since 1935, is essentially an open-air amphitheatre with the ocean and mountains as a backdrop. <b>All</b> <b>summer</b> <b>long,</b> the showboat hosts free performances from local bands, dance groups, and other performers. Its main goal is to entertain residents and tourists, showcasing amateur talent. It {{is located on the}} south side of the Kitsilano Pool along Cornwall Avenue. Weather permitting, shows typically start at 7:30p.m. on Mondays, Wednesday, and Fridays. Beatrice Leinbach, or Captain Bea, has been playing an active role in maintaining the showboat since the mid-1940s. As of 2006, she is the president of the non-profit Kitsilano Showboat Society.|$|E

500|$|After {{appearing}} in television commercials for Winston cigarettes and Coca-Cola, Baker {{was featured in}} an episode of Monodrama Theater performing a monodramatic piece, which was broadcast in 1952 on the DuMont Network. The following year, she made her film debut with a small walk-on part in the musical Easy to Love (1953). This led to her landing roles in two Broadway productions: Roger MacDougall's Escapade {{in the fall of}} 1953, and Robert Anderson's <b>All</b> <b>Summer</b> <b>Long,</b> opposite Ed Begley, which ran from September to mid-November 1954. In 1955, she screen tested and auditioned for the lead role in Picnic, but lost the part to Kim Novak.

500|$|Reviews for [...] "Tempest" [...] {{were mostly}} positive. The Futon Critic's Brian Ford Sullivan {{felt that the}} season finale gave every element the [...] "four-star treatment", and that the cliffhanger ending was [...] "riveting" [...] enough to leave the {{reviewer}} in anticipation <b>all</b> <b>summer</b> <b>long</b> of the season two premiere. Sullivan {{would go on to}} rank [...] "Tempest" [...] as the fifteenth best television episode of 2002. Jonathan Boudreaux, a reviewer for TVDVDReviews.com, felt the episode was one of the season's strongest, thanks to the focus on characters, with [...] "kryptonite taking a backseat"; he referred to [...] "Tempest" [...] as the [...] "slam bang season ending cliffhanger". Eric Moro of Mania.com believed that [...] "Tempest" [...] proved Smallville could [...] "utilize the supernatural as a metaphor for teenage life", and that the finale managed to [...] "recap the theme of the entire season, brought every dangling plot point to a head and closed with an ending sure to bring viewers back for a second season of super-entertainment". Author Neal Bailey was little more mixed in his opinion. He felt that for all the episode accomplished, it was not better than any previous episode that had aired that season; the episode lacked anticipation, based on the predictability of each character's actions.|$|E
500|$|Almost all of Millennium Park {{was closed}} for a day for {{corporate}} events in 2005 and 2006. Closing a public park partly paid for with taxpayer money was controversial, as was the exclusion of commuters who walk through the park and tourists lured by its attractions. [...] On September 8, 2005, Toyota Motor Sales USA paid $800,000 to rent all park venues from 6a.m. to 11p.m, except Wrigley Square, the Lurie Garden, the McDonald's Cycle Center and the Crown Fountain. [...] The city said the money was used to fund day-to-day operations, and for free events in the park, including the Lurie Garden Festival, a Steppenwolf Theater production, musical performers along the Chase Promenade <b>all</b> <b>summer</b> <b>long,</b> a jazz series, and children's concerts. The name of Toyota, one of the sponsors, was included on Millennium Park brochures, web site, and advertising signage. The closure provided a public relations opportunity for General Motors, which shuttled 1,500tourists from the park to see other Chicago attractions. Toyota said it considered $300,000 a rental expense and $500,000 a sponsoring donation. On August 7, 2006, Allstate, which paid $200,000 as a rental expense and $500,000 as a sponsoring donation, acquired the visitation rights to {{a different set of}} park features (including Lurie Garden), and only had exclusive access to certain features after 4p.m.|$|E
500|$|Simultaneously, Baker {{was cast}} as the title {{character}} in Elia Kazan's Baby Doll (1956), a role initially intended for Marilyn Monroe. Tennessee Williams, who had written and developed the screenplay based on two of his one-act plays, wanted Baker to play the part after seeing her perform a scene from his script at the Actors Studio; likewise, Kazan had been impressed by her performance in <b>All</b> <b>Summer</b> <b>Long</b> on Broadway the year prior. Shot in Benoit, Mississippi, directly after Baker had completed Giant, {{her role in the}} film as a sexually repressed teenaged bride to a failed middle-aged cotton gin owner brought Baker overnight fame and a level of notoriety even before the film's release. In the fall of 1956, artist Robert Everheart, under contract with Warner Bros., constructed a [...] billboard in Times Square promoting the film, depicting the now-iconic image of a scantily clad Baker lying in a crib sucking her thumb. The controversial advertising campaign for the film caused a pre-emptive backlash from religious groups, and on December 16, 1956, Cardinal Francis Spellman of St. Patrick's Cathedral denounced the film and advised his parish against seeing it. A formal condemnation by the Roman Catholic National Legion of Decency ensued, which considered it [...] "grievously offensive to Christian and traditional standards of morality and decency." ...|$|E

500|$|The glowing {{audience}} {{response to}} a rough cut of the film at two test screenings in Dallas on March 26, 1975, and one in Long Beach, on March 28, along {{with the success of}} Benchley's novel and the early stages of Universal's marketing campaign, generated great interest among theater owners, facilitating the studio's plan to debut Jaws at hundreds of cinemas simultaneously. A third and final preview screening, of a cut incorporating changes inspired by the previous presentations, was held in Hollywood on April 24. After Universal chairman Lew Wasserman attended one of the screenings, he ordered the film's initial release—planned for a massive total of as many as 900 theaters—to be cut down, declaring, [...] "I want this picture to run <b>all</b> <b>summer</b> <b>long.</b> I don't want people in Palm Springs to see the picture in Palm Springs. I want them to have to get in their cars and drive to see it in Hollywood." [...] Nonetheless, the several hundred theaters that were still booked for the opening represented what was then an unusually wide release. At the time, wide openings were associated with movies of doubtful quality; not uncommon on the exploitation side of the industry, they were customarily employed to diminish the effect of negative reviews and word of mouth. There had been some recent exceptions, including the rerelease of Billy Jack and the original release of its sequel The Trial of Billy Jack, the Dirty Harry sequel Magnum Force, and the latest installments in the James Bond series. Still, the typical major studio film release at the time involved opening at a few big-city theaters, which allowed for a series of premieres. Distributors would then slowly forward prints to additional locales across the country, capitalizing on any positive critical or audience response. The outsized success of The Godfather in 1972 had sparked a trend toward wider releases, but even that film had debuted in just five theaters, before going wide in its second weekend.|$|E

[...] David Howard wrote that [...] "Don't Worry Baby" [...] was a [...] "subtle harbinger for the growing dichotomy within the California Sound.

2500|$|The July 1964 {{release of}} the Beach Boys' sixth album <b>All</b> <b>Summer</b> <b>Long</b> marked {{an end to the}} group's beach-themed period. From there on, their {{recorded}} material took a significantly different stylistic and lyrical path. While on a December 23 flight from Los Angeles to Houston, the band's songwriter and producer Brian Wilson suffered a panic attack only hours after performing with the group on the musical variety series Shindig! [...] The 22-year-old Wilson had already skipped several concert tours by then, but the airplane episode proved devastating to his psyche. In order to focus his efforts on writing and recording, Wilson indefinitely resigned from live performances. Freed from the burden, he immediately showcased great artistic leaps in his musical development evident within the albums Today! and Summer Days, released {{in the first half of}} 1965. With the July 1965 single [...] "California Girls", Wilson began experimenting with song composition while under the influence of psychedelic drugs, a factor that yielded a great effect on the group's musical conceptions.|$|E

Some, indeed, opposed it, and insisted that to keep the houses and rooms hot was a means to propagate the distemper, which was a fermentation and heat already in the blood; that it was known to spread and increase in hot weather, and abate in cold; and therefore they alleged that all contagious distempers are the worst for heat, because the contagion was nourished, and gained strength, in hot weather, and was, as it were, propagated in heat.|$|R

A traveller, observing the exquisite purity of the great rivers, such as the Rhone at Geneva, and the Reuss at Lucerne, where they issue out of their respective lakes, might fancy for a moment that some power in Nature produced this beautiful change, with a view to make amends for those Alpine sullyings which the waters exhibit near their fountain heads; but, alas! how soon does that purity depart, before the influx of tributary waters that have flowed through cultivated plains and the crowded abodes of men.|$|R
