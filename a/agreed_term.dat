During this term of bondage the servant had a status similar to a son of the master. For example, the servant was not allowed to marry without the master’s permission. Servants could own personal property. They could also complain to a local magistrate about mistreatment that exceeded community norms. However, a servant's contract could be sold or given away by his master.|$|E
5000|$|In {{exchange}} for the customer depositing the money for an <b>agreed</b> <b>term,</b> institutions usually grant higher interest rates than they do on accounts that customers can withdraw from on demand—though {{this may not be}} the case in an inverted yield curve situation. Fixed rates are common, but some institutions offer CDs with various forms of variable rates. For example, in mid-2004, interest rates were expected to rise—and many banks and credit unions began to offer CDs with a [...] "bump-up" [...] feature. These allow for a single readjustment of the interest rate, at a time of the consumer's choosing, during the term of the CD. Sometimes, financial institutions introduce CDs indexed to the stock market, bond market, or other indices.|$|E

There is no <b>agreed</b> <b>term</b> relating to how to describe the Diaspora's manner of speaking Punjabi, as it is littered with words mostly from English (to a greater extent, especially nouns, than is Punjabi in Punjab) and occasionally other languages, depending upon where the immigrants ended up. Most came to the West or South East Asia. The Western Punjabis have either settled in Great Britain (the highest concentration anywhere in the world outside of South Asia), Canada, and the States. Commonly the literature written in this type of Punjabi is referred to as Parvasi, which literally means Emigre.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} is specially designed {{to find the}} viability of Teleworking in Sri Lankan software industry. Concept Teleworking can be simply defined as working at home. Teleworking concept is famous working style in many developed countries like USA, UK, Australia, Germany and many countries in Europe. Virtual offices have been succeeded in many sectors and in many areas. Teleworking concept is known in many terms in many countries and still there is no <b>agreed</b> <b>term</b> for this concept. 'Teleworking' (common in European literature), 'Telecommuting' (common in American literature), 'home-working', 'working-at-a distance', 'off-site workers', or 'remote-workers' - all these terms may have similar meanings. Objective of this {{research is}} to find out the viability of Teleworking with Sri Lankan software industry. Survey has been carried out with 72 participants from several corporate positions in different software development companies in Sri Lanka Viability of Teleworking surveyed in terms of Financial, Legal, Personal, Managerial, Social, Infrastructural and Cultural. Research findings will be analyzed to formulate a policy frame work for Teleworkers in Sri Lankan software industry...|$|E
40|$|The {{rationale}} in {{this paper}} is {{that in order to}} make meaning of science in school, students are dependent on representations as mediating means. Besides that, learning concerns establishment of continuity between purposes, e. g. Johansson & Wickman (2011) suggested that learning progressions could be analysed from proximate purposes (close to students´ prior experiences) and ultimate purposes (more scientific ones). The aim is to investigate ways that secondary students, 14 years old, learn about the human body by focusing meaning-making of representations. The ultimate teaching purpose was articulated as “transportation and transformation of substances which will eventually reach the cells”. The research questions concern in what ways representations afford and hinder the students’ ways of making sense of the content The issue of exchange of substances came up early in the production of the representation because the students found it necessary to explain how material exchange across surfaces between organs was possible. The students decided that substances “jump” thus avoiding articulation of the specific mechanism and later the jump was visualized with arrows and text. The metaphor ‘jump’ offers an <b>agreed</b> <b>term</b> that ‘stands fast’ (Wickman, 2014) and allows students to move forward even though the material processes associated with jumping are not clear. It acts as a place holder metaphor that sequentially becomes more articulated and refined as students views of what is being exchanged, and where, are developed as part of the ultimate purposes of the sequence. The students started their conversations with naming the substances that enter the body using everyday terms like food and air however these words are replaced by nutrition/oxygen (intermediate wording) to nutrients/glucose and oxygen molecule. The gradual transformation of wording towards a more scientific language could be explained by the teacher´s re-phrasing when talking with students. Another reason might be that the affordance of visual diagrams lies in the way it productively constrains attention (Prain & Tytler, 2012) and thus creates a need for inclusion of other semiotic resources like arrows and formulas. The scientific language progression towards more discriminating and technical terms, as described above, {{is one of the key}} factors that scaffold the progression. Another factor is that the ambition of establishing continuity between proximate and ultimate purposes (Johansson & Wickman, 2011) seems to work for these activities. The students often ask each other “where does this substance go now?” or “how does it reach the cell?”...|$|E
40|$|Treatment with oral {{anticoagulant}} therapy entails {{a delicate balance}} between over(risk of bleeding) and under- (risk of thrombemboli) anticoagulation. Therapy is therefore monitored to maintain its anticoagulant effect within a narrow range. The main aim {{of this research was}} to determine the optimal intensity of long-term anticoagulant therapy in 3404 post-myocardial infarction patients. Chapter 1 gives a review of long-term clinical trials which assessed the mertts of anticoagulant therapy in the secondary prevention of morbidity and mortality after myocardial infarction. This review includes the results of more than thirty trials reported in the literature in the past forty years, however, unpublished data or results of small trials, were not considered. Few of these trials were randomized, and the level of anticoagulation was properly maintained in only some of these studies. The results of most of these trials have failed to convincingly demonstrate the beneficial effects of long-term anticoagulant therapy as a secondary preventive measure and the use of such therapy has therefore remained controversial. Chapters 2 and 3 describe the design and execution of the ASPECT (Anticoagulants in the Secondary Prevention of Events in Coronary Thrombosis) trial. The main results of this trial are submitted in Appendix-A. ASPECT was designed to be a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, multicentre trial which compared standard {{oral anticoagulant}} therapy with placebo with regards to mortality and cardiovascular events. Chapter 2 describes the design and procedures of the ASPECT trial in detail, in particular the methods for double-blind anticoagulant titration. Chapter 3 presents an outline of the data processing system as used in ASPECT. A standardized procedure which was developed for data handling insured a high level of data quality derived from the participating centres. Chapters 4, 5 and 6 addresses the effectiveness and safety of oral anticoagulant therapy. Chapter 4 reviews various methods, previously described, to evaluate therapeutic achievement of anticoagulant therapy in the ASPECT trial. In Chapter 5, the optimal achieved intensity of anticoagulant therapy required to prevent recurrence of arterial thromboembolic and haemorrhagic complications was quantitatively evaluated with regard to the international normalized ratio (INR) intensity preceding the event, enabling the calculation of INR-specific incidence rates. The INR expresses the level of anticoagulant therapy in an internationally <b>agreed</b> <b>term.</b> It is the common term for the prothrombin time as measured in a patient on oral anticoagulant therapy. Chapter 6 gives {{a detailed description of the}} risk of stroke in the ASPECT population. Finally, a discussion of the findings is provided in Chapter 7, followed by recommendations for further researc...|$|E
