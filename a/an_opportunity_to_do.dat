5|$|The ZX81's {{distribution}} {{arrangements were}} {{an essential part}} of its success and marked a watershed in the way that computers were sold in the UK. Sinclair had previously made its name as a mail-order retailer – the ZX81 was initially available only through mail-order – but the only truly effective way to reach the mass market was via high street stores. Fortunately for Sinclair, <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> just that was provided by W.H. Smith, a venerable book- and magazine-seller and stationery chain. The company had stagnated in the 1970s and was looking for ways to revitalise its image and expand its product range.|$|E

Over 160 distinct courses are offered. Students have <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> independent research, and many compete in the annual Intel Science Talent Search (formerly sponsored by Westinghouse).|$|E
25|$|Ulysses had no {{particular}} inclination to military life {{at that time}} and at first declined to go, expressing little appreciation for the efforts of his father and friends. After a brief discussion, however, Jesse was able to convince Ulysses to enroll in the academy. As Ulysses was eager to set out into a world he had seen little of, he now saw the prospect as <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so with the hopes of becoming successful on his own. Upon word of his acceptance to West Point, Ulysses departed for New York on May 15, 1839. In 1847 Jesse sold his Georgetown home to Marshall Jenning for $2600.|$|E

25|$|There is {{no doubt}} that Pridi wanted to remove Phibun from power, and the war offered <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. However, there is no {{question}} that Pridi recognised well before the war that Thailand's alignment with the Axis powers would work to Phibun's advantage and enable him to strengthen his dictatorship. Even the Japanese recognised Pridi's hostility, which is why he was forced out of the cabinet in December 1941. It was the reason every knowledgeable person on the Allied side, from Seni Pramoj and Prince Suphasawat, a chief organiser of the movement in Great Britain, to former British ambassador Josiah Crosby, anticipated that Pridi would emerge as the head of a domestic resistance movement.|$|E
25|$|Males are {{produced}} less frequently and in less quantity than females {{are produced}}. After eclosion males {{remain on the}} nest {{for up to a}} week. Upon leaving, they live nomadically and mate with females of other nests. Males do not assist in any of the colony maintenance activities while they reside in the nest. They are not well suited for foraging or defending the colony because of their weaker mandibles and lack of a stinger. They are dependent on female workers feeding them and are sometimes observed to cannibalize nest larvae. It has been experimentally demonstrated that males of R. marginata have the ability to feed larvae, but they do not because they lack food access and females do not give them <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so in natural populations.|$|E
25|$|Anspaugh also {{expressed}} frustration that although a managed forest fire in Canada on 3 August 1985 {{is said to}} have been lit by proponents of nuclear winter, with the fire potentially serving as <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> some basic measurements of the optical properties of the smoke and smoke-to-fuel ratio, which would have helped refine the estimates of these critical model inputs, the proponents did not indicate that any such measurements were made. Peter V. Hobbs, who would later successfully attain funding to fly into and sample the smoke clouds from the Kuwait oil fires in 1991, {{also expressed}} frustration that he was denied funding to sample the Canadian, and other forest fires in this way. Turco wrote a 10-page memorandum with information derived from his notes and some satellite images, claiming that the smoke plume reached 6km in altitude.|$|E

25|$|Broadcast 2 December 1993, this {{instalment}} {{looks at}} the summer, when almost all life in the region breeds. A South Georgian colony of fur seals is shown: the pups grow fast on the rich, fatty milk provided by their mothers and double their weight in just sixty days. As the females become sexually available, the mating season begins — males try to claim territory and mate with females. Chinstrap penguins form large groups on Deception Island, climbing up its steep slopes to find mountain ridges free of snow. Returning birds find their partners by recognising their voice (performing a brief greeting ritual when they find them), {{which is why the}} colonies are very noisy during the breeding season. Males and females take turns in catching food, some of which they later regurgitate for their chicks. The summer also thaws some of the ice on the continent's shores. The fresh water allows moss and other plants to grow, which in turn provide food for mites that are adapted to the cold climate — they can survive temperatures up to minus 30°C because they contain a kind of antifreeze. They become active as soon as the ice melts, and reproduce whenever they get <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. Lichens grow even further south than moss, and algae populate some of the snow. In the ocean, life is much more diverse, and blue-eyed shags dive for fish near the peninsula. More than 300,000 petrels come to breed to the Scullin Monolith, one of the few areas of open rock.|$|E

They hoped to bring new elements and drastically altered gameplay concepts that would suit the franchise's universe.

Al-Qaeda's relationship with Iran was, according to the Combating Terrorism Center, an [...] "unpleasant byproduct of necessity, fueled by mutual distrust and antagonism." [...] An explicit reference to any institutional support from Pakistan for al-Qaeda wasn't mentioned in the documents; instead, bin Laden instructed his family members how to avoid detection so that members of Pakistani intelligence couldn't track them to find him. According to the seized material, former commander of the international forces in Afghanistan David Petraeus and US President Barack Obama should be assassinated during any of their visits to Pakistan and Afghanistan, if there was <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. Bin Laden opined that U.S. Vice President Joe Biden should not be a target because [...] "Biden is totally unprepared for that post , which will lead the US into a crisis." [...] Bin Laden was also against one-person suicide attacks and was of the opinion that at least two persons should undertake these attacks instead. He planned to reform in a way so that al-Qaeda's central leadership would have a greater say in the naming of the al-Qaeda branch leaders and their deputies. He expressed his opinion that killing Muslims has weakened his organization and not helped al-Qaeda, writing that it [...] "cost the mujahedeen no small amount of sympathy among Muslims.
