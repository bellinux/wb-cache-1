25|$|The {{design has}} a {{monocoque}} (unibody) construction with four-wheel independent air suspension. Air suspension allowed variable ride height and achieved similar axle articulation {{to the previous}} live <b>axle</b> <b>design.</b> This retained off-road abilities while improving on-road performance. The new Range Rover's introduction in late 2002 as a 2003 model for the North American market resulted in the Range Rover and Ford Expedition (also new for 2003) being the only two SUVs in the full-size sport utility class with four-wheel independent suspension systems at that time.|$|E
2500|$|The first-generation Corvair {{featured}} a rear engine + swing <b>axle</b> <b>design</b> {{similar to that}} of the Renault Dauphine and Volkswagen Beetle [...] a design which eliminates universal joints at the wheels and keeps the rear wheels perpendicular to the half-shafts. The design can allow rear tires to undergo large camber angle changes during fast cornering due to side g-forces causing [...] "rebound" [...] camber and decreasing the tread contact with the road surface, leading to a loss of rear wheel grip and oversteer—a dynamically unstable condition where a driver can lose control and spin. [...] The problem is most severe with rear-engine swing axle combinations because of the greater inertial mass over the rear wheels and the higher center of gravity during rebound camber conditions. [...] The additional high weight of a station wagon body also exacerbates the tendency. [...] Oversteer is exacerbated by deceleration during cornering due to increased side g-force and lightened load on rear tires (lift-off oversteer). Understeer is common in front-engine cars, due to more weight, and inertia, on the front tires. Both conditions are dangerous when a car is driven at its cornering limits.|$|E

5000|$|Quick release - a lever and skewer {{that pass}} through a hollow <b>axle</b> <b>designed</b> to allow for {{installation}} and removal of the wheel without any tools (found on most modern road bikes and some mountain bikes).|$|R
5000|$|A single {{transverse}} {{leaf spring}} for both front wheels and/or both back wheels, supporting solid axles, was used by Ford Motor Company, before and soon after World War II, even on expensive models. It had the advantages of simplicity and low unsprung weight (compared to other solid <b>axle</b> <b>designs).</b>|$|R
25|$|Axle tooling {{equipment}} – sold in 1985 to Dana Holding Corporation, {{and they}} named the AMC-15 axles as Dana 35. Dana manufactured the AMC-20 axles for AM General's Hummer H1. The company also continues {{to produce the}} AMC-15 axle as well; however they have been upgraded from AMC's original design with multiple variations (including front <b>axle</b> <b>designs).</b>|$|R
5000|$|So {{successful}} was {{the project}} for Cargowaggon, they extended the project. The problem of the twin <b>axle</b> <b>design</b> was that although its short length meant that it easily fitted on the cross-English Channel rail ferry, its long wheelbase restricted the minimum radius on which it could be used. The resultant longer length wagon, based on a twin EVA bogie, twin <b>axle</b> <b>design,</b> the IGA spawned three basic variants: ...|$|E
50|$|Approximately 4000 made in 1940 {{and early}} 1941. It was almost {{identical}} to the Mk I, save {{for a change in}} front <b>axle</b> <b>design,</b> which removed the provision for the locking differential.|$|E
50|$|Aside from a {{more modern}} {{appearance}} and construction, the Silver Shadow introduced many new features such as disc rather than drum brakes, and independent rear suspension, rather than the outdated live <b>axle</b> <b>design</b> of previous cars.|$|E
2500|$|Heavy duty wide-track <b>axles</b> (<b>designed</b> by ENV) were {{fitted to}} improve vehicle stability, as was a front {{anti-roll}} bar and revised rear springs which were mounted above the axle rather than below it. In the process the wheelbase was increased to [...] Production ended in 1974 when Land-Rover rationalised its vehicle range. Many IIB components {{were also used}} on the [...] "1 Ton" [...] 109in vehicle.|$|R
50|$|Compared to the {{production}} BMW E90 model, the axles and the suspension geometry has been changed significantly. The new <b>axles</b> <b>design</b> include a camber setting that could be adjusted independently of any other settings parameters, such as roll center and track. This would make the axles easier for semi-professional teams to set up. The track width and camber were increased, while the wheel carrier and bearing were carried over from {{the production}} model.|$|R
50|$|Early vehicles, {{like the}} Ford Model T, with its leaf spring, live <b>axle</b> {{suspension}} <b>design,</b> were both uncomfortable and handled poorly.|$|R
50|$|The Bissel or pony <b>axle</b> <b>design</b> is {{commonly}} used on steam locomotives with a single leading or trailing axle and was later also used on the Class 4E electric and Classes 32-000 and 32-200 diesel-electric locomotives.|$|E
50|$|The {{horizontal}} <b>axle</b> <b>design</b> {{is found}} in most homes, and also in many schools. It is easy to use due to its low friction and ease of refilling. This {{is the type of}} holder most commonly assumed about when toilet paper orientation is mentioned.|$|E
50|$|The {{key reason}} for lower {{unsprung}} weight {{relative to a}} live <b>axle</b> <b>design</b> is that, for driven wheels, the differential unit does not form part of the unsprung elements of the suspension system. Instead it is either bolted directly to the vehicle's chassis or more commonly to a subframe.|$|E
50|$|During the 1980s, {{improved}} {{versions of}} these trucks were introduced, including the Integral Sleeper (1982) long-distance truck, the Conventional (1983) upgraded conventional truck, the Autocar DS (1984) {{successor to the}} Road Constructor 2, the Integral Tall Sleeper (1985) truck which was the 'Globetrotter' of America, the aerodynamic 'Aero' (1987) truck, the Autocar (1987) construction truck with the option of using an integrated driveline (engine+gearbox+rear <b>axle)</b> <b>designed</b> and produced by Volvo and the short conventional WG (1988) truck.|$|R
50|$|The first S-Series {{tractors}} {{were produced}} starting in 1959 {{and would be}} made with the same basic concepts being used until 1974. In 1959, the S-14 and S-23 were made available for purchase. These tractors incorporated the earlier changes from the transmission and <b>axle</b> <b>designs</b> of Harold Pond in 1951. However, a steering wheel and steel hoods were added to these tractors. A full line of accessories had been developed and was carried over to the S-Series.|$|R
50|$|A single {{example of}} this type, called the AA20-1, was built by the Soviet Union. The {{designation}} stands for Andrey Andreev (who sponsored its construction), 20 ton axle load. While some builders had produced twelve-coupled (six driving <b>axles)</b> <b>designs,</b> {{no one had ever}} built a fourteen-coupled engine. The AA20-1 holds two records: the largest number of coupled axles on a locomotive, and being the longest rigid frame locomotive in Europe. It was the largest rigid frame locomotive in the world until 1939, when the PRR S1 was unveiled.|$|R
50|$|The Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) {{investigated}} the incident {{and found that}} it was caused by a complete fracture of the axle, due to a bearing stiffening {{to the point where it}} would no longer rotate properly. The RAIB recommended that a review of gearbox and <b>axle</b> <b>design</b> be undertaken, and that the class 22X final drive oil sampling regime be improved.|$|E
50|$|While {{most other}} {{manufacturers}} derive their trucks from road applications, Tatra T815 was purposely designed for extreme off-road conditions, and its road versions {{are derived from}} the off-road original concept. The principle consists in a central load-carrying tube with independently suspended swinging half-axles bolted as one whole. This gives Tatra vehicles outstanding driving qualities in the most difficult terrains. The concept allows higher off-road speed compared to classical rigid <b>axle</b> <b>design.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 1965, the TR4A with IRS or {{independent}} rear suspension superseded the TR4. Apart from the rear suspension, which used trailing arms and a differential bolted to the redesigned chassis frame {{and a number of}} small styling changes and refinements, the two models appear nearly identical. In fact, an estimated 25 per cent of TR4As were not equipped with IRS, but instead reverted to a live <b>axle</b> <b>design</b> similar to the TR4, which was adapted to fit the new chassis.|$|E
50|$|Exposed hub locks can {{be broken}} or damaged by {{off-road}} conditions, rendering 4×4 useless and leaving the vehicle stranded. Also, in some <b>axle</b> <b>designs</b> (such as those used on older Land Rovers), the top swivel bearing can become starved for lubrication (which is normally supplied by oil slung up by the rotating axle), unless the hubs are locked every few hundred miles. Also, since locking hubs generally do not require a key to operate, they can be maliciously locked or unlocked by persons other than the vehicle owner.|$|R

50|$|The driving axles {{were fixed}} rigidly into the {{locomotive}} frame. To improve curve running the wheel flanges {{of the driving}} wheels were reduced. The carrying <b>axles</b> were <b>designed</b> as Adams <b>axles</b> and had leaf return springs.|$|R

50|$|William Bridges Adams (1797 - 23 July 1872) was an author, {{inventor}} and locomotive engineer. He is {{best known}} for his patented Adams axle — a successful radial <b>axle</b> <b>design</b> in use on railways in Britain until the end of steam traction in 1968 — and the railway fishplate. His writings, including English Pleasure Carriages (1837) and Roads and Rails (1862) covered all forms of land transport. Later he became a noted writer on political reform, under the pen name Junius Redivivus (Junius reborn); a reference to a political letter writer of the previous century.|$|E
5000|$|The Pantelemidis {{family owned}} a company {{producing}} farm machinery (specializing in threshing machines) and buses, using the Titan brand name. It {{was established in}} Thessaloniki, Greece, in 1937. This company became best known, however, for the engineering inventions of Ioannis Pantelemidis; especially a novel chassis type he designed in 1955, on which he produced two vehicles, a 4-tonne truck and a city bus. The chassis featured a complex hydraulic mechanism and <b>axle</b> <b>design</b> which enabled the driver to adjust ground clearance (e.g. low, for easier loading, or elevated, for all-terrain drive).|$|E
50|$|Class D I of the Royal Bavarian State Railways (Königlich Bayerische Staatsbahn) was a tank {{locomotive}} {{with two}} coupled <b>axles</b> <b>designed</b> for shunting. As had been specified, these locomotives were simple and robust. They had a double-frame, with water tanks being suspended between the sole {{bars of the}} front section. Because the water capacity of 1.74 m3 soon proved too little even for a shunter operating only {{within the limits of}} its own station, additional side tanks were added to some engines during the 1880s. The outside Stephenson valve gear moved the valves on top of the horizontal cylinders. The locomotives could be braked using an Exter counterweight brake.|$|R
50|$|Until about 1880, four-wheeled {{compartment}} {{coaches were}} typical. After {{the end of}} the wave of nationalisations the Prussian state railways, around 1895, acquired the quieter-running six-wheelers. For this, so-called norms were established for four-, six- and, later, eight-wheeled classes of coach. For the six-wheelers, both fixed axle and sliding <b>axle</b> <b>designs</b> were envisaged. Those coaches designed specifically for suburban traffic (Berlin, Hamburg) had no toilets. On the other coaches, a gangway was specified {{in order to keep the}} number of toilets to a minimum for economic reasons. Numerous coaches had therefore to be converted. After {{the end of the}} 19th century, fourth class compartment coaches were also procured.|$|R

50|$|A compass was {{standard}} equipment on all Wagoneers while seat belts were optional. Warn hubs were utilized to engage or disengage front wheels and drive train while in two-wheel drive mode. A four-wheel-drive {{independent front suspension}} was $135 extra replacing the standard Dana 27AF solid front axle, and this option was supposed to offer the Wagoneer more car-like handling and ride. This was a single pivot front <b>axle</b> <b>design</b> that allowed the differential to swing with curb-side half while short upper A-arms tie into torsion bars at their inner pivot points and the axles are located fore and aft by control links.|$|E
50|$|Refined {{over several}} decades of two-digit Saab models, the 900's double {{wishbone}} suspension design provided excellent handling and road feel. The rear suspension comprised a typical beam <b>axle</b> <b>design,</b> stabilized with a Panhard rod. However, the attachment points between the axle and chassis made up an unusual configuration that, in essence, {{consists of two}} Watt's linkages {{at either end of}} the axle: A lower control arm attaches the axle to the bottom of the vehicle, while an upper link attaches at the top but faces towards the rear, unlike a typical 4-link design with both lower and upper links facing forward.|$|E
5000|$|The Lincoln Navigator {{was also}} {{developed}} under the Ford program code name UN173, with the Expedition developed under the UN93 program code name. [...] A full-size body-on-frame vehicle, the Navigator was mechanically {{related to the}} Ford Expedition; both vehicles {{were related to the}} 1997 Ford F-Series. As with many high-end SUVs, the Navigator featured independent front suspension (short-long arm/SLA); the rear suspension was of a live rear <b>axle</b> <b>design.</b> Using an optional feature from its Ford counterpart, the Navigator was designed with load-leveling air suspension; tuned primarily for ride comfort, the air suspension lowered itself when the vehicle was parked.|$|E
5000|$|The single rear pivot {{system is}} the simpler of the two rear pivot designs. Every {{function}} operates relative to a pivot point, typically located {{in front of the}} rear <b>axle.</b> This <b>design</b> does not allow traditional tip-dumping capabilities.|$|R
50|$|Utility Trailer Manufacturing Company {{was founded}} in 1914 by E.W. Bennett and H.C. Bennett, {{and was one of}} the first truck trailer {{manufacturers}} in the United States. The first product was a single <b>axle</b> trailer <b>designed</b> to accommodate 60 bales of cotton.|$|R
50|$|C3s {{are single}} <b>axle</b> units <b>designed</b> for smaller, {{narrower}} placements, and {{range from a}} tiny #000 to #2. There is some overlap between the C4 #0.3 and the C3 1 and 2. As with most microcams, the C3 #000 is rated for aid climbing only.|$|R
