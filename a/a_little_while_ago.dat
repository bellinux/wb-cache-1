500|$|Kimura {{eventually}} {{spoke with}} Marvelous Entertainment's Yoshiro Wada {{about creating a}} game mixing a [...] "flare of [...] and Japan <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> <b>ago</b> (say about 40 years ago)". Kimura wanted Chulip to be localized {{to show the world}} certain aspects of Japanese culture and [...] "all the kind of interesting stuff that you can see every day". He also wanted to display a real, modern truancy problem for Japanese students with the game's cast of underground dwellers. Norikazu Yasunaga designed many of the game's mechanics. According to Kimura, [...] "for efficient procedure, [...] set it up so that the personality and the characteristics for each NPC had to be one-by-one". The character designs were done by Ryuji Nouguchi, who used items from Kimura's personal scrapbook and [...] "made them funny". The musical score to Chulip was composed by Hirofumi Taniguchi, another former member of Love-de-Lic. The soundtrack was released by King Records in Japan on a single disc on November 22, 2002. Songs 35 through 44 represent the [...] "Tsurukame Movie Soundtrack", consisting of music for each of the game's short films, while songs 45 and 46 are bonus tracks.|$|E
2500|$|On 3 January 2017 Cartwright was {{presented}} his baggy green cap by former Australian cricketer Tom Moody {{to make his}} debut in third Test match against Pakistan, replacing Nic Maddinson. Cartwright averaged over 44.50 with the bat and had taken 15 wickets from 16 games at 44. Captain Steve Smith said Cartwright's bowling had [...] "improved a lot {{over the last year}} or so. I remember facing him <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> <b>ago</b> and I think since then he's probably gained 10ks and got a lot more consistent with his areas. I think he's improved a lot. I guess it depends how much we'll use him, how the game goes. But he's certainly improved over the last year." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{have also}} to {{acknowledge}} receipt of a letter from Mr. H.E. Holmes of Durban, enclosing the text of a pronouncement made by the South African Board of Control to the effect that, {{in the opinion of}} that body, the contest between the MCC team and The Reef at Vogelfontein on 22 and 23 December 1909, was not a first-class match. In the course of this encounter Hobbs scored 70 runs which are counted in his first-class aggregate. Seeing that the game was regarded, {{at the time it was}} played, as first-class and until <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> <b>ago</b> had been left in undisputed possession of that rank, the need for raising any question about the matter after more than twenty years is not at all obvious. In any circumstances, I should not advise the dragging up of what, with all due respect to the recent ruling of the South African Board, must remain a debatable matter. The Reef team included some Test match players and others who had appeared in Inter-State games so it certainly had considerable claims to be regarded as first-class and from that standing, I cannot, all things considered, agree after such a long lapse of time to reduce it. Outside the merits of the case, is there not something rather grotesque in the idea of a controlling body sitting in solemn conclave over so small a matter and deciding to upset what had been accepted for twenty years? ...|$|E

But now the womanly instinct rose up in revolt, at the very thought {{that he should be}} arrested, tried, and condemned! What mattered if he were a fugitive, if he were ostracized and despised? what mattered anything so long as he lived and she could be near him? <b>A</b> very <b>little</b> <b>while</b> <b>ago,</b> she would have done anything to keep him from going; she almost longed for his arrest and the publicity of the trial.

60|$|The Abbe Foucquet did {{not quite}} {{understand}} all this, which was very rapidly and roughly explained to him.

60|$|This glitter {{was still}} new to her; the power which she wielded seemed as yet a brittle toy which a hasty {{movement}} might suddenly break.

Her ambition was smothered in her heart, which at times it almost threatened to consume. But it was always there, ever since she had learnt to understand the power which beauty gives.|$|R

"Now, here, my brother," [...] said Nada, {{pointing}} {{at me with}} her finger, [...] "here is that old umfagozan, that low fellow, who, unless I dream, but <b>a</b> very <b>little</b> <b>while</b> <b>ago</b> brought shame upon me--ay, my brother, he struck me, a maid, with his kerrie, and that only because I said that I would stab him for his insolence, and he did worse: he swore that he would drag me to some old chief of his to be a gift to him, and this {{he was about to}} do, had you not come.

60|$|<b>A</b> very <b>little</b> <b>while</b> <b>ago,</b> Mr. Airlie, in his {{capacity}} of second cousin {{to one of the}} ladies concerned, a charming girl but impulsive, had been called upon to attend a family council of a painful nature. The gentleman's name took Joan's breath away: it was the name of one of her heroes, an eminent writer: one might almost say prophet. She had hitherto read his books with grateful reverence. They pictured for her the world made perfect; and explained to her just precisely how it was to be accomplished. But, as far as his own particular corner of it was concerned, he seemed to have made a sad mess of it. Human nature of quite an old-fashioned pattern had crept in and spoilt all his own theories.|$|R

6000|$|... "You {{feel more}} sure of me after that?" [...] he said, {{in a voice}} that was very faint and strained. [...] "Still, you see, I could gain nothing by {{deviating}} from the truth now. Well, I shot Trooper Shannon. You'll have the date in the warrant. Don't know if it will seem strange to you, but I forget it. I borrowed farmer Winston's horse and rifle without his knowledge, though I had paid him a trifle to personate me and draw the troopers off the whisky-runners. That was Winston's only complicity. The troopers, who fancied they were chasing him, followed me until his horse which I was riding went through the ice, but Winston was in Montana at the time, and did not know that I was alive until <b>a</b> very <b>little</b> <b>while</b> <b>ago.</b> Now, you can straighten that up and read it out to me." ...|$|R
60|$|MADAM,--I {{read your}} letter with watery eyes. <b>A</b> <b>little,</b> very <b>little</b> <b>while</b> <b>ago,</b> I had scarce a friend but the {{stubborn}} pride {{of my own}} bosom; now I am distinguished, patronised, befriended by you. Your friendly advices--I will not give them the cold name of criticisms--I receive with reverence. I have made some small alterations in what I before had printed. I have the advice of some very judicious friends among the literati here, but with them I sometimes {{find it necessary to}} claim the privilege of thinking for myself. The noble Earl of Glencairn, to whom I owe more than to any man, does me the honour of giving me his strictures; his hints, with respect to impropriety or indelicacy, I follow implicitly.|$|R
6000|$|In {{a moment}} it had come, the first serious dispute of their wedded life. It had come as all such calamities come, from nothing, {{and it was on}} them in full {{disaster}} ere they knew. Such <b>a</b> very <b>little</b> <b>while</b> <b>ago,</b> there in the convent garden, their lives had been drawn closer in sympathy than ever before; and now that blessed time seemed ages since, and they were further asunder than those who have never been friends. [...] "I thought," [...] bitterly mused Isabel, [...] "that he would have done anything for me." [...] "Who could have dreamed that a woman of her sense would be so unreasonable," [...] he wondered. Both had tempers, as I know my dearest reader has (if a lady), and neither would yield; and so, presently, they could hardly tell how, for they were aghast at it all, Isabel was alone in her room amidst the ruins of her life, and Basil alone in the one-horse carriage, trying to drive away from the wreck of his happiness. All was over; the dream was past; the charm was broken. The sweetness of their love was turned to gall; whatever had pleased them in their loving moods was loathsome now, and the things they had praised a moment before were hateful. In that baleful light, which seemed to dwell upon all they ever said or did in mutual enjoyment, how poor and stupid and empty looked their wedding-journey! Basil spent five minutes in arraigning his wife and convicting her of every folly and fault. His soul was in a whirl, ...|$|R

60|$|He judged it more {{prudent to}} confront than to flee from these considerations; looking the more hardily {{in the dead}} face, bending his mind to realise the nature and greatness of his crime. So <b>little</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>ago</b> that face had moved with every change of sentiment, that pale mouth had spoken, that body had been all on fire with governable energies; and now, and by his act, that piece of life had been arrested, as the horologist, with interjected finger, arrests the beating of the clock. So he {{reasoned}} in vain; he could rise to no more remorseful consciousness; the same heart which had shuddered before the painted effigies of crime looked on its reality unmoved. At best, he felt a gleam of pity for one who had been endowed in vain with all those faculties that can {{make the world a}} garden of enchantment, one who had never lived and who was now dead. But of penitence, no, not a tremor.|$|R
6000|$|It will be {{gathered}} from so much familiar talk, {{and so much}} patience on both sides, that we now lived together upon excellent terms. Such was again the fact, and this time more seriously than before. Apart from disputations such as that which I have tried to reproduce, not only consideration reigned, but, I am tempted to say, even kindness. When I fell sick (as I did shortly after our great storm), he sat by my berth to entertain me with his conversation, and treated me with excellent remedies, which I accepted with security. Himself commented on the circumstance. [...] "You see," [...] says he, [...] "you begin to know me better. <b>A</b> very <b>little</b> <b>while</b> <b>ago,</b> upon this lonely ship, where no one but myself has any smattering of science, you would have made sure I had designs upon your life. And, observe, it is since I found you had designs upon my own that I have shown you most respect. You will tell me if this speaks of a small mind." [...] I found little to reply. In so far as regarded myself, I believed him to mean well; I am, perhaps, the more a dupe of his dissimulation, but I believed (and I still believe) that he regarded me with genuine kindness. Singular and sad fact! so soon as this change began, my animosity abated, and these haunting visions of my master passed utterly away. So that, perhaps, there was truth in the man's last vaunting word to me, uttered on the twenty-second day of July, when our long voyage was at last brought almost to an end, and we lay becalmed at the sea end of the vast harbour of New York, in a gasping heat, which was presently exchanged for a surprising waterfall of rain. I stood on the poop, regarding the green shores near at hand, and now and then the light smoke of the little town, our destination. And as I was even then devising how to steal a march on my familiar enemy, I was conscious of a shade of embarrassment when he approached me with his hand extended.|$|R

6000|$|... "Do you {{not know}} that you are giving me pain?" [...] she said at last, drawing <b>a</b> <b>little</b> closer to me.
