40|$|Printed {{circuit boards}} are {{electronic}} circuits created by mounting electronic components on a nonconductive board, and creating conductive connections between them. The creation of circuit patterns is accomplished using both additive and subtractive methods. The conductive circuit is generally copper, although aluminum, nickel, chrome, and other metals are sometimes used. There are three basic varieties of printed circuit boards: single-sided, double-sided, and multi-layered. The spatial and density requirement, and the circuitry complexity determine {{the type of}} board produced. Printed circuit boards are employed in the manufacturing of business machines and computers, as well as communication, control, and home entertainment equipment. Production of printed circuit boards involves the plating and selective etching of flat circuits of copper supported on a nonconductive sheet of plastic. Production begins with a sheet of plastic laminated with {{a thin layer of}} copper foil. Holes are drilled through the board using an automated drilling machine. The holes are used to mount electronic components on the board and to provide a conductive circuit from one layer of the board to another. Following drilling, the board is scrubbed to remove fine copper particles left by the drill. The rinsewater from a <b>scrubber</b> <b>unit</b> can be a significant source of copper waste.

40|$|The Bischoff Blast Furnace Top Gas Process {{for high}} {{pressure}} blast furnaces {{is presented as}} an example of a modern gas treatment process in the iron and steel industry: the work potential of the high pressure top gas is utilized in a plant comprising a gas cleaning unit for dust removal and a turbine for converting the recoverable thermal energy into mechanical and electrical energy. The adjustable <b>annular</b> gap <b>scrubber</b> for separating fine dust also serves as an element for regulating the gas pressure at the blast furnace top so that pressure control by the turbine and its control gear is no longer necessary. Moreover, in the event of a turbine outage the <b>annular</b> gap <b>scrubber</b> can be used as a low noise, pressure-throttling element. The economic use of a turbine for recovering energy from top gas depends on many parameters, such as top pressure, top gas rate, clean gas temperature, local cost of electric power, etc. A profitability analysis for a specific installation shows a remarkably short payback period. The process incorporates a new concept in blast air compression. Mechanical energy from the turbine is transferred directly to the axial flow compressor so that the prior conversion of energy via the power generating cycle is dispensed with. Coupled to the turbine is the compressor motor which, while rated to cover the full power requirement, uses about 40 % less electrical power from the power supply system. Finally, {{as an example of}} the future potential of this process, a new continuous steelmaking process is presented which employs a closed top converter. The gas, held under pressure during refining, is subsequently cleaned and expanded as the blast furnace process described above. This gas is cleaned without any entrainment of air to furnish a gaseous fuel of high calorific value. Since the steelmaking process is continuous, the gas is constantly available and can be fed into the distribution system without any intermediate storage...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the major}} factors {{affecting}} the productivity of workers in industry is quality of air in the working ambience. The quality of air can be characterized by means of microbial contaminants, chemicals, gases, allergen, odour or any mass or energy stressor that can induce health issues. This study {{is concerned with the}} presence of excessive detergent odour in industrial laundries. Odours are basically chemicals dissolved in air which we may be perceived by the sense of olfaction and always referred to as unpleasant smell. As for the case of industrial laundries, the effect of detergent odour becomes significant as cleaning processes simultaneously discharge high detergent concentration to the surrounding air which may lead to serious health issues apart from reducing workers’ performance. Therefore, a design of liquid spray gas scrubber had been proposed in this work as a means to overcome the problem. A prototype has been designed and developed to prove the working principle of the scrubber. By taking that the scrubbing efficiency is independent of the chemical specie, a solution of ammonium hydroxide (NH 4 OH) was used as a source of odour as alternative to detergent. This is due to the unavailibity of tools to measure detergent odour while concentration of NH 4 OH in the scrubbing liquid, i. e. water can be easily determined. From the tests conducted, scrubbing efficiency up to 36 % is obtained in a single stage, which is encouraging considering that the scrubber head was a simple shower nozzle. With improved designs of the spray, the <b>scrubber</b> <b>unit</b> may be used to improve indoor working environments...|$|R
40|$|As part of {{the main}} point of support 'alternative {{precursors}} for the vapour phase epitaxy' we have investigated the usability of the metalorganic (MO) precursors tertiarybutylphosphine (TBP) and tertiarybutylarsine (TBAs) for the MOVPE process. The present standard precursors PH_ 3 and AsH_ 3 are highly toxic, thermally stable and have a high vapour pressure. In contrast, the metalorganics are liquids with low vapour pressures and in addition they are less toxic and less stable. So {{the use of these}} precursors can strongly reduce the risk potential of the MOVPE process. Beside, the consumption of TBP, TBAs can be reduced considerably, compared to that of the standard hydrides, due to the more effective decomposition during the growth process. This results in a reduced amount of toxic residual gases, which have to be removed in a <b>scrubber</b> <b>unit.</b> The disposal of the toxic waste is an unneglectable cost and time factor in industrial production. For the material system InP/InGaAs it was shown in typical MOVPE growth processes (selective epitaxy, overgrowth, doping, PIN detectors), that the switching from standard hydrides to the MO precursors can be done without causing trouble. Essentially it was demonstrated, that the growth mechanisms using TBP and TBAs were the same as using the hydrides. Therefore the replacement of PH_ 3 and AsH_ 3 with TBP, TBAs only result in advantages {{from the point of view}} of the growth process. For the industrial acceptance of the new precursors it will be finally nececsary, that the precursor manufacturer will be able to produce TBP and TBAs reproducible in adequate quantities and qualities. In addition extended investigations have to be done to demonstrate the usability of the MO precursors in Al containing material systems (oxygen and carbon problem). (orig.)

30|$|The key to an {{efficient}} stripping process {{lies in the}} design of the contact system between the TAN-rich digestate and the gas to strip out the NH 3. The aim is to maximize the level of contact while minimizing the energy costs. The most common stripping systems use continuously packed towers [17]. Other options are spray towers, low profile units, bubble diffusers, aspirators, surface aerators and high-intensity mixers. Selection of the appropriate technology is both case and site specific. Limoli et al. [18] investigated ammonia removal from raw manure digestate by means of a turbulent mixing stripping process. Batch tests demonstrated that sodium hydroxide was the most suitable alkaline chemical to control pH, as it is easy to handle and minimizes treatment time and costs. When NaOH was applied to treat raw digestate at pH 10 and a temperature of 296.15  K (23  °C), TAN removal efficiency reached 89 % after 24  h of turbulent mixing stripping. Provolo et al. [19] investigated the performance of a stripping process based on a new concept of installation in which slow-rate NH 3 volatilization was promoted in a closed reactor containing continuously mixed digestate. Jiang et al. [20] investigated ammonia removal through air stripping of digested dairy manure using packed columns. Temperature and pH were identified as sensitive parameters for the process. When the temperature of the digestate was maintained at mesophilic level (308.15  K or 35  °C) during the stripping process, the optimized pH for ammonia stripping was 10.3 resulting in 90 % ammonia removal. In various studies, self-built laboratory setups were used to strip ammonium from wastewater or digestate. Yuan et al. [21] demonstrated the removal of ammonia from wastewater using a continuous-flow rotating packed bed as an air stripper at ambient temperature. Bousek et al. [22] studied the impact of strip gas composition on side stream ammonia stripping of digestate. For this purpose, they used a laboratory-scale batch stripping and scrubbing plant constructed from glass elements. The stripping unit was equipped with a fast-rotating pedal at the upper end that functioned as a foam destruction device. The stripper was connected to the <b>scrubber</b> <b>unit</b> via a horizontal laboratory glass tube. The scrubber column (Vigreux column) and a 1 L round bottom flask were operated in parallel current mode using 1  M H 2 SO 4 as scrubbing media.|$|R

40|$|On {{a typical}} {{oil and gas}} platform, {{mechanical}} equipment units are integral parts of the topside processing system. Heat exchangers, separators, scrubbers, compressors and other equipment units are critical for the proper operation of the processing plant. The hydrocarbon stream received at the first production separator is a mixed stream comprising oil, water and gas phase. This mixed stream is processed in order to separate the oil dominated, water dominated and gas phase. The processing systems for hydrocarbon separation consists of individual equipment units which are mapped {{together to form a}} network along with all the necessary process and operational parameters like inlet and outlet pressure and temperature, flow rates, compositional data and vapour fraction details. Modifying the process parameters on an individual equipment unit, impacts the process and operational parameters of subsequent downstream equipment units. Changing heat exchanger parameters has visible impacts on the operation of downstream equipments and also on the product specifications. Insufficient cooling of the gas stream reduces compressor efficiency, insufficient heating results in lesser quantities of gas bubbling out in the 3 phase separators and also insufficient cooling causes lesser condensate extraction from <b>scrubber</b> <b>units,</b> upstream of the compressor units. For the varied heating and cooling applications on an oil and gas topside system, shell and tube exchangers, plate frame heat exchangers and printed circuit heat exchangers are the common configurations used in the industry. Shell and tube exchangers have a robust design and can handle most kinds of process fluids across a large pressure and temperature range. Plate frame exchangers are the preferred choice for topside applications compared to shell and tube exchangers considering the cost benefit owing to weight the footprint savings. However, the operating pressure and temperature are a limiting factor for plate frame exchanger applications. Process fluids only within the range of 35 barg and 200 oC can be processed in this type of exchanger. Printed circuit heat exchangers are specially designed compact heat exchangers that have a very high heat transfer effective surface area which allows this type of exchanger to handle large heating duty demands. The compact design of printed circuit exchangers gives them a low weight and footprint factor. While doing thermal design calculations for shell and tube heat exchangers, factors like L/D ratio, RhoV 2 factor, vibration factor, shell side and tube side fluid velocity, effective surface area per shell, allowable and actual pressure drop values, heat duty and LMTD need to be analyzed in order to achieve an optimum design of the heat exchanger. </p...|$|R

40|$|Biogas {{production}} is growing {{and there is}} an increasing demand for upgraded bio- gas, to be used as vehicle fuel or injected to the natural gas grid. To enable the efficient use of biogas in these applications the gas must be upgraded, i. e. the carbon dioxide, which constitutes {{a large part of the}} raw biogas from the digester, must be separated from the methane. This report aims to evaluate the biogas up- grading technologies that are commercially available and in operation today: amine scrubbers, water <b>scrubbers,</b> PSA <b>units,</b> organic <b>scrubbers</b> and membrane <b>units.</b> The technologies are described in detail by presenting the theory behind the separation mechanism, the upgrading process as a complete system, operational issues and how these are solved, and finally the most important financial data. Furthermore, the best developed cryogenic technologies, which today are being used to purify landfill gas and biogas from some specific components and to lique- fy biogas, are presented. Cryogenic upgrading is an interesting possibility, but as this report shows, the technology still has some important operational issues to resolve. Technologies which are especially focused on small-scale applications are finally presented, however not in as much detail as the other, more common technologies. The report shows that for mid-scale applications, the most common options are all viable. The scrubbing technologies all perform well and have similar costs of investment and operation. The simplicity and reliability of the water scrubber has made this the preferred choice in many applications, but the high purity and very low methane slip from amine scrubbers are important characteristics. Regarding PSA and membrane units, the investment cost for these are about the same as for scrubbers. Furthermore, recent developments of the membrane units have also made it possible to reach low methane slips with this technology. Biogas {{production is}} increasing, in Sweden and globally, and the interest for bio- gas upgrading to utilize the gas as vehicle fuel or in other traditional natural gas applications increases as well. The mature technologies will see a market with more and harder competition as new upgrading technologies such as cryogenic upgrading are established, and other technologies optimize the processes to de- crease operation costs. Important issues for the future development of the biogas market relate to the implementation of new policy instruments. The work with the new European standard requirements for gas distributed through the existing gas grids is one issue that possibly can have a large effect on possibilities for distribu- tion of upgraded biogas. However, the future will most probably be fuelled by an increasing amount of upgraded biogas...|$|R

This paper asks: What were the cost savings from using a market-based instrument, {{rather than a}} more conventional prescriptive approach? Using an econometric model of the decision {{whether or not to}} install a scrubber under different policy regimes, I simulate the decisions that would have been made under prescriptive regulation. I find that under an uniform emissions-rate standard chosen to achieve the same aggregate abatement as actually occurred, the total number of scrubbers would have been about one-third higher than under the baseline cap-and-trade program. The change in the distribution of <b>scrubbers</b> among <b>units</b> is more striking. Under prescriptive regulation, installed scrubbers would have had systematically higher scrubbing costs than they actually did, and would have been installed at plants with significantly higher costs of switching to low-sulfur coal (the principal alternative to scrubbing). At the aggregate level, these effects translate into aggregate costs of compliance that would have been greater than actual costs by an estimated $ 150 million to $ 270 million per year. Thus the use of the market-based instrument resulted in cost savings of between 16 % and 25 %. The results provide a concrete demonstration of the influence of policy design on both unit-level choices of abatement technique and aggregate abatement costs. market-based instruments, prescriptive regulation, environmental policy, pollution control, sulfur dioxide, electric power, cost savingsmarket-based instruments, prescriptive regulation, environmental policy, pollution control, sulfur dioxide, electric power, cost savings...|$|R
40|$|The Baltic Sea {{is located}} between 53 °N to 66 °N and from 10 °E to 30 °E {{and is the}} second largest {{brackish}} water body in the world. It consists of several basins where the Baltic Proper is the major water mass. Around 85 million people live in the catchment area of the Baltic Sea, which subjects it {{to a range of}} environmental pressures, such as increased nutrient inputs from human activities (eutrophication), shipping, over-fishing, acid rain and trace metals released from anti-fouling paint. All these stressors, combined with low alkalinity, variable salinity and limited water exchange, makes the Baltic Sea a very sensitive area that may be less resilient to future stressors such as climate change or increased shipping activities. Microplankton communities consist of small heterotrophic bacteria, picoplankton, phytoplankton, cyanobacteria and smaller grazers, such as ciliates and zooplankton. In the Baltic Proper, there is a succession of blooms, within the microplankton community, from diatoms and dinoflagellates in the early spring to cyanobacteria during summer and ending with a second diatom and dinoflagellate bloom in the autumn. The cyanobacteria of the Baltic Proper bloom every summer and are dominated by Aphanizomenon sp. and Nodularia spumigena. Dolichospermum spp. is present but is less abundant. The effects of climate change were tested on a natural microplankton community, as well as on isolated cyanobacteria species from the Baltic Sea. To simulate effects of climate change, the temperature was increased from 12 °C to 16 °C, salinity decreased from 6 - 7 to 3 - 4 and atmospheric pCO 2 -levels was increased from 380 ppm to 960 ppm. The biovolume of Aphanizomenon sp. and N. spumigena increased when temperature was increased by 4 °C. When salinity was decreased by three units, both the growth and photosynthetic activity of N. spumigena were reduced while Aphanizomenon sp. was unaffected, and the growth of Dolichospermum sp. was increased. Furthermore, present-day salinities were beneficial, in terms of increased biovolumes, of diatoms, dinoflagellates and ciliates, compared to reduced future salinity. Increased atmospheric pCO 2 had no effect on any of the species in the microplankton community. These results show that the future microplankton community may be positive, in terms of increased biovolume, for the cyanobacteria species Aphanizomenon sp. and Dolichospermum spp. An increase of cyanobacteria blooms may open up to the possibility to grow and/or harvest these species as a source of biofuel or fatty acids (FA). Dolichospermum sp. yielded higher total FA content per biovolume, compared to the other two cyanobacteria species in phosphorus-depleted medium and Aphanizomenon sp. in nitrogen-depleted medium. Natural nutrient levels in the Baltic Proper are low both in nitrogen and phosphorus, which indicates a possible future market for biofuel and FA technologies. Additionally, the effects of seawater scrubbing (SWS) were tested on a natural summer-bloom microplankton community. Three different concentrations of scrubber water were added; 1 %, 3 % and 10 %. To elucidate effects of decreased pH alone, water acidified with H 2 SO 4 was added in equal concentrations. The six treatments were compared to a control without acidifying substances. SWS or the corresponding pH treatments, did not have a direct effect on microplankton species composition and biovolume. However, the increased amount of Cu and Zn in the scrubber water, combined with significant decrease in pH and alkalinity already at the 1 % scrubber water treatment calls for precaution when implementing <b>scrubber</b> <b>units</b> on the shipping fleet of the Baltic Sea.

Beyond the sampling assembly, the system had a &#x 27;Y&#x 27; junction with one branch running to a filter unit and the other running to a <b>scrubber</b> <b>unit.</b> The total system length was approximately 250 feet and is depicted on the attached drawing. According to the available background information, retrieval of the sample material from the MULLET event caused significant alpha (plutonium) contamination, limited to an area near ground zero (GZ). Test support Radiological Control Technicians did not detect contamination outside the immediate GZ area. In addition, vehicles, equipment, and workers that were contaminated were decontaminated on site. Soil contamination was addressed through the application of oil, and the site was decommissioned after the test. Any equipment that could be successfully decontaminated and had a future use was removed from the site. The contaminated equipment and temporary buildings erected to support the test were buried on site, most likely in the area under the dirt berm. The exact location of the buried equipment and temporary buildings is unknown. No information was found describing the disposition of the filter and scrubber, but they are not known to be at the site. The COMMODORE test was conducted at U 2 am on May 20, 1967, and formed the crater next to CAS 02 - 37 - 02. The COMMODORE test area had been surveyed prior to the test, and alpha contamination was not identified. Furthermore, alpha contamination was not identified during the COMMODORE re-entry survey, and routine surveys around the crater lip did not identify alpha contamination. Background information includes several radiological surveys conducted after these two tests. The MULLET area has been surveyed frequently. The early surveys indicate the area as both contaminated and containing buried radioactive material. A survey conducted in 1970 found the radiological/chemical piping partially intact, including the &#x 27;Y&#x 27; junction, and shows two runs of intact piping running past the U 2 am crater lip. The survey focused on the piping system itself and detected alpha contamination from 4 counts per minute (cpm) to 900, 000 cpm. The highest value was at a pipe flange between a dirt pile and a dirt berm within the current site fence line. All readings were direct, and no smears were taken. A 1972 survey was essentially a repeat of the 1970 survey; however, it does not show the &#x 27;Y&#x 27; junction nor does it show piping extending past the U 2 am crater lip. It also shows a new fence line separating the radiological/chemical piping from the U 2 am crater area with all piping within the fence. Alpha contamination was detected on pipe flanges during the survey, but alpha contamination was not detected on the dirt pile or the dirt berm. All readings were direct, and no smears were taken. Additional surveys were conducted in 1986, 1990, 1992, 1993, and 1996. One of the surveys focused on determining the extent of soil contamination around GZ. An alpha contamination plume extending approximately 200 feet south of GZ was detected in a swath approximately 100 feet wide. The maximum measurement was 15, 000 cpm alpha. All surveys show the piping within the fence line. Recent surveys (2007 and 2008) were performed around the current fence line by the demarcation group. No removable contamination was identified during these surveys. In late 2008, a visual inspection of the site was conducted by the National Security Technologies, LLC, Environmental Restoration group. All piping is within the fence line.

40|$|Graduation date: 2003 This {{dissertation}} addresses three topics on applied microeconomics. First, {{we investigate}} issues of market power and tax incidence in the U. S. brewing industry. Since alcohol consumption can be addictive, we derive a structural econometric model of addiction from a dynamic oligopoly game. This model identifies {{the degree of}} market power in a dynamic setting and allows us {{to test the hypothesis}} that federal tax incidence differs from state excise tax. Results indicate that beer producers have a modest market power and an increase in federal excise tax is more effective to reduce consumption than state excise taxes. Second, we estimate the effect of sulfur dioxide (S 0 ₂) emissions regulations on the productivity growth and opportunity cost of 261 phase I generating units. The Clean Air Act Amendment (CAAA) of 1990 required units to reduce emissions to 2. 5 pounds per mmBTU fuel input in the phase I period (1995 - 99). We calculate Luenberger productivity indicators using directional technology distance function for 209 units in 1990 - 1999. There is more potential to reduce pure technical inefficiency since it is the main source of inefficiency in phase I period. Productivity declined, hut it i not significantly different from the productivity growth of pre-phase I. So environmental policy is successful to reduce SO₂ emission without sacrificing productivity growth. Opportunity cost declined, but the opportunity cost of scrubber and "other" strategy increase. Third, we estimate the regulatory effect on strategy choice of 257 phase I units using multinomial logit model. We assume behavioral cost is a function of shadow input prices, output, SO₂ emissions and regulatory variables. Results suggest regulation significantly affect choices. Units located in high-sulfur coal states are more likely to choose scrubber, allowance or "other" strategy through shadow capital price effect. Allowance trade and sales restriction negatively affect allowance, scrubber or fuel switch strategy. Non-private units are more likely to choose allowance strategy while private units are likely to choose less uncertain scrubber and fuel switch. Units subject to stringent local regulation are more likely to choose "other" strategy and <b>scrubber</b> and <b>units</b> with substitution/compensation boilers are more likely to choose allowance and "other" strategies...|$|R
40|$|Concentrations of {{gaseous ammonia}} ([NH 3]) and aerosol {{ammonium}} ([NH 4 +]) were measured across Tenerife {{as part of}} the ACE‐ 2 "HILLCLOUD" experiment to assess the effect of cloud processing on the marine budget of reduced nitrogen (NHx). Several methods for measuring NH 3 were applied: continuous rotating <b>annular</b> denuder, diffusion <b>scrubber</b> and multi‐stage filter packs, with the latter also measuring NH 4 +. The measurement sites were located both upwind and downwind of the hill‐cloud. Terrestrial NH 3 sources provide a major constraint in addressing marine NHx from land‐based studies, and the measurements showed local NH 3 emissions from both decomposing potato fields and livestock. [NH 3] was correlated between upwind and downwind sites; at high [NH 3](> 0. 5 μg m− 3) values were larger downwind than upwind, indicating the importance of island sources. In contrast, at high [NH 4 +](> 0. 5 μg m− 3), [NH 4 +] was significantly smaller downwind than upwind, while at low [NH 4 +](0. 2 μg m− 3), the opposite was observed. The decrease in [NH 4 +] suggests that cloud processing in high [NH 4 +] conditions may enhance the evaporation of NH 3 from NH 4 + in cloud, while NH 4 + aerosol formation could occur at low [NH 4 +]. Analysis of the average diurnal variability in [NH 3] and [NH 4 +] at the different sites suggests that both NH 3 emissions and post‐cloud evaporation of NH 4 + to NH 3 are largest during the day, coupled with increased temperatures and reduced relative humidities. Although the marine NH 4 + aerosol is mostly present as non‐volatile ammonium sulphate, evaporation of NH 4 + at high [NH 4 +] may be explained by in‐cloud mixing with nitrate and chloride leading to the production of NH 4 NO 3 and NH 4 Cl which are subsequently volatilized on leaving the cloud...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{provide the}} first process {{simulation}} able to depict a complete {{life cycle inventory}} of a biomass gasification {{combined heat and power}} (CHP) plant. The model predicts the detailed mass and energy balances, minor compounds emissions (such as NOx, SOx, aromatics,etc.). It is based on a phenomenological approach for dryer, reactors (gasification and combustion) and <b>scrubber</b> modeling. Process <b>units</b> are modeled with Aspen Plus models completed with dedicated Fortran sub-models when more details are required. The gasifier is a Dual Fluidized Bed (DFB). It is decomposed in three sections, describing the three main mechanisms occurring in the reactor: wood pyrolysis, secondary reactions and char combustion. At the outlet of the gasifier, the complete composition of the syngas is predicted, which includes water, permanent gases, inorganics, particles and tars (phenol, benzene, toluene, styrene, indene, naphthalene, acenaphthylene, anthracene, phenanthrene, pyrene). Simulation results were validated against measurements from a pilot plant and other literature data. A wet conventional syngas cleaning system for gasification plant, including cyclone, catalytic tar cracker, syngas cooler, bag filters, water scrubber and wastewater treatment was considered and modeled. The complexity of tar composition allows a reliable determination of tar dew point. At the outlet of the cleaning system, syngas is burned in gas engines. Gaseous emissions (NOx, SOx, etc.) of the gas engines and the DFB combustor are also handled by the model as well as ashes and liquid waste. The predicted electrical and thermal efficiencies are 27 and 39 % respectively. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this project}} EER {{conducted}} a preliminary field {{evaluation of the}} integrated approach for mercury (Hg) and NO{sub x} control. The approach enhanced the 'naturally occurring' Hg capture by fly ash through combustion optimization, increasing carbon in ash content, and lowering ESP temperature. The evaluation took place in Green Station Units 1 and 2 located near Henderson, Kentucky and operated by Western Kentucky Energy. Units 1 and 2 are equipped with cold-side ESPs and wet <b>scrubbers.</b> Green Station <b>Units</b> 1 and 2 typically fire two types of fuel: a bituminous coal and a blend of bituminous coals based on availability. Testing of Hg emissions in Unit 2 without reburning system in operation and at minimum OFA demonstrated that efficiencies of Hg reduction downstream of the ESP were 30 - 40 %. Testing also demonstrated that OFA system operation at 22 % air resulted in 10 % incremental increase in Hg removal efficiency at the ESP outlet. About 80 % of Hg in flue gas at ESP outlet was present in the oxidized form. Testing of Hg emissions under reburning conditions showed that Hg emissions decreased with LOI increase and ESP temperature decrease. Testing demonstrated that maximum Hg reduction downstream of ESP was 40 - 45 % at ESP temperatures higher than 300 F and 60 - 80 % at ESP temperatures lower than 300 F. The program objective to demonstrate 80 % Hg removal at the ESP outlet has been met...|$|R
40|$|In such territories {{where food}} {{production}} is mostly scattered in several small / medium size or even domestic farms, {{a lot of}} heterogeneous residues are produced yearly, since farmers usually carry out different activities in their properties. The amount and composition of farm residues, therefore, widely change during year, according to the single production process periodically achieved. Coupling high efficiency micro-cogeneration energy units with easy handling biomass conversion equipments, suitable to treat different materials, would provide many important advantages to the farmers and to the community as well, so {{that the increase in}} feedstock flexibility of gasification units is nowadays seen as a further paramount step towards their wide spreading in rural areas and as a real necessity for their utilization at small scale. Two main research topics were thought to be of main concern at this purpose, and they were therefore discussed in this work: the investigation of fuels properties impact on gasification process development and the technical feasibility of small scale gasification units integration with cogeneration systems. According to these two main aspects, the present work was thus divided in two main parts. The first one is focused on the biomass gasification process, that was investigated in its theoretical aspects and then analytically modelled in order to simulate thermo-chemical conversion of different biomass fuels, such as wood (park waste wood and softwood), wheat straw, sewage sludge and refuse derived fuels. The main idea is to correlate the results of reactor design procedures with the physical properties of biomasses and the corresponding working conditions of gasifiers (temperature profile, above all), in order to point out the main differences which prevent the use of the same conversion unit for different materials. At this scope, a gasification kinetic free model was initially developed in Excel sheets, considering different values of air to biomass ratio and the downdraft gasification technology as particular examined application. The differences in syngas production and working conditions (process temperatures, above all) among the considered fuels were tried to be connected to some biomass properties, such elementary composition, ash and water contents. The novelty of this analytical approach was the use of kinetic constants ratio in order to determine oxygen distribution among the different oxidation reactions (regarding volatile matter only) while equilibrium of water gas shift reaction was considered in gasification zone, by which the energy and mass balances involved in the process algorithm were linked together, as well. Moreover, the main advantage of this analytical tool is the easiness by which the input data corresponding to the particular biomass materials can be inserted into the model, so that a rapid evaluation on their own thermo-chemical conversion properties is possible to be obtained, mainly based on their chemical composition A good conformity of the model results with the other literature and experimental data was detected for almost all the considered materials (except for refuse derived fuels, because of their unfitting chemical composition with the model assumptions). Successively, a dimensioning procedure for open core downdraft gasifiers was set up, by the analysis on the fundamental thermo-physical and thermo-chemical mechanisms which are supposed to regulate the main solid conversion steps involved in the gasification process. Gasification units were schematically subdivided in four reaction zones, respectively corresponding to biomass heating, solids drying, pyrolysis and char gasification processes, and the time required for the full development of each of these steps was correlated to the kinetics rates (for pyrolysis and char gasification processes only) and to the heat and mass transfer phenomena from gas to solid phase. On the basis of this analysis and according to the kinetic free model results and biomass physical properties (particles size, above all) it was achieved that for all the considered materials char gasification step is kinetically limited and therefore temperature is the main working parameter controlling this step. Solids drying is mainly regulated by heat transfer from bulk gas to the inner layers of particles and the corresponding time especially depends on particle size. Biomass heating is almost totally achieved by the radiative heat transfer from the hot walls of reactor to the bed of material. For pyrolysis, instead, working temperature, particles size and the same nature of biomass (through its own pyrolysis heat) have all comparable weights on the process development, so that the corresponding time can be differently depending on one of these factors according to the particular fuel is gasified and the particular conditions are established inside the gasifier. The same analysis also led to the estimation of reaction zone volumes for each biomass fuel, so as a comparison among the dimensions of the differently fed gasification units was finally accomplished. Each biomass material showed a different volumes distribution, so that any dimensioned gasification unit {{does not seem to be}} suitable for more than one biomass species. Nevertheless, since reactors diameters were found out quite similar for all the examined materials, it could be envisaged to design a single units for all of them by adopting the largest diameter and by combining together the maximum heights of each reaction zone, as they were calculated for the different biomasses. A total height of gasifier as around 2400 mm would be obtained in this case. Besides, by arranging air injecting nozzles at different levels along the reactor, gasification zone could be properly set up according to the particular material is in turn gasified. Finally, since gasification and pyrolysis times were found to considerably change according to even short temperature variations, it could be also envisaged to regulate air feeding rate for each gasified material (which process temperatures depend on), so as the available reactor volumes would be suitable for the complete development of solid conversion in each case, without even changing fluid dynamics behaviour of the unit as well as air/biomass ratio in noticeable measure. The second part of this work dealt with the gas cleaning systems to be adopted downstream the gasifiers in order to run high efficiency CHP units (i. e. internal engines and micro-turbines). Especially in the case multi–fuel gasifiers are assumed to be used, weightier gas cleaning lines need to be envisaged in order to reach the standard gas quality degree required to fuel cogeneration units. Indeed, as the more heterogeneous feed to the gasification unit, several contaminant species can simultaneously be present in the exit gas stream and, as a consequence, suitable gas cleaning systems have to be designed. In this work, an overall study on gas cleaning lines assessment is carried out. Differently from the other research efforts carried out in the same field, the main scope is to define general arrangements for gas cleaning lines suitable to remove several contaminants from the gas stream, independently on the feedstock material and the energy plant size The gas contaminant species taken into account in this analysis were: particulate, tars, sulphur (in H 2 S form), alkali metals, nitrogen (in NH 3 form) and acid gases (in HCl form). For each of these species, alternative cleaning devices were designed according to three different plant sizes, respectively corresponding with 8 Nm 3 /h, 125 Nm 3 /h and 350 Nm 3 /h gas flows. Their performances were examined on the basis of their optimal working conditions (efficiency, temperature and pressure drops, above all) and their own consumption of energy and materials. Successively, the designed units were combined together in different overall gas cleaning line arrangements, paths, by following some technical constraints which were mainly determined from the same performance analysis on the cleaning units and from the presumable synergic effects by contaminants on the right working of some of them (filters clogging, catalysts deactivation, etc.). One of the main issues to be stated in paths design accomplishment was the tars removal from the gas stream, preventing filters plugging and/or line pipes clogging At this scope, a catalytic tars cracking unit was envisaged as the only solution to be adopted, and, therefore, a catalytic material which is able to work at relatively low temperatures was chosen. Nevertheless, a rapid drop in tars cracking efficiency was also estimated for this same material, so that an high frequency of catalysts regeneration and a consequent relevant air consumption for this operation were calculated in all of the cases. Other difficulties had to be overcome in the abatement of alkali metals, which condense at temperatures lower than tars, but they also need to be removed in the first sections of gas cleaning line in order to avoid corrosion of materials. In this case a dry scrubber technology was envisaged, by using the same fine particles filter units and by choosing for them corrosion resistant materials, like ceramic ones. Besides these two solutions which seem to be unavoidable in gas cleaning line design, high temperature gas cleaning lines were not possible to be achieved for the two larger plant sizes, as well. Indeed, as the use of temperature control devices was precluded in the adopted design procedure, ammonia partial oxidation units (as the only considered methods for the abatement of ammonia at high temperature) were not suitable for the large scale units, because of the high increase of reactors temperature by the exothermic reactions involved in the process. In spite of these limitations, yet, overall arrangements for each considered plant size were finally designed, so that the possibility to clean the gas up to the required standard degree was technically demonstrated, even in the case several contaminants are simultaneously present in the gas stream. Moreover, all the possible paths defined for the different plant sizes were compared each others on the basis of some defined operational parameters, among which total pressure drops, total energy losses, number of units and secondary materials consumption. On the basis of this analysis, dry gas cleaning methods proved preferable to the ones including water scrubber technology in al of the cases, especially because of the high water consumption provided by water <b>scrubber</b> <b>units</b> in ammonia adsorption process. This result is yet connected to the possibility to use activated carbon units for ammonia removal and Nahcolite adsorber for chloride acid. The very high efficiency of this latter material is also remarkable. Finally, as an estimation of the overall energy loss pertaining the gas cleaning process, the total enthalpy losses estimated for the three plant sizes were compared with the respective gas streams energy contents, these latter obtained on the basis of low heating value of gas only. This overall study on gas cleaning systems is thus proposed as an analytical tool by which different gas cleaning line configurations can be evaluated, according to the particular practical application they are adopted for and the size of cogeneration unit they are connected to. ...|$|R
