5|$|Victoria Bridge {{which was}} built in 1836 <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>River</b> Avon, was an {{important}} early example of a cable-stayed bridge.|$|E
5|$|Although the Rivière des Prairies is {{much smaller}} than the Saint Lawrence, bridge {{construction}} there did not begin until the 1840s—when rapid construction began on three wooden toll bridges to what is now Laval, one of which, Pont des Saints-Anges, collapsed in the 1880s and was never rebuilt. The existence of regular ferry services <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> is attested from 1813, but these ferries were discontinued when the bridges opened. The first railroad <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> was opened in 1876, and the Bordeaux Railway Bridge is the oldest fixed link to Laval that is still standing. (Another bridge across Rivière des Mille Îles, which was part of the same line, collapsed in 1882 but was immediately rebuilt.) The highway construction boom of the 1960s and 1970s led to the construction of four new freeway bridges <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>river,</b> and the upgrading of the existing Pie IX Bridge to freeway standards.|$|E
50|$|The first dam {{was built}} <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Barakar <b>River,</b> a {{tributary}} of <b>the</b> Damodar <b>river</b> at Tilaiya in 1953. The second one was built <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Konar <b>River,</b> another tributary of <b>the</b> Damodar <b>river</b> at Konar in 1955. Two dams <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>rivers</b> Barakar and Damodar were built at Maithon in 1957 and Panchet in 1958. Both the dams are some 8 km upstream of the confluence point of <b>the</b> <b>rivers.</b> These four major dams are controlled by DVC. Durgapur Barrage was constructed downstream of the four dams in 1955, <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Damodar <b>river</b> at Durgapur in 1955, with head regulators for canals on either side for feeding an extensive system of canals and distributaries. In 1978, the government of Bihar (that was before {{the formation of the}} state of Jharkhand) constructed <b>the</b> Tenughat Dam <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Damodar <b>river</b> outside <b>the</b> control of DVC. It proposes constructing a dam <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Barakar <b>river</b> at Belpahari in Jharkhand state.|$|R

5|$|The 1st Battalion, 34th Infantry, {{had managed}} to block the North Korean's advance to Yongsan while the 19th Infantry was able to push it back and inflict {{substantial}} casualties. However, by the evening of August 6, KPA held firmly on to their bridgehead. Attempted crossings that night were repulsed to the south by South Korean forces, but {{an unknown number of}} reinforcements were moved <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> the night of August 6–7. On August 7–8, the North Koreans tried to move two more battalions <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> to the north, but were repulsed by 21st Infantry, which was still in place. The KPA battalions were shifted south to cross at the bridgehead, instead. By August 8, an estimated regiment of North Korean troops were across the Naktong.|$|E
5|$|The 4th North Korean Division, meanwhile, had {{constructed}} underwater bridges of sandbags, logs, and rocks, finishing {{the first on}} August 10. 4th Division used it to move trucks and heavy artillery as well as additional infantry and a few tanks <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>river.</b> By the morning of August 10, an estimated two KPA regiments were <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> and occupying fortified positions. Supplies continued to stream in through rafts. Task Force Hill mounted its attack, but was once again unable to make progress due to the newly established artillery. Its directive to attack quickly became one to dig in and hold its ground, and by nightfall the entire 4th North Korean Division was <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>river.</b> On August 10, elements of 4th North Korean began to move south, outflanking Task Force Hill. The next day, scattered North Korean elements attacked Yongsan. KPA repeatedly attacked at night, when American soldiers were resting and had greater difficulty resisting.|$|E
5|$|The NK 4th Division {{had in the}} {{meantime}} constructed underwater bridges of sandbags, logs and rocks, finishing the first one the day before. It moved trucks and heavy artillery <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> over this bridge, as well as additional infantry and a few tanks. By the morning of 10 August close to two full North Korean regiments were <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> and occupying fortified positions. After a series of unsuccessful counterattacks, the threat to Yongsan necessitated more U.S. reinforcements. As U.S. casualties mounted, a frustrated Walker ordered the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade to the area. They mounted a massive offensive on Cloverleaf Hill and Obong-ni beginning at 08:00 on 17 August, unleashing all available heavy weapons: artillery, mortars, M26 Pershing tanks, and airstrikes.|$|E
50|$|The {{route for}} the Taff Vale Extension {{required}} {{the construction of}} two significant viaducts across two major <b>river</b> valleys: one <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Ebbw <b>River</b> (<b>the</b> Crumlin Viaduct), and one 4 mi further west <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Rhymney <b>River,</b> <b>the</b> Hengoed Viaduct.|$|R

5|$|The dog {{leaves the}} house and swims back <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>river,</b> {{down the street and}} into its master and mistress's home. In a study, the child's father is sitting; Rover enters and pleads with him to follow. They leave, with the man {{following}} the dog <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> in a boat to the slums. They enter the room where the child is hidden, and the father quickly takes the child from the beggar woman and leaves with the dog. Upon their return home, the child is placed in the arms of the mother, while Rover prances happily around them.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, Wolfe's troops {{landed on}} the south {{bank of the river}} at Point Levis, nearly directly <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> from Quebec; an artillery battery was established there in early July that nearly levelled the lower town by bombardment.|$|E

50|$|The PD Draw is an {{abandoned}} and partially dismantled railroad bridge <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Passaic <b>River</b> from Newark to Kearny. The Lincoln Highway Passaic River Bridge carries Truck 1/9 <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Passaic <b>River</b> {{and is currently}} the southern most crossing of <b>the</b> <b>river</b> before it reaches the bay. It is a vertical-left bridge and was the route that the Lincoln Highway used to cross <b>the</b> <b>river.</b> <b>The</b> Pulaski Skyway, the most famous bridge entirely in New Jersey, carries Route 1/9 <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Passaic <b>River,</b> Kearny Point, and <b>the</b> Hackensack <b>River</b> from Newark through Kearny to Jersey City.|$|R
50|$|At {{the north}} end of the bay at Kearny Point, the mouths of both the Passaic and <b>the</b> Hackensack <b>River</b> meet at <b>the</b> tip of a {{peninsula}} once known as New Barbadoes Neck. In order to build the line, the CNJ built bridges <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>rivers,</b> with service beginning in 1869. The original bridge was replaced in 1888. In 1912, the 212 ft swing span was relocated 185 ft upstream to create another bridge on a new alignment. <b>The</b> entire line <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>rivers</b> and Kearny Point was raised about 30 ft to avoid conflicts with maritime traffic in the newly developing Port Newark.|$|R
5|$|After {{about half}} of his army had been ferried into Indiana, the Union gunboat USS Elk and an armed private ship, the Grey Eagle, arrived on the scene. The Elk fired a shot into {{the deck of the}} Alice Dean as it tried to escape to the shoreline. Both of the Union ships were wooden, and as the Confederate {{artillery}} opened fire, they quickly retreated upriver towards Louisville to avoid being destroyed. The crossing resumed again. In total, it took seventeen hours for Morgan to ferry his now 2,000 men and supplies <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>river.</b> By listening in on the telegraph, he learned that Brig. Gen. Edward H. Hobson with a force of 4,000 cavalry was advancing on his position from the south. The lead elements of the Union force arrived in Brandenburg at about 8:00 pm, where the Confederate rearguard was able to delay their advance long enough for Morgan's artillery to be carried <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>river.</b> On the last trip across, most of the rearguard was able to escape, but several were left behind and captured.|$|E
5|$|At 19:00 that evening, {{following}} the clearance of nearby Pakchon by D Company 3 RAR, the Australians sent two companies <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> {{to establish a}} bridgehead and prevent the North Koreans from consolidating their position on the western bank. A and B Companies subsequently established defensive positions {{on either side of}} the road. Shortly afterwards North Korean forces were detected forming up for an assault on the right flank against B Company, and these preparations were broken up with mortars. The North Koreans then engaged the forward Australian companies with mortar fire which was largely ineffective. However, by 22:30 North Korean activity increased significantly, with heavy small arms fire causing a number of casualties among the Australians which perilously had to be evacuated under fire by boat across the fast flowing tidal river. Further artillery support was called-in by the Australians at 23:00 in response to renewed concentrations by the North Koreans in preparation for an assault. Meanwhile, the Australians sent another platoon <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> to reinforce the companies on the western bank.|$|E
5|$|Averell had {{anticipated}} resistance at the river, and had Powell's Brigade ready. Major Seymour B.
