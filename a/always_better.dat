500|$|Lukather's {{approach}} to engineering his {{sound in the}} studio is usually simple. He is not known for doing {{a large number of}} takes or for incorporating much overdubbing—rather, he has a reputation for doing only single takes for many parts. He has said about this approach: [...] "If a solo didn't work—either because I didn't have the right sound, or because I wasn't inspired at that moment—I'd just move on. A part either works or it doesn't. You can't batter it into submission, or force inspiration to save you. It's <b>always</b> <b>better</b> to just surrender, and then come back later to give it a go with fresh ears." [...] Although he enjoys the technical mastery that is possible in the studio, Lukather prefers the dynamic of performing live on stage. He has stated that dynamics are the most important element of producing a recording with good sound quality.|$|E
500|$|Brin's mother, Eugenia, {{has been}} {{diagnosed}} with Parkinson's disease. In 2008, he {{decided to make a}} donation to the University of Maryland School of Medicine, where his mother is being treated. Brin used the services of 23andMe and discovered that although Parkinson's is generally not hereditary, both he and his mother possess a mutation of the LRRK2 gene (G2019S) that puts the likelihood of him developing Parkinson's in later years between 20% and 80%. When asked whether ignorance was not bliss in such matters, he stated that his knowledge means that he can now take measures to ward off the disease. An editorial in The Economist magazine states that [...] "Mr Brin regards his mutation of LRRK2 as a bug in his personal code, and thus as no different from the bugs in computer code that Google’s engineers fix every day. By helping himself, he can therefore help others as well. He considers himself lucky. ... But Mr. Brin was making a much bigger point. Isn’t knowledge always good, and certainly <b>always</b> <b>better</b> than ignorance?" ...|$|E

VanDerWerff also positively critiqued the manner in which [...] "the monster [...] works on a metaphorical level as well". He concluded that the episode's main theme—that [...] "adness is <b>always</b> <b>better</b> when shared by two"—was a [...] "great idea" [...] that resulted in [...] "one of the greatest episodes the show ever did". John Keegan from Critical Myth awarded the episode a 7 out of 10 and called it [...] "a pleasant enough diversion" [...] from the then-upcoming series feature film. He wrote that, while the episode fits the mold of [...] "the traditional late-season summary of the evolving character dynamic", the entry manages to frame Scully’s psychology [...] "in the limelight" [...] without actually [...] "emphasiz Scully herself".|$|E

2500|$|Programming {{languages}} include {{features to}} help prevent bugs, such as static type systems, restricted namespaces and modular programming. For example, when a programmer writes (pseudocode) LET REAL_VALUE PI = [...] "THREE AND A BIT", although this may be syntactically correct, the code fails a type check. Compiled languages catch this without having to run the program. Interpreted languages catch such errors at runtime. Some languages deliberate exclude features that easily lead to bugs, {{at the expense of}} slower performance: the general principle being that, it is almost <b>always</b> <b>better</b> to write simpler, slower code than inscrutable code that runs slightly faster, especially considering that maintenance cost is substantial. For example, the Java programming language does not support pointer arithmetic; implementations of some languages such as Pascal and scripting languages often have runtime bounds checking of arrays, at least in a debugging build.|$|E
2500|$|Although many {{arguments}} {{in favor of}} EM guns revolve around the assumption that greater muzzle velocity is <b>always</b> <b>better,</b> this is open to challenge. Parametric relationships between range, payload weight, and launch velocity show {{that this is not a}} strong argument for many suggested EM gun applications. For example, due to lower aerodynamic drag at launch, a slower but heavier projectile may actually fly farther than a lighter faster one, making the velocity limitations of chemical propulsion perfectly acceptable. In addition, explosive fragmentary warhead lethality is largely unaffected by velocity and does not require more demanding hit-to-kill guidance electronics that may not survive extremely high gun launch accelerations. [...] Significantly, explosively formed penetrator and shaped charge warheads already drive what is technically a kinetic energy penetrator to velocities well in excess of EM gun launch capabilities, up to 8 km/s for a shaped charge, upon detonation with the target; and it has been demonstrated that with respect to armor penetration, increased impact velocity much above 2 km/s does not necessarily result in a deeper hole; (although the crater may be wider as more energy is deposited with increased impact velocity).|$|E

She bought herself a completely new wardrobe and brought her mother from New York. Like most people, Caspary did not get along with Harry Cohn, and after one spat, she no longer received writing assignments. Since her contract had five more months, she merely stopped going to the studio and spent her days at the beach while her agent picked up her paycheck. Again wanting to write her own material she got her contract canceled and set sail for New York.|$|E
