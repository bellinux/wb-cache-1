5000|$|Most rotaries had normal inlet valves, so {{that the}} fuel (and {{lubricating}} oil) was taken into the cylinders already mixed with air - as in a normal four-stroke engine. Although a conventional carburetor, {{with the ability to}} keep the fuel/air ratio constant over a range of throttle openings, was precluded by the spinning crankcase; it was possible to adjust the air supply through a separate flap valve or [...] "bloctube". The pilot needed to set the throttle to the desired setting (usually full open) and then adjust the fuel/air mixture to suit using a separate [...] "fine adjustment" [...] lever that controlled the <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> <b>valve</b> (in the manner of a manual choke control). Due to the rotary engine's large rotational inertia, it was possible to adjust the appropriate fuel/air mixture by trial and error without stalling it, although this varied between different types of engine, and in any case it required a good deal of practice to acquire the necessary knack. After starting the engine with a known setting that allowed it to idle, the air valve was opened until maximum engine speed was obtained.|$|E
50|$|Air-actuated valves are {{commonly}} used because of their simplicity, as they only require a compressed <b>air</b> <b>supply,</b> whereas electrically-operated <b>valves</b> require additional cabling and switch gear, and hydraulically-actuated valves required high pressure supply and return lines for the hydraulic fluid.|$|R

50|$|Another {{option for}} the surface {{supplied}} diver is to breathe <b>air</b> <b>supplied</b> through the pneumofathometer hose of the umbilical.

50|$|The tool uses air {{to pound}} {{its way through}} the ground {{underneath}} the obstruction. The tools is cylindrical in shape and ranges from one to eight inches in diameter and between three and six feet long. It is made from metal. Different manufacturers have different front styles and control mechanisms. Some have bullet shaped front and others have a stepped front similar to a unibit. Compressed air is used to power the tool, this air is run through a hydraulic hose with an oiler attachment to send oil through with the compressed air. The tool works in a way very similar to a jack hammer, inside the cylinder is a piston a valve opens and the air blows into the chamber forcing the piston forward which in turn propels the tool forward. The valve then shuts and the piston is pushed at a slower speed back in the tool, the valve reopens the piston pounds again and the tools moves forward. This process is continually repeated until the bore has run the intended distance. Both the lighter reverse hit of the piston and the friction of the ground surrounding the tool keep it moving forward instead of stopping. The speed of the tool can be controlled by a valve that connects the tools hose to the <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> this <b>valve</b> is outside the tool and remains accessible to the operator. As the tool pounds through the ground it compresses the soil. This compaction maintains the same diameter as the tool and leaves the bore hole through which the product is passed.|$|R
30|$|The {{independent}} {{pressure control}} system generally consists of <b>air</b> <b>supply,</b> electro-pneumatic proportional <b>valve,</b> chamber and pressure sensor, for example, constant pressure system [14], pneumatic-pressure-load system [15] and pneumatic pressure signal generator [16]. Lu et al. [14] presented a constant pressure control system {{that consisted of}} frictionless cylinders, a large tank and a pneumatic proportional pressure valve. A hybrid controller combined with Bang-Bang, PD controller and fuzzy PID was proposed to minimize the pressure fluctuations in cylinders. The pneumatic-pressure-load system researched in Ref. [15], applied to intensity testing devices, was constructed by electro-pneumatic proportional pressure valve. In order {{to adapt to the}} parameter variability of the pressure load system and obtain better dynamic and static performances, a linear quadratic Gaussian self-tuning pressure regulator was proposed to realize an adaptive control of pressure in the chamber. In the pneumatic pressure signal generator [16], electro-pneumatic proportional directional valve was used to control the air-flow rates of injecting and outflowing the chamber to regulate the pressure. Because of the nonlinear characteristics, an intelligent coordinate control method, combining expert intelligent coordinator, expert controller, and fuzzy neural network controller, was designed to improve dynamic response and steady state accuracy of the generator.|$|R

40|$|A well-functioning {{ventilation}} system is significant in achieving a healthy indoor environment. The <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> rate {{is one of}} the important factors in reducing the pollutant levels indoors. A study of the indoor environment has been made in new built apartments with modern energy-efficient mechanical supply and exhaust {{ventilation system}}s. Several parameters have been measured including the <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> rates, and the performance of the ventilation system. Interviews with the residents have also been made. This paper focuses on the <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> rates with the objective of examining these. The results show that the <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> rates are not fulfilling the building regulations in several apartments. Several reasons for the insufficient <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> rates have been identified; not only has the performance of the ventilation system itself but also the resident/user interaction with the ventilation system negatively impacted on the <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> rates. The experience of the residents including perception of noise has also lead to reduced <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> rates. The results illustrate the importance of including the interaction of the residents.

40|$|Abstract: By using {{numerical}} simulation method,the {{three-dimensional flow field}} of <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> cylinder using for displacement ventilation in industrial plant is analyzed. The internal structure, effective wind sent area and the shape of wind outlet small hole which affected the air outlet wind speed of <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> cylinder are researched. While compared with the simulated and measured result of the outlet velocity of the wind outlet small hole, the best feature parameters of wind speed in <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> cylinder has been gained. The result shows that: by changing the internal structure and decreasing the effective <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> area of the <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> cylinder, the wind speed from the air-outlet on the small hole can be more reasonably distributed; although by increasing the effective <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> area and changing the shape of outlet hole on <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> cylinder will make the air outlet be more effectively distributed, its value is unreasonable.

50|$|Fin brakes {{involve a}} metal fin being {{attached}} to the underside of a train. The track is fitted with two computer-controlled squeezing mechanisms which upon closing, squeeze the fin and either slow or stop the train. Fin brakes {{are the most common}} form of brakes on roller coasters today. Sometimes they are thick metal box beams (mostly on Bolliger & Mabillard roller coasters); others are thin metal plates. They slide between pairs of friction pads similar to automotive brake pads. Fin brakes are designed to be fail-safe, so that a loss of power will cause them to engage. Brakes are constructed according to a certain measure of redundancy, meaning the ride is usually fitted with one extra set of brakes to bring the train to a hold even if one brake fails. Opening is done by a bellows type of air-operated actuator. Each set of brakes is fitted with its own <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> system controlled by <b>supply</b> <b>valves</b> which open the brake when it is safe to do so. A heavy spring, usually made of steel, is used to hold the brake closed by default.|$|R
