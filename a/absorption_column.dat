We detect {{all of the}} sources, five of which are observed in X-ray for the first time. We study the X-ray spectral properties of the sample. The measured <b>absorption</b> <b>columns</b> in the quasars are different {{than those in the}} galaxies {{in the sense that the}} quasars show no absorption (with limits ∼ 10 ^ 21 cm^- 2) while the galaxies have large <b>absorption</b> <b>columns</b> (> 10 ^ 22 cm^- 2) consistent with previous findings. The median photon index of the sources with high S/N is Γ= 1. 84 ± 0. 24 and it is larger than the typical index of radio loud quasars. The arcsec resolution of Chandra telescope allows us to investigate X-ray extended emission, and look for diffuse components and X-ray jets. We found X-ray jets in two quasars (PKS 1127 - 145, B 2 0738 + 32), an X-ray cluster surrounding a CSS quasar (z= 1. 1, 3 C 186), detected a possible binary structure in 0941 - 080 galaxy and an extended diffuse emission in galaxy PKS B 2 1345 + 12. We discuss our results in the context of X-ray emission processes and radio source evolution.
