40|$|Infection {{with the}} dengue virus, {{transmitted}} by mosquito, ranges from asymptomatic or undifferentiated febrile illness to fatal <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>fever,</b> and affects up to 100 {{million people a}} year worldwide. 						Dengue <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>fever</b> is characterised by: a sudden onset of high fever; haemorrhages in the skin, gastrointestinal tract, and mucosa; and low platelet counts. Plasma leakage results in fluid in the abdomen and lungs. It typically occurs in children under 15 years. Severe dengue <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>fever</b> is called dengue shock syndrome. Dengue <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>fever</b> and dengue shock syndrome are major causes of hospital admission and mortality in children.

40|$|Viral <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>fevers</b> {{are caused}} by {{a wide range of}} viruses. There are 4 types of viruses well known to spread from person to person and able to cause {{nosocomial}} outbreaks with a high case fatality rate: an arenavirus (Lassa fever and more exceptionally the Junin and Machupo virus), a bunyavirus (Crimean-Congo <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>fever)</b> and the Filoviridae (Ebola and Marburg viruses). So far there have been {{only a limited number of}} imported cases of viral <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>fever</b> in industrialized countries. In recent years an increasing number of outbreaks of filovirus infections have occurred in Africa and in 2000 5 cases of Lassa fever were brought from Sierra Leone to Europe. Therefore European physicians should consider the possibility of a viral <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>fever</b> in an acutely ill patient just returning from Africa or South-America with fever for which there is no obvious cause. Such patients should be questioned for risk factors for viral <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>fever.</b> Using universal precautions for handling blood and body fluids and barrier nursing techniques there is little risk that if a patient with viral <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>fever</b> arrives in Belgium there will be secondary cases...|$|R
