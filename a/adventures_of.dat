5|$|Developed in part {{through the}} {{suggestions}} of Hergé's friends Bernard Heuvelmans and Jacques Van Melkebeke, Explorers on the Moon was produced following Hergé's extensive research into the possibility of human space travel– a feat that {{had yet to be}} achieved– with the cartoonist seeking for the work to be as realistic as possible. Hergé continued The <b>Adventures</b> <b>of</b> Tintin with The Calculus Affair, while the series itself became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. Critics have praised the illustrative detail of the book, but have expressed mixed views of the story.

The series was created by Belgium's Belvision Studios in 1957, directed by Ray Goossens and written by Greg. The studio divided King Ottokar's Sceptre into six 5-minute black-and-white episodes that diverted from Hergé's original plot in many ways. It was also adapted into a 1991 episode of The <b>Adventures</b> <b>of</b> Tintin television series by French studio Ellipse and Canadian animation company Nelvana.

5|$|The Shooting Star was a {{commercial}} success and {{was published in}} book form by Casterman shortly after its conclusion; the first Tintin volume to be originally published in the 62-page full-colour format. Hergé continued The <b>Adventures</b> <b>of</b> Tintin with The Secret of the Unicorn, while the series itself became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. The Shooting Star has received a mixed critical reception and {{has been one of}} the most controversial instalments in the series due to the anti-Semitic portrayal of its villain. The story was adapted for both the 1957 Belvision animated series, Hergé's <b>Adventures</b> <b>of</b> Tintin, and for the 1991 animated series The <b>Adventures</b> <b>of</b> Tintin by Ellipse and Nelvana.|$|E

5|$|<b>Adventures</b> <b>of</b> Mana is {{a remake}} of the 1991 Game Boy game Final Fantasy Adventure, {{which was the first}} entry in the Mana series. It is the second remake of Final Fantasy Adventure, the first being the Game Boy Advance game Sword of Mana, which had removed the {{connections}} to the Final Fantasy series in favor of being more connected {{to the rest of the}} Mana series. According to <b>Adventures</b> <b>of</b> Manas producer, Masaru Oyamada, the development team focused on not upsetting what had made the original game good, while adding things that had not been possible to do in the original version due to hardware limitations; they also aimed to make the game more comfortable and intuitive to play: for instance, switching armor and weapons and using items and magic was made easier, and shortcut commands were added. The game borrows some elements from the original Game Boy version, and some from Sword of Mana. For example, the first remake introduced the ability to play as the heroine, but <b>Adventures</b> <b>of</b> Mana, like the original, only has a male playable character; conversely <b>Adventures</b> <b>of</b> Manas battle system, user interface and sword attack are based on Sword of Manas rather than the original's. Kenji Ito, the composer for Final Fantasy Adventure, returned to create updated and more dramatic rearrangements for the remake.|$|E
5|$|Although The Castafiore Emerald {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} for making its characters follow a lead of false trails, {{it was not}} a commercial success due to the experimental nature of its narrative.
