5|$|There are {{traffic lights}} on the short section between Brayford Pool and Stamp End Lock, which are used to {{indicate}} {{the state of the}} river in times of flood. Green indicates that flows are low or normal, and boats can proceed along this stretch. Red indicates that flows are high and that great care is required. Flashing red indicates that flows <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>high</b> and boats must not use the section.|$|E
5|$|No seed is set when pollinators are excluded, {{indicating}} that seed set must be pollinator-limited. About 96% of fertilized follicles mature, and about 82% of seeds mature. These <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>high</b> numbers for Banksia, {{indicating that}} there are no problems with nutrient supply. This species produces an unusually high number of old flowerheads, or cones, per plant—typically more than 500. However, there are an unusually low number of follicles per cone—often only one. Thus the number of follicles per plant ends up roughly average for a Banksia species.|$|E

25|$|The {{potential}} risks <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>high.</b> The most recent {{data showed that}} the number of new cases in China rose by 70,000 in 2005, which led to some health officials to raise concerns that infections were moving from high-risk groups into the broader population. The ministry attributes 37% of the new cases to drug use and 28% to unprotected sex.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 95% {{of people}} with A-T have {{elevated}} serum AFP levels {{after the age of}} two, and measured levels of AFP appear to increase slowly over time. AFP levels <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>high</b> in the newborn, and normally descend to adult levels over the first year to 18 months. The reason for why individuals with A-T have elevated levels of AFP is not yet known.|$|E

In 2003 Bulwell gained the nation's attention after a Nottingham PC, Ged Walker, was killed here {{in the line of}} duty. PC Walker was dragged to his death as he attempted to arrest the driver of a stolen taxi; local resident David Parfitt was later sentenced to 13 years for his manslaughter.|$|E
25|$|The {{trunk of}} the Fig Tree is {{approximately}} 12 metres in circumference, and the canopy has a span of approximately 30 metres east to west, by 35 metres north to south. The lower branches of the tree near the trunk <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>high</b> and thick. The outer limits of the canopy droop down to near ground level on the western, northern and eastern sides. The crown of the canopy is between 10 and 15 metres high.|$|E

25|$|However, outcrossing may be {{abandoned}} {{in favor of}} parthenogenesis or selfing (which retain the advantage of meiotic recombinational repair) under conditions in which the costs of mating <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>high.</b> For instance, costs of mating are high when individuals are rare in a geographic area, such as when {{there has been a}} forest fire and the individuals entering the burned area are the initial ones to arrive. At such times mates are hard to find, and this favors parthenogenic species.|$|E
25|$|TIGAR {{can promote}} {{development}} or inhibition of several cancers {{depending on the}} cellular context. TIGAR can have some effect on three characteristics of cancer; the ability to evade apoptosis, uncontrolled cell division, and altered metabolism. Many cancer cells have altered metabolism where the rate of glycolysis and anaerobic respiration <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>high</b> whilst oxidative respiration is low, which is called the Warburg Effect (or aerobic glycolysis). This allows cancer cells to survive under low oxygen conditions, and use molecules from respiratory pathways to synthesise amino acids and nucleic acids to maintain rapid growth.|$|E
25|$|As a {{response}} to the electricity supply crisis (see The crisis below)., many consumers turned to alternative self-generation units such as small diesel generators, inverters, kerosene lamps or large power generators (for large industrial consumers). It is estimated that total installed capacity in 2006 was 5,518MW, which means that self-generation accounted for about 2,214MW, equivalent to 63% of the 3,394MW total capacity of public utilities and 38% of total installed capacity. The costs associated with this self-generation capacity <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>high</b> as they include equipment purchase, maintenance and fuel supply. This affects the residential, commercial and industrial sectors. For the latter, about 60% of its electricity consumption is self-generated.|$|E

25|$|Cairo {{also has}} many {{unregistered}} lead and copper smelters which heavily pollute the city. The {{results of this}} has been a permanent haze over the city with particulate matter in the air reaching over three times normal levels. It is estimated that 10,000 to 25,000 people a year in Cairo die due to air pollution-related diseases. Lead has been shown to cause harm to the central nervous system and neurotoxicity particularly in children. In 1995, the first environmental acts were introduced and the situation has seen some improvement with 36 air monitoring stations and emissions tests on cars. Twenty thousand buses have also been commissioned to the city to improve congestion levels, which <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>high.</b>|$|E
25|$|By far {{the biggest}} problem with the {{conventional}} approach is cost; solar cells require a relatively thick layer of doped silicon in order to have reasonable photon capture rates, and silicon processing is expensive. There {{have been a number of}} different approaches to reduce this cost over the last decade, notably the thin-film approaches, but to date they have seen limited application due to a variety of practical problems. Another line of research has been to dramatically improve efficiency through the multi-junction approach, although these cells <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>high</b> cost and suitable only for large commercial deployments. In general terms the types of cells suitable for rooftop deployment have not changed significantly in efficiency, although costs have dropped somewhat due to increased supply.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union in 1991, Yalta has struggled economically. Many of the nouveaux riches of ex-Soviet citizens began going to other European holiday resorts, now that they had the freedom and money to travel; conversely, the impoverishment of many ex-Soviet citizens meant that they could no longer afford to go to Yalta. The town's transport links have been significantly reduced with the end of almost all passenger traffic by sea. The longest trolleybus line in Europe goes from the train station in Simferopol to Yalta (almost 90km). Yalta is crowded in the vacation season (July–August) and prices for accommodation <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>high.</b> Most of the tourists are from countries of the former Soviet Union; in 2013, about 12% of tourists to the Crimea were Westerners from more than 200 cruise ships.|$|E
