5|$|According to British filmmaker Tony Rayns the film's {{presentation}} of the vanity of a man, neglecting his family, is <b>a</b> <b>critique</b> of historic men in feudal Japanese culture. In his relationship with Wakasa, Genjurō is insignificant and is seduced by something greater, that he can never comprehend. However, by neglecting his family, Genjurō failed to appreciate he has already been blessed with a good life, and in the process, loses it.|$|E
5|$|As a {{cultural}} critic, Said {{is known for}} the book Orientalism (1978), <b>a</b> <b>critique</b> of the cultural representations that are the bases of Orientalism—how the Western world perceives the Orient. Said’s model of textual analysis transformed the academic discourse of researchers in literary theory, literary criticism, and Middle-Eastern studies—how academics examine, describe, and define the cultures being studied. As a foundational text, Orientalism was controversial among the scholars of Oriental Studies, philosophy, and literature.|$|E
5|$|Feminism in {{psychology}} emerged as <b>a</b> <b>critique</b> {{of the dominant}} male outlook on psychological research where only male perspectives were studied with all male subjects. As women earned doctorates {{in psychology}}, females and their issues were introduced as legitimate topics of study. Feminist psychology emphasizes social context, lived experience, and qualitative analysis. Projects such as Psychology's Feminist Voices have emerged to catalogue the influence of feminist psychologists on the discipline.|$|E
40|$|The {{traditional}} approach to computer-based advice in medicine {{has been to}} design systems which simulate a physician's decision process. This paper describes {{a different approach to}} computer advice in medicine: <b>a</b> <b>critiquing</b> approach. <b>A</b> <b>critiquing</b> system first asks how the physician is planning to manage his patient and then critiques that plan, discussing {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the proposed approach, compared to other approaches which might be reasonable or preferred. Several critiquing systems are currently in different stages of implementation. The paper describes these systems and discusses the characteristics which make each domain suitable for critiquing. The critiquing approach may prove especially well-suited in domains where decisions involve a great deal of subjective judgement...|$|R

5|$|Feminist {{theory can}} also be seen at play in Stowe's book, with the novel as <b>a</b> <b>critique</b> of the patriarchal nature of slavery. For Stowe, blood {{relations}} rather than paternalistic relations between masters and slaves formed the basis of families. Moreover, Stowe viewed national solidarity as an extension of a person's family, thus feelings of nationality stemmed from possessing a shared race. Consequently, she advocated African colonization for freed slaves and not amalgamation into American society.|$|E
5|$|George Thomas Clark {{played an}} {{important}} role as an engineer on the project, reputedly taking the management of two divisions of the route including bridges over the River Thames at Lower Basildon and Moulsford and of Paddington Station. Involvement in major earth-moving works seems to have fed Clark's interest in geology and archaeology and he, anonymously, authored two guidebooks on the railway: one illustrated with lithographs by John Cooke Bourne; the other, <b>a</b> <b>critique</b> of Brunel's methods and the broad gauge.|$|E

5|$|Madhvacharya was {{critical}} of the teachings of Adi Shankara and argued the world is real and not an illusion. His Dvaita Vedanta gained popularity, enabling him to establish eight mathas in Udupi.

5|$|The Sermons, a {{political}} treatise composed {{in the guise}} of sermons, went almost unnoticed by contemporaries. In the Sermons, Skarga discusses what he sees as the problems of the ailing Commonwealth: lack of patriotism, internal quarrels, tolerance of heretics, the king's relative powerlessness, perverse laws (<b>a</b> <b>critique</b> of the nobility's Golden Freedoms), and immorality. Another notable aspect of the book is its focus on the desperate plight of the serfs (the peasants).|$|E

5|$|The film, {{released}} on 8 September 2010 during the Eid ul-Fitr holiday, {{was meant to}} show different views of Islam; however, {{it has also been}} interpreted as <b>a</b> <b>critique</b> of the current Muhammadiyah leadership. It was seen in theatres by over 1 million people– the only Indonesian film of 2010 to do so. It also received favourable critical reception, winning the 2011 Bandung Film Festival after being refused a nomination at the 2010 Indonesian Film Festival. However, some Muslim critics decried it as being too liberal.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} depicts 125 wedding guests. As was customary in the Renaissance period, the brides {{wore black}} and men wore codpieces. Voyeurism is depicted {{throughout the entire}} art work; dancing was disapproved of by the authorities and the church, and the painting {{can be seen as}} both <b>a</b> <b>critique</b> and comic depiction of a stereotypical oversexed, overindulgent, peasant class of the times.|$|E
5|$|These views {{informed}} {{his novel}} Quo Vadis (1896). This story of early Christianity in Rome, with protagonists struggling against the Emperor Nero's regime, draws parallels between repressed early Christians and contemporary Poles; and, {{due to its}} focus on Christianity, it became widely popular in the Christian West. The triumph of spiritual Christianity over materialist Rome was <b>a</b> <b>critique</b> of materialism and decadence, and also an allegory for {{the strength of the}} Polish spirit.|$|E

After the paper collapsed, he {{returned}} to film, film a piece entitled Djaoeh Dimata for the Netherlands Indies Civil Administration in 1948. This was followed by two additional films, Anggrek Bulan (Moon Orchid; 1948) and Gadis Desa (Maiden from the Village; 1949), both based on plays he wrote several years earlier. In 1950, Andjar published his only novel, Noesa Penida, <b>a</b> <b>critique</b> of the Balinese caste system, which followed lovers from different levels of the social hierarchy. Meanwhile, he continued to write and publish paperback serials adapted from local films.|$|E
5|$|After eight years, Fetter {{returned}} to academia and finally completed his B.A. in 1891. In 1892, Jeremiah W. Jenks—who had taught Fetter at Indiana University—acquired a teaching position at Cornell University {{at the new}} President White School of History and Political Science and subsequently secured a fellowship for Fetter at that institution. Fetter completed his Master of Philosophy degree the same year. Jenks then convinced Fetter to study, as Jenks himself had, under Johannes Conrad at the Sorbonne in Paris, France. Fetter earned his Ph.D. in 1894 from the University of Halle in Germany, where he wrote his doctoral dissertation, <b>a</b> <b>critique</b> of Malthusian population theory.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{described}} subspecies, a 1989 morphometrical {{study by}} Humphrey and Setzer separated only two—O. p. natator from much of Florida (including O. p. coloratus, O. p. planirostris, O. p. sanibeli, and O. p. floridanus, {{as well as}} O. p. argentatus) and O. p. palustris {{from the rest of}} the range (including O. p. texensis). However, Whitaker and Hamilton in their 1998 book on the Mammals of the Eastern United States recognized O. p. planirostris and O. p. sanibeli as separate subspecies, but merged all others into O. p. palustris, and placed O.argentatus as a separate species; their classification was based on their emphasis of overwater gaps as agents of biological diversification and <b>a</b> <b>critique</b> of shortcomings in Humphrey and Setzer's study, not on a reanalysis of the data.|$|E

5|$|Angelou was {{challenged}} by her friend, author James Baldwin, and her editor, Robert Loomis, {{to write an}} autobiography that was also a piece of literature. Reviewers often categorize Caged Bird as autobiographical fiction because Angelou uses thematic development and other techniques common to fiction, but the prevailing critical view characterizes it as an autobiography, a genre she attempts to critique, change, and expand. The book covers topics common to autobiographies written by Black American women {{in the years following}} the Civil Rights Movement: a celebration of Black motherhood; <b>a</b> <b>critique</b> of racism; the importance of family; and the quest for independence, personal dignity, and self-definition.|$|E
5|$|Feminist {{theory is}} the {{extension}} of feminism into theoretical or philosophical fields. It encompasses work {{in a variety of}} disciplines, including anthropology, sociology, economics, women's studies, literary criticism, art history, psychoanalysis and philosophy. Feminist theory aims to understand gender inequality and focuses on gender politics, power relations, and sexuality. While providing <b>a</b> <b>critique</b> of these social and political relations, much of feminist theory also focuses on the promotion of women's rights and interests. Themes explored in feminist theory include discrimination, stereotyping, objectification (especially sexual objectification), oppression, and patriarchy.|$|E
5|$|Goffman's {{early works}} consist of his {{graduate}} writings of 1949–53. His master's thesis was {{a survey of}} audience responses to a radio soap opera, Big Sister.

Other writings of the period include Symbols of Class Status (1951) and On Cooling the Mark Out (1952). His doctoral dissertation, Communication Conduct in an Island Community (1953), presented a model of communication strategies in face-to-face interaction, and focused on how everyday life rituals affect public projections of self.|$|E
