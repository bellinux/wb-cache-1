500|$|As Netflix {{does not}} reveal {{subscriber}} viewership numbers {{for any of}} their original series, Symphony Technology Group compiled data for the season based on a sample size of 15,000 people using software on their phones that measures television viewing by detecting a program's sound. According to Symphony, from September to December 2015, episodes of Jessica Jones averaged 4.8 million viewers during a 35-day viewing cycle. The data was presented by Alan Wurtzel, NBCUniversal president of research and media development, in a presentation aimed to provide [...] "perspective" [...] when stating [...] "digital platforms are hurting the traditional TV business". Netflix CCO Ted Sarandos responded to the data by saying that [...] "the whole methodology and the measurement and the data itself doesn’t reflect any sense of reality of <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> keep track of." [...] A further study from Symphony, for the same time period, found Jessica Jones {{to be one of}} the four most watched series in the 18 to 24 demographic, ahead of any broadcast network series. The marketing analytics firm Jumpshot determined the season was the fifth-most viewed Netflix season in the first 30 days after it premiered, garnering 26% of the viewers that the second season of Daredevil received, which was the most viewed season according to Jumpshot. Jumpshot, which [...] "analyzes click-stream data from an online panel of more than 100 million consumers", looked at the viewing behavior and activity of the company’s U.S. members, factoring in the relative number of U.S. Netflix viewers who watched at least one episode of the season.|$|E
2500|$|The {{philosophers}} of cosmology John Earman, Ernan McMullin, and Jesús Mosterín {{contend that}} [...] "in its weak version, the anthropic principle {{is a mere}} tautology, which does {{not allow us to}} explain anything or to predict <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> did not already know. In its strong version, it is a gratuitous speculation". A further criticism by Mosterín concerns the flawed [...] "anthropic" [...] inference from the assumption of an infinity of worlds to the existence of one like ours: ...|$|E
2500|$|Our {{meal that}} night was on a more luxurious scale than <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had tasted for some time. In {{addition}} to the usual spoonful of bully beef, we used {{up some of the}} remaining water in making some hot porridge and brewed up some tea. We also scraped up enough rum for a small tot all round. This we drank after supper, lying on a little sandbank and watching the sun sinking behind the dunes. [...] I cannot remember a meal that I enjoyed more or that seemed more wildly and agreeably extravagant. Extravagant it certainly was, for, when we had finished eating, there was no food left at all, and only enough water to half fill one water-bottle for each man.|$|E

60|$|And {{his wife}} was of the same nature--simple, blithe, and bonny--ready to make friends in a moment; and though she must have known all about us, never seeming to {{remember}} <b>anything</b> but <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were her nearest lady neighbours.|$|R
2500|$|Towards {{the end of}} The Return of the King, when Gandalf {{leaves the}} hobbits, he {{mentions}} {{that he wants to}} have a long talk with Bombadil, calling him a [...] "moss-gatherer". Gandalf says, in response to Frodo's query of how well Bombadil is getting along, that Bombadil is [...] "as well as ever", [...] "quite untroubled" [...] and [...] "not much interested in <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have done and seen", save their visits to the Ents. At the very end of The Lord of the Rings, as Frodo sails into the West and leaves Middle-earth, he has what seems to him the very experience that appeared to him in the house of Bombadil in his dream of the second night.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2004 Daymond told WHAMMO.com.au [...] "I think [...] {{knew that}} we were looking to do {{something}} a little different. As a company they'd just gone through some major infrastructure changes {{in the last few years}} and I think by talking to us and realising that we were maybe not as happy as we were on the label when we signed – that the label had changed a lot and the roster was completely different". In an interview for Rolling Stone in May 2011, Thornton told music journalist, Andrew McMillen, that the band's manager at the time [...] "couldn’t be fucked fighting the label for <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> wanted, and he'd made the decision that we were just going to go with whatever the label reckoned. Near the end, it was fucking soul-destroying for me".|$|E
2500|$|The role of our {{scientific}} {{image of}} the universe in a rational world view has always {{caught the attention of}} Mosterín. He has devoted much work to the epistemic analysis of cosmological theories and of the reliability of their claims. Together with John Earman, he has undertaken a thorough critical review of the paradigm of cosmic inflation. Earman and Mosterín conclude that, despite the widespread influence of the inflationary paradigm {{and the fact that it}} does not contradict any known results, there are as yet no good grounds for admitting any of the models of inflation into the standard core of scientific cosmology. He has also dealt with the role of speculation in cosmology. In particular, Mosterín has shown the multiple misunderstandings underlying the so-called anthropic principle and the use of anthropic explanations in cosmology. Mosterín concludes that [...] "in its weak version, the anthropic principle is a mere tautology, which does not allow us to explain anything or to predict <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> did not already know. In its strong version, it is a gratuitous speculation". Mosterín also points to the flawed “anthropic” inferences from the assumption of an infinity of worlds to the existence of one like ours: ...|$|E

40|$|Just like fingerprints, snowflakes or even malformed birthmarks, no fantasy fiction {{reader is}} the same.

60|$|He {{gave us the}} {{required}} assurance, and we thanked him, but he still hung about, {{and seemed to be}} dissatisfied, so we asked him if there was <b>anything</b> further <b>that</b> <b>we</b> could do for him; and Harris, who is of a chummy disposition, offered him a bit of bread and jam.|$|R
60|$|First {{we landed}} {{on one of}} the small islands and ran all over it, but saw nothing worthy of {{particular}} notice. Then we landed on a larger island, on which were growing a few cocoa-nut trees. Not having eaten <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> morning, <b>we</b> gathered a few of the nuts and breakfasted. After this we pulled straight out to sea, and landed on the coral reef.|$|R
5000|$|Before {{the hiring}} of Jerry Richardson, the Lady Chieftains were a losing {{basketball}} team at Shiprock High School. Interest was low in the girls basketball program and rival school Kirtland Central High School had been the state champions for 8 consecutive years. Richardson set out to change this attitude among the Navajo community of Shiprock. To quote him [...] "I had never been associated with <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> lost. <b>We</b> had to change some attitudes.".|$|R
60|$|Will {{you allow}} me to advise you not to? It's so easy to say too much; it's never unwise to say too little. I beseech you not to say <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> should both of us regret.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have sent}} for me, Peter--I beg pardon. I was so glad when you sent. I {{would have come}} before, only I was afraid {{that you would be}} annoyed. Is there <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can do for you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I believe I do," [...] said de Lescure; [...] "but {{why do you}} {{not speak}} out? You are not likely, I think, to say or to propose <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> shall not approve of--that is, Victorine and I." ...|$|E

The Golden Age of Television was an age where everybody was learning. There were no experts, so there was nobody {{to tell us what}} to do." [...] -Bob Markell ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No matter! I {{only want}} to seem an old married woman to the general public. But the {{application}} {{of it is that}} you must be careful not to contradict me, or cross me in <b>anything,</b> so <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can be like the Leonards very much sooner than they became so. The great object is not to have any hitchiness; and you know you ARE provoking--at times." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think it}} is just as Bob says. We shan't be doing <b>anything</b> but <b>that</b> which <b>we</b> have a perfect right to do, and if you can remain away from your {{business}} so long, I say let's go." ...|$|R
60|$|I glanced {{towards the}} bedside, and {{was shocked at}} the deathly pallor of his face. His eyes were half closed. He had not the air of hearing <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> said. I walked towards {{the door with the}} doctor.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{should have}} added, Captain Dunwoodie," [...] cried his {{careless}} comrade, [...] "if {{you could find}} either; for nearly half our army has marched down the road, and may be, by this time, under the walls of Fort George, for <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> know to the contrary." ...|$|E

"You {{must always}} send up if {{anything}} is wanted, Mr. Greg; whenever there is any illness in the village we always keep a stock of soups and jellies, and Mrs. Cunningham is almoner in general.

6000|$|... "He {{will never}} tell us <b>anything</b> again <b>that</b> <b>we</b> shall believe," [...] {{one of the}} attacking party said. [...] "I'm sorry we let a liar like him lead us on to what we've done against you, and I'll agree we won't make such a mistake again, if you'll call it settled. Come down to the Liberty Tree with us, you two fellows, and let's see what's going on there." ...|$|R

5000|$|He {{is quoted}} in The Guardian as stating that I tell my friends: every year I’ve got less and less, {{and every year}} I’m a happier man.

60|$|Not {{one single}} sentence. All those demands are fair. We have not. asked <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are not {{entitled}} to ask. What I said up in London, I say again now: there is not anything on that {{piece of paper that}} a just man should not ask, and a just man give.|$|E

"So we will," [...] laughed McCoy in gruff tones, [...] "and it's my {{notion that}} there's a natural barrier round that island which will go further to defend us agin the King's ships than <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> could do.

6000|$|The {{story is}} splendidly constructed; its style {{is strong and}} [...] inimitable, and its action and character-drawing deserve [...] the highest praise.

5000|$|Further elaborating on {{his guitar}} work, Delson said, [...] "I love the {{acoustic}} work on 'Sharp Edges'. I really {{like all of}} the layering of guitars on 'Invisible' as well. There's also a really unique presentation of the guitar {{in a way that}} I don’t think we’ve ever done on a song called 'Sorry For Now'.
