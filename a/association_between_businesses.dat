40|$|This {{study is}} the first to explore the <b>association</b> <b>between</b> <b>business</b> cycles and {{workplace}} accidents using Icelandic data. The relationship is evaluated for the entire labor market, for specific sectors, by gender and by the severity of injuries. Most prior research has found workplace accidents to be pro-cyclical. Hypothesized reasons include increased labor supply and greater work intensity in upswings, and that accidents {{are more likely to be}} reported. Aggregate data for workplace accidents from the Administration of Occupational Safety and Health and several macroeconomic indicators from Statistics Iceland and Directorate of Labour were examined. The time series were non-stationary so first differences were used to detrend them. Their relationship was then examined using a linear regression model. Data from the Directorate of Health in Iceland and Statistics Iceland were used to calculate the relative risk of an accident. Pro-cyclical <b>associations</b> <b>between</b> <b>business</b> cycles and work-place accidents were observed, particularly in construction, in commerce and for men. The results of the relative-risk calculations indicated that workers were at considerably greater risk of having an accident in 2007 than in 2004 - 2006 and 2008 - 2011. By comparing the different estimations of the study, one can conclude that only a small part of the variability of risk can be explained by changes in labour supply. Increased risk at work, given the labor supply, seems to be a more significant reason for increased prevalence of accidents during periods of economic expansion...|$|R

This model depicts the influence of organisational performance on employee attitudes and the role ofHRM practice as a mediator between the two. It was tested using data collected from employee surveys and management interviews in 32 small firms. The results suggest that employees in firms with better business performance have more positive attitudes towards three attitude measures (overall perceptions of work, job autonomy and the perceived link between reward and performance) and that the <b>association</b> <b>between</b> <b>business</b> performance and employee attitudes is partially mediated by HRM practices.

We use the resource-based theories to suggest that collaborative board oversight of CCS, competencies relating to CCS information and financial management, and a CCS-related continuous audit program can contribute to business process performance improvements and overall firm performance.

Environmental communication is concerned at a basic level with the way that human beings create their own signs and continually encounter, interpret and use the signs created by others. The context as well as time is crucial for understanding and managing the effects of environmental communication among stakeholders. The ultimate goal of environmental communication is to protect the environment by enlisting active participation of various stakeholders of environment protection, management and development. The degree of coverage of environmental management systems varies from company to company. These companies use various channels and tools to communicate their environmental performance and to manage their environmental impacts. An increasing number of firms publish information on the environmental impact of their activities. Corporate Sustainability Communication is a proactive, long-term, future oriented plan for balancing financial, social, and environmental issues with a specific, sustainable plan.

The research finally develops a preliminary conceptual strategic MCs model for SPPs that fits the context of developed countries and concentrates on the strategic aspects of MCs. Design/methodology/approach – The paper is largely conceptual and is based on an extensive literature review and secondary data; strengthened through additional and focused quantitative and qualitative data. Findings – The findings indicate an increasing <b>association</b> <b>between</b> <b>business</b> and political marketing, an environmental context that stimulates and nurtures a symbiotic relationship between parties and voters, an enhanced role of “perception management”, and substantial divergence of SPP reality from classical theory.

(The {{first round of the}} BEEPS was implemented in 1999.) Four important conclusions arise from the analysis. First, qualitative measures of the business environment in the BEEPS appear to provide reasonably accurate measures, both across various business environment dimensions and countries and over time. These qualitative measures are compared with both objective statistical measures, where possible, and quantitative business environment measures from the BEEPS. Second, qualitative measures of the business environment show that in virtually all transition economies the business environment has improved significantly between 1999 and 2002. Third, the analysis of quantitative measures of the business environment shows a strong <b>association</b> <b>between</b> <b>business</b> obstacles, added costs and constraints on business, such as corruption, private security protection or obstacles, added costs and constraints on business, such as corruption, private security protection or reliance on internal sources of finance. However, evidence suggests that the nature of corruption in tax administration, which tends to be centralised, is less costly to firms than is corruption in business regulation, which is decentralised. Fourth, the analysis of firm investment and growth shows that the quality of the business environment in 1999 (based on qualitative measures) is significantly and positively associated with investment by firms in the period 1999 to 2001. It also shows that state capture significantly boosts the investment and real revenue growth rates of firms that engage in this activity, but holds back the growth performance of other firms.
