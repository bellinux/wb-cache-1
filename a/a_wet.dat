5|$|<b>A</b> <b>wet</b> bell, or open bell, {{is similar}} to a diving stage in concept, but has an air space, open to the water at the bottom in which the divers, or at least their heads, can shelter during ascent and descent. <b>A</b> <b>wet</b> bell {{provides}} more comfort and control than a stage and allows for longer time in the water. Wet bells are used for air and mixed gas, and divers can decompress using oxygen from a mask at 12m.|$|E

40|$|Unsaturated {{hydraulic}} conductivity {{is one of}} the most difficult parameters to measure because of the time involved and the limited suction measurement range. In this study, <b>a</b> new <b>wetting</b> front advancing method was developed for measuring unsaturated {{hydraulic conductivity}}. In this method, an initially air-dried soil column is subjected to <b>a</b> <b>wetting</b> event. During the <b>wetting</b> process, <b>a</b> <b>wetting</b> front advances with time and gives <b>a</b> <b>wetting</b> front advancing velocity function. A new interpretative procedure is developed to calculate the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity based on the monitored water content, suction, and wetting front advancing velocity. The proposed technique is used to measure the unsaturated hydraulic conductivities of five colluvial soils. The results indicate that the proposed technique is timesaving (i. e., requires several days for a complete test) and can be applicable over wide ranges of suctions and unsaturated hydraulic conductivities. The measured unsaturated hydraulic conductivity using the wetting front advancing method is similar to that obtained when using the instantaneous profile method. © 2011 Taylor & Francis Group, London...|$|R

5|$|The {{development}} of effective time-delay shells {{at the end}} of World War I made this scheme much less effective, as the intact shell would penetrate layers of weak armour and explode deep inside the ship.

30|$|This diatom culture {{media was}} then {{introduced}} into the fluid cell, and SAXS measurements were made at each point every 10 minutes up to 360 minutes, which corresponds {{to the length of}} time required for a diatom attachment assay. To obtain a SAXS profile of immersed superhydrophobic surfaces in the fully wetted regime, the fluid within the cell was exchanged with ethanol, followed by water. The ethanol was used as <b>a</b> <b>wetting</b> agent, to remove air from the interface and thereby forcing the immersed superhydrophobic surfaces into <b>a</b> <b>wetted</b> Wenzel state when water was reintroduced.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Although self-assembled {{quantum dots}} are grown on wetting layers, most {{simulations}} exclude the wetting layer. The neglected {{effects on the}} electronic structure of a pyramidal InAs quantum dot embedded in a GaAs matrix are investigated based on the effective one electronic band Hamiltonian, the energy and position dependent electron effective mass approximation, and a finite height hard-wall 3 D confinement potential. By comparing quantum dots with <b>wetting</b> layers and <b>a</b> dot without <b>a</b> <b>wetting</b> layer, {{we find that the}} presence of <b>a</b> <b>wetting</b> layer may effect the electronic structure essentially. ...|$|R

5|$|According to the National Trust, {{the grass}} is trimmed {{regularly}} and the giant is fully re-chalked every 25 years. Traditionally, the National Trust has relied on sheep from surrounding farms to graze the site. However, in 2008 a lack of sheep, coupled with <b>a</b> <b>wet</b> spring causing extra plant growth, forced a re-chalking of the giant, with 17 tonnes of new chalk being poured in and tamped down by hand. In 2006, the National Trust carried out the first wildlife survey of the Cerne Abbas Giant, identifying wild flowers including the green-winged orchid, clustered bellflower and autumn gentian, which are uncommon in England.|$|E
40|$|Aim To {{compare the}} sealing {{ability of the}} same root {{fillings}} when measured by a conventional fluid transport method that uses water or by a modified fluid transport method that uses <b>a</b> <b>wetting</b> fluid as tracer. Methodology The amount of fluid transport along the same root fillings (AH 26, cold lateral compaction of gutta-percha) was measured in a cross-over design in fluid transport set-ups using either water or <b>a</b> <b>wetting</b> fluid as tracer. Results A Wilcoxon signed-rank test revealed {{a significant difference in}} the amount of fluid transport measured along the same root fillings by the two fluid transport methods (P = 0. 013). The fluid transport method using <b>wetting</b> fluid detected <b>a</b> significantly higher percentage of root fillings with fluid transport (P = 0. 021).
