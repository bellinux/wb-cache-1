The poor water quality severely affects the ecology and represents {{a risk to}} human health. The water has a very limited value of use. This report presents an abatement programme with both technical and <b>accompanying</b> <b>measures.</b> In order to identify the major polluters several multi criteria analysis have been developed, discussed and evaluated. Technical measures for 23 "Hot spots" are proposed and ranked according to the cost/benefit ratio. Measures for agriculture {{have been based on}} previous work. The proposed abatement programme gives a significant reduction of the total pollution discharges in the region, and improves both local and regional water quality. The abatement programme will also contribute to the Czech Government's obligations to reduce the pollution to the Baltic Sea. <b>Accompanying</b> <b>measures</b> (policy, administrative including legal and economic measures) have been addressed in detail.

40|$|In Italy {{there are}} more than 500 000 {{building}} companies, employing on average three workers each. The companies face difficulties to keep up to date with legal provisions, due to their small size. European, national and regional legislation need a number of <b>accompanying</b> <b>measures</b> in order to be implemented effectively. Municipal administrations are over 8000 and have frequent contacts with the building companies. Furthermore the municipalities have the responsibility on town planning schemes and on building codes that for example regulate aesthetics and hygiene standards, and more recently may include specific energy efficiency standards and norms. Starting in 2003 a number of successful local experiences have been implemented, especially in Lombardia and in the Milan Province, where the practices of the building companies have been permanently modified. The pilot experience of some early adopter municipalities has spread, currently involving around 100 municipalities. Best practices show the effectiveness of monitoring activities in the construction sites and of incisive <b>accompanying</b> <b>measures</b> (training and information, technical support, focused economic incentives). In this perspective, the successful establishment of improved building codes is not intended as a mere approval of a new piece of legislation.
