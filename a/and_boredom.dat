While early tests of aptitude, such as Seashore's The Measurement of Musical Talent, sought to measure innate musical talent through discrimination tests of pitch, interval, rhythm, consonance, memory, etc., later research found these approaches to have little predictive power and to be influenced greatly by the test-taker's mood, motivation, confidence, fatigue, <b>and</b> <b>boredom</b> when taking the test.|$|E

He then progressed to appearing on stage as a performing member of the group, usually flamboyantly costumed. He quit the band on completing the promotional tour for the band's second album, For Your Pleasure, because of disagreements with lead singer Bryan Ferry <b>and</b> <b>boredom</b> with the rock star life.|$|E

Idle was eventually caught watching the X-rated film BUtterfield 8 (suitable for audiences aged 16 years and over under the contemporary film certificates) and stripped of his prefecture, though by that time he was head boy. Idle had already refused to be senior boy in the school cadet force, as he supported the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and {{had participated in the}} yearly Aldermaston March. Idle maintains that there was little to do at the school, <b>and</b> <b>boredom</b> drove him to study hard and consequently win a place at Cambridge University.|$|E

500|$|Their {{politics}} were made explicit in {{the lyrics of}} such early recordings as [...] "White Riot", which encouraged disaffected white youths to riot like their black counterparts; [...] "Career Opportunities", which addressed the alienation of low-paid, routinised jobs and discontent over the lack of alternatives; and [...] "London's Burning", about the bleakness <b>and</b> <b>boredom</b> {{of life in the}} inner city. Artist Caroline Coon, who was associated with the punk scene, argued that [...] "hose tough, militaristic songs were what we needed as we went into Thatcherism".

Furthermore, as winter developed, Borchgrevink's hopes that Cape Adare would escape the worst Antarctic weather proved false; in fact he had chosen a site which was particularly exposed to the freezing winds blown northwards from the inland ice.

40|$|Drawing on the Five Factor PersonalityModel and Self-Determination Theory, {{the current}} study {{examines}} the relations between three different kinds of well-being - engagement, <b>boredom,</b> <b>and</b> burnout- and personality, and evaluates whether basic need satisfaction has an incremental contribution over personality in explaining these types ofwell-being. In a sample of 255 students we found that agreeableness and neuroticismwere significantly related to each well-being dimension, whereas conscientiousness was only significantly related to engagement <b>and</b> to <b>boredom,</b> <b>and</b> extraversion being only significantly related to burnout. Need satisfaction significantly contributed to well-being, over and above personality. Results indicate that certain personality factors {{play a role in}} well-being, but that the fulfillment of the needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness is of additional importance...|$|R

500|$|During the American Civil War, {{music played}} a {{prominent}} role {{on both sides of}} the conflict: Union and Confederate. On the American Civil War battlefield, different instruments including bugles, drums, and fifes were played to issue marching orders or sometimes simply to boost the morale of one's fellow soldiers. Singing was also employed as a recreational activity but as a release from the inevitable tensions that come with fighting in a war, particularly a war in which the issue of freedom of a race is to be decided. In camp, music was a diversion away from the bloodshed, helping the soldiers deal with homesickness <b>and</b> <b>boredom.</b> [...] Soldiers of both sides often engaged in recreation with musical instruments, and when the opposing armies were near each other, sometimes the bands from both sides of the conflict played against each other on the night before a battle.|$|E

[...] Alex Macpherson of British newspaper The Guardian, [...] "Umbrella" [...] is [...] "evidence" [...] that Rihanna's [...] "strict work ethic is paying off", adding that she [...] "delivers [...] an impassioned declaration of us-against-the-world devotion". Tom Breihan of Pitchfork, though he complimented the production, dismissed Rihanna's voice which [...] "takes on an unpleasant icepick edge when she tries to fill {{the space between the}} slow-tempo beats", adding that the song is [...] "uncompelling as event-pop, particularly because of the disconnect between Rihanna's cold, clinical delivery and the comforting warmth of the lyrics".|$|E
