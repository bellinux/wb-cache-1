However, Braga went on to equalize with a last-minute goal, costing Benfica two points. On 15 October, Benfica won its third league game of the season by defeating Belenenses one–nil behind Marchena's goal. The team played Paços de Ferreira on the 21st, dropping two points in a 0–0 draw. Benfica played their last game of the month against Campomaiorense on the 29th, winning with a double from João Tomás, scored within <b>a</b> <b>space</b> <b>of</b> ten minutes from each other.

Hull's first Premier League season saw safety from relegation ensured on the last day of the season, although the club was relegated the following season after finishing 19th in the league. Three years later, Hull returned to the Premier League after finishing the 2012–13 season as Championship runners-up. In the 2013–14 season they achieved their highest ever league finish of 16th and were runners-up to Arsenal in their first ever FA Cup Final appearance. Since then, they have been relegated to the Championship and promoted again.|$|E
