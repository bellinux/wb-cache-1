5|$|There {{have been}} police {{stations}} in the town since 1857, when the first Police Station was rented. It had three cells and <b>a</b> <b>petty</b> session courtroom. A new police station was built in 1974, which underwent a major refurbishment in 2011, to become a police force hub for Mid Devon, with 72 staff members. The town acquired its first steam driven fire engine in 1914 which cost £100 and was paid for by voluntary subscription.|$|E
5|$|According to Kint, Söze {{began his}} {{criminal}} career as <b>a</b> <b>petty</b> drug dealer {{in his native}} Turkey. His legendary persona is born when rival Hungarian smugglers invade his house while he is away, rape his wife, and hold his children hostage; when Söze arrives, they kill one of his children and demand he surrender his business. Instead, Söze kills his own family and {{all but one of}} the Hungarians, who he knows will tell the Mafia what has happened. Once his family is buried, Söze targets the Hungarian Mafia, their families, friends, and people who owe them money. He goes underground, never again doing business in person.|$|E
5|$|From the {{beginning}} of its history to the first century AD Palmyra was <b>a</b> <b>petty</b> sheikhdom, and by the first century BC a Palmyrene identity began to develop. During {{the first half of}} the first century AD, Palmyra incorporated some of the institutions of a Greek city (polis); the concept of citizenship (demos) appears in an inscription, dated to AD 10, describing the Palmyrenes as a community. In AD 74, an inscription mentions the city's boule (senate). The tribal role in Palmyra is debated; during the first century, four treasurers representing the four tribes seems to have partially controlled the administration but their role became ceremonial by the second century and power rested in the hands of the council.|$|E

5|$|Harald {{was born}} in Ringerike, Norway in 1015 (or {{possibly}} 1016) to Åsta Gudbrandsdatter and her second husband Sigurd Syr. Sigurd was <b>a</b> <b>petty</b> king of Ringerike, and among the strongest and wealthiest chieftains in the Uplands. Through his mother Åsta, Harald {{was the youngest of}} King Olaf Haraldsson's (later Saint Olaf) three half-brothers. In his youth, Harald displayed traits of a typical rebel with big ambitions, and admired Olaf as his role model. He thus differed from his two older brothers, who were more similar to their father, down-to-earth and mostly concerned with maintaining the farm.|$|E
5|$|In From Alien to The Matrix: Reading Science Fiction Film, Roz Kaveney {{writes that}} Harold Andrews bullies Ellen Ripley, who is {{demoralized}} {{after the events}} of the first two Alien films. According to Kaveney, Andrews' method of directing the prison from monitors is ironic because David Fincher directed the film the same way (which Sigourney Weaver disliked). In David Fincher: Films That Scar, a literary analysis of the director, Mark Browning writes that Harold Andrews' totalitarian control of Fury 161 exempts Dillon's religiosity because Andrews views religion as a tool to prevent violence and provide control. Film critic Malcolm Johnson wrote in a Hartford Courant review that Andrews was <b>a</b> <b>petty</b> but potent dictator, similar to Benito Mussolini.|$|E
5|$|Washington Irving's {{parents were}} William Irving, Sr., {{originally}} of Quholm, Shapinsay, Orkney, Scotland, and Sarah (née Sanders), both Scottish-English immigrants. They married in 1761 while William was serving as <b>a</b> <b>petty</b> {{officer in the}} British Navy. They had eleven children, eight of whom survived to adulthood. Their first two sons, each named William, died in infancy, as did their fourth child, John. Their surviving children were: William, Jr. (1766), Ann (1770), Peter (1771), Catherine (1774), Ebenezer (1776), John Treat (1778), Sarah (1780), and Washington.|$|E

5|$|Dr. Caligari is not {{the only}} symbol of arrogant {{authority}} in the film. In fact, he is a victim of harsh authority himself during the scene with the dismissive town clerk, who brushes him off and ignores him to focus on his paperwork. Film historian Thomas Elsaesser argues that Dr. Caligari's murderous rampage through Cesare {{can be seen as a}} rebellious, anti-authoritarian streak in response to such experiences as these, even in spite of his own authoritarianism. The Expressionistic set design in this scene further amplifies the power of the official and the weakness of his supplicant; the clerk towers in an excessively high chair over the small and humiliated Dr. Caligari. The scene represents class and status differences, and conveys the psychological experience of being simultaneously outraged and powerless in the face of <b>a</b> <b>petty</b> bureaucracy. Another common visual motif is the use of stairways to illustrate the hierarchy of authority figures, such as the multiple stairs leading up to police headquarters, and three staircases ascending to Dr. Caligari in the asylum.|$|E
5|$|Josh meets Denham at a {{bar where}} she drunkenly {{suggests}} that Shaw has concealed $20 million as a reserve, and that Josh should steal it. Josh, Charlie, Enrique, and evicted Tower tenant Mr. Fitzhugh conspire to find and steal the money from Shaw's assumed safe. They supplement their inexperience by enlisting Josh's childhood friend Slide, <b>a</b> <b>petty</b> criminal, and Odessa, who has locksmith experience that can help open the safe. Charlie is later rehired as the Tower's new manager, and warns Josh to abandon the plan or he will inform the police. Subsequently, Denham informs Josh that Shaw is scheduled to attend court on Thanksgiving during the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade to avoid publicity, and that Shaw will be set free. Josh and his team decide to break into Shaw's apartment during the parade.|$|E
5|$|The conquistadors {{were all}} volunteers, the {{majority}} of whom did not receive a fixed salary but instead {{a portion of the}} spoils of victory, in the form of precious metals, land grants and provision of native labour. Many of the Spanish were already experienced soldiers who had previously campaigned in Europe. The initial incursion into Guatemala was led by Pedro de Alvarado, who earned the military title of Adelantado in 1527; he answered to the Spanish crown via Hernán Cortés in Mexico. Other early conquistadors included Pedro de Alvarado's brothers Gómez de Alvarado, Jorge de Alvarado and Gonzalo de Alvarado y Contreras; and his cousins Gonzalo de Alvarado y Chávez, Hernando de Alvarado and Diego de Alvarado. Pedro de Portocarrero was a nobleman who joined the initial invasion. Bernal Díaz del Castillo was <b>a</b> <b>petty</b> nobleman who accompanied Hernán Cortés when he crossed the northern lowlands, and Pedro de Alvarado on his invasion of the highlands. In addition to Spaniards, the invasion force probably included dozens of armed African slaves and freemen.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} {{supporting}} characters that consistently appear throughout the episodes. Bosco is {{the proprietor of}} the nearby convenience store and supplies the Freelance Police {{with a number of}} items across the game. Driven paranoid by repeated shoplifting, Bosco is obsessed with conspiracies, believing that nearly every US government agency, as well as many criminal outfits, are after him. As such, his store is overwhelmed with security devices and contraptions created by Bosco himself. He regularly attempts to disguise himself as a variety of foreign nationals, but to little effect. Further down the neighborhood is Sybil Pandemik, who owns a small office across from Sam and Max. Sybil is unable to keep a consistent job and regularly changes her career choices. Introduced as a psychotherapist, she is noted to have worked as a tattoo artist, software tester, tabloid journalist and professional witness. In a hole in Sam and Max's own office resides Jimmy Two-Teeth, a rat who works as <b>a</b> <b>petty</b> criminal, confidence trickster and fence. He profusely dislikes Sam and Max, who he sees as always interfering with his work.|$|E

30|$|Geominimal {{surface area}} was {{introduced}} by Petty [11] {{more than three decades}} ago. <b>As</b> <b>Petty</b> stated, this concept serves as a bridge connecting affine differential geometry, relative differential geometry, and Minkowskian geometry. Based on the classical geominimal surface area, Lutwak [19] introduced the notion of p-geominimal surface area and obtained some inequalities for it. Regarding the studies of p-affine surface area and p-geominimal surface area as well as its dual object, also see [13, 20 – 27].|$|R
