The exclusion was a government response to a finding by the Equality Tribunal that a same-sex couple was discriminated against in travel privileges.|$|E
5|$|The Act {{continues}} {{to have a significant}} impact in English law, as its precedents serve to provide <b>a</b> <b>definition</b> of obscenity that is used in other legal contexts. For instance, anything deemed likely to contravene the Act is prohibited from videos awarded an R18 certificate by the British Board of Film Classification. A list of the categories of material most commonly prosecuted under the Act is published by the Crown Prosecution Service.|$|E
5000|$|When {{the breadth}} or vagueness of <b>a</b> lexical <b>definition</b> is unacceptable, <b>a</b> precising <b>definition</b> or <b>a</b> stipulative <b>definition</b> is often used.|$|R
5000|$|This {{is similar}} to <b>a</b> stipulative <b>definition,</b> but differs in that <b>a</b> stipulative <b>definition</b> may {{contradict}} the lexical <b>definition,</b> while <b>a</b> precising <b>definition</b> does not.|$|R

5|$|The use of Newton's Second Law as <b>a</b> <b>definition</b> {{of force}} has been disparaged {{in some of}} the more {{rigorous}} textbooks, because it is essentially a mathematical truism. Notable physicists, philosophers and mathematicians who have sought a more explicit definition of the concept of force include Ernst Mach and Walter Noll.|$|E
5|$|This {{provides}} <b>a</b> <b>definition</b> for {{the moment}} of inertia, which is the rotational equivalent for mass. In more advanced treatments of mechanics, where the rotation over a time interval is described, the moment of inertia must be substituted by the tensor that, when properly analyzed, fully determines the characteristics of rotations including precession and nutation.|$|E

50|$|In epidemiology, <b>a</b> {{clinical}} case <b>definition,</b> <b>a</b> clinical <b>definition,</b> {{or simply}} <b>a</b> case <b>definition</b> lists the clinical criteria by which public health professionals {{determine whether a}} person's illness is included as a case in an outbreak investigation—that is, whether a person is considered directly affected by an outbreak.

5000|$|Divisio and partitio are {{classical}} {{terms for}} <b>definitions.</b> <b>A</b> partitio is simply <b>an</b> intensional <b>definition.</b> <b>A</b> divisio is not <b>an</b> extensional <b>definition,</b> but <b>an</b> exhaustive list of subsets of a set, {{in the sense}} that every member of the [...] "divided" [...] set is a member of one of the subsets. An extreme form of divisio lists all sets whose only member {{is a member of the}} [...] "divided" [...] set. The difference between this and <b>an</b> extensional <b>definition</b> is that extensional definitions list members, and not subsets.|$|R
5|$|At Easter, 1151, Theobald {{took over}} the {{management}} of the chapter's estates, as the new prior, Walter Parvus, was not up to the task. At first, there were no disputes, but soon the monks felt that Theobald was cheating them and imposing too rigorous <b>a</b> <b>definition</b> of poverty, and asked that the stewardship of the estates be restored to Parvus. Theobald refused and the monks attempted to appeal to the papacy. Their envoys, however, were caught by agents of the archbishop and the appeal went nowhere. Theobald then deposed Parvus and appointed a new prior. Theobald's relations with the monks after this point seem to have been without incident.|$|E
5|$|In 1967 {{categories}} for Novelette, Fan Writer, and Fan Artist were added, and a category for Best Novella was added the following year; these new categories {{had the effect}} of providing <b>a</b> <b>definition</b> for what word count qualified a work for what category, which was previously left up to voters. Novelettes had also been awarded prior to the codification of the rules. The fan awards were initially conceived as separate from the Hugo Awards, with the award for Best Fanzine losing its status, but were instead absorbed into the regular Hugo Awards by the convention committee.|$|E

As of 2010, proposals were {{in place for the}} funding of a study of porcine genetics, including variability and relationships among breeds, with the aims of maintaining genetic variability among rare pig breeds and releasing <b>a</b> <b>definition</b> of heritage pork.|$|E

5|$|On 23 October 1940, the German Military Administration adopted anti-Jewish {{legislation}} {{for the first}} time. The new laws, similar to the Nuremberg Laws adopted in Germany in 1935, coincided with the adoption of similar legislation in the Netherlands and in France. The laws of 28 October forbade Jews to practice certain professions (including the civil service) and forced Jews to register with their local municipality. On the same date, the German administration announced <b>a</b> <b>definition</b> of who was regarded as Jewish. Jewish-owned shops or businesses had to be marked by a sign in the window, and Jewish-owned economic assets had to be registered. From June 1940, a list of Jewish businesses had already been drawn up in Liège.|$|E
5|$|Since then Kasahara has {{proposed}} <b>a</b> <b>definition</b> between these two. He agrees with Hata that Chinese soldiers {{actively engaged in}} combat were not massacre victims, but he also includes in his definition of the massacre any Chinese soldiers who were killed on the battlefield but not actively resisting, noting that many confrontations between the Chinese and Japanese Armies were more like one-sided slaughters than battles. For instance, after routing the Chinese in Nanking, Japanese soldiers fired upon and killed {{a large number of}} Chinese soldiers who were attempting to escape the battlefield by swimming across the Yangtze River. Many historians including Kasahara view incidents like these where the Japanese fired upon retreating troops to be atrocities, whereas Hata sees them as extensions of combat and not massacres.|$|E
5|$|The Public Relations Society of America (PRSA) is {{a nonprofit}} trade {{association}} for public relations professionals headquartered in New York City. It was founded in 1947 by combining the American Council on Public Relations and the National Association of Public Relations Councils. That year it had its first annual conference and award ceremony. In the 1950s and 1960s, the society created its code of conduct, accreditation program and a student society called the Public Relations Student Society of America. In the 1970s and 1980s, its membership attained a stronger female demographic and the society had its first female Presidents. PRSA created <b>a</b> <b>definition</b> of public relations in 1982, which was updated with a crowd-sourced version in 2011.|$|E
50|$|A {{theoretical}} (or conceptual) <b>definition</b> is <b>an</b> abstract {{concept that}} defines a term {{in an academic}} discipline.

5000|$|The {{difference}} between <b>a</b> circular <b>definition</b> and <b>a</b> recursive <b>definition</b> is that <b>a</b> recursive <b>definition</b> must always have base cases, cases that satisfy the definition without being {{defined in terms}} of the definition itself, and all other cases comprising the definition must be [...] "smaller" [...] (closer to those base cases that terminate the recursion) in some sense. In contrast, <b>a</b> circular <b>definition</b> may have no base case, and define the value of a function in terms of that value itself, rather than on other values of the function. Such a situation would lead to an infinite regress.|$|R
5|$|The final {{level is}} higher education, or háskóli (lit. “high school”). There are eight such {{institutions}} in the country, {{most of which are}} run by the state. The first institution, the University of Iceland, opened in 1911, and is still the principal higher education institution in the country. In recent years, however, more universities have opened across the country, widening the range of choices available. Legislation concerning higher education institutions was passed in 1997, which includes <b>a</b> <b>definition</b> of the term háskóli (to include universities which do not carry out research). There is also separate legislation in place for each public institution, defining their role in research and general organisation. Private and public universities both receive funding from the state.|$|E
5|$|The {{problem of}} {{developing}} a non-perturbative formulation of string theory {{was one of the}} original motivations for studying the AdS/CFT correspondence. As explained above, the correspondence provides several examples of quantum field theories which are equivalent to string theory on anti-de Sitter space. One can alternatively view this correspondence as providing <b>a</b> <b>definition</b> of string theory in the special case where the gravitational field is asymptotically anti-de Sitter (that is, when the gravitational field resembles that of anti-de Sitter space at spatial infinity). Physically interesting quantities in string theory are defined in terms of quantities in the dual quantum field theory.|$|E
5|$|Under this definition, the Solar System is {{considered}} to have eight planets. Bodies that fulfill the first two conditions but not the third (such as Ceres, Pluto, and Eris) are classified as dwarf planets, provided they are not also natural satellites of other planets. Originally an IAU committee had proposed <b>a</b> <b>definition</b> that would have included a much larger number of planets as it did not include (c) as a criterion. After much discussion, it was decided via a vote that those bodies should instead be classified as dwarf planets.|$|E

This may be in as much detail as the user is prepared to provide and the program is capable of using, but will always specify at least maximum depth and bottom time, and may go into detail regarding recent dive history, multiple levels, gas switches, altitude and personal conservatism factors. Many dive computers have a dive planning function for which the diver selects a maximum depth and the computer displays the maximum bottom time for which no decompression stops are required.|$|E
5|$|Apart from <b>a</b> <b>definition</b> of leisure, {{there are}} other {{questions}} of theoretical concern to the sociologist of leisure. For example, quantifying the results is difficult, as time-budget studies have noted that a given amount of time (for example, an hour) may have different values, depending on when it occurs—within a day, a week, or a year. Finally, as with many other fields of inquiry in the social sciences, {{the study of the}} sociology of leisure is hampered by the lack of reliable data for comparative longitudinal studies, as there was little to no standardized data-gathering on leisure throughout most of human history. The lack of longitudinal studies has been remedied in the last few decades by recurring national surveys such as the General Household Survey in the United Kingdom (ongoing since 1971). In addition to surveys, an increasing number of studies have been focusing on qualitative methods of research (interviews).|$|E
5|$|Communities such as AVEN can be {{beneficial}} to those in search of answers to solve a crisis of identity {{with regard to their}} possible asexuality. Individuals go through a series of emotional processes that end with their identifying with the asexual community. They first realize that their sexual attractions differ from those of most of society. This difference leads to questioning whether the way they feel is acceptable, and possible reasons for why they feel this way. Pathological beliefs tend to follow, in which, in some cases, they may seek medical help because they feel they have a disease. Self-understanding is usually reached when they find <b>a</b> <b>definition</b> that matches their feelings. Asexuality communities provide support and information that allows newly identified asexuals to move from self-clarification to identifying on a communal level, which can be empowering, because they now have something to associate with, which gives normality to this overall socially-isolating situation.|$|E
