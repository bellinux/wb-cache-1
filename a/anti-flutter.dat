25|$|Cantilever three-spar {{structure}} of modified trapezoid planform. Centre section integral with fuselage. Inboard sections, outboard sections and detachable leading and trailing edges. High-lift devices comprise full-span six-segment {{leading edge slats}} (contiguous at engine pylons) at up to 17.5% of chord (drooping to 35°), two-segment fixed-vane double-slotted trailing edge flaps occupying some 75% of the span (deploying to 40°) and five-segment spoilers (outboards used as spoilerons at high speeds, inboards used as lift dumpers on the ground). Two-segment outboard ailerons for low speed roll control. Boundary layer fences over pylons. Engines suspended from the wing on pylons act as <b>anti-flutter</b> weights. Trim range is 16–33% of mean aerodynamic chord.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the other}} {{multi-engined}} jet aircraft in existence, when the Il-22 was being designed, either had the engines in a nacelle (singly or in pairs) directly attached to {{the underside of the}} wing or were buried in the wing itself. Clustering them in a nacelle offered several advantages over individual nacelles as it reduced overall drag and minimized interference drag, but had the major operational disadvantage that an uncontained fire in one engine could disable its neighbor as well and the early jet engines were not reliable, so this was a significant risk. Ilyushin chose to put the TR-1 engines ahead and below the wing leading edge on short horizontal pylons. This gave them the beneficial effect of acting as <b>anti-flutter</b> weights and proved to be more efficient aerodynamically than underwing nacelles. This also facilitated engine changes and maintenance by making them more accessible to the ground crews.|$|E
50|$|The An-22 has {{the general}} {{appearance}} of an enlarged {{version of the}} earlier Antonov An-12 except that it is fitted with a twin tail. This gives the An-22 better engine-out performance, and reduces height restrictions for hangars. Also of note are large <b>anti-flutter</b> masses {{on the top of}} each tail.|$|E
5000|$|A {{control horn}} is {{a section of}} control surface which {{projects}} ahead of the pivot point. It generates a force which tends to increase the surface's deflection thus reducing the control pressure experienced by the pilot. Control horns may also incorporate a counterweight which helps to balance the control and prevent it from [...] "fluttering" [...] in the airstream. Some designs feature separate <b>anti-flutter</b> weights.|$|E
50|$|Caster flutter can be {{controlled}} by adding dampers or increasing the friction of the swivel joints. This {{can be accomplished by}} adding washers to the swivel joint. The friction increases as the weight {{on the front of the}} chair increases. Anytime the caster begins to flutter, it slows the chair and shifts weight to the front wheels. There are several online <b>anti-flutter</b> kits for retrofitting wheelchair casters in this manner. Other methods of reducing caster flutter include increasing swivel lead, using heavier grease, reducing the mass of the wheel, or increasing friction with the ground by changing materials.|$|E

50|$|LS6-c:major redesign, {{the most}} {{important}} novelty being the interchangeable wing tips allowing a span extension to 17.5 metres. This longer span required a larger rudder, increasing the overall length by eighteen centimetres. Concurrently, the cockpit was reinforced for increased crash safety and the allowable weight of non-lifting parts was increased. At {{the same time the}} control and ballast systems were brought up to a new standard shared with the LS7: fully automatic control hook-ups, a mass-balanced flaperon drive system (previous versions having <b>anti-flutter</b> dampers), airbrake locks relocated in the wings, a trigger-activated trim system in place of the trim wheel, a new ballast system that did away with plumbing inside the fuselage and Mylar seals for all control surfaces.|$|E
50|$|The '150' was {{constructed}} throughout with light alloy stressed skin and high-strength steel for highly stressed parts. The fuselage was of oval section {{fore and aft}} with a cylindrical section in the middle. The 35° shoulder-mounted swept wings had 1 o 20' anhedral on the lower surface, outboard of rib 4. The outrigger undercarriages were mounted in large pods at the wingtips which also served as endplates and <b>anti-flutter</b> balance weights. The upper surface of the wings had two wing fences on each side. The 45° swept fin and 40° swept tailplane were constructed {{in a similar fashion}} to the wings, the tailplane attached to the extremity of the fin with eight degrees of dihedral to improve longitudinal stability, and a large carrot-like fairing at the fin/tailplane junction.|$|E
