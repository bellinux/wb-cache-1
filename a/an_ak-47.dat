5|$|On 12 January, one of {{the most}} unusual aerial battles of the Vietnam War took place. Two Soviet-built An-2 Colt biplanes of the North Vietnamese Air Force {{attacked}} Lima Site 85 atop a craggy peak known as Phou Pha Thi. An Air America Bell 205 helicopter, which had taken off to avoid air-dropped 120mm mortar rounds, then began chasing {{one of the}} Colts which had already been struck by ground fire. The aircraft crashed while making evasive maneuvers. The Bell then went after the other Colt, and the helicopter's crew chief fired <b>an</b> <b>AK-47</b> through a sliding window, shooting the biplane down.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time, snipers in the {{hovering}} Razor 2 helicopter {{shot and killed}} Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti {{when he came to}} the door of the guest house firing <b>an</b> <b>AK-47.</b> One SEAL sniper fired two shots at al-Kuwaiti and the other fired two three-round bursts. Two of the snipers' bullets went through al-Kuwaiti and killed his wife who was standing behind him. The Razor 2 team cleared the guest house and then breached their way into the main house with explosives. As the Razor 2 team entered the main house, al-Qaeda courier Arshad Khan pointed his AK-47 gun and was killed with two shots. The SEAL team fired a total of 16 shots, killing Osama bin Laden, Khalid bin Laden, Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti and al-Kuwaiti's wife, Arshad Khan, and wounding Osama bin Laden's wife Amal al-Sadah.|$|E
5|$|Clark was {{assigned}} {{a position in the}} 1st Infantry Division and flew to Vietnam on May 21, 1969, during the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. He worked as a staff officer, collecting data and helping in operations planning, and was awarded the Bronze Star for his work with the staff. Clark was then given command of A Company, 1st Battalion, 16th Infantry of the 1st Infantry Division in January 1970. In February, only one month into his command, he was shot four times by a Viet Cong soldier with <b>an</b> <b>AK-47.</b> The wounded Clark shouted orders to his men, who counterattacked and defeated the Viet Cong force. Clark had injuries to his right shoulder, right hand, right hip, and right leg, and was sent to Valley Forge Army Hospital in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, to recuperate. He was awarded the Silver Star and the Combat Infantryman Badge for his actions during the encounter.|$|E

5|$|He {{believed}} {{that he and his}} men had secured Dai Do and wasn't expecting a sudden massive counterattack by the NVA. Company G took cover in the village cemetery and the fight raged through the night. The next morning, the bodies of more than three hundred enemy soldiers lay near their positions. Vargas's battalion commander arrived on the scene and ordered a renewed assault on the village. He carried to safety a Marine whose arm had been severed, and when the soldier pleaded for his arm, Vargas went back and found it. When the battalion commander, fighting like any other rifleman, was shot in the back three times, Vargas dragged him a hundred yards to an evacuation point, firing at the enemy as he went with <b>an</b> <b>AK-47</b> he had picked up on the battlefield. By {{the end of the third}} day of battle, the North Vietnamese retreated and Vargas finally allowed himself to be treated for a bullet wound in his side and shrapnel from mortar blasts.|$|E
5|$|An {{intelligence}} official told Seymour Hersh in 2015 that no fire-fight took place. In the earlier versions, Al-Kuwaiti {{is said to}} have opened fire on the first team of SEALs with <b>an</b> <b>AK-47</b> from behind the guesthouse door, lightly injuring a SEAL with bullet fragments. A short firefight took place between al-Kuwaiti and the SEALs, in which al-Kuwaiti was killed. His wife Mariam was allegedly shot and wounded in the right shoulder. The courier's male relative Abrar was then said to have been shot and killed by the SEALs' second team {{on the first floor of}} the main house as shots had already been fired and the SEALs thought that he was armed with a loaded AK-47 (this was later confirmed to be true in the official report). A woman near him, later identified as Abrar's wife Bushra, was in this version also shot and killed. Bin Laden's young adult son {{is said to have}} encountered the SEALs on the staircase of the main house, and to have been shot and killed by the second team. An unnamed U.S. senior defense official stated that only one of the five people killed, Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti, was armed. The interior of the house was pitch dark, because CIA operatives had cut the power to the neighborhood. However, the SEALs wore night vision goggles.|$|E

25|$|The {{massacre}} {{remains the}} most deadly criminal shooting rampage in New Zealand's history. It sparked lengthy debate about gun control, as Gray's primary weapon was a semi-automatic rifle, with a similar appearance to and internal mechanism based on the Russian AK-47. The incident directly resulted in an amendment to New Zealand's firearms regulations in 1992, tightening gun control {{and the creation of}} the military-style semi-automatic category of firearms. The government was led to believe that Gray had shot all his victims with <b>an</b> <b>AK-47</b> 7.62×39mm assault rifle. It was subsequently proven that Gray used several firearms, one of which was not <b>an</b> <b>AK-47</b> assault rifle, but a variant of the AK-47 known as the Type 56. Four of the Aramoana victims were proven to have been shot with the Type 56S semiautomatic version marketed as the Norinco 84s sporting rifle. A memorial to the victims was erected in the township.|$|E

There, she became pregnant with her third child by José María Alvarado, a leading Sandinista.|$|E
25|$|Shortly afterwards, {{the coup}} {{plotters}} announced that Allende had committed suicide. An official announcement {{declared that the}} weapon he had used was an automatic rifle. Before his death he had been photographed several times holding <b>an</b> <b>AK-47,</b> a gift from Fidel Castro. He was found dead with this gun, according to contemporaneous statements made by officials in the Pinochet regime.|$|E

In August, breeze blocks were thrown through the windows of houses on the street.|$|E
25|$|The fatal {{shooting}} of Andy Lopez by Sonoma County sheriff's deputy Erick Gelhaus {{took place on}} October 22, 2013, in Santa Rosa, California. 13-year-old Lopez was walking through a vacant lot and carrying an airsoft gun {{that was designed to}} resemble <b>an</b> <b>AK-47</b> assault rifle. Gelhaus opened fire on Lopez, presumably mistaking the airsoft gun for a real firearm. The shooting prompted many protests in Santa Rosa, and throughout California.|$|E
25|$|Investigators said Gelhaus {{feared for}} his safety after Lopez {{turned around and}} {{allegedly}} raised the pellet gun in his direction (a replica of <b>an</b> <b>AK-47</b> that was an air-soft gun that fired plastic pellets). Gelhaus told investigators {{that he could not}} remember if he verbally identified himself as a deputy sheriff, although he was in a deputy sheriff's uniform and marked sheriff's patrol car before firing at Lopez; however, Lopez would not have seen the uniform or patrol car since the officers approached him from behind.|$|E

25|$|In a {{parallel}} development, on 9 July the British government assured Sinn Féin {{that in the}} event of a new IRA ceasefire, representatives of that party would be allowed to meet with government ministers. A week later, Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness called for a renewal of the IRA's 1994 ceasefire. The IRA announced the restoration of the ceasefire on 19 July. The Last Gunman, a photograph taken by Brendan Murphy of an IRA man firing <b>an</b> <b>AK-47</b> on Ormeau Road, became an iconic image of the Troubles.|$|E
25|$|The ongoing {{criminal}} investigation {{led to a}} May 2011 court order that Allende's remains be exhumed and autopsied by an international team of experts. Results of the autopsy were officially released in mid-July 2011. The team of experts concluded that the former president had shot himself with <b>an</b> <b>AK-47</b> assault rifle. In December 2011 the judge {{in charge of the}} investigation affirmed the experts' findings and ruled Allende's death a suicide. On 11 September 2012, the 39th anniversary of Allende's death, a Chilean appeals court unanimously upheld the trial court's ruling, officially closing the case.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of 20 December A Company 1 RAR found a Viet Cong {{surgical}} facility and dispensary, and capturing a quantity of rice, salt and documents. At 09:20 9 Platoon C Company ambushed seven Viet Cong moving south on a track, killing three of them and capturing <b>an</b> <b>AK-47.</b> Only one of the Viet Cong had been armed, while the other two had been carrying packs filled with food and tobacco. Ten minutes later 8 Platoon ambushed two Viet Cong moving along a track away from 9 Platoon, killing one and also capturing <b>an</b> <b>AK-47.</b> Moving on, the Australian platoon was in contact again at 10:50, with the lead sections killing a Viet Cong soldier in a bunker and uncovering a cache. Later A Company uncovered another large, unoccupied bunker complex and quantities of food, medical supplies, explosives and ammunition. As with the previous bunker systems the Australians proceeded to destroy them with explosives, with A Company 1 RAR destroying 93 bunkers over the previous three days. On dusk 1 Platoon was establishing its night ambush location when it had a fleeting contact at 17:55. The same day in the 4 RAR/NZ AO, a composite platoon protecting a survey party contacted a group of five Viet Cong without result, while W Company on the Horseshoe feature had a successful ambush, killing two Viet Cong and wounding a third.|$|E

5000|$|Other {{enduring}} {{customs and}} a strong culture of honor also promote the prevalence and importance of guns.

Similarly, much of mainstream Pakistani culture, including Balochi, Sindhi, Punjabi and Kashmiri cultures, is heavily influenced by guns, as evidenced by common practice of aerial firings on special occasions such as weddings. According to Michael Palin, [...] "For Pakistanis, a gun is a social necessity. Pathans carry guns the way Londoners carry umbrellas." [...] As such, the broader Pakistani social necessity of portable and displayable wealth takes on an intimidating form among male members of provincial society.|$|R
