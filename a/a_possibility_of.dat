The magnitude and ferocity of the German Ardennes Offensive came as a shock, and Smith had to defend Strong against criticism for failing to sound the alarm.

5|$|Although some {{scholars}} mention <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> future divergence of English dialects into mutually unintelligible languages, most think {{a more likely}} outcome is that English will continue {{to function as a}} koineised language in which the standard form unifies speakers from around the world. English is used as the language for wider communication in countries around the world. Thus English has grown in worldwide use much more than any constructed language proposed as an international auxiliary language, including Esperanto.|$|E
5|$|By 1929, {{several of}} the {{children}} were approaching the age to attend university and the family sought to move somewhere of a more congenial educational climate than Spain. That September, they moved to the Belgian village of Steenokkerzeel near Brussels, where they were closer to several members of their family. Zita continued her political lobbying on behalf of the Habsburg family, even sounding out links with Mussolini's Italy. There was even <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> a Habsburg restoration under the Austrian Chancellors Engelbert Dollfuss and Kurt Schuschnigg, with Crown Prince Otto visiting Austria numerous times. These overtures were abruptly ended by the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany in 1938. As exiles, the Habsburg family took the lead in resisting the Nazis in Austria, but this foundered because of opposition between monarchists and socialists.|$|E

5|$|Fredrik Malmberg told Deadline.com in an {{interview}} that the sequel could lead to a cinematic universe of Howard's creations for film and TV.

According to Sandy Schaefer writing for Screenrant.com in August 2016 the script is collaboratively honed by Chris Morgan and Will Beall. In April 2017, producer Chris Morgan stated that Universal had dropped the project, although there was <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> a TV show.

5|$|From {{a purely}} {{literary}} and historical point of view, Either/Or {{can be seen}} as a thinly veiled autobiography of the events between Kierkegaard and his ex-fianceé Regine Olsen. Johannes the Seducer in The Diary of a Seducer treats the object of his affection, Cordelia, much as Kierkegaard treats Regine: befriending her family, asking her to marry him, and breaking off the engagement. Either/Or, then, could be the poetic and literary expression of Kierkegaard's decision between a life of sensual pleasure, as he had experienced in his youth, or <b>a</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> marriage and what social responsibilities marriage might or ought to entail. Ultimately however, Either/Or stands philosophically independent of its relation to Kierkegaard's life.|$|E
5|$|In 1894, the {{peninsula}} was visited by the Russian Minister of Finance, who became {{convinced of the}} region's economic potential. Consequently, in 1896 a telephone and a telegraph line were extended to Kola, improving the communication with the mainland. <b>A</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> building a railway was also considered, but no action was taken at the time. Also in 1896, Alexandrovsk (now Polyarny) was founded, and grew in size so rapidly that it was granted town status in 1899; Kolsky Uyezd was renamed Alexandrovsky on that occasion.|$|E
