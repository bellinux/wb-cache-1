40|$|A photochemical-transport {{two-dimensional}} {{model has}} been used {{to assess the impact of}} a projected fleet of high-speed stratospheric aircraft using different emissions scenarios. It is shown that the presence in the background atmosphere of nitric acid trihydrate aerosols is responsible for a lower stratospheric denoxification in addition to that caused by the sulfate aerosol layer. This has the effect of further decreasing the relative role of the odd nitrogen catalytic cycle for ozone destruction, so that the lower stratosphere is primarily controlled by chlorine species. The effect of aircraft injection of nitric oxides is that of decreasing the level of ClO, so that the lower stratospheric ozone (below about 20 - 25 km altitude) increases. The net effect on global ozone is that of a small increase even at Mach 2. 4, and is enhanced by adopting emission scenarios including <b>altitude</b> <b>restriction</b> at 15 or 18 km. Reductions of the emission index (EI) of nitric oxides below relatively small values (about 15) are shown to reduce the aircraft-induced ozone increase, because of the associated smaller decrease of ClO.

Various future scenarios have been postulated for cruise altitude, from the freedom to fly at optimum <b>altitudes</b> to <b>altitude</b> <b>restrictions</b> imposed for environmental reasons. This report provides background on the fundamental relationships determining aircraft cruise efficiency and examines the sensitivity of efficiency to cruise altitude.

30|$|Nevertheless, current E-CSAR {{wavefront}} reconstruction approaches {{still present}} limitations {{such as the}} execution times {{in the order of}} hours and altitude constraints [8, 11]. These considerations limit the widespread use of E-CSAR techniques in scenarios where the geometry of the scan region or target detection requirements suit the E-CSAR advantages, such as novel near field applications like breast microwave imaging [12], wood inspection [13], and low altitude SAR imaging scenarios [14]. In this paper, a novel E-CSAR wavefront reconstruction algorithm is proposed. Unlike current E-CSAR wavefront reconstruction approaches, the proposed method uses a novel formulation of Green's function of the E-CSAR scan geometry that does not include a Hankel function and imposes no <b>altitude</b> <b>restrictions</b> on the inversion algorithm. The algorithm presented in this paper is an extension of the work presented by the authors in [15] for radar data sets acquired along cylindrical scan geometries. This paper is organized as follows. The E-CSAR signal model is explained in Section 2. In Section 3, the spectrum of Green's function corresponding to the E-CSAR scan geometry is calculated. The proposed reconstruction method is described in Section 4. A theoretical analysis of the point spread function of the E-CSAR imaging geometry, including aspects such as the spatial sampling constraints and resolution, is done in Section 4. In Section 5, the feasibility of the proposed method is assessed using experimental data sets. Lastly, some concluding remarks are mentioned in Section 6.|$|R
40|$|The {{operating}} environment {{of an air}} transport crew is characterized by multiple interrupting tasks, these tasks being composed of a mixture of purely physical control and purely mental planning processes. Measurement of crew workload is thus d difficult undertaking due to the necessity to resolve workload contributions imposed by several sources. These sources include physical efforts, mental efforts, random task interruptions, and emotional disturbances. A multiattribute, subjective opinion rating scale is presented for usa as an effective measure for this air transport cockpit environment. An analysis is performed which indicates that {{a major component of}} workload is induced by the federal air traffic control system. Mechanizations of this loading inClude speed and <b>altitude</b> <b>restrictions</b> imposed by regulation, confinement and restraint imposed by the structure of the National Airspace System, and loads induced by a stochastic interruption process associated with ATC voice communications, In fact, the analysis of a routine transport arrival into Boston's Logan airport indicates that the (primarily system induced) workload levels in the terminal area, may be higher than the (primarily aircraft induced) workload levels on final approach.

40|$|A {{functional}} {{prototype of}} a pilot assistant system for helicopter operations {{has been developed}} {{within the scope of}} an internal DLR project entitled PAVE (pilot assistant in the vicinity of helipads) under the management of the DLR Institute of Flight Guidance. PAVE concentrates especially on safe takeoff and landing phases even in very difficult visual conditions. Besides today’s standard procedures or emergency procedures in case of an engine failure the research is also being done for the definition of noise abatement procedures and – for future ATM applications – time based procedures. The main function is the capability to generate an optimal plan according to different constraints defined by the pilot. He is able to set waypoints, speed and <b>altitude</b> <b>restrictions,</b> and to define time of arrivals at waypoints. A 4 D trajectory planner generates an accurate trajectory which is based on the helicopter performance data, helicopter state, actual weather, and helicopter flight envelope. The trajectory planning module simulates the entire flight along the discretely defined route according to the altitude and speed constraints directly set by just clicking on the moving map. A precisely calculated trajectory is a precondition for time based flight guidance and for conflict detection with terrain, obstacles, other aircraft and helicopter flight envelope limits. The flight intention and the core information for further assistant driven processes like operator communication, Air Traffic Control by data link, and flight progress monitoring are reflected by the trajectory. A navigation display is used for rapid investigation of new solutions by using soft keys and a cursor device. All interface solutions have to be considered {{in the light of the}} challenging environment of the helicopter cockpit which can be noisy, have vibration and have restricted space for additional devices and large size screens. To minimize the necessary inputs, the pilot is able to construct flight plans from the navigation database, reuse pilot defined flight plans stored in the system, or upload flight plans generated on the ground prior to the flight. In the simplest case only the destination point has to be inserted by the pilot to get a flight plan with a flyable trajectory. Electronic charts are also available onboard for flight preparation. Helipad images on the basis of High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) images are stored as well to increase situational awareness. The DLR internal project PAVE was accomplished in two phases (PAVE I and PAVE II). Within the first phase the system was developed and in the context of the second phase the system was integrated in DLR’s research helicopter FHS (EC 135) – the flying helicopter simulator with fly-by-light technology.

40|$|Agriculture is {{a primary}} {{productivity}} sector which is highly dependent on environmental conditions. The climate {{is among the most}} important factors that determine the agricultural potentialities of a region and the suitability of a region for a specific crop, whereas the yield is determined by weather conditions. The agroclimatic conditions of agricultural areas have to be assessed in order to achieve sustainable and efficient use of natural resources in combination with production optimization. Thus, a quantitative understanding of the climate of a region is essential for developing improved farming systems. This study aims to comprise an integrated methodology for identifying agroclimatic zones using remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS). Agroclimatic classifications are divided to general and crop specific. The first objective {{of this study is to}} define a general methodology (not crop specific) for identifying zones adequate for sustainable farming according to water limitations using GIS and remote sensing. As crop growth is affected by water supply, these zones are named Water Limited Growth Environment (WLGE) zones. The second objective is to identify sustainable production zones (general agroclimatic zones) in terms of water sufficiency, fertility (appropriate or not for agricultural use), desertification vulnerability and <b>altitude</b> <b>restrictions.</b> The third objective is to identify crop specific agroclimatic zones for cotton and wheat. The innovation of the proposed methodology consists of the use of remote sensing data, the joint use of “solid” indices describing the moisture, thermal and radiation component, as well as the classification of areas escalating the suitability of agricultural activities. Lastly, the methodology is not crop specific and has the advantage of providing total spatial coverage of the area under investigation. The study area is the water district of Thessaly, the largest lowland formation of Greece and the country’s largest agricultural centre, located in Central Greece. The data base consists of NOAA/AVHRR satellite data and conventional data for 20 hydrological years, from October 1981 to September 2001. In specific: • Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), CH 1 and CH 2 Reflectance, CH 4 and CH 5 Brightness Temperature (BT) ten-day composite images (8 x 8 km 2 spatial resolution). Extended Abstract 237 • Monthly rainfall maps with grid cell size 50 x 50 km 2, provided by ISPRA. • Mean monthly air temperature measurements from Larissa meteorological station, provided by the National Meteorological Service (NMS). • Soil map of the study area. Temperature and rainfall, in terms of quantity and spatiotemporal variability, are variables which determine the type of crops suitable to a given location. Even thought crop production depends on every environmental condition, almost all agroclimatic classifications take into account these variables. Except from temperature and rainfall, another important variable is solar radiation. Many methodologies have been developed in many countries analyzing the impact of solar radiation and day duration to crop production. ...|$|R

Supported by funds from the Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (BMWi) and conducted by the DLR Space Administration of the German Aerospace Center DLR, the STERN programme provides aerospace engineering faculties at universities with opportunities to introduce students realistically to subjects related to space transport. During the project duration of three years the soon-to-be engineers will develop their own rockets. There are no limits regarding peak altitude or the propulsion system used (solid fuel, liquid fuel, steam or hybrid). The rockets should have a small telemetry system to transmit key trajectory and housekeeping data back to Earth during flight and provide information to the students including the rocket altitude. In order to teach students engineering and science and to put their technical knowledge to the test as early as possible in their studies, there are no <b>altitude</b> <b>restrictions</b> except the normal range restrictions. The students will be integrated into courses which already deal with various aspects of rocket technology. In addition to the design of the engine, project activities will focus primarily on the rocket system as a whole, which, because of its complexity, demands interdisciplinary thinking and teamwork. As in a large aerospace technology project, or {{the development of a new}} launch system, future graduates will have to meet milestones that specify both timing and technical progress. It is also necessary that they have to attend various reviews to present and explain their design to an expert audience which carefully reviews their proposals and work. The students will be invited to test the engines they have built at the DLR test centre in Lampoldshausen, Germany. At the end of the project, the result should be a flight capable rocket. Some of the rockets will be launched from the Esrange Space Center at Kiruna, in Sweden, where the European altitude record of 12. 6 kilometres for an amateur rocket was set. To break this record and fly even higher could be a long-term objective of the DLR programme during its planned three-year duration – offering universities a long-term prospect for training a new generation of researchers, particularly in the area of astronautics. DLR MORABA (Mobile Rocket Base), the DLR Space Propulsion Institute, and the DLR Space Administration are a major part of the Review-Board until flight. With a large number of sounding rocket launches, DLR's MORABA has acquired total system competence when it comes to assessing the structural integrity, flight behaviour, or flight performance of a rocket and makes access to Esrange possible. The DLR Space Propulsion Institute at Lampoldshausen has decades of experience in research and testing of rocket engines, especially those belonging to the European Ariane programme that was launched in the 1970 s. The centre conducts both applied and fundamental research in the field of rocket propulsion systems. This paper will give an overview on the activities of DLR in supporting the student teams to succeed in their aim of a successful flight of their own rocket.

This report updated a separate report from 2010, in which Lockheed Martin spokesman John Kent said that adding fire-suppression systems would offer [...] "very small" [...] improvement to survivability.

The acceleration performance of all three variants was also downgraded, with the F-35C taking 43 seconds longer than an F-16 to accelerate from Mach 0.8 to Mach 1.2; this was judged by several fighter pilots to be a lower performance level than expected from a fourth generation fighter. On 30 August 2013, it was reported that the F-35B and F-35C models take several complex maneuvers in order to [...] "accelerate" [...] to their top speed of Mach 1.6, which consumed almost all of the onboard fuel.

In 2012, Lockheed Martin program manager Tom Burbage said that while the relatively large cross-sectional area of the fighter that was required by the internal weapons bays gave it a disadvantage against fourth generation fighters that were operating in a clean configuration, the F-35 armed with weapons carried internally had the advantage over fighters carrying their weapons outside the aircraft.|$|R
40|$|AbstractTo {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} low atmospheric pressure on leaf photosynthesis, we compared the photosynthesis of identical leaves of Fagus crenata at lowland (0 m a. s. l.) and at highland (2360 m a. s. l.). At the high altitude, the atmospheric pressure and partial pressure of CO 2 at intercellular air spaces in the leaf (Ci 360) decreased to 77 % and 78 % of those at the low altitude, respectively. On the other hand, the efficiency of photosynthetic CO 2 -utilization was apparently higher at the high altitude because of a mitigation of the O 2 -inhibition of ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) under low ambient partial pressure of O 2. This stimulation of photosynthesis partly compensated a photosynthetic depression due to the low Ci 360, and the net assimilation rate (An 360) at the high altitude retained 94 % of the value at the low altitude.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} low atmospheric pressure on leaf photosynthesis, we compared the photosynthesis of identical leaves of Fagus crenata at lowland (0 m a. s. l.) and at highland (2360 m a. s. l.). At the high altitude, the atmospheric pressure and partial pressure of CO_ 2 at intercellular air spaces in the leaf (C_) decreased to 77 % and 78 % of those at the low altitude, respectively. On the other hand, the efficiency of photosynthetic CO_ 2 -utilization was apparently higher at the high altitude because of a mitigation of the O_ 2 -inhibition of ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) under low ambient partial pressure of O_ 2. This stimulation of photosynthesis partly compensated a photosynthetic depression due to the low C_, and the net assimilation rate (A_) at the high altitude retained 94 % of the value at the low altitude. A theoretical model indicated that the stimulation of photosynthesis at high altitudes depend on internal conductance (g_i) and/or on Rubisco content. The model demonstrated that low atmospheric pressure at high <b>altitudes</b> caused severe <b>restrictions</b> of photosynthesis when leaves had a small g_i and/or {{a large amount of}} Rubisco, whichever are repeatedly reported in alpine plants. ブナの葉の光合成を標高 0 ｍと 2360 ｍの 2 地点で測定比較した結果、CO 2 分圧の低下は光合成の低下をもたらすが、O 2 分圧の低下は酸素によるRubisco活性の抑制を緩和する方向に働くことを示しています...|$|R
