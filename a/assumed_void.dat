40|$|The {{problem of}} mapping {{underground}} cavities from surface seismic measurements is investigated {{within the framework}} of a regularized boundary integral equation (BIE) method. With the ground modeled as a uniform elastic half-space, the inverse analysis of elastic waves scattered by a three-dimensional void is formulated as a task of minimizing the misfit between experimental observations and theoretical predictions for an <b>assumed</b> <b>void</b> geometry. For an accurate treatment of the gradient search technique employed to solve the inverse problem, sensitivities of the predictive BIE model with respect to cavity parameters are evaluated semi-analytically using an adjoint problem approach and a continuum kinematics description. Several key features of the formulation, including the rigorous treatment of the radiation condition for semi-infinite solids, modeling of an illuminating seismic wave field, and treatment of the prior information, are highlighted. A set of numerical examples with spherical and ellipsoidal cavity geometries is included to illustrate the performance of the method. It is shown that the featured adjoint problem approach reduces the computational requirements by an order of magnitude relative to conventional finite difference estimates, thus rendering the 3 D elastic-wave imaging of solids tractable for engineering applications.

40|$|Evolutionary {{algorithms}} (EAs) are randomized search heuristics that {{solve problems}} successfully in many cases. Their behavior {{is often described}} in terms of strategies to find a high location on Earth’s surface. Unfortunately, many digital elevation models describing it contain void elements. These are elements not assigned an elevation. Therefore, we design and analyze simple EAs with different strategies to handle such partially defined functions. They are experimentally investigated on a dataset describing the elevation of Earth’s surface. The largest value found by an EA within a certain runtime is measured, and the median over a few runs is computed and compared for the different EAs. For the dataset, the distribution of void elements seems to be neither random nor adversarial. They are so-called semirandomly distributed. To deepen our understanding on the behavior of the different EAs, they are theoretically considered on well-known pseudo-Boolean functions transferred to partially defined ones. These modifications are also performed in a semirandom way. The typical runtime until an optimum is found by an EA is analyzed, namely bounded from above and below, and compared for the different EAs. We figure out that for the random model it is a good strategy to <b>assume</b> that a <b>void</b> element has a worse function value than all previous elements.

In hierarchical evolution, voids exhibit two different behaviors related with their sur-roundings and environments, they can merge or collapse.

Following this, to construct a realistic void merging model that consists of both collapse and merging processes, the two-barrier excursion set formalism of the void population is used. <b>Assuming</b> spherical <b>voids</b> in the Einstein de Sitter Universe, the void merging algorithm which allows us to consider the two main processes of void hierarchy in one formalism is constructed.

Materials and Methods We interrogated a large integrated database containing pooled patient data from 4 randomized, placebo-controlled phase III OAB solifenacin studies. A statistical correction was applied to MF to remove the influence of fluid intake. Results Pooled analysis using patient-level data from 3011 patients and accounting for the studies within the models showed that all patients voided progressively less total urine per 24 hours during treatment than at baseline. However, reduction in total urine volume voided per 24 hours was larger in patients receiving placebo vs those on solifenacin; with a substantial decrease in 24 -hour urine output {{in the placebo group}} from baseline to week 4, which was not the case in active groups. After correcting MF for volume voided for each patient using the statistical correction and averaging the corrected MF per treatment arm, the placebo effect almost disappeared. Patients on solifenacin voided less often, with a statistically significant increase in volume voided each time they voided, vs placebo. Conclusion <b>Assuming</b> volume <b>voided</b> is a good surrogate measure for fluid intake, this analysis shows that fluid restriction almost completely explains the reduction in MF in the placebo group.

Although there have been considerable developments in analyzing delamination growth and effects of voids on certain mechanical properties of composites, none of the present literatures investigates the effects of voids on delamination growth under compression. In this research, a parametric study is performed to investigate the effects of voids on delamination growth in composite laminates under compression. In composite structures, delamination would be created by eccentricities in structural load path, structural discontinuities, and during manufacturing and maintenance processes. Also, the service damage such as the impact of foreign objects may also result in delamination. In the Finite Element model developed, a through-width surface delamination is <b>assumed,</b> and <b>void</b> is placed in critical locations ahead of crack tip.

During the loading, Mode II SERR increases monotonically while Mode I SERR increases first and then decreases as the delamination front starts to close. Meanwhile, Mode II SERR is found to be much larger than the Mode I component. The presence of void does not significantly alter the transverse displacement of the delaminated part.

The study includes a Spectral Energy Distribution of a zero-metallicity stellar population, and two Initial Mass Functions (Salpeter/Larson). The expansion of the I-front is followed as it breaks out from the galaxy and it is channeled by the filaments into the <b>voids,</b> <b>assuming,</b> in a 2 D representation, a characteristic butterfly shape. The ionization evolution is very well tracked by our scheme, as realized by the correct treatment of the channeling and shadowing effects due to overdensities. We confirm previous claims that both {{the shape of the}} IMF and the ionizing power metallicity dependence are important to correctly determine the reionization of the universe.

30|$|In {{the present}} study, by <b>assuming</b> a urinary <b>voiding</b> {{interval}} of 1  h, we calculated an ED of 18.8  μSv/MBq in men, which would correspond to 2.8  mSv after a tracer injection of 150  MBq 68 Ga-NODAGA-MJ 9. This estimated ED {{falls within the}} range 16.7 – 25.7  μSv/MBq reported for other 68 Ga-labelled peptides [43 – 47]. However, differently from previous studies, our absorbed dose calculations were based on OLINDA/EXM 2.0. If the absorbed dose estimation is made with OLINDA/EXM 1.1, the ED in male increases up to 27.9  μSv/MBq for 68 Ga-NODAGA-MJ 9. The lower ED estimated with OLINDA/EXM 2.0 can be explained, in first instance, by a lower tissue wT attributed to the most irradiated organ, that is the pancreas in our case (wT pancreas = 0.025 vs. 0.0092 in OLINDA/EXM 1.1 and OLINDA/EXM 2.0, respectively) [24]. Secondarily, the phantoms implemented in OLINDA/EXM 1.1 and OLINDA/EXM 2.0 consider two different organ masses for the pancreas (94.3  g vs. 140  g in OLINDA/EXM 1.1 and OLINDA/EXM 2.0 respectively), which has an additional impact on the calculation of the ED. Consequently, in our specific case of 68 Ga-NODAGA-MJ 9, the equivalent dose to the pancreas accounts for 35 % of the ED in OLINDA/EXM 1.1, whereas it accounts for only 13 % of the ED in OLINDA/EXM 2.0.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{comparison}} of the properties of a giant radio galaxy and the ambient intergalactic medium, whose properties are inferred from the large-scale distribution in galaxies. The double lobes of the radio galaxy MSH 05 − 22 are giant— 1. 8 Mpc projected linear size—and interacting with the environment outside the interstellar medium and coronal halo associated with the host galaxy. The radio lobes appear to be relicts and the double structure is asymmetric. We have examined the large-scale structure in the galaxy distribution surrounding the radio source. The host galaxy of MSH 05 − 22 is associated with a small group that lies close to the boundary of sheet-like and filamentary density enhancements, and adjacent to a <b>void.</b> <b>Assuming</b> that the galaxies trace gas, the asymmetries in the radio morphology in this case study appear related to the anisotropy in the medium. However, the observed overdensities and structure formation models for the heating of the intergalactic medium (IGM) suggest a density-temperature product for the IGM environment that is an order of magnitude below that expected from the properties of the radio source. The discordance suggests that even sources like MSH 05 − 22, which are observed in the relatively low-density IGM environment associated with the filamentary large-scale structure and have multiple signatures of being relicts...|$|R
40|$|When a drug {{is given}} orally, {{one of the}} major factors that impacts safety and {{efficacy}} is dissolution rate. Two important in vivo parameters that impact dissolution that are not well accounted for in current dissolution methods are the physiological buffer species bicarbonate and hydrodynamics. This work explores important aspects of each of these. Dissolution of pure drug using rotating disk dissolution methodology was used to evaluate the accuracy of several physically realistic simultaneous diffusion and chemical reaction schemes for CO 2 -bicarbonate buffer. Experimental results for ibuprofen, ketoprofen, indomethacin, 2 -napthoic acid, benzoic acid, and haloperidol dissolution confirmed that the CO 2 hydration reaction is sufficiently slow that it plays an insignificant role in the hydrodynamic boundary layer. Therefore carbonic acid undergoes an irreversible reaction to form CO 2 and H 2 O. Dissolution experiments were also performed in the USP 2 (paddle) apparatus using suspended ibuprofen particles and tablets to demonstrate that the CO 2 -bicarbonate transport analysis can be successfully applied to pharmaceutical dosage forms. This transport analysis allows for predictions of phosphate buffers that more closely simulate dissolution in vivo. In the case of weak acid and weak base BCS class 2 drugs phosphate buffer concentrations are typically 1 - 15 mM at pH 6. 5. The role of hydrodynamics on particle dissolution was studied using the USP 4 (flow through) apparatus because it provides relatively well-defined fluid velocity profiles that may simulate in vivo conditions. Experimental results showed that increasing the fluid velocity resulted in increased particle dissolution rates. The impact of fluid velocity can only be accurately predicted with knowledge of particle Reynolds number and the void space of the solid particles suspended in solution. The suspensions studied were consistent with predictions <b>assuming</b> a <b>void</b> fraction of 0. 25. The impact of hydrodynamics was also studied for erodible HPMC tablets using the USP 4 apparatus. In vitro erosion studies using bulk fluid velocities that simulate average intestinal flow rates (~ 0. 1 cm/sec) resulted in erosion rates that were 2 - 4. 5 times slower than erosion rates observed for the same formulations in humans. It was concluded that the USP 4 apparatus may not provide hydrodynamics that accurately simulate in vivo tablet erosion...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA new {{constitutive}} model for elasto-plastic (rate-independent) porous materials subjected to general three-dimensional ﬁnite deformations is presented. The new model results from simple modiﬁcations {{of an earlier}} model of Kailasam and Ponte Castañeda (1997, 1998) [40, 41] so that it reproduces the exact spherical and cylindrical shell solution (composite sphere and composite cylinder assemblage) under purely hydrostatic loadings, while predicting (by calibration) accurately the void shape evolution according to the recent ''second-order'' model of Danas and Ponte Castañeda [17]. Furthermore, the present model {{is based on a}} rigorous homogenization method which is capable of predicting both the constitutive behavior and the microstructure evolution of porous materials. The microstructure is described by voids of arbitrary ellipsoidal shapes and orientations and as a result the material exhibits deformation-induced (or morphological) anisotropy at ﬁnite deformations. This is in contrast with the well-known Gurson [32] model which <b>assumes</b> that the <b>voids</b> remain spherical during the deformation process and thus the material remains always isotropic. The present model is implemented numerically in a ﬁnite element program where a three-dimensional thin-sheet (butterﬂy) specimen is subjected to a combination of shear and traction loading conditions in order to examine the effect of stress triaxiality and shearing upon material failure. The ability of the present model {{to take into account the}} nontrivial evolution of the microstructure and especially void shape effects leads to the prediction of material failure even at low stress triaxialities and small porosities without the use of additional phenomenological damage criteria. At high stress triaxialities, the present model gives similar predictions as the Gurson model...|$|R
