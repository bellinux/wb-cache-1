5|$|By {{contrast}} Yoshiaki Itakura {{adopted an}} even stricter standard than Hata, advocating that only Chinese soldiers captured in uniform and then killed be included as massacre victims. He argued that Chinese {{soldiers who had}} thrown away their uniforms were legally executed because {{the laws of war}} at the time did not apply to them, though this line of reasoning is hotly disputed by other historians. Most Japanese ultranationalists who deny the Nanking Massacre <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Japanese Army killed a large number of Chinese POWs, though they consider these to be legal executions, an argument denounced by mainstream historians.|$|E
5|$|I {{loved the}} Spitfire {{in all of}} her many versions. But I have to <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> later marks, {{although}} they were faster than the earlier ones, were also much heavier and so did not handle so well. You did not have such positive control over them. One test of manoeuvrability was to throw her into a flick-roll and see how many times she rolled. With the Mark II or the Mark V one got two-and-a-half flick-rolls but the Mark IX was heavier and you got only one-and-a-half. With the later and still heavier versions, one got even less. The essence of aircraft design is compromise, and an improvement {{at one end of}} the performance envelope is rarely achieved without a deterioration somewhere else.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to refloat her, Captain Pearce ordered Gothenburg to be {{lightened}} forward. Water casks used as ballast and passengers were positioned aft in an endeavour to refloat her as the tide rose, but without success. Finally, a fatal {{attempt was made to}} refloat her, by reversing the engine hard. The vessel came half off the reef, but holed herself badly and then slewed broadside to the waves, in a much worse position. However, with the tide rising and some cargo now being dumped overboard, all aboard still expected Gothenburg to float free. With strong winds changing direction and seas increasing, the boiler fires were extinguished by water rising through the damaged stern. Around midnight, the chief engineer came on deck to report that the engine room was flooded and the engine was of no further use. With heavy seas now rushing down hatchways and into the cabins, Gothenburg was doomed and Captain Pearce was forced to <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> situation had become desperate.|$|E

5|$|Coach Leeman Bennett {{treated the}} season as a {{building}} season, but was disappointed with the team's mental errors and lack of progress. Later in the season, he would begin to privately <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Buccaneers' talent was much worse than he had realized. Steve DeBerg won the starting quarterback job after outplaying Steve Young in the preseason, but was benched in favor of Young after struggling {{in the first two}} games. Kevin House and Jimmie Giles were released after an October loss to the New Orleans Saints, along with ex-Dallas Cowboys fullback Ron Springs. Bennett showed up at a press conference held after the season by owner Hugh Culverhouse, unaware {{that the purpose of the}} press conference was to announce Bennett's firing. Giles, then with the Detroit Lions, criticized the move, saying that no coach could compensate for the Buccaneers' lack of talent. He also claimed that administrator Phil Krueger destroyed team chemistry by demeaning players during contract negotiations, pointing to guard Sean Farrell's disgruntlement as an example.|$|E
5|$|The Anglo-French {{adaption}} of The Bridge {{was announced}} as a joint project between Sky and Canal+ in January 2013. Ben Richards, the head writer of The Tunnel, worked with Hans Rosenfeldt, {{the creator of}} the original series. Due to the setting, the dialogue of the series is bilingual, a first for British and French television. With a budget of £15 million, filming took place between February and August 2013, and was shot on location in Kent, England and northern France. It was produced with both British and French crew members. The premieres on both Sky Atlantic and Canal+ received strong ratings for the respective channels, with an initial consolidated figure of almost 900,000 in the UK, and 1.3 million in France. Critical reception of the series has been generally positive, with Dillane and Poésy's acting being praised, as well as the plot's grittiness. The comparisons with The Bridge were also viewed favourably by some reviewers, though others criticised The Tunnel for being identical. The producers <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> first episode is a copy of the original.|$|E

25|$|In 1937, MacBride {{was called}} to the bar. He then {{resigned}} from the IRA when the Constitution of Ireland was enacted later that year. As a barrister, MacBride frequently defended IRA political prisoners, but was unsuccessful in stopping the execution in 1944 of Charlie Kerins, convicted of killing Garda Detective Denis O'Brien in 1942. In 1946, during the inquest into the death of Seán McCaughey, MacBride embarrassed the authorities by forcing them to <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> conditions in Portlaoise Prison were inhumane.|$|E

25|$|In June 2006, US and UK {{competition}} authorities investigated alleged {{price fixing}} between Virgin Atlantic and British Airways over passenger fuel surcharges. In August 2007, BA was fined £271million by the UK Office of Fair Trading (OFT) and the USDepartment of Justice. However, the Chief Executive of Virgin Atlantic, Steve Ridgway, {{was forced to}} <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> company had been {{a party to the}} agreement, had been aware of the price fixing and had taken no steps whatsoever to stop the price fixing. The company escaped a similar fine to that levied on British Airways only by virtue of the immunity it had earlier negotiated with the regulators.|$|E
25|$|The plot of Thunderstorm {{centers on}} one family's {{psychological}} and physical destruction {{as a result of}} incest, as perpetrated at the hands of its morally depraved and corrupt patriarch, Zhou Puyuan. Although it is undisputed that the prodigious reputation achieved by Thunderstorm was {{due in large part to}} its scandalous public airing of the topic of incest, and many people have pointed out technical imperfections in its structure, Thunderstorm is nevertheless considered to be a milestone in China's modern theatrical ascendancy. Even those who have questioned the literary prowess of Cao Yu, for instance, the noted critic C. T. Hsia, <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> popularization and consolidation of China's theatrical genre is fundamentally owed to the first works of Cao Yu.|$|E
25|$|By September 2009, {{speculation}} {{had begun}} to build about MLB forcing the Rangers to shut down front rotation man Kevin Millwood before he surpassed his inning threshold that would vest his 2010 option for $12 million. Hicks did <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Rangers had received some advances from MLB, but that the money borrowed would be repaid out of future earnings due the team {{at the end of}} the year. In October 2009, MLB executive vice president Rob Manfred sent a letter to then potential buyers Chuck Greenberg and Nolan Ryan informing them the Rangers had been in violation of the collective-bargaining agreement and owed around $40 million. Another major problem for the Rangers following the 2009 season was the refund for prepaid post season tickets. Some fans did not receive refunds from the Rangers until late December, even after the team failed to make the post season.|$|E

25|$|On 25 September 2012, ex-rector of the Azerbaijan International University (which was {{stripped}} off its license and closed down in 2010) Elshad Abdullayev, who currently resides in France, posted a video on YouTube, dated 2005, {{in which a}} hidden camera captured a conversation involving himself, Gular Ahmadova and her friend Sevinj Babayeva in {{what appears to be}} an office room. During the sixteen-and-a-half-minute long footage, the three are seen and heard negotiating a price that Abdullayev is expected to pay in return to being given a seat in the National Assembly of Azerbaijan as an MP. In the video, Abdullayev offers to pay 500,000 USD, while Ahmadova insists on 1,000,000. In the video, Abdullayev repeatedly tries to get Ahmadova to <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> money will go directly to the Head of the Presidential Administration of Azerbaijan Republic Ramiz Mehdiyev, though she never openly confirms that.|$|E
25|$|Law {{exaggerated the}} wealth of Louisiana with an {{effective}} marketing scheme, which led to wild speculation on the shares of the company in 1719. The scheme promised success for the Mississippi Company by combining investor fervor and {{the wealth of}} its Louisiana prospects into a sustainable, joint-stock, trading company. The popularity of company shares were such that they sparked {{a need for more}} paper bank notes, and when shares generated profits the investors were paid out in paper bank notes. In 1720, the bank and company were merged and Law was appointed by Philippe II, Duke of Orleans, then Regent for Louis XV, to be Comptroller General of Finances to attract capital. Law's pioneering note-issuing bank thrived until the French government was forced to <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> number of paper notes being issued by the Banque Royale exceeded the value of the amount of metal coinage it held.|$|E
25|$|Initially it {{was thought}} by Siemens and VAG that development, testing and {{certification}} of the ATC components could be conducted during those 3 years in parallel {{to the construction of}} the line, at first in simulations and, after the first DT3 units had been delivered, on a test track at the Langwasser Depot, and that the new line could enter service immediately after the tunnels and stations were built. However, in 2005 news was published that ATC development was not progressing as planned and that the opening would have to be postponed by one year to late 2006 or early 2007. In fall 2006 the responsible parties had to <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ATC system would still not be ready by the already postponed date at the end of 2006 and that the opening of the line would have to be postponed again. At that point, Siemens appointed a new project manager. The new U3 line finally opened on June 14, 2008.|$|E

25|$|If all looting is wrong, as {{in theory}} it is, {{then they have}} been to blame: {{but there are times}} when the laws of nature assert {{themselves}} over the laws of civilization, and this was a case in point. You must remember that these men had just endured a long siege, that they had been bereft of everything they possessed and that they had hundreds of men, similarly destitute, who were dependent upon them. What was their position? Had they come to me and said, 'Give us money and food,' I could only have replied in the negative, or, at all events, to the effect that I could not feed their converts, and so they took the law into their own hands. It has been a case of poetical or primitive justice. But, granted that this sort of justice was admissible, I do not <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> missionaries abused it. I have not heard of a single instance of a missionary looting for any purpose other than that of feeding themselves and their converts who were dependent on them.|$|E
25|$|Political {{corruption}} {{from all}} parties {{is not uncommon}} in the South Florida metropolitan area, which consistently has one the highest crime rates in the nation, coming in first place among the ten largest metropolitan areas for both violent and property crimes in 2011. This leads to a distrust in government; South Florida, particularly Miami, which would likely wax more Democratically, often has lowest voter turnout in the state. Specifically, the public felt deceived when the majority of promises were broken related to the county-wide half penny sales surtax, {{which was supposed to}} fund many rapid transit expansions, that was passed in 2002 with about two-thirds of the vote. While many beneficial investments were made {{as a result of the}} tax, transit officials candidly <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> core promise of new Metrorail lines was always an overstatement. It should be noted, however, that the half-penny itself was a trade off from the full penny surtax that would have generated billions of dollars over several decades, which was championed by then-Miami-Dade County Mayor Alex Penelas, but fought successfully by local businessman and community activist Norman Braman.|$|E
25|$|Brady's first {{witnesses}} {{during the}} trial included Betty Campbell, a model, who attended the September 5 party and testified that she saw Arbuckle {{with a smile on}} his face hours after the alleged rape occurred; Grace Hultson, a local hospital nurse who testified it was very likely that Arbuckle raped Rappe and bruised her body in the process; and Dr. Edward Heinrich, a local criminologist who claimed he found Arbuckle's fingerprints smeared with Rappe's blood on room 1219's bathroom door. Dr. Arthur Beardslee, the hotel doctor who had examined Rappe, testified that an external force seemed to have damaged the bladder. During cross-examination, Betty Campbell, however, revealed that Brady threatened to charge her with perjury if she did not testify against Arbuckle. Dr. Heinrich's claim to have found fingerprints was cast into doubt after McNab produced the St. Francis hotel maid, who testified that she had cleaned the room before the investigation even took place and did not find any blood on the bathroom door. Dr. Beardslee admitted that Rappe had never mentioned being assaulted while he was treating her. McNab was furthermore able to get Nurse Hultson to <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> rupture of Rappe's bladder could very well have been a result of cancer, and that the bruises on her body could also have been a result of the heavy jewelry she was wearing that evening. During the defense stage of the trial, McNab called various pathology experts who testified that although Rappe's bladder had ruptured, there was evidence of chronic inflammation and no evidence of any pathological changes preceding the rupture; in other words, there was no external cause for the rupture.|$|E
