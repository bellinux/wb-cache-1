5|$|A {{circular}} keep was constructed, {{probably in}} the late-12th century, on the castle's motte, along with two stone gatehouses <b>and</b> <b>towers</b> along the walls. The wooden buildings in the bailey were rebuilt in stone and the construction work spread up onto the inside edges of the ramparts. Some of these houses may have belonged {{to the members of}} the castle-guard, feudal knights who were granted local estates in return for helping to defend the castle.|$|E
5|$|Appeals {{from the}} local people led to the Crown agreeing in July 1402 to build an earthen rampart <b>and</b> <b>towers</b> to protect the settlement. The site of these early defences is not known but may have been near where St Catherine's Church now stands. A ditch of unknown date in that {{vicinity}} may represent a fragment of the medieval defences.|$|E

5|$|Artificial ruins, {{built to}} {{resemble}} remnants of historic edifices, {{were also a}} hallmark of the period. They were usually built as centre pieces in aristocratic planned landscapes. Follies were similar, although they differed from artificial ruins in that they were not part of a planned landscape, but rather seemed to have no reason for being built. Both drew on elements of castle architecture such as castellation <b>and</b> <b>towers,</b> but served no military purpose and were solely for display.|$|E
5|$|Henry's son, George Herbert, {{maintained}} the lease and his wife, Henrietta, constructed gravel-laid public {{walks around the}} castle, dug into the surrounding cliffs, and planted trees around the grounds to improve the castle's appearance. The castle walls <b>and</b> <b>towers</b> were given superficial repairs and tidied up, usually when parts threatened to collapse, and {{the interior of the}} inner bailey levelled, costing considerable sums of money. The landscape also required expensive maintenance and repairs.|$|E
5|$|In {{the center}} of the fort there is a {{courtyard}} planted with trees. Around it on various levels are rooms, enclosures <b>and</b> <b>towers</b> accessible through a complex set of stairways that may have once had a defensive purpose. Massive doors with protruding iron spikes protect sections of the fort.|$|E

5|$|Military {{units are}} {{produced}} at specific buildings {{relevant to their}} area. All sea units are created at the docks. Walls <b>and</b> <b>towers</b> are defensive fortifications (Age of Empires {{was one of the}} first real-time strategy games to include walls strong enough to form a feasible means of defense). Farms are used to produce food. Granaries, storage pits, and the Town Center are used to store resources deposited by the villagers.|$|E
5|$|The {{courtyard}} {{house is}} {{the most common type of}} home portrayed in Han artwork. Ceramic architectural models of buildings, like houses <b>and</b> <b>towers,</b> were found in Han tombs, perhaps to provide lodging for the dead in the afterlife. These provide valuable clues about lost wooden architecture. The artistic designs found on ceramic roof tiles of tower models are in some cases exact matches to Han roof tiles found at archaeological sites.|$|E
5|$|The west front {{rises in}} three {{distinct}} stages, each clearly {{defined by a}} horizontal course.

5|$|A {{subsequent}} rebuilding saw {{the timber}} palisades {{of the inner}} bailey replaced by stone walls <b>and</b> <b>towers.</b> Exactly when this happened is unclear, but {{it may have been}} under Peter of Savoy, the Earl of Richmond, who was granted the castle by Henry III in 1246. There is no record of the rebuilding but in 1254 Peter ended the feudal requirement to maintain the palisades and replaced it with cash payments. This probably reflected the replacement of the palisades with the stone walls <b>and</b> <b>towers</b> visible today. The castle faced a lengthy siege only a decade later during the Second Barons' War from the rebel baron Simon de Montfort, following Henry's defeat in the Battle of Lewes. Defeated members of the royalist army fled to Pevensey, pursued by de Montford's forces, but the garrison refused an invitation to surrender and endured over a year of besiegement. Their adversaries were unable to stop supplies reaching the castle despite digging a ditch to cut it off from the mainland; its garrison raided the surrounding countryside and sought to obtain fresh supplies of men and weapons by sea in December 1264. The costly and ineffective siege was eventually lifted in July 1265. It caused significant damage to the castle, with the Roman wall toppled on the south side. The parish churches at Pevensey and Westham also suffered damage, which the attackers may have caused in using them as siege castles (temporary fortresses and artillery platforms).|$|E
5|$|Although fortifications {{could still}} be {{valuable}} in times of war, they had played only a limited role during the Wars of the Roses and, when Henry VII invaded and seized the throne in 1485, he had not needed to besiege any castles or towns during the campaign. Henry rapidly consolidated his rule at home and had few reasons to fear an external invasion from the continent; he invested little in coastal defences {{over the course of}} his reign. Modest fortifications existed along the coasts, based around simple blockhouses <b>and</b> <b>towers,</b> primarily in the south-west and along the Sussex coast, with a few more impressive works in the north of England, but they were very limited in scale.|$|E
5|$|Brownsea Castle {{was built}} as a {{consequence}} of international tensions between England, France and the Holy Roman Empire in the final years of the reign of King Henry VIII. Traditionally the Crown had left coastal defences to the local lords and communities, only taking a small role in building and maintaining fortifications, and while France and the Empire remained in conflict with one another, maritime raids were common but an actual invasion of England seemed unlikely. Modest defences, based around simple blockhouses <b>and</b> <b>towers,</b> existed in the south-west and along the Sussex coast, with a few more impressive works in the north of England, but in general the fortifications were very limited in scale.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the battles}} at Maritsa (1371) and Kosovo field (1389), Serbia began to crumble as the Ottoman Empire conquered its {{southern}} territory. The north resisted through the Serbian Despotate, which had Belgrade as its capital. The city flourished under Stefan Lazarević, son of Serbian prince Lazar Hrebeljanović. Lazarević built a castle with a citadel <b>and</b> <b>towers,</b> of which only the Despot's tower and west wall remain. He also refortified the city's ancient walls, allowing the Despotate {{to resist the}} Ottomans for almost 70 years. During this time, Belgrade was a haven for many Balkan peoples fleeing Ottoman rule, and {{is thought to have}} had a population of 40,000 to 50,000 people.|$|E
