Chapman. FN16 The justice of this rule is obvious. If the facts are stated separately and the comment appears as an inference drawn from those facts, any injustice that it might do will be to some extent negatived by the reader seeing the grounds upon which the unfavourable inference is based. But if fact and comment be intermingled so that it is not reasonably clear what portion purports to be inference, he will naturally suppose that the injurious statements are based on adequate grounds known to the writer though not necessarily set out by him. In the one case the insufficiency of the facts to support the inference will lead fair-minded men to reject the inference. In the other case it merely points to the existence of extrinsic facts which the writer considers to warrant the language he uses. In this relation *320 I must express my disagreement with the view apparently taken by the Court of Queen's Bench in Ireland in the case of Lefroy v. Burnside FN17, where the imputation was that the plaintiffs dishonestly and corruptly supplied to a newspaper certain information. The Court treated the qualifications [...] "dishonestly" [...] or [...] "corruptly" [...] as clearly comment. In my opinion they are not comment, but constitute allegations of fact. It would have startled a pleader of the old school if he had been told that, in alleging that the defendant [...] "fraudulently represented," [...] he was indulging in comment. By {{the use of the word}} [...] "fraudulently" [...] he was probably making the most important <b>allegation</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> in the whole case. Any matter, therefore, which does not indicate with a reasonable clearness that it purports to be comment, and not statement of fact, cannot be protected by the plea of fair comment. In the next place, in order to give room for the plea of fair comment the facts must be truly stated. If the facts upon which the comment purports to be made do not exist the foundation of the plea fails. This has been so frequently laid down authoritatively that I do not need to dwell further upon it: see, for instance, the direction given by Kennedy J. to the jury in Joynt v. Cycle Trade Publishing Co. FN18, which has been frequently approved of by the Courts.” ...|$|E

50|$|Some early cases {{required}} plaintiffs {{to demonstrate}} that their cause of action could withstand a motion to dismiss.

50|$|Summary {{judgment}} is rarely granted in Virginia courts {{because it is}} easy for either party to raise a triable issue <b>of</b> <b>fact.</b> Unlike federal courts, where claims must be accompanied by an affidavit in order to raise a fact issue, Virginia courts treat the pleadings themselves as <b>allegations</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> sufficient to create a genuine issue for resolution by a trial. Summary judgment in Virginia is not available in divorce and annulment cases.|$|R

50|$|A {{party to}} {{a civil suit}} {{generally}} must clearly state all relevant <b>allegations</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> that {{form the basis of}} a claim. The requisite level of precision and particularity <b>of</b> these <b>allegations</b> varies, depending on the rules of civil procedure and jurisdiction. Parties who face uncertainties regarding facts and circumstances attendant to their side in a dispute may sometimes invoke alternative pleading. In this situation, a party may plead separate sets <b>of</b> <b>facts</b> that (when considered together) may be contradictory or mutually exclusive. This (seemingly) logically-inconsistent presentation <b>of</b> <b>facts</b> may be necessary as a safeguard against contingencies (such as res judicata) that would otherwise preclude presenting a claim or defense that depends on a particular interpretation <b>of</b> the underlying <b>facts.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the United States, a {{complaint}} {{is the first}} pleading filed by a plaintiff which initiates a lawsuit. A complaint sets forth the relevant <b>allegations</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> {{that give rise to}} one or more legal causes of action along with a prayer for relief and sometimes a statement of damages claimed (an ad quod damnum clause). In some situations, {{a complaint}} is called a petition, in which case the party filing it is called the petitioner and the other party is the respondent. In equity, sometimes called chancery, the initial pleading may be called either a petition or a bill of complaint in chancery.|$|R
50|$|Part of the {{complaint}} against the IOR was dismissed in 2007 {{on the basis}} of sovereign immunity, and the remainder of the claim against that defendant was dismissed on the ground that the property claim had no nexus to the United States, a decision confirmed in February 2010 by the Ninth Circuit. The case against the Franciscan Order, who by then were the sole defendants, ended in March 2011 when the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court's judgment dismissing the claim, and the case was not appealed further. No part of the claim, therefore, ever came to trial and none <b>of</b> the plaintiffs' <b>allegations</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> were ever established in Court.|$|R

The pamphlet alleged that a memorandum from Joseph Goebbels revealed that the Final Solution was never more than a plan to evacuate Jews to Madagascar. It was shown that there was no such memorandum but that the reference was to Goebbels diary entry of March 7, 1942. This diary extract was adduced and shown to state nothing of the kind. The Crown went on {{to point out that the}} entry for March 27, 1942 made clear that the Final Solution was, in fact, genocide: [...] "Not much will remain of the Jews.

5000|$|The {{defendant}} is bringing the application to rescind the default judgment {{and wants to}} defend the matter. This {{is the most common}} situation. It may occur, for instance, that for some reason, the defendant did not receive the summons. The next thing he knew the sheriff was at his door telling him that judgment had been taken against him. He consults an attorney, telling him that he has a good defence to the matter and would definitely have entered an appearance to defend if he had known about the summons. In this case the application must be supported by an affidavit, in which must be set out the reasons for the defendant's absence or default. This is where the defendant deals with the aspect of wilful default. The defendant sets out facts to show why he is in default, and must show that the default was not wilful. If any of the three elements discussed previously are absent, the defendant cannot beheld to be in wilful default. The onus of proving wilfulness is on the respondent in the application. The affidavit must also set out the grounds of the defendant's defence to the claim. This is perhaps {{the most important part of}} the affidavit. The defendant must set forth <b>allegations</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> which give rise to a defence. He need not deal fully with the merits, but sufficient facts must be alleged to show that a prima facie case exists.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} reforms instituted by the Press Law was a major reduction in the previously extensive range of activities deemed libelous. Libel is defined concisely as [...] "any <b>allegation</b> or imputation <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> striking a blow at the honour or the consideration of a person or a body to which that fact is imputed." [...] It is generally possible to defend oneself from a libel accusation by demonstrating that the libelous facts are true, though this is not accepted in all cases.|$|R
6000|$|The sacredness that Judge Douglas throws {{around this}} {{decision}} is {{a degree of}} sacredness {{that has never been}} before thrown around any other decision. I have never heard of such a thing. Why, decisions apparently contrary to that decision, or that good lawyers thought were contrary to that decision, have been made by that very court before. It is the first of its kind; it is an astonisher in legal history. It is a new wonder of the world. It is based upon falsehood in the main as to the facts; <b>allegations</b> <b>of</b> <b>facts</b> upon which it stands are not facts at all in many instances, and no decision made on any question--the first instance of a decision made under so many unfavorable circumstances--thus placed, has ever been held by the profession as law, and it has always needed confirmation before the lawyers regarded it as settled law. But Judge Douglas will have it that all hands must take this extraordinary decision, made under these extraordinary circumstances, and give their vote in Congress in accordance with it, yield to it, and obey it in every possible sense. Circumstances alter cases. Do not gentlemen here remember the case of that same Supreme Court some twenty-five or thirty years ago deciding that a National Bank was constitutional? I ask, if somebody does not remember that a National Bank was declared to be constitutional? Such is the truth, whether it be remembered or not. The Bank charter ran out, and a recharter was granted by Congress. That recharter was laid before General Jackson. It was urged upon him, when he denied the constitutionality of the Bank, that the Supreme Court had decided that it was constitutional; and General Jackson then said that the Supreme Court had no right to lay down a rule to govern a coordinate branch of the government, the members of which had sworn to support the Constitution; that each member had sworn to support that Constitution as he understood it. I will venture here to say that I have heard Judge Douglas say that he approved of General Jackson for that act. What has now become of all his tirade about [...] "resistance of the Supreme Court"? ...|$|R
40|$|This Master's degree thesis {{deals with}} {{legislation}} on the "principle of {{concentration in the}} contentious procedure" and related legal institutes. Pursuant {{to the principle of}} concentration, the parties to the civil proceedings are obliged to concentrate and perform the prescribed pleadings within particular time period. These pleadings include among others: <b>allegation</b> <b>of</b> material <b>facts,</b> proposed evidence to prove these facts and objections to the procedural matters. After the passage of prescribed time, a factual and evidentiary "stop condition" occurs, i. e. the parties to the proceedings are not able to perform the pleadings with relevant consequences in law anymore. Legislation on the principle of concentration has been significantly amended by adoption of several Civil Procedure Code amendments, namely Act N. 30 / 2000 Coll. and Act N. 7 / 2009 Coll. The thesis aims to analyse and critically evaluate these amendments. The thesis consists of seven chapters. The introductory chapter defines the theoretical concept of the principle of concentration and its intended purpose. The second chapter describes the concept of legal principles and places the principle of concentration in the group of civil procedure principles. The main attention is paid to the principle of legal order, the principle of [...] ...|$|R
