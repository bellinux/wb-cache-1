40|$|Anything in {{our world}} that moves vibrates air. If it moves {{in such a way}} that it oscillates at more than about 16 times a second this {{movement}} is heard as sound. The world, then, is full of sounds. (Schafer, 1969 : 5) Auditory space has no favoured focus. It’s a sphere without fixed boundaries, space made by the thing itself, not space containing the thing. It is not pictorial space, boxed-in, but dynamic, always in flux, creating its own dimensions moment by moment. (Carpenter, 1973 : 35) HOW DO we describe city spaces? There has been, in recent years,a prolixity of differing views on the treatment of this question inwhich two opposing general tendencies stand out: the reductionist and the phenomenological positions. Reductionist theorists argue that a city is no more than a lattice of physical enclosures, <b>apertures,</b> <b>planes,</b> inter-sections bound together by the regulatory force of the Cartesian grid. A phenomenological approach, on the other hand, can provide a theory of wider scope; it can include in the description of a city’s attributes the corpo-real, the sensual and psychological aspects of subjective experience, as well as the broader cultural characteristics of the different communities and subcultures which contribute to the diversity of city spaces. From this point of view, the reductionist position appears locked within its own rigidity, creating ossified spaces by relying on the method of deductive analysis, rather than on direct sensory experience. Non-reductive theories (of which there are many different kinds) align themselves with the notion that a city is not just the sum total of buildings and streets; indeed, it is not generated by the neat ontological division of container and contained: metaphorical space can supervene upon the physical divisions of the urban metropolis.
