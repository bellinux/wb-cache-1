5|$|List of United States {{business}} school rankings is a tabular listing {{of some of}} the {{business school}}s and their affiliated universities located in the United States that are included in {{one or more of the}} rankings of full-time Master of Business Administration programs. Rankings are typically published by magazines or websites. This list is not a comprehensive list of business schools in the United States. These rankings <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>subset</b> of college and university rankings. Business schools are university-level institutions generally affiliated with a university or college that produces students who attain business administration degrees. Most of the schools listed in the rankings below are accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business. Some of the publications shown here have related rankings for undergraduate, part-time and executive curricula. There is currently some controversy among faculty and administrators in American institutions of higher education regarding the request by the surveyors to have college presidents give their subjective opinion of other colleges because some of the methodologies are deemed misleading and a disservice. This has resulted in a movement surrounding the President's letter.|$|E

25|$|Crystal {{structures}} are typically categorized as minerals, metals-alloys, inorganics, organics, nucleic acids, and biological macromolecules. Individual crystal structure databases cater for users in specific chemical, molecular-biological, or related disciplines by covering super- or subsets of these categories. Minerals <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>subset</b> of mostly inorganic compounds. The category ‘metals-alloys’ covers metals, alloys, and intermetallics. Metals-alloys and inorganics can be merged into ‘non-organics’. Organic compounds and biological macromolecules are separated according to molecular size.

25|$|Blacklights <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>subset</b> of {{fluorescent}} lamps {{that are used}} to provide near ultraviolet light (at about 360nm wavelength). They are built in the same fashion as conventional {{fluorescent lamps}} but the glass tube is coated with a phosphor that converts the short-wave UV within the tube to long-wave UV rather than to visible light. They are used to provoke fluorescence (to provide dramatic effects using blacklight paint and to detect materials such as urine and certain dyes that would be invisible in visible light) as well as to attract insects to bug zappers. So-called blacklite blue lamps are also made from more expensive deep purple glass known as Wood's glass rather than clear glass. The deep purple glass filters out most of the visible colors of light directly emitted by the mercury-vapor discharge, producing proportionally less visible light compared with UV light. This allows UV-induced fluorescence to be seen more easily (thereby allowing blacklight posters to seem much more dramatic). The blacklight lamps used in bug zappers do not require this refinement so it is usually omitted in the interest of cost; they are called simply blacklite (and not blacklite blue).|$|E
