5|$|The {{interactions}} of carbonate anions with uranium(VI) cause the Pourbaix diagram to change greatly when the medium is changed from {{water to a}} carbonate containing solution. While {{the vast majority of}} carbonates are insoluble in water (students are often taught that all carbonates other than those of alkali metals are insoluble in water), uranium carbonates are often soluble in water. This is because a U(VI) cation is able to bind two terminal oxides <b>and</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> carbonates to form anionic complexes.|$|E

500|$|By early February 1845, {{when the}} Senate began {{to debate the}} Brown-amended Tyler treaty, its passage seemed unlikely, as support was [...] "perishing".

The Senate Democrats would require undivided support among their colleagues, <b>and</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> Whigs who would be willing to cross party lines to pass the House-amended treaty. The fact that Senator Foster had drafted the House amendment under consideration improved prospects of Senate passage.|$|E
