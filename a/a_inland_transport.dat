40|$|A {{dramatic}} {{boom in the}} Pearl River Delta (PRD) {{port system}} has emerged {{during the past two}} decades, from having Hong Kong as the only gateway hub to the coexistence of three world-ranked container ports. This paper presents the PRD port system development to date and identifies the underlying forces driving the port system evolution. In particular, the unique process by which the PRD port system went from one gateway port to two ports and the undergoing regionalization with specialization is examined. The network strategy is stressed in shaping the port system structure. With the advantage of a hinterland regionalization, Shenzhen, among the gateway ports in PRD, has acquired the market share from Hong Kong. Shenzhen and Guangzhou ports move from the hinterland-dominated regionalization to a more balanced regionalization based on <b>an</b> established <b>inland</b> <b>transport</b> network, whereas Hong Kong undergoes a foreland regionalization. If the hinterland connection remains relatively weak, the gateway function of the port in Hong Kong will further decline, but its transhipment role will further dominate.

30|$|According to the Financial Times (2014), {{there is}} a small but growing trend of “reshoring” of {{manufacturing}} from those manufacturing bases typically seen as low cost, such as Eastern Europe, Brazil and China. According to the EEF (2014) report “Backing Britain – A Manufacturing Base for the Future”, 1 in 6 of the 271 companies surveyed in 2013 indicated that they had brought some part of their manufacturing operation back to the UK. This is in part due to rising wages in China, but also due to increased operational efficiency in UK manufacturing and a desire to reduce transport costs. In the US, reduced energy costs - as a result of Shell gas exploitation and pressure on US multinational companies to preserve US jobs - have also resulted in a significant amount of reshoring. Reshoring will lead to <b>an</b> increase in <b>inland</b> <b>transport</b> in the EU, {{as a result of an}} increased number of freight trips between manufacturing sites, suppliers and warehousing facilities.|$|R

A reliable intermodal transport service can only be realized if the terminal operator has access to a sufficient and constant flow of cargo volumes to be transported. Cargo can only be attracted if shippers are willing to make a modal change. A framework consisting of several analyses was presented to assess the feasibility of <b>an</b> <b>inland</b> container terminal in Zutphen. Based on input from these analyses, three technical designs of proposed terminal solutions were worked out.
