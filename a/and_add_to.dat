As an R artist, she wanted to build her core audience–a true fan base that would support her through time–to increase her career's longevity.

Founded in 1316 by John Salmon, Bishop of Norwich, the chapel, in addition to its role as a chantry dedicated to the souls of Salmon's parents and the predecessors and successors of the Bishops of Norwich had also been used as a charnel house and contained the Wodehouse chantry, founded by Henry V at the request of John Wodehous, a veteran of the Battle of Agincourt. The school moved to the site in the summer of 1551, where it has remained ever since. The chapel was used as the main schoolroom while the other buildings were used to provide a library and accommodation for the master and boarding pupils. The arrangement continued until the 19th century, and today the building is used as the school chapel.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th and 20th centuries, a {{large part}} of Cabernet Sauvignon's {{reputation}} was built on its ability to age and develop in the bottle. In addition to softening some of their austere tannins, as Cabernet wines age new flavors and aromas can emerge <b>and</b> <b>add</b> <b>to</b> the wines' complexity. Historically this was a trait characterized by Bordeaux with some premium examples in favorable vintages having the potential to last for over a century, but producers across the globe have developed styles that could age and develop for several decades. Even with the ability to age, some Cabernet Sauvignon wines can still be approachable a few years after vintage. In Bordeaux, the tannins of the wines tend to soften after ten years and can typically last for at least another decade-sometimes longer depending on the producer and vintage. Some Spanish and Italian Cabernet Sauvignons will need similar time as Bordeaux to develop but most examples are typically made to be drunk earlier.|$|E

Israel contends that the Health Ministry's casualty count also includes deaths caused by rocket or mortar malfunctions.|$|E
25|$|Cognitive {{behavioral}} therapy (CBT) is {{the most}} widely used and established psychological treatment for mental disorders, but has appeared less successful in BPD, due partly to difficulties in developing a therapeutic relationship and treatment adherence.

25|$|Non-food crops like Camelina, Jatropha, {{seashore}} mallow and mustard, {{used for}} biodiesel, can thrive on {{marginal agricultural land}} where many trees and crops won't grow, or would produce only slow growth yields. Camelina is virtually 100 percent efficient. It can be harvested and crushed for oil and the remaining parts {{can be used to}} produce high quality omega-3 rich animal feed, fiberboard, and glycerin. Camelina does not take away from land currently being utilized for food production. Most camelina acres are grown in areas that were previously not utilized for farming. For example, areas that receive limited rainfall that can not sustain corn or soybeans without the addition of irrigation can grow camelina <b>and</b> <b>add</b> <b>to</b> their profitability.|$|E
25|$|Links in food webs map {{the feeding}} {{connections}} (who eats whom) in an ecological community. Food cycle is an obsolete term that {{is synonymous with}} food web. Ecologists can broadly group all life forms into one of two trophic layers, the autotrophs and the heterotrophs. Autotrophs produce more biomass energy, either chemically without the sun's energy or by capturing the sun's energy in photosynthesis, than they use during metabolic respiration. Heterotrophs consume rather than produce biomass energy as they metabolize, grow, <b>and</b> <b>add</b> <b>to</b> levels of secondary production. A food web depicts a collection of polyphagous heterotrophic consumers that network and cycle the flow of energy and nutrients from a productive base of self-feeding autotrophs.|$|E
25|$|Liszt {{attempted}} in the symphonic poem {{to extend}} this revitalisation {{of the nature}} of musical discourse <b>and</b> <b>add</b> <b>to</b> it the Romantic ideal of reconciling classical formal principles to external literary concepts. To this end, he combined elements of overture and symphony with descriptive elements, approaching symphonic first movements in form and scale. While showing extremely creative amendments to sonata form, Liszt used compositional devices such as cyclic form, motifs and thematic transformation to lend these works added coherence. Their composition proved daunting, requiring a continual process of creative experimentation that included many stages of composition, rehearsal and revision to reach a version where different parts of the musical form seemed balanced.|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{polished}} and complex {{nature of the}} Aeneid (legend stating that Virgil wrote only three lines of the poem each day), the number of half-complete lines and the abrupt ending are generally seen as evidence that Virgil died before he could finish the work. Because this poem was composed and preserved in writing rather than orally, the Aeneid is more complete than most classical epics. Furthermore, {{it is possible to}} debate whether Virgil intended to rewrite <b>and</b> <b>add</b> <b>to</b> such lines. Some of them would be difficult to complete, and in some instances, the brevity of a line increases its dramatic impact (some arguing the violent ending as a typically Virgilian comment on the darker, vengeful side of humanity). However, these arguments may be anachronistic—half-finished lines might equally, to Roman readers, have been a clear indication of an unfinished poem and have added nothing whatsoever to the dramatic effect.|$|E
25|$|Swales can be {{incorporated}} in urban designs along streets or parklands <b>and</b> <b>add</b> <b>to</b> the aesthetic character of an area. Typical swales are created with longitudinal slopes between 1% and 4% {{in order to maintain}} flow capacity without creating high velocities, potential erosion of the bioretention or swale surface and safety hazard. In steeper areas check banks along swales or dense vegetation can help to distribute ﬂows evenly across swales and slow velocities. Milder-sloped swales may have issues with water-logging and stagnant ponding, in which case underdrains can be employed to alleviate problems. If the swale is to be vegetated, vegetation must be capable of withstanding design ﬂows and be of sufficient density to provide good ﬁltration). Ideally, vegetation height should be above treatment ﬂow water levels. If runoff enters directly into a swale, perpendicular to the main ﬂow direction, the edge of the swale acts as a buffer and provides pre-treatment for the water entering the swale.|$|E
25|$|Long {{aluminium}} beadings on {{the sides}} were painted cream, a visual device to make the locomotive's high sides appear more slender <b>and</b> <b>add</b> <b>to</b> the impression of speed. Three curved chevrons on each nose, in the same cream, added to that effect. To British eyes, the locomotive's styling was reminiscent of American locomotives, such as the EMD E-unit or ALCO PA designs (partly because English Electric initially planned to offer the type for export), with high noses and small, somewhat swept-back cab windows set behind them. To add to the American look of the locomotive, a large headlight {{was to have been}} fitted to each nose (the lights were never installed but would have been of the rotating 'Mars Light' type as fitted to North American locomotives of the era). Two 18-cylinder Deltic engines were fitted, derated from the 1,750 horsepower (1.3 MW) of the marine engines in minesweepers to 1,650 horsepower (1.2 MW) each, generating 3,300 horsepower (2.5 MW) total. This derating reduced the stress on the engines, thereby increasing the service life and length of time between overhauls.|$|E

25|$|The force {{accelerating}} a pinewood derby car is gravity; {{the opposing}} forces are friction and air drag. Therefore, car modifications {{are aimed at}} maximizing the potential energy in the car design and minimizing the air drag and the friction that occurs when the wheel spins on the axle, contacts the axle head or car body, or contacts the track guide rail. Friction due to air drag is a minor, although not insignificant, factor. The wheel tread can be sanded or turned on a lathe and the inner surface of the hub can be tapered to minimize the contact area between the hub and body. Polishing the wheel, especially the inner hub, with a plastic polish can also reduce friction. Often one front wheel is raised slightly {{so that it does}} not contact the track <b>and</b> <b>add</b> <b>to</b> the rolling resistance. Axles are filed or turned on a lathe to remove the burr and crimp marks and polished smooth. More extensive modifications involve tapering the axle head and cutting a notch to minimize the wheel-to-axle contact area. Packs can establish additional rules for what, if any, modifications are allowed. In some areas, no changes can be made to the axles or wheels.|$|E
