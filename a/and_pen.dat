As a colleague of Watsuki, he worked primarily as a manga assistant, only focusing on his own projects during his days off. He was influenced by street art from hip-hop and rap culture, which is apparent in his manga artwork. For drawing, he used calligraphy inks <b>and</b> <b>pen</b> nibs. When illustrating, he used Copic brand color markers.|$|E

5|$|Fairman left to edit Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine {{at the end}} of 1958, and {{his place}} was taken by Cele Goldsmith.

Ziff-Davis were not confident of Goldsmith's abilities as an editor, so when Fairman left, a consultant, Norman Lobsenz, was hired to work with her. She performed well, however, and Lobsenz's involvement soon became minimal.|$|E
5|$|Vietnam sent 13 {{divisions}} {{into the}} country on 25 December 1978, with an estimated 150,000 soldiers supported by heavy artillery and air power. Kampuchea attempted a conventional defense, but this tactic led {{to the loss of}} half of its army within two weeks. The defeats prompted much of the Kampuchean leadership to evacuate towards the western region of the country. On 7 January 1979, the Vietnamese Army entered Phnom Penh along with the Kampuchean United Front for National Salvation. On the following day, a pro-Vietnamese state, known as the People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK), was established, with Heng Samrin as head of state <b>and</b> <b>Pen</b> Sovan as General Secretary of the Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Party. The struggle between the Khmer Rouge and the PRK ended only with Vietnam's withdrawal in 1989.|$|E
5|$|Wilde, having {{tired of}} journalism, had been busy setting out his {{aesthetic}} ideas more fully {{in a series}} of longer prose pieces which were published in the major literary-intellectual journals of the day. In January 1889, The Decay of Lying: A Dialogue appeared in The Nineteenth Century, <b>and</b> <b>Pen,</b> Pencil and Poison, a satirical biography of Thomas Griffiths Wainewright, in The Fortnightly Review, edited by Wilde's friend Frank Harris. Two of Wilde's four writings on aesthetics are dialogues: though Wilde had evolved professionally from lecturer to writer, he retained an oral tradition of sorts. Having always excelled as a wit and raconteur, he often composed by assembling phrases, bons mots and witticisms into a longer, cohesive work.|$|E

5|$|On 21 December 1978, Kampuchea’s new-found {{strength}} was tested when a Vietnamese offensive, {{consisting of two}} divisions, crossed the border and moved towards the town of Kratie, while other support divisions were deployed along local routes {{to cut off the}} logistical tail of Kampuchean units. Despite enjoying generous support from China, the Kampuchean military could not withstand the Vietnamese offensive and suffered heavy casualties. Finally, on 25 December 1978, Vietnam launched a full-scale invasion using 13 divisions, estimated at 150,000 soldiers well-supported by heavy artillery and air power. Initially, Kampuchea directly challenged Vietnam’s military might through conventional fighting methods, but this tactic resulted in the loss of half of the Kampuchean Revolutionary Army within two weeks. Heavy defeats on the battlefield prompted much of the Kampuchean leadership to evacuate towards the western region of the country. On 7 January 1979, the Vietnamese Army entered Phnom Penh along with members of the KUFNS. On the following day, a pro-Vietnamese Kampuchean state, known as the People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK), was established, with Heng Samrin as the Chief of State <b>and</b> <b>Pen</b> Sovan as General Secretary of the Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Party.|$|E

Baptists, Presbyterians, Catholics, Mormons, Democrats, Republicans, secessionists, drunks, immigrants, and abolitionists-all were {{at one time or another}} on the receiving end of Brownlow's merciless broadsides.

25|$|In India, {{the need}} for {{environmental}} flows has emerged from the hundreds of large dams being planned in the Himalayan rivers for hydro power generation.
