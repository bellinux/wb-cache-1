5|$|According to Hindu legend, god Vishnu sat in {{meditation}} <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>place,</b> keeping {{away from}} Thuling, {{a place in}} the Himalayas which was corrupted by meat-eating monks and unchaste people. During his meditation, Vishnu was unaware of cold weather. Lakshmi, his consort, protected him {{in the form of the}} Badri tree (jujube or Indian date). Pleased by the devotion of Lakshmi, Vishnu named the place Badrika Ashram. According to Atkinson (1979), the place used to be a jujube forest, which are not found there today. Vishnu in the form of Badrinath is depicted in the temple sitting in the padmasana posture. According to the legend, Vishnu was chastised by a sage, who saw Vishnu's consort Lakshmi massaging his feet. Vishnu went to Badrinath to perform austerity, meditating for a long time in padmasana.|$|E

Metallographic tests confirmed literature studies that cracks nucleate at points {{of two or three}} grain joints and cross-cut of twined grain with border of the grains. The non-homogeneous character of chemical composition concentrating in areas of grain joints and cracks at high temperature has been investigated by linear and point Cu and Ni analysis (EDS). This analysis shows that local areas of non-equilibrium formation concentrate <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>places.</b> <b>This</b> fact can be accepted as one of the reasons of non-homogeneous deformation, cracking and its location at DMT...|$|R
