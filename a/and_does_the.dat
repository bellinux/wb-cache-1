On three occasions, Cartman uses expanded and modified versions of idiomatic phrases, such as [...] "?", [...] "?", and their combination, [...] "?", which are rhetorical questions used {{in response to a}} question where the answer is an emphatic yes. Thus, Cartman implies an affirmative response to questions such as: [...] "Does the pope help pedophiles get away with their crimes?" [...] and [...] "Is the Pope Catholic? And making the world safe for pedophiles?" [...] These are references to allegations that Pope Benedict XVI ignored warnings and concealed evidence that Rev. Peter Hullermann engaged in several acts of child sexual abuse under the future Pope's watch as Archbishop of Munich and Freising in the 1980s. During another scene, Cartman says, [...] "Does a bear crap in the woods? <b>And</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> Pope crap on the broken lives and dreams of 200 deaf boys?"
