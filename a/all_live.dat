5|$|The Powerpuff Girls is an American superhero {{animated}} {{television series}} created by animator Craig McCracken for Cartoon Network. The show centers on Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup, three girls with superpowers, {{as well as}} their father, the brainy scientist Professor Utonium, who <b>all</b> <b>live</b> in the city of Townsville. The girls are frequently called upon by the town's childlike and naive mayor to help fight nearby criminals using their powers.|$|E
5|$|By 1955 the {{original}} sound negatives began to deteriorate, though a four-track copy had survived in good condition. Using the remaining Fantasound {{system at the}} studio, a three-track stereo copy was transferred across telephone wires onto magnetic film at an RCA facility in Hollywood. This copy was used when Fantasia was reissued in stereo by Buena Vista Distribution in SuperScope, a derivative of the anamorphic widescreen CinemaScope format, on February 7, 1956. The projector featured an automatic control mechanism designed by Disney engineers that was coupled to a variable anamorphic lens, which allowed the picture to switch between its Academy standard aspect ratio of 1.33:1 to the wide ratio of 2.35:1 in twenty seconds without {{a break in the}} film. This was achieved by placing the cues that controlled the mechanism on a separate track in addition to the three audio channels. Only selected parts of the animation were stretched, while <b>all</b> <b>live</b> action scenes remained unchanged. This reissue garnered some criticism from viewers, as the widescreen format led to the cropping and reframing of the images.|$|E
5|$|Kutzer {{points out}} Timmy {{and his wife}} wear clothes, but the other {{squirrels}} and the bear do not. There is no apparent reason for this differentiation. She admits {{that this may be}} Potter's attempt to separate her anthropomorphized animals from her natural ones, but she believes the attempt fails on both narrative and artistic grounds. Logically, she argues, all the squirrels should wear (or not wear) clothes because they <b>all</b> <b>live</b> and behave in a natural manner: Timmy and Goody inhabit a nest in a tree (not a comfortable little house somewhere), and all the squirrels gather nuts for the coming winter. Except for Timmy having a wife, there is no clear distinction between natural and personified squirrel nature. In another stumbling block to logic, Timmy's red jacket appears then disappears then reappears in the illustrations with no basis either in the plot or Timmy's character, but apparently in Potter's personal need for a splash of colour here and there. In this case, Potter has allowed an external force to shape the tale rather than letting the tale find its own shape.|$|E

5|$|The {{four main}} {{characters}} of Children of Mana are Ferrik, Tamber, Poppen, and Wanderer. They <b>all</b> <b>live</b> {{together in the}} Mana Village, near the Mana Tree.

25|$|The Shire was {{originally}} {{divided into four}} Farthings. The outlying lands of Buckland and the Westmarch were formally added after the War of the Ring, although Buckland had been settled by Hobbits long before the war. Within the Farthings there are some smaller unofficial clan homelands: the Tooks nearly <b>all</b> <b>live</b> in or near Tuckborough in Tookland, for instance. A Hobbit surname often indicates where the family came from: Samwise Gamgee's last name derives from Gamwich, where the family originated. Buckland was named for the Oldbucks (later called the Brandybucks).|$|E
