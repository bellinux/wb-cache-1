5|$|<b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>factors</b> {{have led}} to wide {{speculation}} {{that most of the}} 3.5million unsold copies of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial ultimately wound up in this landfill, crushed and encased in concrete. It has also been reported that prototypes for the proposed Atari Mindlink controller system were disposed of at the site, which only further fuels speculation, since Atari Museum owner Curt Vendel actually currently owns the Mindlink prototypes. Writing for the Pacific Historical Review, John Wills speculated that location's place in the public psyche—its proximity to the sites of both the Trinity nuclear test and Roswell UFO incident—has aided the popularity of the story.|$|E
5|$|By early afternoon, the {{low-pressure}} {{area had}} moved east into Nebraska, while the warm front had moved northward into southern Minnesota. The atmosphere {{to the south}} of the warm front was strongly capped, meaning that the best chance of thunderstorm development was in areas along and slightly north of the front. By the time the thunderstorms started developing, CAPE values were 2000J/kg, indicating moderate atmospheric instability. Also present were low-level and deep-layer wind shear values of , respectively. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>factors</b> combined to create very favorable conditions for the development of severe thunderstorms and tornadoes.|$|E
5|$|Large female Murray cod in the 15– to 35-kg (35– to 80-lb) range are {{the most}} {{important}} breeders because they produce the most eggs and for other reasons; large females in most fish species are also important because they produce larger larvae with larger yolk sacs, and are also more experienced breeders that display optimal breeding behaviours. Such large females may also have valuable, successful genes to pass on. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>factors</b> mean the spawnings of large female fish have far higher larval survival rates and make far greater reproductive contributions than the spawnings of small female fish.|$|E

In the current study, the bleeding rate in the laser group was less than that in the control group. This was consistent with other studies on the decreased bleeding after laser-assisted surgery [25],[27],[32],[33].

Women in this group have reduced access to health care, high rates of child and forced marriage, parity, polygamy and exposure to STIs from multiple sexual contacts of male partners. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>factors</b> place them at higher risk.

The highest incidence occurs in Eastern Africa, where with Middle Africa, cervical cancer is the commonest cancer in women.

50|$|During this time, {{there was}} a {{significant}} amount of African-Americans migrating up North from the South due to disenfranchisement and the Jim Crow laws. Race supremacists formed hate groups and cast crimes upon many African-American families during that time. Also, these were still times that blacks worked as low-paid sharecroppers. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>factored</b> into the mass Northward movement of blacks during this time. The northerners were not totally sold on this movement and didn’t necessarily accept the African-American migrators. This forced them to find a community to move into. Harlem, at the time, was becoming a melting pot for new communities. Harlem quickly became the area to continue African-American traditions through the arts. Thus, the Harlem Renaissance begins, and the demand for African-American apartment communities rises, making this the perfect time to corner the African-American real estate market in this area.|$|R

25|$|In {{the late}} twentieth century, Irish society {{underwent}} rapid social change. After the introduction of free education in the late 1960s, many more people had access to second and third level qualifications. The relative economic success of the 1960s and 1970s also decreased emigration, meaning that Ireland became a younger and much more urban society than before.

Close to the ice it can reach 30–50g/m2. These values are not outstandingly high, compared to very productive areas like the North Sea or upwelling regions, but the area over which it takes place is enormous, even compared to other large primary producers such as rainforests. In addition, during the Austral summer there are many hours of daylight to fuel the process. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>factors</b> make the plankton and the krill a critical part of the planet's ecocycle.|$|E

It can be stripped and terminated during installation or service with far less danger of nicks or breaks. And it can be connected without the use of special lugs and fittings.

25|$|<b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>factors</b> {{together}} {{have made}} it exceedingly difficult to distinguish between what constitutes a language or a dialect in Mesoamerica. Linguistic isoglosses do not coincide often or strongly enough to prove very useful when trying to decide, and sociological factors often further cloud the picture. The significance of measurements of intelligibility (which is itself difficult to measure) depends very much on analysts' purposes and theoretical commitments. In Spanish the word “dialecto” has often been used generically about indigenous languages in order to describe them as inherently inferior to the European languages. In recent years this has caused an aversion to the term “dialect” among Spanish-speaking linguists and others, and the term “variante” has often been applied instead.|$|E
