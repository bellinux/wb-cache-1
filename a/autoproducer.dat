40|$|There is a {{historic}} tradition of industrial autoproduction of electricity in Germany. Major energy users in the past used to be and today often still are <b>autoproducers</b> of electric power. The public utility sector, according to present legal standards, operates in a framework that protects local and regional monopolies. The large consumers and <b>autoproducers</b> are an important countervailing power in the whole system of the electricity supply industry. Electric utilities (EU) in Germany are semi-public or private enterprises {{of a wide variety}} of size. The large producer utilities operate the high voltage grid on the basis of private contracts. Regional distribution companies mostly without a considerable share in production often in cooperation with local distributors deliver electricity (el) in the non-urban areas whereas mostly city owned EU supply the large cities often on the basis of considerable parts of autoproduction and often also with a considerable share of el produced in cogeneration plants. The equilibrium between the parts of this system in the past was ensured by a legal framework protecting local monopolies as well as long term contracts between producers and distributors. This equilibrium derived its stability from political more than from economic factors. Deregulation trends inherent in European legislation on competition have threatened this stability. - In the first phase resistance against a more competitive order seemed unanimous. In the meantime however the different actors had time to rethink their position: - The European Council has now proposed a more moderate regulation taking into account the large differences in the ESI in the different member countries. - The German Government has made a proposal for some important changes in the Energy Law and connected passages in the Competition Law, which would introduce some more competitive elements into the system without anticipating the results of a competitive process. - Wholesale producers and regional distributors as well as customer groups are in favour of this reform, whereas the local distributions fear to become the losers in the ongoing reform process. - Environmentalists express concern that a more competitive order could lead to a lowering of environmental standards. This paper gives a short survey of the ongoing reform and the influence of the large energy consumers. (orig.)

40|$|Environmental {{costs of}} {{electric}} power generation are receiving increasing attention as an important input to planning and decision processes. Since the outstart of the discussion on the monetized environmental costs of electricity in 1988 {{a number of studies}} have been conducted on the subject, producing partially contradictory results. Simultaneously political action has resulted from the first stage on this discussion process. In Germany the higher rates which have to be payed to <b>autoproducers</b> based on renewable energy sources have been explicitly justified by the existence of external environmental costs of conventional electricity generation. At the same time some state regulatory commissions in the United States have introduced adders for environmental costs in the utility planning process. This book reports on the first international workshop on the subject, bringing together practically all experts in the field of research and political implementation from the United States and G ermany, the two pioneering countries. The more than thirty contributed papers contained in this volume give the most comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the field. Some papers already outline the future course of research by giving an overview over some major research projects, which have just started...|$|R
40|$|In 1998 the {{electricity}} production in industrial installations in Germany was about 40 TWh. This accounts for 66 % {{of the total}} electricity production with CHP plants in Germany. The presentation will analyse the developments for industrial CHP throughout the last 10 years and will try to explain the developments. The difficult situation for the industrial CHP shows up from the sharp decrease of the total installed capacity by about 2000 MW during 1996 and 1998, already in approach of the full liberalisation of {{the electricity}} market in Germany, which has resulted in further and even more plant shut downs. Based on {{a survey of the}} German Association of Industrial <b>Autoproducers</b> and Energy Consumers (VIK) plants with a total capacity of 500 MW were closed down in 1999, and about 60 % of the industrial CHP installation are facing serious economic problems. The presentation will show some sample economic calculations for different types of plants (Coal fired steam turbines, gas turbines, IC-engines). These results will be compared to the actual energy cost structures for industrial customers. Based on large over capacity in power generation, the offered electricity prices for industrial customers tend to be in the range off the operating cost of the industrial CHP plants. One way out of this dilemma is sometimes the outsourcing and contracting of CHP installations, which has been and still is a growing business in Germany, and utilities regard these options as a possibility to keep their industrial customers.

40|$|Wind {{is one of}} the world's {{fastest growing}} {{renewable}} energy sources. The rapid growth in wind power is a result of improvements accomplished in technology. This paper presents the technical and economical feasibility of wind farms. The method is applied to a potential wind farm site located in Izmir, Turkey. The site is considered on technical and economical parameters for the complete plant and its running costs. For technical consideration wind speed, prevailing wind direction, and temperature measurements are performed. For economical consideration, three different scenarios namely, <b>autoproducer,</b> <b>autoproducer</b> group, and independent power producer (IPP) cases, are investigated and compared with respect to net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR), and pay back period (PBP) criteria. The study indicates the costs of generated energy by wind turbines with different characteristics {{as a function of the}} installed capacity. It is concluded that, the larger the installed capacity, the smaller the generating cost per kWh. The generating cost was calculated as low as 2. 68 UScent/kWh for the IPP scenario. The profitability analysis also shows that, larger installed capacity with larger rated power wind turbines present higher IRR of the investment. The sensitivity analysis backs up the findings...|$|E
40|$|Annex 7. b Emissions {{from the}} power sector This annex {{outlines}} sources of emissions {{from the power}} sector now, historical and projected business as usual trends, drivers behind growth in emissions, and prospects for emission cuts. Now Emissions from the power sector 1 are currently 10. 3 GtCO 2 (24 % of total greenhouse gases) 2. Fossil fuels account for {{three quarters of the}} fuel used in this sector, of which coal is most dominant (see figure 2). Coal is also responsible for the majority of emissions from this sector (see figure 1). Under half of the electricity and heat produced is used in buildings (residential and commercial), around one third in industry, just under one tenth in energy production and processing (such as refineries), and the remaining less than one tenth is lost in transmission and distribution. OECD North America is currently by far the largest single emitter of power sector emissions (3 GtCO 2), followed by China (1. 7 GtCO 2), OECD Europe (1. 6 GtCO 2) and transition economies (1. 4 GtCO 2). 3 OECD North America also has among the highest emissions per capita (7 tCO 2 /person), more than twice the level of OCED Europe and six times the level of China.
