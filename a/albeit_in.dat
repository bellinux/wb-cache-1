5|$|Following {{the end of}} Bristol Community Festival, {{other groups}} emerged hoping to {{continue}} {{with some sort of}} summer festival in Bristol. Bristol Music Festival became the Bristol Festival (now BrisFest) and has so far successfully put on four summer festivals, <b>albeit</b> <b>in</b> the city centre. 2011 saw the most successful even yet, with over 25,000 people attending over three days.|$|E
5|$|In many decapods, {{the first}} (and {{sometimes}} the second) pair of pleopods are specialised {{in the male}} for sperm transfer. Many terrestrial crustaceans (such as the Christmas Island red crab) mate seasonally {{and return to the}} sea to release the eggs. Others, such as woodlice, lay their eggs on land, <b>albeit</b> <b>in</b> damp conditions. In most decapods, the females retain the eggs until they hatch into free-swimming larvae.|$|E
5|$|Perdiccas {{initially}} did {{not claim}} power, instead suggesting that Roxane's baby would be king, if male; with himself, Craterus, Leonnatus, and Antipater as guardians. However, the infantry, {{under the command}} of Meleager, rejected this arrangement since they had been excluded from the discussion. Instead, they supported Alexander's half-brother Philip Arrhidaeus. Eventually, the two sides reconciled, and after the birth of Alexander IV, he and Philip III were appointed joint kings, <b>albeit</b> <b>in</b> name only.|$|E

5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, Nürnberg {{was seized}} by the Royal Navy and {{ultimately}} awarded to the Soviet Union as war reparations. In December 1945, a Soviet crew took over the ship, and the following month took her to Tallinn, where she was renamed Admiral Makarov. She served in the Soviet Navy, first in the 8th Fleet, then as a training cruiser based in Kronstadt. Her ultimate fate is unclear, but by 1960, she had been broken up for scrap. Nürnberg was the second-largest warship of the Kriegsmarine to survive the war intact, after the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen, and she was the only vessel to see service after the war, <b>albeit</b> <b>in</b> a foreign navy.|$|E
5|$|Chryssides {{states that}} Raëlism is {{discernible}} from other UFO religions for its heavy support for physicalism and repudiation of supernaturalism. Susan J. Palmer, a social scholar {{who had long}} contacts with Raëlians, associated epiphenomenalism with the belief in Raëlism that mind transfer coupled with human cloning can implant mind and personality into a new and disease free body. Raëlians publicly deny {{the existence of the}} ethereal soul and a supernatural god, but they believe that humanity for many generations past will be resurrected, <b>albeit</b> <b>in</b> a scientific way.|$|E

5|$|Despite the FA Cup setback, Arsenal {{bounced back}} in the League, and with the same scoring form as in 1930–31, {{finished}} the season having scored 118League goals in total, including a 5–0 win over rivals Aston Villa in that season's title-deciding match. In the following close season, Chapman became the first professional manager in charge of England, <b>albeit</b> <b>in</b> an ad hoc unofficial capacity, for a summer tour of Europe. He {{did not have any}} input into the selection process, the team being determined by the FA's International Selection Committee, but did advise on tactics and gave pre-match team talks. Chapman was in charge for a friendly against Italy in Rome on 13 May 1933, which finished 1–1, and England's 4–0 win over Switzerland a week later.|$|E
5|$|Fielding's seventh play, Rape upon Rape; or, The Justice Caught in His Own Trap, was a five-act comedic {{play that}} first ran on 23 June 1730 at the Little Theatre for eight nights. The play enjoyed some success {{until it was}} renamed The Coffee-House Politician and was altered to {{possibly}} update the play as it focused on mocking current news events. The play is a love comedy that incorporates a corrupt judge that stands in the lovers' way. Eventually, various characters attempt to stop the judge, but he prevails <b>albeit</b> <b>in</b> a comedic fashion. Fielding's focus in the play is to point out corruption in government and to attack those who abuse their power.|$|E
5|$|He {{returned}} to the Mexican League in 1947 and 1948 for the financial remuneration, but, comparatively speaking, the venture was unsuccessful for Day, who finished with a combined record of 18–20 and a 4.00 ERA. Following his departure from the Negro leagues in 1950, Day spent a season with the semi-professional Winnipeg Buffalos of the Mandak League. Finally, in 1951 Day made his debut in organized baseball, <b>albeit</b> <b>in</b> the minors, with the Toronto Maple Leafs, a Triple-A club that Day tallied a 1–1 record with in 14 games. Day also played for two other teams in the farm system, the Scranton Miners and the Edmonton Eskimos, before retiring from professional baseball in 1955.|$|E

The stadium bears a similar {{name to the}} Portuguese club Benfica's ground Estádio da Luz, <b>albeit</b> <b>in</b> a different language. Stadium expansion in 2000 saw the capacity increase to 49,000.

5|$|In December 1921, {{they left}} the country {{and went to the}} Latvian capital city of Riga. The US {{commissioner}} in that city wired officials in Washington DC, who began requesting information from other governments about the couple's activities. After a short trip to Stockholm, they moved to Berlin for several years; during this time Goldman agreed to write a series of articles about her time in Russia for Joseph Pulitzer's newspaper, the New York World. These were later collected and published in book form as My Disillusionment in Russia (1923) and My Further Disillusionment in Russia (1924). The publishers added these titles to attract attention; Goldman protested, <b>albeit</b> <b>in</b> vain.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s passenger-rail groups urged Amtrak {{to extend the}} Pennsylvanian to Cleveland, Ohio. Proposals {{included}} new stations in Sewickley and Beaver Falls. Pressure increased in 1989 when Amtrak announced the re-routing of the Broadway Limited and Capitol Limited over that same route {{as part of a}} restructuring of routes in Indiana. As part of this change, the Capitol Limited began serving the ClevelandPittsburgh route, <b>albeit</b> <b>in</b> the middle of the night. Amtrak and PennDOT considered two routes for an extended Pennsylvanian: one via Alliance, Ohio (following the route of the Capitol Limited) and one via Youngstown, Ohio (partially following the Broadway Limited) with a new stop in New Castle, Pennsylvania.|$|E

5|$|Initially the Morayshire ran trains {{over the}} IAJR, but its {{lightweight}} locomotives {{struggled with the}} gradients and proved unreliable, and after six weeks carriages were attached and detached from IAJR trains at Elgin and Orton. Conflict arose over through ticketing, and {{the directors of the}} Morayshire responded with plans to build its own line between the two stations. The Great North sponsored the new line and offered to provide services after the lines had been physically connected. Permission was granted on 3 July 1860, goods were carried from 30 December 1861 and passengers from 1 January 1862, reducing the travel time from 55 minutes to 45 minutes. The Morayshire station at Elgin was enlarged in anticipation of Great North services, <b>albeit</b> <b>in</b> wood.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{entered his}} 2006 junior {{season in the}} running for the Biletnikoff Award and Heisman Trophy.

Johnson tallied 1,202 yards on 76catches. Johnson's 15touchdowns in 2006 was a new Georgia Tech single-season record. Against the West Virginia Mountaineers in the Toyota Gator Bowl, Johnson had nine catches for 186yards and two touchdowns, <b>albeit</b> <b>in</b> a losing effort.|$|E
5|$|Murrell's fame greatly {{increased}} {{after his death}} when he was made the subject, <b>albeit</b> <b>in</b> a highly fictionalised form, of a 1900 novel by Arthur Morrison. Morrison also produced a more objective study of the cunning man, published in The Strand magazine. During the 1950s, the folklorist Eric Maple conducted further research on Murrell, finding much local folklore still surrounding him in the Hadleigh area, including the allegation {{that he had the}} ability to fly and to instantaneously transport himself vast distances. Murrell has continued {{to attract the attention of}} historians and folklorists studying English folk magic, and is referenced in works by scholars like Ronald Hutton, Owen Davies, and Ralph Merrifield.|$|E
