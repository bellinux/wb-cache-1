This isotope {{does not cause}} <b>aging</b> <b>of</b> the phosphor, as alpha emitters do, and therefore the light emission is stable for a few years.

5|$|Meyer added {{elements}} {{to reinforce the}} <b>aging</b> <b>of</b> the characters. Kirk's unhappiness about his birthday is compounded by McCoy's gift of reading glasses. The script stated that Kirk was 49, but Shatner was unsure about being specific about Kirk's age. Bennett remembers that Shatner was hesitant about portraying a middle-aged version of himself, and believed that with proper makeup he could continue playing a younger Kirk. Bennett convinced Shatner that he could age gracefully like Spencer Tracy; the producer {{did not know that}} Shatner had worked with Tracy on Judgment at Nuremberg (1961), and was fond of the actor. Meyer made sure to emphasize Kirk's parallel to Sherlock Holmes in that both characters waste away in the absence of their stimuli; new cases, in Holmes' case, and starship adventures in Kirk's.|$|E
5|$|Since then, {{the hospice}} {{industry}} has rapidly expanded. This growth has accompanied the AIDS epidemic and the <b>aging</b> <b>of</b> the population, with related illnesses. By 1995, hospices were a $2.8 billion industry, with $1.9 billion from Medicare alone funding patients in 1,857 hospice programs with Medicare certification. In that year, 72% of hospice providers were non-profit. By 1998, there were 3,200 hospices either in operation or under development throughout the United States and Puerto Rico, {{according to the}} National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization (NHPCO). According to 2007's Last Rights: Rescuing the End of Life from the Medical System, hospice sites are expanding at a national rate of about 3.5% per year. In 2007, 1.4 {{million people in the}} United States used hospice, with more than one-third of dying Americans using the service, approximately 39%. In 2008, Medicare alone, which pays for 80% of hospice treatment, paid $10 billion to the 4,000 Medicare-certified providers in the United States.|$|E

5|$|The <b>aging</b> <b>of</b> adult skeletons {{is not as}} {{straightforward}} as aging a child's skeleton as {{the skeleton}} changes little once adulthood is reached. One possible way to estimate the age of an adult skeleton {{is to look at}} bone osteons under a microscope. New osteons are constantly formed by bone marrow even after the bones stop growing. Younger adults have fewer and larger osteons while older adults have smaller and more osteon fragments. Another potential method for determining the age of an adult skeleton is to look for arthritis indicators on the bones. Arthritis will cause noticeable rounding of the bones. The degree of rounding from arthritis coupled with the size and number of osteons can help an anthropologist narrow down a potential age range for the individual.|$|E
5|$|The <b>aging</b> <b>of</b> {{high quality}} red wine {{required}} specialized knowledge {{as well as}} expensive storage and equipment, and resulted in an even more expensive end product. Judging from the advice given in many medieval documents on how to salvage wine that bore signs of going bad, preservation {{must have been a}} widespread problem. Even if vinegar was a common ingredient, there was only so much of it that could be used. In the 14th century cookbook Le Viandier there are several methods for salvaging spoiling wine; making sure that the wine barrels are always topped up or adding a mixture of dried and boiled white grape seeds with the ash of dried and burnt lees of white wine were both effective bactericides, even if the chemical processes were not understood at the time. Spiced or mulled wine was not only popular among the affluent, but was also considered especially healthy by physicians. Wine was believed to act as a kind of vaporizer and conduit of other foodstuffs to every part of the body, and the addition of fragrant and exotic spices would make it even more wholesome. Spiced wines were usually made by mixing an ordinary (red) wine with an assortment of spices such as ginger, cardamom, pepper, grains of paradise, nutmeg, cloves and sugar. These would be contained in small bags which were either steeped in wine or had liquid poured over them to produce hypocras and claré. By the 14th century, bagged spice mixes could be bought ready-made from spice merchants.|$|E

40|$|The {{risk for}} {{cardiovascular}} disease (CVD) is higher {{for individuals with}} a first-degree relative who developed premature CVD (with a threshold at age 55 years for a male or 65 years for a female). However, {{little is known about}} the effect that each unit increase or decrease of maternal or paternal <b>age</b> <b>of</b> onset of CVD has on offspring <b>age</b> <b>of</b> onset of CVD. We hypothesized that there is an association between maternal and paternal <b>age</b> <b>of</b> onset of CVD and offspring <b>age</b> <b>of</b> onset of CVD. We used the Framingham Heart Study database and performed conditional imputation for CVD-censored parental age (i. e. parents that didn't experience onset of CVD) and Cox proportional regression analysis, with offspring's <b>age</b> <b>of</b> onset of CVD as the dependent variable and parental <b>age</b> <b>of</b> onset of CVD as the primary predictor. Modifiable risk factors in offspring, such as cigarette smoking, body mass index (BMI), diabetes mellitus, systolic blood pressure (SBP), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) level, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) level, were controlled for. Separate analyses were performed for the association between maternal <b>age</b> <b>of</b> onset of CVD and offspring <b>age</b> <b>of</b> onset of CVD and the association between paternal <b>age</b> <b>of</b> onset of CVD and offspring <b>age</b> <b>of</b> onset <b>of</b> CVD. Parental <b>age</b> <b>of</b> onset of CVD was predictive <b>of</b> offspring <b>age</b> <b>of</b> onset of CVD for maternal <b>age</b> <b>of</b> onset of CVD (P <. 0001; N = 1401) and for paternal <b>age</b> <b>of</b> onset of CVD (P = 0. 0134; N = 1221). A negative estimate of the coefficient of interest signifies that late onset of cardiovascular events in parents is protective of onset of CVD in offspring. Cigarette smoking and HDL level were important associated confounders. Offspring <b>age</b> <b>of</b> onset of cardiovascular disease is significantly associated with both maternal and paternal <b>age</b> <b>of</b> onset CVD. The incorporation of the parameters, maternal or paternal <b>age</b> <b>of</b> onset of CVD, into risk estimate calculators may improve accuracy of identification of high-risk patients in clinical settings...|$|R
