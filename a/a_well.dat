Subsequently, several of the group would join the partisans for small scale attacks on German troops. The group survived until the entry of the Red Army in mid-January.|$|E

5|$|Jacobsen quotes textual {{evidence}} that the Akkadian word eššebu (owl) corresponds to the Sumerian word ninna, and that the Sumerian Dnin-ninna (Divine lady ninna) corresponds to the Akkadian Ishtar. The Sumerian ninna can also be translated as the Akkadian kilili, {{which is also a}} name or epithet for Ishtar. Inanna/Ishtar as harlot or goddess of harlots was <b>a</b> <b>well</b> known theme in Mesopotamian mythology and in one text, Inanna is called kar-kid (harlot) and ab-ba--šú, which in Akkadian would be rendered kilili. Thus {{there appears to be a}} cluster of metaphors linking prostitute and owl and the goddess Inanna/Ishtar; this could match the most enigmatic component of the relief to <b>a</b> <b>well</b> known aspect of Ishtar. Jacobsen concludes that this link would be sufficient to explain talons and wings, and adds that nudity could indicate the relief was originally the house-altar of a bordello.|$|E
