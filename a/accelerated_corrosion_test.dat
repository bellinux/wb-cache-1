50|$|The {{salt spray}} (or salt fog) test is a {{standardized}} and popular corrosion test method, used to check corrosion resistance {{of materials and}} surface coatings. Usually, the materials to be tested are metallic (although stone, ceramics, and polymers may also be tested) and finished with a surface coating which is intended to provide a degree of corrosion protection to the underlying metal. Salt spray testing is an <b>accelerated</b> <b>corrosion</b> <b>test</b> that produces a corrosive attack to coated samples in order to evaluate (mostly comparatively) the suitability of the coating {{for use as a}} protective finish. The appearance of corrosion products (rust or other oxides) is evaluated after a pre-determined period of time. Test duration depends on the corrosion resistance of the coating; generally, the more corrosion resistant the coating is, the longer the period of testing before the appearance of corrosion/ rust.The salt spray test {{is one of the most}} widespread and long established corrosion tests. ASTM B117 was the first internationally recognized salt spray standard, originally published in 1939. Other important relevant standards are ISO9227, JIS Z 2371 and ASTM G85.|$|E
50|$|Salt spray {{testing is}} popular {{because it is}} {{relatively}} inexpensive, quick, well standardized, and reasonably repeatable. Although {{there may be a}} weak correlation between the duration in salt spray test and the expected life of a coating in certain coatings such as hot dip galvanized steel, this test has gained worldwide popularity due to low cost and quick results. Most Salt Spray Chambers today are being used NOT to predict the corrosion resistance of a coating, but to maintain coating processes such as pre-treatment and painting, electroplating, galvanizing, and the like, on a comparative basis. For example, pre-treated + painted components must pass 96 hours Neutral Salt Spray, to be accepted for production. Failure to meet this requirement implies instability in the chemical process of the pre-treatment, or the paint quality, which must be addressed immediately, so that the upcoming batches are of the desired quality. The longer the <b>accelerated</b> <b>corrosion</b> <b>test,</b> the longer the process remains out of control, and larger is the loss in the form of non-conforming batches.The principle application of the salt spray test is therefore enabling quick comparisons to be made between actual and expected corrosion resistance. Most commonly, the time taken for oxides to appear on the samples under test is compared to expectations, to determine whether the test is passed or failed. For this reason the salt spray test is most often deployed in a quality audit role, where, for example, {{it can be used to}} check the effectiveness of a production process, such as the surface coating of a metallic part.The salt spray test has little application in predicting how materials or surface coatings will resist corrosion in the real-world, because it does not create, replicate or accelerate real-world corrosive conditions. Cyclic corrosion testing is better suited to this.|$|E

The reliability analysis incorporates deterioration models, spatial variability, random field analysis, rehabilitation strategies and life-cycle costing.

The study focuses on three alternative cementitious materials used with ordinary Portland cement: glass powder (GP) obtained from mix glass, alternative fly ash (AFA) obtained from the combustion of wastepaper deinking sludge and wood residues in a fluidized-bed reactor, and limestone filler (LF).

40|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} structures, {{especially those}} in marine environments, are commonly subjected to high concentrations of chlorides, which eventually leads to corrosion of the embedded reinforcing steel.
