40|$|In this study, we hypothesize {{and find}} that {{financial}} statement analysis of firm profitability drivers applied at the aggregate level yields timely insights that are relevant for forecasting real economic activity. We first show that focusing on the 100 largest firms offers a cost-effective way to extract information embedded in accounting profitability data of the entire stock market portfolio. We then show that <b>accounting</b> profitability data <b>aggregated</b> across the 100 largest firms have predictive content for subsequent real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth. We also show that stock market returns have predictive content for future real GDP growth, while their predictive power varies with {{the length of the}} measurement window with annual stock market returns being the most powerful. Importantly, we find that the predictive content of our indices of <b>aggregate</b> <b>accounting</b> profitability drivers is incremental to that of annual stock market returns. An in-depth investigation of consensus survey forecasts shows that professional macro forecasters revise their expectations of real economic activity {{in the direction of the}} predictive content of <b>aggregate</b> <b>accounting</b> profitability drivers and stock market returns. Although macro forecasters are fully attuned to stock market return data, their forecasts of real GDP growth can be improved in a statistically and economically significant way using our indices of <b>aggregate</b> <b>accounting</b> profitability drivers. Our findings suggest that professional macro forecasters and stock market investors do not fully impound the predictive content of <b>aggregate</b> <b>accounting</b> profitability drivers when forecasting real economic activity. In additional analysis, we examine the association between stock market returns and the portion of subsequent real GDP growth that is predictable based on our indices of <b>aggregate</b> <b>accounting</b> profitability drivers but that is not anticipated by stock market investors. We find that this portion is positively related to stock market returns, suggesting that the macro predictive content of <b>aggregate</b> <b>accounting</b> profitability drivers is relevant for stock valuation.

40|$|This paper quantifies the {{contributions}} to distributional changes observed in Pakistan {{over the last}} decade. In contrast to methods that focus on aggregate summary statistics, the method adopted in this paper generates entire counterfactual distributions to account for {{the contributions}} of demographics, labor and non-labor incomes in explaining poverty reduction. The results show that the most important contributor was the growth in income. Moreover, this growth in income seems to be driven by returns to individual and household endowments, pointing to productivity increases as the driving force behind poverty reduction. Lower dependency ratios, transfers and remittances also contributed to poverty reduction, albeit to a smaller extent. Growth in productivity, particularly between 2001 - 02 and 2005 - 06 is consistent with estimates from <b>aggregate</b> <b>accounts,</b> which points to productivity growth led by movements of labor force away from agriculture and into industry and services.

40|$|Cognitive science (CS), the {{language}} action perspective (LAP) and organizational semiotics (OS) {{can be seen}} as complementary perspectives. Several authors have successfully combined elements from these three perspectives. The aspect-phase model is an abstract model of financial control in government organizations. For an analysis of this model we select appropriate instruments from OS and LAP that are also useful in multi-actor simulations. After an explanation of the aspect-phase model, this is subjected to a first analysis. We learn from this analysis that distinguishing ontological knowledge, process knowledge and interaction knowledge is fruitful. A first analysis based on DEMO shows that aspect processes may run parallel while language actions cross over from one aspect to another and are connected sequentially. Furthermore, we see that the DEMO framework can bring structure in our analysis, and has the potential to reveal gaps in conversations. A first analysis in the field of organizational semiotics shows work unit states and work unit state transitions that are at the process level, and detail accounts (and <b>aggregate</b> <b>accounts)</b> that are at the ontological level. The existence of parallel processes might indicate entities at the ontological level. ...|$|E
40|$|We seek to {{understand}} how learning phenomena are produced by entanglements and alignments of the activities of multiple individuals in technologymediated environments. How do participants construct new understandings in an online environment? How do communities of interest and practice emerge and sustain themselves in shared virtual spaces? And how do designed environments influence these processes through their affordances? To answer such questions, {{it is necessary to}} trace out activity that is distributed across time and space and media, following the trajectories of people, the transformation and spread of ideas, and the movement of artifacts: these are three ontological perspectives on one phenomenon. Multiple analytic challenges are identified in this paper, including the distributed nature of the data, the contingent nature of human behavior, understanding nonverbal behavior, selective attention to large data sets, and multi-scale phenomena. As one part of our solution, we have developed mediaindependent representations of contingencies between mediated actions and of trajectories of participation that intersect on persistent objects. This paper describes the contingency graph representation, gives an example of its use in analyzing the development of shared representational practices, and discusses further challenges. Important questions remain concerning the extent to which interactional accounts can remain productive as we grapple with larger data sets and emergent phenomena, and whether a productive interplay between interactional and <b>aggregate</b> <b>accounts</b> are possible that together inform design...|$|E

40|$|The {{first part}} of the paper {{highlights}} the many and often perverse forms taken by the adjustment of State Owned Enterprises in Bulgaria since 1992. The differentiation into four clusters of unevenly performing State firms shows inter alia two important aspects in this process. First, a large number of heavily loss-making public enterprises has been allowed to survive since the beginning of transition {{at the expense of the}} rest of the economy, first of all the banks whose insolvency they contributed to while absorbing a large part of newly extended credits. However, as a rule, losses have been much financed more through informal or non-contractual means, mostly by the accumulation of interest and tax arrears, while in principle the impossibility of obtaining new external finance, or issuing equity after having lost all base capital should have made bankruptcy the only remaining solution. The second decisive aspect in the adjustment process is that more competitive, often profitable enterprises have also been accumulating large arrears towards other agents, with the banks again being the main victim. The implication is that arrears have been much larger than the mere financing of losses would have required, and have apparently been considered by a substantial number of enterprises as a current revenue flow rather than as a financing source. Indeed, SOEs as a whole have imposed informal revenue transfers to other agents averaging (on a conservative estimate), 28 % of their own value added per year between 1992 and 1995. The second part of the article analyses how the accumulation of enterprise arrears and of budget deficits, since 1992, has been absorbed without major financial disruptions. The evolution of the <b>aggregate</b> <b>accounts</b> for enterprises, government, households and the commercial banking sectors are then presented, so as to highlight three decisive factors in this exercise in crisis deferment. First, households have suffered large inflation taxes on their deposits, which have helped banks to rebalancing their balance sheets; second, despite these heavy wealth losses, private deposits in banks have kept increasing at sustained though declining rates till 1995, a trend which has limited the risk of an immediate liquidity crisis, notwithstanding the increasing insolvency of financial intermediaries; third, the State was able to post a large primary surplus in 1994 and 1995, which has also contributed to containing the financial tensions due to microeconomic indiscipline. However, the banking crisis has been gathering pace since the end of 1995 : a series of banks have been closed down and the Central bank has injected increasing amounts of reserve money in the banking sector, so as to reduce the risk of a systemic liquidity crisis and of a large-scale run on deposits. Large withdrawals were observed in April and May 1996, while a sharp foreign exchange crisis developed during the latter month, causing a total fall in the dollar value of the national currency of nearly 50 %. Hence, the major risk is that a sharp acceleration in inflation may increase the budget cash deficit (through the Tanzi effect) in the immediate future, leading possibly to high or even hyperinflation. Though such an issue would have very destructive immediate consequences, and would drastically reduce household wealth, it would also inflate away the largest part of the domestic public debt, as well as of the banks huge stock of non-performing loans. In the medium-term, this would provide the basis for re-establishing strong financial discipline on enterprises and banks, so as to set the Bulgarian transition on a more stable, promising course...|$|E
