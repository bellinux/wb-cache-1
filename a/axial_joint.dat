40|$|Psoriatic {{arthritis}} (PsA) is {{a systemic}} inflammatory disease characterized by possible peripheral and <b>axial</b> <b>joint</b> involvement, enthesitis, dactylitis, and skin and nail disease. It affects up to one-third of psoriatic patients, {{and may be}} associated with comorbidities such as cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. The usually prescribed initial treatment of moderate-severe PsA is methotrexate, which may be accompanied or replaced by a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor such as etanercept, infliximab, or adalimumab. However, some patients may become unresponsive (or have contraindications) to available anti-TNF agents and require alternative treatment.

40|$|Further {{development}} of an open loop control strategy for High Power Ultrasonic (HPU) devices requires investigation of the dynamic behaviour of its interfaces. These interfaces exist between components that are assembled through a screwed threaded <b>axial</b> <b>joint.</b> An unknown prestress permeates from this bearing surface due to {{the tension in the}} stud. It is well known that the vibration of bolted interfaces is highly nonlinear. It is assumed that the <b>axial</b> <b>joint</b> will not loosen {{to the extent that the}} entire contacting surfaces will slip. Therefore the characteristic behaviour of this interface descends from the microscopic motions, of asperities in and out of contact, as slipping occurs locally. A review of the literature suggests that this physical mechanism will contribute to second harmonics in the response of the jointed system. This complex constitutive behaviour is not amenable to dynamical modelling. Instead the Bouc-Wen (BW) model for hysteresis is adopted to capture the phenomenology. The force-displacement behaviour of the <b>axial</b> <b>joint</b> is required to identify the parameters to this model. Dynamic force behaviour of a component that is subjected to high power ultrasonic loading cannot be obtained directly through conventional measurement systems. Force estimation of a set of ultrasonic test assemblies is attempted through a hybrid analytical-experimental scheme. The test assemblies consist of a Commercial Piezoelectric Actuator (CPA) or an In-House Piezoelectric Actuator (IHPA) with a stepped ultrasonic horn attached. Stepped ultrasonic horns are produced with and without an additional <b>axial</b> <b>joint</b> that is set to three different tightnesses. These are named the Jointed Horns (JH) or the Monolithic Horn (MH) respectively. The model of an actuator with the MH attached is named the linear calibration model. This is formulated through a Distributed Transfer Function Method that describes waveguides, with discontinuous parameters, that behave according to Love Rod Theory. This is too limited to represent the behaviour of a piezoelectric rod, so the electromechanical nature of the piezoelectric actuator is not considered in detail. Instead the parameters of the model are updated based on results from Experimental Modal Analysis through the Genetic Algorithm. The force at the foremost point of the piezoelectric stack is deconvolved from the distributed parameter rod model. Stable solutions to the ill-posed inverse problem are achieved by means of the Truncated Singular Value Decomposition or Tikhonov regularisation schemes. Electrical impedance analysis of the piezoelectric actuators, with a JH attached, demonstrate that the introduction of the joint to an equivalent assembly, made with the MH attached, will significantly modify the impedance behaviour. Input forces are deconvolved from the linear calibration assembly when the output is the measured response of the IHPA with the MH attached. The response of the IHPA with the JH attached is then assumed as the output and the joint force is estimated for the input force that corresponds to the voltage that was applied for the JH test. This force will be out of phase with the true linear input force to the JH assembly. The responses of the test assemblies are measured at 2 or 3 locations through Laser Doppler Vibrometry (LDV). Simultaneous images of a portion of the ultrasonic horn are recorded through an ultra-high speed camera. Digital Image Correlation (DIC) is applied to estimate a displacement field that can be compared to a LDV measurement. Good agreement in phase is found, but there are significant errors in the amplitude. It is suggested that this is the result of projection error. The strain fields are obtained from the displacement field through bi-cubic interpolation. It is not possible to achieve comparable results through the force estimation scheme. The BW model of hysteresis is defined by four shape parameters that are not straightforwardly related to physical quantities. The influence of these parameters on the hysteresis loop, and the frequency response of the model, is demonstrated through a sensitivity analysis. This suggests that the model will fit to the softening overhang behaviour that was associated with the looseness of the <b>axial</b> <b>joint</b> in the literature. Two interpretations of identifying the model are discussed. Firstly the limit cycle is fitted to experimental data through a set of MATLAB functions that make use of analytical solutions to each branch of the loop. Secondly a minimisation is carried out between the output of the model and the measured response of the IHPA with a JH attached. This is achieved through Differential Evolution. It is not possible to identify a reliable model without an improved estimation of the input to the model. To make progress with this problem a number of contributions have been made. Simulations of the BW model have demonstrated that it is capable of describing the softening overhang behaviour that has been observed in the response of HPU devices and the subharmonic generation that descends from Contact Acoustic Nonlinearity. A methodical attempt to identify the parameters to this model from measurements of HPU test assemblies has been presented. A new force estimation scheme has been developed, which is based on a recent formulation of the Distributed Transfer Function Method. This provides a closed form route to estimating the force at an <b>axial</b> <b>joint</b> in a rod-like system. Regularisation methods have been applied to stabilise these estimations. An experimental configuration has been presented to test the force estimation scheme with observations from HPU test assemblies. These test assemblies have been analysed through electrical impedance analysis and Experimental Modal Analysis. This demonstrates changes in the behaviour of the assembly due to the introduction of the joint and its set tightness. Digital Image Correlation is presented as an alternative to finding the hysteresis behaviour at the <b>axial</b> <b>joint</b> which is subject to ultrasonic loading. Recommendations are made towards improving this set up...|$|E

Methods. Both instruments were administered to 72 consecutive patients with psoriatic arthritis. Results. Global HAQ and AIMS scores,were closely correlated with each other (r(s) = 0. 747; P< 0. 00001). AIMS physical function scales namely physical activity, dexterity, social activity and {{activities of daily living}} - were moderately or closely correlated with the main clinical disease activity parameters, most notably morning stiffness of <b>axial</b> <b>joints</b> (r(s) = 0. 271 - 0. 551). Scales measuring psychological status yielded weaker correlations with disease activity parameters (r(s) = 0. 241 - 0. 277) and were also correlated with the visual analog scale score for skin lesion severity. Morning stiffness of peripheral joints was correlated only with two AIMS scales, namely pain (r(s) = 0. 532) and activities of daily living (r(s) = 0. 303). Severity of radiological damage of peripheral and <b>axial</b> <b>joints</b> was most closely correlated with the scales of physical function, most notably physical activity.

Not only do muscles contribute to the knee joint forces by acting to compress the joint, but they also develop joint forces indirectly through {{their contributions to the}} ground reaction forces via dynamic coupling. Thus, muscles can have significant contributions to forces at joints they do not span. However, few studies have investigated how the major lower-limb muscles contribute to the knee joint contact forces during walking. The goal {{of this study was to}} use a muscle-actuated forward dynamics simulation of walking to identify how individual muscles contribute to the axial tibio-femoral joint force.

The tibio-femoral joint force generated by these muscles was at times greater than the muscle forces themselves. Muscles that do not cross the knee joint (e. g., the gluteus maximus and soleus) also have significant contributions to the tibio-femoral joint force through their contributions to the ground reaction forces. Further, small changes in walking kinematics (e. g., knee flexion angle) can have a significant effect on the magnitude of the knee joint forces. Thus, altering walking mechanics and muscle coordination patterns to utilize muscle groups that perform the same biomechanical function, yet contribute less to the knee joint forces may be an effective way to reduce knee joint loading during walking...|$|E

The aim {{of the present study}} was to describe the clinical, radiologic, and genetic features of patients with undifferentiated spondyloarthritis (uSpA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Patients and methods This study included 225 SpA patients (134 uSpA and 91 AS) attending our Rheumatology Outpatient Clinic consecutively. Patients underwent peripheral and <b>axial</b> <b>joint</b> and enthesitis assessment, erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein determination, HLA-B 27 tissue typing, radiographic evaluation, and sacroiliac MRI. Results In total, 26 of 91 AS patients and 115 of 134 uSpA patients were women (28. 6 vs. 85. 8 %) and 65 of AS and 19 of uSpA were men (71. 4 vs. 14. 2 %). The time for diagnosis was 15. 82 ± 20. 7 months for AS patients and 5. 91 ± 3. 63 months for uSpA patients. Diagnostic delay was 102. 46 ± 88. 99 (median 83, range 8 - 377) months for AS and 74. 23 ± 60. 7 (median 55. 5, range 0 - 238) months for uSpA patients. HLA-B 27 positivity was present in 51. 6 % of AS and 14. 9 % of uSpA patients. The mean BASDAI level of patients with AS was 6. 4 ± 1. 1 and that of uSpA patients was 4. 8 ± 2. 1. Conclusion SpA are frequent diseases and physicians other than rheumatologists should also be aware of them. uSpA is more frequent in women than men. Early diagnosis of SpA is important because early treatment with new biological therapies may lead to much better Results than applying them in the advanced stages...|$|E

DeBakey Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Houston, TX, USA Background: Joint {{complaints}} such as spondyloarthritis and peripheral arthritis are {{the most}} common extraintestinal manifestations in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); however, the evaluation of these symptoms are poorly described. Objectives: To examine the clinical characteristics and prevalence of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and other joint complaints among patients with IBD. Methods: In a local cohort of patients diagnosed with IBD between 1996 and 2009, we performed a retrospective study at the Veterans Affairs Hospital. Patients with IBD were identified by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes and confirmed by chart review. The occurrence of AS, peripheral arthritis, and other peripheral and <b>axial</b> <b>joint</b> symptoms were identified. Results: We identified 626 patients with IBD between ages 18 and 90 (90 % males), of whom 57 % had ulcerative colitis (UC), 74 % were Caucasians, and the mean age at diagnosis was 54 (± 16) years. Among the study population, 108 patients (17 %) had at least one type of joint pain. Among these 17 % with joint pain, 12 % had AS, 43 % had peripheral arthritis, 32 % had chronic back pain without AS, and 13 % had other types of joint pain. The overall prevalence of peripheral arthritis among patients with IBD was three times higher than that of AS (7 % vs 2. 1 %, respectively, OR 3. 5; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 9 – 6. 5; p= 0. 001). There was no difference in the prevalence of AS or peripheral arthritis between patients with Crohn’s disease and UC. The initial diagnosis of AS occurred after the initial diagnosis of IBD in 80 % of patients within a mean (SD) period of 5. 6 (± 6) years. Conclusion: Spondyloarthritis among patients with IBD is usually diagnosed after the initial diagnosis of IBD. No difference in the prevalence of AS or peripheral arthritis was observed by IBD type, age, or race. Recognition and understanding of these results will have important implications for the management of IBD patients with spondyloarthritis.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the performance of}} jointed pipelines subject to ground deformations triggered at a large scale by earthquakes and a construction-related scale by tunneling. Understanding and quantifying jointed pipeline response at these scales allows for better design, operational management, and risk assessment of underground infrastructure, where cast iron (CI) and ductile iron (DI) pipelines in the U. S. account for approximately 75 % of water distribution systems. The thesis covers the response of DI and molecularly oriented polyvinyl chloride (PVCO) pipelines to earthquaketriggered soil movement as well as CI and DI pipeline response to tunneling. A series of specially designed four-point bending experiments and 3 D finite-element (FE) simulations were performed to characterize DI push-on joints commonly used in water distribution systems to develop {{a relationship between the}} rotation and axial pullout at both metal binding and first leakage. The results of uniaxial tension and onedimensional compression tests on the elastomeric gaskets in DI push-on joints were implemented in numerical models that show joint leakage to be independent of load path, with a unique pressure boundary that predicts leakage for many combinations of axial pullout and rotation. The increased circumferential strength, reduced pipe wall thickness, and enhanced cross-sectional flexibility of PVCO pipelines was evaluated through the characterization of PVCO material properties, <b>axial</b> <b>joint</b> tension and compression tests, four-point bending tests, and a full-scale fault rupture experiment. A nominal 150 -mm (6 -in.) diameter PVCO pipeline is able to accommodate significant fault movement through axial tensile and bending strains in the pipe in combination with modest levels of axial slip at the restrained joints. Relatively large levels of axial strain in the low modulus PVCO material, which varies between 1 % and 2 % at pipeline failure, are able to sustain substantial extension and compression from ground movements. Soil/pipeline interaction modeling was performed for vertical and horizontal ground movements caused by tunneling in jointed CI and DI pipelines perpendicular to the tunnel centerline that (1) extend beyond the width of the settlement profile and (2) connect through 90 ° tees with a pipeline parallel to the tunnel. The modeling incorporates the results of large-scale laboratory tests. Guidance is provided for design and the identification before tunneling of potential difficulties. In particular, CI tees are at high risk when subject to tunneling induced soil movement, whereas DI pipelines and tees have sufficient capacity to accommodate high levels of tunneling related ground deformation. i...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{determine}} (a) {{the influence}} of HIV in developing osteoarticular infections in intravenous drug abusers (IVDAs) and (b) {{the differences between the}} clinical features of osteoarticular infections in IVDAs and a control group of non-IVDAs. METHODS [...] A comparative study of the clinical features of osteoarticular infections in all HIV positive and HIV negative IVDAs admitted to the departments of rheumatology and internal medicine during a 10 year period was carried out. The joint infections of all IVDAs, irrespective of HIV status, were compared with those of a control group of non-IVDAs lacking risk factors for HIV infection. RESULTS [...] A total of 482 HIV positive and 85 HIV negative IVDAs was studied, in whom 25 (5 %) and six (7 %) osteoarticular infections were found respectively. There were no differences in age, sex, joints affected, and causative agents between these two groups. A comparison of the 31 (5. 5 %) osteoarticular infections in all IVDAs with 21 infections in 616 (3. 4 %) non-IVDAs showed significant differences in the mean age (27. 5 v 54), the frequency of affection of the <b>axial</b> <b>joints</b> (hip, sacroiliac, and sternocostal joints) (64. 5 % v 16. 6 %), and in the incidence of Candida albicans (19 % v 0 %). CONCLUSIONS [...] (1) HIV may not predispose to osteoarticular infections in IVDAs. (2) The hip, sacroiliac, and sternocostal <b>joints</b> (<b>axial</b> <b>joints)</b> were most commonly affected in IVDAs. (3) In Spain, unlike other countries, Gram positive bacteria and C albicans seem to be predominant agents in osteoarticular infections in IVDAs, with a low incidence of Gram negative bacteria...|$|R
