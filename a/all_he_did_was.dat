25|$|The second limb {{of section}} 6(2) was {{examined}} by District Judge Neighbour in Ong Kian Cheong. The {{issue in the}} case was whether the accused persons had knowledge or {{reason to believe that}} the publications possessed seditious tendencies. The first accused claimed he did not read the tracts and thus did not know that they had seditious tendencies. He alleged that <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> to post the tracts after the second accused had prepared them. The second accused claimed that she had purchased and distributed the tracts without reading them and had no reason to believe the publications were seditious or objectionable because they were freely available on sale in local bookstores.|$|E
25|$|Louis Caput {{approached}} Edmond Mercier, the bicycle-maker behind Poulidor's team, {{and asked}} to bring Sainz into the team management. Mercier agreed, said Sainz, because he was already treating Mercier for his own health problems. Mercier had also brought in the insurance company, GAN, as main sponsor. GAN, said Sainz, demanded that Poulidor be in the team photo even if <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> train with the team {{at the start of}} the season. In 1971 Poulidor had decided against riding any more. The tactic, Sainz said, was bluff, to increase his motivation. In Paris–Nice, the first important stage race of the season, Poulidor was 22 seconds behind Eddy Merckx on the morning of the last day. Poulidor attacked from the start, setting a speed record on the Col de la Turbie that stood for more than 10 years and won Paris–Nice by two seconds. Next year he won Paris–Nice again and also the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré.|$|E
500|$|Toward {{the end of}} his life, Miller wrote another {{installment}} of the Abbey of Saint Leibowitz saga, Saint Leibowitz and the Wild Horse Woman. A full-length novel (455 pages) significantly longer than its predecessor, it is set in AD 3254, eighty years after the events of [...] "Fiat Lux" [...] but several centuries before [...] "Fiat Voluntas Tua". Suffering from writer's block and fearful the new work would go unfinished, Miller arranged with author Terry Bisson to complete it. According to Bisson, <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> go in and tie up the loose ends Miller had left. The novel tells the story of Brother Blacktooth St. George of the Leibowitzan abbey who, unlike Brother Francis, wants to be released from his holy vows and leave the abbey. In addition to recounting his travels as Cardinal Brownpony's personal secretary, the book describes the political situation in the 33rdcentury as Church and empire (Texark) vie for power. Miller died before the novel's publication.|$|E

500|$|Kohli {{and other}} senior players were rested for India's tour of Bangladesh {{ahead of the}} England tour. India conceded a 3–1 defeat in the five-match Test series against England despite leading it 1–0 after the first two Tests. Kohli fared poorly in the series {{averaging}} just 13.40 in 10 innings with a top score of 39. He was dismissed for single-digit scores on six occasions in the series and was particularly susceptible to the swinging ball on off stump line, being dismissed several times edging {{the ball to the}} wicket-keeper or slip fielders. Man of the series James Anderson got Kohli's wicket four times, while Kohli's batting technique was questioned by analysts and former cricketers. Geoffrey Boycott said, [...] "Jimmy Anderson ate him for breakfast. Every time Kohli came in, <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> bowl at off stump, around the corridor of uncertainty and Kohli nicked it. He is playing with his bat too far away from his pad. He has to look at video replays of his technique and get back to basics". India won the ODI series that followed 3–1, but Kohli's struggles with the bat continued with an average of 18 in four innings. In the one-off T20I, he scored 41-ball 66, his first fifty-plus score of the tour on the last match of the tour. India lost the match by three runs, but Kohli reached the number one spot for T20I batsmen in the ICC rankings.|$|E
2500|$|A {{descendant}} of abolitionist and writer Harriet Beecher Stowe, Cornwell {{was born on}} June 9, 1956 in Miami, Florida, second of three children, to Marilyn (née Zenner) and Sam Daniels. Her father {{was one of the}} leading appellate lawyers in the United States and served as a law clerk to Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black. Cornwell later traced her own motivations in life to the emotional abuse she says she suffered from her father, who walked out on the family on Christmas Day 1961. She has said, [...] "He was on his deathbed. We knew {{it was the last time}} we were seeing each other; he grabbed my brother's hand and mouthed 'I love you,' but he never touched me. <b>All</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> write on a legal pad 'How's work?'" ...|$|E
2500|$|At Christmas in 1956, Townes's {{father gave}} him a guitar, which he practiced while {{wandering}} the countryside.

I just thought that Elvis had {{all the money in the}} world, all the Cadillacs and all the girls, and <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> play the guitar and sing. That made a big impression on me." [...] In 1958 the family moved to Boulder, Colorado. Van Zandt would remember his time in Colorado fondly and would often visit it as an adult. He would later refer to Colorado in [...] "My Proud Mountains", [...] "Colorado Girl", and [...] "Snowin' On Raton". Townes was a good student and active in team sports. In grade school, he received a high IQ score and his parents began grooming him to become a lawyer or senator. Fearing that his family would move again, he willingly decided to attend the Shattuck School, Faribault, Minnesota. He received a score of 1170 when he took the SAT in January 1962. His family soon moved to Houston, Texas.|$|E

2500|$|Jasikevičius's father Linas {{always was}} a sports lover {{and along with}} him, he {{followed}} practically everything, together they cheered for USSR national teams or any athlete who had USSR written across his or her chest. Not surprisingly, his dad {{took him to the}} first basketball workout when he was 6 years old. His first coach was Feliksas Mitkevičius in Kaunas basketball school, who was strict and not once was chasing Šarūnas when he was trying to run away from the workouts. According to Mitkevičius, when Šarūnas was 12 years old, he was so sick of basketball that he wished to drop it. He visited his parents, outlined the situation and stated {{that it would be a}} huge loss to Lithuania. Following it, his dad had a strong conversation with Šarūnas and forbade to drop basketball, which he wished to replace with tennis. In Kaunas basketball school he met with the future NBA star Žydrūnas Ilgauskas with which he was meeting practically every day, at school, in the gym or elsewhere for the next eleven years. Tomas Masiulis was another notable player in his team. Jasikevičius remembers that at first he was seen as the guy who was [...] "talented but lazy" [...] as he was no devotee of the gym; <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> joke around and try to work as little as possible. Consequently, once his dad stopped him from going on a trip to Minsk with the team, a trip of kind which happens only once a year, as his marks were disastrous and it was a punishment: [...] "No school? So no basketball". Though, his parents were happy to see him venting his hyperactivity in basketball, and this made them urge him on towards the sport, as it also helped him avoid bad company in the area. They played in the gym, and also in the street using scrap metal instead of real baskets, and their favorite pastime was called minus, a kind of forerunner of little game that can be seen today during the NBA All-Star Game called [...] "horse". It was far from ideal, but his parents preferred to see him play with the scrap metal hoops in front of their home rather than down at the pitch, where it would have taken him less than five minutes to pick a fight with the wrong person. His childhood dream was to become a Žalgiris Kaunas player about which he was so crazy that he knew everything about every player, even the players’ shoe sizes. Following the Žalgiris' victory in 1986 Intercontinental Cup, he begged his father to take him to the airport to welcome home the players, where hundreds of people were waiting in the freezing cold. His father knew some of the players, and managed to get signed posters and photos that he used to decorate all the walls of his room.|$|E
