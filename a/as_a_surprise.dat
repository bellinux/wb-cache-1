5|$|According to plan, the Syrians {{attacked}} {{from the}} southern Golan Heights, {{just south of the}} Sea of Galilee through al-Hama and the Yarmouk River, hitting a densely populated Jewish area of settlement. This came <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> to the Haganah, which expected an attack from south Lebanon and Mishmar HaYarden. The Jewish villages on the original confrontation line were Ein Gev, Masada, Sha'ar HaGolan and both Deganias.|$|E
5|$|Egypt in 2015 {{reportedly}} {{expressed an}} interest again in the JF-17 despite buying French and Russian planes earlier that year. This has come <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> to analysts who had considered the possibility of Egypt acquiring the JF-17 to be lost.|$|E
5|$|Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swann: Governor Swann's {{daughter}} and Will's love interest; Swann is {{taken by the}} pirate crew of the Black Pearl. Knightley came <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> to Verbinski; {{he had not seen}} her performance in Bend It Like Beckham and was impressed by her audition.|$|E

5|$|The Orange Box {{received}} critical acclaim, with Portal {{being recognized}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> {{favorite of the}} package. The PlayStation 3 version of The Orange Box was noted for several technical shortcomings that were not present in the other versions, {{only a few of}} which were fixed through a single patch.|$|E
5|$|At the 2008 San Diego Comic-Con, a {{preliminary}} teaser trailer (labeled as TR2N {{and directed by}} Joseph Kosinski) was shown <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> to convention guests. It depicted a yellow Program engaged in a light cycle battle with a blue Program, and it prominently featured Jeff Bridges reprising his role as an aged Kevin Flynn (from the first film). At {{the end of the}} trailer, the yellow Program showed his face, which appeared identical to Flynn's earlier program Clu (resembling the younger Flynn in Tron).|$|E
5|$|Further {{attacks were}} {{conducted}} against Saipan during late November {{in an attempt}} to disrupt the American offensive. On November24, Marianas-based B-29s conducted their first raid against Japan, bombing targets in and around Tokyo. Three days later the Japanese mounted two raids against their bases. During the early hours of November27, two G4Ms flying from Iwo Jima struck Isley Field from low altitude and escaped after destroying one B-29 and damaging eleven others. This attack came <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> to the Americans, and construction lights were still on at Isley {{at the start of the}} raid.|$|E

5|$|In the end, the Russian {{declaration}} of war came <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> to both Carol and Kogălniceanu, {{who had not been}} informed of the exact date (April 23) when the Imperial Russian Army would start moving into Moldavia—hence, Romanians tended to regard it as an invasion. Also alarming for Kogălniceanu, the official Russian proclamation addressed Romanians as protegés of the Empire. Bilateral tensions were somewhat alleviated by Russian apologies and, later, by the Ottoman pledge to annex Romania; addressing a discontented Parliament, Kogălniceanu asserted that the Russian road was the country's only choice.|$|E
5|$|Pre-election public-opinion polls {{had promised}} victory to the communists. Thus the total {{defeat of the}} PZPR and its {{satellite}} parties came <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> to all involved: {{after the first round}} of elections, it became evident that Solidarity had fared extremely well, capturing 160 of 161 contested Sejm seats, and 92 of 100 Senate seats. After the second round, it had won virtually every seat—all 161 in the Sejm, and 99 in the Senate.|$|E
5|$|Scalia took a broad {{view of the}} Eleventh Amendment, which bars certain {{lawsuits}} against states in the federal courts. In his 1989 dissent in Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., Scalia stated {{that there was no}} intent {{on the part of the}} framers to have the states surrender any sovereign immunity and that the case that provoked the Eleventh Amendment, Chisholm v. Georgia, came <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> to them. Professor Ralph Rossum, who wrote a survey of Scalia's constitutional views, suggests that the justice's view of the Eleventh Amendment was actually contradictory to the language of the Amendment.|$|E

5|$|The Brazilian {{government}} {{refused to}} yield, and Christie issued orders for British warships to capture Brazilian merchant vessels as indemnity. Brazil {{prepared for what}} {{was seen as an}} imminent conflict. PedroII was the main reason for Brazil's resistance; he rejected any suggestion of yielding. This response came <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> to Christie, who changed his tenor and proposed a peaceful settlement through international arbitration. The Brazilian government presented its demands and, upon seeing the British government's position weaken, severed diplomatic ties with Britain in June 1863.|$|E
5|$|The McLaughlin Planetarium {{was closed}} on November 5, 1995. The {{president}} of the ROM stated that {{the closure of the}} planetarium was due to a combination of falling attendance and a declining interest in space, and that the closure was necessitated by provincial budget cuts. The decision came <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> to many, as attendance had rebounded in recent years, and the planetarium was one of few in North America at the time that was turning a profit. The closure meant that 40 people lost their jobs.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} not commercially acclaimed, which came <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> to Sire {{since they had}} insisted the band record with Gouldman {{in an effort to}} {{increase}} fan-base; it peaked at number fifty-eight on the Billboard 200 and only charted outside of the US in Sweden. The album was not critically acclaimed either, as it received several mixed articles by reviewers, who insisted the album to be less playable than their first four albums.|$|E

5|$|The violin concerto {{stands out}} from {{previous}} concertos with its connected movements. There is no break {{between the first}} and second movements, with a bassoon note held between the two. The bridging passage between the last two movements begins almost immediately after the slow movement. The melody is similar to that of the opening, which hints at the cyclic form of the piece. The linking was designed to eliminate applause between movements. This would have come <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> to Mendelssohn's audience, who, unlike today's, were used to applauding between movements.|$|E
5|$|This outcome came also <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> {{to most of}} the Targowica Confederates, who had wished only {{to restore}} the status quo ante bellum (Commonwealth magnate-favoring Golden Freedoms) and had {{expected}} that the overthrow of the 3 May Constitution would achieve that end, and nothing more. The last bid to restore the reformed Commonwealth came with the Kościuszko Uprising in 1794. The uprising failed and resulted in the Third Partition in 1795, in which the country lost all its remaining territories and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth ceased to exist.|$|E
5|$|Ballard was {{selected}} in the first round, 11th overall, by the Buffalo Sabres in the 2002 NHL Entry Draft. The choice was seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> by draft observers, as he was projected to be a late first-round to second-round pick. Ballard himself professed the early selection to be unexpected, saying {{he was ready to}} be drafted between the 20th and 40th positions. Scouting reports listed him as a puck-rushing offensive defenseman with comparisons to Phil Housley. Before making his NHL debut, he was traded twice. He was initially dealt by Buffalo to the Colorado Avalanche on July 3, 2003, for Steven Reinprecht. The following year, he was traded again to the Phoenix Coyotes, along with defenseman Derek Morris, for forward Chris Gratton, defenseman Ossi Väänänen and a second-round selection in the 2005 draft.|$|E

5|$|Banks {{was given}} his first team debut by manager Doug Livingstone, {{at the expense}} of long-serving Ron Powell, in a Third Division game against Colchester United at Saltergate in November 1958. The game ended 2–2, and Banks kept his place against Norwich City in the {{following}} match; {{by the end of the}} 1958–59 season he had missed only three games, those owing to injury. With no goalkeeping coaching to speak of, Banks had to learn from his mistakes on the pitch, and he soon developed into a modern vocal goalkeeper who ordered the players in front of him into a more effective defence. Having just 23 league and three cup appearances to his name, it came <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> to Banks when Matt Gillies, manager of First Division club Leicester City, bought him from Chesterfield for £7,000 in July 1959; this also meant a wage increase to £15 a week.|$|E
5|$|Edge {{returned}} from injury at the Royal Rumble <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> entrant in the Royal Rumble match, which he won, earning a guaranteed match for any WWE world championship. Following Jericho's {{victory in the}} Elimination Chamber, in which he won the World Heavyweight Championship, Edge speared him the following night on Raw and {{announced that he had}} elected to face Jericho at WrestleMania. Following this announcement, Edge began a campaign of surprise attacks on Jericho, spearing him on several occasions in an attempt to play mind games with Jericho. On the March 12 episode of SmackDown, Jericho hosted a special edition of his talk show segment, The Highlight Reel, with Edge as the guest. Edge attempted to spear Jericho again, but Jericho was able to avoid it and hit Edge with the World Heavyweight Championship belt instead.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his fifth}} Stanley Cup win, with Toronto, the New York Rangers claimed Olmstead in the Intra-League Draft on June 4, 1962. This came <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> to Olmstead, {{who refused to}} report to the team. The Canadiens offered to acquire him from the Rangers, within a month; Olmstead demanded an {{immediate}} trade. Since no deal came, he retired at the age of 35. During his 14-year NHL career, Olmstead scored 181goals and 421assists, for 602points; in the playoffs, he collected 59points, in 115games. In his 14seasons, Olmstead appeared in the Stanley Cup final 11times. He won five times, four of them with the Montreal Canadiens, and once with the Toronto Maple Leafs.|$|E
