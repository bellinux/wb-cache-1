25|$|Some historians posit {{that a new}} era of the {{gay rights}} {{movement}} began in the 1980s with the emergence of AIDS, which decimated the leadership and shifted the focus for many. This era saw a resurgence of militancy with direct action groups like AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP), formed in 1987, as well as its offshoots Queer Nation (1990) and the Lesbian Avengers (1992). Some younger activists, seeing gay and lesbian as increasingly normative and politically conservative, began using queer as a defiant statement of all sexual minorities and gender variant people—just as the earlier liberationists had done with gay. Less confrontational terms that attempt to reunite the interests of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people also became prominent, including various acronyms like LGBT, LGBTQ, and LGBTI, where the Q <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>stand</b> for queer or questioning and intersex, respectively.|$|E
500|$|Protests were {{scheduled}} for the film's Italian premiere in Viareggio, Italy, by unspecified organizations. The protesters objected to the plotline of a Partisan collaborating with the Nazis. This runs directly counter to the accepted historical version of events, ruled by an Italian military court in 2005, that the Sant'Anna di Stazzema massacre was entirely premeditated by the Germans with no reason except the aim to frighten the population.

However, Lee, unrepentant, stated [...] "I am not apologizing." [...] He told Italians there was [...] "a lot about your history you have yet {{to come to grips}} with. This film is our interpretation, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>stand</b> behind it." [...] McBride, the novel's author, stated: [...] "As a black American, I understand what it's like for someone to tell your history... unfortunately, the history of World War Two here in Italy is ours as well, and this was the best I could do... it is, after all, a work of fiction.” ...|$|E
500|$|Wilson {{increasingly}} {{expanded his}} social circle {{to include a}} mix of worldly-minded friends, musicians, mystics, and business advisers. Smile was the album projected to follow Pet Sounds. This time, Wilson worked with Van Dyke Parks, whose surreal and oblique lyrics led Love to adopt the term [...] "acid alliteration" [...] when describing them. Love says that he [...] "wasn't resistant to ... I mean, crazy stupid sounds, like animals, farmyard sounds, did all that shit, laying {{in the bottom of}} an empty pool, singing up at the mic. I did all that stuff. ... I admit to wanting to make a commercially successful pop record, so I might have complained about some of the lyrics on Smile." [...] Capitol was not interested in Wilson's newest ideas for forthcoming projects, such as an album of found sounds, which led to the Beach Boys' desire to form their own label, Brother Records. According to biographer Steven Gaines, Love was [...] "the most receptive" [...] to the idea, wanting the Beach Boys to have more creative control over their work, and supported Wilson's decision to employ his newfound [...] "best friend" [...] David Anderle {{as the head of the}} label—despite the wishes of band manager Nick Grillo. By December 1966, Wilson [...] completed much of the album's backing tracks. When the Beach Boys returned from a month-long tour of Europe, they were confused by the new coterie of interlopers that surrounded him. As Gaines writes, Anderle now appeared as the leader of [...] "a whole group of strangers [...] had infiltrated and taken over the Beach Boys." [...] Anderle had been encouraging Wilson to leave the group, and he was [...] "sure they saw me as somebody ... who was fueling Brian's weirdness. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>stand</b> guilty on those counts." ...|$|E

2500|$|When Edwards was {{questioned}} at a New Orleans event on July 23, 2008, he stated, [...] "I {{have no idea}} what you're asking about.

It can be simply about telling the truth." [...] In an interview with Time magazine, Bigelow said: [...] "I'm proud of the movie, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>stand</b> behind it completely. I think that it's a deeply moral movie that questions the use of force. It questions what {{was done in the}} name of finding bin Laden." [...] In a 2013 interview on The Colbert Report, Bigelow said the film showed many techniques of intelligence gathering used to find bin Laden, such as electronic surveillance, troops at the ground level, and [...] "good, old-fashioned, boots-on-the-ground sleuthing".|$|E
