5|$|Robin Raphel {{began her}} career in the U.S. {{government}} as <b>an</b> <b>analyst</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> CIA after graduating with her master's degree. After leaving Iran she joined the diplomatic corps and assisted USAID in Islamabad as an economics analyst. In 1978, Raphel returned to the United States and joined the State Department. She would take {{on a range of}} assignments for the next decade, including posts in London, until she was appointed as Political Counselor at the U.S. Embassy in Pretoria, South Africa in 1988. In 1991, she took the assignment of Political Counselor at the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi, India.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} season, Parrish, {{who appears to}} have been fired from the FBI, is working a desk job as <b>an</b> <b>analyst</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> CIA while living with Shelby and {{continuing}} her relationship with Ryan, who later becomes her fiancé. Flashbacks reveal that she is working undercover for the FBI as a CIA recruit. She is tasked with uncovering a rogue faction of the CIA called the AIC. At The Farm, she is joined with other recruits, including Harry Doyle (Russell Tovey), Dayana Mampasi (Pearl Thusi), Sebastian Chen (David Lim), León Velez (Aarón Díaz), Leigh Davis (Heléne Yorke), and Jeremy Miller (David Call). Ryan later joins the other recruits at the site, much to Alex's surprise. Some time after her recruitment, Alex has a meeting with Matthew Keyes and Miranda Shaw. It is revealed that she was recruited by the CIA as part of a covert mission to establish any potential threats within the agency. Ryan is also recruited by the agency for the same mission. Owen Hall (Blair Underwood) is confirmed to be the primary CIA instructor for the training site at TheFarm. In addition, Lydia Hall (Tracy Ifeachor) is later revealed to be another trainer on-site. Alex and the other recruits undergo a series of training assessments in order to become future case officers. After being kicked out of TheFarm by Lydia, Alex goes back to working as an analyst. In addition, she breaks off her engagement with Ryan some time before the 2018 G-20 hostage crisis in New York.|$|E

25|$|John Pike, <b>an</b> <b>analyst</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{think tank}} GlobalSecurity, says he {{believes}} the weapon is roughly as powerful as the Russians claim.

25|$|Foreign aid to {{the region}} is a {{difficult}} proposition, according to Craig Cohen, <b>an</b> <b>analyst</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C. Since security is difficult, local nongovernmental organizations are required to distribute aid, {{but there is a}} lack of trust amongst NGOs and other powers that hampers distribution. Pakistani NGOs are often targets of violent attacks by Islamist militants in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. Due to the extensive hostility to any hint of foreign influence, the American branch of Save the Children was distributing funding anonymously in the region as of July 2007.|$|E
25|$|During his {{economics}} {{studies at}} New York University, Greenspan worked under Eugene Banks, {{a managing director}} at the Wall Street investment bank Brown Brothers Harriman, in the firm's equity research department. From 1948 to 1953, Greenspan worked as <b>an</b> <b>analyst</b> <b>at</b> <b>The</b> National Industrial Conference Board (currently known as The Conference Board), a business- and industry-oriented think tank in New York City. From 1955 to 1987, when he was appointed chairman of the Federal Reserve, Greenspan was chairman and president of Townsend-Greenspan & Co., Inc., an economics consulting firm in New York City, a 32-year stint interrupted only from 1974 to 1977 by his service as Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Gerald Ford.|$|E

25|$|In August 1995, the Secretary of the Navy {{authorized}} the Marine Corps to upgrade its utility and attack helicopters {{as a bridge}} until the Joint Replacement Aircraft was available in 2020. In 1996, the Marine Corps launched the H-1 upgrade program by signing a contract with Bell for upgrading 180 AH-1Ws into AH-1Zs and upgrading 100 UH-1Ns into UH-1Ys. While the original contract called for upgrading existing airframes, it was later modified in 2008 to manufacture completely new aircraft. The program also includes aircraft simulators. Richard Aboulafia, <b>an</b> <b>analyst</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Teal Group, suggests that the motivation to upgrade the H-1s instead of buying new Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk and Boeing AH-64 Apache helicopters was to avoid risk to the Bell-Boeing V-22 Osprey program.|$|E
500|$|The European Union and the United States as well {{as other}} western {{countries}} remain critical of the Eurasian Economic Union, with analysts stating that without modernisation and real economic reforms, the union will have little impact. The popular magazine The Economist stated that the advantages of joining the union remain unclear and further remarked [...] "The agreement was vague, with technical details left unresolved, making it a political show rather than an economic one". Outlets have also stated that without Ukraine, the Eurasian Economic Union has lost a key member state necessary {{to the success of the}} union. Bloomberg's business magazine, Businessweek has affirmed that joining Putin's Eurasian Union looks like a bad deal, including for Russia. The union [...] "won't really register on the radar of the global economy," [...] said <b>an</b> <b>analyst</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> EU's Institute for Security Studies in Paris.|$|E
2500|$|Hassan Hassan, <b>an</b> <b>analyst</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Delma Institute, {{wrote in}} The Guardian {{that because the}} Islamic State [...] "bases its teachings on {{religious}} texts that mainstream Muslim clerics {{do not want to}} deal with head on, new recruits leave the camp feeling that they have stumbled on the true message of Islam". In mid-February 2015, Graeme Wood, a lecturer in political science at Yale University, said in The Atlantic, [...] "The religion preached by its most ardent followers derives from coherent and even learned interpretations of Islam." ...|$|E

2500|$|The US position, as {{presented}} to the UN General Assembly {{a month before the}} incident by President George W. Bush, was that sovereign states have [...] "an obligation to govern responsibly, and solve problems before they spill across borders. We have an obligation to prevent our territory from being used as a sanctuary for terrorism and proliferation and human trafficking and organized crime." [...] Anthony Cordesman, <b>an</b> <b>analyst</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> US Center for Strategic and International Studies, said about the raid that, [...] "When you are dealing with states that do not maintain their sovereignty and become a de facto sanctuary, the only way {{you have to deal with}} them is this kind of operation." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 1 December The Daily Telegraph ran a {{front page}} {{headline}} suggesting that Saudi Arabia {{had given the}} UK ten days to suspend the Serious Fraud Office investigation into BAE/Saudi Arabian transactions or they would take the deal to France, but this threat was played down in other quarters. [...] A French official had said [...] "the situation was complex and difficult... {{and there was no}} indication to suggest the Saudis planned to drop the Eurofighter." [...] This analysis was confirmed by Andrew Brookes, <b>an</b> <b>analyst</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> International Institute for Strategic Studies, who said [...] "there could be an element here of trying to scare the SFO off. Will it mean they do not buy the Eurofighter? I doubt it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hurt {{campaigned on}} his {{opposition}} to the Democratic-backed initiatives that Perriello supported, such as health-care reform, the economic stimulus package and clean energy legislation. On August 20, Hurt released his first television ad. Hurt's first television ad stated that he would fight tax increases, stop Washington’s spending and start creating jobs, however he never mentions his opponent. [...] "You definitely see that he’s running against Congress as a whole and Democrats as a whole," [...] Isaac Wood, <b>an</b> <b>analyst</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Virginia Center for Politics, said. [...] "That was very clear. He spent just a few seconds introducing himself, then pivoted right away to attack the negative things happening in D.C. With voters, that can be effective." [...] Another ad from Hurt called Perriello a [...] "rubber stamp" [...] for the policies of President Barack Obama and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Hurt won with 51percent of the vote.|$|E

2500|$|The Iranian {{government}} released {{footage of}} a captured RQ-170 on 8 December. The captured drone {{appeared to be}} largely intact, except for minor damage on its left wing. Dan Goure, <b>an</b> <b>analyst</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Lexington Institute, stated the largely intact airframe ruled {{out the possibility of}} an engine or navigational malfunction: [...] "Either this was a cyber/electronic warfare attack system that brought the system down or it was a glitch in the command-and-control system". On 8 December, a senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the Washington Post that the U.S. cannot be certain the drone shown was real because the U.S. does not have access to it, but also stated that [...] "We have no indication that it was brought down by hostile fire." [...] A second senior U.S. military official said that a major question is how the drone could have remained [...] "virtually intact," [...] given the high altitude from which it is thought to have crashed. After examining the video on 8 Dec, US officials confirmed that the drone was genuine, even though some civilians had initially expressed doubt. Bill Sweetman, an author with an interest in military planes, speculated that the Iranians did not shoot down the plane (citing the lack of burn marks, holes, or outward damage) or hack into the system, postulating that a system failure downed the plane, and that the plane could be intact from what is known as a [...] "flat spin" [...] or [...] "falling leaf departure".|$|E
