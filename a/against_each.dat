5|$|Six {{teams from}} North America and six teams {{representing}} {{the rest of}} the World play a series of games <b>against</b> <b>each</b> other in order to win points. The first side to win a majority of the points available wins the cup. Teams compete in four formats: team games, mixed doubles games, singles competitions, and skins games. Team games are regular curling games, with two teams of four playing <b>against</b> <b>each</b> other. Mixed doubles games involve two teams, each consisting of one male and one female, playing <b>against</b> <b>each</b> other. Mixed doubles teams use only six stones per end, one of which is positioned {{prior to the start of}} the end. This is in contrast to the eight stones per end used by teams of four in regular curling games. The singles competition involves two teams playing <b>against</b> <b>each</b> other. There are six types of shots contested in the singles competitions. Each curler from each team is assigned to throw at least one type of shot. Points are given based on how well the shot is made. After all of the shots have been thrown, the team with the most points wins the competition. Skins games involve two teams playing <b>against</b> <b>each</b> other, where the objective is to win skins by scoring two or more points with the hammer or stealing points without the hammer. The points for the skins games, which go toward the total points for the cup, are distributed throughout the game, and the teams earn these points by winning skins.|$|E
