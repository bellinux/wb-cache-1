50|$|Rather than {{purchasing}} TV <b>Guide</b> <b>Channel</b> carriage rights, some {{services such}} as Optimum and Bright House Networks created their own scrolling listings grids, with Optimum's occasionally being interrupted by full-screen commercials, and otherwise featuring banner ads accompanied by music.
