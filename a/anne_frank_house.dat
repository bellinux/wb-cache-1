5|$|In 2016, the <b>Anne</b> <b>Frank</b> <b>House</b> {{published}} {{new research}} pointing to investigation over ration card fraud, rather than betrayal, as a plausible {{explanation for the}} raid {{that led to the}} arrest of the Franks. The report states that other activities in the building may have led authorities there, including activities of Frank's company. However, it does not rule out betrayal.|$|E
5|$|Filming in Pittsburgh {{included}} the interior scenes at the <b>Anne</b> <b>Frank</b> <b>House,</b> which was recreated on a soundstage at Pittsburgh Studios located in Churchill Borough, Pennsylvania {{in the east}} suburbs of Pittsburgh. Production designer Molly Hughes and art director Greg Weimerskirch built three different studio sets in Pittsburgh, one for each floor. Also, the Funky Bones art monument in Indianapolis was recreated in Pittsburgh {{with the help of}} the sculpture's creator, Dutch artist Joep Van Lieshout.|$|E
5|$|Over the years, several {{films about}} Anne Frank appeared. Her life and {{writings}} have inspired {{a diverse group}} of artists and social commentators to make reference to her in literature, popular music, television, and other media. These include The Anne Frank Ballet by Adam Darius, first performed in 1959, and the choral work Annelies, first performed in 2005. The only known footage of the real Anne Frank comes from a 1941 silent film recorded for her newlywed next-door neighbour. She is seen leaning out of a second-floor window in an attempt to better view the bride and groom. The couple, who survived the war, gave the film to the <b>Anne</b> <b>Frank</b> <b>House.</b>|$|E

The refugees stayed on the upper floors and attic of the family's boarding house, where there was also a secret compartment for hiding two or three people.|$|R
5|$|Hazel and Augustus {{arrive in}} Amsterdam and are {{presented}} with reservations at an expensive restaurant, pre-paid by Van Houten. During the meal, Augustus confesses his love for Hazel. The following afternoon, they go to Van Houten's house, but are shocked to find he is a mean-spirited alcoholic. Lidewij arranged the meeting and their dinner without Van Houten knowing anything about it. Angered by his assistant's actions, he taunts Hazel for seeking serious answers {{to a piece of}} fiction and belittles her medical condition. She leaves, utterly distraught. Lidewij invites them to go sightseeing to make up for their ruined experience. The three visit the <b>Anne</b> <b>Frank</b> <b>House,</b> where Hazel struggles to climb the house's many stairs. They spend that night together in their hotel and have sex for the first time. The next day Augustus tells Hazel that his cancer has returned and spread throughout his body and is terminal. Hazel is heartbroken, expressing how unfair life can be.|$|E
5|$|Born in Frankfurt, Germany, {{she lived}} {{most of her}} life in or near Amsterdam, Netherlands, having moved there with her family at the age of four and {{one-half}} when the Nazis gained control over Germany. Born a German national, Frank lost her citizenship in 1941 and thus became stateless. By May 1940, the Franks were trapped in Amsterdam by the German occupation of the Netherlands. As persecutions of the Jewish population increased in July 1942, the family went into hiding in some concealed rooms behind a bookcase in the building where Anne's father worked. From then until the family's arrest by the Gestapo in August 1944, Anne kept a diary she had received as a birthday present, and wrote in it regularly. Following their arrest, the Franks were transported to concentration camps. In October or November 1944, Anne and her sister, Margot, were transferred from Auschwitz to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where they died (probably of typhus) a few months later. They were originally estimated by the Red Cross to have died in March, with Dutch authorities setting 31 March as their official date of death, but research by the <b>Anne</b> <b>Frank</b> <b>House</b> in 2015 suggests they more likely died in February.|$|E
5|$|On 3 May 1957, a {{group of}} citizens, {{including}} Otto Frank, established the Anne Frank Stichting {{in an effort to}} rescue the Prinsengracht building from demolition and to make it accessible to the public. The <b>Anne</b> <b>Frank</b> <b>House</b> opened on 3 May 1960. It consists of the Opekta warehouse and offices and the , all unfurnished so that visitors can walk freely through the rooms. Some personal relics of the former occupants remain, such as movie star photographs glued by Anne to a wall, a section of wallpaper on which Otto Frank marked the height of his growing daughters, and a map on the wall where he recorded the advance of the Allied Forces, all now protected behind Perspex sheets. From the small room which was once home to Peter van Pels, a walkway connects the building to its neighbours, also purchased by the Foundation. These other buildings are used to house the diary, as well as rotating exhibits that chronicle aspects of the Holocaust and more contemporary examinations of racial intolerance around the world. One of Amsterdam's main tourist attractions, it received a record 965,000 visitors in 2005. The House provides information via the internet and offers exhibitions that in 2005 travelled to 32 countries in Europe, Asia, North America, and South America.|$|E

40|$|People {{are fascinated}} with death and disaster. One simply has to watch traffic slow {{to a crawl}} when passing a car {{accident}} to understand this. However, this fascination goes beyond {{the side of a}} highway and enters the realm of tourism. Today, numerous sites of death and disaster attract millions of visitors from all around the world: Auschwitz-Birkenau, <b>Anne</b> <b>Frank's</b> <b>House,</b> Graceland, Oklahoma City, Gettysburg, Vimy Ridge, the Somme, Arlington National Cemetery. The list grows each year as exhibited by the recent creation of an apartheid museum in Johannesburg, South Africa. Due to the increasing popularity of this tourism product, a small number of academics have begun studying the phenomenon. Leading the field are Lennon and Foley who labeled it Dark Tourism, Seaton who coined the term Thanatourism, and Rojek who developed the concept of Black Spots. However, despite ongoing study, there has been a paucity in understanding what actually motivates individuals to sites of dark tourism. Yet understanding motivation is imperative, particularly given the subject and sensitivity of these sites. Some are slowly decaying, and visitors play a large role in their preservation. Subsequently, without proper management, visitor influxes can further deteriorate sites or induce friction with the locals. Knowledge then, also provides administrators the necessary tools to properly manage the varying stakeholders. Although many feel an interest in death and disaster simply stems from morbidity, the range of factors involved extend from an interest in history and heritage to education to remembrance. To begin this study, a list of possible motivations was compiled. Then, to get a better comprehension of these motivations, visitors to the Holocaust Museum Houston were surveyed as a case study. As a commodified, synthetic site of death and atrocity, the museum fits the definitions of a dark tourism site as established by lead academics. Therefore, by asking visitors to the museum what motivated them to the site, the results will hopefully give some acumen into the wants and needs of certain stakeholders. Finally, this research sought to discover if motivation at the museum could shed light on motivation to other sites of dark tourism...|$|R

500|$|The Merwedeplein apartment, {{where the}} Frank family lived from 1933 until 1942, {{remained}} privately owned until the 2000s. After becoming {{the focus of}} a television documentary, the building—in a serious state of disrepair—was purchased by a Dutch housing corporation. Aided by photographs taken by the Frank family and descriptions in letters written by Anne Frank, it was restored to its 1930s appearance. Teresien da Silva of the <b>Anne</b> <b>Frank</b> <b>House</b> and Frank's cousin, Bernhard [...] "Buddy" [...] Elias, contributed to the restoration project. It opened in 2005. Each year, a writer who is unable to write freely {{in his or her own}} country is selected for a year-long tenancy, during which they reside and write in the apartment. The first writer selected was the Algerian novelist and poet El-Mahdi Acherchour.|$|E
500|$|In 1991, Holocaust deniers Robert Faurisson and Siegfried Verbeke {{produced}} a booklet titled The Diary of Anne Frank: A Critical Approach, {{in which they}} revived the allegation that Otto Frank wrote the diary. Purported evidence, as before, included several contradictions in the diary, that the prose style and handwriting were not those of a teenager, and that hiding in the Achterhuis would have been impossible. [...] In December 1993 the <b>Anne</b> <b>Frank</b> <b>House</b> in Amsterdam and the Anne Frank Fonds in Basel filed a civil lawsuit to prohibit further distribution of Faurisson and Verbeke's booklet in the Netherlands. On 9 December 1998 the Amsterdam District Court ruled in favour of the claimants, forbade any further denial of {{the authenticity of the}} diary and unsolicited distribution of publications to that effect, and imposed a penalty of 25,000 guilders per infringement.|$|E
