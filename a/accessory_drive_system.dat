Underdrive pulleys modify {{the amount of}} engine power that can be drawn by accessory devices. Such alterations to the drive systems for alternators or air conditioning compressors (rather than the power steering pump, for example) can be detrimental to vehicle usability (e.g., by not keeping the battery fully charged), but will not impair safety.|$|E
5000|$|All {{engine-driven}} accessories, {{such as the}} alternator, {{power steering}} pump, air conditioning compressor, and radiator fan, are accessible from the front hood, driven off {{the front of the}} engine by an accessory driveshaft, and is known as the Supplemental <b>Accessory</b> <b>Drive</b> <b>System,</b> or [...] "SADS." [...] This allows for even front/rear weight distribution, which benefits ride quality and handling. However, it also prevents the installation of a larger engine, while the cost could not be relayed by sharing the platform with other vehicles.|$|E

40|$|Belt span {{transverse}} vibrations in an automotive <b>accessory</b> <b>drive</b> <b>system</b> {{are known}} to be significantly amplified when the angular natural frequencies of the system are in close proximity to the transverse natural frequencies. In order to avoid this situation when designing a belt drive it is necessary to be able to mathematically model the angular motion of the system. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop a model which is able to consider both single and multiple belt systems with a pivoted-arm automatic belt tensioner and determine the natural frequencies, mode shapes, forced response and dynamic belt tension. Experiments were conducted on two- and three-pulley systems, with and without an automatic belt tensioner, to investigate the angular vibration characteristics of simplified accessory drives. The results of these experiments were in good agreement with the analytical model. The effect of initial belt tension on the angular natural frequencies was investigated and found to be negligible. Tests were also performed to determine belt span transverse vibration natural frequencies for various span lengths and belt tensions. These results were also in good agreement with an existing theory of belt vibrations. Dept. of Mechanical, Automotive, and Materials Engineering.

40|$|To {{investigate}} the rotation vibration {{dynamics of the}} pulleys and the tension arms, and to estimate the vibrations of the belts and the slip ratio between the belt and the pulleys in the engine front-end accessory drive systems, a systematic modelling and analytical method is proposed for engine front-end accessory drive systems; this {{can be used for}} modelling engine front-end accessory drive systems with different layouts and different numbers of tensioners, including automatic and fixed tensioners. In the modelling, the rotational pulleys are classified as fixed-axis pulleys and moveable-axis pulleys (such as the pulley in the tensioner). Moreover, the belt spans are classified as the belt spans between the two fixed pulleys, and the belt spans adjacent to the pulley of a tensioner. The equations of motion for each type of pulley and the tension calculation equations for each type of belt span are developed. In this way, the equations of motion for all the pulleys and the tensioner arms can be obtained easily, irrespective of the layout of the tensioners. To obtain the dynamic rotational vibration responses of an engine front-end <b>accessory</b> <b>drive</b> <b>system</b> by the conventional Runge-Kutta method, high-efficiency algorithms or methods are also proposed for calculating the tangent-point coordinates between a belt and the adjacent pulleys and the belt length of the contact arc on one pulley. The proposed modelling and analysis methods are validated by modelling different layouts of the engine front-end accessory drive systems with different types and numbers of tensioners, and also by comparisons between the calculated dynamic vibration responses of the pulleys and the belts and the real experimental data.

40|$|Multiribbed {{serpentine}} belt <b>drive</b> <b>systems</b> are widely adopted in <b>accessory</b> <b>drive</b> automo- tive applications {{due to the}} better performances relative to the flat or V-belt drives. Nevertheless, they can generate unwanted noise and vibration which may affect the correct functionality and the fatigue life of the belt and of the other components of the transmission. The aim of the paper is to analyze {{the effect of the}} shear deflection in the rubber layer between the pulley and the belt fibers on the rotational dynamic behavior of the transmission. To this end the Firbank's model has been extended to cover the case of small amplitude vibrations about mean rotational speeds. The model evidences that the shear deflection can be accounted for by an elastic term reacting to the torsional oscil- lations in series with a viscous term that dominates at constant speed. In addition, the axial deformation of the belt spans are taken into account. The numerical model has been validated by the comparison with the experimental results obtained on an <b>accessory</b> <b>drive</b> transmission including two pulleys and an automatic tensioner.

40|$|The present work is {{intended}} to describe the concept and realization of a test rig for the characterization of the efficiency of front end <b>accessory</b> <b>drives.</b> The study is in particular addressed to those systems where the traditional alternator is replaced with a Belt Starter Generator (BSG).
