60|$|As {{with a few}} {{exceptions}} tendrils spontaneously revolve, it may be asked,--why have they been endowed with sensitiveness?--why, when they come into contact with a stick, do they not, like twining plants, spirally wind round it? One reason may be that they are in most cases so flexible and thin, that when brought into contact with any object, they would almost certainly yield and be dragged onwards by the revolving movement. Moreover, the sensitive extremities have no revolving power as far as I have observed, and could not by this means curl round a support. With twining plants, on the other hand, the extremity spontaneously bends more than any other part; and this is of high importance for the ascent of the plant, as may be seen on a windy day. It is, however, possible that the slow movement of the basal and stiffer parts of certain tendrils, which wind round sticks placed in their path, may be analogous to that of twining plants. But I hardly attended sufficiently to this point, {{and it would have been}} difficult to distinguish between a movement due to extremely dull irritability, from the <b>arrestment</b> of the lower part, whilst the upper part continued to move onwards.|$|E

With the Wistaria, on the other hand, a long horizontal shoot wound itself at first into a very close spire, which remained unchanged; but subsequently, as the shoot twined spirally up its support, it made a much more open spire.

We will, in all practicable ways, by word and silence, by act and refusal to act, energetically demand that arrestment,--"je demande cette arrestation-là!"--and by degrees infallibly attain it. Infallibly: for light spreads; all human souls, never so bedarkened, love light; light once kindled spreads, till all is luminous;--till the cry, [...] "Arrest your knaves and dastards" [...] rises imperative from millions of hearts, and rings and reigns from sea to sea. Nay how many of them may we not 'arrest' with our own hands, even now; we! Do not countenance them, thou there: turn away from their lacquered sumptuosities, their belauded sophistries, their serpent graciosities, their spoken and acted cant, with a sacred horror, with an Apage Satanas.--Bobus and Company, and all men will gradually join us. We demand <b>arrestment</b> of the knaves and dastards, and begin by arresting our own poor selves out of that fraternity. There is no other reform conceivable. Thou and I, my friend, can, in the most flunky world, make, each of us, one non-flunky, one hero, if we like: that will be two heroes to begin with:--Courage! even that is a whole world of heroes to end with, or what we poor Two can do in furtherance thereof! ...|$|E
6000|$|Sulphate of Quinine.--Some of this salt {{was added}} to water, which is said to {{dissolve}} 1/1000 part of its weight. Five leaves were immersed, each in thirty minims of this solution, which tasted bitter. In less than 1 hr. {{some of them had}} a few tentacles inflected. In 3 hrs. most of the glands became whitish, others dark-coloured, and many oddly mottled. After 6 hrs. two of the leaves had a good many tentacles inflected, but this very moderate degree of inflection never increased. One of the leaves was taken out of the solution after 4 hrs., and placed in water; by the next morning some few of the inflected tentacles had re-expanded, showing that they were not dead; but the glands were still much discoloured. Another leaf not included in the above lot, after an immersion of 3 hrs. 15 m., was carefully examined; the protoplasm in the cells of the outer tentacles, and of the short green ones on the disc, had become strongly aggregated down to their bases; and I distinctly saw that the little masses changed their positions and shapes rather rapidly; some coalescing and again separating. I was surprised at this fact, because quinine is said to arrest all movement in the white corpuscles of the blood; but as, according to Binz,* this is due to their being no longer supplied with oxygen by the red corpuscles, any such <b>arrestment</b> of movement could not be expected in Drosera. That the glands had absorbed some of the salt was evident from their change of colour; but I at first thought that the solution might not have travelled down the cells of the tentacles, where the protoplasm was seen in active movement. This view, however, I have no doubt, is erroneous, for a leaf which had been immersed for 3 hrs. in the quinine solution was then placed in a little solution of one part of carbonate of ammonia to 218 of water; and in 30 m. the glands and the upper cells of the tentacles became intensely black, with the protoplasm presenting a very unusual appearance; for it ...|$|E
40|$|A presente dissertação trata das condições de vida dos jovens que vivem nos espaços segregados da cidade de Goiânia, tendo como referência a Vila Coronel Cosme. Quem são esses jovens? Como vivem? Quais são seus projetos de vida? Qual a organização desses jovens na Vila? Essas são indagações que me levaram a conhecer melhor o modo de vida e o espaço onde estes moram com seus familiares. O objetivo é apreender as formas de sobrevivência e organização adotadas pela juventude, em uma realidade marcada por uma política que favorece a segregação urbana que teve origem na construção da cidade-capital planejada nos anos 30. A presença dos trabalhadores tem com função construir a cidade para os outros morarem. Essas reflexões confrontam com o direito de moradia instituído pela Declaração Universal dos Direitos Humanos e pela Constituição Federal de 1988. A perspectiva de {{investigar}} o espaço urbano através das áreas de posse tem relação direta com as condições de vida das classes populares, expropriadas pelas relações capitalistas com a conivência do Estado. Nesse cenário, procuramos desvendar como vivem os jovens de baixa renda, compreendidos como uma categoria histórica construída e socialmente determinada. A pesquisa revela a realidade vivida pelos jovens, em meio à pobreza e violência, resultante da ausência do Estado democrático e pela presença efetiva do tráfico de drogas e da violência policial. Dessa realidade decorrem outras formas de relações como: proteção, garantia de renda, ameaças, prisão, morte, extorsão, entre outras práticas que marcam o dia a dia das famílias. O processo de investigação revela uma juventude abandonada, refém da violência pessoal e social e da miséria que constitui a realidade dessa população, cujos espaços são determinados pelo capital imobiliário de caráter especulativo, inserido na lógica das cidades. Dentro desse pressuposto, tanto a terra quanto a moradia são mercadorias, desvinculadas da dimensão do direito socialmente construído pela luta dos trabalhadores. Essa reflexão é apenas uma contribuição no sentido de desvendar a realidade na qual os jovens trabalhadores organizam sua vida, suas lutas, seus sonhos, apontando para projetos de vidas que assegurem o trabalho, a escolarização, a autonomia e o seu direito de ter uma vida digna. This work {{talks about}} life {{conditions of the}} young people that live in segregated spaces of the city of Goiânia, taking as reference Coronel Cosme s neighborhood. Who are these Young? How do they live? What are their lives Project? What is their organization in that neighborhood? These questions guided me to know better their life way and the space where they live with their family. The objective of this work is to catch the ways of surviving and the organization used by youth, in a reality marked by a politic that provokes urban segregation that has its origins on the planed capital-city construction on the thirties. The presence of workers has the goal to build the city for others to live. These reflections confront the right of housing established by the Universal declaration of the human rights and by the Federal constitutional of 1988. The perspective to search the urban space by the area of ownership has close relation with the life conditions of the popular classes explored by the capitalist relations, with the connivance of the state. In this scenery we try to show how the low finance class young people live, comprehended as a historical category built up and also socially determined. This work shows the reality lived by the young, inside the poverty and violence, {{as a consequence of the}} absence of the democratic State and also by the effective presence of the drugs traffic and the violence of the police. From this reality, there are others relations like: protection, income security, threats, <b>arrestments,</b> death, extortions and other practices that are in everyday s life of those families. The investigation process shows an abandoned youth, hostage of the personal and social violence and the misery that is the reality of this population, in a way that the spaces are determined by the speculative character of the housing capital, inside the cities organization. In this context even the land and the housing are commodities, disconnected of the idea of social right built by the fight of the workers. All this reflection is just a contribution in the way of showing the reality how young worker organize their lives, their fights, their dreams forward life projects that are connected to work, studies, the autonomy and their right of a dignified life...|$|R
6000|$|I know of {{only one}} {{difficulty}} on the foregoing view, namely, the far- transported blocks of rock high {{on the sides of}} the valley of the Cachapual: I will not attempt any explanation of this phenomenon, but I may state my belief that a mountain-ridge near the Baths of Cauquenes has been upraised long subsequently to all the other ranges in the neighbourhood, and that when this was effected the whole face of the country must have been greatly altered. In the course of ages, moreover, in this and other valleys, events may have occurred like, but even on a grander scale than, that described by Molina, when a slip during the earthquake of 1762 banked up for ten days the great River Lontue, which then bursting its barrier [...] "inundated the whole country," [...] and doubtless transported many great fragments of rock. ("Compendio de la Hist." [...] etc. etc. tome 1 page 30. M. Brongniart, in his report on M. Gay's labours [...] "Annales des Sciences" [...] 1833, considers that the boulders in the Cachapual belong to the same class with the erratic boulders of Europe. As the blocks which I saw are not gigantic, and especially as they are not angular, and as they have not been transported fairly across low spaces or wide valleys, I am unwilling to class them with those which, both in the northern and southern hemisphere [...] "Geological Transactions" [...] volume 6 page 415, have been transported by ice. It is to be hoped that when M. Gay's long-continued and admirable labours in Chile are published, more light will be thrown on this subject. However, the boulders may have been primarily transported; the final position of those of porphyry, which have been described as arranged at the foot of the mountain in rude lines, I cannot doubt, has been due to the action of waves on a beach. The valley of the Cachapual, in the part where the boulders occur, bursts through the high ridge of Cauquenes, which runs parallel to, but at some distance from, the Cordillera. This ridge has been subjected to excessive violence; trachytic lava has burst from it, and hot springs yet flow at its base. Seeing the enormous amount of denudation of solid rock in the upper and much broader parts of this valley where it enters the Cordillera, and seeing to what extent the ridge of Cauquenes now protects the great range, I could not help believing (as alluded to in the text) that this ridge with its trachytic eruptions had been thrown up at a much later period than the Cordillera. If this has been the case, the boulders, after having been transported to a low level by the torrents (which exhibit in every valley proofs of their power of moving great fragments), may have been raised up to their present height, with the land on which they rested.) Finally, notwithstanding this one case of difficulty, I cannot entertain any doubt, that these terrace-like fringes, which are continuously united with the basin-shaped plains at the foot of the Cordillera, have been formed by the <b>arrestment</b> of river-borne detritus at successive levels, in the same manner as we see now taking place at the heads of all those many, deep, winding fiords intersecting the southern coasts. To my mind, this has been one of the most important conclusions to which my observations on the geology of South America have led me; for we thus learn that one of the grandest and most symmetrical mountain-chains in the world, with its several parallel lines, has been together uplifted in mass between seven and nine thousand feet, in the same gradual manner as have the eastern and western coasts within the recent period. (I do not wish to affirm that all the lines have been uplifted quite equally; slight differences in the elevation would leave no perceptible effect on the terraces. It may, however, be inferred, perhaps with one exception, that since the period when the sea occupied these valleys, the several ranges have not been dislocated by GREAT and ABRUPT faults or upheavals; for if such had occurred, the terraces of gravel at these points would not have been continuous. The one exception is at the lower end of a plain in the Valle del Yeso (a branch of the Maypu), where, at a great height, the terraces and valley appear to have been broken through by a line of upheaval, of which the evidence is plain in the adjoining mountains; this dislocation, perhaps, occurred AFTER THE ELEVATION of this part of the valley above the level of the sea. The valley here is almost blocked up by a pile about one thousand feet in thickness, formed, as far as I could judge, from three sides, entirely, or at least in chief part, of gravel and detritus. On the south side, the river has cut quite through this mass; on the northern side, and on the very summit, deep ravines, parallel to the line of the valley, are worn, as if the drainage from the valley above had passed by these two lines before following its present course.) ...|$|E
