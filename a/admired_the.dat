5|$|Critic Vivian Mercier {{was among}} the first to {{recognise}} Samuel Beckett's debt to Synge. Beckett was a regular member of the audience at the Abbey in his youth and particularly <b>admired</b> <b>the</b> plays of Yeats, Synge and O'Casey. Mercier points out parallels between Synge's casts of tramps, beggars and peasants and many of the figures in Beckett's novels and dramatic works.|$|E
5|$|Leicester {{also built}} a loggia, or open gallery, beside the great keep {{to lead to}} the new formal gardens. The loggia was {{designed}} to elegantly frame the view as the observer slowly <b>admired</b> <b>the</b> gardens, and was a new design in the 16th century, only recently imported from Italy.|$|E

Similarly, the adaptations of birds' bills in species like the crossbill, spoonbill and (long-billed) snipe are discussed.|$|E
5|$|Saxophonists Parker and Lester Young were {{important}} influences on Tristano's development. Another major figure was pianist Art Tatum: Tristano practiced solo Tatum pieces {{early in his}} career, before gradually moving away from this influence {{in search of his}} own style. Bebopper Bud Powell also affected Tristano's playing and teaching, as he <b>admired</b> <b>the</b> younger pianist's articulation and expression.|$|E

Khrushchev greatly <b>admired</b> <b>the</b> dictator and treasured informal meetings with him and invitations to Stalin's dacha, while Stalin felt warm affection for his young subordinate.|$|E

5|$|Subtitled Fantasie en forme de quadrille sur les thèmes favoris de l'Anneau de Nibelung ("Fantasy in {{the form}} of a quadrille on {{favourite}} themes from Der Ring des Nibelungen"). Fauré <b>admired</b> <b>the</b> music of Wagner and was familiar with the smallest details of his scores, but he was one of the few composers of his generation not to come under Wagner's musical influence.|$|E
5|$|The {{current and}} past highway commissioners were accused of {{incompetence}} and embezzlement and forced to repay money. According to Suetonius, {{in the first year}} of Caligula's reign he squandered 2.7 billion sesterces that Tiberius had amassed. His nephew Nero Caesar both envied and <b>admired</b> <b>the</b> fact that Gaius had run through the vast wealth Tiberius had left him in so short a time.|$|E
5|$|A {{self-described}} anarchist, Baker {{has been}} categorized {{as a writer}} of transgressional fiction, in that his novels are frequently populated by sociopathic, nihilistic characters who engage in taboo behaviors such as heavy drug use, incest, necrophilia and other practices; and often commit acts of extreme, surrealistic violence. A man of eclectic tastes, Baker cited as literary influences writers and film directors ranging from Proust to Jim Thompson and Sam Peckinpah. He also <b>admired</b> <b>the</b> punk writer Dennis Cooper.|$|E

5|$|Although it is {{not fully}} {{understood}} how it came to his attention, Rochdale Town Hall was admired by Adolf Hitler. It has been suggested a visit by Hitler in 1912–13 while staying with his half-brother Alois Hitler, Jr. in Liverpool, or military intelligence on Rochdale, or information from Nazi sympathiser William Joyce (who had lived in Oldham), brought the building to his attention. Hitler <b>admired</b> <b>the</b> architecture {{so much that it}} is believed he wished to ship the building, brick-by-brick, to Nazi Germany had German-occupied Europe encompassed the United Kingdom. Rochdale was broadly avoided by German bombers during the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|Aylesbury ducks, meanwhile, were {{becoming}} inbred, meaning fertile eggs were scarcer and the ducks were {{more susceptible to}} disease. Exhibition standards had led to selection for an exaggerated keel by breeders, despite it being unpopular with dealers and consumers. Poultry show judges also <b>admired</b> <b>the</b> long neck and upright posture of Pekin ducks over the boat-like stance of the Aylesbury. Some of the breeders in the Aylesbury area began to cross Pekin ducks with the pure Aylesbury strain. Although the Aylesbury-Pekin cross ducks {{did not have the}} delicate flavour of the pure Aylesbury, they were hardier and much cheaper to raise.|$|E
5|$|Charlotte Brontë {{had a brief}} {{association}} with Banagher in the mid-1850s when she married one Arthur Bell Nicholls, her father's curate. Nicholls was born of Scottish parents in County Antrim in 1818. He was orphaned early and subsequently brought up by his uncle, Alan Bell, in Banagher. Alan Bell was headmaster at the Royal School at Cuba Court at that time. The couple honeymooned in Ireland and stayed at Cuba Court for a period in June 1854. According to Pope Hennessy, Mrs. Nicholls disliked both Banagher and its inhabitants, although she greatly <b>admired</b> <b>the</b> surrounding countryside.|$|E

We <b>admire</b> <b>the</b> man who embodies victorious effort; the man {{who never}} wrongs his neighbor, who is prompt to help a friend; but who has those virile qualities {{necessary}} {{to win in the}} stern strife of actual life. It is hard to fail; but it is worse never to have tried to succeed." ...|$|R

5|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} {{the first edition of}} Leaves of Grass, critical responses began focusing more on the potentially offensive sexual themes. Though the second edition was already printed and bound, the publisher almost did not release it. In the end, the edition went to retail, with 20 additional poems, in August 1856. Leaves of Grass was revised and re-released in 1860 again in 1867, and several more times throughout the remainder of Whitman's life. Several well-known writers <b>admired</b> <b>the</b> work enough to visit Whitman, including Amos Bronson Alcott and Henry David Thoreau.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{unbeknownst to}} Kurosawa, Rashomon had been {{entered in the}} prestigious Venice Film Festival, due {{to the efforts of}} Giuliana Stramigioli, a Japan-based {{representative}} of an Italian film company, who had seen and <b>admired</b> <b>the</b> movie and convinced Daiei to submit it. On September 10, 1951, Rashomon was awarded the festival's highest prize, the Golden Lion, shocking not only Daiei but the international film world, which at the time was largely unaware of Japan's decades-old cinematic tradition.|$|E
5|$|On 1 August 1883 the New South Wales {{government}} made a proclamation which transferred {{control of the}} Technical and Working Men's College to an independent Board of Technical Education, to which Selfe was appointed, and assumed financial responsibility directly. The government also provided funds to fit out workshops in Kent Street that opened in 1886. This was an initiative driven by Selfe, who had <b>admired</b> <b>the</b> workshop teaching model abroad. It represented a major innovation in technical education in New South Wales.|$|E

5|$|On the book's publication, Waugh's friends praised it, but {{its general}} {{critical}} reception was muted. Most reviewers <b>admired</b> <b>the</b> self-portrait of Waugh {{with which the}} novel opens, but expressed divided views about the rest, in particular the ending. Commentators have debated whether the novel provides a real-life depiction of Waugh, or if it represents the exaggerated persona that he cultivated {{as a means of}} preserving his privacy. The book has been dramatised for radio and as a stage play.|$|E
5|$|The {{book has}} been called engagingly written, wisely researched, and {{honestly}} told. Critics <b>admired</b> <b>the</b> wit and humour. The book reviewer for The Globe and Mail admitted he grew impatient with the grand and repetitive statements about the changing global food system and the authors' hyperbole regarding their modest culinary discoveries. Compared to Kingsolver's Animal, Vegetable, Miracle, The 100-Mile Diet {{was found to be}} more compelling and easier to read, with Smith and MacKinnon more relatable and sympathetic than Kingsolver.|$|E
5|$|The coins were minted in August 1918, {{and were}} sold {{to the public for}} $1 each. All sold, though many were held by a bank until 1933, and the profits used to defray the cost of local centennial {{celebrations}} or to help those in need because of World War I. Later writers have generally <b>admired</b> <b>the</b> coin, considering it one of the more handsome American commemoratives. The coin is valued in the hundreds of dollars today, though exceptional specimens may trade for more.|$|E
