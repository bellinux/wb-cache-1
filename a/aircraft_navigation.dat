25|$|The {{governor}} received {{relatively little}} scientific attention until James Clerk Maxwell published a paper that established {{the beginning of}} a theoretical basis for understanding control theory. Development of the electronic amplifier during the 1920s, which was important for long distance telephony, required a higher signal to noise ratio, which was solved by negative feedback noise cancellation. This and other telephony applications contributed to control theory. In the 1940s and 1950s, German mathematician Irmgard Flugge-Lotz developed the theory of discontinuous automatic controls, which found military applications during the Second World War to fire control systems and <b>aircraft</b> <b>navigation</b> systems.|$|E
25|$|Development of {{the next}} {{improved}} variant, the UH-60M, was approved in 2001, to extend the service life of the UH-60 design into the 2020s. The UH-60M incorporates upgraded T700-GE-701D engines, improved rotor blades, and {{state of the art}} electronic instrumentation, flight controls and <b>aircraft</b> <b>navigation</b> control. After the U.S. DoD approved low-rate initial production of the new variant, manufacturing began in 2006, with the first of 22 new UH-60Ms delivered in July 2006. After an initial operational evaluation, the Army approved full-rate production and a five-year contract for 1,227 helicopters in December 2007. By March 2009, 100 UH-60M helicopters had been delivered to the Army. In November 2014, US military ordered 102 aircraft of various H-60 types, worth $1.3 billion.|$|E
500|$|The {{validity}} of the [...] "see and avoid" [...] doctrine as a safe means of <b>aircraft</b> <b>navigation</b> was a point of contention between the NTSB and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The NTSB had faulted the doctrine in several earlier collisions, including the 1969 collision of Allegheny Airlines Flight 853 with a privately owned Piper PA-28 and the 1967 collision of Piedmont Airlines Flight 22 with a privately owned Cessna 310. The FAA rebutted these findings and insisted that, regardless of the mode of operation, {{it is the duty}} of the aircraft pilot to be aware of any aircraft in his immediate vicinity.|$|E

2500|$|In December 2007, {{airline pilots}} {{noticed that the}} base had {{appeared}} in their <b>aircraft</b> <b>navigation</b> systems' latest Jeppesen database revision with the ICAO airport identifier code of KXTA and listed as [...] "Homey Airport". The probably inadvertent release of the airport data led to advice by the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA) that student pilots should be explicitly warned about KXTA, not to consider it as a waypoint or destination for any flight even though it now appears in public navigation databases.|$|E
2500|$|By the 1930s {{the use of}} BTDF for {{long-range}} <b>aircraft</b> <b>navigation</b> was common. A {{good example}} of such a system was first installed in Australia in 1934 as part of the [...] MacRobertson Air Race. Two stations equipped with Marconi BTDF sets and Adcock antennae were set up at Charleville and Melbourne. The success of this system led to additional stations being added to form a network of 17 DF stations for long-distance navigation. By 1945, these had been largely replaced by RDF systems in the aircraft, rather than the ground.|$|E
2500|$|About two {{of every}} seven {{licenses}} for {{the export of}} [...] "dual use" [...] technology items approved between 1985 and 1990 by the U.S. Department of Commerce [...] "went either directly to the Iraqi armed forces, to Iraqi end-users engaged in weapons production, or to Iraqi enterprises suspected of diverting technology" [...] to weapons of mass destruction, according to an investigation by House Banking Committee Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez. Confidential Commerce Department files also reveal that the Reagan and Bush administrations approved at least 80 direct exports to the Iraqi military. These included computers, communications equipment, <b>aircraft</b> <b>navigation</b> and radar equipment.|$|E

50|$|The {{navigator}} {{is responsible}} for the maintenance of the ship's navigational equipment.

2500|$|During the {{development}} of MLS, consumer GPS receivers of various quality started appearing. GPS offered {{a huge number of}} advantages to the pilot, combining all of an aircraft's long-distance navigation systems into a single easy-to-use system, often small enough to be hand held. Deploying an <b>aircraft</b> <b>navigation</b> system based on GPS was largely a problem of developing new techniques and standards, as opposed to new equipment. The FAA started planning to shut down their existing long-distance systems (VOR and NDBs) in favor of GPS. This left the problem of approaches, however. GPS is simply not accurate enough to replace ILS systems. Typical accuracy is about , whereas even a [...] "CAT I" [...] approach, the least demanding, requires a vertical accuracy of [...]|$|E
2500|$|An {{interesting}} feature [...] can {{be found}} in the middle of the airfield. It is a concrete circle in a ring, that indicates the cardinal points of the compass.

The concrete control tower (coordinates listed above) today is a restaurant, with what appears to be a connecting wartime building as part of the structure located today on the west side of the N44. About 1km northwest, also along the N44 is a British World War I cemetery [...] which has the graves of many Tommies killed along the Western Front trenches that were close by the area. Nearby the cemetery are concrete bomb shelters dug by the Germans and reinforced, to protect personnel during the frequent Allied air raids.|$|E

5|$|A few {{deductions}} can be {{made from}} the satellite communications.

The aircraft's SDU needs location and track information to keep its antenna pointed towards the satellite, so it can also be deduced that the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>navigation</b> system was operational.|$|R
