5|$|Beside the weapons, each zduhać {{carried a}} milk bucket and a peck measure; an {{alternative}} {{for the latter}} could be <b>a</b> <b>shovel</b> or broom from a threshing floor.

Seizing the milk buckets meant that the milk yield would be transferred. According to the clan of Kuči, zduhaći used their peck measures, milk buckets, and other containers to grab off the overall yield of the enemy territory.|$|E

His widow is approached by a mysterious man, Mark Johnson (Holmes Osborne), {{who claims to have}} worked with her husband.

One week later, Johnson is monitoring Crouch's grave when his phone rings; he walks towards the grave with <b>a</b> <b>shovel.</b> Subsequently, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) are called in to examine Crouch's empty grave. They notice damage done to the interior of the casket; Scully theorizes that the scene was staged. A briefing is held by Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), who notes that Crouch is one of four former FBI agents whose graves have been exhumed; all four men had committed suicide. Because of the presence of goat's blood encircling the grave, Mulder states that the crime was an act of necromancy. After the briefing, Skinner takes the agents aside and asks them to investigate Crouch's possible ties to the Millennium Group, which is now dissolved.|$|E
