Therefore, it must be true that no difference can exist between the returns on domestic <b>assets</b> and the returns on foreign <b>assets.</b> That {{is not to say that}} domestic investors and foreign investors will earn equivalent returns, but that a single investor on any given side would expect to earn equivalent returns from either investment decision.|$|E

This study had as main objective to develop an <b>asset</b> management auditing methodology. The methodology includes the development of a Program for <b>Asset</b> Management Improvement (PAMI) and the application of Business Process Engineering as a tool to realise the improvement opportunities identified through the audit. <b>Asset</b> Management is clearly defined in this study and a framework representing the scope of <b>Asset</b> Management developed to comprehensively address the relevant elements. The life cycle of an <b>asset</b> consists of the acquisition, operation, maintenance and disposal phases. These four phases of an <b>asset’s</b> life represents the high level framework for <b>Asset</b> Management. The application of an <b>asset</b> management audit, according to the developed methodology, can create the “roadmap” to <b>Asset</b> Management excellence.

Our empirical analysis yields the following results. Firstly, market specific monetary conditions can differ considerably among <b>asset</b> markets. Secondly, market specific monetary conditions are positively related to <b>asset</b> prices. Thirdly, US <b>asset</b> markets have experienced a loosening in market specific monetary conditions in the last decades.
