5|$|Bates {{put forward}} the {{hypothesis}} that the close resemblance between unrelated species was an antipredator adaptation. He noted that some species showed very striking coloration, and flew in a leisurely manner, <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> taunting predators to eat them. He reasoned that these butterflies were unpalatable to birds and other insectivores, and were thus avoided by them. He extended this logic to forms that closely resembled such protected species, mimicking their warning coloration but not their toxicity.|$|E
5|$|I said, 'Mr. Malcolm, {{could you}} tell me {{something}} about your mother?' And I will never, ever forget how he stopped <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he was suspended like a marionette. And he said, 'I remember the kind of dresses she used to wear. They were old and faded and gray.' And then he walked some more. And he said, 'I remember how she was always bent over the stove, trying to stretch what little we had.' And that was the beginning, that night, of his walk. And he walked that floor until just about daybreak.|$|E
25|$|Some alien {{abduction}} {{reports have}} depicted variant skin colors such as blue-grey, green-grey, or purple-grey and sometimes not grey at all. The skin is typically {{described as being}} extremely smooth, <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> made of an artificial material like rubber or plastic.|$|E

25|$|While {{most would}} see the lions as {{aggressive}} and dangerous, the lions of Gir rarely attack people. They live in a very close proximity to people, which makes their behavior different <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they have an acquaintanceship with the neighboring people. The lions who remember being hunted have now taken the higher road and stopped the circle of life.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the eight}} daitengu. He is the triplet brother of Taro and Saburo. He resembles Kyo <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they are related, which they are not. He loves Misao as a big sister figure and likes seeing her smile. He is later {{put in charge of}} taking care of Sou, which annoys him, as Sou tends to hide from and refuse to listen to him.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} morning, the bear inexplicably begins to hammer away at iron. He's roaring loudly, <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> in song, {{and no one}} understands why. However, the men join him and, in essence, lose {{themselves}} in the hard work. Prushevsky does not follow suit. A girl asks him to teach her knowledge, and he leaves the worksite with her. The activist receives {{a letter from the}} Soviet government stating that any peasants who seem too willing to have their property collectivized should be treated with suspicion as undercover agents.|$|E

25|$|Warfare {{does not}} seem to have been a {{significant}} element in Chavín culture. The archaeological evidence shows a lack of basic defensive structures in Chavín centres, and warriors are not depicted in art, in notable contrast to the earlier art at Cerro Sechín. Effective social control may have been exercised by religious pressure, and the ability to exclude dissidents from managed water resources. The climate and terrain of the neighbouring areas outside the managed land were a daunting option for farmers wishing to flee the culture. Evidence of warfare has been found only in contemporaneous sites that were not influenced by Chavín culture, <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> those other civilizations were defending themselves via warfare from Chavín cultural influence.|$|E
25|$|The cult comedy Irony of Fate (also Ирония судьбы, или С лёгким паром!) {{is set in}} Saint Petersburg and pokes fun at Soviet city planning. The 1985 film White Nights {{received}} considerable Western {{attention for}} having captured genuine Leningrad street scenes {{at a time when}} filming in the Soviet Union by Western production companies was generally unheard of. Other movies include GoldenEye (1995), Midnight in Saint Petersburg (1996), Brother (1997) and Tamil romantic thriller film-Dhaam Dhoom (2008). Onegin (1999) is based on the Pushkin poem and showcases many tourist attractions. In addition, the Russian romantic comedy, Piter FM, intricately showcases the cityscape, <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it were a main character in the film.|$|E
25|$|Mary is {{described}} by scholars as an Eleusa icon because of the tender {{manner in which the}} child is nestled against her cheek, setting the image as an intimate portrayal of the bond between mother and child. Her head is tilted towards her son and embraces his forehead and cheek <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> in a kiss, while her arms warmly cradle him. He has one leg bent and another extended towards her, while his right arm is held upright and intimately holds her chin from below. This closeness and engagement of mother and child is a departure from Byzantine tradition, where they were often shown almost at arms length, and was in tune with the ideals of the Italian Quattrocento.|$|E

25|$|Charly García and Nito Mestre {{decided it}} was time to quit Sui Generis, <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they felt the winds of change. And so their final two concerts at the Luna Park Arena took place on September 5 of that year, the most {{important}} acoustic rock band saying good-bye to 30,000 people. Historians have come to see the Sui Generis farewell concerts as the end of the 'Classic' Argentine rock era. Acoustic rock was passing into history: bands dissolved, changed their sound, and those that remained lost popularity and became only cult followings. Argentine progressive rock was on the rise, and so was the political repression to freedoms of expression. Also, several bands would leave the country for greener pastures in Europe, mostly Spain, among them Moris and Aquelarre.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms {{most often}} first appear in early {{childhood}} (the toddler stage) when children begin to walk. Though they usually start walking at a normal age, they wobble or sway when walking, standing still or sitting, and may appear <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they are drunk. In late pre-school and early school age, they develop difficulty moving their eyes in a natural manner {{from one place to}} the next (oculomotor apraxia). They develop slurred or distorted speech, and swallowing problems. Some have an increased number of respiratory tract infections (ear infections, sinusitis, bronchitis, and pneumonia). Because not all children develop in the same manner or at the same rate, it may be some years before A-T is properly diagnosed. Most children with A-T have stable neurologic symptoms for the first 4–5 years of life, but begin to show increasing problems in early school years.|$|E
25|$|An elderly cultivator, {{with several}} wives and likely several young male children, {{benefits}} {{from having a}} much larger workforce within his household. By the combined efforts of his young sons and young wives, he may gradually expand his cultivation and become more prosperous. A man with a single wife has less help in cultivation {{and is likely to}} have little or no help for felling trees. According to Boserup's historical data, women living in such a structure also welcome one or more co-wives to share with them the burden of daily labor. However, the second wife will usually do the most tiresome work, <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she were a servant to the first wife, and will be inferior to the first wife in status. A 1930s study of the Mende in the west African state of Sierra Leone concluded that a plurality of wives is an agricultural asset, since a large number of women makes it unnecessary to employ wage laborers. Polygyny is considered an economic advantage in many rural areas. In some cases, the economic role of the additional wife enables the husband to enjoy more leisure.|$|E

It's <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she didn't allocate enough time or chapters to handle all her threads".|$|E
500|$|Belenggu uses ellipses and {{internal}} monologues heavily {{to represent the}} main characters' turmoil; the Dutch scholar of Indonesian literature A. Teeuw calls it a [...] "three-pronged interior monologue", noting that the novel has minimal use of descriptive passages and dialogue. Unlike works published by Balai Pustaka, Belenggu does not provide full exposition; instead, it only explicitly states key points and leaves the rest for the reader to interpret, thus inviting more active participation. Siregar notes that the characters are introduced one at a time, <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the novel were a film; he writes that, as a result, at times the transition between characters is unclear.|$|E

500|$|It's <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if,</b> as broadcasters, we are glorying his death. The context a show is {{presented}} in will have {{a huge impact on}} how it is received, and it's always been our policy to swim against the tide and resist the policy to conform. It seems ironic—and depressing—to me that after deliberately avoiding the [...] "obvious" [...] approach in my script we are now facing a very [...] "obvious" [...] approach to the scheduling. If Victor dies at Christmas it's going to look like a naked push for ratings. The opposite is true: I want Victor's departure to be significant, but stripped of sensationalism.|$|E
500|$|Ian Inglis admires {{the song}} as [...] "one of Harrison's most {{haunting}} and mysterious compositions", and writes of the recording: [...] "The gentle, largely acoustic backing, and Harrison's achingly beautiful vocal give the song a nebulous, yearning quality, <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> something barely understood is {{slipping out of}} sight." [...] Inglis likens [...] "Be Here Now" [...] to the performance monologue [...] "Time" [...] by English actress and author Joyce Grenfell, whose conclusion that [...] "there {{is no such thing}} as time – only this very minute, and I am in it" [...] he finds echoed in Harrison's [...] "sense of wonder and helplessness in the face of the spiritual, scientific, and metaphysical implications of time".|$|E
500|$|In [...] A Child of Our Time Tippett was, in Kemp's view, wholly {{successful}} in integrating {{the language of}} the spirituals with his own musical style. Tippett had obtained recordings of American singing groups, especially the Hall Johnson Choir, which provided him with [...] a [...] model for determining the relationships between solo voices and chorus in the spirituals. [...] Thus, Kemp believes, the fourth spiritual [...] "O by and by" [...] sounds <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it had been composed by Tippett. [...] The composer's instructions in the score specify that [...] "the spirituals should not be thought of as congregational hymns, but as integral parts of the Oratorio; nor should they be sentimentalised but sung with a strong underlying beat and slightly 'swung.|$|E
