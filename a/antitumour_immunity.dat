50|$|It was {{believed}} that CD4+ T cells were not involved directly in <b>antitumour</b> <b>immunity,</b> but rather functioned simply in the priming of CD8+ T cells, through activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs) and increased antigen presentation on MHC class I, as well as secretion of excitatory cytokines such as IL-2 (Pardol and Toplain, 1998, Kalams and Walker, 1998, Wang 2001).|$|E
40|$|Cimetidine, a H 2 {{receptor}} antagonist, {{has been}} reported to improve survival in gastrointestinal cancer patients. These effects have largely been attributed to the enhancing effects of cimetidine on the host's antitumour cell-mediated immune response, such as inhibition of suppressor T lymphocyte activity, stimulation of natural killer cell activity and increase of interleukin- 2 production from helper T lymphocytes. We conducted an in vitro study on the effects of cimetidine on differentiation and antigen presenting capacity of monocyte-derived dendritic cells from advanced colorectal cancer patients and normal controls. As a result, an investigation of expression of surface molecules associated with dendritic cells by flow cytometric analyses showed that cimetidine had no enhancing effect on differentiation of dendritic cells from cancer patients and normal controls. An investigation of [3 H]thymidine incorporation by allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reactions revealed that cimetidine increased the antigen presenting capacity of dendritic cells from both materials. Moreover, a higher antigen presenting capacity was observed in advanced cancer patients compared to normal controls. These effects might be mediated via specific action of cimetidine and not via H 2 receptors because famotidine did not show similar effects. Our results suggest that cimetidine may enhance the host's <b>antitumour</b> cell-mediated <b>immunity</b> by improving the suppressed dendritic cells function of advanced cancer patients...|$|R
40|$|There {{is little}} {{evidence}} that cutaneous dendritic cells (DC), including epidermal Langerhans cells (LC), can induce immunity to UV radiation (UVR) -induced skin tumours. Here, it is shown that cells within skin can induce protective <b>antitumour</b> <b>immunity</b> against a UVR-induced fibrosarcoma. Transplantation of the skin overlying subcutaneous tumours onto naive recipients could induce protective <b>antitumour</b> <b>immunity,</b> probably because the grafting stimulated the tumour Ag-loaded DC to migrate to local lymph nodes. This suggests that cutaneous APC can present tumour Ag to induce protective <b>antitumour</b> <b>immunity.</b> Previously, {{it has been shown that}} immunization of mice with MHC class II+ epidermal cells (EC) pulsed with tumour extracts could induce delayed-type hypersensitivity against tumour cells. Here, this same immunization protocol could induce protective immunity against a minimum tumorigenic dose of UVR-induced fibrosarcoma cells, but not higher doses. Epidermal cells obtained from semiallogeneic donors and pulsed with tumour extract could also induce protective immunity. However, presentation of BSA Ag from the culture medium was found to contribute to this result using semiallogeneic EC. The results suggest that LC overlying skin tumours may be able to induce protective immunity to UVR-induced tumours if stimulated to migrate from the skin...|$|E

40|$|Exosomes (EXO) {{derived from}} {{dendritic}} cells (DC), which express {{major histocompatibility complex}} (MHC) and costimulatory molecules, {{have been used for}} antitumour vaccines. However, they are still less effective by showing only prophylatic immunity in animal models or very limited immune responses in clinical trials. In this study, we showed that ovalbumin (OVA) protein-pulsed DC (DCOVA) -derived EXO (EXOOVA) displayed MHC class I–OVA I peptide (pMHC I) complexes, CD 11 c, CD 40, CD 80, CCR 7, DEC 205, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4), TLR 9, MyD 88 and DC-SIGN molecules, but at a lower level than DCOVA. EXOOVA can be taken up by DC through LFA- 1 /CD 54 and C-type lectin/mannose (glucosamine) -rich C-type lectin receptor (CLR) interactions. Mature DC pulsed with EXOOVA, which were referred to as mDCEXO, expressed a higher level of pMHC I, MHC II, and costimulatory CD 40, CD 54 and CD 80 than DCOVA. The mDCEXO could more strongly stimulate OVA-specific CD 8 + T-cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo, and more efficiently induce OVA-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses, <b>antitumour</b> <b>immunity</b> and CD 8 + T-cell memory in vivo than EXOOVA and DCOVA. In addition, mDCEXO could also more efficiently eradicate established tumours. Therefore, mature DC pulsed with EXO may represent a new, highly effective DC-based vaccine for the induction of <b>antitumour</b> <b>immunity...</b>|$|E
40|$|Immunomodulatory therapies can {{effectively}} control haematological malignancies by promoting <b>antitumour</b> <b>immunity.</b> Previously, we reported transient growth of poorly immunogenic murine non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphomas (B-NHL) by targeting natural killer T (NKT) cells with a therapeutic vaccine approach. Therapeutic efficacy was {{highly dependent on}} the ability of the vaccine to provoke rapid interferon-gamma (IFNγ) production from NKT and NK cells. By manipulating the capacity of either host or lymphoma cells to signal through the IFNγ receptor (IFNγR), we investigated whether the therapeutic effect conferred by vaccine-induced IFNγ is a result of immune cell activation, lymphoma IFNγ sensitivity or a combination of both. We demonstrated that <b>antitumour</b> <b>immunity</b> elicited by vaccination requires IFNγ signalling within host cells but not tumour cells. IFNγR-deficient mice failed to mount an effective antitumour immune response following vaccination despite elevated IFNγ levels. With successive exposure to vaccination, lymphomas acquired an increasingly therapy-resistant phenotype and displayed a reduction in major histocompatibility complex I and CD 1 d surface expression, which is independent of tumour intrinsic IFNγ signalling. Our results suggest that immunotherapy-induced IFNγ production mainly exerts its therapeutic effect via signalling through host cells, rather than directly to tumour cells in B-NHL. This signifies that intact IFNγ signalling within patients 2 ̆ 7 immune compartment rather than tumour cell sensitivity to IFNγ is more critical for successful treatment. Finally, tumour IFNγ signalling alone does not drive acquired tumour resistance to vaccination, implying that additional immunoediting pathways are responsible for tumour immune escape...|$|E

40|$|<b>Antitumour</b> <b>immunity</b> against murine {{melanoma}} B 16 {{was achieved}} by genetic immunization with a naked chimeric DNA encoding a fusion protein linking green fluorescent protein (GFP) to the N-terminus of a major CD 8 + cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitope of tyrosinase-related protein 2 (TRP- 2181 − 188) of murine melanoma, designated as pGFP-TRP- 2. Tumour growth was profoundly suppressed in C 57 BL/ 6 mice immunized with pGFP-TRP- 2, while mice vaccinated with pTRP- 2 showed rapid tumour growth and died within 40 days after tumour challenge. Splenocytes of mice immunized with pGFP-TRP- 2 showed high CTL activity specific for TRP- 2181 − 188. GFP-TRP- 2 expressed in COS- 7 cells was rapidly degradated in vitro and the degradation was almost completely prevented by adding a proteasome inhibitor, MG- 132, in the culture. Furthermore, the antimelanoma immunity induced by genetic immunization with pGFP-TRP- 2 was completely cancelled in mice deficient in proteasome activator PA 28 α/β. Taken together, GFP-TRP- 2 processed by cytosolic proteasome {{played a central role}} in breaking peripheral tolerance to a melanoma/melanocyte antigen, TRP- 2181 − 188, by activating CD 8 + CTL specific for TRP- 2181 − 188. TRP- 2181 − 188 fused to GFP may be readily cut off from GFP by the ubiquitin-fusion degradation (UFD) pathway and efficiently presented to major histocompatibility complex class I molecules, resulting in effective induction of CD 8 + T cells specific for the CTL epitope. Furthermore, CD 4 + T cells specific for GFP were shown to play a crucial role in the antimelanoma immunity, probably potentiating activity of TRP- 2 -specific CTL and/or the ‘ubiquitin-proteasome pathway’. It is noteworthy to document that genetic immunization with pGFP plus pTRP- 2181 − 188 failed to exert the <b>antitumour</b> <b>immunity...</b>|$|E

The present study reviews the available data regarding effects of anaesthesia on tumour metastasis.

Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) is a pleiotropic cytokine with dual roles in cancer biology including prostate cancer (PCa). On the one hand, {{there is evidence}} that it stimulates tumour angiogenesis, is involved in the initiation of PCa from an androgen-dependent to a castrate resistant state, plays a role in epithelial to mesenchymal plasticity, and may contribute to the aberrant regulation of eicosanoid pathways. On the other hand, TNF has also been reported to inhibit neovascularisation, induce apoptosis of PCa cells, and stimulate <b>antitumour</b> <b>immunity.</b> Much of the confusion surrounding its seemingly paradoxical roles in cancer biology stems from the dependence of its effects on the biological model within which TNF is investigated.

40|$|AbstractOver {{the past}} decade, our {{understanding}} of cancer immunotherapy has evolved from assessing peripheral responses in the blood to monitoring changes in the tumour microenvironment.

40|$|Ligand {{stimulation}} of the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) triggers innate immune response, cytokine production and cellular immune activation in dendritic cells. However, most TLR ligands are microbial constituents, which cause inflammation and toxicity. Toxic response could be reduced for secure immunotherapy {{through the use of}} chemically synthesized ligands with defined functions. Here we create an RNA ligand for TLR 3 with no ability to activate the RIG-I/MDA 5 pathway. This TLR 3 ligand is a chimeric molecule consisting of phosphorothioate ODN-guided dsRNA (sODN-dsRNA), which elicits far less cytokine production than poly(I:C) in vitro and in vivo. The activation of TLR 3 /TICAM- 1 pathway by sODN-dsRNA effectively induces natural killer and cytotoxic T cells in tumour-loaded mice, thereby establishing <b>antitumour</b> <b>immunity.</b> Systemic cytokinemia does not occur following subcutaneous or even intraperitoneal administration of sODN-dsRNA, indicating that TICAM- 1 signalling with minute local cytokines sufficiently activate dendritic cells to prime tumoricidal effectors in vivo...|$|E

40|$|Photodynamic therapy (PDT) {{of cancer}} is an {{approved}} therapeutic procedure that generates oxidative stress leading to cell death of tumour and stromal cells. Cell death resulting from oxidative damage to intracellular components {{leads to the}} release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that trigger robust inflammatory response and creates local conditions for effective sampling of tumour-associated antigens (TAA) by antigen presenting cells. The latter can trigger development of TAA-specific adaptive immune response. However, due to a number of mechanisms, including epigenetic regulation of TAA expression, tumour cells evade immune recognition. Therefore, numerous approaches are being developed to combine PDT with immunotherapies to allow development of systemic immunity. In this review we describe immunoregulatory mechanisms of epigenetic treatments that were shown to restore the expression of epigenetically silenced or down-regulated major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules as well as TAA. We also discuss the results of our recent studies showing that epigenetic treatments based on administration of methyltransferase inhibitors in combination with photodynamic therapy can release effective mechanisms leading to development of <b>antitumour</b> <b>immunity</b> and potentiated antitumour effects...|$|E
40|$|The {{clinical}} {{relevance of}} the host immune system in breast cancer has long been unexplored. Studies developed {{over the past decade}} have highlighted the biological heterogeneity of breast cancer, prompting researchers to investigate whether the role of the immune system in this malignancy is similar across different molecular subtypes of the disease. The presence of high levels of lymphocytic infiltration has been consistently associated with a more-favourable prognosis in patients with early stage triple-negative and HER 2 -positive breast cancer. These infiltrates seem to reflect favourable host antitumour immune responses, suggesting that immune activation is important for improving survival outcomes. In this Review, we discuss the composition of the immune infiltrates observed in breast cancers, as well as data supporting the clinical relevance of host <b>antitumour</b> <b>immunity,</b> as represented by lymphocytic infiltration, and how this biomarker could be used in the clinical setting. We also discuss the rationale for enhancing immunity in breast cancer, including early data on the efficacy of T-cell checkpoint inhibition in this setting.

40|$|The {{immune system}} can both promote and {{suppress}} cancer. Chronic inflammation and proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL) - 1 and IL- 6 {{are considered to}} be tumour promoting. In contrast, the exact nature of protective <b>antitumour</b> <b>immunity</b> remains obscure. Here, we quantify locally secreted cytokines during primary immune responses against myeloma and B-cell lymphoma in mice. Strikingly, successful cancer immunosurveillance mediated by tumour-specific CD 4 (+) T cells is consistently associated with elevated local levels of both proinflammatory (IL- 1 α, IL- 1 β and IL- 6) and T helper 1 (Th 1) -associated cytokines (interferon-γ (IFN-γ), IL- 2 and IL- 12). Cancer eradication is achieved by a collaboration between tumour-specific Th 1 cells and tumour-infiltrating, antigen-presenting macrophages. Th 1 cells induce secretion of IL- 1 β and IL- 6 by macrophages. Th 1 -derived IFN-γ is shown to render macrophages directly cytotoxic to cancer cells, and to induce macrophages to secrete the angiostatic chemokines CXCL 9 /MIG and CXCL 10 /IP- 10. Thus, inflammation, when driven by tumour-specific Th 1 cells, may prevent rather than promote cancer...|$|E

Moreover, fucoidan exhibited low affinity for bFGF and could not block the binding of bFGF to heparan sulphated. Although fucoidan had no effect on angiogenesis and apoptosis in vivo, this drug significantly inhibited the tumour growth and the expression of PCNA.

40|$|Immunosuppressive cells, mainly myeloid-derived {{suppressor}} cells (MDSCs) and T regulatory cells, downregulate <b>antitumour</b> <b>immunity</b> {{and cancer}} immunotherapy. MDSCs are a heterogeneous group of immature myeloid cells that negatively regulate the immune responses during tumour progression, inflammation and infection. Whilst {{there have been}} extensive laboratory investigations aimed at characterising the MDSC subsets in cancer, there remains a significant gap {{in our understanding of}} their phenotypical and functional heterogeneity. In this article, we review data concerning the phenotypical and functional role of MDSCs in cancers. Importantly, we analyse the value of MDSCs as a prognostic factor in various clinical settings and the possible therapeutic approaches towards elimination of their immunosuppressive activity and enhancement of beneficial antitumour immune responses. MDSCs promote tumour immune evasion by inhibiting T-cell responses, as well as by supporting tumour progression. Accumulation of MDSCs is associated with the progression of human cancers, and their elimination was shown to improve anti-tumour immune responses. Phenotypical characterisation of MDSCs has been poorly investigated in many human cancers and lacks comprehensive clinicopathological correlation data. Although the need for effective therapeutic agents to eliminate the MDSC suppressive effect is immense, their role has been examined only in a few clinical settings...|$|E

40|$|Immunostimulatory {{sequences}} (ISS) {{that contain}} CpG motifs {{have been demonstrated}} to exert antipathogen and <b>antitumour</b> <b>immunity</b> in animal models through several mechanisms, including the activation of natural killer (NK) cells to secrete interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and to exert lytic activity. Since NK cells lack the ISS receptor TLR 9, the exact pathway by which NK cells are activated by ISS is unclear. We determined that ISS-induced IFN-γ from NK cells is primarily dependent upon IFN-α release from plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDCs), which directly activates the NK cell. However, further analysis indicated that other PDC-released soluble factor(s) may contribute to IFN-γ induction. Indeed, tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) {{was identified as a}} significant contributor to ISS-mediated activation of NK cells and was observed to act in an additive fashion with IFN-α in the induction of IFN-γ from NK cells and to up-regulate CD 69 expression on NK cells. This activity of TNF-α, however, was dependent upon the presence of PDC-derived factors such as type I interferon. These results illustrate an important function for type I interferon in innate immunity, which is not only to activate effectors like NK cells directly, but also to prime them for enhanced activation by other factors such as TNF-α...|$|E

In this study we investigated cell survival to single treatments or combination of X-rays and temozolomide in glioblastoma cell lines (T 98 G and U 251 MG) and we attempted to identify danger signals (HMGB 1 and HSP 70) released by dying cells in the microenvironment that could activate <b>antitumour</b> <b>immunity</b> contributing to the therapeutic efficacy of conventional treatments. Our data suggest that HSP 70 translocates from cytoplasm to extracellular environment after an increase in radiation dose and HMGB 1 translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and subsequently is released into the extracellular space, confirming a role of these proteins as signals released after radiation-induced damage in glioblastoma cells. We also could state that TMZ had limited effectiveness in activating HMGB 1 and HSP 70 signalling and, instead, an adjuvant effect was observed in some combined treatments, depending on schedule, cell line, and timing.

40|$|The {{generation}} of <b>antitumour</b> <b>immunity</b> {{depends on the}} nature of dendritic cell (DC) -tumour interactions. These have been studied mostly by using in vitro-derived DC which may not reflect the natural biology of DC in vivo. In breast cancer, only one report has compared blood DC at different stages and no longitudinal evaluation has been performed. Here we conducted three cross-sectional and one one-year longitudinal assessments of blood DC in patients with early (stage I/II, n= 137) and advanced (stage IV, n= 36) disease compared to healthy controls (n= 66). Patients with advanced disease exhibit markedly reduced blood DC counts at diagnosis. Patients with early disease show minimally reduced counts at diagnosis but a prolonged period (1 year) of marked DC suppression after tumour resection. While differing in frequency, DC from both patients with early and advanced disease exhibit reduced expression of CD 86 and HLA-DR and decreased immunostimulatory capacities. Finally, by comparing a range of clinically available maturation stimuli, we demonstrate that conditioning with soluble CD 40 L induces the highest level of maturation and improved T-cell priming. We conclude that although circulating DC are compromised by loco-regional and systemic breast cancer, they respond vigorously to ex vivo conditioning, thus enhancing their immunostimulatory capacity and potential for immunotherapy.

40|$|Background High {{quantities}} of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in primary HER 2 -positive breast cancer {{are associated with}} improved prognosis and response to therapy. We aimed to investigate the prognostic role of host <b>antitumour</b> <b>immunity</b> as represented by baseline {{quantities of}} TILs in patients with advanced HER 2 -positive breast cancer treated with either pertuzumab or placebo in addition to trastuzumab and docetaxel. Methods CLEOPATRA was a randomised phase 3 study comparing the addition of either pertuzumab or placebo to first-line therapy with trastuzumab and docetaxel for patients with locally recurrent, unresectable, or metastatic HER 2 -positive breast cancer. We assessed the quantity of stromal TILs in prospectively collected tumour samples and investigated their association with progression-free survival, overall survival, clinicopathological characteristics, and pertuzumab treatment. We estimated hazard ratios (HR) and 95 % CIs with multivariate Cox regression models fitting stromal TILs as a continuous variable (per 10 % increment). The CLEOPATRA trial is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT 00567190. Findings Tumour samples from 678 (84 %) of 808 participants were evaluable for TILs, including 519 (77 %) archival samples, 155 (23 %) freshly obtained samples (collected 45 days or fewer before randomisation), and four samples of unknown archival status. Median follow-up was 50 months (IQR 41 – 54) for progression-free survival and 51 months (IQR 46 – 57) for overall survival. 519 progression-free survival events occurred and 358 patients died. The median TIL value was 10 % (IQR 5 – 30). Freshly obtained tumour samples had significantly lower TIL values than did archival samples (10 · 00 % [95 % CI 5 · 00 – 20 · 00] vs 15 · 00 % [5 · 00 – 35 · 00]; p= 0 · 00036). We detected no significant association between TIL values and progression-free survival (adjusted HR 0 · 95, 95 % CI 0 · 90 – 1 · 00, p= 0 · 063). However, for overall survival, each 10 % increase in stromal TILs {{was significantly associated with}} longer overall survival (adjusted HR 0 · 89, 95 % CI 0 · 83 – 0 · 96, p= 0 · 0014). The treatment effect of pertuzumab did not differ significantly by stromal TIL value for either progression-free survival (pinteraction= 0 · 23) or overall survival (pinteraction= 0 · 21). Interpretation In patients with advanced HER 2 -positive breast cancer treated with docetaxel, trastuzumab, and pertuzumab or placebo, higher TIL values are significantly associated with improved overall survival, suggesting that the effect of <b>antitumour</b> <b>immunity</b> extends to the advanced setting. Future clinical studies in this cancer subtype should consider TILs as a stratification factor and investigate whether therapies that can augment immunity could potentially further improve survival.

In this study, we investigated the phenotypic profile of TINK cells based on the expression of the NK-cell maturation markers CD 11 b and CD 27. Interestingly, we found a substantial CD 11 b 2 CD 272 (DN) NK-cell population harboured within the tumour tissues. The presence of this CD 11 b 2 CD 272 NK subset indicated that the TINK cells were of an immature and inactive phenotype. Remarkably, we determined that the presence of DN NK cells had an impact on the clinical outcomes of patients with NSCLC, as the frequency of tumour-infiltrating DN NK cells was positively correlated with the tumour stage and tumour size. We further used a murine Lewis lung cancer (LLC) model to confirm the correlation between the frequency of tumour-infiltrating DN NK cells and the progression of lung carcinoma. Together, our findings demonstrate that the tumour microenvironment may render TINK cells less tumouricidal and thereby contribute to cancer progression...|$|E
40|$|MAGE-A 4 {{has been}} {{considered}} as an attractive cancer-testis (CT) antigen for tumour immunotherapy. It has been well accepted that T-helper type 1 (Th 1) cell-dominant immunity is critical for the successful induction of <b>antitumour</b> <b>immunity</b> in a tumour-bearing host. The adoptive Th 1 cell therapy {{has been shown to}} be an attractive strategy for inducing tumour eradication in mouse systems. However, Th 1 -cell therapy using human tumour-specific Th 1 cells, which were expanded from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in a clinically useful protocol, has never been performed. Here, we first identified MAGE-A 4 -derived promiscuous helper epitope, peptide (MAGE-A 4 280 – 299), bound to both HLA-DPB 1 * 0501 and DRB 1 * 1403. Using the peptide, we established a suitable protocol for the propagation of MAGE-A 4 -specific Th 1 cells in vitro. Culture of CD 4 + T cells with IFN-γ-treated PBMC-derived adherent cells in the presence of helper epitope peptide resulted in a great expansion of MAGE-A 4 -reactive Th cells producing IFN-γ, but not IL- 4. Moreover, it was shown that ligation of MAGE-A 4 -reactive Th 1 cells with the cognate peptide caused the production of IFN-γ and IL- 2. Thus, our identified MAGE-A 4 helper epitope peptide will become a good tool for the propagation of tumour-specific Th 1 cells applicable to adoptive immunotherapy of human cancer...|$|E
40|$|Cytokine-driven {{signalling}} shapes immune homeostasis {{and guides}} inflammatory responses mainly through induction of specific gene expression programmes {{both within and}} outside the immune cell compartment. These transcriptional outputs are often amplified via cytokine synergy, which sets a stimulatory threshold that safeguards from exacerbated inflammation and immunopathology. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underpinning synergy between two pivotal Th 1 cytokines, IFN-γ and TNF-α, in human intestinal epithelial cells. These two proinflammatory mediators induce a unique state of signalling and transcriptional synergy implicated in processes such as antiviral and <b>antitumour</b> <b>immunity,</b> intestinal barrier and pancreatic β-cell dysfunction. Since its discovery more than 30 years ago, this biological phenomenon remains, however, only partially defined. Here, using a functional genomics approach including RNAi perturbation screens and small-molecule inhibitors, we identified two new regulators of IFN-γ/TNF-α-induced chemokine and antiviral gene and protein expression, a Bcl- 2 protein BCL-G and a histone demethylase UTX. We also discovered that IFN-γ/TNF-α synergise to trigger a coordinated shutdown of major receptor tyrosine kinases expression in colon cancer cells. Together, these findings extend our current understanding of how IFN-γ/TNF-α synergy elicits qualitatively and quantitatively distinct outputs in the intestinal epithelium. Given the well-documented role of this synergistic state in immunopathology of various disorders, our results may help to inform the identification of high quality and biologically relevant druggable targets for diseases characterised by an IFN-γ/TNF-α high immune signatur...|$|E
40|$|Immunogenic {{profile of}} certain cancer cell death {{mechanisms}} has been transmuted by research published {{over a period}} of last few years and this change has been so drastic that a new (sub) class of apoptotic cancer cell death, redefined as ‘immunogenic apoptosis’ has started taking shape. In fact, {{it has been shown that}} this chemotherapeutic agent-specific immunogenic cancer cell death modality has the capabilities to induce ‘anticancer vaccine effect’, in vivo. These new trends have given an opportunity to combine tumour cell kill and <b>antitumour</b> <b>immunity</b> within a single paradigm, a sort of ‘holy grail’ of anticancer therapeutics. At the molecular level, it has been shown that the immunological silhouette of these cell death pathways is defined by a set of molecules called ‘damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) ’. Various intracellular molecules like calreticulin (CRT), heat-shock proteins (HSPs), high-mobility group box- 1 (HMGB 1) protein, have been shown to be DAMPs exposed/secreted in a stress agent/factor-and cell death-specific manner. These discoveries have motivated further research into discovery of new DAMPs, new pathways for their exposure/secretion, search for new agents capable of inducing immunogenic cell death and urge to solve currently present problems with this paradigm. We anticipate that this emerging amalgamation of DAMPs, immunogenic cell death and anticancer therapeutics may be the key towards squelching cancer-related mortalities, in near future...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAutophagy, a catabolic {{mechanism}} that involves degradation of cellular components, {{is essential for}} cell homeostasis. Although autophagy favours the lineage stability of regulatory T cells, the contribution of autophagy to the differentiation of effector CD 4 T cells remains unclear. Here we show that autophagy selectively represses T helper 9 (TH 9) cell differentiation. CD 4 T cells lacking Atg 3 or Atg 5 have increased interleukin- 9 (IL- 9) expression upon differentiation into TH 9 cells relative to Atg 3 - or Atg 5 -expressing control cells. In addition, the TH 9 cell transcription factor, PU. 1, undergoes K 63 ubiquitination and degradation through p 62 -dependent selective autophagy. Finally, the blockade of autophagy enhances TH 9 cell anticancer functions in vivo, and mice with T cell-specific deletion of Atg 5 have reduced tumour outgrowth in an IL- 9 -dependent manner. Overall, our findings reveal an unexpected function of autophagy in the modulation of TH 9 cell differentiation and antitumour activity, and prompt potential autophagy-dependent modulations of TH 9 activity for cancer immunotherapy. Autophagy is a cellular process for recycling cell constituents, and is essential for T cell activation, but its function in T cell polarization is still unclear. Here the authors show that autophagy induces the degradation of transcription factor PU. 1 to negatively modulate TH 9 homeostasis and <b>antitumour</b> <b>immunity...</b>|$|E
40|$|Regulatory T-cells (Tregs) {{constitute}} a small subset of cells involved in <b>antitumour</b> <b>immunity</b> and are generally increased {{in patients with}} chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). No data is available on Tregs in monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL), a disease entity characterized by less than 5000 /microL circulating clonal B-cells in absence of other features of lymphoproliferative disorders. We used multicolour flow cytometry to evaluate the number of circulating Tregs in 56 patients with "clinical" MBL, 74 patients with previously untreated CLL and 40 healthy subjects. MBL patients showed a lower absolute number of Tregs, compared to CLL patients, but slightly higher than controls. Moreover, the absolute cell number of Tregs directly correlated both with more advanced Rai/Binet clinical stages and peripheral blood B-cell lymphocytosis. Of note, the absolute number of Tregs was found lower in MBL patients than in CLL patients staged as 0 /A Rai/Binet. The study showed that Treg increase gradually from normal subjects to "clinical" MBL patients and are significantly higher in CLL patients as compared to MBL patients. Moreover, a significant direct relationship was found between higher Treg values and a higher tumor burden expressed by B-lymphocytosis or more advanced clinical stages. In light of this data, MBL {{seems to be a}} preliminary phase preceding CLL. The progressive increase of Treg numbers might contribute both to the clinical evolution of MBL to overt CLL and to CLL progression...|$|E
