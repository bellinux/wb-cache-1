As in his time there was great famine and distress, the Swedes made great offerings of sacrifice at Upsal. [...] The first autumn they sacrificed oxen, but the succeeding season was not improved thereby. The following autumn they sacrificed men, but the succeeding year was rather worse. The third autumn, when the offer of sacrifices should begin, a great multitude of Swedes came to Upsal; and now the chiefs held consultations with each other, and all agreed that the times of scarcity were on account of their king Domald, and they resolved to offer him for good seasons, and to assault and kill him, <b>and</b> <b>sprinkle</b> the stalle of the gods with his blood. And they did so.|$|E

2500|$|While hosting Tubridy Tonight, {{he spoke}} of the public's {{perception}} of him, saying: [...] "I think I am a victim of my own image. I think it's been cultivated by others for me. I live in a very ordinary semi-detached house. People only ever see me on a Saturday night on TV and I'm in a smart suit with a book-lined backdrop so that's what they think – you're Johnny smart suit with a book-lined backdrop." [...] Referring to the type of woman he would like, Tubridy said: [...] "I like intelligence, I like a good conversation. I like elegance, I like a girl who is feminine without being vain, I like a little retro in terms of fashion and look <b>and</b> <b>sprinkle</b> it with a little sense of humour. I also love a girl who appreciates darkness. I'm a lot darker than people think – plenty of dark humour." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the second}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), {{a person who}} was clean was to add fresh water to ashes of the Red Cow, dip hyssop it in the water, <b>and</b> <b>sprinkle</b> the water on the tent, the vessels, and people who had become unclean. The person who {{sprinkled}} the water was then to wash his clothes, bathe in water, and be clean at nightfall. Anyone who became unclean and failed to cleanse himself was to be cut off from the congregation. The person who sprinkled the water of lustration was to wash his clothes, and whoever touched the water of lustration, whatever he touched, and whoever touched him were to be unclean until evening. The Israelites arrived at Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin, and Miriam died and was buried there. The people were without water, and they complained against Moses and Aaron. Moses and Aaron fell on their faces at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, and the Presence of God appeared to them.|$|E
2500|$|Historical records {{indicate}} that {{the blessing of the}} waters events took place at the courts of Moscow Czars since no later than 1525. According to historians, the blessing of the waters procession was the most magnificent of the annual Czar's court's ceremonies, comparable only to such special events as royal coronations and weddings. After a divine liturgy [...] in the Kremlin's Dormition Cathedral, the procession, led by the Czar and the Patriarch of Moscow would proceed to the frozen Moscow River. A small gazebo, called Iordan', would have been erected on the ice and decorated with holy icons, one of which would depict the Baptism of Christ. The Patriarch would immerse his cross into the river's water; <b>and</b> <b>sprinkle</b> the Czar, his boyars, and the banners of Czar's army's regiments with the holy water. A load of holy water would then be brought back to the Kremlin, to be used in blessing the Czar's palace. On a smaller scale, similar events would take place in the parishes throughout the nation.|$|E

The Mishnah taught that a donkey could {{go out with a}} saddle cushion tied to it, rams strapped, ewes covered, and goats with their udders tied. Rabbi Jose forbade all these, except covering ewes. Rabbi Judah allowed goats to go out with their udders tied to dry, but not to save their milk. The Mishnah taught that animals could not go out with a pad tied to their tails. A driver could not tie camels together and pull one of them, but a driver could take the leads of several camels in hand and pull them. The Mishnah prohibited donkeys with untied cushions, bells, ladder–shaped yokes, or thongs around their feet; fowls with ribbons or leg straps; rams with wagons; ewes protected by wood chips in their noses; calves with little yokes; and cows with hedgehog skins or straps between their horns. The Mishnah reported that Rabbi Eleazar ben Azariah's cow used to go out with a thong between its horns, but without the consent of the Rabbis.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the first}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), God told Moses and Aaron to {{instruct}} the Israelites regarding the ritual {{law of the}} Red Cow ( [...] , parah adumah) used to create the water of [...] The cow was to be without blemish, have no defect, and not have borne a yoke. Eleazar the priest was to take it outside the camp, observe its slaughter, and take some of its blood with his finger <b>and</b> <b>sprinkle</b> it seven times toward the Tabernacle. The cow was to be burned in its entirety along with cedar wood, hyssop, and crimson stuff. The priest {{and the one who}} burned the cow were both to wash their garments, bathe in water, and be unclean until evening. The ashes of the cow were to be used to create the water of lustration. One who touched the corpse of any human being was to be unclean for seven days. On the third and seventh days, the person who had touched the corpse was to cleanse with the water of lustration and then be clean. One who failed to do so would remain unclean, would defile the Tabernacle, and would be cut off from Israel. When a person died in a tent, whoever entered the tent was to be unclean seven days, and every open vessel in the tent was to be unclean. In the open, anyone who touched a corpse, bone, or a grave was to be unclean seven days.|$|E
2500|$|The Ruizes' {{backyard}} shrine was {{an established}} pilgrimage site from 1989—1998. [...] Ruiz {{appeared on the}} Geraldo Rivera Show and on the Sally Jessy Raphaël Show in the early 1990s and since then has traveled extensively to share her experiences. [...] As a result, the shrine {{became one of the}} most frequented sites of the 1990s. [...] The family also celebrates the anniversary of the first apparition, a celebration that has changed over time. [...] While clergy have always been involved with the family and the phenomenon, the Church has become more involved over time as the shrine and Mary's Ministries have become more institutional. [...] A procession was instituted in 1990, during which processioners carry holy images, statues, and crosses, sing hymns, <b>and</b> <b>sprinkle</b> holy water in the crime-ridden streets of South Phoenix. [...] The hearing of confessions began in the early 1990s, and Mass and the Eucharist began in 1998. [...] Attendance at the yearly celebration grew, peaking at about one thousand for the reading of the final message in 1998. [...] Afterwards, the shrine was converted into an enclosed chapel, and the yard surrounding it was fenced in. [...] Instead of being open to the community at all times, where it was one of the few neutral zones for South Phoenix's gangs, the chapel is now only open at certain hours. [...] And since the final message, the yearly celebration has become more of a retreat for Mary's Ministries members, although the Matachina dancers who attended the first celebration and performed for the Virgin of Guadalupe still attend.|$|E
2500|$|Bonfires {{continued}} to be {{a key part of the}} festival in the modern era. All hearth fires and candles would be doused before the bonfire was lit, generally on a mountain or hill. Ronald Hutton writes that [...] "To increase the potency of the holy flames, in Britain at least they were often kindled by the most primitive of all means, of friction between wood." [...] In the 19th century, for example, John Ramsay described Scottish Highlanders kindling a need-fire or force-fire at Beltane. Such a fire was deemed sacred. In the 19th century, the ritual of driving cattle between two fires—as described in Sanas Cormaic almost 1000 years before—was still practised across most of Ireland and in parts of Scotland. Sometimes the cattle would be driven [...] "around" [...] a bonfire or be made to leap over flames or embers. The people themselves would do likewise. In the Isle of Man, people ensured that the smoke blew over them and their cattle. When the bonfire had died down, people would daub themselves with its ashes <b>and</b> <b>sprinkle</b> it over their crops and livestock. Burning torches from the bonfire would be taken home, where they would be carried around the house or boundary of the farmstead and would be used to re-light the hearth. From these rituals, it is clear that the fire was seen as having protective powers. Similar rituals were part of May Day, Midsummer or Easter customs in other parts of the British Isles and mainland Europe. According to Frazer, the fire rituals are a kind of imitative or sympathetic magic. According to one theory, they were meant to mimic the Sun and to [...] "ensure a needful supply of sunshine for men, animals, and plants". According to another, they were meant to symbolically [...] "burn up and destroy all harmful influences".|$|E
