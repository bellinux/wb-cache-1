40|$|Change is {{not always}} noticed. This article {{documents}} changes in attitude and practice about the propriety of resolving cases in groups—as part of one 2 ̆ 2 litigation. 2 ̆ 2 Over the past three decades, the <b>aggregation</b> <b>of</b> civil cases (briefly—the bringing together <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> <b>of</b> different individuals {{to prepare them for}} trial, other adjudication, or settlement) has moved from being the exceptional and specially justified event to the more ordinary and expected response whenever patterns of similar cases appear in the federal courts. The 2 ̆ 2 asbestos litigation, 2 ̆ 2 the 2 ̆ 2 DuPont Fire litigation, 2 ̆ 2 the 2 ̆ 2 Agent Orange Litigation 2 ̆ 2 —these are now all phrases that sound familiar and that prepare us for whatever the next product liability, toxic tort, antitrust, savings and loan, or other group 2 ̆ 2 litigation 2 ̆ 2 will be. I am interested {{in the history of the}} movement—from 2 ̆ 2 cases 2 ̆ 2 to 2 ̆ 2 litigation 2 ̆ 2 —and in the impact of aggregate litigation on the conception of what the work of the federal judiciary ought to be. In this article, I have five central points to make. First, participants and commentators have changed their attitudes substantially over the last three decades about the propriety of cases proceeding in the aggregate. Second, the change in attitude dovetails with changing practices, both formal and informal, that enable much more aggregative processing in federal courts than a few decades ago. Third, aggregation has been promoted as a means <b>of</b> enabling <b>claims</b> that would otherwise not be pursued or as a means of expediting cases already filed. Forms <b>of</b> <b>aggregation</b> <b>claimed</b> 2 ̆ 2 only 2 ̆ 2 to expedite pending claims are perceived to be less politically charged and have been more readily accepted than those aimed at enabling claims. However, these two functions <b>of</b> <b>aggregation</b> are not so distinct in practice, and both have political impact. Fourth, the increase in aggregative processing has changed the way in which cases about individuals are viewed and has influenced contemporary debates about the allocation of authority between state and federal courts and Article III and Article I judges. Fifth, aggregation poses a challenge to the civil justice system, which has been largely animated by individual <b>claims</b> <b>of</b> wrongdoing, to which government-empowered judges and juries respond in a relatively visible and litigant-specific way. Subsequent essays will address many of the issues raised by aggregation—the lessons to be drawn about procedural rulemaking from the array <b>of</b> techniques for <b>aggregation,</b> the impact <b>of</b> <b>aggregation</b> on the course of lawsuits, on the relations among clients, attorneys, insurance companies, and courts, on the institutional activities of courts and auxiliary personnel, on public access to court-based decisionmaking, and on the import of individually-based case disposition...|$|R

In Wholesale Justice, Professor Redish provides a thorough analysis of the constitutional implications of the class action mechanism. Unlike prior commentators and courts, which have focused mainly on limited constitutional issues arising in class action cases, Professor Redish’s analysis sweeps more broadly. In the process, he brings to bear principles of constitutional law that have long lain dormant in the field of class action practice. His insights demonstrate that more than mere practical or policy concerns arise when class action procedures are used. Rather, they implicate—and often infringe—fundamental principles of constitutional law...|$|E
40|$|Shortly {{after the}} tragic events of September 11, 2001, Congress passed the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act (ATSSSA). The September 11 th Victim Compensation Fund (VCF) was the {{centerpiece}} of the statute and provided a source of no-fault compensation to the tragedy’s victims and victims’ families. The ATSSSA also allowed victims to elect to pursue traditional litigation instead. The ATSSSA contains three jurisdictional features that have shaped the path of the litigation. The Act created a federal cause of action “for damages arising out of” the terrorist related aircraft crashes; it gave the Southern District of New York original and exclusive jurisdiction over all actions “resulting from or relating to the terrorist-related aircraft crashes. ” Finally, it implemented a liability cap by limiting recovery in all actions to the defendants’ available liability insurance. These jurisdictional aspects of the “traditional” litigation option under the ATSSSA contain unusual and practically unprecedented elements, yet they have received almost no scholarly attention. This Article attempts to fill that gap by telling the story of the course of the September 11 th litigation, tracking the challenges and issues that have arisen {{as a result of the}} ATSSSA coordination mandate, and exploring the relationship between federalization of forum and <b>aggregation</b> <b>of</b> <b>claims.</b> The jurisdictional puzzles seen in the September 11 th litigation call for two new labels. “Event jurisdiction” refers to Congress’s choice to give the federal courts subject matter jurisdiction over an “event” of perceived national importance, rather than locating subject matter jurisdiction over a certain class of cases or type of claim. The second phenomenon deserves the label “protective coordination” because, like protective jurisdiction, it evinces a congressional desire to protect certain real or perceived federal interests by manipulating the shape and direction of certain classes of lawsuits. The Article concludes by suggesting how Congress might better evaluate post-disaster litigation legislation in the future...|$|E
40|$|Tort {{claims against}} gun {{manufacturers}} call on judges to make policy choices about firearm design and marketing. There is much {{debate over whether}} judges {{should be in the}} business of making policy choices. On one hand, traditionalists denounce judicial policy making as violating the constitutional separation of powers which reserves policy making to legislatures and consigns courts to resolving individual disputes between parties. Moreover, according to this view, courts lack the breadth of perspective necessary to make good public policy, a breadth that legislatures achieve through initiating investigations or holding hearings. In addition, courts of general jurisdiction lack the technical and scientific expertise that administrative agencies lend to legislative policy making. On the other hand, progressives embrace judicial policy making as part of a public law vision of the tort system. According to this view, courts should craft creative solutions to social problems when deadlocked or corrupt legislatures fail to act. Furthermore, by using procedural techniques that allow for the consolidation of many claims into one legal proceeding, courts can resolve individual claims en masse, thereby avoiding the possible inconsistencies and inefficiencies of piecemeal adjudication on a case-by-case basis. In this chapter, I advocate an intermediate position. I argue that courts should play a secondary role in policy making that complements the regulatory efforts of legislatures and administrative agencies. Against the traditionalist position, I assert that judges are wise in attending to the public policy implications of their rulings in individual cases. The nature of common law adjudication is to apply old legal principles to new problems. The proper application of these principles, however, is often unclear, and judges are required to resolve ambiguities on the basis of something other than clear precedent. It is here that policy analysis plays a legitimate role in judging. Against the progressive position, I argue that courts should confine their policy analysis to the resolution of doctrinal ambiguities. Courts should use policy analysis to gradually refine tort law 2 ̆ 7 s system of rules for resolving private disputes in ways that serve the public interest. Radical shifts in doctrine, even when supported by sound policy choices, undermine the legal stability that in our constitutional scheme courts are uniquely qualified to protect. Furthermore, I argue that in making policy choices, courts should, where possible, follow the lead of legislatures. To the extent that there are discernable trends in legislative consideration of a problem, it undermines the legitimacy of judicial decision making for judges to contradict them. The danger of unrestrained judicial policy making is greatest in mass torts, where the <b>aggregation</b> <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> and industry-wide liability exposure can easily transform the resolution of private disputes into the crafting of innovative solutions to social problems, without due regard for doctrinal integrity or legislative preferences...|$|E

40|$|Procedural Justice {{offers a}} theory of {{procedural}} fairness for civil dispute resolution. The Article begins in Part I, Introduction, with two observations. First, the function of procedure is to particularize general substantive norms {{so that they can}} guide action. Second, the hard problem of procedural justice corresponds to the following question: How can we regard ourselves as obligated by legitimate authority to comply with a judgment that we believe (or even know) to be in error with respect to the substantive merits? This Article responds to the challenge posed by the hard question of procedural justice. That theory is developed in several stages, beginning with some preliminary questions and problems. The first question - what is procedure? - is the most difficult and requires an extensive answer: Part II, Substance and Procedure, defines the subject of the inquiry by offering a new theory of the distinction between substance and procedure that acknowledges the entanglement of the action-guiding roles of substantive and procedural rules while preserving the distinction between two ideal types of rules. Part III, The Foundations of Procedural Justice, lays out the premises of general jurisprudence that ground the theory and answers a series of objections to the notion that the search for {{a theory of}} procedural justice is a worthwhile enterprise. These two sections {{set the stage for the}} more difficult work of constructing a theory of procedural legitimacy. Part IV, Views of Procedural Justice, investigates the theories of procedural fairness found explicitly or implicitly in case law and commentary. After a preliminary inquiry that distinguishes procedural justice from other forms of justice, Part IV focuses on three models or theories. The first theory, the accuracy model, assumes that the aim of civil dispute resolution is correct application of the law to the facts. The second theory, the balancing model, assumes that the aim of civil procedure is to strike a fair balance between the costs and benefits of adjudication. The third theory, the participation model, assumes that the very idea of a correct outcome must be understood as a function of process that guarantees fair and equal participation. In Part V, The Value of Participation, the lessons learned from analysis and critique of the three models are then applied to the question whether a right of participation can be justified for reasons that are not reducible to either its effect on the accuracy or its effect on the cost of adjudication. The most important result of Part V is the Participatory Legitimacy Thesis: it is (usually) a condition for the fairness of a procedure that those who are to be finally bound shall have a reasonable opportunity to participate in the proceedings. The central normative thrust of Procedural Justice is developed in Part VI, Principles of Procedural Justice. The first principle, the Participation Principle, stipulates a minimum (and minimal) right of participation, in the form of notice and an opportunity to be heard, that must be satisfied (if feasible) in order for a procedure to be considered fair. The second principle, the Accuracy Principle, specifies the achievement of legally correct outcomes as the criterion for measuring procedural fairness, subject to four provisos, each of which sets out circumstances under which a departure from the goal of accuracy is justified by procedural fairness itself. In Part VII, The Problem of Aggregation, the Participation Principle and the Accuracy Principle are applied to the central problem of contemporary civil procedure - the <b>aggregation</b> <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> in mass litigation.

Recent evidence indicates that accumulation and <b>aggregation</b> <b>of</b> intracellular amyloid β peptides may {{also play a role}} in disease pathogenesis. This would suggest that intracellular Heat Shock Proteins (HSP) that maintain cellular protein homeostasis might be candidates for disease amelioration. We recently found that DNAJB 6, a member of DNAJ family of heat shock proteins, effectively prevented the <b>aggregation</b> <b>of</b> short aggregation-prone peptides containing large poly glutamines (associated with CAG repeat diseases) both in vitro and in cells. Moreover, recent in vitro data showed that DNAJB 6 can delay the <b>aggregation</b> <b>of</b> Aβ 42 peptides.

As various capping agents are used as coatings for nanoparticles and NOM are natural polymer mixture with wide molecular weight (MW) distribution, probing the particle coating-dependent interaction of MW fractionated natural organic matter (M-f-NOM) with various coatings is helpful for understanding the differential aggregation and transport behavior of engineered AgNPs as well as other metal nanoparticles. In this study, we investigated the role of pristine and M-f-NOM on the <b>aggregation</b> <b>of</b> AgNPs with Bare, citrate, and PVP coating (Bare-, Cit-, and PVP-AgNP) in mono- and divalent electrolyte solutions. We observed that the enhanced <b>aggregation</b> or dispersion <b>of</b> AgNPs in NOM solution highly depends on the coating of AgNPs.

For PVP- and Bare-AgNPs, the stability of AgNPs in electrolyte solution was significantly correlated to the MW of M-f-NOM. But for Cit-AgNPs, pristine NOM and M-f-NOM has minor influence on the stability of AgNPs. These findings about significantly different roles <b>of</b> M-f-NOM on <b>aggregation</b> <b>of</b> engineered AgNPs with various coating are important for better understanding of the transport and subsequent transformation of AgNPs in aquatic environment...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effects of}} ionic {{strength}} and cationic valency of the fluid medium {{on the surface}} potential and dextran-induced <b>aggregation</b> <b>of</b> red blood cells (RBC's) were investigated. The zeta potential was calculated from cell mobility in a microelectrophoresis apparatus; the degree <b>of</b> <b>aggregation</b> <b>of</b> normal and neuraminidase-treated RBC's in dextrans (Dx 40 and Dx 80) was quantified by microscopic observation, measurement of erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and determination of low-shear viscosity. A decrease in ionic strength caused a reduction in <b>aggregation</b> <b>of</b> normal RBC's in dextrans, but {{had no effect on}} the <b>aggregation</b> <b>of</b> neuraminidase-treated RBC's. These findings reflect an increase in electrostatic repulsive force between normal RBC's by the reduction in ionic strength due to (a) a decrease in the screening of surface charge by counter-ions and (b) an increase in the thickness of the electric double layer. Divalent cations (Ca + +, Mg ++, and Ba++) increased <b>aggregation</b> <b>of</b> normal RBC's in dextrans, but had no effect on the <b>aggregation</b> <b>of</b> neuraminidase-treated RBC's. These effects of the divalent cations are attributable to a decrease in surface potential of normal RBC's and a shrinkage of the electric double layer. It is concluded that the surface charge of RBC's plays a significant role in cell-to-cell interactions...|$|R

40|$|Properties {{related with}} {{aggregation}} operators functions {{have been widely}} studied in literature. Nevertheless, few efforts have been dedicated to analyze those properties related with the family of operators in a global way. What should be the relationship {{among the members of}} a family <b>of</b> <b>aggregation</b> operators? Is it possible to build the <b>aggregation</b> <b>of</b> n data with <b>aggregation</b> operators <b>of</b> lower dimension? Should it exist some consistency in the family <b>of</b> <b>aggregation</b> operators? In this work, we analyze two properties of consistency in a family <b>of</b> <b>aggregation</b> operators: Stability and Structural Relevance. The stability property for a family <b>of</b> <b>aggregation</b> operators tries to force a family to have a stable/continuous definition {{in the sense that the}} <b>aggregation</b> <b>of,,</b> items should be similar to the <b>aggregation</b> <b>of</b> n + 1 items if the last item is the <b>aggregation</b> <b>of</b> the previous n items. Following this idea some definitions and results are given. The second concept presented in this work is related with the construction <b>of</b> the <b>aggregation</b> operator when the data that have to be aggregated has an inherent structure. The Structural Relevance property tries to give some ideas about the construction <b>of</b> the <b>aggregation</b> operator when the items are related by means of a graph...|$|R
40|$|A {{computational}} scheme {{using the}} Chimera grid method is presented for simulation of three-dimensional motion and <b>aggregation</b> <b>of</b> two {{red blood cells}} (RBCs) in a narrow tube. The cells are modelled as rigid ellipsoidal particles; the computational scheme is applicable to deformable fluid-filled particles. Attractive energy between two RBCs is modelled by a depletion interaction theory and used for simulating <b>aggregation</b> <b>of</b> two cells. Through the simulation, we show that the Chimera grid method is applicable to the simulation of three-dimensional motion and <b>aggregation</b> <b>of</b> multiple RBCs in a microvessel an...|$|R
