If the release would be most beneficial when the batter is forming, citric acid would be ideal because it is fast acting.

Ions in the channel migrate {{in response to}} (i) the electric field acting on their charge and (ii) the bulk electroosmotic flow (which is directed toward the cathode).

We simulate the focusing behavior of Dylight labeled streptavidin (Dyl-Strep) proteins in the channel, using a relationship between the protein's charge and pH measured in a previous experiment. Protein focusing results compare well to previous experimental measurements. The effect of some key parameters, such as applied voltage, isoelectric point (pI), bulk pH, and bulk conductivity, on the protein trapping behavior in a nanofluidic channel is examined. 8 page(s...|$|R

Methods: A total of 176 patients with 252 liver lesions were analyzed. There were 104 malignant and 148 benign lesions. High-field strength (1. 0 T or 1. 5 T) MR systems with T 1 -and T 2 -weighted sequences were used with and without fat suppression. After gadoxetic <b>acid</b> <b>disodium</b> injection, dynamic imaging and hepatocyte phase MR imaging were performed. Biphasic with 150 mg I/kg of body weight (100 - 200 mL) spiral CT was also performed. Image reading consisted of on-site (by study investigators) and fully blinded off-site (by E. S. P; C. R; and A.

We use parahydrogen here to rapidly hyperpolarize appropriate 1 H, 13 C, 15 N and 31 P responses of analytes such as NH 3 and important amines such as phenylethylamine, amides such as acetamide, urea and methacrylamide, alcohols spanning methanol through octanol and glucose, the sodium salts of carboxylic acids such as acetic acid and pyruvic <b>acid,</b> sodium <b>phosphate,</b> <b>disodium</b> adenosine 5 ’triphosphate and sodium hydrogen carbonate.

40|$|Leukocyte {{kinetics}} {{have been}} investigated {{with the use of}} a number of different radioisotopic la-bels including 32 p as <b>disodium</b> <b>acid</b> <b>phosphate</b> and as diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP 32), adenine- 14 C, and guanine (1 - 4). All of these have disad-vantages that limit their usefulness. The 32 p_ labeled phosphate and the 14 C compounds readily exchange with corresponding body pools and hence are not pulse labels. The quality of their emissions does not permit precise radioautography so that kinetics of specific cell types cannot be followed. The use of DFP 32 is limited because it does not label the early precursor cells. However, Athens and associates (3, 5, 6) have obtained a great deal of valuable quantitative data using this label, par-ticularly in defining the intravascular leukocyte compartments and intravascular survival time. Since thymidine was first tritiated in 1955. it has become the most important tool for radioauto-graphic studies of leukocyte dynamics (7 - 9). It has achieved this importance because it is a spe-cific precursor for DNA and is exclusively and efficiently incorporated into DNA. After in-jection, the tritiated thymidine (3 HTdR) that is not incorporated is quickly catabolized to sub-stances not utilizable for DNA synthesis and largely excreted. Negligible amounts of the label are found in the acid soluble pool or associated with RNA or protein when these are extracted by the usual techniques. This makes it an excel-lent tool for cytochemical studies (10). Since its beta emissions are of low energy, radioautographs with high resolution may be obtained. * Submitted for publication September 7, 1965; ac...|$|R

30|$|The {{photodegradation}} of UDMH {{aqueous solution}} {{was carried out}} in an open reactor under visible light irradiation. The TiO 2 NRAs/CdS films (area about 6  cm 2) were immersed in UDMH aqueous solution (15  mL) with an initial concentration of 20  mg L− 1. Then, dark (adsorption) experiments were carried out for 30  min to reach the adsorption equilibrium of UDMH with the TiO 2 NRAs/CdS film. The film-coated side of the substrate was exposed to the light source, and the light source was a 300 -W xenon lamp with visible light illumination of 60  mW cm− 2; an ultraviolet cutoff filter was used to exclude UV light with a wavelength below 420  nm. Traces of UDMH can react with amino ferrocyanide sodium to form a red complex in a weakly acidic aqueous solution, and the color depth of the red complex is proportional to the content of UDMH. So, the concentration of UDMH left in the aqueous system can be measured by a spectrophotometer at 500  nm which is the characteristic absorption wavelength of the red complex. The procedure is as follows: (1) UDMH aqueous solution (0.5  mL) was added to a test tube with a volume of 50  mL and then diluted to 25  mL by DI water. (2) Buffer solution (1  mL) was added to adjust the above solution to a weakly acidic aqueous solution.
