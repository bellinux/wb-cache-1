When the doctor, Warren, was called, she was not informed and was not {{given the opportunity to}} speak with him. When told by the Prince of Wales that the King was to be removed to Kew, but that she should move to Queens House or Windsor, she successfully insisted that she accompany her spouse to Kew. However, she and her daughters were taken to Kew separately from the King and lived secluded from him during his illness. They regularly visited him, but the visits tended to be uncomfortable, as he had a tendency to embrace them and refuse to let them go.|$|E
500|$|Angelo {{was forced}} to help Nicole {{give birth to a}} baby boy, George, and she handed him over to Marilyn {{immediately}} as agreed. She then tried to stay away, however it became obvious he needed her when he struggled without her. Marilyn then became obsessed with Nicole having the power to take her new son back. It was then revealed that Nicole would struggle to switch off her mothering instinct after giving George away. Nicole came to visit the baby and Marilyn caught her breastfeeding George, while she was <b>alone</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> Symons called the scenes [...] "volatile." [...] Nicole was unaware that Marilyn has reservations about her spending time with the baby. Of the breastfeeding scene, Symons stated: [...] "Marilyn is shocked and offended, and this cuts to the very core of her worries - that she doesn't have the same natural mothering instincts as George's birth mother. Without a doubt, Marilyn thinks Nicole is overstepping the mark. She feels that a boundary has been overstepped and it could put a big strain on their relationship." [...] After the incident, Nicole is asked by Marylin, {{to stay away from the}} baby. James defended Nicole stating: [...] "I think it's hard to not bond, but this is Marilyn's baby, and Nicole is so young and wants very much to give Marilyn and Sid this gift." ...|$|E

500|$|In February 2011, Darryl Braxton was {{introduced}} to the show and The Daily Telegraph reported that he was set to get to know Charlie in a future storyline. Charlie meets Darryl after she comes to ask him to keep his surf gang under control. During an interview with Digital Spy, Peacocke was asked if Darryl likes Charlie romantically and he said, [...] "For a bloke like Brax, Charlie is pretty ideal – she's smart, sexy and is strong enough to take him on. He's all about testing himself and he knows he'll be running a gauntlet if he pursues her. She's got that X-factor he can't ignore." [...] When a fight breaks out at the Surf Club, Charlie arrives to investigate and she asks Darryl to step outside, so they can talk. Darryl misinterprets the situation and believes Charlie just wants to be <b>alone</b> <b>with</b> <b>him,</b> he then kisses her. Charlie is [...] "horrified" [...] and she arrests Darryl for assaulting a police officer. Peacocke revealed that after the arrest, [...] "things will develop dangerously" [...] between Charlie and Darryl and that it will be [...] "tense to watch!" [...] Charlie is put under pressure from the community to find a more serious crime with which to charge Darryl and his gang. She believes that he is selling stolen alcohol to Angelo, but everything checks out and Darryl come to the belief that the kiss has [...] "sparked something in Charlie." ...|$|E
2500|$|Contemplative {{prayer is}} a silent attentiveness which looks at God by contemplating and adoring his attributes. St. Teresa {{describes}} Contemplative prayer [...] as [...] "...nothing else than a close sharing between friends; it means taking time frequently to be <b>alone</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> who we know loves us.” In this inner prayer {{we can still}} meditate, but our attention is fixed on the Lord himself. Contemplation, like all prayer, is pure gift, and not anything one can achieve.|$|E
2500|$|Tate's version omits the King of France, {{and adds}} a romance between Cordelia and Edgar, who never address {{each other in}} Shakespeare's original. Cordelia {{explains}} in an aside that her motive for remaining silent when Lear demands public expressions of love is that he leave her without a dowry, so she can escape the [...] "loathed embraces" [...] of Burgundy. Nevertheless, when Burgundy departs, his obvious self-interest temporarily causes her to lose faith in Edgar's love and fidelity, and, left <b>alone</b> <b>with</b> <b>him,</b> she tells him not {{to speak to her}} again of love.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Pendyce came close, {{and since}} air and quiet were {{essential}} {{to her at}} that moment, he bent over and tried by every means {{in his power to}} rouse her; and she, who longed to be let <b>alone,</b> sympathised <b>with</b> <b>him,</b> for she knew that it was natural that he should do this. In spite of his efforts the feeling of faintness passed, and, taking his hand, she stroked it gratefully.|$|R
2500|$|Teresa {{is one of}} the {{foremost}} writers on mental prayer, and her position among writers on mystical theology is unique. In all her writings on this subject she deals with her personal experiences. Her deep insight and analytical gifts helped her to explain them clearly. Her definition was used in the Catechism of the Catholic Church: [...] "Contemplative prayer [...] in my opinion is nothing else than a close sharing between friends; it means taking time frequently to be <b>alone</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> who we know loves us." [...] She used a metaphor of mystic prayer as watering a garden throughout her writings.|$|E
2500|$|Aponte, as agreed, asked Acevedo Vilá to meet <b>alone</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> Fifteen {{minutes after}} the meeting Acevedo Vilá left abruptly. According to Acevedo Vilá, Aponte began to {{complain}} {{at some point during}} the meeting, specifically mentioning that a few days earlier, the Secretary of Treasury changed the financial numbers given under oath in a public hearing, and that the Secretary was absent in a meeting one week earlier, making it difficult for the House to reach him. At some point during the meeting, Acevedo Vilá noticed a smiling face in Aponte and commented that he was happy to see him smile during such time of crisis.|$|E
2500|$|DiMaggio {{was said}} to be the best friend of Christina's husband, Brett Anderson, and he was like an uncle to the children. He had helped them with various tasks, such as driving Hannah and a friend from a {{gymnastics}} meet, during which he had unnerved her by saying he would like to date her, if they were the same age. During a trip to Los Angeles with Anderson, DiMaggio also complained she [...] "wasn't paying enough attention to him." [...] Anderson's friends said she did not like being <b>alone</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> and was [...] "creeped out" [...] by his comments on the drive from the meet.|$|E

60|$|And {{in the end}} {{it became}} clear that this belief was not ill-founded, for one day three years after the old man's death, there landed at the port of Yarmouth none other than my father, who had been absent some eight years in all. Nor did he come <b>alone,</b> for <b>with</b> <b>him</b> he brought a wife, a young and very lovely lady, who {{afterwards}} was my mother. She was a Spaniard of noble family, having been born at Seville, and her maiden name was Donna Luisa de Garcia.|$|R
2500|$|The case came to {{the fore}} in 1998, when Bill Clinton's {{attorneys}} invoked it as a defense to perjury charges brought by the House of Representatives during his impeachment. They argued that lawyers for Paula Jones had failed to follow up on questions asking Clinton generally if he had ever been alone with Monica Lewinsky to which he had answered [...] "I don't recall". Even though later testimony had established that she was indeed <b>alone</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> on several brief occasions, he had not specifically denied it and that the Jones lawyers' failure to ask follow-up questions about specific occasions barred prosecution as surely as the similar failure by Bronston's questioner. They also cited other occasions where Clinton had similarly claimed he didn't remember, and his questioners had simply left the answer at that. The president's purportedly false testimony was, to them, [...] "simply a confused deposition record that could have been clarified contemporaneously".|$|E
2500|$|The main {{mystery of}} the first season {{concerns}} the murders of women connected to Sookie's brother, Jason. Maudette Pickens and Dawn Green are both strangled shortly after having been <b>alone</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> Though Detective Bellefleur has little doubt that Jason is the killer, the town sheriff does not suspect him. Sookie's grandmother is murdered shortly afterward. After the murders, Jason becomes addicted to vampire blood and has a short relationship with another addict, Amy Burley, which ends when she is murdered as well. The season also focuses on Sookie's relationship with Bill and Sam's relationship with Sookie's friend Tara. Bill explains the rules of being a vampire to Sookie and, after killing a vampire to defend her, is forced to [...] "turn" [...] a young girl named Jessica into a vampire as punishment. [...] The immature Jessica is left under Bill's care and starts to grow up both as a vampire and as a person. In the end it is revealed that Arlene Fowler's fiancé, Rene Lenier, has been killing women who associate with vampires. Further, he is actually a man named Drew Marshall who created a false identity, complete with a fake Cajun accent. The season ends {{with the discovery of}} a body in Detective Andy Bellefleur's car in Merlotte's parking lot.|$|E
2500|$|Warhol was gay. Interviewed in 1980, he {{indicated}} {{that he was still}} a virgin—biographer Bob Colacello who was present at the interview felt it was probably true and that what little sex he had was probably [...] "a mixture of voyeurism and masturbation—to use his [...] word abstract". Warhol's assertion of virginity would seem to be contradicted by his hospital treatment in 1960 for condylomata, a sexually transmitted disease. It has also been contradicted by his lovers, including Warhol muse BillyBoy who has said they had sex to orgasm: [...] "When he wasn't being Andy Warhol and when you were just <b>alone</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> he was an incredibly generous and very kind person. What seduced me was the Andy Warhol who I saw alone. In fact when I was with him in public he kind of got on my nerves….I'd say: 'You're just obnoxious, I can't bear you." [...] Asked if Warhol was only a voyeur, Billy Name also denied it, saying: [...] "He was the essence of sexuality. It permeated everything. Andy exuded it, along with his great artistic creativity….It brought a joy to the whole art world in New York." [...] "But his personality was so vulnerable that it became a defense to put up the blank front." [...] Warhol's lovers included John Giorno, Billy Name, Charles Lisanby, and Jon Gould. His boyfriend of 12 years was Jed Johnson, whom he met in 1968, and who later achieved fame as an interior designer.|$|E

There for a while Gouvernail <b>alone</b> was <b>with</b> <b>him</b> and no one else, but after a while several knights came to him and gave him great condolence and offered to join <b>with</b> <b>him</b> as his knights-companion. And there were eighteen of these knights, and Sir Tristram was very glad of their comradeship.|$|R
60|$|Now {{the tumult}} began again, for some shouted one name and some another, {{but in the}} end a priest and noble named Maxtla stepped forward, a man of great power among the Otomie, who, above all had favoured an {{alliance}} with the Spaniards and opposed the sending of an army to aid Guatemoc in the defence of Tenoctitlan. Nor did he come <b>alone,</b> for <b>with</b> <b>him</b> were four chiefs, whom by their dress I knew to be Tlascalans and envoys from Cortes. Then my heart sank, for it was not difficult to guess the object of their coming.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the wake}} of this, Dennis leaves in search of Sharon but not before telling Chrissie about Zoe and Den's affair. When Zoe discovers she is {{pregnant}} with Den's child, Chrissie persuades her to abort and concocts a plan of revenge on Den to ruin him {{in the eyes of}} Sharon and gain ownership of the Vic. She recruits Zoe and Sam (both scorned by Den) and they confront him, setting it up for Sharon to discover Den's deeds. Sharon subsequently disowns Den in February 2005 and in a rage, Den violently throws Chrissie against a fruit machine and is only stopped by Zoe, who hits him over the head with an iron doorstop in the Vic. Den is assumed dead, but when Chrissie is <b>alone</b> <b>with</b> <b>him,</b> he stirs and grabs her ankle exclaiming [...] "You'll never get me out of the Vic!"; Chrissie responds by hitting him on the head with the doorstop. He dies moments later. Sam secretly witnesses the fatal blow, but Chrissie continues to allow Zoe to think it is she who has killed Den. The three women bury Den in the Vic cellar and concrete it over. Arguments between the women occur, and Sam and Chrissie become embroiled in a feud to regain ownership of the Vic, with Sam blackmailing Chrissie and digging up Den's body in the hope that Chrissie will be imprisoned, and Chrissie subsequently framing Sam for Den's murder, which leads to Sam's imprisonment. Eventually the truth is revealed, and Chrissie is imprisoned after pleading guilty. Den is finally given a proper burial in his 'original' grave next to Angie.|$|E
