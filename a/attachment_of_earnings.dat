40|$|This paper {{examines}} the impact <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> management on the value-relevance <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> and book value. Two different sources <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> management are investigated: short-term discretionary accruals and long-term discretionary accruals. A contribution {{of this paper}} is the development of models to estimate short-term and long-term discretionary accruals. The effect <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> management on the relative value-relevance <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> and book value depends on the source <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> management. When examined independently, earnings management via either short-term or long-term discretionary accruals reduces the valuerelevance <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> but has no impact on the value relevance of book value. Examination of both measures simultaneously reveals the differential impact of short-term versus long-term discretionary accruals. Earnings management via short-term discretionary accruals has no impact, whereas earnings management via long-term discretionary accruals reduces the valuerelevance <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> and increases the value-relevance of book value. This supports the conclusion that earnings management via long-term discretionary accruals has a greater impact on the value-relevance <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> and book value than earnings management via short-term discretionary accruals. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - Prior studies provide mixed propositions {{on whether}} {{earnings}} levels or earnings changes provide the better explanatory power for variations of stock returns {{and whether the}} time-series behavior <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> affects the value relevance <b>of</b> both <b>earnings</b> variables. This paper aims to compare the value relevance <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> levels with that <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> changes in the return-earnings relations. Design/methodology/approach - The unobservable components model is used to estimate permanent and transitory components <b>of</b> <b>earnings.</b> Findings - The finding shows that the proxy ability <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> changes for unexpected earnings is sensitive to a firm's time-series earnings permanence property and is unstable and noisy when earnings contain predominantly transitory components, but that <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> levels is not. The results support earnings levels are a stable and better value relevant proxy in the return-earnings relations. Research limitations/implications - The findings imply that the valuation role <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> levels {{is important in the}} research relating to earnings components, earnings innovations, and equity valuation, especially when <b>earnings</b> permanence is <b>of</b> interest. Practical implications - The results provide a new understanding on the role <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> levels in many business decisions such as executive compensations, institutional investment and conservative accounting where they often involve the choice of using levels and/or changes <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> variables in making decisions. Originality/value - The paper contributes to the accounting literature by providing a new insight into the valuation role <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> levels in the return-earnings relations.

Retained earnings and net cash flow will be analysed as a control variables too. The analysis to the issue is crucial to be investigated due to earnings is considered as a principal information that becomes an attention for the users of accounting information in taking the investment decision, credit decision, etc. The differences from previous researches are: First, on the previous researches consider the information contents of earning, timeliness <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> announcement, and the earnings quality, whereas on the other researches the three variables were not analysed together. Second, the previous researches haven’t put retained earnings and net cash flow as control variables, because {{they are supposed to}} have effect to the causal relation. This research apply both the Ohlson (1995) valuation theory and efficient capital market theory (Beaver, 1998) as a valuation basis to investigating {{the effect of}} earnings’ information contents, timeliness <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> announcement, and the earnings quality, also retained earning, and net cash flow as a control variables to the relevance <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> value for the stock market. This research hypothesizes that: First, earnings has value relevancy for the stock market. Second, earnings’ information contents, timeliness <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> announcement, and the earnings quality have positive effect to increase the relevancy <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> value for the stock market. Third, retained earnings ad net cash flow have positive effect to increase the relevancy <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> value for the stock market. Fourth, earnings’ information contents, timeliness <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> announcement, and the earnings quality, also retained earning, and net cash flow as a control variables have positive effect to increase the relevancy <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> value for the stock market. By using sample from listed manufacture firms at the Jakarta Stock Exchange (JSX) over 2003 - 2006, the results indicate that earnings has value relevancy for the stock market generally. As especially, the results indicate that: First, significantly earnings has positive effect to the stock return (accept Ha 1). Second, earnings’ information contents, timeliness <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> announcement, and the earnings quality increase the relevancy <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> value for the stock market. Earnings’ information contents proxied by direction <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> growth and timeliness <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> announcement proxied by reporting velocity <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> have positive effect to the stock return while earnings quality proxied by earnings management has negative effect to stock return (reject Ha 2).

It is often said that, while the relevance <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> is recently declining, the relevance of book value of equity increases gradually. Moreover, it is sometimes claimed that book value of equity is more value relevant than earnings, especially for the unhealthy firms whose performance is very poor. However, for construction, real estate and commercial industries in Japan, earnings is consistently value relevant over all periods. We cannot find the evidence that book value of equity is more value relevant than earnings.

In general, under the highly uncertain circumstances, information is not completely nor instantly reflected in stock prices and so the value relevance <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> is low. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to estimate the uncertainty of information environments by data <b>of</b> analysts' <b>earnings</b> forecasts and to investigate the relationship between the uncertainty and the relevance <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> in JP and US market. In US, though the dispersion of forecasts causes subsequent positive returns, it makes the value relevance <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> higher. However, it seems that the divergence of opinion does not determine the information environments in JP. In JP, we cannot find the evident relationship between the dispersion and the relevance <b>of</b> <b>earnings.</b> On the other hand, analyst coverage does not affect the relevance <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> in US while the earnings is more value relevant for firms covered by analysts than firms uncovered in JP. Moreover, the effect of optimistic forecast errors on the value relevance <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> differs between JP and US. Our results show that earnings is value relevant and earnings information is almost efficiently reflected in stock prices while the subsequent anomalous returns concerning analysts' forecasts exist. Empirical evidence indicates that the information environments in JP are different from that in US and that the relationship between environments and the relevance <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> also differs.

When firm is financially strong, earnings changes should be of limited relevance to bondholders, but should be relevance to bondholders. In contrast, as the likelihood of financial distress increase, stockholder’s limited liability allows them to abandon the firm to bondholder and earnings change should be increasingly important to bondholders and less important to shareholders because earnings provide information on firm value. This suggest that the effect <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> to stock return should decrease as the firm’s financial strength declines, while the effect <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> to bond return should increase.
