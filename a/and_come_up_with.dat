5|$|The Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA, today {{known as}} DARPA) {{was formed in}} 1958 by President Dwight Eisenhower's Secretary of Defense, Neil McElroy, in {{reaction}} to Soviet rocketry advances. US efforts had suffered from massive duplication of effort between the Army, Air Force, and Navy, {{and seemed to be}} accomplishing little in comparison to the Soviets. ARPA was initially handed the mission of overseeing all of these efforts. As the problems with Zeus became clear, McElroy also asked ARPA to consider the antimissile problem <b>and</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> other solutions. The resulting Project Defender was extremely broad in scope, considering everything from minor Zeus system upgrades to far-out concepts like antigravity and the recently invented laser.|$|E

25|$|For an {{organization}} {{to be focused}} on a democratic leadership style, traits, functions and relationships have to be obtained. Before you can classify someone to leadership position, certain qualities have to follow. The common assumptions of leaders are: leaders are born; however, this is not the case. Leaders are developed through different types of training and experience. Through the training and experience, the leader gains different traits to help make the organization functional. Leaders need to be interpersonal, cognitive, and motivational. An interpersonal leader allows for relationships to be built and to communicate messages to their followers. Cognitive leaders are able to problem solve more effective because of their intellectual ability to process information <b>and</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> creative ideas to help eliminate the problem in the organization. Finally, having motivational leaders gets the organization excited about new tasks and this allows for positive productions to occur. Motivation has been associated with ratings of leadership potential, career achievement, and promotion. The three traits will help a leader become successful because others will look up to them, and create a positive organization to work in.|$|E

[...] In a 2009 {{interview with}} HipHopDX, Bow Wow commented on how getting T.I. to ghostwrite for him on his third album didn't tarnish his credibility as a rapper, saying that he learned about the songwriting process by contributing about 85 percent to the album while T.I. wrote a full song and a couple verses to a few tracks.|$|E
500|$|Freelance writer Dan Vebber, who {{is known}} for his work on the {{animated}} series Futurama, wrote [...] "The Book Job" [...] with contributions from the staff writers on The Simpsons. Matt Selman, an executive producer and writer on The Simpsons, was the one who conceived of the idea behind the episode. He was inspired by an article in The New Yorker about the book packaging company Alloy Entertainment—the publisher of series such as Gossip Girl and Vampire Diaries—and the company's use of ghostwriters. According to Selman, the article [...] "was all about how these executives take market research <b>and</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the ideas for these books and farms them out and slaps the name of fake writers on them and fabricates backgrounds for these authors who don’t exist.

500|$|Although he {{occasionally}} downplayed his own contribution to literature, Creangă himself {{was aware that}} his texts went beyond records of popular tradition, and made significant efforts {{to be recognized as}} an original author (by corresponding with fellow writers and willingly submitting his books to critical scrutiny). Vianu commented at length on the exact relationship between the narrative borrowed from oral tradition and Creangă's [...] "somewhat surreptitious" [...] method of blending his own style into the folkloric standard, likening it to the historical process whereby local painters improvised over the strict canons of Byzantine art. Creangă's complex take on individuality and the art of writing was attested by the his own foreword to an edition of his collected stories, in which he addressed the reader directly: [...] "You may have read many stupid things since you were put on this Earth. Please read these as well, and where it should be that they don't agree with you, take hold of a pen <b>and</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> something better, for this is all I could see myself doing and did." ...|$|E

Chuck D has said that [...] "95 {{percent of the time}} it sounded like mess. But there was 5 percent of magic that would happen." [...] Shocklee compared their production to that of filmmaking, [...] "with different lighting effects, or film speeds, or whatever", while Chuck D found their intention to [...] "blend sound" [...] similar to a visual artist [...] "tak yellow and blue <b>and</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> green". He said of their approach in a 1990 interview for Keyboard Magazine, [...] "We approach every record like it was a painting.
