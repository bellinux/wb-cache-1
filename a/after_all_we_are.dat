500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1915, Noether was invited {{to return to the}} University of Göttingen by David Hilbert and Felix Klein. Their effort to recruit her, however, was blocked by the philologists and historians among the {{philosophical}} faculty: women, they insisted, should not become privatdozent. One faculty member protested: [...] "What will our soldiers think when they return to the university and find that they are required to learn at the feet of a woman?" [...] Hilbert responded with indignation, stating, [...] "I do not see that the sex of the candidate is an argument against her admission as privatdozent. <b>After</b> <b>all,</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> a university, not a bath house." ...|$|E
500|$|James Cameron {{has said}} that he [...] "tried to make a film that would touch people's spirituality across the broad spectrum." [...] He also stated that one of the film's {{philosophical}} underpinnings is that [...] "the Na'vi represent that sort of aspirational part of ourselves that wants to be better, that wants to respect nature, while the humans in the film represent the more venal versions of ourselves, the banality of evil that comes with corporate decisions that are made out of remove of the consequences." [...] Film director John Boorman saw a similar dichotomy as a key factor contributing to its success: [...] "Perhaps the key is the marine in the wheelchair. [...] He is disabled, but Mr Cameron and technology can transport him into the body of a beautiful, athletic, sexual, being. [...] <b>After</b> <b>all,</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> all disabled in one way or another; inadequate, old, broken, earthbound. [...] Pandora is a kind of heaven where we can be resurrected and connected instead of disconnected and alone." ...|$|E
2500|$|Former Prime Minister of Singapore, Goh Chok Tong, {{responded in}} his National Day Rally Speech on 23 August 1998. Goh called {{the effect of}} the Asian {{financial}} crisis in 1997 on Indonesia a [...] "major tragedy", noting that the rupiah was worth only a fifth of what it was against the US dollar in June 1997; the banking system had almost collapsed; the economy was expected to contract by 15% in 1998; and that riots had taken place in the country in May 1998, mostly targeting Chinese Indonesians. He then said, [...] "Singapore will help Indonesia within the limits of our ability. We are a small economy. ... <b>After</b> <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> only three million people. Just a little red dot on the map. Where is the capacity to help 211 million people?" ...|$|E
6000|$|And, <b>after</b> <b>all,</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> {{wrong and}} Lizzie was right. In the {{beginning}} of the winter Janet walked into my study and parlor (she never knocks) and said: ...|$|R
60|$|All {{this proved}} very entertaining, and I {{was glad to}} laugh with the crowd, {{thinking}} that <b>after</b> <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> taking a very mild revenge on our hated enemies, the tyrants of the roads.|$|R
60|$|I {{have seen}} {{the same sort of}} {{management}} at a puppet-show. Some puppets of little or no consequence appeared several times at the window to allure the boys and the rabble: The trumpeter sounded often, and the doorkeeper cried a hundred times till he was hoarse, that they were just going to begin; yet <b>after</b> <b>all,</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> forced sometimes to wait an hour before Punch himself in person made his entry.|$|R
2500|$|On 20 December Mitchel made {{an appeal}} to the Protestants of Ireland to join their fellow countrymen. In the article [...] "The Protestant Interest" [...] he pointed to the efforts of the Whig leaders to win support in Ireland by the promise of {{gratuity}} and places. [...] "But, Protestants of Ireland, shall it be so? Is it not time for all to rise above such vile influences as these? Does not our national interest, our national honour (for, <b>after</b> <b>all,</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> a nation), demand that we spurn the mean practice of both these foreign factions! that we shuffle off the coil of filthy place-hunting politics, that has kept us so long grovelling in the dust!... Ah! if you would hearken to us – and a hope dawns upon us that you will – if the Protestant magnates of the land would even now place themselves at the head of our national Confederacy, and, in this inter-regnum of foreign rule, would meet us as brothers." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 2001 Lindner {{was outraged}} by the news that Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama was going to address the Minnesota Legislature. [...] In an e-mail to House members he stated “As a Christian, I am {{offended}} {{that we would have}} the Dalai Lama come and speak to a joint meeting of our Minnesota Legislature. [...] He claims to be a god-king, a leader of the Buddha religion, which historically has been considered a cult because of its anti-Biblical teachings concerning the one true Holy God, Creator of Heaven and earth and His Son, Jesus Christ. [...] A Buddhist would say, ‘Why the big fuss about abortion and euthanasia? <b>After</b> <b>all,</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> all reincarnated {{over and over again in}} many lives, so why the big deal about ending one?’ These beliefs are incompatible with Christian principles, and those Christian principles are or have been the governing principles of American society. There is a public religious ethic that prevails in this country, Judeo-Christian, demanding a public adherence to that standard in terms of behavior rather than belief. [...] The Judeo-Christian ethic is the moral and spiritual foundation of our Constitution, Bill of Rights and most of our laws and it has served us well. ...I for one will not be present on the morning of May 9.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh no; {{but then}} Lady Glencora {{is so much}} more {{advanced}} than we are! <b>After</b> <b>all,</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> but humdrum people, as the world goes now." ...|$|E
5000|$|Onassis {{and opera}} prima donna Maria Callas {{embarked}} on an affair {{despite the fact that}} they were both married. They met in 1957 during a party in Venice promoted by Elsa Maxwell. After this first encounter, Onassis commented to Spyros Skouras: [...] "There was just a natural curiosity; <b>after</b> <b>all,</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> the most famous Greeks alive in the world." [...] Callas and Onassis both divorced their spouses but did not marry each other although their relationship continued for many years.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{had lost}} our heads, then, I must confess," [...] said Lady St Julians. [...] "What with the dear King and the dear Duke, {{we really had}} brought {{ourselves}} {{to believe that we}} lived in the days of Versailles or nearly; and I must admit I think we had become a little too exclusive. Out of the cottage circle, there was really no world, and <b>after</b> <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> lost not by insulting the people but by snubbing the aristocracy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was {{not very}} {{difficult}} <b>after</b> <b>all,</b> and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> greatly favoured by the snowstorm." [...] He then gave an account of how they had managed it.|$|R
6000|$|... '"I {{know they}} do," [...] he said; [...] "but remember, <b>after</b> <b>all,</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> {{the people of}} the Old Stock, and our duty is to the Empire." ...|$|E
6000|$|JAYSON--[To CURT--in a {{pleading}} tone.] You mustn't be unreasonable, Curt. <b>After</b> <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> your family--your {{best friends}} in the world--and we are only trying to help you-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You mean {{to raise}} that money? <b>After</b> <b>all,</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> friends of his, {{and it may}} save him from letting Edmonds get his grip upon the Range," [...] she said.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Can't {{you forget}} it?' said Guy, smiling. 'You have no loss, <b>after</b> <b>all,</b> for <b>we</b> <b>are</b> {{likely to have}} no boating weather this long time. Hark! don't you hear the ground-swell?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{should not}} have done that, Mallett, for the men would have marched all night, and, if necessary, all day tomorrow, to catch up. Still, it is a {{wonderful}} fluke that <b>after</b> <b>all</b> <b>we</b> should <b>be</b> in time." ...|$|R
60|$|You {{would have}} fancied that, as <b>after</b> <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> only some half-dozen on board, {{she might have}} {{dispensed}} with her red handkerchief, and talked, and eaten her dinner in comfort: but in covering her chin {{there was a kind}} of modesty. That beard was her profession: that beard brought the public to see her: out of her business she wished to put that beard aside as it were: as a barrister would wish to put off his wig. I know some who carry theirs into private life, and who mistake you and me for jury-boxes when they address us: but these are not your modest barristers, not your true gentlemen.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, it isn't of much consequence," [...] Harcutt declared; [...] "we {{are here}} now, at any rate, {{although}} {{it seems that}} <b>after</b> <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> not to have supper together." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, well, my dear," [...] said Mr. Tetterby, {{shaking her}} hand encouragingly, [...] "that's truth, <b>after</b> <b>all.</b> <b>We</b> <b>ARE</b> poor, and there ARE {{a number of}} mouths at home here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{the least}} in the world." [...] But, pausing a moment, he added: [...] "Still, it does not {{surprise}} me. <b>After</b> <b>all,</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> only four miles from the coast." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hurrah!" [...] Bertie shouted, [...] "I have {{no doubt}} you have hit it, Harry. I believe, <b>after</b> <b>all,</b> that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> going to find it. That is splendid! I shall dance at your wedding, Harry, which I had begun to think I never should do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If she hadn't {{bought a}} twenty-five cent pup for two dollars," [...] remarked the Major, [...] "she might have brought home an orphan from the gutters, or {{a litter of}} tomcats, {{or one of the}} goats that eat the tin cans at Harlem. Perhaps, <b>after</b> <b>all,</b> <b>we</b> should <b>be</b> thankful it's only--what's his name?" ...|$|R
60|$|Well, they {{recovered}} rapidly enough, {{for those}} who had survived its ravages were evidently now impervious to fever. Who can tell the joy that I experienced as I watched Marie returning from the very brink of the grave to a state of full and lovely womanhood? <b>After</b> <b>all,</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> not so far away from the primitive conditions of humanity, when the first duty of man was to feed his women and his children, and I think that something of that instinct remains with us. At least, I know I never experienced a greater pleasure than I did, when the woman I loved, the poor, starving woman, ate and ate of the food which I was able to give her--she who for weeks had existed upon locusts and herbs.|$|R
6000|$|Grace {{knew there}} were other, and perhaps worse, ways of robbing one's heir; but she said, [...] "Aren't you taking Hayes's view that Railton is a bad tenant? <b>After</b> <b>all,</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> responsible." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am not so}} sure. I {{doubt whether}} Sir Robert thinks it ripe enough; and <b>after</b> <b>all,</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> not in a minority. I do not see why we should have resigned. I wish I could see Lord Roehampton." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>After</b> <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> very human. The {{dressing}} bugle {{brought me}} back to the present, and I remembered that I was hungry. I descended into my state-room, and found all my things neatly laid out, and Guest sitting on the opposite bunk regarded them critically.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, when I came to {{look about}} me, I {{began to think}} <b>we</b> had not <b>been</b> so very unfortunate <b>after</b> <b>all.</b> <b>We</b> <b>were</b> on a shelf perhaps ten yards across it at widest. Above it the cliff {{projected}} so that <b>we</b> could not <b>be</b> shot down upon, and below was an almost sheer precipice of perhaps two or three hundred feet. Lying down <b>we</b> <b>were</b> invisible to anyone across the ravine. The only approach was along the ledge, and on that one man {{was as good as}} a host. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> in a natural stronghold, with only one disadvantage, our sole provision against hunger and thirst was one live mule. Still <b>we</b> <b>were</b> at most eight or nine miles from the main expedition, and no doubt, after a day or so, they would send up after us if we did not return.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, if {{men want}} to head the Asian movement, they must have muskets,' said Fakredeen; 'and, <b>after</b> <b>all,</b> as <b>we</b> <b>are</b> going to save the English prince two {{millions}} of piastres, I do not think he can object to paying Scheriff Effendi for his goods; particularly as he will have the muskets for his money.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Frances, you wring my very heart!" [...] Then pausing, to {{struggle}} with his feelings, he endeavored to force a smile, as he added, [...] "But, <b>after</b> <b>all,</b> <b>we</b> may <b>be</b> torturing ourselves with unnecessary fears, and Henry, when I know the circumstances, may {{be nothing more than}} a prisoner of war; in which case, I can liberate him on parole." ...|$|R
60|$|OLIVER. <b>After</b> <b>all,</b> <b>we</b> <b>ARE</b> {{making a}} scene in the market-place. Get in, Anabel, and we'll settle the dispute more privately. I'm glad you came back, anyhow. I'm glad you came right down on us. Get in, and let us run down to Whatmore.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is well to come here," [...] {{he said at}} last. [...] "We stop--our {{minds are}} very finite. <b>After</b> <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> just poor animals {{rising out of the}} brute, each with a mind, the poor {{beginning}} of a mind. We are so stupid. So much hurts. And yet ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{see it is}} not," [...] {{said her}} aunt. [...] "I thought {{it would not be}} wet; though I was not sure but that it might be. But come," [...] she added, holding out her hand, [...] "I have {{concluded}} not to go to the village, <b>after</b> <b>all.</b> <b>We</b> <b>are</b> going back home." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{moment had}} come, though {{to tell the}} truth I heartily wished that it had not. I wasn't exactly afraid, {{although}} I never set up for great courage, but I did not quite like the business. <b>After</b> <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> stealing these people's cattle, and now were going to kill as many of them as we could. I had to recall Saduko's dreadful story of the massacre of his tribe before I could make up my mind to give the signal. That hardened me, and so did the reflection that <b>after</b> <b>all</b> they outnumbered us enormously and very likely would prove victors in the end. Anyhow {{it was too late to}} repent. What a tricky and uncomfortable thing is conscience, that nearly always begins to trouble us at the moment of, or after, the event, not before, when it might be of some use.|$|R
60|$|<b>After</b> <b>all,</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> very {{peaceful}} and happy in those {{rooms at the}} Hague, though Eustace was very anxious about the King, Annora's heart was at Paris, and I yearned after my son, from whom I had never thought to be so long parted; but we kept our cares to ourselves, and were cheerful with one another. We bought or borrowed books, and read them together, we learned to make Holland lace, studied Dutch cookery, and Annora, by Eustace's wish, took lessons on the lute and spinnet, her education in those matters having been untimely cut short. By the way, she had a real taste for music, and the finding that her performance and her singing amused and refreshed him gave her further zeal to continue the study and conquer the difficulties, though she would otherwise have said she {{was too old to}} go to school.|$|R
6000|$|... "All {{that sounds}} very well," [...] she said, [...] "and {{there may be}} truth in it; but, <b>after</b> <b>all,</b> here <b>we</b> <b>are</b> alone by ourselves, and, so far as I can see, no chance of being less lonely next season, for your rules keep out all common folks, and we can't count {{on the people who}} were here this year coming again." ...|$|R
