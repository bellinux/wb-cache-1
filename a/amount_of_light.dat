5|$|Europa Lighthouse {{was inaugurated}} on 1 August 1841 {{in a brief}} {{ceremony}} witnessed by about 10,000 people. The first upgrade of the lighthouse occurred in 1864, when the single-wick lamp was replaced with a Chance Brothers four-wick burner, with further changes in 1875 and in 1894 when the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> emitted was increased. A three incandescent mantle burner was added in 1905. Following further modernisation in the 20th century, the lighthouse was fully automated in 1994.|$|E
5|$|The {{luminosity}} {{of a star}} is the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> {{and other}} forms of radiant energy it radiates per unit of time. It has units of power. The luminosity of a star is determined by its radius and surface temperature. Many stars do not radiate uniformly across their entire surface. The rapidly rotating star Vega, for example, has a higher energy flux (power per unit area) at its poles than along its equator.|$|E

5|$|After {{the initial}} {{detection}} of a transit signal by Kepler, follow-up observations {{were taken to}} confirm the planetary nature of the candidate. Speckle imaging by the WIYN Telescope {{was used to determine}} the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> from nearby, background stars that was present. If not accounted for, this light would have made Kepler-6 appear brighter than it actually was. Consequently, the size of Kepler-6b would have been underestimated. Radial velocity data was taken by HIRES at the Keck I telescope {{in order to determine the}} mass of the planet. Independently, observations were made with the Spitzer Space Telescope at infrared wavelengths of 3.6 and 4.5 micrometres. Along with additional data taken by Kepler, these observations detected the occultation and phase curves of Kepler-6b behind its star.|$|E
5|$|Compared to the Milky Way, the Andromeda Galaxy {{appears to}} have {{predominantly}} more old stars with ages >7 years. The estimated luminosity of Andromeda Galaxy, , is about 25% {{higher than that of}} our own galaxy. However, the galaxy has a high inclination as seen from Earth and its interstellar dust absorbs an unknown <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>light,</b> so it is difficult to estimate its actual brightness and other authors have given other values for the luminosity of the Andromeda Galaxy (including to propose it is the second-brightest galaxy within a radius of 10 mega-parsecs of the Milky Way, after the Sombrero Galaxy, with an absolute magnitude of around -22.21 or close).|$|E
5|$|In 1894, the {{lighthouse}} was further altered {{to increase the}} <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> emitted. The four-wick burner and mirrors were exchanged for a Douglass burner with eight wicks and an improved lantern; {{the power of the}} light was increased to 35,000 candela. The characteristic of the light changed from fixed to occulting. A foghorn was also installed, with two quick blasts every five minutes. The eight-wick burner was exchanged for a three incandescent mantle burner in 1905. In 1923, the burner was replaced by a Hood petroleum vapour burner with one mantle.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, the {{diameter}} of Eris {{was measured to be}} , using images from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The size of an object is determined from its absolute magnitude (H) and the albedo (the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> it reflects). At a distance of 97AU, an object with a diameter of 3,000km would have an angular size of 40milliarcseconds, which is directly measurable with the Hubble Space Telescope. Although resolving such small objects is at the very limit of its capabilities, sophisticated image processing techniques such as deconvolution can be used to measure such angular sizes fairly accurately.|$|E
5|$|In {{its natural}} habitat, N. rajah grows in open areas, {{where it is}} exposed to direct {{sunlight}} – it therefore needs to be provided with a significant <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> in cultivation as well. To meet this need, many growers have used metal halide lamps in the 500–1000watt range, with considerable success. The plant should be situated a fair distance from the light source, 1 to 2 m is recommended. Depending on location, growers can utilise natural sunlight {{as a source of}} illumination. However, this is only recommended for those living in equatorial regions, where light intensity is sufficient to satisfy the needs of the plant. A photoperiod of 12hours is comparable to that experienced in nature, since Borneo lies on the equator.|$|E
5|$|Planets {{also have}} {{varying degrees of}} axial tilt; they lie {{at an angle to}} the plane of their stars' equators. This causes the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> {{received}} by each hemisphere to vary over the course of its year; when the northern hemisphere points away from its star, the southern hemisphere points towards it, and vice versa. Each planet therefore has seasons, changes to the climate over the course of its year. The time at which each hemisphere points farthest or nearest from its star is known as its solstice. Each planet has two in the course of its orbit; when one hemisphere has its summer solstice, when its day is longest, the other has its winter solstice, when its day is shortest. The varying <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> and heat received by each hemisphere creates annual changes in weather patterns for each half of the planet. Jupiter's axial tilt is very small, so its seasonal variation is minimal; Uranus, on the other hand, has an axial tilt so extreme it is virtually on its side, which means that its hemispheres are either perpetually in sunlight or perpetually in darkness around the time of its solstices. Among extrasolar planets, axial tilts are not known for certain, though most hot Jupiters are believed to have negligible to no axial tilt {{as a result of their}} proximity to their stars.|$|E

5|$|Volcanic ash {{can have}} a {{detrimental}} {{impact on the environment}} which can be difficult to predict due to the large variety of environmental conditions that exist within the ash fall zone. Natural waterways can be impacted {{in the same way as}} urban water supply networks. Ash will increase water turbidity which can reduce the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> reaching lower depths, which can inhibit growth of submerged aquatic plants and consequently affect species which are dependent on them such as fish and shellfish. High turbidity can also affect the ability of fish gills to absorb dissolved oxygen. Acidification will also occur, which will reduce the pH of the water and impact the fauna and flora living in the environment. Fluoride contamination will occur if the ash contains high concentrations of fluoride.|$|E
5|$|In 1873, Willoughby Smith {{found that}} the {{electrical}} resistance of grey selenium was dependent on the ambient light. This led to its use as a cell for sensing light. The first commercial products using selenium were developed by Werner Siemens in the mid-1870s. The selenium cell {{was used in the}} photophone developed by Alexander Graham Bell in 1879. Selenium transmits an electric current proportional to the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> falling on its surface. This phenomenon was used in the design of light meters and similar devices. Selenium's semiconductor properties found numerous other applications in electronics. The development of selenium rectifiers began during the early 1930s, and these replaced copper oxide rectifiers because they were more efficient. These lasted in commercial applications until the 1970s, following which they were replaced with less expensive and even more efficient silicon rectifiers.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{bioluminescence}} {{is caused}} by the action of luciferases, enzymes that produce light by the oxidation of a luciferin (a pigment). Several studies have evaluated the biochemical basis of light production in Panellus stipticus, and concluded that there is no specific fungal luciferase. The fungus was shown in 1988 to contain the sesquiterpene panal, which has a cadinene keto-aldehyde chemical structure. Later, two additional precursors were isolated, PS-A (1-O-decanoylpanal) and PS-B (1-O-dodecanoylpanal). If these compounds are treated with salt of ammonia or primary amines in the presence of iron(II), hydrogen peroxide, and a cationic surfactant, light is emitted by a chemiluminescence reaction, suggesting that panal and its derivatives are fungal luciferins, and that the chemiluminescence reaction is the cause of in vivo bioluminescence. In the fungus, the level of activity of the enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) appears to {{play a critical role in}} the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> emission. SOD quenches the effect of the superoxide (O2−) anion required in the reaction, and thus SOD activity has to be inhibited for the reaction to occur.|$|E

25|$|Leeds 180 {{was built}} in 1931 by Brush Electrical Machines, and is often {{referred}} to as either a Horsfield or Showboat tramcar (the latter due to the extraordinary <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>lighting</b> on the tram).|$|R
5|$|In the {{accordion}} experiment, Home {{sat at a}} table, with Crookes and another observer {{on either side of}} him, each with a foot on one of Home's feet. Home inserted his hand inside a wire cage that was pushed under the table. One of Home's hands was placed {{on the top of the}} table, and the other inside the cage which held an accordion on the non-key side, so the keyed end was hanging downwards. The accordion was reported to have played musical sounds. However, the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> in the room was not stated, and {{the accordion}} was not observed in good light. According to Frank Podmore there was no evidence the accordion played at all, as the keys were not observed to have moved. Podmore suggested the musical sounds could have come from an automatic instrument that Home had concealed.|$|E
5|$|Of the {{globular}} clusters within the Milky Way, {{the majority are}} found in a halo around the galactic core, and the large majority {{are located in the}} celestial sky centered on the core. In 1918, this strongly asymmetrical distribution was used by Shapley to make a determination of the overall dimensions of the galaxy. By assuming a roughly spherical distribution of {{globular clusters}} around the galaxy's center, he used the positions of the clusters to estimate the position of the Sun relative to the galactic center. While his distance estimate was in significant error (although within the same order of magnitude as the currently accepted value), it did demonstrate that the dimensions of the galaxy were much greater than had been previously thought. His error was due to interstellar dust in the Milky Way, which absorbs and diminishes the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> from distant objects, such as globular clusters, that reaches the Earth, thus making them appear to be more distant than they are.|$|E
5|$|Partial solar eclipses are {{hazardous}} to view because the eye's pupil is not {{adapted to the}} unusually high visual contrast: the pupil dilates according to the total <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> {{in the field of}} view, not by the brightest object in the field. During partial eclipses most sunlight is blocked by the Moon passing in front of the Sun, but the uncovered parts of the photosphere have the same surface brightness as during a normal day. In the overall gloom, the pupil expands from ~2mm to ~6mm, and each retinal cell exposed to the solar image receives up to ten times more light than it would looking at the non-eclipsed Sun. This can damage or kill those cells, resulting in small permanent blind spots for the viewer. The hazard is insidious for inexperienced observers and for children, because there is no perception of pain: it is not immediately obvious that one's vision is being destroyed.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 27 mm. The {{wings are}} dark reddish brown without eyespots, except a small <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>lighter</b> scales placed. Females are larger and the wing colour is paler, with fewer reddish tones, than the males.|$|R
50|$|While it is {{theoretically}} {{possible for}} Li-Fi {{to be used}} in underwater applications, its utility is limited by the distance light can penetrate water. Significant <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> do not penetrate further than 200 meters. Past 1000 meters, no light penetrates.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are three}} types <b>of</b> under-cabinet <b>lighting</b> {{available}} for residential {{use in the}} USA: incandescent, fluorescent, or LED. The type of lamp dictates the lamp’s style and performance, such as <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>lighting</b> it emits, the light’s color, {{the life of the}} lamp, and energy use.|$|R
5|$|There was a {{good deal}} of {{interest}} in the 2004 transit as scientists attempted to measure the pattern of light dimming as Venus blocked out some of the Sun's light, in order to refine techniques that they hope to use in searching for extrasolar planets. Current methods of looking for planets orbiting other stars only work for a few cases: planets that are very large (Jupiter-like, not Earth-like), whose gravity is strong enough to wobble the star sufficiently for us to detect changes in proper motion or Doppler shift changes in radial velocity; Jupiter or Neptune sized planets very close to their parent star whose transit causes changes in the luminosity of the star; or planets which pass in front of background stars with the planet-parent star separation comparable to the Einstein ring and cause gravitational microlensing. Measuring light intensity {{during the course of a}} transit, as the planet blocks out some of the light, is potentially much more sensitive, and might be used to find smaller planets. However, extremely precise measurement is needed: for example, the transit of Venus causes the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> received from the Sun to drop by a fraction of 0.001 (that is, to 99.9% of its nominal value), and the dimming produced by small extrasolar planets will be similarly tiny.|$|E
5|$|Western North America {{has several}} species {{closely related to}} B.edulis. The white king bolete (Boletus barrowsii), found in parts of Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, and California (and {{possibly}} elsewhere), is named after its discoverer Chuck Barrows. It is lighter in colour than B.edulis, having a cream-coloured cap with pink tones; often mycorrhizal with Ponderosa pine, it tends to grow in areas where there is less rainfall. Some find its flavour as good as if not better than B.edulis. The California king bolete (Boletus edulis var. grandedulis) can reach massive proportions, and is distinguished from B.edulis by a mature pore surface that is brown to slightly reddish. The cap colour appears {{to be affected by}} the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> received during its development, and may range from white in young specimens grown under thick canopy, to dark-brown, red-brown or yellow brown in those specimens receiving more light. The queen bolete (Boletus regineus), formerly considered a variety of B.aereus, is also a choice edible. It is generally smaller than B.edulis, and unlike that species, is typically found in mixed forests. The spring king bolete (Boletus rex-veris), formerly considered a variety of B.edulis or B.pinophilus, is found throughout western North America. In contrast to B.edulis, B.rex-veris tends to fruit in clusters, and, as its common name suggests, appears in the spring.|$|E
