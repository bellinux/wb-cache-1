5000|$|Acrylic is the [...] "workhorse" [...] hand-crafting fiber for crafters who knit or crochet; <b>acrylic</b> <b>yarn</b> may be {{perceived}} as [...] "cheap" [...] because it is typically priced lower than its natural-fiber counterparts, and because it lacks some of their properties, including softness and propensity to felt. The fiber requires heat to [...] "relax" [...] or set the shape of the finished garment, and it isn't as warm when wet as alternatives like wool. Some hand-knitters also complain that the fiber [...] "squeaks" [...] when knitted, or that it is painful to knit with {{because of a lack of}} [...] "give" [...] or stretch in the yarn. On the other hand, it is machine-washable and extremely color-fast. This makes it useful in certain items, like garments for babies, which require constant washing. However it is much more flammable than its natural fiber counterparts, so caution should be used when making items for babies and children.|$|E
5000|$|Sandback is {{primarily}} {{known for his}} Minimalist works made from lengths of colored yarn. The artist's early interest in stringed musical instruments led him to make dulcimers and banjos as a teenager. In 1967, he produced the sculpture that would establish the terms of his mature work. Using string and wire, he outlined {{the shape of a}} 20-foot-long 2-by-4 board lying on the floor. Though he employed metal wire and elastic cord early in his career, the artist soon dispensed with mass and weight by using <b>acrylic</b> <b>yarn.</b> His yarn, elastic cord, and wire sculptures define edges of virtual shapes that ask the viewer's brain to perceive the rest of the form. In that way his work can be considered visionary or imaginative, as well as minimal and literal. Indeed, Sandback was fond of installing [...] "corner" [...] pieces whose shadows assist with this form completion process. In describing his work he stated, [...] "It's a consequence of wanting the volume of sculpture without the opaque mass that I have the lines." [...] and [...] "I did have a strong gut feeling from the beginning though, and that was wanting {{to be able to make}} sculpture that didn't have an inside." [...] Sandback himself referred to his sculptures operating in pedestrian space, acknowledging both the viewer’s movement through a space and as something to be engaged actively.|$|E

40|$|Background: Dragon {{fruit is}} one of the plant that can be {{extracted}} to be a natural dye. This fruit is contained a betacyanin pigment which can be dyed on to the textile fibers. The natural dye was extracted using water extraction. The betacyanin pigment was applied onto the spun silk and <b>acrylic</b> <b>yarn.</b> Two kinetic models, the pseudo first order model and pseudo-second order model were selected to follow the adsorption process. Kinetic parameters such as rate constant, equilibrium capacities and correlation coefficients for each kinetic equation were calculated and discussed. Objective: The main objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate the adsorption and kinetic parameters of dyeing betacyanin pigment extract from dragon fruit skin onto spun silk and <b>acrylic</b> <b>yarn.</b> Result: It was shown that the adsorption betacyanin pigment onto spun silk and <b>acrylic</b> <b>yarn</b> could be described by the pseudo-second order. The rate of constant was increased as temperature increased. The activation energy calculated was 55. 7 kJ/mol for spun silk and 44. 5 kJ/mol indicated that the adsorption process was controlled by chemisorption. The thermodynamic parameters such as ΔG°, ΔH° and ΔS° were also calculated. The negative values of ΔG° and ΔH° obtained indicated that the process of adsorption of betacyanin pigment adsorbed onto spun silk and <b>acrylic</b> <b>yarn</b> were spontaneous and exothermic. The values of ΔS° is negative indicated that the randomness of dye molecule distribution was increased as temperature increased. Conclusion: It is concluded that the adsorption of betacyanin pigment onto spun silk and <b>acrylic</b> <b>yarn</b> were favorable and controlled by chemisorption process based on the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters that had been determined...|$|E

40|$|PolyU Library Call No. : [THS] LG 51. H 577 P ITC 2016 Boonroengxviii, 203 pages :illustrationsNowadays, the {{interest}} in natural dyes for textile application has been increasing due to the carcinogenic problems of certain petroleum-based synthetic dyes to human beings and animals and their difficulty in decomposition. In this work, curcumin was selected as a substantive natural dye which could be a potential alternative to synthetic yellow dye for textile coloration. The aims of the research are to investigate the dyeability of curcumin and to further develop useful functions and properties based on the chemical modification of curcumin. The research work started with the extraction of the curcumin from dry turmeric powder. The curcumin dye was then applied to dye cotton and other 3 synthetic substrates using conventional dyeing methods. The colors of the dyed samples were different shade of yellow with medium color strength. Polyester fabrics and <b>acrylic</b> <b>yarns</b> dyed exhibited satisfactory results of colorfastness to laundering and other, i. e., PLA and cotton exhibited low colorfastness to laundering. To improve dyeability and antibacterial activity of curcumin dye, the incorporation of N-phthaloyl glycine moiety into the structure of curcumin was attempted. Monoester curcumin with molecular weight of 555. 53 was obtained as a major product. The modified curcumin with N-phtaloyl protecting group was investigated for its dyeability and antibacterial activity. Color of monoester curcumin on polyester fabric was greenish yellow but remained unchanged as concentration of monoester curcumin increased. Its color strength on polyester fabric {{compared to that of}} curcumin-dyed polyester fabric was lower. These dyeing characteristics were in consistence with the occurrence of hypsochromic (blue) shift and hypochromic effect as indicated by the absorbance values of monoester curcumin. For antibacterial activity, monoester curcumin exhibited lower antibacterial activity than unmodified curcumin possibly due to the disappearance of a phenolic group. In another chemical modification of curcumin, glycidyltrimethylammonium chloride (GTMAC) was chosen to introduce the quaternary amino moiety onto curcumin molecules via etherification reaction. The major product was characterized and identified as a quaternary ammonium cationized curcumin. As the result of the absorbance measurement, the maximum absorption wavelength of the GTMAC-modified curcumin or CurGTMAC was shifted to the region of ultraviolet radiation at 346 nm possibly due to the replacement of hydrogen atom of a phenolic group of curcumin with a quaternary ammonium group. From in vitro cytotoxicity test using 3 -(4, 5 -Dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and skin irritation test according to ISO 10993 - 10 : 2010, neither skin irritation nor obvious sign of cytotoxicity to the normal human skin fibroblast cells up to 125 μg/ml was observed. To increase the fixation between CurGTMAC and cotton, citric acid (CA) was primarily introduced to treat cotton fabric. Unreacted carboxyl group of citric acid remaining on CA-treated cotton may become ionized and subsequently react with CurGTMAC molecules in water during dyeing process. The color of dyed cotton was yellow with less saturation (C*) and more greenish tint compared to that of the unmodified curcumin-dyed cotton. The color strength (K/S) value at the concentration of 2 % o. w. f. of dyed cotton at the maximum absorption wavelength was 1. 95. In consequence of hypsochromic shift to near UV region with a high molar extinction coefficient (εmolar) of 1, 844 M⁻¹cm⁻¹, the treated cotton dyed with CurGTAMC was investigated for UV absorbing properties. The UPF rating of the treated cotton dyed with 1 % o. w. f. of CurGTMAC was higher than 100 according to AS/NZS 4399 : 1996. After 6 accelerated laundering cycles, equivalent to 30 home laundering cycles, UPF rating remained higher than 40 indicating the durability of UV-protection of the dyed cotton against accelerated laundering. With the knowledge of antibacterial property for curcumin, dyed samples were evaluated for their antibacterial property against both S. aureus and E. coli. The results showed that both curcumin and CurGTMAC provided bacteriostatic rather than bactericidal properties and CurGTMAC showed higher percentage of bacterial reduction than curcumin. The reaction of curcumin with glycidyltrimethylammonium chloride in an aqueous system can be an indication of the successful use of renewable resources; that is curcumin and water. The use of water as a reaction media is currently gaining an importance in organic synthesis since it is more environmentally friendly and contributes less pollution to the environment compared to the use of volatile organic solvents. Moreover, the modification reaction conducted in this work could produce the modified curcumin possessing better properties in water solubility, dyeability, and antibacterial property on cotton and gaining additional UV protective property. It also can be an initiation to develop natural dyes to be more valuable and useful than their original structures. Institute of Textiles and ClothingPh.

CT projections were acquired of a breast phantom containing two concentric sets of acrylic spheres that varied in size (1 - 8 mm) based on their polar position. The breast phantom was filled with 3 different concentrations of methanol and water, simulating a range of breast densities (0. 79 - 1. 0 g/cc); <b>acrylic</b> <b>yarn</b> was sometimes included to simulate connective tissue of a breast. For each phantom condition, 2 D scatter was measured for all projection angles. Scatter-corrected and uncorrected projections were then reconstructed with an iterative ordered subsets convex algorithm. Reconstructed image quality was characterized using SNR and contrast analysis, and followed by a human observer detection task for the spheres in the different concentric rings. Results show that scatter correction effectively reduces the cupping artifact and improves image contrast and SNR. Results from the observer study indicate that there was no statistical difference in the number or sizes of lesions observed in the scatter versus non-scatter corrected images for all densities. Nonetheless, applying scatter correction for differing breast conditions improves overall image quality. Thesi...|$|E
40|$|San Andres Chicahuaxtla is a Trique-speaking {{village in}} the {{mountains}} of the southern Mexican state of Oaxaca. This paper explores changes in Chicahuaxtla Trique textiles and costume over the previous half century as women incorporated newly available commercial products into their indigenous weaving tradition. Contact with the outside world and access to manufactured goods gradually accelerated, yet hand-woven clothing remains a strong component of women’s cultural identity. Although trade in textiles between Mesoamerican villages is certainly nothing new, the 20 th century brought new materials like factory-spun and – dyed cotton and <b>acrylic</b> <b>yarn</b> {{in a wide range of}} colors, as well as industrially-manufactured textiles, clothing, and other goods. Women have selectively incorporated these materials into their textile repertoire in such a way as to maintain the essential aspects of their identity as Chicahuaxtla Trique. Some traditional textiles and costume elements such as half-gourd hats and even hand-woven skirts are being replaced by manufactured goods. Other textiles endure in modified forms, like the brown wool shawl now made of black acrylic. The Chicahuaxtla woman’s huipil, or overdress, is the most culturally significant item in her wardrobe and has actually grown ever more visually elaborate and labor-intensive to produce. In addition, new types of textiles, such as tablecloths and placemats, have emerged in response to new tourist markets now open to Trique weavers. I will draw on my fieldwork among Chicahuaxtla weavers along with historic textiles, images, and ethnographies to illustrate the complex patterns of appropriation and transformation in Chicahuaxtla Trique textiles...|$|E
