5|$|However, {{at least}} in the UK, there are signs that the courts may be moving towards showing more {{flexibility}} in granting advisory declarations. In R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Salem (1999), Salem, a citizen of Libya, was granted temporary admission to the UK to pursue an <b>asylum</b> <b>claim.</b> One month later, the Home Office recorded in an internal file that Salem's <b>asylum</b> <b>claim</b> had been refused, but did not communicate the decision to him. Salem only found out when his income support ceased, and the Benefits Agency told him that they had been informed that he had been refused asylum. Subsequently, Salem unsuccessfully sought leave to apply for judicial review of the Home Secretary's decision to notify the Department of Social Security that his <b>asylum</b> <b>claim</b> had been rejected. He then obtained leave to appeal the matter to the House of Lords, but was then granted refugee status. Before the House of Lords, Salem argued that his appeal should still be heard as the question of law in his case was one of general public importance. The court held that it had discretion to hear an appeal which concerns an issue involving a public authority as to a question of public law, even where {{there is no longer any}} live issue which would affect the rights and duties of the parties themselves. However, the court cautioned that this discretion has to be exercised with circumspection and entertained only where there was a good public interest reason to do so. It is not yet known whether the Singapore High Court will adopt a similar approach.|$|E
25|$|The American Prospect {{noted in}} 2008 that Onyango risked being persecuted and {{tortured}} in Kenya if she returned, {{and said that}} risk to her family members had increased, {{whether or not she}} was deported, because of her asylum case having been leaked and widely publicized internationally. They also noted that due to the heightened danger in Kenya, her <b>asylum</b> <b>claim</b> in the US was bolstered. After her case was revealed in international media, Onyango traveled to stay with unidentified friends in Cleveland, Ohio. She had felt threatened in Boston, as people called and knocking on her door at all hours. The Boston police said that there was a problem with curiosity seekers and paparazzi.|$|E
25|$|A {{report by}} the Institute for Public Policy Research {{attributes}} the low employment rate to the newness of the Somali community and {{to the fact that}} most immigrants came in search of asylum rather than through labor migration channels. Research suggests that refugees in general appear to have more difficulty accessing employment than other groups. Many Somalis have had difficulty getting the qualifications that they have gained in Somalia recognised in the UK. Other main employment barriers included lack of references and prior work experience in the UK, unfamiliarity with the UK job culture, discrimination, over-reliance on word-of-mouth for job openings rather than employment centres and classifieds, and lack of fluency in the English language. The IPPR suggests that the high proportion of Somali households that are headed by a single woman may mean that childcare is an additional barrier to Somali women entering employment. Additionally, asylum seekers are also not normally allowed to work for payment while their claims are being processed, although they can request permission to work if they have waited longer than 12 months for an initial decision on their <b>asylum</b> <b>claim.</b>|$|E

2500|$|In practice, {{the protections}} for {{refugees}} seeking asylum {{on the basis}} of sexual orientation are limited, depending largely on invasive personal questions and the whim of the immigration officials involved. In 2014 then-immigration minister Scott Morrison introduced further changes which made it even more difficult for LGBTI refugees to prove the merits of their claim for asylum, such as narrowing the scope of protections and implementing a fast-track mechanism that may {{make it more difficult to}} gather necessary evidence to support an <b>asylum</b> <b>claim.</b> Australia's strict policy of mandatory detention and offshore processing for unauthorised boat arrivals has been criticised by non-government organisations including the ILGA, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, with particularly severe consequences for LGBT asylum seekers. [...] The 2016 ILGA report on state-sponsored homophobia also describes the case of two gay Iranian asylum seekers resettled by Australia on Nauru who were [...] "virtual prisoners" [...] because they were [...] "subjected to physical attacks and harassment by the local community, as they have been identified as being in a same-sex relationship", which was illegal at the time. In May 2016, Nauru decriminalised homosexuality by removing [...] "carnal knowledge against the order of nature" [...] as a criminal offence.|$|E

Not satisfied with that outcome, Ajaj asked to file a new political <b>asylum</b> <b>claim</b> and was given ten days by an immigration judge to do so. Thus, Ajaj was able to file a political <b>asylum</b> <b>claim</b> after his arrest for involvement in the WTC bombing.|$|E

50|$|Non-governmental {{organizations}} {{concerned with}} refugees and asylum seekers {{have pointed out}} difficulties for displaced persons to seek asylum in industrialized countries. As their immigration policy often focuses on the fight of illegal immigration and the strengthening of border controls it deters displaced persons from entering territory {{in which they could}} lodge an <b>asylum</b> <b>claim.</b> The lack of opportunities to legally access the asylum procedures can force asylum seekers to undertake often expensive and hazardous attempts at illegal entry.|$|E
50|$|It {{often happens}} {{that the country}} neither recognizes the refugee status of the asylum seekers nor sees them as {{legitimate}} migrants and thus treats them as illegal aliens.
