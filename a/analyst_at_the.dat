5|$|In {{the second}} season, Parrish, {{who appears to}} have been fired from the FBI, is working a desk job as an <b>analyst</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> CIA while living with Shelby and {{continuing}} her relationship with Ryan, who later becomes her fiancé. Flashbacks reveal that she is working undercover for the FBI as a CIA recruit. She is tasked with uncovering a rogue faction of the CIA called the AIC. At The Farm, she is joined with other recruits, including Harry Doyle (Russell Tovey), Dayana Mampasi (Pearl Thusi), Sebastian Chen (David Lim), León Velez (Aarón Díaz), Leigh Davis (Heléne Yorke), and Jeremy Miller (David Call). Ryan later joins the other recruits at the site, much to Alex's surprise. Some time after her recruitment, Alex has a meeting with Matthew Keyes and Miranda Shaw. It is revealed that she was recruited by the CIA as part of a covert mission to establish any potential threats within the agency. Ryan is also recruited by the agency for the same mission. Owen Hall (Blair Underwood) is confirmed to be the primary CIA instructor for the training site at TheFarm. In addition, Lydia Hall (Tracy Ifeachor) is later revealed to be another trainer on-site. Alex and the other recruits undergo a series of training assessments in order to become future case officers. After being kicked out of TheFarm by Lydia, Alex goes back to working as an analyst. In addition, she breaks off her engagement with Ryan some time before the 2018 G-20 hostage crisis in New York.|$|E

25|$|In August 1995, the Secretary of the Navy {{authorized}} the Marine Corps to upgrade its utility and attack helicopters {{as a bridge}} until the Joint Replacement Aircraft was available in 2020. In 1996, the Marine Corps launched the H-1 upgrade program by signing a contract with Bell for upgrading 180 AH-1Ws into AH-1Zs and upgrading 100 UH-1Ns into UH-1Ys. While the original contract called for upgrading existing airframes, it was later modified in 2008 to manufacture completely new aircraft. The program also includes aircraft simulators. Richard Aboulafia, an <b>analyst</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Teal Group, suggests that the motivation to upgrade the H-1s instead of buying new Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk and Boeing AH-64 Apache helicopters was to avoid risk to the Bell-Boeing V-22 Osprey program.|$|E

25|$|In 1947, he {{was awarded}} a PhD in Clinical Psychology at Columbia, {{and at that time}} Ellis had come to believe that {{psychoanalysis}} was the deepest and most effective form of therapy. Like most psychologists of that time, he was interested in the theories of Sigmund Freud. He sought additional training in psychoanalysis and then began to practice classical psychoanalysis. Shortly after receiving his PhD in 1947, Ellis began a Jungian analysis and program of supervision with Richard Hulbeck, a leading <b>analyst</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Karen Horney Institute (whose own analyst had been Hermann Rorschach, the developer of the Rorschach inkblot test). At that time he taught at New York University, Rutgers University, and Pittsburg State University and held a couple of leading staff positions.

500|$|Dr. Christopher Neff, {{a policy}} <b>analyst</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Sydney, argues that terms like [...] "attack" [...] are laden with {{cultural}} stigmatization. Instead {{of the word}} [...] "attack", he proposes labeling human-shark interactions, {{on a scale of}} extremity, as encounters, minor bites, moderate bites and fatal bites. The term [...] "attack" [...] is only appropriate in specific instances where specialists can confirm the predatory nature of the shark-human encounter, which is extremely difficult to do. While many encounters with oceanic whitetip sharks appear predatory in nature, without the verification of a scientific community in each instance, it is best to assume the accidental or nonpredatory intent of the encounters.|$|E

This view is shared by Professor Bilveer Singh, a political science <b>analyst</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> National University of Singapore, who has pointed to large turnouts at events organized at Speakers' Corner as evidence that Singaporeans are [...] "not fearful and not politically apathetic." ...|$|E
