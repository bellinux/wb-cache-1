2500|$|Tarski's 1936 article [...] "On {{the concept}} of logical consequence" [...] argued that the {{conclusion}} of an argument will follow logically from its premises {{if and only if}} every model of the premises is a model of the conclusion. In 1937, he published a paper presenting clearly his views on the nature and purpose of the deductive method, and the role of logic in scientific studies. His high school and undergraduate teaching on logic and <b>axiomatics</b> culminated in a classic short text, published first in Polish, then in German translation, and finally in a 1941 English translation as Introduction to Logic and to the Methodology of Deductive Sciences.|$|E
2500|$|The {{development}} of the derived category, by Alexander Grothendieck and his student Jean-Louis Verdier shortly after 1960, now appears as one terminal point in the explosive {{development of}} homological algebra in the 1950s, a decade in which it had made remarkable strides. The basic theory of Verdier was written down in his dissertation, published finally in 1996 in Astérisque (a summary had earlier appeared in SGA 4½). The <b>axiomatics</b> required an innovation, the concept of triangulated category, and the construction is based on localization of a category, a generalization of localization of a ring. The original impulse to develop the [...] "derived" [...] formalism came from the {{need to find a}} suitable formulation of Grothendieck's coherent duality theory. Derived categories have since become indispensable also outside of algebraic geometry, for example in the formulation of the theory of D-modules and microlocal analysis. Recently derived categories have also become important in areas nearer to physics, such as D-branes and mirror symmetry.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Axiomatic</b> {{design and}} design {{structure}} matrix (DSM) are two popular design methods at the moment, while most related researches only apply the basic ideas of <b>axiomatic</b> design or DSM to some cases. This paper first analyses the disadvantages of both <b>axiomatic</b> design and DSM. After deep investigations, the paper then puts forward that there are strong complementarities between <b>axiomatic</b> design and DSM. Based on the complementarities between <b>axiomatic</b> design and DSM, it is proposed that <b>axiomatic</b> design’s design matrix (DM) can be transformed into corresponding DSM for structural evaluation. In this way, <b>axiomatic</b> design and DSM can benefit from each other. The logic of integration between <b>axiomatic</b> design and DSM is interpreted in this paper. A computer aided conceptual design system has been developed to enable the integration of <b>axiomatic</b> design and DSM...|$|R

He published {{the first modern}} and rigorous textbooks of logic [...] and set theory [...] in Spanish.

This result gives a precise meaning {{to the notion that}} the set of natural numbers constitutes a universal library and indeed a universal data base. Mosterín has edited the first edition of the complete works of Kurt Gödel in any language. Together with Thomas Bonk, he has edited an unpublished book of Rudolf Carnap on <b>axiomatics</b> (in German).

6000|$|In {{my opinion}} {{the answer to}} this {{question}} is, briefly, this:--As far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality. It seems to me that complete clearness as to this state of things first became common property through that new departure in mathematics which is known by the name of mathematical logic or [...] "Axiomatics." [...] The progress achieved by <b>axiomatics</b> consists in its having neatly separated the logical-formal from its objective or intuitive content; according to <b>axiomatics</b> the logical-formal alone forms the subject-matter of mathematics, which is not concerned with the intuitive or other content associated with the logical-formal.|$|E
