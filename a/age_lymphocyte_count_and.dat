40|$|This study {{sought to}} better {{characterize}} {{the natural history of}} AIDS-associated disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection. Towards that end two retrospective studies were done: a case-control survival study and a MAC respiratory colonization study. Among 137 consecutive patients who had a sterile body site cultured for mycobacteria within 3 months of their first AIDS-defining episode of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, median survival was signifi-cantly shorter in those with disseminated MAC infection (107 days; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 55 - 179) than those with negative cultures (275 days; 95 % CI 230 - 318; P <. 01), even after controlling for <b>age,</b> absolute <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>count,</b> <b>and</b> hemoglobin concentration. Among 34 pa-tients with AIDS and respiratory MAC colonization, 22 later developed disseminated infection (65 % predictive value for subsequent MAC dissemination). Disseminated MAC infection was associated with significantly shorter survival for patients with AIDS, and the presence of MAC in respiratory specimens has substantial predictive value for subsequent disseminated infection.

Chemotherapy (CT) has brought about a considerable improvement in the survival of patients with advanced Hodgkin's disease (HD). The combination CT regimens of mustine, vincristine or vinblastine, procarbazine and prednisolone (MOPP or MVPP) have been shown to produce complete remissions (CR) in 71 - 77 % of patients with 57 - 66 % of stage IIIB/IV patients remaining alive five years from diagnosis (Sutcliffe et al., 1978; DeVita et al., 1980...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: There {{are limited}} data on factors {{predicting}} response to azathioprine and uncertainty regarding the optimal duration of treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The notes of patients attending the Oxford IBD clinic from 1968 to 1999 were reviewed. Remission {{was defined as}} no need for oral steroids {{for at least three}} months and relapse was defined as active disease requiring steroids. RESULTS: A total of 622 of 2205 patients were treated with azathioprine (272 Crohn's disease, 346 ulcerative colitis, and four indeterminate colitis). Mean duration of the initial course of treatment was 634 days. The overall remission rates were 45 % for Crohn's disease and 58 % for ulcerative colitis. For the 424 patients who received more than six months of treatment, remission rates were 64 % and 87 %, respectively. Factors favouring remission were ulcerative colitis (p= 0. 0001), lower white blood cell (WBC) or neutrophil count (p= 0. 0001), higher mean cell volume (p= 0. 0001), and older age (p= 0. 05). For Crohn's disease, colonic disease favoured remission (p= 0. 03). Factors that were not significant were <b>age,</b> sex, <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>count,</b> <b>and</b> dose (mg/kg). The proportion of patients remaining in remission at one, three, and five years was 0. 95, 0. 69, and 0. 55, respectively. The chance of remaining in remission was higher if WBC was less than 5 x 10 (9) (p= 0. 03) and in male patients (p= 0. 01; Crohn's disease only). There was no difference in relapse rates between Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. After stopping azathioprine, the proportion of patients remaining in remission at one, three, and five years was 0. 63, 0. 44, and 0. 35 (222 patients). Duration of azathioprine treatment did not affect the relapse rate after stopping treatment (p= 0. 68). CONCLUSIONS: Azathioprine is effective treatment for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. The efficacy of azathioprine is reasonably well sustained over five years...|$|R

Objective: To determine the predictors of change in CD 4 <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>count</b> <b>and</b> weight among HIV/AIDS infected patients taking antiretroviral treatment in eastern Ethiopia. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted among HIV/AIDS patients taking ART from 2005 to 2010. A sample of 1540 HIV infected adult patients who started antiretroviral therapy in hospitals located in eastern Ethiopia were included in the study. The primary outcomes of interest were changes in CD 4 <b>count</b> <b>and</b> weight. Descriptive statistics and multivariable regression analyses were performed to examine the outcomes among the cohort.

40|$|Background. Eosinophilia in {{haemodialysis}} patients probably {{results from}} allergy to haemodialysis-related materials, including dialyzer membranes. We {{examined the effects}} of vitamin E-bonded dialyzers on eosinophil counts in haemodialysis patients. Methods. We enrolled seven patients who were on regular haemodialysis and had sustained eosinophilia. White blood cell, eosinophil, CD 4 - and CD 8 -positive <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>counts,</b> <b>and</b> serum interleukin- 5 (IL- 5) and IgE levels were determined before, 2 and 4 weeks after switching to vitamin E-bonded dialyzers.

40|$|Background: Sarcoidosis is an {{inflammatory}} granulomatous disease of unknown origin. Lungs and thoracic lymph nodes {{are most frequently}} affected. To assess inflammatory process activity, disease activity criteria are to be identified. In clinical practice, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid <b>lymphocytes</b> <b>count</b> <b>and</b> blood neopterin levels are commonly used for the monitoring of inflammatory activity in sarcoidosis, though, reliability of the methods may be inadequate. Aim: To assess reliability of BAL fluid <b>lymphocytes</b> <b>count</b> <b>and</b> blood neopterin levels as inflammatory markers in pulmonary sarcoidosis. Materials and methods: BAL fluid <b>lymphocytes</b> <b>counts</b> <b>and</b> blood neopterin levels were measured in 111 patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis. 39 patients had stage I sarcoidosis on chest radiographs, 57 patients had stage II, 15 patients had stage III sarcoidosis. In 28 patients, BAL fluid was sampled from different segments of the lung to compare <b>lymphocytes</b> <b>counts.</b> The results were paralleled with pulmonary function tests, radiographic stage and lung parenchyma changes in computed tomography. Results: <b>Lymphocytes</b> <b>counts</b> in BAL fluid correlated with blood neopterin levels (r= 0. 26, p= 0. 027), forced vital capacity value (r=- 0. 24, p= 0. 04), and did not correlate with sarcoidosis radiographic stage. In 43 % of patients, relative <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>counts</b> in BAL fluid samples {{from different parts of}} the lung varied significantly (from 5 to 23 %). Normal neopterin levels were detected in 40 % of patients with active inflammation. Conclusion: Non-uniform pattern of pulmonary inflammation results in variable <b>lymphocytes</b> <b>counts</b> in BAL fluid samples from different parts of the lung. BAL fluid <b>lymphocytes</b> <b>counts</b> <b>and</b> blood neopterin levels should not be used for reliable monitoring of inflammation in sarcoidosis. </p...|$|R

40|$|AIM: To {{define the}} {{contribution}} made by C reactive protein (CRP) measurement to bacteraemia prediction in adults with medical emergencies in the UK. METHODS: This two year cohort study involved 6234 patients admitted as emergency cases to the acute medical or infectious diseases {{services of the}} Oxford Radcliffe Hospitals, in whom blood cultures were taken on arrival. The main outcome measures were bacteraemia risk associated with admission CRP concentrations, <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>counts,</b> <b>and</b> neutrophil <b>counts.</b> RESULTS: The quantitative associations between CRP concentration, admission <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>count,</b> <b>and</b> neutrophil <b>count</b> were defined. Risk of bacteraemia rose continuously as the CRP increased: no "cutoff" value was evident. Models examining combinations of CRP, neutrophil <b>count,</b> <b>and</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>count</b> were developed <b>and</b> validated using a split sample technique. CRP contributed to a model including <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>and</b> neutrophil <b>counts,</b> but its effect was small.

Setting: Tertiary referral centre for high risk obstetrics and infectious diseases in pregnancy. Patients and methods: A prospective study was designed, HIV infected women being enrolled {{at the beginning of}} pregnancy and sampled each trimester and in the puerperium. As controls, a group of non-pregnant HIV-infected women, cross-matched for age, risk factors and stage of disease were included and similarly evaluated in the same period. Results: All the parameters, when longitudinally evaluated, were stable during gestation. Compared with non-pregnant subjects, patients had higher CD 4 (+) counts at the beginning and increased values of total <b>lymphocytes</b> <b>count</b> <b>and</b> subsets during the puerperium. Antepartum and postpartum risk factors such as drug abuse, smoking, antiretroviral therapy, length of gestation, maternal complications and HIV status of the neonate were not influential on the total <b>lymphocytes</b> <b>counts</b> <b>and</b> subsets.

Patients and Methods: With the aim of increasing patient's <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>count</b> <b>and</b> reducing VEGF wich could translate into an improved immune function and a better clinical outcome, patients with HRBC, received HDCT, PBPCT and immunotherapy with interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) and 13 -cis retinoic acid (RA).

Inoperable cases (15 patients) showed a progressive fall in total <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>count</b> <b>and</b> a relatively greater depression of T cell counts, in parallel with increasing tumour mass. E-receptor blocking factor was demonstrated in the sera of cancer patients. This factor was related to tumour mass and presumably was of tumour origin, as it persisted in the inoperable group but disappeared by 12 weeks after tumour removal. The factor explained the excess depresion of T cells over total lymphocytes, but does not explain the continuing depression of total <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>count</b> in the cancer patients...|$|R

40|$|The {{peripheral}} blood <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>count</b> has been measured in 74 cases of histologically proven {{carcinoma of the}} gastrointestinal tract. The count has been correlated with the pathological stage of tumour spread and the patient's delayed hypersensitivity response to 2. 4 dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB). A statistically significant correlation {{was found between the}} {{peripheral blood}} <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>count</b> <b>and</b> the response to DNCB. There was linear association between the extent of spread of the tumours <b>and</b> the <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>count.</b> Those patients with low peripheral blood <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>counts</b> tended to have more advanced tumours and a poor response to DNCB. The possible causes of this lymphopenia are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Bone marrow {{preparations}} {{were examined}} from 80 patients with aplastic anaemia. The degree of cellularity varied greatly {{and in a}} third of the cases it was normal or even hypercellular at one site of aspiration. In the severely hypoplastic marrows lymphoid cells were predominant and this situation was associated with a worse prognosis. There was no correlation between marrow lymphoid cell content <b>and</b> blood <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>count</b> but there was an inverse relationship between blood <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>count</b> <b>and</b> marrow erythroblasts and a close direct relationship between the blood neutrophil <b>count</b> <b>and</b> marrow myeloid cell content...|$|R
30|$|Although {{our study}} did not provide {{information}} on {{the link between the}} <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>count</b> <b>and</b> the qualitative alteration of lymphocyte function, it is the first one that demonstrated in a large cohort of patients, the impact of a low <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>count</b> at ICU admission and of its persistence on the risk to develop an ICU-acquired infection and of increased mortality. The interaction between the <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>count</b> at baseline <b>and</b> its evolution found in our study could reflect the persistent status of post-aggressive immunosuppression. Of course, our {{study did not}} preclude the absence of added prognostic value of the lymphocyte subsets, which has already been reported in the literature [22, 28, 38]; however, it highlights that the routinely measured total <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>count</b> may be taken into account. Indeed, the total <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>count</b> is simple to evaluate, without any special skill or laboratory equipment. However, further studies are warranted to figure out whether or not functional new markers would add more information that plain absolute <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>counts.</b>|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY Cell-mediated {{immunity}} in {{rheumatoid arthritis}} (RA) {{was assessed by}} skin testing with six antigens in 107 patients, 94 of whom were age, sex, and race-matched with healthy individuals or patients with diseases unrelated to immunological abnormalities. 20 % of RA patients were anergic. Impaired cell-mediated immunity in the RA patients was manifested by {{a decrease in the}} magnitude of skin reactivity as well as a decrease in the incidence of positive reactions to multiple antigens. Depression in cell-mediated immunity was related to age but not to sex, duration of disease, or dise 4 se activity. A slight correlation was found between absolute peripheral <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>counts</b> <b>and</b> the number of positive skin tests, and was confirmed by finding an association between <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>counts</b> <b>and</b> the size of skin reactions. A correlation was also found between <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>counts</b> <b>and</b> disease activity. Four explanations of the observed depression in cell-mediated immunity in RA were considered: (1) a preoccupation of the immune mechanism of the host with cell-mediated immunity reactions related to the pathogenesis of the disease; (2) a depression of cell-mediated immune reactivity by a virus infection; (3) depression of cell-mediated immunity by therapy; and (4) immune complex suppression of cell-mediated immunity. No effect of gold therapy was found. The near universal use of salicylates or other anti-inflammatory drugs did not permit investigation of the effect of these drugs on cell-mediated immunity. Cell-mediated immune reactions may participate in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), although their precise role has not been elucidated. Several investigators have reported depressed skin reactivity to common antigens in RA patient...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} whether writing about emotional topics compared with writing about neutral topics could affect CD 4 <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>count</b> <b>and</b> {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) viral load among HIV-infected patients. Methods: Thirty-seven HIV-infected patients were randomly allocated to 2 writing conditions focusing on emotional or control topics. Participants wrote for 4 days, 30 minutes per day. The CD 4 <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>count</b> <b>and</b> HIV viral load were measured at baseline and at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months after writing. Results: The emotional writing participants rated their essays as more personal, valuable, and emotional {{than those in the}} control condition. Relative to the drop in HIV viral load, CD 4 <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>counts</b> increased after the intervention for participants in the emotional writing condition compared with control writing participants. Conclusions: The results are consistent with those of previous studies using emotional writing in other patient groups. Based on the self-reports of the value of writing and the preliminary laboratory findings, the results suggest that emotional writing may provide benefit for patients with HIV infection.
