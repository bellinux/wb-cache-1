5|$|Numerous feminist {{movements}} <b>and</b> <b>ideologies</b> {{have developed}} {{over the years and}} represent different viewpoints and aims. Some forms of feminism have been criticized for taking into account only white, middle class, and college-educated perspectives. This criticism {{led to the creation of}} ethnically specific or multicultural forms of feminism, including black feminism and intersectional feminism.|$|E

5|$|The {{story was}} {{inspired}} by Florey's own experiences in Hollywood, {{as well as the}} George Gershwin composition Rhapsody in Blue. It {{was one of the first}} films shot by Gregg Toland, who later received acclaim for his work on such films as The Grapes of Wrath (1939) and Citizen Kane (1941). The film serves as a satire of the social conditions, dominant practices, <b>and</b> <b>ideologies</b> of Hollywood, as well as the film industry's perceived mistreatment of actors. Douglas Fairbanks assisted with the development of the film, and Charlie Chaplin and Joseph M. Schenck helped promote it.|$|E
5|$|Murli Prasad Sharma alias Munna Bhai (Sanjay Dutt), {{a gangster}} {{who is in}} love with the voice of Janhavi (Vidya Balan), a radio jockey, devises a plan to meet her when she announces a quiz contest {{featuring}} the life and beliefs of Mahatma Gandhi, to be aired on 2 October, the birthday of Gandhi. To prepare for the contest, Munna's sidekick Circuit (Arshad Warsi) kidnaps and bribes a group of professors to provide the answers for Munna. After winning the contest, Munna is granted an interview with Janhavi wherein he presents himself as a professor of history and a Gandhi specialist. Janhavi subsequently asks Munna to present a lecture on Gandhi to a community of senior citizens who live in her home, called the 'Second Innings House.' To prepare for this event, Munna engages in intense study at a Gandhi institute. For three days and nights (and without food or sleep), Munna reads about the life <b>and</b> <b>ideologies</b> of Gandhi.|$|E
5|$|The Celtic Church is a {{term that}} has been used by {{scholars}} to describe a specific form of Christianity with its origins in the conversion of Ireland, traditionally associated with St. Patrick. This form of Christianity later spread to northern Britain through Iona. It is also used as a general description for the Christian establishment of northern Britain prior to the twelfth century, when new religious institutions <b>and</b> <b>ideologies</b> of primarily French origin began to take root in Scotland. The Celtic form of Christianity has been contrasted with that derived from missions from Rome, which reached southern England in 587 under the leadership of St. Augustine of Canterbury. Subsequent missions from Canterbury then helped convert the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, reaching Northumbria in the early eighth century, where Iona had already begun to have a presence. As a result, Christianity in Northumbria became a mix of Celtic and Roman influences.|$|E
40|$|Religion <b>and</b> <b>ideology</b> are two {{interesting}} {{terms to}} be discussed and researched. Both of the terms were able to give an ideal purpose of life which is desirable by every human being. Both of religion <b>and</b> <b>ideology</b> were able to give comprehensive description about the “ideal-things” which is intended by the human being {{to look for the}} happiness of life. Both of religion <b>and</b> <b>ideology</b> have properly arranged the way to achieve the “ideal-condition” even needed serious struggle to realize it. Moreover, both of religion <b>and</b> <b>ideology</b> have also given inner satisfaction and strength to their followers. Religion <b>and</b> <b>ideology</b> can be illustrated as ‘both side of coin’ which is interrelated. Ideology can be as religion because of its power which is able to make available of the “ideal way” (solution) for its followers. As well as ideology, religion is not just spiritual way, but also able to make available “ideal description” and straighten up the dimension of life, socially, politically, and also culturally...|$|R

5|$|The film {{serves as}} a satire of the social conditions, {{dominant}} practices, <b>and</b> <b>ideologies</b> of Hollywood, {{as well as the}} film industry's perceived mistreatment of actors. Filmmaking was becoming more expensive and requiring larger technical resources, particularly with the rise of sound production, making it increasingly difficult for amateur filmmakers to enter the profession. This deepened a divide between amateurs and Hollywood professionals, and as a result, a growing number of amateurs started lampooning Hollywood in their films, including A Hollywood Extra. The subject of the film is an extra who starts his Hollywood career with hopes and dreams, but ultimately finds himself used and discarded by the industry, and his artistic ambitions destroyed. At the start of the film, the protagonist has a name (Mr. Jones) and a letter of recommendation outlining his talents, but his abilities are ignored and he is reduced to a number, symbolizing his dehumanization.|$|E
5|$|The {{result of}} {{different}} missions {{and forms of}} conversion {{was a series of}} overlapping and informally organised churches. In the past historians used the term Celtic Church to describe a specific form of Christianity with its origins in the conversion of Ireland, traditionally associated with St. Patrick and which later spread to northern Britain through Iona. It is also used as a general description for the Christian establishment of northern Britain prior to the twelfth century, when new religious institutions <b>and</b> <b>ideologies</b> of primarily French origin began to take root in Scotland.

25|$|Swiss {{linguist}} Ferdinand de Saussure (1857–1913) {{played a}} major role in the development of semiotics with his argument that language is a system of signs that needs to be understood in order to fully understand the process of linguistics.

25|$|From the 1980s {{through to}} the early 2000s there was an {{increased}} level of violence by animal rights extremist groups directed at individuals and institutions associated with animal research. Activist groups involved included the Justice Department, the Animal Rights Militia and SHAC. In the 1980s, animal rights became associated with punk subculture <b>and</b> <b>ideologies,</b> particularly straight edge hardcore punk in the United States and anarcho-punk in the United Kingdom.

25|$|Despite {{a general}} {{consensus}} about values <b>and</b> <b>ideologies</b> underlying the monumental complex of Mont'e Prama, political implications and artistic influences are still hotly debated. As for political significance, some scholars {{tend to see}} in the small number of warriors, with respect to archers, a sign of military and political decay of the Nuragic society, caused by the establishment of Phoenician centers in Sardinia. This would be mirrored by the import and adoption of Levantine ideological models and by assignment of the statues to the orientalizing period spreading throughout the Mediterranean area during the 8th century BC.|$|E
25|$|The {{policies}} for language revitalization have been changing {{in attempts to}} improve Maori language use and {{have been working with}} suggestions from the Waitangi Tribunal on the best ways to implement the revitalization.

This change recognizes the issue of Te Reo revitalization as one of indigenous self-determination, instead of the job of the government to identify what would be best for the language and Maori people of New Zealand.|$|E
