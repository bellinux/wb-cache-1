This degradation of the input power quality can have a significant {{negative impact on the}} induction-machine performance characteristics. This paper provides an approximate closed-form analysis of the impact of line-voltage sags and unbalance on the induction-machine phase voltages, currents, and <b>torque</b> <b>pulsations</b> for a general-purpose ASD consisting of a three-phase diode bridge rectifier, a dc link, and a pulsewidth modulation (PWM) inverter delivering constant volts-per-hertz excitation. Attention is focused on the impact of the dominant second harmonic of the line frequency, which appears in the dc link voltage during the sag/unbalance conditions, neglecting the impact of the other higher order harmonics. In addition to the closed-form analytical results that assume constant rotor speed, both simulation and ex-perimental results are presented, which confirm the key analytical results, including the dominance of the second harmonic in the resulting <b>torque</b> <b>pulsations.</b> The analytical results {{can be used as a}} valuable design tool to rapidly evaluate the approximate impact of unbalance/sag conditions on ASD machine performance.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The applications of robust squirrel-cage induction motors in variable speed inverter drive systems have increased considerably due to the availability of easily controlled semiconductor switching devices. One problem encountered in inverter drives is the non-sinusoidal nature of the supply voltage, which results in increased motor losses and harmful <b>torque</b> <b>pulsations</b> producing undesirable speed oscillations. The latter effects are negligible at high frequency operation, due to the damping effect of the rotor and load inertia. However, <b>torque</b> <b>pulsations</b> and speed ripple may be appreciable at low frequency, wore they may result in abnormal wear of gear-teeth or torsional shaft failure. Hence, in applications where constant or precise speed control is important, eg; machine tool, antenna positioning, traction drives etc., {{it is essential to}} establish a method for determining the magnitudes of these <b>torque</b> <b>pulsations</b> and speed ripple, as a first stage in minimizing or eliminating them. When a voltage source inverter is used in such applications, pulse width modulation (PWM) techniques are usually employed, whereby the quasi square waveshape is modulated so as to minimize or eliminate the low order harmonic voltage components and thereby reduce the <b>torque</b> <b>pulsations.</b> Recent investigations have shown that total elimination of low order components does not produce optimal efficiency or <b>torque</b> <b>pulsations</b> and speed ripple. minimization. This thesis describes new PWM strategies which does not rely on complete elimination of low order harmonics, but on controlling the magnitude and phase of these components to achieve a smooth rotor motion. Initially, a mathematical model for the inverter/induction motor drive was developed, based on numerical integration of the system differential equations. The changing topology of the inverter bridge was simulated using tensor techniques. Then an analytical method, based on harmonic equivalent circuit analysis was proposed for calculating the induction motor pulsating torque components under steady-state operating conditions, in terms of stator and rotor current harmonics. The accuracy of this method was verified by comparing its results with those obtained from the mathematical model developed earlier. This provided an extremely rapid, numerically stable and efficient means for evaluating harmonic current and torque components with balanced non-sinusoidal applied voltages. This method was then used to formulate the torque performance function necessary to determine the new optimal PWM switching strategies. Throughout the work, the predicted performance was extensively validated and supported by practical results obtained from an experimental rig specifically designed to drive the machine under different PWM techniques...|$|R

Reliability of the system can be improved as the driver continues running even after the failure of one of the phase, Where reliability is an important criteria five phase supply can be used. The performance of the drive is improved with respect to ripple torque. This paper proposes a sequential Five Leg Inverter to convert three phase to a five phase.

In this VFD, stator current was used for torque and speed control, hence control loop frequencies had a potential to generate such sidebands. Frequencies {{of this type of}} sidebands widely vary with the rotation speed (proportional to harmonics of the fundamental frequency), hence it is difficult to avoid resonance at the train torsional natural frequency. In addition, even if a compressor system is proven to have sufficient safety margin against high cycle fatigue failure due to the <b>torque</b> <b>pulsation</b> by this mechanism, such minute <b>torque</b> <b>pulsation</b> may have a potential to excite high lateral vibration at speed adjusting gear.

40|$|The {{issue of}} fatigue load on wind turbine drive trains {{due to the}} {{fluctuating}} nature of wind is addressed in this thesis. A new control scheme is proposed and investigated which aims to maintain speed control of the wind turbine, {{as well as being}} able to compensate for <b>torque</b> <b>pulsations</b> as a result of wind speed fluctuations.

40|$|Simple {{converter}} structure, inherent {{short-circuit protection}} and regenerative capability {{are the most}} important advantages of current-source inverters (CSI’s) which have made them suitable for medium-voltage high-power drives. Usually in grid-connected gas turbine generators or pumped storage hydro power plants, efficient and reliable current-source load-commutated inverters (LCI’s) with thyristor switches are employed. Also, this type of CSI is widely used in very large drives with power ratings of tens of megawatts to supply wound-field synchronous motors (WFSM’s). However, LCI’s suffer from some disadvantages such as large <b>torque</b> <b>pulsations,</b> poor power factor, and start-up criticalities. In this paper, a novel multilevel-based CSI is proposed. The proposed converter consists of one LCI and one CSI bridge with self-turn-off switches along with a voltage clamping circuit. The CSI switches are forced commutated; hence, a voltage clamping circuit is employed to limit voltage spikes caused by current variations in inductive paths during commutation transients. Drastic reduction in harmonic distortion of stator current and improved fundamental power factor are achieved by the proposed topology.
