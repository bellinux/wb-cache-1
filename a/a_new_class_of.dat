5|$|Acknowledging the problem, the IAU {{set about}} {{creating}} {{the definition of}} planet, and produced one in August 2006. The number of planets dropped to the eight significantly larger bodies that had cleared their orbit (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune), and <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>class</b> <b>of</b> dwarf planets was created, initially containing three objects (Ceres, Pluto and Eris).|$|E

Warfarin and related drugs inhibit vitamin K-dependent carboxylation of several coagulation factors, including prothrombin.

5|$|Archaea host <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>class</b> <b>of</b> {{potentially}} useful antibiotics. A {{few of these}} archaeocins have been characterized, but hundreds more are believed to exist, especially within Haloarchaea and Sulfolobus. These compounds differ in structure from bacterial antibiotics, so they may have novel modes of action. In addition, they may allow {{the creation of new}} selectable markers for use in archaeal molecular biology.|$|E
5|$|In 1794, officers' {{servants}} were abolished and <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>class</b> <b>of</b> volunteers called 'volunteer class I' {{was created}} for boys {{between the ages of}} 11 and 13 who were considered future midshipmen and lived in the gunroom on a ship-of-the-line or with the midshipmen on a frigate or smaller vessel. Volunteers were paid £6 per year. By 1816, the rating of midshipman ordinary was phased out, and all apprentice officers were rated as midshipmen.|$|E

By the end of July 1905, the Austrian Commander in Chief of the Navy, Admiral Monteccuccoli, laid out his vision for an expanded Austro-Hungarian fleet. This included 12 battleships, four armored cruisers, eight scout cruisers, 18 destroyers, 36 large torpedo boats, and six submarines. A navy design board evaluated five designs for the new battleship type between September 25–29, 1905.|$|E
5|$|During the Northern Song (960–1126 CE), <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>class</b> <b>of</b> scholar-artists emerged who did {{not possess}} the tromp l'oiel skills of the academy {{painters}} nor even the proficiency of common marketplace painters. The literati's painting was simpler and at times quite unschooled, yet they would criticize these other two groups as mere professionals, since they relied on paid commissions for their livelihood and did not paint merely for enjoyment or self-expression. The scholar-artists considered that painters who concentrated on realistic depictions, who employed a colorful palette, or, worst of all, who accepted monetary payment for their work were no better than butchers or tinkers in the marketplace. They {{were not to be}} considered real artists.|$|E

5|$|During the {{preceding}} Tang dynasty, {{the civil service}} examinations did not yet produce {{the high number of}} officials as they would during the Song dynasty; a hereditary aristocracy remained dependent on the court for attaining rank and holding office. Song rulers, particularly Emperor Huizong, encountered a great deal of political opposition despite attempts to attain the ideals of the sage kings of antiquity. The inability of the sovereign to monopolize political authority was linked to the rise of <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>class</b> <b>of</b> gentry and scholar-official who filled the bureaucracy.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, astronomers began finding {{other objects}} {{at least as}} far away as Pluto, now known as Kuiper Belt objects, or KBOs. Many of these shared some of Pluto's key orbital {{characteristics}} and are now called plutinos. Pluto came to be seen as the largest member of <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>class</b> <b>of</b> objects, and some astronomers stopped referring to Pluto as a planet. Pluto's eccentric and inclined orbit, while very unusual for a planet in the Solar System, fits in well with the other KBOs. New York City's newly renovated Hayden Planetarium did not include Pluto in its exhibit of the planets when it reopened as the Rose Center for Earth and Space in 2000.|$|E
5|$|The {{deflection}} {{of light}} by gravity {{is responsible for}} <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>class</b> <b>of</b> astronomical phenomena. If a massive object is situated between the astronomer and a distant target object with appropriate mass and relative distances, the astronomer will see multiple distorted images of the target. Such effects are known as gravitational lensing. Depending on the configuration, scale, and mass distribution, there can be two or more images, a bright ring known as an Einstein ring, or partial rings called arcs.|$|E

5|$|The oxazolidinones {{have been}} known as monoamine oxidase inhibitors since the late 1950s. Their {{antimicrobial}} properties were discovered by researchers at E.I. duPont de Nemours in the 1970s. In 1978, DuPont patented a series of oxazolidinone derivatives as being effective {{in the treatment of}} bacterial and fungal plant diseases, and in 1984, another patent described their usefulness in treating bacterial infections in mammals. In 1987, DuPont scientists presented {{a detailed description of the}} oxazolidinones as <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>class</b> <b>of</b> antibiotics with a novel mechanism of action. Early compounds were found to produce liver toxicity, however, and development was discontinued.|$|E
5|$|Within {{twenty years}} of the Norman conquest, the former Anglo-Saxon elite were {{replaced}} by <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>class</b> <b>of</b> Norman nobility, with around 8,000 Normans and French settling in England. The new earls (successors to the ealdermen), sheriffs and church seniors were all drawn from their ranks. In many areas of society there was continuity, as the Normans adopted many of the Anglo-Saxon governmental institutions, including the tax system, mints and the centralisation of law-making and some judicial matters; initially sheriffs and the hundred courts continued to function as before. The existing tax liabilities were captured in Domesday Book, produced in 1086.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} rising {{importance}} of a central administration arose <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>class</b> <b>of</b> educated scribes and officials who were granted estates by the pharaoh in payment for their services. Pharaohs also made land grants to their mortuary cults and local temples, to ensure that these institutions had the resources to worship the pharaoh after his death. Scholars believe that five centuries of these practices slowly eroded the economic power of the pharaoh, and that the economy {{could no longer afford}} to support a large centralized administration. As the power of the pharaoh diminished, regional governors called nomarchs began to challenge the supremacy of the pharaoh. This, coupled with severe droughts between 2200 and 2150BC, is assumed to have caused the country to enter the 140-year period of famine and strife known as the First Intermediate Period.|$|E
