40|$|In {{the course}} of investigations, the {{structural}} changes in proteins were established, which {{were associated with the}} preliminary treatment of meat ingredients, a pH level of the system and parameters of thermal treatment. The pasteurization regimes allowed retaining a protein nitrogen proportion up to 94 % by the end of <b>canned</b> <b>food</b> storage duration. Upon sterilization, the losses in protein nitrogen were two times higher. A negative eﬀect of more acidic sauce on preservation of the protein nitrogen fraction in <b>canned</b> <b>foods</b> was established. An accumulation of the peptide nitrogen fraction in the <b>canned</b> <b>foods</b> in tomato sauce aﬅer pasteurization was two times more intensive. In the sterilized <b>canned</b> <b>foods,</b> the processes of accumulation of the low molecular weight nitrogenous compounds were more intensive, which suggests a depth of destruction of the protein and peptide nitrogen fraction. It was shown that an accumulation of amino-ammonia nitrogen during <b>canned</b> <b>food</b> storage was on average 12. 4 % irrespective of the pH value in the used sauces and the type of thermal treatment. A shiﬅ in the pH value of the <b>canned</b> <b>foods</b> toward the acid side upon pasteurization was noticed. With that, a degree of the shiﬅ in the <b>canned</b> <b>foods</b> in tomato sauce was 2. 5 times higher than the pH value of the <b>canned</b> <b>foods</b> in sour cream sauce. When sterilizing <b>canned</b> <b>foods,</b> another dynamics of the pH values was observed: a pH value declined by 0. 39 units in the <b>canned</b> <b>foods</b> in tomato sauce and grew by 0. 22 units in the <b>canned</b> <b>foods</b> in sour cream sauce. During storage, the tendency of more intense pH decline was revealed for the <b>canned</b> <b>foods</b> in tomato sauce aﬅer pasteurization compared to the <b>canned</b> <b>foods</b> aﬅer sterilization. Another character of the pH value dynamics was found in the <b>canned</b> <b>foods</b> in sour cream sauce: an insigniﬁcant increase (by 0. 7 %) of the pH value in the pasteurized <b>canned</b> <b>foods</b> and a signiﬁcant decrease (by 8. 4 %) in the sterilized <b>canned</b> <b>foods</b> were observed by the end of storage. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{determination}} of tin in <b>canned</b> <b>food</b> became {{very important in}} the last decades since it gives important information about the contamination process helping to increase <b>canned</b> <b>food</b> quality and safety. The present work describes the validation of tin determination in <b>canned</b> <b>foods</b> by flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS). Linearity domain of the concentration, limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantitation (LOQ), precision (by fidelity, repeatability and reproducibility), accuracy (by recovery tests) have been assessed as performance criteria. The obtained {{results indicate that the}} method is efficiently and properly implemented. The uncertainties for each concentration level have been also calculated and are considered as relevant ones for <b>canned</b> <b>foods,</b> drinks and baby food. The validated method was applied for tin concentration analysis {{in a wide range of}} <b>canned</b> <b>foods</b> from the local market. In all analysed samples tin concentrations were below the imposed limits, most of them being under the LOD...|$|R
40|$|The {{urgency of}} {{rational}} way of processing the offal of the Gadidae family (liver and gonads) for food purposes has been proved. The possibility {{of using the}} frozen gonads (milt and caviar) and the liver of the cod in the human nutrition (especially {{for the people of}} elderly age) has been researched. The frozen gonads with addition of fish liver are proven to be used for producing the <b>canned</b> <b>foods</b> with high quality level. The physical, chemical and microbiological characteristics of the product have been determined by the standardized methods. The quality level of <b>canned</b> <b>foods</b> has been obtained using the developed criteria of the objective evaluation of the quality. The specimens of the canned pastes produced from the frozen cod milt, caviar and liver using different compositions have been researched. Near-to-optimal composition of the new product has been defined. The quality level of <b>canned</b> <b>food</b> is 88. 6 %. The commercial sterility of the <b>canned</b> <b>food</b> specimens prepared using the developed technology has been established. The chemical composition and the sensory characteristics of <b>canned</b> <b>food</b> have been researched. It has been established that protein content in the <b>canned</b> <b>food</b> is 12. 9 %, fat content – 13. 5 %, water content – 71. 2 %, sodium chloride content – 1. 3 %, carbohydrates content – 0. 5 %. The product is the uniform, finely ground, evenly mixed mass with the presence of the separate caviar grains. The color of the paste is light-beige. The <b>canned</b> <b>food</b> has the tender consistency, pleasant taste and aroma. The energy value of the product is 678 kJ (162 kcal). Using the frozen cod caviar, milt and liver for producing the developed assortment of <b>canned</b> <b>foods</b> will make it possible {{to solve the problem of}} the complex processing of fish, and also to manufacture the <b>canned</b> <b>food</b> of high quality on the shore enterprises from the frozen fish offal (caviar, milt and liver) all the year round...|$|R

50|$|<b>Canned</b> <b>food</b> {{also began}} to spread beyond Europe — Robert Ayars {{established}} the first American canning factory in New York City in 1812, using improved tin-plated wrought-iron cans for preserving oysters, meats, fruits and vegetables. Demand for <b>canned</b> <b>food</b> greatly increased during wars. Large-scale wars in the nineteenth century, such as the Crimean War, American Civil War, and Franco-Prussian War introduced increasing numbers of working-class men to <b>canned</b> <b>food,</b> and allowed <b>canning</b> companies to expand their businesses to meet military demands for non-perishable food, allowing companies to manufacture in bulk and sell to wider civilian markets after wars ended. Urban populations in Victorian Britain demanded ever-increasing quantities of cheap, varied, quality food that they could keep at home {{without having to go}} shopping daily. In response, companies such as Underwood, Nestlé, Heinz, and others provided quality <b>canned</b> <b>food</b> for sale to working class city-dwellers. In particular, Crosse and Blackwell took over the concern of Donkin Hall and Gamble. The late 19th century saw the range of <b>canned</b> <b>food</b> available to urban populations greatly increase, as canners competed with each other using novel foodstuffs, highly decorated printed labels, and lower prices.|$|R

40|$|In {{addition}} to fresh <b>foods,</b> many <b>canned</b> <b>foods</b> also provide nutrient-dense dietary options, often {{at a lower}} price, with longer storage potential. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare nutrient-dense food group intake and nutrient intake between different levels of <b>canned</b> <b>food</b> consumption in the US. Consumption data were collected for this cross-sectional study from 9761 American <b>canned</b> <b>food</b> consumers (aged two years and older) from The NPD Group’s National Eating Trends® (NET®) database during 2011 – 2013; and the data were assessed using The NPD Group’s Nutrient Intake Database. <b>Canned</b> <b>food</b> consumers were placed into three groups: Frequent Can Users (≥ 6 canned items/week); n = 2584, Average Can Users (3 – 5 canned items/week); n = 4445, and Infrequent Can Users (≤ 2 canned items/week); n = 2732. The results provide evidence that Frequent Can Users consume more nutrient-dense food groups such as fruits, vegetables, dairy products, and protein-rich foods, and also have higher intakes of 17 essential nutrients including the shortfall nutrients—potassium, calcium and fiber—when compared to Infrequent Can Users. Therefore, in {{addition to}} fresh foods, diets higher in nutrient-dense <b>canned</b> <b>food</b> consumption <b>can</b> also offer dietary options which improve nutrient intakes and the overall diet quality of Americans...|$|R
