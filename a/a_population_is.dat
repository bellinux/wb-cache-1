5|$|An {{individual}} organism's phenotype {{results from}} both its genotype {{and the influence}} from the environment it has lived in. A substantial part of the phenotypic variation in <b>a</b> <b>population</b> <b>is</b> caused by genotypic variation. The modern evolutionary synthesis defines evolution as the change over time in this genetic variation. The frequency of one particular allele will become more or less prevalent relative {{to other forms of}} that gene. Variation disappears when a new allele reaches the point of fixation—when it either disappears from the population or replaces the ancestral allele entirely.|$|E
5|$|The {{time for}} a neutral allele to become fixed by genetic drift depends on {{population}} size, with fixation occurring more rapidly in smaller populations. The number of individuals in <b>a</b> <b>population</b> <b>is</b> not critical, but instead a measure known as the effective population size. The effective population is usually smaller than the total population since it takes into account {{factors such as the}} level of inbreeding and the stage of the lifecycle in which the population is the smallest. The effective population size may not be the same for every gene in the same population.|$|E
5|$|When {{multiple}} different alleles for a gene {{are present}} in a species's population it is called polymorphic. Most different alleles are functionally equivalent, however some alleles can give rise to different phenotypic traits. A gene's most common allele is called the wild type, and rare alleles are called mutants. The genetic variation in relative frequencies of different alleles in <b>a</b> <b>population</b> <b>is</b> due to both natural selection and genetic drift. The wild-type allele {{is not necessarily the}} ancestor of less common alleles, nor is it necessarily fitter.|$|E

5|$|A radical {{strategy}} for avoiding predators which may otherwise kill {{a large majority}} of the emerging young of <b>a</b> <b>population</b> <b>is</b> to emerge very rarely, at irregular intervals. This strategy is seen in dramatic form in the periodical cicadas, which emerge at intervals of 13 or 17 years. Predators with a life-cycle of one or a few years are unable to reproduce rapidly enough in response to such an emergence, so predator satiation is a likely evolutionary explanation for the cicadas' unusual life-cycle, though not the only one. Predators may still feast on the emerging cicadas, but are unable to consume more than a fraction of the brief surfeit of prey.|$|E
5|$|In adult house sparrows, annual {{survival}} is 45–65%. After fledging {{and leaving the}} care of their parents, young sparrows have a high mortality rate, which lessens {{as they grow older}} and more experienced. Only about 20–25% of birds hatched survive to their first breeding season. The oldest known wild house sparrow lived for nearly two decades; it was found dead 19years and 9months after it was ringed in Denmark. The oldest recorded captive house sparrow lived for 23years. The typical ratio of males to females in <b>a</b> <b>population</b> <b>is</b> uncertain due to problems in collecting data, but a very slight preponderance of males at all ages is usual.|$|E
5|$|Toothache {{may occur}} at any age, in any gender {{and in any}} {{geographic}} region. Diagnosing and relieving toothache {{is considered one of}} the main responsibilities of dentists. Irreversible pulpitis is thought to be the most common reason that people seek emergency dental treatment. Since dental caries associated with pulpitis is the most common cause, toothache is more common in populations that are at higher risk of dental caries. The prevalence of caries in <b>a</b> <b>population</b> <b>is</b> dependent upon factors such as diet (refined sugars), socioeconomic status, and exposure to fluoride (such as areas without water fluoridation). In the United States, an estimated 12% of the general population reported that they suffered from toothache at some point in the six months before questioning. Individuals aged 18–34 reported much higher experience of toothache than those aged 75 or over. In a survey of Australian schoolchildren, 12% had experienced toothache before the age of five, and 32% by the age of 12. Dental trauma is extremely common and tends to occur more often in children than adults.|$|E

50|$|When all {{individuals}} in <b>a</b> <b>population</b> <b>are</b> identical {{with regard to}} a particular phenotypic trait, the <b>population</b> <b>is</b> said to be monomorphic. When the individuals show several variants of a particular trait {{they are said to}} be polymorphic.|$|R
25|$|Whether <b>a</b> <b>population</b> <b>is</b> {{evolutionarily}} stable {{does not}} relate to its genetic diversity: it can be genetically monomorphic or polymorphic.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes what defines <b>a</b> <b>population</b> <b>is</b> obvious. For example, a {{manufacturer}} needs {{to decide whether}} a batch of material from production is of high enough quality to be released to the customer, or should be sentenced for scrap or rework due to poor quality. In this case, the batch is the population.|$|E
25|$|When only {{a sample}} of data from <b>a</b> <b>population</b> <b>is</b> available, the term {{standard}} deviation of the sample or sample standard deviation can refer to either the above-mentioned quantity as applied to those data or to a modified quantity that is an unbiased estimate of the population standard deviation (the standard deviation of the entire population).|$|E

In a vacancy chain, a new resource unit that arrives into <b>a</b> <b>population</b> <b>is</b> taken by the first individual in line, who then leaves his/her old unit behind, this old unit is taken by a second individual, leaving his/her old unit behind, and so forth.|$|E
25|$|The {{gene pool}} {{of a species}} or <b>a</b> <b>population</b> <b>is</b> the variety of genetic {{information}} in its living members. A large gene pool (extensive genetic diversity) is associated with robust populations that can survive bouts of intense selection. Meanwhile, low genetic diversity (see inbreeding and population bottlenecks) reduces the range of adaptions possible. Replacing native with alien genes narrows genetic diversity within the original population, thereby increasing the chance of extinction.|$|E
25|$|Average {{lifespan}} in <b>a</b> <b>population</b> <b>is</b> lowered by {{infant and}} child mortality, which are frequently linked to infectious diseases or nutrition problems. Later in life, vulnerability to accidents and age-related chronic disease {{such as cancer}} or cardiovascular disease play an increasing role in mortality. Extension of expected lifespan can often be achieved by access to improved medical care, vaccinations, good diet, exercise and avoidance of hazards such as smoking.|$|E

25|$|According to Dr Robbie McDonald, Head of Wildlife and Emerging Diseases at FERA (the lead {{wildlife}} {{scientist for}} Defra and responsible {{for research on}} badgers) the benefit of culling <b>a</b> <b>population</b> <b>is</b> outweighed by the detrimental effect on neighbouring populations of badgers. He is reported as saying that {{a huge number of}} badgers would have to be killed to make a difference and while it is cheap and easy to exterminate animals {{in the early days of}} a cull it gets harder and more expensive as time goes on.|$|E
25|$|In CAPP-Seq, {{design of}} {{selector}} {{is a crucial}} step that identifies recurrent mutations in a particular cancer type using publicly available next generation sequencing data. For inclusion in CAPP-seq selector, the recurrent mutations that are enriched in <b>a</b> <b>population</b> <b>is</b> described by an index- Recurrence Index (RI). RI {{is the number of}} mutations per kilobase of a given genomic locus of a patient carrying particular mutations. RI represents a patient level recurrence frequency estimated for somatic mutations and all mutations. Known and driver recurrent mutations in a population can be ranked based on the RI and therefore RI is used to design a selector. A six phase design strategy is employed to design selector.|$|E
25|$|In bulked {{segregant}} analysis, <b>a</b> <b>population</b> <b>is</b> {{screened for}} a trait {{of interest and}} the genotypes at the two extreme ends form two bulks. Then the two bulks are tested for {{the presence or absence}} of molecular markers. Since the bulks are supposed to contrast in the alleles that contribute positive and negative effects, any marker polymorphism between the two bulks indicates the linkage between the marker and trait of interest. BSA is dependent on accurate phenotyping and the DH population has particular advantage in that they are true breeding and can be tested repeatedly. DH populations are commonly used in bulked segregant analysis, which is a popular method in marker assisted breeding. This method has been applied mostly to rapeseed and barley.|$|E

25|$|In {{the genome}} of an organism, each gene {{is located at}} a {{specific}} place called the locus for that gene. Allelic variations at these loci cause phenotypic variation within species (e.g. hair colour, eye colour). However, most alleles {{do not have an}} observable impact on the phenotype. Within a population new alleles generated by mutation either die out or spread throughout the population. When <b>a</b> <b>population</b> <b>is</b> split into different isolated populations (by either geographical or ecological factors), mutations that occur after the split will be present only in the isolated population. Random fluctuation of allele frequencies also produces genetic differentiation between populations. This process is known as genetic drift. By examining the differences between allele frequencies between the populations and computing genetic distance, we can estimate how long ago the two populations were separated.|$|E
25|$|The primary way {{to boost}} levels of {{immunity}} in <b>a</b> <b>population</b> <b>is</b> through vaccination. Their use is originally {{based on the}} observation that milkmaids exposed to cowpox were immune to smallpox, so the practice of inoculating people with the cowpox virus began {{as a way to}} prevent smallpox cases. Well-developed vaccines provide protection in a far safer way than natural infections, as vaccines generally do not cause the diseases they protect against and severe adverse effects are significantly less common than complications from natural infections. The immune system does not distinguish between natural infections and vaccines, forming an active response to both, so immunity induced via vaccination is similar to what would have occurred from contracting and recovering from the disease. To achieve herd immunity through vaccination, vaccine manufacturers aim to produce vaccines with low failure rates and policy makers aim to encourage their use. After the successful introduction and widespread use of a vaccine, sharp declines in the incidence of diseases it protects against can be observed, necessarily decreasing the number of hospitalizations and deaths caused by such diseases.|$|E
25|$|Genetic drift is a {{cause of}} allelic {{frequency}} change within populations of a species. Alleles are different variations of specific genes. They determine things like hair color, skin tone, eye color and blood type; in other words, all the genetic traits that vary between individuals. Genetic drift does not introduce new alleles to a population, but it can reduce variation within a population by removing an allele from the gene pool. Genetic drift is caused by random sampling of alleles. A truly random sample is a sample in which no outside forces affect what is selected. It is like pulling marbles {{of the same size}} and weight but of different colors from a brown paper bag. In any offspring, the alleles present are samples of the previous generations alleles, and chance plays a role in whether an individual survives to reproduce and to pass a sample of their generation onward to the next. The allelic frequency of <b>a</b> <b>population</b> <b>is</b> the ratio of the copies of one specific allele that share the same form compared to the number of all forms of the allele present in the population.|$|E
