40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new frequency-dependent {{amplitude}} panning method for stereophonic image enhancement {{applied to a}} sound source recorded using two closely spaced omni-directional microphones. The ability to detect the direction of such a sound source is limited due to weak spatial information, such as the inter-channel time difference (ICTD) and inter-channel level difference (ICLD). Moreover, when sound sources are recorded in a convolutive or a real room environment, the detection of sources is affected by reverberation effects. Thus, the proposed method first tries to estimate the source direction depending on the frequency using azimuth-frequency analysis. Then, a frequency-dependent amplitude panning technique is proposed to enhance the stereophonic image by modifying the stereophonic law of sines. To demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed method, we compare its performance with that of a conventional method based on the beamforming technique in terms of directivity pattern, perceived direction, and quality degradation under three different recording conditions (anechoic, convolutive, and real reverberant).

30|$|In {{the spatial}} domain, in {{addition}} to the use of simple linear techniques which emphasize the high-frequency contents of an image (the so-called unsharp masking approach), the most famous approaches are probably the Retinex model, based on Land's studies [9], and histogram equalization [10]. A set of modifications has been proposed for the improvement of these methods. In particular, {{it is interesting to note}} that both methods have evolved to include a multiscale (i.e., multiresolution) version, based on convolution with smoothing kernels. The evolution of the methods has incorporated the estimation of a context, based on a global measure in a suitable neighborhood, allowing adaptive enhancement [11 – 14]. In fact, there is a general agreement about the fact that these two factors greatly improve the performance of any contrast-enhancement framework [15]. However, they are also responsible for unavoidable undesired artifacts like oversmoothing (with a loss of details) or excessive enhancement (with a resulting amplification of noise and/or halo effects) [16]. Even though some sophisticated approaches have been proposed for their reduction [17, 18], these artifacts remain an aspect to be considered in the design of any contrast-enhancement framework. The situation is even more difficult when scanned antique photographic prints are processed. In this case, the presence of defects in the original art may introduce specific artifacts in the digital item, which in turn produce particularly <b>annoying</b> <b>effects</b> if conventional enhancement techniques are applied.|$|E

40|$|Because {{of their}} {{peculiar}} {{ability to take}} off vertically and their excellent handling qualities in hover and low speed flight conditions, helicopters can play several roles beyond the capabilities of fixedwing aircraft. However, {{the high levels of}} vibrations and noise generated represent nowadays critical issues limiting the helicopters operations both in civilian and military cenarios. Among the several sources contributing to the overall levels of vibration and noise, the main rotor plays a fundamental role through complex aerodynamic and aeroelastic phenomena affecting its operation. The rotorcraft research community is currently involved in exploring several active and passive approaches suited to reduce these <b>annoying</b> <b>effects,</b> and a lot of attention is particularly given to noise aerodynamically generated by main rotor when blade-vortex interactions (BVIs) occur. In this context, the aim of the thesis is to provide efficient formulations for performing fast and accurate rotor aeroelastic and aeroacoustic analyses. The availability of numerically efficient tools is extremely useful, for example, in early stages of design, optimization, and control synthesis, due to the high number of simulations that might be required. Some applications of the numerical tools developed are also presented in the thesis, in order to investigate different active and passive approaches for reducing vibration and BVI noise due to the helicopter main rotor. In particular, a procedure of advanced blade optimization is investigated as passive approach. In this procedure, blade shape and its mechanical/structural properties are selected using a genetic optimization algorithm, in order to reduce annoying vibratory loads at different flight conditions. In examining active control approaches, benefits achievable through the active twist rotor (ATR) solution are evaluated, investigating control effectiveness of both high-frequency and low-frequency actuators. The optimal, multi-cyclic, control theory is applied to identify the control law driving the ATR actuation. In all the applications proposed, rotor simulations are obtained by combining aerodynamic, aeroelastic and aeroacoustic tools able to accurately capture wake-blade mutual positions, which plays a crucial role in vibration and noise generation. In particular, rotor aeroelastic behaviour is described by a non-linear, beam-like model, coupled with a quasi-steady sectional aerodynamic formulation, taking into account three-dimensional effects by a free-wake inflow correction. The evaluation of the wake inflow is obtained by a boundary element method (BEM) suited for the analysis of helicopter rotors in arbitrary flight conditions, including those affected by strong aerodynamic body-wake interactions. Concerning the noise emitted by the rotor, it is evaluated through solution of the well-known Ffowcs Williams and Hawkings equation, which governs the propagation of acoustic disturbances aerodynamically generated by moving bodies. Specifically, the boundary integral Formulation 1 A developed by Farassat is used. In this thesis, an accurate and efficient approach is presented for predicting blade airloads used for the aeroacoustic solution. It relies on the Küssner-Schwarz aerodynamic sectional theory, coupled with wake inflow information obtained through three-dimensional, free-wake aerodynamic solutions of trimmed rotor aeroelastic responses. In order to provide inflow corrections to sectional formulations used for both the aeroelastic solution and the blade airloads prediction, surrogate inflow models are also introduced in the thesis, as good trade-off solution between accuracy and computational efficiency. Furthermore, different algorithms for blade optimization and active control synthesis, aimed at efficiently exploiting aeroelastic and aeroacoustic models for the specific considered applications, are described. Several numerical investigations are presented to demonstrate the capability of the proposed approaches and examine their performance in the optimization and active control applications considered. In particular, single-point and multi-point optimization procedures are successfully applied to define low-vibrating rotor blades at the flight condition(s) considered, showing difficulties to guarantee significant vibratory loads reductions in off-design flight conditions, even if multi-point optimization is considered. A sensitivity analysis of the results obtained to the aerodynamic models used is carried out, confirming suitability of the surrogate models introduced in optimization problems. A final acoustic assessment of the optimal rotor obtained is performed, confirming the more acoustically annoying nature of low-vibrating rotors. Then, the high-frequency ATR control application is numerically investigated. Two different closed-loop controls are obtained, leading to significant reductions of the higher-harmonic noise in some areas of the acoustic field through limited blade twist imposed. In both cases, vibratory levels appears to be unaffected by control actuation, confirming the advantage of high-frequency controllers in terms of drawbacks onset. Finally, attention is focused on low-frequency ATR control strategy. In a preliminary analysis, 2 /rev frequency appears to be effective in reducing BVI noise, with limited drawbacks in terms of increase of vibratory loads and low-frequency acoustic disturbance with respect to other frequencies considered. Hence, a 2 /rev closed-loop noise control is numerically applied, showing an overall satisfactory reduction of the BVI noise in the acoustic field, with limited increase of low-frequency noise and vibratory hub loads...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{distributed}} {{and network}} speech recognition the actual recognition task is not {{carried out on}} the user’s terminal but rather on a remote server in the network. While {{there are good reasons}} for doing so, a disadvantage of this client-server architecture is clearly that the communication medium may introduce errors, which then impairs speech recognition accuracy. Even sophisticated channel coding cannot completely prevent the occurrence of residual bit errors in the case of temporarily adverse channel conditions, and in packet-oriented transmission packets of data may arrive too late for the given real-time constraints and have to be declared lost. The goal of error concealment is to reduce the detrimental effect that such errors may induce on the recipient of the transmitted speech signal by exploiting residual redundancy in the bit stream at the source coder output. In classical speech transmission a human is the recipient, and erroneous data are reconstructed so as to reduce the subjectively <b>annoying</b> <b>effect</b> of corrupted bits or lost packets.

Periodic network overloads, leading to bursty packet losses, have always been a key problem for network researchers. In a long-haul, heterogeneous network like the Internet, handling such an error becomes especially difficult. Perceptual studies of audio and video viewing have shown that bursty losses have the most <b>annoying</b> <b>effect</b> on people, and hence are critical issues to be addressed for applications such as Internet phone, video conferencing, distance learning, etc. Classical error handling techniques have focused on applications like FTP, and are geared towards ensuring that the transmission is correct, with no attention to timeliness. For isochronous traffic like audio and video, timeliness is a key criterion, and given the high degree of content redundancy, some loss of content is quite acceptable. In this paper we introduce the concept of error spreading, which is a transformation technique that takes the input sequence of packets (from an audio or video stream) and scrambles its packet before transmission. The packets are unscrambled at the receiving end. The transformation is designed to ensure that bursty losses in the transformed domain get spread all over the sequence in the original domain. Perceptual studies have shown that users are much more tolerant of a uniformly distributed loss of low magnitude. We next describe a continuous media transmission protocol based on this idea, and validate its performance through an experiment performed on the Internet. ...|$|R

In this paper, we will {{introduce a new}} method for fast detection and high quality restoration {{of this kind of}} degradation. Our detection method relies on the statistical characteristics of the intensity of pixels in the scratched areas of frames. For high quality restoration of the scratches we use a mixed adaptive stochastic AR-Median model to restore the scratched areas. The proposed detection algorithm is fast and more efficient compared to the other available approaches. The main contribution of our restoration algorithm is its ability to jointly adapt the image model to the data and concurrently restore the missing pixels. only to the scratched parts of the images. So it is necessary to detect the positions of the scratched pixels by a so-called detection algorithm, before applying any restoration algorithm. The main problem in the detection of line scratches is their similarity to vertical features of the image. In some cases even for a human observer it may be hard to distinguish between a line scratch and a vertical feature (e. g., in Fig. 1 look at the line scratch in the image near the door edge and its similarity to the door frame).
