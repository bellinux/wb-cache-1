25|$|Though not {{all women}} are {{politicians}} or war generals, boys are {{raised in the}} domestic sphere. Not only that, but men come back to it every day in their private homes. Even President Theodore Roosevelt can be quoted to say “o man can be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>citizen</b> {{who is not a}} good husband and a good father.” Similar to how history needs domestic history incorporated into it, men’s history cannot be understood without their private experiences known. Women’s history thus needs their private experiences to be combined with their public. To successfully integrate these histories, the world must not have male and female spheres that are synonyms for the private and public. The connections found in public and private men’s and women’s history need to be systematically synthesized to successfully integrate them. So the idea of just two histories creates the challenge that most feminist historians have.|$|E

[...] Donald E. Cameron, who delivered the eulogy at the funeral remarked of Primrose, [...] "Colonel Primrose never sought for himself or for his men more than that their record of service should be allowed to speak for itself. Somewhat austerely he clung to the tradition of the service that duty faithfully discharged its own reward." [...] An obituary published shortly after his death described him as [...] "courageous, outspoken and firm in dealing with his criminals." [...] John W.

He said that all of the attacks show evidence of cool and cunning planning and that the killer could be from another community and had acquainted himself with the area. He said that the strengthening of the police force would not scare him away but that he would willingly leave due to the difficulty of committing a crime. [...] "This man is extremely dangerous. He works alone and no one knows what he is doing because he tells no one," [...] Lapalla said, adding that the killer may have reasoned in past crimes {{that the only way to}} remain unidentified is to kill all persons at the scene.
