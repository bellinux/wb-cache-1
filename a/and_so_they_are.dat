5|$|Harrya chromapes, {{commonly}} known as the yellowfoot bolete or the chrome-footed bolete, is species of bolete fungus in the family Boletaceae. The bolete is found in eastern North America, Costa Rica, and eastern Asia, where it grows on the ground, in a mycorrhizal association with deciduous and coniferous trees. Fruit bodies have smooth, rose-pink caps that are initially convex before flattening out. The pores on the cap undersurface are white, aging to a pale pink as the spores mature. The thick stipe has fine pink or reddish dots (scabers), and is white to pinkish but with a bright yellow base. The mushrooms are edible but are popular with insects, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> often infested with maggots.|$|E
5|$|Mild steel corrodes {{more readily}} than wrought iron, but is cheaper and more widely available. Carbon steel {{contains}} 2.0% carbon or less, with small amounts of manganese, sulfur, phosphorus, and silicon. Alloy steels contain varying amounts of carbon {{as well as other}} metals, such as chromium, vanadium, molybdenum, nickel, tungsten, etc. Their alloy content raises their cost, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> usually only employed for specialist uses. One common alloy steel, though, is stainless steel. Recent developments in ferrous metallurgy have produced a growing range of microalloyed steels, also termed 'HSLA' or high-strength, low alloy steels, containing tiny additions to produce high strengths and often spectacular toughness at minimal cost.|$|E
5|$|The {{magazine}} {{began as}} a 160-page digest, priced at 35 cents. The price stayed the same throughout the run, but the page count was cut to 128 for the eighth issue, September 1954. The magazine was bimonthly, but issues 9 and 10 did not carry month and year dates, which has led different bibliographers to catalogue them in different ways. However, the masthead for these issues indicates that the magazine remained bimonthly, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> now usually catalogued as November 1954 and January 1955, respectively; the copyright dates on the last two issues correspond to these dates. The volume numbering was completely regular; volume 1 had six numbers, and volume 2 ceased with its fourth number. The stories were printed in the two-column format usual to digest magazines.|$|E

5|$|The {{impact of}} sickle cell trait on malaria {{immunity}} illustrates some evolutionary trade-offs {{that have occurred}} because of endemic malaria. Sickle cell trait causes {{a change in the}} hemoglobin molecule in the blood. Normally, red blood cells have a very flexible, biconcave shape that allows them to move through narrow capillaries; however, when the modified hemoglobinS molecules are exposed to low amounts of oxygen, or crowd together due to dehydration, they can stick together forming strands that cause the cell to sickle or distort into a curved shape. In these strands the molecule is not as effective in taking or releasing oxygen, and the cell is not flexible enough to circulate freely. In the early stages of malaria, the parasite can cause infected red cells to sickle, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> removed from circulation sooner. This reduces the frequency with which malaria parasites complete their life cycle in the cell. Individuals who are homozygous (with two copies of the abnormal hemoglobin beta allele) have sickle-cell anaemia, while those who are heterozygous (with one abnormal allele and one normal allele) experience resistance to malaria without severe anemia. Although the shorter life expectancy for those with the homozygous condition would tend to disfavor the trait's survival, the trait is preserved in malaria-prone regions because of the benefits provided by the heterozygous form.|$|E

25|$|The {{frame of}} {{reference}} (s,n) is shown by the red arrows in the figure. This frame is termed natural or intrinsic because the axes continuously adjust to the moving parcel, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> the most closely connected to its fate.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{absorptive}} polarizers, {{beam splitting}} polarizers {{do not need}} to absorb and dissipate the energy of the rejected polarization state, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> more suitable for use with high intensity beams such as laser light. True polarizing beamsplitters are also useful where the two polarization components are to be analyzed or used simultaneously.|$|E
25|$|France's nuclear {{reactors}} comprise 90 per cent of EDFs capacity <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> used in load-following mode and some reactors close at weekends {{because there is}} no market for the electricity.

25|$|Hayashida {{expressed}} {{his belief that}} NES Remix should be completely authentic to its vintage roots. To this end, the compilation is based entirely on accurate emulation of the NES's hardware and on the original game software. This includes hardware glitches such as frame rate slowdown when too many characters are on the screen, and software bugs. Hayashida stated that these were intricate parts of the original and directly affect the difficulty <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not changed. Hayashida also spoke similarly about the controls; even if <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not considered ideal, he understood that <b>they</b> had <b>been</b> conceived {{that way for a}} reason <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> unaltered for NES Remix.|$|R

25|$|Prop replica company MFX {{were given}} a licence to produce replicas of the 2008 prop, and in 2009 {{released}} their replica. Strictly limited to a run of 500 units, and initially priced at £250, these replicas sold out quickly, and are now unobtainable from the original retailer. However, a surplus of stock {{at the time of}} the licence termination allowed a private dealer to purchase all remaining stock, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> still not entirely unobtainable.|$|E
25|$|Floppy {{disk drives}} are rarely fitted to modern {{computers}} and are obsolete for normal purposes, although {{internal and external}} drives can be fitted if required. Floppy disks may be the method of choice for transferring data to and from very old computers without USB or booting from floppy disks, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> sometimes used to change the firmware on, for example, BIOS chips. Devices with removable storage like older Yamaha music keyboards are also dependent on floppy disks, which require computers to process them. Newer devices are built with USB flash drive support.|$|E
25|$|Peridotite is the {{dominant}} rock of {{the upper part of}} the Earth's mantle. The compositions of peridotite nodules found in certain basalts and diamond pipes (kimberlites) are of special interest, because they provide samples of the Earth's mantle brought up from depths ranging from about 30km to 200km or more. Some of the nodules preserve isotope ratios of osmium and other elements that record processes that occurred when the earth was formed, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> of special interest to paleogeologists because they provide clues to the early composition of the Earth's mantle and the complexities of the processes that occurred.|$|E

60|$|The {{common people}} could not often resist the acts of oppression which they {{suffered}} from their rulers, for they had no power, and they could not combine together extensively enough to create a power, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> easily kept in subjection.|$|R
25|$|Historically, {{the drains}} {{were used for}} {{importing}} coal to the fens and exporting agricultural produce. They are now only used for pleasure cruising; this is restricted to the summer months, for between October and April, the water levels are maintained at a low level, {{so that there is}} scope to deal with high volumes of rainfall. Consequently, there is insufficient depth for navigation, and operation of the sluices can cause rapid changes in water level. Between April and October, their function is to provide irrigation water for agriculture, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> maintained at a higher level, although changes in level can still occur at short notice.|$|E
25|$|There {{are some}} {{morphological}} differences between queens and workers of P. sericea. Generally, queens {{are larger than}} workers in the abdominal region, but have smaller head width and wing length. Queens {{are the only ones}} with well-developed ovarioles, mature oocytes and sperm-filled spermathecae. Workers' ovaries are either underdeveloped or not developed at all, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not reproductive. Queens perform the reproductive tasks of the colony, while workers forage for resources such as food and nest-building materials. Thus, it makes sense that workers would have larger brains and wings because they must hunt and forage for food. The morphological differences seen in this caste differentiation are also seen with the species Protopolybia chartergoides and Polybia rejecta.|$|E
500|$|Burgher {{arms are}} not {{required}} to be registered with the PRV, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not protected under Swedish law (1970:498). According to the Swedish Heraldry Society, the most common way of obtaining recognition of burgher arms is by inclusion in the annually published Scandinavian Roll of Arms (Skandinavisk Vapenrulla), which was first published in 1963 and currently includes over 400 Swedish family coats of arms, along with arms from the other Scandinavian countries. Upon submission to the Swedish Heraldry Society, burgher arms are reviewed by the Swedish Collegium of Arms, whose decisions are published in the Scandinavian Roll of Arms. Approximately 3000 burgher arms are known today in Sweden. Swedish law protects [...] "arms of the nobility as well as civic bodies, while burgher arms are not , unless registered as a logotype." ...|$|E

500|$|Thatcher defined her own {{political}} philosophy {{in a major}} and controversial break with the one-nation conservatism of Edward Heath and her Conservative predecessors in an interview published in Woman's Own magazine, three months after her victory in the 1987 general election:I think we have gone through a period when too many children and people {{have been given to}} understand [...] "I have a problem, it is the Government's job to cope with it!"

[...] <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> casting their problems on society and who is society? There is no such thing! There are individual men and women and there are families and no government can do anything except through people and people look to themselves first. It is our duty to look after ourselves and then also to help look after our neighbour and life is a reciprocal business and people have got the entitlements too much in mind without the obligations.|$|E
