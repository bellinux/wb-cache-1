5|$|In December 1941, Japan launched, {{in quick}} succession, attacks on British Malaya, the United States naval base at Pearl Harbor, and Hong Kong. Churchill's {{reaction}} to the entry of the United States into the war was that Britain was now assured of victory {{and the future of}} the empire was safe, but the manner in which British forces were rapidly defeated in the Far East irreversibly harmed Britain's standing and prestige as an imperial power. Most damaging of all was the Fall of Singapore, which had previously been hailed as an impregnable fortress and the eastern equivalent of Gibraltar. The realisation that Britain could not defend its entire empire pushed Australia and New Zealand, which now appeared threatened by Japanese forces, into closer ties with the United States. This resulted in the 1951 <b>ANZUS</b> <b>Pact</b> between Australia, New Zealand and the United States of America.|$|E
25|$|As {{for other}} countries, the Vietnam War {{would prove to}} be a highly {{controversial}} conflict for New Zealand, sparking widespread protest at home from anti-Vietnam War movements modelled on their American counterparts. This conflict was also the first in which New Zealand did not fight alongside the United Kingdom, instead following the loyalties of the <b>ANZUS</b> <b>Pact.</b> New Zealand's contribution commenced in 1964 with an initial deployment of non-combatant engineers followed by an artillery battery (161 Battery RNZA) from 1965; 2 infantry companies (V and W Companies) drawn from the 1st Battalion, Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment in Malaysia from 1967; and the New Zealand SAS from 1968. New Zealand combat forces served alongside Australian forces until 1971. Two NZDF training teams followed, contributing to the allied effort to teach South Vietnamese forces to defend themselves before leaving in 1972. Over 5 years the RNZIR companies did 9 tours between them, and along with the NZSAS saw consistent action with few losses (37 KIA and 187 wounded), a testament to their skills in jungle warfare. Almost 4000 New Zealanders served in Vietnam.|$|E
50|$|Under this program, five {{countries}} contributed troops - Thailand, Australia, New Zealand, Republic of Korea (ROK), and the Philippines. <b>ANZUS</b> <b>Pact</b> allies Australia and New Zealand contributed several thousand men (61,000 and 3,890, respectively), but they agreed {{only to a}} limited support role.|$|E
2500|$|By 1962 the {{situation}} in South Vietnam had become bad enough that Diem submitted a request for assistance to the United States and its allies in order to counter the growing insurgency and the threat that it posed to South Vietnam's security. Following this the US began to send advisors to provide tactical and logistical advice to the South Vietnamese. [...] At the same time, the US sought to increase {{the legitimacy of the}} South Vietnamese government by instituting the Many Flags program, hoping to counter the communist propaganda that South Vietnam was merely a US puppet state and to involve as many nations as possible. Thus Australia, as an ally of the United States with obligations under the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) and <b>ANZUS</b> <b>Pacts,</b> and in the hope of shoring up its alliance with the US, became involved in the Vietnam War. Between 1962 and 1972 it would send almost 60,000 personnel to Vietnam, including ground troops, naval forces and air assets, and would contribute large amounts of material to the war effort.|$|R
5000|$|After {{increasingly}} acrimonious debates, in August 1986 the United States formally suspended {{its security}} obligations to New Zealand {{that it had}} under the <b>ANZUS</b> mutual defence <b>pact.</b> This suspension remains in effect today, although the US no longer carries nuclear weapons aboard its surface naval vessels. In 1987 New Zealand passed legislation making the country a nuclear free zone, namely the New Zealand Nuclear Free Zone, Disarmament, and Arms Control Act; {{in the same year}} the US retaliated with the Broomfield Act, designating New Zealand as a [...] "friend" [...] rather than an [...] "ally". Relations between New Zealand and the US have had several ups and downs since then.|$|R

50|$|Britain's {{entry into}} the European Economic Community in 1973 forced New Zealand into a more {{independent}} role. The British move restricted New Zealand's trade access to its biggest market, and it sought new trading partners in Asia, America and the Middle East. Australia and New Zealand signed the free-trade Closer Economic Relations agreement in 1983. The election of the Fourth Labour Government in 1984 marked a new period of independent foreign policy. Nuclear-powered and nuclear-armed ships were banned from New Zealand waters, effectively removing New Zealand from the <b>ANZUS</b> <b>pact.</b> Immigration laws were liberalised, leading to a massive increase in immigration from Asia. The Fourth National Government (1990-1999) liberalised trade by removing most tariffs and import restrictions.|$|E

50|$|Shortly {{before the}} 1966 election, Labour had {{replaced}} Nordmeyer as leader with Norman Kirk, but Kirk had insufficient time to consolidate {{his position and}} the party was damaged by this and division over economic policy. The main difference between the parties in terms of policy was commitment to the Vietnam War. The National government had committed {{a small number of}} troops, seeing support for American wars as a necessary payment for America's commitment (through the <b>ANZUS</b> <b>pact)</b> to protect New Zealand. Labour was opposed to New Zealand involvement in the war and made troop recall a major platform. However the strongest anti-war sentiment was probably amongst young people, and at this stage the voting age was 21. The election resulted in National losing 3.5% of the popular vote, and one seat, to Social Credit. This marked the first time since 1943 that a seat had been won by a party other than Labour or National.|$|E
50|$|The government's most {{significant}} policies concerned attempts {{to create a}} distinct New Zealand identity, both internally and in the world. For most of its history, New Zealand had been, economically, culturally and politically, highly dependent on Britain. This began to change during World War II, {{when it became clear}} that Britain was no longer able to defend its former colonies in the Pacific. As Britain began to turn away from what was left of its former Empire and towards Europe, New Zealanders became less inclined to think of themselves as British. Initially the country turned instead to the United States, and so entered into the <b>ANZUS</b> <b>pact</b> with the US and Australia, and aided the US in the Vietnam War. However, by the early 1970s many New Zealanders felt the need for genuine national independence, a feeling strengthened when Britain joined the European Economic Community in 1973, causing serious problems for New Zealand trade. Most of this government's policies can be seen in this light.|$|E

50|$|Over recent decades, Australia's foreign {{relations}} {{have been driven}} by a close association with the United States through the <b>ANZUS</b> <b>pact,</b> and {{by a desire to}} develop relationships with Asia and the Pacific, particularly through ASEAN and the Pacific Islands Forum. In 2005 Australia secured an inaugural seat at the East Asia Summit following its accession to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia, and in 2011 attended the Sixth East Asia Summit in Indonesia. Australia {{is a member of the}} Commonwealth of Nations, in which the Commonwealth Heads of Government meetings provide the main forum for co-operation.Australia has pursued the cause of international trade liberalisation. It led the formation of the Cairns Group and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation. Australia is a member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the World Trade Organization, and has pursued several major bilateral free trade agreements, most recently the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement and Closer Economic Relations with New Zealand, with another free trade agreement being negotiated with China—the Australia-China Free Trade Agreement—and Japan, South Korea in 2011, Australia-Chile Free Trade Agreement, and as of November 2015 has put the Trans-Pacific Partnership before parliament for ratification.|$|E
50|$|This period {{marked a}} shift in New Zealand's foreign policy. Before World War II New Zealand lacked an {{independent}} foreign policy, instead opting to simply follow and support Britain. New Zealand's participation in World War II was part of this - Prime Minister Michael Joseph Savage had declared that 'where Britain goes we go', and New Zealand troops had fought almost exclusively in Europe {{rather than in the}} Pacific, where Japanese forces threatened New Zealand. At {{the start of the war}} it had been assumed that the Royal Navy would protect New Zealand, but the Fall of Singapore showed this to be a false assumption. New Zealand turned to the United States for protection. The beginning of the Cold War, and communist successes in China made many New Zealanders feel in need of this protection. New Zealand therefore entered the <b>ANZUS</b> <b>pact</b> with Australia and the United States, each pledging to defend the others if they were attacked. Fear of the communist threat from Asia also motivated the introduction of compulsory military training and New Zealand's participation in the Korean War and the Malayan Emergency. However, there was still considerable support for Britain, which led to New Zealand giving Britain moral support (but no practical help) during the Suez Crisis.|$|E
50|$|President Johnson {{had already}} {{appointed}} General William C. Westmoreland to succeed General Harkins as Commander of MACV in June 1964. Under Westmoreland, {{the expansion of}} American troop strength in South Vietnam took place. American forces rose from 16,000 during 1964 to more than 553,000 by 1969. With the U.S. decision to escalate its involvement, <b>ANZUS</b> <b>Pact</b> allies Australia and New Zealand agreed to contribute troops and matériel to the conflict. They were quickly joined by the Republic of Korea (second only to the Americans in troop strength), Thailand, and the Philippines. The U.S. paid for (through aid dollars) and logistically supplied all of the allied forces.Meanwhile, political affairs in Saigon were finally settling down — {{at least as far}} as the Americans were concerned. On February 14 the most recent military junta, the National Leadership Committee, installed Air Vice-Marshal Nguyễn Cao Kỳ as prime minister. In 1966, the junta selected General Nguyễn Văn Thiệu to run for president with Ky on the ballot as the vice-presidential candidate in the 1967 election. Thieu and Ky were elected and remained in office for the duration of the war. In the presidential election of 1971, Thieu ran for the presidency unopposed. With the installation of the Thieu and Ky government (the Second Republic), the U.S. had a pliable, stable, and semi-legitimate government in Saigon with which to deal.|$|E
50|$|World War II {{was a major}} {{turning point}} for both countries, as they {{realised}} that {{they could no longer}} rely on the protection of Britain. Australia was particularly struck by this realisation, as it was directly targeted by the Empire of Japan, with Darwin bombed and Broome attacked. Subsequently, both countries sought closer ties with the United States. This resulted in the <b>ANZUS</b> <b>pact</b> of 1951, in which Australia, New Zealand and the United States agreed to defend each other in the event of enemy attack. Although no such attack occurred until, arguably, 11 September 2001, Australia and New Zealand both contributed troops to the Korean and Vietnam Wars. Australia's contribution to the Vietnam War in particular was much larger than New Zealand's; while Australia introduced conscription, New Zealand sent only a token force. Australia has continued to be more committed to the American alliance, ANZUS, than New Zealand; although both countries felt considerable unease about American military policy in the 1980s, New Zealand angered the United States by refusing port access to nuclear ships into its nuclear-free zone from 1985 and in retaliation, the United States 'suspended' its obligations otherwise owed under the alliance treaty to New Zealand. Australia has made a significant contribution to the Iraq War, while New Zealand's much smaller military contribution was limited to UN-authorised reconstruction tasks.|$|E
40|$|Buckley {{describes}} how Britain took the independent step of recognizing the People's Republic of China, a step {{which led to}} problems about China being invited to the San Francisco conference. After China's entry into the war in Korea, Hong Kong's trade was squeezed through trade embargos imposed by the United States and its exposed security system was vulnerable, {{had it not been}} for the presence of the US 7 th fleet in the Taiwan Straits. Ferretti shows that the leading ideas of Yoshida Shigeru on relations between Japan and the People's Republic of China did not change after the failure of the Dulles-Morrison Agreement as he continued to pursue normalization with the PRC. He had the idea of joining the Colombo Plan and entering the markets of Southeast Asia by establishing a preferential bilateral axis with Britain but this was ultimately rejected by Britain at the time of Yoshida's visit to Europe in 1954. Meaney describes External Affairs Minister Percy Spender's views on the need for a Pacific Pact. When it became clear from discussions with Dulles early in 1951 that the treaty with Japan would not be punitive or restrict her rearming, Australia called for some sort of security agreement with the United States. This came to fruition as the <b>ANZUS</b> <b>Pact</b> which was signed and ratified more or less simultaneously with the San Francisco treaty. Trotter discusses New Zealand's reaction to the Australian initiative over the need for a security pact. While she had considerable reservations, most notably over relations with Britain, she appreciated the need for security guarantees and joined the <b>ANZUS</b> <b>Pact.</b> San Francisco Peace Treaty, Peoples Republic of China, Korean War, Hong Kong, US 7 th Fleet, Taiwan Straits, Colombo Plan, American-Japanese Security Pact, <b>ANZUS</b> <b>Pact,</b> Yoshida Shigeru, Percy Spender, John Foster Dulles, Herbert Morrison, Southeast Asia, Japan, Britain, Australia, New Zealand, United States. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{attempts to}} explore the links between Australia and Britain. In particular, how these links have degraded over time, and the factors associated with that decline. The research begins with an historical overview, surveying why the British-Australian links began. The nation's origin as a British penal colony, subsequent settlement by British migrants, and development by Britain being a major factor behind Australia calling Britain the 'mother country'. The legacy of British imperialism, therefore, is incredibly robust. The legacy of imperialism is critical to Australian international relations, with British-Australian links being fundamental to how Australia projects itself globally. This research also explored the different spheres of influence {{on the degradation of}} British-Australian links, namely, the USA, European integration and Asia. The USA is now dominant in security, the <b>ANZUS</b> <b>pact</b> securing Australia from Asian threats. European integration has separated the British-Australian economic co-operation, forcing Australia to seek the Asian market. Asia has now become the priority for many aspects of Australian international relations. Economically, Asia is dominant, its markets crucial to Australia. Once a source of peril, Asia is now firmly entrenched as Australia's economic focus. Emergent Asian regionalism has meant Australia has, via Asia been subject to Global market forces. Via Asia, these Global forces are the future for Australia in the economic realm. Culturally, Australia has been subject to sustained Asian immigration, making the nation multicultural. British-Australia links now exist only through ancestry and imperial sentiment; in most other aspects the chains of imperialism have been broken...|$|E
