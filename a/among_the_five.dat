5|$|Contrary to {{the view}} here popularized by Cassius Dio, however, Nerva had in fact little choice with regard to his successor.

Schiff also participated in the city's first mayoral debate dealing specifically with issues concerning Minneapolis's Somali population, an event that took place on May 31 and was hosted at a Somali restaurant on Lake Street. Schiff received endorsements from the Minneapolis Firefighters Union, state representative Karen Clark, and former Vikings punter Chris Kluwe, among others.|$|E
5|$|As {{the only}} {{scientist}} <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>five</b> AEC commissioners, {{it fell to}} Libby to defend the Eisenhower administration's stance on atmospheric nuclear testing. He argued that the dangers of radiation from nuclear tests were less than that from chest X-rays, and therefore {{less important than the}} risk of having an inadequate nuclear arsenal, but his arguments failed to convince the scientific community or reassure the public. In January 1956, he publicly revealed the existence of Project Sunshine, a series of research studies to ascertain the impact of radioactive fallout on the world's population that he had initiated in 1953 while serving on the GAC. By 1958, even Libby and Teller were supporting limits on atmospheric nuclear testing.|$|E

5|$|Typhoon Pongsona {{produced}} {{strong wind}} gusts peaking at 278km/h (173mph 1-min), which left the entire island of Guam without power and destroyed about 1,300houses. With strong building standards and experience from repeated typhoon strikes, {{there were no}} fatalities directly related to Pongsona, although there was one indirect death from flying glass. Damage on the island totaled over $700million (2002 USD, $ USD), making Pongsona <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>five</b> costliest typhoons on the island. The typhoon also caused heavy damage on Rota {{and elsewhere in the}} Northern Mariana Islands, {{and as a result of}} its impact the name was retired.|$|E

5|$|Across Guam, damage totaled over $700million (2002USD, $ USD), {{placing it}} <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>five</b> costliest typhoons on the island. The typhoon injured 193people, as {{reported}} by the Guam Department of Health; most were lacerations and fractures caused by flying glass and other debris. There was one indirect death attributed to the storm, when a 71-year-old woman was cut by flying glass and subsequently suffered a fatal heart attack; medical help could not reach her due to the intensity of the storm. As six typhoons had passed directly over the island during the previous ten years, officials in Guam enacted strong building standards, keeping deaths and injuries to a minimum. The typhoon was considered by the public the worst typhoon to ever strike the island due to the large eye affecting most of the population.|$|E

5|$|An off spinner, Johnson was {{a member}} of Bradman’s first-choice team, playing in four of the five Tests before being dropped for the final rubber. He also played in the matches against Worcestershire, the MCC and Leveson-Gower's XI, where Australia {{selected}} their strongest possible team. However, Johnson was not prominent in the Test success, taking seven wickets at 61.00, his best result being 3/72 in the first innings of the Second Test. <b>Among</b> <b>the</b> <b>five</b> frontline bowlers used in four or more Tests, Lindwall, Miller, Toshack, Johnston and Johnson, the last had the worst average by a factor of almost two; Toshack averaged 33.09 and the others less than 23.50. Lindwall and Johnston took 27 wickets each, while Miller and Toshack took 13 and 11 respectively. Johnson’s economy rate was the second worst of the quintet and his strike rate of 156.86 was more than twice as bad as the others, with the exception of Toshack (94.46). Johnson also had little impact with the bat, scoring 51 runs at 10.20, but he did take five catches in the slips.|$|E
5|$|During 2009, Steven Goodman {{and colleagues}} {{published}} two papers that found {{a total of}} five genetically and morphologically distinct species within Miniopterus manavi as defined by Peterson and colleagues (1995), up to four of which {{can be found in a}} single locality. In order to determine the true identity of M.manavi, Goodman and Claude Maminirina obtained bats near the type locality of M.manavi (the site where the original material was collected, from which the species was described) for inclusion in the analysis; they also sequenced one of Thomas's original specimens. <b>Among</b> <b>the</b> <b>five</b> species they identified, M.griveaudi occurs on Grande Comore and Anjouan and in northern and western Madagascar; M.aelleni occurs on Anjouan and in northern and western Madagascar; M.brachytragos is found in northern Madagascar only; M.mahafaliensis is confined to the southwestern part of the island; and M.manavi itself is known only from the eastern edge of the Central Highlands. These five species are not each other's closest relatives according to analyses of cytochrome b sequences and their similarities reflect convergent evolution. Cytochrome b suggested that the closest relative of M.manavi is the slightly larger M.petersoni from southeastern Madagascar. Two specimens of M.manavi differed by 1.3% in their cytochrome b sequences and by 2.5% from M.petersoni.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Kirthana Ramisetti of Entertainment Weekly posted that The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr., {{deserved}} to be released on DVD.

Lacey spent several years lobbying industry contacts to get Brisco released on DVD. This led to correspondence with Cuse, who also wanted to get a DVD set produced. On July 18, 2006, Warner Home Video released The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.: The Complete Series on DVD in Region 1, an 8-disc DVD set that contains all 27 episodes of the series. The release includes commentary tracks from Campbell and Cuse; an interactive menu of Brisco's signature references narrated by Campbell; The History of Brisco County, Jr., documentary; a feature called A Reading from the Book of Bruce; and another gallery hosted by Campbell focusing on the gadgets from the show.|$|E

5|$|Two {{practice}} sessions were {{held on the}} Friday before the race: each lasted for an hour. A third session, also an hour long, {{took place on the}} Saturday morning prior to qualifying. The first session provided limited opportunities to the drivers due to heavy rain and standing water on the course. As a result, only 11 of the 25 entrants participated in the session, of which Takuma Sato set the fastest time. Conditions improved during the second practice, and all 25 drivers set times. Will Power was quickest; marginally over a tenth of a second faster than Wilson. Ryan Briscoe, Simon Pagenaud and Tony Kanaan completed the top five, all recording times within half a second of Power. In the third practice, Scott Dixon recorded the fastest time, trailed by Power and Ryan Hunter-Reay. Briscoe and Wilson also lapped the track in under 72 seconds to finish <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>five</b> quickest drivers.|$|E
