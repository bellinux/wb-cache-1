25|$|Apart from {{petitions}} by {{the company}} or creditors, an administrator {{has the power to}} move a company into liquidation, carrying out an asset sale, if its attempts at rescue come to an end. If the liquidator is not an administrator, he is appointed by the court usually on the nomination of the majority of creditors. The liquidator can be removed by the same groups. Once in place, the liquidator has the power to do anything set out in sections 160, 165 and Schedule 4 for the purpose of its main duty. This includes bringing legal claims that belonged to the company. This is to realise the value of the company, and distribute the <b>assets.</b> <b>Assets</b> must always be distributed in the order of statutory priority: releasing the claims of fixed security interest holders, paying preferential creditors (the liquidator's expenses, employees and pensions, and the ring fenced fund for unsecured creditors), the floating charge holder, unsecured creditors, deferred debts, and finally shareholders. In the performance of these basic tasks, the liquidator owes its duties to the company, not individual creditors or shareholders. They can be liable for breach of duty by exercising powers for improper purposes (e.g. not distributing money to creditors in the right order,) and may be sued additionally for negligence. As a person in a fiduciary position, he may have no conflict of interest or make secret profits. Nevertheless, liquidators (like administrators and some receivers) can generally be said to have a broad degree of discretion about the conduct of liquidation. They must realise assets to distribute to creditors, and they may attempt to maximise these by bringing new litigation, either to avoid transactions entered into by the insolvent company, or by suing the former directors.|$|E

An analysis of post-war data produces two insights. First, using a cointegration approach, the existence of long-run net foreign <b>asset</b> equilibrium can be identified: it is a function of demographic variables and public debt.

50|$|The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention's Opinion no.38/2013 {{asserted}} that the justice owed to Michel-Thierry Atangana was tripartite: 1) He must be released, 2) There must be prosecution of the perpetrators of this injustice, and 3) He must be rehabilitated and recompensed. To date, Michel has been released - {{but there has been}} no action against the perpetrators of his denial of rights and he has been neither rehabilitated nor recompensed, with his assets remaining confiscated and the Cameroonian/French governments seemingly satisfied with achieving 1/3 of the UN's wishes. Michel continues to fight for the justice that he is owed, not simply because he has suffered enormously and deserves help in his reintroduction to society - but also because arbitrary detention is a global issue stemmed in corrupt governments who think their crimes are easily ignored. If Michel fails to receives his justice, it is expected that perpetrators of global injustice through arbitrary detention will continue to feel immune to punishment because even when their crime is discovered and publicized, it would seem that simply releasing the victim absolves of any further recourse and perpetrators can thus retain the victim's <b>assets</b> <b>assets,</b> ignore their rehabilitation, and go completely unpunished.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: When the {{production}} sector {{of a small}} open economy with an internationally determined interest rate adjusts gradually to some exogenous shocks, then during a transitional period wage income also does. The paper argues that slowly falling (increasing) wages create transitory life-cycle savings (dis-) incentives which vanish in the long-run when wages become stationary again. Such a transitory life-cycle savings component comes {{on top of a}} base component created by the permanently operating long-run savings incentives, and it easily gives rise to non-monotonic adjustment of <b>assets.</b> <b>Assets</b> may even move first in a direction that is opposite to the implied long-run changes. ...|$|E
