40|$|The future digital {{television}} will provide viewers new interactive services, e. g., Electronic Programming Guide, TV shopping, video-on-demand, etc. The set-top box needs a middleware to launch these applications before interaction and collect garbage after quitting or switching to another service. It is the <b>application</b> <b>manager’s</b> responsibility {{to manage the}} lifecycles of the services. Thus, the <b>application</b> <b>manager</b> {{plays a crucial role}} in controlling the applications and efficiently utilizing the limited resources of set-top box. This paper presents a design of an <b>application</b> <b>manager,</b> including a lifecycle model of an application and a communication protocol between an application and the <b>application</b> <b>manager.</b> Also, the <b>Application</b> Information Table (AIT), which carries the essential application signaling information in a transport stream is introduced.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a cooperative caching architecture suitable for continuous media (CM) proxy caching in MANET environments. The proposed scheme introduces an <b>application</b> <b>manager</b> component, which is interposed between traditional Internet CM applications {{and the network}} layer. The <b>application</b> <b>manager</b> transparently performs data location and service migration of active CM streaming sessions so as to exploit nearby data sources based on the dynamic topology of a MANET. We propose two data location schemes - Cache-State - a link-state based scheme and Reactive - an on-demand scheme. Since service migration can occur frequently, the <b>application</b> <b>manager</b> uses soft-state signaling techniques to communicate between remote <b>application</b> <b>managers</b> by translating hard-state application signaling, such as Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) into soft-state messages. The proposed schemes are evaluated through simulation studies using the NS simulator. Simulation studies show that both Cache-State and Reactive schemes demonstrate significant QoS improvements and reduced bandwidth consumption...|$|R

In {{the case that the}} PS is implemented as a stand alone component, diameter [16] is used to provide a secure interface between the AM and the PS. CMTS is the policy enforcement point. It allocates the authorized resources to the traffic flow according to the tokens assigned by Policy Server. The interface between PS and CMTS is based on COPS [19].|$|R

40|$|Current GRID {{technology}} provides users/programmers with {{extended and}} comprehensive middleware tools covering all the basic aspects a programmer {{must deal with}} when writing GRID aware applications. Programmers of GRID aware applications use such middleware systems to gather the needed resources, stage code and data to the selected computing resources, schedule computations on them and so on. Overall, a huge programming effort is {{required in order to}} come to a working, efficient GRID aware application code. Here we propose a different approach. By recognizing that most GRID applications share a common parallel/distributed structure, we propose to use <b>application</b> <b>managers</b> that take care of all the details involved in the implementation of well known GRID aware application schemas. Such <b>application</b> <b>managers</b> use the functionalities of a RISC GRID core run time system (RGC). The RGC may be built on top of existing GRID middleware. Programmers of GRID aware applications, therefore, do not directly use GRID middleware. Rather, they structure the application using the available <b>application</b> <b>managers.</b> The <b>application</b> <b>managers,</b> in turn, invoke the basic GRID services provided by RGC to accomplish both functional and performance user requirements...|$|R
40|$|Studying {{development}} of interactive services for digital television {{is a leading}} edge area of work as there is minimal research or precedent to guide their design. Published research is limited and therefore this thesis aims at establishing a set of computing methods using Java and XML technology for future set-top box interactive services. The main issues include middleware architecture, a Java user interface for digital television, content representation and return channel communications. The middleware architecture used {{was made up of}} an <b>Application</b> <b>Manager,</b> <b>Application</b> Programming Interface (API), a Java Virtual Machine, etc., which were arranged in a layered model to ensure the interoperability. The <b>application</b> <b>manager</b> was designed to control the lifecycle of Xlets; manage set-top box resources and remote control keys and to adapt the graphical device environment. The architecture of both <b>application</b> <b>manager</b> and Xlet forms the basic framework for running multiple interactive services simultaneously in future set-top box designs.
