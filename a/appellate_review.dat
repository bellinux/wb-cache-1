In a dissent that both White and Marshall signed, William O. Douglas countered that the 1934 Act was remedial legislation which the Court had, as such, previously held was to be construed broadly.

500|$|However, {{the court}} found that the Church enjoyed the {{protection}} of the free exercise of religion clause in the First Amendment, and that it could use the [...] "ministerial exemptions" [...] in employment law to deflect litigation over its treatment of its members. The judge ruled that the First Amendment disallowed the courts from [...] "examining church operations rooted in religious scripture". Bringing the Church to account for how it disciplined its members was [...] "precisely the type of entanglement that the religion clauses prohibit." [...] However, the 9th Circuit did suggest that other types of claims would withstand <b>appellate</b> <b>review,</b> such as assault, battery or [...] "any of a number of other theories that might have better fit the evidence." [...] The ruling has effectively meant {{that it is impossible to}} bring charges against the Church based on claims of 'trafficking in persons.' As one attorney has put it, [...] "Here is a court saying, albeit in a civil situation... that there is nothing improper with this type of conduct and no ill motive can be imbued to the church."

500|$|The Chief Justice {{proceeded}} to detail the origin, purpose, and case law {{history of the}} separation of powers. Article Three of the United States Constitution establishes an independent judiciary with [...] "distinct and inviolable authority." [...] Such separation of powers [...] "safeguards individual freedom." [...] As Alexander Hamilton wrote in Federalist No. 78, quoting Montesquieu, [...] "'there is no liberty if the power of judging be not separated from the legislative and executive powers.'" [...] The separation of powers between the judiciary and legislative branches was examined in detail in Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc. (1995), in which the Supreme Court found unconstitutional a statute that reopened a case after a final judgment. At the time of the framing of the Constitution, judicial and legislative powers were often intermingled. The colonial legislatures often performed many of the functions of the judiciary, such as functioning as the court of last resort, granting new trials, and providing original review, <b>appellate</b> <b>review,</b> stays of judgments, and providing other types of relief [...] "in an effort to do what is agreeable to Right and Justice." [...] The colonial charters of Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island gave the legislatures the authority of court of last resort. In New Hampshire, judicial appeals were directed to the governor and his council, but routinely referred to the legislature for discussion. And for over half a century, the colonial assembly of Virginia could review court judgments. The involvement of legislatures in judicial matters [...] "intensified during the American Revolution," [...] which [...] "soon prompted a sense of a sharp necessity to separate the legislative from the judicial power." [...] The interference of the legislatures in judicial matters [...] "figur prominently in the Framers' decision to devise a system for securing liberty through the division of power." [...] This resulted in Article Three of the United States Constitution, which forms the [...] "central pillar of judicial independence" [...] and places [...] "'he judicial Power of the United States'... in 'one supreme Court', and in such 'inferior Courts'" [...] as Congress may establish. This judicial power extends [...] "to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority." ...|$|E

[...] According to {{the text of the}} statute, the [...] "power to review a sentence for reasonableness arises only when the sentencing court has departed from the applicable guideline range." [...] The situation here was not that the statute did not explicitly set forth a standard of review, but rather that the statute did explicitly set forth such a standard, but then excised from the statute the provision that established the standard. [...] Was it proper for the Court to [...] "look for some congressional 'implication' of a different standard of review in the remnants of the statute that the Court has left standing?

2500|$|Justice Alito saw no {{difference}} between the DSL and the post-Booker sentencing scheme in place for the federal courts.

2500|$|Furthermore, {{it was not}} as {{easy for}} the courts to apply the [...] "reasonableness" [...] {{standard}} in the context of <b>appellate</b> <b>review</b> of sentences as the majority would have liked. [...] First, there was no history of applying that standard under the Guidelines regime. [...] Second, under the majority's holding that standard would apply across the board to all sentence appeals, including those that involved no legal error.

2500|$|Alito {{pointed out}} that {{all members of the}} Court agreed that the {{indeterminate}} sentencing scheme in place for federal crimes would satisfy the Blakely rule, and that a purely advisory Guidelines system would do so as well. [...] The characteristic that persuaded a majority of the Court to approve the current federal sentencing scheme, consisting of sentencing guidelines ranges from which trial judges were permitted to depart, was the fact that all sentences were subject to <b>appellate</b> <b>review</b> for [...] "reasonableness." [...] All of these systems require trial judges to make factual findings on some level of generality. [...] Under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, these findings were somewhat specific; under the indeterminate sentencing scheme, they were not. [...] Yet in both schemes the judge makes findings that allow them to impose an appropriate sentence.|$|E

In the prior decisions where the Court had struck down aggravating factors for vagueness, the jury instructions did not define the terms for the jury, and state supreme court decisions did not define these words any further. These two flaws had led the Court to strike down death sentences predicated on these findings because they posed too great a risk that the death sentences had been imposed arbitrarily or capriciously.|$|E

Even as criminal procedural protections were expanded {{in the latter half}} of the twentieth century, the harmless error rule operated to dilute the effect of many of these constitutional guarantees - the right to jury trial being no exception. However, while a tradeoff between important process values and the Constitution 2 ̆ 7 s protection of individual rights is inherent in the harmless error rule, recent applications of <b>appellate</b> harmless error <b>review</b> to certain jury-related constitutional errors have exceeded the scope of the initial compromise.
