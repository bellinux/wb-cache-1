40|$|Thermophilic <b>aerobic</b> <b>biological</b> <b>treatment</b> was {{studied as}} a {{potentially}} advantageous technology for high-strength and high temperature waste streams. Thermophilic treatment was proposed as advantageous because of elevated biokinetic rates and low growth yields while retaining the robust nature of conventional <b>aerobic</b> <b>biological</b> <b>treatment</b> to simultaneously degrade {{a multitude of}} pollutants. Thermophilic systems, however, were known to support a non-flocculating biomass that resisted particle separation by conventional means, and were suspected to support a microbial community of limited diversity that adversely affected performance. This research was undertaken to verify or refute these proposed advantages and disadvantages. ^ Biokinetic rates were investigated at temperatures from 25 – 65 °C during the biological treatment of a synthetic wastewater containing gelatin and α-lactose as principal organic constituents. Measurement of the maximum specific substrate utilization rate in batch culture revealed that biodegradation rates were relatively constant over the temperature range studied. Also, biological treatment at thermophilic temperatures was less adept at degrading multiple pollutants simultaneously and achieving chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal. This latter trait was also demonstrated during the biological treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater as residual COD levels increased {{by an average of}} 60 mg 1 − 1 per °C increase over the temperature range of 30 – 60 °C. Investigation of microbial community structure by nucleotide sequence analysis of 16 S rRNA genes suggested that the underlying mechanism for reduced metabolic ability at thermophilic temperatures was a reduced phylogenetic diversity. ^ Thermophilic treatment in continuous-flow bioreactors was also studied in chemostats and membrane-coupled bioreactors (MBRs). Chemostat analysis demonstrated that the bacterial maintenance requirement exhibited by the microbes supported by thermophilic reactors was similar to that previously reported for mesophilic systems. This suggests that thermophilic systems do not benefit from low cell yields as predicted. Thermophilic MBRs were successfully demonstrated to maintain high biomass levels and produce a high quality effluent despite the lack of bioflocculation at thermophilic temperatures. ^ In conclusion, thermophilic <b>aerobic</b> <b>biological</b> <b>treatment</b> does not offer many advantages compared to conventional mesophilic processes. The underlying mechanism for the poor performance of thermophilic bioreactors is likely a reduced microbial diversity that results in reduced bacterial function. ...|$|E

Solar photo-Fenton treatment was performed in Compound Parabolic Collector pilot-plants, and <b>biological</b> <b>treatment</b> in an immobilized biomass reactor pilot-plant. Analytical determinations included the measurement of dissolved organic carbon, chemical oxygen demand, inorganic compounds (chloride, ammonium, nitrate), formed during degradation, acute toxicity tests applying Vibrio Fischeri luminescence bacteria and the Zahn-Wellens biodegradability test. The synthetic wastewater contained 200 mg/L of each compound, an initial DOC of 200 mg/l and an initial COD of 700 mg/L.

Two methods were utilised to prepare of TiO 2 /C composites. AC was coated with TiO 2 derived from the hydrolysis of Ti(OPr') 4, and with Degussa P 25 using a polyvinyl alcohol binder that was subsequently carbonised in an inert atmosphere. The TiO 2 /C composites were characterised by nitrogen adsorption, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, UV-visible reflectance spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The AC and TiO 2 /C adsorption capacity for phenol was observed to be affected by the surface area and surface chemistry of the adsorbent, as well as the pH of solution. The NPEO adsorption capacity and rate of adsorption was found to be dependant on the pore size distribution of the adsorbent. The effect of surface chemistry and solution pH was minimal. The selectivity of the adsorbent in the adsorption of NPEO was studied using HPLC. The rate of photooxidation of phenol was found to be first-order and greatest under basic conditions. This is attributed to changes in the electronic structure of the TiO 2 under these conditions that increases the rate of reduction of molecular oxygen, often considered to be the rate limiting step.

The results indicated that the <b>aerobic</b> <b>biological</b> <b>treatment</b> is effective in reducing and stabilising organic matter in wastewater...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Based on {{the problem}} of {{industrial}} wastewater of 4 -Toluene Sulfonic Acid (4 -TSA) with characteristics of high concentration and high toxicity, also low treatment efficiency by common <b>biological</b> <b>treatment,</b> this study was used <b>aerobic</b> <b>biological</b> fluidized bed (ABFB) to analyze the impact of 4 -TSA treatment by changing water load chemical oxygen demand (COD), aeration amount, and pH value of input water, and so on technological parameters. The result showed that the average degradation rate of 4 -TSA in wastewater can researched to 96. 9 % under condition of reactor steadily running, HRT= 9 h, temperature 25 ℃, pH= 8. 0, ORP- 141 ～- 93 mV，DO 3. 5 ～ 8. 72 mg/L, the inflow water 4 -TSA concentration 600 mg/L, aerobic amount 210 L/h. Therefore, the best aerobic amount to treat wastewater contained 4 -TSA is 210 L/h in <b>aerobic</b> <b>biological</b> fluidized bed. The degradation rate of 4 -TSA is decreased as the increasing of water load. The scanning electronic microscope (SEM) indicated that the bacillus is the mainly part on the biological carrier, suspended sludge is composed by aurous and bacillus...|$|R
40|$|This work {{studies the}} use of {{biological}} and combined biological/enzymatic treatments in phenol degradation. The systems studied were conventional batch <b>aerobic</b> <b>biological</b> followed or preceded by enzymatic treatment. Tyrosinase extracted from the mushroom Agaricus bispora was employed. <b>Biological</b> <b>treatment</b> efficiently degraded effluents containing up to 420 mg. L- 1 of phenol, removing 97 % of the COD and 99 % of the phenol in 48 -hour batches. Alterations in phenol concentration intake reduced treatment efficiency significantly. Enzymatic polishing of biotreated effluent removed up to 75 % of the remaining phenol in a four-hour reaction with 46 U. mL- 1 of tyrosinase and 50 mg. L- 1 of chitosan (used as coagulant). Enzymatic pretreatment with 20 U. mL- 1 of tyrosinase reduced the phenol concentration by 25 % after 2 hours of reaction, although initial COD increased up to 58 %. The subsequent <b>biological</b> <b>treatment</b> of that enzymatic pretreated effluent reduced COD to 151 mgO 2. L- 1 and phenol concentration to 1 mg. L- 1 in 24 -hours batches...|$|R
40|$|Naphthenic acids (NAs) are {{carboxylic}} acids {{found in}} crude oil and petroleum products. The {{objectives of the}} research presented here were to: a) assess the occurrence and fate of NAs in crude oil and refinery wastewater streams; b) evaluate the biotransformation potential and inhibitory effects of NAs under nitrifying, denitrifying and methanogenic/fermentative conditions; c) investigate the factors affecting NA biotransformation under aerobic conditions and the microbes involved; and d) assess the toxicity of individual model NAs using quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) and {{examine the effect of}} structure on NA biotransformation potential. NAs are ubiquitous in refinery wastewater streams and the desalter brine was found to be the main source of NAs in refinery wastewater. A commercial NA mixture was not biodegraded under nitrate-reducing or methanogenic/fermentative conditions. NAs were degraded under aerobic conditions by an NA-enriched culture; however, a residual fraction was not degraded under all conditions studied. The results indicated that NAs are not inherently recalcitrant and the residual fraction was due to the individual NA concentrations being below the minimum substrate concentrations at which they are no longer degraded. A fraction of the NA mixture was completely mineralized to carbon dioxide, with the remaining portion biotransformed to more oxidized intermediates. Overall, the results indicated that NAs were degraded under <b>aerobic</b> conditions; however, <b>biological</b> <b>treatment</b> of NA-bearing wastewater will not completely remove NA concentrations and thus, <b>biological</b> <b>treatment</b> must be combined with physical/chemical treatment to achieve complete NA removal.
