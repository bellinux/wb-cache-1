5|$|Rivera rebounded in 2008 {{and began}} the year with 16consecutive {{scoreless}} innings pitched and 28consecutive save opportunities converted, both personal bests to start a season. His first-half performance, highlighted by a 1.06ERA and 23saves in as many opportunities, garnered him his ninth All-Star selection. Leading up to the 2008 MLB All-Star Game, which was held at Yankee Stadium in the venue's final year of existence, a few sportswriters proposed making Rivera the AL's starting pitcher {{as a tribute to}} him and his home ballpark. He instead was used as a reliever in the AL's extra-inning win. In the final month of the season, he recorded two milestones: on September15, he recorded his 479th save to pass Lee Smith for second all-time in regular season saves; on September21, in the final game at Yankee Stadium, Rivera threw the final pitch in the venue's history, retiring Brian Roberts of the Baltimore Orioles on a ground-out. After the Yankees missed the postseason {{for the first time in}} his career, Rivera disclosed that he had suffered from shoulder pain throughout the year. Tests revealed calcification of the <b>acromioclavicular</b> <b>joint</b> in his throwing shoulder, for which he underwent minor arthroscopic surgery in the offseason.|$|E

25|$|A {{shoulder}} separation occurs {{where the}} collarbone (clavicle) meets the shoulder blade (scapula). When ligaments {{that hold the}} AC (<b>acromioclavicular)</b> <b>joint</b> together are partially or completely torn, the outer end of the clavicle may slip out of place, preventing it from properly meeting the scapula. Most often the injury {{is caused by a}} blow to the shoulder or by falling on an outstretched hand. After injury it is hard to do a 180 degrees rotation.|$|E

40|$|Studying {{of anatomy}} humeral and <b>acromioclavicular</b> <b>joints</b> {{according}} to static and functional ultrasonography in norm and at hypermobility was an {{objective of this}} research. For the decision of an object in view we had been surveyed 45 persons at the age from 15 till 59 years (middle age has made 32, 4 ± 1, 6 year), from them 32 men and 13 women. To clinical signs of hypermobility an investigated contingent have divided on two groups: the basic – 15 patients and control – 30 patients. It is established that humeral and <b>acromioclavicular</b> <b>joints</b> on ultrasonograms the features have display of elements. In research are described not changed soft tissue and bone structures, and also variants of their normal structure.

25|$|The {{shoulder}} {{consists of}} a ball-and-socket joint formed by the humerus and scapula and their surrounding structures - ligaments, muscles, tendons - which support the bones and maintain the relationship of one to another. These supporting structures attach to the clavicle, humerus, and scapula, the latter providing the glenoid cavity, acromion and coracoid processes. The main joint of the shoulder is the shoulder joint (or glenohumeral joint), between the humerus and the glenoid process of the scapular. The <b>acromioclavicular</b> <b>joint</b> and sternoclavicular joint {{also play a role}} in shoulder movements. White hyaline cartilage on the ends of the bones (called articular cartilage) allows the bones to glide and move on each other, and the joint space is surrounded by a synovial membrane. Around the joint space are muscles - the rotator cuff, which directly surrounds and attaches to the shoulder joint - and other muscles that help provide stability and facilitate movement.|$|E
25|$|Physical {{examination}} of the shoulder to feel for injury and discover the limits of movement, location of pain, and extent of joint instability. The steps to elicit this information are inspection (looking), palpation (feeling), testing range of motion, and performing special maneuvers. Information collected on inspection are asymmetry, atrophy, ecchymosis, scars, swelling, and venous distention. Palpation can help find pain and deformities, and should specifically include the anterior glenohumeral joint, <b>acromioclavicular</b> <b>joint,</b> biceps tendon, cervical spine, coracoid process, scapula, and sternoclavicular joint. Range of motion tests external and internal rotation, abduction and adduction, passive and active weakness, and true weakness versus weakness due to pain. The Apley scratch test is the most useful: touch opposite scapular by reaching behind the head for adduction and external rotation and behind the back for abduction and internal rotation. Finally, there are more specific maneuvers that can hone in on a diagnosis, however their accuracy is limited.|$|E
2500|$|The human {{shoulder}} {{is made up}} {{of three}} bones: the clavicle (collarbone), the scapula (shoulder blade), and the humerus (upper arm bone) as well as associated muscles, ligaments and tendons. [...] The articulations between the bones of the shoulder make up the shoulder joints. The shoulder joint also known as the glenohumeral joint, is the major joint of the shoulder, but can more broadly include the <b>acromioclavicular</b> <b>joint.</b> In human anatomy, the shoulder joint comprises the part of the body where the humerus attaches to the scapula, the head sitting in the glenoid cavity. The shoulder is the group of structures in the region of the joint.|$|E
40|$|The {{clinical}} and experimental searches are relatively less on sternoclavicular and <b>acromioclavicular</b> <b>joints.</b> The data found in literature are incompatible. Usually sternoclavicular and acromioculavicular joints considered in total movements of shoulder girdle, {{because it is}} difficult to be measured separately by traditional methods. The electronic digital inclinometer (EDI 320) improved by Cybex Co is a very precise and portable device and it can be used easily. Its reality and reliability at measurements of range of motion (ROM) of limbs was proved, but it was not applied on sternoclavicular and <b>acromioclavicular</b> <b>joints.</b> Therefore we searched the practicability of the inclinometer on these joints. 40 volunteer university students (20 men and 20 women) participated in our study. Protraction-retraction and elevation-depression movements of sternoclavicular joints and scapular abduction-adduction movements of <b>acromioclavicular</b> <b>joints</b> were measured on both right and left joints. The most suitable position for subject and researcher and location of device's probe was determined for the measurement of each movement. The first results found in this preliminary study which are proposed to form a method were like this: average value for protraction + retraction is 450, for elevation + depression is 400, for scapular abduction + adduction is 550.

40|$|A {{study of}} the degree of {{accessory}} movements available in the sternoclavicular and <b>acromioclavicular</b> <b>joints</b> as a result of passive movement is presented. Using the common terms of hypomobility, normal and hypermobility and defining another set of terms — the pure, mixed and heterogenous triplets — findings based on a sample of 64 children indicate that the sternoclavicular joints, in comparison to the <b>acromioclavicular</b> <b>joints,</b> are decisively less mobile; are more uniformly constrained in their linear motions along the relevant anatomical planes; and exhibit a higher degree of left/right symmetry. The significance of these findings both from the biomechanical and clinical aspect is discussed...|$|R
2500|$|The {{amount of}} stress needed to tear a rotator cuff tendon acutely {{will depend on}} the {{underlying}} condition of the tendon prior to the stress. In the case of a healthy tendon, the stress needed will be high, such as a fall on the outstretched arm. This stress may occur coincidentally with other injuries such as a dislocation of the shoulder, or separation of the <b>acromioclavicular</b> <b>joint.</b> In the case of a tendon with pre-existing degeneration, the force may be surprisingly modest, such as a sudden lift, particularly with the arm above the horizontal position. [...] This is a common occurrence with rear seated passengers in a motor vehicle collision, regardless of speed.|$|E
2500|$|X-ray projectional {{radiography}} cannot directly reveal {{tears of}} the rotator cuff, a 'soft tissue', and consequently, normal X-rays cannot exclude a damaged cuff. However, indirect evidence of pathology {{may be seen}} in instances where {{one or more of the}} tendons have undergone degenerative calcification (calcific tendinitis). The humeral head may migrate upwards (high-riding humeral head) secondary to tears of the infraspinatus, or combined tears of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus. Prolonged contact between a high-riding humeral head and the acromion above it, may lead to X-rays findings of wear on the humeral head and acromion and secondary degenerative arthritis of the glenohumeral joint (the ball and socket joint of the shoulder), called cuff arthropathy, may follow. Incidental X-ray [...] findings of bone spurs at the adjacent <b>acromioclavicular</b> <b>joint</b> may show a bone spur growing from the outer edge of the clavicle downwards towards the rotator cuff. Spurs may also be seen on the underside of the acromion, once thought to cause direct fraying of the rotator cuff from contact friction, a concept currently regarded as controversial.|$|E
2500|$|Lawton {{was traded}} from the New York Mets to the Cleveland Indians {{during the winter}} of 2001. In the deal, the Mets sent Lawton, a players to be named later, Alex Escobar, and Jerrod Riggan to the Indians in {{exchange}} for Danny Peoples, Roberto Alomar, Mike Bacsik. The players to be named was Earl Snyder and Billy Traber, who were sent to the Indians two days later. On April 18, 2002, in a game against the Minnesota Twins, Lawton separated his right shoulder after diving for the ball in right field, but played through the injury. On May 18, Lawton hit a two-out, two-run home run {{in the bottom of the}} ninth inning to give the Indians a walk-off win against the Baltimore Orioles. On September 19, Lawton was placed on the disabled list, and was later forced to sit out the rest of the season after feeling pain in his labrum, which was torn earlier in the season. He played three rehab games in the minors that season with the Double-A Akron Aeros, getting no hits in 10 at-bats. There were rumors that Lawton may not be ready for the start of the 2003 season. On the season with the Indians, Lawton batted [...]236 with 71 runs scored 98 hits, 19 doubles, two triples, 15 home runs, 57 RBIs, and eight stolen bases in 114 games played. He played 85 games in right field, and 23 in left field. As an outfielder, he committed six errors, and made six assists and 229 putouts. He underwent arthroscopic surgery after the season to repair a tear in his labrum and fraying in the rotator cuff. Doctors also removed a cyst from his <b>acromioclavicular</b> <b>joint.</b>|$|E

[1991]). However, since the glenohumeral joint (GH) has little bony stability, its supporting passive (labral and ligamentous) and dynamic (muscular) restraints help to preserve shoulder function.|$|R

40|$|Background: This study {{focuses on}} the {{relationship}} between overuse in association with wheelchair activities of daily living and risks for osteoarthrosis in the <b>acromioclavicular</b> and sternoclavicular <b>joints.</b> The aim is to quantify the joint moments and joint reaction forces in all three joints of the shoulder complex during wheelchair-related activities of daily living. Methods: A convenience sample of 17 subjects performed two tasks (wheelchair propulsion and weight relief lifting). Three-dimensional kinematics and kinetics were measured and position and force data were used as input for a musculoskeletal model of the arm and shoulder. Output variables of the model were the moments and the joint reaction forces on the sternoclavicular, <b>acromioclavicular</b> and glenohumeral <b>joints.</b> Findings: Moments on the sternoclavicular joint were higher than on the <b>acromioclavicular</b> and glenohumeral <b>joint,</b> but the joint reaction forces on the sternoclavicular and <b>acromioclavicular</b> <b>joints</b> were only one third of those on the glenohumeral joint (peak forces around 96 N compared to 315 N for wheelchair propulsion and around 330 N compared to 1288 N for weight relief lifting). Interpretation: Based on the results found in this study, net joint moments are likely a better measure to describe the load on the <b>acromioclavicular</b> and sternoclavicular <b>joints</b> due to the passive stabilization. Prospective studies on wheelchair overuse injuries should also look at the <b>acromioclavicular</b> and sternoclavicular <b>joints</b> since the load of wheelchair tasks might be a risk factor for osteoarthrosis in these joints.

40|$|Abstract Background Cellulitis {{caused by}} Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare {{has rarely been}} described. Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare is a rare cause of septic {{arthritis}} after intra-articular injection, though the causative role of injection is difficult to ascertain in such cases. Case presentation A 57 -year-old with rheumatoid arthritis treated with prednisone and azathioprine developed bilateral painful degenerative shoulder arthritis. After corticosteroid injections into both <b>acromioclavicular</b> <b>joints,</b> he developed bilateral cellulitis centered over the injection sites. Skin biopsy showed non-caseating granulomas, and culture grew Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare. Joint aspiration also revealed Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare infection. Conclusion Although rare, skin and joint infections caused by Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare {{should be considered in}} any immunocompromised host, particularly after intra-articular injection. Stains for acid-fast bacilli may be negative in pathologic samples even in the presence of infection; cultures of tissue specimens should always be obtained. </p...|$|R
40|$|Ultrasonography (US) {{has proved}} to be useful {{diagnostic}} tool in patients with shoulder pain and/or limited range of motion. It allows careful assessment {{of a wide range of}} changes involving many different anatomic structures of the shoulder girdle, such as the rotator cuff tendons (tendonitis, tendon tears and calcific deposits), the long head of the biceps tendon (tenosynovitis, tendonitis, tears, rupture and displacement), the bursae (bursitis), the soft tissues of the gleno-humeral (synovial proliferation, <b>joint</b> effusion) and <b>acromioclavicular</b> <b>joints</b> (synovial proliferation and joint effusion). In addition, it is also a reliable tool in the evaluation of bony profiles detecting the presence of erosions and osteophytes. The use of high quality equipment and the application of a standard scanning protocol are mandatory for reliable US assessment of shoulder pathology.
