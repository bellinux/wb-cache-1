5|$|The first {{segments}} of road {{appeared in the}} location of what would become RE11 by 1940. The southern road segment began at an at-grade intersection, near the location of RE11, and traveled northward, before traveling slightly westward and terminating at a dead end. The road was graded <b>and</b> <b>drained,</b> and had a gravel surface, with a cattle guard near the middle of it. The northern segment of road traveled near the location of RE11. This road was also graded <b>and</b> <b>drained,</b> and had three cattle guards located along its course. By 1951, a gate had {{been added to the}} southern road segment, and the northern segment had several turns straightened and lengthened. On October 28, 1953, RM 2134 was designated from Millersview along a road to the northern segment of what would become RE11. On August 24, 1955, the highway was designated along the northern segment of road, to the Colorado River. The designation was made official on October 1, 1955.|$|E

5|$|All known Daspletosaurus fossils {{have been}} found in {{formations}} dating to the middle to late Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous Period, between 77 and 74 million years ago. Since the middle of the Cretaceous, North America had been divided in half by the Western Interior Seaway, with much of Montana and Alberta below the surface. However, the uplift of the Rocky Mountains in the Laramide Orogeny to the west, which began during the time of Daspletosaurus, forced the seaway to retreat eastwards and southwards. Rivers flowed down from the mountains <b>and</b> <b>drained</b> into the seaway, carrying sediment along with them that formed the Two Medicine Formation, the Judith River Group, and other sedimentary formations in the region. About 73 million years ago, the seaway began to advance westwards and northwards again, and the entire region was covered by the Bearpaw Sea, represented throughout the western United States and Canada by the massive Bearpaw Shale.|$|E
5|$|Caio Duilios next {{operation}} was a sortie against the British convoy MW 9 bounded from Alexandria to Malta in February. She departed from Taranto on 14 February {{with a pair}} of light cruisers and seven destroyers, but the force could not locate the British ships, and so returned to port. Her mere presence at sea, however, forced the British escort to scuttle the transport Rowallan Castle, previously disabled by German aircraft. On the 21st, she escorted the convoy K7 from Messina and Corfu to Taranto. By this point in 1942, the Italian fleet began to suffer a severe shortage of fuel, which curtailed its operations. The situation was so bad that Caio Duilio had to be placed in reserve <b>and</b> <b>drained</b> of fuel, {{in order to keep the}} escort craft operational. She was at Taranto when Italy surrendered to the Allies in September 1943, and on 9 September she was taken to Malta, where she was interned with the rest of the Italian fleet.|$|E
5|$|Circuses {{were the}} largest {{structure}} regularly {{built in the}} Roman world, though the Greeks had their own architectural traditions for the similarly purposed hippodrome. The Flavian Amphitheatre, {{better known as the}} Colosseum, became the regular arena for blood sports in Rome after it opened in 80 AD. The circus races continued to be held more frequently. The Circus Maximus could seat around 150,000 spectators, and the Colosseum about 50,000 with standing room for about 10,000 more. Many Roman amphitheatres, circuses and theatres built in cities outside Italy are visible as ruins today.

40|$|Vertically aligned carbon {{nanotube}} field-effect transistors (CNTFETs) {{have been developed}} using pure semiconducting {{carbon nanotube}}s. The source <b>and</b> <b>drain</b> were vertically stacked, separated by a dielectric, and the carbon nanotubes {{were placed on the}} sidewall of the stack to bridge the source <b>and</b> <b>drain.</b> Both the effective gate dielectric and gate electrode were normal to the substrate surface. The channel length is determined by the dielectric thickness between source <b>and</b> <b>drain</b> electrodes, making it easier to fabricate sub-micrometer transistors without using time-consuming electron beam lithography. The transistor area is much smaller than the planar CNTFET due to the vertical arrangement of source <b>and</b> <b>drain</b> <b>and</b> the reduced channel area. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Florida State's offense entered the game one final time and conducted a 12-play, 75-yard drive that ended with a 20-yard pass from Manuel to running back Chris Thompson for a touchdown. The score and subsequent extra point made the score 44–33, but only seven seconds remained in the game.

5|$|The Wiyot {{tribe of}} California {{say that the}} condor recreated mankind after Above Old Man wiped {{humanity}} out with a flood. However, other tribes, such as California's Mono, viewed the condor as a destroyer, not a creator.

Condor then seized Ground Squirrel after he fled, but Ground Squirrel managed to cut off Condor's head when Condor paused to take a drink of the blood. According to the Yokut tribe, the condor sometimes ate the moon, causing the lunar cycle, and his wings caused eclipses.

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1976, a {{stalemate}} existed between the Falintil and the Indonesian army. Unable to overcome heavy resistance <b>and</b> <b>drained</b> of its resources, the TNI began rearming. Indonesian navy ordered missile-firing patrol-boats from the United States, Australia, the Netherlands, South Korea, and Taiwan, as well as submarines from West Germany. In February 1977, Indonesia also received thirteen OV-10 Bronco aircraft from the Rockwell International Corporation {{with the aid of}} an official US government foreign military aid sales credit. The Bronco was ideal for the East Timor invasion, as it was specifically designed for counter-insurgency operations in difficult terrain. By the beginning of February 1977, at least six of the 13 Broncos were operating in East Timor, and helped the Indonesian military pinpoint Fretilin positions. The OV-10 Broncos dealt a heavy blow to the Falintil when the aircraft attacked their forces with conventional weapons and Soviet-supplied Napalm known as 'Opalm.' Along with the new weaponry, an additional 10,000 troops were sent in to begin new campaigns that would become known as the 'final solution'.|$|E
5|$|In the Battle of Schliengen (24 October 1796), Fürstenberg {{commanded}} the second column of the Austrian force, which included nine battalions of infantry and 30 squadrons of cavalry; with these, he overwhelmed {{the force of}} General of Division Gouvion Saint-Cyr, holding his position to prevent the French force from retreating north on the Rhine. While Maximilian Anton Karl, Count Baillet de Latour, engaged the main Austrian force at Kehl, Archduke Charles entrusted to Lieutenant Field Marshal Fürstenberg the command of the forces besieging Hüningen, which included two divisions with 20 battalions of infantry and 40 squadrons of cavalry.
