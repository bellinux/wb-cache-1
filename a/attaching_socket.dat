50|$|The most {{prevalent}} form is the ratcheting socket wrench, often improperly called a ratchet. A ratcheting socket wrench is the device within a hand tool {{in which a}} metal handle {{is attached to a}} ratcheting mechanism, which <b>attaches</b> to a <b>socket,</b> which in turn fits onto a type of bolt or nut. Pulled or pushed in one direction, the ratchet loosens or tightens the bolt or nut <b>attached</b> to the <b>socket.</b> Turned the other direction, the ratchet does not turn the socket but allows the ratchet handle to be re-positioned for another turn while staying attached to the bolt or nut. This ratcheting action allows the fastener to be rapidly tightened or loosened in small increments without disconnecting the tool from the fastener. A switch is built into the ratchet head that allows the user to apply the ratcheting action in either direction, as needed, to tighten or loosen a fastener. Other common methods of driving socket wrenches include pneumatic impact wrenches, hydraulic torque wrenches, torque multipliers and breaker bars. Some lesser known hybrid drivers include striking wrench tools with square drive, and hydraulic impact wrenches (typically powered by on site hydraulic power such as present with military tanks, and many rail car applications).|$|R
5000|$|Various {{methods are}} used to <b>attach</b> the <b>socket</b> or {{accessory}} to the anvil, such as a spring-loaded pin that snaps into a matching hole in the socket, preventing the socket being removed until an object is used to depress the pin, a hog ring which holds the socket by friction or by snapping into indents machined into the socket, and a through-hole, where a pin is inserted completely through the socket and anvil, locking the socket on. Hog rings are used on most smaller tools, with though-hole used only on larger impact wrenches, typically ¾" [...] drive or greater. Pin retainers used to be more common, but seem to be being replaced by hog rings on most tools, {{despite the lack of}} a positive lock. ¼" [...] female hex drive is becoming increasingly popular for small impact wrenches, especially cordless electric versions, allowing them to fit standard screwdriver tips rather than sockets.|$|R

50|$|The {{pivot ball}} hitch is an anti-binding {{motorcycle}} trailer hitch assembly {{composed of a}} base and a trailer ball. The base is secured to a standard ball mount on the motorcycle.

50|$|The {{aircraft}} had a {{long history}} of alterations, but as first built it had a short square-section wire-braced wood fuselage, with the engine mounted on top in front of {{the leading edge of the}} lower wing, with the pilot’s seat behind it. A pair of V struts at the front carried two wheels on an axle, and a tailwheel was mounted at the back. This was augmented by small wheels mounted on the leading edge on the lower wingtips. The wings had wooden spars at the leading and trailing edges and had an arrangement for altering the camber when on the ground by means of tensioned wires between the spars. The wings were connected by streamlined interplane struts, some wind-tunnel experiments on strut sections having been carried out at Farnborough. Lateral control was to be achieved using a pair of small ailerons mounted above the leading edge of the lower wing. The forward-mounted elevator was mounted on three sets of bamboo booms <b>attached</b> to <b>sockets</b> on the leading edge of the wings, the lower members sloping steeply upwards so that the surfaces were just below the level of the upper wing. These could be operated in conjunction to act as elevators as well as assisting in the lateral control of the aircraft. A single rectangular rudder was mounted between two booms, the upper attached to the centre of the rear spar and the lower to the rear of the fuselage. A large canvas triangle was stretched between the trailing edge of the upper wing and the end of the upper tail boom. A small fixed vertical surface was also mounted above the upper wing.|$|R
5000|$|Socket {{wrenches}} {{are most}} commonly hexagonal, or more {{commonly referred to}} as [...] "6-point" [...] in lay terms. Sockets are driven by being attached to the driving tool via a male/female square connection fitting (called the square drive). Standard sizes of square drives around the world include 1/4", 3/8", 1/2", 3/4", 1", 1-1/2", 2-1/2" [...] and 3-1/2" [...] square drive sizes (a de facto international standard with no metric equivalents) along with some lesser used drivers such as 5/8" [...] square drive, and both #4 and #5 spline drives specified in ANSI B107 specifications. This wide range of square drive sizes provides {{for a wide variety of}} socket types and sizes to suit small to very large nuts and bolts. Some square drivers have a through hole to <b>attach</b> the <b>socket</b> to the driver (using a retaining ring with o-ring and pin type, or single piece molded retaining rings), a locking pin, or friction ball. Some common hand ratchets employ a quick release button on their top for quick socket release of smaller sockets.The tool chosen to drive the socket wrench ultimately supplies the mechanical advantage needed by the user to provide the torque needed to loosen or tighten the fastener as may be required. Larger drivers are typically used with higher torque, while smaller drivers are used for convenience in smaller low torque applications. Given the limits of human strength and fatigue, torque above 600 ft-lbs of torque will generally involve some kind of power assist, instead of the user simply pushing on the handle of a wrench. Very large sockets and drivers are typically powered by hydraulics to achieve torque.|$|R
40|$|Many {{large-scale}} {{machine learning}} (ML) applications use it-erative algorithms to converge on parameter values {{that make the}} chosen model fit the input data.

5000|$|Male bit {{drivers are}} {{sometimes}} incorrectly {{referred to as}} [...] "sockets", but are in fact the opposite of a socket, in that bit drivers fit into a {{socket head cap screw}} or pipe plug, rather than fit over a male drive head on a nut or bolt as a socket does. A socket is a [...] "female" [...] recess or opening which receives another object, together as a fitting connection. A socket is not a protruding [...] "male" [...] connection. Common male bit drivers of this type include Allen hex wrenches (in both metric and fractional inch sizes), Torx (T-3 thru T-50) spline wrenches, 4-point (square), and 12-point (triple square) male bit drivers. Other specialized screw heads that are often installed or removed with screwdriver type handles and appropriate type tip have socket varieties that fit the various screw head types and a can be <b>attached</b> to a <b>socket</b> wrench.

50|$|In {{technical}} diving {{donation of}} the primary demand valve is commonly the standard procedure, and the primary {{is connected to the}} first stage by a long hose, typically around 2 m, to allow gas sharing while swimming in single file in a narrow space as might be required in a cave or wreck. In this configuration the secondary is generally held under the chin by a loose bungee loop around the neck, supplied by a shorter hose, and is intended for backup use by the diver donating gas. The backup regulator is usually carried in the diver's chest area where it can be easily seen and accessed for emergency use. It may be worn secured by a breakaway clip on the buoyancy compensator, plugged into a soft friction <b>socket</b> <b>attached</b> to the harness, secured by sliding a loop of the hose into the shoulder strap cover of a jacket style BC, or suspended under the chin on a break-away bungee loop known as a necklace. These methods also keep the secondary from dangling below the diver and being contaminated by debris or snagging on the surroundings. Some divers store it in a BC pocket, but this reduces availability in an emergency.|$|R
50|$|The Model 4 has {{the ability}} to display 640×240 or 512×192 {{high-resolution}} monochrome graphics with an optional board which <b>attaches</b> to a <b>socket</b> connector on the logic board. The Radio Shack Model 4 graphics board retailed for $249 and included a modified version of Microsoft BASIC (called BasicG) with commands for drawing basic geometric shapes and manipulating arrays in graphics RAM. The graphics screen memory was separate from the usual character screen, and the two could be displayed together or separately. A third-party company called Micro Labs based in Richardson Texas sold a compatible graphics board which was popular because it was sold for only $199 (initially). It came with a different BASIC providing for graphics commands called GBasic. Whereas the Radio Shack board had 32KB of graphics RAM, the Micro Labs board had 20KB. Since only 19,200 bytes are required to render a 640 x 240 pixel screen, the additional RAM on the Radio Shack board was available for windowing the viewable screen around a larger virtual area. The graphics RAM was accessible through four Z-80 I/O ports and was especially easy to access for uses other than graphics. For example, there was a public domain utility called Grafdisk that added the graphics memory to regular banked memory to create a larger TRSDOS ramdisk (96K on the Radio Shack board).|$|R
40|$|M. S. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2014. Includes bibliographical references. When an {{amputation}} of a {{lower limb}} occurs, forces due to walking are absorbed by the soft tissues of the residual limb. Due to the soft tissues of the limb no being accustomed to handling such high forces, {{one of the major}} issues that occurs is residual limb shrinkage. As the amount of pressure fluctuates, so does the balance between the fluids in the body. Shrinkage of the limb can lead to many issues such as damage to the limb and an uncomfortable socket fit. Currently, vacuum suspension is the leading method to compensate for limb volume changes. However, vacuum suspension has many flaws as well. There is a need for a new prosthetic suspension system with the capability to adjust and control the pressure at different points in the prosthetic. In this study, a new magnetic suspension system for lower limb prosthetics was designed and tested. This magnetic suspension system for lower-limb prosthetics uses electromagnets to control the amount of force exerted on the residual limb. When the electromagnets are turned on, they will attract the material on the liner, thus creating a secure attachment. The design incorporates an Arduino microprocessor and a motor driver to control the amount of negative pressure by the electromagnets. In this study, the physical model of the socket was prototyped and the strength of the electromagnetic suspension system was tested in an Instron testing machine. An amplified circuit was designed to control the electromagnetic attractive force based on the output of force sensors <b>attached</b> inside the <b>socket.</b> As the pressure decreased in the socket due to limb shrinkage, the electromagnets were programmed to inversely increase attractive force. The Arduino microprocessor and motor driver were used to adjust the power delivered to the electromagnets. This feedback loop was tested to ensure proper function. After reviewing all the results, it was found that an array of electromagnetics provided adequate force for attachment of the socket to the liner. The system was also capable of varying the attractive forces at different points based on the force sensor output. This research sets a completely new direction in the area of prosthetics, forever changing what we already know about prosthetics...|$|R
5000|$|Many {{applications}} use {{air driven}} or {{electric impact wrench}} or impact driver to deliver the amount of shock and torque required to tighten or loosen the different bolts or nuts in use. Inside an impact wrench there is a rotating hammer, usually driven by electricity or air pressure, {{that is used to}} incrementally rotate the output shaft. The impact wrench is designed to deliver high torque output with minimal exertion by the user, by storing energy in a rotating mass, then delivering it suddenly to the output shaft via a hammering action. While typical impact wrenches deliver between 500 and 1500 ft-lbs of torque, some larger impact wrenches such as the Ingersoll Rand 599A1 can deliver near 80,000 ft-lb (10850 Nm) of torque which is enough to tighten hex nuts 7" [...] across flats. Even if the <b>socket</b> <b>attached</b> to the impact wrench does not turn, it is still subjected to successive shock blows by the impact wrench's internal hammer(s). These successive blows are often enough to loosen or tighten a tight or corroded nut or bolt or in some cases break or strip the fastener. Impact wrenches are hard on the sockets since the sockets in use also get hammered. Regular chrome plated [...] "hand sockets" [...] like those commonly included with hand ratchet wrench tool sets are not suitable for this kind of high load impact application. Hand sockets, when used with an impact wrench, can break or shatter explosively if they are used with an impact wrench. Impact sockets are specifically designed and manufactured for impact gun use, and are nearly always made from a thicker, tougher and more ductile alloy steel that is then heat treated for extra durability. Most impact sockets made for [...] "standard" [...] hexagonal fasteners have a six-point design. For more flexibility many impact sockets are made with swivel type socket—socket wrench attachment geometry. These impact sockets are rarely, if ever, chrome-plated, as chrome will chip off under impact use, and the process of chrome plating hardened steel causes some hydrogen embrittlement which can cause parts to crack. Instead, impact sockets are most commonly finished with a black oxide surface or other conversion treatment to provide some corrosion and rust protection and improved appearance even after hard impact wrench use. Although ordinary hand sockets should never be used with impact wrenches, impact sockets can be used with hand socket wrenches and other hand drivers.|$|R
