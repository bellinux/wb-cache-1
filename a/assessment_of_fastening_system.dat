Clearly, there is the need to maintain periodically the track substructures by means of ballast packing/tamping. Inappropriate conducts result in the nonlinear distributions of support stiffness. This study firstly demonstrates the effects of improper ballast packing/tamping on the free vibration behaviors of in situ railway concrete sleepers. The two-dimensional finite element modeling of an in situ concrete sleeper was employed in the parametric studies. This model takes into account the coupled flexural-and-shear deformations of concrete sleepers, elastic displacements <b>of</b> <b>fastening</b> <b>system,</b> and nonlinear dynamic interaction between the sleeper and ballast support.

40|$|The {{prediction}} of vibration impact remains {{as a complex}} challenge for designers of new railway infrastructures. Due to the large quantity of parameters involved in the generation, transmission and reception of the vibration waves, {{it would be necessary}} to develop a complete study for each potential receiver, which would include: source, soil and building characterization, infrastructure vibration behaviour modelling and, finally, countermeasures influence prediction. This process can turn out to be very costly in terms of both time and money. Therefore, it is usually done only for areas very likely to suffer high vibration levels or for high sensitive buildings (hospital, educational). The CATdBTren project, which has been awarded with R&D funding from the Catalonia Government, is aimed to develop a new prediction tool for evaluating the vibration impact from new railway infrastructures as well as to develop new types <b>of</b> <b>fastening</b> <b>systems</b> having high vibration isolation properties. That tool is intended to be user-friendly and to produce results with average accuracy, so it still will be required detailed studies of problematic areas. In this sense, the software will model the contact forces caused by high-speed, conventional and underground rolling stock. Moreover, it will model the infrastructure’s vibration transmission behaviour, ground vibration propagation, terrain-foundation coupling and building vibration mechanism. The CATdBTren prediction tool will be also capable of estimating the influence of the rolling stock, rail and wheel roughness, <b>fastening</b> <b>system,</b> substructure, soil vibration propagation properties and building characteristics, all in the final vibration impact.

30|$|Walker et al. [13] {{conducted}} a noise comparison study of two cases, {{the first of}} which was a concrete bridge carrying light rail vehicles. The measured noise level was used as the target for a steel–concrete composite bridge to be built later. Finite element analysis used to predict the noise level of the steel–concrete composite bridge determined that low-frequency noise was the dominant component of the bridge-borne noise. To achieve a noise level {{similar to that of the}} concrete bridge, an elastic <b>fastening</b> <b>system</b> was used on the steel-concrete composite bridge. In the second case, they conducted noise and vibration tests on a bridge with elastic fastenings installed; noise was measured before and after the installation of noise barriers. The results showed that both the elastic <b>fastening</b> <b>system</b> and the noise barriers could effectively reduce noise levels; however, the noise reduction effect <b>of</b> the elastic <b>fastening</b> <b>system</b> was slightly less effective, because the main noise source was wheel–rail interactions.|$|R
40|$|Pandrol Rail Fastenings Limited are a {{designer}} and manufacturer of railway rail-fastening systems. As an organisation {{they have the}} capability to reduce the noise impact of bridges using resilient track components. They also have a commercial interest in providing such technology. Knowledge of the processes behind bridge noise is important to Pandrol in two ways; to aid the engineers within the organisation in the design <b>of</b> <b>fastening</b> <b>systems</b> and to demonstrate a state-of-the-art understanding of the problem of railway bridge noise to customers, as this will aid in the sale of Pandrol products. The fitting of new rail components to an existing track form, or failure to meet noise regulations with a new track form, can be costly. It is important to be able to predict accurately the effectiveness of noise reduction techniques. Currently, Pandrol’s knowledge of the problem consists almost entirely of experience gained and data gathered while working on existing bridge projects. To expand their knowledge base, Pandrol perform noise and vibration measurements on railway bridges and viaducts and then use the measured data to predict the performance of their systems on other bridges. This completely empirical approach to predicting bridge noise is both costly and situation specific results cannot be provided before the installation <b>of</b> the <b>fastening</b> <b>system.</b> ii Another approach to predicting bridge noise is through the application of analytical models. Limited analytical modelling in the context of bridge noise is currently conducted within the organisation. For these reasons, Pandrol are sponsoring research into bridge noise in the form of this EngD project. Here an existing rapid calculation approach is identified that relies less on the exact geometry of the bridge and more on its general characteristics. In this approach an analytical model of the track is coupled to a statistical energy analysis (SEA) model of the bridge. This approach forms a suitable basis from which to develop a better model here by concentrating on its weaknesses. A mid-frequency calculation for the power input to the bridge via a resilient track system has been developed by modelling the track-bridge system as two finite Timoshenko beams continuously connected by a resilient layer. This has resulted in a power input calculation which includes the important effects of coupling between the rail and bridge and the resonance effects of the finite length of a bridge. In addition, a detailed study of the frequency characteristics of deep I-section beams has been performed using Finite Element, Boundary Element and Dynamic stiffness models. It is shown that, at high frequencies, the behaviour of the beam is characterised by in-plane motion of the beam web and bending motion in the flange. This knowledge has resulted in an improved calculation for the mobility of a bridge at high frequencies. The above improvements are included in an improved model for use by Pandrol in their general activities. Data from real bridges is compared to predictions from the improved model in order to validate different aspects of the model. The model is then used to study the effect on noise of varying many bridge design parameters. It is shown that the parameter that has most influence on the noise performance of a bridge is the dynamic stiffness of the resilient rail <b>fastening</b> <b>system.</b> Additionally it is demonstrated that for a given bridge and noise receiver location, an optimum fastener stiffness exists where the noise radiated by the bridge and track is at a minimum.

Numerical methods were used in order to simulate the dynamic behaviour of the train-track interaction. Multibody system (MBS) modelling techniques were combined with techniques based on the finite element method (FEM).

The simulation model was validated by comparing simulated results to experimental data obtained in field testing. During the simulations various safety indices, characteristic of derailment risk, were analysed. The simulations realised at the maximum running velocity of 110 km/h showed a similar behaviour for several track types. When reducing the running speed, the safety indices worsened for both cases. Although the worst behaviour was observed for the track with a greater elasticity, in none of the simulations did a derailment occur when running over the broken rail...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the efficiency of Dynamic Vibration Absorbers (DVAs) as a vibration abatement solution for railway-induced vibrations in the framework of a double-deck circular railway tunnel infrastructure. Specifically, it is studied the efficiency of an optimized set of DVAs placed on the interior floor which has the objective of reducing the vibration energy flow radiated by the tunnel infrastructure when a moving harmonic point load is circulating along the track which is located at the upper floor of the double-deck tunnel. A previously developed analytical model of the superstructure-tunnel ground system is employed to calculate the energy flow due to a moving harmonic point load over the track. The model describes the dynamics of the interior floor using the thin plate theory and considers the Pipe-in-Pipe (PiP) model to describe the coupled tunnel-soil system. The track model consists of two Euler-Bernoulli beams, as a model of the rails, coupled with the interior floor with continuous springs, which model the sets <b>of</b> direct <b>fastening</b> <b>systems.</b> In the basis of this model, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to obtain the optimal parameters of the DVAs set for the minimization of the vibration energy flow radiated by the tunnel. The parameters of the DVAs set to be optimized are the mass, stiffness, damping ratio and position of the DVAs. The results indicate that the DVAs would be and effective solution for the abatement of the vibration energy flow induced by this kind of infrastructure. Postprint (published version...|$|R
