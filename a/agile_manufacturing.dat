40|$|<b>Agile</b> {{intelligent}} <b>manufacturing</b> {{is one of}} the new manufacturing paradigms that {{adapt to}} the fierce globalizing market competition and meet the survival needs of the enterprises, in which the management and control of the production system have surpassed the scope of individual enterprise and embodied some new features including complexity, dynamicity, distributivity, and compatibility. The <b>agile</b> intelligent <b>manufacturing</b> paradigm calls for a production scheduling system that can support the cooperation among various production sectors, the distribution of various resources to achieve rational organization, scheduling and management of production activities. This paper uses multi-agents technology to build an agile intelligent manufacturing-oriented production scheduling system. Using the hybrid modeling method, the resources and functions of production system are encapsulated, and the agent-based production system model is established. A production scheduling-oriented multi-agents architecture is constructed and a multi-agents reference model is given in this paper. supported by Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. N 090403005...|$|R

5000|$|This {{concept is}} closely related to lean manufacturing, in which the goal is to reduce waste as much as possible. In lean manufacturing, the company aims to cut all costs which are not {{directly}} related to the production of a product for the consumer. <b>Agile</b> <b>manufacturing</b> can include this concept, but it also adds an additional dimension, the idea that customer demands need to be met rapidly and effectively. In situations where companies integrate both approaches, they are sometimes said to be using [...] "agile and lean manufacturing".Companies which utilize an <b>agile</b> <b>manufacturing</b> approach tend to have very strong networks with suppliers and related companies, along with numerous cooperative teams which work within the company to deliver products effectively. They can retool facilities quickly, negotiate new agreements with suppliers and other partners in response to changing market forces, and take other steps to meet customer demands. This means that the company can increase production on products with a high consumer demand, as well as redesign products to respond to issues which have emerged on the open market.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{we address}} a {{fluctuating}} low-volume and high-mix manufacturing system that handles a large variety of products. The incoming products {{have their own}} task information imposed by customer demands. In other words, they are not given in advance. Consequently, the system-operating conditions vary with {{the changes in the}} given tasks over time. Because of such unpredictable fluctuations, the system might have localized heavy workloads. Therefore, workload balancing is a challenge. For this issue, we focus on multi-robots in a manufacturing system. We first describe behavioral and cooperation mechanisms among robots. Thus, by sharing their information, robots are able to respond to such dynamically changing situations reactively. We then develop a flexible and <b>agile</b> multi-robot <b>manufacturing</b> system with Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) and product-processing robots.

The aim of the paper is to present the design specification for an enterprise application that integrates the ERP concept in three-tier architecture, containing modularized, distributed subsystems in configurable and maintainable software. Starting from the customer order, to planned order dispatch, the ERP main components and the information flow within the system is presented. Then, the software architecture is discussed, where the ERP components are implemented using Enterprise Java Beans (EJB), deployed in a J 2 EE application server, for performing transactions with business environment and the database.

40|$|Implementation of an <b>agile,</b> {{intelligent}} <b>manufacturing</b> system requires extensive {{attention to}} scheduling algorithms and policy. A scheduling process, in turn, both affects and depends upon {{many areas of}} a manufacturing organization, from the sales department, through the shop floor, to the shipping department. Effective scheduling policy begins with fixing performance criteria. Next, the analyst or industrial engineer must match appropriate algorithms, techniques, and scheduling rules to those performance criteria; the appropriateness of these choices is highly sensitive to the criteria. In this paper, we examine commonly used performance metrics such as total weighted completion time, maximum lateness, and total tardiness to match them with appropriate scheduling policy. Then, we present a case study which required the formulation of unique scheduling algorithms developed for special situations. We conclude by summarizing our findings and indicating promising directions for further development and practical application of scheduling algorithms...|$|R

The methods for achieving a technical effect are described by control algorithms, which might or might not utilize formal methods in their design. Hybrid systems important to mechatronics include production systems, synergy drives,planetary exploration rovers, automotive subsystems such as anti-lock braking systems and spin-assist, and everyday equipment such as autofocus cameras, video, hard disks, and CD players.|$|E

In Discrete Manufacturing, Art-to-Part validations have been performed often, but when considering highly volatile engineering designs, and multiple manufacturing operations with multiple tooling options, the decisions tables become longer and the vector matrices more complex. BYJC builds CNC machine tools and Flexible Manufacturing Systems (FMS) to customer specifications. Few are duplicates. The Generative CAPP System {{is based on the}} unique capabilities and capacities needed to produce those specific products at BYJC. Unlike a Variant Process Planning system that modifies existing plans, each process plan could be defined automatically, independent of past routings. As improvements are made to production efficiencies, the improvements are automatically incorporated into the current production mix. This generative system is a key component of the CAPP system for the <b>Agile</b> <b>Manufacturing</b> environment.|$|E

In this paper we demonstrate how Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) driven approaches offer the flexibility to adapt manufacturing plants based on a dynamic production plan in close cooperation with a backend system. The methods discussed were deployed on a prototype test rig and integrated with SAP ERP. The results introduce dynamic behaviour of the production plan by adapting to {{the changing nature of}} the shop floor, and at the same time, providing the real time status of the machines to the enterprise services which optimize further the production plan dynamically. 1...|$|R

50|$|Agile Construction {{is a way}} {{of doing}} {{business}} adapted to construction jobsites and overall project delivery, born from <b>agile</b> <b>manufacturing</b> and project management, mostly used in manufacturing production, automotive and software developing teams. It is the application of the Toyota Production System to construction, with two parallel paths: measuring (ASTM E2691) and improving productivity, and segregating and externalizing work through prefabrication and supply chain management. Like the Toyota Production System, Agile construction is a system that relies on input from the source of the work information, both up front for planning the project, as well as throughout the life of a project for real-time feedback. The real-time input produces real-time measurements of productivity. It is an iterative and incremental method of managing the design and build activities. This means that each time the process is repeated some changes are made to make the process better. Changes for the better are kept and for the worse are discarded.|$|E
