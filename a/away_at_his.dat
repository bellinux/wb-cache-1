5|$|During the half-time {{break of}} Luton's 3–0 defeat <b>away</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> former club York on 24 September 2011, Lawless broke his hand after {{punching}} a wall out of frustration, resulting in him being ruled out for around {{a month and}} being handed a fine by his club. He played in Luton's 2012 Conference Premier play-off Final 2–1 defeat at Wembley, coincidentally against York, on 20 May 2012. Lawless signed a one-year contract extension in July 2012, despite poor performances during the 2011–12 season making him a target for fans.|$|E
25|$|When Pompey himself {{arrived in}} Damascus in 63 BC, both Hyrcanus and Aristobulus visited him there. Pompey put off resolving the issue, informing the {{opposing}} parties he would resolve it once {{he arrived in}} Judea in person. Aristobulus did not wait for Pompey's decision and left Damascus to shut himself <b>away</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> fortress of Alexandrium. This angered Pompey who marched his forces into Judea, {{at the sight of}} which Aristobulus yielded. When Aulus Gabinius led a force to take Jerusalem, however, Aristobulus' supporters refused to let the Roman troops in. Incensed, Pompey had Aristobulus arrested and prepared to besiege the city.|$|E
25|$|Head's final {{study was}} one of degeneration, a project {{made all the more}} poignant and {{fascinating}} by the fact it was, in part, his own degeneration that he was to be studying. As Parkinson's Disease worked <b>away</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> own faculties of speech he combined his knowledge of neurology with his intensive war studies on defects of speech produced by brain injuries to produce two large volumes under the title Aphasia and Kindred Disorders of Speech (1926). These volumes were devoted not only to the clinical or symptomatic aspects of disturbances of speech, but were also an attempt to investigate the psychical processes concerned therein, and the physiological integrations necessary for the comprehension and expression of ideas as language.|$|E

25|$|In 1875, he {{was named}} Fellow of Corpus Christi College, Oxford and in 1876 assumed the new Chair of Chinese Language and Literature at Oxford, where he {{attracted}} few students to his lectures but worked hard for some 20 years in his study at 3 Keble Terrace, on his translations of the Chinese classics. According to an anonymous contemporary obituary in the Pall Mall Gazette, Legge was in his study every morning at three o'clock, winter and summer, having retired to bed at ten. When he {{got up in the}} morning {{the first thing he did}} was to make himself a cup of tea over a spirit-lamp. Then he worked <b>away</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> translations while all the household slept.|$|E
500|$|Capelle was {{promoted}} to konteradmiral (rear admiral) in 1906, and to vizeadmiral (vice admiral) three years later. In 1912, Capelle was elevated to the nobility, which allowed him to add [...] "von" [...] to his name. He rose {{to the rank of}} admiral in 1913, and by 1914, he was Tirpitz's deputy. During the July Crisis that instigated World War I, Capelle was temporarily the acting state secretary, as Tirpitz was <b>away</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> summer home. In this capacity, he endorsed the [...] "blank check" [...] Kaiser Wilhelm II had extended to Austria-Hungary {{in the aftermath of the}} assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand by Serbian terrorists the previous month. With regard to the deepening crisis, Capelle stated that while [...] "many swords will be rattled and much poisonous ink spilled, Europe will not tear itself to pieces over Serbia.|$|E
500|$|Hugill's {{service as}} Attorney General was brief and eventful. [...] Three days after their swearing-in, he and Aberhart {{embarked}} for Ottawa {{to meet with}} Bennett, now prime minister, and seek a federal loan to prevent Alberta from defaulting on its bond and payroll obligations. [...] Despite needing C$18 million, they secured only $2.25 million from Bennett. [...] They then set out for Detroit to meet with Henry Ford—who had financed many of his projects without involving banks, Social Credit's sworn enemies—but, on their arrival, discovered that he was <b>away</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> summer home. [...] Returning home still in need of funding, Aberhart authorized Hugill to negotiate for the services of Robert J. Magor, a Montreal financier who had successfully assisted the government of Newfoundland in emerging from dire financial straits. [...] Magor's acceptance of a $600 per month appointment raised the ire of Social Crediters loyal to C. H. Douglas, the originator of social credit, and of Douglas himself, who saw Magor {{as a tool of}} eastern financial interests and Hugill as their man inside the government.|$|E

2500|$|Ellsworth excelled as a telegrapher. Not {{only could}} he read {{extremely}} fast code messages, {{but he also}} could imitate the sending style of other telegraphers (each of whom was slightly different), and he quickly mastered the [...] "fist" [...] of the Union Army's telegraphers in Kentucky and Tennessee. He gained his nickname [...] "Lightning" [...] during Morgan's first Kentucky Raid, when {{he sat on a}} railroad cross tie in knee deep water near Horse Cave, Kentucky, calmly tapping <b>away</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> telegraph key during a thunderstorm.|$|E
2500|$|Adams gave three {{conflicting}} {{explanations for}} {{how he came}} to have the note books in 1950: they were given to him by Morrell's son when he found them among her effects and filed <b>away</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> surgery; they were delivered anonymously to his door after she died; they were found in the air raid shelter {{at the back of his}} garden. His solicitor, meanwhile, claimed later that they were found by the defence team in Adams's surgery shortly before trial. This differs from the police records: in the list of exhibits for the Committal Hearing given to the DPP's office, the notes are mentioned. Cullen suggests that Attorney General therefore must have known they existed. and according to her, this shows [...] "that there was a will at the highest of levels to undermine the case against Dr Adams".|$|E

[...] Levine was ranked 133rd going into the tournament. [...] The Guardian {{described}} Levine as [...] "a feisty little terrier who kept harrying <b>away</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> towering opponent", and The New York Times noted that [...] "If you stand them side by side" [...] Levine and Safin [...] "look a little like David and Goliath. [...] Levine ... is seven inches (178 mm) [...] shorter and 45 pounds lighter than Safin, but when it counted ... the American was faster and stronger." [...] When Levine clinched the win he looked up and pointed into the sky in acknowledgement of his grandmother Lillian Kimmel, who had died three years prior. Safin said that he had known before the match that Levine was a [...] "talented lefty, tough player, fast ... gonna go for it. [...] He's a tough one." ...|$|E
