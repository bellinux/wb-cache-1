5000|$|In {{order to}} recoup {{some of the}} {{investment}} made in Hell's Angels (1930), Howard Hughes decided to recycle some of the sequences and unused footage {{for a pair of}} comedies set in the <b>air,</b> <b>Cock</b> of the Air (1932) and the Sky Devils. [...] "The picture contained parts of the dogfight and ammunition bombing sequences ..." [...] The remaining aircraft from the earlier films, a total of 14 World War I-era and later aircraft, were assembled at the Metropolitan Airport in Van Nuys, California.|$|E
5000|$|The {{mechanism}} of a live, armed torpedo was being painted by a sailor, who first lifted the safety catch to paint underneath it, and then lifted the firing handle to paint under that. The torpedo fired, naturally, and ran wild on deck," [...] he said. [...] "It {{slammed into the}} deck house, bounced off and kept changing around. Everybody, including me, was scared. The decks cleared pretty rapidly. Since {{we thought we were}} all going up any second, Petty Officer Ridge and myself decided to try and tame the torpedo. We got astride it. It was as slippery as a greased pig and we thought its propeller might cut our feet off. We rode and guided it over the rail and stuck one leg over the rail to hold it steady. The propeller was making a tremendous racket on the iron deck. We finally managed to release the <b>air</b> <b>cock</b> (the torpedo was driven by compressed air). We still had a live torpedo. When we got to port (in the United Kingdom) we hoisted it on the wall and left it there. I reported to headquarters, but I don't know what became of the torpedo. (The warhead was eventually placed in a North Sea naval mine field.) ...|$|E
40|$|Roots blowers {{are used}} to meet {{aeration}} requirements at the Tigbauan Research Station (TRS) of the SEAFDEC Aquaculture Department in Iloilo. Air is delivered through a system of PVC pipes and plastic tubing attached to <b>air</b> <b>cocks.</b> Water depth aerated ranges from 0. 15 m to 2. 1 m. Diffuser aerators and air lift circulators are commonly used. Improvements made since the system {{was set up in}} 1974 include burying of PVC lines to prevent rapid deterioration from direct exposure to sunlight and adoption of a closed loop pipe system to achieve even pressure distribution. The aeration system is working well at present, but some improvements and modifications are being worked out. Studies and revisions proposed to further improve the aeration system are: determining rates of oxygen transfer occurring in culture tanks, segregating small tanks from big ones, installation of suitable air filters to eliminate contaminants, and exercise of vigilance in spotting leaks and defective outlets...|$|R
500|$|It is {{considered}} to have [...] "one of the most shocking twists on Black Mirror", as Jenelle Riley of Variety puts it, some time before the third series started. Writing before the third series, Margaret Lyons of The New York Times said it is [...] "the most outright disturbing" [...] episode of Black Mirror. Right after it <b>aired,</b> <b>Cocks</b> deemed it [...] "the single darkest episode of Black Mirror so far" [...] and considered its twist to be [...] "nothing short of genius". Sims stated that it [...] "is, by a significant margin, the most disturbing episode Black Mirror has produced". Although he praised the twist as [...] "a smart one, brilliantly concealed and smartly revealed," [...] he criticized it because [...] "once the point is made, it is made over and over again." [...] Lambie praised its [...] "fearsome pace" [...] and highlighted [...] "its subtle approach", with sparse dialogue, that gives [...] "the events and performances greater impact". He concluded: [...] "its horror-infused drama leaves us unsure whom we can trust or what will happen next, and its last act is truly gut-wrenching". Monahan wrote that the twist was unpredictable and the episode [...] "was an exciting and efficient piece of narrative rug-pulling".|$|R
60|$|And on {{the walk}} there was a most ludicrous shadow in the moonlight, a grotesque, dancing figure, with one long ear, and a hand held up in warning. It was of course {{the shadow of the}} Midas statue, which the boys had never {{permitted}} to be restored to its pristine state. One ear had however crumbled away, but in the shadow this gave the figure the <b>air</b> of <b>cocking</b> the other, in the most indescribably comical manner, and the whole four stood gazing and laughing at it. There was a certain threatening attitude about its hand, which, Jock said, looked as if the ghost of old Barnes had come to threaten them for the wasteful expenditure of his hoards. Or, as Babie said, it was more like the ghastly notion of Bertram Risingham in Rokeby, of some phantom of a murdered slave protecting those hoards.|$|R
6000|$|Well, then. The {{victories}} which I wish {{especially to}} commemorate in this paper, are the six great, complete, prodigious, and undeniable victories, {{achieved by the}} corps which {{the editor of the}} Cornhill Magazine has the honor to command. When I seemed to speak disparagingly but now of generals, it was that chief I had in my I (if you will permit me the expression). I wished him not to be elated by too much prosperity; I warned him against assuming heroic imperatorial <b>airs,</b> and <b>cocking</b> his laurels too jauntily over his ear. I was his conscience, and stood on the splash-board of his triumph-car, whispering, [...] "Hominem memento te." [...] As we rolled along the way, and passed the weathercocks on the temples, I saluted the symbol of the goddess Fortune with a reverent awe. [...] "We have done our little endeavor," [...] I said, bowing my head, [...] "and mortals can do no more. But we might have fought bravely and not won. We might have cast the coin, calling, 'Head,' and lo! Tail might have come uppermost." [...] O thou Ruler of Victories!--thou Awarder of Fame!--thou Giver of Crowns (and shillings)--if thou hast smiled upon us, shall we not be thankful? There is a Saturnine philosopher, standing at the door of his book-shop, who, I fancy, has a pooh-pooh expression as the triumph passes. (I can't see quite clearly for the laurels, which have fallen down over my nose.) One hand is reining in the two white elephants that draw the car; I raise the other hand up to--to the laurels, and pass on, waving him a graceful recognition. Up the Hill of Ludgate--around the Pauline Square--by the side of Chepe--until it reaches our own Hill of Corn--the procession passes. The Imperator is bowing to the people; the captains of the legions are riding round the car, their gallant minds struck by the thought, [...] "Have we not fought as well as yonder fellow, swaggering in the chariot, and are we not as good as he?" [...] Granted, with all my heart, my dear lads. When your consulship arrives, may you be as fortunate. When these hands, now growing old, shall lay down sword and truncheon, may you mount the car, and ride to the temple of Jupiter. Be yours the laurel then. Neque me myrtus dedecet, looking cosily down from the arbor where I sit under the arched vine.|$|R
