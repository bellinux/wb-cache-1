25|$|In some countries, {{a popular}} form, {{parboiled}} rice (also known as converted rice) {{is subjected to}} <b>a</b> <b>steaming</b> or parboiling process while still a brown rice grain. The parboil process causes a gelatinisation of the starch in the grains. The grains become less brittle, {{and the color of}} the milled grain changes from white to yellow. The rice is then dried, and can then be milled as usual or used as brown rice. Milled parboiled rice is nutritionally superior to standard milled rice, because the process causes nutrients from the outer husk (especially thiamine) to move into the endosperm, so that less is subsequently lost when the husk is polished off during milling. Parboiled rice has an additional benefit in that it does not stick to the pan during cooking, as happens when cooking regular white rice. This type of rice is eaten in parts of India and countries of West Africa are also accustomed to consuming parboiled rice.|$|E
500|$|As {{was common}} at the time, Mao began embarking on farming {{activities}} aged five or six, being instructed {{to watch over}} the cattle and tend to the ducks. Mao's habits were heavily influenced by his peasant background; biographer Stuart Schram suggested that this {{took the form of}} a [...] "lack of social graces and of a concern either for comfort or appearances." [...] In later life, Mao would never become accustomed to the use of a toothbrush, instead retaining the habit of washing his mouth out with tea. Similarly, he continued to prefer cleaning himself with <b>a</b> <b>steaming</b> towel than with soap and water, again reflecting his peasant upbringing. Further, it was from traditional Hunanese cuisine that he developed his lifelong love of spicy food.|$|E

Moore's opposition to the film adaptation crystallized after the 2003 film version of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen was released, and he intends to give any resulting royalties from Watchmen to the comic's artist, Dave Gibbons. In Moore’s opinion, Hayter’s script was the closest anyone could get to the original comic, but added {{that he would not be}} going to see the film when completed. Moore said, [...] "My book is a comic book. Not a movie, not a novel. A comic book. It's been made in a certain way, and designed to be read a certain way: in an armchair, nice and cozy next to a fire, with <b>a</b> <b>steaming</b> cup of coffee." ...|$|E

500|$|She {{was armed}} with a QF 12-pounder gun located in the forward gun position; five QF 6-pounder guns, four of which were {{arranged}} along her sides and one located centrally towards her stern as a rear gun; {{and a pair of}} [...] torpedo tubes on a horizontally rotating mount located on deck towards the stern, ahead of the rear gun. Admiralty specifications in force {{at the time of her}} construction required that she should be able to steam at 30knots, and from this she was one of a group of torpedo boat destroyers known informally as [...] "30-knotters". Spitefuls propulsion was through two propellers, each driven by one of two triple expansion steam engines that were powered by four coal-fired Reed water tube boilers operated at 250pounds per square inch (1,724kilopascals). In ships of her type the boilers were installed in a line fore-and-aft and in pairs, so that in each pair the furnace doors faced each other: thus one group of stokers could tend two boilers simultaneously, and only two boiler rooms, also known as stokeholds, were required. In sea trials it was found that, when run at 29.9knots, she consumed [...] of coal per indicated horsepower(IHP) per hour, which was considered low, and a speed of 30.371knots was [...] "easily maintained". At 13.05knots it was found that her capacity of about 116tons (118tonnes) of coal, consumed at a rate of [...] per IHP per hour, gave her <b>a</b> <b>steaming</b> range of about 4,000nautical miles.|$|E
