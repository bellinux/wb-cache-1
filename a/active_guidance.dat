5|$|As {{the debate}} over Zeus raged, the Nike team was making rapid {{progress}} developing the actual system. Test firings of the original A models of the missile began in 1959 at White Sands Missile Range. The first attempt on 26 August 1959 was of a live booster stage and dummy sustainer, but the booster broke up shortly before booster/sustainer separation. A similar test on 14 October was a success, followed by the first two-stage attempt on 16 December. The first complete test of both stages with <b>active</b> <b>guidance</b> and thrust vectoring was successfully carried out on 3 February 1960. Data collected from these tests led to changes to the design to improve speed during the ascent. The first test of the Zeus B took place in May 1961. A number of Zeus missiles broke up during early test flights due to excessive heating of the control surfaces, and numerous changes were worked into the system to address this.|$|E

40|$|PLEASE SEE PUBLISHED VERSION I {{argue that}} {{intending}} and acting {{belong to the}} same genus: intending is a kind of doing continuous in structure with intentional acting. Future-directed intending is not a truly separate phenomenon from either the intending in action or the acting itself. Ultimately, all intentions are in action, or better still, in extended courses of action. I show how the intuitive distinction between intending and acting is based on modeling the two phenomena on the extreme and limiting cases of an otherwise continuous spectrum {{of the ways in which}} agents exercise rational <b>active</b> intelligent <b>guidance</b> in the pursuit of goals. I argue that diachronic intentional agency is better understood in terms of continuity and unity of courses of <b>active</b> and intelligent <b>guidance,</b> and that the distinction between intending to do something and doing it is only a derivative and context-dependent segmentation of these continuous courses of rational <b>active</b> intelligent <b>guidance...</b>|$|R

50|$|This is the {{slant range}} between the launch {{aircraft}} and target {{at the time}} that the missile begins <b>active</b> <b>guidance</b> or acquires the target with the missile's active seeker. The greater the A-Pole means less time and possibly greater distance that the launch aircraft needs to support the missile guidance until missile seeker acquisition.|$|E
50|$|The system utilises radio semi <b>active</b> <b>guidance</b> {{throughout}} the missile's flight, {{which is far}} more accurate at long range than the command guidance method used by the earlier S-75 Dvina and other missiles. The existence of an optional terminal passive radar homing mode for use against AEW aircraft remains unconfirmed. Peak missile speed is around Mach 8 and the single-shot kill probability is quoted as 0.85, presumably against a high altitude bomber-type target.|$|E

50|$|The frigates {{are armed}} with four {{missiles}}, ship-to-ship P-21 or P-22 (NATO code SS-N-2 Styx). The {{weight of the}} missiles is 2607 kg, warhead weighing 480 kg, with a range from 8 to 80 km altitude flying at 25 or 50 meters, at a speed of Mach 0.9. They have infra-red self-guidance systems (P-22) or <b>active</b> radar <b>guidance</b> (P-21).|$|R
50|$|The maneuverable {{reentry vehicle}} (abbreviated MARV or MaRV) {{is a type}} of {{ballistic}} missile whose warhead is capable of autonomous tracking ground targets. It often requires some terminal <b>active</b> homing <b>guidance</b> (like Pershing II active radar homing) to make sure the missile does not miss the target, because of the frequent trajectory shifts. Refer to atmospheric reentry.|$|R
50|$|Some {{variants}} of the Vympel R-27 use semi-active radar homing (SARH) {{for the initial}} guidance and then passive infra-red guidance for the final stage. This type of missile requires <b>active</b> <b>guidance</b> for a longer part of the flight than fire-and-forget missiles but will still guide to the target even if radar lock is broken in the crucial final seconds of the engagement and may be harder to spoof with chaff due to the dual-type guidance.|$|E
5000|$|The Mark 35 torpedo was {{the first}} of the United States Navy deep-diving anti-submarine torpedoes {{designed}} for surface launch. [...] This electrically propelled 21-inch (53-cm) torpedo was 162 inches (4.11 m) long, weighed 1770 lb (803 kg), and carried a 270 lb (122.5 kg) Torpex high explosive warhead. [...] This torpedo used one of the earliest <b>active</b> <b>guidance</b> systems and was introduced in 1949, but was classified as obsolete in the 1960s.|$|E
5000|$|In {{military}} parlance, {{a rocket}} differs from a missile primarily by lacking an <b>active</b> <b>guidance</b> system; early missiles {{were known as}} [...] "guided rockets" [...] or [...] "guided missiles". Some rockets were developed as unguided systems and later upgraded to guided versions, like the GMLRS, and these generally retain the term [...] "rocket" [...] instead of becoming missiles. Rockets or missiles that travel underwater, like the VA-111 Shkval, are known as torpedoes {{no matter what their}} propulsion system is.|$|E
50|$|The G&C portion {{contained}} two {{guidance system}}s. The primary guidance system was a Goodyear Aerospace <b>active</b> radar <b>guidance</b> system. Using radar {{maps of the}} target area, the Pershing II had an accuracy of 30 m circular error probable. The backup system was a Singer-Kearfott inertial navigation system that could guide the missile on-target in a purely ballistic mode as a back-up. The G&C also contained the Pershing Airborne Computer (PAC), the digital correlator unit (DCU) and actuators to drive the air fins.|$|R
50|$|In {{the main}} strike role, an eight-cell 3S14E {{vertical}} missile launcher is fitted, which accommodates the 3M-54E Klub-N anti-ship missile {{developed by the}} Novator Design Bureau. The Agat Research and Production Enterprise has supplied the 3R14N-11356 shipborne fire-control system associated with the Klub-N. The 3M-54E Klub is an 8.22 m long missile using <b>active</b> radar <b>guidance</b> {{with a range of}} 220 km. It is a three-stage missile in which the terminal stage reaches supersonic velocity (Mach 2.9) when it is approximately 20 km from its target.|$|R

5000|$|... {{maneuvering}} {{reentry vehicles}} (instead of symmetrical shape warheads) induce lateral drag during reentry and hence strongly bends the trajectory, thus deceiving lower altitude interceptor systems that generally assume a straight decelerating trajectory and {{which have a}} limited terminal guidance maneuverability and course correction capability (especially hit-to-kill or conventional warhead interceptors). This has some penalty in terms of decreased attacking warhead accuracy on the target (unless the reentry vehicle has an <b>active</b> <b>guidance</b> and control system onboard, which is quite complex to master).|$|E
50|$|The ASC-15 {{was first}} flown on SA-5, the first Saturn I Block II vehicle {{and the first}} to achieve orbit. It was a {{passenger}} on this mission, not guiding the vehicle but generating test data for later evaluation. The <b>active</b> <b>guidance</b> system on SA-5 was similar to that of earlier flights. The passenger system was the ASC-15 and the ST-124 inertial platform. Guidance was open loop; that is guidance commands were functions only of time. SA-5 also saw the introduction of the Instrument Unit.|$|E
5000|$|Homing [...] "fire and forget" [...] torpedoes can use passive or <b>active</b> <b>guidance,</b> or a {{combination}} of both. Passive acoustic torpedoes home in on emissions from a target. Active acoustic torpedoes home in on the reflection of a signal, or [...] "ping", from the torpedo or its parent vehicle; this has the disadvantage of giving away the presence of the torpedo. In semi-active mode, a torpedo can be fired to the last known position or calculated position of a target, which is then acoustically illuminated ("pinged") once the torpedo is within attack range.|$|E
