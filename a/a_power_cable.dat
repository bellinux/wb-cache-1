25|$|In {{the real}} world, {{the crew of}} the Nebuchadnezzar and the Hammer find and reactivate Niobe's ship, the Logos. They {{interrogate}} Bane, who says that he has no recollection of the earlier massacre. As the captains plan their defense of Zion, Neo requests a ship to travel to the Machine City. Motivated by her encounter with the Oracle, Niobe offers him the Logos. Neo departs, accompanied by Trinity. Bane, who has stowed away on the Logos, takes Trinity hostage. Neo realizes that Bane has been assimilated by Smith and a fight ensues. Bane cauterizes Neo's eyes with <b>a</b> <b>power</b> <b>cable,</b> blinding him; however, Neo discovers an ability to perceive the world as golden light. Neo kills Bane, and Trinity pilots them to the Machine City.|$|E

500|$|The {{remaining}} members opt {{to climb up}} the elevator shaft {{at the risk of}} destabilizing the pool. In the process, Janice loses her grip and falls into the shark-infested water. Despite Carter's attempts to save her, the shark ultimately kills her. In the facility's kitchen, which has been partially flooded, cook Sherman [...] "Preacher" [...] Dudley manages to kill the first shark with an explosion. He then makes his way to the elevator shaft, where he encounters Carter, Tom and Susan. Carter and Tom go to the flooded laboratory to activate a control panel that drains a stairway to the surface, while Susan heads to her room to collect her research material. Carter and Tom reach the control panel, but the largest shark ultimately kills Tom and destroys the controls. In her room, Susan is ambushed by another shark, but manages to kill it with <b>a</b> <b>power</b> <b>cable,</b> destroying her research in the process.|$|E
500|$|The typical GMAW {{welding gun}} {{has a number}} of key partsa control switch, a contact tip, <b>a</b> <b>power</b> <b>cable,</b> a gas nozzle, an {{electrode}} conduit and liner, and a gas hose. The control switch, or trigger, when pressed by the operator, initiates the wire feed, electric power, and the shielding gas flow, causing an electric arc to be struck. The contact tip, normally made of copper and sometimes chemically treated to reduce spatter, is connected to the welding power source through the power cable and transmits the electrical energy to the electrode while directing it to the weld area. [...] It must be firmly secured and properly sized, since it must allow the electrode to pass while maintaining electrical contact. On the way to the contact tip, the wire is protected and guided by the electrode conduit and liner, which help prevent buckling and maintain an uninterrupted wire feed. The gas nozzle directs the shielding gas evenly into the welding zone. Inconsistent flow may not adequately protect the weld area. Larger nozzles provide greater shielding gas flow, which is useful for high current welding operations that develop a larger molten weld pool. [...] A gas hose from the tanks of shielding gas supplies the gas to the nozzle. Sometimes, a water hose is also built into the welding gun, cooling the gun in high heat operations.|$|E
