5|$|The ACA's major {{provisions}} {{came into}} force in 2014. By 2016, the uninsured {{share of the}} population had roughly halved, with estimates ranging from 20–24 million additional people covered during 2016. The increased coverage was due, roughly equally, to an expansion of Medicaid eligibility and to major changes to individual insurance markets. Both involved new spending, funded {{through a combination of}} new taxes and cuts to Medicare provider rates <b>and</b> <b>Medicare</b> Advantage. Several Congressional Budget Office reports said that overall these provisions reduced the budget deficit, and that repealing the ACA would increase the deficit. The law also enacted a host of delivery system reforms intended to constrain healthcare costs and improve quality. After the law went into effect, increases in overall healthcare spending slowed, including premiums for employer-based insurance plans.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Increasingly, {{epidemiologic}} studies use {{administrative data}} to identify atrial fibrillation (AF). Capture of incident AF {{is not well}} documented. We examined incidence rates and concordance of AF diagnosis based on active cohort follow-up versus surveillance of Centers for <b>Medicare</b> <b>and</b> Medicaid Services data in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study. METHODS: Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities cohort participants without prevalent AF enrolled in fee-for-service <b>Medicare,</b> with inpatient <b>and</b> outpatient coverage, for at least 12 continuous months between 1991 and 2009 were included. In active Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study follow-up, annual telephone calls captured hospitalizations and deaths with incident AF diagnosis codes. For Centers for <b>Medicare</b> <b>and</b> Medicaid Services data, incident AF was defined by billed inpatient and outpatient diagnoses. RESULTS: Of 10, 134 eligible cohort participants, 738 developed AF according to both Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities <b>and</b> Centers for <b>Medicare</b> <b>and</b> Medicaid Services data; an additional 93 and 288 incident cases were identified using only Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities <b>and</b> Centers for <b>Medicare</b> <b>and</b> Medicaid Services data, respectively. Incidence rates per 1, 000 person-years were 10. 8 (95 % confidence interval: 10. 1 - 11. 6) and 13. 6 (95 % confidence interval: 12. 8 - 14. 4) in Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities <b>and</b> Centers for <b>Medicare</b> <b>and</b> Medicaid Services, respectively; agreement was 96 %; kappa was 0. 77 (95 % confidence interval: 0. 75 - 0. 80). Earlier AF ascertainment by one system versus the other {{was not associated with}} any cardiovascular disease risk factors, after accounting for sociodemographic factors. Additional Centers for <b>Medicare</b> <b>and</b> Medicaid Services events did not alter observed associations between risk factors and AF. CONCLUSION: Among fee-for-service enrollees, AF incidence rates were slightly lower for active cohort follow-up than for Centers for <b>Medicare</b> <b>and</b> Medicaid Services surveillance, because the latter included outpatient atrial fibrillation. Concordance was high and combining the two approaches could provide a more complete picture of newly-diagnosed AF...|$|R
