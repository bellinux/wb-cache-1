40|$|The {{microfinance}} {{industry is}} experiencing rapid growth and financing this growth {{is a legitimate}} concern. During the past decade, international commercial funding {{in the form of}} international equity and debt has played a remarkable role in this regard. Until now, microfinance research that focus on the performance implications of international funding of MFIs is inadequate even though microfinance literature is voluminous. Our study focuses on the presence of international shareholders in microfinance institutions. Using data from 148 Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) in 51 countries, we empirically determine MFI characteristics that relate to presence of international shareholders. We also investigate the influence of international shareholders on the overall financial performance of MFIs and operating cost. We find that 53 % of MFIs that are shareholder owned have international shareholders. This reiterates that there is a growing international equity funding for MFIs and that international equity is playing a remarkable role in financing the rising growth of the microfinance industry. Concerning the characteristics of MFIs, we find that shareholder MFIs that have international shareholders have high international orientation. Also, these MFIs often use village banking lending methodology, have higher outreach in terms of number of credit clients and usually serve urban markets. Regarding financial performance, we find that MFIs that have international shareholders are less profitable and less efficient in terms of ROE and ratio of cost to income respectively. We therefore conclude that the presence of international shareholders has a negative influence on overall financial performance of MFIs. In addition, MFIs that have international shareholders have higher operating cost profiles in the form of <b>administrative</b> <b>and</b> <b>personnel</b> <b>costs.</b> These findings are robust and as well, they are empirically and theoretically supported. The findings should however be generalized with caution. This is because, as literature suggests, performance improvements that result from having international shareholders may take time to realize and as well operating costs may be low in later years due to learning effects.

5000|$|However, a {{provision}} in the same bill (Sect. 3008) raised the cap on funding under Section 202(e), which allows cash resources to be “made available to Cooperating Sponsors for establishing new programs and meeting the specific <b>administrative,</b> management, <b>and</b> <b>personnel</b> <b>costs</b> of programs”(7 USC 1722(e)). Previously, the law restricted this funding to [...] "not less than 5 percent nor more than 10 percent." [...] The 2008 Farm Bill raised those values to 7.5 and 13 respectively and expanded the list of uses for those funds, giving the Office of Food for Peace greater flexibility to provide cash to cooperating sponsors when monetization would not be appropriate.|$|R

2500|$|The Organisational Bureau, usually {{abbreviated}} Orgburo, was {{an executive}} party organ. The Central Committee organised the Orgburo. Under Lenin, the Orgburo met at least 3 times a week, {{and it was}} obliged {{to report to the}} Central Committee every second week. The Orgburo directed all organisational tasks of the party. In the words of Lenin, [...] "the Orgburo allocates forces, while the Politburo decides policy." [...] In theory, the Orgburo decided all policies relating to <b>administrative</b> <b>and</b> <b>personnel</b> related issues. Decisions reached by the Orgburo would in turn be implemented by the Secretariat. The Secretariat could formulate and decide policies on party administration <b>and</b> <b>personnel</b> if all Orgburo members agreed with the decision. The Politburo frequently meddled in the affairs of the Orgburo, and became active in deciding <b>administrative</b> <b>and</b> <b>personnel</b> policy. Even so, the Orgburo remained an independent organ during Lenin's time, even if the Politburo could veto its resolutions. The Orgburo was an active and dynamic organ, and was in practice responsible for personnel selection for high-level posts; personnel selection for unimportant posts or lower-tier posts were the unofficial responsibility of the Secretariat. However, the Orgburo was gradually eclipsed by the Secretariat. The Orgburo was abolished in 1952 at the 19th Party Congress.|$|R
