5|$|Following Romania's {{transition}} to a Socialist Republic, the monarchy was excoriated by communist officials. Several biographies {{of the royal family}} described Marie either as a drunkard or as a promiscuous woman, referring to her many alleged affairs and to orgies she had supposedly organised before and during the war. In the years preceding the Romanian Revolution of 1989, Marie's popularity recovered and she was offered <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>of</b> patriotism to the population. Marie is primarily remembered for her work as a nurse, but is also known for her extensive writing, including her critically acclaimed autobiography.|$|E
5|$|Jefferson's most {{immediate}} sources were two documents written in June 1776: his own {{draft of the}} preamble of the Constitution of Virginia, and George Mason's draft of the Virginia Declaration of Rights. Ideas and phrases from both of these documents appear in the Declaration of Independence. They were, in turn, directly influenced by the 1689 English Declaration of Rights, which formally ended the reign of King JamesII. During the American Revolution, Jefferson and other Americans looked to the English Declaration of Rights <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>of</b> how to end the reign of an unjust king. The Scottish Declaration of Arbroath (1320) and the Dutch Act of Abjuration (1581) have also been offered as models for Jefferson's Declaration, but these models are now accepted by few scholars.|$|E

40|$|We {{study in}} this paper {{different}} topos-theoretical approaches {{to the problem of}} construction of General Theory of Relativity. In general case the resulting space-time theory will be non-classical, {{different from that of the}} usual Einstein theory of space-time. This is a new theory of space-time, created in a purely logical manner. Four possibitities are investigated: axiomatic approach to causal theory of space-time, the smooth toposes <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>models</b> <b>of</b> Theory of Relativity, Synthetic Theory of Relativity, and space-time as Grothendieck topos.

5|$|John {{was deeply}} {{suspicious}} of the barons, particularly those with sufficient power and wealth to potentially challenge the king. Numerous barons were subjected to John's malevolentia, even including William Marshal, a famous knight and baron normally held up <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>of</b> utter loyalty. The most infamous case, which went beyond anything considered acceptable at the time, was that of William de Braose, a powerful marcher lord with lands in Ireland. De Braose was subjected to punitive demands for money, and when he refused to pay a huge sum of 40,000 marks (equivalent to £26,666 at the time), his wife {{and one of his}} sons were imprisoned by John, which resulted in their deaths. De Braose died in exile in 1211, and his grandsons remained in prison until 1218. John's suspicions and jealousies meant that he rarely enjoyed good relationships with even the leading loyalist barons.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{paleontology}} {{has often}} classified Archaeopteryx {{as the most}} primitive bird. It is not {{thought to be a}} true ancestor of modern birds, but rather, a close relative of that ancestor. Nonetheless, Archaeopteryx was often used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>of</b> the true ancestral bird. Several authors have done so. Lowe (1935) and Thulborn (1984) questioned whether Archaeopteryx truly was the first bird. They suggested that Archaeopteryx was a dinosaur that was no more closely related to birds than were other dinosaur groups. Kurzanov (1987) suggested that Avimimus was more likely to be the ancestor of all birds than Archaeopteryx. Barsbold (1983) and Zweers and Van den Berge (1997) noted that many maniraptoran lineages are extremely birdlike, and they suggested that different groups of birds may have descended from different dinosaur ancestors.|$|E
5|$|Earl St Vincent was {{suffering}} from an extreme shortage of frigates, and on the arrival of Sensible at the Tagus immediately ordered the frigate to be commissioned as HMS Sensible, stripping six men from each of his ships to man her and turning the frigate into an active warship in just 12 hours. For a year Sensible remained with St. Vincent, until she {{was sent back to}} Britain in November 1799. On arrival the ship was downgraded from frontline service, but did spend several years commissioned as a military transport until wrecked off Ceylon on 3 March 1802. Among the treasures removed from the ship was a decorated brass cannon captured from the Ottomans in the seventeenth century and presented to the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem by King Louis XIV of France, as well <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>of</b> a galley made from gilt silver. These were sold, along with the other cargo and ships fittings at Sheerness in November 1799, the prize money shares subsequently awarded to the crew of Seahorse.|$|E

We define the general notion of logic <b>as</b> <b>a</b> structural consequence operation. Next we introduce the concept of logical matrices understood <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>models</b> <b>of</b> quantum logics. We give the definitions of two quantum consequence operations defined in these models. Comment: 11 page...|$|R
