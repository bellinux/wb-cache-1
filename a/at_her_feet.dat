5|$|Oviri {{has long}} blonde or grey hair {{reaching}} to her knees. Her head and eyes are disproportionately large, she has adolescent breasts, while the aperture {{at the back}} of her head resembles a vaginal orifice. She holds a wolf cub to her hip, a symbol of her indifference and wild power. It is not clear whether Oviri is smothering or hugging the cub, but her pose invokes ideas of sacrifice, infanticide and the archetype of the vengeful mother, influenced by Eugène Delacroix's 1838 painting, Medea About to Kill Her Children. A second animal, likely another wolf, is <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> either curling in submission or dead. Art historians including Sue Taylor suggest the second animal may represent Gauguin.|$|E
5|$|Brady and Hindley {{visited a}} {{fairground}} on 26 December 1964, {{in search of}} another victim, and noticed 10-year-old Lesley Ann Downey standing beside one of the rides. When {{it became apparent that}} she was on her own, they approached her and deliberately dropped some of the shopping they were carrying close to her, before asking for the girl's help to carry some of the packages to their car, and then to their home. Once inside the house Downey was undressed, gagged and forced to pose for photographs before being raped and killed, perhaps strangled with a piece of string. Hindley maintained that she went to fill a bath for the child and found the girl dead (presumably killed by Brady) when she returned. In Chris Cowley's book Face to Face with Evil: Conversations with Ian Brady, Brady states that it was Hindley who killed Downey. The following morning Brady and Hindley drove with Downey's body to Saddleworth Moor, where she was buried, naked with her clothes <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> in a shallow grave.|$|E

50|$|She was {{admitted}} to the Turkey's national athletic team at the 2008 Beijing Olympics for 400 m hurdles despite an injury <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>foot.</b> However, since <b>her</b> injury could not be cured out completely, she did not show at the competition's final run.|$|R

25|$|Amphitrite Pool, {{a shallow}} {{ceremonial}} pool {{on the grounds}} of the United States Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point, New York contains a statue of Amphitrite.

25|$|He was old, {{his life}} was behind him, and, save herself, he had no ties. What did it matter to him how his {{struggle}} should end? But she was young, she was beautiful, she might form new friendships, the world was before her, the world might yet be <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> and life, so sweet and so sad, and yet so good a thing withal, was ready and waiting for her.|$|E
25|$|As {{soon as the}} men are gone, the fairies {{change their}} attitudes, as if awaking from a dream. With the mortals now gone from their midst, the chastened fairies admit that they have all sinned. The fairy Ethais arrives {{with the news that}} fairies, like mortals, can love. But Selene warns that love is a deadly snare. The chorus praise Selene's purity, and Darine returns the crown to her head. The fairies kneel in adoration <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b>|$|E
25|$|Her tomb {{was created}} by Pietro Torrigiano, who {{probably}} arrived in England in 1509 and received the commission in the following year. The gilded bronze sculpture on the tomb depicts Margaret with her head resting on pillows and her hands raised in prayer, wearing garments characteristic of widowhood; the face was probably sculpted from a death mask. The black marble tomb is embellished with heraldic bronze insignia, including a yale, her heraldic badge, <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b>|$|E
6000|$|What aileth the bridegroom? He glares {{blank and}} wide; [...] Then {{suddenly}} turning he kisseth the bride; [...] His lips stung her with cold; she glanced upwardly mute: [...] "Mine own wife," [...] he said, and fell stark <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>foot</b> [...] In the word he was saying.|$|R

25|$|She {{was buried}} fully dressed on a cowhide in the coffin. She wore a loose bodice with sleeves {{reaching}} the elbow. She had a bare waist {{and wore a}} short string skirt. She had bronze bracelets and a woolen belt with a large disc decorated with spirals and a spike. <b>At</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> were the cremated remains of a child age 56. By her head {{there was a small}} birch bark box which contained an awl, bronze pins and a hair net.|$|E
25|$|The {{central panel}} shows the Adoration of the Magi, {{depicted}} {{in accordance with}} traditional iconography. A monumental Mary sits outside a precarious hut, with the Child held at her womb. Balthazar, the eldest of the Magi, is kneeling <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> with his gift before him: a golden sculpture with the Sacrifice of Isaac, a forecast of Jesus' Passion. Below the object are several toads, symbols of heresy. Balthazar's crown lies on the ground, an allusion to the powerlessness of earthly power against the celestial.|$|E
25|$|Back {{again in}} Lucca in 1406, he {{received}} the commission from the city's ruler, Paolo Guinigi, to begin work at the tomb of his second wife Ilaria del Carretto in the Lucca cathedral. The richly dressed woman rests {{on top of the}} sarcophagus, delicately portrayed in a Gothic fashion, with her dog, symbol of conjugate fidelity, <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b> But his use of several nude putti at the flanks of the tomb clearly shows the classical influence of the Roman sarcophagi at Camposanto (Pisa). This is a first, a harbinger of the incipient Renaissance.|$|E

25|$|At first, she refuses, then consents. A new dance {{begins in}} which Nisia, cupids, nymphs and sylphs take part. Everyone does {{homage to the}} new Venus and Candaules, drunk with pride, {{declares}} his consort to be the true Venus. Nisia declines these compliments, but Candaules orders the statue of Venus {{to be removed from}} its pedestal and Nisia lifted in its place. Candaules and his courtiers acclaim her as a goddess. The warriors present arms and the women strew flowers <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b> All at once, the sky grows dark and the priests and people look away in fear, while Candaules, in his arrogance, seems to defy the powers of Heaven.|$|E
25|$|I {{regret to}} say {{that none of us}} {{approved}} of the marriage at that time. Mother thought Jack was too young, and Lottie and I felt that Olive, being in musical comedy, belonged to an alien world. Ollie had all the rich, eligible men of the social world <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b> She had been deluged with proposals from her own world of the theater as well. Which was not at all surprising. The beauty of Olive Thomas is legendary. The girl had the loveliest violet-blue eyes I have ever seen. They were fringed with long dark lashes that seemed darker because of the delicate translucent pallor of her skin. I could understand why Florenz Ziegfeld never forgave Jack for taking her away from the Follies. She and Jack were madly in love with one another but I always thought of them as a couple of children playing together.|$|E
25|$|The March {{family also}} worked {{together}} on the war memorial at Sydenham, London, England. Sydney March was the main sculptor for the monument which is now {{a tribute to the}} deceased soldiers of both World War I and II who were employees of the Sydenham South Suburban Gas Works. The memorial in front of Livesey Memorial Hall in the London Borough of Lewisham features a bronze figure of Victory standing atop a globe on a wreathed base, with serpents <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b> Bronze plaques listed the names of fallen soldiers. The plaques also gave the names of those from the company who served in the wars. The Sydenham War Memorial was unveiled by Lord Robert Cecil on 4 June 1920. Also referred to as the Livesey Hall War Memorial, the monument was listed as a Grade II structure on the National Heritage List for England on 30 August 1996. In October 2011, three of the plaques {{from the front of the}} monument were stolen.|$|E

60|$|Hughey Blake, long-haired, barefooted and freckled, hung {{about the}} door of Nancy's cabin, where she sat with her little girl playing in the weedy turf <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>foot.</b> The late October weather was {{sometimes}} hot at noon, but the evenings were cool and the evening air was sweet {{with the scent of}} the ripened corn, and the faint odor of the fallen leaves. The grasshoppers still hissed; at moments the crickets within and without the cabin creaked plaintively.|$|R
25|$|She {{intended}} the final corrida of the 1949 season, in Jaén, Spain, {{to be the}} last of her career. She appeared in the ring together with the matadors Manolo Vázquez and Antonio Ordóñez. After performing on horseback with the bull, Cintrón rode to the box of the presidente and asked for permission to dismount for the kill. Permission was denied. This was her signal to leave the arena, and leave the killing of the bull to the novillero assigned to her for that task. Instead, she dismounted, grabbed his sword and muleta, caped the bull and prepared it for the kill. She actually went in for the kill and then dramatically let the sword drop to the sand. The bull charged. Cintrón stepped from his path and simulated the kill by touching his shoulders with her fingers as he rushed by. Pandemonium erupted in the stands and the audience threw hats and red carnations <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b> The novillero then entered the ring and performed the kill, as originally planned.|$|E
25|$|One {{example is}} a grave in Fyrkat, Denmark {{which turned out to}} be the richest grave in the area. She had been buried in a wagon from which the wheels had been removed. She had been plainly clad in what was {{probably}} only a long dress. Around her toes, she had toe rings, which suggests that she was buried without shoes or only in sandals so that the rings showed. At her head, she had a Gotlandic buckle which may have been used as a box, and she also owned objects from Finland and Russia. <b>At</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> she had a box which contained her magic tools, comprising a pellet from an owl as well as small bones from birds and mammals, and in a pouch she had the seeds of Hyoscyamus niger ("henbane"). If such seeds are thrown into a fire, they produce a hallucinogenic smoke which causes a sense of flying. In the grave there was also a small silver amulet that represented a chair made from a stump. When such small silver chairs are discovered in graves, they always belong to a woman, and it is possible that they represented objects such as the platform where the vǫlva performed her rituals and Hlidskjalf from which Odin watched across the world.|$|E
25|$|Woodwind and harp {{accompany}} a pensive {{version of}} the 'Dmitriy Motif'. The Pretender dreams of an assignation with Marina {{in the garden of}} her father's castle. However, to his annoyance, Rangoni finds him. He brings news that Marina longs for him and wishes to speak with him. The Pretender resolves to throw himself at Marina's feet, begging her to be his wife and Tsaritsa. He entreats Rangoni to lead him to Marina. Rangoni, however, first begs the Pretender to consider him a father, allowing him to follow his every step and thought. Despite his mistrust of Rangoni, the Pretender agrees not to part from him if he will only let him see Marina. Rangoni convinces the Pretender to hide as the Polish nobles emerge from the castle dancing a polonaise (Polonaise). Marina flirts, dancing with an older man. The Poles sing of taking the Muscovite throne, defeating the army of Boris, and capturing him. They return to the castle. The Pretender comes out of hiding, cursing Rangoni. He resolves to abandon wooing Marina and begin his march on Moscow. But then Marina appears and calls to him. He is lovesick. She, however, only wants to know when he will be Tsar, and declares she can only be seduced by a throne and a crown. The Pretender kneels <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b> She rejects his advances, and, attempting to spur him to action, dismisses him, calling him a lackey. Having reached his limit, he tells her he will depart the next day to lead his army to Moscow and to his father's throne. Furthermore, as Tsar he will take pleasure in watching her come crawling back looking for her own lost throne, and will command everyone to laugh at her. She quickly reverses course, tells him she adores him, and they sing a duet ("O Tsarevich, I implore you"). Rangoni observes the amorous couple from afar, and, joining them in a brief trio, cynically rejoices in his victory.|$|E
