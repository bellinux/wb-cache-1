50|$|Piperine is {{extracted}} from <b>black</b> <b>pepper</b> using dichloromethane. Aqueous hydrotropes {{can be used}} in the extraction to result in high yield and selectivity. The amount of piperine varies from 1-2% in long pepper, to 5-10% in commercial white <b>and</b> <b>black</b> <b>peppers.</b> Further, it may be prepared by treating the solvent-free residue from an alcoholic extract of <b>black</b> <b>pepper,</b> with a solution of potassium hydroxide to remove resin (said to contain chavicine, an isomer of piperine) and solution of the washed, insoluble residue in warm alcohol, from which the alkaloid crystallises on cooling.|$|R
5|$|Selling and {{purchasing}} fresh false morels {{is legal}} in Finland, {{where it is}} highly regarded. However, the mushrooms are {{required by law to}} be accompanied with a warning that they are poisonous and legally prescribed preparation instructions. False morels are also sold prepared and canned, in which case they are ready to be used. Official figures from the Finnish Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry report a total amount of false morels sold in Finland of 21.9tonnes in 2006 and 32.7tonnes, noted as being above average, in 2007. In 2002, the Finnish Food Safety Authority estimated annual consumption of false morels to be hundreds of tonnes in plentiful years. In Finnish cuisine, false morels may be cooked in an omelette, or gently sautéed in butter in a saucepan, flour and milk added to make a bechamel sauce, or pie filling. Alternatively, more fluid can be added for a false morel soup. Typical condiments added for flavour include parsley, chives, dill <b>and</b> <b>black</b> <b>pepper.</b>|$|E

25|$|Many Indian desserts, or mithai, are fried foods {{made with}} sugar, milk or {{condensed}} milk. Ingredients and preferred types of dessert vary by region. In {{the eastern part}} of India, for example, most are based on milk products. Many are flavoured with almonds and pistachios, spiced with cardamon, nutmeg, cloves <b>and</b> <b>black</b> <b>pepper,</b> and decorated with nuts, or with gold or silver leaf. Popular Indian desserts include gulab jamun, jalebi, laddu, peda etc.|$|E

Cumin seeds, chili powder, turmeric and bay leaves are also very popular. In the Punjab province, it is further diluted with coriander powder.

25|$|The {{quality of}} papads can vary due to quality of water used {{in various parts}} of India. To avoid any inconsistencies, the final {{products}} are tested in the Lijjat's laboratory in Mumbai. In the monthly meetings, the quality issue and modifications are tested. The central office purchases and distributes all ingredients to maintain the quality of the final product. For example, the urad dal is imported from Myanmar, asafetida is imported from Afghanistan, <b>and</b> <b>black</b> <b>pepper</b> comes from Kerala. The committee often makes surprise visits to various branches to assure that production conditions are hygienic. When a new branch of Lijjat opens, a neighbouring Lijjat branch helps it by guiding and training new members.|$|E
25|$|The {{style and}} flavor profile of wines made from Syrah is {{influenced}} by the climate where the grapes are grown with moderate climates (such as the northern Rhone Valley and parts of the Walla Walla AVA in Washington State) tending to produce medium to full-bodied wines with medium-plus to high levels of tannins and notes of blackberry, mint <b>and</b> <b>black</b> <b>pepper.</b> In hot climates (such as Crete, and the Barossa Valley and McLaren Vale regions of Australia), Syrah is more consistently full-bodied with softer tannin, jammier fruit and spice notes of licorice, anise and earthy leather. In many regions the acidity and tannin levels of Syrah allow the wines produced to have favorable aging potential.|$|E
25|$|After {{the conquest}} {{and during the}} colonial period, many other spices and {{ingredients}} were brought and have had a greater influence in the cooking here than {{in other parts of}} the country. From Europe, the Spanish brought saffron, parsley, thyme, marjoram, bay laurel, and cilantro as well Asian spices such as cloves, cinnamon, <b>and</b> <b>black</b> <b>pepper.</b> The Spaniards also brought wheat, rice, almonds, olives and olive oil, garlic, and capers. The latter three are essential ingredients in what is perhaps the most famous specialty of the region, huachinango a la veracruzana, red snapper in a spicy tomato sauce. Caribbean imports such as sugar cane and pineapple were adapted as well as the peanut, brought from Africa by the Portuguese via Brazil.|$|E

25|$|Spanish {{acceptance}} of chocolate came about due to modifications {{made to the}} drink. For example, sugar was added, mirroring the native Mexican and Mayan practice of adding honey to cacao beverages. New World spices were replaced with similar Old World spices, in part {{for the sake of}} familiarity, but also out of practicality. The Madrid physician Colmenero de Ledesma recommended substituting the rose of Alexandria for mecaxochitl flower blossoms <b>and</b> <b>black</b> <b>pepper</b> for Mexican chilies, when necessary. Cacao beverages containing maize, such as atole, gradually phased out {{due to the fact that}} maize-less chocolate lasted longer, making it more suitable for cross-Atlantic trips. While these changes sought only to approximate the existing flavors of chocolate, in turn internalizing Mesoamerican tastes in the Spanish, they were significant enough to break down their initial aversion to cocoa.|$|E
25|$|Variations on {{the flavor}} are gained by adding root {{vegetables}} such as parsnip, potato, sweet potato and celery root, herbs such as parsley, dill, other vegetables such as zucchini, whole garlic cloves or tomatoes <b>and</b> <b>black</b> <b>pepper.</b> The soup {{should be brought}} slowly {{to a boil and}} then simmered in a covered pot on a very low flame for one to three hours, adding water if necessary. A clearer broth is achieved by skimming the drops of fat {{off the top of the}} soup as it is cooking, first bringing the chicken to boil from a pot of cold water and discarding the water before continuing, or straining it through a strainer or cheesecloth. Saffron or turmeric are sometimes added as a yellow colorant. Then, the chicken can be shredded by hand and stored in the refrigerator until ready for use in the soup.|$|E
