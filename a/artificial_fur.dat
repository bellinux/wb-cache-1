25|$|Since {{turbulence}} at {{a surface}} {{is the source}} of wind noise, reducing gross turbulence can add to noise reduction. Both aerodynamically smooth surfaces, and ones that prevent powerful vortices being generated, have been used successfully. Historically, <b>artificial</b> <b>fur</b> has proved very useful for this purpose since the fibres produce micro-turbulence and absorb energy silently. If not matted by wind and rain, the fur fibres are very transparent acoustically, but the woven or knitted backing can give significant attenuation. As a material it suffers from being difficult to manufacture with consistency, and to keep in pristine condition on location. Thus there is an interest (DPA 5100, Rycote Cyclone) to move away from its use.|$|E

50|$|Traditionally, Tonghua {{occupied}} a railhub {{position in a}} region of China noted for trade in only three agricultural commodities. These were ginseng, marten furs and deer antler products. In the 1980s Tonghua had some success with a wine distillery producing sweet, sticky red wines that proved popular with local consumers. From 1987 onwards a bienniel wine festival was inaugurated, but this and the industry it promoted ultimately failed commercially owing to competition with joint-venture wine companies such as Dragon, {{who were able to}} produce a product that was marketable overseas. Following this failure, Tonghua industry was thrown back on its traditional agricultural products - and a few small but viable factories, including one specialising in <b>artificial</b> <b>furs.</b>|$|R

Afterwards Edwards and Kahn joined the group, and the talk fell upon love and the place of women in the renascent world. The cloudbanks of India lay under a quivering haze, and the blaze of the sun fell full upon the eastward precipices.

Ermine fur was particularly associated with European nobility, with the black-tipped tails arranged {{around the edges of}} the robes to produce a pattern of black diamonds on a white field.

40|$|Abstract Plush Love: Animal Anthropomorphism in Contemporary Art Isa Tousignant In The Open: Man and Animal, Giorgio Agamben writes: “the {{relation}} {{between man and}} animal marks the boundary of an essential domain, in which historical inquiry must necessarily confront that fringe of ultrahistory which cannot be reached without making recourse to first philosophy. ” (1) With this thesis I suggest {{an investigation of the}} historical and philosophical contexts of the human/nonhuman animal relationship through the lens of fursuiting and a body of contemporary visual art production that finds inspiration within that subject. Fursuiting is a practice undertaken by members of a subculture called the “furry fandom,” which centres on the appreciation of anthropomorphized animal characters that find their origins in the traditions of comics and animation. In addition to engaging in their own visual culture production featuring hybrid “humanimal” creatures, members of the furry fandom who don fursuits choose to dress up in full-body <b>artificial</b> <b>fur</b> costumes and perform in characters they feel express alternate identities. This thesis aims at uncovering that phenomenon, but focuses mainly on the identification and analysis of a secondary body of visual production that has resulted from the existence of fursuiting: the work produced by contemporary Canadian and American visual artists that uses fursuiting as a theme. This body of work has never been examined as a whole. (1) Giorgio Agamben, The Open: Man and Animal, trans. Kevin Attell (Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 2003), 21...|$|E
40|$|Various {{effects of}} marine fouling on piles have been {{addressed}} through a literature study and an experimental investigation. The experimental investigation was conducted on circular cylinders in steady current at subcritical Reynolds numbers. Hard marine fouling was modeled {{on the surface of}} three different cylinder models using sand and gravel particles with relative roughnesses k/D = 0. 01, 0. 02 and 0. 07. In addition, one cylinder model was kept smooth, while one cylinder model was covered with <b>artificial</b> <b>fur</b> to simulate soft marine fouling. The drag and the wake velocity were measured, and in addition a flow visualization was carried out. The cylinders had a free end and the tests were performed in a free surface flume tank. On the cylinders covered with artificial hard marine fouling, the mean drag was found to increase with increasing surface roughness. The mean drag of a cylinder covered by artificial soft marine fouling was almost three times the drag of a smooth cylinder with the same diameter. A cylinder with a diameter of 0. 042 m covered with artificial soft marine fouling, was found to have approximately the same drag as a 0. 10 m smooth cylinder. The streamwise velocity at points along the centerline of the wake was measured using the optical technique Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV). In the case of hard marine fouling, increasing surface roughness was found to increase the mean velocity near the cylinder, and to decrease the mean velocity further away from the cylinder. The results also indicated that increased surface roughness decreased the Reynolds number dependence of the wake closure length (the region where the mean velocity is negative). The presence of soft marine fouling was found to have a large impact on the mean velocity in the wake. Here, the wake closure length was found to be approximately 3. 6 - 3. 7 times longer than for a smooth cylinder. The flow visualization showed that the Strouhal number was reduced from approximately 0. 19 to 0. 16 when hard marine fouling was introduced. For soft marine fouling, the Strouhal number was approximately 0. 11. The visualization also supported the findings from the LDV tests. It was concluded that marine fouling could have large consequences for both the forces on a circular cylinder and on the flow around it. The effects of soft marine fouling were found to be more significant than the effects of hard marine fouling for all parameters in the investigation. </p...|$|E
