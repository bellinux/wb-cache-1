5|$|The corps, part of Georg-Hans Reinhardt's Third Panzer Group, {{was located}} at Kalinin, 160km (100mi) {{northwest}} of Moscow. It was worn out, {{at the end}} of a long and tenuous supply line (Model had been promoted on 28 October, and needed two weeks just to get to Kalinin), and the cold weather was starting to hamper the Germans. Nevertheless, morale remained high, and the final push towards Moscow began shortly after his arrival. Model was <b>a</b> <b>whirlwind</b> <b>of</b> energy, touring the front and exhorting his troops to greater efforts: he also ran roughshod over the niceties of protocol and chains of command, and, in general, left his staff trailing in his wake. By 5 December, XLI Panzer Corps' 6th Panzer Division had reached Iohnca, just 35km (22mi) from the Kremlin. There, the advance stopped, as the winter took hold. Temperatures dropped 20 to 40°C below zero, weapons and vehicles froze solid, and the Germans were forced to call a halt to offensive operations.|$|E

25|$|The trees {{passed with}} an unseen speed, feverish enthusiasm filled our arteries, we lifted our machine {{with the effort}} of our pushing, the cyclists who {{accompanied}} us, although they were fresh, could not follow us, and it was with happiness that we waved to them {{from the top of}} the Petites Soeurs hill in that town of Agen so distant, so desired. A splendid woman gave us flowers there and it was in <b>a</b> <b>whirlwind</b> <b>of</b> dust that we arrived at the Gravier velodrome, in the middle of a crowd of people gathered for the bicycle races and to applaud our arrival. All Agen was there.|$|E

25|$|Any object {{can be used}} as a Portkey; it {{is common}} {{practise}} to select old, worthless items, to discourage unsuspecting Muggles from picking them up and activating them. Portkey objects used in the Potter series include a football and an old Wellington boot. Once the Portus charm is cast upon an object, it glows blue and vibrates gently; once settled it has become a Portkey. When Portkeys are activated, users feel the sensation of a hook being jerked from behind their navel. The floor disappears from beneath their feet, leaving their last position behind them, and they fly forward through <b>a</b> <b>whirlwind</b> <b>of</b> colour and sound, appearing suddenly at their destination. With enough practice it is possible to achieve a graceful landing: After the Portkey trip to the Quidditch World Cup in the fourth film, Mr. Weasley, Cedric and Amos Diggory land on their feet, while the less experienced teenagers, including Harry, fall on the ground.|$|E
500|$|Rick Ross drops by to say hi, {{keeping his}} {{appearance}} so brief that I can't {{help but wonder}} what he's even doing here. Justin Vernon inexplicably bookends the thing, pushing his falsetto into Antony range on the outro and muttering befuddling lyrics {{that have nothing to}} do with the rest of the song. All this over the straight-up funkiest beat Kanye West has made in years, a rippling electro push-pull that adds an effortless strut to his recent progged-out chilliness. But all that other stuff fades into the background when Nicki Minaj shows up. [...] She's <b>a</b> <b>whirlwind</b> <b>of</b> energy, showing her full repertoire of nutso voices and kicking the living fuck out of the beat, sounding like she's having an absolute blast the whole time." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Jackson {{has reached}} superstar {{status in the}} United States, she has yet {{to achieve the same}} level of {{response}} internationally. According to Nacy Berry, vice chairman of Virgin Records, Janet marked the first time the label [...] "had centrally coordinated and strategized a campaign on a worldwide basis" [...] which ultimately brought her to a plateau of global recognition. Her historic multimillion-dollar contract made her the highest-paid artist in history, until brother Michael renegotiated his contract with Sony Music Entertainment only days later. Sonia Murry noted that she remained [...] "the highest-paid female in pop... <b>a</b> <b>whirlwind</b> <b>of</b> fashion, personality and slick musical packaging rivaled only by Madonna and Whitney Houston in today's pop pantheon." [...] James Robert Parish, author of Today's Black Hollywood (1995) wrote: [...] "She confirmed her status as today's Queen of Pop when, not long ago, she signed a $35-$40 million recording contract with Virgin Records." [...] Music critic Nelson George noted that while surpassing Michael would be next to impossible, Janet had assuredly reached iconic status. He explained: [...] "What worked for Michael 10 years ago is working for her now... Michael was clearly the voice of the '80s, those that grew up with him since Motown. And with the themes (independence, social consciousness and up-front yet responsible sexuality) that she's addressing in her albums and the popularity she's enjoying, she could very well be the voice of the '90s." ...|$|E

2500|$|Montgomery's {{assumption}} of command transformed the fighting spirit and {{abilities of the}} Eighth Army. Taking command on 13 August 1942, he immediately became <b>a</b> <b>whirlwind</b> <b>of</b> activity. He ordered {{the creation of the}} X Corps, which contained all armoured divisions to fight alongside his XXX Corps which was all infantry divisions. This was in no way similar to a German Panzer Corps. One of Rommel's Panzer Corps combined infantry, armour and artillery units under one corps commander. The only common commander for Montgomery's all infantry and all armour corps was the Eighth Army Commander himself. Correlli Barnett commented that Montgomery's solution [...] "...was in every way opposite to Auchinleck's and in every way wrong, for it carried the existing dangerous separatism still further." [...] Montgomery reinforced the [...] long front line at El Alamein, something that would take two months to accomplish. He asked Alexander to send him two new British divisions (51st Highland and 44th Home Counties) that were then arriving in Egypt and were scheduled to be deployed in defence of the Nile Delta. He moved his field HQ to Burg al Arab, close to the Air Force command post in order better to coordinate combined operations.|$|E

Chris Barsanti of Filmcritic.com commented, [...] "Blazing {{across the screen}} with eye-popping, sublime artwork, Kung Fu Panda sets itself apart from the modern domestic animation trend with its sheer beauty [...] the film enters instant classic status {{as some of the}} most gorgeous animation Hollywood has produced since the golden age of Disney." [...] Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune called the film [...] "one of the few comedies of 2008 in any style or genre that knows what it's doing". However, Tom Charity of CNN criticized the action for [...] " [...] to blur into <b>a</b> <b>whirlwind</b> <b>of</b> slapstick chaos" [...] and considered the character of Po similar to others played by Black. Peter Howell of The Toronto Star awarded the film two and a half stars, considering it to have a [...] "lack of story" [...] that [...] "frequently manages to amuse, if not entirely to delight".|$|E
