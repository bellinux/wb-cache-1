5|$|On February 10, 2017, ABC renewed Grey's Anatomy for a fourteenth season, which premiered on September 28, 2017. The series' success catapulted such long-running {{cast members}} as Pompeo, Dempsey, <b>and</b> <b>Oh</b> to {{worldwide}} recognition; {{they were among}} the top five highest-earning television actors in 2013.|$|E
5|$|Angelou {{followed}} her first two installations of her autobiography, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (1969) and Gather Together in My Name (1974), with Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas, published in 1976. It {{marked the first}} time a well-known African-American woman writer had expanded her life story into a third autobiography. She also published two volumes of poetry entitled Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie (1971), which was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize, <b>and</b> <b>Oh</b> Pray My Wings Are Gonna Fit Me Well (1975).|$|E
5|$|A third {{milestone}} in Wodehouse's life came {{towards the end}} of 1915: his old songwriting partner Jerome Kern introduced him to the writer Guy Bolton, who became Wodehouse's closest friend and a regular collaborator. Bolton and Kern had a musical, Very Good Eddie, running at the Princess Theatre in New York. The show was successful, but they thought the song lyrics weak and invited Wodehouse to join them on its successor. This was Miss Springtime (1916), which ran for 227 performances—a good run {{by the standards of the}} day. The team produced several more successes, including Leave It to Jane (1917), Oh, Boy! (1917–18) <b>and</b> <b>Oh,</b> Lady! Lady!! (1918), and Wodehouse and Bolton wrote a few more shows with other composers. In these musicals Wodehouse's lyrics won high praise from critics as well as fellow lyricists such as Ira Gershwin.|$|E

5|$|Early in the game's development, {{the music}} team were shown an early build before {{starting}} {{work on the}} score. Their work was mostly complete later in development but they continued composing until its final build was submitted for manufacturing. Edgar Froese, Tangerine Dream's founding member, initially rejected the offer of producing music for a video game. After he was flown to the studio and shown the game, he was impressed by its scale and cinematic nature, and changed his mind. Froese's first eight months of work on the score produced 62 hours of music. He recorded with Tangerine Dream in Austria but further work was conducted at Jackson's United States studio, which The Alchemist <b>and</b> <b>Oh</b> No used as well.|$|E
5|$|On September 13, 2012, it was {{announced}} that veteran film and television actor Jang Hyuk had been offered the lead in IRIS 2. Actress Lee Da-hae was confirmed on September 18 as being eyed for the female lead in the series, which would reunite her with co-star Jang Hyuk from their work on 2010s award-winning historical series Chuno. In addition to confirming the two leads, on September 19, several additions were made to the cast, with Kim Seung-woo, Kim Min-jong, Kim Yeong-cheol, Im Soo-hyang, <b>and</b> <b>Oh</b> Yeon-soo all being confirmed for the series. Kim Seung-woo has signed on to reprise his role of North Korean agent Park Cheol-young previously featured in Iris and Athena, while Kim Min-jong is set to return as defector Kim Gi-soo from Athena and Kim Yeong-cheol is to come back as the villain from the original series, Baek San. Several others, including Kang Ji-young from South Korean pop group Kara, Yoon Doo-joon of boy band B2ST, and Lee Joon from MBLAQ were all also discussed for roles, along with American actor Daniel Henney.|$|E
5|$|The {{show has}} {{received}} ten Golden Globe Award nominations since its premiere.

The following year, at the 64th Golden Globe Awards, in 2007, Pompeo was nominated for Best Actress in a Drama Series, and the show won the award for Best Drama Series. At the 65th Golden Globe Awards, in 2008, Heigl was nominated for Best Supporting Actress in a Series, Miniseries, or Television Film, while the series in whole was nominated for Best Drama Series.|$|E

40|$|Soft X-ray induced {{chemistry}} of H 2 O, CO <b>and</b> CH 3 <b>OH</b> <b>and</b> {{the effects of}} the water and nitric acid hydrate (HNO 3 center dot 1. 65 H(2) O) matrix on the photo{{chemistry of}} CO <b>and</b> CH 3 <b>OH</b> have been investigated using NEXAFS spectroscopy. For pure H 2 O, CO <b>and</b> CH 3 <b>OH</b> ices, we show that the destruction rates are strongly limited by back reactions, leading to strikingly high survival rates of these molecules upon the harsh irradiation conditions to which they are submitted. We also evidence the interplay between the photochemical reactions of CO <b>and</b> CH 3 <b>OH</b> <b>and</b> those of the matrix. The <b>OH</b> <b>and</b> O radicals released by the photolysis of H 2 O and HNO 3 react with the CO <b>and</b> CH 3 <b>OH</b> <b>and</b> their fragments, considerably reducing the survival rates compared to pure CO and pure CH 3 OH ices, especially in presence of nitric acid, and dramatically enhancing the formation of CO 2 at the expense of CO. Because NEXAFS spectroscopy allows identifying which reactions are important among those possible, it emerges a simple picture of the photochemical routes of CO <b>and</b> CH 3 <b>OH</b> in the H 2 O and HNO 3 /H 2 O environments...|$|R

25|$|Knowing {{that the}} group {{containing}} the boron {{will be replaced by}} a hydroxyl group, {{it can be seen that}} the initial hydroboration step determines the regioselectivity. Hydroboration proceeds in an antimarkovnikov manner. The reaction sequence is also stereoselective, giving syn addition (on the same face of the alkene): the hydroboration is syn-selective and the oxidation replaces the boron with hydroxyl having the same geometric position. Thus 1-methylcyclopentene reacts with diborane predominantly to give trans-1-hydroxy-2-methylcyclpentane—the newly added H <b>and</b> <b>OH</b> are cis to each other.|$|E
