5000|$|Clyde McPhatter's roots were in {{the black}} church. The song is {{essentially}} the gospel song [...] "Have Mercy, Jesus" [...] sung in the call-and-response style of a gospel quartet, although {{it is in the}} straight twelve-bar blues form that gospel singers disdained. In the first chorus McPhatter simply follows the melody, but subsequently he freely improvises in the gospel style with short but spectacular melismas, stringing out phrases to overlap the backup singers responses, interjecting screams <b>and</b> <b>yeahs,</b> shouting a gospel funk. The backup band lays down the rhythm and provides the expected tenor sax solo.|$|R

It'll be big, it'll probably be one of the bigger Beyoncé music videos ever done. And, I can say that I think the song is unbelievable. The Gaga thing took me by surprise, 'cause I've done videos for probably 15 years, and I had forgotten what it felt like to have a video premiere and have it be anticipated and have it explode. <b>And</b> <b>yeah</b> I hope the same for Beyoncé, but I don't know if that's gonna happen. It is a fantastic song, so I really hope that song catches for her, and I think the video's gonna be really fun and cool and different for her." ...|$|E

The engrossingly simple gameplay combined with the more-strategic-than-they-first-appear battles was just too much to resist. <b>And</b> <b>yeah,</b> the 'gotta catch 'em all' gimmick is still effective, not to mention necessary to build a well balanced party. There's just something about tracking down, capturing, and training all those Pokémon that really draw you into the game's world." [...] He justified the games' graphics by comparing them to the [...] "ugly" [...] original Red and Blue versions. Additional praise was given to the new features such as the contextual tutorial, and flashbacks when loading a saved game, as well as the games' multiplayer capabilities via the Wireless adapter.|$|E

[...] I'm on the phone every minute of every day, talking to people, being creative, planning this Ball, and my tour manager is constantly saying, 'Come on, we have to go, we've got to go right now,' [...] But to me, the Ball is so important.

And for me, if you're going to produce something, you're fucking there. I don't care who you are." [...] He also added: [...] "He is overrated, he is overpaid, and I will never work with him again." [...] Conversely, Slipknot's guitarist Jim Root had said in that same interview that [...] "A lot of {{the guys in the}} band say Rick was unavailable. <b>And</b> <b>yeah,</b> he takes on a lot of projects at one time, but he also does things that are beneficial. He would listen to what we'd done, then have us retrack things that needed work. He's kind of like Big Brother up on the hill. Even though he wasn't there physically every day, he was.

500|$|During {{the late}} 1990s and early 2000s, several {{alternative}} rock bands emerged, including The Strokes, Franz Ferdinand, Interpol and [...] The Rapture that drew primary inspiration from post-punk and new wave, establishing the post-punk revival movement.

Owing to the success of these bands, Entertainment Weekly declared in 2004, [...] "After almost a decade of domination by rap-rock and nu-metal bands, mainstream alt-rock is finally good again." [...] Worldwide arena tours for alternative rock acts were culled to a few well-established players such as U2, Muse and Foo Fighters with American band Thirty Seconds to Mars experiencing a notable rise in popularity during {{the latter half of the}} 2000s. American rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers entered a new-found popularity in 1999 after the release of their album Californication (1999), with continued success throughout the 2000s.|$|E

[...] "All these people that say, 'Oh, you can't do that, and you can't do this, and you can't say that.' I guess it's just the times." [...] Eastwood also said {{that while he was}} not endorsing Trump, he did see where he was coming from at times, even though the filmmaker stated that the candidate has said dumb things. [...] "What Trump is onto is he's just saying what's on his mind. And sometimes it's not so good. And sometimes it's … I mean, I can understand where he's coming from, but I don't always agree with it. I haven't endorsed anybody. I haven't talked to Trump. I haven't talked to anybody. You know, he's a racist now because he's talked about this judge. <b>And</b> <b>yeah,</b> it's a dumb thing to say. I mean, to predicate your opinion {{on the fact that the}} guy was born to Mexican parents or something. He's said a lot of dumb things. So have all of them. Both sides. But everybody—the press and everybody's going, 'Oh, well, that's racist," [...] and they're making a big hoodoo out of it. Just fucking get over it. It's a sad time in history.'" [...] Eastwood also said, when asked if he was still a Libertarian, that he was a little bit of everything and that he wants this generation to get to work and be more understanding instead of calling people names. [...] "Kick ass and take names," [...] Eastwood said. When asked which candidate he would prefer between Trump and Hillary Clinton, Eastwood replied, [...] "That's a tough one, isn't it? I'd have to go for Trump … you know, 'cause she's declared that she's gonna follow in Obama's footsteps. There's been just too much funny business on both sides of the aisle. She's made a lot of dough out of being a politician. I gave up dough to be a politician. I'm sure that Ronald Reagan gave up dough to be a politician." ...|$|E

2500|$|By {{the end of}} 2001, Live 105 had {{drastically}} lost listeners due to {{the generally}} unpopular music assortment that was being played, which included heavier amounts of hip hop and heavy metal.

2500|$|In his 2004 book Appropriating Technology: Vernacular Science and Social Power, Ron Eglash {{commented that}} a sonically and {{politically}} charged album such as Nation [...] "can {{be considered a}} monument to the synthesis of sound and politics".

[...] It featured a producers' panel that reunited Hank Shocklee, captain of the Bomb Squad, with the Chairmen of the Boards from Greene St. Recording. When asked in 2008 if the album would still be considered as radical if it were released two decades later, Chuck D said he felt it would [...] "simply because it's faster than anything on the radio right now. <b>And</b> <b>yeah,</b> it's radical politically... because it's not really being said a lot.

2500|$|For the Dreamcast version, AllGame commented, [...] "Xtreme Sports {{looks good}} but doesn't play well, {{a classic example}} of effort being put into visuals but not enough into the game's heart. When it comes to video games, style is important, but {{substance}} that is paramount when it comes to rating a title. And while Xtreme Sports offers a distinct experience in the way it combines a number of different events into a single track, it doesn't focus enough on the gameplay of the individual sports to make the whole package compelling." [...] GameSpot noted, [...] "If you're expecting six perfect games wrapped up in one title, you'll only find disappointment. However, if you're in the mood for a game where each event is reasonably well designed and integrated into a greater, meatier whole, then Infogrames' Xtreme Sports should prove satisfying." [...] IGN stated, [...] "Certainly not the greatest game to ever slide down the pipe, Xtreme Sports is still not without some charm. Yes, it could have been better had a couple of the events been tightened up in the gameplay department, <b>and</b> <b>yeah,</b> it would have made a lot more sense had the characters been more diverse from one another (Is it me, or is EVERYONE five foot nine?), but I guess that's what sequels are for.
