25|$|Unlike other {{submarines}} in her class, Onslow {{was fitted}} with a four-man diver <b>access</b> <b>hatch,</b> allowing for easier deployment and recovery of special forces divers.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} gun <b>access</b> <b>hatch</b> was retained however, allowing Alliance to {{be equipped}} with a small calibre deck gun again when serving in the Far East during the Indonesian Confrontation of the earlier 1960s.|$|R
50|$|This spacing is not coincidental, as {{the docks}} and the lakers they could load evolved together, and laker <b>hatch</b> <b>spacing</b> is {{typically}} 12, or 24 ft on center.|$|R
50|$|An <b>access</b> <b>hatch</b> {{was moved}} from the {{starboard}} rear fuselage to underneath, and an extra longitudinal stiffening strake, identical to that already fitted to the starboard side of production Mosquitos, was fitted to the port fuselage.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} laser {{sintering}} parameters (laser power, scan speed and <b>hatching</b> <b>space)</b> and post sintering process (heating rate, sintering temperature and holding time) {{on the physical}} and mechanical properties of porcelain components have been investigated. The study {{has been carried out}} using the Taguchi’s method for the experimental design. In the laser sintering process, lower laser energy density and higher <b>hatching</b> <b>space</b> will increase the final mechanical properties of the porcelain components. A stress relief principle has been put forward to explain the different influence of the factors. The appropriate laser sintering parameters are attained in this paper: laser power 50 W; scan speed 85 mm/s; and <b>hatching</b> <b>space</b> 0. 6 mm. Sintering temperature has been determined {{to be the most important}} factor in the post sintering process. Appropriate sintering temperature for the laser sintered porcelain bodies is in the range of 1425 – 1475 ◦C regarding the mechanical properties of the porcelain components. The maximum bending strength, 34. 0 ± 4. 9 MPa, is reached...|$|R

40|$|A novel particle-based {{discrete}} element model (DEM) {{is developed}} {{to simulate the}} whole Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS) process, which includes simplified powder deposition, recoating, laser heating, and holding stages. This model is first validated through the simulation of particle flow and heat conduction in the powder bed, and the simulated results are in good agreement with either experiment in the literature or finite element method. Then the validated model is employed to the DMLS process. The effects of laser power, laser scan speed, and <b>hatch</b> <b>spacing</b> on the temperature distributions in the powder bed are investigated. The results demonstrate that the powder bed temperature rises as the laser power is increased. Increasing laser scan speed and laser <b>hatch</b> <b>spacing</b> will not affect the average temperature increase in the powder bed since energy input is kept same. However, a large <b>hatch</b> <b>spacing</b> may cause non-uniform temperature distribution and microstructure inhomogeneity. The model developed in this study {{can be used as}} a design and optimization tool for DMLS process...|$|R
50|$|This GRP {{model was}} {{introduced}} in 1987, combining the structural improvements of the Mark II with greater storage space in the bow. A horizontal bulkhead divides the bow buoyancy tank, and both {{the upper and lower}} sections have large <b>access</b> <b>hatches</b> creating secure stowage spaces.|$|R
50|$|The main {{electrical}} system is Toshiba's {{gate turn-off thyristor}} field chopper control used in the 1000 series. For maintenance of the DC compound motors, {{it is necessary to}} inspect and maintain the brushes, so each motored car has <b>access</b> <b>hatches</b> in the floor of the car.|$|R
50|$|The WT10 Advantic is a {{development}} of the commercially successful two-seat Aerospool WT9 Dynamic.

5|$|In Chicago, {{a man by}} {{the name}} of Henry Weems wins $100,000 playing poker against a mobster named Joe Cutrona, though Weems appears ignorant of the basic rules of poker. Suspecting that Weems cheated, Cutrona {{attempts}} to kill him by throwing him off the 29th story of the building they are in. After Weems lands in an <b>access</b> <b>hatch</b> to a basement, he stands right back up and walks away, completely uninjured. Two agents in a car stationed outside witness the event and eventually tell Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), who promptly take the case. Mulder initially believes the man has the ability to cure himself, but Scully thinks he may just be very lucky by landing in a pile of laundry that was right under the <b>access</b> <b>hatch.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{structures}} and mechanical subsystem {{of a space}} station are considered. The subsystem includes basic structure (pressurization, equipment support, meteoroid protection, radiators, insulation, and docking interfaces), the docking mechanisms, spacecraft <b>access</b> (<b>hatches,</b> airlocks, and view ports), and antenna deployment mechanisms.

5000|$|An {{example of}} what might be popularly termed an [...] "oubliette" [...] is the {{particularly}} claustrophobic cell in the dungeon of Warwick Castle's Caesar's Tower, in central England. The <b>access</b> <b>hatch</b> consists of an iron grille. Even turning around (or moving at all) would be nearly impossible in this tiny chamber.|$|R
50|$|The plane {{began to}} flood. The tugboat's captain then broke the aircraft's {{windshield}} {{to tie a}} cable to the cockpit's control wheel and proceeded to tow the craft to the river bank. During the tow all passengers remained on board. Passengers and crew then evacuated the cabin via an <b>access</b> <b>hatch</b> on the plane's roof.|$|R
30|$|Many {{parameters}} {{are involved in}} an SLM process, such as laser power, scan speed, <b>hatch</b> <b>spacing,</b> layer thickness, powder materials and chamber environment. Defects are inevitably introduced {{if any of these}} {{parameters are}} improperly chosen. The common defects are classified in three types: porosities, incomplete fusion holes, and cracks.|$|R

In the crossing of Krasińkiego and Stołeczna streets {{there was an}} <b>access</b> <b>hatch</b> into the sewer, by which communication with the Old Town was kept.|$|R
30|$|Therefore, as an {{integrated}} parameter, energy density represents the combined {{effect of the}} major process parameters on defect formation in an SLM process. Energy density is handy to use in selecting the appropriate laser power, scan speed, <b>hatch</b> <b>spacing,</b> layer thickness to minimize the defects and improve the manufacturing efficiency in the SLM process.|$|R
5|$|Another rare variant was the Bergepanzer IV armored {{recovery}} vehicle. Some {{were believed}} to have been converted locally, 21 were converted from hulls returned for repair between October 1944 and January 1945.

50|$|Blue Sector {{contains}} station administration, docking bays, personnel housing, and the Medlabs. Babylon 5 {{is controlled}} from Command and Control, also called C&C, {{which is at}} the head of the station. At the center of the head of the station is the <b>access</b> <b>hatch</b> that ships enter through (because of its limited size bigger ships have to park outside the station, relying on shuttle and transfer services instead).|$|R
50|$|Every 600 m or {{so there}} are <b>access</b> <b>hatches.</b> These were meant for {{periodic}} maintenance from the inside by workers. A man would lie prone on a cart and scrape moss off {{the inside of the}} pipe and clear sediments, rocks and dead fish which inevitably backed up in places. Placed on top of these hatches were wire mesh domes, which reduced pressure build up and helped aerate the water.|$|R
50|$|The Reatta {{featured}} twin bucket {{seats with}} a storage area behind the seats featuring two lockable bins and a lockable <b>access</b> <b>hatch</b> {{to the rear}} trunk. At introduction, options included 16-way power seats in lieu of 6-way power seats, side moldings in either black or body color and pinstripe delete. A sunroof became optional in late 1988, and in 1989 keyless entry was added as a standard feature.|$|R
30|$|Many process parameters, such as laser power, scan speed, <b>hatch</b> <b>spacing,</b> layer thickness, and scan strategy, have {{significant}} {{influences on the}} formation of defects. Energy density is an integrated parameter for controlling defect formation; scan strategy has a significant influence on the location distribution of defects, most of the defects distribute {{at both ends of}} scan tracks and in between two adjacent tracks.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Warpage is {{a crucial}} factor to {{accuracy}} of sintering part in selective laser sintering (SLS) process. In this paper, The influence of process parameters on warpage when sintering polystyrene(PS) materials in SLS are investigated. The laser power, scanning speed, <b>hatch</b> <b>spacing,</b> layer thickness as well as temperature of powder are considered as the main process parameters. The results showed that warpage increases {{with the increase of}} <b>hatch</b> <b>space.</b> Contary to it, warpage decreases with the increase of laser power. Warpage decreases with the increase of layer thickness between 0. 16 ~ 0. 18 mm and changes little with increase of the thickness. Warpage increases along with the increase of scanning speed but decreases when the speed is over about 2000 mm/s. When the temperature changes between 82 °C- 86 °C, warpage decreases little with the increase of temperature. But further increase of temperature leads to warpage decreasing sharply when the temperature changes between 86 °C- 90 °C...|$|R
25|$|An {{alternative}} design used counterbalance {{weights to}} raise the fort. This allowed the fort to be raised by the physical strength of the garrison. This design had two <b>access</b> <b>hatches</b> and, with a slightly larger underground chamber {{and the elimination of}} the central pneumatic ram the fort could have a crew of four men. Under consideration in late 1940, this alternative design was not used in significant numbers and only about a dozen were installed.|$|R
50|$|Access to the Zeppelin was {{achieved}} {{in a number}} of ways. The Graf Zeppelin's gondola was accessed while the vessel was on the ground, via gangways. The Hindenburg also had passenger gangways that led from the ground directly into its hull and which could then be withdrawn entirely as well as ground access to the gondola and an exterior <b>access</b> <b>hatch</b> via its electrical room which was intended for crew use only.|$|R
50|$|Incorporated {{into the}} design are {{considerations}} for filling and unwatering (e.g., air release/vacuum valves, filling/unwatering procedures and requirements for pumping), {{as well as the}} need and means for metering of flows during operation. Accommodations to inspect and maintain the tunnel is access through the shaft conduits by proper sizing of manholes and <b>access</b> <b>hatches,</b> invert gradients (the tunnel must generally slope toward the access shafts) and locating the metering devices at accessible locations.|$|R

50|$|The on-orbit {{propulsion}} {{systems of the}} HL-42 looked superficially {{like those of the}} Shuttle, on a smaller scale. At the rear, one {{on each side of the}} <b>access</b> <b>hatch,</b> were two orbital manoeuvering system (OMS) engines, used to adjust the orbit, rendezvous with other spacecraft, and finally de-orbit. The fully fuelled OMS was capable of giving the HL-42 a total velocity change (delta-v) of 290 m/s, similar to the 300 m/s figure for the Shuttle.|$|R
50|$|The seven {{members of}} the Space Shuttle {{closeout}} crew help astronauts strap in {{and take care of}} any other last-minute needs that arise. The crew is also responsible for closing and sealing the crew <b>access</b> <b>hatch</b> and are the last non-crew members that astronauts see before returning from the mission. The Shuttle closeout crew consists of elite technicians, an active astronaut who is not assigned to that mission and a NASA quality inspector.|$|R
30|$|The {{density of}} the {{finished}} part depends on gaps between the sintered material generated during manufacture. These can be reduced by adjusting peak laser power, scan speed, <b>hatch</b> <b>spacing,</b> particle size and chamber pressure.
