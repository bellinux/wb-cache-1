5|$|In the subplot, Moe {{decides to}} expand his {{customer}} base by turning his tavern into a family restaurant. The stress of running the business by himself ultimately unnerves him and he soon snaps <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> girl. The restaurant is a failure, forcing Moe to revert to a run-down tavern.|$|E
5|$|One {{was first}} {{released}} on May 29, 1998 in regular and limited edition versions playable on Windows PCs in CD-ROM format; the limited edition included the game's first original soundtrack. Both the limited and regular {{editions of the}} original game contained no voice acting. On April 1, 1999, KID released an all ages version in regular and limited editions playable on the PlayStation under the title Kagayaku Kisetsu e; the PS version contained full-voice acting. On September 14, 2000, AI System released One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e Memorial Selection, which was essentially the original game, though the price was cheaper <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{less than half the}} original price. On January 1, 2003, a full voice version of the Windows game was released by Nexton. Kōhei was not voiced in any of the versions.|$|E
5|$|That evening, {{his wounds}} became infected; he {{suffered}} a strong fever and septicemia set in. His doctors considered amputating his leg, but none wished {{to take responsibility for}} so drastic an act. On 19 October, he became delirious and called out for his mother, but the Greek government refused to allow her to re-enter the country from exile in Switzerland, despite her own protestations. Finally, the queen dowager, Olga, George I's widow and Alexander's grandmother, was allowed to return alone to Athens to tend to the king. She was delayed by rough waters, however, and by the time she arrived, Alexander had already died of sepsis twelve hours previously <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> after 4 p.m. on 25 October 1920. The other {{members of the royal family}} received the news by telegram that night.|$|E

5|$|The copper mines prospered {{for about}} seventy years, {{but by the}} early 17th century the {{industry}} was in decline. Demand for copper fell {{and the cost of}} extracting it was high. Graphite mining continued, and quarrying for slate began to grow in importance. Other small-scale industries grew up, such as tannery and weaving. Although the boom of the mid-16th century had finished, the town's economy did not slide into ruin, and the population remained generally constant <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> under 1,000.|$|E
5|$|A UK Kennel Club survey {{puts the}} median {{lifespan}} of Miniature Schnauzers <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> over 12 years. About 20% lived to >15 years. While generally a healthy breed, Miniature Schnauzers may suffer health {{problems associated with}} high fat levels. Such problems include hyperlipidemia, which may increase the possibility of pancreatitis, though either may form independently. Other issues which may affect this breed are diabetes, bladder stones and eye problems. Feeding the dog low- or non-fatty and unsweetened foods may help avoid these problems. Miniature Schnauzers are also prone to comedone syndrome, a condition that produces pus filled bumps, usually on their backs, {{which can be treated}} with a variety of methods. Miniature Schnauzers should have their ears dried after swimming due to a risk of infection, especially those with uncropped ears; ear examinations {{should be part of the}} regular annual check up. Miniature Schnauzers are also prone to von Willebrand disease (vWD). vWD in dogs is an inherited bleeding disorder that occurs due to qualitative or quantitative deficiency of von Willebrand factor (vWF), a multimeric protein that is required for platelet adhesion.|$|E
5|$|On the August 10 {{episode of}} Raw, Triple H met with Michaels at an office {{cafeteria}} in Texas where Michaels {{was working as}} a chef; throughout the show, Triple H tried to convince Michaels to return to WWE from hiatus. After several incidents (including grease grill burgers on fire and Michaels shouting <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> girl), Michaels agreed to team with Triple H to face The Legacy at SummerSlam, superkicked the girl, and quit his chef job. On the August 17 episode of Raw, Triple H and Michaels officially reunited as DX, but {{as they were in the}} process of their in-ring promo, The Legacy attacked them both. Their first match after reuniting was against The Legacy at SummerSlam, which they won. At Breaking Point, however, they lost to The Legacy in the first ever Submissions Count Anywhere match in WWE history.|$|E

5|$|Richard's son, Edmund {{took over}} the earldom in 1278 but had little {{interest}} in Lydford, preferring Restormel and Lostwithiel; by his death in 1299 the castle had been left to decay and was in ruins. It reverted to the Crown, and when Edward II made his royal favourite, Piers Gaveston, the Earl of Cornwall in 1307, Lydford Castle was passed to him. The castle was repaired {{at the start of the}} century and was in use once again as a prison. Edward II and Gaveston fell from power in 1327 and Thomas le Ercedekne was temporarily entrusted with the castle and Dartmoor by the new regime. In 1329 the castle was valued <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> over £11. Piers Gaveston's widow, Margaret de Clare, leased the property to Tavistock Abbey, and it continued to operate as a prison.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} his life, Sorabji ceased composing, {{because of}} his failing {{eyesight}} and difficulties in holding a pen. His health deteriorated severely in 1986, obliging him to abandon his home and spend several months in a Wareham hospital. In March 1987, together with his companion Reginald Norman Best (1909–1988), he moved into a two-room suite in Marley House Nursing Home, a private nursing home in Winfrith Newburgh, where he was permanently chairbound and received daily nursing care. In June 1988 he suffered a mild stroke, which left him slightly mentally impaired. He died of heart failure on 15 October 1988 <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> after 7pm, at the age of 96. He was cremated in Bournemouth Crematorium on 24 October of that year, and the funeral services took place in Corfe Castle Parish Church on the same day.|$|E

25|$|Some {{estimates}} of the Red Terror range from 38,000 to ~172,344 lives. Paul Preston, speaking in 2012 {{at the time of}} the publication of his book The Spanish Holocaust, put the figure <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> under 50,000.|$|E
25|$|On April 13, 2017, <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> before 6 pm {{the ride}} stalled {{along the same}} length as the 2014 incident. 24 riders were stuck on the train, and firefighters rescued all the riders {{with the use of}} a cherry picker by 9:20 PM, more than two hours after the park's closing and almost four hours after the train got stuck.|$|E
25|$|Blumenthal {{moved from}} the BBC to Channel 4 in March 2008, joining the channel's group of celebrity chefs which already {{included}} Jamie Oliver, Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and Gordon Ramsay. In January 2009 a three-part series of television programmes on Channel 4 covered his efforts to revamp the menu <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>Little</b> Chef motorway restaurant on the A303 road at Popham The Little Chef group extended Blumenthal's menu to 12 branches but, in 2013, removed his dishes from all restaurants.|$|E

25|$|The Faces of Evil and The Wand of Gamelon {{were the}} first two Nintendo-licensed games {{released}} on the Philips CD-i. They were given the relatively low budget of approximately $600,000 and the development deadline was set <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> over a year—time which {{would have to be}} split between the two games. It was decided by Animation Magic, the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based development team led by Dale DeSharone, that the two games would be developed in tandem and would share the same graphics engine to more efficiently use the budget.|$|E
25|$|The {{turnaround}} {{in the fiscal}} performance is particularly noteworthy. Around {{the start of the}} 21st century, Morocco's overall deficit stood at 5.3 percent of GDP, and gross total government debt amounted to three-fourths of GDP. In 2007, reflecting a strong improvement in revenue performance and moderate growth in expenditure, the budget was close to balance. Under the combined effect of a prudent fiscal policy and sizeable privatization receipts, the total debt stock had shrunk by 20 percentage points, and now stands <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> over half of GDP. As a result, perceptions of Morocco's creditworthiness have improved.|$|E
25|$|He scored his 212 against Canterbury in 260 minutes. He {{opened the}} batting {{on the first}} day, was 103 not out at lunch, and was fourth out not long after tea with the score at 343, on a day in which Wellington scored 494 for 9 wickets off 94 eight-ball overs. So {{he is likely to}} have scored <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> under a run a ball. His 204 a few weeks later was {{probably}} a little slower, but no less impressive: he came to the wicket at 18 for 1, reached his double-century in 262 minutes, and was last out in a team total of 374 off 85.1 overs.|$|E
