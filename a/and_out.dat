5|$|After {{receiving}} the post-touchdown kickoff, Auburn {{began to run}} out the clock. The Tigers failed {{to pick up a}} first down, and after going three <b>and</b> <b>out,</b> punted the ball back to Virginia Tech. The Hokies started their drive at their two-yard line, and Randall began it successfully by completing a 20-yard pass, rushing for 10yards, then completing a five-yard pass to bring the Hokies near midfield. On the fourth play of the drive, however, Randall was intercepted by Auburn's Derrick Graves. The Tigers, their offense again on the field, began running out the clock again. Tech attempted to interrupt Auburn's clock management by calling timeouts after each play, stopping the clock with each timeout. Virginia Tech forced Auburn into a three <b>and</b> <b>out,</b> and the Tigers again punted the ball away with 2:13 remaining.|$|E
