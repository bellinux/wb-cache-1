5|$|O you, Son, who, {{concealed}} in your mother's womb, you gather together peoples by your Father's act – for I perchance {{am able to}} compose a holy narrative because you are seen to be God, because, glorious one, the glittering stars show (you) to the world; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask,</b> after the close of my life, that you grant {{to me from the}} throne of heaven to take a tiny gift because of the honour (I have) attained.|$|E
500|$|... "Fire in My Heart" [...] is 2 {{minutes and}} 45 seconds long {{and is in}} the key of E major. The song begins with Gruff Rhys singing the first verse backed only by finger picked {{acoustic}} guitar. Rhys's vocals are joined by sparse drums, a synthesizer, organ and harmony backing vocals in the second verse which immediately follows the first at 31 seconds. The drums become louder during the third and final verse which leads into a bridge that begins after 1 minute and 31 seconds. During the bridge Rhys sings the lines [...] "Oh the monkey puzzle tree has some questions for the watchdogs of the profane, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask,</b> is it sad that I'm driving myself mad as this fire in my heart turns blue". A key change to F♯ major follows for the final verse, with Rhys repeating the line [...] "I've got a fire in my heart for you" [...] backed by multiple harmony vocals. The song ends with a coda during which Rhys elongates the word [...] "you" [...] over the chords A minor, A, G minor and F.|$|E
2500|$|On 24 February after a veto by Russia and China of an Arab League-backed initiative, Clinton blasted Russia and China saying, [...] "It's quite {{distressing}} {{to see two}} {{permanent members}} of the Security Council using their veto while people are being murdered — women, children, brave young men... It is just despicable <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> whose side are they on? They are clearly not {{on the side of the}} Syrian people." ...|$|E
60|$|Now {{my heart}} began to sink <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> Houman what was to happen to me.|$|R
60|$|We {{turned over}} some more photographs, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> {{her if she}} had always lived at Grimwinter.|$|R
60|$|But on the {{way home}} was my opportunity, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> what my half- brother really thought of M. d'Aubepine.|$|R
2500|$|With protesters {{gathering}} daily {{outside her}} Lima apartment building, lighting candles and demanding that she either be deported from Peru, or reimprisoned, Berenson {{sent a letter}} to President Alan Garcia admitting her [...] "criminal responsibility for terrorist collaboration" [...] and further writing [...] "I would also like to say that I very much regret the harm I have caused Peruvian society, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> forgiveness from people who have been affected by my actions or words." [...] She then requested that her sentence be commuted so she could return to the United States.|$|E
2500|$|At another point, a death-obsessed Gordon {{wrote in}} his diary: [...] "Better a bullet to the brain than to flicker out unheeded". In a letter that reached Cairo in December, Gordon wrote: [...] "Farewell. You will never hear from me again. I fear {{that there will be}} treachery in the garrison, and all will be over by Christmas." [...] On 14 December 1884, Gordon wrote the last entry in his diary, which read: [...] "Now MARK THIS, if the Expeditionary Force <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> for no more than two hundred men, does not come in ten days, the town may fall; and I have done my best for the honour of our country. Goodbye, C. G. Gordon". A chain-smoking Gordon {{constantly}} paced the roof of his palace during the day, looking vainly for smoke on the Nile indicating that the steamers were coming, while spending {{much of the rest of}} his time in prayer.|$|E
2500|$|... "Legionary Romania has {{solved the}} Jewish Question. That which the Oct. Goga-presided {{government}} has only attempted, the Legion {{has managed to}} achieve {{in less than three}} months. The Jews have been removed not just from the state apparatus, but also from the industry [...] commerce, where cooperative and neat Legionary organizations are striving and succeeding in taking their place. [...] We have a duty to pose overtly and without delay the problem of liquidating this miserable ghetto that is currently forming itself. It is time to ask: What do we do with them? Because to leave them free to multiply like rabbits, to consume our goods, to hate us and produce nothing in return, that cannot be. In Legionary Romania {{there is no room for}} drones. [...] It would serve Jews to know that we are not the passive bearers of a social rot, but the national surgeons of a national cancer. Hence I ask our own: what do we do with them? <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> the Jews to reply honestly: what do you do?" ...|$|E
60|$|He {{had been}} {{spending}} the winter with his people at Tangiers, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> {{him how he}} liked the place.|$|R
6000|$|... "Some months ago,--before these sad {{things had}} occurred,--I {{told you what}} I thought of you, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> you for a favour." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I want to {{know why}} a pig gets fat on barley-meal, when an ox wants mange, and {{oil-cake}} <b>and</b> hay. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> Nurse, <b>and</b> she said little boys mustn't <b>ask</b> questions; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> Purday, <b>and</b> he said it was because pigs is pigs, and oxen is oxen. Why do you think it is, Miss Fosbrook?" ...|$|R
2500|$|In the April of {{his first}} year in Australia he {{attended}} a picnic to farewell Charles St Julian, who had been appointed Chief Justice of Fiji. In responding to a toast, the 17-year-old Celua said in Fijian: [...] "I thank you for so heartily drinking this toast. Speechmaking is a new thing to me, you must therefore please excuse my words being few. I come from a once dark land – a land of cannibal cruelty – but Christianity has raised us from the lowest degradation, and now we are a Christian people. We are now trying to establish law and order in our land, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> you to help us. We most earnestly desire the establishment of law, and if you will help us it can be done. We want to govern Fiji in every respect as this land is governed. I have come to white man's land to be trained at Newington College. I am anxious to be taught. You were born in the light, I in the darkness. You were born in a Christian land, I in a heathen country. I wish to be trained here that I may be of service in the government of my own country. Again I thank you for so heartily drinking prosperity to Fiji." ...|$|E
2500|$|Clement Attlee, Leader of the (Labour) Opposition, responded. He quoted some of Chamberlain's (and Churchill's) {{previous}} confident assertions {{about the}} likely {{victory of the}} British. Ministers' statements and, even more so, the press, guided (or deliberately left uncorrected) by the government, had painted far too optimistic {{a picture of the}} Norwegian campaign; [...] "at last, when the enemy had been locked behind his walls, he had now put out his head to be hit", which prompted Conservative MP and Chamberlain supporter William Davison to shout, [...] "It was very badly hit." [...] Attlee then turned to the conduct of the campaign itself, concluding that [...] "the gravamen of my attack on the Government {{is that it does not}} seem that there was a thinking-out of our plans beforehand, that there was not adequate intelligence, that there was not the necessary concentration on the essential objective <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> whether, at any time, there was not delay and discussion where action was necessary?" [...] He then attacked the organisation of the Government, talking of [...] "a failure of grip, a failure of drive" [...] in pursuit of the war, concluding, [...] "I say that there is a widespread feeling in this country, not that we shall lose the war, that we will win the war, but that to win the war, we want different people at the helm from those who have led us into it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is the question," [...] rejoined Sir Patrick. [...] "You {{admit the}} {{existence}} of the public feeling <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask,</b> what good does it do?" ...|$|E
60|$|As I shook old Harût's hand in {{farewell}} {{he told me}} that he {{was going}} on to Egypt, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> him why.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have hurt}} a man {{down in the}} village," [...] was the terrified answer. [...] "I didn't mean to--no! I swear that I did not mean to. I went to his house <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> him for money. I {{had a right to}} it! <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> him to tell me where--but oh! you would not understand. Listen! I swear to you that I did not mean to hurt him. Why should I? He was old, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think he fainted. God! do you hear that?" ...|$|R
60|$|Old {{tradition}} was strong in us; all English inns {{in those days}} charged the unexpected, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> what our lunch was to cost.|$|R
6000|$|... "Fear not, O Queen," [...] I answered, [...] "this thing {{shall be}} done, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> no reward, {{who have come}} hither to do thy bidding to the end." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{accept the}} offer," [...] said the Knight, [...] "as frankly {{as it is}} given; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> {{permission}} to dispose of Sir Maurice de Bracy at my own pleasure." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, we must act; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> {{counsel of}} my brother, {{because it may}} be that Manitou shall cause wisdom and light to flow from the lips of the white man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's true, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> for {{information}} because I {{may be in}} love myself someday and all this will be useful, don't you see?" ...|$|R
60|$|As we {{went along}} in silence I noticed that Peterkin sighed {{once or twice}} very heavily, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> {{him if he was}} quite well.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{have the}} general's {{permission}} {{to go with him}} to meet Brant," [...] he cried, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> with, perhaps, just a tinge of jealousy: ...|$|R
60|$|Well, regrets of {{that kind}} are useless now. I am truly sorry, Bernard, for the evil that I have done to you; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> your pardon with a contrite heart.|$|E
60|$|Pala. There 'tis; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> {{your pardon}} heartily for calling your memory into question: I assure you I'll trust it another time, without putting {{you to the}} trouble of another token.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now the {{opportunity}} is here, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> {{you if you}} desire to take me for your husband, as, above everything in the world, I desire to make you my beloved wife." ...|$|E
60|$|This {{was good}} news, {{so far as}} it went, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> again if Thomas Halstead had also been spared, since he, too, was an Englishman.|$|R
6000|$|He {{could not}} tell whether she was appeased or not, and he rather feared not. [...] "You don't <b>ask</b> why. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> you why at once." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{had to have}} a {{young lady}} {{assistant}} to help us work this graft; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> Buck if he knew of one to fill the bill.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let a man commit no fault, {{and then}} what you say will be true. I made a mistake, and allowed myself to be so governed by it as to commit a great injustice. I am aware of it, and I trust I may never repeat it. Such a mistake as that I think that I shall never commit again. But I did it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> you to forgive me." [...] In answer to this she could only embrace him and hang upon him, and implore him in silence to spare her. [...] "So it has been, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> your pardon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Do {{what you}} like with me,' said the girl, turning to the men again; 'but do what I ask you first, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> you to give this message for God Almighty's sake.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was not wishing {{you to give}} me so {{much your}} own ideas, as the common talk of the town; but I see that my {{question}} was indiscreet, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> your pardon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I couldn’t {{hear what}} you were saying, {{and then when you}} went outside <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> you whether you were going home you said ’yes,’ didn’t you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No! Mrs. Bowie. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> her {{to let me}} {{have you}} at table. And here's my chance. Everybody's talking. Listen, and don't interrupt. You know Mono Creek?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I {{think it}} must have been your children. I found them in front of your house, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> them for you, without going to the door." ...|$|R
