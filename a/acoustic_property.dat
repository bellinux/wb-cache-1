50|$|There is {{evidence}} that the acquisition of language-specific prosodic qualities start even before an infant is born. This is seen in neonate crying patterns, which have qualities that are similar to the prosody of the language that they are acquiring. The only way that an infant could be born with this ability is if the prosodic patterns of the target language are learned in utero. Further evidence of young infants using prosodic cues is their ability to discriminate the <b>acoustic</b> <b>property</b> of pitch change by 1-2 months old.|$|E
40|$|Photoacoustic imaging is an {{upcoming}} medical imaging modality {{with the potential}} of imaging both optical and acoustic properties of objects. We present a measurement system and outline reconstruction methods to image both speed of sound and acoustic attenuation distributions of an object using only pulsed light excitation. These acoustic properties {{can be used in}} a subsequent step to improve the image quality of the optical absorption distribution. A passive element, which is a high absorbing material with a small cross-section such as a carbon fiber, is introduced between the light beam and the object. This passive element acts as a photoacoustic source and measurements are obtained by allowing the generated acoustic signal to propagate through the object. From these measurements we can extract measures of line integrals over the <b>acoustic</b> <b>property</b> distribution for both the speed of sound and the acoustic attenuation. Reconstruction of the <b>acoustic</b> <b>property</b> distributions then comes down to the inversion of a linear system relating the obtained projection measurements to the <b>acoustic</b> <b>property</b> distributions. We show the results of applying our approach on phantom objects. Satisfactory results are obtained for both the reconstruction of speed of sound and the acoustic attenuation...|$|E

40|$|The {{speech signal}} may {{be divided into}} {{frequency}} bands, each containing temporal properties of the envelope and fine structure. For maximal speech understanding, listeners must allocate their perceptual resources to the most informative acoustic properties. Understanding this perceptual weighting {{is essential for the}} design of assistive listening devices that need to preserve these important speech cues. This study measured the perceptual weighting of young normal-hearing listeners for the envelope and fine structure in each of three frequency bands for sentence materials. Perceptual weights were obtained under two listening contexts: (1) when each <b>acoustic</b> <b>property</b> was presented individually and (2) when multiple acoustic properties were available concurrently. The processing method was designed to vary the availability of each <b>acoustic</b> <b>property</b> independently by adding noise at different levels. Perceptual weights were determined by correlating a listener’s performance with the availability of each <b>acoustic</b> <b>property</b> on a trial-by-trial basis. Results demonstrated that weights were (1) equal when acoustic properties were presented individually and (2) biased toward envelope and mid-frequency information when multiple properties were available. Results suggest a complex interaction between the available acoustic properties and the listening context in determining how best to allocate perceptual resources when listening to speech in noise...|$|E

40|$|Listeners {{often only}} have {{fragments}} of speech available {{to understand the}} intended message due to competing background noise. In order to maximize successful speech recognition, listeners must allocate their perceptual resources to the most informative acoustic properties. The speech signal contains temporally-varying acoustics in the envelope and fine structure that are present across the frequency spectrum. Understanding how listeners perceptually weigh these acoustic properties in different frequency regions during interrupted speech {{is essential for the}} design of assistive listening devices. This study measured the perceptual weighting of young normal-hearing listeners for the envelope and fine structure in each of three frequency bands for interrupted sentence materials. Perceptual weights were obtained during interruption at the syllabic rate (i. e., 4 Hz) and the periodic rate (i. e., 128 Hz) of speech. Potential interruption interactions with fundamental frequency information were investigated by shifting the natural pitch contour higher relative to the interruption rate. The availability of each <b>acoustic</b> <b>property</b> was varied independently by adding noise at different levels. Perceptual weights were determined by correlating a listener’s performance with the availability of each <b>acoustic</b> <b>property</b> on a trial-by-trial basis.

This study was motivated by the need to assess risks associated with incorporating acoustic testing capability in wind tunnels with semicryogenic high Reynolds number aerodynamic and/or low pressure capabilities. The study consisted of three phases: 1) measurement of <b>acoustic</b> <b>properties</b> of selected liner materials at subatmospheric pressure conditions, 2) periodic cold soak and high pressure exposure of liner materials for 250 cycles, and 3) determination of the effect of periodic cold soak on the <b>acoustic</b> <b>properties</b> of the liner materials at subatmospheric conditions and the effect on mechanical resiliency. The selected liner materials were Pyrell foam, Fiberglass, and Kevlar. A vacuum facility was used to create the subatmospheric environment in which an impedance tube was placed to measure <b>acoustic</b> <b>properties</b> of the test materials. An automated cryogenic cooling system was used to simulate periodic cold soak and high pressure exposure.
