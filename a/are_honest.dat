5|$|One {{class of}} honest signal is the aposematic warning signal, {{generally}} visual, given by poisonous or dangerous {{animals such as}} wasps, poison dart frogs, and pufferfish. Warning signals <b>are</b> <b>honest</b> indications of noxious prey, because conspicuousness evolves in tandem with noxiousness. Thus, the brighter and more conspicuous the organism, the more toxic it usually is. The most common and effective colours are red, yellow, black and white.|$|E
5|$|The {{function}} of aposematism {{is to prevent}} attack, by warning potential predators that the prey animal has defences such as being unpalatable or poisonous. The easily detected warning is a primary defence mechanism, and the non-visible defences are secondary. Aposematic signals are primarily visual, using bright colours and high-contrast patterns such as stripes. Warning signals <b>are</b> <b>honest</b> indications of noxious prey, because conspicuousness evolves in tandem with noxiousness. Thus, the brighter and more conspicuous the organism, the more toxic it usually is.|$|E
5|$|The {{question}} of whether selection of signals works {{at the level of}} the individual organism or gene, or {{at the level of the}} group, has been debated by biologists such as Richard Dawkins, arguing that individuals evolve to signal and to receive signals better, including resisting manipulation. Amotz Zahavi suggested that cheating could be controlled by the handicap principle, where the best horse in a handicap race is the one carrying the largest handicap weight. According to Zahavi's theory, signallers such as male peacocks have 'tails' that are genuinely handicaps, being costly to produce. The system is evolutionarily stable as the large showy tails <b>are</b> <b>honest</b> signals. Biologists have attempted to verify the handicap principle, but with inconsistent results. The mathematical biologist Ronald Fisher analysed the contribution that having two copies of each gene (diploidy) would make to honest signalling, demonstrating that a runaway effect could occur in sexual selection. The evolutionary equilibrium depends sensitively on the balance of costs and benefits.|$|E

500|$|The term honesty {{in animal}} {{communication}} is controversial because in non-technical usage it implies intent, to discriminate deception from honesty in human interactions. [...] However, biologists {{use the phrase}} [...] "honest signals" [...] in a direct, statistical sense. [...] Biological signals, like warning calls or resplendent tail feathers, <b>are</b> <b>honest</b> if they truly convey useful information to the receiver. [...] That is, the signal trait conveys to the receiver {{the presence of an}} otherwise unobservable factor. [...] Honest biological signals {{do not need to be}} perfectly informative, reducing uncertainty to zero; all they need to be useful is to be correct [...] "on average", so that certain behavioural responses to the signal are advantageous, statistically, compared to the behaviour that would occur in absence of the signal. Ultimately the value of the signalled information depends on the extent to which it allows the receiver to increase its fitness. Hence, [...] "honest" [...] signals are evolutionarily stable.|$|E

500|$|The {{narrative}} mode of Burger's Daughter alternates between Rosa Burger's internal monologues and {{the anonymous}} narrator, whom Gordimer calls [...] "Rosa's conscious analysis, her reasoning approach {{to her life}} and to this country, and... my exploration as a writer of what she doesn't know even when she thinks she's finding out". Abdul R. JanMohamed, professor of English and African American Literature at Emory University, calls this change of perspective a [...] "stylistic bifurcation", which allows the reader to see Rosa from different points of view, rendering her a complex character who is full of contradictions. The two narratives, the subjective and the objective viewpoints, complement each other. JanMohamed explains that while the objective, third-person narrative is factual and neutral, the subjective first-person narrative, Rosa's voice, is intense and personal. Rosa's monologues are directed towards Conrad, her lover, {{in the first part}} of the story, her father's former wife, Katya, while Rosa is in France, and her father after she returns to South Africa. Because her imagined audience is always sympathetic and never questions her, Rosa's confessions <b>are</b> <b>honest</b> and open.|$|E
