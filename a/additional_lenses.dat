50|$|At long last, Rollei had {{a camera}} that could match the Hasselbad 500C. Indeed, {{had it been}} {{released}} earlier, around 1960 say, {{it could have been}} enormously successful. On top of that, despite declining profit margins and tough competition from the Japanese, Rollei continued to target its advertising at the amateur market. In contrast, other companies such as Leitz and Hasselblad had better understood how to promote their expensive cameras in photographic magazines - not just through paid advertising, but also through feature articles in the editorial pages. As a result, the SL66 never sold in the numbers that the company had hoped for or needed. Nevertheless, Rollei owes its survival as a company to the SL66 camera system, along with its enduring reputation for quality. Its successor, the SL66E, was released in 1984; externally the camera was largely unchanged, but it now had a built-in light meter. <b>Additional</b> <b>lenses</b> were released, such as the Fisheye-Distagon (f/3.5, 30 mm), the Distagon (f/4, 40 mm), and the Sonnar (f/4, 150 mm) with a between-the-lens shutter along with more accessories including close-up lenses, extension bellows, a Polaroid film cassette, a sheet film cassette, an underwater housing, and a ring flash unit. Its successor, the SL66-X, released in 1968 only had TTL flash metering, while the SL66-SE (Special Edition) also included a standard light meter. Prior to this, TTL metering required a special prism viewfinder with a built-in light meter. The release in 1992 of the SE Exclusive Professional incorporating selective gold-plating on the housing marked the end of the SL66 series.|$|E

5000|$|The {{technology}} of cinema projection, {{and with it}} the role of the projectionist, changed fundamentally over an extended period between the early 1950s and late 1960s. Nitrate film was superseded by cellulose triacetate for release printing in the US and Europe over about a five-year period following the stock's commercial launch in October 1948 (though older nitrate prints remained in circulation {{for quite a long time}} afterwards and still showing in licensed cinemas as late as the 1990s for special screenings). With nitrate went the restrictions on reel lengths previously necessitated by the fire risk, with the result that systems were developed to enable the projection of a complete feature film using a single projector and unattended. Two essential technologies were needed to enable this: the long-play device, a.k.a. platter, i.e. a turntable 4-6 feet in diameter or (in the case of Sword Systems and Sabre Systems by EPRAD) an extremely large film reel 3-5 feet in diameter either of which enabled the reels of a feature presentation to be joined together into a single roll, in some cases up to 30,000 feet (approx. six hours at 24fps) in length; and the xenon arc lamp, which can burn continuously and unattended for as long as is needed (most carbon arc lamphouses will run for a maximum of 40-50 minutes before the carbon rod needs replacing, and require regular adjustment by the projectionist during that time). Automation systems were also introduced, which could be programmed in advance of each screening to perform functions such as operating auditorium lighting, adjusting volume levels and changing audio formats. Some would argue that these technologies reduced the skill level or downgraded the showmanship element of the projectionist's job (for example, by eliminating the need for changeovers and nitrate handling precautions). Others would argue that more advanced skills were needed in other areas. With the introduction of widescreen in the early 1950s, projectionists had to cope with the <b>additional</b> <b>lenses,</b> aperture plates and masking systems needed for different aspect ratios for the first time. [...] Multiple channel audio systems using magnetic sound and 70mm film prints were also introduced in the 1950s, and these required specialist projection skills to handle. Like nitrate film prints, xenon arc bulbs require special safety precautions: if handled incorrectly they can explode, causing serious injury to the projectionist. Staffing levels in projection booths decreased rapidly during this period. In the classical [...] "movie palace", the labour-intensive nature of changeovers, carbon arc lamps and nitrate handling required large workforces of projectionists, with up to six or seven working in a single booth and a rigid management hierarchy within the profession being common. In contrast, the multiplexes of the 1980s and '90s were designed in such a way that a single projectionist can operate simultaneous screenings in 10-20 auditoria, and it is unusual for these venues to have a total projectionist workforce of more than three or four.|$|E

Progressive <b>additional</b> <b>lenses</b> {{is a new}} approach to compensate for the defects of presbyopia for the human visual system. While using two or more single-vision lenses with different power, progressive <b>additional</b> <b>lenses</b> require the specification of free surfaces. A progressive additional lens comprises a large distance zone with low power on the upper portion of the lens, a small near zone with higher power on the lower part, and a progressive corridor of increasing power connects these two zones smoothly and progressively. In this work, we proposed an optimization approach to the progressive additional lens design problem, in which, a cost function which balances the power distribution and other optical aberrations up to the second order aberrations. The goal is to minimize the cost function. In previous progressive additional lens design, the formulas for the power and astigmatism of the lens is an approximation of the refraction on the front and back lens surface. Also, the assumption of the thickness of the lens $d ll 1 $ limits the design to be a thin lens design. To better evaluate the exact properties of the optical system, one should study the ray tracing though the lens and the wavefront passing through a lens. Therefore, geometric optics is employed to evaluate how a wavefront is deformed by a lens and how the curvature of a wavefront is transformed when propagating through a homogeneous medium and refracting on a lens surface. To understand the second order aberration of the optical system, a concept of Third Order Surface coefficients is also introduced. Wavefront tracing method can then be used to evaluate the exact property of the refracted wavefront of the lens system. We derived a series of formulas describing First Fundamental Form coefficients, Second Fundamental Form coefficients and Third Order Surface coefficients of the wavefront on propagation and on refraction. A full process of ray tracing through the lens and wavefront deformation is also derived explicitly. We also discuss the process of front lens surface design and back lens surface design. To numerically construct the progressive lens surface, tensor product B-spline functions is used to solve the optimization problem. Numerical Methods such as Gradient method, Newton's method and Quasi-Newton method are used. One numerical example of front surface design with the fixed back spherical lens surface is shown in this work. In summary, this thesis develops a model of progressive additional lens design up to second order aberration by wavefront tracing method...|$|E
