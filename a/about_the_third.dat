5|$|During {{the first}} weekend of sale, {{more than one million}} units were sold. Soon after {{the first weekend}}, Ashok Kumar, a {{technology}} analyst for a financial firm predicted that Apple would sell 35 million iPad 2s in 2011. Investment banking firm, Piper Jaffray monitored the initial sales of the iPad 2 and reported that 70% of all iPad 2 sales were to first-time iPad buyers with 49% of buyers owning a PC compared to the initial buyers of the original iPad where only 26% of buyers owned a PC. 12,000 units were sold on auction site eBay in its first two weeks of release. When the iPhone 4S was released, rumors <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>third</b> generation iPad caused a decline in iPad 2 sales. Official figures released {{in the fourth quarter of}} 2011 indicate that Apple sold 11.4 million iPads in the third quarter, a 166% increase from the third quarter of 2010.|$|E

25|$|Information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>third</b> and {{the fourth}} battalions is {{particularly}} fragmentary. The fourth battalion was commanded by Major Juozas Černius who showed more genuine enthusiasm for the German cause. In March 1944, the fourth battalion arrived to Zarasai with the second battalion. Three companies from the fourth battalion were reassigned to the 252nd Infantry Division in early 1945.|$|E

Human melatonin production decreases as a person ages. Also, as children become teenagers, the nightly schedule of melatonin release is delayed, leading to later sleeping and waking times.|$|E
25|$|Russia {{signed the}} Energy Charter Treaty in 1994, but flatly refused to ratify its current revision.

25|$|Nuclear weapons related activity, however, {{continued}} at FOA {{even after the}} dismantling was completed in 1972, but to a much lesser extent. Resources in 1972 amounted <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>third</b> of the stock in 1964-1965. Actual defense research on nuclear weapons effects continued. It did not include design research or {{any part of the}} Freedom of action doctrine. Paradoxically, that part of the nuclear research was given a low priority because “defense research” was merely a politically correct name. The remaining technical expertise in construction of nuclear weapons was later utilized in different disarmament contexts.|$|E

25|$|With {{the intense}} {{competition}} in early 1919 {{to achieve the}} first transatlantic flight, it was planned to join other teams in the race by shipping the Fury to Cape Broyle, Newfoundland. The intention being a non-stop flight, however the aircraft's size presented a problem as no vessel with a capacity large enough could be found as transport and the project was officially opposed on grounds of expense, despite the crossing being well within the Fury's capabilities; fuel capacity was 1500 gallons (6819 litres). The Air Ministry's preference to leave the non-stop achievement to a commercial venture, led to the abandonment of the attempt <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>third</b> week of May 1919, when flight tests resumed.|$|E

25|$|Following (or {{leading up}} to) the schisms, each Saṅgha started to {{accumulate}} {{their own version}} of Tripiṭaka (Pali Canons, triple basket of texts). In their Tripiṭaka, each school included the Suttas of the Buddha, a Vinaya basket (disciplinary code) and added an Abhidharma basket which were texts on detailed scholastic classification, summary and interpretation of the Suttas. The doctrine details in the Abhidharmas of various Buddhist schools differ significantly, and these were composed starting <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>third</b> century BCE and through the 1st millennium CE. Eighteen early Buddhist schools are known, each with its own Tripitaka, but only one collection from Sri Lanka has survived, in a nearly complete state, into the modern era.|$|E
25|$|Specifics <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>third</b> phase, which {{initially}} was to involve renovations to older buildings, long remained undisclosed. In November 2009, plans were made public that LACMA's director Michael Govan {{was working with}} Swiss architect and Pritzker Prize laureate Peter Zumthor on plans for rebuilding the eastern section of the campus from the two new Renzo Piano buildings to the tar pits. With an estimated cost of $650 million, his first proposal called for a horizontal building along Wilshire Boulevard. It would be wrapped in glass on all sides and its main galleries would be lifted one floor into the air. The wide roof would be covered with solar panels. In a later concession to concerns raised by its neighbor, the Page Museum, LACMA had Zumthor alter {{the shape of his}} proposed building to stretch across Wilshire Boulevard and away from the La Brea Tar Pits.|$|E
25|$|Much {{has been}} written in books about the first two of the {{preceding}} branches of the Forcade family. These genealogical texts typically focus directly or indirectly on proving their lineage from a family member in Orthez, either by drawing upon letters patent that were issued, the opinions issued by royal genealogists or from the decisions and judgments of judicial entities. Much less {{has been written}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>third</b> of the preceding branches, or about the Forcades of Orthez themselves. Whereas the first two branches were required at various times throughout history to prove their lineage from the family in Orthez, many generations or several hundred years earlier, the third branch and {{the core of the}} family, who are essentially one and the same, had little difficulty proving their lineage. During the 17th century, the third branch and the core of the family were still geographically situated in or near Orthez and Pau.|$|E

25|$|The primary-school {{curriculum}} {{consisted of}} Chinese, mathematics, physical education, music, drawing, and elementary instruction in nature, history, and geography, combined with practical work experiences {{around the school}} compound. A general knowledge of politics and moral training, which stressed love of the motherland, love of the party, and love of the people (and previously love of Chairman Mao), was {{another part of the}} curriculum. A foreign language, often English, is introduced in <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>third</b> grade. Chinese and mathematics accounted for about 60 percent of the scheduled class time; natural science and social science accounted for about 8 percent. Putonghua (common spoken language) was taught in regular schools and pinyin romanization in lower grades and kindergarten. The Ministry of Education required that all primary schools offer courses on morality and ethics. Beginning in the fourth grade, students usually had to perform productive labor two weeks per semester to relate classwork with production experience in workshops or on farms and relate it to academic study. Most schools had after-hour activities at least one day per week to involve students in recreation and community service.|$|E

500|$|In {{a special}} {{commentary}} for Hamasaki's compilation album A Ballads (2003), where a third {{version of the}} track is included, she stated that the lyrical content was written in third person perspective, a trait that is shared {{with the rest of}} the album's tracks. She stated that the song is <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>third</b> person watching a happy and loving relationship: [...] "It's about lovers who appear to be happy and are living each day in their usual way. But there is a sense that a third person is watching from a distance." [...] The song's title is loosely based on the album's title Loveppears, which was originally planned to be called [...] "Lovers Appear".|$|E
500|$|... "Appears" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by Japanese recording artist Ayumi Hamasaki. It was released by Avex Trax on November 10, 1999 as the sixth single from her second studio album Loveppears (1999), which was released on the same day. Alongside this, it has been released in several other territories with different release dates under her Western alias Ayu. It also served as Hamasaki's first limited edition single, limiting physical sales to 300,000 copies. The track was written by Hamasaki herself, while production was handled by long-time collaborator Max Matsuura. Musically, [...] "Appears" [...] is a dance song written in third person perspective, and is <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>third</b> person watching a happy and loving relationship. Upon its release, [...] "Appears" [...] received positive reviews from music critics. Alexey Eremenko, writing for AllMusic, selected the track as the best song from the album and her career.

He said that although Dan Castellaneta’s portrayal of Homer is better remembered for its evolution over time, Nancy Cartwright’s voicing of Bart changed as well, because [...] "it was lower-register, {{and you can see}} in the difference in this segment. It was really funny to get the interplay [...] and for the actors to see the voice evolution. The great thing is we didn’t have to ask—we already had the cast hired for the Tracey Ullman Simpsons." [...] He also revealed that the segment expanded on an earlier episode which implied that the Ullman Simpsons were murdered and buried under the family home, stating [...] "if people want a real Halloween bloodbath, they get it." ...|$|E
