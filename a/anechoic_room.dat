40|$|International audienceIn theory, {{active control}} {{could be used}} to reduce the {{unwanted}} noise reflections from surfaces such as a submarine hull or the walls of an <b>anechoic</b> <b>room.</b> In the recent years, a real-time algorithm has been developed to this effect at the Laboratoire de Mécanique et d'Acoustique: the noise scattered by the surface is estimated through linear filtering of acoustic pressure signals provided by ordinary microphones and an adaptive feedforward algorithm minimizes the resulting error signals. The paper summarizes the theory underlying the control algorithm, which stems from the integral representation of the scattered pressure, and presents the successive experiments which have been conducted with it: control of terminal reflections in a duct, control of the noise scattered by a parallelepiped in an <b>anechoic</b> <b>room,</b> estimation of the noise reflections on the walls of a small room.

Numerical simulations of reproduction frameworks are performed for acoustic monopoles as reproduction sources, distributed on a plane facing a virtual panel to be tested.

Disseminating the unit in reverberant fields requires the measurement of a volume average whereas in hemi-anechoic fields, measurements on an enveloping surface are appropriate. For the latter situation, automatic sound field scanning mechanisms were developed by LNE, SP and PTB. At PTP, an arc with 24 microphones is used which can be tilted to cover a hemispherical measurement surface. Different radii can be realised by manual adjustment of the microphones. At SP, a single microphone is moved on a semi-circular arc. Different latitudes can be realised by manual arrangements. LNE developed a scanning mechanism consisting of a hemi-circular arc. A microphone can be positioned on arbitrary altitude positions on the arc and the arc can move on a circular path. This way, arbitrary positions on a hemispherical measurement surface can be realised.

40|$|At present, {{airborne}} sound {{power is not}} a directly measurable quantity. It is calculated from sound pressure measurements performed in special environments, e. g. free or diffuse fields or from sound intensity measurements using 2 -microphone probes. All the different methods are lacking traceability and transparent uncertainty budgets. These deficiencies are finally based {{on the lack of}} a primary standard for sound power as the metrological basis. In the joint research project funded by the European Metrology Research Program, primary sound power standards were established on the base of the Rayleigh Integral Method where the sound power is calculated from measured velocities on a baffled vibrating body. Different reference sound power sources were designed in different Institutes. The construction of the primary sources was mainly focused on the piston; its material, shape and friction during its movement. Primary sound power sources were installed in hemi anechoic and reverberant environments, and characterisation measurements were performed to see the effect of different environments on the sound power output. Comparison measurements were performed to compare the new and present methods for the primary sound power source. © 2016, German Acoustical Society (DEGA). All rights reserved.

Using the same measurement equipment, different (system) calibration methods are compared: 1] free-field measurement in an <b>anechoic</b> <b>room,</b> 2] sound intensity measurement in an <b>anechoic</b> <b>room,</b> 3] diffuse-field measurement in a reverberation room, 4] near-field measurement on stage in a concert hall. For method 1, measurements have been performed in a horizontal plane with white noise and exponential sweeps at various distances from the sound source. For method 2, intensity measurements according to ISO 9614 - 3 have been performed using white noise while scanning the sound source surface with a two microphone probe. For method 3, the direct method and the comparison method according to the ISO 3741 standard {{have been used to}} determine the sound power level using white noise. Also, a system calibration has been performed in the <b>anechoic</b> <b>room</b> and the reverberation room using exponential sweeps. Finally, for method 4, a convenient near-field measurement method at a distance of 1 m has been performed on the stages of a large and a small concert hall using white noise and exponential sweeps. It has been found that the intensity and the diffuse-field calibration methods give substantially equal results. The horizontal-rotation free-field calibration method gives results that differ significantly from those of the diffuse-field and intensity methods. For a survey G measurement in a concert hall it is sufficient to perform an on-site calibration...|$|E
40|$|The human ear can {{recognize}} {{the difference between}} the sound of two singers. The aim of my thesis is to find out whether the differences can also be measured. We analyzed what is the sound spectrum of the two singers and investigated if both were able to repeat the same tone with the same color. We were also interested in the angular distribution of the sound intensity of the two singers. For a better interpretation of the results, we measured the dependence of the intensity on the distance. All experiments were performed in three different rooms, in an ordinary room, in an <b>anechoic</b> <b>room</b> and outdoors. We found out that the schooled singer was able to repeatedly reproduce the same tone with the same color while the results for the unscooled singer revealed major deviations. Comparing the angular distribution of the sound intensity of the two singers we observed some differences but were not able to draw any definite conclusion. Indoors, we observed a very large impact of the room on the results of our measurements. Outdoors, the angular distribution of the sound {{turned out to be more}} similar to the theoretical values compared to the results obtained in the ordinary or <b>anechoic</b> <b>room.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|Investigations of a foam {{glass-ceramic}} material synthesized from raw {{siliceous earth}} material by the two-stage method at temperatures below 950 °С {{have demonstrated the}} improvement of its physic mechanical properties in comparison with foam glass synthesized from glass cullet. This material actively interacts with microwaves {{and can be used}} for the development of protective screens reducing the adverse effect of microwaves on biological objects, <b>anechoic</b> chambers, and <b>rooms</b> with low level of electromagnetic background noise. Spectra of the transmission and absorption coefficients and of the complex dielectric permittivity for frequencies in the range 26 - 260 GHz are presented. The observed effects demonstrate the existence of regions with partial and total reflection arising on the glass-pore boundary and of the microwave interaction with ultradisperse carbon particles that remain after foaming with incomplete frothier transition from the soot to the gas phase...|$|R
40|$|This work tackles the {{difficulties}} that appear with measuring- and analysis techniques for industrial centrifugal fans. In the made study we've tried to achieve data of a centrifugal fan {{in order to find}} a characterising fingerprint of the fan itself. Simply looking to the spectral information seems not to offer a detailed view of the underlying phenomenons. This due to several reasons: like the enormous impact of the generated wind and the limits of the techniques themselves. We've analysed the fan using soundpressure techniques and intensity techniques in <b>anechoic</b> and reverberant <b>rooms</b> respectively. We believe that a fingerprint requires at least both time and frequency information even if fan noise is considered stationary. The made measurements are analysed using wavelet analysis which offers a broader platform to characterise different relations between the mechanical construct and the noise. This by looking to self similarities, discontinuities, pure tones and short term evolution of the noise...|$|R
40|$|Although {{the speech}} {{transmission}} index (STI) is a well-accepted and standardized method for objective prediction of speech intelligibility {{in a wide}} range of-environments and applications, it is essentially a monaural model. Advantages of binaural hearing to the intelligibility of speech are disregarded. In specific conditions mis leads to considerable mismatches between subjective intelligibility and the STI. A binaural version of the SIT was developed, based on interaural cross correlograms, which shows a considerably improved correspondence with subjective intelligibility in dichotic listening conditions. The new binaural STI is designed to be a relatively simple model which adds only few parameters to the original standardized STI, and changes none of the existing model parameters. For monaural conditions, the outcome is identical to the standardized STI. The new model was validated on set of 39 dichotic listening conditions, featuring <b>anechoic,</b> classroom, listening <b>room,</b> and cathedral environments. For these 39 conditions, subjective intelligibility (CVC-wordscore) was measured, as well as the binaural STI. The relation between binaural STI and CVC-wordscores in dichotic listening conditions closely matches the STI reference curve (standardized relation between STI and CVC-wordscore) for monaural listening. The monaural STI performs poorly in these cases...|$|R
