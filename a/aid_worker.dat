40|$|A {{questionnaire}} {{study was}} conducted to investigate the psychological adjustment of people who had been <b>aid</b> <b>workers</b> overseas. Nearly fifty percent of the sample of returned <b>aid</b> <b>workers</b> (n = 145) reported that they had experienced psychological difficulties while they were overseas or following their return to Britain. Most had not received any treatment for their difficulties. People who reported psychological problems had, on average, spent longer as <b>aid</b> <b>workers</b> than those who reported no psychological problems. Compared with a group of people preparing for their first term as overseas <b>aid</b> <b>workers</b> (n = 43), returned <b>aid</b> <b>workers</b> had significantly higher mean scores on measures assessing depression, intrusive thoughts, and, among women, avoidance. <b>Aid</b> <b>workers</b> who invalidated their feelings appeared to be especially vulnerable to developing psychological difficulties. When compared with people who did not intend to become <b>aid</b> <b>workers</b> (n = 71), returned <b>aid</b> <b>workers</b> and people preparing to become <b>aid</b> <b>workers</b> were found to perceive the world as a more benevolent and meaningful place. However, a small proportion of returned <b>aid</b> <b>workers</b> expressed views that the world was malevolent and meaningless; such views were related to the development of psychological problems. This finding was discussed with relation to Janoff-Bulman's (1992) theory of shattered assumptions. Implications of the findings were considered, including implications for the selection, preparation and treatment of <b>aid</b> <b>workers...</b>|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} how humanitarian <b>aid</b> <b>workers</b> were attracted, motivated, recruited, {{and prepared}} for fieldwork, and how they reported their work experience directly {{from the field and}} when they returned home. Data were derived from interviews with experienced <b>aid</b> <b>workers,</b> focus group discussions with presumptive <b>aid</b> <b>workers,</b> analysis of letters from <b>aid</b> <b>workers</b> in the field on MSFs homepages in Europe, and from interviews with recruitment officers at some of the main humanitarian organisations. Health professionals were attracted by the positive images of humanitarian action. They wished to work in teams with like-minded people, and {{to make a difference in}} the world. However, this image was not supported by the recruitment officers, or experienced <b>aid</b> <b>workers,</b> who described a complex reality in humanitarian action. The experienced <b>aid</b> <b>workers</b> instead had realised they learned more than they contributed. The recruitment system for relief workers would benefit from a more holistic approach, where personalities of the <b>aid</b> <b>workers</b> are more in focus. More time must be spent with the applicants, both recruited and returning <b>aid</b> <b>workers,</b> in order to improve the system. A socialisation approach could help identify the right personnel and to motivate current personnel to continue...|$|R

Based on fieldwork conducted in Eastern Cameroon and Geneva, Switzerland, this thesis argues that local humanitarian <b>aid</b> <b>workers</b> are a vital bridge between international aid organizations and refugee populations and that a more in-depth examination of local <b>aid</b> <b>workers</b> can illuminate the broader framework of humanitarian aid. By using life narratives, I identify how local <b>aid</b> <b>workers</b> envision their own strengths and challenges, gaining an important insight into an often forgotten, yet integral, component of humanitarian aid and refugee relief...|$|R
30|$|<b>Aid</b> <b>workers</b> {{undertake}} valuable {{work and}} include professionals working on humanitarian missions in conflicts and disasters, and those engaged in development cooperation aimed at long-term economic, environmental, {{social and political}} improvements in developing countries (Alonso and Glennie 2015). Aid work is associated {{with high levels of}} stress which are well documented in prior quantitative studies using validated scales (e.g. Holtz et al. 2002) and frequency ratings of pre-selected stressors (e.g. Ager et al. 2012). Existing research provides an indication of stress prevalence but does not fully capture aid workers’ personal views and {{little is known about the}} ways in which <b>aid</b> <b>workers</b> themselves experience stress and actively cope on the job. In addition, international humanitarian workers have been widely studied at the expense of development professionals and national <b>aid</b> <b>workers.</b> This is problematic as these groups represent a large portion of <b>aid</b> <b>workers.</b> For example, national workers account for as much as 90 % of all <b>aid</b> <b>workers</b> (Stoddard et al. 2009). Before effective interventions can be designed to help <b>aid</b> <b>workers,</b> we first need to understand the lived experiences of all types of <b>aid</b> <b>workers.</b>|$|R

30|$|The first {{research}} {{question for the}} quantitative study was “What types of humanitarian organizations provide cultural awareness training for <b>aid</b> <b>workers</b> focusing on the minority Yezidi culture?” It was predicted that international humanitarian organizations may provide basic cultural awareness training for <b>aid</b> <b>workers</b> but not concerning the minority Yezidi culture, {{as well as local}} NGO humanitarian programs although may have knowledge of Yezidi culture, do not implement cultural awareness training for the <b>aid</b> <b>workers.</b> The data collection and analysis partially supported the hypothesis of the first {{research question}} showing that neither international nor local humanitarian organizations provided cultural awareness training for <b>aid</b> <b>workers</b> concerning the minority Yezidi culture. As predicted, despite the lack of cultural awareness training, local <b>aid</b> <b>workers</b> did have some knowledge of Yezidi culture, which is analyzed below.|$|R
30|$|The Open Letter also {{mentioned}} that <b>aid</b> <b>workers</b> such as David Haines {{are supposed to}} {{fall under the category}} of emissaries as well. Can <b>aid</b> <b>workers</b> from NGOs can count as “emissaries” which deserve special immunity alike diplomatic representatives? This will require some extra explanation, which certainly deserves to be mentioned. Instead, the Open Letter once again resorted to very loose definitions of <b>aid</b> <b>workers</b> as “… emissaries of mercy and kindness…”.|$|R
30|$|A key finding {{which emerged}} across {{multiple}} themes was the importance <b>aid</b> <b>workers</b> placed on meaningful work, and the stress caused by frustrated attempts {{to work in}} line with their personal values. This aligns with previous research suggesting that meaningful action is important for <b>aid</b> <b>workers</b> (McKay 2011) who are commonly motivated {{by the promise of}} meaningful work (Ager and Iacovou 2014). However, qualitative field accounts have noted that many <b>aid</b> <b>workers</b> become disillusioned and cynical (Pigni 2014). This is problematic as an underlying cause of burnout is an unfulfilled wish to feel one’s actions are meaningful (Pines and Keinan 2005). While some staff guidelines note the importance of meaning to <b>aid</b> <b>workers</b> (McKay 2011), there is no published research on the links between meaning and mental health outcomes such as stress. The current results suggest meaning is of central importance to <b>aid</b> <b>workers</b> and this area warrants further research.|$|R

She {{was taken from the}} South Darfurian village of Abu Ajura, along with two Sudanese colleagues who were also freed after a week. The governor of South Darfur, Abdel Hamid Kasha, Sudan foreign ministry spokesman Moawiya Osman and Samaritan's Purse’s leader Franklin Graham, and the Russian ambassador to Chad welcomed Flavia’s release, but condemned the kidnap of the three Russians and that of two Jordanian UNAMID police advisers in Darfur, on the 14th.

30|$|The {{current results}} can also inform {{the types of}} support that aid organisations provide staff. For example, many aid organisations only provide support for <b>aid</b> <b>workers</b> {{who have had a}} {{traumatic}} experience (Ehrenreich and Elliott 2004), while the current research indicates that work and psychological stressors are more prevalent. Thus, organisations should provide psychological support and training for <b>aid</b> <b>workers</b> even if they have not experienced a recent trauma. Given that social support was the most prevalent coping strategy, organisations could also do more to help <b>aid</b> <b>workers</b> maintain their support network. This could involve facilitating frequent home visits, supporting the families of <b>aid</b> <b>workers,</b> encouraging social support among colleagues and improving communication channels in remote placements.|$|R
30|$|Within {{the wider}} aid sector, there are {{existing}} staff care materials (e.g. McKay 2007) but no empirically tested psychological interventions {{tailored to the}} needs of <b>aid</b> <b>workers.</b> Future development of such interventions could incorporate the current results by focusing on psychological flexibility skills that are effectively taught through approaches such as ACT (Hayes et al. 2006). Ideally, this type of training will be delivered across the sector (possibly by staff care organisations) to reach a wide range of <b>aid</b> <b>workers</b> and help mitigate problems of inconsistent organisational support. Sector-wide support for <b>aid</b> <b>workers</b> is important given that there is currently little support for <b>aid</b> <b>workers</b> who face a large variety of stressors.|$|R
25|$|On {{a two-day}} visit in Afghanistan in early January 2007, MacKay {{mentioned}} {{that there was}} an optimistic future in the country despite the Taliban resistance and violence.

He also announced funding for both <b>aid</b> <b>worker</b> groups and for developing security in Afghanistan, including developing the police force. He added another $200 million in aid on February 26, 2007, for the reconstruction.

As part of the agreement, <b>aid</b> <b>worker</b> Alan Gross and an unnamed Cuban national working as a U.S intelligence asset were released by the Cuban government, which also promised to free an unspecified number of Cuban nationals from a list of political prisoners earlier submitted by the United States. For its part, the U.S. government released the last three remaining members of the Cuban Five. Reaction to this change in policy within the Cuban-American community was mixed, and Cuban-American senators Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Marco Rubio (R-FL), and Ted Cruz (R-TX) all condemned the Obama administration's change in policy. However, opinion polls indicated the thaw in relations was broadly popular with the American public.|$|E
