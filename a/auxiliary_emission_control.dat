40|$|This paper {{examines}} how regional inequalities {{are affected by}} <b>emission</b> <b>controls</b> via credit trading and availability of absorption sources. We assume that homogeneous goods are costly traded without <b>emission</b> <b>controls</b> and that the rural areas have an advantage {{in terms of the}} availability of absorption sources. We especially focus on the long-term effects of firm relocation. Our two key findings are as follows. First, in the case where an <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> scheme is implemented without allowing for offsetting emissions with carbon absorption sources (carbon sinks), strengthening the <b>emission</b> <b>controls</b> drives firms to relocate from rural areas to urban areas, in the case that wage levels remain unchanged in both areas. As a result, regional inequalities in terms of both the number of firms and relative public welfare are enlarged by <b>emission</b> <b>controls.</b> Our second finding shows that in the case in which the <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> scheme allows for emissions-absorption offsetting, strengthening <b>emission</b> <b>controls</b> has mixed effects on the relative welfare of rural areas. Numerical simulations show that when the costs associated with transporting differentiated goods are relatively low, the introduction of <b>emission</b> <b>controls</b> with an offsetting system results in greater inequality across regions compared with introducing emissio...|$|R
40|$|The Advanced Petroleum-Based Fuels-Diesel <b>Emissions</b> <b>Control</b> Program (APBF-DEC) {{began in}} February 2000 and is {{supported}} by government agencies and industry. The purpose of the APBF-DEC program is to identify and evaluate the optimal combinations of fuels, lubricants, diesel engines, and <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> systems to meet the projected emission standards for the 2000 to 2010 time period. APBF-DEC is {{an outgrowth of the}} earlier Diesel Emission Control-Sulfur Effects Program (DECSE), whose objective is to determine the impact of the sulfur levels in fuel on <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> systems that could lower the emissions of NOx and particulate matter (PM) from diesel powered vehicles in the 2002 to 2004 period. Results from the DECSE studies of two <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> technologies-diesel particle filter (DPF) and NOx adsorber-will be used in the APBF-DEC program.

40|$|The {{substantial}} {{reductions in}} motor vehicle emissions {{that have occurred}} since the late 1960 s have been accompanied by continuous increases in vehicle <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> costs, and cost increases or decreases due to changes in vehicle performance such as driveability, power, fuel economy, and vehicle maintenance. In this paper, a systematic approach has been developed to estimate <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> costs for motor vehicles. The approach accounts for all <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> parts installed on vehicles, {{and the costs of}} these emission parts are estimated through their prices. This paper does not estimate costs of the changes in vehicle performance and maintenance caused by <b>emission</b> <b>control.</b> Using information on <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> parts and their prices for new light-duty vehicles sold in California in 1990, per-vehicle control costs and total control costs for all new light-duty vehicles have been estimated. The cost to vehicle manufacturers per vehicle for <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> ranges from $ 220 to $ 1, 460, depending on vehicle size and manufacturer. The sales-weighted average cost to manufacturers is $ 445 per vehicle. The total cost of <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> technology for 1990 light-duty vehicles sold in California is estimated to be about $ 698 million. The corresponding cost to consumers per vehicle for <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> ranges from $ 370 to $ 2, 430, with a sales-weighted average of $ 748. The total cost for <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> of 1990 light-duty vehicles sold in California is about $ 1. 2 billion to consumers. Per-vehicle costs for vehicles sold elsewhere in the U. S. in 1990 are similar since emission standards were similar that year...|$|R

40|$|Estimation of <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> cost {{functions}} {{is often}} {{carried out in}} a partial equilibrium framework, i. e., {{under the assumption that}} <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> measures have negligible effects on input and output prices. In this paper a computable general equilibrium model is used for simulation of the impact on factor prices and resource allocation of reductions of SO infx sup-, NO infx su- and CO 2 -emissions. Thus the model includes markets for tradable emission permits, and the equilibrium prices of permits reflect the marginal costs of <b>emission</b> <b>control.</b> The results suggest that major emission reductions are likely to have general equilibrium effects, and thus that <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> cost functions that fail to take these effects into account may give a distorted picture of the economic impact of <b>emission</b> <b>control.</b> Copyright Kluwer Academic Publishers 1991 Carbon taxation, environmental control cost function, computable general equilibrium,...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> {{measures}} were undertaken in Beijing and the adjacent provinces in China during the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games on 8 – 24 August 2008. This provides {{a unique opportunity}} for investigating the effectiveness of <b>emission</b> <b>controls</b> on air pollution in Beijing. We {{conducted a series of}} numerical experiments over East Asia for the period of July to September 2008 using a coupled meteorology-chemistry model (WRF-Chem). Model can generally reproduce the observed variation of aerosol concentrations. Consistent with observations, modeled concentrations of aerosol species (sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, black carbon, organic carbon, total particulate matter) in Beijing were decreased by 30 – 50 % during the Olympic period compared to the other periods in July and August in 2008 and the same period in 2007. Model results indicate that <b>emission</b> <b>controls</b> were effective in reducing the aerosol concentrations by comparing simulations with and without <b>emission</b> <b>controls.</b> However, our analysis suggests that meteorological conditions (e. g., wind direction and precipitation) are at least as important as <b>emission</b> <b>controls</b> in producing the low aerosol concentrations appearing during the Olympic period. Transport from the regions surrounding Beijing determines the temporal variation of aerosol concentrations in Beijing. Based on the budget analysis, we suggest that to improve the air quality over Beijing, <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> strategy should focus on the regional scale instead of the local scale...|$|R
