5|$|Between 1800 and 1992, {{at least}} 37 {{instances}} of Sallekhana are recorded in Jain literature. There were 260 and 90 recorded Sallekhana deaths among Svetambara and Digambara Jains respectively between 1993 and 2003. According to Jitendra Shah, the Director of L D Institute of Indology in Ahmedabad, {{an average of}} about 240 Jains practice Sallekhana each year in India. Most of them are not recorded or noticed. Statistically, Sallekhana is undertaken both by men <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>of</b> all economic classes and among the educationally forward Jains. It is observed more often by women than men.|$|E

5|$|This {{decision}} {{may cause}} regret in some men <b>and</b> <b>women.</b> <b>Of</b> women aged over 30 who have undergone tubal ligation, about 5% regret their decision, {{as compared with}} 20% of women aged under 30. By contrast, less than 5% of men are likely to regret sterilization. Men more likely to regret sterilization are younger, have young or no children, or have an unstable marriage.

5|$|Anti-vivisectionists {{commissioned}} a bronze {{statue of the}} dog as a memorial, unveiled on the Latchmere Recreation Ground in Battersea in 1906, but medical students were angered by its provocative plaque—"Men <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>of</b> England, how long shall these Things be?"—leading to frequent vandalism of the memorial {{and the need for}} a 24-hour police guard against the so-called anti-doggers. On 10 December 1907, 1,000 medical students marched through central London waving effigies of the brown dog on sticks, clashing with suffragettes, trade unionists and 400 police officers, {{one of a series of}} battles known as the Brown Dog riots.|$|E
5|$|Contrasting Bogaert's 1% figure, a {{study by}} Aicken et al., {{published}} in 2013, suggests that, based on Natsal-2 data from 2000-2001, the prevalence of asexuality in Britain is only 0.4% for people {{between the ages of}} 16-44. This percentage indicates a decrease from the 0.9% figure determined from the Natsal-1 data collected on the same age-range a decade earlier. A 2015 analysis by Bogaert also found a similar decline between the Natsal-1 and Natsal-2 data. Aicken, Mercer, and Cassell found some evidence of ethnic differences among respondents who had not experienced sexual attraction; both men <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>of</b> Indian and Pakistani origin had a higher likelihood of reporting a lack of sexual attraction. Muslims {{were also more likely to}} report this lack of attraction than respondents from Christian religions.|$|E
5|$|In {{his address}} to the state {{legislature}} in January 1898, Bradley advocated {{the repeal of the}} state's Separate Coach Law, which provided separate streetcars for whites and blacks. He appointed substantial numbers of blacks to patronage positions in government beyond the janitorial jobs they usually received. He named Edward E. Underwood as the first black person on the board of trustees for Kentucky State College (later the University of Kentucky). Because of his devotion to black advancement, Bradley was the only white person included in William Decker Johnson's 1897 compilation Biographical Sketches of Prominent Negro Men <b>and</b> <b>Women</b> <b>of</b> Kentucky.|$|E

5|$|The Royalist {{commander}} Prince Maurice conscripted {{the adult}} men <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>of</b> Worcester {{to work on}} the walls, threatening the death penalty if they did not attend. To form these new defences, the buildings outside the old city walls were cleared and six large bastions were attached to them along the north and east sides of the city, while a sconce, Fort Royal Hill was built outside Sidbury Gate in the south, linked to the walls by a walkway. The ditch protecting the new earthworks was relatively shallow at about eight feet (2.4 m) deep, but when combined with the high ramparts of the bastions, which were probably protected by sharpened stakes and a banquette firing platform, the bastions would have been well defended. During the short unsuccessfully siege 1643 and the long successful siege of 1646 the reinforced defences were able to withstand the artillery bombardments – the surrender in 1646 was mainly the result of a shortage of food and the collapse of the wider Royalist position across the south-west of England.|$|E
5|$|The ancient Egyptians {{placed a}} great value on hygiene and appearance. Most {{bathed in the}} Nile and used a pasty soap made from animal fat and chalk. Men shaved their entire bodies for cleanliness; {{perfumes}} and aromatic ointments covered bad odors and soothed skin. Clothing was made from simple linen sheets that were bleached white, and both men <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>of</b> the upper classes wore wigs, jewelry, and cosmetics. Children went without clothing until maturity, at about age 12, and at this age males were circumcised and had their heads shaved. Mothers were responsible {{for taking care of}} the children, while the father provided the family's income.|$|E
5|$|The {{demobilisation}} {{plan was}} put into action on 16August 1945, the day after Japan surrendered. At this time the military had a strength of 598,300 men <b>and</b> <b>women.</b> <b>Of</b> these, 310,600 were in Australia, 224,000 were serving in the South West Pacific Area (SWPA) and 20,100 were in Britain {{and other parts of}} the world. The only personnel to be discharged during August and September were former prisoners of war and those with a long period of service, however, as general demobilisation did not begin until 1October 1945. During the intervening months dispersal centres were established in each state and territory's capital city. These centres were to provide information on employment, land settlement, housing, training, loans, tools for trades and other benefits for service personnel as their discharges were processed. Lieutenant-General Stanley Savige was appointed the Coordinator of Demobilisation and Dispersal in September.|$|E

5|$|The Spanish {{government}} {{believed that}} security would {{come with a}} larger population, {{but was unable to}} attract colonists from Spain or from other New World colonies. By the late 18th century, Texas was one of the least populated regions of New Spain, with fewer than two inhabitants per square league. The population was relatively stagnant, having grown only to 3,169individuals in 1790 from 3,103 in 1777. Over half of the population was classified as Spaniards, with settled Indians making up the next largest category. Blacks, mostly slaves, made up less than 1% of the population in 1777, and only 2.2% of the 1793 census. Over two-thirds of the adults in Texas were married, and single men outnumbered single women, although there was a high percentage of widows. Intermarriage was fairly common, mostly between white men <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>of</b> mixed origin. Children from these unions often passed as whites. Illegitimate births increased steadily throughout the century, reaching 20% of all births in 1799. Despite the small population, however, Spain actively discouraged immigration to Texas, and a permanent garrison was placed in Nacogdoches in 1790 to keep foreigners from settling in the area. Immigrants from the United States were allowed to settle in Louisiana and Florida after taking an oath of allegiance, but were not required to convert to Roman Catholicism.|$|E
