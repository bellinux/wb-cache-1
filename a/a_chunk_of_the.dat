25|$|During this interregnum, 1836–1848, Americans {{nonetheless}} {{continued to}} settle the region. As early as the mid-1840s, alongside long extant Hispanic settlements such as the Rancho de Juan María Ponce de León, Anglo settlers such as Simeon Hart and Hugh Stephenson had established thriving communities of American settlers owing allegiance to Texas. Stephenson, who had married into the local Hispanic aristocracy, established the Rancho de San José de la Concordia, which became the nucleus of Anglo and Hispanic settlement {{within the limits of}} modern-day El Paso, in 1844. Given the reclamations of the Texas Republic that wanted <b>a</b> <b>chunk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Santa Fe trade, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo effectively made the settlements on the north bank of the river a formal American settlement, separate from Old El Paso del Norte on the Mexican side. The present Texas–New Mexico boundary placing El Paso on the Texas side was drawn in the Compromise of 1850.|$|E
25|$|Redknapp {{proceeded}} to spend <b>a</b> <b>chunk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transfer {{money on a}} string of coolly received signings (in addition {{he was given a}} £300,000 bonus for agreeing not to spend the entire transfer sum and arranging the transfer to Leeds), forcing what was {{to be the end of}} his time at the club. Redknapp signed the Liverpool pairing of Rigobert Song (a solid, if erratic and unsuited to the physical Premiership, player with over 60 caps to his name for £2.6million) and Titi Camara (an exciting attacking player who arrived massively overweight, unfit and devoid of form after being forced out of the Liverpool first team for £2.2million), along with Scottish international Christian Dailly (who had never lived up to his great early promise for £1.75million), for a total of some £8million (including fees and final cost adjustments). These transfers were later used as ammunition against the departing Redknapp, with aspersions cast regarding agent fees and the expensive nature of Camara's alleged Pay-As-You-Play contract that would have seen further monies paid after a relatively small number of games. His only solid moves from a fan's point of view, the loan signings of Hannu Tihinen from Viking FK and Svetoslav Todorov, did little to improve the paucity in quality of the first team. The team's fortunes improved imperceptibly, but survival was ensured thanks to the poor performances of lower sides and the team finished in 15th place, comfortably out of the relegation zone.|$|E

On the day of the election, Greg Giroux of Congressional Quarterly noted: [...] "I'd be surprised if Harris got more than 20 or 25 percent.

2500|$|Bell was {{the highest}} paid Padres player in 2011 at $7.5 million salary and would be {{eligible}} for free agency {{at the end of the}} season. He converted his first seven save opportunities of 2011, which tied him with Hoffman for the Padres club record of 41 consecutive successful save conversions. The streak also tied him with Hoffman and Rod Beck for the then-fourth longest in MLB history. Bell blew his next save opportunity, a 3–0 lead, after he opened the ninth inning walking the first two batters, and third baseman Chase Headley made a two-out, two-run throwing error to tie the game. On May 14, Bell recorded his 100th career save in a 9–7 win over the Colorado Rockies. Bell was selected to his third consecutive All-Star game. Entering the game in the eight inning, Bell sprinted from the bullpen and did a slide in front of the pitcher's mound, taking out <b>a</b> <b>chunk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> infield grass and leaving grass stains on his pants. [...] "I wanted the fans to have fun with this", said Bell. With the team 12 games under [...]500 coming out of the All-Star break, general manager Jed Hoyer said the Padres would pursue a long-term contract with Bell if they did not get a desirable trade offer for him. Ultimately Bell was not traded at the non-waiver trade deadline on July 31, but Hoyer admitted Bell's greatest value to the team might come as a free agent if Bell refuses salary arbitration and signs elsewhere—the Padres would receive two first-round draft picks in June 2012 as compensation. Bell said he planned to accept arbitration from the Padres if they did not agree on a multi-year deal. He finished the season 43 of 48 in save opportunities with a 2.44ERA, but he struck out less than 30percent of all opponents’ at-bats for the first time as a Padre.|$|E
