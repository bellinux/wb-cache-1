After {{fighting}} for an idea all your life I realize that your backing has saved it for me and meant to thank you with all my heart and soul for what you have done. It has been marvelous. So many letters have been written and not mailed and owing to having been in bed {{a great deal of time}} this summer, the paintings were <b>about</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> could muster up enough energy to do what I considered the best of my ability. Just before Stieglitz’s death I took some paintings to him that I considered as having something new in the. He immediately walked right up to them and spoke of the new ideas. His intuition in that way was remarkable and I am so glad to have been allowed to live during his and your lifetimes. It has been a great privilege for which I am truly thankful.|$|E

How am I {{supposed}} to discuss Once's two-hour finale -- an epic, fantastical take on Back to the Future complete with far-off places, daring sword fights, magic spells, and a princess in disguise -- when all I can talk <b>about,</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> can think about, is that final shot, which may just be the most surprising {{moment in the history}} of OUAT?" ...|$|E
60|$|LIZA. I don't {{want to hear}} {{anything}} more <b>about</b> that. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> {{want to know is}} whether anything belongs to me. My own clothes were burnt.|$|R

6000|$|... "You {{have been}} {{standing}} <b>about</b> <b>all</b> day. <b>I</b> heard {{you ask for}} a place without any walking, and where as few people as possible could see you miss your birds." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh! don't go away. Nobody will disturb us, and I do so {{want to know}} <b>about</b> you <b>all.</b> <b>I</b> had no notion, nor mamma either, {{that you}} were living here, or---' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Will {{you have}} some breakfast?' I said. 'You must be hungry, {{rambling}} <b>about</b> <b>all</b> night!' <b>I</b> wanted to discover where he had been, but I {{did not like to}} ask directly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Alton gravely. [...] "He did, but he tacked {{a kind of}} {{condition}} on to it, and--well, that's <b>about</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> {{can tell}} you, Charley." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, that's <b>about</b> <b>all.</b> <b>I</b> {{thought you}} {{would like to know what}} they were doing,--particularly Mr. Kenneby. I do hear that they mean to be uncommonly hard upon him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh yes, I know her,' said Maude. 'She {{asked me}} {{questions}} <b>about</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> did, {{and she did}} bother mamma so about a maid she recommended that we {{are never going to}} take another from her.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "O yes, yes; I do {{not know}} how we {{acquired}} it, but that I am sure we had, and it made us shrink from asking any questions, or even from talking to each other <b>about</b> it. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> knew I heard from Beatrice. Did Uncle Geoffrey tell you this?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That was <b>about</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> {{found at}} the haunted house that was important," [...] said Tom after the message had gone. [...] "But I've found out {{something}} here {{that may lead to}} something else of value." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Some'ow or other, {{that made}} the Sergeant froth at the mouth. 'E 'ad no more play to his intellects than a spit-kid. 'E just took {{everything}} as it come. Well, that was <b>about</b> <b>all,</b> <b>I</b> think.... Unless you'd care to have me resume my narrative." ...|$|E
