60|$|With {{his coming}} hope returned. Calmly yet skillfully {{he went to}} the aid of the sufferer, while father, Jessie <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> agonized {{suspense}} awaiting his report.|$|E
6000|$|I sent Andrea, the steward's nephew, to {{see what}} was {{happening}} in the town, and Pietro <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> the large window talking in undertones. Suddenly Pietro stopped and said,-- ...|$|E
60|$|The {{small change}} was made, we stepped on board, and the ropes were cast off. Jones, Holmes, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> the stern. There was one {{man at the}} rudder, one to tend the engines, and two burly police-inspectors forward.|$|E
60|$|It {{was late}} in the {{afternoon}} of the next day when Harry <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> figuring <b>in</b> our shanty, while Johnston lay on a heap of cedar twigs sucking at his pipe and encouraging us languidly.|$|R
60|$|I {{was shown}} {{into the room}} I already knew so well, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>in</b> Giulia's chair. I rested {{my head on the}} {{cushions}} which had pressed against her beautiful hair, her cheek; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> inhaled the fragrance which they had left behind them.|$|R
60|$|For {{two hours}} <b>and</b> more <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> the shrubbery, conversing in whispers with Michelot, and {{watching}} {{the lights in the}} ch√¢teau die out one by one, until St. Auban's window, which opened on to the terrace balcony, {{was the only one that}} was not wrapt in darkness.|$|R
6000|$|... "Anyhow, {{it was a}} road <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> a wagon," [...] Carrie rejoined. [...] "When {{the road}} stopped and we hit the real wild country, I got frightened, like a child. What use is there in {{starting}} out, if you can't go on?" ...|$|E
60|$|Well, on this night, broke, thirsty, {{but with}} the drinker's faith in the {{unexpected}} drink, Nelson <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> the Overland House {{waiting for something to}} turn up, especially politicians. And there entered Joe Goose--he of the unquenchable thirst, the wicked eyes, the crooked nose, the flowered vest.|$|E
60|$|WHEN {{my young}} lady has grown great and staid, And in long raiment wondrously arrayed, She may take {{pleasure}} {{with a smile}} to know How she delighted men-folk long ago. For her long after, then, this tale I tell Of the two fans and fairy Rosabelle. Hot was the day; her weary sire <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>Sat</b> <b>in</b> our chairs companionably nigh, Each with a headache sat her sire and I.|$|E
6000|$|I {{raised my}} hand. Mr. Marx whispered, [...] "Now!" [...] And the bouquet was lying at her feet. She {{picked it up}} gracefully, shot a coquettish glance up towards me, and then the curtain fell, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> back <b>in</b> my chair, feeling quite {{convinced}} that I had made an utter fool of myself.|$|R
60|$|He {{came again}} and again to see me, always with a new roll of {{manuscript}} in his ulster. Now it was The Men in the Storm, now a bunch of The Black Riders, curious poems, which he afterwards dedicated to me, and while my brother browned a steak, Steve <b>and</b> <b>I</b> usually <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> council over his dark future.|$|R
5000|$|Robert Forster later said, [...] "When Grant <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> around <b>in</b> 1978 {{thinking}} about the things we'd get from being in a rock band, a bridge wasn't one of them. It's not the actual bridge that's so astonishing, it's driving down roads that have those big signs like Ipswich, Gold Coast, and seeing Go Between Bridge. But really nice ... and a bridge is a beautiful thing. It's nicer than a Go-Between sewage works." ...|$|R
6000|$|The next day, being Sunday, we all {{gathered}} in the little church to hear Mr. Mason preach. Nick <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> the high box pew of the family with Mrs. Temple, who paid not the least attention to the sermon. As for me, the rhythm of it held me in fascination. Mr. Mason had written it out and that afternoon read over this part of it to Nick. The quotation I recall, having since read it many times, and the gist of {{it was in this}} wise:-- ...|$|E
60|$|Evening. When I came to Wilson's, I {{was shown}} up, {{and found that}} he was sitting with Miss Penclosa. For half an hour I had to endure his fussy talk about his recent {{research}} into the exact nature of the spiritualistic rap, while the creature <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> silence looking across the room at each other. I read a sinister amusement in her eyes, and she must have seen hatred and menace in mine. I had almost despaired of having speech with her when he was called from the room, and we were left for a few moments together.|$|E
6000|$|Later, as we drew {{close to}} Uvalde, Sally <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> one seat, after {{the manner of}} Diane and Vaughn, and we {{looked out over the}} west where the sun was setting behind dim and distant mountains. We were fast leaving the wild and barren border. Already it seemed far beyond that broken rugged horizon with its dark line silhouetted against the rosy and golden sky. Already the spell of its wild life and the grim and {{haunting}} faces had begun to fade out of my memory. Let newer Rangers, with less to lose, and with the call in their hearts, go on with our work 'till soon that wild border would be safe! ...|$|E
60|$|That same {{evening at}} nine o'clock, a servant was {{despatched}} {{to meet the}} coach by which our little visitor was expected. Mrs. Bretton <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> alone <b>in</b> the drawing-room waiting her coming; John Graham Bretton being absent {{on a visit to}} one of his schoolfellows who lived in the country. My godmother read the evening paper while she waited; I sewed. It was a wet night; the rain lashed the panes, and the wind sounded angry and restless.|$|R
60|$|My friend <b>and</b> <b>I</b> now <b>sat</b> down <b>in</b> {{front of}} a {{comfortable}} fire, fed with logs {{from the roof of}} a neighbouring hut, but we had not chatted long before he asked me the object of my visit to headquarters.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I saw her. The dining-room {{doors were}} thrown open; and, {{as it was}} Christmas-time, the {{servants}} were allowed to assemble in the hall, to {{hear some of the}} ladies sing and play. Mr. Rochester would have me to come <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>in</b> a quiet corner <b>and</b> watched them. <b>I</b> never saw a more splendid scene: the ladies were magnificently dressed; most of them--at least most of the younger ones--looked handsome; but Miss Ingram was certainly the queen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{might have}} been lonesome while I was away," [...] she explained. [...] "And now about the Sunday school. I behaved well, just as you told me. Mrs. Lynde was gone, but I went right on myself. I went into the church, {{with a lot of}} other little girls, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> the corner of a pew by the window while the opening {{exercises}} went on. Mr. Bell made an awfully long prayer. I would have been dreadfully tired before he got through if I hadn't been sitting by that window. But it looked right out on the Lake of Shining Waters, so I just gazed at that and imagined all sorts of splendid things." ...|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile, {{the early}} part of the day, before the swell came up, was very pleasant; sailing, as we were, in a bright {{sunshine}} and with many mountainous islands upon different sides. Alan <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> the round-house with the doors open on each side (the wind being straight astern), and smoked a pipe or two of the captain's fine tobacco. It was at this time we heard each other's stories, which was the more important to me, as I gained some knowledge of that wild Highland country on which I was so soon to land. In those days, so close on the back of the great rebellion, it was needful a man should know what he was doing when he went upon the heather.|$|E
60|$|On {{the morning}} of the third day, when we had been forty-eight hours in the Cage, I awoke with a great relief of spirits, very weak and weary indeed, but seeing things of the right size and with their honest, {{everyday}} appearance. I had a mind to eat, moreover, rose from bed of my own movement, and as soon as we had breakfasted, stepped to the entry of the Cage and sat down outside {{in the top of the}} wood. It was a grey day with a cool, mild air: <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> a dream all morning, only disturbed by the passing by of Cluny's scouts and servants coming with provisions and reports; for as the coast was at that time clear, you might almost say he held court openly.|$|E
6000|$|... "That evening Mrs. Bowers cooked a great supper of stewed goat, tamales, baked bananas, fricasseed {{red peppers}} <b>and</b> coffee. Afterward <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> the rocking-chair {{by the front}} window, and {{she sat on the}} floor plunking at a guitar and happy, as she should be, as Mrs. William T. B.|$|R
60|$|It was night, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> alone <b>in</b> my chamber, waiting {{the moment}} when, {{as it was}} agreed, Charmion should summon me to pass down to Cleopatra. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> alone, <b>and</b> there before me lay the dagger that was to pierce her. It was long and keen, and the handle was formed of a sphinx of solid gold. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> alone, {{questioning}} the future, but no answer came. At length <b>I</b> looked up, <b>and</b> Charmion stood before me--Charmion, no longer gay and bright, but pale of face and hollow-eyed.|$|R
60|$|Thus it {{was that}} I {{was able to do}} what I shall now relate. It was a spring morning on the cliffs of Fusan, hard by the highway, that the Lady Om <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> warming <b>in</b> the sun. We were in the rags of beggary, prideless in the dust, <b>and</b> yet <b>I</b> was {{laughing}} heartily at some mumbled merry quip of the Lady Om when a shadow fell upon us. It was the great litter of Chong Mong-ju, borne by eight coolies, with outriders before and behind and fluttering attendants on either side.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you {{remember}} how long ago you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> the old Park at Burnmore, and how I kept pestering you and asking you {{what is all this}} for? And you looked at the question as an obstinate mule looks at a narrow bridge he could cross but doesn't want to. Well, Stephen, you've had nearly--how many years is it now?--to get an answer ready. What is it all for? What do you make of it? Never mind my particular case, or the case of Women with a capital W, tell me your solution. You are active, you keep doing things, you find life worth living. Is publishing a way of peace for the heart? I am prepared to believe even that. But justify yourself. Tell me what you have got there to keep your soul alive." ...|$|E
6000|$|But Koskomenos {{has another}} side, though {{the world as}} yet has found out little about it. One day in the {{wilderness}} I cheered him quite involuntarily. It was late afternoon; the fishing was over, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> my canoe watching by a grassy point {{to see what would}} happen next. Across the stream was a clay bank, near the top of which a hole as wide as a tea-cup showed where a pair of kingfishers had dug their long tunnel. [...] "There is nothing for them to stand on there; how did they begin that hole?" [...] I wondered lazily; [...] "and how can they ever raise a brood, with an open door like that for mink and weasel to enter?" [...] Here were two new problems to add to the many unsolved ones which meet you at every turn on the woodland byways.|$|E
60|$|The {{weather was}} windy and violent, and I was sea-sick {{for most of}} the crossing, and very tired and {{exhausted}} when I landed. Williams had thought of my thick over-coat and loaded me with wraps and rugs, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> the corner of a compartment in that state of mental and bodily fatigue that presses on the brows like a painless headache. I got to some little junction at last where I had to wait an hour for a branch-line train. I tasted all the bitterness of Irish hospitality, and such coffee as Ireland alone can produce. Then I went on to a station called Clumber or Clumboye, or some such name, and thence after some difficulty I got a car for my destination. It was a wretched car in which hens had been roosting, and it was drawn by a steaming horse that had sores under its mended harness.|$|E
60|$|The Ghost {{is really}} one of the play's failures, it is so trivial and unspiritual and vulgar. And it was spoilt for me from the first. When I was a child I went to the twopenny {{travelling}} theatre to see Hamlet. The Ghost had on a helmet <b>and</b> a breastplate. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> pale transport.|$|R
60|$|During all {{the rest}} of the seance my paper {{traveled}} from group to group all up and down and about that huge hall, and my happy eye was upon it always, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> motionless, steeped <b>in</b> satisfaction, drunk with enjoyment. Yes, this was heaven; I was tasting it once, if I might never taste it more.|$|R
60|$|It {{had been}} a mild, serene spring day--one of those days which, {{towards the end of}} March or the {{beginning}} of April, rise shining over the earth as heralds of summer. It was drawing to an end now; but the evening was even warm, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> at work <b>in</b> the schoolroom with the window open.|$|R
60|$|I {{would not}} draw lots however, {{and in the}} night the sailor whispered to Helmar again and again, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> the bows with my clasp-knife in my hand, though I doubt if I had the stuff in me to fight; {{and in the morning}} I agreed to Helmar's proposal, and we handed halfpence to find the odd man. The lot fell upon the sailor; but he was the strongest of us and would not abide by it, and {{attacked}} Helmar with his hands. They grappled together and almost stood up. I crawled along the boat to them, intending to help Helmar by grasping the sailor's leg; but the sailor stumbled with the swaying of the boat, and the two fell upon the gunwale and rolled overboard together. They sank like stones. I remember laughing at that, and wondering why I laughed. The laugh caught me suddenly like a thing from without.|$|E
6000|$|He {{came the}} next day, {{and again the}} next day after that, and {{delivered}} two lectures on physics to our mutual satisfaction. He talked {{with an air of}} being extremely lucid about the [...] "ether" [...] and [...] "tubes of force," [...] and [...] "gravitational potential," [...] and things like that, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> my other folding-chair and said, [...] "Yes," [...] "Go on," [...] "I follow you," [...] to keep him going. It was tremendously difficult stuff, but I do not think he ever suspected how much I did not understand him. There were moments when I doubted whether I was well employed, but at any rate I was resting from that confounded play. Now and then things gleamed on me clearly for a space, only to vanish just when I thought I had hold of them. Sometimes my attention failed altogether, and I would give it up and sit and stare at him, wondering whether, after all, it would not be better to use him as a central figure in a good farce and let all this other stuff slide. And then, perhaps, I would catch on again for a bit.|$|E
60|$|A {{little after}} sundown the full {{fury of the}} gale broke forth, such a gale as I have never seen in summer, nor, seeing how swiftly it had come, even in winter. Mary <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> silence, the house quaking overhead, the tempest howling without, the fire between us {{sputtering}} with raindrops. Our thoughts were far away with the poor fellows on the schooner, or my not less unhappy uncle, houseless on the promontory; and yet ever and again we were startled back to ourselves, when the wind would rise and strike the gable like a solid body, or suddenly fall and draw away, so that the fire leaped into flame and our hearts bounded in our sides. Now the storm in its might would seize and shake {{the four corners of}} the roof, roaring like Leviathan in anger. Anon, in a lull, cold eddies of tempest moved shudderingly in the room, lifting the hair upon our heads and passing between us as we sat. And again the wind would break forth in a chorus of melancholy sounds, hooting low in the chimney, wailing with flutelike softness round the house.|$|E
5000|$|Trevor was {{a son of}} Sir John Trevor (d. 1673) of Trevalyn Hall, Denbighshire. [...] His {{father was}} a member of {{parliament}} under James <b>I</b> <b>and</b> Charles <b>I,</b> <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> also <b>in</b> the parliaments of Oliver and of Richard Cromwell, and {{was a member of}} the council of state during the Commonwealth.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was dark}} {{by the time}} we finished, and Stalky, always serene, said: 'You command now. I don't suppose you mind my taking any action I may {{consider}} necessary to reprovision the fort?' I said, 'Of course not,' and then the lamp blew out. So Tertius <b>and</b> <b>I</b> had to climb down the tower steps (we didn't want to stay with Everett) and got back to our men. Stalky had gone off--to count the stores, I supposed. Anyhow, Tertius <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> up <b>in</b> case of a rush (they were plugging at us pretty generally, you know), relieving each other till the mornin'.|$|R
60|$|I was of {{a serious}} mind to take the advice. To prove this I called for my wrap-rascal and cane, and for a fellow with a {{flambeau}} to light me. But just then the party arrived from the assembly. <b>I</b> was tempted, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down again <b>in</b> {{a corner of the}} room, resolved to keep a check upon myself, but to stay awhile.|$|R
