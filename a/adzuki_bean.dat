5|$|Gene {{transfer}} between species {{includes the}} formation of hybrid organisms and horizontal gene transfer. Horizontal gene transfer is the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another organism that is not its offspring; this is most common among bacteria. In medicine, this contributes {{to the spread of}} antibiotic resistance, as when one bacteria acquires resistance genes it can rapidly transfer them to other species. Horizontal transfer of genes from bacteria to eukaryotes such as the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the <b>adzuki</b> <b>bean</b> weevil Callosobruchus chinensis has occurred. An example of larger-scale transfers are the eukaryotic bdelloid rotifers, which have received a range of genes from bacteria, fungi and plants. Viruses can also carry DNA between organisms, allowing transfer of genes even across biological domains.|$|E

40|$|The {{variation}} in the seed coat colour of <b>adzuki</b> <b>beans</b> among varieties, harvest years and growing locations, using a two-dimensional colour mapping technique was investigated. It {{was found that the}} differences of the seed coat colour among varieties contributed to the variation of chroma (C*) values, while the differences of the seed coat colour among harvest years were associated with lightness (L*) values. The L* values for the seed coat colour increased when the temperature during the maturing period of <b>adzuki</b> <b>beans</b> was low, and decreased when the temperature was high. The difference in the seed coat colour among the samples from different growing locations was much larger in the L* values than the C* values for samples of the same variety. The seed coat colours of <b>adzuki</b> <b>beans</b> harvested in Hokkaido and China had significantly different C* values, and were easily discriminated by the colour mapping method.

50|$|Optimal {{temperature}} range for <b>adzuki</b> <b>bean</b> growth is between 15 °C and 30 °C. The crop is not frost-hardy and needs soil temperatures above 6-10 °C (30°-34 °C optimal) for germination. Hot temperatures stimulate vegetative growth {{and are therefore}} less favorable for pea production. The <b>adzuki</b> <b>bean</b> is usually not irrigated. Annual rainfall ranges from 500-1750 mm {{in areas where the}} bean is grown. The plant can withstand drought but severe reduction in yield is expected. The cultivation of the <b>adzuki</b> <b>bean</b> is possible on preferably well drained soils with pH 5-7.5. Fertilizer application differs widely depending on expected yield but is generally similar to soybean. Due to nodulation with rhizobia nitrogen fixation of up to 100 kg/ha is possible.|$|E

40|$|This study {{analyzed}} {{the variation in}} shape and size of <b>Adzuki</b> <b>beans</b> during soaking at different temperatures. In addition, different mathematical models were fitted to the experimental values of volumetric expansion, selecting the best one. Grains of <b>Adzuki</b> <b>beans</b> (Vigna angularis) with moisture content of approximately 0. 25 (decimal d. b.) were manually harvested; they were, then, dried to 0. 128 (decimal d. b.). The beans were subjected to soaking in distilled water at the temperatures 18 ± 1, 27 ± 1, 36 ± 1, and 45 ± 1 °C, in five repetitions. Recipients containing 80 mL of distilled water and 20 g of beans for each sample were used. The samples were periodically weighed {{in order to determine}} the water absorption. After that, the samples were removed from the recipients and placed on filter papers for two minutes to drain the surface water. Water absorption continued until the beans reached the saturation moisture content. It was concluded that, the form of the <b>Adzuki</b> <b>beans</b> was altered regularly, the orthogonal axes expanded differentially in the radial and axial directions, and that the linear model appropriately described the volumetric expansion of the <b>Adzuki</b> <b>beans,</b> among the series of models analyzed for the temperatures 18, 27, 36 and 45 °C...|$|R

Grains of <b>adzuki</b> <b>beans,</b> with moisture content of 1. 14 (decimal dry basis) at harvest and dried until the moisture content of 0. 11 (decimal dry basis.) were used. Drying was done in an experimental drier maintened at controlled temperatures of 30, 40, 50, 60, and 70 ºC and relative humidity of 52. 0, 28. 0, 19. 1, 13. 1, and 6. 8 %, respectively. Physiological and technological seed quality was evaluated using the germination test, Index of Germination Velocity (IGV), electrical conductivity, and water absorption, respectively. Under the conditions tested in the present study, {{it can be concluded}} that drying time for <b>adzuki</b> <b>beans</b> decreases with the higher air temperatures of 60 and 70 ºC, and it affected the physiological and technological seed quality. Thus, to avoid compromising adzuki seeds quality, it is recommended to promote its drying up to 50 ºC...|$|R
