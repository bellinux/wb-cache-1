40|$|The {{universal}} {{principle of}} architecture {{can be defined}} as follows: “The <b>architectural</b> <b>product</b> is the synthesis of the different man-made physical environments that are formed by locating the series of building components in different ways”. Within this context, it is necessary to determine the principle of building assembly and the assembly of “material components” in order to produce the building. The material components are the elements of sub systems (such as, structural, envelope, services, partitions, circulation, and finishing systems) which form the building system of an <b>architectural</b> <b>product.</b> Every building is an integrated product. Integration defines the relations of sub systems with the whole. Therefore, it is necessary to define the sub systems and their relations in realizing the <b>architectural</b> <b>product.</b> This paper presents the analysis principles of the sub-systems, relationship between the analyzed systems and components, integration principles and possibilities of them, and the future conditions...|$|E

An <b>architectural</b> <b>product</b> may be considered as one that has significant meaning when it can excite the intellect of a person and make him contemplative.

40|$|Several {{different}} sealing solutions {{can be used}} to seal anodic films {{produced in}} sulfuric acid electrolytes. While these seals will meet the common accelerated weathering tests such as salt spray and acid dissolution, they can impart both desirable and undesirable properties to the coating. We will discuss these special properties and how they might affect the performance of some commonly anodized products. Also discussed will be the methods used to determine these sealing side effects. A common use for anodic films is on architectural products such as windows, curtain walls and doors. Their widespread use in this industry is due to the anodic film's natural resistance to abrasion and weathering, and its ability to be colored with light-fast pigments. Therefore, the anodic film acts as both the decoration and protection for the <b>architectural</b> <b>product.</b> The American Architectural Manufacturers Association, AAMA, a trade organization within this industry, has set performance standards for each component used in manufacturing an <b>architectural</b> <b>product</b> including the anodic film.

40|$|A PhotocopyFrom {{the ancient}} time, {{according}} to the man's development insight in to the world the intellectual interpretation {{of the idea of}} space underwent many changes. Space had existed naturally in most intimate experiences of living organisms and particularly of the human beings long before all the conceptual crystallization. When considering total space surrounding us it's limitless, intangible and meaningless. It is considered as infinite space. But when it separated and limited from the unlimited space by boundaries, limitation it gets a meaning and it creates architectural space. <b>Architectural</b> <b>product</b> means combination of architectural forms and spaces. It fulfills various purposes of human existence. The space and forms of architectural products are design to accommodate different activities of man. Thus these spaces should possess the required attributes and qualities to facilitate those purposes and activities. Further there special qualities must express exact purposes for which they have been created. Then the <b>Architectural</b> <b>product</b> should not only for the visual satisfaction, but also for the emotional experience that person feel when moving through the product. Therefore to create a movement within spaces they should be articulated in an order and there should have an inter-relation ship between them.

40|$|The {{essence of}} {{building}} design process and management for building sustainability {{in the creation}} and maintenance of a qualitative <b>architectural</b> <b>product</b> is investigated in this paper. The design process, concept of building sustainability and particularly {{the quality of the}} built environment are discussed. Akure, a state capital in Nigeria was used as a case study. The principles and indicators for sustainability of buildings and its implications {{on the quality of the}} environment are examined in details. Survey findings include the views of the professionals on the clients, perception on the design process as well as management of projects, and the implications on the quality of the ensuring products and the cityâs environment. The data were factor analyzed using varimax rotation criterion (with Kaiser Normalization). The results revealed that five factors were effective, with one of them exhibiting the greatest variability and individual differences. The variables that loaded on this factor were really the aspects of the process and management relating to the clients. The findings also revealed the professionalsâ wrong attitude towards design process as shown with a very high degree of variability in the study.

40|$|AbstractThis study {{concentrates}} on the experiences acquired in the architectural design studios which are a prominent part of the architectural education, and evaluates also the effects the space where the project is being put to life has on an <b>architectural</b> <b>product.</b> In this sense, this study includes mainstream design approaches, {{based on the idea}} that an inter-dependence is mandatory between space, context and the architectural outcome; and also contarian ones which criticizes this interaction. This paper aims to weigh the potential that these two different approaches discover whilst interacting with space against the conceptualization and spatialisation methods through the design process. In order to do so, the study advances in two separate stages: The first stage develops a discussion of the mainstream design approaches, which are based on the a priori and urgent interaction of the <b>architectural</b> <b>product</b> with the space and context, and evaluates also the architectural discourses opposing these ideas. The second section has chosen to dissect two different architectural design studio experiences of Bomonti [B] and Seyrantepe [S], (Districts located both in Istanbul) based on the context set forth in the first section. Thus in this manner, six student studies with architectural products relating to different districts of Istanbul have been chosen from these design studios and they have been evaluated on the basis of interaction they have implemented with space. The conclusion of the study is that the architectural design process incorporates multiple potentials to the architectural understanding, and that the education given in the architectural design studios carries an important responsibility in the development of the design approaches. In this sense, as an independent platform, the architectural education is seen as a valuable laboratory, which has the ability to expose the embedded potentials of space and its design...|$|E

Identity, personality and character form a whole inseparable from human life.  The issues such as “is it possible for such concepts related with life to come along with architecture” and “to affect the physical and lexical characteristics of product in designing process” are the questions to be answered. Thus, with the best definition, personality is the emotional, intellectual and behavioral characteristics of a person he / she show in daily life. Personality can be defined, described, suggested and it is stable. Personality disorder is, on the other hand, the situation seen when the personality features are enlarged and ruined the environmental compliance, caused a malfunction and personal disorder. Based on this general definition of personality and personality disorder, this basic question is asked: Is it possible to create an interdisciplinary design model through the concepts of psychology in design of an <b>architectural</b> <b>product?</b> Within this question, this study is conducted in Karadeniz Technical University, Department of Architecture, and Project - 4 Course.

In a simple test arrangement we realized the digital design and additive fabrication of two by three meters brick walls. The use of bricks, being the primary module for construction, and at a relatively coarse resolution, allowed us to concentrate on the design of completely programmed walls encompassing material-dependent parameters. The resulting prototypes depict the great potential of the integration of the design and the fabrication process.
