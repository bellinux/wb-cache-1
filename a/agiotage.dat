6000|$|Lady Montfort said nothing. Being of {{an eager}} nature, {{it was rather}} her habit to {{interrupt}} those who addressed her, especially on matters she deemed disagreeable. Her husband used to say, [...] "Berengaria is a charming companion, but if she would only listen a little more, she would have {{so much more to}} tell me." [...] On the present occasion, Endymion had no reason to complain that he had not a fair opportunity of stating his views and wishes. She was quite silent, changed colour occasionally, bit her beautiful lip, and gently but constantly lashed her beautiful riding habit. When he paused, she inquired if he had done, and he assenting, she said, [...] "I think the whole thing preposterous. What can Lord Roehampton have to do before the meeting of parliament? He has not got to write the Queen's speech. The only use of being in opposition is that we may enjoy ourselves. The best thing that Lord Roehampton and all his friends can do is travel for a couple of years. Ask the Count of Ferroll what he thinks of the situation. He will tell you that he never knew one more hopeless. Taxes and tariffs--that's the future of England, and, so far as I can see, it may go on for ever. The government here desires nothing better than what they call Peace. What they mean by peace is <b>agiotage,</b> shares at a premium, and bubble companies. The whole thing is corrupt, as it ever must be when government {{is in the hands of}} a mere middle class, and that, too, a limited one; but it may last hopelessly long, and in the meantime, 'Vive la bagatelle!'" ...|$|E
50|$|Speculation, in {{the narrow}} sense of {{financial}} speculation, involves the buying, holding, selling, and short-selling of stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, collectibles, real estate, derivatives or any valuable financial instrument to profit from fluctuations in its price as opposed to buying it for use or for income via methods such as dividends or interest. Speculation or <b>agiotage</b> represents one of three market roles in western financial markets, distinct from hedging, long term investing and arbitrage. Speculators in an asset may have no intention to have long term exposure to that asset.|$|E

Genetic modified products are those, which includes the genetic modified organisms, which DNA is changed such way, which it is impossible reach in nature. GMO can include fragments of DNA from some alive organisms. Technology of the formation GMO so imperfect that it result can {{be a source of}} biological and ecological risk for person and surrounding ambiences. Products, which contain GMO, cause big <b>agiotage</b> in the world. Nobody knows, where exactly transgen wait for us. There many variants – from bread to sweet drinks.

40|$|In {{scientific}} article author {{research problem}} of history economics relationships between Ukraine and Persian country in Russian empire period. Main {{attention is paid}} to an analyze of sugar export to this country. External economic relations of Ukrainian lands in the Russian empire with Persia the day before and in the years of First World war remain a scantily explored theme. There is only separate information about foreign trade of the Russian empire and Persia. Official statistics of those years divided all outbound of commodities into two categories: export to the European countries and to Asia. Sugar was taken out mainly through the Baku custom. With beginning of the First World war prices in Persia began incredibly to grow. A rich buyer and <b>agiotage</b> demand appeared. It created subsoil for speculations. Businessmen bought up sugar directly on sugar-houses. ? ?????? ??????????????? ????????????????? ?????? ?????????? ??????? ? ???????? ????????? ????? ??????????? ??????? ?????????? ??????? ? ??????? ? ?????? ?? ?. ? ?????????, ??????????? ???????? ? ????????? ??????????? ??????...|$|E
40|$|This {{is a brief}} {{survey of}} {{the present state of}} ideas {{concerning}} the parton content of the nucleon spin after their ten-years evolution since the discovery of the EMC. In 1974 an article [1] appeared in the Physical Review in which J. Ellis and R. Jaffe deduced some predictions (sum rules) concerning structure functions of polarized lepton-nucleon deeply inelastic scattering. The predictions were based on some apparently natural assumptions like the negligible rôle of strange quarks {{in the formation of the}} nucleon spin. The result did not cause a noticeable <b>agiotage.</b> The general attention was focused then on another problems. Meanwhile some other important works were published among which one has to mention papers [2] (calculation of the “polarized ” anomalous dimension whose lowest order is 0 (α 2 s) in contrast to usual 0 (αs) for “unpolarized ” anomalous dimensions. Later this anomalous dimension was calculated to three loops [3].) and [4] (establishing a relation of the problem to the chiral anomaly and discussion of the rôle of the gluon helicity) ...|$|E
