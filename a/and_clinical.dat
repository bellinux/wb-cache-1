5|$|Benzodiazepines have robust {{efficacy}} in {{the short-term}} management of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), but were not shown effective in producing long-term improvement overall.

However, they should not usually be given for longer than 2–4 weeks. The only medications NICE recommends for the longer term management of GAD are antidepressants.|$|E

5|$|For both NSCLC and SCLC, the {{two general}} types of staging {{evaluations}} are clinical staging and surgical staging. Clinical staging is performed prior to definitive surgery. It {{is based on}} the results of imaging studies (such as CT scans and PET scans) and biopsy results.

5|$|The {{sociology}} {{of health and}} illness focuses on the social effects of, and public attitudes toward, illnesses, diseases, mental health and disabilities.

In Britain, sociology was introduced into the medical curriculum following the Goodenough Report (1944).|$|E

5|$|A freedom-of-information request in 2015 {{revealed}} that the university received 31,857 undergraduate applications and made 13,302 offers in 2014–15. This resulted in an offer rate of 41.8%, a yield rate on offers of 45.3% and an overall acceptance rate of 18.9%. The School of Medicine received 1,764 applications, only 39 offers were made resulting in an offer rate of just 2.2%.

5|$|A {{survey in}} 2005 of 88 {{paediatric}} neurologists in the US found that 36% regularly prescribed the diet after {{three or more}} drugs had failed; 24% occasionally prescribed the diet as a last resort; 24% had only prescribed the diet in a few rare cases; and 16% had never prescribed the diet. There are several possible explanations for this gap between evidence <b>and</b> <b>clinical</b> practice. One major factor may be the lack of adequately trained dietitians, who are needed to administer a ketogenic diet programme.|$|E

However, the definition has evolved over time to include a change in consciousness, such as amnesia, although controversy continues about whether the definition should include only those injuries in which loss of consciousness occurs.|$|E
