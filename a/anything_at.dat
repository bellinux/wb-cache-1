5|$|Every {{player has}} {{a limit to}} the number of units they can create—a {{population}} limit—but may not immediately use the entire potential population. The population capacity, which can be capped at anywhere between 75 – 200 in intervals of 25, is {{based on the number of}} houses, Castles, or Town Centers—the main building in a player's town—which have been built. The Age of Kings introduced two significant new features for unit management: the idle villager button, which helps players identify villagers that have not been assigned a task, and the town bell, which sends all a player's villagers into their Town Center, Castle, or tower for safety; units garrisoned within these three buildings, especially archers, increase the building's firepower (towers fire more arrows with units garrisoned inside) including the town center, which cannot fire <b>anything</b> <b>at</b> all without someone garrisoned there.|$|E

25|$|Matrix mechanics, on {{the other}} hand, came from the Bohr school, which was {{concerned}} with discrete energy states and quantum jumps. Bohr's followers did not appreciate physical models which pictured electrons as waves, or as <b>anything</b> <b>at</b> all. They preferred {{to focus on the}} quantities which were directly connected to experiments.|$|E

25|$|The British {{commissioned}} Dominica under Lieutenant Robert Peter. On 11 August 1805 Dominica {{captured the}} small rowboat Hazard about two leagues off Scotts Head, Dominica. She had {{a crew of}} 14 men armed with small arms. She was three days out of Pointe-à-Pitre and had not captured <b>anything.</b> <b>At</b> about the same time, Dominica captured a schooner.|$|E

25|$|Brendan McMonigal, Geraint F. Lewis, and Philip O'Byrne {{have argued}} that when an Alcubierre-driven ship decelerates from superluminal speed, the {{particles}} that its bubble has gathered in transit would be released in energetic outbursts akin to a sonic boom shockwave; {{in the case of}} forward-facing particles, energetic enough to destroy <b>anything</b> <b>at</b> the destination {{directly in front of the}} ship.|$|E
25|$|Instead {{of showing}} that the Boolean laws are satisfied, we can instead {{postulate}} a set X, two binary operations on X, and one unary operation, and require that those operations satisfy the laws of Boolean algebra. The elements of X need not be bit vectors or subsets but can be <b>anything</b> <b>at</b> all. This leads to the more general abstract definition.|$|E
25|$|On 13 May Peterell {{captured}} the Spanish privateer schooner Santa Anna off Cuba. Santa Anna was armed with one long 18-pounder gun and four 6-pounder guns, {{and had a}} crew of 106 men. She had sailed from Santiago de Cuba only {{the day before and}} had not yet captured <b>anything.</b> <b>At</b> some point in 1805 or 1806, Peterel {{captured the}} ship Hoffnung, in sight of the armed schooner Arab, Lieutenant Carpenter, commander.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} pratītyasamutpāda {{has also been}} {{compared}} to the Western philosophy of metaphysics, {{the study of the}} nature of being and ultimate reality. Schilbrack states says that the doctrine of interdependent origination seems to fit the definition of a metaphysical teaching, by questioning whether there is <b>anything</b> <b>at</b> all. Hoffman disagrees, and asserts that pratītyasamutpāda should not be considered a metaphysical doctrine in the strictest sense, since it does not confirm nor deny specific entities or realities.|$|E
25|$|A {{statue of}} George Orwell, sculpted by the British {{sculptor}} Martin Jennings, was unveiled on 7 November 2017 outside Broadcasting House, {{the headquarters of}} the BBC. The wall behind the statue is inscribed with: “If liberty means <b>anything</b> <b>at</b> all, it means the right to tell people what {{they do not want to}} hear”, words from his proposed preface to Animal Farm and a rallying cry for the idea of free speech in an open society.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} break one's fast on a seudat mitzvah, many {{authorities}} rule {{that one must}} partake {{of at least a}} kotevet of food (around 1.5 to 2 oz.) or a melo lugmav of liquid (at least around 1.7 oz.) at the seudah (Minchas Yitzchak, ibid.; Chazon Ovadiah, ibid.; Teshuvos V'hanhagos, ibid.). Other authorities rule that a firstborn need not eat <b>anything</b> <b>at</b> the siyum itself, and that he may break his fast anytime after the siyum (Siddur Pesach K'hilchaso, ibid; Rabbi Yehoshua Menachem Mendel Ehrenberg, Devar Yehoshua 2:81).|$|E

25|$|Another {{difference}} is {{between those who}} believe the New Covenant has already substantially arrived (Preterists), and that this knowledge of God that the member of the New Covenant has is primarily salvific knowledge; and those that believe that the New Covenant has not yet substantially arrived, but will in the Second Coming, and that this knowledge is more complete knowledge, meaning {{a member of the}} New Covenant no longer has to be taught <b>anything</b> <b>at</b> all regarding the Christian life (not just that they lack need for exhortation regarding salvific reconciliation with God).|$|E
25|$|Despite {{his lifelong}} fame and upper-class origins, Churchill always {{struggled}} to keep his income at a level which would fund his extravagant lifestyle. MPs before 1946 received only a nominal salary (and in fact did not receive <b>anything</b> <b>at</b> all until the Parliament Act 1911) so many had secondary professions from which to earn a living. From his first book in 1898 until his second stint as Prime Minister, Churchill's income while out of office was almost entirely made from writing books and opinion pieces for newspapers and magazines, among them the forthnightly columns {{that appeared in the}} Evening Standard from 1936 warning of the rise of Hitler and the danger of the policy of appeasement.|$|E
25|$|Early in the evening, {{more than}} six hours after the explosion, Kursk failed to {{complete}} a scheduled communication check at 18:00. The Northern Fleet command became concerned and tried to contact Kursk. After repeated failures, at 18:30 they began a search and rescue operation, dispatching aircraft to locate the submarine, which again failed to locate the ship on the surface. At 17:00, an Ilyushin 38 aircraft was dispatched and looked for Kursk for three hours without spotting <b>anything.</b> <b>At</b> 22:30, the Northern Fleet declared an emergency, and the exercise was stopped. Between fifteen and twenty-two vessels of the Northern Fleet, including about 3,000 sailors, began searching for the submarine. Captain Teslenko commanding Mikhail Rudnitsky left port at 00:30.|$|E

6000|$|Chameleons {{and some}} other lizards inflate {{themselves}} when angry. Thus a species inhabiting Oregon, the Tapaya Douglasii, is slow in its movements and does not bite, but has a ferocious aspect; [...] "when irritated it springs in a most threatening manner <b>at</b> <b>anything</b> pointed <b>at</b> it, {{at the same time}} opening its mouth wide and hissing audibly, after which it inflates its body, and shows other marks of anger."[22] ...|$|R
25|$|TSA rules {{state that}} if you move your fire demon next to an {{opposing}} fire demon, only your fire demon is immolated; all other adjacent pieces survive. This implies that a fire demon's passive burn (how it automatically burns enemy pieces that end up next to it without moving) is faster than its active burn (how it burns enemy pieces that it moves next to). A few computer programs and books stipulate that other adjacent pieces are immolated as well, with only the opposing fire demon surviving, but this interpretation is not widely followed. Both variants are playable, though the TSA rules are more consistent in not allowing the suicidal fire demon to burn <b>anything</b> <b>at</b> all.|$|E
25|$|The {{bomb that}} Çatlı's team had planted in Ara Toranyan's car on 22 March 1983 did not explode. A {{follow-up}} attempt also failed. Toranyan {{said they had}} planted the bomb in the wrong car. Likewise, Henri Papazyan's car bomb on 1 May 1984 did not explode. Çatlı claimed credit for killing Hagop Hagopian, however {{he was in a}} French prison (again, on narcotics charges) {{at the time of the}} attack. Papazyan is now believed to have been killed as a result of infighting. The second French team (led by Ketene) did carry out some attacks (which Çatlı also claimed credit for), such as the 1984 Alfortville monument and Salle Pleyel concert room attacks. It is unknown whether the Lebanese contingent did <b>anything</b> <b>at</b> all.|$|E
25|$|As a brief example, Frame {{uses the}} {{epistemology}} of Kant, who taught that {{the categories of}} thought that are necessary for our understanding the world around us, such as causality, logic, time, space, and order, are structured by our minds and imposed upon the things we experience. In order to be rational and {{make sense out of}} life we must assume, or presuppose, these notions. Because we cannot empirically verify these categories by touch, smell, sight, etc. they must be thought of as created by and arising from our minds, thus ordering and providing the criterion for those things that we can empirically verify. This led Kant to conclude that if we are to think of <b>anything</b> <b>at</b> all we must think in terms of everything being caused by something logically and temporally prior to it. This led to a fairly deterministic view of mankind.|$|E
