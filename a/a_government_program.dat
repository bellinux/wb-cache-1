These include the Otero County Administration Building at 1101 New York Avenue, a Pueblo style building originally constructed as the main U.S. Post Office in 1938. The building is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The main entrance portico features frescoes by Peter Hurd completed in 1942. The Post Office moved out in 1961, and the building was used by a succession of Federal agencies and was known as the Federal Building. The last Federal agency to occupy it was the United States Forest Service who used it as the headquarters of the Lincoln National Forest until October 2008, when that agency moved to a newly constructed building.|$|E

2500|$|According to Achim, the population-exchange texts do not {{exhibit a}} racist agenda, {{and are also}} [...] "non-imperialistic". They are [...] "in unison" [...] with Antonescu's {{policies}} of ethnic cleansing, but were not in themselves the basis of <b>a</b> <b>government</b> <b>program.</b> Nonetheless, one of the memos stands as a historical premiere, since Manuilă made official claims about a [...] "Gypsy problem", again describing the Romanies as a [...] "dysgenic" [...] threat, [...] "social and national non-values, and a racial hazard". He also assessed that Romanies had been systematically under-counted in the 1930 census, and that this apparent assimilation reflected [...] "extreme humanitarianism" [...] on the Romanian side, and had gone on for far too long. According to scholar Dennis Deletant, this approach is [...] "redolent of Nazi ideology", seeking [...] "scapegoats for the woes of the Romanian people". Deletant notes that Manuilă's eugenic ideas about the Romanies did in fact shape Antonescu's [...] "ethnic policies", leading to the Romanies' deportation.|$|E
2500|$|In his {{introductory}} [...] "Conclusions and Recommendations", Condon wrote: [...] "Our {{general conclusion}} is that nothing {{has come from the}} study of UFOs in the past 21 years that has added to scientific knowledge. Careful consideration of the record as it is available to us leads us to conclude that further extensive study of UFOs probably cannot be justified in the expectation that science will be advanced thereby." [...] He also recommended against the creation of <b>a</b> <b>government</b> <b>program</b> to investigate UFO reports. He also described the problem that confronts the scientific community, that each scientist must evaluate the record for himself, and that the Reports recommendation against further research [...] "may not be true for all time." [...] He advised that government agencies and private foundations [...] "ought to be willing to consider UFO research proposals...on an open-minded, unprejudiced basis....ach individual case ought to be carefully considered on its own merits." [...] In particular, the Report noted that there were gaps in scientific knowledge in the fields of [...] "atmospheric optics, including radio wave propagation, and of atmospheric electricity" [...] that might benefit from further research in the UFO field.|$|E
2500|$|Santiago emerged the {{political}} scenario {{prior to the}} 2000 general elections, running for the mayorship of his native Comerío representing the Partido Popular Democratico. He won this bid with 6,232 votes or 50%, defeating his opponents, the incumbent Luis Rivera Rivera (Partido Nuevo Progresista; 5,832 or 46.8%) and Carlos Colón Márquez (Partido Independentista Puertorriqueño; 297 or 2.4%). Comerío's general political base supported the PNP's candidate for governor in these elections, but Santiago managed to attract enough new voters for the PPD base to grow in 13% during {{the first years of}} his administration. This was combined with a 3% reduction in the PNP affiliates that voted for that party's candidate for mayor, an estimated 2% voted for the PPD in this ballot. During this term, he also represented the mayors in the administrative structure of the Programa de Comunidades Especiales, <b>a</b> <b>government</b> <b>program</b> that aimed to reduce the poverty rate. On November 6, 2004, Santiago was elected for a second term (6,276 votes or 50.51%) [...] defeating challengers Miguel Rivera, Jr. (PNP; 5,887 or 47.38%) and Aida Luz Cruz Bermúdez (PIP; 204 or 1.64%). In these general elections, the PNP was once again favored in the governor ballot, but the PPD was supported by voters from both parties in the mayorship ballot. Santiago won a third consecutive time at the 2008 general election by receiving 6,962 votes or 56.3%, defeating Randy Reyes Pimentel (PNP; 5,158 or 41.7%) and Luis Rivera Márquez (PIP; 174 or 1.4%). This represented an improvement of 11% when compared to 2004. On March 12, 2010, Santiago assumed the interim presidency of the Asociación de Alcaldes de Puerto Rico (AAPR), vacated by soberanista leader William Miranda Marín, who was suffering from pancreatic cancer. [...] He was subsequently supported by his peers to take charge of the office officially, being sworn in by Miranda Marín himself. His staff was completed by Pedro García, mayor of Hormigueros, Puerto Rico, as first vice president; Jorge Márquez, mayor of Maunabo, Puerto Rico, as second vice president and Heriberto Vélez, mayor of Quebradillas, Puerto Rico as secretary. Santiago had already served as secretary for the organization and was the acting vice president. Santiago is the official representative of the mayors at the party's committee, the Junta de Gobierno del PPD.|$|E
