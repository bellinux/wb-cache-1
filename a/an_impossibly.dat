5|$|In 1913, Ernst Zermelo used chess as a {{basis for}} his theory of game strategies, which is {{considered}} as one of the predecessors of game theory. Zermelo's theorem states {{that it is possible to}} solve chess, i.e. to determine with certainty the outcome of a perfectly played game (either white can force a win, or black can force a win, or both sides can force at least a draw). However, according to Claude Shannon, there are 1043 legal positions in chess, so it will take <b>an</b> <b>impossibly</b> long time to compute a perfect strategy with any feasible technology.|$|E
5|$|This plan {{required}} tacit Soviet support, and the non-aggression pact (the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact) between Germany and the Soviet Union, led by Joseph Stalin, {{included a}} secret agreement to partition Poland {{between the two}} countries. Contrary to Ribbentrop's prediction that Britain would sever Anglo-Polish ties, Britain and Poland signed the Anglo-Polish alliance on 25 August 1939. This, along with news from Italy that Mussolini would not honour the Pact of Steel, prompted Hitler to postpone the attack on Poland from 25 August to 1 September. Hitler unsuccessfully tried to manoeuvre the British into neutrality by offering them a non-aggression guarantee on 25 August; he then instructed Ribbentrop to present a last-minute peace plan with <b>an</b> <b>impossibly</b> short time limit {{in an effort to}} blame the imminent war on British and Polish inaction.|$|E
5|$|As Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) {{attempts}} {{to negotiate with}} the Aldeans, they briefly allow Dr. Crusher to reunite with her son on the planet. Wesley hints about the Custodian to her, while she secretly passes him a tricorder to scan the Aldeans. After Picard fails to get the Aldeans to agree to the children's return, they fire an energy weapon that sends the Enterprise three days away from Aldea at maximum warp. The Aldeans warn that they can send the Enterprise <b>an</b> <b>impossibly</b> far distance if they refuse to cooperate. During the return trip, Dr. Crusher reviews the scanner results and finds the Aldeans are suffering from radiation poisoning, which has harmed their reproductive capabilities but can be reversed if the source is discovered. On arrival back at the planet, Picard orders the crew {{to try to find a}} way through the planet's shield while he restarts negotiations.|$|E

5000|$|David Lawton, the {{executive}} director of the New Chaucer Society, said of Chaucer and the French Tradition: [...] "It remains astonishingly undated. The sheer quality of Muscatine’s reading continues to set <b>an</b> almost <b>impossibly</b> high standard, and virtually single-handedly he opened up Chaucer studies to France and Chaucer’s secular, French heritage. There has been a huge growth in this field, most of it following along the routes he made." ...|$|R
5000|$|Reception to {{the movie}} has been negative, with Fearnet's Scott Weinberg saying [...] "while it's by no means awful, the movie's as {{effortlessly}} forgettable as its title." [...] Reelfilm's David Nusair stated that [...] "Though it kicks off with a relatively promising prologue, Beneath's few positive elements are ultimately rendered moot by <b>an</b> almost <b>impossibly</b> slow-moving narrative that's exacerbated by Nora Zehetner's woefully flat turn as the central character." ...|$|R
5|$|The {{authenticity}} of the Libellus (notwithstanding Boniface's suspicions, on which see below) was not called into serious question until the mid-twentieth century, when several historians forwarded {{the hypothesis that the}} document had been concocted in England in the early eighth century. It has since been shown, however, that this hypothesis was based on incomplete evidence and historical misapprehensions. In particular, twentieth-century scholarship focused on the presence in the Libellus of what appeared to be <b>an</b> <b>impossibly</b> lax rule regarding consanguinity and marriage, a rule that (it was thought) Gregory could not possibly have endorsed. It is now known that this rule is not in fact as lax as historians had thought, and moreover that the rule is fully consistent with Gregory's style and mode of thought. Today, Gregory I's authorship of the Libellus is generally accepted. The question of authenticity aside, manuscript and textual evidence indicates that the document was being transmitted in Italy by perhaps as early as the beginning of the seventh century (i.e. shortly after Gregory I's death in 604), and in England {{by the end of the}} same century.|$|E

25|$|Murder was {{regarded}} as an offence against the family rather than against society or the state. It was normally dealt with by the payment of blood money (galanas) by the killer and his extended family {{to the family of}} the deceased. The base sum was computed by the social status and position of the victim. The galanas of the king of Deheubarth was set at <b>an</b> <b>impossibly</b> long line of impossibly perfect cattle to ensure it could never be met; the family of a murdered slave, meanwhile, received no galanas, although the slave's owner was to be compensated for the loss. This sum might then be modified in certain situations (for example, an attack from ambush doubled the base fine). Upon the payment of the blood money, the victim's family was then legally bound to forgo its vengeance (dial). Murder by poison, however, carried the death penalty.|$|E

40|$|A {{detailed}} {{model for}} a photospheric dynamo has been presented by Henoux and Somov (1987), who used the three-fluid model to treat {{the properties of the}} weakly ionized plasma. Only the equations for the two ionized components were solved. The equation for the neutral component is considered, and it is argued that the model is unacceptable becaused of <b>an</b> implied <b>impossibly</b> large unbalanced stress on the neutral gas. It is argued more generally that all existing photospheric dynamo models are untenable...|$|R
5000|$|In a cave {{inhabited}} by a spider. Supposedly, Bruce watched the small spider try to spin a line across <b>a</b> seemingly <b>impossibly</b> wide gap. <b>As</b> Bruce watched, the spider tried and tried and tried. [...] "Foolish spider" [...] thought Bruce, {{but continued to}} watch. Suddenly, the spider succeeded in leaping across the gap with its thread. Bruce considered this, and took it as an encouragement that he, too, should continue to persevere regardless of seemingly hopeless circumstances, and he later came out of hiding. It is doubtful if the story is true, however.|$|R
25|$|The medieval {{story of}} Sir Eglamour of Artois {{makes use of}} a number of themes and motifs that are found in other romances of the period. Near the very {{beginning}} of the tale the reader, or listener, is at once introduced to two of them. Sir Eglamour is in love with his overlord’s daughter. She is the child and heir of an earl. Sir Eglamour, a relatively poor knight, declares his love for Christabel and is immediately given three impossible tasks to achieve by her angry father in order to win her hand in marriage; just as Culhwch is given <b>an</b> <b>impossibly</b> long list of impossible tasks by Chief Giant Ysbaddaden in the Old Welsh Mabinogion tale How Culhwch won Olwen, in order to win the hand in marriage of his daughter and heir. Sir Eglamour’s first task is to take a deer from a forest far to the west, where the Celtic Otherworld is often located. The forest is surrounded by a stone wall and the deer are guarded by a giant who stands fifty feet tall. Despite these difficulties, Sir Eglamour manages to kill the principal stag of the giant’s herd and then kills the giant himself. Having achieved this first trial, Sir Eglamour returns home triumphant, carrying the giant’s head as well as that of the deer.|$|E
500|$|The DTS, {{and through}} him the NDRC, were informed, {{in line with}} the Canadian findings, that even a white {{aircraft}} would normally appear dark against the sky. They were further told that while [...] "floodlighting" [...] the aircraft (in the manner of diffused lighting camouflage for ships) could in theory make it bright enough to match its background, that would require <b>an</b> <b>impossibly</b> large amount of electrical power: but a less power-hungry option was available, namely to use forward-facing lights, and to require the aircraft to fly within 3 degrees of the line directly towards the submarine, so that only its counter-illuminated front would face the enemy.|$|E
500|$|The game {{did receive}} some {{negative}} reviews, however. Despite {{calling it the}} best Final Fantasy VII spin-off, Eurogamer criticized that [...] "for the twenty-six, twenty-eight, thirty-year-olds who it's aimed at, the game has little to offer beyond polished sentimentality." [...] Although PALGN called the DMW system a [...] "handy tool", they also felt it was the game's weakest point. X-Play gave the game a 2/5, complaining about the unskippable cutscenes, poor dialogue, repetitive gameplay, and a weak plot. On April Fools' Day, in response to criticism for their original review, they [...] "decided to give the game a second look {{and give it a}} re-review, this time with a clear unbiased perspective," [...] sarcastically dubbing over the original and giving it <b>an</b> <b>impossibly</b> high 6/5.|$|E
50|$|Manchester City Council {{restored}} and refurbished the Town Hall Extension and the Central Library from 2010-15 {{to include a}} public service hub to make its services more accessible. The public entrances on Mount Street and St Peter's Square were restored to their 1930s appearance and staircases to the lower ground floor were reinstated to access the Central Library which was extended into the basement. The rates hall was restored. The project, delivered by Laing O'Rourke, won the Construction News Judges Supreme Award in June 2015.

But the plan he hatches with Ratty, Badger and Otter to rescue Toad goes horribly wrong. With the prospect of Christmas in gaol and a trial for capital offences soon to follow, Mole will have to work hard if he is to salvage something of the Christmas spirit for his friends.|$|R
500|$|United States Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes obliquely {{referred}} to the book in a December 1937 speech in which he declared that [...] "the 60 families" [...] had engineered the Great Depression. The following month, he [...] directly referenced the book in a speech given {{in support of the}} New Deal, despite the fact that Lundberg used America's 60 Families, in part, to attack the [...] "New Dealers" [...] and cited instances of campaign contributions made by the [...] "60 families" [...] to Franklin Roosevelt's political campaigns. Ickes' speeches were coordinated with a similar one given by U.S. Assistant Attorney-General Robert H. Jackson to the American Political Science Association. In it, Jackson declared that American young people had to start their careers at [...] "the bottom of <b>an</b> <b>impossibly</b> long ladder of a few great corporations dominated by America’s 60 families".|$|E
500|$|Another spoof was of {{a musical}} {{detailing}} the life of Bessie Bunter, entitled Bessie! The musical starts as an Andrew Lloyd Webber parody with the setting of a girl's private school but they've [...] included {{issues such as the}} Spanish Civil War and the McCarthy era. On being asked about Bessie's fatness, the producer (Sir Dave) replies [...] "it is a sort of mental fatness". The lead actress, Carla, belts out in rehearsals one of the songs, [...] "One Day", despite insisting she has [...] "pneumonia". She says to prepare for the role she starts with the bra and then everything falls into place. Later, Bessie! is rewritten completely and the previous cast are sacked: it is, after all, a musical about [...] "a big fat girl". Meanwhile, Carla is crying and being comforted by her colleagues, but further upset by Sir Dave telling her to [...] "get the **** out of here will you Carla, we don't really want snot all over the plush love" [...] In this rewritten part of Bessie, she is played by Victoria Wood who sings <b>an</b> <b>impossibly</b> glamorous and upbeat number. However, she complains at the end that [...] "you're {{going to have to change}} this floor".|$|E
500|$|Indigenous Australians in New South Wales mixed {{the venom}} {{with that of}} snakes and pine tree gum to form a broth used to coat spear tips. Slim Newton drew popular {{attention}} to redbacks with his song [...] "The Redback on the Toilet Seat", which won the Golden Guitar at the first Country Music Awards of Australia in 1973. Newton recalled an occasion when a friend used his outside toilet where the light globe had blown and reported he was lucky {{there was not a}} redback spider on the toilet seat. The phrase inspired him to write the song. [...] A sculpture of <b>an</b> <b>impossibly</b> large redback, one of Australia's big things, was built in 1996 at Eight Mile Plains, Queensland. The Angels 1991 album Red Back Fever takes its name from the spider. Matilda Bay Brewing Company produces a wheat beer called Redback, with the distinctive red stripe as the logo. The redback appears in the name and emblem of the South Australia cricket team. The Airborne Redback, an Australian ultralight trike, was also named after the spider. Redback Boots is an Australian workboot manufacturing company, which uses the spider in its name and logo. In 2006 a redback spider stamp was designed as part of a [...] "Dangerous Australians" [...] stamp series, but was withheld from general circulation by Australia Post due to concerns that the realistic depiction would scare people opening their letter boxes.|$|E
