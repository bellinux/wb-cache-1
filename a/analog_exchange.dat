50|$|From the {{communist}} era Poland inherited an underdeveloped and outmoded system of telephones, with some areas (e.g. {{in the extreme}} South East) being served by manual exchanges. In December 2005 the last <b>analog</b> <b>exchange</b> was shut down. All telephone lines are now served by modern fully computerized exchanges (Siemens EWSD, Alcatel S12, Lucent 5ESS, Alcatel E10). The former state owned telephone monopoly (TPSA) has been mostly privatized, with France Telecom buying the largest share. Various other companies have entered the fixed phone market, but generally aiming for niches (e.g. Sferia with fixed wireless, Netia covering primarily business). Whilst prices have reduced and availability has increased considerably since the introduction of competition, there is little sign of TPSA's market share being seriously reduced.|$|E

The main features of these tools have been extended in CONNAN by means of a netlist analyzer, the interaction with a commercial CAD tool and a transistor model manager that solves some common problems of sizing tools based on electrical simulators.

40|$|Turbo {{decoding}} is a {{step towards}} ana- log because it uses soft-in/soft-out decoders. The {{next step is to}} go fully <b>analog</b> by <b>exchanging</b> extrinsic in- formation in continuous time ('flooding'). The component decoders are implemented in analog VLSI (a simple chip exists in 0. 25 /ra BiCMOS technology) and perform trellis or message passing decoding in continuous time while interconnected by an interleaver network. Simulation results for 'turbo' receivers with Hamming, tailbiting convolutional, DECPSK and multipath channel codes have shown that the performance is comparable with digital 'turbo' decoders. The advantage with analog 'turbo' networks is that they operate at much higher speed, have a smaller size and have much less power consumption than their digital counterparts...|$|R

50|$|Book {{swapping}} or book {{exchange is}} {{the practice of}} a swap of books between one person and another.

40|$|AbstractConvenient {{approaches}} {{were described}} to incorporate -OP(=O) O−-SS-O−(O=) PO- bridges in hairpin-shaped DNA duplexes instead of regular phosphodiester linkages: (i) H 2 O 2 - or 2, 2 ′-dipyridyldisulfide-mediated coupling of 3 ′- and 5 ′-thiophosphorylated oligonucleotides on complementary template and (ii) more selective template-guided autoligation of a preactivated oligonucleotide derivative with an oligomer carrying a terminal thiophosphoryl group. Dithiothreitol {{was found to}} cleave completely modified internucleotide linkage releasing starting oligonucleotides. The presence of complementary template as an intrinsic element of the molecule protects the hairpin DNA <b>analog</b> from spontaneous <b>exchange</b> of disulfide-linked oligomer fragments and makes it {{a good candidate for}} auto-crosslinking with cysteine-containing proteins...|$|R
40|$|We {{formulate}} kaon condensation {{in dense}} baryonic matter with anti-kaons fluctuating from the Fermi-liquid fixed point. This entails {{that in the}} Wilsonian RG approach, the decimation is effectuated in the baryonic sector to the Fermi surface while in the meson sector to the origin. In writing the kaon-baryon (KN) coupling, {{we will take a}} generalized hidden local symmetry Lagrangian for the meson sector endowed with a "mended symmetry" that has the unbroken symmetry limit at high density in which the Goldstone π, scalar s, and vectors ρ (and ω) and a_ 1 become massless. The vector mesons ρ (and ω) and a_ 1 can be identified as emergent (hidden) local gauge fields and the scalar s as the dilaton field of the spontaneously broken scale invariance at chiral restoration. In matter-free space, when the vector mesons and the scalar meson [...] whose masses are much greater than that of the pion [...] are integrated out, then the resulting KN coupling Lagrangian consists of the leading chiral order (O(p^ 1)) Weinberg-Tomozawa term and the next chiral order (O(p^ 2)) Σ_KN term. In addressing kaon condensation in dense nuclear matter in chiral perturbation theory (ChPT), one makes an expansion in the "small" Fermi momentum k_F. We argue that in the Wilsonian RG formalism with the Fermi-liquid fixed point, the expansion is on the contrary in 1 /k_F with the "large" Fermi momentum k_F. The kaon-quasinucleon interaction resulting from integrating out the massive mesons consists of a "relevant" term from the scalar <b>exchange</b> (<b>analog</b> to the Σ_KN term) and an "irrelevant" term from the vector-meson <b>exchange</b> (<b>analog</b> to the Weinberg-Tomozawa term). It is found that the critical density predicted by the latter approach, controlled by the relevant term, is three times less than that predicted by chiral perturbation theory.

40|$|In 2009, Belgium and the Netherlands {{announced}} {{a deal to}} send approximately 500 Belgian inmates to Dutch prisons, in exchange for an annual payment of £ 26 million. The arrangement was unprecedented, but justified as beneficial to both nations: Belgium had too many prisoners and not enough prisons, whereas the Netherlands had too many prisons and not enough prisoners. The deal {{has yet to be}} replicated, nor has it triggered sustained criticism or received significant scholarly treatment. This Article aims to fill this void by examining the exchange and its possible implications for a global market in prisoners and prison space. In the Article, I suggest three possible doctrinal and discursive frames through which we might view the Belgian-Dutch exchange: (1) prison labor in the context of globalized labor markets; (2) democracy, sovereignty, and the role of community in criminal punishment; and (3) international trade or the exchange and regulation of resources. Further, in focusing on U. S. <b>analogs</b> to this <b>exchange,</b> I emphasize that this ostensibly unique treaty bears much in common with contemporary carceral policy. I argue that this exchange is actually emblematic of a departure from traditional 2 ̆ 2 theories of punishment 2 ̆ 2 and represents a normalization of the prison as a staple of social and economic life...|$|R
40|$|The phase {{equilibrium}} relations of four systems were investigated in detail. These consisted of sodium and potassium antimonates with antimony oxide and tantalum and niobium oxide with rubidium oxide {{as far as}} the ratio 4 Rb 2 O:llB 2 O 5 (B=Nb, Ta). The ternary system NaSbO 3 -Sb 2 O 4 -NaF was investigated extensively to determine the actual composition of the body centered cubic sodium antimonate. Various other binary and ternary oxide systems involving alkali oxides were examined in lesser detail. The phases synthesized were screened by ion exchange methods to determine mobility of the mobility of the alkali ion within the niobium, tantalum or antimony oxide (fluoride) structural framework. Five structure types warranted further investigation; these structure types are (1) hexagonal tungsten bronze (HTB), (2) pyrochlore, (3) the hybrid HTB-pyrochlore hexagonal ordered phases, (4) body centered cubic antimonates and (5) 2 K 2 O: 3 Nb 2 O 5. Although all of these phases exhibit good ion exchange properties only the pyrochlore was prepared with Na(+) ions as an equilibrium phase and as a low porosity ceramic. Sb(+ 3) in the channel interferes with ionic conductivity in this case, although relatively good ionic conductivity was found for the metastable Na(+) ion <b>exchanged</b> <b>analogs</b> of RbTa 2 O 5 F and KTaWO 6 pyrochlore phases...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{structural}} {{characterization of}} sulfatides by collisional-activated dissociation (CAD) quadrupole ion-trap tandem mass spectrometric methods with electrospray ionization is described. When subjected to CAD in the negative-ion mode, the [M − H]− ions of sulfatides yield abundant structurally informative ions that permit unequivocal assignments of the long-chain base, and fatty acid constituent including {{the location of}} double bond. The identification {{of the position of}} the double bond on the fatty acyl substituent is based on the observation of the series of the ions arising from classical charge-remote fragmentation processes similar to those observed by high-energy CAD and by tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry. An unusual internal galactose residue loss due to a rearrangement process was also observed. The [M − H]− ions of sulfatides also dissociates to a ceramide anion, which undergoes consecutive fragmentation processes to yield ions informative for identification of the ceramide moiety and permits distinction the sulfatide with a sphingosine subclass from that with a sphinganine long-chain base subclass. The MS 2 -spectra of the sulfatide subclass with a sphingosine LCB and a α-hydroxy fatty acyl substituent (d 18 : 1 /hFA-sulfatide) are featured by the prominent ion sets of m/z 568, 550, 540, and 522, originated from a primary cleavage of the fatty acyl COCH(OH) bond, and are readily differentiable from those arising from the non-hydroxy sulfatide subclass (d 18 : 1 /nFA-sulfatide), in which the ion sets are of low abundance. The fragmentation pathways of sulfatides under low-energy CAD are proposed. The pathways are supported by the MS 2 - and MS 3 -spectra of various compounds, and of their H-D <b>exchanged</b> <b>analogs...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractElectrospray {{ionization}} (ESI) and collisionally induced dissociation (CID) mass spectra {{were obtained}} for five tetracyclines and the corresponding compounds in which the labile hydrogens were replaced by deuterium by either gas phase or liquid phase exchange. The number of labile hydrogens, x, could easily be determined from a comparison of ESI spectra obtained with N 2 and with ND 3 as the nebulizer gas. CID mass spectra {{were obtained for}} [M + H]+ and [M − H]− ions and the <b>exchanged</b> <b>analogs,</b> [M(Dx) + D]+ and [M(Dx) − D]−, and produced by ESI using a Sciex API-IIIplus and a Finnigan LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer. Compositions of product ions and mechanisms of decomposition were determined by comparison of the MSN spectra of the un-deuterated and deuterated species. Protonated tetracyclines dissociate initially by loss of H 2 O (D 2 O) and NH 3 (ND 3) {{if there is a}} tertiary OH at C- 6. The loss of H 2 O (D 2 O) is the lower energy process. Tetracyclines without the tertiary OH at C- 6 lose only NH 3 (ND 3) initially. MSN experiments showed easily understandable losses of HDO, HN(CH 3) 2, CH 3 − NCH 2, and CO from fragment ions. The major fragment ions do not come from cleavage reactions of the species protonated at the most basic site. Deprotonated tetracyclines had similar CID spectra, with less fragmentation than those observed for the protonated tetracyclines. The lowest energy decomposition paths for the deprotonated tetracyclines are the competitive loss of NH 3 (ND 3) or HNCO (DNCO). Product ions appear to be formed by charge remote decompositions of species de-protonated at the C- 10 phenol...|$|R
40|$|Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are {{bio-inspired}} {{models of}} neural computation that have proven highly effective. Still, ANNs lack a natural notion of time, and neural units in ANNs <b>exchange</b> <b>analog</b> values in a frame-based manner, a computationally and energetically inefficient form of communication. This {{contrasts sharply with}} biological neurons that communicate sparingly and efficiently using binary spikes. While artificial Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) can be constructed by replacing the units of an ANN with spiking neurons, the current performance is far from that of deep ANNs on hard benchmarks and these SNNs use much higher firing rates compared to their biological counterparts, limiting their efficiency. Here we show how spiking neurons that employ an efficient form of neural coding {{can be used to}} construct SNNs that match high-performance ANNs and exceed state-of-the-art in SNNs on important benchmarks, while requiring much lower average firing rates. For this, we use spike-time coding based on the firing rate limiting adaptation phenomenon observed in biological spiking neurons. This phenomenon can be captured in adapting spiking neuron models, for which we derive the effective transfer function. Neural units in ANNs trained with this transfer function can be substituted directly with adaptive spiking neurons, and the resulting Adaptive SNNs (AdSNNs) can carry out inference in deep neural networks using up to an order of magnitude fewer spikes compared to previous SNNs. Adaptive spike-time coding additionally allows for the dynamic control of neural coding precision: we show how a simple model of arousal in AdSNNs further halves the average required firing rate and this notion naturally extends to other forms of attention. AdSNNs thus hold promise as a novel and efficient model for neural computation that naturally fits to temporally continuous and asynchronous applications...|$|R
40|$|The {{presented}} thesis work {{is concerned}} with the study of molecular dynamics using liquid nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Spin relaxation dispersion experiments in the rotating frame (R 1 ρ) are employed to provide a detailed, atomic-resolution view of protein dynamics. Comprehensive investigations of 15 N backbone and 13 C methyl side-chain conformational exchange in the FK 506 binding protein, FKBP 12, were carried out. The human enzyme FKBP 12 catalyzes the cis-trans isomerization of peptidyl-prolyl linkages in proteins, thereby increasing the rate of protein folding. Recombinant protein production with 13 C/ 2 H-enrichment yielded 13 CHD 2 isotopomers and allowed for development of novel R 1 ρ experiments aimed to characterize the methyl-bearing side-chains. The joint analysis of backbone and side-chain dynamics revealed a collective conformational exchange process with a correlation time of 121 ± 26 microseconds in the free enzyme. The locations of the exchanging nuclei showed close correspondence with residues previously shown to be important for the catalytic activity, which emphasize the connection between protein function and dynamics. The FKBP 12 isomerase activity is strongly inhibited by the small organic molecule FK 506. In addition, the bound conformation of FK 506 exhibit distinct structural transition state <b>analog</b> characteristics. Conformational <b>exchange</b> dynamics studies of the FKBP 12 – FK 506 complex demonstrated a striking rigidity of the backbone atoms, in line with the established theory that the transition state is more constrained than the free state. Conformational exchange dynamics found for peripheral methyl groups is suggested {{to play a role in}} the subsequent binding of the FKBP 12 – FK 506 complex to other target molecules. A specific isotope labeling strategy using [1 - 13 C]-glucose was shown to produce isolated 13 C nuclei in the side-chains of Phe/Tyr/Trp/His. Proteins with this characteristic labeling provide nuclei amenable to R 1 ρ experiments, which were previously excluded from analysis due to complications arising from uniform carbon labeling. The method thus extended the collection of dynamic probes to include the frequently occurring and often functionally important aromatic side-chains. R 1 ρ studies of the C-terminal part of a mutant Calmodulin protein revealed microsecond time scale dynamics contributions to Tyr 80 C δ, confirming previous reports of conformational exchange present for the protein backbone nuclei. Detection of conformational exchange in isotropic media requires a chemical shift difference between the exchanging states. However, such chemical shift difference can be replaced by differential residual dipolar couplings (RDC) in the exchanging states for molecules dissolved in partially aligning media. The RDC-induced contribution to the exchange-free transverse relaxation rate can be suppressed using relaxation dispersion experiments, thus revealing details of the conformational exchange characteristics. The theory was described, and the method was demonstrated using the model molecule N,N -dimethyltrichloroacetamide...|$|R
