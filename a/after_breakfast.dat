Prisoners were sent to work before and <b>after</b> <b>breakfast</b> (in their cells), before assembling for muster at midday. This was followed by dinner in the exercise yard or the work site, and more work throughout the afternoon, until supper at 6:00 pm in the cells. Night officers took over at 7:15 pm.|$|E
5|$|The {{politician}} Lord Granville {{was offered}} the post of Lord Warden by the new Prime Minister, John Russell in 1865. Russell noted that the role would be expensive for Granville to perform — the salary had been abolished in 1828 — but that it would provide him with a property by the sea, which Granville had been seeking to acquire for a while. Granville took over Walmer in 1865. He expanded the gardens, built new kennels for a hunting pack and spent many years reassembling the furniture and other objects that Pitt and Wellington had used at the castle. He received large numbers of visitors, many of whom stopped off while travelling to or from France. The diplomat Baron de Malortie visited Granville and his family at Walmer, and later praised the homely atmosphere in the castle. He described how, <b>after</b> <b>breakfast,</b> the family and guests would all gather in the drawing room, which was the only large room in the house, and Granville would answer government correspondence amid the daily life {{of the rest of}} the household.|$|E

25|$|Hankey {{tried to}} {{institute}} weekly breakfasts between Lloyd George and Robertson, but these had failed as Lloyd George liked to sit talking {{for a long}} time <b>after</b> <b>breakfast.</b> Although he cultivated a myth that he never read, Lloyd George was in fact a very early riser, who would have already have completed much of the day's paperwork before breakfast, and therefore preferred to do business at breakfast meetings rather than in the evening. Austen Chamberlain found the practice equally irritating.|$|E
25|$|As {{reported}} by Wright's apprentices at Taliesin, Kaufmann Sr. was in Milwaukee on September 22, {{nine months after}} their initial meeting, and called Wright at home early Sunday morning to surprise him {{with the news that}} he would be visiting Wright that day, before lunch. He could not wait to see Wright's plans. Wright had told Kaufmann in earlier communication that he had been working on the plans, but had not actually drawn anything. <b>After</b> <b>breakfast</b> that morning, amid a group of very nervous apprentices, Wright calmly drew the plans in the two hours in which it took Kaufmann to drive to Taliesin.|$|E

25|$|<b>After</b> <b>breakfast,</b> the Prince, {{accompanied}} by the playful Bendicò, goes into his office, which is lined with century-old paintings of the Salina family's estates. As he sits at his cluttered desk, the Prince recalls how much he dislikes both {{the room and the}} work it represents. This dislike intensifies during visits from his accountant and one of his tenants, both of whom are allied with the Redshirts. Both of them assure the Prince that the unification of Italy will be peaceful and will benefit everyone, including the nobility. The Prince allows himself to be reassured, certain that the class system will remain unchanged no matter what. The Prince's visit to the Salina chaplain, Father Pirrone, atop a tower where the men practice their joint hobby of astronomy, reinforces this belief.|$|E
25|$|The next day, March 21, Wilder {{approached}} Terry Walden, a 23-year-old wife, mother, {{and nursing}} student at Lamar University in Beaumont, Texas, about {{posing as a}} model. She turned him down, but disappeared on March 23. Wilder stabbed her to death and dumped her body in a canal, where it was found on March 26. After killing Walden, Wilder fled in her rust-colored 1981 Mercury Cougar. On March 25 Wilder abducted 21-year-old Suzanne Logan at the Penn Square Mall in Oklahoma City. Wilder took her 180 miles north to Newton, Kansas, and checked into room 30 of the I-35 Inn. <b>After</b> <b>breakfast</b> the next morning, he drove to Milford Reservoir, 90 miles northeast of Newton near Junction City, Kansas, where he stabbed her to death and dumped her body under a cedar tree.|$|E
25|$|The Orissa Gazette of 1956 {{mentions}} some occasions {{where the}} devadasis danced. They had two daily rituals. The Bahar Gaaunis would {{dance at the}} Sakaala Dhupa. Lord Jagannath, <b>after</b> <b>breakfast,</b> would give Darshan to the bhaktas (the devotees). In the Main hall, a devadasi accompanied by musicians and the Rajguru, the court guru, would dance, standing near the Garuda sthambha (pillar). This dance could be watched by the audience. They would perform only pure dance here. The Bhitar Gaunis would sing at the Badashringhar, the main ceremony for ornamenting and dressing the God. Lord Jagannath, at bedtime, would be first served by male Sebaets- they would fan Him and decorate Him with flowers. After they would leave, a Bhitar Gaauni would then enter the room, stand near the door (Jaya Vijay) and sing Gita Govinda songs, and perhaps perform a ritualistic dance. After a while, she would come out and announce that the Lord has gone to sleep and then the guard would close the main gate.|$|E

60|$|On {{the next}} morning, after a sharp frost, {{the sun shone}} brightly as in spring. Fan was up early and enjoyed her breakfast, {{notwithstanding}} the late supper, {{and not in the}} least disturbed by the scornful words flung at her by the housemaid when she brought up the tray. <b>After</b> <b>breakfasting</b> she went to Miss Starbrow's room, to find her still in bed and not inclined to get up.|$|R
25|$|On December 30, the Union force {{moved into}} line two miles (threekm) {{northwest}} of Murfreesboro. The two armies were in parallel lines, about four miles (sixkm) long, oriented from southwest to northeast. Bragg's left flank was weak at the start, and Rosecrans could have attacked {{there when he}} arrived and wheeled left, around the flank and directly into the town of Murfreesboro, {{but he did not}} know the full disposition of Bragg's forces because of the skillful screening of the Confederate cavalry during the Union march. In a manner similar to the previous year's First Battle of Bull Run, both commanders devised similar plans for the following day: envelop the enemy's right, get into his rear, and cut him off from his base. Since both plans were the same, the victory would probably go to the side that was able to attack first. Rosecrans ordered his men to be ready to attack <b>after</b> <b>breakfast,</b> but Bragg ordered an attack at dawn.|$|E
500|$|Blyton's {{daily routine}} varied little over the years. She usually began writing soon <b>after</b> <b>breakfast,</b> with her {{portable}} typewriter {{on her knee}} and her favourite red Moroccan shawl nearby; she believed that the colour red acted as a [...] "mental stimulus" [...] for her. Stopping only for a short lunch break she continued writing until five o'clock, by which time she would usually have produced 6,000–10,000 words.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after midnight}} on 26/27 September, Allenby issued orders for Chauvel's Desert Mounted Corps to {{continue}} the pursuit. The Australian Mounted Division in the Tiberias area, followed by the 5th Cavalry Division at Nazareth, were to advance along the main road to Damascus [...] away, around {{the northern end of}} the Sea of Galilee via Quneitra. At 06:00 on 27 September, the 4th Light Horse Brigade left the village and arrived at Tiberias two hours later. They then received two days' supplies and one day's iron ration, which were to last until <b>after</b> <b>breakfast</b> on 29 September. At 10:00, they began the pursuit to Damascus.|$|E

The next morning, <b>after</b> <b>breakfast</b> at Tiffany's, Rachel and Kurt (Chris Colfer) sneak onto the stage of Wicked and sing a duet of [...] "For Good". Rachel realizes that her true love is Broadway and they vow to return to New York City for college.|$|E
500|$|A {{few days}} later William Wordsworth with his brother John and their friend Mr Simpson made a trip up Helvellyn, setting out <b>after</b> <b>breakfast</b> and {{returning}} home at ten that evening. A year later, in October 1801, William and his sister Dorothy rode to Legburthwaite (to the inn at Thirlspot) {{and then to the}} top of Helvellyn before returning the same way. Dorothy recorded that it had been a glorious day. They had mists both above and below them, but the sun shone through and their views extended from the Scottish mountains to the sea at Cartmel. Wordsworth’s poem, Inmate of a mountain dwelling (1816), celebrating the captivating power of the old mountain, was dedicated [...] "To … on her first ascent to the summit of Helvellyn." ...|$|E
500|$|Beach and Henry {{arrived back}} in New London at 5:45A.M. on 5 February. Later that morning, <b>after</b> <b>breakfast,</b> Beach briefed his officers, whom Beach had insisted needed to know, about their new {{shakedown}} orders {{and the mission}} objectives for Operation Sandblast. [...] The officers and crew of Triton had just 12 days to complete preparations for their much more ambitious, but top secret, shakedown cruise. With the exception of Chief Quartermaster (QMC) William J. Marshall, the enlisted personnel did not initially know {{the true nature of}} their upcoming mission. [...] A cover story was devised that, following the shakedown cruise, Triton would proceed to the Caribbean Sea to undergo additional testing required by BuShips. The crew and civilian personnel were also instructed to file their federal income taxes early and take care of all other personal finances that might arise through mid-May.|$|E
40|$|To {{study the}} effect of diet on 8 -MOP plasma levels, these levels were {{measured}} three times in twenty PUVA patients with psoriasis; while fasting, <b>after</b> a low-fat <b>breakfast,</b> and <b>after</b> a fat-rich <b>breakfast.</b> No {{significant differences were found}} between the maximal 8 -MOP plasma levels in the fasting condition and the levels <b>after</b> the low-fat <b>breakfast,</b> both peaking 2 h after ingestion. <b>After</b> the fat-rich <b>breakfast,</b> however, the 8 -MOP plasma levels were not only significantly lower at 2 h but also peaked later, reaching their maximum at 3 - 4 h after intake. The drug should therefore be given in a dietetically standardized way. This raises the question whether some cases of therapy resistance can be dietetically influenced. status: publishe...|$|R
60|$|<b>After</b> <b>breakfasting</b> the {{following}} morning {{we set out to}} see Kadabra, and as, through the generosity of the prince of Marentina, we were well supplied with the funds current in Okar we purchased a handsome ground flier.

60|$|<b>After</b> <b>breakfasting</b> {{we began}} to {{deliberate}} as to our future movements. Here we were at Cologne, in Prussia, with the wide world before us, uncertain whither to proceed. It was soon decided, however, that a first duty was to look again at the unfinished cathedral, that wonder of Gothic architecture; to make a pilgrimage {{to the house in}} which Rubens was born; to pay a visit to the eleven thousand virgins, and to buy some Cologne water: after which it would be time enough to determine where we should sleep.|$|R
500|$|What {{is certain}} is that the breed took its name from Clumber Park and that the Duke of Newcastle's gamekeeper, William Mansell, is {{credited}} with their development and improvement. Prince Albert, the Prince consort of Queen Victoria, was a fancier and promoter of the breed, as was his son King Edward VII, who bred them at the Sandringham estate in Norfolk. The breed was shown in England from 1859 onward. They are referred to in Queen Victoria's diary: on October 16, 1840, she wrote, [...] "Walked out directly <b>after</b> <b>breakfast</b> before Albert went to shoot. He had his 7 fine Clumber Spaniels with us and {{we went into the}} Slopes, with such a funny old Gamekeeper, Walters, in order that I should see how the dogs found out their game.

500|$|After a {{successful}} season for England in 1967, D'Oliveira {{was chosen to}} tour the West Indies in 1967–68; this raised awareness in England and South Africa {{that he was a}} realistic contender to tour South Africa a year later. However, his opportunities to excel were few in the West Indies; circumstances were against him in several matches, and he had a statistically poor tour. Any mitigating circumstances were offset by problems off the field. D'Oliveira took full advantage of the social opportunities available {{on a tour of the}} West Indies and frequently disappeared to parties and other events, often not reappearing until <b>after</b> <b>breakfast.</b> Rumours to this effect reached the press and the MCC tour manager spoke to D'Oliveira about his responsibilities on tour. D'Oliveira said that his behaviour and poor form were partly a result of the pressure placed on him. He was frequently questioned about the South African tour and about race—some groups in the West Indies accused him of [...] "selling out" [...] by playing for England's [...] "white" [...] team.|$|E
500|$|Crowley {{was born}} as Edward Alexander Crowley at 30 Clarendon Square in Royal Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, on 12 October 1875. His father, Edward Crowley (1834–87), was trained as an engineer, but his share in a lucrative family brewing business, Crowley's Alton Ales, had {{allowed him to}} retire before his son was born. His mother, Emily Bertha Bishop (1848–1917), came from a Devonshire-Somerset family and had a {{strained}} relationship with her son; she described him as [...] "the Beast", a name that he revelled in. The couple had been married at London's Kensington Registry Office in November 1874, and were evangelical Christians. Crowley's father had been born a Quaker, but had converted to the Exclusive Brethren, a faction of a Christian fundamentalist group known as the Plymouth Brethren, with Emily joining him upon marriage. Crowley's father was particularly devout, spending his time as a travelling preacher for the sect and reading a chapter from the Bible {{to his wife and}} son <b>after</b> <b>breakfast</b> every day. Following the death of their baby daughter in 1880, in 1881 the Crowleys moved to Redhill, Surrey. At the age of 8, Crowley was sent to H.T. Habershon's evangelical Christian boarding school in Hastings, and then to Ebor preparatory school in Cambridge, run by the Reverend Henry d'Arcy Champney, whom Crowley considered a sadist.|$|E
