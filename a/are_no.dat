40|$|This paper entertains {{the notion}} that without their {{opposite}}s, things, and by extension, human thought would not exist. Without its opposite aspect, each thing or thought loses the condition for its existence. Without life, there would <b>be</b> <b>no</b> death; without death, there would <b>be</b> <b>no</b> life. Without "above", there would <b>be</b> <b>no</b> "below " without "below", there would <b>be</b> <b>no</b> "above".

Without landlords, there would <b>be</b> <b>no</b> tenants; without tenants, there would <b>be</b> <b>no</b> landlords. A definition of a thing, entity or a concept necessarily implies its opposite.
