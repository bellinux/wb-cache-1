5|$|<b>As</b> <b>an</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{time-consuming}} task {{of creating}} a breach, an escalade could be attempted to capture the walls with fighting along the walkways behind the battlements.

Once ditches around a castle were partially filled in, these wooden, movable towers could be pushed against the curtain wall. As well as offering some protection for those inside, a siege tower could overlook {{the interior of a}} castle, giving bowmen an advantageous position from which to unleash missiles.|$|E

Zinc and cadmium are commonly used as anti-corrosion (galvanization) agents as they will attract all local oxidation until they completely corrode. These protective coatings can be applied to other metals through by hot-dip galvanizing a substance into the molten form of the metal, or through the process of electroplating which may be passivated by the use of chromate salts. Group 12 elements are also used in electrochemistry as they may act <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> standard hydrogen electrode {{in addition to being a}} secondary reference electrode.|$|E
