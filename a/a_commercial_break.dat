5|$|The {{crowd in}} the stands, the {{opposing}} players and all four umpires gave Ripken a standing ovation lasting more than 22 minutes, {{one of the longest}} standing ovations for any athlete; ESPN did not go to <b>a</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>break</b> during the entire ovation. During the ovation, Ripken did a lap around the entire Camden Yards warning track to shake hands and give high-fives to the fans.|$|E
5|$|On the January 2, 2006 {{episode of}} Raw, Maria was {{attacked}} and stripped {{of her clothes}} by Vince's Devils (Victoria, Torrie Wilson, and Candice Michelle), but she was saved by Ashley Massaro. During <b>a</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>break</b> that night, Vince McMahon announced a Gauntlet Bra & Panties Match for New Year's Revolution between all five girls.

5|$|Traditionally {{the contest}} {{will consist of}} an opening {{ceremony}} in which the performers are welcomed to the event, the performances of the entries, a recap of the songs to help televoting viewers decide which entries to vote for, an interval act usually performed after the televoting has closed, {{the results of the}} televoting or back-up jury voting which is then followed by the declaration of the winner and a reprise of the winning song. At various points throughout the show, networks may opt out for a few minutes to screen <b>a</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>break.</b>|$|E
5|$|Initial {{candidates}} {{to host the}} program included Soupy Sales, host of children's variety shows in the 1950s and 1960s, and comedian Dana Carvey. After Nickelodeon determined Sales to be too old for the role, and Carvey was offered a chance to audition for Saturday Night Live, {{the search for a}} host continued. Producers viewed over 1,000 applicants from Los Angeles and New York. First attending a tryout in lieu of a friend, and later passing multiple auditions, television warm-up comedian Marc Summers was one of two finalists advancing to a final audition. Each hosted a mock game for Nickelodeon to make an ultimate decision on who would host Double Dare. The producers felt the way Summers ended the game by leading into <b>a</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>break</b> was more professional and he was hired for the position {{in the first week of}} September 1986. Because focus groups showed that the audience thought he was more than 10 years younger than he actually was, Summers was obligated by Nickelodeon for years to not mention his age publicly.|$|E
5|$|Kesler {{played his}} {{first game of the}} season on February 15 against the Dallas Stars. The game was also witness to a piece of Canucks history as Henrik Sedin {{recorded}} two assists to pass Markus Naslund as the franchise's all-time leading scorer, with 757 points. After recording the record setting point, Sedin was given a standing ovation that carried on as play continued. After three minutes the play stopped, and Sedin saluted the crowd. During <b>a</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>break,</b> the Canucks ran a tribute video for the accomplishment, featuring congratulations from Naslund and Trevor Linden, the third-leading scorer in team history. As for Kesler, he registered an assist and blocked three shots in over 17 minutes of ice time of the 4–3 loss. After experiencing some discomfort in his right foot, Kesler had X-rays taken. The X-rays were negative and he continued to play.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the last}} {{act of the}} pilot for Dawson's Creek (and <b>a</b> short <b>commercial</b> <b>break)</b> concluded, <b>a</b> final 60-second clip montage aired {{featuring}} many of the network's previous stars, ending with this statement: ...|$|R
50|$|This {{was then}} {{followed}} by <b>a</b> final <b>commercial</b> <b>break</b> {{in which there}} was no final appearance by the famous eggcups, although they made their last appearance on Wednesday 30 December 1992. Instead, the final commercial was for GMTV.|$|R
5000|$|The final {{episode was}} shown without any {{commercial}} interruptions courtesy of GLOBE, {{a cellular phone}} company in the Philippines.

5|$|Wii Sports {{has been}} {{featured}} on television multiple times. The game {{was featured in}} commercials for the Wii system, and in news features on ABC and NBC. The game has appeared on various comedy shows. An episode of Late Night with Conan O'Brien featured host Conan O'Brien competing against his guest, tennis star Serena Williams, in a match of Wii Sports tennis. On an episode of the Rick Mercer Report, former Canadian prime minister Jean Chrétien beat Rick Mercer {{in a game of}} Wii Sports boxing. The boxing game also appeared on an episode of The Colbert Report where a clip featured Mii versions of Stephen Colbert and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi boxing. At the 80th Academy Awards Show, host Jon Stewart and Jamia Simone Nash were caught playing Wii Sports tennis on one of the event's gigantic projection screens after <b>a</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>break</b> as part of a joke. Wii Sports has also been featured in mainstream movies such as Tropic Thunder and in commercials for products such as Kellogg's Smart Start.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{featured}} preliminary matches was Shawn Michaels versus Ric Flair in a singles match. The hype to this match began on May 26, 2003 during {{an episode of}} Raw, where Michaels challenged Flair to a singles match for later during the show, which Flair accepted. As the match {{was about to take}} place, the other General Manager, Eric Bischoff, announced that the Flair versus Michaels match was to take place at Bad Blood instead of on the broadcast of Raw. Later on that episode, Flair and Michaels lost to World Champion Triple H in a Handicap match after Flair cheap shoted Michaels, enabling Triple H to finish him off with the Pedigree. The following Monday on an episode of Raw, Michaels and Flair were in a promotional in-ring segment, where they both discussed who was the better wrestler. Later during the program, Michaels, along with Kevin Nash and The Hurricane defeated Evolution. The feud between Flair and Michaels enhanced on the June 9, 2003 episode of Raw. During the show, Flair and Michaels managed Randy Orton and The Hurricane, respectively; after Orton defeated The Hurricane, Flair and Michaels were scripted to brawl until the program went into <b>a</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>break.</b>|$|E

5000|$|From time to time, The CW Television Network airs short {{programming}} breaks called [...] "Content Wraps", {{to advertise}} one company's product during <b>an</b> entire <b>commercial</b> <b>break.</b> The CW pioneered [...] "content wraps" [...] and some products featured were Herbal Essences, Crest, Guitar Hero II, CoverGirl, and recently Toyota.|$|R
5000|$|At this point, Alasdair MacMillan, the {{director}} of the television production, cued the orchestra to play music for <b>an</b> unscripted <b>commercial</b> <b>break</b> (noticeable because of several seconds of blank screen while LWT's master control contacted regional stations to start transmitting advertisements) and Tarbuck's manager tried to pull Cooper back through the curtains.|$|R
50|$|Unusually, {{the series}} aired in a 25-minute time-slot, and was {{followed}} by a 5-minute series titled The Children's Doctor. Since it was a daytime series, it featured more advertising than a prime-time series of the same period, with <b>a</b> 1-minute <b>commercial</b> <b>break</b> approximately every 5 minutes, plus plugs for the providers of prizes.|$|R
25|$|A {{limited number}} of time-outs, clock {{stoppages}} requested by a coach (or sometimes mandated in the NBA) for a short meeting with the players, are allowed. They generally last no longer than one minute (100 seconds in the NBA) unless, for televised games, <b>a</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>break</b> is needed.|$|E
25|$|On 2 November 2012, as Henry {{was telling}} the story of how he had injured his finger the {{previous}} day, his co-presenters and crew slowly left the set, until Henry was left sitting on his own at the desk, in the dark. He got up and left, before the show cut to <b>a</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>break,</b> after which everybody had returned.|$|E
25|$|In {{anticipation}} of the 2014 film Maleficent, a cover version sung by Lana Del Rey was released by Disney on January 26. The song is considerably darker and more dramatic than the 1959 version, given the new film's focus on the villain Maleficent. The song was debuted in a trailer for the film shown as <b>a</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>break</b> during the 2014 Grammy Awards, and was released for free on Google Play for a limited time.|$|E
50|$|The channel airs promos {{featuring}} its mascot, four letters modded after a pig that {{spell the}} word Çufo. The title {{and the music}} of the channel are based on a famous 1982 Albanian cartoon, Ndodhitë e Çufos (Çufo's events). Occasionally, <b>a</b> small <b>commercial</b> <b>break</b> with one sponsor will be included as well. No commercials or promos are shown between shows, but rather after them.|$|R
5000|$|Woolery {{created his}} {{trademark}} phrase, [...] "two and two" [...] on Love Connection (and simultaneously on Scrabble, the daytime game show he hosted on NBC {{during the same}} period). The line referred {{to the fact that}} the program would return in two minutes and two seconds, the total length of <b>a</b> standard <b>commercial</b> <b>break</b> at the time, including the fade-out and fade-ins bookending each break.|$|R
50|$|During a rain {{delay in}} the 2012 Federated Auto Parts 400, WJLA-TV in Washington, DC {{cut out of the}} ESPN on ABC {{broadcast}} of the race to air the primetime local news and did not return to the race broadcast when the race resumed. After running the newscast, WJLA went to <b>a</b> local <b>commercial</b> <b>break</b> and then rejoined the race broadcast at 11:46pm, several minutes after the race resumed.|$|R
25|$|CBS then {{rejoined the}} {{telecast}} of ATWT during <b>a</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>break,</b> which {{was followed by}} show announcer Dan McCullough's usual fee plug {{for the first half}} of the program and the network's 1:45 pm station identification break. Just before the second half of ATWT was to begin, the network broke in with the bumper slide a second time. In this bulletin Cronkite reported in greater detail about the assassination attempt on the President, while also breaking the news of Governor Connally's shooting.|$|E
25|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} was {{directed}} by Wayne Isham and was shot in Los Angeles in December 2008. It is available for digital download on iTunes and is featured on the DVD of the Deluxe Edition of All I Ever Wanted. A preview of the video was shown during <b>a</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>break</b> for American Idol on January 28, 2009. The full video then premiered via AT's website directly after the broadcast. The video was subsequently nominated for a 2009 MTV Video Music Award in the category for Best Female Video.|$|E
25|$|Pryor co-hosted the Academy Awards {{twice and}} was {{nominated}} for an Emmy for a guest role on the television series Chicago Hope. Network censors had warned Pryor about his profanity for the Academy Awards, and after a slip early in the program, a five-second delay was instituted when returning from <b>a</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>break.</b> Pryor {{is also one of}} only three Saturday Night Live hosts to be subjected to a rare five-second delay for his 1975 appearance (along with Sam Kinison in 1986 and Andrew Dice Clay in 1990).|$|E
50|$|The Lost World: Jurassic Park is a 1997 {{science fiction}} film and sequel to Jurassic Park, {{loosely based on}} Crichton's novel. The film was <b>a</b> <b>commercial</b> success, <b>breaking</b> many box-office records when released. It {{has a number of}} plot {{differences}} from the novel and incorporates scenes from the first novel that were not previously filmed. The film received mixed reviews, however.|$|R
50|$|The {{critical}} {{reaction to the}} album was mixed. Many reviews commented that Steinman's singing voice was inadequate for the songs. Despite this, the album was <b>a</b> major <b>commercial</b> success, <b>breaking</b> the UK Top 10.|$|R
5000|$|NBC {{was also}} criticized by fans for {{incorporating}} long <b>commercial</b> <b>breaks</b> during the race, {{much longer than}} the breaks that Fox would run during its race telecasts. Two glaring problems with the NBC coverage were that restarts were often missed due to these extended <b>commercial</b> <b>breaks,</b> that breaks during green flag runs were too frequent. Fans and media columnists used [...] "Nothing But Commercials," [...] as a jocular acronym for NBC's coverage. This cliché was mocked in the film Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby, during {{a scene in which}} NBC is shown to take <b>a</b> quick <b>commercial</b> <b>break</b> during <b>a</b> race (with <b>a</b> <b>commercial</b> for Applebee's) when Ricky Bobby (Will Ferrell) and Jean Girard (Sacha Baron Cohen) wreck their cars in a very long-lasting crash (NBC's announcing team at the time of Weber, Dallenbach and Parsons had cameos during the scene covering the fictional race).|$|R
25|$|In {{the first}} season, each episode {{opens with a}} teaser {{featuring}} clips from the episode (or generic footage from other episodes) and a voice-over introduction by Beaumont briefly stating the episode's theme. The teaser {{is followed by the}} main title and credits in which the show's four main stars are introduced. Midway through the first season, the Beaumont voice-over introduction was discarded in favor of a brief scene extracted from the episode at hand, and, {{at the end of the}} first season, the teaser was entirely discarded, moving immediately to the title and credits. In seasons five and six, significant crew are listed in an extension of the opening credits after <b>a</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>break.</b>|$|E
25|$|Jimmy hosts {{a long-running}} quiz show called What Do Kids Know? and is dying of cancer; {{he has only}} a few months to live. That night the newest child prodigy on the show, Stanley Spector, takes the lead as the show begins. He is hounded by his father for the prize money and demeaned by the {{surrounding}} adults, who refuse to let him use the bathroom during <b>a</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>break.</b> When the show resumes, he wets himself and freezes, humiliated when everyone realizes what happened. As the show continues an inebriated Jimmy sickens, and he orders the show to go on after he collapses onstage. But after Stanley's father berates him for freezing on air, Stanley refuses to return for the final round.|$|E
25|$|By November 2006, Kip and B.G. {{began to}} show displeasure in TNA and {{threatened}} to go find work elsewhere {{if they did not}} receive gold soon. They began performing the crotch chop, a reference to the WWE's DX. On the November 2 edition of Impact!, Kip and B.G. threatened to quit. Kip grabbed the mic and tried to say something to the TNA administration and Spike TV, but each time his mic was cut off. Kip then tried to use the announcer's headset, but it was cut off as well. Frustrated, he started yelling loudly to the crowd, but he was cut off again as the show went to <b>a</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>break.</b> When the show returned, the announcers speculated that they may have been frustrated due to the influx of new talent entering TNA. It was reported that the segment was a worked shoot that Vince Russo had written in order to renew interest upon their eventual return. Kip and BG appeared in an internet video on TNA's website where they addressed the owner of WWE Vince McMahon.|$|E
50|$|The {{centralized}} TV deal caused consternation {{among many}} longtime NASCAR fans. The biggest criticisms include <b>an</b> increase in <b>commercial</b> <b>breaks,</b> {{emphasis on the}} more popular drivers and teams {{to the exclusion of}} others, and the de-emphasis of actual racing coverage in exchange for more fluff and hype.|$|R
500|$|Critics panned the play, ridiculing the plot, dialogue, and Bara's acting. Theater {{historian}} Ward Morehouse {{called it}} [...] "one {{of the worst}} plays ever written". Bara's movie fame drew large crowds to theaters, and the play was <b>a</b> <b>commercial</b> success, <b>breaking</b> attendance records at some venues. Ruth Gordon was Bara's only Broadway role, and The Blue Flame {{was one of her}} last professional acting projects.|$|R
50|$|In 2006, singer Cream {{started an}} {{argument}} with the host Gabriel Cotabiţă because {{she was on the}} festival's program but did not actually appear on stage. Maria Dragomiroiu, Mihai Trăistariu, Simplu and Morandi have publicly expressed their disgust regarding the fact that they performed live on stage but their show was not aired on TV due to <b>a</b> mid-show <b>commercial</b> <b>break.</b> Allegedly, they had not been told that their performance would not be aired on TV.|$|R
