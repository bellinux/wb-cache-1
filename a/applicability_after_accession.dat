40|$|This {{essay is}} {{concerned}} with the long term period, i. e. what will happen <b>after</b> <b>accession</b> to the EU. For those long term analyses, it is practical to identify different phases <b>after</b> <b>accession</b> to the EU - the period before the anticipated participation in the ERM II, the period of participation in the ERM II and the period of membership in the eurozone. These periods bring different costs, benefits and risks and they allow for different possibilities of economic policy, especially monetary policy (exchange rate policy included). The five following issues are dealt with in this essay: the speed of joining the eurozone <b>after</b> <b>accession</b> to the EU, the danger of speculative attacks on local currencies while participating in the ERM II, instability of public finances and its impact, possible real price shocks with their economic consequences and economic growth for convergence with the EU average.

40|$|Consider a small economy facing {{accession}} to a exogenously defined trade agreement. Before accession, the government controls trade and pollution policy. <b>After</b> <b>accession,</b> it retains control over pollution policy, but must allow free trade in all goods. This {{is a choice}} many governments face while joining trade agreements today. They decide whether greater market access to other members is more valuable than control over trade policy. I ask two questions. All else being equal what happens to environmental policy <b>after</b> <b>accession?</b> Second, what affects the choice of accession and how does this choice impact aggregate welfare? I show that a loss in control over trade policy alters the political incentives determining environmental policy. Before accession, producers can transfer {{a portion of their}} burden of environmental regulation to consumers through price increases. <b>After</b> <b>accession</b> the same regulation is borne entirely by producers. Owing to the change in burden, there exist plausible conditions under which the adoption of free trade can lead to more stringent environmental regulation, a reduction in the preferential treatment of special interest groups, and an increase in aggregate welfare. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{establishment}} of a Cooperation and Verification Mechanism for monitoring Bulgaria’s and Romania’s progress {{in the areas of}} judiciary and fight against corruption not only confirms the evolutionary nature of EU conditionality, but introduces a new feature, that of post-accession conditionality. More than three years <b>after</b> <b>accession,</b> neither Bulgaria nor Romania have managed to tackle the remaining issues and the scrupulous monitoring mechanism is still maintained. What are the main features and limitations of post-accession conditionality? Why does the effectiveness of EU conditionality deteriorate <b>after</b> <b>accession?</b> The article outlines a conceptual framework for comparative study of pre-accession and post-accession conditionality. On the basis of a stage-structured conditionality model, it discusses the transformations of the main elements of conditionality before and <b>after</b> <b>accession</b> and argues that the absence of accession advancement rewards combined with toothless explicit threats for sanctioning non-compliance produce very weak negative incentive structure which undermines the effectiveness of post-accession conditionality. The study, which draws on extensive interviews with senior EU officials and examination of key EU documents, highlights the growing application of differentiated and targeted conditionality and concludes with a reflection {{on the future of the}} mechanism and its implications for the ongoing enlargement of the Union with countries of the Western Balkans and Turkey.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} the EU on party competition in post-communist Romania by testing Robert Ladrech’s model for the Europeanization of Central and East European party systems. It argues that, although it certainly holds true for a variety of post-communist cases, Ladrech’s model has a very limited explanatory power in the Romanian case <b>after</b> <b>accession,</b> for two reasons. First, the post-accession period has seen further institutionalization of the party system through the gradual disappearance of the extreme-right from within the ranks of parliamentary parties, and through increased competition between established parties on the centre-left and the centre-right of the political spectrum. Second, there has been little change in parties’ stances on European integration. Thus, Romanian formations’ consensus on the benefits of EU membership has continued to exist in the period <b>after</b> <b>accession,</b> while conflicts over the EU’s socio-economic acquis, such as those emerging in Poland and the Czech Republic, have failed to materialize. The main explanation for this situation is the fact that Romania continues to be subject to monitoring {{in the form of the}} Cooperation and Verification Mechanism, which has essentially extended the EU’s conditionality into the post-accession period. Given continued monitoring by the European Commission, the distinction between {{the impact of the}} EU before and <b>after</b> <b>accession</b> is therefore less clear-cut in Romania’s case than in the case of other post-communist EU member states...|$|R
