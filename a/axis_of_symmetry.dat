5|$|Rhodocene {{exists as}} , a {{paramagnetic}} 19-valence electron radical monomer only {{at or below}} −196°C (liquid nitrogen temperatures) or above 150°C in the gas phase. It is this monomeric form that displays the typical staggered metallocene sandwich structure. At room temperature (25°C), the lifetime of the monomeric form in acetonitrile is less than two seconds; and rhodocene forms 2, a diamagnetic 18-valence electron bridged dimeric ansa-metallocene structure. Electron spin resonance (ESR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and infrared spectroscopic (IR) measurements point {{to the presence of}} an equilibrium interconverting the monomeric and dimeric forms. ESR evidence confirms that the monomer possesses a high order <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>symmetry</b> (Cn, n>2) with a mirror plane (σ) perpendicular to it as symmetry elements; this experimentally demonstrates that the monomer does possess the typical sandwich structure of a metallocene although the interpretation of the ESR data has been questioned. The decomposition pathway of the monomer has also been studied by mass spectrometry. The dimerisation is a redox process; the dimer is a rhodium(I) species and the monomer has a rhodium(II) centre. Rhodium typically occupies oxidation states +I or +III in its stable compounds.|$|E

40|$|Four {{experiments}} {{investigated the}} roles of layout geometry {{in the selection of}} intrinsic frames of reference in spatial memory. Participants learned the locations of objects in a room from 2 or 3 viewing perspectives. One view corresponded to the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> bilateral <b>symmetry</b> <b>of</b> the layout, and the other view(s) was (were) nonorthogonal to the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> bilateral <b>symmetry.</b> Judgments <b>of</b> relative direction using spatial memory were quicker for imagined headings parallel to the symmetric axis than for those parallel to the other viewing perspectives. This advantage disappeared when the symmetric axis was eliminated. Moreover, there was more consistency across participants in the selection of intrinsic axes when the layout contained an <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> bilateral <b>symmetry</b> than when it did not. These results indicate that the layout geometry affects the selection of intrinsic frames of reference supporting the intrinsic model of spatia...|$|R

25|$|The <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>symmetry</b> of a {{two-dimensional}} figure {{is a line}} such that, if a perpendicular is constructed, any two points lying on the perpendicular at equal distances from the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>symmetry</b> are identical. Another {{way to think about}} it is that if the shape were to be folded in half over the axis, the two halves would be identical: the two halves are each other's mirror image. Thus a square has four axes of symmetry, because there are four different ways to fold it and have the edges all match. A circle has infinitely many axes of symmetry passing through its center, for the same reason.|$|E

25|$|In one dimension, {{there is}} a point of {{symmetry}} about which reflection takes place; in two dimensions {{there is a}}n <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>symmetry,</b> and in three dimensions there is a plane of symmetry. An object or figure for which every point has a one-to-one mapping onto another, equidistant from and on opposite sides of a common plane is called mirror symmetric (see mirror image).|$|E
25|$|Although {{there is}} no <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>symmetry,</b> there are two optical axes or binormals which are defined as {{directions}} along which light may propagate without birefringence, i.e., directions along which the wavelength is independent of polarization. For this reason, birefringent materials with three distinct refractive indices are called biaxial. Additionally, there are two distinct axes known as optical ray axes or biradials along which the group velocity of the light is independent of polarization.|$|E

If the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>symmetry</b> is aimed at the sun, any object that {{is located at the}} focus receives highly concentrated sunlight, and therefore becomes very hot. This is the basis for the use of this kind of reflector for solar cooking.|$|E

25|$|In its {{original}} formulation as presented by Paul Ehrenfest 1909 {{in relation to}} the concept of Born rigidity within special relativity, it discusses an ideally rigid cylinder that is made to rotate about its <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>symmetry.</b> The radius R as seen in the laboratory frame is always perpendicular to its motion and should therefore be equal to its value R0 when stationary. However, the circumference (2πR) should appear Lorentz-contracted to a smaller value than at rest, by the usual factor γ. This leads to the contradiction that R=R0 and R0.|$|E

25|$|Every antiparallelogram has an <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>symmetry</b> {{through its}} {{crossing}} point. Because of this symmetry, {{it has two}} pairs of equal angles {{as well as two}} pairs of equal sides. Together with the kites and the isosceles trapezoids, antiparallelograms form one of three basic classes of quadrilaterals with a symmetry axis. The convex hull of an antiparallelogram is an isosceles trapezoid, and every antiparallelogram may be formed from the non-parallel sides (or either pair of parallel sides in case of a rectangle) and diagonals of an isosceles trapezoid.|$|E
25|$|A {{material}} is termed uniaxial {{when it has}} a single direction of symmetry in its optical behavior, which we term the optic axis. It {{also happens to be}} the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>symmetry</b> of the index ellipsoid (a spheroid in this case). The index ellipsoid could still be described according to the refractive indices, nα, nβ and nγ, along three coordinate axes, however in this case two are equal. So if nα = nβ corresponding to the x and y axes, then the extraordinary index is nγ corresponding to the z axis, which is also called the optic axis in this case.|$|E
25|$|In general terms, {{gravitational}} waves are radiated by objects whose motion involves acceleration and its change, {{provided that the}} motion is not perfectly spherically symmetric (like an expanding or contracting sphere) or rotationally symmetric (like a spinning disk or sphere). A simple example of this principle is a spinning dumbbell. If the dumbbell spins around its <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>symmetry,</b> it will not radiate {{gravitational waves}}; if it tumbles end over end, {{as in the case}} of two planets orbiting each other, it will radiate gravitational waves. The heavier the dumbbell, and the faster it tumbles, the greater is the gravitational radiation it will give off. In an extreme case, such as when the two weights of the dumbbell are massive stars like neutron stars or black holes, orbiting each other quickly, then significant amounts of gravitational radiation would be given off.|$|E
