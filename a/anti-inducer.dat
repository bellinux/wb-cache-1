40|$|The xyl operons {{of several}} gram-positive {{bacteria}} are regulated {{at the level}} of transcription by xylose-responsive repressor proteins (XylR). In addition, they are catabolite repressed. Here, we describe a mechanism by which glucose metabolism can affect both regulatory mechanisms. Glucose- 6 -phosphate appeared to be an <b>anti-inducer</b> of xyl operon transcription, since it could compete with xylose in interaction in vitro with XylR from Bacillus subtilis, B. megaterium, and B. licheniformis. On the other hand, glucose was a low-efficiency inactivator of XylR from B. subtilis and B. megaterium and a weak <b>anti-inducer</b> of XylR from B. licheniformis. Thus, the chemical nature of the substituent at C- 5 of xylose and the primary structure of XylR determine the effect of these compounds on xyl operon transcription...|$|E

Evidence is presented showing that the protein binds specifically to ara DNA...|$|E
40|$|We have {{identified}} pobR, {{a gene encoding}} a transcriptional activator that regulates expression of pobA, the structural gene for p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (PobA) in Acinetobacter calcoaceticus ADP 1. Inducible expression of cloned pobA in Escherichia coli depended upon {{the presence of a}} functional pobR gene, and mutations within pobR prevented pobA expression in A. calcoaceticus. A pobA-lacZ operon fusion was used to demonstrate that pobA expression in A. calcoaceticus is enhanced up to 400 -fold by the inducer p-hydroxybenzoate. Inducer concentrations as low as 10 (- 7) M were sufficient to elicit partial induction. Some structurally related analogs of p-hydroxybenzoate, unable to cause induction by themselves, were effective <b>anti-inducers.</b> The nucleotide sequence of pobR was determined, and the activator gene was shown to be transcribed divergently from pobA; the genes are separated by 134 DNA base pairs. The deduced amino acid sequence yielded a polypeptide of M(r) = 30, 764. Analysis of this sequence revealed at the NH 2 terminus a stretch of residues with high potential for forming a helix-turn-helix structure that could serve as a DNA-binding domain. A conservative amino acid substitution (Arg- 61 [...] >His- 61) in this region inactivated PobR. The primary structure of PobR appears to be evolutionarily distinct from the four major families of NH 2 -terminal helix-turn-helix containing bacterial regulatory proteins that have been identified thus far...|$|R
40|$|The {{expression}} of nod genes of Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae in nodules of Pisum sativum was investigated {{at both the}} translational and transcriptional levels. By using immunoblots, {{it was found that}} the levels of NodA, NodI, NodE, and NodO proteins were reduced at least 14 -fold in bacteriods compared with cultured cells, whereas NodD protein was reduced only 3 -fold. Northern (RNA) blot hybridization, RNase protection assays, and in situ RNA hybridization together showed that, except for the nodD transcript, none of the other nod gene transcripts were present in bacteroids. The amount of nodD transcript in bacteroids was reduced only two- to threefold compared with that in cultured cells. Identical results were found with a Rhizobium strain harboring multicopies of nodD and with a strain containing a NodD protein (NodD 604) which is activated independently of flavonoids. Furthermore, it was found that mature pea nodules contain inhibitors of induced nod gene transcription but that NodD 604 was insensitive to these compounds. In situ RNA hybridization on sections from P. sativum and Vicia hirsuta nodules showed that transcription of inducible nod genes is switched off before the bacteria differentiate into bacteroids. This is unlikely to be due to limiting amounts of NodD, the absence of inducing compounds, or the presence of <b>anti-inducers.</b> The observed switch off of transcription during the development of symbiosis is a general phenomenon and is apparently caused by a yet unknown, negative regulation mechanism...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground: CysB is a tetrameric protein of {{identical}} subunits (Mr = 36, 000) which controls {{the expression of}} genes associated with the biosynthesis of cysteine in bacteria. CysB is both an activator and a repressor of transcription whose activity is responsive to the inducer N-acetylserine; thiosulphate and sulphide act as <b>anti-inducers.</b> CysB {{is a member of}} the LysR family of prokaryotic transcriptional regulatory proteins which share sequence similarities over ∼ 280 residues including a putative helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif at their N terminus. The aims of the present study were to explore further the complex molecular biology and curious ligand binding properties of CysB and to provide structural insights into the LysR family of proteins. Results: The crystal structure of a dimeric chymotryptic fragment of Klebsiella aerogenes CysB comprising residues 88 – 324, has been solved by multiple isomorphous replacement and multi-crystal averaging and refined against data extending to 1. 8 Å resolution. The protein comprises two α/βdomains (I and II) connected by two short segments of polypeptide. The two domains enclose a cavity lined by polar sidechains, including those of two residues whose mutation is associated with constitutive expression of the cysteine regulon. A sulphate anion and a number of well ordered water molecules have been modelled into discrete electron-density peaks within this cavity. In the dimer, strands βB from domain I and strands βG from domain II come together so that a pair of antiparallel symmetry-related 11 -stranded twisted β-pleated sheets is formed. Conclusions: The overall structure of CysB(88 – 324) is strikingly similar to those of the periplasmic substrate-binding proteins. A similar fold has also been observed in the cofactor-binding domain of Lac repressor, implying a structural relationship between the Lac repressor and LysR families of proteins. In contrast to Lac repressor, in CysB the twofold axis of symmetry that relates the monomers in the dimer is perpendicular rather than parallel to the long axis of the cofactor-binding domain. This seems likely to place the DNA-binding domains at opposite extremes of the molecule possibly accounting for CysB's extended DNA footprints...|$|R
40|$|The intact lac {{repressor}} tetramer, which regulates {{expression of}} the lac operon in Escherichia coli, has been crystallized in the native form, with an inducer, and in a ternary complex with operator DNA and an <b>anti-inducer.</b> The crystals without DNA diffract to better than 3. 5 A. They belong to the monoclinic space group C 2 and have cell dimensions a = 164. 7 A, b = 75. 6 A, and c = 161. 2 A, with alpha = gamma = 90 degrees and beta = 125. 5 degrees. Cocrystals have been obtained {{with a number of}} different lac operator-related DNA fragments. The complex with a blunt-ended 16 -base-pair strand yielded tetragonal bipyramids that diffract to 6. 5 A. These protein-DNA cocrystals crack upon exposure to the gratuitous inducer isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactoside, suggesting a conformational change in the repressor-operator complex...|$|E
40|$|The cysPTWA operons of Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium encode {{components}} of periplasmic transport systems for sulfate and thiosulfate and are regulated {{as part of}} the cysteine regulons. In vitro transcription initiation from the cysP promoter was shown to require both CysB protein and either O-acetyl-L-serine or N-acetyl-L-serine, which act as inducers, and was inhibited by the <b>anti-inducer</b> sulfide. Thiosulfate was found to be even more potent than sulfide as an <b>anti-inducer.</b> DNase I protection experiments showed two discrete binding sites for CysB protein in the presence of N-acetyl-L-serine. CBS-P 1 is located between positions - 85 and - 41 relative to the major transcription start site, and CBS-P 2 is located between positions - 19 and + 25. Without N-acetyl-L-serine, the CysB protein protected the region between positions - 63 and - 11, which was designated CBS-P 3. In gel mobility shift assays, the mobility of CysB protein-cysP promoter complexes was increased by O-acetyl-L-serine, N-Acetyl-L-serine had no effect in gel shift experiments, presumably because its anionic charge results in its rapid removal from the complex during electrophoresis. Comparison of DNA fragments differing with respect to binding site position indicated that complexes with CysB protein contain DNA that is bent somewhere between CBS-P 1 and CBS-P 2 and that O-acetyl-L-serine decreases DNA bending. Binding studies with fragments containing either CBS-P 2 alone, CBS-P 1 alone, or the entire cysP promoter region suggest a model in which the complex of bent DNA observed in the absence of O-acetyl-L-serine contains a single CysB protein molecule bound to CBS-P 3. At relatively low CysB protein concentrations, O-acetyl-L-serine would cause a single CysB protein molecule to bind tightly to CBS-P 1, rather than to CBS-P 3, thereby decreasing DNA bending and increasing complex electrophoretic mobility. At higher CysB protein concentrations, O-acetyl-L-serine would cause a second molecule to bind at CBS-P 2, giving a more slowly migrating complex...|$|E
40|$|The crystal {{structure}} for the negative regulator (AmiC) of the amidase operon from Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been solved at a resolution of 2. 1 A. AmiC is the amide sensor protein in the amidase operon and regulates {{the activity of the}} transcription antitermination factor AmiR, which in turn regulates amidase expression. The AmiC structure consists of two domains with an alternating beta-alpha-beta topology. The two domains are separated by a central cleft and the amide binding site is positioned in this cleft at the interface of the domains. The overall fold for AmiC is extremely similar to that for the leucine-isoleucine-valine binding protein (LivJ) of Escherichia coli despite only 17 % sequence identity, however, the two domains of AmiC are substantially closed compared with LivJ. The closed structure of AmiC is stabilized significantly by the bound acetamide, suggesting a molecular mechanism for the process of amide induction. The amide binding site is extremely specific for acetamide and would not allow a closed conformation {{in the presence of the}} <b>anti-inducer</b> molecule butyramide...|$|E
40|$|Specific {{activity}} of benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase in carbon-limited continuous cultures {{was at a}} maximum at a specific growth rate of 0 - 2 h-l, but fell off at lower and higher growth rates. The specific activity in nitrogen-limited cultures was always lower and was inversely proportional to growth rate. There was severe repression of benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase during metabolism of L (+) -mandelate or phenylglyoxylate in batch cultures. Synthesis of benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase was followed in experiments where various compounds, including a gratuitous inducer and an <b>anti-inducer</b> of the mandelate enzymes, were added to uninduced or pre-induced cultures and to constitutive and blocked mutants. The results led {{to the conclusion that}} there were at least two types of repression. One was caused by phenylglyoxylate carboxy-lyase (or a compound synthesized co-ordinately with it), but not by the other mandelate enzymes or by L (+) -mandelate, phenylglyoxylate, benzaldehyde or benzoate. A second type of repression was observed during rapid growth or after the addition of compounds such as succinate which are rapidly and completely metabolized...|$|E
40|$|Glucocorticoids induce {{tyrosine}} aminotransferase (EC 2. 6. 1. 5) synthesis in cultured rat hepatoma cells. These steroids {{penetrate the}} cell membrane and bind to specific cytoplasmic receptor proteins. The resulting complex binds to the nucleus. This nuclear binding {{has now been}} studied in a cell-free preparation. The reaction appears to require a temperature-dependent modification of the steroid-receptor complex. There is a fixed number of nuclear sites that are half saturated at a complex concentration of 6 to 24 × 10 - 11 M. Treatment with deoxyribonuclease destroys nuclear-binding capacity. The complex also binds to purified HTC cell DNA with characteristics similar to the binding to isolated nuclei, and, as in intact cells, receptors complexed with an <b>anti-inducer</b> steroid bind very poorly to DNA. These {{data suggest that the}} nuclear sites for binding steroid-receptor complexes are on the DNA. Since the extent of complex binding to purified DNA exceeds that observed with isolated nuclei, chromosomal proteins may act to restrict binding to certain regions of the DNA. These studies suggest that steroid hormones stimulate the synthesis of specific proteins by affecting the transcription of structural or regulatory genes...|$|E
40|$|The {{cysteine}} regulon of Salmonella typhimurium {{is positively}} {{regulated by the}} CysB protein and an inducer, which can be either O-acetyl-L-serine or N-acetyl-L-serine. In vivo experiments confirmed that sulfide and L-cysteine (supplied as L-cystine) interfere with induction by exogenously supplied O-acetyl-L-serine and also showed the same effects when N-acetyl-L-serine {{was used as an}} inducer. In a gel shift assay, purified CysB protein bound specifically to a 278 -base-pair DNA fragment containing the S. typhimurium cysJIH promoter region. Binding occurred in the absence of inducer but did not stimulate in vitro transcription initiation, indicating that binding alone is insufficient to cause formation of a transcription initiation complex. Addition of N-acetyl-L-serine or O-acetyl-L-serine was required for transcription initiation and also stimulated binding three- to eightfold. Sulfide inhibited both transcription initiation and binding by interfering with the stimulatory effects of inducer in a competitive manner. These findings indicate that sulfide is an <b>anti-inducer</b> and may explain why full expression of the cysteine regulon requires sulfur limitation. L-Cysteine did not affect in vitro transcription initiation or binding of CysB protein to the cysJIH promoter region. The in vivo effects of L-cysteine may be secondary to its degradation to sulfide by the inducible enzyme cysteine desulfhydrase...|$|E
40|$|The lac {{repressor}} is a transcriptional regulator {{found in}} E. coli that monitors {{the levels of}} available lactose and adjusts expression of the genes involved in lactose utilization accordingly. Since its discovery, the lac operon {{has served as a}} model system for exploring the molecular mechanisms of gene regulation, protein-DNA recognition and allosteric signaling. In recent years, the molecular switch has become a valuable tool for regulating expression in a number of bacterial and eukaryotic systems. With such widespread application of the lac repressor, we saw the need and opportunity to design the next generation of transcriptional regulators. In this dissertation, we have used directed evolution to create repressors which improve upon the wild type system by reducing the leakiness of the switch. A series of novel repressors have also been developed which are capable of repressing non-classical operator sites. These repressors heterodimerize and allow two different DNA binding domains to function together in recognizing asymmetric operators. Finally, a series of repressors have been created that contain altered effector specificity. Several of these repressors induce with a previously neutral effector, ONPG, while other repressors function in the reverse direction by a mechanism of co-repression. ^ In an effort to produce novel switches, we have also discovered facets of the lac operon that are responsible for optimal functionality. We demonstrate that the operator is not a passive component of the molecular switch: it is responsible for establishing binding affinity, specificity, and translational efficiency of the resulting transcript. Using the heterodimeric construct we were also able to determine that binding of two inducers is required for full induction. Finally, determination of crystal structures of the lac repressor bound to inducer and <b>anti-inducer</b> molecules provide a model for how these small molecules can modulate repressor function. These structures suggest that the O 6 hydroxyl on the galactoside is essential for establishing a water-mediated hydrogen bonding network that bridges the N-terminal and C-terminal sub-domains. This hydrogen bonding can account in part for the different structural conformations of the repressor and is vital for the allosteric transition. ...|$|E
40|$|The lactose {{repressor}} protein binds {{specifically to the}} operator region of Escherichia coli DNA, physically blocking the transcription of the genes coding for the lactose catabolic enzymes. Initial work with tryptic digestion of repressor to produce a tetrameric core protein (inducer binding) and four NH(, 2) -terminal peptides (DNA binding) suggested contributions of the protein regions to ligand interactions. Chemical studies, however, suggested that an alteration of this view was required. At low molar ratios of N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) to repressor, cysteine oxidation caused loss of operator DNA binding activity with simultaneous retention of inducer and nonspecific DNA binding activities. The region surrounding cysteine 107 {{was found to be}} influential in maintaining intact operator DNA binding function in repressor. Matthews demonstrated specific, inducible DNA binding affinity in core fragment by direct binding studies (Matthews (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 3348). In light of this activity, application of methylation protection techniques using core protein fragment were of interest. The modification pattern with core protein contained components of the uninduced repressor-operator methylation pattern reported previously. These similarities in the pattern were restricted to the central, asymmetric region of the operator sequence. The effects of inducer and <b>anti-inducer</b> binding to both core and repressor were reflected by changes in the methylation patterns (the anti-inducer-repressor pattern has not been published previously). Exonuclease III digestion was used to probe the 3 '-boundary of DNA-protein complexes, and DNase I treatment to probe the susceptibility to digestion of the operator region in the intact complex. Exposure to exonuclease III {{in the presence of the}} tryptic core and intact repressor yielded different 3 '-boundaries for the complexes formed. The tryptic core protein protected the operator region from DNase I digestion, though to a lesser degree than repressor and in a more restricted region of the operator DNA. The effects of sugar binding on the availability of DNA to enzymatic action for both complexes were consistent with the expected alterations in affinity. A model for core and repressor binding to operator DNA is proposed...|$|E
