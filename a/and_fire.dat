40|$|Strong {{hysteresis}} in {{the labour}} market (see Cross, 1995) requires workers to be heterogeneous {{in terms of}} the cost of hiring <b>and</b> <b>firing.</b> We show how such heterogeneity arises naturally in labour markets due to differences in workers’ age by showing that both the hiring <b>and</b> the <b>firing</b> thresholds for productivity are age dependent. The presence of strong hysteresis does not for this reason depend on ad-hoc differences in the cost of hiring <b>and</b> <b>firing</b> workers.

5|$|Regarding A Song of Ice <b>and</b> <b>Fire</b> as his magnum opus, Martin {{is certain}} never to write {{anything}} {{on this scale}} again and would only return to this fictional universe {{in the context of}} stand-alone novels. He prefers to write stories about characters from other Ice <b>and</b> <b>Fire</b> periods of history such as his Tales of Dunk and Egg project, instead of continuing the series directly. A possible future side project is a prequel set during Aegon's conquest of Westeros. Martin said he would love to return to writing short stories, novellas, novelettes, and stand-alone novels from diverse genres such as science fiction, horror, fantasy, or even a murder mystery. However, he will see if his audience follows him after publishing his next project.|$|E
