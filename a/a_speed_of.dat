5|$|Every test session {{began at}} 9a.m. EST, stopped at 12:00– 1:00p.m. EST, and {{concluded}} at 5:00p.m. EST. During {{the first session}} {{on the morning of}} January 20, 2011, thirty-three drivers participated, and Clint Bowyer was quickest with <b>a</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> 184.216mph while David Reutimann had the highest speed of 195.780mph during the second session in the afternoon. The third test session, scheduled for the morning of January 21, was canceled because of wet weather. During the fourth session, held during the afternoon, 34 drivers participated with Denny Hamlin being quickest with <b>a</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> 196.868mph. Several drivers decided to leave after the session, which included Reutimann, Martin Truex, Jr., Jimmie Johnson, and Bowyer. During the fifth session, held on the morning of January 22, 29 drivers participated, and Joey Logano was quickest with <b>a</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> 197.516mph.

5|$|Betelgeuse is {{travelling}} supersonically {{through the}} interstellar medium at <b>a</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> 30km per second (i.e. ~6.3AU per year) creating a bow shock. The shock is not created by the star, but by its powerful stellar wind as it ejects vast amounts of gas into {{the interstellar medium}} at <b>a</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> 17km/s, heating the material surrounding the star, thereby making it visible in infrared light. Because Betelgeuse is so bright, {{it was only in}} 1997 that the bow shock was first imaged. The cometary structure is estimated to be at least 1 parsec wide, assuming a distance of 643 light-years.|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{magnetic}} field, predominantly dipolar at its surface, is distorted {{further out}} by the solar wind. This is a stream of charged particles leaving the Sun's corona and accelerating to <b>a</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> 200 to 1000kilometres per second.

5|$|The {{ships were}} also armed with {{submerged}} torpedo tubes in their hulls. Derfflinger {{was equipped with}} four 50cm tubes; the later ships were armed with more powerful 60cm weapons. The tubes were arranged with one in the bow, one in the stern, and two on the broadside. Derfflingers 50cm torpedoes were the G7 type, 7.02m (276in) long and armed with a 195kg (430lb) Hexanite warhead. The torpedo had a range of 4,000m (4,370yd) when set at <b>a</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> 37knots, and up to 9,300m (10,170yd) at 27 knots. The 60cm torpedoes were the H8 type, which were 8m long and carried a 210kg (463lb) Hexanite warhead. The torpedoes had a range of 6,000m (6,550yd) when set at <b>a</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> 36knots; at a reduced speed of 30knots, the range increased significantly to 14,000m (15,310yd).|$|E
5|$|An {{atmospheric}} probe {{was released from}} the spacecraft in July 1995, entering the planet's atmosphere on December 7, 1995. After a high-g descent into the Jovian atmosphere, the probe discarded the remains of its heat shield, and it parachuted through 150km of the atmosphere, collecting data for 57.6minutes, before being crushed by the pressure and temperature to which it was subjected (about 22 times Earth normal, at a temperature of 153°C). It would have melted thereafter, and possibly vaporized. The Galileo orbiter itself experienced a more rapid version of the same fate when it was deliberately steered into the planet on September 21, 2003 at <b>a</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> over 50km/s, in order to avoid any possibility of it crashing into and contaminating Europa.|$|E
5|$|Cameras on the Galileo {{spacecraft}} observed {{fragments of}} Comet Shoemaker–Levy9 between 16 and 22 July 1994 as they collided with Jupiter's southern hemisphere at <b>a</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> approximately 60kilometres per second. This {{was the first}} direct observation of an extraterrestrial collision of solar system objects. While the impacts {{took place on the}} side of Jupiter hidden from Earth, Galileo, then at a distance of 1.6AU from the planet, was able to see the impacts as they occurred. Its instruments detected a fireball that reached a peak temperature of about 24,000K, compared to the typical Jovian cloudtop temperature of about 130K (−143°C), with the plume from the fireball reaching a height of over 3,000km.|$|E

5|$|Danner's {{physical}} strength extends to his legs, {{allowing him to}} leap great heights and distances. At age 10 he can leap 40 {{feet into the air}} and run faster than a train. During his freshman year in college, he easily breaks a world track record, though he actually doesn't run at his full speed. While {{in the service of the}} French Foreign Legion in World War I, he traverses thirty-seven miles round trip in just thirty minutes (<b>a</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> about 148mph); all while carrying 2,000 pounds of food, water, and ammunition for his unit. Despite his great strength, he is still susceptible to fatigue.|$|E
5|$|Folding@home {{is one of}} the world's fastest {{computing}} systems, with <b>a</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> approximately 70 petaFLOPS. This {{performance from}} its large-scale computing network has allowed researchers to run computationally costly atomic-level simulations of protein folding thousands of times longer than formerly achieved. Since its launch on October1, 2000, the Pande Lab has produced 139 scientific research papers {{as a direct result of}} Folding@home. Results from the project's simulations agree well with experiments.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, RA85656, a Tupolev Tu-154 {{operating}} as Baikal Airlines Flight 130, crashed near Irkutsk shortly after departing from Irkutsk Airport, Russia. Damage to the starter caused {{a fire in}} engine number two (located in the rear fuselage). High temperatures during the fire destroyed the tanks and pipes of all three hydraulic systems. The crew {{lost control of the}} aircraft. The unmanageable plane, at <b>a</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> 275 knots, hit the ground at a dairy farm and burned. All passengers and crew, as well as a dairyman on the ground, died.|$|E

The M3A1 (using the M5 mount) could traverse 21° in both directions, but could only depress −6.5°.|$|E
5|$|King George V {{had four}} sets of Parsons geared {{turbines}}. Two main turbines were arranged in series and drove a shaft through double helical gears. An astern turbine was incorporated in the exhaust casing of the low-pressure turbine, and a cruising turbine was coupled directly to the high-pressure turbine. <b>A</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> 28.5 knots was expected at standard displacement and 27.5 knots at full-load displacement on normal output; corresponding speeds at overload condition were 29.25 and 28.25 knots respectively. The turbine unit was a low-speed type (2,257 rpm) coupled to a single reduction gear which produced 236 rpm at the propeller shaft.|$|E
