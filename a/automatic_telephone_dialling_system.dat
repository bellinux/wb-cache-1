40|$|The {{function}} of the <b>Automatic</b> <b>Telephone</b> <b>Dialling</b> <b>System</b> is to detect any sort of alarm such as fire, equipment failure, burglary. It then has to transmit the alarm information over the switched telephone network to a Control Station, where the alarm information is displayed. The attending personnel can then take the appropriate action. The Dialling system designed and constructed in this thesis consists of two parts: the Alarm Unit and the Control Station. As soon as an alarm occurs, the Alarm Unit selects the first available telephone number of the Control Station and dials the number. Using Frequency Shift Keying method, the Alarm Unit transmits the information identifying itself and the alarm to the Control Station. Initiate and Acknowledge Signalling as well as error checking ensure correct data transmission. Data re-transmissions and rediallings take place until successful transmission is acknowledged. A micro-program rather than a hardwired control logic is used in each the Alarm Unit and the Control Station for controlling their operations. The Central Processing Unit has been designed using MSI components. A microprocessor was not used because, {{at the time of}} the commencement of the project, its cost was high. Nevertheless the design was microprocessor - oriented, so that a microprocessor can be adopted in the future. A prototype was implemented using CMOS technology. This offers the advantages of lower power dissipation and higher noise immunity when compared with existing technologies such as TTL. Automatic gain control amplifiers and filters are used in the system to compensate for transmission line losses and reduce noise influence on information reception. Provision has been made so that, if a number of alarms occur at the same time at the Alarm Unit, they will be transmitted sequentially. At the Control Station, apart from displaying current alarm, memory space is provided for queueing the received alarms. System testing can be carried out at the push of a button from either the Alarm Unit or the Control Station. The test routine involves the same sequence of operations as in the case of an alarm, thus enhancing the thoroughness of the test. The system is expandable to any desired number of Alarm Units and Control Stations. With a system of this type, if one Control Station is busy, an a Alarm Unit can be programmed to attempt communicating with another Control Station...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{evidence}} {{emerging from}} several laboratories, integrated with new {{data obtained by}} searching the genome databases, suggests that the area code hypothesis provides a good heuristic model for explaining the remarkable specificity of cell migration and tissue assembly that occurs throughout embryogenesis. The area code hypothesis proposes that cells assemble organisms, including their brains and nervous systems, {{with the aid of}} a molecular-addressing code that functions much like the country, area, regional, and local portions of the <b>telephone</b> <b>dialing</b> <b>system.</b> The complexity of the information required to code cells for the construction of entire organisms is so enormous that we assume that the code must make combinatorial use of members of large multigene families. Such a system would reuse the same receptors as molecular digits in various regions of the embryo, thus greatly reducing the total number of genes required. We present the hypothesis that members of the very large families of olfactory receptors and vomeronasal receptors fulfill the criteria proposed for area code molecules and could serve as the last digits in such a code. We discuss our evidence indicating that receptors of these families are expressed in many parts of developing embryos and suggest that they play a key functional role in cell recognition and targeting not only in the olfactory system but also throughout the brain and numerous other organs as they are assembled...|$|R

The original dials required complex operational sequences. A workable, albeit error-prone, system was invented by the Automatic Electric Company using three push-buttons on the telephone. These buttons represented the hundreds, tens, and single units of a telephone number. When calling the subscriber number 163, for example, the user had to push the hundreds button once, followed by six presses of the tens button, and three presses of the units button. In 1896, this system was supplanted by an automatic contact-making machine, or calling device. Further development continued during the 1890s and the early 1900s in conjunction with improvements in switching technology.|$|R
