40|$|Abstract: A {{solution}} of astatic attitude control problem for an aircraft is considered. The traditional solu-tion method {{on the base}} of integral for the error can lead to the system dynamic accuracy breakdown. In the paper a contradiction between dynamic accuracy and the request of an <b>astatic</b> <b>control</b> is solved {{on the base of}} variable structure control principle...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. For {{successful}} reactor operation, {{the development}} of kinetic control system is required along with magnetic control system creation. The paper is devoted to investigating capabilities and quality of kinetic control of plasma integral characteristics of tokamak-reactor by means of multivariable <b>astatic</b> feedback <b>control</b> system with adaptation as well as studying plasma behavior in the open system at various disturbances. Numerical simulations were carried out on plasma-physics code ASTRA for ITER parameters [1]. For analysis we selected the steady-state ITER scenario with plasma current Ip= 9 MA, average plasma density ne ~ 7 Â· 1019 m- 3, with the reversed shear region in the plasma core and completely non-inductive current drive. Testing MIMO plasma model. Plasma in tokamak is a complicated multi-linked (Multi-Inputs Multi-Outputs [MIMO]) plant: each input action influences on the main output signals. Modeling showed that often this creates contradictory conditions for operation of various control channels in attempting to act on several plasma parameters simultaneously. More over, contradictions are enhanced because of nonlinear interactions via plasma between separate feedback circuits. The situation is improved owing t...|$|R
40|$|The VST (VLT Survey Telescope) is a 2. 6 m class Alt-Az {{telescope}} {{to be installed}} at Mount Paranal in the Atacama desert, Chile, in the European Southern Observatory (ESO) site. The VST is a wide-field imaging facility planned to supply databases for the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT) science and carry out stand-alone observations in the UV to I spectral range.

40|$|Specific dynamic {{behaviors}} of astatic objects affect {{selection of the}} control systems structure, control principle and tuning method. The goal of this final work is to investigate and compare different structures of control systems work quality indicators of astatic objects. It will be done using simulation way by following the setpoint and compensating disturbance effects. There has been investigated automatic <b>control</b> system of <b>astatic</b> objects. In this system has been installed additional feedback, which transforms astatic objects to stable in the open loop. System work investigation has been accomplished in simulation way (MATLAB/Simulink environment) by comparing control system with additional feedback and typical one feedback automatic control system. For the system work investigation there were selected 4 th rows with different dynamic behaviors which describe the astatic objects having transformation function with time delay. Control systems working quality indicators were evaluated by modeling system response to the hopping setpoint and disturbance changes. System controllers were coordinated for aperiodic and for transitions processes with 20 % relative dynamic deviations. There were made statistical evaluation and comparison of the quality indicators by comparing: override, regulation and rising time.
