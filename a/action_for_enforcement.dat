If that is the case, it is for that court or tribunal to establish all the consequences thereby arising under national law, in order to ensure that the consumer is not bound by that clause...|$|E

40|$|Should a small {{business}} be put at risk of insolvency for sending advertisements by fax to prospective customers? Or have to spend {{thousands of dollars on}} legal fees to defend itself in court? Or be forced to “pay off” a plaintiff’s lawyer to avoid litigation? Though the intuitive answer is “no,” questions like these were overlooked in 1991 and again in 2005 when Congress responded to concerns about the costs of unsolicited facsimile advertising. As a result, the cottage industry of “junk fax” lawsuits that has developed and flourished {{in the last two decades}} has forced many {{small business}}es—many of which had no idea they were breaking the law—to face these serious issues. The history of junk fax litigation shows that any real benefit bestowed by this legislation is outweighed by the harm to these small businesses— these “innocent lawbreakers. ” As this Article will explain, if Congress will not act to remedy this imbalance, it is time for the courts to step in to bring balance to junk fax litigation. Technological advances of the 1980 s made new forms of advertising possible and economical. No longer were advertisers limited to sending solicitations through the mail or to calling consumers by telephone. The introduction and gradual ubiquity of facsimile machines allowed advertisers to send their message to consumers without having to pay costs of printing and postage. Unlike traditional junk mail, which costs consumers no more than the minor inconvenience of throwing a piece of mail in the trash, receiving an unsolicited facsimile (at least in the 1990 s) forced the consumer to pay for the ink and paper used to print the document. Responding to the proliferation of this new advertising technique, Congress enacted the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (TCPA or the Act), which sought to prohibit all forms of unsolicited commercial advertising using facsimile machines. The Act also created a private cause of <b>action</b> <b>for</b> <b>enforcement</b> of the anti-junk fax provisions. This private cause of action has led to a proliferation of litigation seeking to hold senders of unsolicited advertisements financially liable for violations of the statute. But unlike traditional measures of damages where the aggrieved party can, excepting extraordinary circumstances, recover only its actual losses, the TCPA allows for the recovery of damages which can be tens of thousands of times higher than their actual loss. This potential windfall has led to a cottage industry of lawyers and litigants whose primary vocation has become the filing of TCPA-related lawsuits. The TCPA was designed to address the harm caused by unsolicited facsimile advertising. But it has also spawned a cottage industry of attorneys who prey upon innocent law breakers—people and businesses who were never the TCPA’s intended targets. This Article explores the history behind using facsimile machines as advertising tools, the enactment of the anti-junk fax provisions of the TCPA, and then explains why the TCPA, as generally interpreted by the courts, fails to strike the correct balance between consumer protection and the protection of small businesses that unintentionally run afoul of the law—innocent lawbreakers. After explaining why innocent lawbreakers deserve protection from those who seek to abuse the Act for pecuniary gain, I will suggest several approaches (using both traditional and non-traditional legal theories) to the application of the Act that will help even the scales in the adjudication of TCPA cases, thus maintaining the Act’s core mission of protecting consumers from unwarranted and costly intrusions, but at the same time, saving innocent lawbreakers from insolvency...|$|E

40|$|Platform {{businesses}} such as Airbnb and Uber {{have risen}} to success partly by sidestepping laws and regulations that encumber their traditional competitors. Such rule flouting is what the authors call “spontaneous private deregulation,” and it’s happening in {{a growing number of}} industries. The authors explain that businesses are most vulnerable to spontaneous deregulation when certain conditions hold. One, for example, is when regulations are excessive or outdated, protecting consumers against unlikely risks—and when platform providers offer other means of shielding consumers from harm. Incumbents facing threats from private deregulation can respond by taking legal <b>action</b> to press <b>for</b> <b>enforcement</b> of existing laws. Alternatively, they can embrace aspects of a new entrant’s approach—taxi operators, for example, have developed Uber-style apps for ordering rides. Incumbents can also leverage their own strengths to set themselves apart from upstart competitors—that’s the tactic that CitizenM, the Pod Hotel, and Yotel are using to woo guests who might otherwise book with Airbnb. If all else fails, incumbents may have to cease operation. But they stand a good chance of avoiding that fate if they address their vulnerabilities early...|$|R

40|$|This work {{contends that}} Latin America has {{launched}} a true revolution on collective rights: moving beyond the paradigm of group entitlements, which concern a determinate — though potentially enormous — collectivity, to that of diffuse entitlements, which generally pertain to society as a whole. Latin American jurisdictions have created innovative procedural mechanisms in this area: the collective writ of protection for the realization of group rights, the popular <b>action</b> <b>for</b> the civic vindication of diffuse entitlements, and the public civil <b>action</b> <b>for</b> the official <b>enforcement</b> of both kinds of rights. The U. S. legal order has much to learn from a comparative reflection upon these developments. It could, accordingly, open up {{to the creation of}} a universally available citizen’s suit, the institution of an autonomous state body with power to file complaints on behalf of communal and societal interests, the concession of standing to organizations (as well as individuals) to pursue class suits, and the introduction of a single, straightforward classification under Rule 23 (b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The article concludes by calling attention to the tension between Latin American efforts to implement trans-individual guaranties and the sporadic precariousness of the rule of law in the region. It argues that, beyond adopting new measures or punishing violators more severely, the countries affected must broadly enhance the legitimacy of legal norms by renewing their commitment to democracy, as well as to other ideals, such as the rule of law itself, personal freedom, and (above all) solidarity...|$|R
