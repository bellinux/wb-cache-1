40|$|The {{existence}} of <b>a</b> specialized <b>imitation</b> module in humans is hotly debated. Studies suggesting <b>a</b> specific <b>imitation</b> impairment in individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) support a modular view. However, the voluntary imitation tasks {{used in these}} studies (which require socio-cognitive abilities in addition to imitation for successful performance) cannot support claims of a specific impairment. Accordingly, <b>an</b> automatic <b>imitation</b> paradigm (<b>a</b> ‘cleaner’ measure of imitative ability) {{was used to assess}} the imitative ability of 16 adults with ASD and 16 non-autistic matched control participants. Participants performed a prespecified hand action in response to observed hand actions performed either by a human or a robotic hand. On compatible trials the stimulus and response actions matched, while on incompatible trials the two actions did not match. Replicating previous findings, the Control group showed <b>an</b> automatic <b>imitation</b> effect: responses on compatible trials were faster than those on incompatible trials. This effect was greater when responses were made to human than to robotic actions (‘animacy bias’). The ASD group also showed <b>an</b> automatic <b>imitation</b> effect and <b>a</b> larger animacy bias than the Control group. We discuss these findings with reference to the literature on imitation in ASD and theories of imitation...|$|R
5|$|Bara-Suishou and Enju are {{characters}} who {{appear in the}} Rozen Maiden: Träumend anime and audio drama. Enju is Rozen's apprentice and the creator of Bara-Suishou, <b>an</b> <b>imitation</b> of a Rozen Maiden. Enju plots a battle between Bara-Suishou and the Rozen Maidens {{in order to prove}} his superiority over Rozen. Once Bara-Suishou gathered six Rosa Mysticas, her body overloads, killing her and Enju. Bara-Suishou is voiced by Saori Gotō and English dubbed by Tara Platt. Enju is voiced by Daisuke Ono and English dubbed by Jason C. Miller.|$|E
5|$|Industrialist Mark C. Honeywell was a Cocolobo Club {{member who}} bought Boca Chita Key in 1937, {{expanding}} the facilities {{to include a}} small lighthouse. Boca Chita Key was developed with several structures including <b>an</b> <b>imitation</b> lighthouse, built using coral rock and topped with a wire cage resembling a lighthouse lantern, {{and the end of}} a jetty {{on the north side of}} the key. The key was owned by Honeywell until 1945. Mark and Olive Honeywell also built a chapel, a guesthouse, seawalls and utility buildings on the island.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1960s, Hanna–Barbera Productions {{was the most}} {{successful}} television animation studio in the business. The Hanna–Barbera studio produced over 3000animated half-hour television shows. Among the more than 100cartoon series and specials they produced were: Atom Ant, Augie Doggie and Doggie Daddy (<b>an</b> <b>imitation</b> of the earlier Spike and Tyke MGM cartoons), Jonny Quest, Josie and the Pussycats, Magilla Gorilla, Pixie and Dixie and Mr. Jinks, Quick Draw McGraw, and Top Cat. Top Cat was based on Phil Silvers's character Sgt. Bilko, though it has been erroneously reported that Sgt. Bilko {{was the basis for}} Yogi Bear. The Hanna–Barbera studio also produced Scooby-Doo (1969–1986) and The Smurfs (1981–1989). The company also produced animated specials based on Alice in Wonderland, Jack and the Beanstalk, Cyrano de Bergerac as well as the feature-length film Charlotte's Web (1973).|$|E

5|$|Hugh Corbett, an {{entrepreneur}} {{with a background}} in the hotel industry, opened The Slug and Lettuce pub on Islington Green, North London in 1984. At the time, Islington was becoming increasingly gentrified due to its proximity to the City of London financial district. Corbett owned {{a small number of}} pubs, which he rechristened with humorous or nonsensical names, with the effect of differentiating them from competitors. His pubs had the then notable differential of stripped out carpets and enlarged windows so that people could see inside from the street. Corbett listed his business in 1989 as Fast Forward, by which time it was a nine-strong chain. In 1990 Roger Protz identified the group as <b>an</b> <b>imitation</b> of David Bruce's Firkin chain pubs.|$|E
5|$|Petre Vasiliu-Năsturel {{observes that}} from a heraldic point of view, on the French {{as well as the}} revolutionary Wallachian flag, the middle stripe {{represents}} a heraldic metal (argent and or respectively). Other writers believe that the tricolor was not <b>an</b> <b>imitation</b> of the French flag, instead embodying an old Romanian tradition. This theory is supported by a note from the revolutionary foreign minister to Emin Pasha: “the colors of the band that we the leaders wear, as well as all our followers, are not of modern origin. We have had our flags since an earlier time. When we received the tricolor insignia and bands we did not follow the spirit of imitation or fashion”.|$|E
5|$|Don Quixote in England {{was started}} as Fielding's second play, {{but it was}} not {{finished}} and produced until the later part of his career. After Fielding returned to London from the University of Leyden during the end of 1729, he brought with him a version of Don Quixote in England. It was refused by the Theatre Royal and it was not produced or printed until 1734. The only information on the origins of this play come from Fielding's 1734 preface. It was his second play, and Fielding attributes it to being written at Leyden during 1728. It was intended more as amusement than as a serious production and was <b>an</b> <b>imitation</b> of Cervantes's Don Quixote. After the prompting of Barton Booth and Colley Cibber, Fielding put away the play until 1733, when the Drury-Lane actors asked him for a new play. Soon after, Fielding rewrote parts of the play.|$|E

5|$|Some of {{the species}} in the {{freshwater}} mussel family, Unionidae, commonly known as pocketbook mussels, have evolved an unusual reproductive strategy. The female's mantle protrudes from the shell and develops into <b>an</b> <b>imitation</b> small fish, complete with fish-like markings and false eyes. This decoy moves in the current and attracts the attention of real fish. Some fish see the decoy as prey, while others see a conspecific. They approach {{for a closer look}} and the mussel releases huge numbers of larvae from its gills, dousing the inquisitive fish with its tiny, parasitic young. These glochidia larvae are drawn into the fish's gills, where they attach and trigger a tissue response that forms a small cyst around each larva. The larvae then feed by breaking down and digesting the tissue of the fish within the cysts. After a few weeks they release themselves from the cysts and fall to the stream bed as juvenile molluscs. The fish are relatively unharmed.|$|E
5|$|There {{are small}} {{enclosed}} chambers {{to either side}} of the centre chapel. The chapel of St Padarn is on the left, with <b>an</b> <b>imitation</b> pointed vault and slate slab floor. In the entrance to the chapel there is a window on the left side depicting scenes from the manuscript Life of Padarn. The single-light window with various figures, scenes and motifs is by Elizabeth Edmundson, and dates from 1988. It includes Teilo, Padarn and Dewi (David) at the top, a healing by St Samson, Maelgwn, Arthur and Caradog, two kings of Ireland on horseback and a figure with the Virgin and Child. The figures are mostly modelled on figures from the Book of St Chad. In the chapel itself, which has a low slate altar stone and seat, is a porcelain relief sculpture by Gillian Still showing a story from the Life, the ordeal by boiling water. The chapel is lit only by two small windows (one with red glass, the other green) into the central chapel. Neither the altar stone in the larger room nor that in the chapel of St Padarn have been consecrated so neither are strictly speaking altars, and neither can be used for a Eucharistic service.|$|E
5|$|Since Purple Tentacle's {{plans are}} {{flawless}} and unstoppable, Dr. Fred decides {{to use his}} Chron-o-John time machines to send Bernard, Laverne and Hoagie to the day before to turn off his Sludge-o-Matic machine, thereby preventing Purple Tentacle's exposure to the sludge.Bernard: Isn't it a little late for that, Doctor?Dr. Fred: Of course! That's why I'll have to do it... YESTERDAY! To the time machine!}} However, because Dr. Fred used <b>an</b> <b>imitation</b> diamond rather than a real diamond as a power source for the time machine, the Chron-o-Johns breaks down in operation. Laverne is sent 200 years in the future, where humanity has been enslaved and Purple Tentacle rules {{the world from the}} Edison mansion, while Hoagie is dropped 200 years in the past, where the motel is being used by the Founding Fathers as a retreat to write the United States Constitution. Bernard is returned to the present. To salvage Dr. Fred's plan, Bernard must acquire a replacement diamond for the time machine, while Hoagie and Laverne must restore power to their respective Chron-o-John pods by plugging them in.Bernard: Well, hurry up and bring them back! Dr. Fred: I will, as soon as I get a new diamond! Then all your buddies have to do is plug in their respective Chron-o-Johns and—Bernard: Plug them in?!? Where is Hoagie going to find an electrical outlet two hundred years in the past!?!Dr. Fred: Yes... well... He'll be needing my patented superbattery then, won't he?}} To overcome the lack of electricity in the past, Hoagie recruits the help of Benjamin Franklin and Dr. Fred's ancestor, Red Edison, to build a superbattery to power his pod, while Laverne evades capture by the tentacles long enough to run an extension cord to her unit. The three send small objects back and forth in time through the Chron-o-Johns and make changes to history to help the others complete their tasks.|$|E

40|$|We {{developed}} an assistive robot {{for children with}} autism {{in order to enhance}} their primal imitation skills.

The most significant part of this project was the development of <b>a</b> robot <b>imitation</b> algorithm to imitate a child’s motions. Accordingly, we propose the use of a single camera-based image-processing technique with <b>a</b> novel <b>imitation</b> algorithm for imitating a child’s motions. The results of this study show that proposed imitation algorithm was able to accurately imitate the target human motions. 1...|$|R
