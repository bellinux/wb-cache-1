The rockets are usually one-time units that are jettisoned after takeoff.

If a failure occurs {{at any point}} in time during ascent then a system must be in place to abort the mission and return the crew to a safe landing with a high probability of success. To achieve continuous abort coverage one of two sets of effectors is used. Either the Launch Abort System (LAS), consisting of the Attitude Control Motor (ACM) and the Abort Motor (AM), or the Service Module (SM), consisting of SM Orion Main Engine (OME), <b>Auxiliary</b> (Aux) <b>Jets,</b> and Reaction Control System (RCS) jets, is used. The LAS effectors are used for aborts from liftoff through the first 30 seconds of second stage flight. The SM effectors are used from that point through Main Engine Cutoff (MECO). There are two distinct sets of Guidance and Control (G&C) algorithms that are designed to maximize the performance of these abort effectors. This paper will outline the necessary inputs to the G&C subsystem, the preliminary design of the G&C algorithms, the ability of the algorithms to predict what abort modes are achievable, and the resulting success of the abort system. Abort success will be measured against the Preliminary Design Review (PDR) abort performance metrics and overall performance will be reported. Finally, potential improvements to the G&C design will be discussed...|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the new ITER-like wall project in JET. It aims at an optimal use of JET's unique features: physical size, plasma parameters most closely to ITER and the capability to handle beryllium and tritium, allowing the study of critical questions related to operating within the limits of the ITER wall materials. A full replacement of the first wall materials is planned (beryllium in the main wall and tungsten in the divertor). This should deliver answers to urgent plasma surface interaction questions such as tritium retention and provide operational experience in steady and transient conditions with ITER wall materials under relevant geometry and relevant plasma parameters. In addition, the <b>JET</b> <b>auxiliary</b> heating power will be upgraded to similar to 45 MW, allowing access to ITER-relevant disruption and edge localised modes energy loss densities.

40|$|The major aspects {{linked to}} the use of the <b>JET</b> <b>auxiliary</b> heating systems: NBI, ICRF and LHCD, in the new JET ITER-like wall (JET-ILW) are presented. We show that {{although}} there were issues related to the operation of each system, efficient and safe plasma heating was obtained with room for higher power. For the NBI up to 25. 7 MW was safely injected; issues that had to be tackled were mainly the beam shine-through and beam re-ionisation before its entrance into the plasma. For the ICRF system, 5 MW were coupled in L-mode and 4 MW in H-mode; the main areas of concern were RF-sheaths related heat loads and impurities production. For the LH, 2. 5 MW were delivered without problems; arcing and generation of fast electron beams in front of the launcher that can lead to high heat loads were the keys issues. For each system, an overview will be given of: the main modifications implemented for safe use, their compatibility with the new metallic wall, the differences in behavior compared with the previous carbon wall, with emphasis on heat loads and impurity content in the plasma.

5000|$|Sikorsky {{developed}} the X2 helicopter on a $50 million budget. The design includes expertise gathered from several earlier design projects. The S-69/XH-59A Advancing Blade Concept Demonstrator {{had shown that}} high speed was possible with a coaxial helicopter with <b>auxiliary</b> propulsion (two <b>jet</b> engines), but that vibration and fuel consumption was excessive; the Cypher UAV expanded the company's knowledge of the unique aspects of coaxial flight control laws with a fly-by-wire aircraft; and the RAH-66 Comanche developed expertise in composite rotors and advanced transmission design. Other features include slowed [...] "de-swirling" [...] rigid rotors two feet apart, active force counter-vibration inspired by the Black Hawk, and using most of the power in forward flight for the pusher propeller rather than the rotor. Test flights and flight simulations were combined to improve test procedure. The fly-by-wire system is provided by Honeywell, the rotor by Eagle Aviation Technologies, anti-vibration technology from Moog Inc, and propeller by Aero Composites. The rotor hub can have 10-20 times the drag of the blade. Sikorsky intended to test hub fairings to reduce drag by 40%, and test flew fairings on the hubs themselves but not the central hub fairing ("aero sail") in between the hubs. Sikorsky has since patented a [...] "Standpipe" [...] (fixed tube between rotating rotor axes) suitable for a central hub fairing.|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{program to}} reduce aircraft jet turbulence noise investigated {{the interaction of}} small auxiliary jets with a larger main jet. Significant reductions in the far field jet noise were obtained over a range of <b>auxiliary</b> <b>jet</b> pressures and flow rates when {{used in conjunction with}} an acoustically lined ejector. While the concept {{is similar to that of}} conventional ejector suppressors that use mechanical mixing devices, the present approach should improve thrust and lead to lower weight and less complex noise suppression systems since no hardware needs to be located in the main jet flow. A variety of <b>auxiliary</b> <b>jet</b> and ejector configurations and operating conditions were studied. The best conditions tested produced peak to peak noise reductions ranging from 11 to 16 dB, depending on measurement angle, for <b>auxiliary</b> <b>jet</b> mass flows that were 6. 6 % of the main jet flow with ejectors that were 8 times the main jet diameter in length.

40|$|The mid-term {{experimental}} programme of the JET tokamak exploits its recently enhanced scientific capabilities (e. g., new divertor allowing high-triangularity ITER-relevant scenarios, {{several new}} diagnostics) to address critical issues potentially impacting the detailed design of ITER components (e. g., first wall, heating and current drive systems, diagnostics) and, in parallel, further develop ITER-operating scenarios and address specific physics issues of direct relevance to ITER (e. g., transport physics, burning plasma physics). For the longer term, activities on a "JET programme {{in support of}} ITER" have been launched, aiming at making optimal use of JET's unique features: large plasma size and capability to handle beryllium and tritium. A full replacement of the first wall materials is planned (beryllium in the main wall and tungsten in the divertor).

40|$|In {{recent years}} the use of high wing {{loadings}} on large high performance airplanes has emphasized the problem of take-off. In many cases the allowable gross weight is limited primarily by take-off considerations. The {{most effective way to}} decrease the take-off distance without decreasing wing loading is to increase the available thrust during take-off run and initial climb. The use of <b>auxiliary</b> <b>jet</b> propulsion has been proposed as a means of accomplishing this and considerable interest has been aroused in its development. A program of development and research on jet reaction motors using various types of fuels has been undertaken at the California Institute of Technology during the past year. The development of a jet motor using solid fuel (powder) has reached the stage where it is practical to begin actual flight test experiments with assisted take-offs. For this purpose the U. S. Army Air Corps has made available a YO- 55 (Ercoupe) Airplane for installation of <b>auxiliary</b> <b>jet</b> propulsion units and for flight testing. This report is concerned with a study of the various problems involved in the use of jet propulsion on an airplane, and the design of a practical installation on the YO- 55 airplane. After a study of the various factors involved, it was decided to use two jet propulsion assemblies each containing three separate jet motors of approximately 25 lbs. thrust. The assemblies are mounted under the center section of the wing, one on each side just inboard of the main landing wheel fairing. The motors are so designed that in case of an excessive pressure build-up, the nozzle will fly off to the rear {{and the rest of the}} motor will be propelled forward clear of the airplane. Particular emphasis was placed on safety of the pilot and the airplane structure. ...|$|E

The airplane is a two-place, midwing torpedo bomber equipped with a tractor propeller and an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>jet</b> engine. The effect of control setting and movement on the erect and inverted spin and recovery characteristics of the model were determined for the normal loading.

40|$|Research on {{propeller}} fans in underground drift stone mines {{has shown}} that significant ventilation improvements can be achieved. In large-entry mines {{that do not have}} any high resistance-sections (shafts> 100 ft long or shaft diameters < 12 ft), propeller fans can greatly increase the total system airflow. Propeller fans can be used as either main mine fans or as freestanding <b>auxiliary</b> (<b>jet)</b> fans. NIOSH researchers have documented the performance of two recently installed propeller fans in a working limestone mine (figure 1). Together the fans exhausted 750, 000 cfm at a rated hp of 200. These fans replaced an axial vane main mine fan that produced 300, 000 cfm at a rated hp of 250. The use of the propeller fans more than doubled the air quantity while operating at 50 hp less than the original main mine fan system. In addition, the new fans, when used with effective air-coursing methods such as stoppings, reduced or eliminated recirculation near the face areas. This is because propeller fans are more efficient at lower pressures and can produce large air quantities at lower horsepower requirements than axial vane fans.

40|$|In 1967 the US Air Force {{solicited}} {{proposals for}} ``low-disc-loading [Vertical Takeoff and Landing] configurations suitable for high speed flight. ' Bell Helicopter elected {{to respond with}} a proposal after initial analysis on configurations including a stopped edgewise disc and a trail rotor. They concluded that a folding proprotor design would best meet the requirements laid forth. Initial analysis work began on this folding proprotor (stop-fold) design {{in the same year}} and concluded in 1972 with a full scale 25 foot diameter pylon and rotor assembly wind tunnel test at the NASA-Ames Large Scale Wind Tunnel. The project was concluded at this point and never resulted in a production or research aircraft. The original proposed stop-fold tiltrotor design by Bell Helicopter allowed for vertical takeoff and landing, a transition sequence rotating the pylon rotor assembly from helicopter to airplane mode, a conversion sequence during which the rotor stopped and blades folded along the pylon, and a transition from prop thrust to <b>auxiliary</b> <b>jet</b> engine power while the rotor was being stopped. This configuration effectively removes the high-speed restraints typical of a prop-driven aircraft and instead opens a flight envelope comparable to a fixed-wing jet. This project entails both the simulation and basic analysis of the stop-fold concept with special attention to frequency responses and potential coupling between modes. M. S.
