500|$|In August 2011, Rebecca Francescatti, a Chicago-based singer, filed {{a lawsuit}} against Lady Gaga {{claiming}} that she had plagiarized elements of her 1999 recording [...] "Juda" [...] (It's <b>All</b> <b>About</b> <b>You)</b> for Gaga's 2011 single [...] "Judas". Francescatti's lawyer told TMZ: [...] "Though the songs are different styles, the composition is the same, and the chorus is the same melody. [...] is seeking recognition for what she created." [...] Francescatti noted that the similarities of the two songs could stem from the fact that her former bass player, Brian Gaynor, was now working for a company who wrote several tracks for Gaga's second album Born This Way (2011).|$|E

2500|$|Sackville-West {{loved to}} travel, {{frequently}} going to France, Spain and to visit Nicolson in Persia, and these trips were emotionally draining for Woolf, who missed Sackville-West intensely. Woolf's novel To the Lighthouse with its theme of longing {{for someone who}} is not there was inspired partly by the frequent absences of Sackville-West. Woolf was inspired by Sackville-West to write one of her most famous novels, , featuring a protagonist who changes sex over the centuries. This work was described by Sackville-West's son Nigel Nicolson as [...] "the longest and most charming love-letter in literature." [...] Unusually, Woolf documented the moment of the conception of Orlando: she wrote in her diary on 5 October 1927: [...] "And instantly the usual exciting devices enter my mind: a biography beginning in the year 1500 and continuing to the present day, called Orlando: Vita; only with a change about from one sex to the other" [...] (excerpt from her diary published posthumously by her husband Leonard Woolf). Woolf felt she needed Sackville-West's permission to write Orlando, asking in a letter: [...] "But listen, suppose Orlando turns out to be Vita and its <b>all</b> <b>about</b> <b>you</b> and the lusts of your flesh and the lure of your mind...Do you mind, say Yes or No?" [...] Reflecting Sackville-West's interest in the Romany, when Orlando goes to bed as a man and mysteriously wakes up as a woman in Constantinople (which is implied might have been the result of a spell cast by a Romany witch whom he married), it is at a Romany camp in the Balkans that Orlando is first welcomed and accepted as a woman, as the Romany in the novel make no distinctions between the sexes. [...] Ultimately Woolf satirizes Sackville-West's Romany fetish, as Orlando, an English aristocrat, prefers not to live in poverty as part of wandering Romany caravan in the Balkans, because the call of a settled life of the aristocracy at a country house in England proves to too strong for her, just as in real life Sackville-West fantasised about living the nomadic life of a Romany, but in reality preferred the settled life in the English countryside. [...] Orlando, which was intended as a fantasy where the character of Orlando (a stand-in for Sackville-West) inherits an estate not unlike Knole (which Sackville-West would have inherited as the eldest child if she had been a man) ironically marked the beginning of a tension between the two women. Sackville-West often complained in her letters that Woolf was more interested in writing a fantasy about her than in returning her gestures of affection in the real world. After finishing Orlando, Woolf wrote a letter to Sackville-West saying: [...] "For Promiscuous you are and that is all to be said about it. Look in the Index of Orlando-after Pippin and see what comes next-Promiscuity passim". In another letter, Woolf warned Sackville-West: [...] "Yes, you are an agile animal-no doubt about it-but as to your gambols being diverting...I'm not so sure...I'm a fair-minded woman. You only be careful with your gamboling or you'll find Virginia's soft crevices lined with hooks".|$|E
