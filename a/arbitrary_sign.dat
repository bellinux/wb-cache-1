Such are those, in which an analogous transference of the corresponding term may be remarked universally, or very generally, in other languages; and in which, of course, the uniformity of the result must be ascribed to the essential principles of the human frame. Even in such cases, however, it will by no means be always found, on examination, that the various applications of the same term have arisen from any common quality or qualities in the objects to which they relate. In the greater number of instances, they may be traced to some natural and universal associations of ideas, founded in the common faculties, common organs, and common condition of the human race.... According to the different degrees of intimacy and strength in the associations on which the transitions of language are founded, very different effects may be expected to arise. Where the association is slight and casual, the several meanings will remain distinct from each other, and will often, in process of time, assume the appearance of capricious varieties {{in the use of the}} same <b>arbitrary</b> <b>sign.</b> Where the association is so natural and habitual as to become virtually indissoluble, the transitive meanings will coalesce in one complex conception; and every new transition will become a more comprehensive generalization of the term in question.” ...|$|E

50|$|Among {{the several}} {{possible}} {{ways in which}} the concept of a conic can be generalized, the most widely used approach is to define it as a generalization of the ellipse. The starting point for this approach is to look upon an ellipse as a curve satisfying the 'two-focus property': an ellipse is a curve that is the locus of points the sum of whose distances from two given points is constant. The two points are the foci of the ellipse. The curve obtained by replacing the set of two fixed points by an arbitrary, but fixed, finite set of points in the plane {{can be thought of as}} a generalized ellipse. Generalized conics with three foci are called trifocal ellipses. This can be further generalized to curves which are obtained as the loci of points which move such that the some of weighted arithmetic mean of the distances from a finite set of points is a constant. A still further generalization is possible by assuming that the weights attached to the distances can be of <b>arbitrary</b> <b>sign,</b> namely, plus or minus. Finally, the restriction that the set of fixed points, called the set of foci of the generalized conic, be finite may also be removed. The set may be assumed to be finite or infinite. In the infinite case, the weighted arithmetic mean has to be replaced by an appropriate integral. Generalized conics in this sense are also called polyellipses, egglipses, or, generalized ellipses. Since such curves were considered by the German mathematician Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus (1651 - 1708) they are also known as Tschirnhaus'sche Eikurve. Also such generalizations have been discussed by Rene Descartes and by James Clerk Maxwell.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{problem of}} reconstructing signed {{permutations}} on n elements from their erroneous patterns distorted by reversal errors is considered in this paper. A reversal is {{the operation of}} taking {{a segment of the}} signed permutation, reversing it, and flipping the signs of its elements. The reversal metric is defined as the least number of reversals transforming one signed permutation into another. It is proved that for any n⩾ 2 an <b>arbitrary</b> <b>signed</b> permutation is uniquely reconstructible from three distinct signed permutations at reversal distance at most one from the signed permutation. The proposed approach is based on the investigation of structural properties of a Cayley graph G 2 n whose vertices form a subgroup of the symmetric group Sym 2 n. It is also proved that an <b>arbitrary</b> <b>signed</b> permutation is reconstructible from two distinct signed permutations with probability p 2 ∼ 13 as n→∞. In the case of at most two reversal errors it is shown that at least n(n+ 1) distinct erroneous patterns are required in order to reconstruct an <b>arbitrary</b> <b>signed</b> permutation...|$|R
