Methods We developed a budget impact analysis checklist and scoring system for budget impact <b>analyses,</b> which we then adapted for cost-effectiveness <b>analyses,</b> based on current International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research Task Force recommendations. We applied both budget impact analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis checklists and scoring systems to examine the extent to which existing economic evaluations provide sufficient evidence about budget impact to enable decision making. We used rotavirus vaccination as an illustrative case in which low- and middle-income countries uptake has been limited despite demonstrated cost effectiveness. A systematic literature review was conducted to identify economic evaluations of rotavirus vaccine in low- and middle-income countries published between January 2000 and February 2017. We critically appraised the quality of budget impact <b>analyses,</b> and assessed the extension of cost-effectiveness <b>analyses</b> to provide useful budget impact information.

There are statistical issues involved in performing subgroup <b>analyses,</b> however. These have been given considerable attention in the literature for <b>analyses</b> where subgroups are defined by a pre-randomization feature. Although subgroup <b>analyses</b> are often performed with sub-groups defined by a post-randomization feature—including <b>analyses</b> that estimate the treatment effect among compliers— discussion of these <b>analyses</b> has been neglected in the clinical literature. Such <b>analyses</b> pose a high risk of presenting biased descriptions of treatment effects. We summarize the chal-lenges of doing all types of subgroup <b>analyses</b> described in the literature. In particular, we emphasize issues with post-randomization subgroup <b>analyses.</b> Finally, we provide guide-lines on how to proceed across the spectrum of subgroup <b>analyses...</b>|$|R
