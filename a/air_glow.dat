50|$|The Rayleigh Unit is {{a unit of}} {{photon flux}} {{used to measure the}} {{radiance}} of <b>air</b> <b>glow,</b> atmospheric phenomena like auroras, and integrated starlight of various forms in space. The Rayleigh Unit was first proposed in 1956 by D. M. Hunten, Franklin E. Roach, and J. W. Chamberlain and named by them for Robert John Strutt, 4th Baron Rayleigh (1875-1947) who first discovered the glow of the night sky. The symbol for the unit is R, also like the unrelated Roentgen unit.|$|E

Besides being a technology testbed, it carried four scientific payloads (PLASMEX, MAGNEX, OCRAS and PHOTO), with a total weight of 10 kg, to investigate plasma bubbles in the geomagnetic field, <b>air</b> <b>glow,</b> and anomalous cosmic radiation fluxes. It was meant to circle the Earth on a circular orbit at 750 km altitude, inclined 17.5 ° from the Equator.|$|E
50|$|One airglow {{mechanism}} is when an atom of nitrogen combines with an atom of oxygen {{to form a}} molecule of nitric oxide (NO). In the process, a photon is emitted. This photon may have any of several different wavelengths characteristic of nitric oxide molecules. The free atoms are available for this process, because molecules of nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2) are dissociated by solar energy in {{the upper reaches of}} the atmosphere and may encounter each other to form NO. Other species that can create <b>air</b> <b>glow</b> in the atmosphere are hydroxyl (OH), atomic oxygen (O), sodium (Na) and lithium (Li). See Sodium layer.|$|E

5000|$|In 1953, Kozyrev {{attempted}} {{to analyze the}} phenomenon of ashen light, a nocturnal <b>air</b> <b>glow</b> on Venus whose existence remains controversial to this day. [...] He also made the earliest photometric measurements of the visible and ultraviolet spectrum of Venus. [...] His calculation of the thermal balance of Venus disputed the popular theory that the clouds of Venus consisted of dust. Kozyrev argued that energy absorbed in the upper atmosphere created high altitude storms, but the surface of Venus would be still and dimly lit. This work influenced the theory of Venus and Nobel Laureate Harold Urey devoted a paper to the analysis and implications of it.|$|E
50|$|On September 16, Alves {{succeeded in}} {{puncturing}} the capsule's aperture {{window with a}} screwdriver, allowing him to see a deep blue light coming from the tiny opening he had created. He inserted the screwdriver and successfully scooped {{out some of the}} glowing substance. Thinking it was perhaps a type of gunpowder, he tried to light it, but the powder would not ignite. The exact mechanism by which the light was generated was not known at the time the IAEA report was written, though it was thought to be either ionized <b>air</b> <b>glow,</b> fluorescence or Cherenkov radiation associated with the absorption of moisture by the source; similar blue light was observed in 1988 at Oak Ridge National Laboratory during the disencapsulation of a 137Cs source.|$|E
5000|$|Ionizing {{radiation}} {{is the cause}} of blue glow surrounding sufficient quantities of strongly radioactive materials in air, e.g. some radioisotope specimens (e.g. radium or polonium), particle beams (e.g. from particle accelerators) in air, the blue flashes during criticality accidents, and the eerie/low brightness [...] "purple" [...] to [...] "blue" [...] glow enveloping the mushroom cloud during the first several dozen seconds after nuclear explosions near sea level. An effect that has been observed only at night from atmospheric nuclear tests owing to its low brightness, with observers noticing it following the pre-dawn Trinity (test), Upshot-Knothole Annie, and the Cherokee shot of Operation Redwing. The emission of blue light is often incorrectly attributed to Cherenkov radiation.

50|$|A {{historically}} important {{instance of}} triboluminescence occurred in Paris in 1675. Astronomer Jean-Felix Picard observed that his barometer was {{glowing in the}} dark as he carried it. His barometer consisted of a glass tube that was partially filled with mercury. Whenever the mercury slid down the glass tube, the empty space above the mercury would glow. While investigating this phenomenon, researchers discovered that static electricity could cause low-pressure <b>air</b> to <b>glow.</b> This discovery revealed the possibility of electric lighting.|$|R

Photometric measurements of numerous background stars are combined with simultaneous sky brightness measurements to differentiate thin clouds from sky glow sources such as <b>air</b> <b>glow</b> and zodiacal light. The system takes a continuous pipeline of all-sky images, and compares them to canonical images taken on other nights at the same sidereal time.

50|$|The Pierre Auger Observatory {{is unique}} {{in that it is}} the first {{experiment}} that combines both ground detectors and fluorescence detectors at the same site thus allowing cross-calibration and reduction of systematic effects that may be peculiar to each technique. The Cherenkov detectors use three large photomultiplier tubes to detect the Cherenkov radiation produced by high-energy particles passing through water in the tank. The time of arrival of high-energy particles from the same shower at several tanks is used to calculate the direction of travel of the original particle. The fluorescence detectors are used to track the particle <b>air</b> shower's <b>glow</b> on cloudless moonless nights, as it descends through the atmosphere.|$|R

The research plan was to use twilight observations made by the Visible Airglow Experiment (VAE) on the Atmosphere Explorer 'E' satellite as proxy ground based twilight observations.

40|$|Computational {{simulations}} of <b>air</b> <b>glow</b> surface plasma {{in the presence}} of supersonic flow are presented. The glow discharge model is based on a self-consistent, multi-species, continuum description of the plasma with finite-rate chemistry effects. The glow discharge model is coupled with a compressible Navier-Stokes solver. The effect of the plasma discharge on M= 3 supersonic flow at freestream pressure 18 Torr and the corresponding effects of the flow on the discharge structure is studied by examining the species concentrations and the gas temperature. The peak gas temperature from the computations is 1270 K with the surface plasma alone, and 620 K {{in the presence of}} supersonic flow, both of which are comparable to experimental measurements of rotational temperature made under similar conditions. Different ion species are found to be dominant in the absence and presence of supersonic flow, highlighting the importance of including finite-rate chemistry effects in discharge models for understanding plasma actuator physical phenomena.

40|$|We {{report on}} night time <b>air</b> <b>glow</b> imaging {{observations}} of the low latitude ionosphere {{by means of a}} 630 -m all-sky imager in stalled in March 2006 at Yonaguni, Japan (24. 5 °N, 123. 0 °E; 14. 6 °N geomagnetic), about 100 km east of Taiwan. The imager detected medium-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances (MSTIDs) for about 7 hours on the night of 26 May 2006. A dense GPS net work in Japan also ob served the same MSTID event on this night. The imager and GEONET data indicate that most of the MSTIDs prop a gated south west ward from the north of Japan to the south of Yonaguni and Taiwan over 4000 km, with a southern limit of 19 °N (geomagnetic latitude 9 °N) or lower. On the night of 10 November 2006, the imager observed two weak emission bands that were embedded on the F-region anomaly crest to the south of Yonaguni. The simultaneous electron density profiles from the FORMOSAT- 3 /COS MIC mission demonstrate that the weak emission bands are due to density depletions in equatorial plasma bubbles. These case studies suggest that the Yonaguni imager in collaboration with other instruments is very suit able for the study of ionospheric disturbances in and around the northern F-region anomaly crest...|$|E
