5|$|Many of Oldham's present {{divisions}} and suburbs have origins as pre-industrial hamlets, manorial commons <b>and</b> <b>ancient</b> chapelries.

5|$|Andjar's toneels were {{generally}} based on day-to-day experiences, {{rather than the}} tales of princes <b>and</b> <b>ancient</b> wars which were standard at the time. Regarding Andjar's toneels, the Indonesian literary critic Bakri Siregar writes that Andjar's stage plays, {{as well as those}} of fellow dramatist Njoo Cheong Seng, revitalised the genre and made the works more realistic. However, he considered the conflict in these works to have been poorly developed. Andjar believed that the Padangsche Opera's performances influenced other troupes in West Sumatra to adapt the toneel format, which later spread throughout the Indies.|$|E

5|$|Beer {{is one of}} the world's oldest {{prepared}} beverages, possibly {{dating back}} to the early Neolithic or 9500 BC , when cereal was first farmed, and is recorded in the written history of ancient Iraq <b>and</b> <b>ancient</b> Egypt. Archaeologists speculate that beer was instrumental in the formation of civilisations. Approximately 5000 years ago, workers in the city of Uruk (modern day Iraq) were paid by their employers in beer. During the building of the Great Pyramids in Giza, Egypt, each worker got a daily ration of four to five litres of beer, which served as both nutrition and refreshment that was crucial to the pyramids' construction.|$|E
5|$|Champollion's {{interest}} in Egyptian {{history and the}} hieroglyphic script developed at an early age. At the age of sixteen, he gave a lecture before the Grenoble Academy in which {{he argued that the}} language spoken by the ancient Egyptians, in which they wrote the Hieroglyphic texts, was closely related to Coptic. This view proved crucial in becoming able to read the texts, and the correctness of his proposed relation between Coptic <b>and</b> <b>Ancient</b> Egyptian has been confirmed by history. This enabled him to propose that the demotic script represented the Coptic language.|$|E

There are four broad categories of relics and historical sites: tumuli and their artifacts; Buddhist sites and objects; fortresses and palace sites; <b>and</b> <b>ancient</b> architecture. Prehistoric remains including Mumun pottery have been excavated in central Gyeongju, in the Moa-ri and Oya-ri villages of the Cheonbuk-myeon district, and in the Jukdong-ri village of the Oedong-eup district.|$|E

5|$|Hybridization may be {{important}} in speciation in some plant groups. However, homoploid hybrid speciation (not {{increasing the number of}} sets of chromosomes) may be rare: by 1997, only 8 natural examples had been fully described. Experimental studies suggest that hybridization offers a rapid route to speciation, a prediction confirmed by the fact that early generation hybrids <b>and</b> <b>ancient</b> hybrid species have matching genomes, meaning that once hybridization has occurred, the new genome can remain stable.|$|E

There were initial archaeological excavations on the site in 1925, and then further work in 1970-71, 1993, 2007 and 2009. Erosion {{continues to be a}} threat to the castle's masonry, and as of 2010 English Heritage considered the castle's condition to be declining, with some parts at particular risk.|$|E

5|$|In much of {{the area}} {{bordering}} the wetlands, an abundance of produce, of great variety, can be cultivated. The green and varied landscape provides good grazing for livestock. In some areas the carboniferous limestone and the Dolomitic Conglomerate have been mineralised with lead and zinc ores. Evidence of early settlement comes from the Sweet Track, which was built from timber felled {{in the winter of}} 3807–06 BC, and lowland villages such as Glastonbury Lake Village and hill forts <b>and</b> <b>ancient</b> settlements on hills, many of which date from the Iron Age.

5|$|Kannada {{features}} a rich <b>and</b> <b>ancient</b> {{body of literature}} including religious and secular genre, covering topics as diverse as Jainism (such as Puranas), Veerashaivism (such as Vachanas), Vaishnavism (such as Haridasa Sahitya) and modern literature. Evidence from edicts {{during the time of}} Ashoka (reigned 274–232 BCE) suggest that Buddhist literature influenced the Kannada script and its literature. The Halmidi inscription, the earliest attested full-length inscription in the Kannada language and script, dates from 450 CE, while the earliest available literary work, the Kavirajamarga, has been dated to 850 CE. References made in the Kavirajamarga, however, prove that Kannada literature flourished in the native composition meters such as Chattana, Beddande and Melvadu during earlier centuries. The classic refers to several earlier greats (purvacharyar) of Kannada poetry and prose.|$|E
5|$|Once {{diamonds}} {{have been}} {{transported to the}} surface by magma in a volcanic pipe, they may erode out and be distributed over a large area. A volcanic pipe containing diamonds {{is known as a}} primary source of diamonds. Secondary sources of diamonds include all areas where a significant number of diamonds have been eroded out of their kimberlite or lamproite matrix, and accumulated because of water or wind action. These include alluvial deposits and deposits along existing <b>and</b> <b>ancient</b> shorelines, where loose diamonds tend to accumulate because of their size and density. Diamonds have also rarely been found in deposits left behind by glaciers (notably in Wisconsin and Indiana); in contrast to alluvial deposits, glacial deposits are minor and are therefore not viable commercial sources of diamond.|$|E
