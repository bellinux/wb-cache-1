5|$|Starting with Apollo 13, descent orbit {{insertion}} {{was to be}} performed using the Service Module engine instead of the LM engine, {{in order to allow}} a greater fuel reserve for landing. This was <b>actually</b> <b>done</b> {{for the first time on}} Apollo 14, since the Apollo 13 mission was aborted before landing.|$|E
5|$|An {{active sonar}} system was {{scheduled}} to be installed in June 1940, but it is uncertain when it was <b>actually</b> <b>done.</b> During the war, the ship's light anti-aircraft armament was augmented several times. Improved 2cm C/38 guns replaced the original C/30 guns and three additional guns were added sometime in 1941. The two guns on the aft shelter deck were replaced by a single 2cm quadruple Flakvierling mount, probably during her late 1941 refit. Richard Beitzen appears not have any additional AA guns added after this time.|$|E

5|$|On January 28, Khánh {{flew from}} Huế to Saigon dressed in {{civilian}} clothes on a commercial airliner. He covered for his ruse by claiming that he was travelling with United States military adviser Colonel Jasper Wilson and stating {{that he had come}} for a dental appointment. This came after Duc had arrived in I Corps earlier in the day with a message from the other plotters that Khánh was to be in Saigon to lead the coup on the day after. What Khánh had <b>actually</b> <b>done</b> was to send Wilson to Saigon earlier in the day to check with the embassy and confirm that Washington did support the coup.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} filming {{was carried}} out at Pinewood Studios, Shepperton Studios and Twickenham Studios in London. Extensive sequences also featured London, notably Trafalgar Square and the exterior of 10 Downing Street. Mereworth Castle in Kent {{was used as the}} home of Sir James Bond, which is blown up {{at the start of the}} film. Much of the filming for M's Scottish castle was <b>actually</b> <b>done</b> on location in County Meath, Ireland, with Killeen Castle, Dunsany, as the focus. However, the car chase sequences where Bond leaves the castle were shot in the Perthshire village of Killin with further sequences in Berkshire (specifically Old Windsor and Bracknell).|$|E
5|$|The new editor was Ejler Jakobsson, though Pohl {{continued}} to be listed as editor emeritus on the masthead until the July–August 1970 issue. Much of the editorial work was <b>actually</b> <b>done</b> by Judy-Lynn Benjamin, who was hired by Pohl in 1969 as an editorial assistant. The new regime failed to impress readers, and circulation dropped from over 67,000 for the year ending October 1968 to under 45,000 the following year, a drop of over 30%. If went bimonthly in May 1970, as Abramson attempted to juggle the frequency of publication of several of his titles to maximize profits; the page count and price were also adjusted more than once over the next year, again increasing profitability. Abramson also began a British distribution of If, reprinted with a separate cover, priced in British currency. Circulation figures of the time show an increase of about 6,000 copies, but if this includes sales in the UK is not clear.|$|E

25|$|At the retrial Courtney {{was given}} an eight-year prison {{sentence}} after confessing to manslaughter. His version of events, which was accepted by the court, was that Courtney believed {{he was to be}} involved only in a knee-capping of McCullough but that another person present had <b>actually</b> <b>done</b> the killing. Following his imprisonment, Barbara McCullough, the deceased's mother, claimed that Courtney had been a police agent and informer.|$|E

25|$|Another way to {{deal with}} it is to allow that {{experiments}} with processes of heat transfer to or from the system may be used to justify the formula (1) above. Moreover, it deals to some extent with the problem of lack of direct experimental evidence that the time order of stages of a process does not matter in the determination of internal energy. This way does not provide theoretical purity in terms of adiabatic work processes, but is empirically feasible, and is in accord with experiments <b>actually</b> <b>done,</b> such as the Joule experiments mentioned just above, and with older traditions.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, Mintzberg {{developed}} {{these five}} types of management strategy into 10 “schools of thought” and grouped them into three categories. The first group is normative. It {{consists of the}} schools of informal design and conception, the formal planning, and analytical positioning. The second group, consisting of six schools, {{is more concerned with}} how strategic management is <b>actually</b> <b>done,</b> rather than prescribing optimal plans or positions. The six schools are entrepreneurial, visionary, cognitive, learning/adaptive/emergent, negotiation, corporate culture and business environment. The third and final group consists of one school, the configuration or transformation school, a hybrid of the other schools organized into stages, organizational life cycles, or “episodes”.|$|E

25|$|By 1981, when work on {{the film}} began, Norshteyn had been working at Soyuzmultfilm (the main Soviet {{animation}} studio) for 13 years and had worked on some 40 films and directed or co-directed six. Progress was slow, with many interruptions (Norshteyn estimates that only about three years of work were <b>actually</b> <b>done).</b> Norshteyn says that Viktor Tinyaev (Виктор Тиняев) helped him during this period. In 1986, with only 10 minutes of the film completed, Norshteyn was fired from the Soyuzmultfilm studio {{in which he had}} worked. This was despite the fact that his films had gathered many international awards, and Tale of Tales had been voted the best animated film of all time by a large panel of international critics in 1984.|$|E
25|$|Christiaan Huygens was {{the first}} person {{informed}} by Fatio of his theory, but never accepted it. Fatio believed he had convinced Huygens of the consistency of his theory, but Huygens denied this in a letter to Gottfried Leibniz. There was also a short correspondence between Fatio and Leibniz on the theory. Leibniz criticized Fatio's theory for demanding empty space between the particles, which was rejected by him (Leibniz) on philosophical grounds. Jakob Bernoulli expressed an interest in Fatio's Theory, and urged Fatio to write his thoughts on gravitation in a complete manuscript, which was <b>actually</b> <b>done</b> by Fatio. Bernoulli then copied the manuscript, which now resides in the university library of Basel, and was the base of the Bopp edition.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, he also {{attended}} a small rally in Yorktown, Virginia. He {{served as a}} spokesman for a 2006 neo-Nazi march at the capitol in Lansing, Michigan. However, he brought unwanted attention to the NSM when the story of Jacques Pluss, a former professor at Farleigh Dickinson University {{who was a member}} of the group, became national news—Pluss claimed at the time that he was pretending to be a Nazi in order to study the group from within (he would later disavow this and confirm he was actually a Nazi, by which time his academic career had ended and he had become a fringe conspiracy theorist and bigot)--and White famously expounded on his views by both denying the Nazi Holocaust and declaring that the NSM wanted what the Nazis had <b>actually</b> <b>done</b> to Jews (outside of mass murder) to become American policy.|$|E
