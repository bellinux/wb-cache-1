5|$|Eighty-nine {{per cent}} of courts martial {{returned}} a guilty verdict, {{the vast majority}} of cases being for offences such as Absence Without Leave (the most common offence), drunkenness and insubordination. Terms of imprisonment were often suspended, to discourage soldiers from committing an offence to escape the front lines, but also to give a convicted man a chance to earn <b>a</b> <b>reprieve</b> for good conduct.|$|E
5|$|Aide Greg Schneiders {{suggested}} an unusual strategy, inspired by Glenn's personal campaign and voting style, of avoiding appealing to {{special interest groups}} and instead seeking support from ordinary Democratic primary voters. After Mondale defeated him for the nomination, Glenn carried $3million in campaign debt for over 20years before receiving <b>a</b> <b>reprieve</b> from the Federal Election Commission. He was considered as a vice-presidential candidate in 1984, 1988, and 1992.|$|E

5|$|Having taken heavy {{casualties}} and losing strategic superiority, Burbridge {{and his men}} conducted a disorganized withdrawal. The Confederates had succeeded in holding the rail breastworks, yet had expended most of their ammunition in doing so. Each Confederate infantryman had fired at least seventy-five rounds, with some firing significantly more. The Union commanders then ordered another charge with a cavalry regiment that reinforced the Union infantry. The unexpected fighting capabilities of the small Confederate force had temporarily created <b>a</b> <b>reprieve</b> for the salt works.|$|E
5|$|The North Korean force {{eventually}} withdrew {{after several}} unsuccessful attacks, having suffered heavy casualties. As it was disengaging from Masan, US Air Force aircraft caught the North Korean truck columns {{as they were}} retreating, inflicting significant damage on them and producing further casualties. This fight, {{with a number of}} smaller engagements in the region, effectively stopped the North Korean offensive on the southern flank of the Pusan Perimeter. It also gave both sides <b>a</b> <b>reprieve</b> from the fighting to resupply and re-enforce before engaging in the Battle of Pusan Perimeter shortly after.|$|E
5|$|The {{length and}} origin these eruptions has also varied. Events last {{anywhere}} between days and years, and occur {{at a number}} of different sites. Half of all eruptions occur at or near Kīlauea's summit caldera. Activity there was nearly continuous for much of the 19th century, and after <b>a</b> <b>reprieve</b> between 1894 and 1907, continued onwards until 1924. There have been five historical eruptions at the volcano's relatively southwestern rift zone, and 24 along its more active eastern rift zone, mostly along its upper section.|$|E

This, plus the knowledge that {{a large body of}} Japanese troops {{was in the process of}} relocating to Koli Point after the defeat in the Henderson Field battle, led the Americans to believe that the Japanese were about to conduct a major attack on the Lunga Perimeter from the Koli Point area.|$|E

5|$|After {{the fight}} at Taejon, UN forces were pushed back {{repeatedly}} before finally halting the North Korean advance {{in a series}} of engagements in the southern section of the country. Forces of the 3rd Battalion, 29th Infantry, newly arrived in the country, were wiped out at Hadong in a coordinated ambush by North Korean forces on July 27, opening a pass to the Pusan area from the west. Soon after, North Korean forces took Chinju, east of Hadong, pushing back the US 19th Infantry Regiment and leaving routes to Pusan open to direct North Korean attacks. The UN formations were subsequently able to defeat the North Koreans in the Battle of the Notch on August 2, halting their advance from the west. Suffering mounting losses, the KPA force withdrew for several days to re-equip and receive reinforcements. This granted both sides <b>a</b> <b>reprieve</b> to prepare for the attack on the Pusan Perimeter.|$|E

5|$|Diệm's {{government}} put Ba Cụt on trial. During the proceedings, Ba Cụt theatrically {{removed his}} shirt {{so that the}} public gallery could see how many scars he had suffered while fighting the communists. This, according to him, demonstrated his devotion to Vietnamese nationalism. He challenged any other man to show as many scars. The Diệmist judge was unimpressed. Ba Cụt {{was found guilty of}} multiple murders and sentenced to death. Diệm's adviser, Colonel Edward Lansdale from the CIA, was one of many who protested against the decision. Lansdale felt that the execution would tarnish Diệm—who had proclaimed the Republic of Vietnam (commonly known as South Vietnam) and declared himself President—and antagonise Ba Cụt's followers. Ngô Đình Nhu, Diệm's younger brother and chief adviser, denied <b>a</b> <b>reprieve</b> as the army, particularly Minh, opposed any clemency. Some sections of the southern public, however, were sympathetic to Ba Cụt.|$|E

5|$|Early on September4, the {{hurricane}} moved beneath a large upper-level anticyclone which provided <b>a</b> <b>reprieve</b> from the strong southwesterly wind shear. Although its convective organization {{had yet to}} become fully symmetrical, an eye became increasingly apparent on infrared imagery. The center moved very near the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's buoy 41044—which registered a maximum sustained wind of 90mph (145km/h) and a maximum wind gust of —around 12:00UTC, indicating that Katia had intensified into a Category2 hurricane. Although an eyewall replacement cycle briefly caused the storm's convective pattern to deteriorate, Katia attained major hurricane status—a Category3 or higher on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale—by 12:00UTC on September5. Twelve hours later, the cyclone further intensified into a Category4 hurricane and attained peak winds of 140mph (220km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 942mbar (hPa; 27.82inHg) as its eye warmed, deep convection became much more symmetric about the center, and upper-level outflow expanded.|$|E
5|$|Jenks' Day Off is a 1910 American silent short comedy {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film follows Mr. Jenks' who drafts a telegram to himself {{as an excuse to}} get <b>a</b> <b>reprieve</b> from boredom and his wife's requests. He walks along the beach and finds a secluded spot to go swimming. A convict in women's clothing swaps his clothes with Jenks and Jenks has no choice to but to wear the discarded clothes. On his way back, Jenks answers a call for help and is mistaken for the robber. He is captured and has to explain circumstances which lead to awkward situation. Production and casting credits for the film are unknown, but likely Thanhouser staff offer possible identities of the writer and actors. The film was released on August 2, 1910 and was met with approval by the trade publication. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|Ronny Deila's first {{competitive}} {{match in}} charge of Celtic was a Champions League qualifying tie away against KR Reykjavik on 15 July 2014, which ended in a 1–0 win with midfielder Callum McGregor scoring the decisive goal on 84 minutes. Celtic eased to a 4–0 win in the return match in Scotland, but were comprehensively beaten and outplayed in the next qualifying round, losing 6–1 on aggregate to Legia Warsaw. Despite this, Celtic were given <b>a</b> <b>reprieve</b> when {{it was discovered that}} Legia had fielded an ineligible player in the second leg, Bartosz Bereszynski coming on as a substitute in the last four minutes. UEFA punished the Polish club by awarding the game a 3–0 to Celtic, levelling the aggregate score at 4–4 and seeing the Scottish champions progress on away goals. Despite this astonishing piece of luck, Celtic failed abjectly to take advantage in the final qualifier against Maribor, losing 2–1 on aggregate to drop down to the Europa League.|$|E

Three days later a messenger, sent by Marks, returned to the fleet; Marks's boat had capsized and delayed their arrival in Charles Town. Teach granted <b>a</b> <b>reprieve</b> of two days, but still the party did not return. He then called a meeting of his fellow sailors and moved eight ships into the harbour, causing panic within the town. When Marks finally returned to the fleet, he explained what had happened.

5|$|As usual, {{the tone}} of the epigram is {{somewhat}} fawning toward his patron, Titus, but it gives more detail than any other account of the games. It seems to imply that a draw was uncommon in gladiatorial combat at this level, but that Titus eventually yielded to the wishes of the crowd, declared the match equal, and granted both men their freedom (with the traditional presentation of the wooden sword). The traditional way of acknowledging defeat was for the yielding gladiator to raise a finger (ad digitum), and it is possible that in this case both men raised their fingers, but Martial's emphasis here is on Titus' even-handedness and generosity in granting <b>a</b> <b>reprieve</b> (missio) to the crowd's two favourites. His reference to this only happening under Titus probably alludes to the declaration of both as victors, as there is evidence that neither ties nor the survival of both gladiators in a contest were uncommon: it was expensive to train and keep a gladiator and they were not despatched lightly. There is some evidence for the existence of both Priscus and Verus, at least as names of gladiators, outside of Martial's account. A first-century graveyard in Smyrna contains the grave of a gladiator named Priscus, and Verus' name is etched on a marble slab from Ferentinum, recording a gladiatorial contest. The details of Verus' fights are unfortunately not legible. While neither of these may be the Priscus and Verus mentioned by Martial they do attest to the use of these names by gladiators.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of England's second innings, Washbrook took a single from Lindwall, who {{promptly}} removed Emmett for a duck. Lindwall pitched an outswinger on the line of off stump and Emmett edged it to wicket-keeper Tallon, who dived and took it in his right hand. This brought Lindwall’s tormentor Edrich to the crease. Bradman advised Lindwall not to bounce Edrich, fearing this would be interpreted as retaliation and generate negative media attention. However, Miller retaliated with four consecutive bouncers, angering the crowd. He struck Edrich on the body before Bradman and ordered him to stop; the Australian captain apologised to Edrich for the hostile bowling. Lindwall bounced Washbrook and was no balled by umpire Dai Davies for dragging his foot beyond the line. After a disagreement, Davies threw Lindwall his jumper, but the tension faded away and the paceman was not no balled again after discussing the matter with Bradman. Lindwall bounced Washbrook again {{and this time the}} England opener went for the hook shot. The ball flew off the top edge in the air, straight towards Hassett at fine leg, who dropped the catch after juggling three times. Having received <b>a</b> <b>reprieve</b> on 21, Washbrook settled down and reached 50 in only 70 minutes with England at 1/80.|$|E
