5|$|Anxiety {{disorder}} and {{major depressive disorder}} {{are the most common}} conditions seen at the same time; comorbidity of these in persons with AS is estimated at 65%. Reports have associated AS with medical conditions such as <b>aminoaciduria</b> and ligamentous laxity, but these have been case reports or small studies and no factors have been associated with AS across studies. One study of males with AS found an increased rate of epilepsy and a high rate (51%) of nonverbal learning disorder. AS is associated with tics, Tourette syndrome, and bipolar disorder, and the repetitive behaviors of AS have many similarities with the symptoms of obsessive–compulsive {{disorder and}} obsessive–compulsive personality disorder. However many of these studies are based on clinical samples or lack standardized measures; nonetheless, comorbid conditions are relatively common.|$|E
25|$|Proximal RTA (pRTA) {{is caused}} by a failure of the {{proximal}} tubular cells to reabsorb filtered bicarbonate from the urine, leading to urinary bicarbonate wasting and subsequent acidemia. The distal intercalated cells function normally, so the acidemia is less severe than dRTA and the alpha intercalated cells can produce H+ to acidify the urine to a pH of less than 5.3. pRTA also has several causes, and may occasionally be present as a solitary defect, but is usually associated with a more generalized dysfunction of the proximal tubular cells called Fanconi syndrome, in which there is also phosphaturia, glycosuria, <b>aminoaciduria,</b> uricosuria, and tubular proteinuria.|$|E

5000|$|Dicarboxylic <b>aminoaciduria</b> {{involves}} excretion of urinary glutamate and aspartate, {{resulting from}} the incomplete reabsorption of anionic amino acids from the glomerular filtrate in the kidney. This affects a diseased individual's amino acid pool, as {{they will have to}} spend additional resources to replenish the amino acids which would have otherwise been present. Additionally, glutamate transporters are responsible for the synaptic release of the glutamate (neurotransmitter) within the interneuronal synaptic cleft. This hindrance of functionality in individuals with dicarboxylic <b>aminoaciduria</b> may be related to growth retardation, intellectual disability, and a tendency toward fasting hypoglycemia and ketoacidosis [...] Dicarboxylic <b>aminoaciduria</b> is diagnosed by finding the increased presence of glutamate and aspartate in the urine.|$|E
50|$|Affected {{children}} are developmentally delayed with dwarfism, rickets and osteoporosis. Renal tubular disease is usually present causing <b>aminoaciduria,</b> glycosuria and hypokalemia.|$|E

In the case of dicarboxylic <b>aminoaciduria,</b> where glutamate and aspartate transport are impaired, the alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism are affected. Enterocytes in the intestines break up peptides into residual amino acids where they would normally use charge-specific amino acid transporters to get across the epithelial cells. In dicarboxylic <b>aminoaciduria,</b> the anionic amino acid transporter, EAAT3, cannot bring glutamate and aspartate across epithelial cells, leading to them being excreted via the urine.|$|E

50|$|Dent's {{disease was}} first {{described}} by Charles Enrique Dent and M. Friedman in 1964, when they reported two unrelated British boys with rickets associated with renal tubular damage characterized by hypercalciuria, hyperphosphaturia, proteinuria, and <b>aminoaciduria.</b> This set of symptoms {{was not given}} a name until 30 years later, when the nephrologist Oliver Wrong more fully described the disease.Wrong had studied with Dent and chose to name the disease after his mentor. Dent's disease is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the gene CLCN5, which encodes a kidney-specific voltage-gated chloride channel, a 746-amino-acid protein (CLC-5) with 12 to 13 transmembrane domains. It manifests itself through low-molecular-weight proteinuria, hypercalciuria, <b>aminoaciduria</b> and hypophosphataemia. Because of its rather rare occurrence, Dent's disease is often diagnosed as idiopathic hypercalciuria, i.e., excess calcium in urine with undetermined causes.|$|E
50|$|In {{overflow}} <b>aminoaciduria,</b> abnormally {{high concentrations}} of amino acids in the blood plasma overwhelm the resorptive capacity of the renal tubules, resulting in {{high concentrations of}} amino acids in the urine.

There is also {{an increased risk of}} hepatocellular carcinoma.The kidney dysfunction presents as Fanconi syndrome: Renal tubular acidosis, hypophosphatemia and <b>aminoaciduria.</b> Cardiomyopathy, neurologic and dermatologic manifestations are also possible. The urine has an odor of cabbage or rancid butter.|$|E
50|$|Hartnup {{disease is}} {{inherited}} as an autosomal recessive trait. Heterozygotes are normal. Consanguinity is common. The failure of amino-acid transport {{was reported in}} 1960 from the increased presence of indoles (bacterial metabolites of tryptophan) and tryptophan in the urine of patients {{as part of a}} generalized <b>aminoaciduria</b> of the disease. The excessive loss of tryptophan from malabsorption was the cause of the pellagra like symptoms. From studies on ingestion of tryptophan it seemed that there was a generalized problem with amino-acid transport. In 2004, a causative gene, SLC6A19, was located on band 5p15.33. SLC6A19 is a sodium-dependent and chloride-independent neutral amino acid transporter, expressed predominately in the kidneys and intestine.|$|E

50|$|Sodium nitroprusside {{is used in}} a {{separate}} urinalysis test known as the cyanide nitroprusside test or Brand's test. In this test, sodium cyanide is added first to urine and let stand for about 10 minutes. In this time, disulfide bonds will be broken by the released cyanide. The destruction of disulfide bonds liberates cysteine from cystine as well as homocysteine from homocystine. Next, sodium nitroprusside {{is added to the}} solution and it reacts with the newly freed sulfhydryl groups. The test will turn a red/purple colour if the test is positive, indicating significant amounts of amino acids were in the urine (<b>aminoaciduria).</b> Cysteine, cystine, homocysteine, and homocystine all react when present in the urine when this test is performed. This test can indicate inborn errors of amino acid transporters such as cystinuria, which results from pathology in the transport of dibasic amino acids.|$|E
40|$|A novel {{missense}} mutation in SLC 5 A 2 encoding SGLT 2 underlies autosomal-recessive renal glucosuria and <b>aminoaciduria.</b> BackgroundFamilial renal glucosuria (FRG) is an isolated disorder of proximal tubular glucose transport, characterized by abnormal urinary glucose excretion {{in the presence}} of normal blood glucose levels. Generalized <b>aminoaciduria</b> has not generally been considered a feature of this disorder. FRG has recently been shown to result from mutations in SLC 5 A 2, encoding the kidney-specific low-affinity/high-capacity Na+/glucose cotransporter, SGLT 2. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the phenotypic and genetic characteristics of three unrelated consanguineous families with FRG accompanied by <b>aminoaciduria.</b> MethodsSix children with autosomal-recessive FRG and 12 unaffected family members were evaluated at the clinical and molecular levels. DNA sequence analysis of the entire coding sequence of SLC 5 A 2 was performed in all affected individuals. Haplotype analysis using four polymorphic markers flanking SLC 5 A 2 was performed in all study participants. ResultsAll affected children were asymptomatic, but displayed massive glucosuria (83 to 169 g/ 1. 73 m 2 /day) accompanied by generalized <b>aminoaciduria.</b> Sequence analysis in all patients revealed a novel homozygous {{missense mutation}} in exon 8 of SLC 5 A 2, resulting in a lysine to arginine substitution at position 321 of SGLT 2 amino acid sequence (K 321 R). The mutation was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis and was found to completely cosegregate with the FRG phenotype. Haplotype analysis is consistent with identity by descent for the mutation. The K 321 residue, presumed to be located in the eighth transmembrane domain of SGLT 2, is highly conserved across SGLT homologues. ConclusionOur findings confirm that mutations in SLC 5 A 2 result in autosomal-recessive FRG. The severe glucosuria in homozygotes for the K 321 R mutation highlights the importance of the eighth SGLT 2 transmembrane domain for normal glucose transport. We suggest that the generalized <b>aminoaciduria</b> accompanying FRG is a consequence of the severe impairment in glucose reabsorption, and is probably not directly related to the SGLT 2 mutation. The exact role of the aberrant glucose transport in the pathogenesis of <b>aminoaciduria</b> remains to be established...|$|E

40|$|I T is {{generally}} considered that in the nephrotic syndrome the renal tubules retain their functional integrity even when their histological appearance is abnormal. The tubular reabsorption of such substances as sodium, ohloride, and water may be nearly complete, indicating an absorptive efficiency no {{less than that of}} normal renal tubules. The commonly used tests of tubular function, such as the ability of the kidneys to produce a concentrated urine or to excrete 53 -aminohippurate, give normal results until the renal disease is far advanced (Brack, Rapoport, and Rubin, 1954). On the other hand, an occasional nephrotic patient who appears to be otherwise typical is found to have impair-ment of one or more specific tubular functions. The lesion may be present when the patient is first examined, and no satisfactory explanation for its occurrence is forthcoming.
