5|$|Many {{programming}} {{languages are}} already widely accepted and understood. However, {{the desire to}} create radically different programming languages to support the aspect-oriented programming paradigm is not significant due to business-related concerns; there <b>are</b> <b>risks</b> associated with adopting new technologies. Use of an entirely new language relies on a business's ability to acquire new developers. Additionally, the existing code base of a business {{would need to be}} discarded. Finally, a business would need to acquire a new toolchain (suite of tools) for development, which is often both an expense in both money and time. Primary concerns about roadmaps for the adoption of new technologies tend to be the need to train new developers and adapt existing processes to the new technology.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{performance}} of liability rules in two-party stochastic externality problems where negotiations are feasible and side payments {{are based on the}} realized level of externalities. Results show that an increase in polluter liability does not necessarily increase safety or efficiency in cases where the polluter <b>is</b> <b>risk</b> neutral. Complete polluter liability is found to yield Pareto optimality. When either party <b>is</b> <b>risk</b> averse, an increase in polluter liability may sometimes reduce safety and efficiency. If the polluter <b>is</b> <b>risk</b> neutral and the victim <b>is</b> <b>risk</b> averse, Pareto optimality is only achieved by assigning full liability on the polluter, i. e. giving the victim complete property rights to a clean environment. If the polluter <b>is</b> <b>risk</b> averse and the victim <b>is</b> <b>risk</b> neutral, no level of polluter liability is optimal. In this case, optimality can only be achieved through a contract on abatement activities, such that the risk-averse polluter receives a guaranteed payment regardless of the stochastic outcome. ...|$|R

The failure to fully appreciate the relation between uncovered interest parity and risk premiums has probably contributed to our failure to understand why UIP fails empirically...|$|R

The effects of menopause can lead to vaginal dryness (due to a decrease in vaginal lubrication), which causes vaginal discomfort on its own or discomfort or pain during sexual intercourse. This can be alleviated with hormone replacement therapy, estrogen-containing vaginal creams, or non-prescription, non-hormonal products, but there <b>are</b> <b>risks</b> and adverse effects associated with hormone replacement therapy.|$|E

Memorial services for the September 11 attacks include the release of captive-bred monarchs. Monarchs are used in schools and nature centers for educational purposes. Many homeowners raise monarchs in captivity as a hobby and for educational purposes.|$|E
25|$|Beyond addiction, both {{short and}} {{long-term}} nicotine exposure have not been established as dangerous to adults, except among certain vulnerable groups. At high-enough doses, nicotine is associated with poisonings and is potentially lethal. Nicotine {{as a tool for}} quitting smoking has a good safety history. There is inadequate research to show that nicotine itself is associated with cancer in humans. Nicotine in the form of nicotine replacement products is less of a cancer risk than smoking. Nicotine is linked to possible birth defects. During pregnancy, there <b>are</b> <b>risks</b> to the child later in life for type 2 diabetes, obesity, hypertension, neurobehavioral defects, respiratory dysfunction, and infertility. The use of electronic cigarettes, which are designed to be refilled with nicotine-containing e-liquid, has raised concerns over nicotine overdoses, especially with regard to the possibility of young children ingesting the liquids.|$|E

25|$|While the {{rudimentary}} {{method of}} testing pH is to expose the grape juice to a pH indicator such as the strips used for a standard litmus test, the results are usually not as detailed and accurate as {{what is needed to}} evaluate ripeness. Therefore, most wineries will us a pH meter that can give readings to an accuracy of plus or minus 0.1. As with sugars and acids, the ideal pH levels to determine ripeness will vary. For white wines, winemakers often look for pH readings between 3.1 and 3.2, while would be a maximum of 3.4. If the pH is too high, it may be a sign that the grapes are overripe (or that the soil has too much potassium which will also influence pH readings). While there <b>are</b> <b>risks</b> to letting the pH go too high, winemakers can counter high pH by adding more tartaric or malic acid during the winemaking. However many viticulturists and winemakers uses pH readings as a strong boundary line for when to start the harvest.|$|E
500|$|J. C. Jenkins, Second Parliamentary Counsel at the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, has {{expressed}} some approval at the decision. Firstly, {{he claims that}} it will significantly change the way legislation is drafted. Prior to Pepper, draftsmanship was a [...] "time consuming" [...] and [...] "frustrating rather than enlightening" [...] business. There <b>are</b> <b>risks</b> of [...] "excessive detail, over-elaboration, verbosity, prolixity, iteration, tedious repetition", and so a draftsman avoids directly dealing with every single problem, instead following the rule set out by the Renton Committee to ensure that [...] "sufficient certainty is obtained for a fair-minded and reasonable reader to be in no doubt what is intended, it being assumed {{that no one would}} take entirely perverse points against the draft, or that such points would be brushed aside by the court". The draftsman may be in conflict with a government official who wishes to be overly specific, where this general rule renders their concerns moot; in such situations, the ability to include a passage of a Minister's speech as a way to ensure that the courts will interpret legislation in a specific way may clear up any doubts they feel. As such, Jenkins feels that Pepper may make the jobs of parliamentary draftsmen much easier. Although one academic called Pepper a [...] "long overdue" [...] decision from [...] "which there is no turning back", the overall reaction was a negative one. The decision can be interpreted as promoting legislative supremacy, a key point in a system where parliamentary sovereignty is confirmed.|$|E

40|$|Making {{effective}} decisions under risk {{often requires}} making accurate predictions of other people's decisions under risk. We experimentally assess {{the accuracy of}} people's predictions of others' risky choices. In four studies, we find evidence of systematic inaccuracy: predictions of others' choices are too regressive. That is, people predict that others' choices will <b>be</b> closer to <b>risk</b> neutrality than those choices actually are. Where people <b>are</b> <b>risk</b> seeking, they predict that others will <b>be</b> <b>risk</b> seeking but substantially less so; likewise, where people <b>are</b> <b>risk</b> averse, they predict that others will <b>be</b> <b>risk</b> averse but substantially less so. Put differently, people predict that others' choices will reveal a more muted form of prospect theory's fourfold pattern of risk preferences than actually prevails. Two psychological concepts, the notion of risk-as-feelings and of an empathy gap, help account for regressive mispredictions. We explore several debiasing techniques suggested by these notions and also find that self-reported ratings of empathy moderate the magnitude of regressive mispredictions. risk, uncertainty, affect...|$|R
