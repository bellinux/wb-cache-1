Jack struggles to survive, but decides to host <b>a</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> dinner for those poorer than himself. His uncle sees Jack has learned his lesson and secretly prepares a feast set while Jack sleeps. After the guest arrives, the uncle reveals himself and all ends well. The film was released on November 22, 1910, and was met with favorable reviews. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

5|$|A Very Gaga Thanksgiving is <b>a</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> {{television}} {{special that}} originally aired on November 24, 2011, in the United States on ABC.

5|$|George's silver jubilee in 1888 {{was celebrated}} {{throughout}} the Hellenic world, and Athens {{was decorated with}} garlands for the anniversary of his accession on 30 October. Visitors included the Crown Prince of Denmark, the Prince and Princess of Wales, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh, Grand Dukes Sergei and Paul of Russia, and Djevad Pasha from the Ottoman Empire, who presented the King with two Arabian horses as gifts. Jubilee events in the week of 30 October included balls, galas, parades, <b>a</b> <b>thanksgiving</b> service at the Metropolitan Cathedral of Athens, and a lunch for 500 invited guests in a blue and white tent on the Acropolis.|$|E
5|$|Jim Martin, {{positioned}} {{in the lower}} right, gives a coy and perhaps mischievous glance back at the viewer. He {{is a microcosm of}} the entire scene in which no one appears to be giving thanks in a traditional manner of <b>a</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> dinner. Solomon finds it a departure from previous depictions of Thanksgiving in that the participants do not lower their heads or raise their hands in the traditional poses of prayer. She sees it as an example of treating American traditions in both sanctified and casual ways. Theologian David Brown sees gratitude as implicit in the painting, while Kenneth Bendiner writes that Rockwell was mindful of the Last Supper and that the painting's perspective echoes its rendition by Tintoretto.|$|E
5|$|That Ouania is Govan is now {{reasonably}} certain, but {{the location}} of Newanbirig is less so. Although there are very many Newburghs, it is Newburgh-on-Tyne near Hexham {{that has been the}} preferred location. An alternative interpretation of the events of 756 has been advanced: it identifies Newanbirig with Newborough by Lichfield in the kingdom of Mercia. A defeat here for Eadberht and Óengus by Æthelbald's Mercians would correspond with the claim in the Saint Andrews foundation legends that a king named Óengus son of Fergus founded the church there as <b>a</b> <b>thanksgiving</b> to Saint Andrew for saving him after a defeat in Mercia.|$|E

5|$|The Bears {{entered the}} 2015 season with hopes of {{improving}} their 5–11 record in 2014. The team started {{the regular season}} on a poor note, losing their first three games. In the following eight games, the team went 5–3, including <b>a</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> win over the rival Green Bay Packers. However, the Bears then lost the first three games in December, and were officially eliminated from playoff contention in week fourteen by the Washington Redskins. In week sixteen against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the Bears improved upon their 2014 record with a 26–21 win. After losing in {{the final game of}} the season to the Detroit Lions, the Bears ended the season 6–10 and last in the NFC North.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on VHS home video in 1989 by MCA/Universal Home Video (with a reissue in 1992) and was first broadcast on television on CBS on May 5, 1984 (edited to 100 minutes), to capitalize on Michael Jackson's massive popularity at the time. It continues to be broadcast periodically on networks such as BET, TVOne, VH1 Soul, and was the inaugural broadcast on the Bounce TV digital broadcast network. The Wiz is often broadcast on Thanksgiving Day (attributed to the opening scene of Dorothy's family gathered for <b>a</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> dinner).|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the lack}} of manpower, the US Eighth Army had three and half times the {{firepower}} of the opposing Chinese forces. The US Fifth Air Force, which {{was responsible for the}} air support, also had little opposition due to {{the lack of}} anti-aircraft weapons by the Chinese. Boosted by <b>a</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> feast with roasted turkeys on the eve of the advance, the morale was high among the UN ranks, and home by Christmas and Germany by spring was in everyone's mind. The high morale, however, caused a degradation of troop discipline, and most of the soldiers had discarded their equipment and ammunition supply before the battle. A rifle company from the US IX Corps, for example, started its advance with most of the helmets and bayonets thrown away, and there were on average less than one grenade and 50 rounds of ammunition carried per man. Because the UN planners did not foresee that the war would be dragged into a winter campaign, all elements of the Eighth Army started the offensive with a shortage of winter clothing.|$|E

At the Jubilee service, the Chief Justice of New South Wales, Tom Bathurst, read the first lesson and the service concluded with the Australian National Anthem and an organ postlude of Edward Elgar's Pomp and Circumstance March No. 4.

5|$|The Penguins {{began the}} regular season on October 5 visiting the Carolina Hurricanes.

Through November 21, the Penguins {{acquired}} a record of 8–11–2, going 2–6–1 against Atlantic Division teams in November including a four-game losing streak, their longest of the season. Following <b>a</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> Day shootout victory against the Ottawa Senators, the Penguins won seven of the next eight games, including the franchise's first sweep of a Western Canada road trip. Beginning on December 23, the Penguins compiled a point streak of ten games, including eight consecutive victories, the longest winning streak for the Penguins in nearly ten years. In January and February, the team was 16–6–5, climbing the conference standings with the help of goaltender Ty Conklin and center Evgeni Malkin. During the final full month, in March, the team was 10–4–1, and 7–0–0 at home in Mellon Arena. The team concluded {{the regular season}} with a home-and-home series against the Philadelphia Flyers, with each team winning a game.|$|E
