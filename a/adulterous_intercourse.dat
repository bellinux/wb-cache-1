5000|$|If the pursuer {{establishes}} an irretrievable {{breakdown of}} the marriage on grounds of adultery or behaviour then they can obtain a divorce immediately, while the other grounds require some period of prior separation. Circumstantial evidence can be provided to support {{the claims of the}} pursuer and the case is determined [...] "on the balance of probability" [...] rather than [...] "beyond a reasonable doubt". Therefore, for example, evidence of a husband staying in a hotel room with another woman for a night will likely establish adultery, even if sexual intercourse cannot be proved. The pursuer cannot seek a divorce based on their own adultery and the <b>adulterous</b> sexual <b>intercourse</b> committed by the defender must have been voluntary. To found a divorce on the behaviour of the defender the behaviour must be such as a reasonable person could not be expected to live with the defender. The behaviour can be from one event, though showing a pattern is more likely to convince the court, and it is irrelevant if the behaviour is passive or active or caused by a mental abnormality. There is no exact list of what behaviour will constitute grounds and the case law is filled with different examples. The finding by the court that the defender is at [...] "fault" [...] for the divorce will, however, not affect the amount of financial provision awarded or arrangements regarding any children.|$|R
