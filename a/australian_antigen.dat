50|$|As a young {{research}} fellow in 1964, Alter co-discovered the <b>Australian</b> <b>antigen</b> with Baruch Blumberg. This work {{was a major}} factor in isolating the hepatitis B virus. Later, Alter led a Clinical Center project to store blood samples used to uncover the causes and reduce the risk of transfusion-associated hepatitis. Based on his work, the United States started blood and donor screening programs that lowered the cause of hepatitis due to this risk from 30 percent in 1970 to nearly 0.|$|E
40|$|A RELATIONSHIP HAS BEEN PROVED AMONG <b>AUSTRALIAN</b> <b>ANTIGEN</b> AND THE PERSONNEL OF SOME HOSPITALS AND THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY ARE SUMMARIZED. 1. AMONG 320 PERSONS THE FREQUENCY OF THE <b>AUSTRALIAN</b> <b>ANTIGEN</b> WAS FOUND TO BE 8, 75 WHICH IS CONSIDERABLY HIGHER THAN THAT (0, 8 - 5, 2 %) BEING FOUND IN THE HEALTHY POPULATION OF FOREIGN COUNTRIES AS WELL AS IN GREECE. 2. THE FREQUENCY OF THE ANTIGEN WASHIGHER AMONG THE MALES (I. E. 13, 3 %) RATHER THAN AMONG THE FEMALES (I. E. 7, 69 %). 3. IT HAS BEEN OBSERVED PREVALENCE OF THE <b>AUSTRALIAN</b> <b>ANTIGEN</b> AMONG THE DOCTORS THAN AMONG THE SISTERS AND THE TECHNICIANS OF THE BACTERIOLOGIC LABORATORIES. HOWEVER THAT DIFFERENCE WAS NOT FOUND STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. 4. THE FREQUENCY OF THE ANTIGEN WAS PROVED TO BE INCREASED IN CORRELATION WITH THE AGE. THAT WAS DUE TO THE LONGER OF EXPOSURE TO THE AU ANTIGENE - ASSOCIATED B HEPATITIS. 5. CONSIDERING THE FINDINGS OF THIS RESEARCH AS WELL AS OF VARIOUS PREVIOUS ONES, IT IS ASSUMED THAT THE STAFF AND PATIENTS OF HOSPITALS ARE INFECTED TO A HIGH DEGREE. THIS INCREASED ANTIGENEMIA. IS CONSIDERED AS THE RESULT OF THE LONG EXPOSURE DUE TO THE PROFESIONAL REQUIREMENTS. 6. THERE HAVE BEEN FOUND 10 CASES (OUT OF 320) OF DUBIONS SEARCHINGS OF <b>AUSTRALIAN</b> <b>ANTIGEN,</b> WHICH(CASES) TEND TO BE CONSIDERED AS POSITIVE ACCORDING TO THE LAST RESEARCHES. 7. IN CONCLUSION IT HAS BEEN POINTED OUT THAT NECESSARY MEASURES SHOULD BE TAKEN IN ORDER TO PREVENT THE HEPATITIS B INFECTION IN THE HOSPITALS. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{discovery}} of the Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a typical example {{of the role of}} serendipity in scientific progress. In 1967, Dr. Blumberg investigated the link between inherited traits and susceptibility to diseases by taking blood samples from native populations all over the world. These blood samples were tested for the presence of different serum proteins using antibodies derived from blood of haemophiliac patients. Dr. Blumberg reasoned that the immune system of these patients must recognize all blood serum proteins {{as a result of the}} blood transfusions they underwent. Using this technique, he discovered a match between an antibody from a haemophiliac patient in New York and a blood serum protein from an Australian aboriginal, which he called <b>Australian</b> <b>antigen.</b> Combination of this finding with research and clinical observations led to the insight that the <b>Australian</b> <b>antigen</b> caused hepatitis or liver inflammation, which in turn led to the {{discovery of}} HBV by the virologist Dr. Dane in 1970. Two years later, a blood test to identify HBV and a vaccine against the virus were invented. In 1976, Dr. Blumberg was rewarded the Nobel Prize in medicine for this discovery...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} six {{mother and}} infant pairs where the mother developed serum hepatitis during pregnancy. These findings are {{compared with those}} in three <b>Australian</b> <b>antigen</b> carrier mothers and their babies. The literature is also reviewed and it is concluded that neonatal hepatitis seldom occurs in infants whose mothers have hepatitis early in pregnancy or are chronic carriers of Australia antigen. In contrast the risk of infection of infants born to mothers who develop serum hepatitis later in pregnancy or in the puerperium approaches 50 %...|$|E
40|$|IN THE PRESENT STUDY WE LOOKED FOR SMOOTH MUSCLE ANTIBODY IN 80 HEALTHY CONTROLPERSONS AND 471 PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM VARIOUS LIVER AND OTHER DISEASES. FROM THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY WE CAME TO THE FOLLOWING CONCLUSIONS: 1) SMOOTH MUSCLE ANTIBODIES WERE FOUND IN 30 PER CENT OF THE WHOLE MATERIAL OF THE STUDY. 2) ANTIBODY TITLES AGAINST SMOOTH MUSCLE FIBRES UP TO 1 : 40 WERE FOUND IN ALL GROUPS OF THE PATIENTS EXAMINED, EXCEPT OF PATIENTS IN THE COLLAGEN DISEASES WHERE THE SMOOTH MUSCLE ANTIBODIES WERE NEGATIVE. 3. ANTIBODY TITLES 1 : 80 OR HIGHER WERE FOUND IN CHRONIC ACTIVE HEPATITIS, CRYPTOGENIC CIRRHOSIS, PRIMARY BILIARY CIRRHOSIS, VARIOUS OTHER HEPATIC DISEASES AND ACUTE VIRUS HEPATITIS. 4. IN CHRONIC ACTIVE HEPATITIS THE SMOOTH MUSCLE ANTIBODIES WERE FOUND IN 83, 3 PER CENT OF THE CASES EXAMINED. THE PERCENTAGE OF HIGH TITLES I. E. MORE THAN 1 : 80 WAS SMALL AND THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CASES WITH POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE <b>AUSTRALIAN</b> <b>ANTIGEN.</b> THE FINAL CONCLUSION FROM OUR STUDY IS THAT SMOOTH MUSCLE ANTIBODIES OFFER LIMITED DIAGNOSTIC HELP IN CHRONIC ACTIVE HEPATITIS AND DO NOT PERMIT THE EASY RECOGNITION OF THE AUTOIMMUNE TYPE OF THIS DISEASE. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{hepatitis}}-associated antigen (HAA) (<b>Australian</b> <b>antigen)</b> is either the infective agent of viral hepatitis or a virus-related protein(l). It {{is present in}} the blood during the incubation period and early clinical course of acute viral hepatitis in adults(l, 2). The presence of the HAA in Krugman's long incubation hepatitis (MS- 2) and its absence in childhood hepatitis, epidemic hepatitis, and in short incubation hepatitis (MS- 1) indicates it is associated with the serum hepatitis virus (s) (2, 3). The antigen persists for longer periods in the blood of some patients with chronic active hepatitis(4, 5) and dialysis-associated hepatitis(6). It is frequently present in the serum of patients with Down's syndrome(7), lepromatous leprosy(8) and certain types of leukemia(7, 9 - 11). We have investigated the frequency of HAA in the sera of patients with a wide spectrum of neoplastic diseases, including primary and metastatic liver neoplasms. Many of the patients studied had received multiple transfusions and were being treated with immunosuppressant drugs. METHO;DS Sera Samples. Sera were obtained from 789 patients with biopsy proven neoplastic diseases in a number of institutions including Memorial Hospital fo...|$|E
40|$|Forty {{years ago}} in 1967, Professor Blumberg {{discovered}} the <b>Australian</b> <b>Antigen,</b> later known as the hepatitis B surface antigen, and was awarded the Nobel Prize. This discovery enables the diagnosis of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and defines its epidemiology. Viral hepatitis B infection affects global health situation, and chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is particularly serious in the Asia-Pacific region. HBV vaccines created the first breakthrough in HBV prevention. Through universal HBV vaccination program for the newborns, promoted since the mid- 1980 s, the main route that perpetuates chronic infection from mother to child is curbed. Most {{children and young adults}} now have immunity against HBV infection. The next breakthrough comes with therapy for CHB. This prevents progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Standard interferon therapy with modest efficacy has been largely replaced by therapy with nuclos(t) ide analogues or pegylated interferons alfa- 2 a and - 2 b. Lamivudine was approved by the FDA USA in 1998, followed by adefovir dipivoxil in 2002, entecavir in 2005, and telbivudine in 2006. Clevudine, tenofovir, and many promising candidates are in different stages of development and clinical trial. This paper critically reviews recent data published or presented since the APASL Consensus and Guideline Update of 2005. Clinical efficacy mostly in patients with raised serum alanine aminotransferase will be analyzed...|$|E
40|$|Tumor markers {{are widely}} used for {{screening}} certain tumors, however, their use in chronic hemodialysis (HD) patients in hemodialysis has been a controversial issue. To determine {{the reliability of the}} tumor markers, CA 15 - 3, CA 19 - 9, CA 125, Alpha-Fetoprotein and Carcinoem-bryonic antigen (CEA), in chronic HD patients, and the impact of active hepatitis C on the variation of tumor markers values, we studied 30 patients (16 men and 14 women) aged from 40 to 78 years old (mean age: 54 &# 177; 5 years), on intermittent hemodialysis (with a mean duration of 10. 5 years), and clinically free from neoplastic disease. The control group included 30 healthy volunteers. All subjects were of Greek origin and residents of the Korinthos region. The tumor markers were measured once in the control group and before and afterwards the hemodialysis, in the study group. Alpha fetopro-tein was within normal limits in all the study patients, CA 125 was slightly increased in one (3. 3 &#x 0025;) patient, CA 15 - 3 levels were twice normal in 4 (13 &#x 0025;) patients, CA 19 - 9 levels were twice normal in 5 (16 &#x 0025;) patients, and CEA levels were twice normal in 4 (13 &#x 0025;) patients. More than half (7 / 13) of anti HCV positive and all <b>Australian</b> <b>antigen</b> positive patients had abnormal serum levels of CA 15 - 3 and CA 125 after hemodialysis treatment. We conclude that measurement of some tumor markers such as alfa-fetoprotein may be beneficial in HD patients. However, the elevated levels of other markers including CA 15 - 3 and CA 125 are not specific for neoplasms and related to active hepatitis C...|$|E
