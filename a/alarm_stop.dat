Accordingly, the watch-keeping engineer acknowledges the order by moving {{the handle of the}} engine room EOT to the required position and takes necessary action. This sends an electrical signal to the Bridge EOT unit, causing its pointer to acquire the respective position.

50|$|Fourteen {{different}} rathnas (gems) {{were recovered}} in this exercise, mostly retained by the Gods after the Demons tried to cheat them. But before Amrita could be recovered, Halāhala ("the most vicious and venomous poison of universe") was produced, which started killing both sides. As {{no one could}} bear the poisonous fumes emitted by the poison, both Devas and Asuras began to collapse due to asphyxiation. They ran for help to Brahma, who directed them to Vishnu who advised them only Shiva could help them. So both parties went to Kailasha and prayed to Lord Shiva for help. Shiva chose to consume the poison and thus drank it. His wife Parvati, <b>alarmed,</b> <b>stopped</b> it in his throat with her hands, thus earning him the name Viṣakaṇṭha (the one who held poison in his throat). He was later saved by the mahavidya (tara) {{who is also a}} form of parvati. The poison made his throat turn blue; hence, he is also known as Nīlakaṇṭha (the one with a blue throat).|$|R

Jason is arrested, Midget gets away, & P-Nut tries {{to drive away}} from cops with the SUV in reverse. The police kill P-Nut, later describing the killing as self-defense by claiming that P-Nut tried to overrun a cop. Officer Roscoe arrives and advises Jason that he was caught on video tape committing the crime (alluding to the car theft at the store with Midget). The neighborhood residents are later seen outraged, protesting the cops for killing a teen, as the emergency medics try to revive him. The scene returns to the present, with Jason doing time at a juvenile hall. There, he gets into an argument with an inmate who has a vendetta against Midget. As Jason is sitting watching news, it is revealed that the cops involved in the shootings of Ron Q and P-Nut have been suspended from active duty, with Officer Roscoe being brought up on criminal charges.|$|R
40|$|Presently {{project is}} carried out {{detection}} of images using the mathematical program MATLAB.

By means of comparison for correlation and for position it is proven if an object has remained in the same place or it has moved. If the vehicle has moved it is possible to obtain the approximate speed to which moved. On the other hand if the vehicle remains during four seconds in the same place an alarm it is sent and the signaling of the rail is changed where that vehicle is, indicating that there has been a jam.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} severe alarms on home-documented monitoring {{in infants}} born prematurely. METHODS: In infants born at a post-menstrual age (PMA) less than 35 weeks, a polysomnography was performed before discharge. A heart rate less than 50 {{beats per minute}} (bpm) for more than 3 seconds or an apnea lasting for more than 15 seconds with a heart rate less than 60 bpm were defined as abnormal. These babies were given cardiorespiratory home monitoring with memory. Serious alarms on the home monitor were defined as heart rate less than 50 bpm for more than 3 seconds. RESULTS: Of 1058 infants, 96 infants needed cardiorespiratory home monitoring. Sixty-one infants showed alarms at home. The mean post-conceptional age (PCA) when <b>alarms</b> <b>stopped</b> was 46 weeks. Seventeen patients had serious alarms above the PCA of 50 weeks. There was a significant negative correlation (r = - 0. 46 and p = 0. 0002 by Spearman's rank correlation) between the PMA at birth and the PCA at which the last alarm was noted CONCLUSION: Prematurely born infants with an abnormal polysomnography at discharge {{are at high risk}} for developing acute events at home. A younger PMA at birth correlates with a higher risk of alarms at a later PCA. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Prediction of {{pump station}} alarms {{based on data}} is an {{interesting}} future service for companies as {{it allows them to}} both offer a new service and reduce the downtime of the pumps. In order to predict the alarms a study of the available data was done in order to examine feasibility and identify problems. The chosen solution was to use two neural networks which were connected in a chain to create a complete solution. The first neural network used long short term memory (LSTM) neurons in order to recursively predict time-series data from sensors, such as sump water level and pump electric current, this was then used by the second LSTM neural network in order to determine if these parameter values would trigger an alarm. The second LSTM network was unable to determine if an alarm would happen and thus the whole solution did not work. There were two main reasons for this, the first being that the <b>alarms</b> <b>stop</b> time did not correlate to the time-series sensor data which created an uncertainty of which parameter levels actually belonged to an alarm, making the LSTM network unable to identify what an alarm is. The second reason was that the data was downsampled too much making it even harder for the LSTM network to identify what an alarm was. This thesis has helped Xylem further understand the use and needs of machine learning, which will help Xylem progress further into the area of predictive and smart services...|$|R
50|$|At 10:55, {{the tunnel}} {{employees}} triggered the fire <b>alarm</b> and <b>stopped</b> any further traffic from entering. At this point {{there were at}} least 10 cars/vans and 18 trucks in the tunnel that had entered from the French side. A few vehicles from the Italian side passed the Volvo truck without stopping. Some of the cars from the French side managed to turn around in the narrow two-lane tunnel to retreat back to France, but negotiating the road in the dense smoke that had rapidly filled the tunnel quickly made this impossible. The larger trucks did not have the space to turn around, and reversing out was not an option.|$|R

At first there were but three entrances; but after I had surprised them a few times, two more were added; whether to get out more quickly when all were inside, or simply for the sake of drilling the holes, I do not know.

The master module controls the whole system with an ARM IC. The system can judge whether the temperature of bearing has exceed the limited value or the temperature is rising too fast, and send <b>alarm</b> signal to <b>stop</b> the press in those cases.
