5|$|The Delichon martins were {{originally}} cliff nesters, breeding in colonies situated under an overhang on a vertical cliff. However, the house martin now largely uses human structures, as, {{to a lesser}} extent, does the Asian house martin. The typical nest is <b>a</b> <b>grass</b> or feather-lined deep closed mud bowl with a small opening at the top, but many Asian house martins leave {{the top of the}} nest open.|$|E
5|$|The freeway was {{separated}} by <b>a</b> <b>grass</b> median with a steel beam {{acting as a}} barrier between the lanes.

5|$|Track {{and field}} is a sport which {{includes}} athletic contests established on {{the skills of}} running, jumping, and throwing. The name {{is derived from the}} sport's typical venue: a stadium with an oval running track enclosing <b>a</b> <b>grass</b> field where the throwing and jumping events take place. Track and field is categorised under the umbrella sport of athletics, which also includes road running, cross country running, and race walking.|$|E
5|$|Afterward, the {{airfield}} {{was used by}} charter flights carrying foreign tourists and by flights transporting dignitaries to the city, such as Jawaharlal Nehru. The Indian Air Force operated training flights at the airport as well. In 1985, regional airline Vayudoot commenced thrice weekly flights from Bangalore using its Dornier Do 228 aircraft. The service was inaugurated by famous Indian writer R. K. Narayan. At the time, Mysore Airport consisted solely of <b>a</b> <b>grass</b> airstrip and a one-roomed terminal with one toilet. Because of low passenger loads, the flights ended in 1990.|$|E
5|$|For several months, Bachelot and {{his fellow}} missionaries lived in three small rented structures, saying their first mass on the island in <b>a</b> <b>grass</b> hut. They later built a chapel on a small plot of land they purchased, where the Cathedral of Our Lady of Peace was {{dedicated}} in 1843. After settling on the island, the group avoided drawing attention to themselves and studied the Hawaiian language. During their mission's first two years, the group converted 65 Hawaiians and ministered to Hawaiians who had already been converted. They often held surreptitious night-time meetings with converts who feared persecution. The priests' vestments and rituals made their evangelism efforts more effective because they reminded Hawaiians of native religious customs.|$|E

5|$|Guinea pigs {{benefit from}} feeding on fresh grass hay, such as timothy hay, in {{addition}} to food pellets which are often based from timothy. Alfalfa is also a popular food choice; most guinea pigs will eat large amounts of alfalfa when offered it, though some controversy exists over the feeding of alfalfa to adult guinea pigs. Some pet owners and veterinary organizations have advised that, as a legume rather than <b>a</b> <b>grass</b> hay, alfalfa consumed in large amounts may lead to obesity, as well as bladder stones due to excess calcium, in any but pregnant and very young guinea pigs. However, published scientific sources mention alfalfa {{as a source for}} replenishment of protein, amino acids, and fiber.|$|E
5|$|Interest in Banak {{rose with}} the Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948 {{and fears of}} Soviet {{intervention}} in Norway. Finnmark, located on the Norway–Soviet Union border, became of particular interest for the military. Although specific plans were articulated, no construction of an airbase was carried out. However, Norway's entry into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1949 had a dramatic effect on the military strategy and Banak. Finnmark {{was regarded as a}} tripwire and was to be sacrificed in case of a Soviet invasion. The airfield was closed in 1952, but the runway remained, consisting of a short section of unmaintained wooden runway and the rest <b>a</b> <b>grass</b> strip. It was occasionally used by small aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The cottage {{garden in}} France is a {{development}} of the early 20th century. Monet's garden at Giverny is a prominent example, a sprawling garden full of varied plantings, rich colors, and water gardens. In modern times, the term 'cottage garden' is used to describe any number of informal garden styles, using design and plants very different from their traditional English cottage garden origins. Examples include regional variations using <b>a</b> <b>grass</b> prairie scheme (in the American midwest) and California chaparral cottage gardens.|$|E

5|$|A Free Ride, {{also known}} as <b>A</b> <b>Grass</b> Sandwich, is a stag film of the silent era that is {{considered}} to be the earliest extant American hardcore pornographic movie. It depicts a motorist who picks up two women from the roadside and later engages in several sex acts with them. Although most scholars consider A Free Ride a 1915 film, some sources claim that it was produced later. The film's director used a pseudonym and the cast remained anonymous. The filming location is not known, although it may have been produced in New Jersey. Two contradictory theories have emerged regarding the identities of the cast: some sources suggest they were people with low social status, but others assert the opposite. The Kinsey Institute has a print of the film in its collection. A Free Ride was screened at the inauguration of the Museum of Sex. In 2004, Lisa Oppenheim, a New York-based artist, remade the film.|$|E
5|$|Also at {{dawn the}} first {{attack by the}} Fallschirmjäger Machine Gun Battalion to the south began, when they opened fire with their machine guns and mortars. Their first assault was against the 2nd Parachute Battalion's positions, and was unsuccessful. However, their next assault, later in the morning, succeeded in {{capturing}} Johnny II, {{the second of the}} small hills. Lieutenant Colonel John Frost, in command of the 2nd Parachute Battalion, immediately counterattacked, but his men were repulsed after sustaining a number of casualties. At 09:00 a forward observation officer attached to the 2nd Parachute Battalion managed to make radio contact with the British cruiser HMS Newfoundland, which then used its 6-inch guns to target the Fallschirmjäger positions. The naval gunfire had the desired effect, causing the Germans some casualties and keeping them under cover. From then on, German resistance from the south was restricted to harassing machine gun fire. <b>A</b> <b>grass</b> fire they started did force the 2nd Parachute Battalion to abandon Johnny I, and the remnants of the battalion now concentrated on Johnny III.|$|E
5|$|Astronomy {{classes at}} the University of Illinois date to its {{earliest}} days. The first courses focused on measurement {{of the night sky}} and was taken by civil engineering students to sharpen their surveying skills. A small observatory consisting of a 4-inch refractor and a small transit telescope was constructed by 1872. The astronomy courses were typically taught by the mathematics department and by the early 1890s, several mathematics instructors wanted to do more with astronomy. An expanded astronomy curriculum would require a new larger facility. The Illinois state legislature voted in 1895 to fund a new teaching observatory at the University of Illinois, providing $15,000 for construction. The site chosen was <b>a</b> <b>grass</b> knoll between Matthews Avenue and Burrill Avenue, just north of the Morrow Plots, a National Historic Landmark that is the nation's oldest experimental field. Contracts were extended to Charles A. Gunn, the architect and an instructor on campus, and Bevis and Company in Urbana as the general contractor with construction beginning in April 1896. The building was completed by August at a total cost of $6,800. The principle telescope was installed in November and the final telescope was in place by February 1897.|$|E

5|$|Northwest of Holland, {{the highway}} runs as a four-lane {{expressway}} and divided highway parallel, but inland from, the Lake Michigan shoreline. This section of US31 runs through {{a mix of}} farm fields and forests as it runs to the community of Agnew. There, US31 intersects {{the western end of}} M-45 (Lake Michigan Drive) before continuing into the southern end of Grand Haven. In that city, the highway follows a four-lane boulevard with <b>a</b> <b>grass</b> median. On the northern edge of the city of Grand Haven, US31 crosses the Grand River on a bascule bridge that opens about 450–500times per year. North of the structure, US31 transitions into a freeway at the interchange with the western end of M-104 in Ferrysburg. This freeway continues northward through the suburban edges of the Muskegon area and meets the western end of I-96 near the Muskegon County Airport in Norton Shores.|$|E
5|$|On 30 January 1953, Braathens SAFE {{applied to}} start a route from Oslo to Trondheim Airport, Lade. A trial permit was granted, and the first flight was made on 18 August. Because Lade had <b>a</b> <b>grass</b> runway, Trondheim Airport, Værnes was used during bad weather. SAS flew a morning flight from Oslo, while Braathens flew the morning route from Trondheim. In 1953, Braathens SAFE stated that to keep their 210 {{employees}} and fleet of one DC-4, one DC-3 and two Herons, {{they would have to}} receive future domestic services, to compensate for more than 90% of their revenue disappearing with the loss of the Far East route. In 1953, Braathens SAFE applied to fly five routes: Bardufoss – Alta – Kirkenes; Stavanger – Bergen – Trondheim (both with Herons); Tromsø – Alta – Hammerfest; Bodø – Harstad; and Bodø – Harstad – Tromsø (all with de Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otters). The five routes would require NOK725,000 in annual subsidies. The concessions were granted to DNL, who allowed their partially owned subsidiary Widerøe to fly the sea routes.|$|E
5|$|Presumably a {{few days}} later, Katy has since made friends with a monkey and uses her {{stiletto}} heel to form a spear. She uses it to shoot a banana, which she gives to the monkey. In another scene, she bathes in the lake, {{with the help of}} an elephant who sprays her with water from the lake using its trunk. Katy helps a crocodile by brushing its teeth using a toothbrush she has salvaged, and tries to reach her clothes which have been taken by the elephant. At night, she holds a torch and explores a cave. Inside, she watches an animated drawing on the wall in which humans try to kill a tiger with fire; attempting to burn it as it grows stronger and shooting spears which it sends firing back towards them with its roar. The next morning, Katy emerges from the cave, wearing a leopard-print bikini top, <b>a</b> <b>grass</b> skirt, laced up legs and bare feet, displaying a boost of confidence and holding the spear she made earlier. She stands on top of a waterfall, overlooking the jungle, and then swings across the sky on a vine.|$|E

5|$|The city {{is home to}} venues and {{organizations}} promoting the arts. Founded in 1958, the Allied Arts Council of Lethbridge is the largest organization in the city dedicated to preserving and enhancing the local arts. In the spring of 2007, the Allied Arts Council Facilities Steering Committee initiated the Arts Re:Building Together Campaign, <b>a</b> <b>grass</b> roots campaign initiative to raise awareness and support for improving arts facilities in Lethbridge. The campaign identified three arts buildings: the Yates Memorial Centre, the Bowman Arts Centre, and the Southern Alberta Art Gallery as cornerstone facilities in the community requiring care and attention. On July14, 2007, the Finance Committee of City Council approved four arts capital projects {{for inclusion in the}} City’s Ten Year Capital Plan. Under the campaign to 2010, the renovation and expansion of the Southern Alberta Art Gallery was completed, a new Community Arts Centre will be built in downtown Lethbridge, the City of Lethbridge has a Public Art Program, and a committee was formed to research the possibility of a new Performing Arts Centre in Lethbridge.|$|E
