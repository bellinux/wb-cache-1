5|$|In {{developed}} counties, {{training programs}} specifically {{relating to the}} international practice of emergency medicine are now available within many emergency medicine residencies. The curriculum that should be covered by such programs {{has been the subject}} of much discussion. Patient care, medical knowledge, practice-based learning, communication skills, professionalism, and system-based practice <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> six competencies required of programs approved by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, but the application of these goals can take many forms.|$|E
5|$|The {{more typical}} soldier types of the Gorn are the Initiates, Warriors and Guardians. The former <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> {{troops of the}} Gorn forces, and while they can run on four legs, they fight on two with an {{automatic}} rifle called the Ravager. The Warriors are more advanced, and carry a variety of weaponry along with basic armor. The Guardian type differs {{in that it is}} a melee type, armed with a large energy axe. However, the energy from the axe can also produce a shield to protect the holder as well. They are more advanced than both the Initiate and the Warrior classes in that they spend the vast majority of their time on two feet only. Of these fifteen classes, three were created to appear female.|$|E

25|$|The neuron {{doctrine}} is the now fundamental idea that neurons <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> structural and functional {{units of the}} nervous system. The theory was put forward by Santiago Ramón y Cajal in the late 19th century. It held that neurons are discrete cells (not connected in a meshwork), acting as metabolically distinct units.|$|E
25|$|Mathematically, Bass–Serre theory {{builds on}} {{exploiting}} and generalizing {{the properties of}} two older group-theoretic constructions: free product with amalgamation and HNN extension. However, unlike the traditional algebraic study of these two constructions, Bass–Serre theory uses the geometric language of covering theory and fundamental groups. Graphs of groups, which <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> objects of Bass–Serre theory, {{can be viewed as}} one-dimensional versions of orbifolds.|$|E

25|$|Pudgala or Matter - Matter is solid, liquid, gas, energy, fine karmic {{materials}} and extra-fine matter or ultimate particles. Paramānu or ultimate particles <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> building block of matter. One quality of paramānu and pudgala is permanence and indestructibility. It combines and changes its modes but its qualities remain the same. According to Jainism, it cannot be created nor destroyed.|$|E
25|$|The use {{of credit}} {{information}} {{in connection with}} applying for various types of insurance or in landlord background checks has drawn similar amounts of scrutiny and criticism. This is because the activities of finding secure employment, renting suitable accommodation and securing insurance <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> functions of meaningful participation in modern society, {{and in the case}} of some types of auto insurance for instance, are mandated by law.|$|E
25|$|Cells <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> unit of {{structure}} in every living thing, and all cells arise from pre-existing cells by division. Cell theory was formulated by Henri Dutrochet, Theodor Schwann, Rudolf Virchow and others {{during the early}} nineteenth century, and subsequently became widely accepted. The activity of an organism depends on the total activity of its cells, with energy flow occurring within and between them. Cells contain hereditary information that is carried forward as a genetic code during cell division.|$|E

25|$|Coronal loops <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> {{structures}} of the magnetic solar corona. These loops are the closed-magnetic flux cousins of the open-magnetic flux {{that can be found}} in coronal hole (polar) regions and the solar wind. Loops of magnetic flux well-up from the solar body and fill with hot solar plasma. Due to the heightened magnetic activity in these coronal loop regions, coronal loops can often be the precursor to solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs).|$|E
25|$|The {{theory that}} proton–proton {{reactions}} <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> principle {{by which the}} Sun and other stars burn was advocated by Arthur Eddington in the 1920s. At the time, {{the temperature of the}} Sun was considered to be too low to overcome the Coulomb barrier. After the development of quantum mechanics, it was discovered that tunneling of the wavefunctions of the protons through the repulsive barrier allows for fusion at a lower temperature than the classical prediction.|$|E
25|$|As {{described}} above, many jurisdictions {{have different}} levels of paramedic training, leading to variations in what procedures different paramedics may perform depending upon their qualifications. Three common general divisions of paramedic training <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> technician, general paramedic or advanced technician, and advanced paramedic. Common skills that these three certification levels may practice are summarized in the table below. The skills for the higher levels automatically also assume those listed for lower levels.|$|E
