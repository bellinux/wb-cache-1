40|$|The Noir de Bigorre (NB) pork chain {{relying on}} pure Gascon <b>autochtonous</b> <b>breed</b> {{obtained}} in 2015 the FrenchAOC label required for further European Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) registration, for both fresh meat and dry-cured hams. Pigs produced in extensive conditions (pasture, 20 pigs/ha) consume {{large quantities of}} grass and, depending on the season, acorns and chestnuts {{in addition to a}} conventional diet. Variations in feed resources and climatic conditions along the fattening period can modulate animal growth, muscle and fat tissue traits and the intrinsic properties of pork products. Within the European H 2020 TREASURE project, we aimed at better characterizing the variability of various phenotypic traits of pork and processed products from NB chain according to the pig finishing season. Gascon castrated male pigs were produced in compliance with PDO specifications in two farms of the NB chain with similar husbandry practices and slaughtered at the end of winter (W, n= 25) or spring (S, n= 23). Season influenced carcass and meat traits. At similar slaughter weight and age (166. 5 kg and 414 d on average), S pigs exhibited slightly lower carcass fatness (P< 0. 10) but higher lipid content in the Gluteus (ham) muscle (3. 44 vs 2. 79 %, P< 0. 001) than S pigs. In loin and ham muscles, S pigs showed higher ultimate pH (+ 0. 06 to 0. 15 units, P< 0. 01) and lower meat lightness (P< 0. 05) and hue angle (P< 0. 10), indicating redder meat, than W pigs. Season associated to feed resources affected tissue lipid profile with higher (P< 0. 05) n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid content and lower (P< 0. 001) n 6 -/n- 3 ratio in Gluteus muscle and external fat of green hams from S pigs, underlying the positive effect of pig grass consumption during spring on the nutritional value of pork. Present and future results on quality of fresh pork and dry-cured hams from pigs slaughtered at the end of autumn following acorns consumption will be useful for actors of the local NB chain to adapt pig husbandry practices, in order tofurther improve the eating quality and differentiation of pork products within PDO specifications...|$|E
40|$|According to {{literature}} data, the IGF 2 (Insulin-like Growth Factor 2) gene {{plays a role}} in regulating proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis of cells in many different tissues. Furthermore, polymorphisms located in intron 3 of this gene have been associated with meat quality traits such as intramuscular fat content, marbling and backfat thickness. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze the genetic structure of two known IGF 2 SNPs (- 225 C>G and - 182 T>C), located in the promoter region P 2 of IGF 2 gene, in the Nero Lucano pig and their effects on quality and colourimetric characteristics of meat. Till 10 years ago, the Nero Lucano pig was a breed in danger of extinction. Today, thanks to Basilicata Regional Institutions, such as ARA, Alsia, Comunità Montana del Medio Basento, and University of Basilicata, the Nero Lucano pig population shows an increasing consistency. We typed 153 pigs at IGF 2 SNPs - 225 C>G and - 182 T>C by means of RFLP-PCR analyses using Eco 0109 I and DraIII restriction enzymes, respectively. The frequencies of - 225 C and G alleles are identical to those of - 182 T and C alleles, that is 0. 13 and 0. 87, respectively. According to the genotype distribution it appears that only two haplotypes are present in this population: - 225 G - 182 C, and - 225 C - 182 T. For each individual, the meat from two representative muscles (Longissimus dorsi, and Psoas) was collected. Colourimetric characteristics (CIELab lightness, L*; redness, a*; yellowness, b*; CIE, 1976), dry matter, total protein, fat content, ash (ASPA, 1996) Fe heme (Hornsey 1956), oxymyoglobin (MbO 2), deoxymyoglobin (deoxyMb), and metamyoglobin (metMb) content (Krzywicki 1979) where evaluated. Analysis of variance was performed on all the variables measured using the GLM procedure (SAS, 1996). The results of this study show that in Nero Lucano pig these two IGF 2 haplotypes are associated with significantly different effects on chemical composition and colourimetric characteristics of meat. In particular, meat from pigs homozygous for the - 225 G - 182 C haplotype show higher values of fat, Fe heme, metMb, and lower values of protein, deoxyMb, MbO 2, L* and b* parameters (P< 0. 05). No differences between the two haplotypes were observed for dry matter, ash and a* parameter. According to these results, the polymorphism at the IGF 2 locus can be used for selection purposes in this <b>autochtonous</b> <b>breed...</b>|$|E
40|$|The main {{varieties}} of livestock in Croatia {{are represented by}} {{a very small number}} of breeds and strains. So far the work on improvement has neglected the biological variety as a basis for successful and satisfactory national cattle production for a longer period of time. In Croatia about twelve <b>autochtonous</b> <b>breeds</b> and strains are seriously endangered. Since 1984 there have been attempts at organising their systematic protection. But a full national programme of protection and utilisation of valuable autochtonous animals does not exist. Regional programmes and individual activities show certain successes. Scientific background to the national protection programme is the project "Genetic Polymorphisms and Gene Collections of Domestic Animal Breeds in Croatia" (1990) and the published papers from this field in the last ten years...|$|R
40|$|The {{central issue}} in process of {{organizing}} organic cattle breeding is the knowledge about specificities {{of this kind}} of production, good knowledge of breed characteristics (body composition, immune tolerance, expressed predisposition towards some diseases, production properties). Research centres, in collaboration with producers, have defined the essential features on which the selection programmes in organic cattle breeding are based on. Of the greatest importance for veterinary service is the fact that selection programmes in organic cattle breeding are in the first place based on giving priority to healthy animals, with strong immune system, good reproductive characteristics, which can be in production system for a long period. Additional important selective criteria is specific body resistance and adaptability of <b>autochtonous</b> <b>breeds</b> to environmental conditions.

40|$|Black Slavonian pig is an <b>autochtonous</b> Croatian <b>breed</b> {{originated}} by {{crossing of}} the breeds Mangulica, Berkshire and Poland Chine {{at the end of}} 19 th and beginning of 20 th century. It belongs to the group of fat-meaty breeds. Due to a small number of the animals (153 sows, 45 gilts and 15 boars – Report HSSP, 2000) it is subjected to extinction danger. The investigation was conducted with 60 sows, inseminated by the total of ten boars at a family farm in eastern Slavonia. Black Slavonian sows farrowed 7. 10 piglets per litter of which 6. 31 were alive. They reared 5. 71 piglets, aged two months, in a litter. Significant variability of the reproductive traits and their statistically important phenotypic correlation (r) were determined in the analysed sows...|$|R
40|$|The Krškopolje or blackbelted pig is {{the only}} Slovene <b>autochtonous</b> pig <b>breed.</b> Under {{extensive}} management, it shows good adaptability to poor breeding and feeding conditions. It has an excellent meat quality. In the last twenty years, the Krškopolje pig has been neglected, {{and there has been}} no systematic breeding. Although some efforts were made in beginning of the seventies to preserve this breed, progress was limited due to inadequate funds. The decline of this breed started before World War II. In a report on an agricultural survey held in 1938, Oblak (1938) reported on pig breeding as follows: " [...] . Today the primitive Krškopolje pig is not found as a pure breed. However, there are small populations of this primitive breed in remote parts of the country, which are distinguihable by their appearance, colour and other traits. The Krškopolje pig has the ability to produce fat as well as meat of excellent quality [...] . In general, the Krškopolje pig is mainly intended for home use and not for sale. It is very fast-growing and also produces a high quantity of fat. ...|$|R
40|$|Native {{mountain}} {{horse is}} an autochthonous ungulata with a domicile extending {{to the whole}} mountaneous region of Serbia, south of the Sava and Danube rivers. Along with native horses of other Balkan countries it is classified as Mediterranean pony, but unlike Balkan horses such as Skiros, Pinea, Pindos, Karakachan, Bosnian mountineous horse etc., mountineous horses in Serbia neither have been morphologically described nor were of concern to the scientific community {{till the end of}} the twentieth century. Investigations of albumin polymorphism in blood serum of native mountain horse were taken within a comprehensive reserch on morphologic, physiologic and genetic structure of this <b>autochtonous</b> ungulata <b>breed.</b> On the basis of the results obtained by electrophoretic separation of albumine types in native mountaneous horse blood serum, there were determined four albumine phenotypes: AA, AB, BB and BI which are inherited by three autosomal alleles AlA, Alb, All. The appearance of All allele in native mountaneous horse population points out to diluvial forest horse impact on process of microevolution of autochtonous native mountaneous horse. Occidental- specific albumin isoforms presence indicate the necessity of thorough study of evolution position and historic influence of different ancestors, and especially occidental horses on native mountain horse population in Serbia...|$|R
