5|$|Hurricane Ethel {{originated}} {{from a small}} tropical disturbance over the Gulf of Mexico {{on the morning of}} September14, 1960. It is estimated that Ethel developed into a tropical storm at 1200UTC on that day, with an initial intensity of 45mph (75km/h). The disturbance quickly developed within a region favoring intensification and the New Orleans Hurricane Warning Office issued their first advisory on the system, classifying it <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> of low pressure, at 1500UTC. Roughly six hours after becoming a tropical storm, Ethel was upgraded to a hurricane as it underwent an intense phase of explosive deepening. By this time, gale-force winds extended 150miles (240km) {{to the north of the}} center and 80miles (130km) to the south. Ethel further intensified into a major hurricane, as it approached the Gulf Coast of the United States.|$|E

At the Yankees' request, Jeter embarked on a rigorous training program to combat the effects of age, by focusing on lateral movement and first-step quickness.

5|$|Like all creeks in Lycoming County, Larrys Creek served <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> for {{settlers}} {{to establish}} homesteads and farms. As logging {{became a major}} industry in the mid-19th century, the creek {{was a source of}} power for sawmills and other mills. The first sawmill on the creek, in what is now Mifflin Township, was built in 1799. The relatively low flow of water in the creek did not allow rafts of logs to be floated downstream to the river and the lumber boom at Williamsport (as they were on Pine Creek to the west).|$|E

5|$|Missionary and {{explorer}} David Livingstone reached Lake Malawi (then Lake Nyasa) in 1859 {{and identified}} the Shire Highlands {{south of the}} lake <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> suitable for European settlement. As the result of Livingstone's visit, several Anglican and Presbyterian missions were established {{in the area in}} the 1860s and 1870s, the African Lakes Company Limited was established in 1878 to set up a trade and transport concern working closely with the missions, and a small mission and trading settlement was established at Blantyre in 1876 and a British Consul took up residence there in 1883. The Portuguese government was also interested in the area so, to prevent Portuguese occupation, the British government sent Harry Johnston as British consul with instructions to make treaties with local rulers beyond Portuguese jurisdiction.|$|E
5|$|North Parade Bridge {{was built}} almost 100 {{years later in}} 1836 by William Tierney Clark. His {{original}} bridge was made of cast iron on stone abutments, with lodges and staircases.

The area which Wood envisaged <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> of sunken gardens matching the houses is now a car park.|$|E
5|$|The Blackdown Hills have, since 1991, been {{designated}} <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>Area</b> of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). As {{they have the}} same landscape quality, AONBs may be compared to the national parks of England and Wales. AONBs are created under the same legislation as the national parks: the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. However, National Parks, unlike AONBs, have their own authorities and have special legal powers to prevent unsympathetic development. By contrast, there are very limited statutory duties imposed on local authorities within an AONB. Further regulation and protection of AONBs was added by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000.|$|E
