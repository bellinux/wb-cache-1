The end affects by introducing speed dependent scale factor to the magnetizing inductance and series resistance in the d-axis equivalent circuit. Simulation results are presented to show the validity of the model during both no-load and sudden load change intervals.

50|$|However conversely, <b>linear</b> <b>induction</b> <b>motors</b> {{can avoid}} the need for {{gearboxes}} and similar drivetrains, and these have their own losses; and working knowledge {{of the importance of}} the goodness factor can minimise the effects of the larger air gap.

For example, in many cases <b>linear</b> <b>induction</b> <b>motors</b> have far fewer moving parts, and have very low maintenance. Also, using <b>linear</b> <b>induction</b> <b>motors</b> instead of rotating motors with rotary-to-linear transmissions in motion control systems, enables higher bandwidth and accuracy of the control system, because rotary-to-linear transmissions introduce backlash, static friction and/or mechanical compliance in the control system.|$|R

This paper explores the benefits of a smaller system that adds the advantages of a high specific impulse air-breathing stage and supersonic launch speeds. The method of virtual specific impulse is introduced as a tool to emphasize the gains afforded by launch assist. Analysis shows launch assist can provide a 278 -s virtual specific impulse for a first-stage solid rocket. Additional trajectory analysis demonstrates that a system composed of a launch-assisted first-stage ramjet plus a bipropellant second stage can provide a 48 -percent gross lift-off weight reduction versus an all-rocket system.
