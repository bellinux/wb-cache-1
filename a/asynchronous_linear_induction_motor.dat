Characteristically, <b>linear</b> <b>induction</b> <b>motors</b> have a finite primary or secondary length, which generates end-effects, whereas a conventional <b>induction</b> <b>motor</b> is arranged in an endless loop.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} the dynamic {{behavior}} of <b>linear</b> <b>induction</b> <b>motor</b> {{is described by}} a mathematical model {{taking into account the}} end effects and the core losses. The need for such a model rises due to the complexity of <b>linear</b> <b>induction</b> <b>motors</b> electromagnetic field theory. The end affects by introducing speed dependent scale factor to the magnetizing inductance and series resistance in the d-axis equivalent circuit. Simulation results are presented to show the validity of the model during both no-load and sudden load change intervals.

50|$|However conversely, <b>linear</b> <b>induction</b> <b>motors</b> {{can avoid}} the need for {{gearboxes}} and similar drivetrains, and these have their own losses; and working knowledge {{of the importance of}} the goodness factor can minimise the effects of the larger air gap.

For example, in many cases <b>linear</b> <b>induction</b> <b>motors</b> have far fewer moving parts, and have very low maintenance. Also, using <b>linear</b> <b>induction</b> <b>motors</b> instead of rotating motors with rotary-to-linear transmissions in motion control systems, enables higher bandwidth and accuracy of the control system, because rotary-to-linear transmissions introduce backlash, static friction and/or mechanical compliance in the control system.|$|R

This paper explores the benefits of a smaller system that adds the advantages of a high specific impulse air-breathing stage and supersonic launch speeds. The method of virtual specific impulse is introduced as a tool to emphasize the gains afforded by launch assist. Analysis shows launch assist can provide a 278 -s virtual specific impulse for a first-stage solid rocket. Additional trajectory analysis demonstrates that a system composed of a launch-assisted first-stage ramjet plus a bipropellant second stage can provide a 48 -percent gross lift-off weight reduction versus an all-rocket system.

The SLIM design and performance equations and design procedures are developed and its performance is predicted using equivalent circuit models. End effects and edge effects are neglected in this study. Optimum design parameters are obtained by the iterative procedure of the design algorithm by choosing various design parameters. The performance of the SLIM for different values of thrust, rotor acceleration, rotor thickness and slip values is analyzed.
