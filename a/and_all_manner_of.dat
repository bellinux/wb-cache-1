They would also restore the elderly to youth and would usher in a utopian era of prosperity. However, she declared that the dead ancestors would only enact this on condition that the Xhosa first destroyed all their means of subsistence.

25|$|The {{state and}} its {{officials}} still dominated the economy, controlled supplies of essential goods, taxed and regulated businesses and markets, and awarded contracts. The stratification system of the Maoist period had been based on a hierarchy of functionally unspecialized cadres directing the labors of a fairly uniform mass of peasants. It was replaced in the 1980s by a new elite of economically specialized households and entrepreneurs who had managed {{to come to terms}} with the administrative cadres who controlled access to many of the resources necessary for economic success. Local cadres still had the power to impose fees, taxes, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>manner</b> <b>of</b> exactions. The norms of the new system were not clear, and the economic and social system continued to change in response to the rapid growth of rural commerce and industry and to national economic policies and reforms.|$|E

Leto explained, [...] "I think this city is a beautiful place at night, and we have these empty streets, and it's kind of a haunting, forgotten landscape... very serene." [...] The crew recruited scores of extras <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>manner</b> <b>of</b> surrealist street performers to appear in the video. On October 11, 2009, Thirty Seconds to Mars shut down Santa Monica Pier and filmed a segment of the short film along with a group of cyclists. Leto got the inspiration behind the video after some of his friends did Critical Mass and Crank Mob, [...] "groups of riders that get together and kind of reclaim public spaces and take over the streets in several cities around America," [...] and he thought that it would be the perfect backdrop for the music video of [...] "Kings and Queens".|$|E

The parent album, Born was released in March and was produced by Farnan and Neil Wiles, and engineered by Kalju Tonuma. It was issued in a double CD package with space reserved for a second disc, Born Again, which was due to be released in April. McFarlane declared the album was a [...] "tougher affair which found the band embracing hi-tech pop, techno-metal <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>manner</b> <b>of</b> sound effects and cyberpunk studio trickery". Although [...] "Gimme" [...] had received generous radio airplay and the album had reached the top40, BMG scrapped the release of the second part, Born Again.|$|E
2500|$|The {{prevailing}} {{models on}} grammaticality since Chomsky (1965) postulate that {{the acceptability of}} sentences is a scale, with clearly acceptable on one side, clearly unacceptable on the other, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>manner</b> <b>of</b> ranges of partial acceptability in between. However, {{in spite of this}} linguists since Chomsky have tended to assume that grammaticality is categorical, or , and that a sentence either is or is not grammatical, with no partial grammaticality in between. To explain the scale of partial acceptability, these linguists have said that phenomena other than grammatical knowledge—such as plausibility, working memory limitations, etc.—account for speakers reporting acceptability on a scale. However, there are a few exceptions to this trend, including those who claim that [...] "strength of violation" [...] plays a role in grammaticality judgements. Examples of linguists of this persuasion include Huang's (1982) proposal that ECP violations are stronger than Subjacency violations, Chomsky's (1986) proposal that each barrier crossed leads to lower acceptability, and Optimality Theory (esp. Keller 2000, 2003).|$|E

Orange Moll hired Nell and her older sister Rose as scantily clad [...] "orange-girls", selling the small, sweet [...] "china" [...] oranges to the {{audience}} inside the theatre for a sixpence each. The work exposed her to multiple aspects of theatre life and to London's higher society: this was after all [...] "the King's playhouse", and Charles frequently attended performances. The orange-girls would also serve as messengers between the men in the audience and the actresses backstage; they received monetary tips for this role and certainly some of these messages would end in sexual assignations. Whether this activity rose to the level of pimping may be a matter of semantics.|$|E
2500|$|Entering Eä at the {{beginning}} of time, the Valar and Maiar tried to build and organize the world according to the will of Eru. Each Maia was associated with one of the powerful Valar whom they served; for example, Sauron was prominent among the Maiar who served Aulë the Smith, the great craftsman of the Valar. [...] As a result, Sauron came to possess great knowledge of the physical substances of the world, forging, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>manner</b> <b>of</b> craftsmanship—emerging as [...] "a great craftsman of the household of Aulë". Sauron would always retain the [...] "scientific" [...] knowledge he derived from the great Vala of Craft: [...] "In his beginning he was of the Maiar of Aulë, and he remained mighty in the lore of that people." [...] Sauron's original Elvish name in Valinor was Mairon (Quenya for [...] "the Admirable"), but this name was not used anymore after he joined Melkor.

2500|$|At the Düsseldorf Academy of Art, Beuys did {{not impose}} his artistic style or {{techniques}} on his students; in fact, he kept {{much of his}} work and exhibitions hidden from the classroom because he wanted his students to explore their own interests, ideas, and talents. Beuys' actions were somewhat contradictory: while he was extremely strict about certain aspects of classroom management and instruction, such as punctuality {{and the need for}} students to take draughtsmanship classes, he encouraged his students to freely set their own artistic goals without having to prescribe to set curricula. Another aspect of Beuys' pedagogy included open “ring discussions,” where Beuys and his students discussed political and philosophical issues of the day, including the role of art, democracy, and the university in society. Some of Beuys' ideas espoused in class discussion and in his art-making included free art education for all, the discovery of creativity in everyday life, and the belief that “everyone [...] an artist.” Beuys himself encouraged peripheral activity <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>manner</b> <b>of</b> expression to emerge during the course of these discussions. While some of Beuys' students enjoyed the open discourse of the Ringgesprache, others, including Palermo and Immendorf, disapproved of the classroom disorder, anarchic characteristics, eventually rejecting his methods and philosophies altogether.|$|E
