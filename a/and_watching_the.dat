5|$|As {{the player}} {{progresses}} through the {{different levels of}} the game, the city viewed through the apartment window in the level selection screen gradually becomes more vibrant and colorful. If the player triggers three secret flowers in each level, the cityscape is replaced with a bright field with mountains in the background. The music changes in scope as the game progresses, growing in scale and complexity and adding to the narrative arc. The credits level is played {{in a similar manner}} to the main levels, but as the player flies through each flower the name of a person involved in the game appears above it. Flower includes PlayStation Network trophies in keeping with the game's feel. While some are objective-based, many are centered on relaxing <b>and</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> scenery.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} filmed over three {{days at the}} end of October and {{beginning}} of November 2002. It was supposed to take only two days, but the filming of the wedding scenes was postponed after Messing got sick on the first day. On November 3, 2002, the rooftop terrace scene was filmed at the New York Palace Hotel. In November 2002, the scene in Central Park was shot in New York. The wedding ceremony was filmed, in part, at Temple Israel of Hollywood. As the actors performed their lines in front of a studio audience, the writing staff stood behind the cameras taking notes in the script <b>and</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> audience's reaction to jokes. The writers often stopped the cameras and added new inflections to the dialog. According to the Knoxville News Sentinels Terry Morrow, the cast handled the changes quickly, and scenes were routinely redone up to three times even if the actors executed their lines properly.|$|E

5|$|Upon his return, Edge {{began to}} show some villainous {{characteristics}} centering on his obsession for the World Heavyweight Championship. Edge, Chris Benoit, and Shawn Michaels received a title shot for Triple H's World Heavyweight Championship at Taboo Tuesday in October 2004. Michaels won the audience vote to receive the title shot, giving Edge and Benoit a tag team title shot. During the match, an angry Edge abandoned his partner (although Benoit managed to win the title on his own) and instead interfered in the main event, costing Michaels the championship. On the November 1 episode of Raw, Edge and Benoit lost the World Tag Team Championship with Edge abandoning Benoit again and {{sitting in a chair}} <b>and</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> match. After the conclusion of the match, Edge attacked Benoit, officially turning heel {{for the first time since}} 2001. Edge then adopted a drastically different gimmick, becoming a crazed and brash villain in the process. At Survivor Series, Edge was part of Team Triple H along with Triple H, Batista and Snitsky. They were defeated by Team Orton (Randy Orton, Chris Benoit, Chris Jericho and Maven). During the match, Edge eliminated both Chris Benoit and Chris Jericho before getting eliminated by Randy Orton.|$|E

Idle was eventually caught watching the X-rated film BUtterfield 8 (suitable for audiences aged 16 years and over under the contemporary film certificates) and stripped of his prefecture, though by that time he was head boy. Idle had already refused to be senior boy in the school cadet force, as he supported the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and {{had participated in the}} yearly Aldermaston March. Idle maintains that there was little to do at the school, and boredom drove him to study hard and consequently win a place at Cambridge University.|$|E

25|$|Waiting <b>and</b> <b>watching,</b> <b>the</b> team {{hoped to}} catch the killer, who they assumed would enter the suite to suffocate Kamen. When nobody but Barbara’s brother arrived, they decided to call off the stake-out. As they went to awaken Kamen, however, they were horrified to find her dead. An autopsy of both the {{miniature}} Barbara as well as Officer Kamen later revealed {{that the cause of}} death was carbon monoxide poisoning. Examining the suite and the miniature, Grissom and his team found a mechanism in Barbara’s chimney, timed in advance to drop a can of powdered charcoal onto the fire and seal off the chimney flue. The smoke from the lit fire and charcoal would then produce enough carbon monoxide to poison and suffocate anyone in the room. The murder proved that Ernie Dell was not in fact the real Miniature Killer, but had taken the blame (and the bullet) for someone else.|$|E
25|$|The {{whole notion}} of {{politics}} is they always present you with this or this or this. I'll get a newspaper to read between the lines. Why {{do you have to}} adhere to prescribed formulas that they have and people argue over them and they're all in a box. And you watch Fox claw CNN, and CNN claw Fox. Sometimes I catch a piece of the news and it seems insanity to me. I quietly support candidates. I'm not out there banging a drum for candidates. But I have supported a candidate and it's a whole other world. Once you've been exposed to it, once or twice or however many times, if you know the facts and see how they're presented, it's mind-boggling. It's a very scary arena to be in, but I do vote. I go in there and pull the lever. It's kind of like pulling the lever <b>and</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> trap door fall out from beneath you. Why should we trust any of these people?

25|$|Man {{found dead}} on the {{mountains}} – Early on Wednesday morning {{it was reported that}} two men, named John Litt and John Vickers, who had been following the Blencathra hounds the previous day had not returned. Litt had been last seen on the bog about 200 yards west of Raven Crag where he had been, with other, resting <b>and</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> hounds in the valley below. … Although he seemed somewhat fatigued he did not complain, and the hunters, absorbed in the chase did not look behind. When his absence from home was known a number of willing volunteers went to search for him. … Mr David Powley at once proceeded to Mr Oliver, the shepherd on Castlerigg Fell, who probably was the last person in Litt’s company, and the two immediately struck for the point where Mr Oliver parted from the deceased. They took a dog with them and it found the body not fifteen yards from the place they were making to. The searchers were: Messrs C. C. Thompson, Thos. Hodgson (Station Road), J. W. Grisdale, Thos. Harrison, David Powley, Joseph Bouch, Geo. Atkinson, Isaac Wren, Joseph Bristo, Benjamin Hodgson, A. G. Pettit, and Wm. Wood.|$|E

25|$|Footage of {{the game}} was first shown on May 10, when it was {{revealed}} that Shiny personnel had been on the film set every day of principal photography, shooting footage of sets, costumes and props, <b>and</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> filming of action scenes. Sega revealed that two levels in the game would be set in locations visited in the book, but not the film, and that the game world would be more expansive than the film world, with locations seen only briefly in the film opened out in the game, such as Coulter's apartment. Shiny had worked very closely with the filmmakers, and had received digital scans of costumes, cyberscans of the principal cast's faces, set designs, plans, and concept art to facilitate the cutscenes' graphical recreation of the film world as closely as possible. The developers had also shot footage of numerous animals in Wildlife WayStation, which would be used to create the many dæmons in the game, as well as footage of polar bears in Churchill, Manitoba. To ensure the animals in the game moved as realistically as possible, the real footage was animated over by the art department.|$|E

All [...] the people who run the festival are members of The Wanderers fan club, all wear Wanderers jackets, and [...] know every line in the film.

500|$|Writing for Rolling Stone, Tom Moon called Washing Machine [...] "a sardonic, wise-ass, indulgent {{and totally}} {{captivating}} album", declaring {{that it was}} [...] "anti-hook" [...] and [...] "disavows (and sometimes mocks) the conventional post-Nirvana wisdom". He highlighted Ranaldo and Moore's guitar interplay on every track, commenting that [...] "they've developed an attack that is astonishingly intricate and jazzlike in its extreme flexibility". Prominent music critic Robert Christgau also praised the album and compared some songs favorably to the Grateful Dead and the Fleetwoods. Los Angeles Times writer Lorraine Ali stated that the album [...] "finds Sonic Youth taking no radical new steps but instead holding onto its original groundbreaking formula <b>and</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> big pop world come to it". In contrast, Entertainment Weeklys Browne felt that the band explored new challenges and wrote that Washing Machine was their [...] "most audacious step yet".|$|E

500|$|The {{outbreak}} of the First World War curtailed the 1914 festival; the conflict and {{the political and economic}} upheavals that followed the war closed the Festpielhaus until 1924. [...] Plans for the festival's resumption coincided with an upsurge in Germany of extreme nationalist politics. Adolf Hitler, a fervent Wagner admirer, first visited Wahnfried in 1923, and although he was not received by Cosima he befriended the family and was thereafter a regular visitor. The Chamberlains, together with Winifred, became enthusiastic members of the Nazi Party, and the 1924 festival became an overt rally for the party and its leading supporters. That year Cosima, then 86, ended her long absence from the theatre by attending the dress rehearsals for Parsifal, <b>and</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> first act at the opening performance on 23 July.

500|$|Forty-two {{songs are}} {{featured}} on disc {{as part of}} the game's main [...] "GH Live" [...] career mode. Players progress though the career mode by playing one of several continuous sets of three to five songs, with each set presented as part of a concert performance. During a set, the game shows the note highway, the on-screen fretboard which represents the notes the player should play in time to the music, and other gameplay elements. This is shown atop live-action footage taken from the first-person perspective of the lead guitar player of one of several fictional bands, performing on stage <b>and</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> reaction of the crowd and their bandmates. The live-action footage is manipulated by the game to reflect how well the player is performing. Once the player has completed a set, all songs from that set are available in a quickplay mode, allowing the player to perform a single song at a time which they can use to practice the song or attempt to achieve a better score.|$|E

[...] He also complimented the innovations of the menu, but added that [...] "it's not particularly impressive" [...] and [...] "you need to be pretty nifty with your handset to find them." [...] Music Week said: [...] "The DVD version of Spears' high-flying 'best of' set adds bells and whistles to the audio version at only a slight premium pricewise. Twenty promo videos are included, all with top-notch sound and vision". AllMusic gave the video {{four and a half}} stars out of five. Rolling Stone graded it with three out of five stars.|$|E
