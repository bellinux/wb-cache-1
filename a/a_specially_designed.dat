5|$|The {{economics}} of fission–fusion designs {{have always been}} questionable. The same basic effect can be created by replacing the central fusion reactor with <b>a</b> <b>specially</b> <b>designed</b> fission reactor, and using the surplus neutrons from the fission to breed fuel in the blanket. These fast breeder reactors have proven uneconomical in practice, and the greater expense of the fusion systems in the fission–fusion hybrid has always suggested they would be uneconomical unless built in very large units.|$|E

5|$|The Chicago {{exhibition}} was sufficiently successful to prompt businessman Charles L. Willoughby to commission a second version, {{which opened in}} Boston, Massachusetts, on December 22, 1884. From its opening until 1892, approximately 200,000 people viewed the painting. The Boston version was housed in <b>a</b> <b>specially</b> <b>designed</b> building, the Cyclorama Building, on Tremont Street, and {{was the site of}} popular public lectures on the battle. Two additional copies of the cyclorama were made: the third was first exhibited in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, beginning in February 1886 and a fourth debuted in Brooklyn, New York, in October 1886.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea for}} the {{expedition}} had arisen after items from the American vessel Jeannette, which had sunk off the north coast of Siberia in 1881, were discovered three years later off the south-west coast of Greenland. The wreckage had obviously been carried across the polar ocean, perhaps across the pole itself. Based on this and other debris recovered from the Greenland coast, the meteorologist Henrik Mohn developed a theory of transpolar drift, which led Nansen to believe that <b>a</b> <b>specially</b> <b>designed</b> ship could be frozen in the pack ice and follow the same track as the Jeannette wreckage, thus reaching {{the vicinity of the}} pole.|$|E

5|$|Ikaruga is a shoot 'em up {{video game}} {{developed}} by Treasure. It is the spiritual sequel to Radiant Silvergun (1998) and was originally released in Japanese arcades in December 2001. The game's story follows a rebel pilot named Shinra as he battles an enemy nation using <b>a</b> <b>specially</b> <b>designed</b> fighter called the Ikaruga which can flip between two polarities, black and white. This polarity mechanic is the game's key feature and {{the foundation for}} its stage and enemy design. All enemies and bullets in the game are either black or white. Bullets which are {{the same color as}} the player are absorbed while the others will kill the player. The game features both single-player and cooperative modes.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, {{the fire}} {{department}} moved to Fire Station #6 with the bulb; the bulb socket's cord was severed for fear that unscrewing the bulb could damage it. It was deprived of electricity for only 22 minutes during the transfer, which was made in <b>a</b> <b>specially</b> <b>designed</b> box and with full firetruck escort. An electrician was on hand to install the bulb into the new fire station's emergency generator. Ripley's Believe It Or Not stated that the short delay would not mar the bulb's continuous burning record. In 2001, the bulb's 100th birthday was celebrated with a community barbecue and live music. Since that move, the bulb has run continuously for 38 years; previously it had only been off the grid for {{short periods of time}} (e.g. a week in 1937 for a renovation and the odd power outage).|$|E

5|$|Shackleton's {{original}} unpublished plan envisaged basing {{himself at}} the old Discovery Expedition headquarters in McMurdo Sound. From there he proposed to launch attempts to reach the geographical South Pole and the South Magnetic Pole. Other journeys would follow, {{and there would be}} a continuous programme of scientific work. This early plan also revealed Shackleton's proposed transport methods, involving a combination of dogs, ponies and <b>a</b> <b>specially</b> <b>designed</b> motor vehicle. Neither ponies nor motor traction had been used in the Antarctic before, although ponies had been used by Frederick Jackson during the Jackson-Harmsworth Arctic expedition of 1894–97. Despite Jackson's confused reports of his ponies' prowess, and contrary to specific advice from Nansen, the renowned Norwegian polar traveller, Shackleton decided he would take 15 ponies, later scaled down to 10. By the time he announced his plans to the RGS in February 1907 Shackleton had revised his cost estimate to a more realistic £30,000 (updated value £). However, the response of the RGS to Shackleton's proposals was muted; Shackleton would learn later that the Society was by this time aware of Scott's wish to lead a new expedition and that the Society wished to reserve its full approval for Scott.|$|E
5|$|Beginning the mission's fourth spacewalk at 13:45 UTC, Massimino and Good {{went to work}} {{repairing}} the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS). The spectrograph failed in 2004 due to a blown power supply. As with the ACS, the STIS was not designed {{with the intention of}} servicing it while in space, and one of the major challenges was to remove a cover plate held tight with over 100 screws using <b>a</b> <b>specially</b> <b>designed</b> tool called a fastener-capture plate, designed to trap the screws and washers and prevent them from floating into space when removed. While preparing the fastener-capture plate, Massimino encountered issues with a handrail that had to be removed to accommodate the fastener-capture plate. The handrail had a stripped bolt on the bottom, preventing it from being released. After trying multiple options without success, managers on the ground advised Massimino to use brute force to remove the handrail, so he could proceed with the removal of the cover plate. The procedure was tested at Goddard Space Flight Center prior to approving it, showing that the stripped bolt could be broken off safely using force. Working inside the orbiter, Feustel walked Massimino through the procedure slowly, advising him to tape the handrail with Kapton tape to prevent any parts from breaking off or flying loose, {{to be aware of the}} reaction the force would have, as well as to watch for sharp edges on the handrail after removal.|$|E
5|$|During {{its initial}} development, Versus XIII used Crystal Tools, a {{proprietary}} game engine created by Square Enix for seventh-generation gaming hardware {{that would be}} used throughout the company for multiple games, including XIII and Final Fantasy XIV. Later, Tabata described the Crystal Tools hardware {{as an extension of the}} technology of the previous gaming generation. During 2010, Nomura revealed that the team were using read world-based physical calculations to determine weather and cloud behavior in-game. By 2011, Nomura announced that the game was no longer using Crystal Tools, and instead used <b>a</b> <b>specially</b> <b>designed</b> proprietary gameplay engine combined by lighting technology from Luminous Studio, an engine built for eighth-generation gaming hardware. The focus on realism influenced the decision to incorporate the more advanced lighting technology, while the specially designed engine had a limited area of use. The planned scale of the open world increased so much that the older technology eventually became obsolete as it was restricting the developers. The need to create new technology to cope with these problems further added to initial development difficulties. The original plan was to have interactive real-time event scenes. Nomura felt that regular storytelling cutscenes in other games interrupted gameplay and caused players to skip them. Furthermore, the development frame could theoretically be shortened as there was no need to create cutscenes-exclusive high-polygon character models. However, seamless transitions of these events into the gameplay were hard to achieve and instead increased the time that had to be invested by the team. After the full shift onto eighth-generation platforms, multiple planned elements were influenced by the new Luminous technology: the in-game cutscene camera was optimized to work similarly to the one used in pre-rendered movies, and more environmental and gameplay elements could be included such as an increased number of destructible environments and the player character's warping to faraway spots on the game maps. It also enabled Nomura to start experimenting with higher facial detail for enemies such as behemoths.|$|E
