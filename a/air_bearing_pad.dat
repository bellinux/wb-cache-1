In this idealized model {{it is assumed that}} the parapet load is evenly distributed across all of the bridge <b>bearing</b> <b>pads.</b> However, this assumption is incorrect. The {{purpose of this study is}} to demonstrate that the parapet load distribution is more complicated than an evenly distributed load.

This study utilizes the finite element program, NISA, to model and analyze a simple span bridge.

The design example specified the span length, clear roadway width, prestressed girder type, and girder spacing of the bridge. The bridge is modeled under two different loading conditions to ensure a comprehensive array of results is obtained. The two loading conditions were carefully designed to compare the idealized model, utilized by the Federal Highway Administration, to the real world parapet load distribution. 	The focus of this study is to determine how the parapet load distribution will affect the <b>bearing</b> <b>pad</b> reactions in a simple span bridge.

In this study, the drills {{are found to}} degrade rapidly on the cutting edges, <b>bearing</b> <b>pads</b> and side margins, {{largely due to the}} extreme heat resistivity of the high temperature superalloys. Severe adhesive wear developed on the rake and flank faces deteriorates cutting efficiencies of the cutting edges while diffusive wear on the <b>bearing</b> <b>pads</b> and side margins deteriorates self-piloting efficacies of the drill. Coupled with highly irregular wear rates on the inner and outer cutting edges, the drills are forced against the hole at high rotational speeds – leading to escalations in frictional contact, heating and thermal damage on the <b>bearing</b> <b>pads</b> and side margins. As a consequence, the drills are deflected from the designated drilling course and resulted in straightness deviation on the part of hole drilled.

40|$|Linear aerostatic {{bearings}} {{are frequently}} used in high precision stages for their advantageous bearing properties, with low friction and absence of stick-slip being most notable. To improve relatively low out-of-plane stiffness of <b>air</b> <b>bearings,</b> pre-loading is applied. A common method of pre-loading is by utilizing vacuum, where a constant vacuum force decreases film height resulting in increased stiffness. Other methods for increasing stiffness are available, {{which is an}} active field of research. However, high stiffness results in strong coupling between bearing and running surface, transferring unwanted external vibrations. The amount of vibration transfer is quantified as transmissibility, which is the ratio of displacements between coupled surfaces. This property is frequency dependent. To reduce disturbance from external vibrations, this research focusses on reducing <b>air</b> <b>bearing</b> stiffness by combining pressurized and vacuum <b>bearing</b> <b>pads,</b> which to {{the knowledge of the}} author has not yet been researched. To analyse stiffness behaviour, <b>air</b> <b>bearings</b> have been modelled based on Reynolds equation. The effect of a vibrating running surface is modelled by linear perturbation of Reynolds equation. Resulting equations have been solved with a self developed finite volume method code, resulting in air film stiffness and damping as a function of frequency in an computationally efficient manner. Two combinations of thrust and vacuum bearings with a stable low stiffness operating point have been designed with the developed models. By offsetting vacuum and thrust surfaces or by using a micrometer pocket in the thrust bearing surface, vacuum and thrust stiffness cancel out, creating a range of low stiffness between regions with higher stiffness. To validate the models, <b>air</b> <b>bearings</b> have been manufactured. Measurements on restrictor properties have shown the literature model to be invalid for realistic pressure drops. Without taking the measured restrictor behaviour into account, model and measurement will not match. Also shown is that controlling surfaces flatness is essential for predictable bearing behaviour. Performance of available production methods is thoroughly researched. Model and measurement correspondence can only be achieved by taking surface properties into account. Also, the low tip-tilt stiffness of a single <b>air</b> <b>bearing</b> has been found to negatively effect measurements on film height. By using three bearings in the measurement set-up, tip-tilt stiffness has been significantly increased. This reduces measurement uncertainty. By taking these findings into account, excellent agreement between measurements and model has been achieved. This clears the way for development of a low stiffness prototype, combining thrust and vacuum bearings. Ideas on model improvement and prototype development are shared in the recommendations.

Three main finite element models are created to estimate the live load deflections under the recommended live load conditions as per AASHTO LRFD specifications.
