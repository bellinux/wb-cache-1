5|$|An oil sketch {{attributed}} to Etty, given to York Art Gallery in 1952 by Judith Hare, Countess of Listowel and entitled Three Female Nudes, is possibly <b>a</b> <b>preliminary</b> study by Etty for Youth and Pleasure, or a copy {{by a student}} of the three central figures. Art historian Sarah Burnage considers both possibilities unlikely, as neither the arrangement of figures, the subject matter or the sea serpent approaching the group appear to relate to the completed Youth and Pleasure, and considers it more likely to be <b>a</b> <b>preliminary</b> sketch for a now-unknown work.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>preliminary</b> {{examination}} of the imagery suggests that S/2015 (136472) 1 has a reflectivity similar to charcoal, making it an extremely dark object. This is somewhat surprising because Makemake is the second-brightest known object in the Kuiper belt. One hypothesis to explain this is that its gravity is {{not strong enough to}} prevent bright but volatile ices from being lost to space when it is heated by the distant Sun.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>preliminary</b> study {{indicated}} that yoga may improve psychological health during cancer treatment, although more complete clinical evidence is needed to confirm this possible effect. Other preliminary research indicated that yoga could be a useful supplementary treatment to reduce the general psychopathology of schizophrenia, and may have positive effects on mental health, although the quality of research to define these effects is low.|$|E

5|$|A {{reusable}} Two-Stage-To-Orbit (TSTO) {{launch vehicle}} was {{planned to be}} implemented about 15 years after the addition of LFBBs to Ariane 5. However, only <b>a</b> <b>preliminary</b> analysis of TSTO was completed. The proposed configuration consisted of two boosters with retractable wings attached to the external fuel tank, and a reusable orbiter with fixed wings carrying payload on top of it. During geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) missions, an additional, expandable upper stage would be used.|$|E
5|$|After a gap {{of several}} decades, {{in the early}} 1980s, Vimala Begley studied the {{ceramics}} find of the site and proposed <b>a</b> <b>preliminary</b> version of the chronology of the occupation of the site.

5|$|Following <b>a</b> <b>preliminary</b> {{peace in}} 1712, the Treaty of Utrecht ended {{the war in}} 1713.

Some of its terms were ambiguous, and concerns of various Indian tribes {{were not included in}} the treaty, setting the stage for future conflicts.|$|E

5|$|However, the court's {{role was}} to rule on whether {{publication}} was legal, not whether it was wise. In keeping with the usual practice of keeping {{a temporary restraining order}} in effect for as short a time as possible, Warren ordered that hearings be held on <b>a</b> <b>preliminary</b> injunction in one week's time, on March 16. At the request of both parties, this was postponed to March 26 so they would have time to file their briefs and affidavits. The parties were therefore back in court again on March 26 for a hearing on the government's request for <b>a</b> <b>preliminary</b> injunction. Warren decided not to hold an evidentiary hearing at which the opposing teams of experts could be cross examined. He also declined a suggestion by the Federation of American Scientists in its amicus curiae brief that a panel of experts be charged with examining the issue. The case relied on written affidavits and briefs, and the opposing counsels' oral arguments.|$|E
5|$|In 1928, Rand made {{notes for}} a proposed, but never written, novel titled The Little Street. Rand's notes for it contain {{elements}} that {{carried over into}} her work on The Fountainhead. David Harriman, who edited the notes for the posthumously published Journals of Ayn Rand (1997), described the story's villain as <b>a</b> <b>preliminary</b> version of the character Ellsworth Toohey, and this villain's assassination by the protagonist as prefiguring the attempted assassination of Toohey.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, {{the tournament}} format was again {{switched}} to being {{similar to the}} version used at the Olympics. <b>A</b> <b>preliminary</b> round involving 11 teams was played, then the top four advanced to the medal round and medals were awarded based on points; no gold medal game was played.
