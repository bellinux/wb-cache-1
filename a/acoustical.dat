5|$|Researchers {{speculate}} that <b>acoustical</b> mimicry {{is related to}} the level of interaction between the host and parasite. In the Phengaris genus, there are two different strategies: the cuckoo strategy used by P. rebeli and the predatory strategy used by Phengaris arion. In P. rebeli, the Phengaris larvae become integrated into the colony and are attended by worker ants. However, larvae in predatory species prey on the ants’ brood and consequently spend much of their life hiding in pockets of the brood nest.|$|E
5|$|The Quad Electrostatic Loudspeaker (ESL) is the world's first {{production}} full-range electrostatic loudspeaker, {{launched in}} 1957 by Quad Electroacoustics, {{then known as}} the <b>Acoustical</b> Manufacturing Co. Ltd. The speaker is shaped somewhat like a home electric radiator curved slightly on the vertical axis. They are widely admired for their clarity and precision, but known to be difficult speakers to run and maintain.|$|E
5|$|As chief {{engineer}} at Altec, Hilliard joined the Hollywood {{section of the}} Sapphire Group, a regular social gathering of sound recordists and a precursor to the Audio Engineering Society. In 1948, Hilliard was elected to chair the Sapphire Group Recording Standards Committee. He made certain, along with the Motion Picture Research Council, that proposed industry standards were forwarded to members of National Association of Broadcasters (NAB), Institute of Radio Engineers (IRE), <b>Acoustical</b> Society of America (ASA) and Royal Musical Association (RMA). Hilliard helped form the Los Angeles section of the Audio Engineering Society (AES) in 1951. At the beginning of 1963, IRE merged with the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE) to form the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE)—Hilliard retained his Fellowship.|$|E
5|$|The fixed {{reed and}} fairly uniform {{diameter}} of the clarinet give the instrument an <b>acoustical</b> behavior approximating that of a cylindrical stopped pipe. Recorders use a tapered internal bore to overblow at the octave when the thumb/register hole is pinched open, while the clarinet, with its cylindrical bore, overblows at the 12th. Adjusting {{the angle of the}} bore taper controls the frequencies of the overblown notes (harmonics). Changing the mouthpiece's tip opening and the length of the reed changes aspects of the harmonic timbre or voice of the clarinet because this changes the speed of reed vibrations. Generally, the goal of the clarinetist when producing a sound is to make as much of the reed vibrate as possible, making the sound fuller, warmer, and potentially louder.|$|E
5|$|The {{music of}} Carmen {{has since been}} widely {{acclaimed}} for brilliance of melody, harmony, atmosphere, and orchestration, and for the skill with which Bizet musically represented the emotions and suffering of his characters. After the composer's death, the score was subject to significant amendment, including the introduction of recitative {{in place of the}} original dialogue; there is no standard edition of the opera, and different views exist as to what versions best express Bizet's intentions. The opera has been recorded many times since the first <b>acoustical</b> recording in 1908, and the story {{has been the subject of}} many screen and stage adaptations.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Hixon was {{the first}} to {{describe}} the use of electromagnetic principles to measure articulation. In his letter to the editor, published in The Journal of the <b>Acoustical</b> Society of America, he described a setup using two sensor coils and one generator coil. The sensor coils, attached to the forehead and back of the neck, would remain stationary while the generator coil, attached to the jaw, would move creating variable currents in the sensor coils. These currents could then be used to determine the distance in two dimensions.|$|E
5|$|Beecham {{began making}} {{recordings}} in 1910, when the <b>acoustical</b> process obliged orchestras {{to use only}} principal instruments, placed {{as close to the}} recording horn as possible. His first recordings, for HMV, were of excerpts from Offenbach's The Tales of Hoffmann and Johann Strauss's Die Fledermaus. In 1915, Beecham began recording for the Columbia Graphophone Company. Electrical recording technology (introduced in 1925–26) made it possible to record a full orchestra with much greater frequency range, and Beecham quickly embraced the new medium. Longer scores had to be broken into four-minute segments to fit on 12-inch 78-rpm discs, but Beecham was not averse to recording piecemeal– his well-known 1932 disc of Chabrier's España was recorded in two sessions three weeks apart. Beecham recorded many of his favourite works several times, taking advantage of improved technology over the decades.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs are {{a diverse}} group of {{primates}} in terms of morphology and physiology. Some lemurs, such as the sportive lemurs and indriids, have longer hind limbs than forelimbs, making them excellent leapers. Indriids also have a specialized digestive system for folivory, exhibiting enlarged salivary glands, a spacious stomach, and an elongated caecum (lower gut) that facilitates fermentation. The hairy-eared dwarf lemur (Allocebus trichotis) reportedly has a very long tongue, allowing it to feed on nectar. Likewise, the red-bellied lemur (Eulemur rubriventer) has a feathery brush-shaped tongue, also uniquely adapted to feed on nectar and pollen. The aye-aye has evolved some traits that are unique among primates, making it stand out among the lemurs. Such traits include continuously growing, rodent-like front teeth for gnawing through wood and hard seeds; a highly mobile, filiform (filament-shaped) middle finger for extracting food from tiny holes; large, bat-like ears for detecting hollow spaces within trees; and use of self-generated <b>acoustical</b> cues to forage.|$|E
5|$|Three major {{problems}} persisted, leading to motion pictures and sound recording largely taking separate paths for a generation. The primary issue was synchronization: pictures and sound were recorded and played back by separate devices, which {{were difficult to}} start and maintain in tandem. Sufficient playback volume was also hard to achieve. While motion picture projectors soon allowed film to be shown to large theater audiences, audio technology before the development of electric amplification could not project satisfactorily to fill large spaces. Finally, there was the challenge of recording fidelity. The primitive systems of the era produced sound of very low quality unless the performers were stationed {{directly in front of}} the cumbersome recording devices (<b>acoustical</b> horns, for the most part), imposing severe limits on the sort of films that could be created with live-recorded sound.|$|E
25|$|<b>Acoustical</b> {{engineering}} {{is one of}} many other sub-disciplines of mechanical engineering and is the application of acoustics. <b>Acoustical</b> {{engineering is}} the study of Sound and Vibration. These engineers work effectively to reduce noise pollution in mechanical devices and in buildings by soundproofing or removing sources of unwanted noise. The study of acoustics can range from designing a more efficient hearing aid, microphone, headphone, or recording studio to enhancing the sound quality of an orchestra hall. <b>Acoustical</b> engineering also deals with the vibration of different mechanical systems.|$|E
25|$|The {{first version}} {{is used for}} dynamic {{similarity}} of the fluid motion in whistles while the second version is used for dynamic similarity of the <b>acoustical</b> motion in whistles. Many whistles, especially those with Class III feedback, require use of both numbers. The <b>acoustical</b> Strouhal number is essentially the Helmholtz number with the 2 deleted.|$|E

25|$|Acoustics is the {{interdisciplinary}} science {{that deals with}} the study of mechanical waves in gases, liquids, and solids including vibration, sound, ultrasound, and infrasound. A scientist {{who works in the}} field of acoustics is an acoustician, while someone working in the field of <b>acoustical</b> engineering may be called an <b>acoustical</b> engineer. An audio engineer, on the other hand, is concerned with the recording, manipulation, mixing, and reproduction of sound.|$|E

25|$|Electrical {{recording}} preceded electrical home reproduction {{because of}} the initial high cost of the new system. In 1925, the Victor company introduced the Orthophonic Victrola, an <b>acoustical</b> record player that was specifically designed to play electrically recorded discs, {{as part of a}} line that also included electrically reproducing Electrolas. The <b>acoustical</b> Orthophonics ranged in price from US$95 to $300, depending on cabinetry; by comparison, the cheapest Electrola cost $650, the price of a new car in an era when clerical jobs paid about $20 a week.|$|E
25|$|Symphony Hall {{was inaugurated}} on October 15, 1900, after the Orchestra's {{original}} home (the Old Boston Music Hall) was threatened by road-building and subway construction. Architects McKim, Mead and White engaged Wallace Clement Sabine, a young {{assistant professor of}} physics at Harvard University, as their <b>acoustical</b> consultant, and Symphony Hall {{became one of the first}} auditoria designed in accordance with scientifically derived <b>acoustical</b> principles. Admired for its lively acoustics from the time of its opening, the hall is often cited as one of the best sounding classical concert venues in the world.|$|E

25|$|Lloyd Alexander Jeffress (November 15, 1900 – April 2, 1986) was an <b>acoustical</b> scientist, a {{professor}} of Experimental Psychology at the University of Texas at Austin, a developer of mine-hunting models for the US Navy during World War II and after, and the man Nobel Laureate Linus Pauling credited with getting him interested in chemistry.|$|E
25|$|This number permits {{relationships}} {{to be developed}} between the different sizes and speeds. Now the Strouhal number can be derived directly from the dimensionless form of the mass continuity equation.

25|$|Other glazing {{material}} variations affect acoustics. The {{most widely}} used glazing configurations for sound dampening include laminated glass with varied thickness of the interlayer and thickness of the glass. Including a structural, thermally improved aluminum thermal barrier air spacer in the insulating glass can improve <b>acoustical</b> performance by reducing the transmission of exterior noise sources in the fenestration system.|$|E
25|$|Jeffress died in Austin on April 2, 1986, {{at the age}} of 85. After his death, UT {{established}} the Lloyd A. Jeffress Memorial Fellowship, the first winner of which was Dr. Beverly Wright, who {{went on to win the}} <b>Acoustical</b> Society of America's R. Bruce Lindsay Award for the advancement of theoretical or applied acoustics, or both.|$|E
25|$|There {{are other}} scales {{available}} through just intonation, {{for example the}} minor scale. Scales that do not adhere to just intonation, and instead have their intervals adjusted to meet other needs are called temperaments, of which equal temperament is the most used. Temperaments, though they obscure the <b>acoustical</b> purity of just intervals, often have desirable properties, such as a closed circle of fifths.|$|E
25|$|Some of his masses are polychoral, a {{technique}} which involved multiple, spatially separated groups of singers. While {{this was also}} {{a technique}} which developed in Venice, it was widespread {{by the end of}} the 16th century: almost all composers of sacred polyphony used polychoral techniques at some time, especially those working in large <b>acoustical</b> environments (such as most cathedrals in Europe).|$|E
25|$|When the Great Depression {{forced the}} {{research}} department to close, Hickman joined Bell Telephone <b>Acoustical</b> Laboratories. At Bell, he renewed {{his interest in}} the physics of archery, performing laboratory experiments and publishing several papers in archery journals. He also invented a method of making silk backing for bows. Also at Bell, Hickman developed metal tape recording, devices for analyzing speech patterns, and new methods of telephone switching.|$|E
