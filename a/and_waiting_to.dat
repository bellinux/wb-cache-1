25|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Chris Robinson. It premiered on VH1 on March 5, 2012. The video {{was inspired by the}} films Thelma & Louise (1991) <b>and</b> <b>Waiting</b> <b>to</b> Exhale (1995), and portrays the singers in dysfunctional relationships and helping each other in both situations. Monica and Brandy promoted the song doing several performances, radio and television interviews. The singers were also going to perform the track on the Clive Davis' Pre-Grammy Party in 2012; however, the performance was cancelled following Whitney Houston's passing.|$|E
25|$|Four {{billion years}} in Earth's past, {{a group of}} Salaxalans attempt to {{populate}} the Earth; however, a mistake caused by their engineer – who used an Electric Monk to irrationally believe the proposed fix would work – causes their landing craft to explode, killing the Salaxalans and generating the spark of energy needed to start the process of life on Earth. The ghost of the Salaxalan engineer roams the earth waiting to undo his mistake, watching human life develop <b>and</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> find a soul that it can possess. The ghost finds it can only possess individuals that fundamentally {{want to do the}} same task it is trying to accomplish itself. Otherwise, it is only able to influence the individual in subtle ways.|$|E
25|$|Having largely {{retired from}} public life, {{he had his}} last years clouded by the 1847 death of his sole {{daughter}} from his first marriage, Fanny, duchess of Choiseul-Praslin. Fanny had married Charles, duc de Praslin, in 1825. In what {{was one of the}} most famous murders of the 19th century, the duchess had been stabbed repeatedly and with noted violence. For long before her death, Fanny had accused Charles de Choiseul-Praslin of having cheated on her and of having separated her from her children. Her killing was thought to be a consequence of the Duke's plan to run away with their children's governess. Arrested <b>and</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> be tried by the Court of Peers, Choiseul-Praslin was released on parole, only to commit suicide on 24 August 1847; shortly before his death, he denied all charges. This event played a part in bringing about the 1848 Revolution, after public opinion began speculating that aristocrats had allowed one of their own to take his own life rather than face trial, or even that Choiseul-Praslin had been allowed to escape. As a parallel result, the 1848 events brought an end to the Sébastianis' influence in Corsica, especially after Tiburce Sébastiani chose to retire to his domain in Olmeta-di-Tuda.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the end of}} the tour, guitarist Steve Hackett {{recorded}} a solo album, Voyage of the Acolyte with guitarist/bassist Mike Rutherford and drummer Phil Collins, feeling unsure that Genesis would survive. He reconvened with the remaining group members in July 1975. Banks and Rutherford were particularly keen to write and record new material so that critics and fans would accept Gabriel's departure. The group began rehearsals in a basement studio in Acton, and quickly wrote material they were happy with, but had not yet found a replacement lead singer. They placed an anonymous advertisement in the music paper Melody Maker for [...] "a singer for a Genesis-type group", which received around 400 replies. Some applicants sent photographs of themselves in costume and wearing masks, as Gabriel had done on stage. A few weeks into rehearsals, Melody Maker managed to find out about Gabriel leaving the band, and their story made {{the front page of the}} 16 August issue, where journalist Chris Welch declared Genesis dead. The group spoke to the music papers to deny they were splitting up and explaining they had an album finished <b>and</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> be recorded.|$|E
500|$|After their October 4, 1777, {{defeat at}} the Battle of Germantown, Washington's army retreated along Skippack Pike to Pawling's Mill, beyond the Perkiomen Creek, where they {{remained}} encamped until October 8. They then marched east on Skippack Pike, turned left on Forty-Foot Road (present-day Old Forty-Foot Road), and marched to Sumneytown Pike, where they camped {{on the property}} of Frederick Wampole near Kulpsville in Towamencin Township. [...] While there, Brig. Gen. Francis Nash died of wounds incurred at Germantown and {{was buried in the}} Mennonite Meeting Cemetery. Washington remained at Towamencin for one week, gathering supplies <b>and</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> see if Howe would move against him. On October 16, Washington moved his forces to Methacton Hill in Worcester Township. After learning of Howe's withdrawal from Germantown to Philadelphia, Washington moved his army to Whitpain, [...] closer to Philadelphia, on October 20. [...] On October 29, Washington's army numbered 8,313 Continentals and 2,717 militia, although the terms of enlistment of many soldiers from Maryland and Virginia were due to expire. [...] With his ranks reinforced, Washington dispatched a brigade to assist with the defense of Forts Mifflin and Mercer, on the Delaware River. On November 2, at the recommendation of his council of war, Washington marched his forces to White Marsh, approximately [...] northwest of Philadelphia. At White Marsh, the army began to build redoubts and defensive works.|$|E
500|$|Robert Catesby (1573–1605), {{a man of}} [...] "ancient, {{historic}} and distinguished lineage", was the inspiration behind the plot. [...] He was described by contemporaries as [...] "a good-looking man, about six feet tall, athletic and a good swordsman". [...] Along with several other conspirators, he {{took part in the}} Earl of Essex's rebellion in 1601, during which he was wounded and captured. [...] Queen Elizabeth allowed him to escape with his life after fining him 4,000marks (equivalent to more than £6million in 2008), after which he sold his estate in Chastleton. [...] In 1603 Catesby helped to organise a mission to the new king of Spain, Philip III, urging Philip to launch an invasion attempt on England, which they assured him would be well supported, particularly by the English Catholics. [...] Thomas Wintour (1571–1606) was chosen as the emissary, but the Spanish king, although sympathetic to the plight of Catholics in England, was intent on making peace with James. [...] Wintour had also attempted to convince the Spanish envoy Don Juan de Tassis that [...] "3,000 Catholics" [...] were ready <b>and</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> support such an invasion. [...] Concern was voiced by Pope Clement VIII that using violence to achieve a restoration of Catholic power in England would result in the destruction of those that remained.|$|E

500|$|When Amin became leader, {{he tried}} to reduce Afghanistan's {{dependence}} on the Soviet Union. To accomplish this, he aimed to balance Afghanistan's relations with the Soviet Union by strengthening relations with Pakistan and Iran. The Soviets were concerned when they received reports that Amin had met personally with Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, {{one of the leading}} anti-communists in Afghanistan. His general untrustworthiness and his unpopularity amongst Afghans made it more difficult for Amin to find new [...] "foreign patrons". Amin's involvement in the death of Adolph Dubs, the American Ambassador to Afghanistan, strained his relations with the United States. He tried to improve relations by reestablishing contact, met with three different American chargé d'affaires, and was interviewed by an American correspondent. But this did not improve Afghanistan's standing {{in the eyes of the}} United States Government. After the third meeting with Amin, J. Bruce Amstutz, the American Ambassador to Afghanistan from 1979 to 1980, believed the wisest thing to do was to maintain [...] "a low profile, trying to avoid issues, <b>and</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> see what happens". In early December 1979, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs proposed a joint summit meeting between Amin and Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, the President of Pakistan. The Pakistani Government, accepting a modified version of the offer, agreed to send Agha Shahi, the Pakistani foreign minister, to Kabul for talks. In the meanwhile, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), Pakistani's secret police, continued to train Mujahideen fighters who opposed the communist regime.|$|E
