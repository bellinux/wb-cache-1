5|$|Although Mazariegos {{had managed}} to {{establish}} his new provincial capital without armed conflict, excessive Spanish demands for labour and supplies soon provoked the locals into rebellion. In August 1528, Mazariegos replaced the existing encomenderos with his friends and allies; the natives, seeing the Spanish isolated and witnessing the hostility between the original and newly arrived settlers, took this opportunity to rebel <b>and</b> <b>refused</b> to supply their new masters. Zinacantán was the only indigenous settlement that remained loyal to the Spanish.|$|E

5|$|Citing {{the trust}} {{relationship}} between {{the federal government and}} the tribes, the Court held that removal treaties could only be enforced against the tribes by the federal government, not private parties (whether through self-help or through the courts).

At the same time, the Court held that enrolled treaties are conclusively valid, <b>and</b> <b>refused</b> to consider the plaintiffs claim that the Treaty of Buffalo Creek (1838) was fraudulent.|$|E

In its defense, TF1 refused to distribute Miracle at St. Anna, claiming that Lee had made a different film than the one promised, <b>and</b> <b>refused</b> to pay On My Own the €11 million advance needed to distribute the film internationally.|$|E
