5|$|The Sera {{complex is}} divided into two sectors by pathways; the eastern part {{contains}} the Great <b>Assembly</b> <b>Hall</b> and the dwellings and the western part has the well-known three colleges: the Sera Je Dratsang, the Sera Me Dratsang; and the Ngakpa Dratsang, all instituted by Tsongkhapa as monastic universities that catered to monks in the age range 8-70. All the structures within this complex formed a clockwise pilgrimage circuit, starting with the colleges (in the order stated), followed by the hall, the dwelling units and finally ending at the hermitage of Tsongkhapa above the Great <b>Assembly</b> <b>Hall.</b>|$|E

After initial tribulations, they established a parallel Sera Monastery with Sera Me and Sera Je colleges and a Great <b>Assembly</b> <b>Hall</b> on similar lines to the original monastery, {{with help from the}} Government of India. There are now 3000 or more monks living in Sera, India and this community has also spread its missionary activities to several countries by establishing Dharma centres, propagating knowledge of Buddhism.|$|E
