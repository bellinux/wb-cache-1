5|$|Later {{in the day}} on September 7, Captain Melbourne C. Chandler, acting {{commander}} of the 2nd Battalion, received word of G Company's location on Hill 464 from an <b>aerial</b> <b>observer</b> and sent a patrol which guided the company safely to the battalion at the eastern base of Hill 380. The battalion, meanwhile, had received radio orders to withdraw by any route as soon as possible. It moved southwest into the 5th Cavalry sector.|$|E
5|$|In June 1918, the 29th Division sailed from Hoboken, New Jersey to Brest, France. It {{travelled}} across France, {{entering the}} front line trenches in the Traubach-le-Bas sector. In France, Wilson once again applied for training as an <b>aerial</b> <b>observer,</b> {{in response to an}} appeal from American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) headquarters. This time, he was successful and in September 1918 he reported to the Air Service Concentration Barracks at Saint-Maixent. After training there, at Camp de Souge, and at Tours in November 1918, he was posted to the 2nd Corps Aeronautical School at Châtillon-sur-Seine. He was assigned to the 186th Aero Squadron at Weißenthurm (Weissenthurm) in May 1919, returned to the United States in July, and was discharged from the Army on 15 August 1919.|$|E
5|$|On 28 October New Jersey steamed {{south to}} engage Communist targets. During the {{shelling}} aircraft spotting for the battleship reported taking heavy anti-aircraft {{fire to the}} extreme north of the target zone; subsequently, New Jersey altered her fire to silence the site with her big guns. The next day New Jersey leveled 30structures, destroyed three underground bunkers, and shelled a Viet Cong trench line. That afternoon an <b>aerial</b> <b>observer</b> located an enemy artillery position on a hilltop southwest of Cap Lay. New Jersey responded by firing six 16inch rounds at the site, destroying it. Follow up assaults on 30 October destroyed a Communist resupply area and an anti-aircraft site.|$|E

50|$|Adjutant Armond/Armand Jean Berthelot was a French World War I flying ace {{credited}} with eleven confirmed aerial victories. He was a scourge to enemy <b>aerial</b> <b>observers.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the Vietnam War, <b>aerial</b> <b>observers</b> {{also might}} be Forward Air Controllers (FACs). These O-1 Bird Dog, O-2 Skymaster and OV-10 Bronco pilots would slowly fly over an area and direct bombing by radio to fast moving jet aircraft.|$|R
5|$|The 5th Maryland Infantry {{was again}} called up in April 1917 {{following}} {{the declaration of}} war by the United States on the German Empire. Wilson was promoted to second lieutenant, effective 9 April 1917. He was posted to Company C, 5th Maryland Infantry. This time, the regiment moved to Camp McClellan, Alabama, where the 5th Maryland Infantry was absorbed into the 115th Infantry of the 29th Division on 1 October 1917. While at Camp McClellan, Wilson applied for training as an <b>aerial</b> <b>observer</b> but his request was not accepted. He was promoted to first lieutenant on 23 April 1918.|$|E
5|$|Wilson {{enlisted in}} the Maryland National Guard as a private in 1916 and served with it on the Mexican border and the Western Front during World War I before {{transferring}} to the United States Army Air Service. After the war, he obtained a regular commission. Already qualified as an <b>aerial</b> <b>observer,</b> he became a pilot in 1922. For many years he was an influential instructor at the Air Corps Tactical School. Wilson became a leading theorist who embraced the doctrine that strategic bombing {{was the most important}} aspect of air power. He argued that by attacking vulnerabilities, whole industries could be brought to a halt without necessarily having to destroy all of the factories. The doctrine which Wilson expounded later became the basis for AWPD-1, the Army Air Forces' strategic war plan developed in 1941.|$|E
5|$|Although the NK 6th and 7th Divisions had massed {{their troops}} {{primarily}} for the attempted breakthrough of the US 25th Infantry Division positions along the Nam and Naktong Rivers during their September offensive, the NK 6th Division continued its attacks on the area. North Korean artillery and mortar fire fell on Battle Mountain, P'il-bong and Sobuk-san, and {{during the period of}} September 1–6 there were strong local attacks and patrols by North Korean troops. The 1st Battalion, 5th Infantry, never succeeded in gaining complete possession of the southern parts of Sobuk-san, which would have given observation into the valley below and into the North Koreans' rear areas. The instability of the 24th Infantry made it necessary for Kean to order Throckmorton to send his only regimental reserve, E Company, north into the 24th Infantry sector along the Haman road to protect the right flank of the 5th Regimental Combat Team. In this position, E Company collected stragglers from the 24th Infantry every night and the next morning sent them back to their units. The US Navy then entered the battle {{in this part of the}} line, its destroyers standing off the south coast gave illumination at night by directing their searchlights against low-hanging clouds on Sobuk-san. One destroyer was on station almost continuously, supporting the ground action with the fire of six 5-inch guns. An artillery <b>aerial</b> <b>observer</b> directed this naval gunfire through the fire direction center.|$|E
50|$|They {{were used}} in the West Virginian Coal Wars, notably in the Battle of Blair Mountain, as <b>aerial</b> <b>observers</b> sent in by President Warren Harding. One {{aircraft}} was lost, crashing on the return flight, with the loss of three crewmen.|$|R
5000|$|Amanty Airdrome was {{primarily}} {{used as a}} training airfield for new units formed by the First Army Air Service. It was {{the home of the}} 1st Observation Group School for <b>aerial</b> <b>observers</b> and <b>aerial</b> photography. Aero Squadrons trained at the airfield were: ...|$|R
5|$|September 12 is {{considered}} {{as the day}} when the North Korean offensive in the east ended. By that date, the NK 12th Division had been virtually destroyed and the NK 5th Division was trying to consolidate its survivors near P'ohang-dong. <b>Aerial</b> <b>observers</b> reported sighting many North Korean groups moving north and east.|$|R
25|$|Biziou began duty as an <b>aerial</b> <b>observer,</b> {{probably}} with 42 Squadron, on 6 October 1916, and {{was transferred to}} the Royal Flying Corps General List on 23 November 1916. On 1 April 1917, he was promoted to temporary lieutenant.|$|E
25|$|He {{was posted}} to Fliegerkompagnie 1 (Flik 1) at Czernowitz, {{commanded}} by Hauptmann Otto Jindra, in July 1915; von Brumowski was thus initially assigned as an <b>aerial</b> <b>observer</b> on the Russian Front. His flight log describes him as 1.77 meters (5 feet 10inches) tall, with {{blue eyes and}} light blond hair.|$|E
25|$|He {{joined the}} Luftfahrtruppen and was trained as an <b>aerial</b> <b>observer</b> at the Officer's Flight School at Wiener-Neustadt by March 1916. He was posted to Heinrich Kostrba's Flik 23 in the South Tyrol, where his first win went unconfirmed. More notable were his long and {{hazardous}} reconnaissance flights deep into enemy territory and his bombing missions flown through heavy antiaircraft fire.|$|E
50|$|Before the Tuskegee Airmen, no African-American {{had been}} a U.S. {{military}} pilot. In 1917, African-American men had tried to become <b>aerial</b> <b>observers,</b> but were rejected. African-American Eugene Bullard served in the French air service during World War I, {{because he was not}} allowed to serve in an American unit. Instead, Bullard returned to infantry duty with the French.|$|R
50|$|During its Vietnam service, the 19 TASS had {{suffered}} 37 USAF air crew {{killed in a}}ction, with another two killed in a flying accident. There were also a number of casualties among non-USAF <b>aerial</b> <b>observers.</b> Its aircraft losses {{over the course of}} the war amounted to 53 O-1 Bird Dogs, 12 Cessna O-2 Skymasters and 16 OV10 Broncos.|$|R
50|$|French colonial {{operations}} in the Rif War from 1920-1926 used air power similarly to the Marines in Nicaragua against the Sandinistas but in a different environment, the desert. The French Mobile Groups of combined arms not only used aircraft for scouting and air attack; the airplanes carried trained artillery officers as <b>observers.</b> These <b>aerial</b> <b>observers</b> called in artillery fire via radio.|$|R
25|$|In 1936, Wiese {{transferred}} to the Luftwaffe as an Oberfähnrich (Officer candidate). There, he was trained as an <b>aerial</b> <b>observer</b> with the Heeresaufklärer (Army Reconnaissance). Wiese was promoted to Leutnant (second lieutenant) on 1 April 1937 and in September 1938 {{transferred to}} the Fliegerersatzabteilung 17 (17th Flier Replacement Unit) in Quedlinburg. He then volunteered for the Jagdwaffe (fighter force) and holding the rank of Oberleutnant (first lieutenant) he began fighter pilot training in October 1938.|$|E
25|$|The {{outbreak}} of World War I disrupted the young aviator's progress. On 1 July 1914, Berthold was recalled from his schooling to rejoin his infantry regiment; once there, he ruefully discovered his marching skills had deteriorated during his aviation sojourn. After a fortnight's refresher course in soldierly skills, he {{was returned to}} flying training. On 17 July 1914, he was officially transferred out of the 3rd Brandenbergers to aerial service. Having fallen behind his fellow piloting students during his infantry refresher course, he {{had to settle for}} <b>aerial</b> <b>observer</b> duty. On 1 August 1914, he shipped out as a standee on a train for the Royal Saxon Air Base at Grossenhain.|$|E
25|$|After the {{creation}} by executive order in 1918 of the Army Air Service, a standard wings-and-shield {{design for the}} rating badge, still in use today, was created by sculptor Herbert S. Adams of the United States Commission of Fine Arts and approved on 25 January 1919. Army regulations regarding ratings underwent a major revision by the Director of Air Service on 16 October 1919, when the RMA rating was officially changed to Airplane Pilot (although usage of the RMA terminology continued until 1920), all observers were termed <b>Aerial</b> <b>Observer,</b> and new ratings of Enlisted Pilot, Airship Pilot, Aerial Gunner, and Aerial Bomber were created. Among the new ratings, a 50% aviation increase was authorized for the enlisted pilot and 25% for all the others. The new ratings, however, proved {{to be only a}} demobilization expedient and lasted less than nine months.|$|E
50|$|Osterroht {{was serving}} in FFA 18 when World War I began. He {{was one of}} the first German airmen to be awarded the Iron Cross First Class, {{received}} on 7 October 1914. After FFA 18, he served with Brieftauben-Abteilung Ostende in 1914 and 1915; one of his <b>aerial</b> <b>observers</b> was Manfred von Richthofen. Together they downed a French airplane so far behind French lines the victory could not be verified.|$|R
40|$|Aerial {{and ground}} surveys in 11 central South Carolina counties, {{covering}} 2, 238, 600 acres of woodland, discovered no new oak wilt centers outside the known infestation area. <b>Aerial</b> <b>observers</b> recorded 60 spots of dead or dying trees. None of these spots were {{suspected of being}} oak wilt infection centers. Another aerial survey for oak wilt should be made in 3 to 5 years covering approximately the same area of 1976 survey...|$|R
50|$|The School of Fire for the Field Artillery {{was founded}} at Fort Sill in 1911 and {{continues}} to operate today as the world-renowned U.S. Army Field Artillery School. At various times Fort Sill has also served as home to the Infantry School of Musketry, the School for <b>Aerial</b> <b>Observers,</b> the Artillery Officers Candidate School (Robinson Barracks), the Air Service Flying School and the Army Aviation School. In 1917, the Henry Post Army Airfield was constructed for artillery observation and spotting.|$|R
25|$|In 1974, {{the troop}} {{became the first}} Guard unit to receive the Bell AH-1 HueyCobra attack {{helicopter}} and was redesignated Troop E (Air). It spent its two-week annual training period in August 1980 at the Pohakuloa Training Area alongside troops of the 25th Infantry Division. Around January 1984, the troop received nine AH-1S Cobra helicopters, replacing the older Cobras. Between November 1984 and October 1986, it was commanded by Captain (later Major) Gary M. Hara, who later became deputy commanding general of United States Army Pacific. On 31 July 1986, one of the troop's Bell OH-58A Kiowa helicopters crashed, slightly injuring the pilot and <b>aerial</b> <b>observer.</b> On 1 June 1989, it was withdrawn from CARS and reorganized under United States Army Regimental System (USARS) with headquarters at Fort Ruger. The regiment was disbanded in 1995 around when its last lineage document was written.|$|E
25|$|In 1920, {{when the}} Air Service {{was made a}} {{statutory}} arm of the line, the National Defense Act of 1920 also ended the differentials in flight pay and standardized it at 50%. The policy of awarding rated officers a temporary advancement in grade was also terminated. To qualify for command of a unit, an officer was {{required by law to}} be rated. The existing ratings were reduced to four on 10 August 1920, combining the ratings of Reserve Military Aviator/Airplane Pilot, Junior Military Aviator, and Military Aviator into the rating of Airplane Pilot and Military Aeronaut and Balloon Observer into the rating of Balloon Observer, renaming the rating of <b>Aerial</b> <b>Observer</b> as Airplane Observer, and continuing the rating of Airship Pilot. All those already holding the old ratings qualified automatically for the new. In 1921 the Air Service authorized the wearing of 3.125-inch ratings badges made of oxidized silver in lieu of embroidered badges.|$|E
500|$|On September 24, 1861, Lowe {{went beyond}} simple {{observations}} when he actively directed {{the fall of}} artillery fire from nearby Camp Advance on Confederate positions near Falls Church, three miles away. The agreed-upon signaling system was simple, but effective: [...] "If we fire {{to the right of}} Falls Church, let a white flag be raised in the balloon; if to the left, let it be lowered; if over, let it be shown stationary; if under, let it be waved occasionally." [...] This event {{was the first time in}} American history that an <b>aerial</b> <b>observer</b> actively directed artillery fire.|$|E
50|$|In August 1917, Capt. H.R. Eyrich {{surveyed}} a new airfield {{location at}} Fort Sill and established Henry Post Army Airfield (named after 2nd Lt. Henry Post {{who was killed}} in a plane crash in San Diego in 1914). The field occupies a small plateau about a mile south of the main post cantonment area. Construction immediately began on wooden hangars, offices and officer housing. As the U.S. entered World War I, the airfield was used to train <b>aerial</b> <b>observers</b> for the field artillery.|$|R
50|$|On 1 January 1918, Pezon was {{assigned}} to Escadrille 90 as a Spad fighter pilot. On 16 March, {{he was promoted to}} Maréchal-des-logis. On 17 May 1918, he began his campaign against German <b>aerial</b> <b>observers</b> by teaming with Marius Ambrogi to destroy an enemy observation balloon near Juville. Cooperating with Ambrogi, Maurice Bizot, Charles J. V. Macé, and other French pilots, Pezon drove his score as a balloon buster to nine by 29 October 1918; he also downed a German two-seater reconnaissance plane.|$|R
25|$|By Spring 1966, the RLAF {{had grown}} to 40 T-28s. Thai B Team pilots {{continued}} to be crucial to RLAF operation, with 23 arriving in Laos in early 1966. Also, {{in an effort to}} increase the pool of T-28 pilots, the CIA began training several dozen Hmong pilot candidates in Thailand. Seven of them would graduate as T-28 pilots; others would become transport or liaison pilots; a few would become helicopter pilots. Washouts from the program were repurposed as <b>aerial</b> <b>observers,</b> often flying with the Raven FACs.|$|R
500|$|In 1943, {{when he was}} 17, {{he joined}} the Fleet Air Arm of the Royal Navy and became an <b>aerial</b> <b>observer</b> and a {{commissioned}} officer. The war ended before Martin was involved in any combat, and he left the service in 1947. Encouraged by Sidney Harrison (a member of the Committee for the Promotion of New Music) Martin used his veteran's grant to attend the Guildhall School of Music and Drama from 1947 to 1950, where he studied piano and oboe, and {{was interested in the}} music of Rachmaninoff and Ravel, as well as Cole Porter. Martin's oboe teacher was Margaret Eliot (the mother of Jane Asher, who would later become involved with Paul McCartney). [...] After that, Martin explained that he had just picked it up by himself. On 3 January 1948 – while still at the Academy – Martin married Sheena Chisholm, with whom he would have two children, Alexis and Gregory Paul Martin. He later married Judy Lockhart-Smith on 24 June 1966, and they also had two children, Lucie and Giles Martin.|$|E
2500|$|Second Lieutenant Francis James Ralph [...] (9 December 1892 – 3 September 1918) was a British World War I ace {{credited}} with 13 confirmed aerial victories over German fighter aircraft while flying as an <b>aerial</b> <b>observer.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Colonel Dennis Edward Francis Waight [...] (15 February 1895 [...] October 1984) was a British army {{professional}} infantryman. After being decorated for valor {{while serving}} as a fusilier early in World War I, he flew in combat as an <b>aerial</b> <b>observer</b> until war's end. No details of his transfer and training are known; however, he was credited with 12 aerial victories, making him a flying ace.|$|E
50|$|From 1 August - 31 October 1967, 3-319th AFAR {{supported}} Operations Greeley, Boling, and Darby. The battalion fired 46,765 {{rounds in}} 6,425 missions. The brigade Operations Report of Lessons Learned {{for the period}} noted the requirement for <b>aerial</b> <b>observers</b> for artillery in dense jungle, and suggested that new forward observers should have practical training in aerial observation. Both I Field Force Vietnam and US Army Vietnam endorsed this observation. The brigade also noted the effectiveness of artillery fires in close support of units in contact, despite “time consuming” safety requirements.|$|R
50|$|Aviation at Fort Sill added lighter-than-air {{ships to}} its {{inventory}} when Company A, 1st Balloon Squadron, arrived on 5 September 1917 from the Balloon School in Omaha, Nebraska. The company split {{to form the}} 25th and 26th Balloon Companies on 16 February and 2 April 1918. In {{order to meet the}} demand for trained <b>aerial</b> <b>observers</b> for field artillery, a Balloon Corps Training School was set up at Post Field in 1918. During World War I, the school trained 751 officers and created 89 companies, of which 33 were deployed to Europe.|$|R
40|$|Defence {{activities}} in the Great Barrier Reef directly contribute to the training and operations of Australia's defence services and the majority have negligible impacts on the Great Barrier Reef ecosystem. Many defence activities are conducted with dedicated shipboard and <b>aerial</b> <b>observers.</b> These personnel are able {{to collect data on}} marine wildlife sightings, as well as ensure activities are delayed if required. Defence activities undergo thorough assessment, coordination and planning. In addition, the management agreement between the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and Department of Defence ensures a shared understanding of potential threats to Great Barrier Reef values, external influences and key stakeholder issues...|$|R
