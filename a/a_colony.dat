5|$|With {{the defeat}} of Napoleon in 1815, there were calls {{for the return of}} the Portuguese Monarch to Lisbon; the Portuguese Prince Regent enjoyed life in Rio de Janeiro, where the monarchy was at the time more popular and where he enjoyed more freedom, and he was thus unwilling to return to Europe. However, those advocating the return of the Court to Lisbon argued that Brazil was only <b>a</b> <b>colony</b> and that it was not right for Portugal to be governed from <b>a</b> <b>colony.</b> On the other hand, leading Brazilian courtiers pressed for the {{elevation}} of Brazil from the rank of <b>a</b> <b>colony,</b> so that they could enjoy the full status of being nationals of the mother-country. Brazilian nationalists also supported the move, because it indicated that Brazil would no longer be submissive to the interests of Portugal, but would be of equal status within a transatlantic monarchy.|$|E

5|$|At any size, a meat ant nest {{always has}} a {{possibility}} of dying out in any year, but the site may be reoccupied by another colony. Hence, nests can be very old as suggested in one study. Some nests may never be reoccupied for unknown reasons. The regrowth of vegetation which shades the nest, soil damage or even a disease may wipe out <b>a</b> <b>colony</b> and leave the nest site completely abandoned. The death of <b>a</b> <b>colony</b> may be obvious when competing colonies increase in population and size by expanding their territories with well-established satellite nests in order exploit the food sources once used by a former colony. Satellite nests may diverge from their parent nests to become independent, {{as suggested by the}} antagonism of worker ants from different nests or when others are uninhabitable by insecticide treatment. After the eradication of a nest, satellite nests emerge nearby, and may sever their connections with the parent nest. The separation of a satellite nest is an effective way for a nest to exploit food sources, and <b>a</b> <b>colony</b> with less than 11 entrance holes is recognised as non-mature (a nest is mature at 12). As most satellite nests have 11 holes and accept a queen of their own, a satellite nest may easily develop maturity in one year.|$|E

50|$|The {{lifespan}} {{of workers}} varies considerably {{over the year}} in regions with long winters. Workers born in spring and summer will work hard, living only a few weeks, but those born in autumn will remain inside for several months as the colony clusters. On average during the year, about one percent of <b>a</b> <b>colony's</b> worker bees die naturally per day. Except for the queen, all of <b>a</b> <b>colony's</b> workers are replaced about every four months.|$|R
50|$|Badger colonies often utilize several setts: a large main sett {{usually in}} {{the central part of}} <b>a</b> <b>colony's</b> {{territory}} and occupied by most of <b>a</b> <b>colony's</b> members as well as one or more smaller outlier setts. Outlier setts may have only two or three entrances and may be used by a small number of colony members when nearby food sources are in season or in autumn when the main sett is crowded with the year's young.|$|R
5|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that some trees are interconnected through their root system, forming <b>a</b> <b>colony.</b> The interconnections are made by the inosculation process, a kind of natural grafting or welding of vegetal tissues. The tests to demonstrate this networking are performed by injecting chemicals, sometimes radioactive, into a tree, and then checking for its presence in neighbouring trees.|$|E
5|$|La Salle's mission had {{remained}} secret until 1686 when former expedition member Denis Thomas, who had deserted in Santo Domingo, {{was arrested for}} piracy.

Despite his confession, Thomas was hanged.|$|E
5|$|Mated females then seek a {{suitable}} place to begin <b>a</b> <b>colony.</b> There, they break off their wings and begin to lay and care for eggs. The females can selectively fertilise future eggs with the sperm stored to produce diploid workers or lay unfertilized haploid eggs to produce drones. The first workers to hatch are known as nanitics, and are weaker and smaller than later workers, but they begin to serve the colony immediately. They enlarge the nest, forage for food, {{and care for the}} other eggs. Species that have multiple queens may have a queen leaving the nest along with some workers to found <b>a</b> <b>colony</b> at a new site, a process akin to swarming in honeybees.|$|E

5|$|Most colonies are monogyne, {{meaning that}} <b>a</b> <b>colony</b> {{only has a}} single queen, but based on observations, some nests contain {{more than a single}} queen. Some nests are known to contain two queens, with some even having as many as four in a single colony, making them polygynous; a high {{proportion}} of queens living in polygynous nests are unrelated to one another. Some colonies are oligogynous, which means that multiple queens are present in <b>a</b> <b>colony,</b> but they are tolerated by all workers birthed from different queens and treated equally. Tolerance still occurs even when new reproductive females and males are born, but recognition based on kin from queens and workers is known, hinting brood discrimination when the larvae are fed or groomed; queens will only take care of their own brood and neglect to look after broods laid by other queens. The queens, on the other hand, will only cooperate with each other during nest founding, but will be antagonistic once there are workers present in the colony. Queens become more intolerant of each other as the colony grows, and eventually separate within the nest, resulting in the queen laying more eggs. Such cases usually happen when pleometrotic founding occurs, or if a queen ant is adopted by <b>a</b> <b>colony,</b> setting up aggressive relationships. Physical fights between queens in the same colony are rare.|$|E

50|$|S. cyanea starts <b>a</b> new <b>colony</b> cycle {{during the}} spring as it gets warmer. The first stage of <b>a</b> new <b>colony</b> {{is known as the}} pre-emergence state, in which workers have not been produced.

5|$|Nothomyrmecia queens are brachypterous, {{meaning that}} they have stubby {{rudimentary}} wings that render them flightless. This may correlate with population structure, possibly as an adaptation in small populated colonies or by unusual ecological requirements. The alates may begin to emerge in late summer and early autumn (March or April), and colony-founding queens excavate to considerable depths underground; queens start to lay eggs by spring. Queens are univoltine and only produce a single generation of ants annually, and eggs may take 12 months to fully develop. When <b>a</b> <b>colony</b> is mature, only 50 to 100 individuals are present in each nest. In some colonies, colony founding can occur within <b>a</b> <b>colony</b> itself when a queen dies, taken over by one of her daughters. This method of colony founding may render a nest immortal.|$|E

5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} extreme {{examples}} of colonial behavior in rodents are the eusocial naked mole rat and Damaraland mole rat. The naked mole rat lives completely underground and can form colonies of up to 80 individuals. Only one female and up to three males in the colony reproduce, {{while the rest of}} the members are smaller and sterile, and function as workers. Some individuals are of intermediate size. They help with the rearing of the young and can take the place of a reproductive if one dies. The Damaraland mole rat is characterized by having a single reproductively active male and female in <b>a</b> <b>colony</b> where the remaining animals are not truly sterile, but become fertile only if they establish <b>a</b> <b>colony</b> of their own.|$|E

5|$|Termites {{are less}} likely to be {{attacked}} by parasites than bees, wasps and ants, as they are usually well protected in their mounds. Nevertheless, termites are infected by a variety of parasites. Some of these include dipteran flies, Pyemotes mites, and a large number of nematode parasites. Most nematode parasites are in the order Rhabditida; others are in the genus Mermis, Diplogaster aerivora and Harteria gallinarum. Under imminent threat of an attack by parasites, <b>a</b> <b>colony</b> may migrate to a new location. Fungi pathogens such as Aspergillus nomius and Metarhizium anisopliae are, however, major threats to a termite colony as they are not host-specific and may infect large portions of the colony; transmission usually occurs via direct physical contact. M.anispliae is known to weaken the termite immune system. Infection with A.nomius only occurs when <b>a</b> <b>colony</b> is under great stress.|$|E
