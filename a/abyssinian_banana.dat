50|$|Ensete glaucum has a thick, waxy and blue, solitary trunk. It grows {{larger than}} the <b>Abyssinian</b> <b>Banana</b> (Ensete ventricosum).|$|E
50|$|It is easy {{to raise}} from seed. It is an {{extremely}} fast growing banana given heat, but not as hardy as the <b>Abyssinian</b> <b>Banana</b> (Ensete ventricosum), and is not as well known.|$|E
50|$|Ensete ventricosum, {{commonly}} known as the Ethiopian banana, <b>Abyssinian</b> <b>banana,</b> false banana, enset or ensete, is an herbaceous species of flowering plant in the banana family Musaceae. The name Ensete ventricosum was first published in 1948 in the Kew Bulletin, 1947, p. 101. Its synonyms include Musa arnoldiana De Wild., Musa ventricosa Welw. and Musa ensete J.F.Gmel. It is native to {{the eastern edge of the}} Great African Plateau, extending northwards from South Africa through Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Malawi, Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania to Ethiopia, and west to the Congo, being found in high rainfall forests on mountains, and along forested ravines and streams.|$|E
50|$|After {{two years}} in Los Angeles, Franceschi moved to Santa Barbara. There, he and local {{landscape}} architect Charles Frederick Eaton jointly founded the Southern California Acclimatizing Association in 1893 to introduce new species {{from around the world}} to California. It was initially headquartered at Eaton's Montecito estate of Riso Rivo, which became a botanical nursery for their experiments in plant propagation. Eaton planted an enormous variety of both native and non-native trees at Riso Rivo, including live oak, camphor, cinnamon, avocado, <b>Abyssinian</b> <b>banana,</b> candlenut, and many species of citrus and palms. Many kinds of seeds were also grown on the estate in their attempt to determine which were suitable for southern California's Mediterranean climate.|$|E
5000|$|Britt {{is known}} as the father of the {{southern}} Oregon fruit industry. He irrigated his property as early as 1855 and used smudging to fight frost. As an avid horticulturalist, Britt imported plants from [...] "most of the civilized world." [...] He particularly enjoyed growing semi-tropical plants, including palm trees, an <b>Abyssinian</b> <b>banana</b> tree, Smyrna figs and Japanese persimmons. The plants, unsuited to southern Oregon's climate, required exceptional care and in some cases a solarium. In September 1903, Professor A. B. Cordley and Professor E. R. Lake, of the State Agricultural College at Corvallis while in Jacksonville for the fruit-growers convention paid a visit to Britt's home and examined park about the house, and his collection of trees, shrubs, and flowers.|$|E
5000|$|In Montecito, Eaton—a lifelong amateur gardener—developed into a {{landscape}} architect and horticulturalist, {{and the house}} he built for his family, Riso Rivo, featured a lotus pond with a floating Japanese teahouse that gained him national attention. He planted an enormous variety of both native and non-native trees at Riso Rivo, including live oak, camphor, cinnamon, avocado, <b>Abyssinian</b> <b>banana,</b> candlenut, and many species of citrus and palms. Eaton was an early champion of planting trees with strong vertical lines like palms and cypresses to complement the dominant horizontal lines of sky, water, and shore along the California coast. Gustav Stickley, one of the American Arts and Crafts movement's most celebrated designers, praised Eaton's landscape work for its revolt [...] "against the formality, the severe training and repression of Nature which constitute the first principles of the French and Italian systems of landscape gardening".|$|E
