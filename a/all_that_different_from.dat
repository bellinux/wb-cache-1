Optimized milling conditions of previously ground material through the installation of energy-exchange blade devices (EBD) in amill drum have been proposed. It {{was found that the}} level of charge by grinding media in the first chamber periodically varies according to the rotation angle of the mill drum equipped with EBD. There is a "scooping " of the grinding media with a grinding material in the zone of active influence of EBD along, lifting them to a height and enforcing them a cross-longitudinal movement. <b>All</b> <b>that</b> is <b>different</b> <b>from</b> being created in the ball mills without EBD. The additional work is performed, which consumes engine power. Method of calculating anadditional power consumption of the mill drive equipped with EBD was proposed; additional power expended to create cross-longitudinal motion of the grinding mediain the first and second chambers initsareas of activein fluence of EBD.

40|$|The article Theatre in 27 ” Century - Towards New Definitions {{deals with}} the problem of narrow {{understanding}} of theatre art that dominates not only common thought but also the scientific practise of Polish theatrologists. This traditional definition is based on five elements: theatrical illusion, close connection with drama, dramatic character, stage box and space/time community between actors and spectators. During the development of the theatre in 20,h century this distinctive features were disproved by the reformers and experimenters. At the same time such theatre categories as performance, role, stage etc. were widely used to describe "theatre of everyday life". In the last decades of the 20 th century the new field of science - the performance studies - emerged. The reaction of the theatrology was one of defending the traditional borders and neglecting <b>all</b> <b>that</b> was <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the conventional theatre by calling it "paratheatrical" or "alternative". In the author's opinion this notion is false and causes real losses for the discipline, so he proposes to open the borders of theatrology by taking different activities into account. But it doesn't mean the full acceptation of performance studies' terminology and point of view, because there is a danger of substituting the term "theatre" by the wider term "performance". And the difference between one and the other seems to be important, because the theatre is a kind of consciously created performance which is marked as such. The ways and methods of this marking depend on the cultural and historical context, so they change in space and time. Only the exact act of marking is universal. It means, that in the scientific practise there is no universal group of definite "theatre factors". The definitions of theatre are always to be reached and that's why "towards" is the most important word in the article's title...|$|R
2500|$|Although the {{simplest}} reflexes may be mediated by circuits lying entirely within the spinal cord, more complex responses rely on signal processing in the brain. For example, when {{an object in}} {{the periphery of the}} visual field moves, and a person looks toward it many stages of signal processing are initiated. [...] The initial sensory response, in the retina of the eye, and the final motor response, in the oculomotor nuclei of the brain stem, are not <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> those in a simple reflex, but the intermediate stages are completely different. [...] Instead of a one or two step chain of processing, the visual signals pass through perhaps a dozen stages of integration, involving the thalamus, cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, superior colliculus, cerebellum, and several brainstem nuclei. [...] These areas perform signal-processing functions that include feature detection, perceptual analysis, memory recall, decision-making, and motor planning.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the conditions under}} which periodic solutions of the nonlinear oscillator (x) over bar + x(3) = 0 persist when the differential equation is perturbed so as to become (x) over bar + x(3) + ax(3) cos t + yx = 0. For any frequency omega, there exists a threshold for the damping coefficient gamma, above which there is no periodic orbit with period 2 pi/omega. We conjecture that this threshold is infinitesimal in the perturbation parameter, with integer order depending on the frequency omega. Some rigorous analytical results towards the proof of this conjecture are given: these results would provide a complete proof if we could {{rule out the possibility that}} other periodic solutions arise besides subharmonic solutions. Moreover the relative size and shape of the basins of attraction of the existing stable periodic orbits are investigated numerically, showing <b>that</b> <b>all</b> attractors <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the origin are subharmonic solutions and hence giving further support to the validity of the conjecture. The method we use is <b>different</b> <b>from</b> those usually applied in bifurcation theory, such as Mel'nikov's method or that of Chow and Hale, and allows us to investigate situations in which the non-degeneracy assumptions on the perturbation are violate...|$|R
30|$|The P 3 b {{paradigm}} {{was designed}} {{in order to}} test the best features of a target place to be recognized in a virtual ambient reproducing a real house. We selected the bathroom door as target stimulus, for its presence in all houses and health facilities, where an elderly subject could have difficulty in moving toward this room essential for daily living abilities. In the virtual environment, that simulates a home, <b>all</b> rooms <b>that</b> were <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the bathroom were identified as frequent stimuli (F) while the rare stimulus was assigned to the bathroom room itself. To differentiate the target stimulus from the frequent ones, and to understand the better features for target room doors recognition, bathroom doors were semi-opened, in order to allow the recognition of the typical furniture. In addition, different color and luminous conditions, easily obtained in the real ambient from a remote home automation control, were applied. Bathroom doors were illuminated in white, like the other non-target doors (W), or colored with a green (G) or red spotlight (Fig.  2). Subjects were informed that they would perform a virtual walking through an apartment, looking for the bathroom door, and were requested to press a button as soon as the bathroom door appeared in the field of view. To make the experiment easier, navigation inside the environment was automatically controlled and with a fixed duration; in this way, rare and frequent stimuli were proposed in succession and in a controlled number. In order to examine the best bathroom position for being recognized within the virtual house, three different Virtual Environments (VE) were depicted, as the bathroom was designed in the aisle (A), living room (L) and bedroom (B). Each VE constitutes a single block (Fig.  1), where each block included 30 rare stimuli (10 for each color spotlight) and 120 frequent ones (all other rooms doors). Thanks to the anchors inserted in VE, the system computed random virtual paths that, alternatively, started from the bathroom, end up to another place of the house and vice versa, {{in order to have a}} rare stimulus followed by a certain number of frequent ones.|$|R
