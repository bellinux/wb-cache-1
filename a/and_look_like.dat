In clathrate structures, gases are enclosed in an icy cage <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> packed snow. These structures form at the high-pressure depths of Lake Vostok and would become unstable if brought to the surface.|$|E
25|$|Two dual {{solutions}} {{are related to}} the 5-cell, two dual {{solutions are}} related to the 24-cell, and an infinite set of self-dual duoprisms generate regular skew polyhedra as {4, 4 | n}. In the infinite limit these approach a duocylinder <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a torus in their stereographic projections into 3-space.|$|E
25|$|Another type is {{turkey oak}} manna, also called Persian gezengevi- gezo, men, Turkish Kudret helvasi, man-es-simma, also Diarbekir manna, or Kurdish manna. It is formed by aphids and appears white. It was common in western Iran, {{northern}} Iraq and eastern Turkey. When dried it forms into crystalline lumps which are hard <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> stone. They are pounded before inclusion in breads.|$|E

25|$|Painting is a Painting is a Painting, 14/11/11 – 12/11/12. The ninth exhibition, {{presented}} three {{artists who}} all playfully question what constitutes 'a painting'. John M Armleder (CH), Rashid Johnson (USA) & Dirk Skreber (D) come from very different backgrounds, working visually, conceptually, even ideologically very differently, but all challenge our expectations {{of what a}} painting can, feel <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>like.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{well known}} {{response}} of cephalopods when threatened is to release {{large volumes of}} ink. Some cephalopods also release pseudomorphs ("false bodies"); smaller clouds of ink with a greater mucus content, which allows them to hold their shape for longer. These are expelled slightly away from the cephalopod; they are roughly the same volume <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> the cephalopod that released them. Predators have often been seen attacking a pseudomorph, allowing the cephalopod to escape.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms {{of potato}} 'ring rot' are {{yellowing}} {{of the leaf}} margins which later turn brown <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> they are burned. Tubers rot from the inside, sometimes progressing to leave hollow shells. Rotting of the tubers is the more common symptom. Infected land cannot be used again for susceptible crops for several years. Among others, USA, Canada, many EU states and Middle Eastern countries {{have not yet been}} able to eradicate this pathogen.|$|E

500|$|String hoppers, {{which are}} made of rice flour <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> knitted {{vermicelli}} neatly laid out in circular pieces about [...] in diameter, are frequently combined with tomato sothi (a soup) and curries for breakfast and dinner. Another common item is puttu, a granular, dry, but soft steamed rice powder cooked in a bamboo cylinder with the base wrapped in cloth so that the bamboo flute can be set upright over a clay pot of boiling water. This can be transformed into varieties such as ragi, spinach, and tapioca puttu. There are also sweet and savoury puttus. Another popular breakfast or dinner dish is Appam, a thin crusty pancake made with rice flour, with a round soft crust in the middle. It has variations such as egg or milk Appam.|$|E
500|$|Boulter {{starred in}} two films in 2008, Daylight Robbery by filmmaker Paris Leonti, and Donkey Punch {{directed}} by Olly Blackburn. Boulter portrayed a character named [...] "Sean" [...] in Donkey Punch, who tags along with character [...] "Josh" [...] as the [...] "quiet brother ... who hits {{it off with}} Tammi". Boulter guest starred on a two-part episode arc [...] "Wounds" [...] in May 2008 of the television series Waking the Dead as character [...] "Jimmy Dearden". He appeared on the television series Survivors as [...] "Neil" [...] in November 2008. He had a recurring role in ten episodes of the television series Casualty in 2010, as [...] "Kieron Fletcher". He portrayed an emergency physician applying for a medical fellowship. He commented on the inherent difficulties in portraying a physician on television: [...] "Playing a doctor is a strange experience. Pretending you know what you're talking about when you don't is very bizarre but there are advisers on set who are fantastic at taking you through procedures and giving you the confidence to stand there <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> you know what you're doing." [...] Boulter starred in the 2011 film Mercenaries directed by Paris Leonti.|$|E

500|$|Messick {{said they}} {{designed}} [...] "a fairy tale, mythological fantasy world" [...] {{that feels like}} it happened long time ago but is not set in any particular time period. Marlene Stewart created the film's costumes, using traditional leather and linen but without an antique look. Its steampunk-like, retro-futuristic weapons were created by the weapon designer Simon Boucherie and Wirkola, who said they wanted Hansel and Gretel's weapons {{to look as if}} the characters hand-made them. Wirkola stated he [...] "just wanted this crazy, mashed-up world where you can’t pinpoint where it is, or when it is" [...] and the modern elements are there to [...] "add to the fun and tone of the film." [...] He said, [...] "We wanted the movie to feel timeless and for the movie to feel like a fairy tale, but still grounded. It {{was a lot of fun}} coming up with the different weapon designs and ways of killing witches. We mixed old and new elements. But no matter how modern some of the weapons are, they all have an old-fashioned feel <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> they could fit into this world." ...|$|E
500|$|Gold's {{plan was}} to set a fire at the Mayor's office with Emma there, knowing her {{conscience}} would force her to save Regina <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a hero. This goes off perfectly, making Emma the town favorite going into the debate. When she finds out that Gold did this, Emma realizes Henry might be right about evil not playing by the rules. At the debate, Sidney explains what would make him the best sheriff following Regina's script to the letter. Emma reveals {{to the public that}} Gold set the fire, demonstrating her own honesty and integrity as well as Gold's ruthlessness. Later that evening at Granny's Cafe, Emma consoles herself with liquor when Henry walks in with the walkie talkies, saying that he was proud of her and they might continue [...] "Operation Cobra." [...] Regina, Archie (Raphael Sbarge), Mary Margaret (Ginnifer Goodwin) and Sidney arrive to tell Emma she was elected Sheriff. Regina gives her the badge and admits they have one thing in common: their distrust of Gold. Emma receives a visit from her new ally who reveals the rest of his plan. Gold knew Emma would {{do the right thing and}} tell everyone what he did, winning her the election. He also tells her that while the town feared Regina, they feared him more. In standing up to him, Emma became even more compelling to the townsfolk than when she rescued Regina. Now that Emma is Sheriff, Gold expects to be paid back for his favors.|$|E
500|$|New York magazine's Amy Odell {{commented that}} [...] "The {{intricacy}} of her [...] wardrobe [...] suggests she's feeling the Gaga pressure." [...] She further added: [...] "In a burgeoning phenomenon {{we might call}} the Gaga Effect, divas everywhere may feel the pressure to push avant-garde fashion to the max {{to keep up with}} the pantsless wonder. Beyoncé's fashion efforts in 'Video Phone'— which make her epic diva money fan a mere distant memory— deserve a look-by-look analysis, because she tried really hard." [...] In another review, she said [...] "Together they play with colored fire-spitting water guns <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> the best of diva friends." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Leah Greenblatt commented that the video was [...] "B's show—La Gaga's just guesting in it." [...] Greenblatt also praised the fashion designs used in the video and the Bettie Page [...] "vibes". Spins Chris Zakorchemny felt that Gaga [...] "does her best Beyonce impression" [...] in the video for the song. However, he said that [...] "Even with Gaga involved, the Hype Williams-produced video doesn't veer too much into the weird; it's certainly not Gaga-setting-men-on-fire weird." [...] Margaret Wappler of The Arizona Republic praised the video saying that it had [...] "electrifying color schemes and high-shine lighting, resulting in a fantastical pop mirage between Lady Gaga and Beyonce". She further called it a [...] "kinetic spectacle to behold, with enough guns to make Ted Nugent weep with jealousy and some hot Bettie Page bangs on Beyonce that should prompt plenty of ladies to run to the hairdresser". Wappler finished her review by concluding that [...] "the whole video has a distinct and not unpleasant 90s vibe." [...] Francesca Stabile of The Village Voice gave a positive review for the video praising the outfits used in the video and the [...] "oversized sequined sweater that makes an appearance toward the end".|$|E

2500|$|There are {{two types}} of plates, (standard and mini) {{designed}} specifically to look like European registration plates, called Euro plates. The standard Euro plates, introduced in 2005 are [...] wide and [...] high and the mini ones are [...] wide and [...] high. Euro plates have a blue section to the left containing [...] "Vic" [...] vertically above a Victorian Southern Cross, and in the main section contain the letter [...] "V", a full-coloured Victorian coat of arms, and two letters, a space and three numbers (V aa-nnn). These plates use the FE-Schrift font <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> German plates. The general series range from VAA-000 to VZZ-999 are reserved for Euro plates.|$|E
2500|$|When {{methylene}} blue is [...] "polychromed" [...] (oxidized in solution or [...] "ripened" [...] by fungal metabolism, as originally {{noted in the}} thesis of Dr. D. L. Romanowsky in 1890s), it gets serially demethylated and forms all the tri-, di-, mono- and non-methyl intermediates, which are Azure B, Azure A, Azure C, and thionine, respectively. This {{is the basis of}} the basophilic part of the spectrum of Romanowski-Giemsa effect. If only synthetic Azure B and Eosin Y is used, it may serve as a standardized Giemsa stain; but, without {{methylene blue}}, the normal neutrophilic granules tend to overstain <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> toxic granules. On the other hand, if methylene blue is used it might help to give the normal look of neutrophil granules and may also enhance the staining of nucleoli and polychromatophilic RBCs (reticulocytes).|$|E
