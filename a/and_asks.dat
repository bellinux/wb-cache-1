40|$|The {{requirement}} of CUL 1 for Arabidopsis embryogenesis suggests that Skp 1 –CUL 1 –F-box protein (SCF) complexes play important roles during embryo development. Among the 21 Arabidopsis Skp 1 -like genes (ASKs), {{it is unknown}} which ASK gene(s) is essential for embryo development. In this study, we demonstrate a vital role for <b>ASK</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>ASK</b> 2 in Arabidopsis embryogenesis and postembryonic development through analysis of the ask 1 ask 2 double mutant. Our detailed analysis indicates that the double mutations in both <b>ASK</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>ASK</b> 2 affect cell division and cell expansion/elongation and cause a developmental delay during embryogenesis and lethality in seedling growth. The expression patterns of <b>ASK</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>ASK</b> 2 were examined further and found {{to be consistent with}} their roles in embryogenesis and seedling development. We propose that mutations in <b>ASK</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>ASK</b> 2 abolish all of the <b>ASK</b> 1 - <b>and</b> <b>ASK</b> 2 -based SCF and non-SCF complexes, resulting in alteration of gene expression and leading to defects in growth and development...|$|R
