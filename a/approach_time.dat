5000|$|The Wheeler-DeWitt {{equation}} {{is a field}} equation. It {{is part of a}} theory that attempts to combine mathematically the ideas of quantum mechanics and general relativity, a step toward a theory of quantum gravity. In this <b>approach,</b> <b>time</b> plays no role in the equation, leading to the problem of time. More specifically, the equation describes the quantum version of the Hamiltonian constraint using metric variables. Its commutation relations with the diffeomorphism constraints generate the Bergmann-Komar [...] "group" [...] (which is the diffeomorphism group on-shell, but differs off-shell).|$|E

50|$|In {{the case}} where all the {{neighbouring}} trajectories approach the limit cycle as <b>time</b> <b>approaches</b> infinity, it is called a stable or attractive limit cycle (ω-limit cycle). If instead all neighbouring trajectories <b>approach</b> it as <b>time</b> <b>approaches</b> negative infinity, then it is an unstable limit cycle (α-limit cycle). If there is a neighbouring trajectory which spirals into the limit cycle as <b>time</b> <b>approaches</b> infinity, and another one which spirals into it as <b>time</b> <b>approaches</b> negative infinity, then it is a semi-stable limit cycle. There are also limit cycles which are neither stable, unstable nor semi-stable: for instance, a neighboring trajectory may approach the limit cycle from the outside, but {{the inside of the}} limit cycle is approached by a family of other cycles (which wouldn't be limit cycles).|$|R

50|$|The female seaweed crab lays fertilized {{eggs from}} which larvae develop and break free. The eggs are bright orange when freshly laid and turn brown as they <b>approach</b> <b>time</b> to hatch, and are {{approximately}} 0.75mm across. There are multiple {{stages of the}} larva before they reach maturity including pre-zoea, zoea 1, zoea 2, and megalopa. When the larva hatches it is enclosed in a thin and transparent covering that is shed shortly after. Then this comes the first zoea stage during which the larva is about 3.0mm. Zoea 1 lasts 8-16 days before the exoskeleton of the larva is shed and it enters zoea 2. At zoea 2 the larva is about 3.5mm long. The larva transforms into megalopa after 12-15 days at a temperature of 16 degrees Celsius. After 20 days, the megalopa larva moults into a juvenile crab. They shed their shells every few months in order to grow, and will grow faster if they live in warmer water. Seaweed crabs typically grow to 5cm across and live for approximately two years.|$|E

Our problem formulation is motivated by scenarios involving autonomous vehicles circulating on arterial roads with intelligent management at traffic intersections. We propose a provably correct distributed control algorithm that ensures that the vehicles satisfy the finite-time specifications under speed limits, acceleration saturation, and safety requirements. The safety specifications are such that collisions can be avoided even in cases of communication failure. We also discuss how the proposed distributed algorithm can be integrated with an intelligent intersection manager {{to provide information about}} the feasible approach times of the vehicle string and a guaranteed bound of its time of occupancy of the intersection.

40|$|M. Phil. The central {{research}} problem {{of this study}} asks whether principle-based time management can increase quality of life? The second question, which arises, is what the underlying principles of quality of life creating time management would be? These principles were identified by {{looking at some of}} the most common time management problems. The principles are being proactive, living according to values, setting goals, acquiring self-knowledge and being motivated by importance rather than urgency. Quality of life can be defined as living, loving, learning and leaving a legacy. Principles are objective, universal, fundamental, primary truths that cannot be reduced to something more basic. Time management can be characterised as the process by which time is applied effectively to gain a return on the investment thereof in the form enhanced quality of life. Eight <b>approaches</b> to <b>time</b> management found in literature were fathomed to discover what their contribution to time management, strengths and weaknesses were. It could clearly be seen that utilising any of these methods in isolation would certainly lead to an ultimate decline in quality of life. Thus, a higher level <b>approach</b> to <b>time</b> management had to be found. Two higher level <b>approaches</b> to <b>time</b> management are found in the literature. A new <b>approach</b> to principle-based <b>time</b> management called the Journey approach was synthesised by interweaving current <b>approaches</b> to <b>time</b> management, with quality of life producing principles from a Personal and Professional Leadership perspective. The Journey metaphor was used to arrive at the following steps for a principle-based <b>approach</b> to <b>time</b> management: 1) Set life goals. 2) Gain self-knowledge. 3) Align your perception of reality with universal principles. 4) Set medium term gaols. 5) Make action plans. 6) Act according to the plan. Finally some guidelines for a course on principle-based time management are given...|$|R
