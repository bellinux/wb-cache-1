5|$|There are two {{hypotheses}} {{about the origin}} of mitochondria: endosymbiotic and <b>autogenous.</b> The endosymbiotic hypothesis suggests that mitochondria were originally prokaryotic cells, capable of implementing oxidative mechanisms that were not possible for eukaryotic cells; they became endosymbionts living inside the eukaryote. In the <b>autogenous</b> hypothesis, mitochondria were born by splitting off a portion of DNA from the nucleus of the eukaryotic cell at the time of divergence with the prokaryotes; this DNA portion would have been enclosed by membranes, which could not be crossed by proteins. Since mitochondria have many features in common with bacteria, the endosymbiotic hypothesis is more widely accepted.|$|E
5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} {{arc welding}} (GTAW), {{also known as}} tungsten inert gas (TIG) welding, is an arc welding process that uses a non-consumable tungsten electrode to produce the weld. The weld area and electrode is protected from oxidation or other atmospheric contamination by an inert shielding gas (argon or helium), and a filler metal is normally used, though some welds, known as <b>autogenous</b> welds, do not require it. A constant-current welding power supply produces electrical energy, which is conducted across the arc through a column of highly ionized gas and metal vapors known as a plasma.|$|E
25|$|With a {{contralateral}} (opposite side) <b>autogenous</b> patellar tendon graft, the graft {{includes the}} middle {{section of the}} patellar tendon along with two attached bone plugs one on each end. The contralateral <b>autogenous</b> patellar tendon graft is rarely used as primary revision due to the concern of donor site morbidity. Instead it is primarily considered when a patient is opposed to using an allograft but has already undergone an ACL revision using the ipsilateral patellar tendon. In addition, there are many health care settings around the nation where readily available, safe, and cost effective allograft tissues are not obtainable. In this situation the contralateral <b>autogenous</b> Patellar tendon graft {{may be the best}} option.|$|E
25|$|Control {{of swine}} {{influenza}} by vaccination {{has become more}} difficult in recent decades, as {{the evolution of the}} virus has resulted in inconsistent responses to traditional vaccines. Standard commercial swine flu vaccines are effective in controlling the infection when the virus strains match enough to have significant cross-protection, and custom (<b>autogenous)</b> vaccines made from the specific viruses isolated are created and used in the more difficult cases.|$|E
25|$|After mastectomy, {{surgical}} breast reconstruction with <b>autogenous</b> skin flaps {{and with}} breast implants can produce subtle deformities and deficiencies resultant from such global breast augmentation, thus the breast reconstruction is incomplete. In which case, fat graft injection {{can provide the}} missing coverage and fullness, and might relax the breast capsule. The fat can be injected as either large grafts or as small grafts, as required to correct difficult axillary deficiencies, improper breast contour, visible implant edges, capsular contracture, and tissue damage consequent to radiation therapy.|$|E
25|$|When {{a female}} reproduces without such {{parasitic}} meals, {{it is said}} to practice <b>autogenous</b> reproduction, as in Toxorhynchites; otherwise, the reproduction may be termed anautogenous, as occurs in mosquito species that serve as disease vectors, particularly Anopheles and {{some of the most important}} disease vectors in the genus Aedes. In contrast, some mosquitoes, for example, many Culex, are partially anautogenous: they do not need a blood meal for their first cycle of egg production, which they produce autogenously; however, subsequent clutches of eggs are produced anautogenously, at which point their disease vectoring activity becomes operative.|$|E
25|$|The {{hemolymph}} toxins {{originate from}} <b>autogenous</b> de novo biosynthesis by the Chrysomelina beetle. Essential amino acids as valine serve as precursors {{for the production}} of the hemolymph toxins of Chrysomelina leaf beetles. The degradation of such essential amino acids provides propanoyl-CoA. This compound is further transformed into propanoic acid and β-alanine. The amino group in β-alanine is then oxidized to yield either an oxime or the nitro-toxin 3-nitropropanoic acid (3-NPA). The oxime is cyclized to isoxazolin-5-one, which is transformed with α-UDP-glucose into the isoxazolin-5-one glucoside. In a final step, an ester is formed by transesterification of 3-nitropropanoyl-CoA to the 6´-position of isoxazolin-5-one glucoside. This biosynthetic route yields high millimolar concentrations of the secondary isoxazolin-5-one and 3-NPA derived metabolites. Free 3-NPA and glucosides that derive from 3-NPA and isoxazolin-5-one also occur in many genera of leguminous plants (Fabaceae).|$|E
25|$|In the past, spherical nonporous {{implants}} {{were placed}} in the intraconal space and the extraocular muscles were either left unattached or were tied over the implant. Wrapping these implants allows attachment of the muscles to the covering material, a technique that seems to improve implant movement and reduce the incidence of implant migration. Porous implants may be saturated with antibiotic solution before insertion. Because the brittle nature of hydroxyapatite prevents direct suturing of the muscles to the implant, these implants are usually covered with some form of wrapping material. The muscles are attached to the implant in a technique similar to that used for spherical non-porous implants. The muscles may be directly sutured to porous polyethylene implants either by passing the suture through the implant material or by using an implant with fabricated suture tunnels. Some surgeons also wrap porous polyethylene implants either to facilitate muscle attachment or {{to reduce the risk of}} implant exposure. A variety of wrapping materials have been used to cover porous implants, including polyglactin or polyglycolic acid mesh, heterologous tissue (bovine pericardium), homologous donor tissue (sclera, dermis), and <b>autogenous</b> tissue (fascia lata, temporalis fascia, posterior auricular muscle, rectus abdominis sheath).|$|E

2500|$|However, {{for other}} cancers such as acute myeloid leukemia, the reduced {{mortality}} of the <b>autogenous</b> relative to allogeneic HSCT may be outweighed by an increased likelihood of cancer relapse and related mortality, {{and therefore the}} allogeneic treatment may be preferred for those conditions.|$|E
2500|$|In 2007-2009 279 {{patients}} underwent primary ACL reconstruction surgery {{with the}} use of the contralateral <b>autogenous</b> patellar tendon graft while 58 control patients had the same surgery but with an ipsilateral patellar tendon. [...] When it came comparing the quadriceps muscles to the pre-operative baseline test those who used the contralateral patellar tendon graft had significantly more strength in the ACL reconstruction leg and this held true in the 2 year follow up measurements as well. The study concluded that the use of the contralateral patellar tendon graft does not leave the patient with unresolved donor-site strength loss.|$|E
60|$|There {{could be}} but one answer, he thought. Brought {{to the test}} of action, he did not really believe in God! He {{did not believe in}} God as he {{believed}} in his family. He did not believe in the reality of either his first or his second vision; they had been dreams, <b>autogenous</b> revelations, exaltations of his own imaginations. These beliefs were upon different grades of reality. Put to the test, his faith in God gave way; a sword of plaster against a reality of steel.|$|E
