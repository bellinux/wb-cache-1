Pate following the Ribbon Creek incident, which involved the accidental drowning of six recruits during a training march. As Marine leaders were investigating, they favored Shoup's recommendation of not covering up the incident. He supported <b>an</b> <b>overhaul</b> <b>of</b> recruit training for the Marine Corps in response.|$|E
5|$|As {{construction}} {{of schools and}} hiring of teachers continued in Ravalomanana's second term, additional measures were adopted to improve education quality, including a shift to Malagasy as the language of instruction in grades one to five, expansion of primary schools to house grades six and seven for greater access to lower secondary schooling and <b>an</b> <b>overhaul</b> <b>of</b> the national curriculum, which had been modified piecemeal since independence from France in 1960. In the Constitution of 2007, English was added to Malagasy and French as an official language, in reflection of Ravalomanana's goal to increase Madagascar's participation in the global market.|$|E

Along {{with the change}} of operator and stock, the Norwegian National Rail Administration, who owns the stations and tracks, did <b>an</b> <b>overhaul</b> <b>of</b> maintenance {{on many of the}} stations, in particular removing years of vandalism. In August, the company did a minor upgrade to the trains. The quiet sections were doubled from one to two sections, and new window shades for NOK 650,000 were purchased. By August, the ridership on the Gjøvik Line had increased by 8%, compared to the previous year.|$|E
5|$|Henry's {{break with}} Rome {{incurred}} {{the threat of}} a large-scale French or Spanish invasion. To guard against this, in 1538, he began to build a chain of expensive, state-of-the-art defences, along Britain's southern and eastern coasts from Kent to Cornwall, largely built of material gained from the demolition of the monasteries. These were known as Henry VIII's Device Forts. He also strengthened existing coastal defence fortresses such as Dover Castle and, at Dover, Moat Bulwark and Archcliffe Fort, which he personally visited for a few months to supervise. Wolsey had many years before conducted the censuses required for <b>an</b> <b>overhaul</b> <b>of</b> the system of militia, but no reform resulted. In 1538–39, Cromwell overhauled the shire musters, but his work mainly served to demonstrate how inadequate they were in organisation. The building works, including that at Berwick, along with the reform of the militias and musters, were eventually finished under Queen Mary.|$|E
5|$|Melbournes {{first major}} refit started in December 1967 and {{continued}} until February 1969, {{during which she}} was upgraded to operate S-2 Tracker and A-4 Skyhawk aircraft.

Air conditioning systems and a liquid oxygen generation plant were also installed. Melbourne re-entered service {{at the conclusion of}} the refits on 14 February, and performed sea trials in Jervis Bay from 17 February until 5 May.

5|$|Stelmach's premiership {{was heavily}} focused on {{management}} of the province's oil reserves, especially those of the Athabasca Oil Sands. He rejected calls from environmentalists to slow the pace of development in the Fort McMurray area, and similarly opposed calls for carbon taxes. Other policy initiatives included commencing <b>an</b> <b>overhaul</b> <b>of</b> the province's health governance system, amendments to the Alberta human rights code, a re-introduction of all-party committees to the Legislature, and {{the conclusion of a}} major labour agreement with Alberta's teachers. His government also attracted controversy for awarding itself a 30% pay increase shortly after its re-election, and featured strained relations with Calgary, one of Klein's former strongholds. Despite this, Stelmach increased the Progressive Conservatives' already substantial majority in the 2008 election. With the advent of the late-2000s recession, Stelmach had to cope with a deteriorating economic situation and the Alberta government's first budget deficit in 16 years.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, the NFL {{established}} the Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Committee (MTBI), which was later {{replaced by the}} Head, Neck and Spine Committee, to study concussions and brain injuries in professional football players. The committee and its leadership, including Ira Casson and Elliot Pellman, were criticized by former players for stating {{that there is not}} enough research to determine if concussions lead to permanent brain injury. Pellman, who served as chairman of the committee from 1994 to 2007, received a large amount of criticism because {{he did not have a}} background in neurology and the research he published on brain injuries disagreed with the findings of independent scientists. In 2009, a NFL-commissioned report showed increased incidence of diagnosis of memory loss and dementia among retired professional football players when compared to the general population. The study also indicated that these symptoms were related to the effects of concussions. However, the NFL and the report's own researchers questioned the reliability of some of the data-gathering methods employed by the study, including the fact that the study was conducted by phone. The same year, the committee acknowledged for the first time that concussions can lead to long-term brain injuries. A Congressional hearing in October 2009, as well as pressure from the National Football League Players Association (NFLPA), led to <b>an</b> <b>overhaul</b> <b>of</b> the concussion policy in November and December of that year.|$|E
