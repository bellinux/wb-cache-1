500|$|... "Boy Oh Boy" [...] is a 90s–influenced electropop {{song with}} dancehall and reggae elements. Regarding its style, Stan confessed, [...] "I want to release what I like {{and not to}} follow the trend and speed up the {{creation}} process just because {{something needs to be}} released. [...] is a mixture of [...] styles. I would say it is a more '90s track but with a contemporary feel". On another occasion, the singer described the single as an [...] "old kind of style, but a new style. It's like eurodance." [...] According to her, the lyrical message is [...] " [...] of expressing the girls' need to be loved [...] <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>you</b> just need to tell to the guy, 'tell me that you love me'". Jonathan Currinn from CelebMix noted, [...] "As for the meaning behind the song, the lyrics suggest a relationship where a guy is always breaking her heart even though she knows that he actually cares for her.

It was first {{recorded}} by American pop singer Katy Perry, recording the track as a demo for her debut album One of the Boys, though it was never fully executed for the album and was passed to Cyrus, on whose version Perry sings backing vocals, soon after a leaked version of Katy Perry on the Internet. Perry discussed her role with Bliss magazine: [...] "My vocals are actually on Breakout. I thought, 'Yes, I'm singing on a Miley single'." [...] Cyrus said naming the album Breakout {{was influenced by the}} song as it was [...] "one of [...] favorite songs" [...] on the album; this was because the song is feminine but has appeals to different age groups: [...] "Moms, dads, sisters, brothers can, you know, relate to it. And it's basically because you just {{want to go out and}} have fun with your friends <b>and</b> <b>sometimes,</b> <b>you</b> know, go out dancing and let loose once in a while." ...|$|E

I always want to redo it five minutes after I'm done with it. That goes down to songwriting too - it's never going to be perfect. Nothing's perfect. So yeah, I went in and did all the solos for that album in a day. I just sat down with a six pack of beer with Kerry and Terry Date. They just let me do my own thing. Tom came in after I had been messing around with a solo for a half an hour and he told me the first take was perfect.

500|$|According to Swift, [...] "Back to December" [...] is {{an apology}} to a past lover {{in the form}} of a song, {{something}} that she has never done before. She continued, [...] "I've never felt the need to apologize in a song before. But in the last two years I've experienced a lot, [...] a lot of different kinds of learning lessons. <b>And</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>you</b> learn a lesson too late and at that point you need to apologize because you were careless." [...] Critics have speculated that the song is Swift's apology to her ex-boyfriend, The Twilight Saga actor Taylor Lautner, due, in part, to the lyrics [...] "your tan skin, your sweet smile", as well as the hidden lyrics in the booklet, which spelled out [...] "TAY." [...] Lautner confirmed these rumors while promoting the TV series Scream Queens in 2016. [...] "Back to December" [...] was first released as a promotional single from Speak Now on October 12, 2010 as a part of the exclusive campaign by the iTunes Store leading up to the album's release. [...] On November 15, 2010, the song was released as the second single from Speak Now.|$|E

The lyrics of [...] "Irreplaceable" [...] concern the breakdown of a woman's relationship with her boyfriend after she discovers his infidelity, and the song [...] "sounds {{a lot like a}} statement of independence". Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe wrote, [...] "With a heretofore unknown grasp of nuance, Beyonce combines heartache, bravado, and anger as she tells a cad he's far from irreplaceable—and that, in fact, her new man will be arriving momentarily." [...] Hermansen said that [...] "Irreplaceable" [...] is a song that [...] "people {{from all walks of life}} can enjoy". Beyoncé said that the song is [...] "a little honest", and, [...] "... basically we can't forget our power and our worth.

The character also came about when the band began writing about their hatred for life in Los Angeles. Vocalist Ryan Key, in discussion of the character, said, [...] "Holly became this person on the record who appears {{in a lot of the}} songs, and at times you love her and at times you hate her.

[...] Violinist Sean Mackin, also in discussion of the character, said: [...] "...Ryan didn’t have a romantic interest in his life and he didn’t want to write 'Only One' again, and he wanted to create something new. A lot of songwriters narrate and create fictional characters... and Holly was a character where sometimes you love her <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>you</b> hate her, and she was someone he could get all his emotions out through."

500|$|McKidd has {{referred}} to his character and the character of Cristina Yang as [...] "soulmates." [...] Speaking of Owen's PTSD storyline, McKidd stated: [...] "What's exciting about telling this story with this character is that it's quite brave of ABC and Shonda , on a prime-time network TV show, to address a tough subject, and one that people don't necessarily want to hear about. [...] But so far the writing room is handling it beautifully. They're not banging people {{over the head with}} it but exploring it in a sensitive and interesting way." [...] Owen and Cristina have struggled with their fictional relationship in season eight, leading to Owen having a sexual affair. Directly before the episode involving the affair aired, McKidd said to Entertainment Weekly: [...] "The thing about Owen is that he tries to do things perfectly, and obviously, he messes up as the chief because you have to make these odd black-and-white decisions <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>you</b> make the wrong decision. There’s a lot of stress in his life at the moment, so he’s trying not to let that affect his efficiency as chief." [...] Although the characters' marriage is tested, McKidd reported to The Hollywood Reporter: [...] "I think they're meant for each other. I hold out faith in Cristina and Owen, even though they go to the darkest places out of all the couples on the show. It's going to get worse but it's going to get better soon." ...|$|E
500|$|With three races {{remaining}} in the Championship and a fourteen-point advantage, Webber said he would continue his pursuit of the title; [...] "I need to keep racing hard and going for victories. Clearly, if my rivals have a rough weekend {{it makes it a}} bit harder for them and it gives me a bit more scope, but I'm not looking to abuse that because it can all go pear-shaped very fast." [...] Vettel said his season had been fraught with car problems but he remained positive about his chances; [...] "I think it's normal to have ups and downs – <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>you</b> have more, sometimes less – but, as I said, the expectation was probably {{to be in a position}} to fight for the championship and I think we're in a very strong and very good position." [...] Alonso urged his teammate Massa to help him in his title bid and said the Korean Grand Prix could become [...] "decisive" [...] for his championship rivals. He favoured Hamilton to win the Korean Grand Prix. With Hamilton twenty-eight points behind Webber and with Button a further three points behind his teammate, McLaren's team principal Martin Whitmarsh said his drivers would keep their focus in the season's remaining three races and produce consistent performances. Karun Chandhok, who raced for Hispania in the first ten races of the season, said Red Bull were the favourites to win, and that he thought the circuit's three long straights would suit the McLaren cars.|$|E

500|$|There was {{a strong}} and varied {{reaction}} to the episode by reviewers. Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone described it as [...] "an emotional rollercoaster that at times may have been jarring or heavy-handed, but overall did what a winter finale should: gave us plenty of surprises, while setting things up for the future". IGN's Robert Canning was [...] "won over by a powerfully acted and directed story" [...] and gave the episode a [...] "great" [...] rating of 8.0 out of 10; he noted that [...] "as is often the case, the smaller stories involving Karofsky and Quinn were more successful than larger arcs like Rachel and Finn's". Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle said that rather than [...] "a million different storylines" [...] {{there were a few}} [...] "really good ones" [...] and added, [...] "It was chaos, but controlled chaos." [...] The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff wrote, [...] "The sequence in which Karofsky prepared himself for death was, unquestionably, {{one of the best things}} Glee has ever done." [...] He added that it was [...] "all the more a shame" [...] that it occurred in an episode that did not know how to make effective use of [...] "the impact of that moment", and he gave the episode as a whole a [...] "D" [...] grade. In a similar vein, James Poniewozik of Time said, [...] "the beginning of the episode was a very effective 15 minutes or so of television", but said that was also the episode's problem. Michael Slezak of TVLine noted that the show's [...] "audacity" [...] allowed it [...] "to tackle some of the most important issues of the day with a headiness and honesty that aren’t merely refreshing, but absolutely necessary", and added, [...] "If I’ve got any complaint with the episode, it would have to be that for a show that’s billed as a musical comedy, there certainly weren’t many laughs, and the musical interludes seemed like something of an afterthought". In a similar vein, Billboard Rae Votta wrote, [...] "Any thoughts that Glee is, in fact, a comedy should be soundly crushed by now. It's a fantastical reality, <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>you</b> laugh at that, but other times you cry." ...|$|E

Even though he was young, he was singing some deep stuff back then. [...] is about {{the ins and outs of}} a relationship.

He then met Enya and the Ryans at a chance meeting at the Irish Recorded Music Association award ceremony in Dublin, and learned Enya was thinking about signing with a rival label. Dickins seized the opportunity and signed her to Warner Music with a deal worth £75,000, granting her wish to write and record with artistic freedom, minimal interference from the label, and without set deadlines to finish albums. Dickins said: [...] "Sometimes you sign an act to make money, <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>you</b> sign an act to make music. This was clearly the latter ...
