40|$|This book {{is about}} the {{longevity}} of digital surrogates of historical photographs. The preservation of digital photos is considered {{in the context of}} long-term access to digital objects in general. There is a general view among archivists, librarians and museum professionals that analogue originals and their digital counterparts are closely related. The features of a digital surrogate, such as a scanned historical photograph, are based on an assessment of the <b>analogue</b> <b>original</b> as well as the intended function of the digital surrogate, also in the long term. This gives the digital objects to be preserved a very specific character that justifies the scope of this research on the longevity of a specific digital data object. The focus on the longevity of digital surrogates of historical photographs enables the investigation of available building blocks for digital preservation such as guidelines, procedures, tools, standards, strategies and methods to enable long-term access to digital data objects. This study examines in detail the role of digital preservation strategies, file format standards, content format standards, metadata schemas and other building blocks for the realisation of durable digital surrogates of historical photographs...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{an approach}} to preserve presentation by using metadata to describe the ‘look' of digital documents {{in order to make}} them appear in a trustworthy way. The reason for making them appear in a trustworthy way is that documents often get record status, for example in a governmental agency. The concept of Records Continuum together with work conducted by Heslop, Davis and Wilson at National Archives of Australia regarding preservation of digital records, is some sources of inspiration for the approach suggested in this paper, together with discussions around significant properties and imitative copies. This paper focuses on discussing how metadata driven presentation of web-based forms can be a suitable way to preserve logical and physical structure of such forms, and in particular reason around a model suggested for this kind of preservation (Nilsson 2006). This is all part on an ongoing work and at the moment the focus lies on objects that are created digitally (i. e. does not have an <b>analogue</b> <b>original).</b> This paper only considers individual documents/forms/records and not records in the meaning of several digital objects that all are part of one record. The results, which are based on interviews with individuals in the archival community, point at that the suggested approach, despite some problems, could be a suitable way to handle the access to imitative copies of digital objects, but that this alone is not enough for achieving trust in the object.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Classic {{microscopy}} {{does not}} allow dealing with visual and photographic phenomena, observation of the distinctions where they are needed, or carrying out of any image processing other than cutting. Digital imaging provided more detailed and distinctive insights, and {{formed the basis for}} the development of the image processing tools and techniques that transcended in potential and power all initial expectations. The purpose of this article is to present our achievements in this area. METHODS: The starting point is that the matrix. Digital image is a discrete approximation of the continuous two-argument function. <b>Analogue</b> <b>original</b> is a fair basis to start building good mathematical representations of present objects structures, features, which are then subjected to calculations transformations and analyses that could precisely match the predefined aims. These analyses are: Photomorphology 3 D model with morphometrics and full 3 D navigation, mathematical representations of granular forms in images, object contours, mathematical representations of chromosomes with mathematical definition of similarity, automatic procedures, such as pattern normalizations, matching, classifications, which leads to broader application of Artificial Intelligence methodology. RESULTS: We developed a method and a complex software environment for microscopic imaging, with many tools and algorithms that proved to be useful in genetics, pathology, and oncology. The presented method is prepared and available for further generalizations and automatization, easily bridging to intelligent systems. CONCLUSION: Microscopic imaging is powerful new high-tech domain of great assistance in biomedical research and medical practice that is revolutionizing real time diagnostic methods and potential, matching the power of molecular biology techniques. Being the pioneers in the microscopic imaging, we are pleased that it is exponentially expanding to the general benefit...|$|E

40|$|The {{main subject}} of this paper {{concerns}} the longevity of {{a specific type of}} digital object, namely a digital image. This paper consists of three parts. The first part of this paper contains background information on digital images. An explanation is given on {{the fact that there is}} a large number of digital image formats. Also the difference and relevance of digital born images and digital images that act as surrogates of an <b>analogue</b> <b>original</b> is covered in the first part of the paper. The second part of this paper gives an overview on the current state of art in preservation of digital objects. The main digital preservation strategies are explained and the emerging OAIS reference model is covered. This international standard is an important conceptual framework for a wide range of digital preservation initiatives. Other topics discussed in the second part of this paper are preservation metadata, file format preservation and the durability of storage media for digital objects. The third part of this paper concentrates on the preservation of digital raster images. The main factors that determine the longevity of a digital raster file are the applied image file format and the application of preservation metadata. Detailed information on the most suitable image file format and preservation metadata with regard to the long-term access of the digital images is given. If used in a specific way (e. g. without compression) the TIFF image file format seems to be the most durable digital raster file format. A number of metadata element sets do exist that improve the longevity of digital raster images. Some metadata element sets aimed at the formulation of technical metadata for digital images are discussed. The availability of technical metadata is an important facilitator for the longevity of digital raster images. ...|$|E
