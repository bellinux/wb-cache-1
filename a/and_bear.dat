5|$|Common and gregarious, the hardnose shark is a {{predator}} of bony fishes, cephalopods, and crustaceans.

Females have a biennial reproductive cycle <b>and</b> <b>bear</b> litters {{of one or two}} pups after a twelve-month gestation period. The hardnose shark is fished for meat throughout its range and, given its low reproductive rate, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it as Near Threatened.|$|E

50|$|A {{recent study}} found genetic {{evidence}} of multiple instances and species combinations where genetic material has passed the species boundary in bears (a process called introgression by geneticists). Specifically, species with evidence of past intermingling were (1) brown <b>bear</b> <b>and</b> American black <b>bear,</b> (2) brown <b>bear</b> <b>and</b> polar <b>bear,</b> (3) American black <b>bear</b> <b>and</b> Asian black <b>bear,</b> (4) bears currently distributed in Asia (sloth <b>bear,</b> sun <b>bear</b> <b>and</b> Asian black <b>bear).</b> Overall, this study shows that evolution in the bear family (Ursidae) has not been strictly , but instead showed complex evolutionary relationships.|$|R

5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s Amtrak found {{itself with a}} supply of surplus Metroliner cars with {{problematic}} propulsion systems, but with sound body and frame, stored at their Wilmington <b>and</b> <b>Bear</b> shop complexes in Delaware. The coaches were, except for the propulsion systems, a near-identical match to Amfleet coaches. Twenty-nine of the 31 coaches were renumbered and used as cab control cars for corridor services. This allowed trains to operate in push-pull service, rather than needing to be turned around on a wye at terminals or to have a locomotive on each end.|$|E
