40|$|Objective: To {{explore the}} {{significance}} of the combination of factor <b>analysis</b> <b>and</b> <b>systematic</b> cluster <b>analysis</b> in classification of traditional Chinese medical syndromes in patients with posthepatitic cirrhosis, and to provide a scientific basis for the criterion of the classification. Methods: We designed a clinical questionnaire according to the clinical characteristics and the demands of traditional Chinese medical information collection for patients with posthepatitic cirrhosis. By means of clinical epidemiological research, with the four diagnosis methods for clinical information collection of traditional Chinese medicine, symptoms, physical signs, tongue conditions and pulse conditions in 310 patients with posthepatitic cirrhosis were collected, and the characteristics of traditional Chinese medical syndromes in these patients were explored with statistical methods, such as factor <b>analysis,</b> varimax <b>and</b> <b>systematic</b> cluster <b>analysis.</b> Results: Analyzed by factor <b>analysis</b> <b>and</b> <b>systematic</b> cluster <b>analysis</b> with SPSS 11. 0, the traditional Chinese medical syndromes in 287 of the 310 cases (92. 58 %) of posthepatitic cirrhosis could be classified. The syndromes could be divided into 7 categories, which were internal accumulation of damp-heat (55 cases), insufficiency of the spleen with overabundance of dampness (74 cases), accumulation of blood stasis plus deficiency of liver-yin and kidney-yin (73 cases), accumulation of blood stasis plus deficiency of both blood and qi (40 cases), deficiency of both blood and qi (16 cases), deficiency of yin and blood heat (6 cases) and stagnation of the liver-qi and deficiency of the spleen (23 cases). The traditional Chinese medical syndromes in the other 23 cases could not be classified. Conclusions: The clinical information collected with the four diagnostic methods of traditional Chinese medicine can be classified into different categories with the factor <b>analysis</b> <b>and</b> <b>systematic</b> cluster <b>analysis.</b> The factor <b>analysis</b> <b>and</b> <b>systematic</b> cluster <b>analysis</b> can reveal the characteristics and regularity of traditional Chinese medical syndromes in patients with posthepatitic cirrhosis in a way, and have value in researching the syndromes of traditional Chinese medicine...|$|R

50|$|Archer trained a {{generation}} of design researchers, showing them how the procedures of scholarly research based on well-founded evidence <b>and</b> <b>systematic</b> <b>analysis</b> were as applicable in design as in the more traditional academic subjects. For design practice he argued {{there was a need}} for method and rigour, and for decisions to be recorded and explained so they could, if necessary, be defended. Today, practitioners are familiar with these issues through the requirements of quality assurance, while in academia the Research Assessment Exercise has pushed even the art and design community into taking research seriously. Thirty or forty years ago, however, Archer’s ideas were radical and pioneering, and the very existence of his research department - in an art college - controversial. It was his own force of character and his persuasive ability to argue his case with absolute clarity and conviction that ensured the department’s survival, and provided him with the opportunity to demonstrate that design is not just a craft skill but a knowledge-based discipline in its own right.|$|E

5000|$|Thomas J. D'Zurilla in 1988 defined {{problem solving}} as a “cognitive-affective-behavioral {{process through which}} an {{individual}} (or group) attempts to identify, discover, or invent effective means of coping with problems encountered in every day living”. It is an evolutionary drive for living organisms and an important coping skill for dealing {{with a variety of}} concerns. Problem solving specifically in psychology refers to a state of desire for reaching a definite 'goal' from a present condition that either is not directly moving toward the goal, is far from it, or needs more complex logic for finding a missing description of conditions or steps toward the goal. In each case [...] "where you want to be" [...] is an imagined (or written) state in which you would like to be and the solutions are situation- or context-specific. This process includes problem finding or 'problem analysis', problem shaping, generating alternative strategies, implementation and verification of the selected solution. Distinguished feature of a problem {{is that there is a}} goal to be reached and how you get there depends upon problem orientation (problem-solving coping style and skills) <b>and</b> <b>systematic</b> <b>analysis.</b> The nature of human problem solving processes and methods is a field of study and work for mental health professionals. Methods of studying problem solving include introspection, behaviorism, simulation, computer modeling, and experiment. Social psychologists look into the person-environment relationship aspect of the problem and independent and interdependent problem-solving methods. Problem solving has been defined as a higher-order cognitive process and intellectual function that requires the modulation and control of more routine or fundamental skills.|$|E
50|$|Health sector {{reform in}} Ethiopia is an {{undergoing}} {{process as a}} comprehensive endeavor in the socio-economic reform that started with Civil Service Reform covering the entire public sector of the country. As part of this national effort, the reform in the health sector has been intensified {{through the application of}} a new concept known as Business Process Reengineering (BPR). BPR {{has been used as a}} tool for a comprehensive analysis, redesign and revamping of the health sector in Ethiopia. As a process itself forms a fundamental rethinking and requires a purposeful and radical redesign of health business processes to achieve dramatic improvements in critical, contemporary measures of performance such as cost, quality, service and speed. The BPR is a country led, multisectoral undertaking implemented as a comprehensive approach to the government’s civil service reform. The purpose of the PBR in the context of the health sector was to establish customer focused institutions, rapid scaling up of health services and enhancing the quality of care in order to improve the health status of the Ethiopian people as indicated in the mission of the health sector. Following a deeper <b>and</b> <b>systematic</b> <b>analysis</b> of the “as is” situation at all levels of the health system, including health facilities, the sector has brought in innovative approaches including, benchmarking best practices, redesign new processes, revising organizational structures and a selection of 8 core process and 5 support processes. The new 8 core processes are; Health Care Delivery; Public Health Emergency Management; Research and Technology Transfer; Pharmaceutical Supply; Resource Mobilization and Health Insurance; Health and Health Related Services and Product Regulation; Health Infrastructure, Expansion and Rehabilitation; and Policy, Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation.
