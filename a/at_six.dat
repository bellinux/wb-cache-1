During their time at Giovanola, they helped design the company's first stand-up roller coaster, Shockwave <b>at</b> <b>Six</b> Flags Magic Mountain. They also worked on other projects, such as Z-Force <b>at</b> <b>Six</b> Flags Great America. Bolliger & Mabillard left Giovanola, {{but the company}} continued to use their track design, so the company's roller coasters, Goliath <b>at</b> <b>Six</b> Flags Magic Mountain and Titan <b>at</b> <b>Six</b> Flags Over Texas, use a track style very similar to B's.|$|E

5|$|In women, acne can be {{improved}} {{with the use of}} any combined birth control pill. These decrease the production of androgen hormones by the ovaries, resulting in lower skin production of sebum, and consequently reduce acne severity. Combinations containing third- or fourth-generation progestins such as desogestrel, drospirenone, or norgestimate are preferred for women with acne due to their stronger antiandrogenic effects. A 2014 review found that oral antibiotics appear to be somewhat more effective than birth control pills at decreasing the number of inflammatory acne lesions at three months. However, the two therapies are approximately equal in efficacy <b>at</b> <b>six</b> months for decreasing the number of inflammatory, non-inflammatory, and total acne lesions. The authors of the analysis suggested that birth control pills may be a preferred first-line acne treatment, over oral antibiotics, in certain women due to similar efficacy <b>at</b> <b>six</b> months and a lack of associated antibiotic resistance.|$|E
