After a few more jump cuts in which they turn to the right <b>and</b> <b>back</b> <b>again,</b> the figure stands still, then looks to its left slowly. The figure looks down to where a box with various triangular sections appears, then to their right as the image seems to fragment briefly. For the remainder of the video, the cloaked figure stands still with its back to the wall, with the camera apparently handheld again and occasional video effects briefly doubling the image.|$|E

5|$|It is {{most likely}} that the three assemblages mark organisms adapted to {{survival}} in different environments, and that any apparent patterns in diversity or age are in fact an artefact of the few samples that have been discovered – the timeline (right) demonstrates the paucity of Ediacaran fossil-bearing assemblages. An analysis {{of one of the}} White Sea fossil beds, where the layers cycle from continental seabed to inter-tidal to estuarine <b>and</b> <b>back</b> <b>again</b> a few times, found that a specific set of Ediacaran organisms was associated with each environment.|$|E

5|$|The up-down {{display is}} used {{for a number of}} {{interactions}} {{with other members of the}} species. Here a stork positions its body horizontally and quickly bobs its head up from down-facing to around 30 degrees above horizontal <b>and</b> <b>back</b> <b>again,</b> while displaying the white segments of its plumage prominently, and this is repeated several times. The display is used as a greeting between birds, and—more vigorously—as a threat display. The species' solitary nature means that this threat display is rarely witnessed.|$|E
5|$|A Junkers F.13 {{called at}} Lympne on 10 January 1923 {{to clear customs}} and then flew to Croydon where it was {{inspected}} by Secretary of State for Air Sir Samuel Hoare. In February, {{it was reported that}} Lympne had taken part in a test of the newly introduced Mayday radio signal used by aircraft to indicate that they were in distress. Georges Barbot won a prize of F.25,000 from Le Matin when he made a flight from St Inglevert to Lympne <b>and</b> <b>back</b> <b>again</b> on the same day, 6 May.

The voyagers, spent two months traveling from Seattle, {{along the coast of}} Alaska, to Siberia, <b>and</b> <b>back</b> <b>again.</b> In many ways, the expedition was an intersection of 19th-century science and 20th-century science. The expedition claimed to have discovered some 600 species that were new to science, including 38 new fossil species. They charted the geographic distribution of many species. They discovered an unmapped fiord and named several glaciers. John Muir and his friend Harriman who were members of this expedition were instrumental in governmental lobbying on National Park legislation says. The Herriman expedition was instrumental in documenting the extent of the glacier's retreat in 1899.|$|E
