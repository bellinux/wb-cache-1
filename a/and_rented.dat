40|$|Purpose - In recent years, {{housing prices}} <b>and</b> <b>rents</b> have {{recorded}} impressive growth in Iran. Several observers believe that {{real estate agents}} have {{had a significant effect}} on this phenomenon. However, some do not agree with this viewpoint and argue that the role of real estate agents is not that much and housing prices <b>and</b> <b>rents</b> are affected by macroeconomic factors. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to investigate whether real estate agents can influence housing prices <b>and</b> <b>rents</b> across provinces of Iran. Design/methodology/approach - Applying panel data technique, this paper uses observations from 28 provinces of Iran covering 2000 and 2003 to examine the role of real estate agents on housing prices <b>and</b> <b>rents.</b> Findings - The empirical results indicate that the increased number of real estate agents and their activities positively significantly stimulate housing prices <b>and</b> <b>rents.</b> Research limitations/implications - To the author's knowledge, most studies in this area cover the US and European real estate markets. Since findings for developed countries might not be directly transferable to emerging market economies such as Iran, more work is necessary to obtain a clearer picture of the role of real estate agents on housing prices <b>and</b> <b>rents</b> in emerging economies. Originality/value - Although there has been a series of cross-sectional studies published in this area, few empirical works have examined the effects of real estate agents on housing prices <b>and</b> <b>rents</b> by applying panel data set. The paper begins to fill this gap by analyzing a data sample of 28 provinces of Iran covering 2000 and 2003...|$|R

5|$|As the Browns recaptured {{a hint of}} past {{success in}} 1994, all was not well behind the scenes. Modell was in {{financial}} trouble. The origins of Modell's woes dated to 1973, when he worked out a deal to lease Cleveland Municipal Stadium from the city for a pittance: only enough to service the facility's debt and pay property taxes. Cleveland Browns Stadium Corporation, or Stadium Corp., a company Modell and a business associate created and owned, held the 25-year lease. Stadium Corp. then subleased the stadium to the Browns and the Cleveland Indians, <b>and</b> <b>rented</b> it out for concerts and other events.

5|$|Pressure from an {{increasing}} population {{led to the}} town being supplied with amenities such as sewers, which were built in 1875–1880; and Sale {{was connected to the}} telephone network in 1888. As in the late-19th century, the early-20th century saw a great deal of construction work in Sale. The town's first swimming baths were built in 1914, and its first cinema, the Palace, was opened during the First World War. The end of the war in 1918 resulted in a rush of marriages, which highlighted a shortage of housing. The local councils of Sale and Ashton upon Mersey took the initiative of building council housing, <b>and</b> <b>rented</b> it to the local population at below market rates. By the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, Sale had 594council houses. The building programme was interrupted by the start of the war. additional private housing development brought the total of inter-war houses built in Sale to around 900, including large housing estates like Woodheys Hall estate in Ashton.|$|E
5|$|St. John's Orphanage, {{sometimes}} referred to as the Goulburn Boys Orphanage, is a decommissioned orphanage located on Mundy Street in Goulburn, a town located in New South Wales, Australia. The architect of the building is EC Manfred.

It is two storeys high, and several extensions were added to the building throughout its early history. The orphanage amalgamated with St. Joseph's Orphanage for girls in 1976, and the remaining orphans were placed into group homes.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{document}} a strong positive correlation of immigration flows {{with changes in}} average wages <b>and</b> average house <b>rents</b> for native residents across U. S. states. Instrumental variables estimates reveal that the correlations are compatible with a causal interpretation from immigration to wages <b>and</b> <b>rents</b> of natives. Separating the effects of immigrants on natives of different schooling levels we find positive effects on the wages <b>and</b> <b>rents</b> of highly educated and small effects on the wages (negative) <b>and</b> <b>rents</b> (positive) of less educated. We propose a model where natives and immigrants of three different education levels interact in production in a central district {{and live in the}} surrounding region. In equilibrium the inflow of immigrants has a positive productive effect on natives due to complementarieties in production as well as a positive competition effect on rents. The model calibrated and simulated with U. S. -states data matches most of the estimated effects of immigrants on wages <b>and</b> <b>rents</b> of natives in the period 1990 - 2005. This validation suggests the proposed model as a useful tool to evaluate the impacts of alternative immigration scenarios on U.
