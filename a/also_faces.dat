5|$|The Baltimore Sun <b>also</b> <b>faces</b> {{budget cuts}} and the {{newsroom}} struggles to adequately cover the city, omitting many important stories. Commissioner Burrell continues to falsify crime statistics and is fired by Carcetti, who positions Daniels to replace him.|$|E
5|$|The Amami rabbit <b>also</b> <b>faces</b> huge {{threats from}} the {{invasive}} predators, being {{a major cause}} for the decline in population size. On the island of Amami, the small Indian mongoose (Herpestes javanicus) was released to control the population of a local venomous snake, and its numbers have increased dramatically. This mongoose, along with feral cats and dogs, are outpreying the Amami rabbit.|$|E
5|$|For {{the most}} part the player battles through the game alone, but is {{occasionally}} assisted by non-player characters; specifically security guards and scientists who help the player; the guards will fight alongside the player, and both guards and scientists can assist in reaching new areas and impart relevant plot information. A wide array of alien enemies populate the game, including headcrabs, bullsquids, headcrab zombies, and Vortigaunts. The player <b>also</b> <b>faces</b> human opponents, in particular, Hazardous Environment Combat Unit (HECU) Marines and black ops assassins who are dispatched to contain the extra-dimensional threats and silence all witnesses.|$|E

5|$|Among the Pagans {{who use the}} Coldrum Stones {{for their}} ritual activities, there is general {{satisfaction}} with the Trust's management of the site, although some frustration at the poor access for disabled visitors. A patch of scorched earth exists on the grass in {{the centre of the}} monument, perhaps used by Pagans as well as non-Pagans, and the Trust warden responsible for the site has decided to leave it there rather than seeding it over, in order to encourage any who do light fires {{to do so in the}} same spot rather than nearer to the stones themselves. The site <b>also</b> <b>faces</b> a problem from litter left by visitors, although Pagans who regularly visit the site clean this up.|$|E
5|$|George Sr. is not, in fact, gone. After faking {{his death}} in Mexico by paying off the cops, George Sr. returns to the family model home, where George Michael discovers him and hides him in the attic. To protect his son from legal implications, Michael hides George Sr. in Gob's prop Aztec Tomb, orchestrates a diversion, and tells the family that George Sr. has escaped once more. Throughout {{the rest of the}} season, Michael sneaks George Sr. provisions, and George Sr. keeps tabs on the Bluth family through the {{ventilation}} system. George Sr. <b>also</b> <b>faces</b> onslaught from the outside world; the press begins looking for him in Iraq, fumigators surround the house while he's still in the attic, and Kitty returns to steal a sample of his semen to make her own Bluth baby.|$|E

25|$|The river zone <b>also</b> <b>faces</b> {{the problem}} of {{industrial}} pollution and forcible occupation of land by people. Arresting environmental hazards resulting from lack of sanitation facilities, encroachment, groundwater contamination like arsenic pollution, destruction of aquatic flora, fauna {{are some of the}} burning problem of the areas that needs to be tackled through participatory mechanism.|$|E
25|$|However, Vietnam <b>also</b> <b>faces</b> disputes, {{mostly with}} Cambodia over the border, and especially, China, over the South China Sea. In 2016, President Barack Obama became the 3rd U.S. Head of State to visit Vietnam, helping {{normalize}} relations into a higher level, by lifting embargo of lethal weapons, allowing Vietnam to buy lethal weapons and modernize its military.|$|E

50|$|A {{federal law}} was {{implemented}} in 1998 which banned school corporal punishment. The law {{applied to all}} schools, both public and private. Any teacher who engages in the practice would not only lose their job and teaching license, but will <b>also</b> <b>face</b> criminal prosecution for engaging in violence against minors and will <b>also</b> <b>face</b> child abuse charges.|$|R

25|$|In practice, the Ministry of Public Works and Communications has not {{developed}} sector policies, leaving a vacuum in this important area. The regulatory agency, {{created for the}} purpose of regulating prospective private enterprises, has been ineffective at regulating the national public enterprise ESSAP. SENASA <b>also</b> <b>faces</b> many challenges, since it does not have sufficient capacity to provide adequate support to the ever-increasing number of Juntas.|$|E
25|$|The ROC Armed Forces' {{officer corps}} is {{generally}} {{viewed as being}} competent, displaying {{a high degree of}} professionalism. However, as a whole, the culture in the officer corps tends to be very cautious and conservative. The military <b>also</b> <b>faces</b> difficulties in the recruitment and retention of junior officers and NCOs due to competition with the private sector. There are, however, plans to make it a volunteer armed forces.|$|E
25|$|Harford County <b>also</b> <b>faces</b> {{controversy}} {{from residents}} living near Scarboro Landfill and Harford Waste Disposal Center, the only municipal landfill. The landfill, approved to triple in size in 2007, {{is the subject}} of complaints by neighbors of operating violations, such as large areas of open trash and blown litter, leachate breaks which contaminate area residential wells and flow into Deer Creek, a tributary of the Susquehanna River, and increased health problems.|$|E

25|$|On July 7, Roof {{was indicted}} on the nine murder charges and the weapons charge, as well three new charges of {{attempted}} murder, {{one for each}} person who survived the shooting. He <b>also</b> <b>faces</b> federal hate crime charges, including nine counts of using a firearm to commit murder and 24 civil rights violations (12 hate crime charges and 12 counts of violating a person's freedom of religion), with 18 of the charges carrying the federal death penalty.|$|E
25|$|Incomplete {{reprogramming}}: reprogramming <b>also</b> <b>faces</b> {{the challenge}} of completeness. This is particularly challenging because the genome-wide epigenetic code must be reformatted {{to that of the}} target cell type in order to fully reprogram a cell. However, three separate groups were able to find mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF)-derived iPS cells that could be injected into tetraploid blastocysts and resulted in the live birth of mice derived entirely from iPS cells, thus ending the debate over the equivalence of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and iPS with regard to pluripotency.|$|E
25|$|The ECC is {{responsible}} for the promotion and development of the game of cricket across the European continent and Israel (for cricketing purposes, as with nearly all sports, Israel {{is considered to be a}} European country). Europe is a region where the game has not traditionally flourished. Cricket <b>also</b> <b>faces</b> tough competition from much more popular sports, such as football and basketball. It lists its key objectives as: Participation, High Performance, Tournament Structure, Widening the Market, and promoting the Spirit of Cricket.|$|E

25|$|The South East Gopuram {{is a new}} {{addition}} to the temple. Although this gopuram is in the South-East corner of the temple complex, it <b>also</b> <b>faces</b> South. Built in December 2011, its primary purpose is to welcome those coming from within the island to worship the Goddess, and visitors from the nearby Naga Vihara (Buddhist Temple). It reaches the height of about 20–25 feet. It is the smallest gopuram and has the fewest number of sculptures. It was also painted in bright and vibrant colours to match the other gopurams.|$|E
25|$|Oakland scouts {{are first}} dismissive and then hostile towards Brand's {{non-traditional}} sabermetric approach to scouting players. Grady Fuson aggressively confronts Beane, and is fired. Grady then {{takes to the}} radio airwaves to question the team's future. Rather than relying on the scouts' experience and intuition, Brand selects players based almost exclusively on their on-base percentage (OBP). Beane signs the ones Brand suggests, such as unorthodox submarine pitcher Chad Bradford, past-his-prime outfielder David Justice, and an injured catcher, Scott Hatteberg. Beane <b>also</b> <b>faces</b> opposition from Art Howe, the Athletics' manager, who does {{not agree with the}} new philosophy. Howe disregards Beane's and Brand's strategy and plays a lineup he prefers.|$|E
25|$|The {{export markets}} have been {{severely}} damaged by competition from cheaper Caribbean and Latin American competitors. But domestic manufacturing <b>also</b> <b>faces</b> serious potential problems, as trade liberalisation {{means that the}} government can no longer protect national industries by imposing high tariffs on imported goods. Thus, Barbadian manufacturers must compete with those from other regional economies, whose wage costs and other overheads are usually much lower. The other significant industrial employer is the petroleum sector, where oil deposits are located in the southern parishes but oil has not been produced in commercial quantities; although the island's small oil refinery was closed in 1998 and refining moved to Trinidad and Tobago, where labour and other costs are cheaper.|$|E
