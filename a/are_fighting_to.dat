5|$|The Transitional Federal Government was internationally {{recognized}} as the government of Somalia until August 2012, when it {{was replaced by the}} Federal Government of Somalia. It was established in 2004 as a successor to the now defunct Transitional National Government, and currently occupies Somalia's seat in the United Nations. The TFG is allied with the Islamic Courts Union and the Alliance for the Re-liberation of Somalia, and is backed by the United States, the United Nations and the African Union. Its forces <b>are</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>to</b> quell the ongoing insurgency in Somalia and are attempting to gain control of the southern half of the country, as the northern regions are both autonomous and comparatively stable. As a truce, in March 2009, Somalia's newly established coalition government announced that it would implement shari'a as the nation's official judicial system.|$|E

500|$|The concert program {{received}} a positive reception. The Oregonian David Stabler wrote {{that during the}} May 7 performance the orchestra displayed peak condition and [...] "played with a precision and intensity {{that would have been}} unattainable a decade ago". He complimented Sylvan's diction and [...] "emotional engagement", but noted that some words were difficult to make out. Stabler called the timpanist's performance during Britten's symphony [...] "fierce" [...] and the orchestra's playing [...] "clear and intentional". In his review of the Carnegie Hall performance, Stabler opined that the Oregon Symphony's program (which he described as one of [...] "rage, brutality and fleeting beauty that required the utmost precision and ferocity from the musicians") focused more on playing, while the programs by other orchestras drew attention to the music. Stabler wrote: [...] "Everyone knows orchestras <b>are</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>to</b> survive, but on this night, the Oregon Symphony breathed long and deep of triumph." [...] In a separate article summarizing reviews by New York critics, Stabler called the Symphony a [...] "virtuosos band" [...] that [...] "now plays with more acute rhythmic precision, more clarity, more informed style... and more extreme dynamics and tempos". James Bash of Oregon Music News wrote a positive review of the New York performance, describing it as more enhanced, dramatic and intense than the Portland concerts, partly because of the venue's superior acoustics. Bash described the orchestra's performance of The Unanswered Question as [...] "compelling and auspicious" [...] and wrote that Sylvan's vocals during The Wound-Dresser [...] "conveyed the sensitive text superbly". In addition to complimenting the Symphony overall, Bash singled out solo performers by name. After noting the audience's enthusiastic response to the performance, including multiple bravos and particular recognition for Kalmar, Bash quipped [...] "the Oregon Symphony may be regional in terms of size and budget, but they are world-class when they play".|$|E

[...] Hill supported the repeal of don't ask, don't tell, voted for the Employment Non-Discrimination Act in 2010, and opposed a proposed amendment to the U.S. Constitution to ban same-sex marriage. Hill did not campaign for same-sex marriage, however, and did not cosponsor legislation brought by 121 Democrats to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act, which barred federal recognition of same-sex marriage. As public attitudes changed, Hill's position shifted, and in 2015, while running for Senate, Hill said: [...] "Marriage equality is especially close to my own heart.

These incidents, {{along with many other}} perfidious actions of the Japanese {{throughout}} the Pacific War, led to an American tendency to shoot the dead or wounded Japanese soldiers and those who were attempting to surrender and not take them as prisoners of war easily. Two Marines of Iwo Jima told cautionary tales. One confided: [...] "They always told you take prisoners but we had some bad experiences on Saipan taking prisoners, you take them and then as soon as they get behind the lines they drop grenades and you lose a few more people. You get a little bit leery of taking prisoners when they <b>are</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>to</b> the death and so are you."

2500|$|Modern adaptions of {{the play}} have often made {{contemporary}} political references, with Caesar depicted as resembling a variety of political leaders, including Huey Long, Margaret Thatcher, and Tony Blair. Professor A. J. Hartley, the Robinson Chair of Shakespeare Studies at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, states that this is fairly [...] "common trope" [...] of Julius Caesar performances: [...] "Throughout the 20th century and into the 21st, the rule has been to create a recognisable political world within the production. And often people {{in the title role}} itself look like or feel like somebody either in recent or current politics." [...] A 2012 production of Julius Caesar by the Guthrie Theatre and The Acting Company [...] "presented Caesar {{in the guise of a}} black actor who was meant to suggest President Obama." [...] This production was not particularly controversial. In 2017, however, a modern adaptation {{of the play}} at New York's Shakespeare in the Park (performed by The Public Theater) depicted Caesar with the likeness of President Donald Trump and thereby aroused ferocious controversy, drawing criticism by right-wing media such as The Daily Caller and Breitbart and prompting corporate sponsors Bank of America and Delta Airlines to pull their financial support. The Public Theater stated that the message of the play is not pro-assassination and that the point is that [...] "those who attempt to defend democracy by undemocratic means pay a terrible price and destroy the very thing they <b>are</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>to</b> save." [...] Shakespeare scholars Stephen Greenblatt and Peter Holland agreed with this statement. Pallotta stated that [...] "I have never read anyone suggesting that 'Julius Caesar' is a play that recommends assassination. Look what happens: Caesar is assassinated to stop him becoming a dictator. Result: civil war, massive slaughter, creation of an emperor, execution of many who sympathized with the conspiracy. Doesn't look much like a successful result for the conspirators to me." [...] The play was interrupted several times by right-wing protesters, who accused the play of [...] "violence against the right", and actors and members of theatres with Shakespeare in the name has been harassed and received death threats, including the wife of the play's director Oskar Eustis. The protests were praised by American Family Association director Sandy Rios who compared the play with the execution of Christians by damnatio ad bestias.|$|E

60|$|Now a new wind {{is getting}} up. We call it Labour versus Capitalism. We {{say it is}} a mere {{material}} struggle, a money-grabbing affair. But this is only one aspect of it. In so far as men are merely mechanical, the struggle is one which, though it may bring disaster and death to millions, is no more than accident, an accidental collision of forces. But in so far as men are men, the situation is tragic. It is not really the bone we are fighting for. We <b>are</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>to</b> have somebody's head off.

A great party does not change suddenly, and at once, all its principles and professions. The Republican party have taken their stand on law, and the existing constitution of the Union. They have disclaimed all right to attempt anything which that constitution forbids. It does forbid interference by the Federal Congress with slavery in the Slave States; {{but it does not}} forbid their abolishing it in the District of Columbia; and this they are now doing, having voted, I perceive, in their present pecuniary straits, a million of dollars to indemnify the slave-owners of the District. Neither did the Constitution, in their own opinion, require them to permit the introduction of slavery into the territories which were not yet States. To prevent this, the Republican party was formed, and to prevent it, they are now fighting, as the slave-owners <b>are</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>to</b> enforce it.|$|E

6000|$|Here and there, however, certain {{members of}} the {{capitalist}} class see clearly the cleavage in society along which the struggle is beginning to show itself, while the press and magazines are beginning to raise an occasional and troubled voice.

Like the socialists, they do not mince matters, but state boldly and plainly that they <b>are</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>to</b> subjugate the opposing class. It is the barons against the commons. One of these leagues, the National Association of Manufacturers, is stopping short of nothing in what it conceives to be a life-and-death struggle. Mr. D. M.
