40|$|As {{part of an}} {{investigation}} into the feasibility of an offshore combined wind/wave energy converting platform, comprising one or more wind turbines mounted on a floating structure in which a number of oscillating water columns (OWCs) are embedded, testing was carried out on a 1 : 50 scale model of the wave energy converting component of the platform. The model comprises two legs joined at one end at an angle of 90 degrees. A form of soft latching is implemented through the use of high and low-pressure plenums to which the OWC chambers communicate via <b>air</b> <b>admittance</b> <b>valves.</b> The model was tested in a number of configurations, subject to varying amounts of simulated power take-off damping and over a range of incident regular-wave periods. Platform motions, OWC chamber and plenum pressure and water column motions were recorded for each test. This paper discusses some considerations in the design, construction, instrumentation and testing of the model. Thermodynamic theory describing the flow of air throughout the system, based on the conservation of mass, is developed and related to the motion of the water columns. Representative results from the model testing in the time domain are presented. Finally, some conclusions are drawn from these results...|$|R
40|$|Various {{studies in}} the oceans {{have shown that the}} {{flexural}} rigidity, or equivalently effective elastic thickness (Te), of the lithosphere is determined by the load and plate age. The results of {{studies in the}} continents have, however, been more controversial. Determinations of Te made using spectral studies and based on the Bouguer anomaly coherence technique and surface and subsurface loading suggest that North America has a high Te "core" (> 100 km) which is flanked by lower values. In contrast, studies based on the free <b>air</b> <b>admittance</b> suggest that Te of North America is < 25 km, and of the order of the seismogenic layer thickness. It has been proposed that this discrepancy results from the fact that estimates based only on Bouguer coherence may be biased upward due to topographical erosion which introduces "noise", especially at short wavelengths. In order to address this question further, we have used a maximum entropy based coherence method to determine the wavelength relationship between gravity and topography in the southern Appalachians, a region where the Bouguer coherence, free-air admittance, and forward modeling techniques have already been applied. Our studies reveal a variable Te structure with a mean Te of 51 km and values which have a range 20 to 100 km. The mapped Te fabric has a distinct NE-SW trend which appears to follow the tectonic elements of the southern Appalachians. In particular, the foreland is generally associated with higher Te values than the flanking erogenic belt. Correlations at smaller scales are difficult, however, to establish. The Te fabric does not reflect the complex terrains that make up highly deformed regions within the orogenic belt. Our spectrally determined Te estimates are in close agreement with ones based on forward modeling. They are a factor of 4 higher, however, than results previously based on free-air admittance. We attribute this {{to the fact that we}} have used the Bouguer coherence technique which accounts for both surface and subsurface loading. Our results suggest that while other factors such as erosion may upwardly bias Te in some regions, buried loads satisfactorily explain the spectral estimates in the southern Appalachians, irrespective of whether they are based on Bouguer coherence or free-air admittance. There is solid geological evidence in the southern Appalachians which is readily attributable to the presence of subsurface loads. This is a strong argument, we believe, to suggest that Te in the continents is high and can have values which range from 20 to 100 km. Copyright 2001 by the American Geophysical Union...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} monitor and correct the {{meteorological}} factors of the spring gravity meter, {{the characteristics of the}} time varying gravity changes caused by meteorological factors were analyzed. Kunming GS 15 gravity meter from 2007 continuous gravity observation has been carried out with the sampling rate of the pressure observation. In this study, we first compare the effects of 4 types of gravity meter and 3 different types of stations on the gravity observed seasonal gravity signals. It is indicated that the observed seasonal gravity signal of the cave is only 1 / 10, and there is a constant temperature and constant pressure device. Compared with the same time, the gravity signal of the gravity signal is about 100 times smaller. The influence of the pressure load of the gravity meter is tested by using the theory of pressure. The results show that only the actual value of 2 cpd - 3 cpd pressure load varies from - 0. 395 to - 0. 280 × 10 - 8 ms- 2, and the 1 cpd to 1 cpm periodic partial type gravity meter is also in accordance with the law of gravity and air pressure. And with the characteristics of time lag. In this paper, the nonlinear zero drift parameters of the linear regression model with time lag and the time series of the GS 15 gravity meter are used to simulate the nonlinear zero drift parameters of the gravity meter. The results show that the gravity signal contains time lag 35 hours, and the <b>air</b> pressure <b>admittance</b> is 0. 8 × 10 - 8 ms- 2 /mbar. The correlation can reach 79 %. The gravity changes signal and satellite gravity as well as the gravity water load signal of the land water model are the same as the gravity water load signal in the autumn as the minimum value, and the seasonal variation of the maximum value of gravity in summer...|$|R
40|$|The Borborema Province (BP) is a {{geologic}} domain {{located in}} Northeastern Brazil. The BP is limited {{at the south}} by the São Francisco craton, at the west by the Parnaíba basin, and both at {{the north and east}} by coastal sedimentary basins. Nonetheless the BP surface geology is well known, several key aspects of its evolution are still open, notably: i) its tectonic compartmentalization established after the Brasiliano orogenesis, ii) the architecture of its cretaceous continental margin, iii) the elastic properties of its lithosphere, and iv) the causes of magmatism and uplifting which occurred in the Cenozoic. In this thesis, a regional coverage of geophysical data (elevation, gravity, magnetic, geoid height, and surface wave global tomography) were integrated with surface geologic information aiming to attain {{a better understanding of the}} above questions. In the Riacho do Pontal belt and in the western sector of the Sergipano belt, the neoproterozoic suture of the collision of the Sul domain of the BP with the Sanfranciscana plate (SFP) is correlated with an expressive dipolar gravity anomaly. The positive lobule of this anomaly is due to the BP lower continental crust uplifting whilst the negative lobule is due to the supracrustal nappes overthrusting the SFP. In the eastern sector of the Sergipano belt, this dipolar gravity anomaly does not exist. However the suture still can be identified at the southern sector of the Marancó complex arc, alongside of the Porto da Folha shear zone, where the SFP N-S geophysical alignments are truncated. The boundary associated to the collision of the Ceará domain of the BP with the West African craton is also correlated with a dipolar gravity anomaly. The positive lobule of this anomaly coincides with the Sobral-Pedro II shear zone whilst the negative lobule is associated with the Santa Quitéria magmatic arc. Judging by their geophysical signatures, the major BP internal boundaries are: i) the western sector of the Pernambuco shear zone and the eastern continuation of this shear zone as the Congo shear zone, ii) the Patos shear zone, and iii) the Jaguaribe shear zone and its southwestern continuation as the Tatajuba shear zone. These boundaries divide the BP in five tectonic domains in the geophysical criteria: Sul, Transversal, Rio Grande do Norte, Ceará, and Médio Coreaú. The Sul domain is characterized by geophysical signatures associated with the BP and SFP collision. The fact that Congo shear zone is now proposed as part of the Transversal domain boundary implies an important change in the original definition of this domain. The Rio Grande do Norte domain presents a highly magnetized crust resulted from the superposition of precambrian and phanerozoic events. The Ceará domain is divided by the Senador Pompeu shear zone in two subdomains: the eastern one corresponds to the Orós-Jaguaribe belt and the western one to the Ceará-Central subdomain. The latter subdomain exhibits a positive ENE-W SW gravity anomaly which was associated to a crustal discontinuity. This discontinuity would have acted as a rampart against to the N-S Brasiliano orogenic nappes. The Médio Coreaú domain also presents a dipolar gravity anomaly. Its positive lobule is due to granulitic rocks whereas the negative one is caused by supracrustal rocks. The boundary between Médio Coreaú and Ceará domains can be traced below the Parnaíba basin sediments by its geophysical signature. The joint analysis of free air anomalies, free <b>air</b> <b>admittances,</b> and effective elastic thickness estimates (Te) revealed that the Brazilian East and Equatorial continental margins have quite different elastic properties. In the first one 10 km < Te < 20 km whereas in the second one Te ≤ 10 km. The weakness of the Equatorial margin lithosphere was caused by the cenozoic magmatism. The BP continental margin presents segmentations; some of them have inheritance from precambrian structures and domains. The segmentations conform markedly with some sedimentary basin features which are below described from south to north. The limit between Sergipe and Alagoas subbasins coincides with the suture between BP and SFP. Te estimates indicates concordantly that in Sergipe subbasin Te is around 20 km while Alagoas subbasin has Te around 10 km, thus revealing that the lithosphere in the Sergipe subbasin has a greater rigidity than the lithosphere in the Alagoas subbasin. Additionally inside the crust beneath Sergipe subbasin occurs a very dense body (underplating or crustal heritage?) which is not present in the crust beneath Alagoas subbasin. The continental margin of the Pernambuco basin (15 < Te < 25 km) presents a very distinct free air edge effect displaying two anomalies. This fact indicates the existence in the Pernambuco plateau of a relatively thick crust. In the Paraíba basin the free air edge effect is quite uniform, Te ≈ 15 km, and the lower crust is abnormally dense probably due to its alteration by a magmatic underplating in the Cenozoic. The Potiguar basin segmentation in three parts was corroborated by the Te estimates: in the Potiguar rift Te ≅ 5 km, in the Aracati platform Te ≅ 25 km, and in the Touros platform Te ≅ 10 km. The observed weakness of the lithosphere in the Potiguar rift segment is due to the high heat flux while the relatively high strength of the lithosphere in the Touros platform may be due to the existence of an archaean crust. The Ceará basin, in the region of Mundaú and Icaraí subbasins, presents a quite uniform free air edge effect and Te ranges from 10 to 15 km. The analysis of the Bouguer admittance revealed that isostasy in BP can be explained with an isostatic model where combined surface and buried loadings are present. The estimated ratio of the buried loading relative to the surface loading is equal to 15. In addition, the lower crust in BP is abnormally dense. These affirmations are particularly adequate to the northern portion of BP where adherence of the observed data to the isostatic model is quite good. Using the same above described isostatic model to calculate the coherence function, it was obtained that a single Te estimate for the entire BP must be lower than 60 km; in addition, the BP north portion has Te around 20 km. Using the conventional elastic flexural model to isostasy, an inversion of crust thickness was performed. It was identified two regions in BP where the crust is thickened: one below the Borborema plateau (associated to an uplifting in the Cenozoic) and the other one in the Ceará domain beneath the Santa Quitéria magmatic arc (a residue associated to the Brasiliano orogenesis). On the other hand, along the Cariri-Potiguar trend, the crust is thinned due to an aborted rifting in the Cretaceous. Based on the interpretation of free air anomalies, it was inferred the existence of a large magmatism in the oceanic crust surrounding the BP, in contrast with the incipient magmatism in the continent as shown by surface geology. In BP a quite important positive geoid anomaly exists. This anomaly is spatially correlated with the Borborema plateau and the Macaú-Queimadas volcanic lineament. The integrated interpretation of geoid height anomaly data, global shear velocity model, and geologic data allow to propose that and Edge Driven Convection (EDC) may have caused the Cenozoic magmatism. The EDC is an instability that presumably occurs at the boundary between thick stable lithosphere and oceanic thin lithosphere. In the BP lithosphere, the EDC mechanism would have dragged the cold lithospheric mantle into the hot asthenospheric mantle thus causing a positive density contrast that would have generated the main component of the geoid height anomaly. In addition, the compatibility of the gravity data with the isostatic model, where combined surface and buried loadings are present, together with the temporal correlation between the Cenozoic magmatism and the Borborema plateau uplifting allow to propose that this uplifting would have been caused by the buoyancy effect of a crustal root generated by a magmatic underplating in the CenozoicConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e TecnológicoA Província Borborema (PB) é um domínio geológico-estrutural localizado no Nordeste do Brasil, limitado a sul pelo Cráton do São Francisco, a oeste pela Bacia do Parnaíba e a norte e leste pelas bacias costeiras. Embora bastante estudada por geologia de superfície, na PB ainda estão em aberto aspectos importantes de sua evolução, notadamente: i) a sua compartimentagem tectônica após a Orogênese Brasiliana, ii) a arquitetura da margem continental implantada no Cretáceo, iii) as propriedades elásticas de sua litosfera, e iv) as causas do magmatismo e do soerguimento no Cenozóico. Esta Tese empregou dados geofísicos de cobertura regional (elevação, gravimetria, magnetometria, altura geoidal e tomografia), para aportar informações de geologia profunda aos problemas acima colocados. A sutura gerada pela colisão neoproterozóica entre o Domínio Sul da PB e a Placa Sanfranciscana (PSF) é marcada, na Faixa Riacho do Pontal e no oeste da Faixa Sergipana, por uma forte anomalia gravimétrica dipolar, cujo pico positivo corresponde ao alçamento da crosta inferior da PB e o negativo corresponde às nappes de supracrustais empurradas sobre a PSF. Na região leste da Faixa Sergipana não há assinaturas gravimétricas que indiquem cavalgamento e flexura de placas, mas a interpretação de truncamentos de assinaturas geofísicas de direção N-S da PSF permite localizar a sutura na margem sul do complexo de arco Marancó, ao longo da Z. C. Porto da Folha. Por sua vez, o limite colisional do Domínio Ceará da PB com o Cráton Oeste-Africano, ao longo da Z. C. Sobral-Pedro II, é também marcado por uma anomalia gravimétrica dipolar, cujo pico positivo coincide com a Z. C. Sobral-Pedro II, e o negativo coincide com o arco magmático de Santa Quitéria.
