5|$|Barn owls are {{relatively}} common {{throughout most of}} their range and not considered globally threatened. However, locally severe declines from organochlorine (e.g., DDT) poisoning in the mid-20th century and rodenticides in the late 20th century have affected some populations, particularly in Europe and North America. Intensification of agricultural practices often means that the rough grassland that provides the best foraging habitat is lost. While barn owls are prolific breeders and able to recover from short-term population decreases, {{they are not as}} common in some areas <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> A 1995–1997 survey put their British population at between 3,000 and 5,000 breeding pairs, out of an average of about 150,000 pairs in the whole of Europe. In the USA, barn owls are listed as endangered species in seven Midwestern states, and in the European Community they are considered a Species of European Concern.|$|E

A Heart cut diamond has romantic symbolism so it is a common gift for Valentine's Day or wedding anniversary. The pear-shaped diamonds look like a drop of water and the shape is suitable for diamond earrings. The most famous shapes are: Princess, Cushion, Heart, Pear, Marquise, Radiant, Asscher cut, Emerald, Oval.|$|E
25|$|During {{the last}} century of the republican government, some new churches were consecrated to SaintsPeter and Paul (on Slavna, 1367; in Kozhevniki, 1406), to Christ's Nativity (at the Cemetery, 1387), to St.John the Apostle's (1384), to the Twelve Apostles (1455), to St Demetrius (1467), to St.Simeon (1462), and other saints. Generally, they are not thought to be as {{innovative}} as the churches from the previous period. Several shrines from the 12th century (i.e., in Opoki) were demolished brick by brick and then reconstructed exactly <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> several {{of them in the}} mid-fifteenth century, again under Archbishop YevfimyII (Euthymius II), perhaps one of the greatest patrons of architecture in medieval Novgorod.|$|E
500|$|Despite decent sales, The Division Bell {{received}} mixed reviews. Tom Sinclair of Entertainment Weekly {{gave it a}} [...] "D", {{writing that}} [...] "avarice is the only conceivable explanation for this glib, vacuous cipher of an album, which is notable primarily for its stomach-turning merger of progressive-rock pomposity and New Age noodling". Rolling Stone Tom Graves criticised Gilmour's performance, stating that his guitar solos had [...] "settled into rambling, indistinct asides that are as forgettable <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> indelible ... only on 'What Do You Want from Me' does Gilmour sound like he cares". Nevertheless, the album was nominated in the 1995 Brit awards for the [...] "Best Album by a British Artist", but lost to Blur's Parklife.

Conrad's jealous seneschal interferes and visits Guillaume's family, where he gives his mother a valuable ring and gains her confidence; from her he learns that Liénor has a particular birthmark {{in the shape of a}} rose on her thigh. This knowledge is presented as proof that the seneschal has taken her virginity.|$|E

When [...] "Don't Ever Change" [...] aired on February 5, 2008, it was the final episode to air before mid-season break due to the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike. On March 25, 2008, Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune reported that House would be returning April 29, 2008. In {{an interview with the}} Chicago Tribune, House creator David Shore commented that, although the characters of Cameron and Chase are not on screen as much <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> they take on a different, and greater, weight with the [...] "stuff" [...] they are doing. [...] "No More Mr. Nice Guy" [...] was the first House episode to air after the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike. The nurses' strike in the episode was a reference to the WGA strike. In the episode Jason Lewis made a small uncredited appearance as Dr. Brock Sterling, a fictional doctor in House's favorite soap opera Prescription Passion. Lewis appeared as Evan Greer, the fictional actor who portrays Dr. Sterling, in the next episode.|$|E

2500|$|Dutch dialects and {{regional}} languages are not spoken as often <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> Although {{this is much}} less the case in Belgium (Flanders) than in the Netherlands. Recent research by Geert Driessen shows {{that the use of}} dialects {{and regional}} languages among both Dutch adults and youth is in heavy decline. In 1995, 27 percent of the Dutch adult population spoke a dialect or regional language on a regular basis, while in 2011 this was no more than 11 percent. In 1995, 12 percent of the primary school aged children spoke a dialect or regional language, while in 2011 this had declined to 4 percent. Of the officially recognized regional languages Limburgish is spoken most (in 2011 among adults 54%, among children 31%) and Dutch Low Saxon least (adults 15%, children 1%). The decline of the West Frisian language in Friesland occupies a middle position (adults 44%, children 22%). Dialects are most often spoken in rural areas, however, a lot of cities have a distinct city dialect. For example, the city of Ghent has very distinct [...] "g", [...] "e" [...] and [...] "r" [...] sounds, differing a lot from the surrounding villages. The Brussels dialect combines Brabantian with words adopted from Walloon and French.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} arrest of the Scholl {{siblings}} and Christoph Probst, newspapers published all-points bulletins in search of Alexander Schmorell. On 22 February 1943, the students of Munich were assembled, and officially protested against the [...] "traitors" [...] who came from within their ranks. Gestapo and Nazi jurisdiction documented in their files {{their view of the}} White Rose members as [...] "traitors and defeatists". On 23 February, the official newspaper of the Nazi party, [...] "Völkischer Beobachter" [...] and local newspapers in Munich briefly reported about the capture and execution of some [...] "degenerate rogues". However, the network of friends and supporters proved to be too large, so that the rumors about the White Rose could not be suppressed any more by Nazi German officials. Until the end of World War II, further prosecutions took place, and German newspapers continued to report, mostly in brief notes, that further people had been arrested and punished. On 15 March 1943, a report by the Sicherheitsdienst of the Schutzstaffel stated that rumors about the leaflets spread [...] "considerable unrest" [...] amongst the German population. The report expressed particular concern about the fact that leaflets were not handed in to the Nazi authorities by their finders as promptly <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in the past.|$|E

2500|$|Despite leaving Apple as {{a day-to-day}} {{employee}} in 1985, Wozniak chose to never remove {{himself from the}} official employee list, and continues to represent the company at events or in interviews. Today he receives a stipend from Apple for this role, estimated to be $120,000 per year. He is also an Apple shareholder. He maintained a friendly acquaintance with Steve Jobs until Jobs' death in October 2011, however, in 2006, Wozniak stated that he and Jobs were not as close <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> In a 2013 interview, Wozniak said that the original Macintosh [...] "failed" [...] under Steve Jobs, {{and that it was}} not until Jobs left that it became a success. He called the Apple Lisa group the team that had kicked Jobs out, and that Jobs liked to call the Lisa group [...] "idiots for making [...] too expensive". To compete with the Lisa, Jobs and his new team produced a cheaper computer, one that, according to Wozniak, was [...] "weak", [...] "lousy" [...] and [...] "still at a fairly high price". [...] "He made it by cutting the RAM down, by forcing you to swap disks here and there", says Wozniak. He attributed the eventual success of the Macintosh to people like John Sculley [...] "who worked to build a Macintosh market when the Apple II went away".|$|E
2500|$|In the U.S. {{reviews of}} Brothers in Arms were more positive. Writing for Spin magazine, E. Brooks noted that [...] "Mark Knopfler {{may be the}} most lyrical of all rock guitarists, and when the {{intensity}} of his words approaches that of his ravishing stratocaster licks, the song soars. That doesn't happen as often as I'd like on this new album by a band I've cared about for a long time, but I find myself returning to certain cuts the way one might come back to a favorite chair." [...] He singled out the [...] "haunting ballad" [...] "Your Latest Trick", the [...] "acerbic satire of vid-rock culture" [...] in [...] "Money for Nothing" [...] and the [...] "outstanding craftsmanship in the words and music" [...] of the title track, which was [...] "not a new message, but at least something other than sex, cars, or drugs is being talked about here. Take that {{and the quality of the}} musicianship, and you've got a lot." [...] Debby Bull gave the album a mixed review for Rolling Stone magazine, praising the [...] "carefully crafted" [...] effort, writing, [...] "The record is beautifully produced, with Mark Knopfler's terrific guitar work catching the best light". Although she found the lyrics literate, Bull noted that the scenarios [...] "aren't as interesting <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> on records like Making Movies". Despite the production values and notable contributions from guest artists like drummer Omar Hakim and the Brecker Brothers, Bull concluded that [...] "the music lacks the ache that made Knopfler's recent soundtracks for Comfort and Joy and Cal so powerful." [...] In Rolling Stones end-of-year round-up of 1985's key albums, Fred Schruers said that [...] "Knopfler's nimble, evocative guitar style and gentle vocalizing are still as appealing as the were on previous scenario-rich albums".|$|E
