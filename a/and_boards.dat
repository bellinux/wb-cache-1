5|$|Afterwards Bond visits Valentin Zukovsky at {{a casino}} to acquire {{information}} about Elektra's attackers; he discovers that Elektra's head of security, Davidov, is secretly {{in league with}} Renard. Bond kills Davidov <b>and</b> <b>boards</b> a plane bound for a Russian ICBM base in Kazakhstan. He poses as a Russian nuclear scientist, meets American nuclear physicist Christmas Jones, and enters the silo. Inside, Renard is removing the GPS locator card and weapons-grade plutonium from a nuclear bomb. Before Bond can kill him, Jones blows his cover. Renard drops a hint that he and Elektra are collaborating and flees with the plutonium, while Bond and Jones escape the exploding silo with the locator card.|$|E
5|$|During {{his stay}} in Jerusalem, Umar {{was led by}} Sophronius to various holy sites, {{including}} the Temple Mount. Seeing the poor state of where the Temple once stood, Umar ordered the area cleared of refuse and debris before having a wooden mosque built on the site. The earliest account of such a structure is given by the Gallic bishop Arculf, who visited Jerusalem between 679 and 682, and describes a very primitive house of prayer able to accommodate up to 3,000 worshippers, constructed of wooden beams <b>and</b> <b>boards</b> over pre-existing ruins.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after taking}} over, Srinivasa Sastri {{successfully}} pressurized the South African government to withdraw Section 5 of the Immigration and Indian Relief (Further Provision) Bill which empowered South African immigration officers <b>and</b> <b>boards</b> to cancel registration certificates. Through his efforts, the Natal Commission for Indian Education was appointed on 17 November 1927. With Sastri's support and encouragement, dissidents of the Transvaal British Indian Association (TBIA) founded the Transvaal Indian Congress (TIC) on 18 December 1927. The TBIA later {{merged with the}} South African Indian Congress. Section 104 of the Liquor Bill prohibiting Indians from entering licensed premises was withdrawn.

5|$|The Reed & Smith group (which {{acquired}} New Taplow Mill in 1950) {{became one}} of the biggest papermakers in the UK. A Fourdrinier machine was installed in 1892 and continued to make paper at Higher Kings until about 1972. A new machine was built in 1956 to make blue sugar bags and other products, and has been modified over the years to make different grades of paper and card. St Regis acquired Higher Kings in the early 1980s and since then the mill has diversified into making a wide range of recycled coloured papers <b>and</b> <b>boards.</b> It is now owned by Asia File Corporation.|$|E
5|$|To get a lead {{on where}} Renard might be hiding, Bond visits a former Russian mafia adversary, Valentin Zukovsky, who reveals that Elektra was in {{exchange}} for the use of a submarine currently being captained by his nephew. Jones realises that if Renard were to insert the stolen plutonium into the submarine's nuclear reactor, the resulting nuclear explosion would destroy Istanbul, sabotaging the Russians' oil pipeline in the Bosphorus. In Istanbul, Bond and Jones are captured by Elektra's henchmen. Jones is taken aboard the submarine, while Bond is taken to the Maiden's Tower. With the help of Zukovsky, Bond kills Elektra <b>and</b> <b>boards</b> the submarine. Ultimately, Bond finds Renard in the submarine's reactor and kills him before escaping with Jones.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{aimed to}} examine the {{relationship}} between four corporate governance mechanisms (board size, board independent director, chief executive officer duality <b>and</b> <b>board</b> audit committee) <b>and</b> value of the firm (performance) measures (return on assets, ROA and return on equity, ROE). The paper is based on a sample of 93 listed non-financial companies in Dhaka Stock Exchanges (DSE) 2006. Using OLS as a method of estimation, the results provide evidence of a positive significant relationship between ROA <b>and</b> <b>board</b> independent director as well as chief executive officer duality. The results further reveal a positive significant relationship between ROE <b>and</b> <b>board</b> independent director as well as chief executive officer duality.

40|$|International audienceIn {{this study}} {{migration}} investigations with different spiked and non-spiked paper <b>and</b> <b>board</b> packaging {{materials in contact}} with foodstuffs and food simulants in the temperature range between - 18 °C and 40 °C were carried out. The aim was to deepen {{the understanding of the}} migration behaviour of target substances in paper <b>and</b> <b>board</b> fibres. Components <b>and</b> contaminants of paper <b>and</b> <b>board</b> with different molecular weight and chemical structure were selected as target migrants. From the kinetic migration studies diffusion and partition coefficients were derived by using a software for modelling migration in multilayer materials. On the basis of these results {{for the first time a}} model for the migration from paper <b>and</b> <b>board</b> into foods <b>and</b> simulants was developed by adapting the validated diffusion model for plastics. In contrast to the migration in plastic materials, where the migrants are solved and homogenously distributed in the polymer matrix, mass transfer in paper <b>and</b> <b>board</b> is a more complex phenomenon, because the migrants can be adsorbed on the cellulose surface with different strength. The most important finding of the study was that for a correct modelling of the experimental results in many cases paper <b>and</b> <b>board</b> must be regarded as a 2 -layer system: the main mass of paper <b>and</b> <b>board</b> (B 1) defines the core layer with high diffusion rates and a thin second layer (B 2) represents the surface region of the paper <b>and</b> <b>board</b> with decreased diffusion rates due to the slow desorption...|$|R

Bond takes Orlov's car, drives it along the train tracks <b>and</b> <b>boards</b> the moving circus train. Orlov gives chase, but is killed at the border by East German guards, after they mistake Orlov for a defector. Bond kills the twin knife-throwing assassins Mischka and Grischka to avenge the murder of 009, and, after falling from the train, commandeers a car to get to the airbase. Bond penetrates the base, and disguises himself as a clown to evade the West German police.

5|$|Villermé’s Tableau {{discussed}} {{the role of}} industrialization on the general health {{and quality of life}} for the laboring class. His perspective in this work is unique in that he maintained that the process of industrialization is not completely to blame. He even suggested the industrial movement to be beneficial for the future of society, calling on examples of industrialization in the United States. He also {{discussed the}} role of children working in the textile industry. The point is made that, in some cases, {{at least half of the}} workforce in a textile factory was made up of the children of textile workers, many under the age of eighteen. Villermé contrasted the quality of life of workers who maintained family life with those taken over completely by their labor. He blamed both the working conditions associated with industrialization as well as the workers themselves to an extent. This work served not only as valuable information to medical institutions <b>and</b> <b>boards,</b> but also as a social statement, widely accepted by the public.

5|$|Despite the {{perceived}} improbability of landfall {{in the days}} preceding the storm's passage, the West Palm Beach chapter of the American Red Cross began preparing for the storm. Dr. William J. Buck, likely the only doctor between Pahokee and Moore Haven and also president of the Belle Glade town council {{and the founder of}} the town's American Legion post, was skeptical of the Weather Bureau's predictions of the storm missing South Florida. He and his legionnaires warned residents in the Lake Okeechobee region of the approaching cyclone. At South Bay, Frank Schuster made several car trips to save 211 people by transporting them to higher ground. The Seminoles at the Brighton Seminole Indian Reservation in Glades County evacuated to higher ground after observing retreating wildlife. Hours before the storm made landfall, many in the communities surrounding Lake Okeechobee either crowded into a house or evacuated to the building they believed was securest, such as the Belle Glade Hotel, the Glades Hotel, and Henry Martin's store in Belle Glade, with the Glades Hotel sheltering 20 people and the Belle Glade Hotel having nearly 150 refugees. About 500 people in Lake Worth were sheltered inside the Gulf Stream Hotel during the storm. In West Palm Beach, food and thousands of candles, kerosene lamps, <b>and</b> <b>boards</b> were sold on September 16. A number of residents boarded up their homes and then secured their ornamental trees and plants. At the building then being used as the Palm Beach County Courthouse, approximately 500 people sought shelter inside. In Jupiter, 20 people sought refuge in a grocery store, while 25 others stayed at a newly constructed elementary school. A number of African Americans took shelter in a school building in West Jupiter.|$|E

After Max threatens him with torture, Van Der Mescht explains that I Corporation was a rival of Manticore, and had a military contract for more aggressive genetic research. They created a 'Y' series of genetically engineered soldiers (as opposed to Manticore's 'X' series); when Max and Beka were born, Beka was taken by I Corporation so that the two different series could be compared. I Corporation guards ambush the room, killing Van Der Mescht before he can divulge more. I Corporation send a single soldier, a transgenic boss named Bear, to kill Max. Bear is defeated, and Max reaches the I Corporation headquarters with the train. Max fights {{her way to the}} upper level of the headquarters, defeating guards and the boss characters Beetle, Gekko and Bear again, before she confronts Beka. Beka reveals that she now controls the I Corporation, and has engineered a younger replacement to succeed her using the DNA that she and Max shares. She tries to recruit Max to join her and their 'younger sister' in creating a new generation of genetically engineered soldiers. Max refuses and Beka attacks her. After killing Beka, Max tries to rescue her younger sister. The cloaked figure, whose identity is never revealed, tries unsuccessfully to stop her. Logan arrives in a helicopter and rescues Max and her younger sister from the complex. Later, while sitting {{on the roof of the}} Space Needle, Max laments that knowing the truth about Beka is worse than not knowing at all, but is determined to create a positive life for herself and her younger sister.

Ownership <b>and</b> <b>board</b> changes are strongly related to top executive turnover, prior stock price performance, and corporate control threats, but only weakly related to changes in "rm-speci"c determinants of ownership <b>and</b> <b>board</b> structure.
