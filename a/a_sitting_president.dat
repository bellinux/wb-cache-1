5|$|As <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>president,</b> Reagan did {{not have}} the highest {{approval}} ratings, but his popularity has increased since 1989. Gallup polls in 2001 and 2007 ranked him number one or number two when correspondents were asked for the greatest president in history. Reagan ranked third of post–World War II presidents in a 2007 Rasmussen Reports poll, fifth in an ABC 2000 poll, ninth in another 2007 Rasmussen poll, and eighth in a late 2008 poll by British newspaper The Times. In a Siena College survey of over 200 historians, however, Reagan ranked sixteenth out of 42. While the debate about Reagan's legacy is ongoing, the 2009 Annual C-SPAN Survey of Presidential Leaders ranked Reagan the 10th greatest president. The survey of leading historians rated Reagan number 11 in 2000.|$|E

25|$|Millard Fillmore (January 7, 1800 – March 8, 1874) was the 13th President of the United States, serving from 1850 until 1853.

25|$|The Poor Law Commission was {{abolished}} {{following the}} Andover workhouse scandal. Tensions among Commissioners {{meant that the}} central administration of the system needed to change. The New Poor Law Board had <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>President,</b> usually a Cabinet Minister, so that the Board could be both accountable to Parliament and more responsive to its wishes. The Local Government Board took {{over the role of}} the Poor Law Board after the passing of the Second Great Reform Act. The Reform Act enfranchised a greater number of people meaning that Parliament became more concerned with welfare.|$|E
25|$|On January 30, 1835, what is {{believed}} to be the first attempt to kill <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>President</b> of the United States occurred just outside the United States Capitol. When Jackson was leaving through the East Portico after the funeral of South Carolina Representative Warren R. Davis, Richard Lawrence, an unemployed house painter from England, aimed a pistol at Jackson, which misfired. Lawrence then pulled out a second pistol, which also misfired. Historians believe the humid weather contributed to the double misfiring. Jackson, infuriated, attacked Lawrence with his cane. Others present, including DavyCrockett, restrained and disarmed Lawrence.|$|E

25|$|Under Art. 54 (3) and 65 (3) of the constitution, the President {{may not be}} {{held liable}} for any alleged {{criminal}} acts while executing the duties of office. Such prosecution may not occur either while the president is in office or at any time thereafter. Furthermore, Art 65 (1) prevents trial or detention for prosecution of a criminal offense or tort while in office. The only sort of prosecution allowed for <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>President</b> is that of high treason, which can only be carried out by the Senate, and can only result in removal from office and a ban on regaining the office at a later date.|$|E
25|$|Initially, no {{prominent}} Democratic {{candidate was}} prepared to run against <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>president</b> of the Democratic Party. Only Senator Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota challenged Johnson as an anti-war candidate in the New Hampshire primary, hoping to pressure the Democrats to oppose the Vietnam War. On March 12, McCarthy won 42percent of the primary vote to Johnson's 49percent, an amazingly strong showing for such a challenger. Four days later, Sen. Robert F. Kennedy of New York entered the race. Internal polling by Johnson's campaign in Wisconsin, the next state to hold a primary election, showed the President trailing badly. Johnson did not leave the White House to campaign.|$|E
25|$|On January 30, 1835, what is {{believed}} to be the first attempt to kill <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>President</b> of the United States occurred just outside the United States Capitol. When President Andrew Jackson was leaving the Capitol out of the East Portico after the funeral of South Carolina Representative Warren R. Davis, Richard Lawrence, an unemployed and deranged housepainter from England, either burst from a crowd or stepped out from hiding behind a column and aimed a pistol at Jackson which misfired. Lawrence then pulled out a second pistol which also misfired. It has since been postulated that the moisture from the humid weather of the day contributed to the double misfiring. Lawrence was then restrained, with legend saying that Jackson attacked Lawrence with his cane, prompting his aides to restrain him. Others present, including Davy Crockett, restrained and disarmed Lawrence.|$|E

25|$|Graham served {{briefly as}} {{pastor of the}} First Baptist Church in Western Springs, Illinois, not far from Wheaton, in 1943–44. While there, his friend , pastor of the Midwest Bible Church in , told Graham that his radio program, Songs in the Night, {{was about to be}} {{canceled}} due to lack of funding. Consulting with the members of his church in Western Springs, Graham decided to take over Johnson's program with financial support from his congregation. Launching the new radio program on January 2, 1944, still called Songs in the Night, Graham recruited the bass-baritone George Beverly Shea as his director of radio ministry. While the radio ministry continued for many years, Graham decided to move on in early 1945. In 1947, at age 30, he was hired as president of Northwestern Bible College in Minneapolis—at the time, the youngest person to serve as <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>president</b> of any U.S. college or university. Graham served as the president from 1948 to 1952.|$|E
25|$|In December 2001, CVW-14 {{participated in}} Operation Northern Edge {{off the coast}} of {{southern}} Alaska, honing their skills in final preparations for the 2002–2003 deployment. CVW-14 deployed aboard USS Abraham Lincoln again on 22 July 2002, supporting both on Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and Operation Iraqi Freedom in Iraq. This marked the first carrier deployment for the multi-mission F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet. In the first 17 days of Operation Iraqi Freedom, CVW-14 aircraft dropped more than 1.3 million pounds of ordnance in support of the war. Prior to returning home, President George W. Bush made his historic landing on the deck of USS Abraham Lincoln in a S-3 piloted by CVW-14's own VS-35 Blue Wolves. This marked the first time <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>President</b> landed on a carrier in a fixed-wing aircraft and the first time a United States Navy aircraft radio callsign was changed to Navy One. CVW-14 returned home 6 May 2003 after nearly 10 months on deployment, the longest for a carrier in three decades.|$|E
25|$|In October 1967, {{a private}} meeting was {{arranged}} between Parrish and Bobby Kennedy by mutual friend and well-known Kennedy photographer, Stanley Tretick. She begged Bobby {{to run for president}} telling him that huge, influential organizations opposed to the war in Vietnam were ready to support him if he ran. Kennedy refused again and again, saying he could not oppose Lyndon Johnson, <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>president.</b> On November 30, Eugene McCarthy, a brilliant yet little-known senator, declared he would run against the war and challenge Johnson. Parrish was elected chair of his speaker's bureau and utilized STOP! to develop support for McCarthy. On March 12, 1968, McCarthy almost defeated Johnson in the New Hampshire primary winning 42% of the vote. On March 16 (four days later) Bobby Kennedy announced that he would run for president. Two weeks later, on March 31, Johnson declared that he would not run again for president. Parrish remained loyal to McCarthy and was elected a delegate to represent him in August at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago.|$|E
