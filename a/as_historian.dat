5|$|This {{alliance}} {{was probably}} a weakly centralized state, with a military organization {{similar to the one}} of the Hellenistic Kingdoms. The exact degree of centralization is a matter of debate, with archaeologists, such as archeologist Kris Lockyear, denying the existence of a state, because the archaeological evidence shows regional diversity and only a few region-wide trends. Others, such <b>as</b> <b>historian</b> Alexandru Diaconescu, dispute this and conclude that there was a centralized political structure.|$|E

5|$|At first, the dissenting deputies {{were often}} {{convinced}} or cowed back to withdraw their objections. Also, at first, the rule {{was used to}} strike down only individual laws, not to dissolve the chamber and throw out all measures passed. For example, <b>as</b> <b>historian</b> Władysław Czapliński describes in the Sejm of 1611 context, some resolutions were struck down, but others passed. From the mid-17th century onward, however, an objection to any item of Sejm legislation from a deputy or senator automatically caused other, earlier adopted legislation to be rejected. That was because all legislation that was adopted by a given Sejm formed a whole.|$|E

The Company thought it unlikely that a Matabele inDuna would simply invent a story such as this, however, and angrily speculated that if it were true, then negotiations with Lobengula might have been opened and the war ended before Wilson crossed the river, and the entire episode of the Shangani Patrol avoided (though, <b>as</b> <b>historian</b> Robert Cary writes, this surmision ignores the fact that Forbes had been ordered to capture Lobengula, not end the war).

5|$|The Soviet Union {{supported}} the Vietnamese in their 1978 invasion of Cambodia, an invasion {{considered by the}} First World, most notably the United States, and the People's Republic of China {{to be under the}} direct command of the Soviet Union. The USSR also became the largest backer of the new puppet state in Cambodia, the People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK). In a 1979 summit Jimmy Carter complained to Brezhnev about the presence of Vietnamese troops in Cambodia, to which Brezhnev replied that the citizens of the PRK were delighted about the overthrow of the Khmer Rouge-led government; in this, <b>as</b> <b>historian</b> Archie Brown notes, he was right.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>historian</b> Dariusz Stola notes, the anti-Jewish {{campaign}} combined century-old conspiracy theories, recycled antisemitic {{claims and}} classic communist propaganda. Regarding the tailoring of the Żydokomuna sentiment to communist Poland, Stola suggested: Paradoxically, {{probably the most}} powerful slogan of the communist propaganda in March was the accusation that the Jews were zealous communists. They were blamed for a major part, if not all, of the crimes and horrors of the Stalinist period. The myth of Judeo-Bolshevism had been well known in Poland since the Russian revolution and the Polish-Bolshevik war of 1920, yet its 1968 model deserves interest {{as a tool of}} communist propaganda. This accusation exploited and developed the popular stereotype of Jewish communism to purify communism: the Jews were the dark side of communism; what was wrong in communism was due to them.|$|E
5|$|Henry is {{generally}} credited with initiating the English Reformation – {{the process of}} transforming England from a Catholic country to a Protestant one – though his progress at the elite and mass levels is disputed, and the precise narrative not widely agreed. Certainly, in 1527, Henry, until then an observant and well-informed Catholic, appealed to the Pope for an annulment of his marriage to Catherine. No annulment was immediately forthcoming, the result in part of Charles V's control of the Papacy. The traditional narrative gives this refusal as the trigger for Henry's rejection of papal supremacy (which he had previously defended), though <b>as</b> <b>historian</b> A. F. Pollard has argued, even if Henry had not needed an annulment, Henry may have come to reject papal control over the governance of England purely for political reasons.|$|E

5|$|In April 1896, Chile ordered another armored cruiser, , and six torpedo boats. Naval {{historian}} Robert Scheina {{states that}} Argentina replied {{in the same}} month with , a near-sister ship to Garibaldi which was under construction in Italy. However, {{he notes that the}} small time lapse between the orders makes it difficult or impossible to know if this, the opposite, or either are true. <b>As</b> <b>historian</b> Jonathan Grant writes, the Argentines may have moved first to secure a definite, if momentarily tenuous, advantage over the Chilean Navy. In May 1898, the Chilean government found that the Argentines were planning on acquiring one, then two, Garibaldi-class cruisers. With tensions extremely high and war seemingly imminent, the two countries agreed to submit their boundary disputes to the British, which led to the Cordillera of the Andes Boundary Case 1902 (Argentina, Chile). They also signed pacts which led to the resolution of the Puna de Atacama dispute. As the former arbitration took much time, the naval arms race, though it slacked during the time of eased tension which came with the agreements, continued.|$|E
5|$|In {{a review}} for Times Higher Education, Jack Harris says that Walker is an {{extremely}} good writer and even {{those who do not}} specialise in technical fields will derive enjoyment from the book. According to Harris, Walker has unique experience <b>as</b> <b>historian</b> to the NRC which has placed him in an unrivalled position to tell the TMI story. But Harris identifies some omissions in the book. There is little on the other two major nuclear that threatened large civilian populations: the Windscale fire (UK, October 1957), and the Chernobyl disaster (Ukraine, April 1986). Harris states that Windscale threw up similar problems to TMI, particularly relating to whether large-scale evacuations should have been initiated, but he could find no reference to the Windscale accident in the book's index which is surprising in a book that aims to put TMI in historical perspective.|$|E
5|$|In the 1190s, {{however, the}} {{struggle}} for power in France began to swing in favour of Philip II, culminating in the Capetian capture of Normandy in 1204. Philip II started to construct completely circular keeps, such as the Tour Jeanne d'Arc, with most built in his newly acquired territories. The first of Philip's new keeps was begun at the Louvre in 1190 and at least another twenty followed, all built to a consistent standard and cost. The architectural idea of circular keeps {{may have come from}} Catalonia, where circular towers in castles formed a local tradition, and probably carried some military advantages, but Philip's intention in building these new keeps in a fresh style was clearly political, an attempt to demonstrate his new power and authority over his extended territories. <b>As</b> <b>historian</b> Philippe Durand suggests, these keeps provided military security and were a physical representation of the renouveau capétien, or Capetian renewal.|$|E

5|$|It {{was between}} these two groups that, after Elizabeth's death in 1603, a new, more savage episode of the Reformation {{was in the process}} of gestation. During the reigns of the Stuart kings, James I and Charles I, the battle lines were to become more defined, leading {{ultimately}} to the English Civil War, the first on English soil to engulf parts of the civilian population. The war was only partly about religion, but the abolition of prayer book and episcopacy by a Puritan Parliament was an element in the causes of the conflict. <b>As</b> <b>historian</b> MacCulloch has noted, the legacy of these tumultuous events can be recognised, throughout the Commonwealth (1649–60) and the Restoration that followed it, and beyond. This third party was to become the core of the restored Church of England, but at the price for further division.|$|E
5|$|The {{widespread}} use of Christian symbolism led to questions about how to produce memorials suitable for non-Christians. Lutyens attempted {{to solve this problem}} for the IWGC through the design of the Stone of Remembrance, or War Stone. This was a large, simple stone, intended to resemble an altar and evoke the theme of sacrifice. In practice, many commentators felt it resembled a sarcophagus. Lutyens wanted it to avoid conventional Christian symbolism and based it on designs in Chinese Ming tombs. One of Lutyens' arguments in favour of his design was that explicit Christian symbolism excluded the Indian and Jewish communities and atheists. The IWGC designs for the Indian and Chinese war cemeteries in Europe deliberately did not use Christian imagery – although, <b>as</b> <b>historian</b> Xu Guoqi notes, the Chinese role in the Allied armies remains largely uncommemorated through memorials.|$|E
5|$|The motte-and-bailey castle is a {{particularly}} northern European phenomenon, most numerous in Normandy and Britain, but also seen in Denmark, Germany, Southern Italy and occasionally beyond. European castles first emerged in the 9th and 10th centuries, {{after the fall of}} the Carolingian Empire resulted in its territory being divided among individual lords and princes and local territories became threatened by the Magyars and the Norse. Against this background, various explanations have been put forward to explain the origins and spread of the motte-and-bailey design across northern Europe; there is often a tension among the academic community between explanations that stress military and social reasons for the rise of this design. One suggestion is that these castles were built particularly in order to protect against external attack– the Angevins, it is argued, began to build them to protect against the Viking raids, and the design spread to deal with the attacks along the Slav and Hungarian frontiers. Another argument is that, given the links between this style of castle and the Normans, who were of Viking descent, it was in fact originally a Viking design, transported to Normandy and Angers. The motte-and-bailey castle was certainly effective against assault, although <b>as</b> <b>historian</b> André Debord suggests, the historical and archaeological record of the military operation of motte-and-bailey castles remains relatively limited.|$|E
