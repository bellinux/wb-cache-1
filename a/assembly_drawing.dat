50|$|In 2006, The American Assembly's Next Generation Project {{set out to}} {{discover}} fresh perspectives about US global policy by identifying and engaging the best emerging young talent {{from a wide range}} of vocations and regions of the country growing in economic and political importance. The American Assembly convened three-day meetings in Dallas for the Southwest, San Diego for the West Coast, Denver for the Mountain States, and Chicago for the Midwest. Nearly 300 of the country's brightest emerging leaders with a diverse range of views and interests, from multiple professional, geographic, and demographic backgrounds, were identified as Next Generation Project Fellows and participated in the Assemblies. Young businesspeople from cutting-edge biotech and information technology firms, leaders from NGOs, the media, religious organizations, and the military actively participated. Rising stars from the UN, the IMF, and the World Bank, and decision-makers from the Department of State, the Department of Defense, and the National Security Council all participated, as well as political leaders from the state and local level. A National <b>Assembly,</b> <b>drawing</b> drawing on fellows from preceding Assemblies, was held in Washington, DC, as the culminating program in the series.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} reduce the time of {{mechanical}} product design and ensure the high quality of their assembly drawings, this paper develops an intelligent approach for generating assembly drawings automatically from three-dimensional (3 -D) computer assembly models of mechanical products by simulating the experienced human designer's thinking mode with the aid of computer graphics and knowledge-based expert system. The key issues include the strategies and methods for selecting the necessary views in an <b>assembly</b> <b>drawing,</b> determining necessary sectional views in each view, eliminating the unreasonable projective overlap of the components in each view, and minimizing the numbers of both the views in an <b>assembly</b> <b>drawing</b> and the sectional views in each view. Based on the approach, corresponding software prototype was developed. Finally, it is demonstrated, from an example of the fixture in a modularized drilling machine, that its <b>assembly</b> <b>drawing</b> was generated successfully using this intelligent software prototype. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

These tasks included modeling a part when given the object {{in the context of an}} <b>assembly</b> <b>drawing,</b> modeling a part when given an isometric pictorial of the object, and finally modeling a part when given a detail drawing of the object. Research questions for this study include the following: Does a simpler rubric provide similar scores as the previous rubric? Is there a relationship between a student’s spatial visualization ability and their ability to model a part from a pictorial, <b>assembly</b> <b>drawing</b> or detail drawing? Is the MCT still a better predictor of a student’s modeling success than the PSVT:R? Scores evaluated based on the simplified rubric were significantly higher than the scores evaluated based on the original rubric for the part modeled from the <b>assembly</b> <b>drawing.</b> This study revealed significant positive correlations between each modeling task and the two spatial visualization tests...|$|E

We conclude that existing arrangements and practices are a useful development but fall far short of the radical measures needed to overcome the exclusionary nature of traditional models of governance and government. ...|$|R
