About 50. 83 % of total respondents were found to belong under the age group above 19 yrs and below 40 yrs. About 36. 25 % were belonging to the Scheduled caste category. Illiteracy was found one of the major problems of the studied area as about 34. 16 % respondents were found to be illiterate.

Additionally, {{the first season}} of Rick and Morty holds a Metacritic score of 85 based on eight reviews, indicating [...] "universal acclaim". David Weigand of San Francisco Chronicle described it as [...] "offbeat and occasionally coarse... the take-away {{here is that it}} works". He praised the animation direction by James McDermott for being [...] "fresh, colorful and as wacky as the script", and states that the series possesses [...] "shades of Futurama, South Park and even Beetlejuice", ultimately opining that its humor felt [...] "entirely original". Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times praised the series and stated that it was [...] "Grandparenting at its unhinged finest." [...] Todd Spangler of Variety gave the series a lukewarm review; while he found the series was passable, he contrasted it with other Adult Swim series as [...] "often seems overly reliant on simply being frenetic at the expense of being witty" [...] and enjoyed it as [...] "a welcome attempt to dream just <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bigger". David Sims of The A.V. Club gave the series an [...] "A−". In reviewing the first two episodes, he complimented the animation for its [...] "clean, simple style". He stated that while the series has [...] "a dark, sick sensibility", he praised its [...] "effort to give each character <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of depth", <b>further</b> applauding Roiland's voice talent for the eponymous characters.|$|R

500|$|Both [...] "Happy Working Song" [...] and [...] "That's How You Know" [...] {{also pay}} tributes to past Disney songs. [...] "Happy Working Song" [...] pays a lyrical homage to such songs as [...] "Whistle While You Work" [...] (Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs), [...] "The Work Song" [...] (Cinderella) [...] "A Spoonful of Sugar" [...] (Mary Poppins) and “Making Christmas” (The Nightmare Before Christmas), and a musical {{homage to the}} Sherman Brothers (with a self-parodic [...] "Alan Menken style" [...] middle eight). [...] "That's How You Know" [...] is a self-parody of Menken's {{compositions}} for his Disney features, specifically such big production numbers as [...] "Under the Sea" [...] (The Little Mermaid) and [...] "Be Our Guest" [...] (Beauty and the Beast). To achieve this, Schwartz admitted he had to [...] "push it <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>further</b> in terms of choices of words or certain lyrics" [...] while maintaining [...] "the classic Walt Disney sensibility". However, Menken noted that the songs he has written for Disney have always been [...] "a little tongue-in-cheek". As the film progresses, the music uses more contemporary styles, which is heard through the adult ballad [...] "So Close" [...] and the country/pop number [...] "Ever Ever After" [...] (sung by Carrie Underwood as a voice-over).|$|E
500|$|This {{episode is}} the first to deal with the concept of time travel, the next being [...] "The Constant" [...] in the fourth season. Unlike other {{flashback}} sequences to this point, this is positioned as actual time travel for Desmond. However, in this episode ground rules are established to prevent paradoxes in the story line as a result of time travel. Had these rules not been established, the writers feared that viewers would lose interest because the stakes of the characters would be lessened. In an interview, Henry Ian Cusick, who plays Desmond, said shooting the episode was both [...] "fun" [...] and [...] "tiring". Cusick said that when shooting the episode [...] "you're finishing late and starting early", but he enjoyed working with director Jack Bender because [...] "he pushes you to, to try and go <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>further</b> than you think you can". The London scenes were shot in Honolulu. This led to several continuity errors, such as a British Army recruitment poster for a Scottish regiment (which would not recruit in England) featuring the word [...] "Honour" [...] being incorrectly spelled in the American English [...] "Honor" [...] and a photograph of a British soldier using an American M4 carbine and urging people to join the [...] "military" [...] (instead of the [...] "army", as a British poster would say).|$|E

500|$|In {{order to}} create the Night King, {{according}} to Barrie Gower, it is primarily practical prosthetic, but also incorporates some VFX {{to create a more}} icy look and feel, saying about the eyes, [...] "The effects department alters the eyes in post-production. They give them that blue-glowy hue to them, which we can't really achieve with contact lenses." [...] In regards to the overall prosthetic, [...] "they've added this sort of icy layer over the top of him to create this — it's something incredibly difficult to achieve practically, prosthetics are cast in a translucent rubber, which can only give you so much of that icy quality, so visual effects help augment it <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>further</b> to give it more dimension." [...] Prior to the sixth season, the Night King was portrayed by Richard Brake, with a head mold of Brake being created in order to accurately mold the prosthetic to his face. In the sixth season he was portrayed by Vladimir Furdik. The White Walker army was first shot in front of a green screen in Magheramorne quarry, and according to a piece in The Hollywood Reporter [...] "A scan was taken from a drone and used as the basis for a CG model of the location, which was augmented with VFX and joined with volcanic hills that were photographed in Iceland." [...] Crowd replication was used to create the 1,000-man army, with special effects supervisor Joe Bauer saying [...] "It's scans of those actors in the makeup and costumes, with variations we used to make a digital army that extends up onto the hills." [...] Bauer also noted that VFX were used to create the weather conditions in the scene, noting [...] "It's wind, mist, fog and heavy atmosphere that you'd get in a marine layer. The dramatic value is to say something's wrong; it's a mystery what they are facing. The temperature drops, and our characters can see their breath. The weather obscures their vision." [...] Spain-based El Ranchito, one of several special effects companies used by Game of Thrones, was responsible for the White Walker army shots.|$|E
