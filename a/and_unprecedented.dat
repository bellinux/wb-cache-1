5|$|In 602 the Roman army {{campaigning in}} the Balkans mutinied under the {{leadership}} of Phocas, who succeeded in seizing the throne and then killed Maurice and his family. Khosrau II used the murder of his benefactor as a pretext for war. In {{the early years of the}} war the Persians enjoyed overwhelming <b>and</b> <b>unprecedented</b> success. They were aided by Khosrau's use of a pretender claiming to be Maurice's son, and by the revolt against Phocas led by the Roman general Narses.* GreatrexLieu (2002), II, 183184 In 603 Khosrau defeated and killed the Roman general Germanus in Mesopotamia and laid siege to Dara. Despite the arrival of Roman reinforcements from Europe, he won another victory in 604, while Dara fell after a nine-month siege. Over the following years the Persians gradually overcame the fortress cities of Mesopotamia by siege, one after another.* GreatrexLieu (2002), II, 185186 At the same time they won a string of victories in Armenia and systematically subdued the Roman garrisons in the Caucasus.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} architecture, the church {{features}} a round dome {{and a single}} apse. The naos or cella has {{the shape of a}} cross, in line with the popular Byzantine cross-in-square design. Of particular interest is the formerly two-storey narthex, which is notable for its unusual verticality and the towers {{on either side of the}} entrance. Judging by the models depicted in the donor's portraits inside the church, it is clear that the towers were originally further apart and the west facade with the narthex included much woodwork. The towers are topped off by sharp-pointed pyramidal elements, with additional sharp-pointed details in each of the pyramids' four corners. The towers and their design are entirely unusual <b>and</b> <b>unprecedented</b> in medieval Bulgarian church architecture. Art historian Nikola Mavrodinov believes these resemble Gothic architecture, though a more modern researcher, Bistra Nikolova, dismisses his assessment and considers these an influence from Hungary or Transylvania.|$|E
5|$|In general, the USACE {{credited}} existing {{flood control}} projects as preventing additional flooding. In West Virginia alone, {{it was estimated}} that existing flood-control projects saved about $135million in damage. Lake Moomaw in western Virginia helped prevent $70million in damage along the James River. In Pennsylvania, flood measures resulted in minimal flooding along the Youghiogheny River. After sustaining damage from flooding along the Monongahela River with little warning, the owners of a marina filed a class action lawsuit in the Court of Common Pleas of Washington County on November21, 1985, against West Penn Power Company to compensate for damages. The plaintiffs believed that the damage occurred because the company opened the flood gates of the Lake Lynn Dam. The power company attempted to move the case to the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania in March 1986, citing the Federal Power Act's provision that claims should be in the District Court, but the nature of the suit sent it back to the Court of Common Pleas, bringing it to trial in September 1989. The jury found that although the West Penn Power was negligent, the damage was caused mainly by the historic <b>and</b> <b>unprecedented</b> flooding; consequently, the case entered a compulsory nonsuit, meaning the company was not required to pay compensation. The plaintiffs sought an appeal in 1990, which was denied.|$|E

Roman expansion marks the transition in the Mediterranean from prehistory (around 1,000 BC) to the historical period beginning around 500 BC.

However, Fifi was not replaced by any particular name due to a change in the Atlantic hurricane naming scheme in 1979. At the time, Fifi was the first Category 2 hurricane to have its name retired.

Both parties had been enemies until the chaos of the Torres regime gave them a chance for a political comeback in alliance with conservative elements in the armed forces.|$|E
25|$|Technological {{advances}} {{over several}} millennia gave humans increasing {{control over the}} environment. But it was the Western industrial revolution of the 18th to 19th centuries that tapped into the vast growth potential of the energy in fossil fuels. Coal was used to power ever more efficient engines and later to generate electricity. Modern sanitation systems and advances in medicine protected large populations from disease. Such conditions led to a human population explosion <b>and</b> <b>unprecedented</b> industrial, technological and scientific growth that has continued to this day, marking the commencement of a period of global human influence known as the Anthropocene. From 1650 to 1850 the global population doubled from around 500 million to 1 billion people.|$|E

Citing fissiparous tendencies and in response to a call for revolution, Gandhi instituted a state of emergency from 1975 to 1977 where basic civil liberties were suspended and press was censored. In 1980, she returned to power after free and fair elections. She was assassinated by Sikh nationalists in 1984, less than a month before her 67th birthday.
