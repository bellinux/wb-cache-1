50|$|The {{simplest}} type of <b>autostereogram</b> {{consists of}} horizontally repeating patterns (often separate images) {{and is known}} as a wallpaper <b>autostereogram.</b> When viewed with proper convergence, the repeating patterns appear to float above or below the background. The well-known Magic Eye books feature another type of <b>autostereogram</b> called a random dot <b>autostereogram.</b> One such <b>autostereogram</b> is illustrated above right. In this type of <b>autostereogram,</b> every pixel in the image is computed from a pattern strip and a depth map. A hidden 3D scene emerges when the image is viewed with the correct convergence.|$|E
50|$|In {{a random}} dot <b>autostereogram,</b> the 3D image is usually {{shown in the}} middle of the <b>autostereogram</b> against a {{background}} depth plane (see the shark <b>autostereogram).</b> It may help to establish proper convergence first by staring at either the top or the bottom of the <b>autostereogram,</b> where patterns are usually repeated at a constant interval. Once the brain locks onto the background depth plane, it has a reference convergence degree from which it can then match patterns at different depth levels {{in the middle of}} the image.|$|E
50|$|By {{focusing}} {{the lenses}} {{on a nearby}} <b>autostereogram</b> where patterns are repeated and by converging the eyeballs at a distant point behind the <b>autostereogram</b> image, one can trick the brain into seeing 3D images. If the patterns received by the two eyes are similar enough, the brain will consider these two patterns a match and treat them as coming from the same imaginary object. This type of visualization is known as wall-eyed viewing, because the eyeballs adopt a wall-eyed convergence on a distant plane, even though the <b>autostereogram</b> image is actually closer to the eyes. Because the two eyeballs converge on a plane farther away, the perceived location of the imaginary object is behind the <b>autostereogram.</b> The imaginary object also appears bigger than the patterns on the <b>autostereogram</b> because of foreshortening.|$|E

5000|$|Stereogram was {{originally}} {{used to describe}} {{as a pair of}} 2D images used in stereoscope to present a 3D image to viewers. The [...] "auto" [...] in <b>autostereogram</b> describes an image that does not require a stereoscope. The term stereogram is now often used interchangeably with <b>autostereogram.</b> Dr. Christopher Tyler, inventor of the <b>autostereogram,</b> consistently refers to single image stereograms as autostereograms to distinguish them from other forms of stereograms.|$|E
50|$|Much advice exists {{about seeing}} the {{intended}} three-dimensional image in an <b>autostereogram.</b> While {{some people may}} quickly see the 3D image in an <b>autostereogram</b> with little effort, others must learn to train their eyes to decouple eye convergence from lens focusing.|$|E
50|$|Wallpaper <b>autostereogram</b> is {{a single}} 2D image where {{recognizable}} patterns are repeated at various intervals to raise or lower each pattern's perceived 3D location {{in relation to the}} display surface.

40|$|<b>Autostereograms,</b> or “Magic Eye” pictures, are repeating {{patterns}} {{designed to give}} the illusion of depth.

50|$|<b>Autostereograms</b> where {{patterns}} {{in a particular}} row are repeated horizontally with the same spacing can be read either cross-eyed or wall-eyed. In such <b>autostereograms,</b> both types of reading will produce similar depth interpretation, with the exception that the cross-eyed reading reverses the depth (images that once popped out are now pushed in).|$|R
50|$|Using this convention, a {{grayscale}} {{depth map}} for the example <b>autostereogram</b> {{can be created}} with black, gray and white representing shifts of 0 pixels, 10 pixels and 20 pixels, respectively {{as shown in the}} greyscale example <b>autostereogram.</b> A depth map is the key to creation of random-dot autostereograms.|$|E
50|$|It occurs mainly during {{stereoscopy}} {{and when}} viewing autostereograms (such as Magic Eye pictures). In these cases, {{the object is}} depicted by the two half images of a stereogram or by {{the contents of the}} <b>autostereogram.</b> Moving the stereogram or the <b>autostereogram</b> closer to the eyes increases convergence of the eyes and reduces the apparent size of the depicted object. If a correctly arranged stereogram or <b>autostereogram</b> is viewed with crossed eyes, then the depicted objects will appear smaller than if it is viewed with eyes diverged or parallel.|$|E

40|$|One {{important}} {{branch in}} computer graphics is the research for representing threedimensional objects. Many different techniques {{have been developed}} to convey to a user of a two-dimensional medium that he sees a three-dimensional scene. Apart from realistic image synthesis, e. g., ray tracing and radiostiy, there are techniques which try to generate a real three-dimensional impression for the viewer. In the last years a new technique to produce such pictures has gained popularity. The generated images are called <b>autostereograms.</b> An interesting feature with this technique is, that only single pictures have to be produced and that no additional equipment is needed to produce a three dimensional impression. Therefore <b>autostereograms</b> are also called "single image stereograms" (SIS). This work gives an overview on the technique of <b>autostereograms.</b> After a short description of the algorithms to generate <b>autostereograms</b> a detailed classification is introduced. After that the perceptability of [...] ...|$|R

The Web is extremely accessible: it makes multimedia available to more people than any other computer-based medium. <b>Autostereograms,</b> similarly, are easily viewed without any special equipment and give true stereoscopic 3 D effects. This paper discusses stereoscopic 3 D effects, and how drawing <b>autostereograms</b> lends itself to the networking constraints and page layout freedom characteristic of the Web.

50|$|Smooth {{gradients}} {{can also}} be achieved with an intelligible pattern, assuming that the pattern is complex enough and does not have big, horizontal, monotonic patches. A big area painted with monotonic color without change in hue and brightness does not lend itself to pixel shifting, {{as the result of}} the horizontal shift is identical to the original patch. The following depth map of a shark with smooth gradient produces a perfectly readable <b>autostereogram,</b> even though the 2D image contains small monotonic areas; the brain is able to recognize these small gaps and fill in the blanks (illusory contours). While intelligible, repeated patterns are used instead of random dots, this type of <b>autostereogram</b> is still known by many as a Random Dot <b>Autostereogram,</b> because it is created using the same process.|$|E
