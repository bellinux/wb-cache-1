Expressed sequence tag (EST) clusters for frontline immune defense, cell signalling, apoptosis and stress response genes were expressed or repressed spatio-temporally during the acute phase of Pseudomonas infection.

40|$|ABSTRACT Structural changes {{underlying}} exocytosis {{evoked by}} {{the application of}} endotoxin to Limulus <b>amebocytes</b> were studied {{at the level of}} detail afforded by freeze-fracture and freezesubstitution techniques combined with the time resolution of direct rapid-freezing.

Exocytosis begins within seconds of endotoxin treatment when the plasmalemma invaginates to form pedestallike appositions with peripheral secretory granules. The juxtaposed membranes at these pedestal appositions form several punctate pentalaminar contacts, but examination of freeze-fractured pedestals failed to reveal any corresponding changes in the intramembrane particle distribution. Small secretory granule openings or pores, which are very infrequent, appear within the first 5 s after endotoxin treatment. These pores rapidly widen and this widening is immediately followed by the sequential dissolution of the granule contents, which then move into the surrounding extracellular space.

50|$|The coelomic fluid {{contains}} the coelomocytes, or immune cells. There are {{several types of}} immune cells, which vary among classes and species.

These cells are usually larger and granular, and are suggested to be a main line of defense against potential pathogens. Depending on the class, echinoderms may have spherule cells (for cytotoxicity, inflammation, and anti-bacterial activity), vibratile cells (for coelomic fluid movement and clotting), and crystal cells (potential osmoregulatory cells in sea cucumbers),. The coelomocytes also secrete Anti-Microbial Peptides (AMPs) against bacteria, and have a set of lectins and complement proteins as part of an innate immune system that is still being characterized.|$|E
50|$|Currently, {{the method}} of choice for {{endotoxin}} detection is the Limulus <b>Amebocyte</b> Lysate (LAL) test. This test is based on Dr. Frederik Bang's http://commprojects.jhsph.edu/sphheros/default.cfm?detail=17 observation that horseshoe crab blood forms clots when exposed to endotoxins. Amoebocyte extract from horseshoe crab blood is mixed with a sample suspected of endotoxin contamination, and a reaction is observed if endotoxins are present. The FDA has approved four variations of the LAL test: gel-clot, turbidimetric, colorimetric, and chromogenic assay. The differences in these variations refer to {{the characteristics of the}} amoebocyte/endtoxin reaction (e.g. gel-clot produces a precipitate and colorimetric changes color). This test is fast (approx. 30 minutes) and highly sensitive (up to 0.001 EU/ml sensitivity). However, because it only detects LPS endotoxins, some pyrogenic materials can be missed. Also, certain conditions (sub-optimal pH conditions or unsuitable cation concentration) can lead to false negatives. Glucans from carbohydrate chromatography matrices can also lead to false positives.|$|E
50|$|Unlike vertebrates, {{horseshoe}} crabs do {{not have}} hemoglobin in their blood, but instead use hemocyanin to carry oxygen. Because of the copper present in hemocyanin, their blood is blue. Their blood contains amebocytes, which play a similar role to the white blood cells of vertebrates in defending the organism against pathogens. Amebocytes from the blood of L. polyphemus are used to make Limulus <b>amebocyte</b> lysate, which {{is used for the}} detection of bacterial endotoxins in medical applications. This requires the blood to be harvested, which involves collecting and bleeding the animals, and then releasing them back into the sea. Most of the animals survive the process; mortality is correlated with both the amount of blood extracted from an individual animal, and the stress experienced during handling and transportation. Estimates of mortality rates following blood harvesting vary from 3-15% to 10-30%. Approximately 500,000 crabs are harvested annually.|$|E
40|$|When a {{trematode}} parasite penetrates {{a potential}} molluscan host, {{it has to}} circumvent the host 2 ̆ 7 s internal defense system. In molluscs, the primary effector cells of this system are the hemocytes which orchestrate many of the cellular and humoral immune functions. Survival of the parasite can occur only {{in the absence of}} a successful immune response, and continued development only if the host is physiologically suitable. This study investigated hemocytic response against asexual stages of a hemiuroid trematode by its host, the marine bivalve Anadara trapezia. Hemocyte characteristic (type, morphology) and function (mortality, phagocytosis and oxidative activity) were analyzed by flow cytometry in parasitized and non-parasitized cockles. A. trapezia possesses two types of hemocytes: <b>amebocytes</b> and erythrocytes. Analysis of histological section showed that there was no host hemocytic response around hemiuroid sporocysts. The infection induced a significant increase of the total circulating hemocytes with a higher proportion of erythrocytes relative to <b>amebocytes,</b> coupled with a lower phagocytosis rate and a statistically nonsignificant decrease of the intracellular oxidative activity. No significant differences were observed in hemocyte size and complexity, mortality, or phagocytic capacity. Our results indicate that in A. trapezia, hemiuroids modulate the immune response by increasing the number of circulating hemocytes and decreasing phagocytosis. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Resistance and {{susceptibility}} of Biomphalaria snails to Schistosoma mansoni sporocysts {{occur in}} different degrees. Histopathology reflects these diferences. In {{a state of}} tolerance numerous sporocysts in different stages of differentiation are seen {{in the absence of}} host tissue reaction. However extensive diffuse and focal proliferation of <b>amebocytes</b> with sequestration and destruction of many parasitic structures appear in resistant snails. Some snails are totally resistant and when exposed to infecting miracidia may never eliminate cercarie. Sequential histopathological examination has revealed that in such cases the infected miracidia are destroyed a few minutes to 24 hr after penetration in the snail. However, B. glabrata that were exposed to S. mansoni miracidia and three moths later failed to shed cercariae, exhibited focal and diffuse proliferation of <b>amebocytes</b> in many organs in the absence of pasitic structures. These lesions were similar to those observed in resistant snails that were still eliminating a few cercariae, with the difference that no recognizable sporocystic structures or remmants were present. Histological investigation carried out in similarly resistant B. tenagophila and B. straminea presented essentially normal histologic structures. Only occasionally a few focal proliferative (granulomatous) amebocytic reactions were seen in ovotestis and in the tubular portion of the kidney.
