40|$|Steroid-regulated gene {{transcription}} requires the coordinate physical and functional interaction of hormone receptors, basal transcription factors, and transcriptional coactivators. In this context ARA 70, previously called RFG and ELE 1, {{has been described}} as a putative coactivator that specifically enhances the activity of the androgen receptor (AR) but not that of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), the progesterone receptor, or the estrogen receptor (ER). Here we describe the cloning of the cDNA for ELE 1 /ARA 70 by RT-PCR from RNA derived from different cell lines (HeLa, DU- 145, and LNCaP). In accordance with the previously described sequence, we obtained a 1845 -bp PCR product for the HeLa and the LNCaP RNA. Starting from T- 47 D RNA, however, an 860 -bp PCR product was obtained. This shorter variant results from an internal 985 -bp deletion and is called ELE 1 �; accordingly, the longer isoform is referred to <b>as</b> <b>ELE</b> 1 �. The deduced amino acid sequence of ELE 1 �, but not that of ELE 1 �, differs at specific positions from the one previously published by others, suggesting that these two proteins are encoded by different nonallelic genes.

25|$|The participle {{of regular}} verbs {{is used in}} {{compound}} verb tenses, <b>as</b> in <b>ele</b> tinha cantado ("he had sung").

Some verbs have two distinct forms (one regular, one irregular) for these two uses. Additionally, a few verbs have two different verbal participles, a regular one for the active voice, and an irregular one for the passive voice. An example is the verb matar (to kill): Bruto tinha matado César ("Brutus had killed Cesar"), César foi morto por Bruto ("Cesar was killed by Brutus").

40|$|Neste artigo, estamos desenvolvendo um estudo relativo às instituições totais. Pesquisamos no romance “O Ateneu” de Raul Pompéia quais são os dispositivos disciplinares produtores de subjetividade no contexto institucional. Trata-se de uma análise institucional tomando como campo de pesquisa um caso da literatura, pautada pelos referenciais de Goffman e de Foucault. Goffman diz o que são e como funcionam e indica o que produzem as instituições totais. Foucault, por sua vez, nos revela como são possíveis as instituições disciplinares e quais as razões de sua emergência. A leitura de Goffman a partir das análises de Foucault pode nos proporcionar um enriquecimento fecundo na compreensão dos processos de produção de subjetividade na sociedade contemporânea e, de modo específico, no contexto das instituições totais. Goffman analisa <b>as</b> práticas não-discursivas, <b>ele</b> <b>as</b> articula com grande sutileza, fazendo falar os “detalhes” mais pitorescos e aparentemente insignificantes do cotidiano institucional: percebemos então o plano microfísico das relações intra-institucionais, mergulhando nas diferentes estratégias nas quais o poder se ramifica, circula, domina e produz saberes e sujeitos.

Studies on Lexical Availability may provide us with some insights in vocabulary teaching planning. Available words, differently from frequent words, are related to a semantic domain (thematic words) and depend on the communicative goals of students. The research about Lexical Availability conducted at Ca’ Foscari University Venice is the first one wholly applied to Italian students of Spanish and the first one carried out in Italy. The ways in which this kind of research on vocabulary may contribute to the teaching / learning of Spanish are many, as well as they may increase our knowledge of the organization of the mental lexicon, the storage and retrieving of words and the influence of psycho-social factors, attitudes and motivation on vocabulary learning...|$|R

50|$|Reclassified <b>as</b> a typhoon, <b>Ele</b> moved north-northwestward {{due to a}} {{weakness}} in the ridge to the north. Early on August 31, the JTWC estimated the storm's peak 1-minute winds at 165 km/h (105 mph). On September 2, the JMA estimated peak 10-minute winds of 165 km/h (105 mph) while Ele was northeast of Wake Atoll. The typhoon turned to the northeast due to an approaching trough, although Ele resumed its previous north-northwest motion after a ridge built behind the trough. It gradually weakened due to cooler waters and increasing wind shear, and on September 6 Ele deteriorated below typhoon status. The thunderstorms became detached from the circulation, causing Ele to weaken to a tropical depression late on September 9. By that time, it began moving to the northeast, and on September 10 it transitioned into an extratropical storm. The remnants of Ele continued to the northeast until moving back into the central Pacific as an extratropical storm on September 11 and dissipating on September 13.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the syntactic status of expletive ele in European Portuguese (EP). This expletive, {{which can be}} found in EP non-standard varieties, has traditionally been analyzed as an instance of the subject in impersonal constructions (in examples like Ele há cada uma! ‘There are such things!’), in sharp contrast to what is expected in a null subject language. Occasionally, alternative analyses have suggested a particular connection between this kind of expletive element and the structural space beyond the subject position, more specifi cally the left periphery of the sentence structure. The present study aims at elucidating the status of expletive ele in EP, {{on the basis of the}} syntactic properties and the discourse effects displayed by expletive constructions in a corpus of EP dialects, summarizing part of the research developed in Carrilho (2005). Such empirical evidence favors an analysis of expletive <b>ele</b> <b>as</b> a non-subject element, further motivating the proposal that this expletive relates to the codifi cation of specifi c discourse features, especially in connection with illocutionary force...|$|R
