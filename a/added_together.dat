5|$|Finally, {{there was}} a {{classification}} for teams. After each stage, the times {{of the first three}} riders on each team were <b>added</b> <b>together.</b> The team with the lowest cumulative time was the leader of the team classification.|$|E
5|$|A {{vector space}} (also called a linear space) is a {{collection}} of objects called vectors, which may be <b>added</b> <b>together</b> and multiplied ("scaled") by numbers, called scalars. Scalars are often taken to be real numbers, but there are also vector spaces with scalar multiplication by complex numbers, rational numbers, or generally any field. The operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication must satisfy certain requirements, called axioms, listed below.|$|E

5|$|Although Lincoln {{won only}} a {{plurality}} of the popular vote, his victory {{in the electoral college}} was decisive: Lincoln had 180 and his opponents <b>added</b> <b>together</b> had only 123. There were fusion tickets in which all of Lincoln's opponents combined to support the same slate of Electors in New York, New Jersey, and Rhode Island, but even if the anti-Lincoln vote had been combined in every state, Lincoln still would have won a majority in the Electoral College.|$|E
5|$|During {{the regular}} season, Clemson was No. 10 in rushing yards, {{averaging}} 236.4 per game. Its passing offense was somewhat weaker, ranked No. 63 and averaging 210.1 yards per game. In total, however, Clemson's offense ranked No. 10 {{when the two}} amounts were <b>added</b> <b>together.</b> In scoring offense, the Tigers averaged 36.0 points per game, good enough for No. 14 {{in the country in}} that category.|$|E
5|$|The final {{competition}} {{is the team}} classification. On each stage, each team is awarded a time based on the cumulative time of its top three riders. The times for each stage are then <b>added</b> <b>together</b> and {{the team with the}} lowest total time {{is the leader of the}} team classification. There is no jersey awarded for this classification.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{completing}} a mission, the player is awarded a rank, {{starting with the}} lowest at C and going to B, A and S, which is the highest. The ranks are based on three categories: Power, Technique, and Speed, each determined by meeting certain conditions in a battle. All three categories are rated {{on a scale from}} 0-150, and <b>added</b> <b>together</b> to form a numerical ranking from 0-450 in addition to their letter ranking; for example, any score between 300-450 earns an S ranking. Unlike previous games, the numerical score is not converted into points that can be redeemed to purchase new maps and COs; instead, COs are unlocked after the completion of certain missions and all maps (with the exception of training missions) are available at the beginning of gameplay.|$|E

5000|$|Additive tasks allow {{members to}} each {{contribute}} individually and those individual contributions then <b>add</b> <b>together</b> {{for the greater}} output of the group. Additive tasks are also categorized as divisible and having a maximizing focus. They require <b>adding</b> <b>together</b> the individual contributions of group members to maximize {{the outcome of the}} group. [...] Examples provided in Forysth’s summary of Steiner’s work include shovelling snow and pulling a rope (tug of war).|$|R

25|$|The Sumerian {{language}} is {{generally regarded as}} a {{language is}}olate in linguistics because it belongs to no known language family; Akkadian, by contrast, belongs to the Semitic branch of the Afroasiatic languages. There have been many failed attempts to connect Sumerian to other language families. It is an agglutinative language; in other words, morphemes ("units of meaning") are <b>added</b> <b>together</b> to create words, unlike analytic languages where morphemes are purely <b>added</b> <b>together</b> to create sentences. Some authors have proposed {{that there may be}} evidence of a substratum or adstratum language for geographic features and various crafts and agricultural activities, called variously Proto-Euphratean or Proto Tigrean, but this is disputed by others.|$|E
