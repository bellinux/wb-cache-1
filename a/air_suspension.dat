5|$|VAT {{delivered}} {{its first}} mid-engined bus chassis to Ajokki Oy coach works in April 1958. It was {{powered by a}} horizontally mounted 164-hp AEC diesel engine. The end customer was bus operator Väinö Paunu Oy, which also participated in the development work. In 1960, VAT introduced the VLK500 chassis with <b>air</b> <b>suspension</b> and dual-circuit air brakes. VAT returned to building rear-engined buses in 1966–67, but sales did not reach {{the level of the}} mid- and front-engined models. The company conducted a number of experiments with the construction; one example was a bus with a frameless structure in which the beams were replaced by a lighter solution.|$|E
25|$|The {{design has}} a {{monocoque}} (unibody) construction with four-wheel independent <b>air</b> <b>suspension.</b> <b>Air</b> <b>suspension</b> allowed variable ride height and achieved similar axle articulation {{to the previous}} live axle design. This retained off-road abilities while improving on-road performance. The new Range Rover's introduction in late 2002 as a 2003 model for the North American market resulted in the Range Rover and Ford Expedition (also new for 2003) being the only two SUVs in the full-size sport utility class with four-wheel independent suspension systems at that time.|$|E
25|$|Main {{reservoir}} {{pipe pressure}} {{can also be}} used to supply air for auxiliary systems such as pneumatic door operators or <b>air</b> <b>suspension.</b> Nearly all passenger trains (all in the UK and USA), and many freights, now have the two-pipe system.|$|E
5000|$|Chassis weights were increased, {{front axle}} GAWRs were {{available}} up to 20,000 lb, single rear axles to 23,000 lb as before, and tandem rear axles to 46,000 lb. On tandems a walking beam type was standard and 2 different <b>air</b> <b>suspensions</b> were available.|$|R
50|$|Koreatomy {{products}} include {{automatic and}} manual <b>air</b> <b>suspensions</b> for trucks and buses; chassis components; shocks and struts; electronic air tube damping systems including Continuous Damping Control (CDC), Active Suspension (AS); Electronic Stability Control (ESC); axle drives; pusher axle system; less vibration system; and industrial drives.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{suspension}} parameters and driving conditions on dynamic load-sharing of longitudinal-connected <b>air</b> <b>suspensions</b> of a tri-axle semi-trailer are investigated in this study. A novel nonlinear {{model of a}} multi-axle semi-trailer with longitudinal-connected <b>air</b> <b>suspensions</b> is formulated based on fluid mechanics and thermodynamics and validated through test results. The effects of road surface conditions, driving speeds, air line inside diameter and connector inside diameter on dynamic load-sharing capability of the semi-trailer were analyzed in terms of load-sharing criteria. Simulation results indicate that, when larger air lines and connectors are employed, the DLSC (Dynamic Load-Sharing Coefficient) optimization ratio reaches its peak value when the road roughness is medium. The optimization ratio fluctuates in a complex manner as driving speed increases. The results also indicate that if the air line inside diameter is always assumed to be larger than the connector inside diameter, the influence of air line inside diameter on load-sharing is more significant {{than that of the}} connector inside diameter. The proposed approach can be used for further study of the influence of additional factors (such as vehicle load, static absolute air pressure and static height of air spring) on load-sharing and the control methods for multi-axle <b>air</b> <b>suspensions</b> with longitudinal <b>air</b> line...|$|R
25|$|<b>Air</b> <b>suspension</b> {{was fitted}} all round which {{provided}} adaptive damping {{as well as}} rear self leveling. Unlike other manufacturers Jaguar did not provide any driver control of ride height or suspension mode which was fully computer controlled. Dynamic stability control as well as traction control were standard.|$|E
25|$|The first 44 Open Standards (7101–44) {{and five}} Buffets (7401–05) and seven Generator Vans (7601–07) were built at Derby Litchurch Lane Works. The {{remainder}} (7145–72, 7406–13, 7608–15) was built under licence in Inchicore between 1984 and 1989. The coaches ran on 5ft 3 in gauge versions of British Rail's BT22 <b>Air</b> <b>Suspension</b> bogie, and were air-braked.|$|E
25|$|The Legacy {{began with}} a 5-door wagon or 4-door sedan body styles with FWD and an {{optional}} full-time AWD package, and was introduced in North America, the UK, Germany, the Benelux region of Northern Europe, Japan and Australia. Options included 4-channel ABS, licensed from Bosch and <b>air</b> <b>suspension</b> height control, which lowered the vehicle at speeds above , and also allowed the driver to increase the vehicle's ground clearance for off-road conditions.|$|E
50|$|The company's main {{products}} include shock absorbers, <b>air</b> <b>suspensions,</b> power steering systems, hydraulic pumps, motors, cylinders, and valves. It {{is one of}} the world's largest shock absorber manufacturer and it also has the largest market share of concrete mixer trucks in Japan with 85% of the market.|$|R
50|$|Lowlander (1961-1966) Double decker. 18 ft wheelbase. LR7 had <b>air</b> rear <b>suspension.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Traditionally the cab {{has been}} {{centrally}} mounted. Some models, the 7000 series and latter 8250, have the cab mounted {{at the rear}} of the tractor. The most recent fastrac iteration, the 4000 series tractors, have forward sloping cabs,similar to those on combine harvesters. All cabs have a full size passenger seat and an <b>air</b> <b>suspensioned</b> driver's seat ...|$|R
25|$|The Model S has {{independent}} {{coil spring}} suspension {{on all four}} wheels front double wishbone, virtual steer axis control arm and rear independent multilink. As an extra-cost option, the car is available with self-leveling, height-adjustable <b>air</b> <b>suspension.</b> This is accomplished via adjustable Bilstein shock absorbers controlled by the driver. The car is meant to lower itself at highway speed and raise itself to traverse steep driveways and rough terrain, despite the low 6-inch ground clearance and rather long 116-inch wheelbase.|$|E
25|$|Almost any finely-divided organic {{substance}} becomes an explosive material when dispersed as an air suspension; hence, {{a very fine}} flour is dangerously explosive in <b>air</b> <b>suspension.</b> This poses a significant risk when milling grain to produce flour, so mills {{go to great lengths}} to remove sources of sparks. These measures include carefully sifting the grain before it is milled or ground to remove stones which could strike sparks from the millstones, and the use of magnets to remove metallic debris able to strike sparks.|$|E
25|$|Touring {{models are}} {{distinguishable}} by their large saddlebags, rear coil-over <b>air</b> <b>suspension</b> {{and are the}} only models to offer full fairings with radios and CBs. All touring models use the same frame, first introduced with a Shovelhead motor in 1980, and carried forward with only modest upgrades until 2009, when it was extensively redesigned. The frame is distinguished by {{the location of the}} steering head in front of the forks and was the first H-D frame to rubber mount the drivetrain to isolate the rider from the vibration of the big V-twin.|$|E
40|$|Matching {{method of}} heavy truck-rear <b>air</b> <b>suspensions</b> is discussed, and a fuzzy control {{strategy}} which improves both ride comfort and road friendliness of truck by adjusting damping coefficients of {{the suspension system}} is found. In the first place, a Dongfeng EQ 1141 G 7 DJ heavy truck’s ten DOF whole vehicle-road model was set up based on Matlab/Simulink and vehicle dynamics. Then appropriate passive <b>air</b> <b>suspensions</b> were chosen to replace the original rear leaf springs of the truck according to truck-suspension matching criterions, consequently, the stiffness of front leaf springs were adjusted too. Then the semi-active fuzzy controllers were designed for further enhancement of the truck’s ride comfort and the road friendliness. After the application of semi-active fuzzy control strategy through simulation, is was indicated that both ride comfort and road friendliness could be enhanced effectively under various road conditions. The strategy proposed may provide theory basis for design and development of truck suspension system in China...|$|R
5000|$|The other useful {{features}} of the bus included ultra-low entry at 390mm with kneeling option, noise-free rear engine, front and rear <b>air</b> <b>suspensions</b> and retractable ramp for wheel-chair entry. Some innovative pedestrian safety concepts were also introduced in the bus, like the sound and light alerts while the bus moves, a camera-assisted reversing aid for the driver and night time highlighters near the tail lights.|$|R
3000|$|<b>Air</b> spring <b>suspension</b> It gives {{a better}} ride and the {{pressure}} can be adjusted automatically to compensate for additions or reductions in passenger loads.|$|R
25|$|The use of {{self-levelling}} rear <b>air</b> <b>suspension</b> {{available in}} Caprice brought advantages when hauling heavy loads and improved vehicle dynamics when towing. Safety in the WH model was also enhanced, {{with the addition}} of side impact head & torso airbags and pyrotechnic seat belt pretensioners along with drivers steering wheel and passenger dashboard airbags all as standard. If the seat belt pretensioners trigger, the doors automatically unlock, both engine and fuel pump shut down and all interior lights will switch on. Also new to the WH are the electric wing mirrors, which when reversing, the passenger mirror faces downwards to assist the driver when parking, thus preventing kerbside wheel damage.|$|E
25|$|This {{generation}} Imperial was a 6-passenger sedan {{offered in}} either velour or Mark Cross leather. Power equipment came standard, as did automatic climate controlled air conditioning, anti-lock brakes, cruise control, driver's side airbag, and its distinct landau vinyl roof. The Imperial featured hidden headlamps behind retractable metal covers {{similar to those}} found on the LeBaron coupe/convertible and New Yorker/Fifth Avenue. The Imperial was available with a choice of several Infinity sound systems, all with a cassette player. Other major options included fully electronic digital instrument cluster with information center, electronically controlled <b>air</b> <b>suspension</b> system, and remote keyless entry with security alarm. Dealer-installed integrated Chrysler cellular phones and six-disc CD changers were also available.|$|E
25|$|First {{production}} run of Birmingham and Midland Motor Omnibus Company (Midland Red) buses takes {{place during the}} 1920s—one of the first British buses to have pneumatic tyres. BMMO later develop petrol and diesel engines during the 1930s, with experimental rear-engined buses being built. By the 1940s experiments with, and production of under-floor engined single-deck buses take place. Experiments and developments of independent front suspension, <b>air</b> <b>suspension,</b> rubber suspension, glass fibre construction and disc brakes take place during the 1950s. 1959 sees {{the introduction of a}} turbocharged coach capable of almost 100mph, for non-stop motorway services. High speed (motorway) buses are developed with passenger toilets. During the 1960s BMMO becomes the first British bus company to make wide-scale use of computers in compiling bus schedules and staff rosters.|$|E
50|$|Some {{production}} and design options include a super charger package and commercial grade multi link <b>air</b> ride <b>suspension</b> {{system and a}} right-hand drive conversion package.|$|R
50|$|Bose conducts {{research}} into using electromagnetic motors {{in place of}} conventional (hydraulic or <b>air)</b> automotive <b>suspension</b> systems. The system was due for release in 2009, {{but there are no}} vehicles in production using the system.|$|R
5000|$|Height {{adjustable}} <b>air</b> <b>suspensions</b> {{are also}} equipped on some buses, mainly [...] "low-floor" [...] city buses or [...] "kneeling buses", however {{in recent years}} some high floor charter/intercity buses have been equipped with this feature as well. This allows the floor to be lowered when the bus is stopped, to allow people with large or bulky luggage, passengers with disabilities, or simply when stopping at stops with unusual curb arrangements to enter or exit the vehicle easily. It can also raise the bus more than normal, which is useful when navigating roads with large amounts of speed humps, crossing railway lines or in other unusual, but not always uncommon situations.|$|R
25|$|Second {{generation}} {{sales in}} Japan began October 7, 1993, and an introductory price of ¥2,753,000 for the twin turbo GT (approx USD $25,250 at 1993 yen exchange rate), with an introduction for model year 1995 in North America {{with a full}} body and chassis revision. The exterior was designed by Olivier Boulay, who was hired by Subaru on a short-term basis. The tail light appearance on both the sedan and wagon {{was influenced by the}} taillights on the SVX. In 1996, Subaru decided to make AWD standard equipment in all vehicles produced for the North American market, which would be the case until 2012. Subaru still offered a choice between FWD and AWD for its domestic market vehicles for this generation. The increased ground clearance Outback was introduced with this generation in 1995 with AWD only internationally, and the <b>air</b> <b>suspension</b> with height control was no longer offered.|$|E
500|$|In 1958, Cadillac {{introduced}} self-levelling <b>air</b> <b>suspension</b> as a $215 option, a {{first for}} an American manufacturer, and a quick response to the suspension advances of the 1955 Citroën DS. [...] This replaced the coil springs with an air-filled bladder, but the American version proved troublesome and was discontinued. Later that same year, Chevrolet, Buick, Oldsmobile, Ford, Mercury and Pontiac also introduced <b>air</b> <b>suspension</b> as an option for select models but it was unreliable and was soon dropped. [...] For Buick, the unpopular [...] "Air Poise Suspension" [...] contributed to the division's decline to fifth place in industry sales for 1958. [...] Decades later though it became a common and reliable method of suspension on luxury cars, buses, large transport trucks, and in some custom car applications.|$|E
500|$|In Japan, {{the launch}} of Lexus was {{complicated}} by Toyota's existing four domestic dealership networks {{at the time of}} its introduction. The Toyota Crown and Toyota Century were exclusive to Toyota Store locations. During the LS 400's development, local dealers' requests for a Japanese domestic market version had grown, and a right-hand-drive Toyota Celsior-badged version was introduced shortly after the LS 400's U.S. debut, and introduced 9 October 1989 and only available at Toyopet Store locations. The Celsior, named after the Latin word for [...] "supreme", was largely identical to the LS. Models came in either basic [...] "A", upgraded suspension [...] "B", or fully equipped [...] "C" [...] trim specifications. The Crown and the Crown Majesta, which appeared later in 1991, were only available at Toyota Store locations which carried Japan-only Toyota luxury models, like the Century. The Celsior introduced two world firsts: high-performance twin-tube shock absorbers and an <b>air</b> <b>suspension</b> combined with an upgraded version of Toyota's semi-active dampers Toyota Electronic Modulated Suspension, called Piezo TEMS. This was ahead of its time, Mercedes-Benz first introduced a similar electronically controlled <b>air</b> <b>suspension</b> on the 1999 Mercedes-Benz S-Class (W220) (Airmatic).|$|E
50|$|The CB900c had a {{front and}} rear <b>air</b> {{assisted}} <b>suspension,</b> shaft drive, and a dual-range sub-transmission. The CB900C {{was derived from the}} DOHC CB750K, and is closely related to the CB900F and the 1983-only CB1100F, both derivatives of the CB750 line.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{shows the}} {{importance}} of modelling {{the components of the}} suspension when performing dynamics simulations of a railway vehicle. Focusing on the <b>air</b> spring secondary <b>suspension,</b> a process to define an accurate component model is proposed based on a combination of laboratory tests and model identification techniques. Six models for the <b>air</b> spring secondary <b>suspension</b> are discussed and assessed based on comparison with experiments...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} an {{experimental}} road research project are presented which demonstrate the existence of spatial repeatability and show patterns of axle impact forces along a pavement. As part of the project, a section of highway near Paris, France, was instrumented with 18 weigh-in-motion sensors. Data was collected for {{a large number of}} vehicles over fourteen days between June 1994 and May 1995. For all the vehicles, the impact factors were calculated and typical graphs are presented which show the variation of impact factor with distance along the sensor array. Mean impact factors and coefficients of variation are also presented and differences between steel and <b>air</b> <b>suspensions</b> are highlighted. The influence of vehicle speed on maximum impact factor is also considered...|$|R
500|$|There are two bogies per car, {{each with}} two axles. The wheel {{diameter}} is [...] for new wheels, and [...] when fully worn-down. The center {{distance between the}} bogies is [...] The primary suspension is steel coil spring between the axles and the bogies, with a secondary <b>air</b> <b>suspension</b> between the frame and the bogies. The latter, which the MX3000 {{was the first to}} use on the metro, gives reduced noise, better comfort and makes it possible to adjust the height with changed passenger weight.|$|E
500|$|Compared to {{previous}} generations, the LS 430 featured {{a greater number}} of model configurations and options. While sharing the same body style, variants were differentiated by chassis configuration and onboard equipment. Models with the Euro-tuned sport suspension, sold as the [...] "Touring" [...] package in the U.S., featured larger, high-speed brakes. These brakes were also standard on European market models. Fully optioned models with height adjustable <b>air</b> <b>suspension,</b> tuned for a combination of soft ride and responsive handling, were sold in the U.S. as the [...] "Ultra Luxury" [...] edition.|$|E
500|$|The second-generation Lexus LS 400 (UCF20) {{debuted in}} November 1994 (for the 1995 model year) with a longer {{wheelbase}} and similar specifications {{as the original}} model. The public unveiling of the vehicle occurred in a gala ceremony held at the San Francisco Opera House in California. The sedan was equipped with an updated 4.0-liter 1UZ-FE V8 engine, producing [...] and [...] of torque. Internally, over 90% of the redesigned LS 400's composition was new or redesigned, with increased sound insulation, a strengthened body structure, suspension updates (first LS/Celsior with Skyhook adaptive computerized <b>air</b> <b>suspension),</b> and improved brakes. The redesigned model was [...] lighter than its predecessor and achieved slightly better fuel economy. The 0– time improved to 7.5seconds.|$|E
25|$|Acquiring a CDL {{requires}} a skills test (pre-trip inspection and driving test), and knowledge test (written) covering the unique handling qualities of driving a large, heavily loaded commercial vehicle, and the mechanical systems required to operate such a vehicle (<b>air</b> brakes, <b>suspension,</b> cargo securement, et al.), plus be declared fit by medical examination {{no less than}} every two years.|$|R
5000|$|The Sport Hornet LRS is a Light Sport Aircraft. One unique {{attribute}} {{that sets}} the Sport Hornet LRS apart from other LSA Aircraft is the <b>air</b> spring <b>suspension</b> system on the landing gear. This protects the aircraft from damage {{in the event of}} [...] "miscalculated" [...] landings and allows for a better experience for the pilot and passengers.|$|R
30|$|The heights at {{four corners}} of the vehicle body are {{adjusted}} by controlling the air mass flow rates flowing into or flowing out of the air springs for an EAS system. During off-road driving condition, the EAS system can lift the vehicle body to prevent the suspension from hitting the position limiter [10], while for driving on an expressway with high speed, the air drag can be reduced and the driving safety can be enhanced by lowering the vehicle body. Meanwhile, in order to prevent the phenomenon of vehicle posture instability, i.e., the peak values of the roll and pitch angles of the vehicle body are too large, which is mainly caused by the different payloads at four corners and the system parameters difference between the front and rear <b>air</b> <b>suspensions,</b> the effective control of the vehicle leveling is also very essential for the EAS system dynamic performance [11].|$|R
