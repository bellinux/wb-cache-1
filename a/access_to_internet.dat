25|$|For {{those who}} cannot afford computers, {{inadequate}} funding and geographical coverage for public libraries which could provide shared internet access is another factor. Those without computers are also facing a new limited <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>Internet</b> cafés. The Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Information Industry have both issued a notice forbidding {{the opening of}} any new internet bars for the year 2007.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, {{financial}} pressures {{have decreased}} {{the number and}} type of services offered by the BBC. In countries with wide <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>Internet</b> services, there is less need for a radio station. Broadcasts in German ended in March 1999, after research showed {{that the majority of}} German listeners tuned into the English service. Broadcasts in Dutch, Finnish, French, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese and Malay were stopped for similar reasons.|$|E

50|$|E-mail {{was one of}} {{the major}} {{applications}} on MUSIC/SP. The e-mail interface initially provided <b>access</b> <b>to</b> local e-mail. As the networks developed, this was expanded <b>to</b> provide <b>access</b> <b>to</b> BITNET and <b>Internet</b> based e-mail. MUSIC/SP did not have direct <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the <b>Internet</b> until 1990, when the University of Wisconsin Wiscnet TCP/IP code was ported to the system, allowing the system <b>to</b> provide <b>access</b> <b>to</b> all <b>Internet</b> services.|$|R

25|$|On {{the night}} of 26 February 2014, Turkey's Parliament, {{dominated}} by Erdoğan's Justice and Development Party, passed a bill that allowed the government the power to block Internet sites, subject to court review within three days, and granting it <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>Internet</b> traffic data. Another bill previously approved by a parliamentary committee would grant the MİT intelligence service access to data held by the government, as well as private institutions and courts.

25|$|The cost of {{internet}} usage in China {{is much higher}} than other nations. Many minimum wage workers in China cannot afford <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>internet</b> because the cost of having the internet is about 10 percent of their wage. The cost {{of internet}} usage in China as a percentage of income is 18 times the cost in South Korea and 51.5 times the cost in Japan. This data shows that because the cost of the internet is so high in China, many Chinese citizens cannot afford the internet. The digital divide in China is directly related to income.|$|E
25|$|On January 20, 2005, District Court Judge Gary L. Lancaster {{dropped the}} charges, agreeing {{with the defense}} that the federal anti-obscenity {{statutes}} were unconstitutional, as they violated a person's fundamental right to possess and view whatever they want {{in the privacy of}} their own home. As a fundamental right had been violated, the government had to establish that a compelling state interest was involved. The prosecution argued that the government had a legitimate interest in protecting adults from unwitting exposure to obscenity, and protecting children from exposure to obscenity. These arguments were rejected by the court, which also ruled that the federal obscenity laws were not narrow enough to meet these interests, and could not justify a complete ban on obscene material. Lancaster ruled that children and unwitting adults are protected from the content because the website requires a credit card to join, and because software is available by which parents can restrict children's <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>Internet</b> pornography. The court did agree with the government that Lawrence had not created a new broad fundamental right to engage in any private sexual conduct. Instead the court relied on Stanley, which had established there was a fundamental right to private possession of obscene material. The court did rely on Lawrence for its assertion that the government could not use public morality as a legitimate state interest which justified the infringement of consensual, adult, private sexual conduct. The court also made reference to the dissenting opinion of Justice Scalia, who said that Lawrence had questioned the validity of U.S. obscenity laws, since the government could not enforce a moral code of conduct. Judge Lancaster also cited numerous constitutional scholars who had observed that the Lawrence ruling calls federal obscenity laws into question.|$|E
