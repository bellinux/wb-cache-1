6000|$|His two {{election}} addresses are {{a curious}} starting-point for so memorable a journey. Thrown into {{the form of}} a modern programme, the points are these:--union of church and state, the defence in particular of our Irish establishments; correction of the poor laws; allotment of cottage grounds; <b>adequate</b> <b>remuneration</b> of labour; a system of Christian instruction for the West Indian slaves, but no emancipation until that instruction had fitted them for it; a dignified and impartial foreign policy. The duke was much startled by the passage about labour receiving <b>adequate</b> <b>remuneration,</b> 'which unhappily among several classes of our fellow countrymen is not now the case.' He did not, however, interfere. The whig newspaper said roundly of the first of Mr. Gladstone's two addresses, that a more jumbled collection of words had seldom been sent from the press. The tory paper, on the contrary, congratulated the constituency on a candidate of considerable commercial experience and talent. The anti-slavery men fought him stoutly. They put his name into their black schedule with nine-and-twenty other candidates, they harried him with posers from a pamphlet of his father's, and they met his doctrine that if slavery were sinful the Bible would not have commended the regulation of it, by bluntly asking him on the hustings whether he knew a text in Exodus declaring that 'he that stealeth a man and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.' His father's pamphlets undoubtedly exposed a good deal of surface. We cannot be surprised that any adherent of these standard sophistries should be placed on the black list of the zealous soldiers of humanity. The candidate held to the ground he had taken at Oxford and in his election address, and apparently made converts. He had an interview with forty voters of abolitionist complexion at his hotel, and according to the friendly narrative of his brother, who was present, 'he shone not only in his powers of conversation, but by the tact, quickness, and talent with which he made his replies, to the thorough and complete satisfaction of baptists, wesleyan methodists, and I may say even, of almost every religious sect! Not one refused their vote: they came forward, and enrolled their names, though before, I believe, they never supported any one on the duke's interest!' ...|$|E

Survey method was adopted where responses were elicited through a questionnaire administered on the staff. Answers were sought to questions on staff welfare, satisfaction and productivity. The data collected was analyzed through frequencies, percentages and inferences. It is shown that the morale of staff in the target group was doused due to: frustration resulting from lack of involvement in decision making and inadequate tools and materials with which to work; over-centralization of authority; lack of proper incentives by way of welfare schemes and <b>adequate</b> <b>remunerations.</b> Suggestions are made on the adoption of genuine participatory management style, the introduction of welfare committees to handle staff welfare matters, stringent measures for disciplinary cases plus the fact that government should improve the working conditions of all employees to enhance their level of productivity...|$|R

Primary data was gathered through a five-point likert scale questionnaire from 200 customers of different casual dining restaurants located in Rawalpindi and Islamabad, Pakistan. Correlation and regression analysis was carried out to check the effect of value recovery on customer satisfaction. Study findings suggest that value recovery through its three dimensions, namely, procedural, interactional and distributive justice significantly and positively effect customer satisfaction in the restaurant setting.

60|$|In {{the summer}} of the ensuing year, Jones {{accompanied}} his pupil to the school at Harrow. During his residence there he transcribed his Persian grammar. He had already begun a dictionary of that language, with illustrations of the principal words from celebrated writers, a work of vast labour, which he resolved not to prosecute without the assurance of an <b>adequate</b> <b>remuneration</b> from the East India Company. At the entreaty of Dr. Glasse, he now dedicated some portion of his time to religious inquiry. The result was a conviction of the truth of Christianity, in his belief of which, it is said, he had hitherto been unconfirmed. In the winter he made a second visit to the Continent with the family of his noble patron. After a longer stay at Paris, than was agreeable to him, they passed down the Rhine to Lyons, and thence proceeded by Marseilles, Frejus, and Antibes, to Nice. At the last of these places they resided long enough to allow of his returning to his studies, which were divided between the arts of music and painting; the mathematics; and military tactics; a science of which he thought no Briton could, without disgrace, be ignorant. He also wrote a treatise on education; and begun a tragedy entitled Soliman, on {{the murder of the}} son of that monarch by the treachery of his step-mother. Of the latter, although it appears from one of his letters that he had completed it, no traces were found among his papers, except a prefatory discourse too unfinished to meet the public eye. The subject has been treated by Champfort, a late French writer, {{and one of the best}} among Racine's school, in a play called Mustapha and Zeangir.

40|$|Purpose: To explore nurses' {{perceptions}} {{of the nature of}} nursing work as a factor that contributes to attrition from the profession. Design: A nonpurposive sample of nurses from the Nurses and Midwives e-cohort Study in Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom provided electronic responses about reasons for leaving the profession. Data were then subjected to qualitative content analysis. Findings: Nurses at the "coal face," that is, those who actually do the work of nursing, in real working conditions, express dissatisfaction in relation to hygiene factors relating to the nature of nursing work and attribute these to nurses leaving the profession: workload, shift work, violence, and financial remuneration. Conclusions: Nurses' satisfaction with work and motivation to work are being sorely tested. There is manifest tension between the core concepts of nursing-compassion and care-and a system of work that actively precludes nurses from being able to exhibit these virtues and fails to reward them. Workload, shift work, violence, and financial remuneration are drivers of attrition and need to be addressed. Clinical Relevance: Implications from this study are fourfold: determination of nursing workload, mitigating the impact of shift work, providing safe work environments, and <b>adequate</b> financial <b>remuneration.</b> Fiona Bogossian, Peta Winters-Chang, Anthony Tucket...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Primary {{health care}} (PHC) {{is the most}} {{important}} element of health system. The development of PHC based on family medicine will allow to significantly improve the demographic situation, to achieve equitable distribution and efficient use of budget funds. However, implementation of general clinical practice/family medicine (GPFM) is constrained by lacking resources and imperfect system of training health professionals, incompleteness of legal and financial frameworks, information support, and mechanisms of interaction between general practice and other health services. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze the legal aspects of the implementation of the family medical practice in Ukraine. METHODS: Thirty four regulatory documents directly related to PHC in Ukraine on the basis of family medicine for the period from 1995 to 2007 were found and analyzed. Among these four decrees of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine and 30 orders of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine were found. RESULTS: Regulatory framework for introduction of family medicine is being enhanced actively. However, it still lacks regulations of relationship between doctors of GPFM and other specialists defining their responsibilities; issues of differential allocation of funds across the levels of health care with the focus on the PHC financing; providing <b>adequate</b> financing, <b>remuneration</b> for labour and motivation to professionals working in "general practice/family medicine"; providing the necessary powers for private family doctors; facilitating the participation of NGOs in the processes of the sector administration; ensuring proper assessment and quality control of PHC based on family medicine.

MethodsA qualitative study was performed on a group of 21 respondents working in different dental colleges in the KSA. ResultsThe fundamental needs for faculty members in dental schools include good <b>remuneration,</b> <b>adequate</b> research facilities, funding for research, and support. Some of the researchers clearly showed a greater need for increasing their own research productivity. These researchers felt that enhancing research productivity would benefit them positively because it would increase their scope of knowledge, which in turn would make them better faculty members. In addition, increased research productivity would also improve their status within the global academic community. ConclusionsThis study has clearly identified the lack of proper funding and support along with a lack of adequate research facilities as barriers to their research productivity.

By investing in a fixed-line telephone network while giving access to new entrants the incumbent is actually providing an option to access its infrastructure. Since options aren't costless to properly compensate the investment an effort to estimate the option premium is justified. We suggest a pragmatic approach where the real options rationality appears as a mark-up over the sector's cost of capital. Failing to consider the real option granted by incumbents discourages investment in infrastructure in the sector and hinders the intertemporal maximization of social welfare...|$|E
40|$|Following {{the growing}} {{consensus}} {{within and outside}} the Nigerian construction industry that corruption and other unethical practices are endemic in the industry, coupled with scarce empirical study on professional ethics in the industry, {{there is a need to}} examine the perceptions of the professionals regarding ethical issues. This study therefore assesses the perceptions of construction professionals regarding ethical issues in the Nigerian construction industry. One hundred and ninety two professionals were sampled from 108 construction organizations comprising 55 consultancy organizations, 35 contracting organizations, and 18 client organizations in selected Nigerian major cities. A survey research design was employed. Descriptive statistics were used in analyzing the data. The results indicate that there is a decline in unethical practices within the industry compared to the pre- 1999 era. The more common form of bribery is financial. Quantity surveyors were perceived as the most susceptible to bribery among the professionals in the industry. The builder/ construction manager faces the greatest pressure to act unethically among the professionals in the construction industry. The study recommends that professional institutions should give more priority consideration to ethical discourse at technical sessions, public lectures, and seminars. Furthermore, project financiers should ensure <b>adequate</b> and prompt <b>remuneration</b> for professional services. Since the quantity surveyors are perceived as the most susceptible to bribery, clients should ensure that their discretionary powers in the procurement of building projects are limited or subjected to third party verification.

40|$|Purpose: In {{this paper}} an {{evaluation}} of the most important components of human resources management (HRM) which {{have a significant impact on}} increasing of the competitiveness of the company was presented. The procedure of employment and qualification of employees, training, evaluation and dismissal of workers were showed. Design/methodology/approach: The implementation of the employees remuneration and motivation systems in the organization were proposed. Resulting of this action will be the work efficiency improvement, staff mobilizing to achieve the setting objectives, and assurance that employees by <b>adequate</b> motivation and <b>remuneration,</b> will be react for the customer needs in desirable manner. Findings: The supplement of HRM system in the organization about two missing elements will ensure improvement of the quality of work carried out and the awareness of the employees for the manner of their remuneration and motivating. Research limitations/implications: As a result of searching and implementation of improvements, the organization makes more attractive, both among the customers and the candidates for the job. Both groups are looking for a reliable partner for cooperation, therefore the implementation of such important elements of HRM as motivation and remuneration systems, increases the interest of the customers in organization and makes it an interesting place to work, even for very demanding employee. Practical implications: Evaluation of HRM showed that in order to fully usage of the potential of the company, one should complete the HRM process for additional activities such as remuneration and motivating of the employees. They will have a positive impact on the functioning of the organization and the quality of work of the employed employees.

40|$|Objective: 1) To {{evaluate}} the participation rate {{and identify the}} practical barriers to implementing a community pharmacist-led medication review service in francophone Switzerland and, 2) To assess the effectiveness of external support. Methods: A qualitative survey was undertaken to identify barriers to patient inclusion and medication review delivery in daily practice among all contactable independent pharmacists working in francophone Switzerland (n= 78) {{who were members of}} a virtual chain (pharmacieplus), regardless of their participation in a simultaneous cross-sectional study. This study analyzed the dissemination of a medication review service including a prescription and drug utilization review with access to clinical data, a patient interview and a pharmaceutical report to the physicians. In addition, we observed an exploratory and external coaching for pharmacists that we launched seven months after the beginning of the cross-sectional study. Results: Poor motivation on the part of pharmacists and difficulties communicating with physicians and patients were the primary obstacles identified. Lack of time and lack of self-confidence in administering the medication review process were the most commonly perceived practical barriers to the implementation of the new service. The main facilitators to overcome these issues may be well-planned workflow organization techniques, strengthened by an <b>adequate</b> <b>remuneration</b> scheme and a comprehensive and practice-based training course that includes skill-building in pharmacotherapy and communication. External support may partially compensate for a weak organizational framework. Conclusions: To facilitate the implementation of a medication review service, a strong local networking with physicians, an effective workflow management and a practice- and communications-focused training for pharmacists and their teams seem key elements required. External support can be useful to help some pharmacists improve their service management skills. <b>Adequate</b> <b>remuneration</b> seems necessary to encourage initial investments to provide such a service. Future research in this area may help improve the process and design of training programs, as well as the monitoring of implementation for each new pharmaceutical service...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} a study {{examining}} the direct and indirect costs to volunteer carers of providing a fostering service in Australia. The study highlights the current difficulties in carer recruitment and retention, the increases in the challenging and complex needs of the children coming into care, and the growing professionalism of fostering. The study uses a budgetary approach to estimate the direct costs of fostered children. In-depth interviews and focus groups with carers are instrumental in providing a range of perspectives that assist {{our understanding of how}} the direct costs of fostered children are different from (higher than) the costs of other children. The study found the costs of fostered children were 40 per cent higher than the costs of children not in care. The thesis indicates that, to maintain and retain a volunteer workforce, an <b>adequate</b> carer <b>remuneration</b> system to meet the direct costs of fostered children is critical. To examine the indirect costs of fostering, the study uses a multi-method approach providing a monetary value of the opportunity costs (foregone earnings model) and time costs (proxy good or market replacement model) for foster carers. The emotional and psychological dimensions of fostering are also examined, though no monetary value is assigned to these costs. Carers&# 146; vivid and contrasting stories from the interviews explain how &# 145;money&# 146; fits with carer motivation and fostering&# 146;s more professional role, how carers perceive the nature of fostering (job or parenting), and whether carers should be paid to foster. Revelations of fostering&# 146;s emotional and time dimensions and restricted employment opportunities (indirect costs) highlight the impact fostering has on carers and their families. The study found that the indirect costs of fostered children were around four times the value of the direct costs. In light of the growing professionalism of contemporary foster care, difficulties in carer recruitment/retention, and the demanding nature of fostering, the thesis examines whether carers should be paid for the service they provide (compensation for indirect costs). Using a number of theoretical concepts developed by feminist economists and social theorists on paying for caring labour, the thesis found support for the contention that altruism (&# 145;love&# 146;) and carer pay (&# 145;money&# 146;) are not incompatible, and ambiguities and tensions for foster mothers around money and love can be resolved. Studies of countries where carers receive a wage component as part of their remuneration package provide insights into wage levels, perceived adequacy of the wage, and the impact of wages on carer recruitment/retention. The study found that, due to the profoundly gendered nature of fostering, the compensatory aspects of remuneration (fee/wage or salary) are generally poor. The implications for government welfare spending of paying Australian carers are discussed, and the savings to governments of using a volunteer workforce are demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the experiences of}} women working in the adventure recreation industry in Western Australia. Ten women employed in the local adventure recreation industry were selected as a cross-section sample. Selection criteria for this study included employment in the industry {{for more than five}} years, competency in several adventure recreation activities and extensive field experience in 2 Ì† 2 hands-on 2 Ì† 2 instructional roles. The women selected ranged in age from twenty-seven to fifty years of age. Years of employment in the adventure recreation industry ranged from five to thirty years. The {{purpose of this study was}} to describe the realities of working in the adventure recreation industry; explore the shared meanings held by the women about being a woman employed in adventure recreation; and investigate issues relating to women and non-traditional employment, in particular the adventure recreation industry. Research questions addressed access to employment, attraction of the adventure recreation industry, the meanings associated with women working in adventure recreation, and the influence of gender on their working experience. Interpretive interactionism was chosen as the qualitative research method. Two in-depth interviews were conducted with each of the women. The first interview sought answers to the research questions. The second interview provided an opportunity to clarify emergent themes and ensure the data interpretation was valid. Feminist poststructural theory guided the research process as it focused on power relationships, subjectivity and resistance, and was concerned with disrupting or displacing dominant discourses. The principal findings of this study related to the difficulties of meeting the physical and emotional demands of working in the adventure recreation industry. Lack of recognition of the responsibilities placed on women working in the adventure recreation industry was a major area of concern. Many of the women in this study felt that the perception that their job was easy and enjoyable did not meet the reality of their working life. Lack of <b>adequate</b> financial <b>remuneration</b> was also a major concern. It was felt that the remuneration offered by the industry was insufficient to compensate for its demands. Many women worked long hours and spent extended periods of time away from home, often to the detriment of social and family interactions. Lack of recognition and financial reward was compensated by the diverse range of opportunities offered for personal challenge and flexibility in working arrangements. Many of the women in this study acknowledged a close affinity with the natural environment and expressed their enjoyment of being active outdoors. Sharing their knowledge of technical skills, demonstrating how to appreciate the natural environment and be comfortable outdoors were major factors in career satisfaction. The adventure recreation industry has traditionally adopted male-defined attitudes and practices. Gender-based discrimination was often tolerated and seldom challenged. The predominance of masculine values within the adventure recreation industry has made it difficult for women to attain positions of power and influence. It was recognised that the position for women within the Western Australian adventure recreation industry was changing. As more women enter the adventure recreation workplace, traditional values are being challenged. The women in this study were moving into managerial and administrative positions and were gaining the power to create new opportunities and workplace environments that met the needs of women...|$|R

Transport and courier services are two of the major areas that facilitates the wheel of any sustainable development economy, the enhance internal and international trades, if properly managed. Logistics application to this, will be that aspect of business activity which sees to the general coordination of the total supply chain process of an institution, in this case ensuring that the two industries in view satisfy the populace, maximise profits and achieve set goals and objectives by putting in place those structures that will enhance their productivities at the right time, place, and value. This study is intended to explore, and investigate the present transport and courier Service operations in Nigeria, addressing salient issues, first, on, how the country can develop on the existing structures. Secondly, identify the factors hindering the sustainable development of these industries. Thirdly, to bring to focus why after over thirty years of independence, these industries are still struggling to live up to expectations. This academic essay was able to identify most of the impediments to the development of the transport and courier services operations in Nigeria, which includes; bad and dilapidated road networks, corruption, unstable government, inconsistent government developmental policies on the economy, insecurity of lives and properties, lack of maintenance culture, bureaucratic customs & exercise activities at the nations ports, high & unreasonable taxes and levies on operating companies, inadequate operational standards in the industries, epileptic power supply system, incessant communal upheaval and labour unrest, etc. Candid recommendations were made on the way forward for the country, in the areas of active participation of both the public and private sectors towards assisting government on development programmes, tackling the issue of corruption which has eating deep in the lives of many office holders, making good policies that create enabling environment for foreign direct investment, repairing and maintaining of existing infrastructures and building new ones, rehabilitating the now obsolete national railways and airline systems, reorienting the populace on good virtues of life, reduce and eliminate unnecessary levies on operators in the industries, provision and extension of communication, electricity, mass transport system to rural areas, investing in education, reducing crime and unemployment rate and providing logistics support and empowerment to the government arm that regulates the activities of these industries. The industries were recommended to look inwards into staff trainings & development, security, <b>remuneration,</b> <b>adequate</b> disciplinary measures when the need arises, provision of pension & insurance scheme. The need for them to use modern state of the arts technologies and the application of logistics in their daily operations was emphasised. Taxes and levies due government should be paid as at when due and not averted...|$|R
40|$|PROBLEM BEING ADDRESSED: Because {{some family}} {{physicians}} choose to stop providing maternity care, many {{women and their}} physicians have to seek this care from other providers. These providers must respect family physicians' relationships with patients {{and the necessity of}} returning the family to the referring physician for primary care after appropriate maternity and newborn care has been provided. OBJECTIVE OF PROGRAM: To design a clinic to address this problem and to deal with the practical issues, such as preservation of lifestyle, <b>adequate</b> <b>remuneration,</b> and avoiding litigation, family physicians face when they choose to practise obstetrics. To provide role models and training opportunities for future family physicians. MAIN COMPONENTS OF PROGRAM: Compatibility and cooperation among member physicians is essential in order to provide care to a substantial number of patients using an established protocol. A well-organized call schedule allows clinic physicians to enjoy a reasonable lifestyle. CONCLUSIONS: The clinic, established and organized by family physicians, provides family-centred maternity care for women and their families when their family physicians choose not to practise obstetrics...|$|E

Each year approximately 13 000 refugees settle in Australia, mostly from countries with minimal public and personal health resources. They may present in a very different manner to the rest of the population and are at risk of unfamiliar and complex illnesses. Their health care can be difficult and time consuming and the general practitioners who supply this care need support, guidance and <b>adequate</b> <b>remuneration.</b> The new Medicare Benefits Schedule item numbers 714 and 716 are an acknowledgment by the Australian government of these concerns of community GPs who are seeing refugees for their initial health assessments.

40|$|Stress {{prevalence}} in {{the larger}} society also affects library practitioners. This makes stress studies amongst these information professionals both topical and challenging. The subsisting dearth of stress-based reports in the library professional literature available to the researchers provided further motivation for this investigation. The research setting is Imo State of Nigeria while the subjects of study consist of librarians and library officers drawn from different in the state libraries. Data were collected through a customized questionnaire designed to elicit information on signs, types, causes, consequences and remedies to stress among the respondents. Results show that the major signs of stress are tiredness, headache, forgetfulness and insomnia resulting from unfavorable situations and events at home and work place, in addition t, negative personal lifestyle. The major consequences of stress revealed in this study included: decline in productivity, quarrelsomeness, martial crises and in health complications. <b>Adequate</b> <b>remuneration</b> of library staff, positive lifestyle and other remedies proffered in this report, which were influenced by the findings, would assist in ameliorating the adverse consequences of stress amongst library personnel in the study location and elsewhere...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To gain {{a deeper}} {{understanding}} of the range of influences on the full range of dental professionals who provide treatment for temporomandibular disorders (TMD). Design: Qualitative semi-structured interviews. Setting: Primary and secondary care in the North and South of the United Kingdom. Sample and method: A criterion-based purposive sample was taken of dental practitioners, comprising primary and secondary care practitioners. In-depth interviews were conducted and data collection and analysis occurred concurrently until data saturation was achieved. Data and discussion: There was a reported lack of <b>adequate</b> <b>remuneration</b> for provision of treatment for TMD within primary care. This alongside the primary care practitioners' reported uncertainty in diagnosis of TMD appeared to lead to a propensity for referral to secondary care. Practitioners recognised a poor and scanty evidence base on which to base their care, and this allowed for idiosyncratic practice. Often the outcome measure for treatment was a subjective questioning of the patient focussing mainly on relief of pain. Conclusion: There is a need for better quality evidence on which to base TMD treatment, more continuing professional development and improvement in contracting arrangements to enable primary practitioners to feel confident in managing TMD...|$|E
40|$|Child labourers play an {{integral}} role in households' income diversification process by contributing to farm and non-farm incomes but policies, {{including that of}} the ILO have focused largely on eliminating child labour from the agricultural sector through education. This study sought to ascertain the relative contribution of child labourers to farm and non-farm income using the GLSS 6 data and employed a SUR estimation that simulated, empirically, with child's education. Findings showed that as a child labourer spends more time in school, every Gh 2 Ì† 0 b 51. 00 contributed to farm income {{is accompanied by a}} Gh 2 Ì† 0 b 52. 12 contribution towards non-farm income. By implication, child education policy removes child labourers from the farm but are likely to have a paradoxical effect of pushing these children into non-farm activities as they engage in them after school and during weekends. The suggestion is that governments must provide <b>adequate</b> <b>remuneration</b> for workers and pay a good price for agricultural products so that households do not use children as instruments to diversity their income portfolios, since child labour acts as a push factor in the diversification process...|$|E
40|$|An {{increasing}} number of studies explore the association between financial and non-financial incentives and the retention of health workers in developing countries. This study aims to contribute to empirical evidence on human resource for health motivation factors to assist policy makers in promoting effective and realistic interventions. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in four rural Tanzanian districts to explore staff stability and health workers' motivation. Data were collected using qualitative and quantitative techniques, covering all levels and types of health facilities. Stability of staff {{was found to be}} quite high. Public institutions remained very attractive with better job security, salary and retirement benefits. atisfaction over working conditions was very low owing to inadequate working equipment, work overload, lack of services, difficult environment, favouritism and 'empty promotions'. Positive incentives mentioned were support for career development and supportive supervision. Attracting new staff in rural areas appeared to be more difficult than retaining staff in place. The study concluded that strategies to better motivate health personnel should focus on <b>adequate</b> <b>remuneration,</b> positive working and living environment and supportive management. However, by multiplying health facilities, the latest Tanzanian human resource for health plan could jeopardize current positive results. Peer reviewe...|$|E
