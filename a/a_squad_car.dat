She told a Miami Herald interviewer, [...] "You get a different perspective by doing research... You can't know what it's like to be a cop even though you've seen it in the movies. But nobody ever saw a 9-1-1 center. I thought they lived in the ground somewhere! It was interesting to see who they were and how they deal and how stressful it can be. I was a wreck watching them. They would just be as cool as can be doing their thing. I thought, 'I could never do this job.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Peckinpah's {{intake of}} alcohol {{increased}} dramatically while making The Getaway, {{and he was}} fond of saying, [...] "I can't direct when I'm sober." [...] He and McQueen got into occasional heated arguments during filming. The director recalled one such incident {{on the first day of}} rehearsal in San Marcos: [...] "Steve and I had been discussing some point on which we disagreed, so he picked up this bottle of champagne and threw it at me. I saw it coming and ducked. And Steve just laughed." [...] McQueen had a knack with props, especially the weapons he used in the film. Hill remembered, [...] "You can see Steve's military training in his films. He was so brisk and confident in the way he handled the guns." [...] It was McQueen's idea to have his character shoot and blow up <b>a</b> <b>squad</b> <b>car</b> in the scene where Doc holds two police officers at gunpoint.|$|E

500|$|Audio {{tracks were}} mixed with {{recorded}} sounds from real subway cars, {{as well as}} PA system announcements, to make the episode sound more authentic. In the original episode, Pembleton grabbed Biedron by {{the collar of his}} shirt while Biedron sat in the back of <b>a</b> <b>squad</b> <b>car</b> during one of the final scenes. The scene was modified so that Pembleton only looked at Biedron, because Yoshimura felt that the scene was just as effective without him grabbing Biedron. During the last scene of the episode, in which Lange's girlfriend jogs by the subway station and ignores the emergency vehicles, Rabinowitz was originally instructed to include a musical score. He tried many different types of music, including rock music, Irish music, classical music, jazz, and piano riffs. When none of the music worked, Fontana suggested including no music at all, and it was agreed the silence was the most effective solution. Fontana said that after watching the episode repeatedly during the editing process, he liked the final product but doubted he would watch it again for a long time because it was [...] "too emotionally draining".|$|E
