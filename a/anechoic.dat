5|$|The hull is {{constructed}} from a high-tensile micro-alloy steel, developed by Swedish steel manufacturer SSAB, and improved by BHP of Australia, which was lighter {{and easier to}} weld than the HY-80 or HY-100 nickel-alloy steel used in contemporary submarine construction projects, while providing better results in explosion bulge testing. The submarines are covered in a skin of <b>anechoic</b> tiles to minimise detection by sonar: Collins was retrofitted with the tiles after the standard sonar signature of the submarine had been established, while the other five boats were covered during construction. These tiles were developed by the Australian DSTO: as the United States and United Kingdom would not share their information on the tiles used on their nuclear submarines, Australian researchers had to develop the tiles from scratch. The tiles were moulded {{in the shape of}} the hull, and are secured by a commercial adhesive normally used to fix cat's eyes to road surfaces: although British and American submarines are often seen with missing tiles, as of March 2007, none have been lost from a Collins-class boat.|$|E

25|$|The Main Base is {{also the}} home of the Benefield <b>Anechoic</b> Facility (BAF), an {{electromagnetic}} and radio frequency testing building. It is also home to the Air Force Flight Test Center Museum, which has over 15 aircraft on display.|$|E
25|$|Driver design—including the {{particular}} way {{two or more}} drivers are combined in an enclosure to make a speaker system—is both an art, involving subjective perceptions of timbre and sound quality and a science, involving measurements and experiments. Adjusting a design to improve performance is done {{using a combination of}} magnetic, acoustic, mechanical, electrical, and material science theory, and tracked with high precision measurements and the observations of experienced listeners. A few of the issues speaker and driver designers must confront are distortion, radiation lobing, phase effects, off-axis response, and crossover artifacts. Designers can use an <b>anechoic</b> chamber to ensure the speaker can be measured independently of room effects, or any of several electronic techniques that, to some extent, substitute for such chambers. Some developers eschew <b>anechoic</b> chambers in favor of specific standardized room setups intended to simulate real-life listening conditions.|$|E
25|$|The first EA-18G test {{aircraft}} entered {{production on}} 22 October 2004. The first test aircraft, known as EA-1, was rolled out on 3 August 2006, before making its maiden flight at St. Louis on 15 August 2006; {{it was later}} ferried to Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland on 22 September 2006. EA-1 primarily supports ground testing in the Air Combat Environment Test and Evaluation Facility (ACETEF) <b>anechoic</b> chamber.|$|E
25|$|For {{incidentally}} discovered dermoids, diagnosed on ultrasound {{by their}} pathognomonic echogenic fat, either surgical removal or yearly follow up is indicated, regardless of patient age. For peritoneal inclusion cysts, {{which have a}} crumpled tissue-paper appearance and tend to follow the contour of adjacent organs, follow up is based on clinical history. Hydrosalpinx, or fallopian tube dilation, can be mistaken for an ovarian cyst due to its <b>anechoic</b> appearance. Follow-up for this is also based on clinical presentation.|$|E
25|$|Differentiation between {{proximal}} enteritis {{and small}} intestinal obstruction {{is important to}} ensure correct treatment, and can be assisted {{with the help of}} ultrasound. Horses with small intestinal obstruction will usually have an intestinal diameter of -10nbsp&cm with a wall thickness of 3-5mm. Horses with proximal enteritis usually have an intestinal diameter that is narrower, but wall thickness is often greater than 6mm, containing a hyperechoic or <b>anechoic</b> fluid, with normal, increased, or decreased peristalsis. However, obstructions that have been present for some time may present with thickened walls and distention of the intestine.|$|E
25|$|The Engineering Division and the Electronic Warfare Group {{provide the}} central {{components}} in conducting the Test and Evaluation {{mission of the}} 412 TW. They provide the tools, talent and equipment for the core disciplines of aircraft structures, propulsion, avionics and electronic warfare evaluation of the latest weapon system technologies. They also host the core facilities that enable flight test and ground test—the Range Division, Benefield <b>Anechoic</b> Facility, Integrated Flight Avionics Systems Test Facility and the Air Force Electronic Warfare Evaluation Simulator. The Project and Resource Management Divisions provide {{the foundation for the}} successful program management of test missions.|$|E
25|$|The {{launch of}} Collins was {{originally}} planned for 1994, but was later set for August 1993. The submarine was launched by shiplift on 28 August 1993. Although launched on schedule, {{she was not}} complete: {{the design of the}} submarine had not been finalised, important internal pipes and fittings had not been installed, the components of the combat system had not been delivered, and some sections of 'hull' were sheets of timber painted black so the submarine would appear complete in photographs of the launching ceremony. Within weeks of the launch, the boat was removed from the water, and it was not until June 1994 that she was completed. Work on the other submarines in the class was delayed by the extra effort put in for Collins to meet her launching date, and by the subsequent work to complete her. The submarines are covered in a skin of <b>anechoic</b> tiles to minimise detection by sonar: Collins was retrofitted with the tiles after the standard sonar signature of the submarine had been established, while the other five boats were covered during construction.|$|E
500|$|Sankt Peterburg {{is first}} boat of Rubin Design Bureau's Lada class, {{of which a}} total of eight were {{expected}} to be procured by the Russian Navy. A less capable version, the , is marketed for export. Designed during the 1990s, the St. Petersburg class is intended to be the successor to the larger Kilo class. The Kilo class is considered {{to be one of the}} quietest diesel classes in operations, giving rise to the nickname [...] "Black Hole". [...] Among the expected capabilities improvements of the St. Petersburg class over its predecessor were the incorporation of improved <b>anechoic</b> coating (to minimize sonar contact), extended cruise range, and the upgrade to newer weapons for anti-submarine and anti-ship operations. St. Petersburg-class boats can also conduct reconnaissance and defend naval facilities and sea lanes.|$|E
500|$|During {{the first}} part of the queue, guests viewed a sample repair and test shop. As guests entered the queue in the welcome center they were shown tests {{performed}} on cars and parts before being released. [...] The queue wound by different tests for tires and car doors, an <b>anechoic</b> chamber for radio receivers, and an area for crash test dummies to be tested. [...] At the end of the queue a group of guests would be brought into a briefing room where they were shown automobile testing facilities and examples of tests being performed. [...] The host, Bill McKim (John Michael Higgins) told the guests that they would take part in some of these tests and also told the technician Sherrie what tests to set up. [...] Small videos of each test were shown as he spoke. [...] He finally told her to choose one final [...] "surprise test," [...] and a video of a car crashing into a barrier was shown as a door opened for guests to enter the interior queue.|$|E
2500|$|Robinson and Dadson refined {{the process}} in 1956 to obtain {{a new set of}} equal-loudness curves for a frontal sound source {{measured}} in an <b>anechoic</b> chamber. The Robinson-Dadson curves were standardized as ISO 226 in 1986. In 2003, [...] was revised as equal-loudness contour using data collected from 12 international studies.|$|E

2500|$|Sand {{presents}} as a homogenous {{gray and}} allows the ultrasound waves to penetrate deep. It is distinguishable from feces, which is less homogenous, and gas colic, which does not allow the operator to see pass the gas. Additionally, the sand usually [...] "sparkles" [...] on ultrasound if it moves. Sand is best diagnosed using a 3.5 megahertz probe. Horses with gastrointestinal rupture will have peritoneal fluid accumulation, sometimes with debris, visible on ultrasound. Horses with peritonitis will often have <b>anechoic</b> fluid, or material in between visceral surfaces.|$|E
2500|$|On 22 October 2010, the Ministry of Defence {{confirmed}} that Astute had [...] "run into difficulties" [...] off the Isle of Skye while on trials, after eyewitnesses reported the submarine had run aground {{a few miles}} from the Skye Bridge. There were no reports of injuries. The captain of the vessel elected to wait for tug assistance, rather than use the submarine's own power to clear the stern from the obstruction, to minimise the damage to the hull's <b>anechoic</b> tiles. A Royal Navy spokesperson said the vessel had been grounded on silt, and was re-floated at high tide. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency-chartered emergency tow vessel Anglian Prince was dispatched to the scene from Stornoway.|$|E
2500|$|Herb Pilhofer and Tom Jung {{worked at}} Kay Bank before {{founding}} the world's first digital recording studio, Sound 80 in 1969. Sound 80 recorded numerous artists over the years, ranging from Bob Dylan's Blood on the Tracks to works from Dave Brubeck. The studio {{now is the}} headquarters of Orfield Laboratories, whose <b>anechoic</b> chamber, is labeled the world's [...] "quietest room" [...] by the Guinness Book of World Records as of 2012. Orfield lab also achieved the designation for their friends at sound 80 as [...] "the world's first digital recording studio" [...] in the 2006 Guinness World Records. The two main studios are still fully intact, and they are filed for historic designation by the State and the Federal Government.|$|E
2500|$|As a {{refinement}} {{of the preceding}} Swiftsure-class, {{the design of the}} Trafalgar-class bears some similarity, including its internal layout and the Rolls-Royce PWR1 Core 3. However some improvements over the Swiftsure class include its reduced acoustic signature, thanks to the hull being covered in <b>anechoic</b> tiles which are designed to absorb sound rather than reflect it, making the boats quieter and more difficult to detect with active sonar. A pumpjet propulsion system is also used from boat 2 onward, rather than a conventional propeller. The Trafalgar-class are [...] long, have a beam of , a draught of [...] and a dived displacement of 5,300 tonnes. Each boat has a complement of 130. Like all Royal Navy submarines, the Trafalgar class have strengthened fins and retractable hydroplanes, allowing them to surface through thick ice.|$|E
2500|$|Building 20 was {{the home}} of [...] the Tech Model Railroad Club, where many aspects of what later became the hacker culture developed. [...] Around 1973, the MIT Electronic Research Society (MITERS) was founded there, as an early student-run hackerspace. [...] Building 20 also housed {{one of the first}} <b>anechoic</b> chambers, where {{research}} was performed by acoustics pioneer Leo Beranek. [...] Professor Amar Bose did his early research on loudspeakers here, eventually leading to the founding of Bose Corporation. Prolific analog circuit designer and technical writer Jim Williams had an electronics lab here for a decade, before moving on to National Semiconductor and then Linear Technology. The Strobe Lab of high-speed photography trailblazer Harold [...] "Doc" [...] Edgerton was located here for many years, although the facility was relocated to Building 4 before the final years of Building 20.|$|E
2500|$|In July 1971, Bryce Jordan {{became the}} university's first {{president}} and served until 1981. At {{that time the}} campus consisted of only one facility, the Founders Building. During Jordan's 10-year tenure the university received [...] of land in 1972 from the Hoblitzelle Foundation and the campus expanded {{with the addition of}} a number of new facilities including the Hoblitzelle Hall, Cecil H. Green Hall, J. Erik Jonsson Hall, Lloyd V. Berkner Hall, the Eugene McDermott Library, a campus bookstore and the Visual Arts Building. The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools granted accreditation to UT Dallas in 1972 and in 1973 the first UT Dallas diplomas were awarded. Prior to 1975 only graduate students were enrolled. Juniors and seniors were admitted for the first time in 1975 and enrollment increased from 700 in the fall of 1974 to 3,333 in 1975 and by the fall of 1977 to more than 5,300 students. The university's first bachelor's degree was awarded at the school's spring commencement in 1976. The Callier Center for Communication Disorders became part of the University of Texas at Dallas in 1975 as part of the School of Human Development (now the School of Behavioral and Brain Sciences). Also in 1975, the School of Management opened and has become the university's largest and offers programs at the undergraduate, graduate and executive levels. UT Dallas's first Nobel laureate, the late Polykarp Kusch, was a member of the physics faculty from 1972 to 1982. When he retired, the university endowed a program of annual lectures with the theme Concerns of the Lively Mind in his honor. Robert H. Rutford, an Antarctic explorer recognized with the naming of the Rutford Ice Stream and Mount Rutford in Antarctica, became the second president of UT Dallas in May 1982. Rutford served as head of the university until 1994. During his tenure as president, the university secured approval for a school of engineering, added freshmen and sophomores to its student body and built the first on-campus housing. UT Dallas school of engineering opened in 1986 due to the efforts of business, community and education leaders. The Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science is now the second-largest school at the university. By its 20th anniversary, in 1989, enrollment at UT Dallas topped 8,000. In 1990, the Texas Legislature authorized the university to admit freshman and sophomore students. [...] The Dallas philanthropist Peter O'Donnell had pushed for expansion of the university into a four-year institution. The Arts and Technology Building at UT-Dallas was named in 2013 in honor of O'Donnell's wife, Edith Jones O'Donnell. It was designed by VAI Architects and STUDIOS Architecture. The Edith O'Donnell Arts and Technology Building boasts 155,000 square feet and cost $60 million to build (20% of the building materials were recycled content). [...] The new building features an <b>anechoic</b> chamber, 3D art studios, a recording studio, a motion capture lab, and other classrooms purposed for arts and technology. The Edith O'Donnell Arts and Technology Building was also selected by the Nasher Sculpture Center as part of a ten location exhibit called the Nasher XChange. [...] Franklyn Jenifer became the third president of UT Dallas in 1994 and served until 2005. Under Jenifer, UT Dallas's enrollment increased from less than 8,500 to nearly 14,000.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Anechoic</b> {{chambers}} {{are commonly}} used in acoustics to conduct experiments in nominally [...] "free field" [...] conditions, free-field meaning {{that there are no}} reflected signals. All sound energy will be traveling away from the source with almost none reflected back. Common <b>anechoic</b> chamber experiments include measuring the transfer function of a loudspeaker or the directivity of noise radiation from industrial machinery. In general, the interior of an <b>anechoic</b> chamber is very quiet, with typical noise levels in the 10 - 20 dBA range. In 2005, the best <b>anechoic</b> chamber measured at &minus;9.4 dBA. [...] In 2015, an <b>anechoic</b> chamber on the campus of Microsoft broke the world record with a measurement of &minus;20.6 dBA. The human ear can typically detect sounds above 0 dBA, so a human in such a chamber would perceive the surroundings as devoid of sound. Anecdotally, some humans may not like such quietness and can become disoriented.|$|E
50|$|An {{acoustic}} duct or plane wave tube {{is a test}} facility used in acoustics. <b>Anechoic</b> chambers are typically subject to a low frequency limit, governed by {{the length of the}} sound absorbing wedges employed to prevent reflections within the chamber.
