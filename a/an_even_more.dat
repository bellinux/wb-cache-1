5|$|After several {{diplomatic}} {{failures and}} military defeats in the 1730s, Austria {{seemed to be}} declining, or even {{on the verge of}} collapse. After her forty years reign, Maria Theresa left a revitalised empire that influenced the rest of Europe throughout the 19thcentury. She gave the Habsburg dominions an efficient administrative system that allowed it to remain a great power in its own right, without the support of the Holy Roman Empire. Her descendants followed her example and continued reforming the empire. The acquisition of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria gave the empire <b>an</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> multinational character that would ultimately lead to its destruction. Her introduction of compulsory schooling, as a means of Germanisation, eventually triggered the revival of Czech culture.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there exist}} {{polynomial}} time algorithms {{to find a}} matrix having given row and column sums, the solution may be far from unique: any submatrix {{in the form of}} a 22 identity matrix can be complemented without affecting the correctness of the solution. Therefore, researchers have searched for constraints on the shape to be reconstructed that can be used to restrict the space of solutions. For instance, one might assume that the shape is connected; however, testing whether there exists a connected solution is NP-complete. <b>An</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> constrained version that is easier to solve is that the shape is orthogonally convex: having a single contiguous block of squares in each row and column.|$|E
5|$|By 1926, {{however, the}} Buffalo to Albany section of NY5 was {{relocated}} onto the Genesee Road alignment, replacing NY5A. NY5's former, more southerly alignment was redesignated as NY7. In 1927, {{the establishment of}} the U.S. Highway System created more numbering changes. US20, which mainly followed the Yellowstone Trail elsewhere in the country, was designated in New York along NY5 southwest of Hamburg and east of Albany and along old NY7 from Skaneateles to Albany. Between the towns of Hamburg and Avon, the new US20 used <b>an</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> southerly alignment, running via East Aurora and Warsaw. This truncated both ends of NY5 to Athol Springs (south of Buffalo in the town of Hamburg) in the west, and to Albany in the east.|$|E
5|$|In May 1645, Parliament {{passed an}} {{ordinance}} allowing excommunicants {{to appeal the}} church's sentences to Parliament. Another ordinance on 20October contained a list of sins to which the church would be limited in its power to excommunicate. To {{the majority of the}} divines' dismay, <b>an</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> Erastian ordinance was proposed in March 1646. The Assembly published a protest, provoking the Commons to charge it with breach of privilege and to submit nine questions to the divines on the matter. Votes were to be included with the answers, an attempt to force the divines associated with the protest petition to reveal themselves.|$|E

5|$|In November 1986 the Chiefs of Staff Committee and Minister for Defence Kim Beazley {{decided to}} {{transfer}} {{all of the}} RAAF's Iroquois and Sikorsky S-70 Black Hawk battlefield helicopters to the Army; the Chinooks remained with the RAAF at this time. The transfer of the RAAF's other helicopter types increased {{the cost to the}} service of operating the Chinooks, and made it more difficult to find aircrew for No. 12 Squadron. The RAAF subsequently proposed transferring the Chinooks as well, but the Army was unwilling to accept them. The problems the Army was experiencing keeping the Iroquois and Black Hawk helicopters operational may have influenced this position, with the service being reluctant to take on <b>an</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> complex helicopter type.|$|E

Bradman's share of the stand was 244 from 271balls, and the Australian total of 701 set up victory by 562runs. For the fourth time in five series, the Ashes changed hands. England would not recover them again until after Bradman's retirement.|$|E

The others are distracted by various temptations: George is distracted in the hospital his mother is staying at by an attractive nurse giving <b>an</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> attractive woman a daily sponge bath; Elaine visits a fitness club which is also patronized by John F. Kennedy, Jr.; Jerry is tempted by the naked woman across the street and frustrated because the woman he's dating won't have sex with him since she wants to remain a virgin.

5|$|Kurosawa {{wasted no}} time moving onto his next project: Madadayo, or Not Yet. Based on autobiographical essays by Hyakken Uchida, the film follows {{the life of a}} Japanese {{professor}} of German through the Second World War and beyond. The narrative centers on yearly birthday celebrations with his former students, during which the protagonist declares his unwillingness to die just yet—a theme that was becoming increasingly relevant for the film's 81-year-old creator. Filming began in February 1992 and wrapped by the end of September. Its release on April 17, 1993, was greeted by <b>an</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> disappointed reaction than had been the case with his two preceding works.|$|E
5|$|LSU and Alabama {{first met}} on the field in 1895, and have met {{annually}} since 1964. When former LSU head coach Nick Saban was hired in the same capacity at Alabama, their annual contest became, arguably, <b>an</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> heated rivalry than before. At {{the start of the}} 2011 season, Alabama was ranked No.2 and LSU was ranked No.4 in all of the major college polls, and prior to their annual meeting, each team defeated all eight of their opponents, and LSU moved into the No.1 spot after a victory over West Virginia. Statistically, the game matched two of the top defenses in both the SEC and all of college football.|$|E
5|$|Mary, a Roman Catholic, reigned {{during a}} period of great {{religious}} upheaval in Scotland. As a result of the efforts of reformers such as John Knox, a Protestant ascendancy was established. Mary caused alarm by marrying her Catholic cousin, Lord Darnley, in 1565. After Lord Darnley's assassination in 1567, Mary contracted <b>an</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> unpopular marriage with the Earl of Bothwell, who was widely suspected of Darnley's murder. The nobility rebelled against the Queen, forcing her to abdicate. She fled to England, and the Crown went to her infant son James VI, who was brought up as a Protestant. Mary was imprisoned and later executed by the English queen Elizabeth I.|$|E

Timothy Garton Ash calls the Polish October the most significant event in the post-war history of Poland until the rise of Solidarity. History professor Iván T. Berend claims that while {{the effects of the}} Polish October on the Eastern Bloc may be disputed, it set the course for the eventual fall of communism in the People's Republic of Poland.|$|E
5|$|Retiarii first {{appeared}} in the arena during the 1st century AD and had become standard attractions by the 2nd or 3rd century. The gladiator's lack of armour and his reliance on evasive tactics meant that many considered the retiarius the lowliest (and most effeminate) of an already stigmatised (i.e. gladiators) class. Passages from the works of Juvenal, Seneca, and Suetonius suggest that those retiarii who fought in tunics may have constituted <b>an</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> demeaned subtype (retiarii tunicati) who were not viewed as legitimate retiarii fighters but as arena clowns. Nevertheless, Roman artwork, graffiti, and grave markers include examples of specific net-men who apparently had reputations as skilled combatants and lovers.|$|E
5|$|Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester, {{had gained}} a {{dominant}} {{position in the}} government of the Kingdom of England after his victory at the Battle of Lewes a year earlier. He also held the King, Prince Edward, and the King's brother Richard of Cornwall in his custody. However, his sphere of influence began to shrink rapidly, owing to loss of key allies. In February, Robert de Ferrers, Earl of Derby was arrested and imprisoned in the Tower. <b>An</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> important collaborator, Gilbert de Clare, the Earl of Gloucester, deserted {{to the side of the}} King in May of the same year.
