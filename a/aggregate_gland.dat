40|$|Notostigmophora (Scutigeromorpha) {{exhibit a}} special {{tracheal}} system {{compared to other}} Chilopoda. The unpaired spiracles are localized medially on the long tergites and open into a wide atrium from which hundreds of tracheal tubules originate and extend into the pericardial sinus. Previous investigators reported that the tracheal tubules float freely in the hemolymph. However, here we show {{for the first time}} that the tracheal tubules are anchored to a part of the pericardial septum. Another novel finding is this part of the pericardial septum is structured as an <b>aggregated</b> <b>gland</b> on the basis of its specialized epithelium being formed by hundreds of oligocellular glands. It remains unclear whether the pericardial septum has a differently structure in areas that lack a connection with tracheal tubules. The tracheal tubules come into direct contact with the canal cells of the glands that presumably secrete mucous substances covering the entire luminal cuticle of the tracheal tubules. Connections between tracheae and glands have not been observed in any other arthropods...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} the webs of Linyphia triangularis (Clerck) and Microlinyphia pusilla (Sundevall) using light and scanning electronic microscopic techniques and compared {{them with the}} better known orb-webs. The linyphiid sheet-web consists of an unordered meshwork of fibres of different thicknesses. The sheet {{is connected to the}} scaffolding by the means of attachment discs. Thin threads with globules, which appear similar to the viscid silk droplets of orb-webs are present in most webs examined. Webs of M. pusilla had a higher density of these globules than did webs of L. triangularis. Webs of both species possess five types of thread connections and contain no aqueous glue for prey capture. Instead, unlike orb-webs, the sticky substances produced by the linyphiid <b>aggregate</b> <b>glands</b> cement the different layers and threads of the sheet by drying up after being produced. Due to the function, sheet webs may not require viscid silk, thereby leading to a more economic web. The assumption made in most previous studies, that the globules in linyphiid webs have the same properties and function as viscid silk in orb-webs, is unfounded...|$|R
60|$|Turning now to {{the action}} of organic substances, the glands on which bits of raw meat were placed became dark-coloured; and in 18 hrs. their {{contents}} were conspicuously <b>aggregated.</b> Several <b>glands</b> with bits of albumen and fibrin were darkened in between 2 hrs. and 3 hrs.; but in one case the purple colour was completely discharged. Some glands which had caught flies were compared with others close by; and though they did not differ much in colour, there was a marked difference in their state of aggregation. In some few instances, however, {{there was no such}} difference, and this appeared to be due to the insects having been caught long ago, so that the glands had recovered their pristine state. In one case, a group of the sessile colourless glands, to which a small fly adhered, presented a peculiar appearance; for they had become purple, owing to purple granular matter coating the cell-walls. I may here mention as a caution that, soon after some of my plants arrived in the spring from Portugal, the glands were not plainly acted on by bits of meat, or insects, or a solution of ammonia--a circumstance for which I cannot account.|$|R

60|$|Saxifraga rotundifolia (?).--The {{hairs on}} the flower-stems of this species are longer than those just described, and bear pale brown glands. Many were examined, and {{the cells of the}} pedicels were quite transparent. A bent stem was {{immersed}} for 30 m. in a solution of one part of carbonate of ammonia to 109 of water, and two or three of the uppermost cells in the pedicels now contained granular or <b>aggregated</b> matter; the <b>glands</b> having become of a bright yellowish-green. The glands of this species therefore absorb the carbonate much more quickly than do those of Saxifraga umbrosa, and the upper cells of the pedicels are likewise affected much more quickly. Pieces of the stem were cut off and immersed in the same solution; and now the process of aggregation travelled up the hairs in a reversed direction; the cells close to the cut surfaces being first affected.|$|R
60|$|I made also several {{experiments}} {{on the action}} of the vapour of the carbonate on the glands; but will give only a few cases. The cut end of the footstalk of a young leaf was protected with sealing-wax, and was then placed under a small bell-glass, with a large pinch of the carbonate. After 10 m. the glands showed a considerable degree of aggregation, and the protoplasm lining the cells of the pedicels was a little separated from the walls. Another leaf was left for 50 m. with the same result, excepting that the hairs became throughout their whole length of a brownish colour. In a third leaf, which was exposed for 1 hr. 50 m., there was much aggregated matter in the glands; and some of the masses showed signs of breaking up into brown granular matter. This leaf was again placed in the vapour, so that it was exposed altogether for 5 hrs. 30 m.; and now, though I examined a large number of <b>glands,</b> <b>aggregated</b> masses were found in only two or three; in all the others, the masses, which before had been globular, were converted into brown, opaque, granular matter. We thus see that exposure to the vapour for a considerable time produces the same effects as long immersion in a strong solution. In both cases there could hardly be a doubt that the salt had been absorbed chiefly or exclusively by the glands.|$|R

40|$|The spider family Mimetidae is {{represented}} in Chile and adjacent Argentina by at least eight spe-cies. One, Ero spinipes (Nicolet), belongs to a worldwide genus but {{seems to be a}} south temper-ate endemic. The remaining species belong to the apparently endemic genera Oarces and Gnolus. Al-though these two genera have been placed in dif-ferent families (the Mimetidae and Araneidae, re-spectively), genitalic characters indicate that they are sister taxa. Oarces and Gnolus differ from ar-aneids in lacking <b>aggregate</b> <b>gland</b> spigots on the posterior lateral spinnerets, and resemble mime-tids in having peg teeth on the cheliceral promar-gin; Gnolus is therefore transferred to the Mime-tidae. Typical Mimetinae, however, have modified cylindrical gland spigots not shared with Oarces and Gnolus, which are assigned to the subfamily Oarcinae Simon. Gnolus affinis Tullgren is newly synonymized with G. cordiformis (Nicolet). One new species (G. blinkeni), the first known males of G. cordiformis (Nicolet), G. spiculator (Nicolet), and G. angulifrons Simon, and the first known females of G. zonatulus Tullgren are described...|$|E
40|$|The spider <b>aggregate</b> <b>gland</b> from orb weaving spiders {{produces}} a glue that helps bind insects to the web. Very {{little is known}} about the glue, but possible applications for a synthetically produced aggregate protein range from underwater adhesives to surgical glue. We are cloning the aggregate cDNA to confirm and extend existing knowledge about the aggregate gene(s). mRNA was extracted from aggregate glands using TRIzol reagent, and then reverse transcribed using MMLV-RT to create single stranded DNA. The second strand was next synthesized employing DNA Polymerase I in conjunction with RNaseH to form cDNA. The cDNA was ligated into pBluescript II and transformed into electrocompetent DH 10 B bacterial cells. Bacteria were plated on ampicillin and plates used had a colony density of approximately 1000 colonies per plate. Libraries screening has commenced with a probe designed using data from two previously reported sequences for the aggregate gene. Preliminary screening of the library was unsuccessful, but the second highly efficient library is now available for further screening. We expect to obtain 2. 5 - 3 Kb of clear aggregate sequence from this library in order to confirm previous sequences and allow us to express this gene synthetically...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY The jejunal mucosa of {{patients}} with coeliac disease contains significantly fewer Paneth cells (PCC) per crypt (p < 0. 001) and tissue lysozyme activity (JLA) P < 0. 001) when compared {{with a group of}} subjects with normal jejunal mucosa. Neither PCC nor JLA return to normal with complete clinical recovery and otherwise complete histological recovery on a gluten free diet. There is a significant linear correlation between JLA and PCC suggesting that the Paneth cell is the principal source of jejunal lysozyme. The Paneth cell occupies a prominent site {{at the base of the}} small intestinal crypt and is a secretory cell discharging its granules in response to pilo-carpine (Cordier, 1923). It has been estimated that the adult small intestine contains 2 x 108 cells (Creamer and Pink, 1967) constituting an <b>aggregate</b> <b>gland</b> of similar size to the pancreas (Toner, 1968). Although the function of the cell and secretions remains unknown, the possibilities of dipeptidase digestive activity (Van Genderen and Engel, 1938) and nutritional support of the epithelial cell (Crea-mer, 1967) have both been proposed. Alternatively, a role in non-specific immunity is suggested by the finding that the cell contains and secretes lysozyme (Peeters and Van Trappen, 1975) and has phagocytic properties (Erlandsen and Chase, 1972). Little is known of the function and structure of the Paneth cell in disease but it has been reported that, in coeliac disease, reduced numbers of Paneth cells are found in patients who respond incompletely to gluten withdrawal (Creamer and Pink, 1967). The purpose of the present study, therefore, was to determine whether lysozyme was measurable in homogenates of small bowel biopsies and whether this was quantitatively related to the number of Paneth cells in the tissue. The effect of coeliac disease on these measurements was studied and compared with those in a group of subjects with normal jejunal mucosa...|$|E
