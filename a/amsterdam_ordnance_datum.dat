5000|$|In {{geographical}} terms, NHN is {{the reference}} plane for the normal {{height of a}} topographical eminence height {{above mean sea level}} used in the 1992 German Mean Height Reference System (...) [...] The plane is {{in the shape of a}} quasi-geoid. The reference height is a geodetic, fixed point on the New Church of St. Alexander at Wallenhorst in the German state of Lower Saxony. The geopotential height of this point was calculated in 1986 as part of the United European Levelling Network (UELN), based on the <b>Amsterdam</b> <b>Ordnance</b> <b>Datum,</b> which represents the average level of the North Sea.|$|E
40|$|Precise height {{differences}} (5 [...] 10 mm standard deviation) are {{of interest}} for applications such as maintenance of the <b>Amsterdam</b> <b>Ordnance</b> <b>Datum</b> and deformation analysis. For these applications the Global Positioning System (GPS) is a cost-effective alternative for classic leveling techniques. However, the constituents in the troposphere, of which water vapor is both spatially and temporally the most variable component, cause the GPS signals to be delayed. Several types of troposphere modeling are investigated for GPS leveling because the geometry causes the height component to be strongly affected by the signal delays. The dissertation describes physical, functional, and stochastic aspects of this modeling and gives recursive filtering techniques {{that can be used}} in the data processing. Static networks or baselines with geodetic receivers collecting two-frequency phase observables were assumed. The most important models and filters are implemented in simulation software with which the sensitivities of the height difference are analysed. By frequent estimation of zenith delays using mapping functions, biases in the filtered height differences can be largely avoided, but the use of spatiotemporal constraints with that turns out to have hardly a positive contribution and can even have a precision-deteriorating effect. A stochastic model for slant delays based on Kolmogorov turbulence shows to be potentially precision improving (10 [...] 30 % of the standard deviation), but this model is to be validated. Furthermore, the simulations show that, even for observation times longer than three hours, correctly resolving the GPS phase ambiguities has a precision improving effect of 15 [...] 20 %.

40|$|The {{differential}} interferometric {{synthetic aperture}} radar (DInSAR) remote sensing technique {{has proven to be}} invaluable in the remote monitoring of earth surface movements associated with the extraction and geostorage (subsurface injection) of natural resources (water, oil, gas). However, a significant limitation of this technique is the low density and uneven coverage that may be achieved over vegetated rural environments. The Intermittent Small Baseline Subset (ISBAS) method, an amended version of the established SBAS algorithm, has been designed to improve coverage over rural, vegetated, land cover classes by allowing for the intermittent coherence that is predominant in such areas. In this paper we perform a validation of the ISBAS method over an area of gas production and geostorage in North Holland, the Netherlands. Fortytwo ERS- 2 (SAR) C-band images (1995 - 2000) and 63 ENVISAT (ASAR) C-band images (2003 - 2010) were processed using the ISBAS technique and the derived measurements enabled the identification of subsidence patterns in rural and urban areas alike. The dominant feature was an area of subsidence to the west of Alkmaar, attributed to natural gas production from the Bergermeer reservoir, where subsidence rates in the region of 3 mm/year were measured. Displacements derived using linear and non-linear surface deformation models were validated with respect to the first order system of levelling benchmarks which form the <b>Amsterdam</b> <b>Ordnance</b> <b>Datum</b> (NAP). It was established that ISBAS products were accurate to within 1. 52 mm/year and 1. 12 mm/year for the ERS and ENVISAT data sets respectively. Error budgets were comparable to results using persistent scatterers interferometry (PSI) during a validation activity carried out in the European Space Agency Terrafirma project. These results confirm the capability of the ISBAS method to provide a more regular sampling of land motion measurements over gas fields that may be critically used in future to infer the properties of buried, fluid-filled, porous rock...|$|E
