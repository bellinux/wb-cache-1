5|$|A weary emperor who {{no longer}} cared for the throne, an heir who {{had no desire to}} assume the crown, discontent among ruling circles who were dismissive of the Imperial role in {{national}} affairs: all seemed to presage the monarchy's impending doom. Nevertheless, Pedro II was unconcerned that times <b>and</b> <b>conditions</b> were changing. After more than five decades on the throne, he had become complacent in a belief that the devotion and support of his subjects was immutable. Because of these factors, and the lack of an energetic response on the part of Pedro II, {{it has been argued that}} prime responsibility for the monarchy's overthrow rested with the Emperor himself.|$|E

5|$|Agricultural and {{forestry}} work were the traditional {{uses of the}} Finnhorse. The Finnhorse was never bred to be a particularly large or heavy draught horse, {{as it was the}} only horse breed of the country, and versatility was desired as the Finnhorse was also used as the primary steed of the cavalry. The climate <b>and</b> <b>conditions</b> of Finland necessitated that the breed be durable and hardy. As a result, the Finnhorse remained small but tough, and could pull heavy loads in difficult terrain and even in chest-deep snow. Relative to its size, the Finnhorse is among the most powerful workhorses in the world with the best animals able to pull as much as 200percent of their own weight.|$|E
5|$|Anderson et al. argue that, {{aside from}} acute care, {{emergency}} medicine can {{also play a}} significant role in public health.

Emergency departments are excellent locations to train health care providers and to collect data, because of the high number of patients. Emergency medicine also improves public health by preventing secondary disease developing from an initial presentation (initial symptoms), and it serves as the first line of defense in disaster scenarios.|$|E

40|$|In the {{previous}} experiment upon the so-called "Divided distance illusion", {{an amount of}} illusion was measured as a magnitude of over-estimation of the distance between two outer lines under the experimental situation where the length of outer lines was held constant, {{and the length of}} inner lines was varied. The present experiment was conducted to investigate the interactive effect between the outer lines and the inner ones by varing the length of outer lines. The length of the outer lines (lo) and the length of the inner lines (li) were both 10 mm, 20 mm, and 40 mm. And there were five experimental conditions by combining li's and lo's The li's and lo's combined in each condition were as follows: (<b>Condition</b> A) 10 <b>and</b> 10, (<b>Condition</b> B) 20 <b>and</b> 20, (<b>Condition</b> C) 40 <b>and</b> 40, (<b>Condition</b> D) 20 <b>and</b> 10, (ConditionE) 20 and 40. Experimental results in five conditions were grouped into three groups. These groups were as follows : (GroupI) A, B, and C; (GroupII) A, B, and D; (GroupIII) B, C, and E. And within each group, a ststistical analysis through the method of analysis of variance was done, and thereafter t-tests using error variance terms as denominators were applied to test significance of differences about the amounts of illusion between any pairs of conditions within a group. The results thus obtained were summarized as follows: (1) In Group I, Condition B was smaller than <b>Condition</b> A <b>and</b> <b>Condition</b> C with highly statistical significance where the distances between inner lines(d) were both 40 mm and 50 mm. (2) In Group II, the statistically {{significant differences were found between}} <b>Condition</b> D <b>and</b> <b>Condition</b> A where d was 40 mm; <b>and</b> between <b>Condition</b> D <b>and</b> <b>Condition</b> B where d was 50 mm. But amounts of illusion in Condition D varied in a similar way as <b>Condition</b> A <b>and</b> <b>Condition</b> B did. (3) In Group III, Condition E was smaller than Condition C with highly statistical significance where d's were both 40 mm and 50 mm, but there was no statistical significance between <b>Condition</b> E <b>and</b> <b>Condition</b> B. <b>And</b> <b>Condition</b> E was smaller than both <b>Condition</b> B <b>and</b> <b>Condition</b> C where d was 20 mm...|$|R
