40|$|An {{exhaustive}} search for shortly spaced repeats in 74 bacterial chromosomes reveals {{that they are}} much more numerous than is usually acknowledged. These repeats were divided into five classes: close repeats (CRs), tandem repeats (TRs), simple sequence repeats (SSRs), spaced interspersed direct repeats, and “others. ” CRs are widespread and constitute the most abundant class, particularly in coding sequences. The other classes are less frequent, but each individual element shows a higher potential for recombination, when the number of repeats and their distances are taken into account. SSRs and TRs are more frequent in pathogens, as expected given their role in contingency loci, but are also widespread in the other bacteria. The <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>CRs</b> shows that they have {{an important role in the}} evolution of genomes, namely by generating duplications and deletions. Several cases compatible with a significant role <b>of</b> small <b>CRs</b> in the formation of large repeats were detected.

40|$|OBJECT: The authors {{conducted}} a study to compare the complication rate (<b>CR)</b> <b>of</b> pediatric neurosurgical procedures in a general neurosurgery department to the CRs that are {{reported in the literature}} and to establish a baseline <b>of</b> <b>CR</b> for further targeted improvement of quality neurosurgical care. METHODS: The authors analyzed the prospectively collected data from a complication registration of 1000 consecutive pediatric neurosurgical procedures in 581 patients {{from the beginning of the}} registration in January 2004 through August 2008. A pediatric neurosurgeon was involved in 50. 5 % of the procedures. All adverse events (AEs) from induction of anesthesia until 30 days postoperatively were recorded. RESULTS: Overall, 229 complications were counted in 202 procedures. The overall CR was 20. 2 %, with a 2. 7 % intraoperative CR and a 17. 5 % postoperative CR. Tumor surgery was associated with the highest CR (32. 7 %), followed by CSF disorders (21. 8 %). The mortality rate was 0. 3 %. An unplanned return to the operating room in relation to an AE happened in 10. 5 % of all procedures and in 52 % of procedures associated with AEs, the majority of which were related to CSF disorders. CONCLUSIONS: The CR in pediatric neurosurgical procedures was significant, and more than half of the patients with an AE required a repeat surgical procedure. <b>Analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>CRs</b> should be a prerequisite for the prevention of complications and for the development of targeted interventions to reduce the CR (for example, infection rates) ...|$|R

The use of CR will see most of the spectrum white spaces being used opportunistically without causing any interference to the licensed or primary users. CRs can collaborate in order to address the channel fading and hidden terminal problems that may be experienced by a single radio. For modeling and <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>CR</b> networks, the use of game theory has received a wide acceptance in next generation and intelligent wireless communication systems. In this paper we make use of game theory approach to model and analyze cognitive radio networks in order to allow dynamic spectrum access in broadband wireless access networks.

We show that using repeated games and the discount factor, players can fairly access the uplink available channel without causing interference to each other...|$|E

The present paper {{is one of the}} first attempts to analyse the understanding and relevance <b>of</b> the <b>CR</b> <b>of</b> some major CEE companies that are leaders in sustainability reporting. This analysis is conducted in direct comparison with a similar analysis on major Western European companies. Methodologically, the paper intertwines two qualitative strands <b>of</b> research: an <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> 19 <b>CR</b> reports (12 from CEE and 7 from Western Europe) provides a general impression about the understanding <b>of</b> <b>CR</b> across different socio-political contexts.

40|$|A key {{parameter}} {{affecting the}} operation of differential evolution (DE) is the crossover rate Cr 2 [0; 1]. While very low values are recommended for and used with separable problems, on non-separable problems, which include most realworld problems, Cr = 0 : 9 has become the de facto standard, working well across a large range of problem domains. Recent work on separable and non-separable problems has shown that lower-dimensional searches {{can play an important}} role in the performance of search techniques in higher-dimensional search spaces. However, the standard value of Cr = 0 : 9 implies a very high-dimensional search, which is not effective for other search techniques. An <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>Cr</b> across its range [0; 1] provides insight into how its value affects the performance of DE and suggests how low values may be used to improve the performance of DE.

Besides oxygen isotopic analysis, other minerochemical and textural parameters may provide a useful tool to solve taxonomic and genetic problems related to these achondrites. The results of a detailed modal, textural and minerochemical analysis {{of a set of}} primitive achondrites are presented and compared with literature data. All the samples show an extremely variable modal composition among both silicate and opaque phases. A general trend of troilite depletion vs. silicate fraction enrichment has been observed, with differences among coarse-grained and fine-grained meteorites. In regard to the mineral chemistry, olivine shows marked differences between the acapulcoite-lodranite and winonaite groups, while a compositional equilibrium between matrix and chondrules for both groups, probably due to the scarce influence of metamorphic grade on this phase, was observed.
