5|$|Burger King {{introduced}} the Specialty Sandwich line under its Burger King and I promotional campaign {{developed by the}} J. Walter Thompson (JWT) agency. The advertisements featured customers and employees praising the new sandwiches accompanied with {{a brief description of}} the products being sold. Actor Stuart Pankin played a doorman in one commercial in the series. Another one of the promotions used was a scratch card game called What's my Specialty? where the customer would receive <b>a</b> <b>card</b> <b>with</b> their purchase in which they would have to match famous people to said person's profession. The commercial explained that if you expected to lose, you would be disappointed, as all cards were winners. Prizes included fries, sodas and sandwiches.|$|E
5|$|The {{computor}} cabinet {{included only}} four main controls. On {{the left side}} of the chassis, from top to bottom, were dials that set the wind direction, wind speed, target altitude and terminal velocity of the bomb. All of these inputs were set by reading their value in a small window on {{the left side of}} the dials. Additional windows provided output values for the indicated airspeed, course, and bombing angle (or range angle). Clips in the upper right held <b>a</b> <b>card</b> <b>with</b> levelling data, as well as notes about the sight or the bombs being dropped. The computor was also connected to several external sources. Compressed air was supplied from the engines to drive the mechanism, and an exhaust allowed the less dense used air to escape. Tubes were also connected to the pitot tube and static air source, which allowed the accurate measurement of airspeed. A separate electrical connection input the direction measured on the distant reading compass, using a selsyn.|$|E

25|$|UFC 8 – Time limits {{changed to}} 10 {{minutes in the}} first two rounds of the tournament, 15 minutes in the tournament final and Superfight. Time limits would {{continually}} change in the later UFC events. Fights could now be decided by a judges decision if the fight {{reached the end of the}} time limit. The panel was made up of three judges who simply raised <b>a</b> <b>card</b> <b>with</b> the name of the fighter they considered to be the winner. In this fashion, a draw was not possible since the only two possible outcomes of a decision were 3 to 0 or 2 to 1 in favor of the winner.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, {{in order}} to be fully {{compliant}} with the SDXC card specification, many SDXC-capable host devices are firmware-programmed to expect exFAT on cards larger than 32GB. Consequently, they may not accept SDXC cards reformatted as FAT32, even if the device supports FAT32 on smaller cards (for SDHC compatibility). Therefore, even if a file system is supported in general, it is not always possible to use alternative file systems on SDXC cards at all depending on how strictly the SDXC card specification has been implemented in the host device. This bears a risk of accidental loss of data, as a host device may treat <b>a</b> <b>card</b> <b>with</b> an unrecognized file system as blank or damaged and reformat the card.|$|E
25|$|In the Lefay Fragment, Digory is {{born with}} the ability to speak to trees and animals, and lives with an Aunt Gertrude, a former school {{mistress}} with an officious, bullying nature, who has ended up as a Government minister after a lifetime of belligerent brow-beating of others. Whenever his aunt is absent, Digory finds solace with the animals and trees, including a talking squirrel named Pattertwig. Polly enters the story as a girl next door who is unable to understand the speech of non-human creatures. She wants to build a raft to explore a stream which leads to an underground world. Digory helps construct the raft, but ends up sawing a branch from a talking tree necessary to complete it, in order not to lose face with Polly. This causes him to lose his supernatural powers of speech. The following day he is visited by his godmother MrsLefay who knows that Digory has lost his abilities and gives him <b>a</b> <b>card</b> <b>with</b> the address of a furniture shop which she instructs him to visit. At this point the fragment ends.|$|E

500|$|From {{the premiere}} of the {{original}} Jeopardy! {{until the end of}} the first season of the current syndicated series, contestants were allowed to ring-in as soon as the clue was revealed. Since September 1985, contestants are required to wait until the clue is read before ringing-in. To accommodate the rule change, lights were added to the game board (unseen by home viewers) to signify when it is permissible for contestants to signal; attempting to signal before the light goes on locks the contestant out for half of a second. The change was made to allow the home audience to play along with the show more easily and to keep an extremely fast contestant from potentially dominating the game. In pre-1985 episodes, a buzzer would sound when a contestant signaled; according to Trebek, the buzzer was eliminated because it was [...] "distracting to the viewers" [...] and sometimes presented a problem when contestants rang in while Trebek was still reading the clue. Contestants who are visually impaired or blind are given <b>a</b> <b>card</b> <b>with</b> the category names printed in Braille before each round begins, and an audible tone is played after the clue has been read aloud.|$|E
500|$|Multi-color {{cards were}} {{introduced}} in the [...] set and typically use a gold frame to distinguish them from mono-color cards. These cards require mana from two or more different colors to be played and count as belonging {{to each of the}} colors used to play them. Multi-color cards typically combine the philosophy and mechanics of all the colors used in the spell's cost, and tend to be proportionally more powerful compared to single-color or hybrid cards, as requiring multiple colors of mana makes them harder to cast. More recently, two-color [...] "hybrid" [...] cards {{were introduced in}} the [...] set, and appeared extensively throughout the Shadowmoor and [...] sets. Hybrid cards are distinguished by a gradient frame with those two colors, and can be paid with either of the card's colors; for instance, <b>a</b> <b>card</b> <b>with</b> two hybrid-red/white icons can be cast using two red mana, two white mana, or one of each. Several sets have made multi-colored cards a theme, including Invasion, Shards of Alara, both Ravnica blocks and others. Core sets do not typically include multi-color cards in them, although the Core 2013 set was the first to do so.|$|E

During their disagreement Tracy also says that [...] "we have a black president now", referring to Barack Obama, but Liz says that he voted for Ralph Nader. According to J. Jeremy Wisnewski in [...] "Race At The Rock: Race Cards, White Myths, And Postracial America", this plotline is an example of people [...] "want to have race and do away with it too." [...] Tracy wants to be treated equally but also wants to continue behaving the way he is used to. Wisnewski says {{that by the end of}} the episode, Liz and Tracy, in reverting to [...] "the natural order", have come to understand the concept of equality; rather than forcing people [...] "to be equivalent to one another ... considering the different interests of people equally." ...|$|E

500|$|Asch's {{conformity}} {{experiment was}} conducted using 123 male {{participants who were}} told that they would be part of an experiment in visual judgment. Each subject was put into a group with 5 to 7 confederates (people who knew the true aims of the experiment, but were introduced as participants to the naive [...] "real" [...] participant). The group was shown <b>a</b> <b>card</b> <b>with</b> a line on it, followed by another card with 3 lines on it labeled a, b, and c. The participants were then asked to say which line matched in length the line on the first card. Each line question was called a [...] "trial". The [...] "real" [...] participant answered last or penultimately. For the first two trials, the subject would feel at ease in the experiment, as he and the other [...] "participants" [...] gave the obvious, correct answer. However, after the fourth trial, all of the confederates respond with the clearly wrong answer at certain points such that in 12 of the 18 trials they all gave the wrong answer. The 12 trials in which the confederates answered incorrectly were the [...] "critical trials". [...] The participant could thus either ignore the majority and go with his own senses or he could go along with the majority and ignore the clearly obvious fact. The aim was to see whether the real participant would change his answer and respond {{the same way as the}} confederates or stick with what his eyes plainly told him.|$|E
