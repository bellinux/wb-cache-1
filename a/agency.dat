40|$|Diagnosis of the {{transformation}} of executive governance in Europe must incorporate the diverse dynamics of EU-level <b>agencies.</b> This paper conceptualises theoretically and explores empirically multiple images of governance of EU-level <b>agencies.</b> Based on a rich body of survey (N= 265) and interview (N= 29) data among three regulatory and four non-regulatory EU level <b>agencies,</b> the paper demonstrates that EU-level <b>agencies</b> primarily combine the roles as autonomous administrative spaces and multilevel network administrations. Hence, EU-level regulatory and non-regulatory <b>agencies</b> blend two models of governance. Moreover, the most important role observed among EU-level <b>agencies</b> is indeed as multilevel network administrations. Finally, this paper demonstrates that EU-level non-regulatory <b>agencies</b> score systematically higher on all governance dynamics compared to EU-level regulatory <b>agencies.</b> The role as a multilevel network administrator is thus more central to EU-level non-regulatory <b>agencies,</b> whereas the role as an autonomous administrative space is more paramount among the EU-level regulatory <b>agencies...</b>|$|R
