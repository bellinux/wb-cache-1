The <b>aerobic</b> <b>biodegradability</b> of petroleum hydrocarbons in several formulations was determined using a simple microcosm/respirometric method based on carbon dioxide production and TPH depletion. The microcosms consisted of 1 L mason jars fitted with sealed rubber caps that allowed headspace gas samples to be collected in a sealed system. The analytical procedure included the detection of peaks for the compounds in TPH by gas chromatography and identification of peaks with a mass spectrometer (GCMS). Mole fractions of the major components in TPH (undecane, dodecane, tridecane and tetradecane) were calculated from the detected peaks. The extracted soil was analyzed for total organic carbon (TOC) content in order to examine the carbon balance. The method described here provides a simple and inexpensive method for determining the <b>aerobic</b> <b>biodegradability</b> of organics in soil. Results indicated that, for the polyacrylamide (PAM) treatments in soil, there was no significant CO 2 production in the headspace of the microcosm within the experimental time period. Total organic carbon values obtained for the initial and final soil showed no significant PAM biodegradation within a time period of 161 days. This confirms that PAM biodegradation is a slow process and may take several years...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAerobic and {{anaerobic}} digestions {{were compared}} in reactors fed with sonicated activated sludge. Sonication treatment of activated sludge led to solubilisation {{of matter and}} especially of organic compounds. An important improvement of <b>aerobic</b> and anaerobic <b>biodegradability</b> was observed for a sonication treatment of 108, 000 kJ kg TS− 1 due to the increase of the instantaneous specific soluble COD uptake rate. Sonication led to an increase of biogas production due to the increase of available soluble COD. In this study, sludge sonication prior to aerobic digestion in the aim of enhancing sludge reduction was inconclusive. Under anaerobic conditions, the enhancement of sludge reduction due to sonication depended on the disintegration degree of the sludge. The combination of high disintegration degree of sonicated sludge prior to an anaerobic digestion led to very good results in term of sludge reduction (80 %). Energy balance was also studied...|$|R

The {{objective of the}} work was confronting results of these tests with results obtained through “classic” standard respiration procedures (measuring consumption of oxygen or production of CO 2 for the aerobic conditions and measuring production of CO 2 and CH 4 for anaerobic conditions). Standard tests already earlier revealed that a “stepwise ” degradation course takes place with mixed films when unadapted inoculum is employed, which corresponds to gradual breakdown of particular components in a sequence corresponding to their biological degradation. In similar tests with analyzer MicroOxymax O 2 /CO 2 /CH 4 {{it was found that}} results of individual tests were in harmony, so that the analyzer, price disregarded, could prove to be a good alternative to existing standard tests...|$|R

This phenomenon was widely studied {{in order to understand the}} reason of its negative effects on hydraulic machinery such as pumps,turbines, valves, etc. Many efforts were made in order to better understand mechanisms of HC process with the main aim of preventing its generation and trying to avoid severe physical damage such as erosions, vibrations and noises. In recent years, in order to cope with a decrease in available water resources worldwide, an increasing demand of water by population in developing/developed countries and more restrictive environmental legislations on water quality, HC was increasingly used as a novel energy-efficient technique in the field of wastewaters treatment. The main purpose of this thesis is to investigate on the effectiveness of a modified swirling-jet device called Ecowirl reactor, patented by Econovation GmbH, Germany and produced and commercialized by Officine Parisi s. r. l., Italy. Experimental studies were carried out in order to evaluate the effects of different operative conditions and parameters such as reactor geometry, flow rate, flow velocity, pressure, medium pH, medium concentration and medium temperature on (i) the degradation of a toxic and carcinogenic pollutant dye (Rhodamine B, RhB) in waste dye aqueous solutions and on (ii) the improvement of activated sludge solubilisation and <b>aerobic</b> sludge <b>biodegradability</b> in the field of biological wastewater treatments.

The overall biodegradability, {{in terms of}} Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) was higher for TCF effluents (96 - 98 %) than for CB ones (82 - 93 %). Taking into account the higher organic load of CB effluents, this fact implied a much higher residual COD for them (100 - 180 mg/L) than for TCF effluents (10 - 30 mg/L). Furthermore, a refractory fraction of molecular weight higher than 43, 000 Da was found in CB effluent, which implied {{the necessity of a}} further specific treatment.

The {{catalytic}} wet air oxidation (CWAO) of paracetamol on {{activated carbon}} was investigated both in an autoclave reactor {{and in a}} fixed bed column as a regenerative treatment of carbon after adsorption (sequential adsorption-oxidation process ADOX). Three activated carbons (ACs) from different source materials were used as catalysts: two microporous basic ACs (S 23 and C 1) and a meso- and micro-porous acidic one (L 27). During the first CWAO experiment the adsorption capacity and catalytic performance of fresh S 23 and C 1 were {{higher than those of}} fresh L 27 despite its higher surface area. This situation changed after AC reuse, as finally L 27 gave the best results after five CWAO cycles.

40|$|Abstract This study evaluates <b>aerobic</b> and {{anaerobic}} <b>biodegradability</b> and {{toxicity of}} a real pharmaceutical wastewater, which focuses on antibiotics production. Zahn-Wellens and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) methodologies were applied in order to verify the wastewater's biodegradability and Microtox® analysis was performed for toxicity tests. Tests achieved more than 89 % and 63 % of Total Organic Carbon reduction, showing 80 % and 50 % of antibiotic removal, for aerobic and anaerobic processes, respectively. Moreover, acute ecotoxicological tests revealed that both techniques decreased the toxic character of real pharmaceutical wastewater. Desorption tests showed that the antibiotic was not degraded, but, in fact, adsorbed onto the sludge. Since biological treatment is {{the most widely used}} method for industrial wastewater treatment, this study indicates that this kind of treatment is probably unable to mineralize antibiotics present in pharmaceutical wastewaters, which may induce the development of resistant pathogens. Therefore, efforts must be taken to elucidate the main mechanisms of biological antibiotic removal from wastewaters since the presence of antibiotics in the environment is considered to be an emerging environmental issue...|$|R

This study characterizes the different COD fractions of dormitory grey water and investigates the effect of applying different conditions in the biodegradation test. The maximum <b>aerobic</b> and anaerobic <b>biodegradability</b> and conversion rate for the different COD fractions is determined. The results show that, on average, dormitory grey water COD fractions are 28 % suspended, 32 % colloidal and 40 % dissolved. The studied factors incubation time, inoculum addition and temperature are influencing the determined biodegradability. The maximum biodegradability and biodegradation rate differ between different COD fractions, viz. CODss, CODcol and CODdiss. The dissolved COD fraction is characterised by the lowest degradation rate, both for anaerobic and aerobic conditions.

40|$|Ten {{sulfonated}} {{aromatic amines}} were tested for their <b>aerobic</b> and anaerobic <b>biodegradability</b> and toxicity potential {{in a variety}} of environmental inocula. Of all the compounds tested, only two aminobenzenesulfonic acid (ABS) isomers, 2 - and 4 -ABS, were degraded. The observed degradation occurred only under aerobic conditions with inocula sources that were historically polluted with sulfonated aromatic amines. Bioreactor experiments, with non-sterile synthetic wastewater, confirmed the results from the aerobic batch degradation experiments. Both ABS isomers were degraded in long-term continuous experiment by a&blank;bioaugmented enrichment culture. The maximum degradation rate in the aerobic bioreactor was 1. 6 ¿ 1. 8 gl- 1 d- 1 for 2 -ABS and a somewhat lower value for 4 -ABS at hydraulic retention times (HRT) of 2. 8 ¿ 3. 3 h. Evidence for extensive mineralization of 2 - and 4 -ABS was based on oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide production during the batch experiments and the high levels of chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal in the bioreactor. Furthermore, mineralization of the sulfonate group was demonstrated by high recovery of sulfate. The sulfonated aromatic amines did not show any toxic effects on the aerobic and anaerobic bacterial populations tested. The poor biodegradability of sulfonated aromatic amines indicated under the laboratory conditions of this study suggests that these compounds may not be adequately removed during biological wastewater treatment...|$|R

The specific energy of ultrasonic treatment applied to the sludge was 200, 000 kJ kg TS- 1. Ultrasonic treatment led to floc size reduction and to organic matter solubilization. Low copper (< 5  mg L- 1) and cadmium (< 1  mg L- 1) concentration improved <b>aerobic</b> <b>biodegradability.</b> For high metal concentration the maximal instantaneous biogas production rate qmax inhibition by copper and cadmium was modeled by a saturation-type relationship under aerobic and anaerobic conditions.

Manual and chemical characterisations were also performed to organic fibre. Following this characterisation, a laboratory-scale thermophilic anaerobic digestion process and a pilot-scale composting process were carried out to determine the possibilities of these biological treatments.

The winemaking is a seasonal activity, for this reason generates, for a year, wastewaters with significant differences {{in terms of volume}} and composition, having different biodegradability. Initially, in this dissertation was studied the degradation of a wastewater, from the 2 nd racking, an aerobic system with different quantities of biomass, where it was obtained efficiencies of removal of COD of around 83 %, 78 % and 73 % for the biomass volumes of the 1, 25; 10 and 20 ml. Later, it was studied the degradation of a synthetic wastewater, in the same treatment system, with volumes of biomass of 10 and 20 ml, where it was found that 10 ml of biomass was the ideal quantity (based on the efficiency of removal of COD). The same aerobic system was applied, to the synthetic wastewater, to different temperatures (20, 25 e 30 ºC), noting that the temperatures of 25 ºC and 30 ºC had greater removal of COD (about 93 % and 89 %, respectively) and polyphenols (about 72 % and 70 %, respectively). For the temperatures studied, was determinate the kinetics of degradation (obtaining higher k to higher temperatures), where it was found that in higher temperatures is obtained more biodegradability.

Durante a etapa de prensagem do beneficiamento deste resÃduo, Ã gerado um lÃquido denominado LÃquido da Casca do Coco Verde (LCCV), que apresenta elevada concentraÃÃo de matÃria orgÃnica, cuja DQO varia de 60 a 80 gO 2 /L, incluindo taninos. Nesta Tese avaliou-se a {{performance}} de um reator anaerÃbio de fluxo ascendente e manta de lodo (Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket â UASB) e um Reator BiolÃgico com Fungos (RBF) para tratamento do LCCV. O UASB escala de bancada (16, 8 L) foi operado durante 222 dias, com carga orgÃnica volumÃtrica (COV) crescente, iniciando com 2, 2 KgDQO/mÂ. d, e finalizando com 10, 0 KgDQO/mÂ. d. O RBF escala de bancada (100 L) foi operado com COV de 5, 0 KgDQO/mÂ. d durante 116 dias, e em seguida com COV de 2, 5 KgDQO/mÂ. d durante 158 dias. A performance do UASB foi avaliada atravÃs de determinaÃÃes de DQO e taninos totais do afluente e efluente; atividade metanogÃnica especÃfica (AME) do lodo e toxicidade anaerÃbia; composiÃÃo e produÃÃo de biogÃs; pH, alcalinidade e Ãcidos graxos volÃteis (AGV). A performance do RBF foi monitorada atravÃs de determinaÃÃes de DQO, taninos totais e sÃrie de sÃlidos do afluente e efluente. AlÃm disso, foram realizados alguns ensaios: Biodegradabilidade aerÃbia do LCCV, estabilidade anaerÃbia do lodo, e o efeito da espÃcie Aspergillus niger AN 400 na degradaÃÃo do LCCV. Os resultados demonstraram que o UASB manteve-se estÃvel durante a operaÃÃo, com eficiÃncia de remoÃÃo de DQO superior a 80 % e de taninos em torno de 48 %. A razÃo AGV/alcalinidade ficou sempre inferior a 0, 30. O biogÃs apresentou composiÃÃo de 75 % de metano. Os ensaios de toxicidade demonstraram que o LCCV nÃo foi tÃxico Ã biomassa metanogÃnica presente no UASB. O RBF foi inicialmente inoculado com Aspergillus niger AN 400. No entanto, atravÃs de anÃlises microbiolÃgicas, foi comprovado que este fungo foi substituÃdo por leveduras naturalmente presentes no LCCV. Quando este reator foi operado com COV de 5, 0 KgDQO/mÂ. d, e sem descarte de biomassa, a eficiÃncia de remoÃÃo de DQO ficou em torno de 58 %. Esta eficiÃncia aumentou para 91 % quando a COV aplicada diminuiu para 2, 5 KgDQO/mÂ. d, e foram realizados descartes semanais da biomassa localizada na parte superior do reator. Neste perÃodo, a remoÃÃo mÃdia de taninos foi de 15 %. Apesar desta baixa remoÃÃo de taninos, reatores aerÃbios podem ser usados como alternativas para remoÃÃo de matÃria orgÃnica facilmente degradÃvel, viabilizando a recuperaÃÃo dos taninos para uso comercial. Os resultados obtidos em testes em placas de Petri demonstraram que a espÃcie fÃngica Aspergillus Niger AN 400 foi capaz de se desenvolver em meio contendo LCCV. Contudo, resultados dos testes em batelada demonstraram que esta espÃcie nÃo alterou as taxas de remoÃÃo de DQO e taninos, quando foi inoculado em meio contendo LCCV bruto. A configuraÃÃo do reator com fungos utilizada nesta pesquisa apresentou problemas operacionais relacionados com o descarte do excesso de biomassa. With {{the aim of}} aggregating value to the productive chain of coconut and to expand its agrobusiness, Embrapa AgroindÃstria Tropical (Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation, Tropical Agroindustry National Centre) developed a system for processing the husk of immature coconut {{in order to produce}} fibre and coir dust, which have several environmental and commercial applications. During the pressing stage, a liquid is generated, denominated Coconut Husk Liquor (CHL), which contains high concentration of organic matter (varying form 60 to 80 gDQO/L), including tannins. In this work, the performance of an Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket Reactor (UASB) and a Fungi Biological Reactor (FBR) were evaluated for the treatment of CHL. The lab-scale UASB reactor, with a working volume of 16, 8 L, was operated during 222 days with an increasing organic loading rate (OLR), starting from 2. 2 kgCOD/m 3. d and reaching up to 10 kgCOD/m 3. d. The lab-scale FBR, with a working volume of 100 L, was operated with OLR of 5, 0 kgCOD/m 3. d, during 116 days, and then with OLR of 2, 5 kgCOD/m 3. d during 158 days. The performance of UASB reactor evaluated based on influent and effluent COD and total tannins; sludge specific methanogenic activity (SMA) and anaerobic toxicity; gas production and composition; pH, alkalinity and volatile fatty acids; and sludge retention time. The performance of FBR was monitored on the basis of on influent and effluent COD, total tannins and suspended solids. Other analysis were also accomplished: <b>aerobic</b> CHL <b>biodegradability,</b> sludge stability, and effect of Aspergillus niger on the degradation of CHL. Results showed that UASB reactor was maintained stable during the whole operation, with COD removal efficiency higher than 80 %, total tannins removal efficiency of around 48 %, and the ratio AGV/alkalinity lower than 0, 30. Biogas presented 75 % of methane on its composition. Toxicity tests demonstrated that CHL was not toxic to the methanogenic consortia. FBR was initially inoculated with Aspergillus niger AN- 400. However, this fungus was substituted by the yeast that is natural on coconut husk, which was confirmed by tests carried out on Petri plate tests. When this reactor was operated with OLR of 5. 0 kgCOD/m 3. d and without sludge removal, the COD removal efficiency was around 58 %. The performance improved up to 91 % when OLR was decreased to 2. 5 kgCOD/m 3. d and sludge was weekly removed from the top or reactor. During this period, total tannin removal efficiency was approximately 15 %. Despite the low tannin removal efficiency, this aerobic reactors can be used as an alternative for easy-degradable organic matter, facilitating the recovering of tannins for commercial uses. Results obtained from Petri plate tests show that Aspergillus niger AN- 400 was able to grow in a medium with CHL. However, results from batch tests demonstrated that this species did not affect the DQO and tannins removal rates, when it is inoculated in a solution with raw CHL.

30|$|Surfactants are {{chemicals}} {{with a high}} {{production volume}} and a wide dispersive use, i.e. surfactants have a high environmental impact. The question of the persistence of a particular substance {{is one of the}} most important aspects for the assessment of the risks associated with chemical substances (EU Technical Guidance Document, 2003). Therefore, strict legal requirements for the <b>aerobic</b> <b>biodegradability</b> of surfactants have been established on national and international level, e.g. the EU Detergent Regulation (EC/ 648 / 2004). The most common fate for surfactants is that they are discharged via waste water. Surfactant containing domestic and industrial waste water is collected and purified in professionally operated waste water treatment plants. Taking into account the strict legal requirements assuring the use of biodegradable surfactants, the vast majority of surfactant molecules entering a waste water treatment plant (WWTP) are readily broken down to CO 2 and H 2 O. Only a very small fraction of the surfactants is not aerobically broken down during the usual hydraulic retention times of modern WWTPs. This fraction, due to the predominantly hydrophobic nature of surfactants, adheres to the sludge. The sludge is usually collected and further treated under anaerobic conditions in digester tanks. Therefore, the knowledge about anaerobic biodegradability under digester tank conditions is important to gain an understanding about the environmental fate of surfactants. Unfortunately, no standard method is available to test surfactants under these conditions.|$|E

The overall biodegradability, {{in terms of}} Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) was higher for TCF effluents (96 - 98 %) than for CB ones (82 - 93 %). Taking into account the higher organic load of CB effluents, this fact implied a much higher residual COD for them (100 - 180 mg/L) than for TCF effluents (10 - 30 mg/L). Furthermore, a refractory fraction of molecular weight higher than 43, 000 Da was found in CB effluent, which implied {{the necessity of a}} further specific treatment.

The evolved CO 2 was trapped by an additional aqueous Ba(OH) 2 solution. The trapped BaCO 3 was transformed into graphite via a serial vaporization and reduction reaction using a gas-tight tube and vacuum manifold system. This graphite was analyzed by accelerated mass spectrometry (AMS) to determine the percent modern carbon [pMC (sample) ] based on the 14 C radiocarbon concentration. By using the theory that pMC (sample) was {{the sum of the}} pMC (compost) (109. 87 %) and pMC (PBS) (0 %) as the respective ratio in the determined period, the CO 2 (respiration) was calculated from only one reaction vessel. It was found that the biodegradabilities determined by the CO 2 amount from PBS in the sample vessel were about 30 % lower than those based on the ISO method. These differences between the ISO and AMS methods are caused by the fact that part of the carbons from PBS are changed into metabolites by the microorganisms in the compost, and not changed into CO 2...|$|E
40|$|Robust and {{effective}} bioremediation strategies {{have not yet}} been developed for polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) -contaminated soils. This is in part a result of the fact that ortho- or ortho- and para-substituted congeners, frequent dead-end products of reductive dechlorination of PCB mixtures, have greatly reduced <b>aerobic</b> <b>biodegradability.</b> In this study, we report sub-stantial evidence of utilization of diortho-substituted trichlorobiphenyls (triCBs) as growth substrates by Ralstonia sp. SA- 4 and Pseudomonas sp. SA- 6 in which ortho-substitution resulted in no obvious pat-terns of recalcitrance. These stains exhibited unusual preferences for growth on congeners chlorinated on both rings. Substrate uptake studies with benzoate-grown cells revealed that the isolates attacked the 2 -chlorophenyl rings of 2, 2, 4 - and 2, 2, 5 -triCB. Between 71 % and 93 % of the initial 0. 23 – 0. 34 mM dose of congeners were transformed in less than 261 h concomitant with non-stoichiometric produc-tion of respective dichlorobenzoates and chloride ion. In enzyme assays, activity of 2, 3 -dihydroxybiphenyl- 1, 2 -dioxygenase was constitutive. Additionally, these strains harboured no detectable plasmids which, coupled with exponential growth on the two triCB congeners, suggested chromosomal location of PCB degradative genes. In addition {{to the fact that there}} is a paucity of information on degradation of PCBs by tropical isolates, growth on triCBs as a sole carbon and energy source has never been demonstrated for any natural or engineered microorganisms.

The present study describes the <b>aerobic</b> <b>biodegradability</b> of HMX using Phanerochaete chrysosporium. When added to 7 day old static P. chrysosporium liquid cultures, HMX (600 nmol) degraded within 25 days of incubation. The removal of HMX was concomitant {{with the formation of}} transient amounts of its mono-nitroso derivative (1 -NO-HMX). The latter apparently degraded via two potential routes: the first involved N-denitration followed by hydrolytic ring cleavage, and the second involved alpha-hydroxylation prior to ring cleavage. The degradation of 1 -NO-HMX gave the ring-cleavage product 4 -nitro- 2, 4 -diazabutanal (NDAB), nitrite (NO 2 -), nitrous oxide (N 2 O), and formaldehyde (HCHO). Using (14 C) -HMX, we obtained 14 CO 2 (70 % in 50 days), representing three C atoms of HMX. Incubation of real soils, contaminated with either HMX (403 mumol kg- 1) (military base soil) or HMX (3057 mumol kg- 1), and RDX (342 mumol kg- 1) (ammunition soil) with the fungus led to 75 and 19. 8 % mineralization of HMX (liberated 14 CO 2), respectively, also via the intermediary formation of 1 -NO-HMX. Mineralization in the latter soil increased to 35 % after the addition of glucose, indicating that a fungus-based remediation process for heavily contaminated soils is promising. The present findings improve our understanding about the degradation pathway of HMX and demonstrate the utility of using the robust and versatile fungus P. chrysosporium to develop effective remediation processes for the removal of HMX.

40|$|<b>Aerobic</b> <b>biodegradability</b> {{and aquatic}} {{toxicity}} of five types of quaternary ammonium-based gemini surfactants have been examined. The {{effect of the}} spacer structure and the head group polarity on the ecological properties {{of a series of}} dimeric dodecyl ammonium surfactants has been investigated. Standard tests for ready biodegradability assessment (OECD 310) were conducted for C 12 alkyl chain gemini surfactants containing oxygen, nitrogen or a benzene ring in the spacer linkage and/or a hydroxyethyl group attached to the nitrogen atom of the head groups. According to the results obtained, the gemini surfactants examined cannot be considered as readily biodegradable compounds. The negligible biotransformation of the gemini surfactants under the standard biodegradation test conditions was found to be due to their toxic effects on the microbial population responsible for aerobic biodegradation. Aquatic toxicity of gemini surfactants was evaluated against Daphnia magna. The acute toxicity values to Daphnia magna, IC 50 at 48 h exposure, ranged from 0. 6 to 1 mg/L. On the basis of these values, the gemini surfactants tested should be classified as toxic or very toxic to the aquatic environment. However, the dimeric quaternary ammonium-based surfactants examined result to be less toxic than their corresponding monomeric analogs. Nevertheless the aquatic toxicity of these gemini surfactants can be reduced by increasing the molecule hydrophilicity by adding a heteroatom to the spacer or a hydroxyethyl group to the polar head groups.

Biodegradation was monitored by measuring microbial carbon dioxide formation and oxygen consumption. Completeness of biodegradation was assessed in an aquatic test by conducting a carbon mass balance. The percentage of plastic carbon degraded to carbon dioxide, biomass and water-soluble byproducts were determined. The rate of biodegradation under simulated composting conditions was measured in a fixed-bed system with mature compost. A time-dependent temperature profile was applied to simulate the natural self-heating of a composting process. The aquatic test was conducted at a constant temperature of 30 centigrades {{as well as with}} a temperature profile. The rate of biodegradation was significantly higher in the aqueous environment. Equal degrees of mineralization were reached in the aquatic and the fixed-bed system only if the same temperature profile was applied. Conducting the aquating test at a constant temperature of 30 centigrades less microbial carbon dioxide formation was observed. However, a carbon mass balance revealed that taking into consideration the portion of the plastic's carbon incorporated into biomass a similar degree of biodegradation was reached. Consequently, the measurement of microbial carbon dioxide production is not sufficient to assess the extent of biodegradation of plastics. In the heterogeneous matrix 'compost', it is not feasable to assess the completeness of biodegradation due to limited possibilities to analyze degradation intermediates and biomass growth. Therefore, a new fixed-bed system with an inert, carbon-free packing material was developed. The inert material was inoculated with an aqueous eluate from compost.

Several operating conditions, such as power density (25 - 100 W/L), substrate concentration (2. 5 - 80 mg/L), initial solution pH (3. 5 - 11), liquid bulk temperature {{and the type}} of sparging gas (air, oxygen, argon), were tested concerning their effect on DCF degradation (as assessed measuring absorbance at 276 nm) and hydroxyl radicals generation (as assessed measuring H 2 O 2 concentration). Sample mineralization (in terms of TOC and COD removal), <b>aerobic</b> <b>biodegradability</b> (as assessed by the BOD 5 /COD ratio) and ecotoxicity to Daphnia magna and Artemia salina were followed too. DCF conversion is enhanced at increased applied power densities and liquid bulk temperatures, acidic conditions and in the presence of dissolved air or oxygen. The reaction rate increases with increasing DCF concentration in the range 2. 5 - 5 mg/L but it remains constant in the range 40 - 80 mg/L, indicating different kinetic regimes (i. e. first and zero order, respectively). H 2 O 2 production rates in pure water are higher than those in DCF solutions, implying that decomposition basically proceeds through hydroxyl radical reactions. Mineralization is a slow process as reaction by-products are more stable than DCF to total oxidation; nonetheless, they are also more readily biodegradable.

40|$|Quantifying {{in-house}} {{emissions of}} methane (CH 4) from liquid manure (slurry) is difficult {{due to high}} background emissions from enteric processes, yet of great importance for correct estimation of CH 4 emissions from manure management and effects of treatment technologies such as anaerobic digestion. In this study CH 4 production rates were determined in 20 pig slurry and 11 cattle slurry samples collected beneath slatted floors on six representative farms; rates were determined within 24 h at temperatures close to the temperature in slurry pits {{at the time of}} collection. Methane production rates in pig and cattle slurry differed significantly at 0. 030 and 0. 011 kg CH 4 kg- 1 VS (volatile solids). Current estimates of CH 4 emissions from pig and cattle manure management correspond to 0. 032 and 0. 015 kg CH 4 kg- 1, respectively, indicating that slurry pits under animal confinements are a significant source. Fractions of degradable volatile solids (VSd, kg kg- 1 VS) were estimated using an <b>aerobic</b> <b>biodegradability</b> assay and total organic C analyses. The VSd in pig and cattle slurry averaged 0. 51 and 0. 33 kg kg- 1 VS, and it was estimated that on average 43 and 28 % of VSd in fresh excreta from pigs and cattle, respectively, had been lost at the time of sampling. An empirical model of CH 4 emissions from slurry was reparameterised based on experimental results. A sensitivity analysis indicated that predicted CH 4 emissions were highly sensitive to uncertainties in the value of lnA of the Arrhenius equation, but much less sensitive to uncertainties in VSd or slurry temperature. A model application indicated that losses of carbon in VS as CO 2 may be much greater than losses as CH 4. Implications of these results for the correct estimation of CH 4 emissions from manure management, and for the mitigation potential of treatments such as anaerobic digestion, are discussed...|$|E

Five experimental runs at influent substrate concentrations {{in the range of}} 660 – 13100 mg COD l? 1 were carried out at a ratio of substrate-to-microorganisms concentration S 0 /X 0 equal to unity. Chemical oxygen demand (COD), soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD), volatile suspended solids of the mixed liquor (MLVSS), pH, dissolved oxygen, saturation percentage (% sat.) and temperature were determined during the experiments. An increase in the influent substrate concentration caused a decrease in COD and SCOD removals at similar times of aeration ?. The non-biodegradable fractions of COD and SCOD were determined to be 43. 1 % and 53. 1 % of their initial values, respectively. It was found that a first-order kinetics adequately described the variation of biodegradable SCOD with ?. The values of the first-order reaction constants were found to be 0. 074, 0. 044, 0. 040, 0. 033, and 0. 013 h? 1 (1. 776, 1. 056, 0. 960, 0. 792, and 0. 312 d? 1) for Runs 1 – 5, respectively, with variance coefficients lower than 10 % in all cases. During the experiments the growth of microorganisms appeared to be in the exponential phase. Hence, first-order reactions were assumed to describe the increase in MLVSS concentration with ?. The values of the specific growth rate ? were determined to be: 0. 0064, 0. 0075, 0. 0084, 0. 0091, and 0. 0038 h? 1 (0. 154, 0. 180, 0. 202, 0. 218, and 0. 091 d? 1) for initial substrate concentrations of 660 (Run 1), 1400 (Run 2), 2600 (Run 3), 6600 (Run 4), and 13100 (Run 5) mg COD l? 1, respectively.

Several operating conditions, such as power density (25 – 100 W L− 1), initial substrate concentrations (2. 5 – 10 mg L− 1), initial solution pH (3 – 11), and air sparging were varied for the evaluation and understanding of the process. The degradation (as assessed by measuring UV absorbance), the generation of hydroxyl radicals (as assessed measuring H 2 O 2 concentration), the mineralization (in terms of TOC and COD removal), and the <b>aerobic</b> <b>biodegradability</b> (as assessed by the BOD 5 /COD ratio) were monitored during sonication. Ecotoxicity to Daphnia magna, Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and Lepidium sativum before and after treatment was also evaluated. It was found that the pharmaceuticals conversion is enhanced at increased applied power densities, acidic conditions and in the presence of dissolved air. The reaction rate increases with increasing initial concentration of single pharmaceuticals but it remains constant in the mixtures, indicating different kinetic regimes (i. e. first and zero order respectively). Mineralization is a slow process as reaction by-products are more stable than pharmaceuticals to total oxidation; nonetheless, they are also more readily biodegradable. The toxicity of the wastewater samples before and after contamination with pharmaceuticals both in mixtures and in single substance-containing solutions was observed more severely on P. subcapitata; a fact that raises concerns in regards to the discharge of such effluents. D. magna displayed less sensitivity compared to P. subcapitata because it belongs in a lower taxonomic species than D. magna. The germination index of L. sativum in the presence of the drugs' mixture was stimulated instead of inducing any toxicity effect and this might be attributed to the fact the sample, laden with very low drug concentrations was able to act as a provider of additional nutrient elements...|$|E
40|$|Addressing {{the issues}} of water {{shortage}} and appropriate sanitation in Jordan, domestic grey water treatment receives growing interest. Grey water comprises the domestic wastewater flows excluding waters associated with the toilet. The topics of concern for grey water are its characteristics, treatment and potentials for use after treatment. The target of this thesis {{is to develop a}} concept for treating grey water on-site for agricultural usage, thus sustaining a recycling process of grey water in Jordan. A review was made regarding the currently available grey water treatment technologies. In addition, grey water was quantitatively and qualitatively characterized, and then grey water reuse requirements including treatment, were analyzed. Biodegradability and biodegradation rates of the grey water were investigated for selecting appropriate design and operation criteria of the treatment technology to be developed. A low-tech semi-technical scale treatment system was tested to treat grey water discharges from a dormitory at the Jordan University campus. The treatment system was evaluated on obtained removal efficiencies and conformity of the effluent to the guidelines for the use of reclaimed water for irrigation in Jordan. Finally, the objectives, approaches and the results of each chapter are summarized, and then both the results and the potential of applying decentralised sanitation and reuse (DeSaR) concepts in Jordan are discussed. Results show that storage and treatment are prerequisites for any type of grey water use. Grey water is aerobically and anaerobically biodegradable but the conversion rates are low. The core of the treatment concept consists of an integrated storage and anaerobic treatment unit, fed with a natural influent flow pattern, in a down-flow mode, up to a one day operational cycle, i. e. a variable HRT ≤ 24 hours. The second step consists of an aerobic post-treatment, mechanically aerated in a down-flow mode and a one day operational cycle, i. e. 24 hours HRT. Both units need insulation in the winter period. The final effluent, stable in winter and summer, meets the Jordanian standard, except for the pathogens, for usage in restricted irrigation. The achievable treatment efficiency for the CODtot is 44 % in the anaerobic unit and 70 % in the combined anaerobic-aerobic, unlike the high anaerobic and <b>aerobic</b> <b>biodegradability</b> in batch experiments, viz. 70 and 86 %, respectively. The highest removal efficiency achieved was for the CODss fraction, viz. 71 % in the anaerobic and 85 % in the combined system. Therefore, it is expected that the CODtot removal efficiency of the system can be improved, by enhancing the CODcol and CODdis, removal, i. e. applying filtration and/or adding chemicals such as adsorbents, coagulants and/or flocculants to the treatment units...|$|E
40|$|In {{a context}} of {{environmental}} biorefinery, organic residues such as sludge, biowaste, manure are no more considered as wastes but as potential resources for some targeted services. These services encompass the energy production through the methane produced by their anaerobic digestion, the cropped soils fertilisers and amendments production from digestates, and other value-added compounds production (e. g. organic acids and hydrogen obtained during fermentation). There are currently only few studies focused on combined optimization of energetic and agronomic values of organic wastes. One way to optimize both objectives is through process modelling. However, input variables from all existing models are different {{and there is a}} need to find relevant and shared input variables to model the fate of organic residues during their treatments. Recently, a new promising methodology of organic matter characterization has been successfully used to predict anaerobic and <b>aerobic</b> <b>biodegradability</b> and bioaccessibility of a broad range of organic residues (Jimenez et al., 2015). This methodology is based on the combination of chemical fractionation simulating organic matter accessibility and of a 3 D fluorescence spectroscopy highlighting fraction’s complexity. The fractions obtained were used as models input variables. Existing models (Batstone et al., 2002, Zhang et al., 2012, Garnier et al., 2003) have been modified to take into account these new variables. In order to calibrate and validate the models, a lab scale reactor of anaerobic digestion was operated to treat wastewater sludge. Biogas, methane proportion, pH and input and output digestate quality were monitored. After 60 days of steady state operation, the digestate was then centrifuged to separate the liquid from the solid part. The solid part was then added with green waste into a lab scale compost reactor. Temperature, CO 2 production, moisture and compost quality were monitored. Finally, the final compost was used as substrate for cropped soil incubation. First results showed that, the new anaerobic digestion model was successfully able to predict biogas and digestate quality when model and experimental data were compared. The final quality of the solid part of the simulated digestate was then introduced with the green waste fractionation to model composting. The modified compost model also fitted the quality of compost during the different steps of the composting. Concerning soil incubation modelling, experimental results are still ongoing but will be part of the oral presentation. Overall, the obtained results constitute a strong basis for the development of a decision support system to optimize the design and operation of organic wastes treatment plants...|$|E
40|$|Thermal {{pretreatment}} {{systems are}} typically employed to improve waste-activated sludge (WAS) dewaterability and to treat sludge prior to anaerobic digestion. It {{is important to}} understand how WAS properties are affected during pretreatment to be able to assess the performances of processes utilizing pretreated WAS (PWAS). However, there are no generally accepted means of characterizing and comparing pretreatment processes. A pretreatment model for high temperature thermal hydrolysis was developed previously for one pretreatment condition. The motivation for this project stemmed from the need to extend the range of thermal pretreatment conditions to span the range of conditions commonly employed in practice and to evaluate the impact of these pretreatment conditions on WAS chemical oxygen demand (COD) fractionation. The two main objectives of this study were to fractionate the COD of WAS before and after pretreatment for several high temperature thermal pretreatment conditions and to compare the impact of pretreatment on aerobic and anaerobic biodegradability. The secondary objectives were to investigate how pretreatment affected the rate and extent of aerobic and anaerobic digestion of WAS. The data employed in this study was collected by others following the work of Staples-Burger (2012) and was generated by pretreatment of sludges at 125 °C, 150 °C, and 175 °C for 10, 30 and 50 minutes. Physical and biochemical properties were measured for raw WAS (BR WAS) and PWAS. Offline and online respirometric data were used to evaluate the <b>aerobic</b> <b>biodegradability</b> of BR WAS and PWAS and to fractionate the COD of the BR WAS and PWAS. Biochemical methane potential (BMP) tests were conducted for BR WAS and PWAS to evaluate the anaerobic biodegradability of BR WAS and PWAS. BioWin® was used to aid in determining the WAS COD fractionation before and after pretreatment, and to determine whether pretreatment changed the aerobic and anaerobic biodegradability of the WAS. It was found that the high pressure thermal hydrolysis (HPTH) pretreatment conditions employed substantially solubilized the COD, organic nitrogen and volatile suspended solids (VSS) in the range of 30 – 55 %, 23 – 41 % and 30 – 89 % respectively. Total COD (TCOD) was however not reduced by pretreatment indicating that organics were not mineralized. These findings closely agreed with the conclusions made in the literature. Pretreatment did not increase the overall extent to which WAS could be aerobically biodegraded. The fraction of non-biodegradable COD as represented by endogenous decay products (Ze) in the BR WAS were not converted to biodegradable form by pretreatment. However, pretreatment increased the rate at which WAS could be aerobically biodegraded as indicated by an increase in the fractions of readily biodegradable COD (Sbsc) in the PWAS. Pretreatment increased both the rate and extent of anaerobic biodegradability. The ultimate methane yield and the methane production rate were both increased when compared to the ultimate methane yield and methane production rate observed in BMP tests conducted on BR WAS. The experimental results were combined with BioWin® modeling to determine that the BR WAS consisted of 79 % Zbh and 18 % endogenous decay products (Ze). The endogenous decay products fraction remained at 18 % through pretreatment and the concentration of active biomass (Zbh) in PWAS was deemed to be negligible. HPTH pretreatment at the employed temperatures and durations transformed the biodegradable fraction of BR WAS (Zbh) to 16. 5 – 34. 6 % Sbsc and 45. 8 – 63. 6 % slowly biodegradable COD (Xsp) of the TCOD concentration. The same PWAS COD fractionations were employed in anaerobic biodegradability test modeling and it was concluded that the aerobic and anaerobic biodegradability of PWAS was different. Up to 50 % of the endogenous decay products were converted to biodegradable substrate (Xsp) due to HPTH pretreatment. It was determined that both pretreatment temperature and duration were important in solubilizing organic matter in the WAS. Increasing the pretreatment temperature and duration generally increased the organics solubilization. However, the impact of pretreatment temperature and duration on WAS COD fractions were inconclusive. The increase in organics solubilization did not correspond to how much of the biodegradable COD of BR WAS was converted to Sbsc by pretreatment...|$|E
