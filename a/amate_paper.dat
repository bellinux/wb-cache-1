25|$|Despite {{the success}} of <b>amate</b> <b>paper</b> for San Pablito, {{many of the men}} here migrate to find work at least temporarily, a trend that began in the 1980s. Most head to North Carolina in the United States.|$|E
25|$|While the {{production}} of 40 by 60cm paper remains economically important, the amate production of the San Pablito has since diversified. New products include envelopes, bookmarks, cutout figures, and booklets, as well as sheets {{in a variety of}} colors, textures and sizes up to 1.20 by 2.40 meters. There are also varieties decorated with dried flowers and leaves. In addition to traditional Nahua customers, <b>amate</b> <b>paper</b> is now sold to industries who use it to produce other end products such as lampshades, furniture covers, wallpaper and parquet flooring. The success of <b>amate</b> <b>paper</b> commercialization has caused the population here to forego most other economic activities such as agriculture and even other handcrafts such as pottery and weaving.|$|E
25|$|By the mid-20th century, the {{knowledge}} of making <b>amate</b> <b>paper</b> was kept alive only in a few small towns in the rugged mountains of Puebla and Veracruz states, such as San Pablito, an Otomi village and Chicontepec, a Nahua village. It was particularly strong in San Pablito in Puebla {{as many of the}} villages around it believed this paper has special power when used in rituals. The making of paper here until the 1960s was strictly the purview of the shamans, who kept the process secret, making paper primarily to be used for cutting gods and other figures for ritual. However, these shamans came into contact with anthropologists, learning of the interest that people on the outside had for their paper and their culture. But although the ritual cutting of paper remained important for the Otomi people of northern Puebla, the use of <b>amate</b> <b>paper</b> was declining, with industrial paper or tissue paper replacing <b>amate</b> <b>paper</b> in rituals. One stimulus for amate's commercialization was the shamans' growing realization of the commercial value of the paper; they began to sell cutouts of bark paper figures on a small scale in Mexico City along with other Otomi handcrafts.|$|E
50|$|Every weekend {{the museum}} has {{workshops}} for children between six and twelve in various crafts {{with the aim of}} preserving these crafts. Workshops include those on <b>paper</b> cutting, <b>amate</b> (bark) <b>paper</b> and papier-mâché. For special occasions such as Dia de Muertos, workshops have included those on making Catrina figures, sugar skulls and traditional candies.|$|R
50|$|Handcraft {{traditions of}} the state are a mixture of {{indigenous}} and European. These traditions {{can be viewed as}} two main types: those that retain most of their indigenous quality, and those heavily European in design or technique. Indigenous-style products include certain pottery traditions, textiles, and the making of <b>amate</b> (bark) <b>paper.</b> European styles include Talavera pottery and glass.|$|R
50|$|The {{town was}} founded by the Augustinians when they built a small monastery here in 1532, with the area divided among ethnic Nahuas and Otomis, both of which can still be found here today. Culturally, the {{municipality}} {{is best known for}} the <b>amate</b> bark <b>paper</b> which is produced by the Otomis of the San Pablito community.|$|R
25|$|Despite the {{commercial}} {{success of the}} town’s crafts, many men, mostly of the younger generations, migrate out of the area, generally to North Carolina in the United States at least temporarily to work. This has left the town mostly populated by women and children, who produce the <b>amate</b> <b>paper</b> and other crafts.|$|E
25|$|The oldest known <b>amate</b> <b>paper</b> {{dates back}} to 75 CE. It was {{discovered}} {{at the site of}} Huitzilapa, Jalisco. Huitzilapa is a shaft tomb culture site located northwest of Tequila Volcano near the town of Magdalena. The crumpled piece of paper was found in the southern chamber of the site's shaft tomb, possibly associated with a male scribe. Rather than being produced from Trema micrantha, from which modern amate is made, the amate found at Huitzilapa is made from Ficus tecolutensis. Iconography (in stone) dating from the period contains depictions of items thought to be paper. For example, Monument 52 from the Olmec site of San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán illustrates an individual adorned with ear pennants of folded paper. The oldest known surviving book made from <b>amate</b> <b>paper</b> may be the Grolier Codex, which Michael D. Coe and other researchers have asserted is authentic and dated to the 12th-13th century CE.|$|E
25|$|The {{state does}} not have a {{tradition}} of painting and other visual arts aside from <b>amate</b> <b>paper</b> work but, recently, there has been a movement to promote more classical oils and other works, with recent generations of painters from the state and galleries opening to promote their work. Some of these artists include Casiano García, Ian Malaj, Leonel Maciel, Miguel Ángel Sotelo, Gerzaín Vargas and Hugo Zúñiga.|$|E
5000|$|One of the state’s {{better known}} crafts is the {{painting}} of images onto <b>amate</b> (bark) <b>paper,</b> done in Nahua communities such as Ameyaltepec, Maxela, Xalitla and San Agustin de las Flores. [...] One reason for its prominence {{is that it is}} very popular with tourists. It is popular with artisans as well, as the paintings yield a higher income than pottery.|$|R
25|$|After cooking, the {{alkaline}} liquid (known as nejayote), containing dissolved hull, starch, {{and other}} corn matter, is decanted and discarded (or sometimes used for making <b>amate</b> bark <b>paper).</b> The kernels are washed thoroughly of remaining nejayote, {{which has an}} unpleasant flavor. The pericarp is then removed, leaving the endosperm of the grain {{with or without the}} germ, depending on the process. This hulling is performed by hand, in traditional or very small-scale preparation, or mechanically, in larger scale or industrial production.|$|R
50|$|The {{municipality}} is Mexico’s main {{producer of}} <b>amate</b> bark <b>paper,</b> with its production {{concentrated in the}} community of San Pablito. Other handcrafts include hats, necklaces, embroidered clothing, baskets, semi precious stones and the weaving of wool. The Museo de Arte Popular has sponsored a different craft for the area, the creation of beaded bands. The production and sale of these bands is not only to help support the artisan community of Pahuatlan but also to earn money for other museum projects.|$|R
25|$|While {{there have}} been some minor innovations, <b>amate</b> <b>paper</b> is still made using the same basic process that was used in the pre Hispanic period. The process begins with obtaining the bark for its fiber. Traditionally, these are from trees of the fig (Ficus) family as this bark is the easiest to process. Some large Ficus trees are {{considered}} sacred and can be found surrounded with candles and offering of cut <b>amate</b> <b>paper.</b> Primary species used include F. cotinifolia, F. padifolia and F. petiolaris, the classic amate tree, along with several non-ficus species such as Morus celtidifolia, Citrus anurantifolia and Heliocarpos Donnell-Smithii Rose. However, the taxonomical identification of trees used for <b>amate</b> <b>paper</b> production is not exact, leading estimates of wild supplies inaccurate. The softer inner bark is preferred but other parts are used as well. Outer bark and bark from ficus trees tend to make darker paper and inner bark and mulberry bark tends to make lighter paper. Bark is best cut in the spring when it is new, which does less damage. It also is less damaging to take bark from older ficus trees as this bark tends to peel off more easily. The commercialization of the product has meant that a wider range of area needs to be searched for appropriate trees. This has specialized the harvesting of bark to mostly people from outside San Pablito, with only a few paper makers harvesting their own bark. These bark collectors generally come to the village {{at the end of the}} week, but numbers of harvesters and amount of bark can vary greatly, depending on the time of year and other factors. The paper makers generally buy the bark fresh then dry it for storage. After drying, the bark can be conserved for about a year.|$|E
25|$|<b>Amate</b> <b>paper</b> {{has a long}} history. This {{history is}} {{not only because the}} raw {{materials}} for its manufacture have persisted but also that the manufacture, distribution and uses have adapted to the needs and restrictions of various epochs. This history can be roughly divided into three periods: the pre-Hispanic period, the Spanish colonial period to the 20th century, and from the latter 20th century to the present, marked by the paper's use as a commodity.|$|E
25|$|Art was {{expressed}} {{on a variety}} of mediums such as ceramics, <b>amate</b> <b>paper</b> and architecture. Most of what is known of Mesoamerican art comes from works that cover stone buildings and pottery, mostly paintings and reliefs. Ceramics date from the early the Mesoamerican period. They probably began as cooking and storage vessels but then were adapted to ritual and decorative uses. Ceramics were decorated by shaping, scratching, painting and different firing methods.|$|E
50|$|Puebla {{handcrafts}} {{and folk}} art is handcraft and folk {{art from the}} Mexican state of Puebla. The best-known craft of Puebla is Talavera pottery—which is the only mayolica style pottery continuously produced in Mexico since it {{was introduced in the}} early colonial period. Other notable handcraft traditions include trees of life from Izúcar de Matamoros and <b>amate</b> (bark) <b>paper</b> made by the very small town of San Pablito in the north of the state. The state also makes glass, Christmas tree ornaments, indigenous textiles, monumental clocks, baskets, and apple cider.|$|R
2500|$|One craft {{which is}} {{specific}} to the state is painting using traditional <b>amate</b> or bark <b>paper</b> as a canvas. This craft began in the 1970s in Xalitla, located between Iguala and Chilpancingo. Since that time, these paintings or drawings have become known {{both inside and outside}} of Mexico. [...] The best known works today come from the communities of Maxela, San Juan, Ahuelicán and Ahuehuepan. Most of the themes of these paintings are related to agriculture, everyday life and religion.|$|R
50|$|Wood crafts include small {{objects such}} as toys (tops, yoyos, puppets, etc.) along with furniture, mostly reproductions of colonial era pieces. Other objects include guitars, masks and replicas of the Tizoc Stone, often covered in lacquer or crystal pieces. Papel picado (lit. poked paper) is the cutting of thin paper {{generally}} with a chisel or similar instrument to create repeating banner-like decorative items for festivals and parties. Originally, these were made with <b>amate</b> or maguey <b>paper</b> due to its pre Hispanic origin, but eventually crepe paper began to be used, and sometimes this is replaced by thin sheets of plastic.|$|R
25|$|However, {{about fifty}} percent of all Otomi paper {{production}} is still done in standard 40cm by 60cm size and sold to Nahua painters from Guerrero, the market segment which made the mass commercialization of the product possible. Seventy {{percent of all the}} craft production of these Otomi and Nahuas is sold on the national market with about thirty percent reaching the international market. As most <b>amate</b> <b>paper</b> is sold as the backing for these paintings, so many consumers assume the Nahua produce the paper as well.|$|E
25|$|Since then, {{while the}} Nahua {{are still the}} {{principle}} buyers of Otomi <b>amate</b> <b>paper,</b> the Otomi have since branched out into different types of paper and have developed {{some of their own}} products to sell. Today, <b>amate</b> <b>paper</b> {{is one of the most}} widely distributed Mexican handcrafts nationally and internationally. It has received artistic and academic attention at both levels as well. In 2006, an annual event called the Encuentro de Arte in Papel Amate was begun in the village, which includes events such as processions, Dance of the Voladors, Huapango music and more. The main event is the exhibition of works by various artists such as Francisco Toledo, Sergio Hernández, Gabriel Macotela, Gustavo MOnrroy, Cecilio Sánchez, Nicolás de Jesús, David Correa, Héctor Montiel, José Montiel, Laura Montiel, Santiago Regalado Juan Manuel de la Rosa, Ester González, Alejandra Palma Padilla, Nicéforo Hurbieta Moreles, Jorge Lozano and Alfonso García Tellez. The Museo de Arte Popular and the Egyptian embassy in Mexico held an exhibition in 2008 on amate and papyrus with over sixty objects on display comparing the two ancient traditions. One of the most noted artists in the medium is shaman Alfonso Margarito García Téllez, who has exhibited his work in museums such as the San Pedro Museo de Arte in Puebla.|$|E
25|$|Later migrations to {{the area}} brought ethnicities such as the Purépecha, the Mixtecs, the Maya and the Zapotecs who left traces on the local {{cultures}} as they established commercial centers around the 7th century. In the 8th century, Toltec influence was felt as they traveled the many trade routes through here in search of tropical bird plumage and <b>amate</b> <b>paper.</b> From the 12th century to the 15th, the various peoples of the state were influence by the Chichimecas, culminating in Aztec domination by the 15th century.|$|E
50|$|The oldest known fabric {{fragments}} in Mexico {{have been}} found in the arid north of the country in states such as Coahuila, Chihuahua and Durango and date to approximately between 1800 and 1400 BCE. In pre-Hispanic times, the most common woven fibers in dry areas were from the yucca and palm trees, with cotton grown in the hot humid areas near the coast. It was unknown to the Aztecs until they conquered cotton growing areas and began demanding it as tribute. Then, only the upper classes were permitted to wear it. Given the important status cotton cloth had, it is often used as money. For some ceremonial garments, <b>amate</b> or bark <b>paper</b> was used. Each of the sedentary Mesoamerican cultures had a god of weaving. Women were often buried with woven items they had made. Cortés mentions the Aztecs’ skill in weaving in one of this letters to the king of Spain, in very favorable terms.|$|R
50|$|In the 1970s, the Otomi of San Pablito, Pahuatlán began {{producing}} <b>amate</b> or bark <b>paper</b> commercially, a first {{almost exclusively}} for Nahua painters {{in the state}} of Guerrero. The paper has grown in popularity for various uses and is sold both nationally and internationally. As of 2009, there were at least 200 craftsmen in the trade in the town with a yearly production value of about 500,000 pesos. The production has caused environmental damage as trees are stripped for bark and chemicals from the process such as caustic soda make their way into the San Pedro River. There have been efforts to plant and grow new types of trees that provide back in 5 or 6 years as well as the introduction of nonpolluting chemicals.Xochitlán and Zacatlán produce hard apple cider and various fruit wines with a sugar cane liquor called “aguardiente” widely produced although illegal. Zacatlán has two factories, one which produces pistols and Relojes Centenario, Mexico’s best known monumental clock maker. There has been some industrialization such as the introduction of maquiladoras in the municipalities of Hueytamalco, Teziutlán, Ocotepec and Pahuatlán.|$|R
25|$|Fondo Nacional para el Fomento de las Artesanías (FONART), the Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana-Iztapalapa, the Universidad Veracruzana and the Instituto de Artesanías e Industrias Populares de Puebla {{have been}} working on ways to make <b>amate</b> <b>paper</b> making more sustainable. One aspect is to manage the {{collection}} of bark. Another is to find a substitute for caustic soda to soften and prepare the fibers without losing quality. Not only is the soda polluting, it has had negative effects on artisans' health. As of 2010, the group has reported advances in its investigations such as ways of including new types of bark from other species.|$|E
25|$|The {{paper is}} mostly seen as neutral, gaining power {{as it is}} cut. However, in general white paper is {{considered}} to have positive connotations and dark to have negative. While <b>amate</b> <b>paper</b> is the most traditional, commercially made paper is also used. Shamans from other Otomi villages preferred to use San Pablito-produced paper because it {{was believed to be}} more powerful. The ability to use industrial paper meant that the making of amate was on the decline in the mid-20th century. Otomi rituals have made a comeback, and, as a consequence, so has interest in amate as a commercial product, which has helped to save it.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} <b>amate</b> <b>paper</b> commercialization {{has led to}} {{environmental}} issues in the San Pablito area and farther away. It is getting harder to find bark due to the over-stripping of trees {{and the loss of}} forests to agriculture and development. There have been attempts to cultivate the tree species currently used for paper-making, but without success. Currently, there are attempts to reforest the area with a similar species which grows to maturity faster. The use of caustic soda and industrial dyes in the process of making amate has caused problems with pollution, especially of the San Marcos River, whose waters then pollute the Cazones River.|$|E
25|$|<b>Amate</b> <b>paper</b> {{was used}} most {{extensively}} during the Triple Alliance Empire. This paper was manufactured in over 40 villages in territory {{controlled by the}} Aztecs and then handed over as tribute by the conquered peoples. This amounted to about 480,000 sheets annually. Most of the production was concentrated in the modern state of Morelos, where Ficus trees are abundant because of the climate. This paper {{was assigned to the}} royal sector, to be used as gifts on special occasions or as rewards for warriors. It was also sent to the religious elites for ritual purposes. The last share was allotted to royal scribes for the writing of codices and other records.|$|E
25|$|About {{seventy percent}} of amate makers sell to wholesalers, with only the biggest {{manufactures}} having their own outside contracts. These larger concerns also produce {{nearly all of the}} output outside of the standard 60 by 40cm sheet. Each standard sheet costs about four pesos to make. High-quality paper by known artisans can sell for as high as USD $500 on the international market. The dependence on local wholesalers led to socio-economic stratification in the town, with the wholesalers receiving more profit off the paper than the producers. It is estimated that today about fifty percent of production ultimately goes to Nahua painters, with about {{seventy percent of}} the resulting paintings sold in Mexico. <b>Amate</b> <b>paper</b> sold internationally is generally used for arts, crafts, stationery and home décor.|$|E
25|$|The Otomi paper makers {{generally}} {{sell their}} production {{to a limited}} number of wholesalers, because of limited Spanish skills and contact with the outside. This means about ten wholesalers controlling the distribution of about half of all Otomi production. These wholesalers, as well as artisans such as the Nahua who use the paper as the basis of their own work, have many more contacts and as a result, retail sales of the product are wide ranging and varied both within Mexico and abroad. <b>Amate</b> <b>paper</b> products are still sold on the streets and markets in Mexico, much as commercialization of the produce began in the 20th century, often in venues that cater to tourists. However, through wholesalers, the paper also ends up in handicraft stores, open bazaars, specialty shops and the Internet. Much of it is used to create paintings, and the finest of these have been exhibited in both national and international museums and galleries. The paper is sold retail in the town to tourists as well as in shops in cities such as Oaxaca, Tijuana, Mexico City, Guadalajara, Monterrey and Puebla. It is also exported to the United States, especially to Miami.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{masks and}} costumes was an {{important}} part of Mesoamerican cultures for long before the arrival of the Spanish. Evidence of masks made with bone thousands of years old have been found at Tequixquiac, State of Mexico. These masks had various uses but always in connection to ceremony and ritual especially in theatrical dance and processions. Masks were used by high priests to incarnate deities. Jaguar and eagle warriors dressed themselves like these animals in order to gain their strengths. Funeral masks were reserved to the burials of the very elite, such as that of King Pakal and were works of art, made of jade, shell, obsidian, hematite and other precious materials of the time. Masks used in theatrical performances and dances varies widely from the various animals of the Mesoamerican world, to those of old men and women generally for comedic relief to those designed to make fun of neighboring ethnic groups. Some of the ancient masks made of stone or fired clay have survived to the present. However, most were made of degradable materials such as wood, <b>amate</b> <b>paper,</b> cloth and feathers. Knowledge of these types comes from codices, depictions on sculptures and the writings of the conquering Spanish. Indications also exist with the survival of a number of dances from the pre- Hispanic period such as Tecuanes, Tigres and Tlacololeros.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Amate,</b> <b>paper</b> made of bark, used in pre-Columbian Central America ...|$|E
2500|$|The rise of <b>amate</b> <b>paper</b> {{occurred}} {{during a time}} when government policies towards rural indigenous people and their crafts were changing, with the latter being encourage especially to help develop the tourism industry. FONART became part of the consolidation of distribution efforts for <b>amate</b> <b>paper.</b> [...] Much of this involved buying all of the Otomi production of bark paper to ensure that the Nahua would have sufficient supplies. Although this intervention lasted for only about two years, it was crucial for developing sales of amate crafts in national and international markets.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Amate</b> <b>paper</b> was {{extensively}} {{produced and}} used for both communication, records, and ritual during the Triple Alliance; however, after the Spanish conquest, its production was mostly banned and replaced by European paper. <b>Amate</b> <b>paper</b> production never completely died, nor did the rituals associated with it. It remained strongest in the rugged, remote mountainous areas of northern Puebla and northern Veracruz states. Spiritual leaders in the small village of San Pablito, Puebla were described as producing paper with [...] "magical" [...] properties. Foreign academics began studying this ritual use of amate in the mid-20th century, and the Otomi people of the area began producing the paper commercially. Otomi craftspeople began selling it {{in cities such as}} Mexico City, where the paper was revived by Nahua painters in Guerrero to create [...] "new" [...] indigenous craft, which was then promoted by the Mexican government.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>amate</b> <b>paper</b> {{paintings}} are {{a combination of}} Nahua and Otomi traditions. The Otomi produce the paper, and the Nahua have transferred and adapted painting traditions associated with ceramics [...] to the paper. The Nahuatl word [...] "amate" [...] is applied to both the paper and the paintings done on the paper. Each Nahua village has its own painting style [...] which was developed for ceramics, originally commercialized in Acapulco and other tourist areas {{as early as the}} 1940s. The adaption of this painting to <b>amate</b> <b>paper</b> came in the 1960s and quickly spread to various villages until it became the primary economic activity in eight Nahua villages in Guerrero, Ameyaltepec, Oapan, Ahuahuapan, Ahuelican, Analco, San Juan Tetelcingo, Xalitla and Maxela. The paper is that it evokes Mexico's pre-Columbian past in addition to the customary designs painted on it.|$|E
2500|$|The {{selling of}} <b>amate</b> <b>paper</b> {{outside of the}} {{municipality}} has given the town political and economic clout in the municipality of Pahuatlán. Because of the community’s economic and political skills, {{it is the only}} community (aside from the seat) with a high school, computers, and private telephone service. Much of the town’s political clout is with state and federal authorities.|$|E
2500|$|Through {{this and}} other innovations, <b>amate</b> <b>paper</b> {{is one of the}} most widely {{available}} Mexican indigenous handicrafts, sold both nationally and abroad. Nahua paintings of the paper, which is also called [...] "amate," [...] receive the most attention, but Otomi paper makers have also received attention not only for the paper itself but for crafts made with it such as elaborate cut outs.|$|E
