5|$|As the {{conflict}} raged, other Arab governments attempted to negotiate <b>a</b> <b>peaceful</b> <b>resolution.</b> As {{part of this}} effort, Gamal Abdel Nasser led the first emergency Arab League summit in Cairo on 21 September. Arafat's speech drew sympathy from attending Arab leaders. Other heads of state took sides against Hussein, among them Muammar Gaddafi, who mocked him and his schizophrenic father King Talal. A ceasefire was agreed upon between the two sides, but Nasser died of a massive heart attack hours after the summit, and {{the conflict}} resumed shortly afterward.|$|E
5|$|Both Sherman and McKinley sought <b>a</b> <b>peaceful</b> <b>resolution</b> to the Cuban War, preferably {{involving}} an independent Cuba without American intervention. The United States and Spain began {{negotiations on the}} subject in 1897, but {{it became clear that}} Spain would never concede Cuban independence, while the rebels (and their American supporters) would never settle for anything less. In January 1898, Spain promised some concessions to the rebels, but when American consul Fitzhugh Lee reported riots in Havana, McKinley agreed to send the battleship USS Maine there to protect American lives and property. On February 15, the Maine exploded and sank with 266 men killed.|$|E

5|$|President Smetona {{received}} memoranda {{from nine}} nationalistic organizations urging {{the government to}} reject the ultimatum. However, a decisive comment was made by General Stasys Raštikis, {{the commander of the}} Lithuanian army: He testified that a military victory over Poland was impossible and argued for <b>a</b> <b>peaceful</b> <b>resolution.</b> The government's decision was confirmed by the Fourth Seimas with minimal discussion. On March 19, Dailidė relayed acceptance of the ultimatum to the Poles, who gave a 12-hour extension to decide on the ultimatum as a show of good faith.|$|E
5|$|In October 1873, Grant's {{neutrality}} {{policy was}} shaken, when a Spanish cruiser captured a merchant ship, Virginius, flying the U.S. flag, carrying war materials and men {{to aid the}} Cuban insurrection. Spanish authorities executed the prisoners, including eight American citizens, and many Americans called for war with Spain. Grant ordered the Navy to increase its presence in the Caribbean. Fish, with Grant's support, worked to reach <b>a</b> <b>peaceful</b> <b>resolution.</b> Spain's president, Emilio Castelar y Ripoll, expressed regret for the tragedy, surrendered the Virginius and paid a cash indemnity of $80,000 {{to the families of}} the executed Americans. Realizing the Navy was susceptible to European naval powers, in June 1874, Secretary Robeson commissioned the reconstruction of five redesigned double-turreted monitor warships.|$|E
5|$|In foreign policy, Grant {{sought to}} {{increase}} trade and influence while remaining at peace with the world. With Secretary of State Hamilton Fish, he successfully resolved the Alabama claims through the Treaty of Washington with Great Britain. Grant and Fish negotiated <b>a</b> <b>peaceful</b> <b>resolution</b> with Spain over the Virginius Affair. Congress rejected Grant's initiative to annex the Dominican Republic, creating a rift among Republicans. His administration implemented a gold standard and sought to strengthen the dollar. Grant's immediate response to the Panic of 1873 failed to halt a severe industrial depression that produced high unemployment, deflation, and bankruptcies. When Grant left office in 1877, he embarked on a two-year world tour that captured favorable global attention for him and the United States.|$|E

5|$|On 26 February 1793, another vote {{to abolish}} the slave trade was {{narrowly}} defeated by eight votes. The outbreak of war with France the same month effectively prevented any further serious consideration of the issue, as politicians concentrated on the national crisis {{and the threat of}} invasion. The same year, and again in 1794, Wilberforce unsuccessfully brought before Parliament a bill to outlaw British ships from supplying slaves to foreign colonies. He voiced his concern about the war and urged Pitt and his government to make greater efforts to end hostilities. Growing more alarmed, on 31 December 1794, Wilberforce moved that the government seek <b>a</b> <b>peaceful</b> <b>resolution</b> with France, a stance that created a temporary breach in his long friendship with Pitt.|$|E
5|$|Kojima Productions have {{compared}} Raiden and Solid Snake {{as to their}} experiences and ways of thinking. During the game's climax, Raiden stays handcuffed until his final fight against Solidus Snake; Snake escapes from his handcuffs to follow Revolver Ocelot, emphasizing Raiden's lack of freedom. Hideo Kojima compared Raiden and Snake with movie monsters King Kong and Godzilla, respectively; the former was taken from his home and his nature changed upon meeting Rosemary, whereas the latter will continue fighting against mankind's menaces. Defeating Solidus, Raiden is encouraged by Snake to trust himself and believe in his own choices. This is further addressed by the staff's motivation {{to make a new}} sequel to Metal Gear without Kojima. Kojima has also likened him with John Rambo from the Rambo series as both characters always find themselves taking part in battles despite their desire for <b>a</b> <b>peaceful</b> <b>resolution.</b>|$|E
5|$|Napoleon's {{efforts to}} win over both the Egyptians and the Ottomans proved unsuccessful; the Ottoman Empire {{declared}} war on September 9, 1798, and a revolt against French troops was launched from al-Azhar on October 21, 1798. Egyptians armed with stones, spears, and knives rioted and looted. The following morning the diwan met with Napoleon {{in an attempt to}} bring about a peaceful conclusion to the hostilities. Napoleon, initially incensed, agreed to attempt <b>a</b> <b>peaceful</b> <b>resolution</b> and asked the sheikhs of the diwan to organize talks with the rebels. The rebels, believing the move indicated weakness among the French, refused. Napoleon then ordered that the city be fired upon from the Cairo Citadel, aiming directly at al-Azhar. During the revolt two to three hundred French soldiers were killed, with 3,000 Egyptian casualties. Six of the ulema of al-Azhar were killed following summary judgments laid against them, with several more condemned. Any Egyptian caught by French troops was imprisoned or, if caught bearing weapons, beheaded. The French troops intentionally desecrated the mosque, walking in with their shoes on and guns displayed. The troops tied their horses to the mihrab and ransacked the student quarters and libraries, throwing copies of the Quran on the floor. The leaders of the revolt then attempted to negotiate a settlement with Napoleon, but were rebuffed.|$|E

5|$|One {{reason for}} the change of {{strategy}} towards Scotland was {{a growing concern for}} the relationship between England and France. As long as Scotland and France were in an alliance, the English were {{faced with the prospect of}} fighting a war on two fronts. The French carried out raids on English coastal towns, leading to rumours in England of a full-scale French invasion. In 1337, Philip VI confiscated the English king's Duchy of Aquitaine and the county of Ponthieu. Instead of seeking <b>a</b> <b>peaceful</b> <b>resolution</b> to the conflict by paying homage to the French king, as his father had done, Edward responded by laying claim to the French crown as the grandson of Philip IV. The French rejected this based on the precedents for agnatic succession set in 1316 and 1322. Instead, they upheld the rights of PhilipIV's nephew, King Philip VI (an agnatic descendant of the House of France), thereby setting the stage for the Hundred Years' War (see family tree below). In the early stages of the war, Edward's strategy was to build alliances with other Continental princes. In 1338, LouisIV named Edward vicar-general of the Holy Roman Empire and promised his support. As late as 1373, the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1373 established an Anglo-Portuguese Alliance. These measures produced few results; the only major military victory in this phase of the war was the English naval victory at Sluys on 24 June 1340, which secured English control of the Channel.|$|E
5|$|The Jurchens {{tried to}} conquer {{southern}} China in the 1130s, {{but they were}} bogged down by a pro-Song insurgency {{in the north and}} a counteroffensive by the Song generals Yue Fei, Han Shizhong, and others. The generals regained some territories but retreated on the orders of the Southern Song emperor, who supported <b>a</b> <b>peaceful</b> <b>resolution</b> to the war. The Treaty of Shaoxing in 1142 settled the boundary between the two empires along the Huai River, but conflicts between the two dynasties continued until the fall of the Jin in 1234. A campaign against the Song by the fourth Jin emperor, Wanyan Liang (the Prince of Hailing), was unsuccessful. He lost the Battle of Caishi (1161) and was later assassinated by his own disaffected officers. An invasion of the Jin motivated by Song revanchism (1206–1208) was also unsuccessful. A decade later, the Jin launched an abortive military campaign against the Song in 1217 to compensate for the territory that they had lost to the invading Mongols. The Song formed an alliance with the Mongols in 1233, and in the following year jointly captured Caizhou, the last refuge of the Jin emperor. The Jin dynasty collapsed that year in 1234. After the demise of the Jin, the Song dynasty itself became a target of the Mongols, and fell in 1279.|$|E
