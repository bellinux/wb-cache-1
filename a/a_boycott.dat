5|$|However, another {{obstacle}} arose {{with the}} Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, {{which resulted in}} <b>a</b> <b>boycott</b> of the Games by {{a large part of}} the Western World, led by the United States. The Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser was also the patron of the Australian Olympic Committee, and significant political pressure came to bear on the athletes to boycott the Games. Tonelli, however, realised that only the sportspeople would suffer from <b>a</b> <b>boycott</b> and that trade relations would continue unabated. He took a leadership role among the athletes to fight for their right to compete.|$|E

5|$|There {{had been}} growing calls for boycotts of Chinese goods and the 2008 Olympics in Beijing in protest of China's human rights record, and in {{response}} to Tibetan disturbances. Ultimately, no nation supported <b>a</b> <b>boycott.</b> In August 2008, the government of Georgia called for <b>a</b> <b>boycott</b> of the 2014 Winter Olympics, set to be held in Sochi, Russia, in response to Russia's participation in the 2008 South Ossetia war.|$|E

5|$|In December 2011, Obama {{instructed}} {{agencies to}} consider LGBT rights when issuing {{financial aid to}} foreign countries.

5|$|Another {{commemorative}} {{event was}} {{proposed for the}} anniversary, the Moulin à paroles. Thousands gathered on the Plains of Abraham to listen to recitations of 140 significant texts from Quebec history, including the 1970 FLQ Manifesto.

The Moulin à paroles took place without incident.|$|E

5|$|Heydrich was {{assigned}} to help organise the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. The games were used to promote the propaganda aims of the Nazi regime. Goodwill ambassadors were sent to countries that were considering <b>a</b> <b>boycott.</b> Anti-Jewish violence was forbidden for the duration, and news stands were required to stop displaying copies of Der Stürmer. For his part in the games' success, Heydrich was awarded the Deutsches Olympiaehrenzeichen or German Olympic Games Decoration (First Class).|$|E
50|$|Similar boycotts {{have been}} {{proposed}} outside the Arab world and the Muslim world. These boycotts comprise economic measures such as divestment; <b>a</b> consumer <b>boycott</b> of Israeli products or businesses that operate in Israel; <b>a</b> proposed academic <b>boycott</b> of Israeli universities and scholars; and <b>a</b> proposed <b>boycott</b> of Israeli cultural institutions or Israeli sport venues. Many advocates of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaign, including Archbishop Desmond Tutu use the 1980s movement against South African apartheid as a model.|$|R

5|$|The year 1968 {{had seen}} {{turmoil in the}} United States, {{including}} riots and the assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King. Prior to the Olympics in Mexico City in October 1968, some African Americans, led by activist Harry Edwards, had urged <b>a</b> <b>boycott</b> of the Games, but found little enthusiasm among athletes, reluctant to waste years of effort. The atmosphere was made more tense by unrest in Mexico City before the Games which left dozens dead.|$|E
5|$|The1986 Commonwealth Gameswere held in Edinburgh, Scotland {{and were}} the second Games {{to be held in}} Edinburgh. Participation at the 1986 Games was {{affected}} by <b>a</b> <b>boycott</b> by 32 African, Asian and Caribbean nations in protest of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's refusal to condemn sporting contacts of Apartheid era South Africa in 1985, but the Games rebounded and continued to grow thereafter. Twenty-six nations did attend the second Edinburgh Games and sent a total of 1,662 athletes and 461 officials.|$|E
5|$|As a young social worker, in 1963 Stephenson led <b>a</b> <b>boycott</b> of the Bristol Omnibus Company, protesting {{against its}} refusal to employ Black or Asian drivers or conductors. After a 60-day boycott {{supported}} by thousands of Bristolians, the company revoked its colour bar in August. In 1964 Stephenson achieved national fame when he refused to leave a public house until he was served, resulting in a trial {{on a charge of}} failing to leave a licensed premises. His campaigns were instrumental in paving the way for the first Race Relations Act, in 1965. Stephenson is a Freeman of the City of Bristol and was awarded an OBE in 2009.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} {{three years after}} independence, the Naga National Council called for <b>a</b> <b>boycott</b> of Independence Day in {{northeast}} India. Separatist protests in this region intensified in the 1980s; calls for boycotts and terrorist attacks by insurgent organisations such as the United Liberation Front of Assam and the National Democratic Front of Bodoland, marred celebrations. With increasing insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir from the late 1980s, separatist protesters boycotted Independence Day there with bandh (strikes), use of black flags and by flag burning. Terrorist outfits such as Lashkar-e-Taiba, the Hizbul Mujahideen and the Jaish-e-Mohammed have issued threats, and have carried out attacks around Independence Day. Boycotting of the celebration has also been advocated by insurgent Maoist rebel organisations.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{retirement}} from athletics, Brundage became a sports administrator, rising rapidly {{through the ranks}} in United States sports groups. As leader of America's Olympic organizations, he fought zealously against <b>a</b> <b>boycott</b> of the 1936 Summer Olympics, which had been awarded to Germany before the rise of its Nazi government and its subsequent, escalating persecution of Jews. Although Brundage was successful in getting a team to the Games in Berlin, its participation was controversial and has remained so. Brundage {{was elected to the}} IOC that year, and quickly became a major figure in the Olympic movement. He was elected IOC president in 1952.|$|E
5|$|In 1765, Parliament {{passed the}} Stamp Act which {{required}} colonists {{to pay a}} new tax on most printed materials. News of {{the passage of the}} Stamp Act produced an uproar in the colonies. The colonial response echoed Adams's 1764 instructions. In June 1765, Otis called for a Stamp Act Congress to coordinate colonial resistance. The Virginia House of Burgesses passed a widely reprinted set of resolves against the Stamp Act that resembled Adams's arguments against the Sugar Act. Adams argued that the Stamp Act was unconstitutional; he also believed that it would hurt the economy of the British Empire. He supported calls for <b>a</b> <b>boycott</b> of British goods to put pressure on Parliament to repeal the tax.|$|E
50|$|In March 1997, Price Pfister {{moved more}} of its {{manufacturing}} operations from the Pacoima plant over to Mexicali, Mexico, laying off approximately 300 U.S. workers.

50|$|As {{might have}} been expected, the {{relationship}} between the Mayo Echo and the local council (Mayo County Council) was not amicable, and, in the last online edition, editor Tony Geraghty stated that there had been <b>a</b> three-year <b>boycott</b> of the paper by the Council. It is understood that the Mayo Echo was not available in the Mayo County Library and the Council operated <b>an</b> advertising <b>boycott.</b>|$|R
5|$|In 1926 he left Cambridge for the University of Göttingen {{to study}} under Max Born. Göttingen {{was one of}} the world's leading centers for {{theoretical}} physics. Oppenheimer made friends who went on to great success, including Werner Heisenberg, Pascual Jordan, Wolfgang Pauli, Paul Dirac, Enrico Fermi and Edward Teller. He was known for being too enthusiastic in discussion, sometimes to the point of taking over seminar sessions. This irritated some of Born's other students so much that Maria Goeppert presented Born with a petition signed by herself and others threatening <b>a</b> <b>boycott</b> of the class unless he made Oppenheimer quiet down. Born left it out on his desk where Oppenheimer could read it, and it was effective without a word being said.|$|E
5|$|In 1972 and 1976 a {{large number}} of African {{countries}} threatened the IOC with <b>a</b> <b>boycott</b> to force them to ban South Africa and Rhodesia, because of their segregationist regimes. New Zealand {{was also one of the}} African boycott targets, because its national rugby union team had toured apartheid-ruled South Africa. The IOC conceded in the first two cases, but refused to ban New Zealand on the grounds that rugby was not an Olympic sport. Fulfilling their threat, twenty African countries were joined by Guyana and Iraq in a withdrawal from the Montreal Games, after a few of their athletes had already competed.|$|E
5|$|Initially, this protest did not {{attract a}} great deal of attention, and even the IRA {{regarded}} it as a side-issue compared to their armed campaign. It began to attract attention when Tomás Ó Fiaich, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Armagh, visited the prison and condemned the conditions there. In 1979, former MP Bernadette McAliskey stood in the election for the European Parliament on a platform of support for the protesting prisoners, and won 5.9% of the vote across Northern Ireland, even though Sinn Féin had called for <b>a</b> <b>boycott</b> of the election.|$|E
