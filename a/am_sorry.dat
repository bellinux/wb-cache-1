25|$|I <b>am</b> <b>sorry</b> to {{transmit}} to Your Lordship the disagreeable {{account of a}} disagreeable Business, {{some time in the}} Beginning of this Month, upon news of the Rebel Army approaching, General Carleton set out for Montreal in great Haste; the 7th instant the Rebels landed in the Woods near St. John's, and beat back to their Boats by a Party of Savages incamped at that Place; in this Action the Savages behaved with great Spirit and Resolution, and had they remained firm to our Interests, probably the Province would have been safe for this Year, but finding the Canadians in General averse to the taking up Arms for the Defence of their Country, they withdrew, and made their Peace.|$|E
25|$|My dear friend, {{what is this}} our life? A {{boat that}} swims in the sea, and all one knows for certain {{about it is that}} one day it will capsize. Here we are, two good old boats that have been {{faithful}} neighbors, and above all your hand has done its best to keep me from 'capsizing'! Let us then continue our voyage -- each for the other's sake, for a long time yet, a long time! We should miss each other so much! Tolerably calm seas and good winds and above all sun -- what I wish for myself, I wish for you, too, and <b>am</b> <b>sorry</b> that my gratitude can find expression only in such a wish and has no influence at all on wind or weather.|$|E

25|$|On 7 August 2005, Olmert was {{appointed}} acting finance minister, replacing Benjamin Netanyahu, who had resigned in {{protest against the}} planned Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. Olmert, who had originally opposed withdrawing from land captured in the Six-Day War, and who had voted against the Camp David Peace Accords in 1978, was a vocal supporter of the Gaza pullout. After his appointment, Olmert said:I voted against Menachem Begin, I {{told him it was}} a historic mistake, how dangerous it would be, {{and so on and so}} on. Now I <b>am</b> <b>sorry</b> he is not alive for me to be able to publicly recognize his wisdom and my mistake. He was right and I was wrong. Thank God we pulled out of the Sinai. When Sharon announced he was leaving Likud to form a new party, Kadima, Olmert was one of the first to join him.|$|E
500|$|On August 14, Manning {{apologized to}} the court: [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>sorry</b> that my actions hurt people. I'm sorry that they hurt the United States.

At {{the time of my}} decisions I was dealing with a lot of issues." ...|$|E

60|$|The Indian who {{had spoken}} before now rose {{and said he}} <b>was</b> <b>sorry</b> there should <b>be</b> any cause of {{difference}} between them, and added he <b>was</b> <b>sorry</b> for a great many more things besides, {{but he did not}} say he <b>was</b> <b>sorry</b> for having told a lie.|$|R

500|$|... "To {{those people}} who complained that a {{photograph}} appeared in the press showing Connie and Sam kissing when they did not actually kiss in the transmitted episode, I am afraid I must say a genuine mistake occurred for which I apologise. The only script that ever featured Connie and Sam actually kissing was in the final scene of Episode 44 (transmitted on 29 August). This was edited together as scripted and shot. Nothing was cut [...] I <b>am</b> <b>sorry</b> if some members of our audience felt cheated. A photographer attended the shoot for Episode 46 and took a selection of shots of Sam and Connie. A photograph from this shoot was mistakenly released and marked as being from Episode 45 as Connie was wearing the same outfit in both episodes. I can only apologise for this mistake. [...] I <b>am</b> <b>sorry</b> a few people had concerns over these episodes." ...|$|E

500|$|Obama's {{previous}} unambiguous {{assurance that}} consumers' could keep their own plans became {{a focal point}} for critics, who challenged his truthfulness. On November 7, 2013, President Obama stated: [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>sorry</b> that [...] are finding themselves in this situation based on assurances they got from me." [...] Various bills were introduced in Congress to allow people to keep their plans.|$|E

500|$|Mrs. Picto was Lady Dudley's maid and Thomas Blount {{asked whether}} she thought what had {{happened}} was [...] "chance or villany": she said by her faith she doth judge very chance, and neither done by man nor by herself. For herself, she said, she was a good virtuous gentlewoman, and daily would pray upon her knees; and divers times she saith that she hath heard her pray to God to deliver her from desperation. Then, said I, she might have an evil toy [...] in her mind. No, good Mr. Blount, said Picto, do not judge so of my words; if you should so gather, I <b>am</b> <b>sorry</b> I said so much.|$|E
500|$|Beauregard {{served as}} {{adjutant}} general for the Louisiana state militia, 1879–88. In 1888, {{he was elected}} as commissioner of public works in New Orleans. When John Bell Hood and his wife died in 1879, leaving ten destitute orphans, Beauregard used his influence to get Hood's memoirs published, with all proceeds going to the children. He was appointed by the governor of Virginia to be the grand marshal of the festivities associated with the laying of the cornerstone of Robert E. Lee's statue in Richmond. But when Jefferson Davis died in 1889, Beauregard refused the honor of heading the funeral procession, saying [...] "We have always been enemies. I cannot pretend I <b>am</b> <b>sorry</b> he is gone.

500|$|The Dark Blues had {{extended}} their {{lead to a}} length by the soap works before shooting Hammersmith Bridge two lengths ahead.

[...] At Barnes Bridge, the Dark Blues were a further length ahead, and continued to extend their lead until the flag-boat, which they passed six lengths ahead {{in a time of}} 20 minutes 56 seconds. [...] Oxford's victory, their eighth in a row, took their overall lead to 1510 in the event. Willan paid tribute to his cox: [...] "In conclusion, I must again testify to the splendid steering of Tottenham, who for the fifth and I <b>am</b> <b>sorry</b> to say for the last time has contributed mainly to our victory over Cambridge." ...|$|E
500|$|Having {{originally}} {{agreed to}} serve {{for a year}} Gleeson wrote to Father Bernard Rawlinson, the senior Roman Catholic chaplain, in October 1915 requesting that he be relieved of duty stating that [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>sorry</b> to be leaving the dear old Munster lads, but I really can't stand it any longer. I {{do not like the}} life, though I love the poor men ever so much". He became a curate at the Church of Our Lady of Lourdes in Dublin but requested permission from his Archbishop, William Walsh, to return to army service for another year. He was recommissioned in his previous rank on 15 May 1917 and would serve another two years.

500|$|The {{defendants}} {{pleaded not}} guilty, {{saying that they}} had not meant their protest to be offensive. [...] "We sang part of the refrain 'Holy shit'," [...] Tolokonnikova said in court. [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>sorry</b> if I offended anyone with this. It is an idiomatic expression, related to the previous verse — about the fusion of Moscow patriarchy and the government. 'Holy shit' is our evaluation of the situation in the country. This opinion is not blasphemy." [...] Their lawyers stated that the circumstances of the case had revived the Soviet-era tradition of the show trial. On August 15, 20 protesters wearing balaclavas gathered in support of Pussy Riot at Christ the Savior Cathedral, and held up placards reading [...] "Blessed are the merciful". Cathedral guards quickly moved against the protesters, trying to detain them and taking off their balaclavas.|$|E

500|$|Soon {{after the}} book's publication, Potter's ageing Mrs. Tiggy began {{showing signs of}} failing health. She wrote a friend on February 1, 1906, [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>sorry</b> to say I am upset about poor Mrs. Tiggy. She hasn't seemed well the last fortnight, and {{has begun to be}} sick, and she is so thin. I am going to try some physic but I am a little afraid that the long course of unnatural diet and indoor life is {{beginning}} to tell on her. It is a wonder she has lasted so long. One gets very fond of a little animal. I hope she will either get well or go quickly." [...] A few weeks later Potter chloroformed her beloved hedgehog and laid her to rest in the garden at the Potter family home at 2 Bolton Gardens, Kensington.|$|E
500|$|A {{detail of}} papal carabinieri (military police) led by Marshal Pietro Lucidi and Brigadier Giuseppe Agostini {{arrived at the}} Mortara {{apartment}} in Bologna soon after sunset on 23 June 1858.

Marianna screamed hysterically, ran to Edgardo's bed and shrieked {{that they would have to}} kill her before taking him. Lucidi said repeatedly that he was only following Feletti's orders. He reported afterwards that he [...] "would have a thousand times preferred to be exposed to much more serious dangers in performing my duties than to have to witness such a painful scene." ...|$|E
500|$|Fleming {{was a heavy}} smoker and drinker {{throughout}} his adult life, and suffered from heart disease. In 1961, aged 53, he {{suffered a heart attack}} and struggled to recuperate. On 11 August 1964, while staying at a hotel in Canterbury, Fleming went to the Royal St George's Golf Club for lunch and later dined at his hotel with friends. The day had been tiring for him, and he collapsed with another heart attack shortly after the meal. Fleming died at age 56 in the early morning of 12 August 1964—his son Caspar's twelfth birthday. His last recorded words were an apology to the ambulance drivers for having inconvenienced them, saying [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>sorry</b> to trouble you chaps. I don't know how you get along so fast with the traffic on the roads these days." [...] Fleming was buried in the churchyard of Sevenhampton, near Swindon.|$|E
