2500|$|Five or {{six years}} ago, I, too, was walking around on the streets down there, didn't know a soul here in town, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> gloating over my Shakespeare {{in the home of}} a kind and {{respected}} family. O Lord, I could kiss you!" ...|$|E
60|$|We {{had heard}} {{of it in the}} camp, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> myself to see that it was true.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> gratified to {{hear this}} bit of news. I liked Dick in many respects, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> almost ready to look upon him as a friend.|$|R
60|$|I had had my {{nightingale}} days, my cuckoo and blackbird and tree-pipit days, {{with others}} {{too numerous to}} mention, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> having my greenfinch days; and these were the last.|$|R
2500|$|The judge William Keogh, before passing {{sentence}} {{asked him}} if he had any further remarks to make in reference to his case. Mr. Kickham briefly replied: [...] "I believe, my lords, I have said enough already. I will only add that I am convicted for doing nothing but my duty. I have endeavoured to serve Ireland, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> prepared to suffer for Ireland." [...] Then the judge with many expressions of sympathy for the prisoner, and many compliments in reference to his intellectual attainments, sentenced him to be kept in penal servitude for fourteen years.|$|E
2500|$|In 1930, Darger {{settled into}} a second-floor room on Chicago's North Side at 851 W. Webster Avenue in the Lincoln Park section of the city, near the DePaul University campus. It was in this room for the next 43 years that Darger would imagine and write his massive tomes (in {{addition}} to a 10-year daily weather journal and assorted diaries) {{until his death in}} April 1973 in St. Augustine's Catholic Mission home (the same institution in which his father had died). In the last entry in his diary, he wrote: [...] "January 1, 1971. I had a very poor nothing like Christmas. Never had a good Christmas all my life, nor a good new year, <b>and</b> <b>now...</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> very bitter but fortunately not revengeful, though I feel should be how I am..." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Babylonian Talmud {{mentions}} Metatron in {{two other}} places: Sanhedrin 38b and Avodah Zarah 3b. In Sanhedrin 38b a Minim tells Rabbi Idith that Metatron should be worshiped {{because he has a}} name like his master. Rabbi Idith uses the same passage Exodus 23:21 to show that Metatron was an angel and not a deity and thus should not be worshiped. Furthermore, as an angel Metatron has no power to pardon transgressions nor was he to be received even as a messenger of forgiveness. Avodah Zarah 3b: In the fourth quarter God sits and instructs the school children. In the preceding three quarters Metatron may take God's place or God may do this among other tasks. B Yevamot 16b records an utterance attributed to the Prince of the World. [...] "I have been young <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> old." [...] In rabbinic tradition this utterance is attributed to Metatron.|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{going away}} {{without a word}} or a sign, or even the {{slightest}} trifle which I could cherish as a memento of her. There was a blankness about it all which deadened my soul.|$|R
60|$|The man evidently did {{not know}} what to say, and as a matter of fact, neither did I. I had told him some plain truths, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> anxious to get away from him and think out my future course of action.|$|R
5000|$|Afterward, the Russian generals {{came up to}} me, very friendly, {{and asked}} me how I had learned to speak Russian so fluently....

2500|$|In January 2008, {{the media}} {{reported}} that Patel and Bhatt broke their five-year relationship. Bhatt confirmed the break-up {{in a conversation}} with Mid-Day. Shortly afterwards, Patel's parents explained their willingness to reconcile with their daughter and that [...] "everybody is happy about the break-up" [...] but their relationship remained strained. On 12 March 2008, Patel was spotted with London-based businessman Kanav Puri at Wills Lifestyle India Fashion Week. In June 2008, she confirmed their relationship in an interview with Mid-Day: [...] "I did not admit to Kanav sooner because he's very special and I did not want to jinx it. It was too precious for me to talk about it to people. It's almost six months now <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> feeling secure and now I know our relationship is too strong for anything or anyone to come between us." [...] The media once reported that she got married to Puri but she denied these rumours.|$|E

6000|$|... 87. <b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{sorry that}} God {{had made me}} man, for <b>I</b> feared <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a reprobate; <b>I</b> counted man as unconverted, the most doleful of all the creatures. Thus being afflicted and tossed about my sad condition, I counted myself alone, and above the most of men unblessed.|$|R
60|$|There is nothing, unless, perhaps, the English language, more terrible {{than the}} {{workings}} of an English railway-line. An instant before {{it seemed as though}} we were going to spend all eternity at Framlynghame Admiral, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> watching the tail of the train disappear round the curve of the cutting.|$|R
60|$|I {{took a look}} at the {{branches}} about me, to see where a shower of bullets would be most likely to do me least hurt; and I took a look back at the track I had made in forcing my way in; <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> wholly prepared <b>and</b> fully ready for them.|$|R
60|$|But I {{have been}} tired at times. I was very tired to-night--and you came. <b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> glad, only glad.|$|E

60|$|We had a {{very good}} voyage to the Brasils, and arrived in the Bay de Todos los Santos, or All Saints' Bay, in about twenty-two days after. <b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> once more {{delivered}} from the most miserable of all conditions of life; and what to do next with myself <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> to consider.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> had <b>been</b> so {{paralyzed by}} {{surprise}} that I {{had made no}} move to reach the deck during the awe-inspiring scene which I had just witnessed, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> to be still further amazed by her next act, for Phaidor extended her hand to me and assisted me to the deck, where I stood gazing at her in unconcealed and stupefied wonderment.|$|R
60|$|All {{this time}} the boat <b>was</b> coming on; <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> able to {{perceive}} {{it was the same}} boat and the same two men as yesterday.

60|$|Mal. Ha! 'tis well, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> revenged. I was {{in hopes}} thou wouldst have uttered treason, And {{forfeited}} thy head, {{to pay me}} fully.|$|E

60|$|All that my well-meaning friend {{suggested}} made me, of course, {{only the}} {{more eager to}} go with Jones.

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> in {{a furious}} temper.
