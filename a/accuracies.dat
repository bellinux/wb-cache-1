5|$|Limousins in {{different}} countries are bred according to different selection practices or objectives, and are connected by limited international gene flows. Poor genetic connectedness between countries has negative implications for estimation <b>accuracies</b> of international genetic prediction programmes. As a result of genetic drift or different selection, each country's population of Limousins is becoming genetically differentiated, but which is counterbalanced to a limited extent by gene flows from other countries. A study of over 2.4million Limousin pedigree files of five European countries (France, Denmark, Ireland, Sweden, United Kingdom) showed moderate gene flows from France to the United Kingdom and Denmark, but negligible gene flows to Sweden. Except for gene flows originating from France, and some limited gene flows between Denmark and Sweden in the 1990s, bull and semen exchanges between European countries has been scarce, especially since about 2000. Cow and embryo flows {{have been even more}} scarce. Conversely, the genetic contribution of North American Limousins to European countries has increased since the late 1990s, which has occurred because of their use in breeding programmes to introduce the polled gene.|$|E

30|$|Another {{regression}} model used change in <b>accuracy</b> {{for the three}} spatial tests (fixed effects) and pre-test math <b>accuracy</b> (fixed effect) to predict change in math <b>accuracy.</b> Students’ predicted change in math <b>accuracy</b> was equal to 29.02 [*]−[*] 0.44 (pre-test math accuracy)[*]+[*] 3.10 (gender[*]=[*]male)[*]+[*] 0.06 (change in Make-A-Dice accuracy)[*]+[*] 0.20 (change in Paper Folding accuracy)[*]−[*] 0.02 (change in Purdue Rotations <b>accuracy).</b> Change in Paper Folding <b>accuracy</b> (t[*]=[*] 2.19, p[*]<[*] 0.05) and pre-test math <b>accuracy</b> (t[*]=[*]− 4.83, p[*]<[*] 0.001) were both significant predictors. In a {{regression model}} with only pre-test math <b>accuracy</b> and change in Paper Folding <b>accuracy,</b> students’ predicted change in math <b>accuracy</b> was equal to 29.07 [*]−[*] 0.43 (pre-test math accuracy)[*]+[*] 0.20 (change in Paper Folding <b>accuracy).</b> Change in Paper Folding <b>accuracy</b> (t[*]=[*] 2.43, p[*]<[*] 0.05) and pre-test math <b>accuracy</b> (t[*]=[*]− 5.26, p[*]<[*] 0.001) were both significant predictors.

40|$|Abstract. Domestic CNC {{machine tool}} and NC machine tools abroad's main gap is <b>accuracy</b> {{stabilization}} rather than <b>accuracy.</b> <b>Accuracy</b> stabilization test {{is done on}} some three-axis vertical machining center aiming at the status.

40|$|Since higher spatial {{resolution}} is desired by many applications disciplines coupled with registration in the sub-to- 1 pixel range, improved registration <b>accuracy</b> has become necessary. The trend {{is likely to}} continue, with image data resolution of 10 meters or less being a routine requirement {{before the end of}} this decade. This registration <b>accuracy</b> can only be achieved by the combination of registration and attitude <b>accuracy.</b> This report described the need for improving the attitude <b>accuracy.</b> The relationship between registration <b>accuracy</b> and attitude <b>accuracy</b> is shown, along with criteria for design consideration in establishing adequate attitude <b>accuracy.</b> A precise on-board attitude control system design is essential to provide the attitude <b>accuracy</b> needed to support the subpixel <b>accuracy</b> required for registration of higher resolution images...|$|R

25|$|The {{study of}} metamemory has some {{similarities}} to introspection {{in that it}} assumes that a memorizer is able to investigate and report on the contents of memory.

40|$|A {{large number}} of <b>accuracy</b> {{measures}} for image classification are actually available in the literature for cris classification.

30|$|Furthermore, the {{following}} quality metrics {{are used to}} evaluate the performance of all methods. Overall <b>accuracy</b> (OA) refers to the percentage which is correctly classified over all test samples, average <b>accuracy</b> (AA) shows the average value of classification <b>accuracy</b> for all classes, and Kappa coefficient (κ) is a statistical measurement of producer’s <b>accuracy</b> or user’s <b>accuracy</b> for classification result.|$|R

By comparing the length of the blips, the operator can tell which antenna is more directly pointed at the target. By rotating the antennas towards the stronger signal, the longer blip, the target will be centered and the two blips will become equal length. Even with the relatively long wavelengths used, <b>accuracies</b> on the order of ½ a degree could be attained with these lobe switching systems.|$|E

25|$|The F1AZ was {{developed}} in conjunction with Dassault and the SAAF as a dedicated ground attack variant. The F1AZs were delivered between November 1975 and October 1976 and were assigned to 1 Squadron. Paramount Group, a South African-based company owns the intellectual property for the Mirage F1AZ. The F1AZ has a laser-based rangefinder, permitting the highly accurate fusing and aiming of unguided munitions, such as bombs and rockets. Optical design was by the Optics (later ELOPTRO) division of Armscor in South Africa. Despite their retirement in 1997, {{the accuracy of the}} F1AZ's armament delivery is still considered classified information by the SAAF; analysis by informed news services (e.g., Jane's Defence Weekly) and pilot reports (e.g., Commandant Dick Lord, 'Vlamgat', 1999) conclude that the F1AZ has <b>accuracies</b> within the order disclosed by the USAF for their F-15E Strike Eagle in unguided ballistic mode.|$|E
25|$|Tuning load to gun {{can also}} yield great {{increases}} in accuracy, especially for standard, non-accurized rifles. Different rifles, {{even of the}} same make and model, will often react to the same ammunition in different ways. The handloader is afforded a wider selection of bullet weights than can readily be found in commercially loaded ammunition, {{and there are many}} different powders {{that can be used for}} any given cartridge. Trying a range of bullets and a variety of powders will determine what combination of bullet and powder gives the most consistent velocities and <b>accuracies.</b> Careful adjustment of the amount of powder can give the velocity that best fits the natural harmonics of the barrel (see accurize and internal ballistics). For ultimate accuracy and performance, the handloader also has the option of using a wildcat cartridge; wildcats are the result of shaping the cartridge and chamber themselves to a specific end, and the results push the envelope of velocity, energy, and accuracy. Most, but not all, reloads perform best when the powder selected fills 95% or more of the case (by volume).|$|E
30|$|This work is also {{concerned}} with precisions, {{which is the}} most important factor of this design. As B 9 / 7 DWT structure utilizes floating point coefficients, <b>accuracy</b> in the result mainly depends on the fractional computational values. Hence, the results obtained with normal integer computation units in DWT suffer from poor <b>accuracy.</b> Moreover, the addition of floating point operation units increases the <b>accuracy.</b> On the other hand, it also increases area and delay overhead. Hence, a logarithm-based FPU is integrated along with the DWT structure to achieve a good reduction in area with a higher improvement in <b>accuracy.</b> As the whole model depends on the log values, the <b>accuracy</b> of the log values {{is directly related to the}} <b>accuracy</b> of the result. Furthermore, as std. single precision IEEE 754 has 23 mantissa bits, the <b>accuracy</b> also depends on the correctness of the bits. So, in the experimental phase, the analysis of the <b>accuracy</b> is done by two means: output <b>accuracy</b> and bit level <b>accuracy.</b> As <b>accuracy</b> is mostly discussed in its contrary term, the error rate is taken into consideration when discussing <b>accuracy.</b>|$|R
3000|$|<b>Accuracy</b> {{is defined}} as the {{closeness}} between a data value v and a data value v ^', considered as the correct representation of the real-life phenomenon that the data value v aims to represent. As an example, if the name of a person is John, the value v ^' = John is correct, while the value v = Jhn is incorrect. The world around us changes (velocity is one of the 3 V’s of big data), and what we have referred in the above definition as “the real-life phenomenon that the data value v aims to represent” reflects such changes. So, there is a particular yet relevant type of data <b>accuracy</b> that refers to the rapidity with which the change in real-world phenomenon is reflected in the update to the data value; we call temporal <b>accuracy</b> such type of <b>accuracy,</b> in contrast to structural <b>accuracy</b> (or, simply, <b>accuracy),</b> that characterizes the <b>accuracy</b> of data as observed in a specific time frame, where the data value can be considered stable and unchanged. In the following, we consider first structural <b>accuracy</b> and later temporal <b>accuracy.</b> Two kinds of (structural) <b>accuracy</b> can be identified, namely a syntactic <b>accuracy</b> and a semantic <b>accuracy.</b>|$|R
