5|$|In {{light of}} Ívarr's {{possible}} collusion with Haraldr Guðrøðarson, {{the slaying of}} Rǫgnvaldr Óláfsson may be evidence that the continuing strife between the rival branches descended from the half-brothers, Rǫgnvaldr Guðrøðarson and Óláfr, continued well into the mid thirteenth century. In fact, the killing is the last recorded example of regicide in the Norse-Gaelic realm, and may partly evidence the Europeanisation of the peripheral regions of the British Isles during the twelfth- and thirteenth centuries. As it turned out, the reign of Rǫgnvaldr Óláfsson's successor was short-lived, since Haraldr Guðrøðarson was recalled to Norway in 1250, for having unjustly seized the kingship. Once in Norway, the latter was detained from returning to the Isles, and is not heard of again. Within two years, Rǫgnvaldr Óláfsson's brother, Magnús, was installed in the kingship. The latter reigned {{until his death in}} 1265, and was the last member of the Crovan dynasty to rule as king in the Isles. An <b>after-effect</b> of the inter-dynastic warring within the Crovan dynasty was the partitioning of the kingdom between rival factions. For example, from about 1187 to 1226, and for a brief period in 1229, the kingdom was divided between the half-brothers; and for a brief period in 1230/1231 it was divided between Óláfr and his nephew, Guðrøðr Rögnvaldsson. Although Haraldr Óláfsson appears to have reigned over a united kingdom, the years between his death and the installation of Magnús in 1252 is a murky period indeed, and {{it is possible that the}} kingdom was divided between rival factions during this brief span of years. Rǫgnvaldr Óláfsson was evidently survived by a daughter, Maria. In 1305, a grandson of this woman pursued a claim to Mann.|$|E

40|$|In healthy subjects, {{sensorimotor}} <b>after-effects</b> of prism adaptation {{are known}} to be symmetric (they appear after using leftward and rightward optical deviations), whereas cognitive <b>after-effects</b> are asymmetric (they appear after using a leftward optical deviation) and rightward oriented. Sensorimotor and cognitive <b>after-effects</b> have been classically studied using different specific tasks. The purpose of the current study was to investigate whether both <b>after-effects</b> may be involved in a same visuo-spatial task. Therefore we compared the amplitude of <b>after-effects</b> following adaptation to a rightward or leftward optical deviation. <b>After-effects</b> were assessed by manual pointing or goal oriented locomotor task. The main result showed a greater amplitude for rightward locomotor <b>after-effects</b> (after adaptation to a leftward deviation) than for leftward locomotor <b>after-effects</b> (after adaptation to a rightward deviation). This means that cognitive <b>after-effects</b> may add to sensorimotor <b>after-effects</b> following adaptation to a leftward optical deviation. This asymmetry challenges the classical distinction between sensorimotor and cognitive <b>after-effects</b> of prism adaptation. Implications for the functional mechanisms and the neuroanatomical substrate of prism adaptation are discussed...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe main {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to determine the minimal optical deviation responsible for cognitive <b>after-effects</b> in healthy individuals and to explore whether there was a relationship between the degree of optical deviation and cognitive <b>after-effects.</b> Therefore different leftward optical deviations (8 degrees, 10 degrees and 15 degrees) were used in three different groups of healthy participants. Sensorimotor <b>after-effects</b> (evaluating the visuo-manual realignment) were assessed using an open-loop pointing task and cognitive <b>after-effects</b> (evaluating changes in spatial representation) were assessed using manual and perceptual (landmark) line bisection tasks. Results revealed that exposure to 8 degrees, 10 degrees and 15 degrees optical shifts produced sensorimotor <b>after-effects.</b> In contrast, the occurrence of cognitive <b>after-effects</b> depended on the optical deviation. Adaptation to an 8 degrees leftward optical deviation did not produce cognitive <b>after-effects.</b> Adaptation to a 10 degrees leftward optical deviation was responsible for <b>after-effects</b> in the manual line bisection task only. Adaptation to a 15 degrees leftward optical deviation produced <b>after-effects</b> in both the manual and perceptual line bisection tasks. All cognitive <b>after-effects</b> were rightward and were similar to mild, neglect-like manifestations. Both sensorimotor and cognitive <b>after-effects</b> were correlated with the degree of optical deviation. Our results are of methodological and theoretical interest to those interested in sensorimotor plasticity and spatial cognition...|$|R
40|$|Conditioning {{stimulation}} of dynamic fusimotor axons leaves persistent <b>after-effects</b> which increase {{the responses of}} primary endings to test dynamic stimuli. Such <b>after-effects</b> are abolished by muscle stretch. Destruction of these <b>after-effects</b> depends on the following. (a) Amplitude of stretch: with symmetrical triangular stretches of moderate velocity, an extension of soleus by 4 - 5 mm totally abolishes the <b>after-effects.</b> Lesser stretches cause a graded reduction. (b) Velocity of relaxation: for a given amplitude of stretch there is greater destruction of <b>after-effects</b> when it {{is followed by a}} slow rate of relaxation than after rapid relaxation. (c) <b>After-effects</b> tested late in ramp stretch are more resistant to destruction by stretch than those increasing test dynamic responses early in ramp stretch. Stretch itself produces <b>after-effects</b> which enhance test responses to dynamic but not to static fusimotor stimulation. Interactions between conditioning dynamic stimulation and stretch suggest that both these effects occur in the same intrafusal elements, the bag fibres...|$|R

40|$|Transcranial {{alternating}} current stimulation {{is a novel}} method that allows application of sinusoidal currents to modulate brain oscillations and cognitive processes. Studies in humans have demonstrated tACS <b>after-effects</b> following stimulation durations {{in the range of}} minutes. However, such <b>after-effects</b> are absent in animal studies using much shorter stimulation protocols in the range of seconds. Thus, stimulation duration might be a critical parameter for <b>after-effects</b> to occur. To test this hypothesis, we repeated a recent human tACS experiment with a short duration. We applied alpha tACS intermittently for one second duration while keeping other parameters identical. The results demonstrate that this very short intermittent protocol did not produce <b>after-effects</b> on amplitude or phase of the electroencephalogram. Since synaptic plasticity has been suggested as a possible mechanism for <b>after-effects,</b> our results indicate that a stimulation duration of one second is too short to induce synaptic plasticity. Future studies in animals are required that use extended stimulation durations to reveal the neuronal underpinnings.

40|$|In this letter, we {{experimentally}} {{validate the}} ability of a recently developed ferromagnetic hysteresis model to characterize magnetic <b>after-effects</b> in ferromagnetic materials. The modeling framework, which combines energy analysis at the lattice level with stochastic homogenization techniques to accommodate material, stress and field nonhomogeneities, quantifies <b>after-effects</b> through a balance of the Gibbs and relative thermal energies. Attributes of the framework are illustrated through fits to experimental steel data. Magnetic <b>after-effects</b> due to either thermally-induced switching or atomic diffusion produce drift or creep in the magnetization or induction for a number of operating regimes [1; 2]. Quantification of these effects is important both for accurate material characterization and the design of sensors and actuators required to achieve and maintain highly accurate tolerances. In a recently developed framework for quantifying hysteresis inherent to ferromagnetic materials, magnetic <b>after-effects</b> are incorporated by balancing the Gibbs and relative thermal energies at the lattice level using Boltzmann principles. The effects of polycrystallinity, material nonhomogeneities, and variable interaction fields are subsequently incorporated by assuming that local coercive and interaction fields are manifestations of underlying distributions rather than constant coefficients. The development of this framework is provided in [3 – 5]. Experimental validation for operating regimes in which magnetic <b>after-effects</b> are negligible are also provided in therein. In this letter, we illustrate {{the ability of}} the model to quantify <b>after-effects</b> through fits of experimental steel data.
