5|$|With {{a minimum}} {{alveolar}} concentration (MAC) of 0.16%, methoxyflurane {{is an extremely}} potent <b>anesthetic</b> agent. It is a powerful analgesic agent at well below full <b>anesthetic</b> concentrations. Because of its low volatility and very high boiling point (104.8°C at 1atmosphere), methoxyflurane has a low vapor pressure at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure. It is therefore quite difficult to vaporize methoxyflurane using conventional <b>anesthetic</b> vaporizers.|$|E
5|$|Methoxyflurane is an {{extremely}} potent and highly lipid-soluble <b>anesthetic</b> agent, characterized by very slow induction (onset of action) and emergence (offset or dissipation) times. It is non-flammable, has relatively mild hemodynamic effects, {{and it does not}} predispose the heart to rhythm disturbances. It is, however, a significant respiratory depressant. Methoxyflurane has powerful analgesic (pain-relieving) properties at well below full <b>anesthetic</b> doses. It was utilized in self-administration devices for obstetric analgesia, in a manner that foreshadowed the patient-controlled analgesia infusion pumps of today.|$|E
5|$|The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health {{maintains}} a recommended exposure limit for methoxyflurane as waste <b>anesthetic</b> gas of 2 ppm (13.5mg/m3) over 60 minutes.|$|E

5|$|When inhaled at high partial {{pressures}} (more {{than about}} 4 bar, encountered at depths below about 30m in scuba diving), nitrogen is an <b>anesthetic</b> agent, causing nitrogen narcosis, a temporary state of mental impairment similar to nitrous oxide intoxication.|$|E

40|$|General <b>anesthetics</b> are {{indispensable}} for effective clinical care. Although, {{the mechanism of}} action of general <b>anesthetics</b> remains controversial, lipid bilayers and proteins have been discussed as their targets. In this study, we focused {{on the relationship between}} cellular ATP levels and general <b>anesthetics.</b> The ATP levels of nematodes and cultured mammalian cells were decreased by exposure to three general anesthetics: isoflurane, pentobarbital, and 1 -phenoxy- 2 -propanol. Furthermore, these general <b>anesthetics</b> abolished mitochondrial membrane potential, resulting in the inhibition of mitochondrial ATP synthesis. These results suggest that the observed decrease of cellular ATP level is a common phenomenon of general <b>anesthetics...</b>|$|R

5|$|Xenon {{has been}} used as a general <b>anesthetic.</b> Although it is expensive, {{anesthesia}} machines that can deliver xenon are expected to appear on the European market because advances in recovery and recycling of xenon have made it economically viable.|$|E
5|$|Although xenon has {{potential}} {{for use in}} computed tomography (CT) to assess regional ventilation, its <b>anesthetic</b> properties limit its fraction in the breathing gas to 35%. A breathing mixture of 30% xenon and 30% krypton is comparable in effectiveness for CT to a 40% xenon fraction, while avoiding the unwanted effects of a high partial pressure of xenon gas.|$|E

5|$|In {{a series}} of 500 {{consecutive}} obstetric patients, Boisvert and Hudon observed vomiting in 12 (4.8%) patients during or after administration of methoxyflurane anesthesia. These findings compared favorably with those reported for cyclopropane (42%), trichloroethylene (28%) and halothane (4.6%). In another study of 645 obstetric patients, Romagnoli and Korman observed 8 cases (1.2%) of postoperative vomiting, {{one of whom was}} retching before the administration of the <b>anesthetic.</b>|$|E
5|$|Local {{trauma is}} also {{associated}} with aphthous stomatitis, and {{it is known that}} trauma can decrease the mucosal barrier.

5|$|Methoxyflurane (INN), {{formerly}} {{marketed as}} Penthrane by Abbott Laboratories, is a halogenated ether {{that was in}} clinical use as a volatile inhalational <b>anesthetic</b> from its introduction by Joseph F.

40|$|Local <b>anesthetics</b> are {{the most}} {{commonly}} used drugs in dentistry. This thesis provides an up-to-date summary of pharmacology and of the clinical applications of local <b>anesthetics</b> in stomatology.

Finally, the thesis outlines new trends in the development of local anesthesia...|$|R
40|$|Volatile <b>anesthetics</b> {{have been}} in {{clinical}} use {{for a long period}} of time and are considered to be promiscuous by presumably interacting with several ion channels in the central nervous system to produce anesthesia. Because ion channels and their existing evolutionary analogues, ion transporters, are very important in various organisms, it is possible that volatile <b>anesthetics</b> may affect some bacteria. In this study, we hypothesized that volatile <b>anesthetics</b> could affect bacterial behaviors. We evaluated the impact of <b>anesthetics</b> on bacterial growth, motility (swimming and gliding) and biofilm formation of four common bacterial pathogens in vitro. We found that commonly used volatile <b>anesthetics</b> isoflurane and sevoflurane affected bacterial motility and biofilm formation without any effect on growth of the common bacterial pathogens studied here. Using available Escherichia coli gene deletion mutants of ion transporters and in silico molecular docking, we suggested that these altered behaviors might be at least partly via the interaction of volatile <b>anesthetics</b> with ion transporters...|$|R
40|$|Using a {{recently}} developed in vitro motility assay, we {{have demonstrated that}} local <b>anesthetics</b> directly inhibit myosin-based movement of single actin filaments in a reversible dose-dependent manner. This is the first reported account {{of the actions of}} local <b>anesthetics</b> on purified proteins at the molecular level. In this study, two tertiary amine local <b>anesthetics,</b> lidocaine and tetracaine, were used. The inhibitory action of the local <b>anesthetics</b> on actomyosin sliding movement was pH dependent; the <b>anesthetics</b> were more potent at higher pH values, and this reaction was accompanied by an increased proportion of the uncharged form of the <b>anesthetics.</b> QX- 314, a permanently charged derivative of lidocaine, had no effect on actomyosin sliding movement. These results indicate that the uncharged form of local <b>anesthetics</b> is predominantly responsible for the inhibition of actomyosin sliding movement. The local <b>anesthetics</b> inhibited sliding movement but hardly interfered with the binding of actin filaments to myosin on the surface or with actomyosin ATPase activity at low ionic strength. To characterize the actomyosin interaction in the presence of <b>anesthetics,</b> we measured the binding and breaking force of the actomyosin complex. The binding of actin filaments to myosin on the surface was not affected by lidocaine at low ionic strength. The breaking force, measured using optical tweezers, was approximately 1. 5 pN per micron of an actin filament, which was much smaller than in rigor and isometric force. The binding and breaking force greatly decreased with increasing ionic strength, indicating that the remaining interaction is ionic in nature. The result suggests that the binding and ATPase of actomyosin are governed predominantly by ionic interaction, which is hardly affected by anesthetics; whereas the force generation requires hydrophobic interaction, which plays {{a major part of the}} strong binding and is blocked by <b>anesthetics,</b> in addition to the ionic interaction...|$|R
5|$|Narcosis {{results from}} {{breathing}} gases under elevated pressure, {{and may be}} classified by the principal gas involved. The noble gases, except helium and probably neon, as well as nitrogen, oxygen and hydrogen cause a decrement in mental function, but their effect on psychomotor function (processes affecting the coordination of sensory or cognitive processes and motor activity) varies widely. The effects of carbon dioxide consistently result in a diminution of mental and psychomotor function. The noble gases argon, krypton, and xenon are more narcotic than nitrogen at a given pressure, and xenon has so much <b>anesthetic</b> activity {{that it is a}} usable <b>anesthetic</b> at 80% concentration and normal atmospheric pressure. Xenon has historically been too expensive to be used very much in practice, but it has been successfully used for surgical operations, and xenon anesthesia systems are still being proposed and designed.|$|E

5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} common {{indication}} for tracheal intubation is for the placement of a conduit through which nitrous oxide or volatile anesthetics may be administered. General <b>anesthetic</b> agents, opioids, and neuromuscular-blocking drugs may diminish or even abolish the respiratory drive.

5|$|The {{biodegradation}} of methoxyflurane produces {{inorganic fluoride}} and dichloroacetic acid (DCAA). The combined {{effects of these}} two compounds {{may be responsible for}} the toxicity of methoxyflurane to some of the major organs of the human body. Methoxyflurane was determined to be nephrotoxic (damaging to the kidneys) in a dose-dependent response and hepatotoxic (damaging to the liver) at <b>anesthetic</b> doses in 1973, and the drug was abandoned as a general <b>anesthetic</b> in the late 1970s. In 1999, the manufacturer discontinued distribution of methoxyflurane in the United States and Canada, and on September 6, 2005, the Food and Drug Administration determined that it should be withdrawn from the market for safety concerns. It is however still used in Australia as an emergency analgesic for the initial management of pain due to acute trauma, as well as for brief painful procedures such as changing of wound dressings or for transport of injured people.|$|E
5|$|The {{condition}} {{is difficult to}} treat, and may involve fillings, fluoride to fight tooth decay and drugs that increase saliva for dry mouth, as well as oral hygiene instruction.

5|$|Xenon has {{a minimum}} {{alveolar}} concentration (MAC) of 72% at age 40, making it 44% more potent than N2O as an <b>anesthetic.</b> Thus, {{it can be}} used with oxygen in concentrations that have a lower risk of hypoxia. Unlike nitrous oxide (N2O), xenon is not a greenhouse gas and is viewed as environmentally friendly. Though recycled in modern systems, xenon vented to the atmosphere is only returning to its original source, without environmental impact.|$|E
40|$|Local <b>anesthetics</b> {{have been}} used {{clinically}} {{for more than a}} century, but new insights into their mechanisms of action and their interaction with biological systems continue to surprise researchers and clinicians alike. Next to their classic action on voltage-gated sodium channels, local <b>anesthetics</b> interact with calcium, potassium, and hyperpolarization-gated ion channels, ligand-gated channels, and G protein-coupled receptors. They activate numerous downstream pathways in neurons, and affect the structure and function of many types of membranes. Local <b>anesthetics</b> must traverse several tissue barriers to reach their site of action on neuronal membranes. In particular, the perineurium is a major rate-limiting step. Allergy to local <b>anesthetics</b> is rare, while the variation in individual patient's response to local <b>anesthetics</b> is probably larger than previously assumed. Several adjuncts are available to prolong sensory block, but these typically also prolong motor block. The 2 main research avenues being followed to improve action of local <b>anesthetics</b> are to prolong duration of block, by slow-release formulations and on-demand release, and to develop compounds and combinations that elicit a nociception-selective blockad...|$|R
