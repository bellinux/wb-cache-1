50|$|<b>Alanosine</b> (also called SDX-102) is a {{substance}} that is being studied {{for the treatment of}} pancreatic cancer. It is an antimetabolite. It is used as one of a few experimental treatments for patients with deadly pancreatic cancer when the main chemotherapeutic treatment regimen of gemcitabine is no longer useful.|$|E
40|$|Adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) (EC 2. 4. 2. 7) pseudorevertant {{cell lines}} were {{isolated}} under selective conditions requiring adenine salvage for survival; {{yet they were}} found to be deficient in measurable APRT activity and resistant to the purine analog 2 ' 6 '-diaminopurine (DAP) (M. S. Turker, J. A. Tischfield, P. Rabinovitch, P. J. Stambrook, J. J. Trill, A. C. Smith, C. E. Ogburn, and G. M. Martin, manuscript in preparation). Adenine salvage was examined in two APRT pseudorevertant cell lines, their two APRT homozygous deficient parental cell lines, and a genotypic APRT revertant cell line (i. e., one with measurable APRT activity and DAP sensitivity). Adenine accumulation was observed in both revertant phenotypes and was demonstrated by high-performance liquid chromatography to be linked with adenine metabolism. The ability to salvage adenine declined substantially in the pseudorevertant cell lines when they were removed from selective media containing inhibitors of de novo 5 '-AMP synthesis (<b>alanosine</b> and azaserine); for one pseudorevertant cell line this decline was accelerated by the addition of DAP to the medium. The readdition of <b>alanosine</b> or azaserine to the growth medium of the pseudorevertant lines induced adenine salvage to its previous levels. An APRT-like cross-reacting material was found in the pseudorevertant cell lines, although its relationship to adenine salvage is unknown. A low level of constitutive adenine salvage was found in the parental APRT-deficient lines, and it was also possible to induce adenine salvage in these cell lines. These findings suggest a novel regulatory mechanism for adenine salvage...|$|E
40|$|A {{system that}} selects for the gene {{directing}} {{synthesis of the}} enzyme adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) uses the antibiotic <b>alanosine</b> to prevent endogenous synthesis of adenylic acid. With the aid of this system, {{a new series of}} human-mouse hybrids has been prepared between wild type human diploid fibroblasts and an enzyme-deficient mouse line. Survival of the hybrids depended upon the presence of the APRT, which was shown to have the isoelectric pH characteristic of the human enzyme and not that of the mouse. Reduced hybrids containing the enzyme lacked all human biarmed chromosomes, so that unless a rearrangement had occurred, the aprt gene must be located on an acrocentric chromosome. The hybrid cells became APRT- with a frequency of 2 Ã— 10 - 3, probably by loss of the human aprt chromosome. The APRT- progeny could be obtained selectively by growth in medium containing fluoroadenine...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} mouse-human hybrids was {{prepared}} from mouse cells deficient in adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2. 4. 2. 7) and normal human cells. The hybrids {{were made in}} medium containing adenine and <b>alanosine,</b> an antimetabolite known to inhibit de novo adenylic acid biosynthesis. The mouse cells, unable to utilize exogenous adenine, were killed in this medium, but the hybrids proliferated {{as a consequence of}} their retaining the human aprt gene. The hybrids were then exposed to the adenine analogs 2, 6 -diaminopurine and 2 -fluoroadenine to select for cells that had lost this gene. Before exposure to the adenine analogs, the expression of human adenine phosphoribosyltransferase by the hybrids was strongly associated only with the presence of human chromosome 16, and afterwards this was the only human chromosome consistently lost. This observation suggests that the human aprt gene can be assigned to chromosome 16...|$|E
40|$|Human-mouse {{somatic cell}} hybrids were made between adenine phosphoribosyltransferase-deficient mouse L cells and {{a strain of}} human primary {{fibroblasts}} and selected in medium containing <b>alanosine</b> and adenine (J. A. Tischfield and F. H. Ruddle, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 71 : 45 - 49, 1974). These hybrids were tested for the generation of defective interfering (DI) particles of vesicular stomatitis virus {{to determine whether or}} not a host gene controls the induction of DI particles. None of the seven independently arising hybrid clones tested generated detectable DI particles during 13 successive undiluted passages. In addition, the parental human cells also failed to generate DI particles. In contrast, the parental mouse cells generated a detectable level of DI particles during continuous passage. Thus, failure to generate DI particles appears to act in a dominant fashion in these hybrids. Human chromosome 16 and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase were present, as a direct consequence of the selection system, in all of the hybrid clones that failed to generate DI particles. It was the only human chromosome observed in the cells of every hybrid clone. This was verified by both isozyme and karyotype analyses. After hybrids were back-selected (with 2, 6 -diaminopurine) for loss of human adenine phosphoribosyltransferase and chromosome 16, they gained the ability to generate DI particles. Replication of DI particles already present in virus stocks, however, was normal in all of the hybrid clones and the parental human cells. This suggests that the induction, but not the replication, of DI particles is affected by the human genome and that a factor on human chromosome 16 seems to selectively suppress the mouse cell's ability to generate DI particles in the hybrids. These results support the idea that the induction of DI particles is controlled in part by host cell function(s), as suggested previously (C. Y. Kang and R. Allen, J. Virol. 25 : 202 - 206, 1978) ...|$|E
