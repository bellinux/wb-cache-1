5|$|Australia {{opted to}} field an {{unchanged}} {{team for the}} Second Test at Lord's and elected to bat first after winning the toss. Johnson came in at 5/216 on the first afternoon <b>and</b> <b>struggled</b> to score, making only four of the 30 runs added during his stay at the crease before falling at 7/246, caught behind from the bowling of Bill Edrich. However, Australia's lower order wagged and they eventually took the score to 350 on the second morning.|$|E
5|$|Clippard earned $4million in 2013. He had a 6–3 {{record with}} a 2.41 ERA and 73 strikeouts in 71 innings pitched. Clippard and the Nationals agreed on a $5.875million salary for the 2014 season. He {{appeared}} in 20 of the Nationals' first 40 games, <b>and</b> <b>struggled</b> with poor command of his pitches. His command improved as his workload decreased, and he {{was named to the}} appear in the 2014 All-Star Game. He ended the season with a 2.18 ERA, and led MLB with 40 holds.|$|E
5|$|Rathbone {{jumped from}} his seat <b>and</b> <b>struggled</b> with Booth, who dropped the pistol and drew a knife, then stabbed Rathbone in the left forearm. Rathbone again grabbed at Booth as Booth {{prepared}} to jump from the box to the stage, a twelve-foot drop; Booth's riding spur became entangled on the Treasury flag decorating the box, and he landed awkwardly on his left foot. As he began crossing the stage, many in the audience thought {{he was part of}} the play.|$|E

5|$|The pre-game buildup was {{primarily}} {{focused on the}} rematch. A slight plurality of experts picked Tulsa over Iowa State, but most predicted the game to be very close. Tulsa was considered a strong running team with a solid defense, while Iowa State was balanced offensively <b>and</b> <b>struggled</b> at times on defense. This was the only rematch of the 2012-13 college bowl season.|$|E
5|$|After the Treaties of Tilsit of July 1807 Metternich {{saw that}} Austria's {{position}} in Europe {{was much more}} vulnerable but believed the accord between Russia and France would not last. In the meantime he found the new French Foreign Minister, Jean-Baptiste Champagny unaccommodating <b>and</b> <b>struggled</b> to negotiate a satisfactory settlement {{over the future of}} several French forts on the River Inn. Over the following months the reach of Austrian policy, and Metternich's own reputation, increased. Metternich pushed for a Russo-Austrian alliance, though Tsar Alexander was too preoccupied with the three other wars he was engaged in to commit. Over time, Metternich came to see an eventual war with France as inevitable.|$|E
5|$|Besides Big K.R.I.T. and Ashthon Jones, {{the album}} also {{features}} appearances by The Voice finalist Mathai, Mali Music, and Reach Records artists Trip Lee and Tedashii. On working with Big K.R.I.T., Lecrae stated to Billboard that K.R.I.T. had already {{reached out to}} him before the collaboration to show his appreciation for Lecrae's honesty. In an interview with AllHipHop, Lecrae mentioned that both he and Big K.R.I.T. have similar backgrounds, having both {{grown up in the}} Southern United States <b>and</b> <b>struggled</b> with religion under the influence of a religious grandmother.|$|E

5|$|Convinced {{that these}} heavy-handed tactics were {{the source of}} the {{alienation}} of the native population to Soviet rule, in 1921 Moscow appointed an experienced administrator, Alexander Miasnikian, to carry out a more moderate policy and one better attuned to Armenian sensibilities. With the introduction of the New Economic Policy (NEP), Armenians began to enjoy a period of relative stability. Life under the Soviet rule proved to be a soothing balm in contrast to the turbulent final years of the Ottoman Empire. The Armenians received medicine, food, as well as other provisions from the central government and extensive literacy reforms were carried out. The situation was difficult for the Armenian Apostolic Church, however, which became a regular target of criticism in educational books and in the media <b>and</b> <b>struggled</b> greatly under Communism.|$|E
5|$|Edwin's {{defeat and}} death caused his kingdom to {{fragment}} into {{at least two}} parts. It also led to {{a sharp decline in}} Christianity in Northumbria when Edwin's immediate successors reverted to paganism. Although Paulinus' deacon, James, remained in the north <b>and</b> <b>struggled</b> to rebuild the Roman mission, Edwin's widow decided to return to Kent. Paulinus went with her, taking Edwin and Æthelburg's son and daughter, as well as one of Edwin's grandsons. The two boys went to the continent for safety, to the court of King Dagobert I. Æthelburg, Eanflæd, and Paulinus remained in Kent, where Paulinus was offered the see, or bishopric, of Rochester, which he held until his death. Because the pallium did not reach Paulinus until after he had left York, it was of no use to him.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, {{a sequel}} for the Nintendo 64, Mother 3 (EarthBound 64 in North America), was announced. It was slated for release on the 64DD, a disk drive {{expansion}} peripheral for the Nintendo 64. Itoi's expansive ideas during development led the development team {{to question whether}} fans would still consider the game part of the series. The game entered development hell <b>and</b> <b>struggled</b> to find a firm release date and in 2000, despite its level of completion, was later cancelled altogether with the commercial failure of the 64DD.|$|E

5|$|In Southeast Asia and Indonesia, male {{long hair}} was valued in until the seventeenth century, when the area adopted outside {{influences}} including Islam and Christianity. Invading cultures enforced shorter hairstyles on men {{as a sign}} of servitude, as well. They were also confused at the short hairstyles among women in certain areas, such as Thailand, <b>and</b> <b>struggled</b> to explain why women in the area had such short hair. They came up with several mythical stories, one of which involved a king who found a long hair in his rice and, in a rage, demanded that all women keep their hair short.|$|E
5|$|Manchester United, {{the holders}} of the FA Cup, began their defence of the trophy {{with a home}} tie against non-league Exeter City. United had made several first team changes <b>and</b> <b>struggled</b> to find a {{breakthrough}} in the tie. Even with the second half introductions of Paul Scholes and Cristiano Ronaldo, the visitors held on for a goalless draw. The match was replayed at Exeter's home ground, St James Park on 19 January 2005. Ronaldo scored the opening goal of the match in the ninth minute and Wayne Rooney added a second, three minutes from normal time.|$|E
5|$|Reimer {{began the}} 2011–12 {{season as the}} starter going 4–0–1. He {{suffered}} an injury on October 22 {{in a game against}} the Montreal Canadiens. During the game Reimer was run into by Brian Gionta, he finished the first period, but did not return after the intermission. The team called the injury whiplash despite rumors that he was suffering from a concussion. Reimer missed 19 games with the injury, <b>and</b> <b>struggled</b> upon his return, yielding some starts to Gustavsson. After recording two back-to-back shutouts on February 1 and February 4, Reimer seemed to have solidified the starting position once again.|$|E

5|$|The Transitional Federal Government, {{formed in}} 2004, was {{recognized}} as the central government of Somalia. Before December 2006, the TFG controlled only the town of Baidoa, the sixth largest city. The intervention of Ethiopian government forces following {{the rise of the}} Islamic Courts Union, culminating in the latter's defeat in the Battle of Baidoa, allowed the TFG to expand its control under the protection of Ethiopian troops. The TFG was at the time not able to effectively collect taxes, had no notable finances or real power base, <b>and</b> <b>struggled</b> to exert control over Mogadishu following an attempted move in late December 2006. However, the TFG later succeeded in capturing most of Somalia from insurgents, but struggled to cement its control and establish law and order.|$|E
5|$|The period {{encompasses}} {{the careers of}} quarterback Phil Simms and linebacker Lawrence Taylor, {{two of the most}} accomplished players in team history. Simms was drafted to little fanfare from tiny Morehead State University in 1979, <b>and</b> <b>struggled</b> in his initial seasons before becoming a Pro Bowl quarterback. Taylor was the second selection in the 1981 NFL Draft and, in contrast to Simms, was an immediate success, winning the league's Defensive Player of the Year Award as a rookie. The team's success in this period was aided by head coach Bill Parcells, running back Joe Morris, and Hall of Fame linebacker Harry Carson. Following the 1990 season and a victory in Super Bowl XXV, Parcells resigned as coach and was replaced by the team's offensive coordinator, Ray Handley.|$|E
5|$|The {{start of}} the 2010–11 season was {{disrupted}} due to damage caused to the Portway Stadium pitch by rabbits, leading {{to a number of}} home league games being postponed. An FA Cup match against Chertsey Town was played at Whitchurch United's Longmeadow Ground, and their FA Trophy match against Bideford was played at Winchester City's Denplan City Ground. The Lions were unable to recover <b>and</b> <b>struggled</b> throughout the season, failing to win a single home game and finishing bottom of the division with eleven points after conceding more than 100 goals. However, the club avoided relegation due to the resignation of Almondsbury Town F.C. earlier in the season.|$|E

5|$|This growth {{spurred the}} {{reorganisation}} of {{the governance of}} the town. Prior to 1818, the town was run by a mixture of bodies. The Sheffield Town Trust and the Church Burgesses, for example, divided responsibility {{for the improvement of}} streets and bridges. By the 19th century both organisations lacked funds <b>and</b> <b>struggled</b> even to maintain existing infrastructure. The Church Burgesses organised a public meeting on 27 May 1805 and proposed to apply to Parliament for an act to pave, light and clean the city's streets. The proposal was defeated.|$|E
5|$|This policy, {{known as}} malgachization, {{coincided with a}} severe {{economic}} downturn and a dramatic decline {{in the quality of}} education. Those schooled during this period generally failed to master the French language or many other subjects <b>and</b> <b>struggled</b> to find employment, forcing many to take low-paying jobs in the informal or black market that mired them in deepening poverty. Excepting the brief presidency of Albert Zafy, from 1992 to 1996, Ratsiraka remained in power from 1975 to 2001 and failed to achieve significant improvements in education throughout his tenure.|$|E
5|$|Under the 2006 pyramid reorganisations, a third-place {{finish in}} the Wessex League {{was good enough for}} {{promotion}} back to the Southern League, along with local rivals Winchester City and Thatcham Town. In their first season back, they finished in ninth place, just five points from the divisional playoffs. They were unable to build on this <b>and</b> <b>struggled</b> to a nineteenth-place {{finish in the}} following season, ultimately finishing 29points above relegation after Slough Town were reprieved following Halifax Town's expulsion from the Football Conference. Andover's home match against Uxbridge, played towards the end of that season, was the club's thousandth game in the Southern League.|$|E
