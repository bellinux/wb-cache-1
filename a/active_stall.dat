40|$|The {{modelling}} and {{simulation of}} wind turbines {{is becoming more}} important as the penetration levels of wind turbines are increasing. This means that the effects {{the various types of}} wind turbines have on electrical grids and possible ways to control power output quality should be understood in order to facilitate wind energy expansion and to ensure minimal negative effects on local and wider area grids. Chapter 2 provides a literature review of the current research related to constant speed turbines (both passive and <b>active</b> <b>stall)</b> and the variable speed DFIG turbine. Although the latter is not examined further in this thesis, it is mentioned to provide a point of comparison with the constant speed technology. The literature review also enabled to results of previous simulation and the results of this thesis to be successfully validated. The Chapter 3 deals with the constant speed turbine as a steady state simulation. The steady state simulation showed that the chosen turbine characteristic would have a power generation design point of 2 MW, and was designed for optimum output at an average wind velocity of 15 m/s. The steady state simulations also showed that effect a change in frequency would have on the power output. Comparing the simulations of the passive stall of Chapter 4 and the <b>active</b> <b>stall</b> control of Chapter 5 it was shown that with the addition of pitch control there was still a significant overshoot of design output power of 0. 06 - 0. 08 p. u, along with a high frequency variation of 0. 05 p. u. While the pitch actuators were engaged, this did not provide any significant reduction in design point overshoot or turbine behaviour The advantage of the <b>active</b> <b>stall</b> control was explored in Chapter 6, demonstrating the <b>active</b> <b>stall</b> control turbine can be used successfully in providing primary, secondary and high frequency support.

40|$|Abstract-The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to assess 10 MW direct-drive permanent-magnet (DDPM) generator systems with different control strategies namely pitch control and <b>active</b> speed <b>stall</b> control. In the <b>active</b> speed <b>stall</b> control concept, there is no pitch mechanism, and the rotor speed is actively controlled by the generator to control the output power. The <b>active</b> speed <b>stall</b> control wind turbine with the DDPM generator system may be an attractive concept especially for offshore. This turbine has high potential because the wear, the maintenance and the failures of the pitch mechanism and the gearbox are omitted. The different DDPM generator systems are designed roughly, and the dimensions, weights, cost and performance of the systems are compared.

40|$|Abstract-The {{objectives}} {{of this paper}} are to investigate the feasibility of a 10 MW generator for a direct-drive wind turbine and to compare the generator systems for pitch control and for <b>active</b> speed <b>stall</b> control. The idea behind the <b>active</b> speed <b>stall</b> control concept {{is to make a}} rotor that is as simple as possible, and therefore very robust and suitable for offshore wind turbines. This is done by removing the pitch control of the blades. Above rated wind speed, the power is not controlled by controlling the pitch, but by controlling the rotor speed: the rotor speed is so much reduced that the aerodynamic power is limited to the rated value. A rough 10 MW permanent-magnet direct-drive generator design is presented, indicating that such a generator is feasible. It is shown that for a thorough evaluation of <b>active</b> speed <b>stall</b> control, more knowledge is required about changes in the wind speed. However, a considerable increase in generator system cost is necessary to enable <b>active</b> speed <b>stall</b> control.

40|$|<b>Active</b> <b>stall</b> {{control is}} a current {{research}} area at the NASA Glenn Research Center that offers a great benefit in specific fuel consumption by allowing the gas turbine to operate beyond the onset of stall. Magnetic bearings are being investigated as a new method to perform <b>active</b> <b>stall</b> control. This enabling global aviation safety technology would result in improved fuel efficiency and decreased carbon dioxide emissions, as well as improve safety and reliability by eliminating oil-related delays and failures of engine components, which account for 40 percent of the commercial aircraft departure delays. <b>Active</b> <b>stall</b> control works by perturbing the flow {{in front of the}} compressor stage such that it cancels the pressure wave, which causes the compressor to go into stall. Radial magnetic bearings are able to whirl the shaft so that variations in blade tip leakage would flow upstream causing a perturbation wave that could cancel the rotating stall cell. Axial or thrust magnetic bearings cannot be used to cancel the surge mode in the compressor because they have a very low bandwidth and thus cannot modulate at a high enough frequency. Frequency response is limited because the thrust runner cannot be laminated. To improve the bandwidth of magnetic thrust bearings, researchers must use laminations to suppress the eddy currents. A conical magnetic bearing can be laminated, resulting in increased bandwidth in the axial direction. In addition, this design can produce both radial and thrust force in a single bearing, simplifying the installation. The proposed solution combines the radial and thrust bearing into one design that can be laminated [...] a conical magnetic bearing. The new conical magnetic bearing test rig, funded by a Glenn fiscal year 2002 Director's Discretionary Fund, was needed because none of the existing rigs has an axial degree of freedom. The rotor bearing configuration will simulate that of the main shaft on a gas turbine engine. One conical magnetic bearing replaces the ball bearing in front of the compressor, and the second replaces the roller bearing behind the burner. The rig was made operational to 10, 000 rpm under Smart Efficient Components funding, and both position and current adaptive vibration control have been demonstrated. Upon program completion, recommendations will be made as to the efficacy of the conical magnetic bearing for <b>active</b> <b>stall</b> control...|$|E

As rotor blades are not pitchable, control is ensured by variable-speed operation in order to limit harvested power in high winds and to maximise it at low winds. Turbine power regulation is achieved through <b>active</b> speed <b>stall</b> control, which supposes operation at low rotational speed values. In this way, operation within admissible limits of rotational speed and torque is also ensured. A unique power controller is designed, with classical proportional-integral (PI) structure and switched parameters and references.

Switching is performed in an operating point where power controller output is sufficiently deep in saturation and the antiwindup structure is active.

40|$|While under {{conditions}} of stress, non-dividing cells may acquire beneficial mutations. This {{is referred to as}} stationary phase mutagenesis, or adaptive mutagenesis. Previous research has shown that actively transcribed genes and those under selective pressure are prone to mutations that confer escape from non-dividing conditions. Accordingly, strains lacking transcription factors have shown a drastically lower number of mutations that confer escape while under amino acid starvation than those observed in the wildtype background. Also, error-prone DNA polymerases are known to be active in cells under stress and {{it has been shown that}} strains lacking an error-prone DNA polymerase display reduced levels of stationary phase mutagenesis. It is possible to speculate that when <b>active</b> transcription <b>stalls,</b> perhaps due to pre-mutagenic lesions in the template DNA strand, error-prone polymerases are recruited to the site of stalled transcription as part of DNA repair processes. This interaction between transcription and DNA repair is likely to bias the accumulation of mutations at highly transcribed loci. This model may be tested with strains carrying deficiencies in Mfd (transcription factor), YqjH (error-prone DNA polymerase), or both. We expect the double-knockout strain to show a similar level of mutagenesis to those observed in strains carrying only one deficiency, and lower levels compared to those in the wildtype. Alternatively, if these factors influence mutation separately, a double-knockout should show even lower accumulation of adaptive mutants than either the Mfd- or YqjH-.

40|$|A {{systematic}} blade {{design study}} was conducted to explore the trade-offs in using low-lift airfoils for a 750 -kilowatt stall-regulated wind turbine. Tip-region airfoils having a maximum lift coefficient ranging from 0. 7 - 1. 2 were considered in this study, with the main objective of identifying the practical lower limit for the maximum lift coefficient. Blades were optimized for both maximum annual energy production and minimum cost of energy using a method that takes into account aerodynamic and structural considerations. The results indicate that reducing the maximum lift coefficient below the upper limit considered in this study increases the cost of energy independently of the wind regime. As a consequence, higher maximum lift coefficient airfoils for the tip-region of the blade become more desirable as machine size increases, as long as they provide gentle stall characteristics. The conclusions are applicable to large wind turbines that use passive or <b>active</b> <b>stall</b> to regulate peak power...|$|E

The method uses grid-status information to initialise the grid-connected wind turbine model. The goal is to start a power-system simulation in a stationary state, without unnecessary transient behaviour {{at the beginning of}} the simulation. Correct initialisation is necessary to reach quickly the steady state of the grid-connected wind turbine, before a real transient on the grid occurs. Consequently, the dynamic performance of the system can be independently and accurately evaluated.

However, instructive factors involved are poorly understood, except for involvement of low transcription and trimethylation of histone H 3 lysine 27 (H 3 K 27 me 3). Here, we used methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) combined with a CGI oligonucleotide microarray analysis, and identified 5510 and 521 genes with promoter CGIs resistant and susceptible, respectively, to DNA methylation in prostate cancer cell lines. Expression analysis revealed that the susceptible genes had low transcription in a normal prostatic epithelial cell line. Chromatin immunoprecipitation with microarray hybridization (CHiP-chip) analysis of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and histone modifications showed that, even among the genes with low transcription, the presence of Pol II was associated with marked resistance to DNA methylation (OR = 0. 22; 95 % CI = 0. 12 – 0. 38), and H 3 K 27 me 3 was associated with increased susceptibility (OR = 11. 20; 95 % CI = 7. 14 – 17. 55).

40|$|Under the {{intrinsic}} variability {{of the wind}} speed and its exponential relationship with the rotor torque, the power control systems play an increasingly important role in terms of efficiency {{and stability in the}} modern and large wind turbines. The paper describes a power control system based on swept band area dimensional regulation (DBB) that it is particularly well suited for off-shore wind turbines. After an introduction of the modern power control strategies and revised their current limitations, the theoretical fundamentals of the new approach are formulated. The system operates jointly with pitch or <b>active</b> <b>stall</b> controls but dedicated to the low wind speed range. In this range, the dynamic pair of overlapping blade segments may increase or decrease their swept band areas aiming to reach a constant rated power output.

40|$|In this study, eight {{different}} control concepts for wind turbines are compared {{in terms of}} their annual energy capture. In detail, they are a stall controlled single speed concept, a stall controlled two speed concept, an <b>active</b> <b>stall</b> controlled single speed concept, an <b>active</b> <b>stall</b> controlled two speed concept, a pitch controlled single speed concept, a pitch controlled two speed concept, a stall controlled variable speed concept and finally a pitch controlled variable speed concept. In {{order to be able to}} expose all these different concepts to exactly the same wind conditions, numerical computer simulation is chosen as the appropriate method to do the comparison, as in reality it is almost impossible to achieve the same wind conditions for different turbines. This approach also prevents all possible differences in rotor layout between the individual concepts from entering into the results, as it is possible to use the same rotor design for all control concepts. Because the influence of time variant quantities such as the turbulent wind flow on a nonlinear system (e. g. a wind turbine rotor) has to be taken into account, an analytical representation had to be found which allowed a time-step simulation. This especially set some limits on the complexity allowed for the numerical model. Therefore the modeling of all parts of the system (whether they are aerodynamic, mechanic or electric) is kept rather simplistic. As a comparison of general control concepts is the topic of this study, the controllers are not modeled as they are used by a certain manufacturer. Instead they are modeled in an idealized way, each of which covers the ideal performance of one class of control concepts. For each combination of parameters, one time domain simulation was performed. The output data was then weighted and averaged in order to obtain the energy captured from the wind within one year. These energy values are finally arranged in a way which allows an easy comparison between the relative performance of all control concepts under consideration. The results show the differences in the annual energy capture of the eight concepts as a function of site conditions (the annual mean wind speed, the turbulence and the shape parameter of the Weibull distribution assumed for the annual wind speed distribution) as well as their dependence on two design parameters (the design tip speed ratio and the choice of rotor profiles). Due to the rather crude modeling these results have to be seen more qualitatively then quantitatively. However, they show to which extent a comparison between different control concepts depends on the values of different parameters. Hopefully, they also lead to a deeper understanding of the very different results of similar comparisons found in the literature...|$|E

This paper presents a first-of-a-kind feasibility study of an <b>active</b> <b>stall</b> control experiment with a magnetic bearing servo-actuator in the NASA Glenn high-speed single-stage compressor test facility. Together with CFD and experimental data a two-dimensional, incompressible compressor stability model was used in a stochastic estimation and control analysis to determine the required magnetic bearing performance for compressor stall control. The resulting requirements introduced new challenges to the magnetic bearing actuator design. A magnetic bearing servo-actuator was designed which fulfilled the performance specifications. Control laws were then developed to stabilize the compressor shaft. In a second control loop, a constant gain controller was implemented to stabilize rotating stall. A detailed closed loop simulation at 100 % corrected design speed resulted in a 2. 3 % reduction of stalling mass flow which is comparable to results obtained in the same compressor by Weigl et al.

A representative aviation high-bypass turbofan engine HPC is used in this study. Transient behavior of compressor with vary-ing ice ingestion conditions is compared and inter-stage dynam-ics is analyzed. Stage re-matching occurs due to heat exchange between air and ice which dictates the stall inception stage in the compressor. It is found that although T 3 drop is closely related to compressor stall inception, the transient mechanism of ice-shed also plays an important role. Comparisons are made with steady energy balance equation to determine total water content (TWC) at HPC inlet to emphasize the importance of compressor transients. The ice amount, its ingestion duration and rate affect the onset of stall. HPC might sustain through a slower ice-shed while a faster ice-shed can lead to compressor stall with little or no chances of recovery.

40|$|Abstract: Wind {{energy is}} a viable option to {{complement}} other types of pollution-free generation. In the early development of wind energy, the majority of wind turbines were operated at constant speed. Recently, the number of variable-speed wind turbines installed in wind farms has increased and more wind turbine manufacturers are making variable-speed wind turbines. A wind turbine model for control purposes needs {{to be based on}} linear mathematical models. The modeling of the wind turbine is based on certain aerodynamic phenomena (lift and drag) caused by the interaction of the rotor blade of the wind turbine and wind. The modeling of the wind turbine for control purposes involves the modeling of the relevant dynamics that affect the production of power and the stability of the wind turbine. This involves the rotor, the tower, the drive train, generator and the pitch actuator. The resulting non-linear model is then linearised at different working points. The linear model will be used for a rotor speed control algorithm. This paper analysis the modelling of variable speed wind turbines with active pitch control and <b>active</b> <b>stall</b> control. when the rated power is generated is known as rated rotor speed and the corresponding velocity of the wind is known as rated wind speed. But wind is stochastic (random or probabilistic but with some direction) in nature. Hence it is not always possible to obtain rated conditions for a wind turbine. Hence it is necessary to control the wind turbine in order to increase energy production and realize a long lifetime. When the velocity of the wind is below the rated wind speed then it is known as below rated wind speed, and when the velocity is more than rated then it is known as above rated windspeed. All wind turbines are designed with some sort of power control. There are different ways to control aerodynamic forces on the turbine rotor and thus to limit the power in very high winds in order to avoid damage to the wind turbine. I...|$|E

The underpinning idea is that as the aerodynamic loads are trimmed by flowcontrol actuatorswithout pitching the blades, the pitch system may be mitigated. In turn, this might lead to decreased failure-rates and down-time, and thus eventually present a more cost-effective solution than state-of-the art HAWTs. Going specifically into ASC, if aerodynamic load trimming is performed {{it is necessary to}} employ a flow control actuator. From different flow control actuator types, since the aim is to reduce the maintenance and operational costs of ASC machines, actuators with few mechanical parts become more interesting. As such the present research also focuses on the Alternating Current Dielectric Barrier Discharge (AC-DBD) plasma actuator, owing among other things to its absence of moving parts, negligible mass and virtually unlimited bandwidth of actuation. A preliminary study on the feasibility of <b>active</b> <b>stall</b> control to regulate HAWT power production in replacement of the pitch system is conducted. By taking the National Renewable Energy Laboratory 5 MWturbine as reference, a simple blade element momentum code is used to assess the required actuation authority. Considering half of the blade span is equipped with actuators, the required change in the lift coefficient to regulate power is estimated in ¢Cl Æ 0. 7. Concerning actuation technologies, three flow control devices are investigated, namely Boundary Layer Transpiration, Trailing Edge Jets and Dielectric Barrier Discharge plasma actuators. Results indicate the authority of the actuators considered is not sufficient to regulate power, since the change in the lift coefficient is not large enough. Especially if a pitch-controlledmachine is used as baseline case. <b>Active</b> <b>stall</b> control of Horizontal AxisWind Turbines appears feasible only if the rotor is re-designed from the start to incorporate active-stall devices. Regarding AC-DBD plasma actuators, three specific topics are investigated. The different studies aim at DBD performance characterization, namely at the influence of external flow on DBD plasma momentum transfer and on the frequency response of actuator flow region characteristic of DBD pulse operation. Both these topics are important {{to bridge the gap between}} academic-laboratory employment of DBD and large-size industrial applications. Finally regarding DBD plasma actuator modeling, a method is developed to describe plasma actuation effects in integral boundary layer formulation, and coupled to a viscous-inviscid panel code (similar to XFOIL), while an experimental campaign is carried to validate the predictions. The three DBD plasma studies are further described below. Addressing cross-talk effects between DBD plasma actuators and external flow, a study is carried out in which an actuator is positioned in a boundary layer operated in a range of free stream velocities from 0 to 60 m/s, and tested both in counter-flow and co-flow forcing configurations. Electrical measurements and a CCD camera are used to characterize the DBD performance at different external flow speeds, while the actuator thrust is measured using a sensitive load cell. Results show the power consumption is constant for different flow velocities and actuator configurations, while the plasma light emission is constant for co-flow forcing but increases with counter-flow forcing for increasing free stream velocities. The measured force is constant for free stream velocities larger than 20 m/s, with same magnitude and opposite direction for the counter-flow and co-flow configurations. In quiescent conditions the measured force is smaller due to the change in wall shear force by the induced wall-jet. In addition to the experimental study, an analytical model is presented to estimate the influence of external flow on the actuator force. It is based on conservation of momentum through the ion-neutral collisional process while including the {{contribution of}} the wall shear force. Model results compare well with experimental data at different external flow velocities, while extrapolation to larger velocities shows variation in actuator thrust of at least 10 % for external speedU Æ 200 m/s. Concerning the response of DBD actuator region flow to pulsed operation, a methodology is provided to derive the local frequency response of flow under actuation, in terms of the magnitude of actuator induced velocity perturbations. The method is applied to an AC- DBD plasma actuator but can be extended to other kinds of pulsed actuation. For the derivation, the actuator body force termis introduced in the Navier-Stokes equations, from which the flow is locally approximated with a linear-time-invariant (LTI) system. The proposed semi-phenomenologicalmodel includes the effect of both viscosity and external flow velocity, while providing a system response in the frequency domain. Experimental data is compared with analytical results for a typical DBD plasma actuator operating in quiescent flow and in a laminar boundary layer. Good agreement is obtained between analytical and experimental results for cases below the model validity threshold frequency. These results demonstrate an efficient yet simple approach towards prediction of the response of a convective flow to pulsed actuation. Future application of the methodology might include actuation scheduling design and optimization for different flow control scenarios. The third study specifically addressing DBD plasma actuators presents a methodology to model the effect of DBD plasma actuators on airfoil performance within the framework of a viscous-inviscid airfoil analysis code. The approach is valid for incompressible, turbulent flow applications. The effect of (plasma) body forces in the boundary layer is analyzed with a generalized form of the von Kármán integral boundary layer equations. The additional terms appearing in the von Kármán equations give rise to a new closure relation. The model is implemented in a viscous-inviscid airfoil analysis code and validated by carrying out an experimental study. PIV measurements are performed on an airfoil equipped with DBD plasma actuators over a range of Reynolds number and angle of attack combinations. Balance measurements are also collected to evaluate the lift and drag coefficients. Results show the proposed model captures the magnitude of the variation in IBL parameters from DBD actuation. Additionally the magnitude of the lift coefficient variations (¢Cl) induced by plasma actuation is reasonably estimated. As such, this approach enables the design of airfoils specifically tailored for DBD plasma flow control. Transitioning into ASCrotor design, and building on the previously presented, a methodology is introduced for designing airfoils suitable to employ actuation in a wind energy environment. The novel airfoil sections are baptized WAP (Wind Energy Actuated Profiles). A genetic algorithm based multiobjective airfoil optimizer is formulated by setting two cost functions, one for wind energy performance and the other representing actuation suitability. The wind energy cost function considers ’reference’ wind energy airfoils while using a probabilistic approach to include the effects of turbulence and wind shear. The actuation suitability cost function is developed for HAWT <b>active</b> <b>stall</b> control, including two different control strategies designated by ’enhanced’ and ’decreased’ performance. Two different actuation types are considered, namely boundary layer transpiration and DBD plasma. Results show that using WAP airfoils provides much higher control efficiency than adding actuation on reference wind energy airfoils, without detrimental effects in non-actuated operation. The WAP sections yield an actuator employment efficiency that is 2 to 4 times larger than obtained with reference wind energy airfoils. Regarding geometry, WAP sections for decreased performance display an upper surface concave aft-region compared to typical wind energy ’reference’ airfoils,while retaining common sharp nose and S-tail (characteristic aft-loading) features. Results show there is much to gain in designing airfoils from the beginning to include actuation effects, especially compared to employing actuation on already existing airfoils, which ultimately might pave theway for novelHAWT control strategies. Finally addressing the complete rotor planform design, an optimization study tailors a HAWT rotor to ASC operation, in a aero-structural-servo formulation. The study considers the aerodynamic and structural loads are in static equilibrium, and as such no unsteady effects are taken into account. The optimization includes planformgeometry design but also actuation scheduling, rated rotational speed and spanwise laminate skin thickness. Results show that, compared to variable-pitch turbines, ASC planform displays increased chord at inboard stations with decreased twist angle towards the tip, resulting in increased AOA. Actuation is employed to trim the (static) loads across the operational wind speed envelope and hence reduce load overshoots and associated costs. Comparing with state-of-the-art pitch machines, the expected COE of the ASC rotor does not indicate a significant decrease, but appears to be at least competitive with pitch-controlled HAWTs if the pitch system is effectively mitigated. Additionally, and though not explicitly considered in the present work, it is foreseen ASC might become interesting if the actuation system allows for further OM cost reduction via fatigue load-alleviation, since the actuation trimming load system is anyhow included in an ASC machine.

40|$|The {{impact of}} wind power {{generation}} {{in the power}} system is no longer negligible. Therefore, there is an urgent need for wind turbine models {{that are capable of}} accurately simulating the interaction between wind turbines or wind farms and the power system. One problem is that no standardized model of wind turbines for power system stability studies is currently available. In response to this problem, generic dynamic models of wind turbines for stability studies are proposed in this thesis. Three wind turbine concepts are considered; fixed-speed wind turbines (FSWTs), doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) wind turbines and full converter wind turbines (FCWTs). The proposed models are developed for positive-sequence phasor time-domain dynamic simulations and are implemented in the standard power system simulation tool PSS/E with a 10 ms time step. Response accuracy of the proposed models is validated against detailed models and, in some cases, against field measurement data. A direct solution method is proposed for initializing a DFIG wind turbine model. A model of a dc-link braking resistor with limited energy capacity is proposed, thus a unified model of an FCWT for a power system stability analysis can be obtained. The results show that the proposed models are able to simulate wind turbine responses with sufficient accuracy. The generic models proposed in this thesis {{can be seen as a}} contribution to the ongoing discourse on standardized models of wind power generation for power system stability studies. Aggregated models of wind farms are studied. A single equivalent unit representation of a wind farm is found to be sufficient for most short-term voltage stability investigations. The results show that non-linearities due to maximum power tracking characteristics and saturation of electrical controllers play no important role in characterizing wind farm responses. For a medium-term study, which may include wind transport phenomena, a cluster representation of a wind farm provides a more realistic prediction. Different influencing factors in designing dynamic reactive power compensation for an offshore wind farm consisting of FSWTs are also investigated. The results show that fault ride-through capability of the individual turbines in the wind farm utilizing an <b>active</b> <b>stall</b> control significantly reduces the requirement for the dynamic reactive power compensation. </p...|$|E
40|$|With {{projected}} {{increases in}} green energy production, {{the integration of}} these new technologies is becoming an increasing cause for concern. As such, this thesis aims to investigate the integration of a particular wind turbine technology, or configuration, on a specific section of the local South West grid (SWIS). This thesis will focus on steady state voltage stability, transient post fault generator response, and voltage decline due to the starting of the generators. It will also compare the transient findings of this turbine configuration to that of another turbine configuration. The wind farm that is simulated will be called the type A Wind Farm, and consists of 12 Vestas V 82 type A turbines. They are <b>active</b> <b>stall</b> controlled units, which connect the turbine rotor blade to the induction generator rotor via a gearbox. These are coupled with soft starters and are provided with reactive power compensation {{in the form of}} switchable capacitor banks. A step up transformer brings the generation voltage up to distribution level, which in this case is 22 kV. The A 1 distribution network is a specific section of grid upon which all power flow calculations take place. This is an arbitrary name given to an actual section of network due to confidentiality reasons. It has been used as it lies on the extremities of the SWIS, and will best indicate how such a wind turbine generator will impact a weaker section of grid. It is also the same network used by Fidock (2010), for his studies on a type D turbine configuration, and as such will provide a good baseline for comparisons between the two technologies. The findings of this thesis indicate that steady state operation of the type A turbine configuration produces voltages within acceptable limits. Starting of these generators can also be handled by this section of the network, however soft starters are recommended and smart operator control is essential. Due to their high reactive power draw following a network fault, it is highly recommended that turbine configurations of this construct be disconnected from the grid post fault, and reconnected after the grid has stabilized. A comparison of the two different technologies indicates that type A has much less voltage and power flow control compared to type D. The results also indicate that widespread integration of type A wind turbine generators be extremely limited, and large wind farms of this technology should not be installed on the extremities of the grid...|$|E
40|$|Feedback {{stabilization}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} dominant issues in modern control theory. The validity of linear control design is based on the assumption that the system is stabilizable. With rapid broadening of control applications to complex systems during the past two decades, the attainability of linear stabilizability sometimes has to compromise with system constraints and affordability of distributed actuation. The goal of this thesis is to tackle some of the problems in control of nonequilibrium behavior and to apply the theory to active control of fluid instabilities in gas turbine engines. We consider two of the simplest nontrivial scenarios in local smooth feedback stabilization: the steady-state case, when the linearly unstabilizable eigenvalue is zero; and the Hopf case, when the unstabilizable eigenvalues are a pair of pure imaginary numbers. Under certain nondegeneracy conditions, we give explicit algebraic conditions for stabilizability. And when the system is stabilizable, the stabilizing feedback can be explicitly constructed. The problem of local smooth feedback stabilization for systems with critical unstabilizable modes is closely related to bifurcation control. Under certain nondegeneracy conditions, a steady-state/Hopf bifurcation can be turned into a supercritical pitchfork/Hopf bifurcation if and only if the system is locally stabilizable at the bifurcation point. Algebraic necessary and sufficient conditions are derived under which the criticality of a simple steady-state or Hopf bifurcation can be changed to supercritical by a smooth feedback. The effects of magnitude saturation, bandwidth, and rate limits are important issues in control engineering. We give qualitative estimates of the region of attraction to the stabilized bifurcating equilibrium/periodic orbits under these constraints. We apply the above theoretical results to the Moore-Greitzer model in active control of rotating stall and surge in gas turbine engines. Though linear stabilizability can be achieved using distributed actuation, it limits the practical usefulness due to considerations of affordability and reliability. On the other hand, simple but practically promising actuation schemes such as outlet bleed valves, a couple of air injectors, and magnetic bearings will make the system loss of linear stabilizability, thus the control design becomes a challenging task. The above mentioned results in bifurcation stabilization can be applied to these cases. We analyze the effects of magnitude and rate saturations in <b>active</b> <b>stall</b> and surge control using bleed valves and magnetic bearings using the Moore-Greitzer model. The analytical formulas for bleed valve actuation give good qualitative predictions when compared with experiments. Our conclusion is that these constraints are serious limiting factors in stall control and must be addressed in practical implementation to the aircraft engines...|$|E
40|$|Aircraft {{compressors}} {{can suffer}} debilitating consequences {{as a result}} of rotating stall and surge events caused by inlet distortions. This is particularly true of aircraft during takeoff, when the compressor is operating at peak performance close to the surge line. Significant research has been conducted by the NASA Glenn Research Center in the area of compressor stability enhancement through active and passive control methods. Most recently, an experiment was conducted at the Wright Patterson Air Force Base Research Laboratory on a two-stage fan with inlet guide vanes and inlet distortion. In this joint Small Business Innovation Research effort between Scientific Systems and Glenn, control of rotating stall was demonstrated in a multistage transonic fan. This twostage fan with inlet guide vanes was tested under clean and distorted inlet conditions. The compressor was also configured with a circumferential distortion screen capable of 180 of distortion and with 14 high-velocity injectors upstream of the first rotor. Twelve of these injectors could oscillate up to frequencies of 450 Hz. The additional two injectors were located next to each other and were used in concert with each other as a single, on/off, high-authority actuator. In a first test of injection in this multistage environment, 12 of the valves were opened 50 percent of their full stroke to assess steady injection through the compressor. This baseline injection is shown in the compressor characteristic of the following figure, and stall margin improvements are tracked from this baseline condition. The compressor was then tested with clean inlet conditions using 12 injectors and active control. Pressure disturbances were tracked before rotating stall, and a constant gain control scheme reduced the stalling mass flow by 10. 8 percent over the baseline. With the distortion screen present in the inlet, a pole-zero cancellation control scheme was used to achieve a 6. 4 -percent decrease in stalling mass flow. These improvements also are shown in the figure. In a final experiment, actively controlled, high-frequency injection from the 12 valves was used in conjunction with the high-authority actuators. In this test, the stalling mass flow of the compressor was reduced by 27 percent as indicated in the graph. These results were obtained by injecting less than 2 percent of the total compressor throughflow into the rotor tip region via 14 injection ports. These results mark the first successful demonstration of actively controlled air injection as a stall-control strategy for multistage compressors operating at speeds typical of an actual gas turbine engine. A goal of continuing research is to determine the combination of air-injection parameters and control strategies that are most effective in providing stall control for both clean and distorted inlet flow conditions for multistage environments. Other goals include the demonstration of stall control at many locations along the core compressor and development and application of <b>active</b> <b>stall</b> control strategies that will be integral flightworthy components of onboard engine hardware...|$|E
40|$|The {{presented}} work is {{a compilation}} of four different projects related to axial and centrifugal compression systems. The projects are related by the underlying dynamic system modeling approach that is common in all of them. Two types of models are introduced, suitable for modeling the dynamic behavior of axial and centrifugal compression systems: a compact single semi-actuator disk model, Model I, and a new modular multi semi-actuator disk model, Model II. The first project analyzes aerodynamically induced whirling forces in axial-flow compressors and a new unsteady low order model is introduced to predict the destabilizing whirling forces. The model consists of two parts: compressor Model I with the effect of tip-clearance induced distortion, and an aerodynamically induced force model. The modeling results are compared to experimental data obtained from the GE Aircraft Engines test program on compressor whirl. Previously outstanding whirl-instability issues are resolved, including prediction of the direction and magnitude of rotor whirl-inducing forces; such issues are important {{in the design of}} modern axial-flow compressors. (cont.) Additional insight is gained from the model on the effects of forced rotor whirl. In particular, a non-dimensional parameter is deduced that determines the direction of rotor whirl tendency in both compressors and turbines due to tangential blade loading forces. The second project is a first-of-a-kind feasibility study of an <b>active</b> <b>stall</b> control experiment with a mag- netic bearing servo-actuator in the NASA Glenn high-speed single-stage compressor test facility. Together with CFD and experimental data the tip-clearance sensitive compressor Model I was used in a stochastic estimation and control analysis to determine the required magnetic bearing performance for compressor stall control. A magnetic bearing servo-actuator was designed that fulfilled the performance specifications, setting a milestone in magnetic bearing development for aero-engine applications. Control laws were then developed to stabilize the compressor shaft. In a second control loop, a constant gain controller was imple- mented to stabilize rotating stall. A detailed closed loop simulation at 100 % corrected design speed resulted in a 2. 3 % reduction of stalling mass flow which is comparable to results obtained in the same compressor using unsteady air injection. (cont.) The third project is the investigation of unsteady impeller-diffuser interaction effects on compressor stability. First, the unsteady blade-row interaction in axial compressors is analyzed using Model II. The results reveal a new signature of pre-stall waves that travel backward, altering the system dynamics when rotor and stator are moderately coupled. The physical mechanism for this behavior is explained from first principles and a coupling criterion is presented. The theory is then applied to centrifugal compressors and in particular to the NASA CC 3 high-speed centrifugal compressor, in which experiments are conducted to verify the model predictions. The measurements show the predicted behavior and confirm the existence of backward traveling stall pre-cursors. The fourth project is an experimental demonstration of stability enhancement in the NASA CC 3 high-speed centrifugal compressor with air injection. Based [...] . by Zoltán Spakovszky. Thesis (Ph. D.)
