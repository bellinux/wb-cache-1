5|$|The use of interferon, which {{requires}} injections daily or thrice weekly, has been supplanted by long-acting PEGylated interferon, which is injected only once weekly. However, some individuals {{are much more}} likely to respond than others, and this might be because of the genotype of the infecting virus or the person's heredity. The treatment reduces viral replication in the liver, thereby reducing the viral load (the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> particles as measured in the blood). Response to treatment differs between the genotypes. Interferon treatment may produce an e antigen seroconversion rate of 37% in genotype A but only a 6% seroconversion in type D. Genotype B has similar seroconversion rates to type A while type C seroconverts only in 15% of cases. Sustained e antigen loss after treatment is ~45% in types A and B but only 25–30% in types C and D.|$|E
25|$|The {{consensus}} {{in the scientific community}} is that the Duesberg hypothesis has been refuted by a large and growing mass of evidence showing that HIV causes AIDS, that the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> in the blood correlates with disease progression, that a plausible mechanism for HIV's action has been proposed, and that anti-HIV medication decreases mortality and opportunistic infection in people with AIDS.|$|E
25|$|Viral DNA can be {{detected}} by PCR. The primers used must be specific to the targeted sequences in the DNA of a virus, and PCR {{can be used for}} diagnostic analyses or DNA sequencing of the viral genome. The high sensitivity of PCR permits virus detection soon after infection and even before the onset of disease. Such early detection may give physicians a significant lead time in treatment. The <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> ("viral load") in a patient can also be quantified by PCR-based DNA quantitation techniques (see below).|$|E
40|$|Cattle {{and sheep}} were housed with {{infected}} pigs for 11 days. Small <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> were recovered intermittently from the pharynx, milk and rectal swabs of the cattle, but {{no evidence of}} subclinical infection was found. Some indication <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> growth in the sheep was obtained in that large <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> were recovered from the pharyngeal region 4 to 7 days after exposure and six of the eight sheep developed significant titres of neutralizing antibody which were maintained in four animals for at least 6 weeks...|$|R
40|$|Pigs {{exposed to}} {{relatively}} small <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> by intradermal inoculation {{of the feet}} or by skin sacrification developed clinical disease. Large <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> were recovered from samples taken from the nose, mouth, pharynx, rectum and the prepuce or vagina {{during the first week}} of infection and smaller amounts during the second week. Virus was recovered from the faeces of most animals 16 days after infection and from one animal for 23 days. Pigs in contact with inoculated animals were killed at intervals before the appearance of clinical disease. The distribution and <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> in various tissues indicated that infection has most likely gained entry through the skin or the epithelia and mucosae of the digestive tract.

25|$|HIV (human {{immunodeficiency}} virus) {{damages the}} body's immune system, which interferes with {{its ability to}} fight off disease-causing agents. The virus kills CD4 cells, which are white blood cells that help fight off various infections. HIV is carried in body fluids, and is spread by sexual activity. It can also be spread by contact with infected blood, breast feeding, childbirth, and from mother to child during pregnancy. When HIV is at its most advanced stage, an individual {{is said to have}} AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). There are different stages of the progression of and HIV infection. The stages include primary infection, asymptomatic infection, symptomatic infection, and AIDS. In the primary infection stage, an individual will have flu like symptoms (headache, fatigue, fever, muscle aches) for about 2 weeks. In the asymptomatic stage, symptoms usually disappear, and the patient can remain asymptomatic for years. When HIV progresses to the symptomatic stage, the immune system is weakened, and has a low cell count of CD4+ T Cells. When the HIV infection becomes life-threatening, it is called AIDS. People with AIDS fall prey to opportunistic infections and die as a result. When the disease was first discovered in the 1980s, those who had AIDS were not likely to live longer than a few years. There are now antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) available to treat HIV infections. There is no known cure for HIV or AIDS but the drugs help suppress the virus. By suppressing the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> in the body, people can lead longer and healthier lives. Even though their virus levels may be low they can still spread the virus to others.|$|E
2500|$|A {{separate}} {{argument for}} starting antiretroviral therapy that has gained more prominence is {{its effect on}} HIV transmission. ART reduces the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> in the blood and genital secretions. This {{has been shown to}} lead to dramatically reduced transmission of HIV when one partner with a suppressed viral load (<50 copies/ml) has sex with a partner who is HIV negative. In clinical trial HPTN 052, 1763 serodiscordant heterosexual couples in 9 countries were planned to be followed for at least 10 years, with both groups receiving education on preventing HIV transmission and condoms, but only one group getting ART. The study was stopped early for ethical reasons {{when it became clear that}} antiviral treatment provided significant protection. Of the 28 couples where cross-infection had occurred, all but one had taken place in the control group consistent with a 96% reduction in risk of transmission while on ART. The single transmission in the control group occurred early after starting ART before viral load was likely to be suppressed.|$|E
2500|$|In 1941, Hirst {{discovered}} that adding influenza virus particles to {{red blood cells}} caused them to agglutinate or stick together forming a lattice, a phenomenon called hemagglutination. Hemagglutination provided a convenient method of diagnosing influenza in the laboratory, which had previously been performed by cultivating the virus in ferrets. Hirst developed this reaction into the hemagglutination assay, which allows the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> in the sample to be measured. This technique is rapid, accurate and convenient, and later proved to be applicable to many other viruses. Wolfgang Joklik cites the discovery of hemagglutination {{as one of the}} [...] "early epoch-making discoveries in virology," [...] stating that it made influenza virus [...] "the first mammalian virus whose replication could be studied biochemically." [...] Although Hirst did not know this at the time, hemagglutination is caused by the influenza virus hemagglutinin (a glycoprotein on the viral envelope) binding to sialic acid {{on the surface of the}} red blood cell; the same mechanism is central to the influenza virus entering its host cell.|$|E
40|$|A model {{activated}} sludge treatment plant was used which was functionally very similar to a full scale plant. It was inoculated with poliovirus either continuously or with a single dose and the <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> in the influent, mixed liquor and effluent were monitored regularly. The distribution <b>of</b> the <b>virus</b> in the liquid and solid phases of the mixed liquor was very unequal with about 85 % <b>of</b> the <b>virus</b> associated with the suspended solids fraction. Only small <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> were recovered from the effluent and after inoculation was stopped virus rapidly became indetectable. The efficiency of the plant with regard to removal <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> was closely related to its capacity to remove suspended solids and the adsorption <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> to solids and its inactivation is briefly discussed...|$|R

2500|$|Plant virus {{transmission}} {{from generation}} to generation occurs in about 20% of plant viruses. When viruses are transmitted by seeds, the seed is infected in the generative cells and the virus is maintained in the germ cells and sometimes, but less often, in the seed coat. When the growth and development of plants is delayed because of situations like unfavourable weather, there is an increase in the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> infections in seeds. [...] There {{does not seem to be}} a correlation between the location of the seed on the plant and its chances of being infected. [...] Little is known about the mechanisms involved in the transmission of plant viruses via seeds, although it is known that it is environmentally influenced and that seed transmission occurs because of a direct invasion of the embryo via the ovule or by an indirect route with an attack on the embryo mediated by infected gametes. [...] These processes can occur concurrently or separately depending on the host plant. It is unknown how the virus is able to directly invade and cross the embryo and [...] boundary between the parental and progeny generations in the ovule.|$|E
50|$|This assay may be {{modified}} to include the addition of an antiserum.

40|$|Summary In {{this brief}} review, key {{events in the}} presumed {{pathogenesis}} and epidemiology of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV- 2) infection and PCV- 2 -induced postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) in swine are highlighted. Unanswered is the central issue of why this infection/PMWS has gone from a sporadic, low incidence occurrence to an epidemic form in the last 5 - 6 years. Most of the work presented is derived from experimental reproduction of the subclinical infection and PMWS in gnotobiotic swine by oral inoculation (the presumed predominant route of infection in naturally occuring disease) <b>of</b> infectious <b>virus</b> materials into young gnotobiotes. While the cellular identity of cells/tissues which support active viral replication are not yet known, {{it is clear that}} a central feature of the pathogenesis of disease is progressive accumulation of infectious materials within follicular dendritic cells, histiocytes and macrophages in lymphoid tissues and elsewhere. The <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> infectious <b>virus</b> produced in tissues correlates with disease status. Low <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> correlate with subclinical infection status whereas high <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> are strongly associated with progression to PMWS.

50|$|Branched DNA testing or bDNA {{testing is}} a test created by the Chiron company to measure the viral load of HIV {{in a sample of}} blood.
