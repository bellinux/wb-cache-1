Ten tonnes of barley inoculated with Penicillium verrucosum were incubated until the OTA concentration reached approximately 15 µg/kg and sampled with manual and <b>automatic</b> <b>sampling.</b> A nested experimental design and ANOVA was used to estimate variance components from sampling, sample reduction, sample preparation and analysis.

The so-called Kelder cells were used in combination with the ASPEC system (<b>Automatic</b> <b>Sample</b> Preparation with Extraction Columns), which is designed for the automation of solid-phase extractions (SPE). Instead of SPE columns, 20 Kelder cells were placed in the racks. This allowed <b>automatic</b> <b>sampling</b> of up to 20 cells for 24 h in a dynamic mode. The cells consist of an inlet compartment, a donor compartment and a receptor compartment.

The Kelder cells mimic blood flow beneath the skin by replacement of the permeating drug every 2 min. Hence sink conditions are more easily maintained than with the static Franz diffusion cell.
