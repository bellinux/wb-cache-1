5|$|This {{pay raise}} {{proposal}} was submitted as {{an amendment to}} the government's general appropriations bill. Had Grant vetoed the bill, the government would not have <b>any</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> operate for the following fiscal year, which would have necessitated a special session of Congress. However, Grant missed an opportunity to make a statement by threatening a veto.|$|E
5|$|On 27 March 1625, King James I of England died, and was {{succeeded by}} his son, who became Charles I. Along with the throne, Charles {{inherited}} the Thirty Years' War, in which Christian IV of Denmark and Frederick V, Elector Palatine, {{who was married}} to Charles's sister Elizabeth, were attempting to take back their hereditary lands and titles from the Habsburg Monarchy. James had caused significant financial problems with his attempts to support Christian and Frederick, and {{it was expected that}} Charles would be more amenable to prosecuting the war responsibly. After he summoned a new Parliament to meet in April 1625, it became clear that he was not; he demanded over £700,000 to assist in prosecuting the war. The House of Commons refused, and instead passed two bills granting him only £112,000. In addition, rather than renewing the customs due from Tonnage and Poundage for the entire life of the monarch, which was traditional, the Commons only voted them in for one year. Because of this, the House of Lords rejected the bill, leaving Charles without <b>any</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> provide for the war effort.|$|E
25|$|The {{sovereign}} similarly only {{draws from}} Canadian funds for {{support in the}} performance of her duties when in Canada or acting as Queen of Canada abroad; Canadians do not pay <b>any</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> the Queen or any other member of the Royal Family, either towards personal income or to support royal residences outside of Canada.|$|E

25|$|Five {{years after}} the {{payments}} began, Mulroney and Schreiber met again in a suite at the Hotel Savoy in Zurich, Switzerland. Schreiber claims Mulroney tried to extract a promise: Schreiber would never reveal the payments. Schreiber also claims Mulroney's attorneys later tried to induce him into perjury by asking that he sign an affidavit falsely stating {{that he had never}} paid <b>any</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> Mulroney. Mulroney denies this, and also denies Schreiber's claim that the payments totaled $300,000.|$|E
25|$|The {{sovereign}} {{and other}} members of the Royal Family are only supported by tax dollars in the performance of their official duties. Should a province be hosting events that involve royal participation, the costs are also split between the federal and provincial spheres—the provincial Crown may pay for accommodation and transport, while the federal Crown supplies funds for Royal Canadian Mounted Police security and other household staff. Residents of the provinces do not pay <b>any</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> the royals, either as personal income or to support royal residences outside of the province.|$|E
25|$|Australia {{does not}} pay <b>any</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> the Queen, either for {{personal}} income or to support the royal residences outside Australia. Only when the Queen is in Australia does the Australian government support her {{in the performance of}} her duties. This rule applies equally to other members of the Royal Family. Usually the Queen's Australian governments pay only for the costs associated with the Governor-General and state governors in their exercising of the powers of the Crown on behalf of the Queen, including travel, security, residences, offices and ceremonial occasions.|$|E

25|$|She then {{studied at}} Liqing middle school. However, her mother {{still did not}} change her mind---she did not allow Lanying to study in middle school. She said that middle school was {{provided}} for males, and as a female, literacy did not matter. Lanying fought {{with her mother and}} finally compromised that if she did not need <b>any</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> study, her mother would accept. This middle school provided the scholarship for students who got the three best grades in each semester. Because of this, Lanying Lin got the scholarship every semester and finished her studies successfully.|$|E
25|$|In this will, Hughes {{left his}} entire estate to the Hughes Medical Institute, {{as he had}} no {{connection}} to family and was seriously ill. This {{is contrary to the}} many wills that have surfaced after his death. The original will that included payments to aides never surfaced. It was apparently in a home surrounding the Desert Inn Golf Course belonging to the mother of an assistant. He had no desire to leave <b>any</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> family, aides or churches, including William Gay and Frank Morse. Hughes was not Mormon and had no reason to leave his estate to that church. Frank P. Morse is still the attorney of record for Hughes. Gay has devoted his life to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after this, the Athenians {{initiated}} the Common Peace of 375 BC (Κοινὴ Εἰρήνη, Koine Eirene) among Greek city-states. According to Xenophon, they were alarmed at the growing power of Thebes and weary of fending off Spartan fleets alone as the Thebans were not contributing <b>any</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> maintaining the Athenian fleet. However this broke down soon after in 374 BC, when Athens and Sparta resumed hostilities over Korkyra (modern Corfu). During this time period, Athens also gradually became hostile to Thebes. While Athens and Sparta were busy fighting each other, Thebes resumed her campaigns against the autonomous pro-Spartan Boeotian poleis. Thespiae and Tanagra were subjugated and formally {{became part of}} the reestablished democratic Boeotian confederacy. In 373 BC, Thebans under the command of the boeotarch Neocles attacked and razed its traditional rival, the Boeotian city of Plataea. The Plataean citizens were allowed to leave alive, but they were reduced to being refugees and sought sanctuary in Athens. Of the pro-Spartan Boeotian poleis, only Orchomenus remained.|$|E

500|$|The film also {{influenced}} American film productions: John Carpenter {{has suggested that}} the film inspired the idea of a featureless mask for the Michael Myers character in the slasher film series Halloween.

It was originally written the way you see it, in other words, it's a pale mask with human features, almost featureless.

Peter even ordered that Zotov's widow be married to Buturlin in the fall of 1721.

[...] "He was an annoying little kid who got fired every time he was a P.A. because he was so inquisitive. But every time they fired him I'd bring him back because I felt like he always had something." [...] Eight years later, Robinson ran into Daniels at a poetry reading in New York City, and told him to audition for the film. Daniels didn't have <b>any</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> get to Atlanta where he had to audition, so he hustled money doing poetry in subways, and bought a bus ticket to get there.|$|E

2500|$|By late 2000, Shaik {{knew that}} the South African Revenue Service (SARS) and the Scorpions would be {{watching}} all financial transactions made between him and Zuma, so the international division of Thomson-CSF sent an encrypted fax to Nkobi Holdings detailing a “service provider agreement" [...] which updated the contract signed between Nkobi Holdings and Thomson-CSF for the delivery of the Corvettes. This agreement was used to disguise the payment of the bribe. The fax, which was later obtained in a raid on Shaik’s office by the Scorpions, contained a non-bribery clause next to which Shaik wrote “conflicts with intention", yet despite the careful set-up, Thomson-CSF did not transfer <b>any</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> Shaik. Subsequently, Zuma went to meet with Thétard in Paris, following which R250,000 (US$38,000) was transferred by Thomson-CSF to the “Jacob Zuma Education Fund".|$|E
2500|$|During {{subsequent}} {{negotiations over}} {{the latter part}} of 1999, Shaik and Thétard agreed to a bribe amount of R1 million (US$154,000), and at a meeting in March 2000, Thétard, Shaik, and Zuma finalised the exchange. At this point, Zuma was in desperate need for money as the bribe was going to cover the continued construction of his Nkandla development, yet Thétard has not transferred <b>any</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> Shaik thus far. Shaik demanded an immediate response to this “extremely delicate matter" [...] from Thétard, but Thétard failed to respond and by 19 October, Shaik in his role as Zuma’s financial advisor, attempted to stop all construction on Nkandla, prompting Zuma to tell his contractors to ignore Shaik’s orders. Zuma wrote a cheque for R1 million to his contractors, the payment of which was stopped by Shaik.|$|E
2500|$|On March 18, 2008, {{running back}} Ereck Plancher {{collapsed}} shortly after a conditioning drill, and was then transported {{to a nearby}} hospital where he died approximately one hour later. ESPN's [...] "Outside The Lines" [...] program on November 2, 2008 interviewed players {{who were at the}} training session at which Plancher became ill, and which after he died, and stated that the session was longer and far more rigorous than O'Leary and other UCF Athletics officials have admitted to publicly. They also alleged that O'Leary and other coaches had initially warned players off from providing assistance to Plancher when he became visibly distressed. After a 14-day trial in 2011, a jury found the UCF Athletics Association guilty of negligence in the death of Plancher. The jury awarded each of his parents $5 million. Upon appeal, however, the Florida Supreme Court sided with the University of Central Florida, ruling that sickle-cell disease caused the death and the university didn't owe <b>any</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> Plancher's family.|$|E
