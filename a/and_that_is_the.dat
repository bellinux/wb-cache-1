5|$|Composed by Academy Award winner Bill Conti, the Rocky Balboa film {{score is}} both an updated {{composition}} of Rocky music and {{a tribute to the}} music that has been featured in previous Rocky films. Conti, who has acted as composer on every Rocky film except Rocky IV, chose to compose the score almost entirely from musical themes used in the previous movies. Only one original theme was written specifically for Rocky Balboa <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> theme written to represent the character of Marie.|$|E
5|$|Within {{less than}} a week of the mutiny, a Court of Inquiry was set up to {{investigate}} and collect evidence for the trial for the mutineers. Although the Court of Inquiry was meant to take place behind closed doors, as accordance with standard military procedures, the proceeding was held in public instead. According to Harper and Miller this was to give the public the impression that the mutineers “were being tried for mutiny and shooting with intent to kill and not, as alleged for refusal to go to Turkey’’. Although the Court of Inquiry was clearly trying to downplay the link between Turkey and the mutiny, with the declassification of new documents and evidence, another perception has emerged in explaining the cause of the mutiny <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> role of pan-Islamism. Contrary to official British colonial authorities, the mutiny was not an isolated case of a purely local affair but was instead part of a wider anti-British and pro-Muslim battle.|$|E

Newspapers heralded Tubman's [...] "patriotism, sagacity, energy, [...] ability", and she {{was praised}} for her {{recruiting}} efforts – most of the newly liberated men went on to join the Union army. Tubman later worked with Colonel Robert Gould Shaw at the assault on Fort Wagner, reportedly serving him his last meal. She described the battle by saying: [...] "And then we saw <b>the</b> lightning, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> guns; <b>and</b> then we heard <b>the</b> thunder, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> big guns; <b>and</b> then we heard <b>the</b> rain falling, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> drops of blood falling; and {{when we came to}} get <b>the</b> crops, it <b>was</b> dead men <b>that</b> we reaped." ...|$|R

25|$|The {{inspiration}} for this play {{was that of}} the music directors in an interview he said that {{when he was a child}} he watch a lot of Lam Ching-Ying's movies with his younger brother.

She also said she was sort of forced into watching the movies because her parents are big fans.|$|E
25|$|Dharmakaya is like space. You cannot {{say there}} is any limit to space in any direction. No matter how far you go, you never {{reach a point where}} space stops <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> end of space. Space is {{infinite}} in all directions; so is dharmakaya. Dharmakaya is all-pervasive and totally infinite, beyond any confines or limitations. This is so for the dharmakaya of all buddhas. There is no individual dharmakaya for each buddha, as there is no individual space for each country.|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{formation}} of The Monkees, Michael Nesmith liked twelve-string electric guitars. At the time, only Rickenbacker and Vox mass-produced them. Nesmith preferred the bluesy twangy {{sound of a}} Gretsch over the distinctive pop sound of a Rickenbacker. According to Nesmith, there was a luthier in Los Angeles who converted six-string electric guitars into twelve-string guitars. Nesmith bought a Gretsch Country Gentleman to convert into a twelve-string, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> guitar he used in the pilot episode of The Monkees.|$|E

50|$|From {{the period}} of 1922 to 1928 the two main factors <b>that</b> took over <b>and</b> {{increased}} Colombia’s economy <b>were</b> <b>the</b> rise in external coffee prices (the main exportation product) and a huge increase in the international credits {{to the public and}} the bank system. An incredible amount of money <b>was</b> flowing within <b>the</b> country with prosperity yet to <b>be</b> paid. Therefore, <b>the</b> economic success wasn’t internally based and sustained, divergently <b>the</b> economy <b>was</b> holding on <b>the</b> United States credits <b>and</b> investment. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> mistake <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> cause of the future crisis.|$|R

25|$|Enteroviruses infect the enteric tract, {{which is}} {{reflected}} in their name. On the other hand, rhinoviruses infect primarily the nose and the throat. Enteroviruses replicate at 37°C, whereas rhinoviruses grow better at 33°C, as this is the lower temperature of the nose. Enteroviruses are stable under acid conditions and thus {{they are able to}} survive exposure to gastric acid. In contrast, rhinoviruses are acid-labile (inactivated or destroyed by low pH conditions) <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> reason why rhinovirus infections are restricted to the nose and throat.|$|E
25|$|The {{people of}} the coast, who are called Yligueynes, {{believed}} that the heaven and earth had no beginning {{and that there were}} two gods, one called Captan and the other Maguayen. They believed that the breeze and the sea were married; and that the land breeze brought forth a reed, which was planted by the god Captan. When the reed grew, it broke into two sections, from which came a man and a woman. To the man they gave the name Silalac, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> reason why men from that time on have been called lalac; the woman they named Sicavay, and henceforth women have been called babaye...|$|E
25|$|The {{placement}} delete {{functions are}} called from placement new expressions. In particular, {{they are called}} if the constructor of the object throws an exception. In such a circumstance, {{in order to ensure}} that the program does not incur a memory leak, the placement delete functions are called. A placement new expression first calls the placement operator new function, then calls the constructor of the object upon the raw storage returned from the allocator function. If the constructor throws an exception, it is necessary to deallocate that storage before propagating the exception back to the code that executed the placement new expression, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> purpose of the placement delete functions.|$|E

50|$|Foreshadowing: Frequently {{throughout}} the short story, <b>the</b> reader <b>is</b> given hints about that trouble which {{might come to}} Daru. The author says <b>that</b> <b>the</b> village <b>was</b> beginning to stir, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> reason for the transportation of the prisoner. Also, Daru hears sounds of footsteps around the schoolhouse, but nothing or no one materializes.|$|R
25|$|This {{leads to}} Maimonides’ notion that God cannot be {{described}} in any positive terms, but rather only in negative conceptions. The Jewish Encyclopedia notes his view that “As to His essence, {{the only way to}} describe it is negatively. For instance, He is not physical, nor bound by time, nor subject to change, etc. These assertions do not involve any incorrect notions or assume any deficiency, while if positive essential attributes are admitted it may be assumed that other things coexisted with Him from eternity.” Unrestrained anthropomorphism and perception of positive attributes is seen as a transgression as serious as idolatry, because both are fundamental errors in the metaphysics of God’s role in the universe, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> most important aspect of the world.|$|E
25|$|Strauss {{composed}} the opera to a German libretto, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> version {{that has become}} widely known. In 1907, Strauss made an alternate version in French (the language of the original Oscar Wilde play), which was used by Mary Garden, the world's most famous proponent of the role, when she sang the opera in New York, Chicago, Milwaukee, Paris, and other cities. Marjorie Lawrence sang the role both in French (for Paris) and in German (for the Metropolitan Opera, New York) in the 1930s. The French version is much less well known today, although it was revived in Lyon in 1990, and recorded by Kent Nagano with Karen Huffstodt {{in the title role}} and José van Dam as Jochanaan. In 2011, the French version was staged by Liège Opera, starring June Anderson.|$|E
25|$|While some whites {{responded with}} {{violence}} or exploitation of Mexicans, another recurring effort was Americanization. Since many Mexicans were now {{a part of}} the United States, it was expected that they would act like Americans. The national language in the U.S. is English, so it was thought that the Mexican Americans should be speaking English like the rest of Americans. In 1907, United States’ President Theodore Roosevelt wrote, “We have room for but one language in this country, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> English language, for we intend to see that the crucible turns our people out as Americans, of American nationality, and not as dwellers in a polyglot boarding house”. It was clear that a lot of Americans were hostile towards Spanish speaking Mexicans. The English Only movement is a political movement for establishing English as the only official language in the U.S., and using only English in official government operations. Learning a new language as an adult is a very difficult thing to do, so this effect of imperialism was challenging for a lot of new Americans.|$|E

25|$|An object either (1) is {{immediate}} to a sign, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> object {{as represented}} in the sign, or (2) is a dynamic object, which is the object as it really is, on which the immediate object is founded. Usually, an object in question, such as Hamlet or the planet Neptune, is a special or partial object. A sign's total object is the object's universe of discourse, the totality of things in that world to which one attributes the object. An interpretant is either (1) immediate to a sign, for example a word's usual meaning, a kind of interpretive quality or possibility present in the sign, or (2) dyanamic, an actual interpretant, for example a state of agitation, or (3) final or normal, a question's true settlement, which would be reached if thought or inquiry were pushed far enough, a kind of norm or ideal end with which any actual interpretant may, at most, coincide.|$|E
25|$|A second kind of {{experiment}} resembles the ordinary double-slit experiment. The schematic diagram of this experiment {{shows that a}} lens {{on the far side}} of the double slits makes the path from each slit diverge slightly from the other after they cross each other fairly near to that lens. The result is that at the two wavefunctions for each photon will be in superposition within a fairly short distance from the double slits, and if a detection screen is provided within the region wherein the wavefunctions are in superposition then interference patterns will be seen. There is no way by which any given photon could have been determined to have arrived from one or the other of the double slits. However, if the detection screen is removed the wavefunctions on each path will superimpose on regions of lower and lower amplitudes, and their combined probability values will be much less than the unreinforced probability values at the center of each path. When telescopes are aimed to intercept the center of the two paths, there will be equal probabilities of nearly 50% that a photon will show up in one of them. When a photon is detected by telescope 1, researchers may associate that photon with the wavefunction that emerged from the lower slit. When one is detected in telescope 2, researchers may associate that photon with the wavefunction that emerged from the upper slit. The explanation that supports this interpretation {{of experiment}}al results is that a photon has emerged from one of the slits, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> end of the matter. A photon must have started at the laser, passed through one of the slits, and arrived by a single straight-line path at the corresponding telescope.|$|E
