5|$|The {{election}} {{was held on}} 7 December 1860 in the Sheldonian Theatre. Three special trains were laid on between Didcot and Oxford that afternoon to meet passengers travelling from the west of England, and one <b>additional</b> <b>train</b> was provided between Oxford and London via Didcot in the evening. A London-bound train from the north of England called additionally at Bletchley to allow onward connections to Oxford for passengers from places such as Liverpool, Manchester and Birkenhead.

5|$|In 1969, {{ridership}} {{increased by}} 10 percent and by 12 percent the following year. In 1971 and 1972, it saw a 20-percent increase—the latter representing {{the first year}} with InterRail tickets. By then the annual ridership had reached 175,000. In 1970, an <b>additional</b> <b>train</b> was stationed at Flåm, which {{made it possible to}} travel a round trip between Flåm and Bergen in a day. Between 1975 and 1982, NSB started running direct trains between Ål and Flåm. In 1978, the morning express trains on the Bergen Line started stopping at Myrdal, allowing better access for tourists to the Flåm Line. Traffic increased further until 1980, when it hit 200,000, and then remained stable through the decade.|$|E

25|$|The {{train service}} during the Cornwall Railway {{years had been}} of five {{passenger}} trains each way daily, calling at all stations; there was an <b>additional</b> <b>train</b> each way in the summer months. As well as the stations themselves there were stops at ticket platforms at Truro and Falmouth, and the journey time was two hours 30 minutes Plymouth to Truro (53 miles) and a further half-hour to Falmouth (13 miles). (The service from Penzance to London was by through carriage, shunted from one train on to another.) For the time being, the Great Western Railway {{made no effort to}} improve the train service, and other issues dominated.|$|E
25|$|As the Røros Line lacks electrification, all trains {{operating}} on the line use diesel traction. This means that both express passenger and freight trains between Oslo and Trondheim use the Dovre Line. The main use of the Røros Line are regional passenger trains, operated using Class 92 and Class 93 diesel multiple units operated by the Norwegian State Railways. As of 2015 there are two through trains which run from Trondheim to Hamar, with a travel time of 6 hours. There is one <b>additional</b> <b>train</b> which runs once between Trondheim and Røros, taking 2 hours and 30 minutes, and four trains which run between Røros and Hamar, taking 3 hours and 20 minutes. Large parts of the day there are therefore a two-hour headway between Hamar and Røros.|$|E
25|$|Zürich {{is a mixed}} hub for railways, roads, and air traffic. Zürich Hauptbahnhof (Zürich HB) is {{the largest}} and busiest station in Switzerland and is an {{important}} railway hub in Europe. There are between 350,000 and 500,000 commuters daily making use of this central network node – a significant figure in comparison to Zürich's population. With regard {{to the number of}} trains daily entering and leaving a single railway station, Zürich HB is the world's most frequently served railway station, with 2915 trains every day. Among the 16 railway stations (and 10 <b>additional</b> <b>train</b> stops) within Zürich's city borders, there are five other major passenger railway stations. Three of them belong to the ten most frequented railway stations in Switzerland: Stadelhofen, Oerlikon, Altstetten, Hardbrücke, and Enge. The railway network is mainly operated by the Swiss Federal Railways (SBBCFFFFS), but Zürich is also served by major EuroCity trains from the neighbouring countries and is a destination for both French/Swiss (TGV Lyria) and German (ICE) high-speed trains, as well as by Austrian RailJet.|$|E

500|$|With {{the opening}} of the {{extension}} to Robertsbridge, there were three trains a day, with two on Sundays. These were augmented by an <b>additional</b> <b>train</b> daily when the extension to Bopeep Junction opened. In 1860, there were seven up trains and six down trains daily; Hastings to London via [...] taking two hours. From 1861, Cudworth 2-2-2 [...] "Little Mail" [...] class locomotives were introduced. In 1876, the Sub-Wealden Gypsum Co built a [...] long line from a junction south of Mountfield Tunnel to a gypsum mine located in Great Wood, Mountfield. This line was still in operation as of 2007. Bogie carriages entered service on the line in 1880. In 1890, the winter service was eleven trains each way, of which five were fast. An additional two trains daily operated between Tunbridge Wells and Wadhurst. By 1910, this had increased to [...] twenty trains each way, of which twelve were fast, plus the extra two Wadhurst services. Four trains ran on Sundays. The service was reduced during World War I, but Sunday services had increased to seven by 1922.|$|E

2500|$|As {{the first}} of the {{southbound}} freight evacuation trains approached, Andrews inquired of that train's conductor why his train was carrying a red marker flag on its rear car. [...] Andrews was told that Confederate Railway officials in Chattanooga had been notified by Confederate Army officials that Mitchel was approaching Chattanooga from Stevens, Alabama, intending to either capture or lay siege to the city, {{and as a result of}} this warning, the Confederate Military Railways had ordered the Special Freight movements. [...] The red train marker flag on the southbound train meant that there was at least one <b>additional</b> <b>train</b> behind the one which Andrews had just encountered, and that Andrews had no [...] "authority for movement" [...] until the last train of that sectional movement had passed him. This gave Fuller all the time he needed to close the distance.|$|E
2500|$|Virgin Trains {{put forward}} plans in 2007 to {{increase}} the line speed in places on the WCML– particularly along sections of the Trent Valley Line between Stafford and Rugby from 125 to 135mph (200 to 217km/h) after the quadrupling of track had been completed. This would permit faster services and possibly allow <b>additional</b> <b>train</b> paths. [...] was claimed to be achievable by Pendolino trains while using existing lineside signalling {{without the need for}} cab signalling via the use of the TASS system (Tilt Authorisation and Speed Supervision) to prevent overspeeding. In practice, regulations introduced by the HMRI (now ORR) {{at the time of the}} ECML high-speed test runs in 1991 are still in force prohibiting this. Network Rail was aware of Virgin Train's aspirations; however, in November 2009 Chris Mole MP (then Parliamentary Under Secretary of State, Transport) announced that there were no plans for this to happen and thus for the foreseeable future the maximum speed will remain at [...]|$|E
