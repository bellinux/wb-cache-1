40|$|Patterns of {{polarized}} light {{present in the}} clear dusk sky provide directional information relevant to the orientation behaviour of migratory birds. Experiments performed with white-throated sparrows (Zonotrichia albicollis) and <b>American</b> <b>tree</b> <b>sparrows</b> (Spizella arborea), North American night migrants, examined migratory orientation between the time of sunset and the first appearance of stars under several manipulations of skylight polarization patterns. Under clear skies, birds tested in Emlen funnel orientation cages oriented their hopping basically parallel to the E-vector of {{polarized light}}, with a bias towards the brightest {{part of the sky}} (sunset direction). Under solid, thick overcast conditions (no polarized light from the natural sky), birds showed axially bimodal hopping orientation parallel to an imposed E-vector. When birds were tested in cages covered with depolarizing material under a clear sky, their hopping orientation was seasonally appropriate and indistinguishable from controls viewing an unaltered clear sky. Skylight polarization patterns are not necessary for the occurrence of migratory orientation, but birds respond strongly to manipulations of the E-vector direction. The results reported here support the hypothesis that the relevant stimulus is the E-vector orientation rather than other parameters of skylight, e. g. intensity or colour patterns, degree of polarization. It appears that these night migrants are using skylight polarization at dusk as one of a set of multiple compass capabilities. Because of the necessarily artificial nature of the polarized light stimuli used in the experimental manipulations, it has not been possible to establish the relationship between this orientation cue and other known mechanisms (magnetic, sun and star compasses) ...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, Dept. of Biological SciencesIncludes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 35 - 39) West Nile Virus (WNV) {{first appeared}} in the western hemisphere in 1999, and has since spread across the United States and into Mexico and the Caribbean. It has been hypothesized that WNV has spread rapidly via migratory birds, and that various avian species may facilitate viral amplification during winter months. The goals of this research were to determine the role of <b>American</b> <b>Tree</b> <b>Sparrows</b> (Spizella americana) in the spread of WNV during their igrations and to determine the role of the Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) in winter survivorship and subsequent spring amplification of WNV. Additional wintering avian species were sampled to provide a general survey of the prevalence of WNV in winter in south-central Kansas. Blood samples were taken from the brachial vein of migratory and wintering birds captured using mist nets at four wintering feeding stations at the Wichita State University Field Station. Some samples were taken from retrapped birds within a single winter to determine if winter transmission occurs. Some birds were resampled in consecutive winters to monitor seroconversion rates. Analysis of serum samples were performed, in triplicate, using an epitope-blocking ELISA. The current study was conducted during the consecutive winters of 2003 - 04 and 2004 - 05. It was concluded that resident species had an increased incidence of WNV exposure when compared to that of migratory species. This difference suggests that migratory species may not have as important a role in the dissemination of WNV as first hypothesized. Also, minimal, if any, winter transmission occurs on communal feeding grounds. Viral amplification during the winter was not demonstrated, although one individual seroconverted during a single winter...|$|R

40|$|To {{explore the}} role of TH in the control of {{seasonality}} [i. e., photoperiodic testicular growth, photorefractoriness, and postnuptial (prebasic) molt] in <b>American</b> <b>tree</b> <b>sparrows</b> (Spizella arborea), we performed experiments in which THX males were simultaneously photostimulated and given TH replacement therapy. In the first experiment, equimolar concentrations (1 X = 1. 3 nmol) of T 4, T 3, or GC- 1, an iodine-free TRbeta agonist, were administered s. c. daily during the first 21 days of photostimulation. Two additional THX groups received GC- 1 at 0. 1 X or 10 X, and THX and THI control groups received vehicle. In the second experiment, T 4 or T 3, alone or {{in combination with the}} deiodinase inhibitor IOP, was injected i. m. twice daily during the first 14 days of photostimulation. In both experiments, end points were testis length and molt score. In the first experiment, THI birds given vehicle and THX birds given T 4 replacement therapy exhibited all three components of seasonality. THX birds given T 3 or GC- 1 (1 X or 10 X) showed a subdued photoperiodic testicular response, but they did not become photorefractory or initiate molt. THX birds that received 0. 1 X GC- 1 or vehicle exhibited none of the components of seasonality. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that photoperiodic testicular growth, a vernal component of seasonality, is a TRbeta-mediated response and suggest that T 4 may activate TRbeta more efficiently than does T 3 or GC- 1. By contrast, the failure both of T 3 and of GC- 1, but not of T 4, to program photostimulated THX males for photorefractoriness and postnuptial molt suggests that autumnal components of seasonality may be TRalpha-mediated responses solely to T 4. In the second experiment, IOP administered alone had no significant impact on seasonality. THX birds that received T 4 with or without IOP showed all components of seasonality, whereas birds that received T 3 with or without IOP showed only photoperiodic testicular growth. These results challenge the widely held view that T 4 is merely a prohormone for T 3 and support the emerging view that T 4 has intrinsic hormonal activity. Because IOP augmented the photoperiodic testicular response in T 3 -treated THX birds, T 3 may act either independently or co-dependently with T 4 in programming vernal seasonal events...|$|R

50|$|This {{species is}} carnivorous, {{typically}} feeding on small mammals, {{which make up}} 62-98% of its diet. Lemmings and voles are the major prey items of this species, seasonally comprising up to 80-90% of their prey, but this varies with seasonal availability. Some evidence suggests that these hawks {{may be able to}} see vole scent marks which are only visible in the ultraviolet range, allowing them to cue in on prey. Despite generally preying on rodents, a 2015 paper reported the species breeding on rodent-free Kolguev Island in Arctic Russia with goslings a main prey. The rough-legged hawk will also supplement its diet with mice, rats, gerbils, pikas and insects. Besides mammals, birds are the second most favored type of prey for rough-legs. Most avian prey species are small passerines such as snow buntings (Plectrophenax nivalis), Lapland longspur (Calcarius lapponicus) and <b>American</b> <b>tree</b> <b>sparrow</b> (Spizelloides arborea). However, they will also prey on birds slightly larger than the passerines typically targeted, especially ptarmigan (Lagopus ssp.), as well as waterfowl, shorebirds (such as ruffs (Philomachus pugnax)) and short-eared owls (Asio flammeus). They usually target bird prey which are young and inexperienced, with relatively large avian prey often being snatched in their fledging stage. When small mammals are scarce, the rough-legged hawk will also feed on larger, medium-sized mammals including prairie dogs (Cynomys ssp.), ground squirrels, muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus), weasels (Mustela ssp.) and even adult black-tailed jackrabbits (Lepus californicus) of approximately twice their own weight. During winter, shrub-steppe habitats seem to encourage a strong dependence on rabbit prey. In developed areas of England, wintering rough-legged buzzards have been recorded preying most regularly on relatively large prey such as common wood pigeon (Columba palumbus) and invasive European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus).|$|E

Dark-eyed juncos, which had the highest frequency song, had the lowest ABR thresholds at higher frequencies, whereas the house finch, which had the lowest frequency song, had the lowest ABR thresholds at the lower frequencies. Peak frequency of the vocalization was slightly higher than peak auditory sensitivity in all three species as has been observed in other auditory-vocalization matching studies.

Various studies have shown impacts of seismic lines on vegetation, but the effects on bird abundance in the Arctic are poorly known. We evaluated the impact of new (0. 5 – 1. 5 years old) and old (10 – 35 years old) visible seismic lines within the sanctuary on the abundance of breeding passerines (savannah sparrow, Passerculus sandwichensis; Lapland longspur, Calcarius lapponicus; common redpoll, Carduelis flammea; <b>American</b> <b>tree</b> <b>sparrow,</b> Spizella arborea; and red-necked phalarope, Phalaropus lobatus) in upland tundra, low-centre polygon, and sedge/willow habitats. Along new seismic lines, effects on abundance were not statistically significant for most groups of birds, although the trend in most habitats was for more birds on reference transects than on seismic lines. Significant impacts were found for passerines grouped in upland tundra and for savannah sparrow in sedge/willow. The latter effect (possibly due to standing water along the line) was not significant the following year. Along old seismic lines, abundance of passerines was lower than on reference transects in upland tundra and low-centre polygon habitat, except for Lapland longspurs in upland tundra. Lines created 10 – 30 years ago have persistent vegetative changes and this appears to have reduced bird abundance. Although we did not plot individual territories, birds were seen crossing the seismic lines and sometimes perched on them, suggesting that they were not avoiding the lines altogether. Instead, these birds may have increased territory size to compensate for vegetative changes along the lines.

40|$|There were 11 Christmas Bird Counts {{conducted}} in Nebraska in December of 2003. One (the DeSoto National Wildlife Refuge count) is partly in Iowa. The total of 132 species recorded is 5 fewer {{than last year}} 2 ̆ 7 s total of 137. This year 222, 405 individuals were counted, {{as compared to the}} unusually high individual count of 303, 619 in 2002, largely because of Snow Goose numbers. In 2002, 129, 415 Snow Geese were reported, compared to this year 2 ̆ 7 s report of 10, 940. There were 16 species which were seen on every count: Bald Eagle, Red-tailed Hawk, American Kestrel, Ring-necked Pheasant, Rock Pigeon, Downy Woodpecker, Northern Flicker, Blue Jay, American Crow, Black-capped Chickadee, European Starling, <b>American</b> <b>Tree</b> <b>Sparrow,</b> Dark-eyed Junco, Red-winged Blackbird, American Goldfmch, and House Sparrow. This year 183 field counters and 16 feeder watchers participated in the counts. The weather was slightly warmer than average, with two counts beginning the day in the single digits and eight counts fmishing the day in the 402 ̆ 7 s or 502 ̆ 7 s. Weather prior to the counts had been mild also, although most parts of the state were unusually dry throughout the summer and fall. The western part of the state was still experiencing a serious drought. No Common Loons, Pied-billed Grebes or Double-crested Cormorants, all species which have shown up on about half of the counts in the past decade, were reported this year. Although the total number of Snow Geese was way down, as mentioned above, Lake McConaughy had an unusually high number of Snows: 7200. Other geese made good showings around the state. The Greater White-fronted total of 65 and the Ross 2 ̆ 7 Goose total of 24 were the highest since 1998. Trumpeter Swans were reported at two counts (Lake McConaughy and Calamus-Loup), but the past four years have seen a downtrend: 39 in 2000, 26 in 2001, 13 in 2002 and 8 in 2003...|$|E

5|$|The immune {{response}} of <b>tree</b> <b>sparrows</b> is less robust {{than that of}} the house sparrow and has been proposed as a factor in the greater invasive potential of the latter. The house <b>sparrow</b> and <b>tree</b> <b>sparrow</b> are the most frequent victims of roadkill on the roads of Central, Eastern and Southern Europe. The maximum recorded age is 13.1 years, but three years is a typical lifespan.|$|R
500|$|The Eurasian <b>tree</b> <b>sparrow's</b> {{binomial}} name {{is derived}} from two Latin words: passer, [...] "sparrow", and montanus, [...] "of the mountains" [...] (from mons [...] "mountain"). The Eurasian <b>tree</b> <b>sparrow</b> was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 Systema Naturae as Fringilla montana, but, along with the house sparrow, it was soon moved from the finches (family Fringillidae) into the new genus Passer created by French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760. The Eurasian <b>tree</b> <b>sparrow's</b> common name is given because of its preference of tree holes for nesting. This name, and the scientific name montanus, do not appropriately describe this species's habitat preferences: the German name Feldsperling ("field sparrow") comes closer to doing so.|$|R
