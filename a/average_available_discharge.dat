40|$|A Lithium-ion Verification and Validation Program {{with the}} purpose to assess the {{capabilities}} of current aerospace lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery cells to perform in a low-earth-orbit (LEO) regime was initiated in 2002. This program involves extensive characterization and LEO life testing at ten different combinations of depth-of-discharge, temperature, and end-of-charge voltage. The test conditions selected for the life tests are defined {{as part of a}} statistically designed test matrix developed {{to determine the effects of}} operating conditions on performance and life of Li-ion cells. Results will be used to model and predict cell performance and degradation as a function of test operating conditions. Testing is being performed at the Naval Surface Warfare Center/Crane Division in Crane, Indiana. Testing was initiated in September 2004 with 40 Ah cells from Saft and 30 Ah cells from Lithion. The test program has been expanded with the addition of modules composed of 18650 cells from ABSL Power Solutions in April 2006 and the addition of 50 Ah cells from Mine Safety Appliances Co. (MSA) in June 2006. Preliminary results showing the average voltage and <b>average</b> <b>available</b> <b>discharge</b> capacity for the Saft and Lithion packs at the test conditions versus cycles are presented...|$|E
30|$|From Figure 12, it is {{observed}} that the <b>average</b> <b>available</b> bandwidth is more for SAW compared to TOPSIS, MEW and FUZZY approaches for the streaming and background traffic classes. Although MEW and FUZZY give nearly the same bandwidth performance, compared to the other two methods their performance is moderate. TOPSIS gives poor performance in all the cases. Till 3 min of average connection lifetime, the <b>average</b> <b>available</b> bandwidth is 1750 – 2250 kbps for SAW and 700 – 1200 kbps for FUZZY. However, above 3 min of average connection lifetime, the <b>average</b> <b>available</b> bandwidth maintains steady value for FUZZY while for SAW it decays rapidly to 1400 kbps. Till 3 – 4 min of average connection lifetime, the <b>average</b> <b>available</b> bandwidth is 900 – 1400 kbps for MEW in streaming, interactive, and background kind of applications while it is 1300 – 1700 kbps in conversational traffic. Whereas, the <b>average</b> <b>available</b> bandwidth is 1100 – 500 kbps in TOPSIS for all kind of applications. Above 4 min of average connection lifetime the <b>average</b> <b>available</b> bandwidth nearly maintains steady value for MEW, and TOPSIS.|$|R

We find that Italy is behind {{compared to the other}} OECD countries in both broadband penetration rate and <b>average</b> <b>available</b> speed. The main determinants of this delay are the scarce diffusion of PCs and the persistently low ICT alphabetization of the Italian population, the geographical and density characteristics of the country as well as strategic factors (market structure and bureaucratic constraints).

40|$|A simple, {{dimensionally}} sound, {{formula is}} proposed for expressing the apparent shear {{stress on the}} vertical interface between main channel and flood plain in a compound channel. An apparent friction factor is introduced and its dependence on the cross-section shape is examined based on experimental results reported in previous studies. For symmetrical smooth channels, {{it is found that}} this friction factor is essentially independent of the flow depth and is well linearly correlated with the width ratio of the compound section, at least within the ranges of practical interest where data are <b>available.</b> <b>Discharge</b> estimates obtained by incorporating the predicted shear stress in the φ{symbol}-index method compare well with experimental results. The suggested approach is sufficiently accurate for practical applications and may be extended to other channel shapes and roughnesses depending on the acquisition of adequate data. © 1992 Kluwer Academic Publishers...|$|R
40|$|Our aim is {{to produce}} a world map of flooded areas for a 100 year return period, using a method based on large rivers peak flow {{estimates}} derived from mean monthly discharge time-series. Therefore, the map is supposed to represent flooding that affects large river floodplains, but not events triggered by specific conditions like coastal or flash flooding for instance. We first generate for each basin a set of hydromorphometric, land cover and climatic variables. In case of an <b>available</b> <b>discharge</b> record station at the basin outlet, we base the hundred year peak flow estimate on the corresponding time-series. Peak flow magnitude for basin outlets without gauging stations is estimated by statistical means, performing several regressions on the basin variables.

The results indicate that Li-ions intercalate into the cathodes lattice during ageing thus decreasing the <b>available</b> <b>discharge</b> capacity. Analysis of electron diffraction patterns of LiCoO_ 2 and LiMn_ 2 O_ 4 retrieved from the cathodes after ageing shows that irreversible crystallographic transformations {{have taken place in}} both electrodes.

40|$|Lithium-Sulfur (Li-S) {{batteries}} are an emerging energy storage technology, which is technically-attractive {{due to its}} high theoretical limits; practically, {{it is expected that}} Li-S batteries will result into lighter energy storage devices with higher capacities than traditional Lithium-ion batteries. One of the actual disadvantages for this technology is the highly pronounced rate capacity effect, which reduces the available capacity to be discharged when high currents are used. This drawback might be addressed by the use of the capacity recovery effect, which by introducing relaxation periods between consecutive pulse discharges of the battery, increases the <b>available</b> <b>discharge</b> capacity of the cell. The capacity recovery effect of the Li-S cell is studied in this paper using the pulse discharge technique, considering its dependence on the applied current, discharge step length, temperature, and on the length of the relaxation period between the discharging pulses...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Licensed but unutilized {{television}} (TV) band spec-trum {{is called}} as TV white {{space in the}} literature. Ultra high frequency (UHF) TV band spectrum has very good wireless radio propagation characteristics. The amount of TV white space in the UHF TV band in India is of interest. Comprehensive quantitative assessment and estimates for the TV white space in the 470 - 590 MHz band for four zones of India (all except north) are presented in this work. This is the first effort in India to estimate TV white spaces in a comprehensive manner. The <b>average</b> <b>available</b> TV white space per unit area in these four zones is calculated using two methods: (i) the primary (licensed) user and secondary (unlicensed) user point of view; and, (ii) the regulations of Federal Communications Commission in the United States. By both methods, the <b>average</b> <b>available</b> TV white space in the UHF TV band is shown {{to be more than}} 100 MHz! A TV transmitter frequency-reassignment algorithm is also described. Based on spatial-reuse ideas, a TV channel allocation scheme is presented which results in insignicant interference to the TV receivers while using the least number of TV channels for transmission across the four zones. Based on this reassignment, it is found that four TV band channels (or 32 MHz) are sufficient to provide the existing UHF TV band coverage in India. I...|$|R

Various batteries were discharged galvanostatically and their cathodes were analyzed. We observe a particle density gradient along the cathode that scales with the current density applied. Besides, we show that the particle {{size and shape of}} discharge product strongly depend on current density, and on whether the particles are deposited close to the oxygen reservoir or near the separator. We correlate our findings to transport limitations for the supplied oxygen and gain crucial information for optimal operation of sodium-oxygen batteries. Our findings imply that for low current densities pore clogging might occur, and that for elevated current densities small high surface area particles with limited electric conductivity form; both phenomena can decrease the <b>available</b> <b>discharge</b> and charge capacity significantly...|$|R

40|$|Medical {{problems}} left unresolved during hospitalizations (along with recommended outpatient evaluations, {{test results}} pending at discharge, and discharge medication regimens) are often documented in patients’ discharge summaries. However, {{studies have demonstrated}} that discharge summaries are frequently unavailable or inaccessible at post discharge visit(s). Interim discharge summaries have been shown to improve the flow of information between inpatient and outpatient physicians. We have constructed a web-based solution, discharge communiqués that are very much like interim discharge summaries but are an automatic byproduct of an every day workflow process, signout. The New SignOut System captures signout information and generates discharge communiqués immediately upon discharge. From June 2002 -January 2003 7926 discharge communiqués were made available on 7926 patients and there were 12, 920 look-ups of communiqués.

40|$|Estimates {{of future}} changes in {{extremes}} of multiday precipitation sums {{are critical for}} estimates of future discharge extremes of large river basins. Here we use a large ensemble of global climate model SRES A 1 b scenario simulations to estimate changes in extremes of 1 – 20 day precipitation sums over the Rhine basin, projected for the period 2071 – 2100 with reference to 1961 – 1990. We find that in winter, an increase of order 10 %, for the 99 th percentile precipitation sum, is approximately fixed across the selected range of multiday sums, whereas in summer, the changes become increasingly negative as the summation time lengthens. Explanations for these results are presented that have implications for simple scaling methods for creating time series of a future climate. We show that the dependence of quantile changes on summation time is sensitive to the ensemble size and indicate that currently <b>available</b> <b>discharge</b> estimates from previous studies are based on insufficiently long time series...|$|R
40|$|The {{determination}} of internal electrical discharge parameters, such as plasma current and burning voltage, in dielectric barrier discharges (DBDs) relies on an equivalent circuit based on series capacitances for the discharge gap and dielectric material.

Here, we report measurements of the effective dielectric capacitance as a function of applied voltage amplitude in a DBD plasma jet system operating in N 2 and derive equations to determine the conductively transferred charge, burning voltage and the proportion of the electrode surface over which discharging occurs when the effective dielectric capacitance is not equal to the dielectric capacitance of the complete electrode area...|$|R
