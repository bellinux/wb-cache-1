Germany had colonised the northeastern part of New Guinea and several nearby island groups in 1884, and the colony was currently used as a wireless radio base, Britain required the wireless installations to be destroyed because they were used by the German East Asia Squadron which threatened merchant shipping in the region. The objectives of the force were the German stations at Yap in the Caroline Islands, Nauru, and Rabaul in New Britain. On 30 August 1914, the AN left Sydney {{under the protection of}} Australia and Melbourne for Port Moresby, where the force met the Queensland contingent, aboard the transport HMAHS Kanowna. The force then sailed for German New Guinea on 7 September, leaving Kanowna behind when her stokers refused to work. Sydney and her escorting destroyers met the AN off the eastern tip of New Guinea. Melbourne was detached to destroy the wireless station on Nauru, while on 14 September, Encounter bombarded a ridge near Rabaul, while half a battalion advanced towards the town. The only major loss of the campaign was the disappearance of the submarine AE1 during a patrol off Rabaul on 14 September 1914.|$|E

5|$|Glenn was {{considered}} an expert in matters {{in science and technology}} due to his background. He was a supporter of continuing the B-1 bomber program, which he considered successful. This conflicted with President Carter's desire to fund the B-2 bomber program. Glenn did not fully support development of the B-2 because he had doubts about the feasibility of the stealth technology. Glenn joined the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 1978. He became the chairman of the East <b>Asian</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pacific</b> Affairs Subcommittee, for which he traveled to Japan, Korea, the Republic of China, and the People's Republic of China. Glenn helped to pass the Taiwan Enabling Act of 1979. In 1979, another dispute Glenn had with President Carter was Glenn's stance on the SALT II treaty. He did not believe that the U.S. had the capability to monitor the Soviet Union accurately enough to verify compliance with the treaty. During the launching ceremony for the , he spoke about his doubts about verifying treaty compliance. First Lady Rosalynn Carter also spoke at the event, during which she criticized Glenn for speaking publicly about the issue.

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of controlled and uncontrolled hypertension in the United States is lower for persons ethnically classified as <b>Asian,</b> particularly Japanese <b>and</b> excepting Filipinos, {{than for the}} general population. In this study, measurements of blood pressure were taken of 8, 353 adults living in California, including 1, 757 <b>Asians</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pacific</b> Islanders, <b>and</b> the subjects were asked six questions concerning high blood pressure. The results show that <b>Asians</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pacific</b> Islanders with hypertension, in comparison with hypertensive persons of other races, {{were less likely to}} be aware of their hypertension, to be under treatment with medication, and to be controlling their blood pressure; similarly, they had their blood pressure measured less frequently and visited physicians less often. Compared with the general population, <b>Asians</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pacific</b> Islanders were less knowledgeable about hypertension. In relation to health care, they recorded lower frequencies of hospital stays, days of bed disabilities, and days of not feeling well than persons of other races. <b>Asians</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pacific</b> Islanders' lower treatment rates and knowledge level concerning hypertension may be related to the fact that a high percentage are foreign-born. Consequently, they have been taught less about hypertension, rely more on traditional methods of medicine, and are hampered by the lack of availability of health care providers of their own ethnic background. In addition, Filipinos have experienced high levels of poverty and lack of education. These factors require additional study as part of efforts to help improve health care for these ethnic groups in the United States...|$|R
