40|$|At present, Panel-Based <b>Alarm</b> <b>Annunciator</b> <b>System</b> for the {{existing}} 130 Mev AVF cyclotron of our centre {{is used to}} draw the attention to the operator only for the 64 Nos. of top-level alarms. The lower level faults, which cause the top level alarm, are not visible from the control panel. Moreover, huge amount of maintenance cost and manpower is involved in keeping the system alive. To alleviate these problems, one PC-Based <b>Alarm</b> <b>Annunciator</b> <b>System</b> has been developed using C++ [1] under WIN-NT. A PC plug-in card from ADVANTECH [2] {{is used for the}} Input/Output (I/O) interface. The 64 top level alarms are displayed on the screen using buttons with pre-defined names and different colors are used to indicate the systemâ€™s status; e. g. RED for fault, GREEN for O. K. and BLINKING with AUDIO for alarms. Lower level alarms can be displayed with a mouse click on the top-level alarm button. The system keeps records of different parameters with time stamp in a database. The facility to monitor the on-line status of the alarms over the network, through WWW browser is also incorporated. The system is working satisfactorily and will be connected with the main system shortly. ...|$|E

40|$|The primary {{responsibility}} of an {{intrusion detection system}} (IDS) operator is to monitor the system, assess alarms, and summon and coordinate the response team when a threat is acknowledged. The tools currently provided to the operator are somewhat limited: monitors must be switched, keystrokes must be entered to call up intrusion sensor data, and communication with the response force must be maintained. The Virtual tower is an operator interface assembled from low-cost commercial-off-the-shelf hardware and software; it enables large amounts of data to be displayed in a virtual manner that provides instant recognition for the operator and increases assessment accuracy in <b>alarm</b> <b>annunciator</b> and control <b>systems.</b> This is accomplished by correlating and fusing the data into a 360 -degree visual representation that employs color, auxiliary attributes, video, and directional audio to prompt the operator. The Virtual Tower would be a valuable low-cost enhancement to existing systems...|$|R

5000|$|Over {{the last}} five years the <b>Alarm</b> <b>Annunciator</b> has seen a {{resurgence}} in popularity especially for use in IEC61508 SIL 1 and SHE (Safety Health and Environmental) alarm monitoring applications. [...] The modern trend is to identify critical alarms and return them from the computer screen to discrete alarm windows. This is being done for two reasons. Firstly, <b>alarm</b> <b>annunciators</b> offer pattern recognition to the operators in the form of LED alarm fascias instead of just providing an exhaustive list of alarms and events which the operators have to scroll through and in some instances alarms can be overlooked. Secondly, the analysis of plant failure modes is leading to the separation of critical alarm monitoring and process control systems for safety reasons.|$|R

40|$|Exciting new {{safeguards}} {{and security}} technologies {{are on the}} horizon, and some are even on the shelves today. Self-testing sensors, smart sensors, and intelligent alarm analyzers are all designed to provide useful information to the operator. However, today`s current <b>annunciator</b> <b>systems</b> were not designed to accommodate these new technologies. New display technologies are also changing {{the look and feel}} of the annunciator of the future. Annunciator technology needs to ``catch up` to these other security technologies. This paper presents the concept for a new, object-oriented approach to annunciator architecture design. The new architecture could accommodate simple, switch-closure devices as well as information- rich sensors and intelligent analyzers. In addition the architecture could allow other leading-edge interfaces to be easily integrated into the <b>annunciator</b> <b>system.</b> These technologies will reduce operator workload and aid the operator in making informed security decisions. 3 refs., 2 figs...|$|R

40|$|This {{test report}} {{documents}} {{the results obtained}} while conducting operational testing of the sampling equipment in the 225 -WC building, the PFP Wastewater Sampling Facility. The Wastewater Sampling Facility houses equipment to sample and monitor the PFP`s liquid effluents before discharging the stream to the 200 Area Treated Effluent Disposal Facility (TEDF). The majority of the streams are not radioactive and discharges from the PFP Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC). The streams that might be contaminated are processed through the Low Level Waste Treatment Facility (LLWTF) before discharging to TEDF. The sampling equipment consists of two flow-proportional composite samplers, an ultrasonic flowmeter, pH and conductivity monitors, chart recorder, and associated relays and current isolators to interconnect the equipment to allow proper operation. Data signals from the monitors are received in the 234 - 5 Z Shift Office which contains a chart recorder and <b>alarm</b> <b>annunciator</b> panel.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Human {{attention}} is generally the most limited resource in any human-machine <b>system.</b> From <b>annunciator</b> <b>systems</b> in {{nuclear power plants}} to highlighted links on webpages, the prime task of the designer is directing the user's attention to the right places. According to feature integration theory, important symbols can be designed to "pop-out" from a field of distractor objects due to pre-attentive processing. (Triesman 1986). This theory has spawned numerous follow-up studies to attempt to isolate features that are pre-attentive (Ware 2000). Unlike artificial displays that have single parameters with definable set points, open scenes lack easy criteria for directing attention. Capturing Attention is particularly difficult in open scenes such as detailed aerial photographs, wide angle/multiple video feeds, or high-resolution digital imagery. Moreover, open scenes {{tend to have more}} ambiguity since information is compiled from sensors rather than synthetically fabricated. If un...|$|R

25|$|For {{compatibility}} with manual offices, {{two types of}} signaling were supported. In areas with mostly machine switches and a few manual switchboards, Panel Call Indicator (PCI) signaling lit lamps on the B operator's desk at the terminating manual office. The lamps illuminated digits on a display panel corresponding to the number dialed. The manual operator connected the call to the appropriate jack, and then repeated the process for the next incoming call. In areas with mostly manual switches, the Call <b>Annunciator</b> signaling <b>system</b> was used to avoid installing lamp panels at every operator station. The Call Annunciator used speech recorded on strips of photographic film to verbally announce the called number to the answering operator.|$|R

40|$|A Distributive Process Control {{system was}} {{purchased}} by Project B- 534, `` 242 -A Evaporator/Crystallizer Upgrades``. This control system, called the Monitor and Control System (MCS), was installed in the 242 -A Evaporator located in the 200 East Area. The purpose of the MCS is to monitor and control the Evaporator and monitor a number of alarms and other signals from various Tank Farm facilities. Applications software for the MCS {{was developed by the}} Waste Treatment Systems Engineering (WTSE) group of Westinghouse. The standard displays and alarm scheme provide for control and monitoring, but do not directly indicate the signal location or depict the overall process. To do this, WTSE developed a second alarm scheme which uses special programs, annunciator keys, and process graphics. The special programs are written in two languages; Sequence and Batch Language (SABL), and ``C`` language. The WTSE-developed alarm scheme works as described below: SABL relates signals and <b>alarms</b> to the <b>annunciator</b> keys, called SKID keys. When an alarm occurs, a SABL program causes a SKID key to flash, and if the alarm is of yellow or white priority then a ``C`` program turns on an audible horn (the D/ 3 system uses a different audible horn for the red priority alarms). The horn and flashing key draws the attention of the operator...|$|R
