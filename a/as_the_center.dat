50|$|Various {{methods have}} been used to train RBF networks. One {{approach}} first uses K-means clustering to find cluster centers which are then used <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>centers</b> for <b>the</b> RBF functions. However, K-means clustering is computationally intensive and it often does not generate the optimal number of centers. Another approach is to use a random subset of <b>the</b> training points <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>centers.</b>|$|R
5|$|A {{detailed}} topographic {{analysis of}} the Hawaiian – Emperor seamount chain reveals the hotspot <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of a topographic high, and that elevation falls with distance from the hotspot. The most rapid decrease in elevation and the highest ratio between the topography and geoid height are over the southeastern part of the chain, falling with distance from the hotspot, particularly {{at the intersection of}} the Molokai and Murray fracture zones. The most likely explanation is that the region between the two zones is more susceptible to reheating than most of the chain. Another possible explanation is that the hotspot strength swells and subsides over time.|$|E
5|$|After {{becoming}} a tropical cyclone, the depression {{turned to a}} northwest motion before resuming a track to the west-northwest. On May7 it intensified into a deep depression, and though its winds had increased, the structure became disorganized <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> became exposed from the thunderstorm activity. The convection waned, due {{to the influence of}} dry air from the Arabian Peninsula, as well as from wind shear. As a result, the IMD downgraded it to depression status early on May8. However, later in the day, convection redeveloped over the western half of the circulation, and it again reached deep depression status, about 830km (515mi) southeast of Oman.|$|E
5|$|By July7, most of {{the deep}} {{convection}} associated with Blanca had dissipated, and the remaining convection was confined to an outer band southeast of the center. Later that day, the system was barely holding on to tropical storm intensity <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> became devoid of shower and thunderstorm activity. A brief burst in convection allowed Blanca to maintain 40mph (65km/h) winds, minimal tropical storm intensity, for several more hours before being downgraded to a tropical depression.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane {{warnings}} {{were put}} in effect for six provinces in southeastern Cuba, where significant precipitation ranging up to 20inches (500mm) across the mountainous south was expected <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of Ernesto tracked slowly across Cuba. Cuban officials evacuated 300,000people and brought its fishing fleet into harbors. The Cuban state television broadcast extensive warnings about the storm, urging precautions. Cattle were moved to higher ground, tourists were evacuated from hotels in the southeastern province of Granma, and baseball games scheduled for the evening of August 27 in Havana were played earlier in the day. The threat of the storm caused domestic flights to be canceled.|$|E

5|$|Later on March 12, {{thunderstorms}} reformed {{over the}} center, as its movement became nearly stationary {{due to a}} ridge to its south and northwest. Early on March 13, it began a steady movement to the northwest, and its organization increased with an eye re-appearing; after briefly re-attaining tropical cyclone status, Jokwe again weakened to tropical storm status due to persistent wind shear. Convection continued to diminish, and on March 14 Jokwe weakened to tropical depression status <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> became almost fully exposed. Early on March 15, the MFR issued its last advisory on the system. The remnants accelerated southeastward and dissipated on March 16 to the southwest of Madagascar.|$|E

5|$|Lima flourished {{during the}} 17th century <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of an {{extensive}} trade network which integrated the Viceroyalty of Peru with the Americas, Europe and the Far East. Its merchants channeled Peruvian silver through the nearby port of Callao and exchanged it for imported goods at the trade fair of Portobelo in modern-day Panama. This practice was sanctioned by law as all trade from the Viceroyalty {{was required to}} go through Callao {{on its way to}} and from overseas markets. The resulting economic prosperity of the city was reflected in its rapid growth, population expanded from about 25,000 in 1619 to an estimated 80,000 in 1687.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} Lima, {{the capital of}} Peru, began with its {{foundation}} by Francisco Pizarro on January 18, 1535. The city was established on {{the valley of the}} Rímac River in an area populated by the Ichma polity. It became the capital of the Viceroyalty of Peru and site of a Real Audiencia in 1543. In the 17th century, the city prospered <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of an extensive trade network despite damage from earthquakes and the threat of pirates. However, prosperity came to an end in the 18th century due to an economic downturn and the Bourbon Reforms.|$|E
5|$|The section {{addressing}} God as Father and Son {{is again}} a duet, {{this time of}} soprano I and tenor. The voices are often in canon and in parallel, as in the Christe. The movement is likely another parody, possibly from the 1729 cantata Ihr Häuser des Himmels, BWV 193a. As the Christe, it is a love-duet addressing Jesus. Both duets appear <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of the symmetry within the respective part, Kyrie and Gloria. Here an obbligato flute opens a concerto with the orchestra and introduces material that the voices pick up.|$|E

5|$|After peak intensity, the cyclone's eye {{soon began}} to fill and cool as {{weakening}} ensued. Defying previous forecasts, Hellen continued on a southeasterly track toward Madagascar {{and the likelihood of}} it making landfall became apparent. By the end of March30, Hellen's eye had collapsed and disappeared from satellite imagery, as the combination of dry air and land interaction took their toll on the storm. At about 0800UTC on March31, Hellen made landfall on Mitsinjo, and the previously unfavorable conditions coupled with land interaction to induce rapid weakening. The ridge to the east turned Hellen to a southwest drift over land. By early on April1, the convection largely dissipated <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> became difficult to locate, with peak winds dropping to 45km/h (30mph). As a result, Météo-France discontinued advisories that day, as did the JTWC. The remnants moved back over open waters, but were not expected to reorganize due to the poor nature of the convection. As the low continued to the west, the convection increased on April4 while approaching the coastline of Mozambique, although the system failed to redevelop before moving onshore.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans was a {{guest in}} a Serbian highlander family {{in the region of}} Krivošije, Montenegrin Littoral. Analyzing the practices, he {{concluded}} that the badnjak customs were connected with ancestor worship. The lighting of the log on the ognjište could be seen as a solemn annual rekindling of the sacred hearth fire, regarded <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of the family life and the seat of the ancestors. The belief that ancestral spirits dwell in the domestic hearth was attested among Slavic and other peoples. Fire worship in the old Slavic religion was mostly transformed into the cult of domestic fire, and thus joined with ancestor worship. A trace of sacrifice to the fire is the coin thrown into it by the polaznik after the ritual of making sparks fly from the badnjak.|$|E
