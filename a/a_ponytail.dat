5|$|File:Paolo Ucello 001.jpg|A Young Lady of Fashion is {{attributed}} to the Florentine painter and mathematician Paolo Uccello and dates early 1460s. The young lady has plucked her hairline to increase the expanse, and thus elegance, of her forehead, and a lock of hair falls at the back in <b>a</b> <b>ponytail.</b> A tight-fitting cap covers her ears, a fashion possibly due to the prevalent belief {{of the time that}} the Virgin Mary conceived through the ear.|$|E
5|$|Krusty is {{inspired}} {{to return to}} doing low-key events, where he structures a new image for himself as a stand-up comedian who tells the truth, criticizes commercialism, and refuses to sell out to corporate America. He also changes his appearance, sporting a dark sweater and tying his hair in <b>a</b> <b>ponytail.</b> Observing his newfound popularity, two marketing executives try to persuade Krusty to endorse a new sport utility vehicle called the Canyonero. Although he tries to resist, he eventually succumbs to the lure of money. After promoting the Canyonero at a comedy performance in Moe's Tavern, he is booed off stage by the patrons. He finally admits to himself that comedy is not in his blood and selling out is. The episode ends with an extended advertisement for the Canyonero, as Krusty and Bart leave Moe's tavern in Krusty's new SUV.|$|E
5|$|Prior to her infestation, Kerrigan is {{described}} as being a graceful and deadly woman, exceedingly agile and athletic, possessing jade-green eyes and brilliant red hair usually worn as <b>a</b> <b>ponytail.</b> The novel Queen of Blades describes her facial features as being too strong to be classified as beautiful, but instead as striking and completely fitting for her personality. Kerrigan is rarely seen out of her armor, a form-fitting hostile environment suit specifically designed for Ghost operatives and equipped with a personal cloaking device, but when off-duty, she {{is described}} as wearing a soft work shirt, worn cotton pants with a dusty leather jacket, and high leather boots. Even then, it is uncommon for Kerrigan to be unarmed: she is always equipped {{with at least a}} combat knife.|$|E

25|$|Al Pacino as Carlito Brigante. Pacino came to Carlito's Way {{directly}} from his Oscar-winning role in Scent of a Woman. To {{get into the}} character, he accompanied Torres through East Harlem. There he could absorb the sights and atmosphere. Pacino first envisioned Carlito with <b>a</b> <b>ponytail.</b> But after his visits to Harlem he quickly realized the guys there were not into wearing their hair that way. The beard was Pacino's idea. The black leather coat just fit into the period setting.|$|E

25|$|Fujishima was {{responsible}} for designing eight characters including Ogami and Sakura, along with formal and casual clothes, and accessories. The supporting cast was designed by Hidenori Matsubara. Matsubara also helped with general animation. As the character concepts had been firmly established before the design stage, Fujishima was able to create the characters with ease, creating them so players could easily understand {{what was going through}} their minds. Due to the game's Taishō period setting, Fujishima needed to stop himself from adding anachronistic elements such as fasteners. Hiroi made character sheets for each character, which Fujisaka used to create each character and their various designs, noting Sumire as a character whose personality was communicated through her clothes. Each character had distinct traits, such as <b>a</b> <b>ponytail</b> and hakama kimono for Sakura, so Kujishima simply combined these elements with his own design ideas. The Taishō period meant that Fujishima could combine traditional Japanese clothing with Western accessories such as shoes, allowing the female characters an otherwise improbable range of movement. His design for each main protagonist—from Ogami to the Flower Division members—directly mirrored Hiroi's concepts for them. The Flower Division's battle dress was modeled after tuxedos, and compared by Kujishima with the costumes of the Takarazuka Revue.|$|E

500|$|Viking Age stylized silver amulets {{depicting}} women wearing long gowns, {{their hair}} pulled back and knotted into <b>a</b> <b>ponytail,</b> sometimes bearing [...] drinking horns, have been discovered throughout Scandinavia. These figures are commonly considered to represent valkyries or dísir. According to Mindy MacLeod and Bernard Mees, the amulets appear in Viking Age graves, and were presumably placed there because [...] "they were thought to have protective powers".|$|E

Irvine is depicted as a cowboy, tall and fair-skinned with long brown hair that he wears pulled back in <b>a</b> <b>ponytail.</b> He also enjoys flirting with the female characters, being known as well for his marksmanship as his charm. He acts like a carefree, but misunderstood loner; however, this is merely a façade to charm women and hide his lack of confidence.|$|E
500|$|According to Greaney, the animators {{originally}} designed future Bart as [...] "cool and fun" [...] and made several designs {{where he was}} [...] "slim, attractive, and hip." [...] Greaney did not think any of these designs {{went along with the}} personality he and the other the writers had assigned to future Bart, so he told the animators to draw the character with belly fat, <b>a</b> <b>ponytail,</b> sags under his eyes, and one earring. Scully said on the audio commentary that he thought the design of Bart looked [...] "great", though he added that it was [...] "slightly disturbing" [...] to see the older versions of Homer and Marge in the episode, and joked that it is [...] "a little bit sad to watch cartoon characters age." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2013, a small figure dated {{at around}} 800 AD was {{discovered}} in Hårby, Denmark by three amateur archaeologists. The figurine portrays a woman with long hair knotted into <b>a</b> <b>ponytail</b> who is wearing a long dress which is sleeveless and vest like at the top. Over {{the top of her}} dress she is wearing an embroidered apron. Her clothing keeps the woman's arms unobstructed so she can fight with the sword and shield she is holding. Commenting on the figure, archaeologist Mogens Bo Henriksen said that [...] "there can hardly be any doubt that the figure depicts one of Odin's valkyries as we know them from the sagas as well as from Swedish picture stones from the time around AD700".|$|E

500|$|Lara's costume was {{redesigned}} and she {{no longer}} wears her trademark turquoise sleeveless top and khaki shorts, but instead, a dark brown halter top and black shorts. Additionally, her hair is no longer braided, but worn in <b>a</b> <b>ponytail.</b> According to Play, Lara [...] "moves as good as she looks [...] no longer moves like a video game character" [...] due to her being fully motion captured. Olympic gymnast and NCAA Women's Gymnastics champion Heidi Moneymaker was the model used for motion capturing. Keeley Hawes provided the voice of Lara in this instalment, as she did in Anniversary and Legend. [...] Gymnast Alison Carroll {{was selected as the}} new official Lara Croft model to promote the game, replacing Karima Adebibe.|$|E
500|$|Karen Gillan {{had to wear}} a latex {{prosthetic}} stomach bump for {{the scenes}} which depicted Amy as pregnant. She claimed {{it made her feel}} more mature and act ridiculously, and cited it as her favourite part of filming the series. Arthur Darvill wore a wig for the aged Rory, which was trimmed to look [...] "more masculine" [...] and pulled back in <b>a</b> <b>ponytail.</b> The Eknodine were CGI and the scenes were simply filmed with the actors opening their mouths. The scene in which Rory hits Eknodine-inhabited Mrs Hamil with a plank was filmed first of all with Darvill missing actress Joan Linder, and then again with Linder's stunt double, whom he was allowed to hit. There was only one prop of the plank, and fortunately all the necessary shots were completed before Darvill accidentally broke it.|$|E
500|$|For the Blond Ambition World Tour in 1990, Madonna said, [...] "I {{wanted to}} throw an old song for fun, and 'Holiday' {{seemed to be}} a {{universal}} favourite. In addition to that it's one of the only old songs I've done that I can still sing and not feel I've totally outgrown it." [...] Performing it {{as a part of the}} encore, Madonna appeared on the stage in a polka-dotted blouse with matching flounces at the bottom of white trousers and hair in a top knot with <b>a</b> <b>ponytail.</b> The costume was adopted from a My Fair Lady dress and was designed by Jean-Paul Gaultier. Three different performances are found in the Blond Ambition: Japan Tour 90 VHS, the Blond Ambition World Tour Live VHS and the [...] documentary. The performance included in the documentary was used as a music video to promote it. The performance received four nominations at the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards, including Best Female Video, Best Dance Video, Best Choreography in Video and Best Cinematography in Video, but did not win any of the categories.|$|E
