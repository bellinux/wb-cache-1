25|$|Despite his {{experience}} in the ballet world, Henze had never before composed a subject in the romantic style which Ashton requested, however Ashton had been impressed by Henze's treatment of magical material in his opera König Hirsch. Henze attended many ballet performances at Covent Garden, frequently accompanied by Ashton who told him clearly what he liked <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not like in music for dance. Eventually the work was completed, but when Ashton heard a recording of the orchestrated score he realised {{that he would have}} to revise his ideas; the sustained orchestral sounds were such a contrast to the piano score and made him think very differently.|$|E
500|$|This ample {{provision}} {{arose from}} the sponsorship of Rowett, who had extended his original gift of seed money to an undertaking {{to cover the costs}} of the entire expedition. The extent of Rowett's contribution is not recorded; in an (undated) prospectus for the southern expedition Shackleton had estimated the total cost as [...] "about £100,000". Whatever the total, Rowett appears to have funded the lion's share, enabling Frank Wild to record later that, unique among Antarctic expeditions of the era, this one returned home without any outstanding debt. According to Wild, without Rowett's actions the expedition would have been impossible: [...] "His generous attitude is the more remarkable in that he knew there was no prospect of financial return, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> was in the interest of scientific research and from friendship with Shackleton." [...] His only recognition was the attachment of his name to the title of the expedition. Rowett was, according to Huntford, [...] "a stodgy, prosaic looking" [...] businessman, who was, in 1920, a co-founder and principal contributor to an animal nutrition research institute in Aberdeen known as the Rowett Research Institute (now part of the University of Aberdeen). He had also endowed dental research work at the Middlesex Hospital.|$|E

2500|$|In Roman Catholic {{theology}} {{the study}} of Mary, while contributing to {{the study of}} Christ, is also a separate discipline in its own right, with an understanding of the figure of Mary contributing to a fuller understanding of who Christ is <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b> The Congregation for Catholic Education has characterized the situation as follows: [...] "The history of theology shows that an understanding of the mystery of the Virgin contributes to a more profound understanding of the mystery of Christ, of the Church and of the vocation of man." [...] Referring to this, Cardinal Raymond Burke stated that the promotion of a fuller knowledge of the Virgin Mary is the [...] "constant work of the Church".|$|E
2500|$|When the Rolling Stones, The Beatles, and Johnny Winter {{came upon}} the music scene, Dean’s {{attention}} quickly turned to Rock & Roll and became interested in guitars.

The AP article also said [...] "Renzi made much of his money while living in Burke, Virginia, about 20 minutes from downtown Washington.

2500|$|Dalglish was {{the manager}} of Liverpool {{at the time of}} the Hillsborough {{disaster}} on 15 April 1989. The disaster claimed 94 lives on the day, with the final death toll reaching 96. Dalglish attended many funerals of the victims – including four in one day. – and his presence in the aftermath of the disaster has been described as [...] "colossal and heroic". Dalglish broke a twenty-year silence about the disaster in March 2009. He expressed regret that the police and the FA did not consider delaying the kick-off of the match, a move which might have averted the 96 deaths. During the Hillsborough Memorial Service on 15 April 2011, Liverpool MP Steve Rotherham announced he would submit an Early Day Motion to have Dalglish knighted, [...] "not only for his outstanding playing and managerial career, but also the charity work he has done with his wife, Marina, for breast cancer support <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> after Hillsborough.

2500|$|English {{private schools}} {{at the time}} of Niven's boyhood were noted for their strict and {{sometimes}} brutal discipline. Niven suffered many instances of corporal punishment owing to his inclination for pranks, which finally led to his expulsion from Heatherdown Preparatory School at the age of 10½. This ended his chances for Eton College, a significant blow to his family. After failing to pass the naval entrance exam because of his difficulty with maths, Niven attended Stowe School, a newly created public school led by headmaster J.F. Roxburgh, who was unlike any of Niven's previous headmasters. Thoughtful and kind, he addressed the boys by their first names, allowed them bicycles, and encouraged and nurtured their personal interests. Niven later wrote, [...] "How he did this, I shall never know, but he made every single boy at that school feel that what he said <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> were of real importance to the headmaster." [...] He attended the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, graduating in 1930 with a commission as a second lieutenant in the British Army.|$|E
2500|$|Wagner's {{death in}} February 1883 was another deeply moving {{event in the}} life of the young composer. The song [...] "Zur Ruh, zur Ruh" [...] was {{composed}} shortly afterward and is considered to be the best of his early works; it is speculated that it was intended as an elegy for Wagner. Wolf often despaired of his own future in the ensuing years, in a world from which his idol had departed, leaving tremendous footsteps to follow and no guidance on how to do so. This left him often extremely temperamental, alienating friends and patrons, although his charm helped him retain them more than his actions merited. His songs had meanwhile caught the attention of Franz Liszt, whom he respected greatly, and who like Wolf's previous mentors advised him to pursue larger forms; advice he this time followed with the symphonic tone poem Penthesilea. His activities as a critic began to pick up. He was merciless in his criticism of the inferior works he saw taking over the musical atmosphere of the time; those of Anton Rubinstein he considered particularly odious. But he was as fervent in his support of Liszt, Schubert and Chopin, whose genius he recognized. Known as [...] "Wild Wolf" [...] for the intensity and expressive strength of his convictions, his vitriol made him some enemies. He composed little during this time, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> write he couldn't get performed; the Rosé Quartet (led by Vienna Philharmonic concertmaster Arnold Rosé) would not even look at his D minor Quartet after it was picked apart in a column, and the premiere of Penthesilea was met by the Vienna Philharmonic, when they tried it out under their celebrated conservative conductor Hans Richter, with nothing but derision for 'the man who had dared to criticize [...] "Meister Brahms,'" [...] as Richter himself caustically put it.|$|E
