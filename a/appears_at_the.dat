5|$|Akane Tsunemori {{was created}} by the Production I.G staff to be the most {{relatable}} character in the series.

One of the staff's main objectives was Akane's growth. Akane <b>appears</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> start of the first season as an innocent rookie who matures through her experiences. This was affirmed by Japanese female actor Kana Hanazawa, who voices Akane in Japanese.
