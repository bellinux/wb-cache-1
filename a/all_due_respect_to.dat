500|$|Critics {{have most}} often {{compared}} {{the film to}} landmark youth films Breathless (also 1960)—released in France five months earlier—directed by Jean-Luc Godard and Nicholas Ray's Rebel Without a Cause (1955), although, Bryan Hartzheim found it takes its youths more seriously and with less sympathy. He stated, [...] " [...] a wrecking ball to what can be considered the indulgencies of the [...] genre, an exhibition of the horrors of uninhibited youth taken to its carnal extremes and matched by a visual accompaniment akin to the abstract and improvised style of a Miles Davis score." [...] Tim Lucas of Video Watchdog magazine called the film [...] "an important rediscovery on many fronts... {{one of the great}} jazz films, and possibly the best illustration the cinema has ever given us of the jazz buff. It's the only film I've ever seen that makes jazz seem scarier than the darkest heavy metal, that makes jazz seem dangerous." [...] For TokyoScope: The Japanese Cult Film Companion, Alvin Lu commended the score as [...] "stunning" [...] and Kawachi's performance as [...] "ferocious, the very incarnation of the kind of social chaos that could be engendered by too much exposure to jazz, Coke, and hot dogs." [...] The Boston Globe's Wesley Morris wrote, [...] " [...] Kurahara takes the movie to extremes of behavior and style, merging the two until the form seems as violently unstable as the characters. He makes a wave that in Europe was called 'French' and 'new.' But with <b>all</b> <b>due</b> <b>respect</b> <b>to</b> Jean-Luc Godard, this is breathless - and more interesting, too." [...] Morris further qualified that while Breathless may appeal to contemporary viewers academically, The Warped Ones retains a spontaneous, documentary feel.

For the season, McCoy now has a 77.6 completion percentage (soon to be a new NCAA record) for 3,445 yards, 32 touchdowns and seven interceptions, plus 476 yards and 13 touchdowns running" [...] Comparing McCoy to fellow Big 12 South quarterbacks Sam Bradford and Graham Harrell, Mandel said, [...] "But here's where McCoy stands out to me. Bradford, as talented as he is, is helped by the fact he has a trio of explosive receivers and two potential 1,000-yard rushers behind him. Harrell has Michael Crabtree. Daniel has Jeremy Maclin. With <b>all</b> <b>due</b> <b>respect</b> <b>to</b> Jordan Shipley and Quan Cosby, McCoy is Texas' offense. Much like Tim Tebow last season, he's both his team's leading passer and rusher. Also like Tebow—you have to wonder sometimes how he's still standing. McCoy was sacked three times Thursday night and endured several brutal hits. Following his third-quarter touchdown run, trainers attended to his shoulder on the sideline. But he was right back in there the next series."

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impacts of}} various policy interventions in the Presidente Dutra Highway (PDH), Brazil. Using a time-series database, changes in the highway’s physical and operational characteristics are analyzed in conjunction with variations in socioeconomic and demographic indicators. A major outcome {{of this study is}} the realization that the infrastructure policy implemented in the highway has created short, medium and long term impacts of extreme complexity. These impacts are the result of a continuous development cycle in which transport infrastructure policies trigger changes in land use patterns (activities, location and density), socioeconomic and demographic indicators as well as operational conditions of the highway. The results of the case study indicate that the development cycle is only perceived because the analysis is based upon a time-series database, otherwise only operational changes could be detected. Based on the understanding of the development cycle in the PDH region, the recent implementation of the tolling system through a Public Private Partnership (PPP) scheme is assessed. It is concluded that the tolling system may create impacts in terms of initial limitations <b>to</b> development in <b>all</b> <b>respects</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the increase in direct (user perceived) transport costs.

At this, Siddhoji's wife Rukkubai (Kannamba) who is jealous of the boys, sows seeds of hatred against them in her husband's mind. She plans to spoil the marriage of Firoji with Raghubai (T. G. Kamala Devi). Siddhoji banishes the three princes from Badegao and sends them to rule Pathikonda. Rukkubai plots with Diwanji to kill the three princes by inviting them to the palace to discuss the marriage proposal. However Raghubai helps them escape. At the same time, Siddhoji declares war on Pathikonda and his army burns the fort. Somoji's wife Anthumbai (Kumari) escapes with her son Tule Rao. Siddhoji chases her. In the sword fight that ensures Anthumbai emerges victorious. Since Pathikonda is out of bounds for her, she takes shelter at Gollapalle. Somoji and his brothers also reach there. They possess the hereditary riches after Firoji valiantly undertakes a journey to please their deity Yellamma. The news reaches Rukkubai and she employs the dreaded Mari to eliminate the brothers and they succeed in killing Somoji and capturing Subandhi. Anthumbai provokes the people to revolt against Siddhoji and she leads the war. In an unexpected turn of events, Firoji becomes the king of a neighbouring country and he too invades Badegao with a huge army. Siddhoji is killed in the war. Rukkubai repents for her act. Firoji marries Raghubai.|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, we {{addressed}} different {{issues related to}} drug exposure as it may bear on the estimates of risk {{in the context of}} hypertension treatment. A cohort of 19, 501 subjects initiating therapy for uncomplicated hypertension was identified from Saskatchewan Health databases. In a first study aimed at documenting the equivalence of the angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, we found that medical visits and hospitalizations following treatment initiation were lower among patients initially dispensed enalapril and lisinopril relative to captopril. Baseline characteristics could not be ruled out as possible explanations but variability in the outcomes suggest that ACE inhibitors may not be equivalent in <b>all</b> <b>respects.</b> <b>Due</b> <b>to</b> concerns about the appropriateness of using initial treatment as the exposure, patterns of use of antihypertensive were examined longitudinally in the second manuscript using the same cohort. ACE inhibitors, followed by calcium antagonists and beta-blockers, were the most commonly prescribed agents to initiate therapy for hypertension. Compliance with therapy was found to decrease over time with only 28 % of patients still being compliant after seven years. In addition, 89 % of patients underwent at least one modification to therapy, interrupted treatment being the most frequently encountered. Important differences were also found across agents with regard to compliance, type and timing of treatment modifications. The third manuscript reports on a case-control study assessing the association between antihypertensive drug use and the risk of myocardial infarction (MI). Overall, 812 cases of MI were identified using hospital discharge data and death certificates. Four controls were matched to each case on entry date and time at risk of an event. Compared with beta-blockers, current use of calcium antagonists was associated with an increased risk of MI (RR = 2. 3; 95 % Cl = 1. 7 [...] 3. 1).
