5|$|As Mikawa's force {{neared the}} Guadalcanal area, the Japanese ships {{launched}} three floatplanes for one final reconnaissance of the Allied ships, {{and to provide}} illumination by dropping flares during the upcoming battle.

5|$|Commonsense {{knowledge}} and reasoning. Many important artificial intelligence applications like vision or natural language require simply {{enormous amounts of}} information about the world: the program needs to have some idea of what it might be looking at or what it is talking about. This requires that the program know most of the same things about the world that a child does. Researchers soon discovered that this was a truly vast amount of information. No one in 1970 could build a database so large <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> knew how a program might learn so much information.|$|E

5|$|The new cent {{was issued}} in {{exchange}} for the worn Spanish colonial silver coin that had circulated in the U.S. until then, as well as for its larger predecessor.

5|$|After {{arriving}} in New York, Häyhänen {{spent the next}} two years establishing his identity. During that time he received money from his superiors left in dead-letter boxes in the Bronx and Manhattan. It is known he occasionally drew attention to himself by indulging in heavy drinking sessions and heated arguments with his Finnish wife Hannah. For six months Häyhänen checked the thumbtack <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> had made contact. He also checked a dead-drop location he had memorized. There he found a hollowed-out nickel. However, prior to opening the coin Häyhänen had misplaced it, either buying a newspaper with it or using it as a subway token. For the next seven months the hollow nickel travelled around the New York City economy, unopened. The trail of the hollow nickel ended when a thirteen-year-old newsboy was collecting for his weekly deliveries. The newsboy accidentally dropped the nickel and it broke in half, revealing a microphotograph containing a series of numbers. The newsboy handed the nickel to a New York detective, who in turn forwarded it to the FBI. From 1953 to 1957, though every effort was made to decipher the microphotograph, the FBI was unable to solve the mystery.|$|E

5|$|After he {{completed}} his law degree in 1930 at Fordham Law, {{he worked as}} an assistant engineer for the New York City Subway. After earning his law degree he needed to obtain a clerkship, but {{it was during the}} depression <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> could afford to hire him. He allowed a struggling lawyer to use space in his office and paid for his own clerkship. After working for the Subway, he worked for Thomas F. Riley, who owned the Riley Drilling Company, and they formed the partnership of Riley and O'Malley. With the help of Edwin O'Malley's political connections, Walter's company received contracts from the New York Telephone Company and the New York City Board of Education to perform geological surveys. Subsequently, Walter started the Walter F. O'Malley Engineering Company and published the Subcontractors Register with his uncle, Joseph O'Malley (1893–1985).|$|E
5|$|Although only an {{alternate}} {{member of the}} tribunal without a vote, his voice was heard {{in all of its}} deliberations, his hand drafted a large and most important part of its judgment, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> connected with the tribunal, member or otherwise, had a greater part than he in shaping the final result. If, as I confidently believe, the work of the tribunal will constitute a landmark in the development of world order based on law, to Norman Birkett must go a large share of the credit for the success of the undertaking. To few men does the opportunity come to labour so mightily for the welfare of their kind.|$|E
5|$|Another classic bit {{of cinema}} {{that is largely}} a myth is the {{showdown}} at high noon, where two well-matched gunslingers agree to meet for a climactic formal duel. These duels did occasionally happen, {{as in the case}} of the Luke Short – Jim Courtright duel, but gunfights were typically more spontaneous, a fight that turned deadly when one side reached for a weapon, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> knew who actually won the fight for several minutes until the air finally cleared of smoke. Gunfights could be won by simple distraction, or pistols could be emptied as gunmen fought from behind cover without injury. When a gunman did square off, it rarely was with another gunfighter. Gunslingers usually gave each other a wide berth, and it was uncommon for two well-known gunslingers to face off. The gunslinger's reputation often was as valuable as any skills possessed. In Western films and books, young toughs often challenge experienced gunmen with the hopes of building a reputation, but this rarely happened in real life. A strong reputation was enough to keep others civil and often would spare a gunfighter from conflict. Even other gunslingers were likely to avoid any unnecessary confrontation.|$|E
