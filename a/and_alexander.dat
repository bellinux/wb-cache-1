5|$|John <b>and</b> <b>Alexander</b> Runciman both gained reputations as {{painters}} of mythological and historical themes. They travelled to Italy, where they worked with Hamilton.

His version of The Origin of Painting (1773), depicting Pliny's {{story of a}} young Corinthian woman outlining a shadow on the wall, has her hand guided by Cupid, suggesting the ultimate motivation for art was love. The same theme was painted by another of Hamilton's proteges, David Allan, two years later. In the late eighteenth century Ossian became a common subject for Scottish artists, and works were undertaken by Alexander Runciman and David Allan among others.|$|E
