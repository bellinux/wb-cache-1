5|$|There is no antidote, and {{supportive}} care is {{the mainstay of}} further treatment for intoxication. Though {{sometimes referred to as}} a deliriant and while muscarine was first isolated from A. muscaria and as such is its namesake, muscimol does not have action, either as an agonist or antagonist, at the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor site, and therefore atropine or physostigmine as an antidote is not recommended. If a patient is delirious or agitated, this can usually be treated by reassurance and, if necessary, physical restraints. A benzodiazepine such as diazepam or lorazepam can be used to control combativeness, agitation, muscular overactivity, and seizures. Only small doses should be used, as they may worsen the respiratory depressant effects of muscimol. Recurrent vomiting is rare, but if present may lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances; intravenous rehydration or electrolyte replacement may be required. Serious cases may develop loss of consciousness or coma, and may need intubation and <b>artificial</b> <b>ventilation.</b> Hemodialysis can remove the toxins, although this intervention is generally considered unnecessary. With modern medical treatment the prognosis is typically good following supportive treatment.|$|E

25|$|Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, {{a form of}} <b>artificial</b> <b>ventilation,</b> is the act of {{assisting}} or stimulating respiration, a {{metabolic process}} referring to the overall exchange of gases in the body, where a rescuer presses his or her mouth against that of the victim and blows air into the person's lungs.

A determination of possible deliberate overdose should be considered with appropriate scrutiny, and precautions taken to prevent any attempt by the patient to commit further bodily harm. Hypotension is corrected with fluid replacement, although catecholamines such as norepinephrine or dopamine may be required to increase blood pressure. Bradycardia is treated with atropine or an infusion of norepinephrine to increase coronary blood flow and heart rate.|$|E
25|$|Columbushaus was {{the result}} of a plan by the French retail company Les Galeries Lafayette, whose {{flagship}} store was the legendary Galeries Lafayette in Paris, to open a counterpart in Berlin, on the Grand Hotel Belle Vue's former site, but financial worries made them pull out. Undaunted, the architect, Erich Mendelsohn (1887–1953), erected vast advertising boards around the perimeter of the site, and the revenue generated by these enabled him to proceed with the development anyway. Columbushaus was a ten-storey ultra-modern office building, years ahead of its time, containing Germany's first <b>artificial</b> <b>ventilation</b> system, and whose elegance and clean lines won it much praise. However, despite a Woolworths store on its ground floor, a major travel company housed on the floor above, and a restaurant offering fine views over the city from the top floor, the economic situation of the time meant that it would not be followed by more buildings in that vein: no further redevelopment in the immediate vicinity of Potsdamer Platz occurred prior to World War II, and so Columbushaus would always seem out of place in that location. Nevertheless, its exact position showed that the platz was starting to be opened out: the former hotel had mostly stood on a large flagged area laid out in front of it, indicating that the new building curved away from the existing street line; this would have enabled future street widening to take place.|$|E

40|$|An {{outstanding}} {{progress in}} pulmonary ventilation was documented recently when <b>artificial</b> pulmonary <b>ventilation</b> was introduced for home care. In-home pulmonary ventilation is meant {{for patients who}} suffer from serious progressive diseases. In most cases, such state is irreversible and obstructs patient`s ability to breathe consciously. Those patients benefit a lot from the newly introduced ventilation. It helps them live a regular life in natural background for a few more years. The target of the thesis was to identify the most frequent health and social issues in patients ventilated at home; to determine advantages of home care and possible risks in ventilated patients; and to elaborate a nursing standard to be followed when taking care of ventilated patients at their homes. The qualitative research was carried out by means of two half-structured interviews. One interview was made with 5 pre-selected nurses working for a home-care agency; the other interview was made in the same agency with 5 patients on <b>artificial</b> pulmonary <b>ventilation</b> that are looked after by the same agency. The outcome of the interviews is that the most frequent health problem in ventilated patients reported both by patients and nurses is obstruction of tracheostomic cannula. Another finding was that ventilated patients do not feel socially isolated which is in total contradiction to what the nurses claimed. The interviews taken with the patients showed that in-home care benefits mainly {{from the fact that the}} patients are at home, and the risk of receiving home care is that such care is dependant basically on one person and is time consuming. The objectives of the thesis have been met. The outcomes of the research will be made available to the company named Home health-care services Eva Šafránková, which was the venue of the research. The nursing standard can be used as a source of additional information for ventilated patients and to improve care provided to patients ventilated at their homes. It is recommended that nurses should further educate themselves in pulmonary ventilation. Training seems to be an appropriate solution in this case. Nurses would certainly also benefit from a visit to a place providing <b>artificial</b> pulmonary <b>ventilation.</b> Another recommendation is to carry out a follow-up research that would observe advantages of <b>artificial</b> pulmonary <b>ventilation</b> provided at home compared with benefits of <b>artificial</b> pulmonary <b>ventilation</b> provided in health care centres...|$|R

2500|$|Mechanical {{ventilation}} is {{the medical}} term for <b>artificial</b> <b>ventilation</b> where mechanical means {{is used to}} assist or replace spontaneous breathing. This may involve a machine called a ventilator or the breathing may be assisted by an Anesthesiologist, certified registered nurse anesthetist, physician, physician assistant, respiratory therapist, paramedic, EMT, or other suitable person compressing a bag or set of bellows. Mechanical ventilation is termed [...] "invasive" [...] if it involves any instrument penetrating through the mouth (such as an endotracheal tube) or the skin (such as a tracheostomy tube). There are two main types: positive pressure ventilation, where air (or another gas mix) is pushed into the trachea, and negative pressure ventilation, where air is, in essence, sucked into the lungs. There are many modes of mechanical ventilation, and their nomenclature has been revised over the decades as the technology has continually developed.|$|E
2500|$|Despite the {{concerns}} of Hippocrates, Galen of Pergamon (129–199) and Aretaeus of Cappadocia (both of whom lived in Rome in the 2nd century AD) credit Asclepiades of Bithynia (ca. 124–40 BC) as being the first physician to perform a non-emergency tracheotomy. However, Aretaeus warned against the performance of tracheotomy because he believed that incisions made into the tracheal cartilage were prone to secondary wound infections and therefore would not heal. He wrote that [...] "The lips of the wound do not coalesce, for they are both cartilaginous and not of a nature to unite". Antyllus, another Greek surgeon who lived in Rome in the 2nd century AD, {{was reported to have}} performed tracheotomy when treating oral diseases. He refined the technique to be more similar to that used in modern times, recommending that a transverse incision be made between the third and fourth tracheal rings for the treatment of life-threatening airway obstruction. Antyllus wrote that tracheotomy was not effective however in cases of severe laryngotracheobronchitis because the pathology was distal to the operative site. Antyllus' original writings were lost, but they were preserved by Oribasius (ca. 320–400) and Paul of Aegina (ca. 625–690), both of whom were Greek physicians as well as historians. Galen clarified the anatomy of the trachea and was the first to demonstrate that the larynx generates the voice. Galen may have understood the importance of <b>artificial</b> <b>ventilation,</b> because in one of his experiments he used bellows to inflate the lungs of a dead animal.|$|E

40|$|Acute {{respiratory}} failure {{is a state}} when the respiratory tract suddenly {{is not able to}} carry out its functions. The disorder can be both at the inflow of the air into the respiratory tract or at the point of the gas exchange between the alveoli and the blood. The most severe form of acute {{respiratory failure}} is the acute respiratory distress syndrome-ARDS. It is necessary to treat acute respiratory failure immediately when it appears because it can cause serious damage to the organism or death. The treatment requires securing the respiratory pathway. A theoretical knowledge of the possible causes of the origin and development of ARDS, and its treatment using <b>artificial</b> pulmonary <b>ventilation</b> helps to correctly understand the problems of this illness. Nursing care is essential while treating severe respiratory failure. The care is highly specialized in this case. The nurses participate in the securing of respiratory pathway, beginning and progress of <b>artificial</b> pulmonary <b>ventilation</b> and the process of weaning of mechanical ventilation. The aim of this bachelor's thesis is to determine the basic terms and issues of acute respiratory failure. This is necessary to properly understand the case and the subsequent treatment of respiratory failure with mechanical ventilation. The study deals with defining and comparing particular guidelines of the complex nursing care of the patients with acute respiratory failure. This project was defined because of the continual development and improvement of the care of critical status patients. This thesis, entitled "Nursing Care of Patients with Acute Respiratory Failure," expounds on its topic only as a theoretical work based on both Czech and international scientific resources. Knowledge of particular parts of the thesis was obtained from various scientific and professional books, magazines and Internet resources of professional associations. The Czech authors most frequently cited are MUDr. Pavel Dostál PhD. MBA, who is focused on the issue of <b>artificial</b> pulmonary <b>ventilation,</b> and MUDr. Bronislav Stibor, who is dedicated chiefly to ARDS and revitalizing methods. Based on the studied literature, basic theoretical terms and issues were expounded concerning acute respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Particularly emphasized was the <b>artificial</b> pulmonary <b>ventilation.</b> The theoretical part gradually joins the part dealing nursing care of those patients suffering from acute respiratory failure. The part contains every guideline concerning the most recent developments and the latest innovations in the field of nursing of the critically ill. After studying the scientific sources, it was concluded that there were some differences regarding each authors´ guidelines. The guidelines differed from each other only slightly. Each guideline is mentioned in the thesis and analyzed {{at the end of the}} thesis. There is a comparison of competences of general nurses and specialized nurses for intensive care. According to Czech law, the patients with the failure of a vital function should be treated by specialized nurses. The range of permitted treatment attended by an intensive care nurse is plentiful when compared to general nurses.
