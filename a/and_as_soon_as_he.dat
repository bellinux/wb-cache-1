5|$|Gruban {{successfully}} appealed {{against his}} internment, <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was freed brought Booth to court. The case {{was so popular}} that the involved barristers found it physically difficult {{to get into the}} court each day due {{to the size of the}} crowds gathered outside. Although the barristers on both sides were noted for their skill the case went almost entirely one way, with the jury taking only ten minutes to find Booth guilty. This was one of the first noted cases of Patrick Hastings, and his victory in it led to him applying to become a King's Counsel.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantines {{tried to}} take {{advantage}} of the revolt, and began assembling forces at Messina and Reggio, while a fleet was dispatched from Constantinople. Abu'l-Abbas, however, did not tarry <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> had suppressed the rebellion, marched against the Byzantines, ravaging the environs of Taormina and launching an unsuccessful siege of Catania before returning to winter in Palermo. In the next spring, he resumed his attack and assaulted Demona. To disrupt the Byzantine preparations, his forces then crossed over to the mainland. Reggio was captured on 10 July, and was subjected to a savage sack; a vast booty was collected, over 15,000 of its inhabitants were carted off as slaves, and the jizya imposed on the remainder. On his return to Sicily, Abu'l-Abbas came across a Byzantine fleet that had just arrived from Constantinople and thoroughly defeated it, capturing thirty of its vessels.|$|E

25|$|On {{the morning}} of October 3, three of Rosecrans's {{divisions}} advanced into the old Confederate rifle pits north and northwest of town: McKean on the left, Davies in the center, and Hamilton on the right. Stanley's division was held in reserve south of town. Van Dorn began his assault at 10 a.m. with Lovell's division attacking McArthur's brigade (McKean's division, on the Union left) from three sides. Van Dorn's plan was a double envelopment, in which Lovell would open the fight, {{in the hope that}} Rosecrans would weaken his right to reinforce McKean, at which time Price would make the main assault against the U.S. right and enter the works. Lovell made a determined attack on Oliver <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> became engaged Maury opened the fight with Davies's left. McArthur quickly moved four regiments to Oliver's support {{and at the same time}} Davies advanced his line to the entrenchments. These movements left a gap between Davies and McKean, through which the Confederates forced their way about 1:30p.m., and the whole Union line fell back to within half a mile of the redoubts, leaving two pieces of artillery in the hands of the Confederates.|$|E
25|$|When it was {{determined}} to carry on operations on the eastern coast of Spain, Jones was appointed commanding engineer under General Maitland, and sailed from Lisbon {{in the beginning of}} June. On the disembarkation of the troops at Alicante, Jones received an appointment on the staff as assistant quartermaster-general, there being already an engineer officer senior to himself in command of the engineers. Owing to differences between the commanders of the allied forces, Jones was sent on a special mission to Madrid, to explain to Wellington the position of affairs. Travelling by night and avoiding roads, Jones reached Madrid safely, and was warmly received by Wellington, who, sending instructions by a courier, kept Jones to accompany him to the north to the siege of Burgos. During the progress of that siege, Jones was instructed to signal to Wellington by holding up his hat when the arrangements for exploding a mine and making a lodgment were complete. As the signal was not acknowledged, Jones repeated it until the French perceived him, and their fire brought him down with a bullet through his ankle. He with difficulty rolled himself into the parallel, but he ordered the mine to be fired, and the operations entrusted to him were successfully carried out before he left the field. Jones remained in a state of delirium for ten days, <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could be moved Wellington sent him to Lisbon in the only spring wagon at headquarters. The sufferings of this two months' journey severely tried his strength, and he remained in Lisbon until April 1813, when he was sent to England. Eighteen months of severe suffering followed. During this period he composed and published a volume entitled Journal of Sieges carried on by the Allies in Spain in 1810, 1811, and 1812. In this work he fearlessly exposed the deficiencies of the engineer service, which he attributed to the ignorance and military incapacity of the board of ordnance. These strictures naturally offended the dispensers of patronage. Wellington, however, although the book was published without his sanction, and sharply criticised his siege proceedings, praised it, and remained the author's friend.|$|E

500|$|Although Leyland was not {{a stylish}} batsman, he was effective. Cardus {{described}} him as [...] "a sturdy cricketer, not tall, but his sloping bottle-neck shoulders seemed to add inches {{to him and he}} had long arms of impressive thickness, veined with strength at the wrist; also he was broad in the beam, with a rubicund smile on his cheerful open countenance." [...] He was a good driver of the ball, with a high backlift, and moved quickly and economically to reach the pitch of the ball. Cardus thought that his style of batting was representative of his character: [...] "He put his nature into every stroke, <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> had 'got bowling where he wanted it,' he didn't merely hit or drive it—he walloped it." [...] At times, Leyland's desire to score quickly brought about his dismissal. However, when necessary, he defended strongly and used his pads as a second line of defence if he missed the ball with his bat.|$|E
500|$|... "On His Cousin George" [...] was an {{immediate}} success, reprinted in over 100 newspapers. [...] The columns had not been copyrighted; the Journal quickly acted to protect new essays, and thereafter collected reprint fees. Anecdotes poured in; a recitation of the column had calmed a savage meeting of the Texas Bar Association; another brought down the house {{at a meeting of}} California's Bohemian Club; the U.S. ambassador in London, Joseph Choate, read it to an audience of Britons. Mr. Dooley even reached the seats of power; Dunne's June 25, 1898 piece imagining a chaotic meeting of the president's cabinet was read to that body by Treasury Secretary Lyman Gage, a Chicagoan. Dunne struck a chord with his columns as people came to realize how badly bungled were many aspects of the war effort. [...] A repeated target of Dunne's wit was commanding general Nelson A. Miles, noted for having designed his own uniforms, which arrived at the embarkation point in Tampa [...] "mounted on a superb specyal ca-ar", [...] and [...] "his uniforms are coming down in special steel-protected bullion trains from the mine, where they've been kept for a year. He has ordered out the gold reserve for to equip his staff, numbering eight thousand men, many of whom are clubmen; <b>and,</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> can have his pictures took, he will crush the Spanish with one blow". When Miles invaded Puerto Rico in July without much resistance by the Spanish, Mr. Dooley reported on the general's experience of combat: [...] "He has been in great peril from a withering fire of bouquets, and he has met and overpowered some of the most savage orators in Puerto Rico; but, when I last heard of him, he had pitched his tents and ice-cream freezers near the enemy's wall, and was gradually silencing them with proclamations".|$|E

2500|$|Because Emperor Xianzong had {{previously}} issued an edict stating that whoever killed Li Shidao would be conferred all of Li Shidao's titles, Liu Wu {{believed that he}} would be given Pinglu's 12 prefectures, and therefore started making personnel changes for the entire circuit. [...] Meanwhile, though, Emperor Xianzong was secretly planning to divide Pinglu into three circuits and transferring Liu elsewhere, but was concerned that Liu might resist. [...] He ordered Tian to evaluate the situation, and Tian thus sent messengers to Liu, ostensibly to befriend Liu, but secretly to observe Liu. [...] As Liu was strong and liked arm wrestling, within three days, he was encouraging soldiers to arm wrestle and watching them doing so in excitement. [...] When the Weibo messengers reported this back to Tian, Tian opined to Emperor Xianzong that Liu, if transferred elsewhere, would not resist. [...] Soon thereafter, Emperor Xianzong issued an edict commissioning Liu as the military governor of Yicheng Circuit (義成, headquartered in modern Anyang, Henan). [...] Liu was surprised and decided to submit — <b>and,</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> left the city, Tian, approaching with Weibo and other circuits' troops, met him and gave him the seals of the Yicheng governorship. [...] Liu took with him several colleagues who had unsuccessfully counseled Li Shidao not to resist imperial authority — Li Gongdu (李公度), Li Cun (李存), Guo Hu (郭昈), and Jia Zhiyan (賈直言) — with him, and invited them to serve under him at Yicheng. [...] Liu's submission to imperial authority was considered the apex of Emperor Xianzong's campaign to end warlordism in his realm, referred to historians as the Yuanhe Restoration (元和中興, Yuanhe being Emperor Xianzong's era name). [...] Emperor Xianzong created Liu the Prince of Pengcheng and awarded him a mansion and an estate. [...] In spring 820, Liu went to Chang'an to pay homage to Emperor Xianzong.|$|E
2500|$|Burton went on {{to feature}} in two more plays by Fry [...] The Boy With A Cart and A Phoenix Too Frequent. The former opened at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith in February 1950, while the latter premiered at the Dolphin Theatre, Brighton the {{following}} month. Gielgud, who also directed The Boy With A Cart, said that Burton's role in the play [...] "was {{one of the most}} beautiful performances" [...] he had ever seen. During its month-long run, Anthony Quayle, who was on the lookout for a young actor to star as Prince Hal in his adaptations of Henry IV, Part I and Henry IV, Part 2 as a part of the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre season for the Festival of Britain, came to see the play <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> beheld Burton, he found his man and got his agreement to play the parts. Both plays opened in 1951 at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon to mixed reviews, but Burton received acclaim for his role as Prince Hal. Many critics dubbed him [...] "the next Laurence Olivier". Theatre critic and dramaturg, Kenneth Tynan said of his performance, [...] "His playing of Prince Hal turned interested speculation to awe almost as soon as he started to speak; in the first intermission local critics stood agape in the lobbies." [...] He was also praised by Humphrey Bogart and his wife Lauren Bacall after both witnessed the play. Bacall later said of him: [...] "He was just marvellous [...] Bogie loved him. We all did." [...] Burton celebrated his success by buying his first car, a Standard Flying Fourteen and enjoyed a drink with Bogart at a pub called The Dirty Duck. Philip too was happy with the progress his ward made and that he felt [...] "proud, humble, and awed by god's mysterious ways".|$|E
2500|$|Cook's {{men and the}} British Marines {{were confronted}} on the beach by an elderly kahuna who {{approached}} them holding a coconut and chanting. They yelled at the priest to go away but he kept approaching them while singing the mele. When Cook and his men looked away from the old kahuna, they saw that the beach was now filled with thousands of Native Hawaiians. Cook yelled at Kalaniʻōpuʻu to get up but the ruler refused. As the townspeople began to gather around them, Cook and his men began {{to back away from}} the crowd and raise their guns. The two chiefs and Kānekapōlei shielded the aliʻi nui as Cook tried to force him to his feet. Kanaʻina approached Cook, who reacted by striking the chief with the broad side of his sword. Kanaʻina instantly grabbed Cook and lifted the man. Some accounts state that Kanaʻina did not intend to hit Cook while other descriptions say the chief struck the navigator across the head with his leiomano. Either way, Kanaʻina released Cook, who fell to the sand. As Cook tried to get up, the attendant, Nuaa fatally stabbed him with a metal dagger, ironically traded from Cook's ship during the same visit. According to John Ledyard, Cook fired the first shot in the skirmish and therefore was responsible for the circumstances that led to his death. [...] Ledyard describes the escalation in his journal: [...] "Cook attended to what this man said, and desired him to show him the Indian that had dared to attempt combat with him, <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was pointed out, Cook fired at him with a blank. The indian perceiving he received no damage from the fire rushed from without the crowd a second time, and threatened anyone who should oppose him. Cook perceiving this fired a ball, which entering the Indian's groin he fell and was drawn off by the rest. Cook perceiving the people determined to oppose his designs, and that he should not succeed without further bloodshed ordered the lieutenant of marines (Mr. Phillips) to withdraw his men and get them into the boats.....the instant they began to retreat, Cook was hit with a stone and perceiving the man who hove, shot him dead: the officers in the boats perceiving the guard retreating and hearing this third discharge ordered [...] the boats to fire.....Cook having at length reached the margin of the water between the fire of the boats waved with his hat to cease firing and come in, and while he was doing this a chief from behind stabbed him with one of our iron daggers just under the shoulder blade, and passed quite through the body. Cook fell with his face in the water and immediately expired." [...] This caused a close quarters melee between the townspeople and Cook's companions. Four of the Royal Marines (Corporal James Thomas and Privates Theophilus Hinks, Thomas Fachett, and John Allen) were killed, and two were wounded. The remaining sailors and marines fired as they fled to their small boat and rowed back to their ship, injuring and killing dozens of Native Hawaiians on the beach, including possibly High Chief Kanaʻina. Cook's ships did not leave Kealakekua bay until February 22nd. They remained for another week to continue repair of the mast and collect better quality drinking water. [...] According to John Ledyard's journal's hundreds of natives were shot in a series of ongoing skirmishes. The ships cannon was used on several occasions among the natives and a large portion of Kireekakooa, the southern town in the bay, was burned.|$|E
