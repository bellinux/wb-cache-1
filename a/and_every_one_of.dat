Gerard, in his extensive discussion of daffodils, both wild and cultivated ("bastard daffodils") described twenty four species in London gardens (1597), ("we have them all <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> them in our London gardens, in great abundance", p.114).|$|E

The work on defenses continued apace, and Menéndez, unable to compete with the French on the sea, sent off his larger vessels, retaining only some light craft.|$|E

She pulled a pair of red panties out of her purse, saying that these were not hers but belonged to her cheating boyfriend's mistress. During the performance, Beyoncé held out the microphone for the audience's response, which was [...] "is all I got in the end".

500|$|In 1973–74, Orr led the Bruins {{to another}} first-place {{finish in the}} regular season. His point total rebounded to 122 with 32 goals and 90 assists. [...] The Bruins {{made it to the}} Stanley Cup final, but lost this time to the Philadelphia Flyers. Flyers' coach Fred Shero commented: [...] "They had Orr and he can do an awful lot. But we've got 17 good hockey players <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> them put out. It was 17 against one." [...] That season, Orr set the record (since surpassed) for the most points in a game by a defenceman, scoring 3 goals and 4 assists in a November 15, 1973 game against the New York Rangers. One goal, a shot from the blue line, broke Rangers' defenceman Rod Seiling's stick.|$|E
500|$|... {{offers a}} {{different}} theory: The Acra {{was still standing}} in 139BCE when AntiochusVII Sidetes demanded it back from Simon, along with Jaffa and Gezer, two Hellenized cities Simon had captured. Simon was willing to discuss the two cities but {{made no mention of}} the Acra. It was at this point that he must have sealed its fate, as a way to deny the Seleucids any future claim or hold on Jerusalem. Thus, when AntiochusVII subdued the city during Hyrcanus I's reign, each <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> his demands were met—except the one demanding the stationing of a Seleucid garrison in the city. Hyrcanus may have been able to reject, and Antiochus to drop, this demand because there was nowhere to billet the garrison, as the Acra would no longer have been standing. This explanation places the razing of the Acra somewhere in the 130sBCE.|$|E
500|$|Rhimes {{entitled}} the episode [...] "Losing My Religion" [...] {{because she felt}} [...] "that {{is what happens to}} each intern in this episode. Each intern lets go of the things they've held onto all season. George lets go of loving Meredith. Cristina lets go of her well-checked emotions. Izzie is forced to let go of her idealism. And that leads to her letting go of medicine. Alex lets go of his rage against Izzie. And Meredith... well, Meredith just lets go." [...] The costumes were designed by Mimi Melgaard; Rhimes noted that everyone was dressed in dark funeral colors to the prom, except Stevens who was dressed in pink. Stevens' dress was an Amsale creation. Monologues done by the five main characters were used in this episode. Rhimes commented: [...] "this was something we'd never done and I wasn't sure would work. But you place those pages {{into the hands of the}} actors and each <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> them layered their characters' souls right into the dialogue." [...] The episode's theme was the prom; Rhimes said she wanted to do it since the beginning of the season.|$|E

500|$|The film had its {{official}} premiere in Alice Tully Hall at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York City on January 19, 2011. Melanne Verveer, United States Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women's Issues, gave a speech, saying, [...] "Each <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> us {{is called to}} act. I hope that tonight each of us will make their own commitment." [...] Additional screenings were held in Los Angeles and Chicago later that month. That October, Not My Life had its international premiere in London. CNN International aired the film in two parts {{a few days later}} as part of the CNN Freedom Project. The Swedish premiere was attended by Crown Princess Victoria. Bilheimer recognized that people combatting human trafficking are in need of resources, so he considered various options with respect to the intellectual property of Not My Life, ultimately deciding to release the film at charge in addition to selling licenses for unlimited private screenings. On November 1, an 83-minute version of the film was released on DVD by Worldwide Documentaries, which also began digitally distributing the film and selling the unlimited licenses. LexisNexis, the governments of Arizona and Minnesota, and the U.S. Fund for UNICEF all purchased licenses. The latter organization planned to use the film as part of an anti-human-trafficking campaign.|$|E

It is known that in both the Parthian Empire and Kushan Empire of Asia, ethnic Greeks continued to be employed after the Hellenistic period as musicians and athletes. The Book of the Later Han states that Emperor An transferred these entertainers from his countryside residence to the capital Luoyang, where they gave a performance at his court and were rewarded with gold, silver, and other gifts. Raoul McLaughlin notes that the Romans knew Burma as India Trans Gangem (India Beyond the Ganges) and that Ptolemy listed the cities of Burma. McLaughlin speculates that the Romans were selling slaves to the Burmese and that this is how the entertainers originally reached Burma before they were sent by the Burmese ruler to Emperor An in China. Syrian jugglers were renowned in Western Classical literature, and Chinese sources from the 2nd century BC to the 2nd century AD mention them as well.|$|E

500|$|Alex Hawgood from The New York Times {{wrote that}} at first listen the song came across as another generic dance hit. Hawgood however praised the song for its hidden subtext {{intended}} to be a response to gay suicides. Hawgood compared the song to the likes of Taylor Swift, Pink, Katy Perry and Lady Gaga, all of which [...] "represent a new wave of young (and mostly straight) women who are providing the soundtrack for a generation of gay fans coming to terms with their identity in a time of turbulent and confusing cultural messages." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called the track [...] "infectious" [...] and praised her honesty and sincerity on the track.

Club, in the album review of Cannibal, wrote that her [...] "let’s get fucking fucked-up" [...] attitude on the track was a positive calling her [...] "a complete and utter genius." [...] Hyden reviewed the song alongside fellow editor Genevieve Koski in a separate publication, giving the song a B and a D+, respectively. Hyden reiterated his comments from the album review in his review of the song, but added that the song was sonically similar to her previous singles [...] "Tik Tok" [...] and [...] "Take It Off", adding that on the song she [...] "seems a little more self-aware, imploring each <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> us to start 'dancing like we’re dumb.'". On the opposite end up the spectrum, Koski was critical of the song, criticizing her vocals with his consensus being that [...] "I want to give every Kesha song an 'F' on principle, but objectively speaking, I know there are far worse songs out there, so let’s average out a subjective F and an objective C+ to a D+." ...|$|E
