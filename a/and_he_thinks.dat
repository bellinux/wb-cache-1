5|$|Six years later, Logan {{is working}} as a logger in Canada, where {{he lives with his}} girlfriend Kayla Silverfox. Stryker and Zero {{approach}} Logan at work. Stryker reports that Wade and Bradley have been killed, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> someone is targeting the team's members. Logan refuses to rejoin Stryker, but after finding Kayla's bloodied body in the woods, Logan realizes Victor is responsible. He finds him at a local bar, but Logan loses the subsequent fight. Afterward, Stryker explains that Victor has gone rogue, and offers Logan a way to become strong enough to get his revenge. Logan undergoes a painful operation to reinforce his skeleton with adamantium, a virtually indestructible metal. Once the procedure is complete, Stryker attempts to betray Logan by ordering that his memory be erased so he can be used as Stryker's personal weapon, but Logan overhears this and escapes to a nearby farm, where an elderly couple take him in. Zero kills them the following morning and tries to kill Logan, but Logan takes down Zero's helicopter and swears to kill both Stryker and Victor.|$|E

500|$|For {{six months}} Mary has been {{tracking}} a large black-maned lion, determined {{to finish the}} hunt by Christmas. In subsequent chapters, Ernest worries that Mary is unable to kill the lion for various reasons: she is too short to see the prey in the tall grass; she misses her shots with other game; <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> she is too soft-hearted to kill the animal. During this period, Ernest becomes entranced with Debba, a woman from a local village, whom the others jokingly refer to as his second wife. From her and the villagers [...] he wants to learn tribal practices and customs.|$|E

500|$|Amy's role in {{the serial}} {{increased}} with her much publicised pregnancy storyline. The plot begins when Amy has sex with Cain Dingle (Jeff Hordley). Halfpenny said [...] "It's Amy who takes the lead and it goes from there." [...] Hordley explained that Amy's attention inflates Cain's ego <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> [...] "'aye, aye". It's still young but in his book, he's like, 'wahey, I've still got it'." [...] However, when he learns she is sixteen, [...] "he feels incredibly stupid and [...] "embarrassed." [...] Cain shows no guilt and orders her to keep her distance. Halfpenny said Amy is not fazed by Cain's attitude and uses the situation to make David jealous.|$|E
500|$|The storyline was {{concluded}} with a week's worth of episodes focusing on the pair's wedding and fallout. A trailer, which took over 15 hours to film, was produced to promote the episodes and featured several characters dressed in black and who could expose her affair with Carl, watching Mercedes go down the aisle. During the trailer Mercedes cried a black tear, done by the show's make-up artists putting black paint in Metcalfe's eye. Norbury opined that Riley {{was caught up in}} planning the wedding, and that his feelings for Mercedes were [...] "very strong", adding that Riley [...] "loves her to bits <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> that she's everything". In the lead up to the wedding it was shown that potential guests who could reveal the affair included Jacqui, Seth, Carl, Mercedes, Warren, Mitzeee and Doug Carter (PJ Brennan).|$|E
500|$|American chef Anthony Bourdain guest {{starred in}} the episode as himself. Selman wanted him on the show {{because he is a}} big fan <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> Marge would have a liking for him. Bourdain's {{appearance}} was cut short because the episode ended up being too long, and as a result, his [...] "bad boy persona is not fully explored," [...] Selman told Squid Ink. In addition to Bourdain, guest stars in the episode include chefs and media personalities Gordon Ramsay and Mario Batali as themselves. These three all appear in Marge's dream. When asked by Digital Spy about his appearance, Ramsay said that [...] "I grew up watching The Simpsons and love that they're foodies," [...] and joked that [...] "For God's sake, I had to promise Marge a spot on MasterChef to get on the bloody show!" [...] Selman wishes that he could have given Batali more than one line, but has admitted that [...] "You just can't fit everything into a 21-minute show." ...|$|E

500|$|Distribution {{rights for}} the United States were picked up at Sundance by IFC Films. Trinity Filmed Entertainment was the British distributor. The film was {{released}} in the United States and the United Kingdom on 24 September 2010. In both these countries, the film was distributed without the seventh of its nine reels. The running time was therefore 137 minutes at 25 frames per second, which the director had instructed that the film should be played at, or 142 minutes at the more common 24 frames per second. Noé says {{that none of the}} cut material is essential for the film. He describes it as [...] "some astro-visions, an orgy scene with Linda and the Japanese girl, the scene where you see [...] waking up at the morgue <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> he's alive but he's not, and then the camera goes down the plughole where she's tipping his ashes." [...] The reason the shorter version was made was that Noé had promised the investors to make an alternative edit if the film ended up being longer than two hours and 20 minutes. The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc in France on 1 December 2010. Each edition features both the complete version and the shorter cut.|$|E
500|$|Darren's ex-girlfriend, Suzanne, returns, {{pregnant}} by Darren with twins. Dawson said, [...] "At first [...] doesn’t {{believe her}} <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> it's a wind-up. When she threatens {{to go back}} to Spain he realises it's not what he wants and he stops her. He decides to man up and be a dad to his kids". A few days later, Suzanne, with Darren's help, gives birth to twins Jack and Francine. Dawson said that at first, Darren chooses to be in denial about it wants nothing to do with Suzanne because {{he does not want to}} lose Nancy. Dawson noted that the birth of Darren's babies is messy and surprising. Darren finds himself in a situation he never expected when he has to deliver the babies and accept responsibility for them. Dawson stated, [...] "I think it's a moment where Darren changes a little bit". Dawson added that Darren does [...] "step up to the mark" [...] and [...] "matures very quickly". Dawson felt that Darren enjoys being a father and it gives him a [...] "purpose in life" [...] which he has never had before. Dawson explained that Darren usually thinks of himself but is now thinking of the babies. E4, regarding Darren becoming a father, commented that due to his previous antics, he would not be an ideal candidate for [...] "Father of the year". The storyline is resolved when Cindy pays Suzanne £200,000 to return to Spain so that she can have Darren to herself. Suzanne accepts the money and leaves, taking Francine and Jack with her and leaving Darren heartbroken.|$|E
2500|$|Searle {{extended}} his inquiries into observer-relative phenomena {{by trying to}} understand social reality. Searle begins by arguing collective intentionality (e.g. [...] "we're going for a walk") is a distinct form of intentionality, not simply reducible to individual intentionality (e.g. [...] "I'm going for a walk with him and I think he thinks he's going for a walk with me <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> I think I'm going for a walk with him and ...").|$|E

2500|$|It {{was also}} {{confirmed}} by the producers that two characters would be killed off during the storyline. Rhys Lawson (played by Ben Barber) was confirmed {{to be the first}} fatality of the explosion. Barber's departure was previously announced in November 2012, but details of his character's exit were initially kept secret. While Rhys survived the explosion and the resulting collapse of the marquee, he later died of his injuries after discharging himself from the hospital. Barber commented [...] "Rhys is a headstrong guy <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> he is absolutely fine. But, his overconfidence is ultimately his undoing and, as he leaves the hospital, he collapses, leaving Kyle (Chris Milligan) kneeling over his lifeless body." ...|$|E
2500|$|Spinoza, in his Tractatus theologico-politicus, {{tried to}} give Van den Enden's {{political}} ideas a foundation in his own philosophy, {{by pointing out that}} democracy is the best form of government [...] "approaching most closely to that freedom which nature grants to every man". Other than Thomas Hobbes, Spinoza posited that Man does not give up the rights he possesses in the state of Nature to the State, when he enters the social contract. To him therefore leaving Man {{as close as possible to}} that state of Nature is important, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> that democracy accomplishes this best, as it is [...] "the most natural" [...] and [...] "rational" [...] form of government. This theme runs through most Dutch republican doctrine of the 17th century, before resurfacing in the work of the mid-18th-century French republican philosophers, and ultimately in the French Revolution.|$|E
2500|$|In Debrecen the city's mayor Lajos Kósa (Fidesz) {{was taking}} {{an active part}} of the demonstrations; he {{supported}} his party's plans to keep a rally in Budapest on Saturday (the rally had been cancelled since), and heavily criticized Gábor Demszky, the mayor of Budapest for his perceived inactivity. ("It's possible Gábor Demszky doesn't feel Budapest his own <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> that {{he has nothing to}} do when such things happen in the capital, but Debrecen is another city, it has a local government which cares for the city.") He also asked the demonstrators not to attack the MSZP's county headquarters in the city, stating that the building is Debrecen's property and the party is only renting it. (A similar thing happened in Miskolc where a speaker jokingly mentioned that [...] "we have the strength to break into the building, but we won't do it; that building will still be useful for something else.") ...|$|E

2500|$|To read Reston on Henry Kissinger today is, as it {{was during}} the Nixon administration, a little embarrassing. (Reston once titled one of his columns [...] "By Henry Kissinger with James Reston".) Nothing in his {{experience}} in Washington, Reston says over and over in these memoirs, [...] "was ever quite as good or as bad as the fashionable opinion of the day", <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> of Kissinger as a prime example of this. [...] But in praising Kissinger, Reston is praising a man who regularly misled him, who wiretapped NSC staff members to determine who was leaking to reporters when they revealed his unconstitutional maneuverings, and who urged Nixon to prosecute Reston's newspaper for its constitutionally protected publication of the Pentagon Papers. During the infamous 1972 Christmas bombing of North Vietnam, Reston wrote of Kissinger that [...] "he has said nothing in public about the bombing in North Vietnam, which he undoubtedly opposes.... If the bombing goes on ... Mr. Kissinger will be free to resign." [...] The only problem with the interpretation, however, was that the bombings were Kissinger's idea. He misled Reston about his own position and then misled the White House staff about these conversations, finally admitting the truth when confronted with his phone records.|$|E
2500|$|When Larry announces his {{leave of}} absence to board the International Space Station (in the episode [...] "Brutus"), Charlie is shocked and upset. He is in denial about Larry's ambitions <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> reason of the risks {{involved}} will assert itself firmly in Larry's mind. He reasons that apparently Larry wouldn't do such a thing. Larry remands his few prized possessions to him, and he is grateful for the gesture. When he tells him his concerns, Larry is angered. Amita says to Larry, [...] " [...] has never dreamt of something he couldn't reach, so {{he has no idea}} {{what it is like to}} want something he is not able to get. So how could he understand how much [...] you would give up when this chance comes along?" [...] Larry understands and decides to ignore Charlie's protestations. Though neither apologize, they are on good terms. Charlie says to Amita that he does not know what he would do without him, as he peruses through Larry's precious items that were bestowed upon him. In [...] "Killer Chat", he says that he was glad that Larry's dream could come true, but feels conflicted about being relieved when he discovers that Larry might have been scrapped from the mission when NASA learned of his eccentric indulgences such as sleeping in the campus steam tunnels. However, Charlie agrees with Megan in wanting to help Larry and personally vouches for him. Eppes' words and affiliation with the NSA gets him back on the mission, thus, repaying a debt as Larry helped launch him into the academic firmament. Earlier, he had given him back his lucky T-shirt.|$|E
2500|$|After his resignation, {{from his}} post as Commissioner of the Food and Drugs Administration in December 1969, Dr. Herbert L. Ley, Jr. [...] In an {{interview}} to the New York Times, warned {{the public about the}} FDA’s inability to safeguard consumers. People were being misled, he believed “The thing [...] that bugs me is that the people think the FDA is protecting them - it isn’t. What the FDA is doing and what the public thinks it’s doing are as different as night and day,” he said. The agency, in his opinion, did not have the motivation to protect consumers, faced budget shortfalls, and lacked support from the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. Dr. Ley was critical of Congress, the Administration and the drug industry, he stated that he had [...] "constant, tremendous, sometimes unmerciful pressure" [...] from the drug industry and that the drug company lobbyists, combined with the politicians who worked on behalf of their patrons, could bring “tremendous pressure” to bear on him and his staff, to try preventing FDA restrictions on their drugs. The interview concluded with Ley stating that the entire issue was about money, “pure and simple”. On December 15, 1999, interviewed for the oral history program of the FDA History Office, Dr. Ley shared that from the first controversy in his tenure as FDA Commissioner he had a [...] "gut feeling" [...] that his life expectancy at the FDA was probably limited. He said he had done everything by the book, both in the FDA and the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> that what the Administration was really wishing, was that he would stonewall the whole Academy report, because it was goring too many pharmaceutical companies.|$|E

2500|$|According to Bob Carter and Rae Cooper, the U.K. {{went through}} several decades of {{uncertainty}} for unions. Specifically, {{conditions of the}} 1970s through the 1990s in the U.K. were particularly prone to hostile conditions for unions. Carter and Cooper state that British unions, like the [...] "Trades Union Congress (TUC)" [...] had to face [...] "government hostility" [...] and [...] "job losses." [...] In response to unfavorable conditions for unions, according to Carter and Cooper, the TUC tried implementing the [...] "servicing" [...] model, but it failed to provide measurable improvements in the labor movement or in [...] "membership." [...] According to Bob Carter, the [...] "first major British union" [...] to employ the organizing model was [...] "Manufacturing, Science and Finance (MSF)," [...] not necessarily the TUC. Bob Carter and Rae Cooper state that MSF was a combined union, which was formed from both the [...] "Association of Scientific, Technical, Managerial, and Supervisory Staffs (ASTMS)" [...] and the [...] "Technical Advisory Staffs (TASS)." [...] Bob Carter says that when ASTMS and TASS came together to form MSF, the merged organization more closely resembled ASTMS than TASS. According to Carter and Cooper, {{the history of the}} ASTMS showed that it was [...] "...a much looser form of organization,", while TASS was more [...] "Communist." [...] Carter states that MSF began implementing the [...] "MSF policy Organising Works" [...] in 1996. Carter makes the case that the MSF's implementation of the organizing model came after they tried [...] "Reinforcement of a servicing culuture...," [...] which was, overall, not very successful. This is why they switched their strategy toward using the organizing model, rather than the servicing model. However, according to Carter, MSF had many problems arise {{in the wake of the}} model's adoption, such as the fact that [...] "It was conceived and implemented from the top downwards...without wide discussion in the union." [...] Carter sees this as a fundamental problem posed by the organizing model, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> it must be overcome in order for it to be effective.|$|E
2500|$|A {{final twist}} in Steven's story was his {{involvement}} in a seemingly unrelated plotline that had been running simultaneously to Steven's personal dilemma, the disappearance of his half sister Lucy (Melissa Suffield). In episodes that aired in May 2008, {{it was revealed that}} Steven had been hiding his runaway sister in a caravan, poisoning her mind against Ian and persuading her to flee the country. Explaining his character's motives, Sidwell said, [...] "It’s all about Ian again. Steven wants all Ian’s love and attention and he feels Lucy is getting in the way. She’s the one who gets most of Ian’s time and energy <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> getting her out of the picture will leave Ian all for him [...] He’s been brainwashing her into thinking Ian doesn’t care if she never goes home again [...] His real plan is to keep her out of Ian’s life for good [...] He craves Ian’s full attention and is willing {{to do whatever it takes}} to make that happen. He doesn’t exactly plan to be evil but he is dangerous." [...] In the end Steven's plan was discovered by his grandmother Pat, leading Steven to attempt to suffocate her to death before she revealed the truth to Ian. An EastEnders source told Digital Spy: [...] "Steven hits rock bottom when Pat finds out that he's been hiding Lucy for all these weeks while his family have been frantically searching for her [...] when Pat realises that Steven knows where Lucy is, he takes drastic steps to prevent his beloved nan from revealing all to Ian. He goes from confused to psycho in a matter of minutes, grabbing a pillow and pushing it onto her face." [...] Sidwell added, [...] "Steven is deadly! He is willing to do whatever it takes to get what he wants [...] including murder." [...] The murder attempt was stopped by Ian, and after discovering the truth from Pat, Ian chased Steven to London's St. Pancras Station (where he was intending to put Lucy on the Eurostar to Paris) and convinced Lucy to return home. Sidwell commented, [...] "Steven is such a good manipulator he thinks Lucy will side with him. He’s shocked when she doesn’t and when she agrees to go home with Ian." [...] In Steven's final scenes, Ian rejects Steven as his son once again, telling him [...] "I never give up on my family. But you're not my family, are you? You're your mother's son and you're Simon's son, and that really used to hurt. Now I thank God I never produced anything as sick and twisted as you." [...] Steven then departed from Walford after Ian vowed to kill him if he ever saw him again.|$|E
