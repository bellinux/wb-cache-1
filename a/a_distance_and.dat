5|$|Astaroth's {{gameplay}} {{was developed}} around {{the concept of}} a powerful fighter that struck at <b>a</b> <b>distance,</b> <b>and</b> has been noted as one of the strongest characters in the Soul series, requiring few mistakes to be made when fighting against Astaroth to defeat him. Measures were put into effect to make the character unique by allowing the player to hold attack buttons in order to strengthen attacks, to contrast against other large character fighting styles in Soulcalibur such as Nightmare's multiple fighting stances.|$|E
5|$|MacLachlan {{found himself}} {{at the heart of}} the battle for the island before the {{squadron}} arrived. On 27 November the convoy came under attack from the Italian Navy in the Battle of Cape Spartivento. MacLachlan saw the Italian fleet at <b>a</b> <b>distance</b> <b>and</b> witnessed enemy shells splashing around the ship. He also witnessed an attack by Italian Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 bombers but they failed to damage the ships. Most of the Hurricanes that took off from the Argus fell into the water out of fuel. The pilots had not run the Hurricanes at economic speeds for fuel consumption.|$|E
5|$|The Dashwoods soon {{learn that}} Miss Steele has become Mrs. Ferrars {{and assume that}} she is married to Edward. Later when Edward visits their house, they learn that Miss Steele {{unexpectedly}} jilted him in favor of his brother Robert, and Edward is thus released from his engagement. Edward proposes to and marries Elinor. Edward becomes a vicar, under the patronage of Colonel Brandon, whom Marianne marries. Willoughby is seen watching their wedding from <b>a</b> <b>distance,</b> <b>and</b> then rides away.|$|E

The tear streaks {{combined}} with the black lips and the contrasting white fur give the face a striking appearance and form clear expressions when viewed from a close range. The ears and the face are obscure from <b>a</b> <b>distance,</b> <b>and</b> so are the expressions. On the other hand, the tail is quite conspicuous and is probably used by mothers to direct juveniles to follow them.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} An-2s {{had observed}} the attack from <b>a</b> <b>distance</b> <b>and</b> {{managed to escape}} without damage. Four Hmongs, two men and two women, {{had been killed by}} the communist attack. Nevertheless, the TSQ-81 radar and its associated equipment was undamaged. Shortly afterwards, what remained of one of the An-2 biplanes was put on display in front of the That Luang Monument, Vientiane’s most important Buddhist shrine, as proof of North Vietnamese military activities in the kingdom. Despite the attack, the U.S. Embassy in Vientiane and the USAF refused to alter their strategy for defending Lima Site 85. Lieutenant-Colonel Clarence F. Blanton, commander of USAF personnel at the facility, was given no authority to supervise his own perimeter or to order a retreat if they again came under attack. Throughout January and February, intelligence collected by the Hmongs confirmed that a major assault on Lima Site 85 was being prepared, but Sullivan and the U.S. military took no steps to strengthen the defenses. In late February, a Combat Controller, Technical Sergeant James Gary, arrived to augment the defenses by directing air strikes. He was replaced in this duty by Sergeant Roger D. Huffman on about 4 March.|$|E
5|$|The {{winners of}} the 1910 Gordon Bennett Cup, Alan R. Hawley and Augustus Post, set <b>a</b> <b>distance</b> <b>and</b> {{duration}} record of 1,173 miles in 44 hours and 25 minutes, but the pair of experienced balloonists landed in a remote section of Canadian wilderness in Quebec. After a week passed with no word from the team, search parties were formed by the Aero Club of America, but many newspapers reported that the men were likely dead. Instead they emerged after ten days, assisted by two local trappers who had been out on a hunting trip and happened to run into them. Hawley had injured a knee, but otherwise the pair were unharmed and received a hero's welcome upon their safe return.|$|E

5|$|The Battle for Middle-earth II {{introduces}} {{three new}} factions with unique units and heroes: Goblins, Dwarves, and Elves. Rohan and Gondor {{are combined into}} one faction called Men of the West. Along with Mordor and Isengard from , there are six playable factions. The troops of Gondor provide a solid offense and defense with standard infantry and archers, and the Rohirrim of Rohan act as elite cavalry. The Elven archers are effective at inflicting damage from <b>a</b> <b>distance,</b> <b>and</b> their support units, the Ents, can perform a combination of melee and siege attacks, they are often considered the strongest defensive faction due to their strong missile units and powerful 'silverthorn arrows'. Although slow and expensive, Dwarven infantry, pikemen, and axe-throwers are very powerful and well-armored allowing them to prevail in even the longest clashes with enemy troops. A collection of wild creatures and beasts of Middle-earth make up the Goblin faction, this includes goblins, trolls, spiders, and dragons, which are effective in large numbers. Their only advantage is that the goblin archer and soldier units are cheap to make at only 75 resources and build faster than other basic infantry. Isengard troops are highly trained Uruk-hai under Saruman's command. Berserkers are used by Isengard as one-man armies that move extremely fast and deal significant damage (particularly to enemy buildings and heroes). Additionally, Isengard is the only Evil faction that can build walls. Mordor forces are a mixture of Orcs, Men, Trolls, Mumakil, and Sauron's lieutenants. Mordor Orcs have tough armor, making them useful for absorbing enemy damage while stronger units attack enemies. Trolls contribute greatly to the Mordor offensives, having strong melee attacks {{and the ability to}} throw boulders or wield trees like swords.|$|E

25|$|While Aphanoascus fulvescens is a geophilic fungus, {{it is also}} {{opportunistic}} {{and therefore}} has been isolated from humans and animals on occasion. In order to cause infection, the fungus must first adhere to the host cells. In vivo and in vitro experiments have proposed the possible role of secreted serine proteases in order to mediate this adhesion. Adhesion of A. fulvescens to the host cell is necessary, because the organism cannot degrade keratin from <b>a</b> <b>distance</b> <b>and</b> instead uses pressure to penetrate the keratin-rich cells of the host.|$|E

25|$|In 1745, Jean-Antoine Nollet {{developed}} {{a theory of}} electrical attraction and repulsion that supposed {{the existence of a}} continuous flow of electrical matter between charged bodies. Nollet’s theory at first gained wide acceptance, but met resistance in 1752 with the translation of Franklin’s Experiments and Observations on Electricity into French. Franklin and Nollet debated the nature of electricity, with Franklin supporting action at <b>a</b> <b>distance</b> <b>and</b> two qualitatively opposing types of electricity, and Nollet advocating mechanical action and a single type of electrical fluid. Franklin's argument eventually won and Nollet’s theory was abandoned.|$|E
25|$|However, a {{striking}} {{example of the}} line used to divide Dada and Surrealism among art experts is the pairing of 1925's Little Machine Constructed by Minimax Dadamax in Person (Von minimax dadamax selbst konstruiertes maschinchen) with The Kiss (Le Baiser) from 1927 by Max Ernst. The first is generally held to have <b>a</b> <b>distance,</b> <b>and</b> erotic subtext, whereas the second presents an erotic act openly and directly. In the second the influence of Miró and the drawing style of Picasso is visible {{with the use of}} fluid curving and intersecting lines and colour, whereas the first takes a directness that would later be influential in movements such as Pop art.|$|E
25|$|Curbside mailboxes, {{known in}} Canada as rural mailboxes, must be weatherproof, have {{space for the}} name of the mailbox owner, and possess a signal device on the {{right-hand}} side (when facing the front of the mailbox) for pickup of outgoing mail.

25|$|A pilot cutter {{cruising}} in {{the vicinity}} of Lundy Island had encountered Montagu a short time earlier. The battleship had stopped engines, come abreast, and hailed from the bridge requesting <b>a</b> <b>distance</b> <b>and</b> bearing for Hartland Point on the mainland of England. Though the cutter supplied these accurately, the voice from the battleships bridge replied that they must be wrong and that the pilot cutter must have lost her bearings. As Montagu restarted her engines and began to move ahead, the cutter shouted back that on her present course Montagu would be on Shutter Rock within ten minutes, and a short time later the sound of the battleship running aground carried through the fog.|$|E
25|$|Partly in {{consideration}} of Le Sage's theory, Pierre-Simon Laplace undertook to determine the necessary speed of gravity {{in order to be}} consistent with astronomical observations. He calculated that the speed must be “at least a hundred millions of times greater than that of light”, in order to avoid unacceptably large inequalities due to aberration effects in the lunar motion. This was taken by most researchers, including Laplace, as support for the Newtonian concept of instantaneous action at <b>a</b> <b>distance,</b> <b>and</b> to indicate the implausibility of any model such as Le Sage's. Laplace also argued that to maintain mass-proportionality the upper limit for earth's molecular surface area is at the most the ten-millionth of earth surface. To Le Sage's disappointment, Laplace never directly mentioned Le Sage's theory in his works.|$|E
25|$|Mohammed Bouyeri, a 26-year-old Dutch Moroccan Islamist {{and member}} of the Muslim {{terrorist}} organisation Hofstad Group, assassinated van Gogh in an Amsterdam street on 2 November 2004. Bouyeri shot van Gogh with a handgun eight times, first from <b>a</b> <b>distance</b> <b>and</b> then at short range as the director lay wounded on the ground. He was already dead when Bouyeri cut his throat with a large knife and tried to decapitate him. Bouyeri left a letter pinned to Van Gogh's body with a small knife; it was primarily a death threat to Hirsi Ali. The Dutch secret service immediately raised the level of security they provided to Hirsi Ali. At van Gogh's funeral, his mother urged Hirsi Ali to continue the work that she and van Gogh had done together. Bouyeri was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole.|$|E
