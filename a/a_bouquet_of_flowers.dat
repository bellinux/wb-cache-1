The writer also highlights the part where the singer supposedly becomes strengthened with a miracle potion, a further play on the [...] "Child/Man" [...] theme. Furthermore, Curtis observes that Paul and Linda McCartney seem {{to act as if}} they are Jackson's parents in the short film.

Not being tenured, she was unsure how the information would be received. However, word got out: [...] "I was jet-propelled out of the closet.

[...] However, following a bitter divorce, and just as the Naiad Press editions of her books were released, Bannon endured a bout of chronic fatigue syndrome, which she connects to repressing herself for so long.

Piaget also used the psychoanalytic method initially developed by Sigmund Freud. The purpose of using such method was to examine the unconscious mind, as well as to continue parallel studies using different research methods. Psychoanalysis was later rejected by Piaget, as he thought it was insufficiently empirical (Mayer, 2005).|$|R
