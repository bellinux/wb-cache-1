5|$|Doug Kaufman, a co-designer of Civilization II, {{was invited}} to join {{development}} as a game balancer. Reynolds cited the Alpha Centauris balance for the greater sense of urgency and the more pressing pacing than in his earlier game, Sid Meier's Colonization. According to producer Timothy Train, in designing the strengths <b>and</b> <b>weaknesses</b> <b>of</b> the factions, {{the goal was to}} suggest, without requiring, certain strategies and give the player interesting and fun things to do without unbalancing the game. He didn't want a faction to be dependent on its strength or a faction's power to be dominant over the rest. Train felt that fun meant the factions always have something fun to do with their attributes.|$|E
5|$|Battles {{play out}} using a turn-based system where each unit {{on both sides}} is given their chance to move and act. Characters move and attack within the same turn, {{and in a few}} cases units can take two moves in a turn. A key part of combat is the Weapons Triangle, a new {{addition}} which governs the opposing strengths <b>and</b> <b>weaknesses</b> <b>of</b> weapon types based on a rock–paper–scissors system - lances are stronger than swords, swords are stronger than axes, and axes are stronger than lances. A secondary system governs the magic system, where Fire, Lightning, and Wind spells have varying strengths and weaknesses against each other. Each unit has a character class which determines their weapon, skill set, movement and attack range, how much effect they have on other units, which latent skills they possess, and whether they use passive or aggressive skills when in combat. Different weapon types also affect character movement and battle performance: for instance, a powerful sword deals damage while slowing a character's movement.|$|E

5|$|Strategically, as {{a result}} of the {{fighting}} around Milne Bay, Japanese operations within the region were constrained. The defeat at Milne Bay kept them from bypassing the holding action that the Australians were conducting on the Kokoda Track. Milne Bay showed the limits of Japanese capability to expand using relatively small forces in the face of increasingly larger Allied troop concentrations and command of the air. The Japanese commanders were then forced to change their plans in the region, shifting their focus towards repelling the US forces that had landed on Guadalcanal, while maintaining a smaller effort around Buna–Gona, under Major General Tomitarō Horii. Once they had retaken Guadalcanal, they planned to reinforce Horii's forces and launch a reinvigorated attack on the Australians around Port Moresby. In the end, subsequent defeats at Buna–Gona and on Guadalcanal did not allow them to implement these plans, as the Allies gained the ascendency in the region throughout late 1942 and the Japanese were forced to fall back to the northern coast of New Guinea. In the aftermath of the battle, a large amount of intelligence was also gained by the Allies, providing their planners with a better understanding of the strengths <b>and</b> <b>weaknesses</b> <b>of</b> the Japanese and their equipment. It also demonstrated that the Militia were an effective fighting force.|$|E

40|$|The way {{in which}} society views {{addiction}} underlies how it treats, understands, blames, or even punishes those with addictive behaviours. This thought-provoking new book presents an original philosophical analysis bringing together addiction <b>and</b> <b>weakness</b> <b>of</b> will. Within the book, the author develops an integrated account of these two phenomena, rooted in a classical conception of akrasia as valuing without intending {{and at the same}} time intending without valuing. This fascinating and suggestive account addresses a number of paradoxes faced by current thinking about addiction <b>and</b> <b>weakness</b> <b>of</b> will, in particular the significance of control and intention for responsible action. Addiction <b>and</b> <b>Weakness</b> <b>of</b> Will makes an original contribution to central issues in moral psychology and philosophy of action, including the relationship between responsibility and intentional agency, and the nature and scope of moral appraisal. The book is valuable for philosophers, ethicists and psychiatrists with an interest in philosophy...|$|R

25|$|Behavioural change {{theories}} are not universally accepted. Criticisms include the theories' emphases on individual behaviour {{and a general}} disregard for the influence of environmental factors on behaviour.

Such criticism illuminates the strengths <b>and</b> <b>weaknesses</b> <b>of</b> the theories, showing that {{there is room for}} further research into behavioural change theories.|$|E

25|$|In {{the last}} couple of decades, there has been a growing {{movement}} to integrate the various therapeutic approaches, especially with an increased understanding of cultural, gender, spiritual, and sexual-orientation issues. Clinical psychologists are beginning to look at the various strengths <b>and</b> <b>weaknesses</b> <b>of</b> each orientation while also working with related fields, such as neuroscience, behavioral genetics, evolutionary biology, and psychopharmacology.

25|$|Modern tests do not {{necessarily}} measure all of these broad abilities. For example, Gq and Grw {{may be seen as}} measures of school achievement and not IQ. Gt may be difficult to measure without special equipment. g was earlier often subdivided into only Gf and Gc, which were thought to correspond to the nonverbal or performance subtests and verbal subtests in earlier versions of the popular Wechsler IQ test. More recent research has shown the situation to be more complex. Modern comprehensive IQ tests do not stop at reporting a single IQ score. Although they still give an overall score, they now also give scores for many of these more restricted abilities, identifying particular strengths <b>and</b> <b>weaknesses</b> <b>of</b> an individual.|$|E

He vowed to increase the agency's role in emerging business markets, bring more information- and technology-based companies into the organization, grow the regional business base, and engage with government partners. Cunningham spent {{the first six months}} of his tenure meeting with Lehigh Valley stakeholders and business leaders, identifying their needs and concerns. He then commissioned Garner Economics, an Atlanta-based economic consulting firm, to conduct an analysis of the region and recommend economic development and marketing strategies for the Lehigh Valley. The study identified the economic strengths <b>and</b> <b>weaknesses</b> <b>of</b> the region and defined a regional approach for development and growth.

25|$|Much of {{the naval}} combat mini-game goes into {{attempting}} to outmaneuver the enemy, bringing the enemy vessel into cannon range while trying {{to stay out of}} the enemy's line of fire. The player may also attempt to board the enemy as quickly as possible to avoid harm to his ship or the target. Wind direction and specific ship capabilities feature heavily into this. Some ships are adept at sailing at sharp angles to the wind direction, while others can only gain reasonable speed while sailing across or with the wind. Turning speed is also different between ship types, and so some ships can actually weave between cannonballs, while others turn very slowly and cannot make fancy maneuvers. There is great emphasis on knowing the particular strengths <b>and</b> <b>weaknesses</b> <b>of</b> one's ship, and the ability to gauge wind direction continuously and act accordingly.|$|E
25|$|Stilwell was {{replaced}} by General Albert C. Wedemeyer, who received a telegram from General Marshall on October 27, 1944 directing him to proceed to China to assume command of the China theatre and replace General Stilwell. Wedemeyer later recalled his initial dread over the assignment, as service in the China theater was considered a graveyard for American officials, both military and diplomatic. When Wedemeyer actually arrived at Stilwell’s headquarters after Stilwell’s dismissal, Wedemeyer was dismayed to discover that Stilwell had intentionally departed without seeing him, and did not leave a single briefing paper for his guidance, though departing U.S. military commanders habitually greeted their replacement in order to thoroughly brief them on the strengths <b>and</b> <b>weaknesses</b> <b>of</b> headquarters staff, the issues confronting the command, and planned operations. Searching the offices, Wedemeyer could find no documentary record of Stilwell's plans or records of his former or future operations. General Wedemeyer then spoke with Stilwell’s staff officers but learned little from them because Stilwell, according to the staff, kept everything in his “hip pocket”.|$|E
