This feature enables the multi homed mobile devices to seamlessly roam across various wireless access technologies and to connect always {{to the best}} available <b>access</b> <b>network</b> that provides the best QOS at a minimum cost. Different applications have different QOS requirements and accordingly their choice of <b>access</b> <b>network</b> selection varies.

40|$|Abstract — We {{propose a}} novel hybrid optical {{wireless}} <b>access</b> <b>network</b> architecture {{that is designed}} for highly populated metropolitan area. This hybrid <b>access</b> <b>network</b> consists of an optical grid network providing broadband backhauling, and many wireless mesh networks penetrating into the neighborhoods to provide low cost, ubiquitous links. This hybrid <b>access</b> <b>network</b> architecture is scalable and flexible enough to easily meet varying demands for bandwidth of end users: As bandwidth demand increases, {{the capacity of the}} hybrid <b>access</b> <b>network</b> can be upgraded by deploying more access points in the wireless mesh network until its performance begins to degrade due to high hop-counts. As the performance degrade occurs, additional fiber are deployed (or dark fibers activated) to enhance the overall network capacity. On the optical grid backhauling network, we propose a hierarchical loop routing protocol to enhance the routing efficiency. Intra-cell hybrid adaptive routing protocols and algorithms are proposed to achieve the optimum network performance provided by this hybrid <b>access</b> <b>network...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Access networks, in particular, Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) equipment, are a {{significant}} source of energy con-sumption for wireline operators. Replacing large monolithic DSLAMs with smaller remote DSLAM units closer to customers can reduce the energy consumption as well as increase the reach of the <b>access</b> <b>network.</b> This paper attempts to formalize the design and optimization of the “last mile ” wireline <b>access</b> <b>network</b> with energy as one of the costs to be minimized. In particular, the placement of remote DSLAM units needs to be optimized. We propose solutions for two scenarios. For the scenario where an existing all-copper network from the central office to the customers is to be transformed into a fiber-copper network with remote DSLAM units, we present efficient polynomial-time solutions. For the green-field scenario, where both the <b>access</b> <b>network</b> layout and the placement of remote DSLAM units must be determined, we show that this problem is NP-complete. We present an optimal ILP formulation and also design an efficient heuristic-based approach to build a power and cost optimized <b>access</b> <b>network.</b> Our heuristic-based approach yields results that are very close to optimal. We show how the power consumption of the <b>access</b> <b>network</b> can be reduced by carefully planning the <b>access</b> <b>network</b> and introducing remote DSLAM units. I...|$|R
