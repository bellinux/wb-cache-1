The publisher has claimed {{in excess of}} 25 million subscribers of the game, although this number is based upon a quantity of registered users (rather than <b>active</b> <b>subscribers).</b> 2002 also saw the release of MapleStory, another sprite-based title, which was completely free-to-play—instead of charging a monthly fee, it generated revenue by selling in-game [...] "enhancements". MapleStory {{would go on to}} become {{a major player in the}} new market for free-to-play MMORPGs (generating huge numbers of registered accounts across its many versions), if it did not introduce the market by itself.|$|E

30|$|In {{the analog}} cable TV network, all the {{channels}} are available simultaneously for subscribers. Analog cable TV transmits all the channels at once via a fixed cable to the <b>subscribers,</b> and each <b>active</b> <b>subscriber</b> then chooses a channel for viewing {{by using a}} set-top box (STB). Therefore, channel change is almost instantaneous. But IPTV differs significantly from analog cable TV, in its transmission system. In the IPTV system, a subscriber uses the STB to request for only the specific channel required at that time, and only the required channel is transmitted to this user (possibly by means of multicast).|$|R

40|$|In {{cellular}} mobile communication systems, while an <b>active</b> <b>subscriber</b> is {{moving from one}} cell to another, the service of his call needs {{to be handed over}} to the base station of the new cell. In such a case, cutting the service, due to all channels being busy at the new base station, would be more annoying to subscribers than normal congestion at the first initiation of calls. This paper is concerned with providing a simple approach for choosing the optimum set of channels that need to be reserved for hand-over calls, while maintaining an acceptable overall system performance. The approach evaluates channel reservation at the cell level, taking into account the offered traffic, that is both the newly initiated original traffic and the hand-over traffic. The approach produces a simple mathematical solution based on Erlang-B formula. It uses the concept of 'Combined Failure Rate' to evaluate the required reservation. The approach is supported by a simulation study that verifies its validity. Applications of the approach to illustrate its use are also presented. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
