40|$|Abstract—IEEE 802. 11 {{systems are}} drawing an ever {{increasing}} interest for wireless industrial communication, also {{thanks to the}} interesting features provided by the most recent and <b>advanced</b> <b>amendments</b> to this standard, such as IEEE 802. 11 n. Due to the intrinsic unreliability of the wireless medium, the current research efforts aim at improving both timeliness and reliability of such a protocol in view of its adoption for real–time applications. A significant issue {{in this context is}} represented by the reduction of the randomness that affects packet delivery times. An important benefit in this direction can be obtained by the deactivation of the standard legacy carrier sensing and backoff procedures. In this paper we show, through a simulative assessment, that a fine control of such features leads to improved real–time performance. I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In 1992, Douglas Bruce, a non-practicing {{lawyer and}} {{landlord}} from Colorado Springs, Colorado, successfully "mobilized " popular sup-port for Amendment 1, a ballot initiative that has restricted the taxing and spending powers {{of state and}} local governments in Colorado. For most Coloradans, "Douglas Bruce " is now a household name. Using a historical perspective to examine the role Bruce played in <b>advancing</b> <b>Amendment</b> 1, this study offers the analytic concepts of faux populism, populist entrepre-neurs, and the public mood. Faux populism is the transposition of an ill-defined, but tangible public mood into a ready-made ballot initiative that is offered to the people by a populist entrepreneur. The primary question driving this inquiry is: How did Douglas Bruce successfully tap the wide-spread, but ambiguous animosity held by many Coloradans towards govern-ment and taxes, and turn it into his particular cause of limiting the taxing and spending powers ofstate and local governments? This is a chance for the alienated, disenfranchised voter who think...|$|R

In the leaves, zinc was largely excluded from leaf cells, and about approximately 50 % was in the form of phosphate precipitates, and the other 50 % was complexed by cysteine and histidine residues. The reported data provide new information concerning the mechanisms of zinc tolerance in E. vesicaria L.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis {{argues that the}} chairmen of the defense-related committees in the House and Senate continue to wield enormous power over defense legislation. This theory {{is based on a}} detailed empirical analysis of the fate of amendments offered to the defense authorization and appropriation bills from 1981 - 1992. To measure the power of the chairmen, the thesis assesses how often their positions were sustained on floor <b>amendments.</b> <b>Data</b> also is analyzed on which members tended to offer amendments, whether the passage rate was higher for amendments that did not alter defense spending, and a variety of related issues. It was found that 95. 53 % of amendments offered to defense authorization bill in the Senate and 95. 1 % in the House, the full Senate and house voted in accordance with the preference of the chairmen of their respective Armed Services Committees. An even higher percentage of victory (96. 1) was achieved by the chairmen of the House and Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittees. Data analysis shows that when amendments are offered to defense legislation, committee chairmen still call the shots. [URL] United States Nav...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The Synar Amendment {{requires}} {{states and}} territories {{to enact a}} law prohibiting the sale of tobacco to minors and to enforce that law {{in a manner that}} could reasonably be expected to decrease the availability of tobacco to minors. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and applicant states and territories are complying with the Synar <b>Amendment.</b> <b>DATA</b> SOURCES: Block grant applications from 59 states and territories describing activities during federal fiscal year 1997. MEASURES: Whether applicants had enacted a tobacco sales law without loopholes, conducted enforcement inspections, penalized violators, and conducted a valid statewide survey with violation rates below the permissible threshold, and whether DHHS actions were consistent with the statutory requirements of the Synar Amendment. RESULTS: Three applicants had laws containing loopholes, 8 failed to conduct enforcement inspections, 8 failed to prosecute violators, 6 failed to conduct a valid survey, and 8 failed to demonstrate compliance with violation rate targets. Fifteen applicants failed 1 or more criteria, but none was ultimately penalized by DHHS. Fourteen sources of bias were identified in state survey protocols that could substantially lower reported violation rates. CONCLUSIONS: A few states did a remarkable job with enforcement, while many others made little effort. Because the DHHS regulations are so weak and DHHS is willing to accept biased surveys, states can be in full compliance with the regulations without ever enforcing their laws or having any impact on the availability of tobacco to minors...|$|R
5000|$|The {{discussion}} paper grouped these proposals into three different categories: those the Government wished to progress, those the Government was considering, {{and those on}} which the Government was seeking the Committee's opinion. Though the paper contained eighteen proposals and forty-one individual reforms, the suggestion that carriage service providers (CSPs) be required to retain information on the way Australians use the internet and mobile phones elicited much consternation and comment from the community. This was a point the Committee highlighted in its final report to the Government:"The potential data retention regime attracted {{a large amount of}} criticism and comment from organizations and concerned individuals. These organizations and individuals generally considered any potential data retention regime a significant risk to both the security and their privacy. In addition to these general comments, the Committee received a large volume of form letter correspondence."On 24 June 2013, the Committee issued its report and put the decision on whether to progress with a mandatory data retention scheme back in the Government's hands. On the same day the report was released, Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus announced the Government would not be pursuing its proposal. On 30 October 2014, the Abbott Government introduced the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) <b>Amendment</b> (<b>Data</b> Retention) Bill 2014 into the House of Representatives. [...] On 21 November 2014, the Attorney-General Senator George Brandis wrote to the PJCIS, referring the provisions of the Bill for inquiry.|$|R
5000|$|According to an {{interview}} he gave to PJTV, [...] Barnett utilized the great volume of constructive feedback to further refine his ideas for the amendment. He also decided to disaggregate the amendment into multiple parts so that opposition to {{a few of the}} ideas would not sink the entire amendment. He decided to add some popular proposed constitutional amendments, addressing such issues as the fairtax, the line item veto, balanced budgets, and judicial activism to build a broad coalition of groups that may <b>advance</b> the <b>amendments.</b> He hopes to have the Tea Party movement rally around this bill. He claims to have deliberately avoided some amendments that might be seen as 'kooky' such as the repeal of the Seventeenth Amendment, which effected the direct election of senators rather than their selection by the state legislatures, to protect the rest of the project.|$|R

No measurable progress in reducing violation rates was reported by 30 states, with 16 reporting an increase during the previous year. Twenty-four applicants were granted delays. CONCLUSIONS: States that demonstrated remarkable progress were balanced by states with worsening performance; as a whole there was no significant national progress toward reducing the availability of tobacco to youths. This failure can be attributed to inadequate resources devoted to enforcement and reliance on merchant education in lieu of bona fide law enforcement...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: In 1992, Congress {{enacted the}} Synar Amendment, {{requiring}} states and territories {{to enact a}} law prohibiting the sale of tobacco to minors and to enforce that law {{in a manner that}} could reasonably be expected to decrease the availability of tobacco to minors. The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) was mandated to withhold block grant funding from noncompliant states. OBJECTIVE: To determine if DHHS and applicant states and territories are complying with the Synar <b>Amendment.</b> <b>DATA</b> SOURCES: Fiscal year 1997 substance abuse block grant applications from 59 states and territories. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Whether applicants had enacted a tobacco sales law, conducted enforcement inspections, penalized violators, and conducted a statewide survey, and whether DHHS regulations and actions were consistent with the statutory requirements of the Synar Amendment. RESULTS: Two applicants failed to enact appropriate laws, 15 failed to conduct enforcement inspections, 18 failed to provide a single example of a violator being penalized, and 1 failed to conduct a survey. Nineteen applicants failed to meet the statutory requirements, but none were sanctioned by DHHS as required by the Synar Amendment. The DHHS regulations, as implemented, do not require states to enforce their laws or to achieve illegal tobacco sales rates low enough to reduce the availability of tobacco to minors. CONCLUSIONS: The states and DHHS are violating the statutory requirements of the Synar Amendment, rendering it ineffective. Few states have implemented effective enforcement programs, and national surveys confirm that there has been no measurable reduction in the availability of tobacco to youths...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{systematically}} {{evaluate the}} performance of adaptive adjustment of the relaxation parameters of various iterative algorithms for X-ray CT reconstruction relying on sparsity priors. Sparsity prior {{has been found to}} be an efficient strategy in CT reconstruction where significantly fewer attenuation measurements are available. Sparsity prior CT reconstruction relies on iterative algorithms such as the algebraic reconstruction technique (ART) to produce a crude reconstruction based on which a sparse approximation is performed. Data driven adjustment of relaxation has been found to ensure better convergence than traditional relaxation for ART. In this paper, we study {{the performance of}} such data driven relaxation on a (CS) compressed sensing environment. State-of-the-art algorithms are implemented and their performance analyzed in regard to conventional and data-driven relaxation. Experiments are performed both on simulated and real environments. For the simulated case, experiments are conducted with and without the presence of noise. Correlation coefficients, root mean square error, structural similarity index and perceptual dissimilarity metric were used for the quantitative comparisons of the results. Experiments reveal that data driven relaxation also ensures overall better quality reconstruction in a CS environment compared to traditional relaxation. However, when the data are corrupted by noise, inconsistencies emerge in the convergence unless a threshold is imposed on the maximum <b>amendments.</b> <b>Data</b> driven relaxation seems a logical choice to more rapidly reach the solution. In a compressed sensing environment, especially when the data are corrupted by noise, a threshold to specify the maximum amendments needs to be specified. Experimentally, we have set the threshold as 20 % of the previous value and thus have ensured more consistency in the convergence. Comment: 33 pages, 14 figure...|$|R
