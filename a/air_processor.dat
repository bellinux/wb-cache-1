The present wing construction includes a reflector plate which reflects the leading edge wave upwards and eliminates the rear wave by processing the air flow in the channel between the wing and the reflector.

40|$|The fresh <b>air</b> <b>processor</b> (FAP), {{matched with}} the {{variable}} refrigerant flow {{air conditioning system}} (VRF AC), has been developed. Two control methods were adopted to control the system running and air outlet temperature, contrastively. The first method is that the running frequency in heating mode is adjusted {{in terms of the}} ordinary control method of VRF, i. e., constant condensation temperature. The experiment demonstrates the control method is not feasible. For nominal heating under different static pressure and defrosting under 200 Pa static pressure, the system fluctuates frequently. And for high temperature heating, the air outlet temperature far exceeds the target temperature. Furthermore, the control model of variable condensation temperature target has been presented, and the heat transfer correction factor is introduced into the control model. And the control parameters in the model are determined by experiment. The control model is universal for FAPs with different capacities by identifying and choosing the heat transfer correction factor in the control program. For low temperature heating, the method of switching rotation speed of the motor can be adopted to enhance air outlet temperature to 22 degrees C. The control strategy can provide guide for the design and application of FAP. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|There is {{a growing}} concern about the effects of indoor air {{particulate}} pollution, in relation to human health. The removal of indoor air pollution at its source is extremely difficult. Fine particles are continuously generated in outdoor air mainly by combustion processes. Coarse particles are constantly generated by activities indoors. There is a need for simple technology that can reduce these types of pollutants, which can work in conjunction with standard heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. A novel air cleaner was designed to harness the principles of electrostatic air cleaning, through the production of electrons. The electrostatic air cleaner (EAC system) needed to be tested to ascertain whether existing theories on the properties of electrostatics would apply. To investigate and develop the EAC system a series of experiments were conducted. The determination of the small air ion generating capacities using different voltages, the determination of the efficiency of carbon fibre thread as an electron emitter and an assessment of the concentration of hydrogen peroxide produced- through the use of new methodology and design of an enlarged interactive gas phase reactor (EIGPR) for use in a FT-IR spectrometer. To increase the understanding of the behaviour of particulate matter and other pollutants indoors, two investigations were conducted. Two nurseries in the city centre of Plymouth (UK) were monitored to assess variations in particles and 116 council owned properties in Torbay were assessed to ascertain the levels of particulates, humidity, temperature, house dust mites, damp and mould in private dwellings. To test the efficacy of the EAC system in a real life situation, the system was installed in a city centre office (Plymouth, UK) as part of a controlled trial. The results from the nurseries and council houses confirm the problems people face with indoor air pollution. The studies showed that the EAC system needed to be able to cope with large variations in particle numbers {{and to be able to}} work in varying environmental conditions. The results from the investigation into the efficacy of the EAC system showed that with a 6. 5 kV negative voltage generator, a reduction in fine and coarse particles would occur. Using carbon fibre threads as an emitter confirmed that they are the most suitable type of electron emitter. The results showed that the fibres do not deteriorate as quickly as needle type emitters and that dirt accumulation on the fibres only has a minor effect on the efficiency of the emitter. An analysis of electron chemical reactions using the EIGPR revealed that the EAC system could produce 0. 44 ppb of hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide has anti microbial properties, which would add to the improvement of air quality when the system is installed. The study of the city centre office showed that the EAC system could reduce fine particles by an extra 21 % in a room that already had an efficient <b>air</b> <b>processor</b> installed. The results from the development and application of the EAC system have led to a new design for an electrostatic air cleaner, termed a 'Full Electrostatic Air Cleaning system'. This system consists of a negative voltage generator and carbon fibre thread (the emitter) contained on a standard size ceiling tile. To aid the collection of particles, oxygen free radicals etc., the Full EAC system will be accompanied by a collector plate. This system will provide a weak electrostatic field within which indoor air will be cleaned of particulate matter. Neoventa AB, Kungalv, Sweden & AC&T Ltd., Plymouth, U...|$|E

5000|$|The Reavers' true origin is {{revealed}} {{later in the}} movie Serenity. The crew of Serenity find evidence, {{in the form of}} an Alliance scientist's holographic message, that Reavers were originally humans from the planet Miranda. The Alliance government used Miranda as a testing ground for the chemical agent G-23 Paxilon Hydrochlorate, or simply [...] "Pax" [...] (Latin for [...] "peace"). It was added to the planet's <b>air</b> <b>processors</b> in order to calm the population and weed out aggression. The agent worked, but too well: 99.9% of the population became so lethargic that they stopped working, talking and, eventually, eating and moving. They simply lay down where they were and allowed themselves to die. The remaining 0.1% of the planet's 30 million people (approximately 30,000 total) had the opposite reaction to the Pax, becoming mindlessly violent and extremely aggressive. In fact, the scientist is violently killed by one of these survivors, the original Reavers, while recording the message.|$|R

5000|$|By the mid 1990s as CPU clock speeds {{increased}} above 60 MHz, [...] "spot-cooling" [...] {{was added}} {{by means of}} a fan over the CPU heatsink to blow <b>air</b> onto the <b>processor.</b> Over time, more fans were included to provide spot-cooling in more locations where heat dissipation was needed - including the 3D graphics cards as they grew more powerful. Computer cases increasingly needed to add fans to extract heated air from the case, but unless very carefully designed, this would add more noise. Energy Star, in 1992, and similar programs led to the widespread adoption of sleep mode among consumer electronics, and the TCO Certification program promoted lower energy consumption. Both added features that allowed systems to only consume as much power as is needed at a particular moment - and helped reduce power consumption. In a similar manner the first low power and energy conserving CPUs were developed for use in laptops; but can be used in any machine to reduce power requirements - and hence noise.|$|R
