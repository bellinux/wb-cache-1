5|$|Kitayama and Karasawa {{concluded}} that Japanese people do indeed have warm feelings towards themselves, just like Americans <b>and</b> <b>Europeans,</b> but that these feelings are masked when explicitly asked for. They {{speculated that the}} reason for this masking lies in the Japanese tendency to attend to negative, undesirable features by way of improving the self.|$|E
5|$|After Mexico gained {{independence}} in 1821, Spain began to govern Manila directly. Under direct Spanish rule, banking, industry and education flourished {{more than they}} had in the previous two centuries. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 facilitated direct trade and communications with Spain. The city's growing wealth and education attracted indigenous people, Chinese, Indians, Latinos, <b>and</b> <b>Europeans</b> from the surrounding provinces and facilitated the rise of an ilustrado class that espoused liberal ideas: the ideological foundations of the Philippine Revolution, which sought independence from Spain.|$|E
5|$|Contact with Americans <b>and</b> <b>Europeans</b> in {{the early}} 19th century brought more {{settlers}} to the island, and had a lasting negative ecological effect. On lower slopes, vast tracts of koa–ōhia forest were converted to farmland. Higher up, feral animals that escaped from ranches found refuge in, and damaged extensively, Mauna Kea's native māmane–naio forest. Non-native plants are the other serious threat; there are over 4,600 introduced species on the island, whereas the number of native species is estimated at just 1,000.|$|E

40|$|Japanese {{corporations}} <b>and</b> American <b>and</b> <b>European</b> corporations take {{different approaches}} {{when it comes}} to business in China in general : (i) American corporations are concentrated in the music, motion picture, and software industries, so they have a particular interest in solving copyright infringement problems; (ii) American <b>and</b> <b>European</b> corporations have started to actively use China as a base for research and development; and (iii) many American corporations have clear China-specific technological strategies. The systems for managing intellectual property in China also differ among Japanese corporations <b>and</b> American <b>and</b> <b>European</b> corporations : (i) whether American <b>and</b> <b>European</b> corporations have an IP department depends on the individual corporations overall management policies; (ii) locally hired employees managing intellectual property in American <b>and</b> <b>European</b> corporations are usually the ones entrusted with important IP-related duties; (iii) there are many requirements for employment and the remuneration is high for locally hired employees managing intellectual property in American <b>and</b> <b>European</b> corporations; <b>and</b> (iv) relatively few Japanese corporations attribute intellectual property rights to their subsidiaries in China. Various aspects also differentiate Japanese corporations <b>and</b> American <b>and</b> <b>European</b> corporations in terms of the measures they take to combat counterfeit products : (i) American <b>and</b> <b>European</b> corporations show a similar trend as Japanese corporations toward taking administrative enforcement measures or civil proceedings, but a trend toward using criminal proceedings is emerging among American <b>and</b> <b>European</b> corporations; (ii) in American <b>and</b> <b>European</b> corporations, internal employees often prepare warning letters, conduct research, and collect evidence; (iii) the budget of American <b>and</b> <b>European</b> corporations for measures to combat counterfeit products is far greater than that of Japanese corporations; (iv) American <b>and</b> <b>European</b> corporations are active in exchanging information with and collecting information from governments; and (v) American corporations emphasize using estimated amounts of damages and quantifying the effectiveness of their measures to combat counterfeit products. Two key points stand out as being essential when considering measures to combat leakages of technology and infringements of trade secrets : (A) that good personnel management is effective as a measure for combating the leakage of technology and the infringement of trade secrets; and (B) that good information management is essential for preventing technology leakages and trade secret infringements. Many differences are evident between Japanese corporations <b>and</b> American <b>and</b> <b>European</b> corporations with respect to these measures : (i) American <b>and</b> <b>European</b> corporations are more active than Japanese corporations in willfully transferring technology to China; (ii) Japanese corporations are considerably less popular in China than American <b>and</b> <b>European</b> corporations; (iii) American <b>and</b> <b>European</b> corporations are more progressive in terms of assigning managerial powers to Chinese management personnel; (iv) the level of compensation offered at Japanese corporations in China is considerably lower than that offered at American <b>and</b> <b>European</b> corporations in China; (v) American <b>and</b> <b>European</b> corporations in China engage in corporate PR in many different ways, but Japanese corporations in China do not do enough; (vi) American <b>and</b> <b>European</b> corporations employ various initiatives to increase the motivation of Chinese personnel; and (vii) Regulations at American <b>and</b> <b>European</b> corporations provide severe punishment for personnel who divulge secrets. Japanese corporations <b>and</b> American <b>and</b> <b>European</b> corporations take different approaches {{when it comes to}} strategies for intellectual property and preventing technology leakage in China. But it is important that Japan adopts the good aspects of the methods used by American <b>and</b> <b>European</b> corporations {{at the same time as}} it continues to collaborate and cooperate with international institutions, governments, and anti-counterfeiting organizations. ...|$|R

Use of the quarry declined between this period and contact with Americans <b>and</b> <b>Europeans.</b> As part of the ritual associated with quarrying, the workers erected shrines to their gods; these and other quarry artifacts remain at the sites, most of which lie within what is now the Mauna Kea Ice Age Reserve.|$|E

Although there was periodic regional conflict fuelled in part by ethnic divisions in the past, by 2008 it had diminished considerably and the concept of a Malawian nationality had re-emerged.|$|E
5|$|Musical {{instruments}} developed independently in many populated {{regions of}} the world. However, contact among civilizations caused rapid spread and adaptation of most instruments in places far from their origin. By the Middle Ages, instruments from Mesopotamia were in maritime Southeast Asia, <b>and</b> <b>Europeans</b> played instruments from North Africa. Development in the Americas occurred at a slower pace, but cultures of North, Central, and South America shared musical instruments. By 1400, musical instrument development slowed in many areas and was dominated by the Occident.|$|E

5|$|The {{first people}} to rush to the goldfields, {{beginning}} {{in the spring of}} 1848, were the residents of California themselves—primarily agriculturally oriented Americans <b>and</b> <b>Europeans</b> living in Northern California, along with Native Americans and some Californios (Spanish-speaking Californians). These first miners tended to be families in which everyone helped in the effort. Women and children of all ethnicities were often found panning next to the men. Some enterprising families set up boarding houses to accommodate the influx of men; in such cases, the women often brought in steady income while their husbands searched for gold.|$|E
5|$|Traditional pastimes {{and forms}} of {{recreation}} in rural areas were cock-fighting, bull-fighting, village fairs and plays. Men in urban areas indulged in social and communistic activities at recreational clubs, music concerts or sabhas, dramas and welfare organisations. Carnatic music and bharatanatyam were especially patronised by the upper and upper-middle class Madras society. Of the sports introduced by the British in the presidency, cricket, tennis, football and hockey were the most popular. An annual cricket tournament, known as the Madras Presidency Matches, was held between Indians <b>and</b> <b>Europeans</b> during Pongal.|$|E
5|$|During his voyage, Cook also visited New Zealand, first {{discovered}} by Dutch explorer Abel Tasman in 1642, and claimed the North and South islands for the British crown in 1769 and 1770 respectively. Initially, {{interaction between the}} indigenous Māori population <b>and</b> <b>Europeans</b> {{was limited to the}} trading of goods. European settlement increased through {{the early decades of the}} 19th century, with numerous trading stations established, especially in the North. In 1839, the New Zealand Company announced plans to buy large tracts of land and establish colonies in New Zealand. On 6 February 1840, Captain William Hobson and around 40 Maori chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi. This treaty is considered by many to be New Zealand's founding document, but differing interpretations of the Maori and English versions of the text have meant that it continues to be a source of dispute.|$|E

5|$|In an {{interview}} held in June 2009, Rob Pardo indicated that LAN support {{would not be}} included in StarCraft II. Removing LAN requires players to connect through Blizzard's servers before being able to play multiplayer games, causing gamers to voice their dissatisfaction online. Further controversy was sparked when Blizzard confirmed that the game would not support cross-server play out of the box, restricting gamers to only play against local opponents—for instance, US gamers against those in the US <b>and</b> <b>Europeans</b> against Europeans. The company originally explained that Australia and New Zealand servers would be located in Southeast Asia, pitting them against combatants from Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand. However, starting from patch 1.1.0, {{it was announced that}} the Southeast Asia/Australia/New Zealand version of the game would not be strictly region-locked, with gamers able to play on both the SEA/ANZ servers and the North American ones.|$|E

5|$|The see of Philadelphia {{had been}} vacant {{since the death}} of Bishop Michael Francis Egan in 1814, despite several efforts to fill it. Archbishop John Carroll of Baltimore, whose {{province}} included Philadelphia, had considered no fewer than fifteen priests for the position; some had been ruled out for one reason or another, and others (including the apostolic administrator, Louis de Barth) had turned the job down. Part of the delay was logistical—Carroll was unsure of the exact procedure for selecting a candidate in the recently erected province—but part was due to the perceived undesirability of the post, which oversaw only a few small churches {{in a part of the}} nation with few Catholics. There was also a significant dispute (known as trusteeism) over the rights of churches' lay trustees that was likely to complicate the job of running the diocese. In Europe, the Church owned property and directly controlled its parishes through the clergy. In the United States, however, early Catholic churches were typically founded by laymen who purchased the property, and erected the church buildings. Those laypeople accordingly demanded some control over the administration of the parish, even after the arrival of clergy from Europe who held the traditional view of parish organization. In a larger sense, the dispute represented a difference in understandings of authority between Americans <b>and</b> <b>Europeans.</b>|$|E
