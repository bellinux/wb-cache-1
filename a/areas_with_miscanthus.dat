40|$|Biomass {{energy crops}} are {{prompting}} major land-use changes in agricultural and marginal land {{in an effort}} to reduce dependency on fossil fuels. Miscanthus × giganteus, a perennial giant grass, {{is one of the main}} such crops in Europe but few studies exist of its interaction with farmland wildlife, particularly mammals. Understanding ecological impacts of bioenergy planting schemes is vital for mitigating potential negative effects on already declining farmland biodiversity and for maximising any benefits from these low-management, structurally diverse crops. We assessed in a mixed farming area in the UK the impact of Miscanthus crops on the brown hare (Lepus europaeus), a widespread but declining farmland species of conservation concern. We intensively radio-tracked hares in Miscanthus blocks of contrasting size and analysed hare diet for evidence of the consumption of Miscanthus. Home ranges differed starkly averaging 10. 5 versus 49. 6  ha in the small and the large Miscanthus blocks, respectively. Despite entirely avoiding the crop as food, hares appeared able to exist and even thrive in <b>areas</b> planted <b>with</b> <b>Miscanthus</b> though their populations may be significantly limited by reduced food availability and increased energy use where dense Miscanthus is planted over a wide area. As a component of a mixed farming landscape, Miscanthus may provide biodiversity benefits by increasing spatial heterogeneity and refuge areas for declining farmland species like brown hares but any effect is likely to be strongly scale-dependant...|$|R
40|$|In Ireland, Miscanthus Ã� giganteus has the {{potential}} to become a major feedstock for bioenergy production. However, under current climatic conditions, Ireland is situated on the margin of the geographical range where Miscanthus production is economically feasible. It is therefore important to optimize the yield and other ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration delivered by the crop. A survey of commercial Miscanthus fields showed a large number of <b>areas</b> <b>with</b> no <b>Miscanthus</b> crop cover. These patches can potentially lead to reduced crop yields and soil carbon sequestration and have a significant negative impact on the economic viability of the crop. The aim of this research is to assess patchiness on a field scale and to analyse the impacts on crop yield and soil carbon sequestration. Analysis of aerial photography images was carried out on six commercial Miscanthus plantations in south east Ireland. The analysis showed an average of 372. 5 patches per hectare, covering an average of 13. 7 % of the field area. Using net present value models and a financial balance approach it was shown that patchiness has a significant impact on payback time for initial investments and might reduce gross margins by more than 50 %. Total and Miscanthus-derived soil organic carbon was measured in open patches and adjacent plots of high crop density showing significantly lower Miscanthus-derived carbon stocks in open patches compared to high crop-density patches (0. 47 Mg C haâ�� 1 Â± 0. 42 SD and 0. 91 Mg C haâ�� 1 Â± 0. 55 SD). Using geographic information system (GIS) it was shown that on a field scale Miscanthus-derived carbon stocks were reduced by 7. 38 % Â± 7. 25 SD. However, total soil organic carbon stocks were not significantly different between open patches and high crop density plots indicating no impact on the overall carbon sequestration on a field scale over 3 â�� 4 years since establishment for these Miscanthus sites...|$|R

40|$|Sustainability of {{is one of}} {{the biggest}} {{concerns}} for bioenergy crops, such as Miscanthus. Nitrogen is the most expensive and most limiting nutrient in agricultural systems, so it is necessary to develop strategies to reduce anthropogenic inputs of nitrogen fertilizer. Diazotrophs associated with non-leguminous grasses have great potential to contribute biologically fixed nitrogen as a sustainable N source for bioenergy grasses. There are previous few studies investigating diazotroph community composition associated <b>with</b> <b>Miscanthus.</b> The following thesis investigated two important aspects of Miscanthus-associated N-fixing bacteria with both culture-based methods and molecular approaches: i. confirming the presence diazotrophs associated <b>with</b> <b>Miscanthus</b> and evaluating their potential to provide nitrogen to the plant; ii. examining how environmental factors may influence the diazotroph communities. In order to address the objectives, both rhizomes and rhizosphere samples were collected from native Miscanthus in Taiwan and agricultural samples from Illinois. Thirty-two diazotroph strains were isolated from native Miscanthus rhizomes, and most of them were Gamma-proteobacteria. The taxonomic classification of the strains was similar to diazotroph strains previously isolated from agricultural Miscanthus. In addition, the nitrogen fixation potential was confirmed for these strains through detection of nitrogenase genes and assays to detect nitrogenase activity. Molecular approaches were introduced to investigate if the biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) process could be carried out by diverse bacterial groups besides the isolated taxa. Diazotrophs from 57 genera were found in native Miscanthus rhizomes, while diazotrophs from 73 genera were found in the rhizosphere. Molecular approaches also enable us to compare diazotrophs from different conditions. I first compared the endorhizosphere diazotrophs of native and agricultural Miscanthus, and the results indicated that the native Miscanthus rhizomes harbored more diverse diazotroph communities. I then investigated both total bacterial communities and diazotroph communities from the rhizosphere and endorhizosphere of native <b>Miscanthus</b> <b>with</b> deep-sequencing methods. The result showed that total bacteria communities showed strong response to plant niches, while diazotroph bacteria did not. For both total bacterial and diazotroph communities, the Miscanthus rhizosphere soil harbored communities with higher richness and biodiversity than Miscanthus rhizome tissues. Other factors, such as geographic distribution and soil edaphic factors also influenced the diversity and community structure of both total bacterial and diazotroph communities. Understanding community composition of diazotrophs associated <b>with</b> <b>Miscanthus</b> and the environmental factors that govern the diazotroph community may facilitate the agricultural management to effectively utilize beneficial microbes for sustainable crop production...|$|R
40|$|The {{environmental}} impact of bioenergy supply systems can be determined using life cycle assessment methodologies. This study focuses {{on the impact of}} production of Miscanthus pellets and briquettes, potentially used to satisfy renewable energy requirements in Ireland. The impact categories considered are particularly important when assessing bioenergy systems; global warming potential, acidification potential, eutrophication potential, and energy demand. The scope of the study incorporates Miscanthus cultivation, harvest, processing and transport to a biomass distributor. The aim of the research is to evaluate the effects of changes in keys variables on the overall {{environmental impact}}s of the system. The scenarios examined include replacement of synthetic fertilisers <b>with</b> biosolids, <b>Miscanthus</b> processing by pelleting and briquetting, and transport distances of 50 and 100 km. Results indicate that maintenance and processing of the Miscanthus crop have the most environmental impacts with transport having less of an effect. Replacing synthetic fertiliser with biosolids results in a reduction in global warming potential of 23 – 33 % and energy demand of 12 – 18 %, but raises both acidification and eutrophication potential by 290 – 400 % and 258 – 300 %, respectively. Pelleting of Miscanthus requires more energy than briquetting, hence has higher impacts in each category assessed. Increasing the transport distance from 50 to 100 km, results in a small increase in each impact category. Miscanthus briquette production compares favourably with wood pellet, kerosene, and coal production, <b>with</b> <b>Miscanthus</b> pelleting proving more environmentally damaging...|$|R
40|$|The high {{ash content}} and varying ash {{composition}} in algal biomass is often mentioned as problematic if {{to be used}} for thermal energy conversion. This paper suggests an approach where detailed information on ash composition and predicted ash formation reactions are basis for successful remedies enabling the use of fuels considered to be difficult. The procedure is demonstrated on seaweed (Saccharina latissima) cultivated for biorefinery purposes. The ash composition of the seaweed was found suitable for co-combustion <b>with</b> <b>Miscanthus</b> x giganteus, an energy crop high in alkali and silicon. Fuel mixtures were combusted in a bubbling fluidized bed reactor and ash samples were analyzed by SEM-EDS and XRD. The results showed that Ca from the seaweed was very reactive and thus efficient in solving the silicate melting problems.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to evaluate the feasibility and locations of using cellulosic biomass both from crop residues and from dedicated energy crops to supply 200 -million-liter-biodiesel plants in France. The estimation of the potential amount of agricultural residue available in 2015 in each region of France is calculated. The residues considered in this study come from cereal straw and corn stover. The economic viability of potential new energy crops, miscanthus and triticale, grown only for biomass purposes is estimated in order to determine if they could be competitively produced by the year 2015. The supply curves for both miscanthus and triticale are calculated. Results show that eight out of the twenty one French regions have enough agricultural residues available to supply at least one 200 million liter, biofuel plant. Region Centre has the largest potential, with enough residues to supply three to five plants. Model results show that miscanthus is more economically feasible than triticale. Finally, cost of supplying one biodiesel plant of 200 million liters in the region Centre is estimated. Results show that collection of biomass will be effective in an <b>area</b> <b>with</b> a radius of 58 Km to 168 Km depending of the raw material considered and its abundance. The cost of supplying a plant <b>with</b> <b>miscanthus</b> is much higher than with residues only (0. 61 [Euro]/L compared to 0. 35 [Euro]/L). Thus, crop residues appear to offer a lower cost to produce biodiesel in the near term compared to dedicated crops. ^ Results show that production of biofuel from cellulosic biomass should not be limited by the supply of raw material, but costs clearly will {{play a key role in}} the development of a cellulosic biomass plant.

40|$|At a {{time when}} the cement {{industry}} is largely responsible for the production of CO 2 in the construction sector, it is useful to make this production a reverse phenomenon: that is CO 2 capture.

Current environmental concerns motivate the study of carbonation in order to maximize the absorption of carbon dioxide. Moreover, lightweight concrete with biobased products knows an interesting development in the construction field, especially as thermal insulation panels for walls in buildings. Before identifying and quantifying the basic physical characteristics of concrete made from miscanthus, it is necessary to optimize the composition of the product. The long-term stability as well as the reinforcement may be obtained by means of a mineralization process of the natural product: a preparation with a lime and/or cement-based material is necessary to reinforce the cohesion of the bio-based product.

In this study, the contributions of geographical distance, environmental heterogeneity and time in shaping AMF communities associated <b>with</b> <b>Miscanthus</b> giganteus (a perennial grass originating from south-east Asia) were determined over a 13 months period. In particular, the community was partitioned into core (abundant and persistent taxa) and satellite (taxa with low abundance and persistence) constituents and the drivers of community assembly for each determined. β-diversity was exceptionally low across the 140 m line transects, and there was limited evidence of geographical scaling effects on the composition of the core, satellite or combined communities. However, AMF richness and community composition changed over time associated with fluctuation within both the core and satellite communities. The degree to which AMF community variation was explained by soil properties was consistently higher in the core community than the combined and satellite communities, suggesting that the satellite community had considerable stochasticity associated with it. We suggest that the partitioning of communities into their core and satellite constituents could be employed to enhance the variation explained within microbial community analyses...|$|R

The biomass gasification technology, which was selected for integration with the SOFC stacks, was the air-blown downdraught gasifier, because of its simplicity and relative cheapness. Willow and miscanthus were taken as the biomass fuels for the power plants. In addition, the sensitivity of the COE to variations in the fuel cost, the fuel cell cost, the fuel cell lifetime, and the waste heat selling price were examined and compared.

40|$|The {{production}} of bioenergy from grasses {{has been developing}} quickly during the last decade, <b>with</b> <b>Miscanthus</b> being {{among the most important}} choices for {{production of}} bioethanol. However, one of the key barriers to producing bioethanol is the lack of information about cell wall structure. Cell walls are thought to display compositional differences that lead to emergence of a very high level of complexity, resulting in great diversity in cell wall architectures. In this work, a set of different techniques was used to access the complexity of cell walls of different genotypes of Miscanthus sinensis in order to understand how they interfere with saccharification efficiency. Three genotypes of M. sinensis displaying different patterns of correlation between lignin content and saccharification efficiency were subjected to cell wall analysis by quantitative/qualitative analytical techniques such as monosaccharide composition, oligosaccharide profiling, and glycome profiling. When saccharification efficiency was correlated negatively with lignin, the structural features of arabinoxylan and xyloglucan were found to contribute positively to hydrolysis. In the absence of such correlation, different types of pectins, and some mannans contributed to saccharification efficiency. Different genotypes of M. sinensis were shown to display distinct interactions among their cell wall components, which seem to influence cell wall hydrolysis. </p...|$|R

This article {{provides an overview of}} the most important results and experience gained <b>with</b> <b>miscanthus</b> in Europe over the past 10 years. Field trials have been established throughout Europe from the Mediterranean to southern Scandinavia. Most reported trials have used a vigorous sterile clone Miscanthus x giganteus, which has been propagated vegetatively either by rhizome cutting or in vitro culture. Yields in autumn have been reported in excess of 30 t ha− 1 (12 t acre− 1) for irrigated trials in southern Europe. Without irrigation autumn yields of 10 { 25 t ha− 1 (dry matter) can be expected. The quality of miscanthus biomass for combustion is in some respect comparable to woody biomass and normally improves by delaying harvesting until the spring, although harvestable yields are thus reduced by 30 { 50 % compared with autumn yields. Dierent technical options for establishment, harvesting and handling of miscanthus have been developed and these signicantly eect production costs. Miscanthus production is characterized by low fertilizer and pesticide requirements making it a relatively benign crop environmentally. The main limitations to miscanthus production from M. x giganteus are the high establishment costs, poor over-wintering at some sites and insucient water supply in southern regions of Europe.

40|$|Miscanthus is an {{emerging}} crop with high potential for bioenergy production. Its effective sustainability depends greatly on the spatial location of this crop, although few modelling approaches {{have been based}} on real maps. To fill this gap, we propose a spatially explicit method based on real location data.

Then, we used a boosted regression tree, machine learning method, to model miscanthus presence/absence {{at the level of the}} farmer's block as mapped in the French land parcel identification system. Each of these modelling spatial units was characterised on agronomical, morphological and contextual variables selected from in-depth spatially explicit farm surveys. The model fostered a two-fold aim: to assess the farmers' decision criteria and predict miscanthus location probability. In addition, we evaluated the consequence of possible legislative constraints, which could prevent the miscanthus to be planted in protected areas or in place of grasslands. The small and complex-shaped farmer's blocks that were predicted by our model to be planted <b>with</b> <b>miscanthus</b> were also characterised by their great distance from the farm and the roads.

The mechanical properties of biomass-reinforced composites are controlled by {{the efficiency of the}} stress transmission from the polymer matrix to the fragments. It depends on the biomass/matrix adhesion, fragments dispersion and distribution in the matrix, the type and composition of the biomass and their morphology (length L, diameter D, aspect ratio L/D).

In the combined extrusion-soaking treatment, most compositions removal occurred within 1 ~ 2 hours and on a basis of 1 hour soaking treatment values, cellulose was recovered about 85 % and other compositions, including hemicellulose, are removed about 50 % from extruded miscanthus sample. The combined extrusion-soaking treated and soaking only treated samples were subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis using cellulase and β-glucosidase. The enzymatic digestibility value of combined extrusion- 2 hours soaking treated sample was comparable to 12 hours soaking only treated sample. It means that extrusion treatment can shorten the conventional long reaction time of aqueous ammonia soaking. The findings suggest that the combination of extrusion and soaking is a promising pretreatment method to solve both problems for no lignin removal of extrusion and long reaction time of aqueous ammonia soaking...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} issue {{related to the}} cultivation of plants for energy purposes and poorly recognized so far is {{their impact on the}} environment, including biodiversity. The aim of the work was to assess weed flora diversity, canopy structure and yield of miscanthus cultivated on two types of soil: light and heavy. 			 			The study was carried out in the Experimental Station of the Institute of Soil Science and Plant Cultivation – State Research Institute at Osiny, Poland (N: 51 o 28, E: 22 o 4), on two fields of miscanthus (Miscanthus saccharflorus Robustus × M. sinensis– M- 115) established in 2004, on light loamy sand and heavy loam. The analysis of weed flora was carried out in 2010 and 2011, in mid-June and mid-August, using two methods: the frame method and phytosociological relevés. Moreover, an analysis of green and dry matter yield of miscanthus, some biometric features and leaf area index (LAI) was carried out. 			 			The results showed that weed species diversity in a miscanthus crop was dependent on soil type. A larger number of weed species was found in miscanthus cultivated on heavy soil – 37 – in comparison <b>with</b> <b>miscanthus</b> cultivated on light soil – 33. Sorensen’s indicators showed low similarity between weed communities in miscanthus on light and heavy soil. Weed abundance and percentage of weed cover were lower in miscanthus cultivated on light soil. Weed density decreased during the vegetation season as a result of increasing competitiveness of the miscanthus canopy against weeds. Miscanthus yields were more dependent on weather conditions than the type of soil. Plant height and shoot diameter as well as leaf area index (LAI) were higher in miscanthus grown on heavy soil...|$|R
40|$|Dedicated biomass {{crops are}} {{required}} for future bioenergy production. However, the effects of large-scale land use change (LUC) from traditional annual crops, such as corn–soybean rotations to the perennial grasses (PGs) switchgrass and miscanthus, on soil microbial community functioning is largely unknown. Specifically, ecologically significant denitrifying communities, which regulate N 2 O production and consumption in soils, may respond differently to LUC {{due to differences in}} carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) inputs between crop types and management systems. Our objective was to quantify bacterial denitrifying gene abundances as influenced by corn–soybean crop production compared to PG biomass production. A field trial was established in  2008 at the Elora Research Station in Ontario, Canada (n   =[*]  30), <b>with</b> <b>miscanthus</b> and switchgrass grown alongside corn–soybean rotations at different N rates (0  and 160  kg N ha − 1) and biomass harvest dates within PG plots. Soil was collected on four dates from 2011 to 2012 and quantitative PCR was used to enumerate the total bacterial community (16 S rRNA) and communities of bacterial denitrifiers by targeting nitrite reductase (nirS) and N 2 O reductase (nosZ) genes. Miscanthus produced significantly larger yields and supported larger nosZ denitrifying communities than corn–soybean rotations regardless of management, indicating large-scale LUC from corn–soybean to miscanthus may be suitable in variable Ontario climatic conditions and under varied management, while potentially mitigating soil N 2 O emissions. Harvesting switchgrass in the spring decreased yields in N-fertilized plots, but did not affect gene abundances. Standing miscanthus overwinter resulted in higher 16 S rRNA and nirS gene copies than in fall-harvested crops. However, the size of the total (16 S rRNA) and denitrifying bacterial communities changed differently over time and in response to LUC, indicating varying controls on these communities...|$|R
40|$|The {{rhizosphere}} has a rich fungal microbiome, including parasites, commensals and mutualists. An important {{group in}} the rhizosphere {{are assumed to be}} the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), which live in symbiosis with around 80 % of plant species. AMF have been shown to increase plant yield, biomass, disease resistance, and shoot P. Plants exchange carbon in the form of sugars for nutrients assimilated by AMF. There is little known about AMF in association <b>with</b> <b>Miscanthus</b> giganteus, a productive bioenergy crop grown in the UK and abroad. Work was carried out to characterise the abundance, organisation, importance, function and stability over space and time of rhizosphere fungi and AMF in M. giganteus roots. Field samples from Lincolnshire were analysed using staining and molecular techniques, including small subunit rRNA gene terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism, clone libraries and amplicon pyrosequencing, and meta-transcriptomics. M. giganteus was also grown in a number of pot experiments, with various treatments including fungal inoculations and fungicide application. A number of fungal phyla were found in the roots, particularly Ascomycota, the composition of which shifted over time and exhibited diurnal patterns of activity. Fungi enhanced plant growth by a third, and were functionally active in the roots in the meta-transcriptome. AMF communities were found at much lower relative abundances in roots, and inoculation with AMF did not enhance M. giganteus growth. The work highlights the importance of the whole root mycobiome to plant growth and health, and the relatively small role Glomeromycota play in M. giganteus comparison with other fungi. The work also demonstrated the dynamic nature of fungal activity over hours, months, and years, and the complex interactions the fungal community has with environmental variables...|$|R
