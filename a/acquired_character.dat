As regards mutilations, it is generally admitted that they are not hereditary, and there is ample evidence on this point. When it was the fashion to dock horses' tails, it was not found that horses were born with short tails; nor are Chinese women born with distorted feet; nor are any of the numerous forms of racial mutilation in man, which have in some cases been carried on for hundreds of generations, inherited. Nevertheless, a few cases of apparent inheritance of mutilations have been recorded,[215] and these, if trustworthy, are difficulties {{in the way of the}} theory. The undoubted inheritance of disease is hardly a difficulty, because the predisposition to disease is a congenital, not an <b>acquired</b> <b>character,</b> and as such would be the subject of inheritance. The often-quoted case of a disease induced by mutilation being inherited (Brown-Sequard's epileptic guinea-pigs) has been discussed by Professor Weismann, and shown to be not conclusive. The mutilation itself--a section of certain nerves--was never inherited, but the resulting epilepsy, or a general state of weakness, deformity, or sores, was sometimes inherited. It is, however, possible that the mere injury introduced and encouraged the growth of certain microbes, which, spreading through the organism, sometimes reached the germ-cells, and thus transmitted a diseased condition to the offspring. Such a transference of microbes is believed to occur in syphilis and tuberculosis, and has been ascertained to occur in the case of the muscardine silkworm disease.[216] ...|$|E

The temperance movements of the 19th century and the recent experiment with Prohibition focused on the individual, promoted by [...] "degenerationism, the theory that biological factors, toxic environmental influences or moral vices may trigger a cascade of social, moral and medical problems". This theory was a holdover from the pre-Darwinian belief that offspring inherited <b>acquired</b> <b>character</b> traits from their parents. The increase in scientific knowledge in the early 20th century led to questions about this view of alcoholics, but the view still dominated for the first 30 years of the century.

40|$|Three {{experiments}} investigated age of acquisition (AoA) {{effects on}} early orthographic processing during Chinese character recognition. In Experiment 1, we measured {{the accuracy of}} identification of brief masked characters, accuracy was higher for early compared to late <b>acquired</b> <b>characters.</b> In Experiment 2, the visual duration threshold (VDT) was measured for both early and late <b>acquired</b> Chinese <b>characters.</b> The results showed that early <b>acquired</b> <b>characters</b> were successfully identified at shorter display durations than late <b>acquired</b> <b>characters.</b> Significant AoA effects were also found in Experiment 3, using a lexical decision task requiring mainly orthographic processing (discriminating real Chinese characters from orthographically illegal and unpronounceable characters). In summary, three experiments provide converging empirical evidence, for AoA effects on the early orthographic processing stages of Chinese character recognition. These results suggest that AoA effects during word identification go beyond the phonological or semantic processing stages. These results aslo provide cross-linguistic evidence for an AoA effect on early perceptual processing during identification. © 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 19th century Brown-Séquard {{gave rise to}} much {{controversy}} {{in the case of}} supposed modification-inheritance by his experiments on guinea pigs. In a series of experiments extending over many years (1869 to 1891), he showed that a partial section of the spinal cord, or a section of the sciatic nerve, was followed after a few weeks by a peculiar morbid state resembling epilepsy. The offspring of the animals operated on were frequently decrepit, and a certain number showed a tendency to the so-called epilepsy. Although some scientists considered the experiments as evidence for Lamarckian inheritance, the experiments were not Lamarckian as Lamarck had rejected that this sort of acquired characteristic was inherited as such experiments did not involve the use and disuse of characters in response to the environment. One explanation for the results was that they show a transmitted disease and not evidence for the inheritance of an <b>acquired</b> <b>character.</b> His experiments are now considered anomalous and alternative explanations have been suggested.|$|E
50|$|Whilst {{evidence}} of the transmission of an <b>acquired</b> <b>character</b> proved wanting, the a priori arguments in its favour were recognized as flawed, and cases that appeared to favour the Lamarckian assumption {{were found to be}} better explained by the Darwinian principle. For example, the occurrence of blind animals in caves and in the deep sea was a fact that even Darwin regarded as best explained by the atrophy of the eye in successive generations through the absence of light and consequent disuse. However, it was suggested that this is better explained by natural selection acting on congenital fortuitous variations. Some animals are born with distorted or defective eyes. If a number of some species of fish are swept into a cavern, those with perfect eyes would follow the light and eventually escape, leaving behind those with imperfect eyes to breed in the dark place. In every succeeding generation this would be the case, and even those with weak but still seeing eyes would escape, until only a pure race of blind animals would be left in the cavern.|$|E
50|$|For {{adaptive}} {{learning to be}} inherited, one would anticipate that changes in the genome, whether genetic or epigenetic, would be necessary implying a reversal of information flow from phenotype to genotype. In response to dynamic environmental fluctuations, an organism’s PINs constantly process information and organize and reorganize themselves. However, it is postulated that in response to ‘unanticipated’ environmental changes, several IDPs are overexpressed and the organism explores numerous iterations of network connections {{many of which are}} due to the promiscuous nature of these interactions. This results in a specific output that the organism benefits from, and in resetting the network to a new set-point (threshold). Further, it is postulated that information derived from PIN rewiring can operate across diverse timescales. Thus, while some of the information particularly that which operates over relatively short timescales maybe retained within the PINS, information that operates over long periods such as cellular transformation, development and evolution, is directly transferred to the genome to effect heritable genetic/epigenetic changes, or via a mechanism similar to genetic assimilation of the <b>acquired</b> <b>character</b> proposed by Waddington. Interestingly, several proteins that are involved in epigenetically sculpturing the chromatin are IDPs.|$|E
50|$|Lamarck {{was neither}} the first nor the most {{distinguished}} biologist {{to believe in the}} inheritance of <b>acquired</b> <b>characters.</b> He merely endorsed a belief which had been generally accepted for at least 2,200 years before his time and used it to explain how evolution could have taken place. The inheritance of <b>acquired</b> <b>characters</b> had been accepted previously by Hippocrates, Aristotle, Galen (?), Roger Bacon, Jerome Cardan, Levinus Lemnius, John Ray, Michael Adanson, Jo. Fried. Blumenbach and Erasmus Darwin among others.|$|R
5000|$|What Lamarck {{really did}} was to accept the {{hypothesis}} that <b>acquired</b> <b>characters</b> were heritable, a notion which had been held almost universally for well over two thousand years and which his contemporaries accepted {{as a matter of}} course, and to assume that the results of such inheritance were cumulative from generation to generation, thus producing, in time, new species. His individual contribution to biological theory consisted in his application to the problem of the origin of species of the view that <b>acquired</b> <b>characters</b> were inherited and in showing that evolution could be inferred logically from the accepted biological hypotheses. He would doubtless have been greatly astonished to learn that a belief in the inheritance of <b>acquired</b> <b>characters</b> is now labeled [...] "Lamarckian," [...] although he would almost certainly have felt flattered if evolution itself had been so designated.|$|R
