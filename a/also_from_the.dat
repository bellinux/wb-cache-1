5|$|Bayern also {{enjoys a}} strong rivalry with the 1.

5|$|During this period, {{the club}} {{may have been}} more focused on {{building}} the Palladium, for which construction began in July 1994. In the lockout-shortened 1994–95 season, Yashin and Daigle led the club in points again, although their point totals declined. The 1994–95 Senators team record declined <b>also</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> previous season, finishing with nine wins and 23 points (this was over only 48 games), to finish last in the League again.|$|E
5|$|Evidence for grapheme-color synesthesia comes <b>also</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{finding that}} colors can be {{flexibly}} associated to graphemes, as new meanings become assigned to those graphemes.

The Glagolitic graphemes inherited {{the colors of the}} corresponding Latin graphemes as soon as the Glagolitic graphemes acquired the new meaning.|$|E
5|$|In 1985 Derek Briggs and Whittington {{published}} {{a description of}} Anomalocaris, <b>also</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Burgess Shale. Swedish palaeontologist Jan Bergström suggested that the two animals were related, as they shared lateral flaps with gills, stalked eyes and other features; and he classified them as primitive arthropods, although he considered that arthropods are not a single phylum.|$|E

5|$|A coronet {{of eleven}} pearls denotes a baron's arms in Sweden (the ancient nobility does {{also have the}} right to have the baronet crown by tradition), which also {{typically}} includes two barred helmets, each wearing this coronet, and a third such coronet is placed above the shield, although some baronial arms feature three helmets or only one, and not every baron uses supporters. A Swedish Greve (Count) bears three barred helmets, each crowned with a coronet showing five leaves, and supporters are usually—though not always—present. The arms of Swedish counts <b>also,</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> late 17th century, began using manteaux (see the Greater Coat of Arms of Sweden, pictured above) in place of the traditional mantling, although this practice has since been deprecated. Untitled nobility (others granted noble status by letters patent) also bore a barred helm and a coronet showing two pearls between three leaves.|$|E
5|$|A limited fauna {{is known}} from the upper section of the Oldman Formation, and Corythosaurus casuarius as well as C. intermedius are among the taxa. <b>Also</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> section of the {{formation}} are the theropods Daspletosaurus, and Saurornitholestes, the hadrosaurids Brachylophosaurus, Gryposaurus and Parasaurolophus, and the ankylosaurid Scolosaurus, and the ceratopsians Coronosaurus and Chasmosaurus. Other genera are known, but do not persist from the upper section of the formation, and therefore are not contemporaries of Corythosaurus.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 19th century, {{scientific}} investigation began to indicate that the Glamorgan valleys were rich with coal deposits. Bute, who already owned coal mines in County Durham, commissioned further surveys in 1817 and 1823–24 which showed that there were potentially huge profits to be made from the reserves, both from the coal sitting beneath Bute's own lands, but <b>also</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> coal under common lands in the region that Bute could claim through his feudal titles. Bute set about consolidating his rights and existing investments during the late 1820s and 1830s, acquiring extensive rights to the coalfields in the process. Bute established and managed a few colleries – such as that at Rhigos – directly, but given the investment costs and attention they took up, generally preferred to lease out his coal fields and claim a royalty on the coal mined instead. The lessees might be iron-masters, who used the coal in their own operations, or colliery owners who sold the coal on to industrial or domestic customers. The profits increased from £872 {{in the second half of}} 1826, to £10,756 in 1848–49.|$|E

5|$|But reform {{brought with}} it new ways of {{thinking}} about the church and its personnel, derived not only from contemporary continental movements but <b>also</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> rich pastoral and canonical literature of the Carolingian renaissance. This disseminated ideas concerning the separation of the lay and religious spheres, the distinction between monks and clergy, and enhanced the authority of bishops as both pastoral and political leaders. Ultimately, these ideas were to strike at deeply entrenched features of the early medieval church, such as hereditary control of churches and the right of the clergy to marry.|$|E
5|$|Dinheirosaurus {{was one of}} many dinosaurs to {{have lived}} in the Lourinhã Formation during the Late Jurassic. Many theropods, sauropods, and {{especially}} ornithischians are <b>also</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Lourinhã Formation, which contains a similar fauna to the North American Morrison Formation. Many theropods are known including an unnamed genus of abelisaurid; the allosaurid Allosaurus europaeus; the ceratosaurid Ceratosaurus dentisculatus; the coelurosaurians Aviatyrannis jurassica, and cf. Richardoestesia; an intermediate theropod; and the megalosaurid Torvosaurus gurneyi. Sauropods are less common, with only an intermediate diplodocid as well as Dinheirosaurus; the camarasaurid Lourinhasaurus alenquerensis; the turiasaur Zby atlanticus; and the brachiosaurid Lusotitan known. Ornithischians are well represented, with identified remains persisting to Trimucrodon cuneatus; Alocodon kuehnei; the stegosaurians Dacentrurus armatus, Miragaia longicollum, and Stegosaurus ungulatus; the ankylosaurid Dracopelta zbyszewskii; the ornithopods Draconyx loureiroi, Camptosaurus sp., Phyllodon henkelli, and cf.

5|$|Five days later, on 30 June, a 406-man {{infantry}} {{force from}} 1st Battalion, 21st Infantry Regiment, {{supported by a}} 134-man artillery battery (<b>also</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 24th Infantry Division) was sent into South Korea. The force, nicknamed Task Force Smith for its commander, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Smith, was lightly armed and ordered to delay the advance of North Korean forces {{while the rest of}} the 24th Infantry Division moved into South Korea. On 4 July, the task force set up in the hills north of Osan and prepared to block advancing North Korean forces. The next day, they spotted an incoming column of troops from the North Korean 105th Armored Division. The ensuing battle was a rout, as the Task Force's obsolescent anti-tank weapons and understrength units were no match for the North Koreans' T-34 Tanks and full-strength formations. Within a few hours, the first battle between American and North Korean forces was lost. Task Force Smith suffered 20 killed and 130 wounded in action. Dozens of US soldiers were captured, and when US forces retook the area, some of the prisoners were discovered to have been executed. According to recently declassified documents the troops were captured and taken to Pyongyang where they are thought to have been murdered about three months later.|$|E
5|$|Franken {{was born}} on May 21, 1951, in New York City, the son of Joseph Franken, a {{printing}} salesman, and Phoebe Franken (born Kunst), a real estate agent. His paternal grandparents emigrated from Germany; his maternal grandfather came from Grodno, Belarus, and his maternal grandmother's parents were <b>also</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Russian Empire.

His father opened a quilting factory, but it failed after just two years. The family moved to St. Louis Park, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis. Franken graduated from The Blake School in 1969, where {{he was a member of}} the wrestling team. He attended Harvard College where he majored in political science, graduating cum laude (in the top 25% of the class) with a Bachelor of Arts in 1973.
