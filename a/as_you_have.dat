25|$|Attacking with monster cards is {{the main}} means by which a player reduces the opponent's Life Points to zero. These cards are also used defensively, since the opponent's monsters cannot attack your Life Points {{directly}} as long <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> monsters in play (unless specified otherwise by card effects). Furthermore, most monsters cards have their own effects (just like Spell and Trap cards), and can be manipulated by other cards. Before discussing their many functions and varieties, we will outline the common components of all monster cards.|$|E

[...] Buchanan noted that the contextual attacks [...] "can prove frustratingly tricky <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a brief amount of time to input the commands, but the controls on most handsets are quite small".|$|E
500|$|Jack Straus' 1982 WSOP tournament {{victory is}} {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} greatest comebacks in poker history.

500|$|After {{a period}} of illness Verdi began work on Macbeth in September 1846. He {{dedicated}} the opera to Barezzi: [...] "I have long intended to dedicate an opera to you, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been a father, a benefactor and a friend for me. It was a duty I should have fulfilled sooner if imperious circumstances had not prevented me. Now, I send you Macbeth, which I prize above all my other operas, and therefore deem worthier to present to you."

If he falls into the hands of the mob I do not expect to see you alive." [...] Lockett had already confessed, without the benefit of a lawyer, to the murder. His trial took only thirty minutes as he pleaded guilty but asked for a life sentence instead of death. Despite his plea, he was sentenced to die in the electric chair.|$|E
500|$|He {{was sentenced}} to life on June 27, 1930, on the old murder charge. He {{remained}} silent during the trial. Cascioferro had been arrested some 69 times before and always had been acquitted, but this time it was different. After hearing the sentence the president of the court asked Cascioferro if he had something to say in his defense. Cascioferro stood up and said: [...] "Gentlemen, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been unable to obtain proof of any of the numerous crimes I have committed, you have been reduced to condemning me for the only one I never committed." [...] The [...] "iron prefect", as Mori was known, wanted to give maximum publicity to the event. He had posters printed with pictures of Cascioferro and the text of the court sentence.|$|E

500|$|When {{the republican}} secessionist {{rebellion}} {{known as the}} Ragamuffin War began in Rio Grande do Sul in 1835, one of Caxias' uncles joined the rebels. His father, Francisco de Lima, and possibly another uncle (the Minister of War at the time), also secretly supported the rebellion. On 28 September 1842, Caxias was appointed president and military commander of the province of Rio Grande do Sul. The 16-year-old PedroII allowed Caxias to prove once more that he was unlike his father and uncles {{and gave him a}} short and direct order: [...] "End this revolution, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> ended the others." [...] Caxias brought with him a fellow saquarema and a famous poet, Domingos Gonçalves de Magalhães (later Viscount of Araguaia), to serve as his secretary, as he had previously in Maranhão.|$|E

500|$|Roosevelt was {{impressed}} by some models Saint-Gaudens had prepared for the cent showing a head of Liberty. [...] In early 1907, he wrote to Saint-Gaudens proposing that a Native American or Indian headdress {{be added to the}} obverse of the cent: [...] "I feel very strongly that on at least one coin we ought to have the Indian feather headdress. [...] It is distinctly American, and very picturesque. [...] Couldn't you have just such a head <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> now, but with the feather headdress?" [...] Numismatic historian Walter Breen described this as [...] "the absurd addition of a feathered warbonnet, such as neither Ms. Liberty nor any Native American woman would ever have worn". [...] Art historian Cornelius Vermeule stated that the Indian Head eagle [...] "missed being a great coin because Roosevelt interfered with the choice of headdress (or no headdress) for Liberty".|$|E

500|$|Because of {{his many}} {{absences}} from home, on parliamentary and other business, Richard Cobden was a somewhat remote figure to his daughters, although his letters indicate that he felt warmly towards them and that he wished to direct their political education. In later years they would all acknowledge his influence over their ideas. Both parents impressed on the girls their responsibilities for the poor in the local community; Jane Cobden's 1864 diary records visits to homes and workhouses. She and her younger sister Anne, at the ages of 12 and 10 respectively, taught classes in the local village school. [...] The girls were encouraged by their father to contribute what money they possessed to relieve local poverty: [...] "Do not keep the money... <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> now made up your minds {{to give it to}} poor sufferers, let your own neighbours have it. Your Mama will tell you how to dispose of it, and tell me all about it".|$|E
500|$|In addition, the {{suspension}} of the Indian Hockey Federation in April 2008 also indicated the film's influence. India Today used the title to label the event in two articles, titled [...] "Operation Chak De impact: Jothikumaran resigns" [...] and [...] "Operation Chak de impact: Furore in Lok Sabha". The Indiatimes, in an article titled, [...] "Five wise men set for a Chak De act" [...] also argued, [...] "It looks like Indian hockey has done a real Chak de this time around". In addition, former hockey player Aslam Sher Khan, who was appointed by the Indian Olympic Association to head a committee which will replace the IHF, pointed to the film as a model to work towards. He stated in an interview, [...] "We {{have to make a}} Team India <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> seen in Bollywood blockbuster Chak De! India. There are players from several parts of the country. We have to unite them to make a powerful force." [...] In another interview, he emphasised that he wants [...] "to create a Chak De effect" [...] on hockey in India.|$|E
