25|$|The TV series starts {{about six}} to nine months after all the adults have been killed by an unknown virus. The story is about the {{survival}} of the children and teenagers who are left on their own in and around an unnamed city. The world has become a primitive hell of confusion, danger and fear. With no adults to guide, rule or protect them, the children of the world <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> and need to build a new world they can live in.|$|E
2500|$|A {{university}} student {{involved in an}} exchange program can choose to live [...] on campus or off campus. Living off campus is a popular choice, because students are more independent and {{learn more about the}} new culture when they <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>own.</b> Universities that host exchange students will offer assistance in obtaining accommodation. Universities in Asia have on-campus housing for international students on exchange or studying full-time. Temporary options include hostels, hotels, or renting. Homestays, paid accommodation with a host family, are available in some countries.|$|E
2500|$|Retaliation and {{backlash}} against a victim are very common, particularly a complainant. Victims who {{speak out against}} sexual harassment are often labeled troublemakers who <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> [...] "power trips", or {{who are looking for}} attention. Similar to cases of rape or sexual assault, the victim often becomes the accused, with their appearance, private life, and character likely to fall under intrusive scrutiny and attack. They risk hostility and isolation from colleagues, supervisors, teachers, fellow students, and even friends. They may become the targets of mobbing or relational aggression.|$|E

2500|$|Krill employ {{two types}} of {{spawning}} mechanism. The 57 species of the genera Bentheuphausia, Euphausia, Meganyctiphanes, Thysanoessa, and Thysanopoda are [...] "broadcast spawners": the female releases the fertilised eggs into the water, where they usually sink, disperse, and <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>own.</b> These species generally hatch in the nauplius 1 stage, but have recently been discovered to hatch sometimes as metanauplius or even as calyptopis stages. The remaining 29 species of the other genera are [...] "sac spawners", where the female carries the eggs with her, attached to the rearmost pairs of thoracopods until they hatch as metanauplii, although some species like Nematoscelis difficilis may hatch as nauplius or pseudometanauplius.|$|E
2500|$|The Source Four is {{the first}} fixture to feature a {{rotating}} shutter barrel, which makes framing objects much easier regardless of lamp orientation. In previous fixtures, the shutters had only a limited range of motion {{and could not be}} rotated. [...] The shutters are also made from stainless steel, which does not warp easily under the heat of the lamp. [...] The shutters are arranged in 3 planes, allowing a degree of freedom in shutter placement by the extreme angles they can be racked to. [...] The top and bottom shutters <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> plane, with the 2 side shutters sharing a single plane. [...] Occasionally with difficult shots and extreme shutter angles this sometimes causes the side shutters to hit each other, preventing a perfect focus. [...] One option is to rotate the shutter assembly and try to achieve the same effect with different shutters. [...] A more extreme work around is to remove the shutter assembly from the unit body and reattach it 90° offset, so that the bottom and top shutters effectively become the side shutters.|$|E
2500|$|Truth, for Badiou, is a {{specifically}} philosophical category. While philosophy's several conditions <b>are,</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> terms, [...] "truth procedures" [...] (i.e., they produce truths {{as they are}} pursued), it is only philosophy that can speak of the several truth procedures as truth procedures. (The lover, for instance, does not think of her love as a question of truth, but simply and rightly as a question of love. Only the philosopher sees in the true lover's love the unfolding of a truth.) Badiou has a very rigorous notion of truth, one that is strongly {{against the grain of}} much of contemporary European thought. Badiou at once embraces the traditional modernist notion that truths are genuinely invariant (always and everywhere the case, eternal and unchanging) and the incisively postmodernist notion that truths are constructed through processes. Badiou's theory of truth, exposited throughout his work, accomplishes this strange mixture by uncoupling invariance from self-evidence (such that invariance does not imply self-evidence), as well as by uncoupling constructedness from relativity (such that constructedness does not lead to relativism).|$|E

6000|$|Let us go on, {{and up the}} street, {{after we}} have {{scrambled}} through the usual labyrinth of timber-baulks, rusty anchors, boats which have been dragged, {{for the purpose of}} mending and tarring, into the very middle of the road, and old spars stowed under walls, in the vain hope that they may be of some use for something some day, and have stood the stares and welcomes of the lazy giants who are sitting about upon them, black-locked, black-bearded, with ruddy, wholesome faces, and eyes as bright as diamonds; men who <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> ground, and know it; who will not touch their caps to you, or pull the short black pipe from between their lips as you pass, but expect you to prove yourself a gentleman, by speaking respectfully to them; which, if you do, you will find them as hearty, intelligent, brave fellows as ever walked this earth, capable of anything, from working the naval-brigade guns at Sevastopol, down to running up to ... a hundred miles in a cockleshell lugger, to forestall the early mackerel market.

60|$|Or, so {{it seemed}} to me, {{watching}} a big dance {{at one of the}} hotels. Every European race and breed, and half of the United States were represented, but I fancied I could make out three distinct groupings. The tourists with the steamer-trunk creases still across their dear, excited backs; the military and the officials sure of their partners beforehand, and saying clearly what ought to be said; and a third contingent, lower-voiced, softer-footed, and keener-eyed than the other two, at ease, as gipsies <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> ground, flinging half-words in local argot over shoulders at their friends, understanding on the nod and moved by springs common to their clan only. For example, a woman was talking flawless English to her partner, an English officer. Just before the next dance began, another woman beckoned to her, Eastern fashion, all four fingers flicking downward. The first woman crossed to a potted palm; the second moved toward it also, till the two drew, up, not looking at each other, the plant between them. Then she who had beckoned spoke in a strange tongue at the palm. The first woman, still looking away, answered in the same fashion with a rush of words that rattled like buckshot through the stiff fronds. Her tone {{had nothing to do with}} that in which she greeted her new partner, who came up as the music began. The one was a delicious drawl; the other had been the guttural rasp and click of the kitchen and the bazaar. So she moved off, and, in a little, the second woman disappeared into the crowd. Most likely it was no more than some question of the programme or dress, but the prompt, feline stealth and coolness of it, the lightning-quick return to and from world-apart civilisations stuck in my memory.|$|E
60|$|Foreign Commerce, Colonies, Factories in the East {{and in the}} West, are fallen {{or falling}} {{into the hands of}} sea-ruling Pitt, enemy of human nature. Nevertheless what sound is this that we hear, on the first of June, 1794; sound of as war-thunder borne from the Ocean too; of tone most piercing? War-thunder from off the Brest waters: Villaret-Joyeuse and English Howe, after long {{manoeuvring}} have ranked themselves there; and are belching fire. The enemies of human nature <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> element; cannot be conquered; cannot be kept from conquering. Twelve hours of raging cannonade; sun now sinking westward through the battle-smoke: six French Ships taken, the Battle lost; what Ship soever can still sail, making off! But how is it, then, with that Vengeur Ship, she neither strikes nor makes off? She is lamed, she cannot make off; strike she will not. Fire rakes her fore and aft, from victorious enemies; the Vengeur is sinking. Strong are ye, Tyrants of the Sea; yet we also, are we weak? Lo! all flags, streamers, jacks, every rag of tricolor that will yet run on rope, fly rustling aloft: the whole crew crowds to the upper deck; and, with universal soul-maddening yell, shouts Vive la Republique,--sinking, sinking. She staggers, she lurches, her last drunk whirl; Ocean yawns abysmal: down rushes the Vengeur, carrying Vive la Republique along with her, unconquerable, into Eternity! (Compare Barrere (Chois des Rapports, xiv. 416-21); Lord Howe (Annual Register of 1794, p. 86), &c.) Let foreign Despots think of that. There is an Unconquerable in man, when he stands on his Rights of Man: let Despots and Slaves and all people know this, and only them that stand on the Wrongs of Man tremble to know it.|$|E
