40|$|AbstractSignaling {{qualities and}} {{economic}} performances of advertising can generate {{a competitive advantage}} at ‘hard times’, when cultural firms diversify their revenues as Welfare States {{do not have enough}} resources for them. Using a recent microeconomic database we empirically estimate the relation between intangible assets, advertising expenses, revenues and profits for Italian Visual Arts, whose sample is defined referring to the latest legislative definition that includes ‘landscape’. The intangible asset includes <b>advertising</b> <b>investments</b> and brands whose signaling value is undoubted at ‘hard times’, when cultural entrepreneurs have to signal their ‘identity and reputation’ in order to increase grants and, as a consequence, revenues. The research gives evidence that Visual Arts whose advertising expenses are one third of program service expenses, are profitable despite of the financial crisis. Brand reputability is connected to advertising expenses much more than to intangible assets that can include <b>advertising</b> <b>investments</b> and brands...|$|R

5000|$|Product Red {{has been}} criticized for not having an effect {{proportional}} to the <b>advertising</b> <b>investment,</b> for being much less efficient than direct charitable contribution, and for having a lack of transparency with regards to the amount of money going to charity as a percentage of every purchase. Some critics argue that a retail middleman between donor and charity is unnecessary; donors should just give. For example, some argued that Gap’s website encouraged consumption of the products, thus, encouraging companies to use the product for publicity, rather than social responsibility. While Product Red has helped give funds and attention to the problem, it does not form a relationship between the donors and recipients. Scholars argue that this sacrifices the purpose of movements such as Product Red. Jessica Wirgau, a professor at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute stated that, [...] "Red not only misses the opportunity to promote civic engagement with its audience but also.... gives corporations the power to decide which causes should be supported and to what degree". Another critique is that Product Red's expansion into traditional fundraising techniques, such as art auctions, undermines its claim to be a different and more sustainable approach to raising money for AIDS. Other critics have pointed out that its emphasis on funding treatment for AIDS sufferers meant that large amounts of the money will ultimately end up with pharmaceutical companies [...] "unwilling to distribute their drugs for free". Many accuse the campaign of profiting by using diseases as a marketing vehicle, for being [...] "cause branding" [...] rather than corporate social responsibility. In the Stanford Social Innovation Review, Mark Rosenman wrote that it was an [...] "example of the corporate world aligning its operations with its central purpose of increasing shareholder profit, except this time it is being cloaked in the patina of philanthropy." ...|$|E
40|$|Research has {{recognized}} {{that the price of}} an experience good is not only determined by firm and collective reputation, which act as proxies of firm product quality, but also by the firm's <b>advertising</b> <b>investment.</b> This study examines whether pricing these goods as a function of firm <b>advertising</b> <b>investment</b> and firm reputation depends on a collective, versus noncollective, brand strategy. The central assumption of this article is that a collective brand can increase perceived differentiation among the individual brands associated with it, and thus, that collective brand membership can moderate the effects of firm <b>advertising</b> <b>investment</b> and firm reputation on product price. The results obtained from a panel of companies in an experience-goods industry (i. e., wineries) between 1999 and 2013 show that the relative effect of collective brand membership on product price is higher when the company has higher <b>advertising</b> <b>investment</b> and a higher reputation...|$|E

By joining forces with producers of other regions to invest in advertising, producers may penetrate into new markets. We show that entering new markets may be profitable according to the relative size of the markets, the fixed costs of advertising, and the market situation in the internal and new markets. We discuss the policy implications of the results, arguing about possibile modifications of the AO system to facilitate collective action and improve investment levels...|$|R
50|$|Local {{search is}} the natural {{evolution}} of traditional off-line advertising, typically distributed by newspaper publishers and TV and radio broadcasters, to the Web. Historically, consumers relied on local newspapers and local TV and radio stations to find local product and services.

In recent years, the number of local searches online has grown rapidly while off-line information searches, such as print Yellow Page lookups, have declined. As a natural consequence of this shift in consumer behavior, local product and service providers are slowly shifting their <b>advertising</b> <b>investments</b> from traditional off-line media to local search engines.|$|R

40|$|The {{advertisement}} {{can increase}} the consumers demand; therefore {{it is one of}} the most important marketing strategies in the operations management of enterprises. This paper aims to analyze the impact of <b>advertising</b> <b>investment</b> on a discrete dynamic supply chain network which consists of suppliers, manufactures, retailers, and demand markets associated at different tiers under random demand. The impact of <b>advertising</b> <b>investment</b> will last several planning periods besides the current period due to delay effect. Based on noncooperative game theory, variational inequality, and Lagrange dual theory, the optimal economic behaviors of the suppliers, the manufactures, the retailers, and the consumers in the demand markets are modeled. In turn, the supply chain network equilibrium model is proposed and computed by modified project contraction algorithm with fixed step. The effectiveness of the model is illustrated by numerical examples, and managerial insights are obtained through the analysis of <b>advertising</b> <b>investment</b> in multiple periods and advertising delay effect among different periods...|$|E

This paper analyzes co-op advertising behavior based on a dual-brand model with a single manufacturer and a single retailer, and some interesting conclusions are achieved. Firstly, the firm in the supply chain advertises both brands, and the difference of advertising expenditure is not very large in equilibrium. Secondly, the retailer's advertising and the manufacturer's participation ratios depend on both the retailer's and the manufacturer's marginal profits. Thirdly, the stimulating effect increases the <b>advertising</b> <b>investment</b> while the competition effect decreases it, {{but they have no}} effect on the manufacturer's participation ratio. Fourthly, co-op {{advertising is}} more sensitive to the manufacturer's marginal profits than those of the retailer.

40|$|The {{recession}} {{that most of}} the world economies have been facing in the last years has caused a great interest in the study of its macroeconomic effects. In this context, a debate has resurged regarding the <b>advertising</b> <b>investment,</b> as for its potential capacity to impel the consumer spending and to impact positively on the economic recovery. This idea, sustained in the so-called Galbraith's hypothesis, constitutes the core of this paper, where the main objective is to test that hypothesis by means of an empirical analysis. In this study, we focus on the Spanish case and the data correspond to the period 1976 - 2010. A cointegration analysis is carried out, using two different approaches (Engle-Granger test and Gregory-Hansen test, respectively), to determine if there is any relationship between the <b>advertising</b> <b>investment</b> and six macromagnitudes (GDP, National Income, Consumption, Savings and Fixed Capital Formation), as well as the registered unemployment rate.

My proxy for proprietary costs is {{an estimate of the}} spillover effects of advertising.

Valuation benefits are defined by an estimate of the relation between the firm's own advertising outlays and its market value or future operating income.

Observed advertising levels escalate in larger US markets. At the same time, the number of advertised brands in an industry appears to be invariant to market size. Therefore, the size-distribution of brands across markets is characterized by bigger (i. e. more heavily advertised) as opposed to more brands in larger markets. Correspondingly, observed concentration levels in advertising-intensive industries are bounded away from zero irrespective of market size...|$|R
40|$|<b>Advertising</b> for <b>investment</b> {{products}} {{has changed}} over the past 50 years. Ads initially targeted investors as defined in standard finance: that is, as fact-seeking utility maximizers. Ad portrayals gradually changed to target consumers, defined as people pursuing diverse life projects. Verbal and factual appeals were supplanted by rhetorical, figurative, pictorial, and narrative appeals. Standard finance views such advertising as problematic, because it may be deceitful and misleading. Perspectives drawn from strategic marketing, in conjunc-tion with behavioral finance, and also Consumer Culture Theory, help to explain why mutual fund ads violate expectations from finance. A macromarketing perspective goes further, explaining <b>investment</b> <b>advertising</b> as a historically situated human action subject to social forces.

40|$|To better {{understand}} the different effects of the myopic and far-sighted behaviors on the advertising coordination in dynamic supply chain, this paper takes the reference price effect into consideration and formulates four differential game models for the two-level supply chain composed of a manufacturer and a retailer in the situation of Stackelberg game. In our models, the market demand {{is assumed to be}} affected by the goodwill, reference price, and the <b>advertising</b> <b>investment,</b> in which the <b>advertising</b> <b>investment</b> can promote the construction of goodwill and such goodwill can further enhance the reference price. The results show that the participating members in the supply chain should invest more in advertisement to improve the goodwill and the relative reference price reflected in the minds of consumers. A far-sighted manufacturer will invest more in the advertisement and charge a higher wholesale price regardless of the behavior choice of the retailer. However, such kind of ignorance leads to different results on the retail pricing strategies of the retailer. The numerical analyses are given in the end to verify the effectiveness of the conclusions which provide the theoretical support to the dynamic supply chain coordination in practice...|$|E

40|$|Major {{sports events}} draw {{unsurpassed}} media attention. Companies {{are motivated to}} increase their <b>advertising</b> <b>investments</b> around these events to reach large audiences in a short period. Is such an advertising surge actually beneficial though, or should companies avoid advertising in these periods because of negative effects of competitive interference? This study investigates when consumer packaged goods companies should invest in advertising to increase sales: before, during, or after the event or outside these event periods. The author estimates short- and long-term own- and cross-advertising elasticities for 206 brands using four years of weekly data. Although considerable heterogeneity exists across brands, own-advertising effectiveness diminishes especially before and during major sports events, in both the short and the long run. In addition, brands benefit less from category-demand effects through competitors' advertising. Conversely, greater increases in advertising spending resulting in significant growth in share of voice around focused, single-sport events are a successful strategy to overcome this overall general negative trend.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{temporal}} effects of advertising expenditures on firm sales. Grounding on some econometric models that have been applied to the measure of advertising effectiveness, we provide evidence that {{the extent to which}} <b>advertising</b> <b>investments</b> display their effect over time varies with the goals of the advertising itself. In this respect, we distinguish between informative and persuasive advertising, and analyze whether these two types differ in the magnitude of their carry-over effect on sales. We find that a total aggregate carry-over effect of advertising expenditures exists, and, importantly, we show that the two different categories of advertising have different lagged effects on sales. In particular, persuasive advertising has a more persistent effect than informative advertising. This analysis has been conducted considering both current and past investments in each of the two categories.
