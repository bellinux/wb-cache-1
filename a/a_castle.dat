5|$|Although {{sometimes}} {{the construction of}} <b>a</b> <b>castle</b> led {{to the destruction of}} a village, such as at Eaton Socon in England, it was more common for the villages nearby to have grown {{as a result of the}} presence of <b>a</b> <b>castle.</b> Sometimes planned towns or villages were created around <b>a</b> <b>castle.</b> The benefits of castle building on settlements was not confined to Europe. When the 13th-century Safad Castle was founded in Galilee in the Holy Land, the 260villages benefitted from the inhabitants' newfound ability to move freely. When built, <b>a</b> <b>castle</b> could result in the restructuring of the local landscape, with roads moved for the convenience of the lord. Settlements could also grow naturally around <b>a</b> <b>castle,</b> rather than being planned, due to the benefits of proximity to an economic centre in a rural landscape and the safety given by the defences. Not all such settlements survived, as once the castle lost its importance– perhaps succeeded by a manor house as the centre of administration– the benefits of living next to <b>a</b> <b>castle</b> vanished and the settlement depopulated.|$|E
5|$|As an {{alternative}} to the time-consuming task of creating a breach, an escalade could be attempted to capture the walls with fighting along the walkways behind the battlements. In this instance, attackers would be vulnerable to arrowfire. A safer option for those assaulting <b>a</b> <b>castle</b> was to use a siege tower, sometimes called a belfry. Once ditches around <b>a</b> <b>castle</b> were partially filled in, these wooden, movable towers could be pushed against the curtain wall. As well as offering some protection for those inside, a siege tower could overlook the interior of <b>a</b> <b>castle,</b> giving bowmen an advantageous position from which to unleash missiles.|$|E
5|$|The {{section is}} entered through a fortresses' walls, over <b>a</b> <b>castle</b> moat. The front facade of Wonderland Theatre, {{previously}} Canterbury Theatre, {{was designed as}} <b>a</b> <b>castle,</b> and the other buildings were designed to fit the same time period.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to the special castling move in western chess, shogi castles require making multiple individual moves {{with more than one}} piece. The simplest castle involves two pieces and requires three moves, but it is more common to move at least three different pieces. For example, <b>a</b> simple Mino <b>castle</b> (美濃) requires moving the king, the rook (飛), a silver, and two golds for a total of six moves. Others such as the Static Rook Anaguma castle (居飛車穴熊) are more complex, which requires moving the king, a pawn, the bishop (角), a lance (香), a silver, and two golds for a total of twelve moves. Furthermore, there are piece development relations between <b>castles.</b> For instance, <b>a</b> basic Mino <b>castle</b> can be developed into <b>a</b> Silver Crown <b>castle,</b> <b>a</b> Gold Yagura <b>castle</b> can be developed into <b>a</b> Complete Yagura <b>castle,</b> <b>a</b> Boat <b>castle</b> into <b>an</b> Anaguma <b>castle,</b> <b>a</b> Gold Excelsior <b>castle</b> into <b>a</b> Left Yagura <b>castle,</b> and so on.|$|R

5|$|Lundy has 23 holiday properties, {{sleeping}} {{between one}} and 14 people. These include a lighthouse, <b>a</b> <b>castle</b> and a Victorian mansion. Many of the buildings are constructed from the island's granite.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} was constructed of Portland stone, largely over two storeys {{but with a}} three story octagonal tower between the two wings, {{as well as a}} square tower to the north above the porte-cochère. The walls feature castellated parapets, turrets and pinnacles, giving the building the feel of <b>a</b> <b>castle</b> in the gothic style. The building has an asymmetric feel, in a picturesque style, with varying shapes and elevations to different sections. The intent was to give <b>a</b> <b>castle</b> style to the building, reminiscent of historical fortresses, but with the comfortable interior of a house.|$|E
5|$|The {{village of}} Mere {{was a small}} and {{unimportant}} settlement in the early 13th century. In 1243 Richard, the Earl of Cornwall, acquired the manor. Richard was the brother of Henry III and immensely rich. In 1253 he began to build <b>a</b> <b>castle</b> at Mere.|$|E

50|$|Peebles <b>Castle</b> was <b>a</b> 12th-century <b>castle</b> built near Peebles, Scotland. Peebles {{was created}} a royal burgh by King David I of Scotland in the 12th century. The <b>castle,</b> once <b>a</b> royal <b>castle,</b> was built as <b>a</b> motte-and-bailey <b>castle.</b> Nothing remains above ground.|$|R
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>castle</b> {{here could}} guard {{several of the}} main {{strategic}} routes and form part {{of a network of}} strongholds of the Norman kingdom, in the former Danish Mercia, roughly the area today referred to as the East Midlands, to control the country internally. Also it was a centre from which troops could be sent to repel Scandinavian landings anywhere on the coast from the Trent to the Welland, to a large extent, by using the roads which the Romans had constructed for the same purpose.|$|E
5|$|After King Henry's {{death in}} 1135, Basset was not {{employed}} as a royal official, either as a justice or as a sheriff. He appears once as a witness to a charter of King Stephen's in 1136, but the authenticity of this document has been questioned. He had built <b>a</b> <b>castle</b> in Normandy at Montreuil-au-Houlme, but Basset did not have possession of it in 1136, when it was held against Stephen's opponents by William de Montpincon.|$|E
5|$|After the Norman {{conquest of}} England, William the Conqueror {{established}} a motte-and-bailey castle at Warwick in 1068 {{to maintain control}} of the Midlands as he advanced northwards. Building <b>a</b> <b>castle</b> in a pre-existing settlement could require demolishing properties on the intended site. In the case of Warwick, the least recorded of the 11urban castles in the 1086 survey, four houses were torn down {{to make way for}} the castle. A motte-and-bailey castle consists of a mound– on which usually stands a keep or tower– and a bailey, which is an enclosed courtyard. William appointed Henry de Beaumont, the son of a powerful Norman family, as constable of the castle. In 1088, Henry de Beaumont was made the first Earl of Warwick. He founded the Church of All Saints within the castle walls by 1119; the Bishop of Worcester, believing that <b>a</b> <b>castle</b> was an inappropriate location for a church, removed it in 1127–28.|$|E

5|$|Ballistas or springalds were siege {{engines that}} {{worked on the}} same {{principles}} as crossbows. With their origins in Ancient Greece, tension was used to project a bolt or javelin. Missiles fired from these engines had a lower trajectory than trebuchets or mangonels and were more accurate. They were more commonly used against the garrison rather than the buildings of <b>a</b> <b>castle.</b> Eventually cannons developed {{to the point where}} they were more powerful and had a greater range than the trebuchet, and became the main weapon in siege warfare.|$|E
5|$|Banjo-Tooie was {{developed}} by Rare and designed by Gregg Mayles, who previously worked on Banjo-Kazooie. Development of the game started in June 1998. Some features that were originally cut during the development of Banjo-Kazooie, such as some of its worlds and a multiplayer game mode, were instead integrated into Banjo-Tooie. An additional world set in <b>a</b> <b>castle</b> was planned, but due to time constraints, it was scrapped during development and assets from it were used in constructing Cauldron Keep. The game features roughly 150 total characters, including enemies and non-playable characters.|$|E
5|$|Before the Industrial Revolution, {{the area}} {{contained}} the separate settlements of Runcorn, Higher Runcorn, Halton, Weston, Weston Point, and Norton. The administrative {{functions of the}} area were initially concentrated in Halton, which contained <b>a</b> <b>castle</b> and a court, while the parish church was in Runcorn. The population increase associated with industrialisation resulted in considerable expansion, so that the formerly discrete settlements were absorbed into the current urban area, much of which dates from the 19th and 20th centuries.|$|E

5|$|Building <b>a</b> <b>castle</b> {{sometimes}} {{required the}} permission of the king or other high authority. In 864 the King of West Francia, Charles the Bald, prohibited the construction of castella without his permission and ordered them all to be destroyed. This is perhaps the earliest reference to castles, though military historian R. Allen Brown points out that the word castella may have applied to any fortification at the time.|$|E
5|$|Château de Chinon is <b>a</b> <b>castle</b> {{located on}} the bank of the Vienne river in Chinon, France. It was founded by Theobald I, Count of Blois. In the 11thcentury the castle became the {{property}} of the counts of Anjou. In 1156 Henry II of England, a member of the House of Anjou, took the castle from his brother Geoffrey after he had rebelled for a second time. Henry favoured the Château de Chinon as a residence: most of the standing structure can be attributed to his reign and he died there in 1189.|$|E
5|$|Domesday {{makes it}} obvious that Urse {{was the most}} {{powerful}} layman in Worcester, and {{the only person who}} could contest his power in the county was the Bishop of Worcester. The power struggle continued into the 12th century, as Urse's descendants still contested the bishops. Only one other layman is recorded as having <b>a</b> <b>castle</b> in Worcestershire in Domesday, and he held much less land than Urse.|$|E
