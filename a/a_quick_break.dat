Valverde and Gerrans contested a two-man sprint for the line which Valverde narrowly won, but Gerrans' second-place finish allowed him to take the ochre jersey ahead of Valverde; both riders were on the same time, but due to better cumulative stage finishes, Gerrans took the jersey. Machado finished third ahead of Rogers and Dennis, with the three riders also in that order, taking third, fourth and fifth places in the overall standings and within fifteen seconds of Gerrans' lead. Edvald Boasson Hagen maintained his lead for [...] in the sprints classification after finishing sixth on the stage, Dennis added the youth classification lead to his lead of the mountains classification, and O'Grady was named most combative rider of the day.|$|E

5000|$|NBC {{was also}} criticized by fans for {{incorporating}} long commercial breaks during the race, {{much longer than}} the breaks that Fox would run during its race telecasts.

40|$|Novel wing designs will {{incorporate}} advanced wing-tip {{devices for}} <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> wake-vortex <b>break</b> down {{and an increased}} wing performance through different devices, e. g. differential flap setting, airbrakes (vented spoilers), large winglets, mini trailing-edge devices and sub-boundary layer vortex generators. Advanced wing configurations will enhance the aircraft's capability to perform noise abatement flight procedures, but may also generate excess aerodynamic noise. To provide first information on spectral noise characteristics of different devices, noise measurements were performed to check-out the devices' aeroacoustic characteristics. This study was performed in DLR's Aeroacoustic Wind Tunnel (AWB) on a 1 / 10. 6 scaled A 340 model wing in high lift configuration. All different devices were tested individually {{by means of an}} acoustic mirror. The following major results were obtained: (1) As a means to enhance the decay of wake vortices but avoid excess aerodynamic noise generation, DFS (except for the 0 °/ 32 ° configuration) is superior over different spoiler settings or any of the tested individual wake vortex devices. (2) Noise from mini TEDs gain importance for deflection angles above 60 °. (3) Even small spoiler deflections cause significant excess noise generation. (4) SBVGs were found to be essentially uncritical with respect to excess aerodynamic noise generation...|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} ways to treat sensory overload. One way to reduce this tension is to participate in occupational therapy; however, {{there are many ways}} for people with symptoms to reduce it themselves. Being able to identify one's own triggers of sensory overload can help reduce, eliminate, or avoid them. Most often the quickest way to ease sensory overload symptoms is to remove oneself from the situation. Deep pressure against the skin combined with proprioceptive input that stimulates the receptors in the joints and ligaments often calms the nervous system. Reducing sensory input such as eliminating distressing sounds and lowering the lights can help. Calming, focusing music works for some. If <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> <b>break</b> does not relieve the problem, an extended rest is advised. People with sensory processing issues may benefit from a sensory diet of activities and accommodations designed to prevent sensory overload and retrain the brain to process sensory input more typically. It is important in situations of sensory overload to calm oneself and return to a normal level.|$|E

The aftermath was never officially recorded but in an explosion of cosmic energy, the Rag Doll was found blasted to a painful death.

The next afternoon, Rag Doll's body disappeared from the morgue.|$|E
50|$|Ideally {{students}} should be getting physical activity before they try to learn new material. Exercise shapes our muscles along with strengthening {{the areas of the}} brain.

However, if it is not possible for students to have physical activity before you class, {{there are many ways to}} get students out of their seats and moving during a class period. Students can get out of their seats to turn an assignment in or to pick up a handout. You could have students stand up to share their answers to questions posed by the teacher. After they have shared their answers with each other they may sit down. If students are acting tired and drowsy a teacher could give students <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> <b>break</b> to stand up and stretch. Once they get out of their seats and move around for a bit they will act more alert.
