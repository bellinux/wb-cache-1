40|$|Background: Decreased fetal {{movements}} (DFM) {{are associated}} with fetal growth restriction and stillbirth, presumably linked through an underlying placental dysfunction. Yet, the role of placental pathology has received limited attention in DFM studies. Our main objective was to explore whether maternal perceptions of DFM were associated with placental pathology in pregnancies recruited from a low-risk total population. Methods/Principal Findings: Placentas from 129 DFM and 191 non-DFM pregnancies were examined according to standardized macro- and microscopic protocols. DFM was defined as any maternal complaint of DFM leading to a hospital examination. Morphological findings were timed and graded according to their estimated onset and clinical importance, and classified in line with a newly constructed Norwegian classification system for reporting placental pathology. With our population-based approach {{we were unable to}} link DFM to an overall measure of all forms of placental pathology (OR 1. 3, 95 % CI 0. 8 – 2. 2, p = 0. 249). However, placental pathology leading to imminent delivery could be a competing risk for DFM, making separate subgroup analyses more appropriate. Our study suggests a link between DFM and macroscopic placental pathology related to maternal, uteroplacental vessels, i. e. infarctions, placental lesions (intraplacental hematomas) and <b>abruptions.</b> Although not statistically significant separately, a compound measure showed a significant association with DFM (OR 2. 4, 95 %CI 1. 1 – 5. 0, p = 0. 023).

40|$|Assessment of {{thyroid disease}} in {{pregnancy}} {{is important for}} gestational maternal health, obstetric outcome and, subsequent development of child. Pregnancy has pro­found effects on the regulation of thyroid function, and on thyroidal functional disorders, {{that need to be}} recognized, carefully evaluated and correctly managed. In women with normal thyroid function there is an increase in thyroxine (T 4) and triiodothyronine (T 3) production and inhibition of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in the first trimester of pregnancy,. In the pregnant woman, elevated thyroxine-binding globulin (TGB) and concomitant increases in total T 4 and T 3 levels plateau at 12 - 14 weeks of pregnancy, and free T 4 measurements slowly decrease. The most frequent thyroid disorder in pregnancy is maternal hy­pothyroidism. It is associated with fetal loss, placental <b>abruptions,</b> preeclampsia, preterm delivery and reduced intellectual function in the offspring. Hyperthyroidism dur­ing pregnancy is relatively uncommon, with a prevalence estimated to range between 0. 1 % and 1 %. The most common cause of hyperthyroidism is Graves disease, as this etiology accounts for 85 % of clinical hyperthyroid­ism in pregnancy. Another cause of hyperthyroidism is hyperemesis gravidarum. This is common and requires differentiation from Graves disease. There has been much discussion and many publications on the optimal management of pregnant women who are hyperthyroid or hypothyroid.

40|$|Objective: Ruptures of the tracheobronchial tree {{present a}} {{life-threatening}} situation. Nevertheless, therapy is still controversial. Though conservative treatment by antibiotics and intubation with the cuff in¯ated distal to the tear is favored by some authors, surgical repair is unavoidable in many cases. Methods: We present {{a series of}} 31 patients (mean age 43. 6 years, range 8 ± 72 years) with iatrogenous or post-traumatic tracheobronchial ruptures treated since 1975. Fifteen ruptures were longitudinal tears of the trachea, not extending lower than a distance of 3 cm from the bifurcation, 11 involved the bifurcation and/or the main bronchi. The total length of the longitudinal tears ranged from 2 to 12 cm, ®ve were transverse near complete <b>abruptions</b> of the trachea or main bronchi. Involvement of the full thickness of the wall with free view into the pleural space or to the esophageal wall was present in 29 cases. Twenty-nine out of the 31 patients underwent surgical repair and two were treated conservatively. The length and depth of the lesion, the degree of subcutaneous emphysema, pneumothorax and/or pneumomediastinum as well as clinical signs suggesting incipient mediastinitis were considered when making the decision for surgery. Results: Twenty-®ve out of the 29 patients experienced an uneventful recovery. Four patients died of sepsis unrelated to the tracheobronchial trauma. One of the two patients who underwent conservative therapy also recovered uneventfully. The other one died because of multi-organ failure due to underlying myocardial infarction.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{validate}} umbilical arterial and venous pH {{and base}} deficit (pH(UA), pH(UV), BD(UA), and BD(UV), respectively), {{as well as}} venous-arterial pH differences, as measures of perinatal condition at birth (in relation to emergency intervention, resuscitation, facial mask, low Apgar, seizures, other cerebral problems or death); to investigate whether BD(UA) or pH(UA) better measures perinatal risk. STUDY DESIGN: A novel method (Event Rate Estimate (EveREst) plots) was used to analyze cord blood gases and perinatal outcomes of 34, 510 term singleton deliveries: cord blood gas values were grouped into exclusive quantiles (containing equal proportions of cases); the quantiles were plotted against per cent rates (event rates) for perinatal outcomes; the event rates for the different blood gases were compared using the χ² test for difference of proportions. RESULTS: Low pH(UA) predicts poor perinatal outcome better than or comparably to high BD(UA) : pH(UA) is significantly better than BD(UA) for predicting low Apgar, resuscitation and facial mask (p< 0. 001, p< 0. 05, and p< 0. 001, respectively). For seizures and other cerebral problems, low pH(UA) is better than high BD(UA) but the difference is not statistically significant. For death, both measures perform equally well. Interventions for the specific reason of "fetal distress" increased as pH(UA) decreased but only where electronic fetal monitoring was used. In acidemic neonates (pH(UA) ≤ 7. 05, n= 1752), significantly more cord prolapses and placenta <b>abruptions</b> were associated with large and small venous-arterial pH difference (pH(VAD)) respectively (p< 0. 01). CONCLUSION: EveREst plots display clearly the diagnostic value of cord gases. They allow for the easy identification of background rates and increases above background, thresholds of interest, and comparison of the blood gas measures. Overall pH(UA) is the best umbilical blood measure of perinatal outcome. BD(UA) is comparable or inferior. Extremes of pH(VAD) (large or small) identify higher proportions of specific poor outcomes in acidemic neonates...|$|R
6000|$|FLY-SPECK, n. The {{prototype}} of punctuation. It is observed by Garvinus that the systems of punctuation in {{use by the}} various literary nations depended originally upon the social habits and general diet of the flies infesting the several countries. These creatures, which have always been distinguished for a neighborly and companionable familiarity with authors, liberally or niggardly embellish the manuscripts in process of growth under the pen, according to their bodily habit, bringing out {{the sense of the}} work by a species of interpretation superior to, and independent of, the writer's powers. The [...] "old masters" [...] of literature--that is to say, the early writers whose work is so esteemed by later scribes and critics in the same language--never punctuated at all, but worked right along free-handed, without that <b>abruption</b> of the thought which comes from the use of points. (We observe the same thing in children to-day, whose usage in this particular is a striking and beautiful instance of the law that the infancy of individuals reproduces the methods and stages of development characterizing the infancy of races.) In the work of these primitive scribes all the punctuation is found, by the modern investigator with his optical instruments and chemical tests, to have been inserted by the writers' ingenious and serviceable collaborator, the common house-fly--Musca maledicta. In transcribing these ancient MSS, for the purpose of either making the work their own or preserving what they naturally regard as divine revelations, later writers reverently and accurately copy whatever marks they find upon the papyrus or parchment, to the unspeakable enhancement of the lucidity of the thought and value of the work. Writers contemporary with the copyists naturally avail themselves of the obvious advantages of these marks in their own work, and with such assistance as the flies of their own household may be willing to grant, frequently rival and sometimes surpass the older compositions, in respect at least of punctuation, which is no small glory. Fully to understand the important services that flies perform to literature it is only necessary to lay a page of some popular novelist alongside a saucer of cream-and-molasses in a sunny room and observe [...] "how the wit brightens and the style refines" [...] in accurate proportion to the duration of exposure.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Most {{pertinent}} {{studies of}} inadequate antenatal care {{concentrate on the}} risk profile of women booking late or not booking at all to antenatal care. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the outcome of pregnancies when free and easily accessible antenatal care has been either totally lacking or low in number of visits. Methods This is a hospital register based cohort study of pregnancies treated in Kuopio University Hospital, Finland, in 1989 – 2001. Pregnancy outcomes of women having low numbers (1 – 5) of antenatal care visits (n = 207) and no antenatal care visits (n = 270) were compared with women having 6 – 18 antenatal visits (n = 23137). Main outcome measures were: Low birth weight, fetal death, neonatal death. Adverse pregnancy outcomes were controlled for confounding factors (adjusted odds ratios, OR: s) in multiple logistic regression models. Results Of the analyzed pregnant population, 1. 0 % had no antenatal care visits and 0. 77 % had 1 – 5 visits. Under- or non-attendance associated with social and health behavioral risk factors: unmarried status, lower educational level, young maternal age, smoking and alcohol use. Chorio-amnionitis or placental <b>abruptions</b> were more common complications of pregnancies of women avoiding antenatal care, and pregnancy outcome was impaired. After logistic regression analyses, controlling for confounding, there were significantly more low birth weight infants in under- and non-attenders (OR:s with 95 % CI:s: 9. 18 (6. 65 – 12. 68) and 5. 46 (3. 90 – 7. 65), respectively) more fetal deaths (OR:s 12. 05 (5. 95 – 24. 40) and 5. 19 (2. 04 – 13. 22), respectively) and more neonatal deaths (OR:s 10. 03 (3. 85 – 26. 13) and 8. 66 (3. 59 – 20. 86), respectively). Conclusion Even when birth takes place in hospital, non- or under-attendance at antenatal care carries a substantially elevated risk of severe adverse pregnancy outcome.

40|$|Highway-rail grade {{crossings}} (HRGCs) and the intersections {{in their}} proximity are areas where potential problems {{in terms of}} safety and efficiency often arise if only simple or outdated treatments, such as normal signal timing or passive railroad warning signs, are utilized. When {{it comes to a}} corridor or a network with multiple HRGCs and heavy train traffic, the problems will be more complicated due to randomness of train arrivals and frequent <b>abruptions</b> of normal signal timing operation of the whole corridor. This dissertation deals with this issue and develops a methodology of signal timing optimization that is specially designed for such a corridor/network. Due to high time and money costs associated with testing the methodology in the field, and safety issues related to field experiments, the proposed optimization program was instead developed, used, and evaluated in a micro-simulation environment using the VISSIM simulation software package. To replicate field conditions, real train data has been collected from the field test bed using advanced train detection technologies and input into the simulation models. Moreover, the stochastic nature of traffic has been considered in the simulation experiment by conducting multiple simulation runs with random seeds. ^ The developed optimization methodology consists of four parts: a train arrival prediction model, a GA-based optimization program, an advanced preemption strategy, and a calibrated VISSIM simulation model of the study network. The train arrival prediction model is developed using the train data collected from the test bed. Regression models and kinematic models are compared, and regression models outperformed kinematic models in prediction accuracy. A bootstrap method is used to obtain prediction error means and error bounds of the regression models. The GA-based optimization program is developed using Matlab and Visual Basic programming language. The advanced preemptions strategy is coded using VAP, an add-on programming module of VISSIM. The VISSIM simulation model of the study network is calibrated to local traffic conditions using a GA algorithm. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to test the proposed methodology. It can be concluded that the methodology can significantly improve both the safety and efficiency of the study corridor with HRGCs in both offline and online scenarios, however, at the cost of higher network delay. The effects of the prediction errors on the safety and operation of the study network are also analyzed. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the causes and consequences of a severe acidosis of the newborn and to correlate umbilical blood gas parameters with indicators of early morbidity and neonatal death. This retrospective study was based on the review of maternal and neonatal charts of 71 infants who were born from 01 / 2000 - 06 / 2006 with an umbilical artery pH below 7. 0, and a control group of the same size. The relationship between umbilical artery pH, standard base excess, standard bicarbonate and lactate on one side and variables of delivery and the neonatal period on the other side was determined. Most of the newborns had a mixed acidemia with a metabolic component. Whereas for the term infants it seemed as if prenatal alterations were the main cause for the development of a severe acidosis, acute birth complications, such as placental <b>abruptions,</b> were the most common cause for the preterm infants. The rate of emergency caesarean section was significantly higher in the acidosis group than in the control group for both term and preterm infants. Neonatal morbidity was higher in the acidosis group. The rates of intubation, admission to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) and neurological complications were higher, while apgar values were lower than in the control group. There were two neonatal deaths, in both cases the umbilical artery pH was 6. 54, the lowest value recorded in this study. The umbilical blood gas parameters of the term newborns correlated significantly with the neonatal complications. Especially low pH and base excess were powerful indicators and showed a correlation with low apgar values, rate and duration of intubation, duration in the NICU and rate of neurological complications and neonatal deaths. For the preterm infants the most powerful parameter was lactate levels, which correlated with the rate of neurological complications. In this study bicarbonate levels were less useful than expected, probably because of the incomplete dataset on bicarbonate. With this study it is not possible to make any conclusions for the long-term sequelae after a severe acidosis. It is known that the majority of acidotic newborns have no later sequelae. In contrast, if neurological seizures occur during the neonatal period after a sever acidosis it makes long-term sequelae more probable. The aim of modern obstetrics should be to aspire to the birth of a vital nonacidotic newborn because the short-term and long-term morbidity is significant higher after a severe acidosis...|$|R

40|$|Multiphase flowline-riser systems {{sometimes}} encounter {{fluctuations in}} flow rate, pressure and liquid hold-up characterized as severe slugging. Slugging is undesirable because the piping and downstream receiving facilities {{are exposed to}} extra loads from the fluctuations that may damage the equipment and cause <b>abruptions</b> in the production. Two types of severe slug behaviour exist: Type 1 (SS I), which has a slug length larger than the riser, and Type 2 (SS II), which has a slug length smaller than the riser. In the literature a number of criteria are described that mark {{the boundaries of the}} flow regime where such slugs exist. An example is given in the figure below. At high liquid flowrates, severe slugging of both types is eliminated because of hydro-dynamic slugs that appear in the flowline upstream of the riser base, or by 'Stability of severe slugging', which means that the fast liquid production that causes gas blow-out and depressurization of the flowline in severe slugging cannot happen. At high gas flowrates, the cycle is eliminated because the flow in the riser becomes stable; that a positive flow perturbation is impeded by increased pressure drop in the riser. At low liquid flowrates, severe slugging will be of type 2 (SS II). The bound-ary between the two is marked by the Bøe-criterion, which states that severe slug-ging will be of type 2 if the inflow of gas is sufficient to prevent the slug of growing in both directions and into the flowline. The main aim of the current study was to reproduce the severe slugging cycle in flow loop experiments, and to investigate whether modifications to the system could minimize or even fully eliminate such slugs. The experiments have been conducted in the 2 inch water/air flowline-riser loop at Shell s technology centre in Amsterdam (STCA). The first part of the experimental activity in the project focused on finding the operating region where severe slugging can occur (the severe slugging envelope). The purpose of the second part was to achieve knowledge of how this region could be minimized by minor modifications to the system. A number of options for such modifications exist, and gas-lift, active topside choking using the Shell Smart Choke, or a combination of both was considered. However, due to a limited time span of the project and also technical issues that caused delays in the start-up of experiments, only gas-lift was finally performed. It was indeed possible to eliminate the severe slugging cycle in the experiments by the injection of lift gas. The mechanism is most likely that the lift gas stabilizes the flow in the riser. Experiments were carried out at various conditions and details are given in the report. The experimental results were compared with quasi-static criteria for the boundaries of the slugging regime known from the open literature. Since the theoretical criteria are functions of flowline pressure, hold-up and flow regime, and since no simple correlations exist for these properties where a horizontal flow line is concerned, an Excel model has been built as part of this study that links to Shell s proprietary package for multiphase flow the Shell Flow Correlations. In addition, the system has been modelled in the dynamic multiphase flow simulator OLGA...|$|R
