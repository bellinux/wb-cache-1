5|$|Dreamtime: Concerning the Boundary between Wilderness and Civilization is an anthropological and {{philosophical}} {{study of the}} altered states of consciousness found in shamanism and European witchcraft written by German <b>anthropologist</b> Hans Peter Duerr. First published in 1978 by Syndikat Autoren-und Verlagsgesellschaft under the German title of Traumzeit: Über die Grenze zwischen Wildnis und Zivilisation, it was translated into English by the Hungarian-American <b>anthropologist</b> Felicitas Goodman and published by Basil Blackwell in 1985.|$|E

50|$|The American Anthropological Association (AAA) is an {{organization}} of scholars and practitioners {{in the field of}} anthropology. With 10,000 members, the Arlington, Virginia based association includes archaeologists, cultural <b>anthropologists,</b> biological (or physical) <b>anthropologists,</b> linguistic <b>anthropologists,</b> linguists, medical <b>anthropologists</b> and applied <b>anthropologists</b> in universities and colleges, research institutions, government agencies, museums, corporations and non-profits throughout the world.

50|$|Through 2007 and 2008, debates {{surrounding}} <b>anthropologists</b> and {{the military}} resurfaced {{in response to the}} Pentagon’s Human Terrain System (HTS) project. Following a number of national news articles on the project, <b>anthropologists</b> began to debate the project and related ethical issues. Proponents of the program argued that <b>anthropologists</b> were providing much-needed cultural knowledge about local populations and helping to decrease violence in their areas of operation. Critics, however, argued that HTS <b>anthropologists</b> could not receive informed consent from their research subjects in a war zone and that information provided by <b>anthropologists</b> might put populations in danger.|$|R

50|$|Nevertheless, {{several of}} Talcott Parsons' {{students}} emerged as leading American <b>anthropologists.</b> At the same time, many American <b>anthropologists</b> {{had a high}} regard for the research produced by social <b>anthropologists</b> in the 1940s and 1950s, and found structural-functionalism to provide a very useful model for conducting ethnographic research.|$|R
50|$|A common {{technique}} used by <b>anthropologists</b> is “myth debunking.” In this process, <b>anthropologists</b> present a specific question and conduct {{a study to}} either verify or negate its validity. Research design is actually {{an important part of}} this process, allowing <b>anthropologists</b> to present a specific question and answer it. Being able to hone into such a broad subject specifically while remaining holistic is largely the reason why this technique is popular among <b>anthropologists.</b>|$|R

5|$|Although stem lemuriforms like Djebelemur {{may have}} been {{contemporaneous}} with related toothcombed primates around 50 to 48 mya, the sparse African fossil record suggests toothcomb differentiation occurred around 52 to 40mya according to the French paleoanthropologist Marc Godinot. This would conflict with the molecular clock estimates by evolutionary <b>anthropologist</b> Anne Yoder and others, which predict lemur–lorisoid divergence dating between 61 and 90.8mya.|$|E
5|$|Burney was {{reluctant}} to publish the study {{for fear of being}} labeled a cryptozoologist, but eventually published the results in American <b>Anthropologist.</b> Burney concluded that while the villagers had possibly encountered a Malagasy hippopotamus, it was also possible that the stories were inaccuratea combination of misidentified animals, old folk traditions, and information the villagers had gathered from modern paleontology.|$|E
5|$|Emile Durkheim {{was born}} in Épinal in Lorraine, the son of Mélanie (Isidor) and Moïse Durkheim. He came {{from a long line}} of devout French Jews; his father, grandfather, and {{great-grandfather}} had been rabbis. He began his education in a rabbinical school, but at an early age, he decided not to follow in his family's footsteps and switched schools. Durkheim led a completely secular life. Much of his work was dedicated to demonstrating that religious phenomena stemmed from social rather than divine factors. While Durkheim chose not to follow in the family tradition, he did not sever ties with his family or with the Jewish community. Many of his most prominent collaborators and students were Jewish, and some were blood relations. Marcel Mauss, a notable social <b>anthropologist</b> of the pre-war era, was his nephew. One of his nieces was Claudette (née Raphael) Bloch, a marine biologist and mother of Maurice Bloch, who became a noted <b>anthropologist.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{critique}} by non-anthropologists {{has been}} to question whether <b>anthropologists</b> may speak/write on behalf of cultural others. Margery Wolf states that, “it would be as great a loss to have first-world <b>anthropologists</b> confine their research to the first {{world as it is}} (currently) to have third-world <b>anthropologists</b> confine theirs to the third world”. In the 21st century, the question has been resolved by pointing out that all cultural descriptions are of cultural others. All ethnographic writing is done by a person from one standpoint writing about others living in a different standpoint. Thus, the notion of <b>anthropologists</b> as 'culture brokers' (see Richard Kurin) has been adopted to explain why <b>anthropologists</b> from any given country write about cultural others.|$|R
40|$|<b>Anthropologists</b> in Africa {{used to have}} an {{ambivalent}} {{relationship with}} missionary Christianity and international development work. Being active in the same areas but with different intentions reinforced mutual stereotypes and added to the uneasiness. This seems to be changing now. Christianity has passed its missionary stage and is now an African religion, interesting to study for <b>anthropologists</b> and ‘applied anthropology’ allows <b>anthropologists</b> to make their discipline more meaningful and relevant to today’s world. The involvement of medical <b>anthropologists</b> in health development {{is a case in}} point...|$|R
40|$|In this essay, I {{discuss how}} Niklas Luhmann’s systems theory {{might be useful}} for <b>anthropologists.</b> After {{providing}} a summary of Luhmann’s theory, I address the quandaries <b>anthropologists</b> might face when deploying a theory that presumes systems without selves. I also recount how other <b>anthropologists</b> have made use of Luhmann’s systems theory to analyze auditing, legal pluralism, and biosecurity hazards...|$|R
5|$|Football lore has {{numerous}} legends relating {{when and}} where the bicycle kick was first performed and who created it. According to Brazilian <b>anthropologist</b> Antonio Jorge Soares, the bicycle kick's origin is important only {{as an example of}} how folklore is created. Popular opinion continues to debate its exact origin, particularly in the locations where the manoeuvre was allegedly created (e.g., Brazil, Chile, and Peru). Regardless, the available facts and dates tell a straightforward narrative.|$|E
5|$|Glob's book {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} both Barry Cunliffe in Nature and Ralph M. Rowlett in American <b>Anthropologist.</b> They praised Glob's arguments {{as well as}} his writing style and use of illustrations, alongside Bruce-Mitford's translation. In subsequent decades, it has received both praise and criticism from specialists in the field, who have lauded the publicity which it brought to the subject, but rejected many of Glob's conclusions as being based on insufficient evidence.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, Vedic scholar John Brough from Cambridge University {{rejected}} Wasson's {{theory and}} noted that the language was too vague to determine a description of Soma.

5|$|In December 1945, Red Cloud {{published}} {{an article in the}} Wisconsin Archaeologist, an account from his tribe's traditional stories about the 1832 surrender of Sauk leader Black Hawk to US authorities after the short Black Hawk War.
