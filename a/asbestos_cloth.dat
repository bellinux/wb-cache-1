500|$|Yule {{noted that}} {{although}} {{the description of the}} Roman Constitution and products was garbled, the Book of the Later Han offered an accurate depiction of the coral fisheries in the Mediterranean. Coral was a highly valued luxury item in Han China, imported among other items from India (mostly overland and perhaps also by sea), the latter region being where the Romans sold coral and obtained pearls. The original list of Roman products given in the Book of the Later Han, such as sea silk, glass, amber, cinnabar, and <b>asbestos</b> <b>cloth,</b> is expanded in the Weilüe. The Weilüe also claimed that in 134 AD the ruler of the Shule Kingdom (Kashgar), who had been a hostage at the court of the Kushan Empire, offered blue (or green) gems originating from Haixi as gifts to the Eastern Han court. Fan Ye, the editor of the Book of the Later Han, wrote that former generations of Chinese had never reached these far western regions, but that the report of Gan Ying revealed to the Chinese their lands, customs and products. The Book of the Later Han also asserts that the Parthians (Chinese: 安息; Anxi) wished [...] "to control the trade in multi-coloured Chinese silks" [...] and therefore intentionally blocked the Romans from reaching China.|$|E

50|$|According to the government's {{official}} {{explanation of}} the disaster, the repair crews discovered that the catastrophe had been caused by a faulty welding incident during initial construction. They discovered that during installation of the primary cooling system piping, a welder had failed to cover exposed pipe surfaces with <b>asbestos</b> drop <b>cloths</b> (required to protect piping systems from accidental exposure to welding sparks), due to the cramped working space. A drop from a welding electrode fell on an unprotected surface, producing an invisible crack. This crack was subject to prolonged and intensive pressure (over 200 atmospheres), compromising the pipe's integrity and finally causing it to fail.|$|R

60|$|Shortly {{after we}} had {{finished}} Yva appeared. She was wonderfully quiet and gentle in her manner, calm also, and greeted all of us with much sweetness. Of our experiences during the night she said no word to me, {{even when we were}} alone. One difference I noticed about her, however; that she was clothed in garments such as I had never seen her wear before. They were close fitting, save for a flowing cape, and made of some grey material, not unlike a coarse homespun or even <b>asbestos</b> <b>cloth.</b> Still they became her very well, and when I remarked upon them, all she answered was that part of our road would be rough. Even her feet were shod with high buskins of this grey stuff.|$|E

These wastes consist of cutting oils, lubricants, solvents, PCBs, heavy metals and radioactive contaminants.

To allow disposal, the asbestos must be converted chemically, followed by removing and separating the hazardous and radioactive materials to prevent the formation of mixed wastes and to allow for both sanitary disposal and effective decontamination.

An attempt was made to apply techniques that have already proved successful in the mining, oil, and metals processing industries {{to the development of a}} multi-stage process to remove and separate hazardous chemical radioactive materials from asbestos. This process uses three methods: ABCOV chemicals which converts the asbestos to a sanitary waste; dielectric heating to volatilize the organic materials; and electrochemical processing for the removal of heavy metals, RCRA wastes and radionuclides. This process will result in the destruction of over 99 % of the asbestos; limit radioactive metal contamination to 0. 2 Bq alpha per gram and 1 Bq beta and gamma per gram; reduce hazardous organics to levels compatible with current EPA policy for RCRA delisting; and achieve TCLP limits for all solidified waste...|$|R

5000|$|In 1855 {{one of the}} {{original}} Turner brothers built, in partnership with another, a cotton mill called Clod Mill alongside the river, at Spotland Fold. The firm of Turner Brothers was formed in 1871, and diversified firstly into the manufacture of asbestos packing, then, by 1879, into weaving asbestos yarn and <b>asbestos</b> <b>cloth.</b> It rapidly assumed a national, and later a global, prominence. The Clod Mill site expanded considerably. Later still, the firm manufactured combination products with rubber and asbestos, including clutch and brake linings, leading to the mill complex being described as [...] "Asbestos and India Rubber Works" [...] in 1910. With the growing awareness {{in the third quarter of}} the 20th Century of the health risks of asbestos, and a growing number of asbestosis claims from past and present employees, the company went into decline, and ceased operations on site.

50|$|The {{original}} and highly ineffective insulating layer implemented between the copper sheathing and the iron bars, was an <b>asbestos</b> <b>cloth</b> soaked in shellac. This insulating and isolating system had separated the two metals at one point, but the ingeniously devised system {{had broken down}} and was compromising the structural stability of the many different components. The insulating layer had {{lost much of its}} functional isolating capacity from the exposure to interior condensation, from leakage and possibly from other variable atmospheric effects of the marine environment, and had become a deteriorated sponge-like material, which merely retained the saltwater as a conductive electrolyte. Hastening the decline of the corroded iron, the buildup of corrosive discharge exerted pressure on the riveted copper saddles that had held the iron bars in place. This created buckling and warping, and further caused the rivets to become disjointed. Rainwater would seep into the holes in the copper sheathing which once held the disjointed rivets. Some of the seams and holes were still sealed and coated with a coal tar paint applied in 1911. The streaks of coal tar paint from when it had been applied 74 years earlier, were still visible during the restoration efforts. Black tar streaks from these so-called “weep holes” were running down the exterior of the statue and had altered the patina of the external copper sheathing.|$|E

They select and appoint the most worthy man. If there are unexpected calamities in the kingdom, such as frequent extraordinary winds or rains, he is unceremoniously rejected and replaced. The one who has been dismissed quietly accepts his demotion, and is not angry. The people of this country are all tall and honest. They resemble the people of the Middle Kingdom and that is why this kingdom is called Da Qin 'Great China'. This country produces plenty of gold and silver, of rare and precious things they have luminous jade, 'bright moon pearls,' Haiji rhinoceroses, coral, yellow amber, opaque glass, whitish chalcedony, red cinnabar, green gemstones, goldthread embroideries, rugs woven with gold thread, delicate polychrome silks painted with gold, and <b>asbestos</b> <b>cloth.</b> They also have a fine cloth which some people say is made from the down of 'water sheep,' but which is made, in fact, from the cocoons of wild silkworms. They blend all sorts of fragrances, and by boiling the juice, make a compound perfume. have all the precious and rare things that come from the various foreign kingdoms. They make gold and silver coins. Ten silver coins are worth one gold coin. They trade with Anxi Parthia and Tianzhu India by sea. The profit margin is ten to one. ... The king of this country always wanted to send envoys to Han, but Anxi Parthia, wishing to control the trade in multi-coloured Chinese silks, blocked the route to prevent Romans getting through China." ...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} clarify the {{influence}} of asbestos {{on the health of}} the workers engaged in works in which they use materials made of asbestos, the environmental investigation and their health examination were carried out in a shipyard where such materials have been used increasingly in recent years. The clarified facts and the conclusions thereby were as follows: 1) At the shipbuilding plant, lagging workers and carpenters were engaged in asbestos-handling works. The environmental airs around the lagging workers and carpenters were measured and proved to have 4 and 55. 4 fibres/c㎥ of asbestos in maximum respectively. Carpenters were engaged in works cutting several kinds of noninflammable board and sound proofing board. For the works, large quantity of asbestos dust was generated. It was observed that the lack of experience and knowledge for asbestos-works had delayed the measures to protect the hazards. The need of the establishment of the countermeasures against general dust hazards as well as asbestos dust hazards must be urgently recognized. 2) The asbestos-handling works might influence on other works which were carried out simultaneously in the same new ship under construction. The prevention of asbestos hazards for other workers must be considered. 3) Chest X-ray examination explored that 35. 7 % of lagging workers and 31. 0 % of carpenters had pneumoconiosis. Asbestos bodies were found with high frequency in both groups. The facts supported that they had suffered from the exposure of asbestos substantially. Between the two groups, differences of X-ray findings were observed; irregular small opacities in lagging workers and irregular small opacities as well as compound small opacities in carpenters. They were thought to be due to the differences of kinds of dust inhaled. 4) The countermeasures against the cutting procedure of <b>asbestos</b> <b>cloth</b> and pipe covering in the case of lagging workers, and the dust generated in high density by electric rotary saw in the case of carpenters are the urgent need to be established...|$|E
