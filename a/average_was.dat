40|$|Various {{approaches}} {{for evaluating the}} bioequivalence (BE) of highly variable drugs (CV[*]≥[*] 30 %) have been debated for many years. More recently, the FDA conducted research to evaluate one such approach: scaled <b>average</b> <b>BE.</b> A main objective {{of this study was}} to determine the impact of scaled <b>average</b> <b>BE</b> on study power, and compare it to the method commonly applied currently (<b>average</b> <b>BE).</b> Three-sequence, three period, two treatment partially replicated cross-over BE studies were simulated in S-Plus. <b>Average</b> <b>BE</b> criteria, using 80 – 125 % limits on the 90 % confidence intervals for Cmax and AUC geometric mean ratios, as well as scaled <b>average</b> <b>BE</b> were applied to the results. The percent of studies passing BE was determined under different conditions. Variables tested included within subject variability, point estimate constraint, and different values for σw 0, which is a constant set by the regulatory agency. The simulation results demonstrated higher study power with scaled <b>average</b> <b>BE,</b> compared to <b>average</b> <b>BE,</b> as within subject variability increased. At 60 % CV, study power was more than 90 % for scaled <b>average</b> <b>BE,</b> compared with about 22 % for <b>average</b> <b>BE.</b> A σw 0 value of 0. 25 appears to work best. The results of this research project suggest that scaled <b>average</b> <b>BE,</b> using a partial replicate design, is a good approach for the evaluation of BE of highly variable drugs...|$|R

5|$|During 1885 Somerset {{suffered}} badly {{from their}} lack of a strong bowling attack. Playing six matches, there were a total of 120wickets on offer, but Somerset's bowlers took only 67. Edward Bastard, a slow left-arm orthodox bowler, was the county's leading wicket-taker, claiming 25wickets during his four appearances, {{at an average of}} 15.32. His bowling <b>average</b> <b>was</b> not far below that of George Lohmann, who finished the season as the country's leading wicket taker, with 142wickets from his 24matches. Unfortunately for Somerset, Bastard was only able to play in four of the county's six matches, and of the other bowlers, the best bowling <b>average</b> <b>was</b> the 25.85 managed by Bill Roe, who took only seven wickets. Charles Winter, who took the next highest total of wickets, only managed to claim 15 in his 6appearances. Batting was the strongest aspect of Somerset's play, but the club lacked the strength-in-depth of other county teams. Herbie Hewett, playing his second season of first-class cricket, finished with the highest batting average for the county with 35.28, a respectable average which exceeded a number of England Test batsmen that season. Only four Somerset batsman passed 50runs in an innings– Hewett, Octavius Radcliffe, Bill Roe, and Charles Winter– and only Radcliffe advanced to reach a century during the season.|$|E
