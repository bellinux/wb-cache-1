40|$|A coccidian of {{the genus}} Pseudoklossia Leger and Duboscq, 1915 (Apicomplexa) occurs in the kidneys of <b>abalone,</b> <b>Haliotis</b> <b>spp.</b> (Mollusca), {{throughout}} waters off California. Parasites are often numerous in renal tissues, and developmental stages include oocysts, macrogametes, microgametocytes, and meronts. Renal coccidian infections occur in uninfected abalone after exposure to water occupied previously by infected animals. The life cycle of this parasite appears to be monoxenous and the coccidian evokes no host inflammatory response. We term this coccidian Pseudoklossia haliotis sp. n. and describe the morphologic characteristics of the endogenous stages and oocysts.

The robustness of the fishery {{can be attributed to}} low fish-ing mortality (F around 0. 1) and a relatively high minimum length of capture (120 mm). Exploitation models showed that egg production was at least 50 % that of unfished stocks. The analyses also showed that egg production was sensitive to variation in the growth parameters; fast-growing populations were more vulnerable to recruitment overfish-ing than slow-growing populations. For slow-growing populations, yields could be considerably increased without endangering recruitment. It is suggested, from the available evidence, that overfishing has been overemphasized in the collapse of abalone fisheries. Manuscript accepted 18 December 1991. Fishery Bulletin, U.

40|$|There is {{increasing}} interest in privatizing natural resource systems to promote sustainability and conservation goals. Though economic theory suggests owners {{of private property}} rights {{have an incentive to}} act as resource stewards, few studies have tested this empirically. This paper asks whether private rights-owners were more conservative with respect to their management opinions than nonrights-owners in five Australian <b>abalone</b> (<b>Haliotis</b> <b>spp.)</b> fisheries. Multiple regression analyses were used to link opinions to demographic, economic, and attitudinal variables. In contrast to standard economic assumptions, nonrights-owners suggested more conservative catch limits than did rights-owners, confirming qualitative observations of behavior in management workshops. Differing views about the condition of the resource and differing levels of experience contributed to these results. The first of its kind, this study directly demonstrates that private rights do not necessarily promote the greatest level of stewardship.

40|$|Proteins {{harboring}} a zona pellucida (ZP) domain {{are prominent}} components of vertebrate egg coats. Although less well characterized, the egg coat of the non-vertebrate marine gastropod <b>abalone</b> (<b>Haliotis</b> <b>spp.)</b> {{is also known}} to contain a ZP domain protein, raising {{the possibility of a}} common molecular basis of metazoan egg coat structures. Egg coat proteins from vertebrate as well as non-vertebrate taxa have been shown to evolve under positive selection. Studied most extensively in the abalone system, coevolution between adaptively diverging egg coat and sperm proteins may contribute to the rapid development of reproductive isolation. Thus, identifying the pattern of evolution among egg coat proteins is important in understanding the role these genes may play in the speciation process. The {{purpose of the present study}} is to characterize the constituent proteins of the egg coat [vitelline envelope (VE) ] of abalone eggs and to provide preliminary evidence regarding how selection has acted on VE proteins during abalone evolution. A proteomic approach is used to match tandem mass spectra of peptides from purified VE proteins with abalone ovary EST sequences, identifying 9 of 10 ZP domain proteins as components of the VE. Maximum likelihood models of codon evolution suggest positive selection has acted among a subset of amino acids for 6 of these genes. This work provides further evidence of the prominence of ZP proteins as constituents of the egg coat, as well as the prominent role of positive selection in diversification of these reproductive proteins...|$|E
40|$|Sperm and egg {{proteins}} {{constitute a}} remarkable paradigm in evolutionary biology: despite their fundamental role in mediating fertilization (suggesting stasis), {{some of these}} molecules {{are among the most}} rapidly evolving ones known, and their divergence can lead to reproductive isolation. Because of strong selection to maintain function among interbreeding individuals, interacting fertilization proteins should also exhibit a strong signal of correlated divergence among closely related species. We use evidence of such molecular co-evolution to target biochemical studies of fertilization in North Pacific <b>abalone</b> (<b>Haliotis</b> <b>spp.),</b> a model system of reproductive protein evolution. We test the evolutionary rates (d(N) /d(S)) of abalone sperm lysin and two duplicated egg coat proteins (VERL and VEZP 14), and find a signal of co-evolution specific to ZP-N, a putative sperm binding motif previously identified by homology modeling. Positively selected residues in VERL and VEZP 14 occur on the same face of the structural model, suggesting a common mode of interaction with sperm lysin. We test this computational prediction biochemically, confirming that the ZP-N motif is sufficient to bind lysin and that the affinities of VERL and VEZP 14 are comparable. However, we also find that on phylogenetic lineages where lysin and VERL evolve rapidly, VEZP 14 evolves slowly, and vice versa. We describe a model of sexual conflict that can recreate this pattern of anti-correlated evolution by assuming that VEZP 14 acts as a VERL mimic, reducing the intensity of sexual conflict and slowing the co-evolution of lysin and VERL...|$|E
40|$|Identifying {{fertilization}} molecules {{is key to}} {{our understanding}} of reproductive biology, yet only a few examples of interacting sperm and egg proteins are known. One of the best characterized comes from the invertebrate archeogastropod <b>abalone</b> (<b>Haliotis</b> <b>spp.),</b> where sperm lysin mediates passage through the protective egg vitelline envelope (VE) by binding to the VE protein vitelline envelope receptor for lysin (VERL). Rapid adaptive divergence of abalone lysin and VERL are an example of positive selection on interacting fertilization proteins contributing to reproductive isolation. Previously, we characterized a subset of the abalone VE proteins that share a structural feature, the zona pellucida (ZP) domain, which is common to VERL and the egg envelopes of vertebrates. Here, we use additional expressed sequence tag sequencing and shotgun proteomics to characterize this family of proteins in the abalone egg VE. We expand 3 -fold the number of known ZP domain proteins present within the VE (now 30 in total) and identify a paralog of VERL (vitelline envelope zona pellucida domain protein [VEZP] 14) that contains a putative lysin-binding motif. We find that, like VERL, the divergence of VEZP 14 among abalone species is driven by positive selection on the lysin-binding motif alone and that these paralogous egg VE proteins bind a similar set of sperm proteins including a rapidly evolving 18 -kDa paralog of lysin, which may mediate sperm–egg fusion. This work identifies an egg coat paralog of VERL under positive selection and the candidate sperm proteins with which it may interact during abalone fertilization...|$|E

Additionally, this relationship was studied in a vertebrate organism using the freshwater fish Silver perch (Bidyanus bidyanus). Telomere length differences between tissues were also examined in some species such as Saccostrea glomerata, Sagmariasus verreauxi and Bidyanus bidyanus. In some cases cultured specimens of known age were used and this is quoted in the spreadsheets. For other wild-caught specimens where age was not known, size was used as a proxy for age. This may be a broad size class, or be determined by shell size or carapace length depending on the organism. Each spreadsheet contains raw data of telomere length estimates from Terminal Restriction Fragment Assays (TRF) for various individuals of each species including appropriate details such as age or size and tissue. Telomere length estimates are given in base pairs (bp). In most cases replicate experiments were conducted on groups of samples three times but on a small number of occasions only two replicate experiments were conducted. Further description of the samples can be found in final report of FRDC 2007 / 033. The arithmetic average for each individual (sample ID) across the two or three replicate experiments is also given. Bidyanus bidyanus (SilverPerch) Two sheets are contained within. a) Comparison of telomere length between different tissues (heart, liver and muscle) within the three year old age class - two replicate experiments were conducted. b) Comparison of telomere length between fish of different but known ages (0. 25, 1, 2, and 3 years old) in each of three tissues, heart, liver and muscle – three replicate experiments were conducted per tissue. Haliotis spp (Abalone species) Three species were tested. H. asinina Telomere length was compared in two age classes- 11 month and 18 month old abalone using muscle tissue from the foot. Within gel-variation was also estimated using a single sample run three times on one gel (replicate experiment). H. laevigata x H. rubra hybrids Telomere length was compared in three known age classes – two, three and four years old using muscle tissue from the foot. H. rubra Telomere length was compared in a range of different sized abalone using muscle tissue from the foot. Shell size is also given for each abalone Saccostrea glomerata Three sheets are contained within the file. a) Samples came from Moreton Bay Queensland in 2007. Telomere length was compared in two tissues (gill and mantle) of oysters in three age groups (1, 3 and 4 years) b) Samples came from Moreton Bay Queensland in 2009. Telomere length was compared in three age classes using DNA from gill tissue only c) Samples came from Wallis Lake, New South Wales. Telomere length was estimated from whole body minus the shell from 1 year old oysters, gill tissue of 3 age classes (1. 5 years, 3 and 4 years), mantle tissue of two age classes (3 and 4 years). Sagmariasus verreauxi (formerly Jasus verreauxi) Telomere length was estimated from abdomen tissue of puerulus, gill and muscle tissue of 3 year old, large and very large size classes of lobsters. Jasus edwardsii Telomere length was measured in two size classes of lobsters- adults of varying sizes using muscle tissue and puerulus using tissues from the abdomen minus the exoskeleton.

40|$|<b>Abalone</b> (<b>Haliotis</b> <b>spp.)</b> are marine {{broadcast}} spawners that inhabit temperate {{and tropical}} waters across the globe. Their importance as a fisheries resource {{has resulted in}} considerable research into key aspects of their biology, particularly around growth and reproduction. In addition, there has been ongoing interest regarding the genetic variation in both wild and hatchery populations. The majority of abalone dispersal probably occurs during a pelagic lecithotrophic larval stage. In general, oceanographic features, life history characteristics, and larval dispersal ability can manipulate dispersal and gene flow patterns of marine fauna. In the case of abalone, considerable research has examined the population genetic structure {{of a variety of}} species, and several papers implicate ocean currents and life history characteristics as important factors that define population genetic structure. In comparison to other abalone species, little information regarding the genetic structure of New Zealand's endemic H. iris exists. The goal of this thesis was to elucidate the genetic structure of H. iris using mitochondrial and nuclear markers in regards to two potential barriers to gene flow, the Cook Strait region and the gamete recognition protein, lysin. The genetic structure of H. iris was first examined in regards to a consistent pattern of genetic structure emerging in recent literature of coastal marine invertebrates around New Zealand: specifically, a north-south genetic split that occurs in the Cook Strait region (Chapter 2). Two regions of the mitochondria (totaling 1055 bp) were amplified across 477 individuals from 25 locations around New Zealand. A north-south split around the Cook Strait region was evident among H. iris samples. Unlike the other studies of New Zealand coastal marine invertebrates, the north-south split for H. iris was not located across regions of reported upwelling; instead the split was located across Cook Strait narrows. The north-south split was reflected in increased haplotype diversity for the northern samples. Genetic structure was also examined using microsatellite loci. After unsuccessful attempts at cross-species amplification using 8 loci developed for H. rubra and 11 loci developed for H. midae, 13 polymorphic loci were isolated de novo for H. iris (Chapter 3). Of these, three very polymorphic loci were optimized for population genetic analyses. These three loci were used to genotype 447 – 459 individuals from the same 25 locations examined with mitochondrial DNA (Chapter 4). Like the mitochondrial DNA, the microsattelites indicated population genetic structure around the Cook Strait region; however the split identified with microsatellites occurred in the greater Cook Strait region with two sample sites from the north of the South Island grouping with the North Island. Extrinsic barriers, like the Cook Strait region, are the primary focus of studies examining differentiation in marine invertebrate fauna. However, dispersal of an individual to a new population does not necessarily mean it can successfully reproduce with individuals of the new population. Potentially, populations may be diverging at genes essential for reproduction, i. e. gamete recognition proteins. The abalone egg recognition protein, lysin, {{is one of the best}} characterized gamete recognition proteins in marine broadcast spawners. Despite its well-understood function and structure, studies examining variation in lysin have been limited to small sample sizes (N ≤ 11) and have found very little variation. Here, lysin was screened across 287 individuals from 17 sampling sites around New Zealand to assess intraspecific variation and genetic structure across the Cook Strait region (Chapter 5). The majority of the variation in a 783 bp fragment spanning from exon 4 to 5, was located in the intron. The variability in this fragment detected no genetic structure among samples or across the Cook Strait region. The variation in lysin was considerably lower than the variation in either the mitochondrial DNA or the microsatellite loci. To determine whether this was an artifact of being a nuclear sequence, which, in general, have a lower mutation rates than microsatellite markers and mitochondrial DNA and a larger effective population size then mitochondrial DNA, or was a signature of a recent selective sweep, 857 bp of the Gα 1 intron was assessed for genetic variation in 227 H. iris individuals from 14 sampling locations (Chapter 6). The Gα 1 intron was considerably more diverse than the lysin fragment examined, suggesting that the relative lack of variation in the lysin fragment has resulted from a recent selective sweep. Additionally, the Gα 1 intron was used to examine population genetic structure across the Cook Strait region and detected a weak but significant pattern of structure consistent with that detected using the microsatellite loci. Overall, the a priori tests of genetic structure based on mitochondrial DNA, microsatellite markers, and the across Gα 1 intron all identified a north-south genetic split around the Cook Strait region; however, the patterns of this split was slightly inconsistent among molecular markers. When cluster analyses were applied the patterns of genetic structure became more similar: for the mitochondrial, microsatellite, and Gα 1 intron data, cluster analyses indicate that only one sample from the north of the South Island groups with the North Island, while a few discrepancies existed in regards the grouping of samples from the east coast of the North Island...|$|E
