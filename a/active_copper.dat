Two field plots at each site were exposed to differing preservative chemistries via in-ground installations of treated wood stakes for approximately 50 years. The {{purpose of this study}} is to characterize soil fungal species and to determine if long term exposure to various wood preservatives impacts soil fungal community composition. Soil fungal communities were compared using amplicon-based DNA sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS 1) region of the rDNA array. Data show that soil fungal community composition differs significantly between the two sites and that long-term exposure to different preservative chemistries is correlated with different species composition of soil fungi. However, chemical analyses using ICP-OES found levels of select residual preservative <b>actives</b> (<b>copper,</b> chromium and arsenic) to be similar to naturally occurring levels in unexposed areas. A list of indicator species was compiled for each treatment-site combination; functional guild analyses indicate that long-term exposure to wood preservatives may have both detrimental and stimulatory effects on soil fungal species composition. Fungi with demonstrated capacity to degrade industrial pollutants were found to be highly correlated with areas that experienced long-term exposure to preservative testing...|$|R

Hard rock silver mining began in 1874, then rich copper veins were discovered in 1882. The district quickly switched from silver to copper, and by 1887, Butte was the leading copper-producing district in the United States. The Anaconda Copper Mine was the world's most productive copper mine from 1892 through 1903, and intermittently for years thereafter. [...] Open-pit mining began at the Berkeley Pit in 1955; the Berkeley Pit has been inactive for years, and continues to fill with acidic water. Through 1964, Butte produced 7.3 million tonnes of copper, 2.2 million tonnes of zinc, 1.7 million tonnes of manganese, 380 thousand tonnes of lead, 645 million troy ounces of silver, and 2.5 million ounces of gold.

40|$|Since {{the first}} report in 2012, {{molecular}} copper complexes have been proposed as efficient electrocatalysts for water oxidation reactions, carried out in alkaline/neutral aqueous media.

Therefore, the question whether copper catalysis is molecular or not is particularly relevant in the field of water oxidation.

In an alkaline aqueous solution, and upon application of an anodic bias to working electrodes, an <b>active</b> <b>copper</b> oxide layer is observed to electrodeposit at the electrode surface.

40|$|The Rieke {{method of}} metal {{activation}} has been employed to generate {{new forms of}} highly reactive copper {{which can be used}} to form organocopper reagents directly from the corresponding organic halides. ^ The low temperature reduction of CuI·PR 3 and CuCN·nLiX complexes with lithium naphthalenide resulted in the formation of highly reactive copper species which underwent oxidative addition to a variety of functionalized alkyl bromides, aryl bromides, and aryl iodides to form the corresponding organocopper reagents. These organocopper reagents reacted with a variety of electrophiles conducive to cuprate chemistry. The development of CuCN·nLiX-based <b>active</b> <b>copper</b> has allowed for facile separation of products, free from phosphine contamination. ^ The <b>active</b> <b>copper</b> derived from CuCN·nLiX complexes also reacted with allyl chlorides to form allyl copper reagents directly without significant homocoupling.
