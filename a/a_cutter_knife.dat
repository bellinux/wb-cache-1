50|$|Amman {{was born}} in Zürich, {{the son of a}} {{professor}} of Classics and Logic. He was himself well-educated. Little of his personal history is known beyond the fact that he moved to Nuremberg in 1560, where took on citizenship and continued to reside until his death in March 1591. He worked initially with Virgil Solis, then a leading producer of book illustrations. His productivity was very remarkable, as may be gathered from the statement of one of his pupils, who said that the drawings he made during a period of four years would have filled a hay wagon. A large number of his original drawings are in the Berlin print room. About 1,500 prints are attributed to him. He {{was one of the last}} major producers of woodcuts for books, as during his career engravings were gradually taking over that role. Although like most woodcut artists, he normally let a specialist formschneider cut the block to his drawing, he occasionally included both <b>a</b> <b>cutter's</b> <b>knife</b> and <b>a</b> quill pen in his signature on prints, suggesting he sometimes cut his own blocks.|$|R

50|$|Traditionally, canapés {{are built}} on stale bread (although other foods {{may be used as}} a base), cut in thin slices and then shaped with <b>a</b> <b>cutter</b> or <b>knife.</b> Shapes might include circles, rings, squares, strips or triangles. These pieces of bread are then {{prepared}} by deep frying, sautéing, or toasting. The foods are sometimes highly processed and decoratively applied (e.g., piped) to the base with a pastry bag. Decorative garnishes are then applied. The canapés are usually served on a canapé salver and eaten from small canapé plates. The technical composition of a canapé consists of a base (e.g., the bread or pancake), a spread, a main item, and a garnish. The spread is traditionally either a compound butter or a flavored cream cheese. Common garnishes can range from finely chopped vegetables, scallions, and herbs to caviar or truffle oil.|$|R

50|$|A wood moulder is {{a machine}} used to shape wood with {{profiled}} cutters. The profiled cutters are {{also known as}} knives, and blades. Tooling refers to <b>cutters,</b> <b>knives,</b> blades including planer blades, and cutterheads.

50|$|In baseball, <b>a</b> <b>cutter,</b> or cut fastball, {{is a type}} of fastball which breaks {{slightly}} {{toward the}} pitcher's glove side as it reaches home plate. This pitch is somewhere between a slider and a fastball, as it is usually thrown faster than a slider but with more motion than a typical fastball. Some pitchers use <b>a</b> <b>cutter</b> as <b>a</b> way to prevent hitters from expecting their regular fastballs. A common technique used to throw <b>a</b> <b>cutter</b> is to use a four-seam fastball grip with the baseball set slightly off center in the hand. When a batter is able to hit <b>a</b> <b>cutter</b> pitch, it often results in soft contact and an easy out, due to the pitch's movement keeping the ball away from the bat's sweet spot. The cutter is typically 2-5 mph slower than a pitcher's four-seam fastball. In 2010, the average pitch classified as <b>a</b> <b>cutter</b> by PITCHf/x thrown by a right-handed pitcher was 88.6 mph; the average four-seamer was 92.1 mph.|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Wood mouldings are long, narrow pieces of timber with ornamental profiles fonned on one or more faces. They are used in furniture, architecture and joinery industries and typical applications include door/window frames, skirting boards and picture frames. Conventionally, wood mouldings are produced by planing/moulding machines, where cutting edges, attached to rotating cutterheads, sever chips from advancing workpieces. The cutting edges are shaped specifically for each individual moulding profile; hence, the raw material is transfonned into the finished product with a single feed. When the production is to be changed from one profile to another, the conventional machines requite new <b>cutter</b> <b>knives</b> that are manufactured for the profile to be machined. This requitement introduces tooling and machine set-up costs which cannot be compensated in shorter production runs. In order to minimize the aforementioned costs in short production runs, this thesis aims at the holistic development of Profile Independent Wood-Moulding Machine (pIMM). In the PIMM concept, the profIle geometry is supplied directly from CAD drawings, and the profile-specific <b>cutter</b> <b>knives</b> of the conventional process are emulated by position control of a single cutting tool along software generated trajectories. This thesis approaches the PIMM from an integrated mechatronic design perspective. Alternative solutions for mechanical, electrical and software components of the system were generated and evaluated via mathematical modelling and simulation. Then, the selected solutions were realized in a proof-of concept PIMM system, {{and the effectiveness of}} the proposed method has been investigated through machining experiments. Overall, this research proposes a new machining method and demonstrates an integrated design process that initiates from an idea and results in a fully functional, physical mechatronic system; via efficient use of software, simulation and rapid prototyping technologies...|$|R
