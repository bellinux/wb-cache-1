50|$|The term formal {{standard}} refers specifically to a specification {{that has been}} approved by a standards setting organization. The term de jure standard refers to a standard mandated by legal requirements or refers generally to <b>any</b> formal <b>standard.</b> In contrast, the term de facto standard refers to a specification (or protocol or technology) that has achieved widespread use and acceptance - often without being approved by <b>any</b> <b>standards</b> organization (or receiving such approval only after it already has achieved widespread use). Examples of de facto standards that were not approved by <b>any</b> <b>standards</b> organizations (or at least not approved until after they were in widespread de facto use) include the Hayes command set developed by Hayes, Apple's TrueType font design and the PCL protocol used by Hewlett-Packard in the computer printers they produced.|$|R

In the 1970s and 1980s, software source code was occasionally encoded in a barcode and printed on paper (Cauzin Softstrip and Paperbyte are barcode symbologies specifically designed for this application), and the 1991 Barcode Battler computer game system used <b>any</b> <b>standard</b> barcode to generate combat statistics.|$|E

25|$|The {{terrorist}} acts perpetrated against innocent civilians by {{individuals and groups}} under the guise to liberate Oromia were abominable crimes and should be condemned in the strongest possible terms.

25|$|The South West (SW) {{division}} franchise was {{won by the}} Stagecoach Group and was operated as South West Trains (SWT). SWT did not inherit <b>any</b> <b>standard</b> 4 Cep units, but it did {{operate the}} seven 4 Bep units. However, in 1996, a shortage of trains led to SWT hiring two sets (nos. 1568 and 1589) on a short-term lease. These units were quickly followed by more, until by 1998, SWT had a fleet of 29 standard 4 Cep units. These were gradually overhauled, and were employed {{on a range of}} duties, including services to Portsmouth, Reading, Southampton, Bournemouth and Weymouth. Additionally, units commonly worked services on the Lymington branch.|$|E
25|$|OSPF uses path cost as {{its basic}} routing metric, which {{was defined by}} the {{standard}} not to equate to <b>any</b> <b>standard</b> value such as speed, so the network designer could pick a metric important to the design. In practice, it {{is determined by the}} speed (bandwidth) of the interface addressing the given route, although that tends to need network-specific scaling factors now that links faster than 25 Mbit/s are common. Cisco uses a metric like 108/bandwidth (the reference value, 108 by default, can be adjusted). So, a 100Mbit/s link will have a cost of 1, a 10Mbit/s a cost of 10 and so on. But for links faster than 100Mbit/s, the cost would be <1.|$|E

25|$|The {{marriage}} between Clare and Henry was difficult. Henry was by <b>any</b> <b>standard</b> extremely successful, but his physical awkwardness, lack of humor, and newsman's discomfort with any conversation {{that was not}} strictly factual put him in awe of his beautiful wife's social poise, wit, and fertile imagination. Clare's years as managing editor of Vanity Fair left her with an avid interest in journalism (she suggested the idea of Life magazine to her husband before it was developed internally). Henry himself was generous in encouraging her to write for Life, {{but the question of}} how much coverage she should be accorded in Time, as she grew more famous, was always a careful balancing act for Henry since {{he did not want to}} be accused of nepotism.|$|E
25|$|Suppose V is a {{model of}} ZFC. Either V {{contains}} no strong inaccessible or, taking κ to be the smallest strong inaccessible in V, Vκ is a standard model of ZFC which contains no strong inaccessibles. Thus, the consistency of ZFC implies consistency of ZFC+"there are no strong inaccessibles". Similarly, either V contains no weak inaccessible or, taking κ to be the smallest ordinal which is weakly inaccessible relative to <b>any</b> <b>standard</b> sub-model of V, then Lκ is a standard model of ZFC which contains no weak inaccessibles. So consistency of ZFC implies consistency of ZFC+"there are no weak inaccessibles". This shows that ZFC cannot prove the existence of an inaccessible cardinal, so ZFC is consistent with the non-existence of any inaccessible cardinals.|$|E
