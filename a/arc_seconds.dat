5|$|The {{orientation}} of Earth's axis and equator are not fixed in space, but rotate about the poles of the ecliptic with {{a period of}} about 26,000 years, a process known as lunisolar precession, as it is due mostly to the gravitational effect of the Moon and Sun on Earth's equatorial bulge. Likewise, the ecliptic itself is not fixed. The gravitational perturbations of the other bodies of the Solar System cause a much smaller motion of the plane of Earth's orbit, and hence of the ecliptic, known as planetary precession. The combined action of these two motions is called general precession, and changes the position of the equinoxes by about 50 <b>arc</b> <b>seconds</b> (about 0.014°) per year.|$|E
5|$|According {{to general}} relativity, light does not travel along {{straight}} lines when it propagates in a gravitational field. Instead, it is deflected {{in the presence}} of massive bodies. In particular, starlight is deflected as it passes near the Sun, leading to apparent shifts of up 1.75 <b>arc</b> <b>seconds</b> in the stars' positions in the sky (an arc second is equal to 1/3600 of a degree). In the framework of Newtonian gravity, a heuristic argument can be made that leads to light deflection by half that amount. The different predictions can be tested by observing stars that are close to the Sun during a solar eclipse. In this way, a British expedition to West Africa in 1919, directed by Arthur Eddington, confirmed that Einstein's prediction was correct, and the Newtonian predictions wrong, via observation of the May 1919 eclipse. Eddington's results were not very accurate; subsequent observations of the deflection of the light of distant quasars by the Sun, which utilize highly accurate techniques of radio astronomy, have confirmed Eddington's results with significantly better precision (the first such measurements date from 1967, the most recent comprehensive analysis from 2004).|$|E

25|$|Stereoscopic acuity is {{the ability}} to detect {{differences}} in depth with the two eyes. For more complex targets, stereoacuity is similar to normal monocular visual acuity, or around 0.6–1.0 arc minutes, but for much simpler targets, such as vertical rods, may be as low as only 2 <b>arc</b> <b>seconds.</b> Although stereoacuity normally corresponds very well with monocular acuity, it may be very poor, or absent, even in subjects with normal monocular acuities.

25|$|Despite the minuteness of {{the spatial}} terms, the first {{indications}} {{that something was}} wrong with Newtonian gravitation were discovered over a century-and-a-half ago. In 1859, Urbain Le Verrier, in an analysis of available timed observations of transits of Mercury over the Sun's disk from 1697 to 1848, reported that known physics could not explain the orbit of Mercury, unless there possibly existed a planet or asteroid belt within the orbit of Mercury. The perihelion of Mercury's orbit exhibited an excess rate of precession over that which could be explained by the tugs of the other planets. The ability to detect and accurately measure the minute value of this anomalous precession (only 43 <b>arc</b> <b>seconds</b> per tropical century) is testimony to the sophistication of 19th century astrometry.|$|E

The angular diameter of Jupiter likewise varies from 50.1 to 29.8 <b>arc</b> <b>seconds.</b> Favorable oppositions occur when Jupiter is passing through perihelion, an event that occurs once per orbit.|$|E
40|$|The ASTER GDEM {{purports to}} be the highest {{resolution}} global digital elevation model, with 30 m spacings (actually 1 <b>arc</b> <b>second).</b> We have compared the GDEM with SRTM 3 <b>arc</b> <b>second</b> data for 52 locations in Europe and North America, using NextMap IFSAR DSM and DTM pairs for absolute calibration. In addition, for the 6 North American sites we have also compared the GDEM with NED and CDED cartographic DEMs, and with SRTM 1 second data. For each European site we have 4 DEMs to compare, and in North America we have up to 7 DEMs because for some area we have three resolutions of NED. For each test area we computed the elevation and slope distributions, {{as well as other}} geomorphometric parameters, which allows us to compare GDEM to similar resolution SRTM and NED or CDED, as well as higher resolution NED and NextMap data. For a descriptive comparison, we looked at shaded reflectance maps, which generally provide a better depiction of the terrain than simple elevation maps, {{and at the same time}} highlight quality issues in the DEM, and we created topographic profiles using all the DEMs for each area. At its best, we found that GDEM is essentially equivalent to SRTM 3 second data, and that like SRTM 1 <b>arc</b> <b>second,</b> the 30 m spacing claimed for GDEM does not match 30 m or 1 second cartographic DEMs but closely approximates 3 <b>arc</b> <b>second</b> cartographic DEMs at 9 times the storage cost. Much of GDEM, perhaps up to 20 % of the data tiles, has data anomalies that degrade its use for most applications, and we suggest using SRTM preferentially. The challenge for global DEMs continues to be creation of a consistent DEM with complete coverage and no data anomalies, but a free, global DEM with 2 - 3 <b>arc</b> <b>second</b> resolution should be achievable with careful processing of SRTM and GDEM, perhaps in tandem. 1...|$|R
40|$|A {{charge coupled device}} (CCD) {{camera on}} an optical {{telescope}} which follows the stars {{can be used to}} provide high accuracy comparisons between the line of sight to a satellite, over a large range of satellite altitudes, and lines of sight to nearby stars. The CCD camera can be rotated so the motion of the satellite is down columns of the CCD chip, and charge can be moved from row to row of the chip at a rate which matches the motion of the optical image of the satellite across the chip. Measurement of satellite and star images, together with accurate timing of charge motion, provides accurate comparisons of lines of sight. Given lines of sight to stars near the satellite, the satellite line of sight may be determined. Initial experiments with this technique, using an 18 cm telescope, have produced TDRS- 4 observations which have an rms error of 0. 5 <b>arc</b> <b>second,</b> 100 m at synchronous altitude. Use of a mosaic of CCD chips, each having its own rate of charge motion, in the focal place of a telescope would allow point images of a geosynchronous satellite and of stars to be formed simultaneously in the same telescope. The line of sight of such a satellite could be measured relative to nearby star lines of sight with an accuracy of approximately 0. 03 <b>arc</b> <b>second.</b> Development of a star catalog with 0. 04 <b>arc</b> <b>second</b> rms accuracy and perhaps ten stars per square degree would allow determination of satellite lines of sight with 0. 05 <b>arc</b> <b>second</b> rms absolute accuracy, corresponding to 10 m at synchronous altitude.

500|$|Kepler {{had found}} that the {{distance}} between the planets increased in proportion to their distance from the Sun, and this led him to assume that the universe was created with a divine harmony, and that the size of the planets would increase in the same way. He had written in 1618, [...] "Nothing is more in concord with nature than that the order of magnitude should be the same as the order of the spheres". When Horrocks's measurements of Venus, coupled with some erroneous measurements by Kepler and Gassendi, seemed to confirm this, Horrocks tentatively proposed a law which stated that all planets (with the exception of Mars) would be the same angular size when viewed from the Sun, this being 28 <b>arc</b> <b>seconds.</b> This meant that the assumption Kepler had made about the sizes of the planets held true, and led Horrocks to the false conclusion that the distance between each planet and the Sun was about 15,000 times its radius. Thus he estimated the average distance from the Earth to the Sun to be approximately 60 million miles (97 million km), suggesting that the Solar System was ten times larger than traditionally believed. His figure was much lower than the 93million miles (150million km) that the Astronomical Unit is known to be today, but, despite being based on a false premise, was more accurate than any suggested up to that time.|$|E
