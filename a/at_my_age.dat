500|$|While {{playing the}} {{juvenile}} lead in Bird in Hand at the Royalty Theatre in June 1928, Olivier began {{a relationship with}} Jill Esmond, {{the daughter of the}} actors Henry V. Esmond and Eva Moore. Olivier later recounted that he thought [...] "she would most certainly do excellent well for a wife... I wasn't likely to do any better <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>age</b> and with my undistinguished track-record, so I promptly fell in love with her." ...|$|E
500|$|In the 1980s Gielgud {{appeared}} {{in more than}} twenty films. Morley singles out as noteworthy The Elephant Man (1980), {{as the chairman of}} the Royal London Hospital, Chariots of Fire (1981), as the Master of Trinity College, Cambridge, Gandhi (1982), as Lord Irwin (the latter two winning Academy Awards as Best Picture), The Shooting Party (1984) and Plenty (1985), directed by David Lynch, Hugh Hudson, Richard Attenborough, Alan Bridges and Fred Schepisi respectively. Tony Palmer's Wagner (1983) was the only film in which Gielgud, Richardson, and Olivier played scenes together. Gielgud made cameo appearances in films of little merit, lending distinction while not damaging his own reputation. He told an interviewer, [...] "They pay me very well for two or three days' work a month, so why not? It's nice <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>age</b> to be able to travel all over the world at other people's expense." ...|$|E
500|$|Some {{have been}} linked to his caustic {{criticism}} of George W. Bush's administration. [...] For instance, his frustration over the slow federal response to Hurricane Katrina led him to compare, at a Congressional Black Caucus town meeting in September 2005, Bush to Bull Connor, a 1960s symbol of white opposition to the civil rights movement, stating: [...] "George Bush is our Bull Connor." [...] He said a few days later that both figures had become focal points for American blacks to rally against. His first remark led to a public exchange with Vice President Dick Cheney, who said, [...] "I'm frankly surprised at his comments. It almost struck me — they were so out of line, it almost struck me that there was some — Charlie was having some problem. Charlie is losing it, I guess." [...] Rangel responded by saying, [...] "The fact that he would make a crack <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>age,</b> he ought to be ashamed of himself ... He should look so good at seventy-five." ...|$|E
60|$|MARTHA--[Gently.] It must be now--or not <b>at</b> all--at <b>my</b> <b>age,</b> dear. [Then after a pause--staring at him frightenedly--sadly.] You have changed, Curt. I {{remember}} {{it used to}} be your happiness to sacrifice yourself for me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Life is too {{precious}} {{to be trusted}} to uncertainties. I leave you, Peyton, unknown to all but Caesar, and I recommend him to your mercy. But there is a care that weighs me to the earth. Look <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>aged</b> and infirm parent. He will be reproached for the supposed crime of his son. Look at those helpless sisters that I leave behind me without a protector. Prove {{to me that you}} love us all. Let the clergyman whom you will bring with you, unite you this night to Frances, and become at once, brother, son, and husband." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{has long}} worked upon the place, sir," [...] insisted Mr. Gottesheim; [...] "and <b>at</b> <b>my</b> great <b>age,</b> for I am seventy-eight come harvest, {{it would be}} a {{troublesome}} thought to the proprietor how to fill my shoes. It would be a care spared to assure yourself of Fritz. And I believe he might be tempted by a permanency." ...|$|R
500|$|When portraying Ellie, Johnson faced {{challenges}} in performing scenes {{that made her}} feel uncomfortable. [...] "There were some days when we would shoot things that even <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>age</b> made me feel a little uncomfortable," [...] Johnson described. Johnson feels that video games rarely feature strong female characters such as Ellie, and expressed her excitement to portray the role for this reason. When questioned about the inspiration for Ellie as a gameplay feature, Druckmann recalled when he and Straley were brainstorming ideas for Uncharted 2: Among Thieves and created a mute character who would summon the player to follow them, creating a [...] "beautiful" [...] relationship through gameplay alone. Though this concept was never {{included in the final}} game, the idea was raised when the team were discussing a new project, ultimately inspiring Ellie. Druckmann also felt inspired by the wars that took place in Syria and Afghanistan when creating Ellie; he felt that conflict was a familiarity to the children in those countries, which is similar to Ellie's view.|$|E
2500|$|... "I am lost to art and life. Yet, {{when all}} is said and done, have I not <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>age</b> tasted more of life than most women who live to be a hundred? It is fair, then, that I should go where old people go." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lee {{released}} a third EP of covers in May 2014, {{to celebrate his}} 92nd birthday, called Metal Knight, {{in addition to a}} cover of [...] "My Way", it contains [...] "The Toreador March", inspired by the opera Carmen, and the songs [...] "The Impossible Dream" [...] and [...] "I Don Quixote" [...] from the Don Quixote musical Man of La Mancha. Lee was inspired to record the latter songs because, [...] "as far as I am concerned, Don Quixote is the most metal fictional character that I know". His fourth EP and third annual Christmas release came in December 2014, as he put out [...] "Darkest Carols, Faithful Sing", a playful take on [...] "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing". He explained: [...] "It's light-hearted, joyful and fun... <b>At</b> <b>my</b> <b>age,</b> {{the most important thing for}} me is to keep active by doing things that I truly enjoy. I do not know how long I am going to be around, so every day is a celebration, and I want to share it with my fans." ...|$|E
5000|$|Another {{inspiration}} {{comes from}} Chow's own childhood experience. [...] "I lived by sea <b>at</b> <b>my</b> young <b>age</b> and I {{looked at the}} sea everyday, thinking what are in there? I was frightened and curious. I was very nervous when I swam in the sea anytime and felt there would be something hid underneath. I was fascinated with the (mermaid) story since then, and I felt I could do the film 6 years ago and started writing the script {{four or five years}} ago." ...|$|R
40|$|The work I {{created in}} {{conjunction}} with this paper is a representation of myself and my family, both individually and as a unit. The work was spawned by a search for <b>my</b> identity <b>at</b> <b>my</b> current <b>age</b> of 25. The outcome is an installation of photographs that focus on my heritage and family work ethic {{and a series of}} altar-like tables highlighting the personalities of my grandmother, grandfather, mother, father, and sister when they were experiencing life <b>at</b> <b>my</b> stage. I believe that this work culminates in defining me. Every element, every individual, reflects a part of myself in the people I love. The following paper explores the elements that come into play in the creation of this work...|$|R
5000|$|In the New Year Honours 2007, Perry was {{appointed}} a Member of the Order of the British Empire for services to commerce and the community. Asked by a Royal Gazette reporter for his reaction upon learning {{he was awarded}} the MBE, Perry said, [...] "All my friends will be happy to know that at least I have got something <b>at</b> <b>my</b> old <b>age.</b> I wasn’t expecting it but they say that when you don’t expect something then you get it." [...] He was subsequently congratulated by resolution of the Azores parliament in January, 2007, for having achieved the honour.|$|R

5000|$|Bono {{came out}} to both parents as a lesbian at age 18. In Family Outing, Bono wrote that, [...] "as a child, I always felt there was {{something}} different about me. I'd look <b>at</b> other girls <b>my</b> <b>age</b> and feel perplexed by their obvious interest in the latest fashion, which boy in class was the cutest, and who looked the most like cover girl Christie Brinkley. When I was 13, I finally found a name for exactly how I was different. I realized I was gay." ...|$|R
60|$|Let us {{understand}} one another {{once and for}} all. I cannot <b>at</b> <b>my</b> mature <b>age</b> participate in the sports of children with such abandon as I could wish. I entertain, and have always entertained, the sincerest regard for such games as Hunt-the-Slipper and Blind-Man's Buff. But I have now reached a time of life, when, to have my eyes blindfolded {{and to have a}} powerful boy of ten hit me in the back with a hobby-horse and ask me to guess who hit me, provokes me to a fit of retaliation which could only culminate in reckless criminality. Nor can I cover my shoulders with a drawing-room rug and crawl round {{on my hands and knees}} under the pretence that I am a bear without a sense of personal insufficiency, which is painful to me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Pray do {{stop that}} noise," [...] said Sir Robert; [...] "it gets upon my nerves, which are shaky this morning. Listen: It {{is a curious}} thing, one less to be {{understood}} even than the coincidence of the Yellow God, but <b>at</b> <b>my</b> present <b>age</b> of forty-four, {{for the first time}} in my life I have committed the folly of what is called falling in love. It is not the case of a successful, middle-aged man wishing to ranger himself and settle down with a desirable partie, but of sheer, stark infatuation. I adore Barbara; the worse she treats me the more I adore her. I had rather that the Sahara flotation should fail than that she should refuse me. I would rather lose three-quarters of my fortune than lose her. Do you understand?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't say. I really don't know. It's a very {{important}} step to take <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>age,</b> and I'm not quite sure that I should be doing wisely." ...|$|E

500|$|McDiarmid was {{surprised}} when Lucas approached him 16 years after Return of the Jedi to reprise the role of Palpatine. In an interview, he stated, [...] "When we were doing Return of the Jedi there was a rumor that George Lucas had nine films in his head, and he'd clearly just completed three of them." [...] McDiarmid added, [...] "Someone said that, 'Oh, I think what he might do next is go back in time, and show how Vader came to be.' It {{never occurred to me}} in a million years that I would be involved in that, because I thought, 'oh well, then he'll get a much younger actor [...]' That would be obvious." [...] However, [...] "I was the right age, ironically, for the first prequel when it was made. ...

5000|$|He says, in an interview: “I am a {{full-time}} writer and so I mark my holidays in red in my calendar. I wander {{in the path}} of my desire. For this, I have paid dearly and suffered disgrace. Inspite of all that, I like this life only. From my childhood, I have this habit of observing nature closely. Because of that, I started moving out of <b>my</b> home. <b>At</b> <b>my</b> young <b>age,</b> the doorstep was far away from me. Then, I crossed our doorstep. The street was far away and I was allowed in the street. Then I could move around the village freely, but was forbidden to go to other villages. I crossed that barrier. Then my family allowed me to go to small towns but not large cities. I crossed that too. Now I have no distinction between my home and this entire world. Journey without destination and people unknown are my interests.” ...|$|R

But the cold-blooded little demon {{sticks in}} my thoughts; she has bitten me with those even little teeth of hers; I {{feel as if}} I might turn rabid and do {{something}} crazy in consequence. It's very low, it's disgustingly low. She's the most mercenary little jade in Europe. Yet she really affects my peace of mind; she is always running in my head. It's a striking contrast to your noble and virtuous attachment--a vile contrast! It is rather pitiful {{that it should be}} the best I am able to do for myself <b>at</b> <b>my</b> present respectable <b>age.</b> I am a nice young man, eh, en somme? You can't warrant my future, as you do your own." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "On {{the first}} night when I slept in my new home I said to myself, 'They have taken me to be their servant: I will be {{something}} more than that--they shall end in taking me for their child.' Before I had been {{a week in the}} house I was the wife's favorite companion in the absence of her husband at his place of business. She was a highly accomplished woman, greatly her husband's superior in cultivation, and, unfortunately for herself, also his superior in years. The love was all on her side. Excepting certain occasions on which he roused her jealousy, they lived together on sufficiently friendly terms. S{{he was one of the}} many wives who resign themselves to be disappointed in their husbands--and he was one of the many husbands who never know what their wives really think of them. Her one great happiness was in teaching me. I was eager to learn; I made rapid progress. <b>At</b> <b>my</b> pliant <b>age</b> I soon acquired the refinements of language and manner which characterized my mistress. It is only the truth to say that the cultivation which has made me capable of personating a lady was her work.|$|R
6000|$|... "Home--yes; but {{not without}} my bride," [...] {{answered}} he, in the same hollow accents. [...] "You deem this mockery--perhaps madness.

6000|$|... "Oh, I {{know what}} you mean, but don't scruple on that score. <b>At</b> <b>my</b> <b>age,</b> with a mother like mine, it is simply to avoid teasing and {{excitement}} that I am silent." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. G.—Bassetlaw {{looks as}} if we were going back to 1886. For me [...] that is notice to quit. Another five years’ {{agitation}} <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>age</b> [...] would be impossible—ludicrous (with much emphasis).|$|E
