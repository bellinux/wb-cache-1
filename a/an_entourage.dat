5|$|Although {{the size}} of noble {{households}} shrank slightly during the 16th century, the number of guests at the largest castle events continued to grow. 2,000 came to a feast at Cawood Castle in 1466, while the Duke of Buckingham routinely entertained up to 519 people at Thornbury Castle {{at the start of}} the 16th century. When Elizabeth I visited Kenilworth in 1575 she brought <b>an</b> <b>entourage</b> of 31 barons and 400 staff for a visit that lasted an exceptional 19 days; Leicester, the castle's owner, entertained the Queen and much of the neighbouring region with pageants, fireworks, bear baiting, mystery plays, hunting and lavish banquets. With this scale of living and entertainment the need to find more space in older castles became a major issue in both England and Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth {{viewed the}} {{partially}} finished results at Kenilworth in 1572, but the complete effect of Leicester's work was only apparent during the queen's last visit in 1575. Leicester was keen to impress Elizabeth {{in a final}} attempt to convince her to marry him, and no expense was spared. Elizabeth brought <b>an</b> <b>entourage</b> of thirty-one barons and four hundred staff for the royal visit that lasted an exceptional nineteen days; twenty horsemen a day arrived at the castle to communicate royal messages. Leicester entertained the Queen {{and much of the}} neighbouring region with pageants, fireworks, bear baiting, mystery plays, hunting and lavish banquets. The cost was reputed to have amounted to many thousand pounds, almost bankrupting Leicester, though it probably did not exceed £1,700 in reality. The event was considered a huge success and formed the longest stay at such a property during any of Elizabeth's tours, yet the queen did not decide to marry Leicester.|$|E

5|$|Famous {{painters}} included Ni Zan and Dong Qichang, {{as well as}} the Four Masters of the Ming dynasty, Shen Zhou, Tang Yin, Wen Zhengming, and Qiu Ying. They drew {{upon the}} techniques, styles, and complexity in painting achieved by their Song and Yuan predecessors, but added techniques and styles. Well-known Ming artists could make a living simply by painting due to the high prices they demanded for their artworks and the great demand by the highly cultured community to collect precious works of art. The artist Qiu Ying was once paid 2.8kg (100oz) of silver to paint a long handscroll for the eightieth birthday celebration of the mother of a wealthy patron. Renowned artists often gathered <b>an</b> <b>entourage</b> of followers, some who were amateurs who painted while pursuing an official career and others who were full-time painters.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, Bence joined <b>an</b> <b>entourage</b> {{including}} César Tiempo, Máximo Berrondo, and Enrique Serrano {{and appeared}} at the International Film Festival of India, where she met Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru at an official reception for foreign artists. Back in Argentina, she accepted an offer to star in the Uruguayan television production of Maribel y la extraña familia and on Canal 9 in Buenos Aires, a production of Nuestra Natacha. Under the direction of Daniel Tinayre, she participated in the low-budget film La cigarra no es un bicho, intended to revive the national film industry. The film featured performances by Homero Cárpena, Bárbara Mujica and Luis Sandrini and others. In the first week, viewings exceeded 3,000 spectators per day and the film spent seven weeks at the Cine Opera and eleven at the Trocadero Theater. In the film, Bence played a prostitute and La Nación reported that she and Luis Sandrini's performances shone. Shortly after, both were honored as the best Argentine artists {{of the year by}} Chilean journalists.|$|E
5|$|John Constantine, {{the main}} {{character}} of Hellblazer, was portrayed {{as a kind of}} confidence man and occult detective who did morally questionable things, arguably for the greater good. He usually triumphed through guile, deceit, and misdirection, but often made more enemies in the process than he defeated. Indeed, it was a common theme in the book that Constantine was unable to effect any lasting change or enjoy unequivocal victories. While sometimes striving for the good of mankind, Constantine was often manipulative and a dangerous person to have as a friend, as the lives and souls of those around him became perilously involved in his misadventures. He took pains to protect himself from direct attacks, but his friends and relatives were often endangered in order to strike at him. The spirits of deceased friends haunted him, individually or as <b>an</b> <b>entourage</b> of ghosts.|$|E

25|$|Every {{topological group}} G (in particular, every topological vector space) becomes a uniform space if we define a subset V of G times& G to be <b>an</b> <b>entourage</b> if {{and only if}} it {{contains}} the set { (x, y) : x⋅yminus&1 in U } for some neighborhood U of the identity element of G. This uniform structure on G is called the right uniformity on G, because for every a in G, the right multiplication x → x⋅a is uniformly continuous with respect to this uniform structure. One may also define a left uniformity on G; the two need not coincide, but they both generate the given topology on G.|$|E

Along with <b>an</b> <b>entourage</b> of court officials, the Guangxu Emperor would pay visits to her every second or third day at which major political decisions would be made.

25|$|Cody's {{headline}} performers {{were well}} known in their own right. Annie Oakley and her husband, Frank Butler, were sharpshooters, together {{with the likes of}} Gabriel Dumont and Lillian Smith. Performers re-enacted the riding of the Pony Express, Indian attacks on wagon trains, and stagecoach robberies. The show was said to end with a re-enactment of Custer's Last Stand, in which Cody portrayed General Custer, but this is more legend than fact. The finale was typically a portrayal of an Indian attack on a settler's cabin. Cody would ride in with <b>an</b> <b>entourage</b> of cowboys to defend a settler and his family. This finale was featured predominantly as early as 1886 but was not performed after 1907; it was used in 23 of 33 tours. Another celebrity appearing on the show was Calamity Jane, as a storyteller as of 1893.|$|E

25|$|Mirza Ghulam Ahmad's lineage {{through his}} forefathers {{can be traced}} back to Mirza Hadi Beg, a {{descendant}} of the Mughal Barlas tribe. The Barlas tribe was of Turco-Mongol ancestry. In 1530 Mirza Hadi Beg migrated from Samarkand (present-day Uzbekistan) along with <b>an</b> <b>entourage</b> of two hundred persons consisting of his family, servants and followers. Travelling through Samarkand, they finally settled in the Punjab, India, where Mirza Hadi founded the town known today as Qadian during the reign of the Mughal King Zaheer al-Din Babur, his distant relative. The family were all known as Mughals within the British governmental records of India probably due to the high positions it occupied within the Mughal empire and their courts. Mirza Hadi Beg was granted a Jagir of several hundred villages and was appointed the Qadhi (judge) of Qadian and the surrounding district. The descendants of Mirza Hadi are said to have held important positions within the Mughal empire and had consecutively been the chieftains of Qadian.|$|E
25|$|Although Lucheni {{boasted that}} he acted alone, because many {{political}} refugees found a haven in Switzerland, {{the possibility that}} he was part of a plot and that the life of the emperor was also in danger, was considered. Once it was discovered that an Italian was responsible for Elisabeth's murder, unrest swept Vienna and reprisals were threatened against Italians. The intensity of shock, mourning, and outrage far exceeded that which occurred at the news of Rudolf's death. An outcry also immediately erupted over the lack of protection for the empress. The Swiss police were well aware of her presence, and telegrams to the appropriate authorities advising them to take all precautions had been dispatched. Police Chief Virieux of the Canton of Vaud had organized Elisabeth's protection, but she had detected his officers outside the hotel the day before the assassination and protested that the surveillance was disagreeable, so Virieux {{had no choice but to}} withdraw them. It is also possible that if Elisabeth had not dismissed her other attendants that day, <b>an</b> <b>entourage</b> larger than one lady-in-waiting could have discouraged Lucheni, who had been following the Empress for several days, awaiting an opportunity.|$|E
