5|$|After the war, {{under the}} Polish People's Republic, the {{intellectual}} and academic community of Kraków was put under complete political control. The universities were soon deprived of printing rights <b>and</b> <b>autonomy.</b> The Stalinist government ordered {{the construction of the}} country's largest steel mill in the newly created suburb of Nowa Huta. The creation of the giant Lenin Steelworks (now Sendzimir Steelworks owned by Mittal) sealed Kraków's transformation from a university city, into an industrial centre. The new working-class, drawn by the industrialisation of Kraków, contributed to rapid population growth.|$|E
5|$|Opponents {{to suicide}} include Christian {{philosophers}} such as Augustine of Hippo, Thomas Aquinas, Immanuel Kant and, arguably, John Stuart Mill – Mill's {{focus on the}} importance of liberty <b>and</b> <b>autonomy</b> meant that he rejected choices which would prevent a person from making future autonomous decisions. Others view suicide as a legitimate matter of personal choice. Supporters of this position maintain that no one should be forced to suffer against their will, particularly from conditions such as incurable disease, mental illness, and old age, with no possibility of improvement. They reject the belief that suicide is always irrational, arguing instead that it can be a valid last resort for those enduring major pain or trauma. A stronger stance would argue that people should be allowed to autonomously choose to die regardless of whether they are suffering. Notable supporters of this school of thought include Scottish empiricist David Hume and American bioethicist Jacob Appel.|$|E
40|$|Modern advocators of {{personal}} autonomy {{are eager to}} stress the distance between their belief in personal <b>autonomy</b> <b>and</b> moral <b>autonomy.</b> I hold a very different view {{that there is no}} need drawing a strict boundary between moral <b>autonomy</b> <b>and</b> personal <b>autonomy.</b> I introduce into this article two phrases—contextual <b>autonomy</b> <b>and</b> global <b>autonomy,</b> with the help of which we blend successfully moral autonomy with personal autonomy.

5|$|Russian tsar Alexander I, also newly crowned King of Poland, gave Zajączek on 3 December 1815 the {{position}} of the first Namestnik of Kingdom of Poland (tsar's deputized ruler of the territory, a position similar to that of a viceroy). This nomination surprised many, including Zajączek himself, who is said to have at first refused this position, but in the end accepted it after Alexander phrased his request as a direct order. Zajączek's years as a namestnik have garnered mixed reviews, both among his contemporaries, as well as among later historians. He was actively interested in economic development of Polish lands, and contributed to the industrialization and urbanization of the Kingdom's lands; he {{was also one of the}} founders of the University of Warsaw. He has been criticized, however, for being inexperienced for such a major civil leader position, too servile to the wishes of his patron, Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich and he often disregarded the Constitution of the Congress Poland, which contributed to a slow but steady erosion of the country's freedoms <b>and</b> <b>autonomy.</b> Deferential towards the Russian authorities, he readily let Duke Constantine and Alexander's commissar, Nikolay Nikolayevich Novosiltsev, neither of whose positions were envisioned in the Constitution, become the de facto rulers of the Kingdom. In recognition of Zajączek's services, Aleksander I bestowed upon him the title of 'Prince of Poland' on 27 April 1818.|$|E

40|$|While much {{research}} has focused on self-leadership, few researches have addressed how, why and when this appears. This thesis presents a quantitative research on the effects of the need for <b>autonomy</b> <b>and</b> job <b>autonomy</b> on self-leadership. Based on the literature on self-leadership, the Job-Demands Resources Model, the Job-Demands Control Model and the Self-Determination Theory, we hypothesized that employees with a high need for <b>autonomy</b> <b>and</b> much job-autonomy would be most likely to posses self-leadership skills. Employees from several health organizations (N= 222) completed a questionnaire containing an existing self-leadership scale, an existing scale for job <b>autonomy</b> <b>and</b> a new scale to measure need for job autonomy. The results of the multiple regression analyses revealed that the need for job <b>autonomy</b> <b>and</b> job <b>autonomy</b> both predict self-leadership. The effect of the need for autonomy on self-leadership is stronger than the effect of job autonomy on self-leadership. An interaction effect between need for <b>autonomy</b> <b>and</b> job <b>autonomy</b> on self-leadership could not be found. The findings suggest that personal traits are more relevant than contextual factors in predicting self-leadership by employees within health organizations...|$|R
