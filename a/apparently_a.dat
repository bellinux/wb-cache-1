5|$|The {{approximate}} {{ratios of}} periods of adjacent orbits are (proceeding outward): 1:20, 1:3, 1:6, 1:20. The nearly 1:3 ratio between 55 Cancri b and c is <b>apparently</b> <b>a</b> near resonance, {{rather than a}} genuine mean motion resonance.|$|E
5|$|All of this cosmic {{evolution}} {{after the}} inflationary epoch can be rigorously described and modeled by the ΛCDM model of cosmology, which uses the independent frameworks {{of quantum mechanics}} and Einstein's General Relativity. There is no well-supported model describing the action prior to 10−15 seconds or so. <b>Apparently</b> <b>a</b> new unified theory of quantum gravitation is needed to break this barrier. Understanding this earliest of eras {{in the history of}} the universe is currently one of the greatest unsolved problems in physics.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with other}} Chetnik commanders, Baćović carried out {{numerous}} massacres of Bosnian Muslim and Catholic civilians and those {{sympathetic to the}} Partisan movement. In April 1945, he was captured near Banja Luka by elements of the Armed Forces of the Independent State of Croatia (HOS) along with Chetnik leaders Pavle Đurišić and Zaharije Ostojić, and Chetnik ideologue Dragiša Vasić in what was <b>apparently</b> <b>a</b> trap. According to some sources, Baćović {{and the others were}} taken to the area of the Jasenovac concentration camp, where they were killed.|$|E
5|$|Beorhtwulf {{was married}} to Sæthryth, <b>apparently</b> <b>a</b> figure of some {{importance}} {{in her own right}} as she witnessed all of his charters between 840 and 849, after which she disappears from the record. Beorhtwulf is said to have had two sons, Beorhtfrith and Beorhtric. Beorhtric is known from witnessing his father's charters, but he ceased to do so before the end of Beorhtwulf's reign.|$|E

5|$|Cædwalla's {{departure}} in 688 {{appears to}} have led to instability {{in the south of}} England. Ine, Cædwalla's successor, abdicated in 726, and the West Saxon Genealogical Regnal List says that he reigned for thirty-seven years, implying his reign began in 689 instead of 688. This could indicate an unsettled period between Cædwalla's abdication and Ine's accession. The kingship also changed in Kent in 688, with Oswine, who was <b>apparently</b> <b>a</b> Mercian client, taking the throne; and there is evidence of East Saxon influence in Kent in the years immediately following Cædwalla's abdication.|$|E
5|$|From 872 to 877 {{there was}} <b>apparently</b> <b>a</b> period of calm, since the sources are silent on any {{military}} operations in Sicily. This was probably chiefly due to internal turmoil in Muslim Sicily, with six governors reported as having taken office during this period, {{as well as the}} weakness of the Aghlabid government on the Ifriqiyan metropolis. In Italy, Muslim raids continued, but the Byzantines had a major success in 875 or 876, after the death of Louis II, when they took possession of Bari.|$|E
5|$|It seems {{curious that}} a text so {{obviously}} written {{with the expectation}} that it would be widely copied should exist in only one manuscript and that, <b>apparently,</b> <b>a</b> draft. Treharne has taken this as suggesting that it is not only modern readers who have found the work tedious (Treharne 2000, p.273). Orm, however, says in the preface that he wishes Walter to remove any wording that he finds clumsy or incorrect (quoted in Bennett and Smithers 1982, pp.175–76).|$|E

5|$|The {{hooded pitohui}} {{is found in}} forests from sea-level up to , but is most common in hills and low mountains. A social bird, it lives in family groups and {{frequently}} joins and even leads mixed-species foraging flocks. The diet {{is made up of}} fruits, seeds and invertebrates. This species is <b>apparently</b> <b>a</b> cooperative breeder, with family groups helping to protect the nest and feed the young. The hooded pitohui is common and not at risk of extinction.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files; this season focuses on the {{investigations}} of John Doggett (Robert Patrick), Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). In this episode, an amateur stunt performer is killed while performing a daring act for a local cable reality show. Scully, Doggett and Reyes discover that the culprit was <b>apparently</b> <b>a</b> swarm of killer flies hidden in the victim's brain.|$|E

5|$|Amenhotep I was {{succeeded by}} Thutmose I, <b>apparently</b> <b>a</b> senior {{military}} figure. It is unclear {{if there was}} any blood relationship between the two, although {{it has been suggested that}} Thutmose I was a son of Amenhotep's elder brother Ahmose Sipairi. Amenhotep may have appointed Thutmose I as coregent before his own death as Thutmose I's name appears next to Amenhotep's on a divine barque found by archeologists in the fill of the third pylon at Karnak. However, most scholars consider that this is only evidence of Thutmose associating himself with his royal predecessor. One text has also been interpreted to mean that Amenhotep appointed his infant son as coregent, who then predeceased him. However, the scholarly consensus is that there is too little evidence for either coregency.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the Civil War, all aircraft, equipment, materiel, and {{facilities}} belonging to the Liberian Air Force were badly damaged, rendering the force inoperable. During the Civil War the Taylor government made a variety of different air support arrangements; a seemingly inoperable Mil Mi-2 and Mil Mi-8, one in Anti-Terrorist Unit markings, could be seen at Spriggs Payne Airport in central Monrovia in mid-2005, <b>apparently</b> <b>a</b> hangover from the war. Meanwhile, during the Taylor era, the Navy consisted of a couple of small patrol craft. However, on shore, both late 1990s and 2005 sources indicate the Navy included the 2nd Naval District, Buchanan, the 3rd Naval District, Greenville, and the 4th Naval District, Harper.|$|E

5|$|As far as known, Oryzomys gorgasi has a disjunct {{distribution}} in northwestern South America, including Colombia, Venezuela, and Curaçao. In a 2009 paper, Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales speculated that its distribution may extend into Central America. The Colombian population is {{known from the}} holotype only, caught at Loma Teguerre (7°54'N, 77°W) in Antioquia Department, northwestern Colombia, near the Río Atrato, at about 1m above sea level. The location is <b>apparently</b> <b>a</b> freshwater swamp, and Hershkovitz suggested that O.gorgasi probably occurred throughout the swamp forests in the Río Atrato basin. On Curaçao, it is known from cave faunas at Tafelberg Santa Barbara, Noordkant, Ser'i Kura, and Hermanus. At Tafelberg Santa Barbara, it was found in association with introduced black rats (Rattus rattus), indicating that the population persisted {{at least until the}} first European contact in 1499.|$|E
5|$|Farrell was {{inspired}} to try acting when Henry Thomas' performance in E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial moved him to tears. With his brother's encouragement, he attended the Gaiety School of Acting, dropping out when he was cast as Danny Byrne on Ballykissangel, a BBC drama about a young English priest who becomes part of an Irish rural community. As an 18-year-old travelling in Sydney, he was at one time suspected for attempted murder. The police sketch looked remarkably like him and he had even described blacking out during the night in question. His only alibi was <b>apparently</b> <b>a</b> journal kept by his friend that explained the two had been across town that night, taking MDMA.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Poe {{leaves them}} with their Aunt Josephine, a kindly woman who is {{nonetheless}} obsessed with grammar and has irrational fears. Olaf appears disguised as Captain Sham to interfere with their plans again. One day, Josephine is not at the house, leaving what is <b>apparently</b> <b>a</b> suicide note; Klaus takes advantage of mistakes in the letter's grammar (which Josephine would never have tolerated) to decode her location; Curdled Cave. A hurricane sweeps through the town, ultimately destroying the house but allowing the children to flee before the structure falls apart. They sail to the cave and rescue her, but attract leeches due to Josephine having eaten a banana. Olaf appears and takes the kids with him, throwing Josephine off the boat and to the Lachrymose Leeches after she annoys him by correcting his speech.|$|E
