5|$|Virginia Tech {{began the}} second quarter in {{possession}} of the ball and facing a third-and-five from its own 20-yard line. On the first play of the quarter, quarterback Sean Glennon threw for the first down, but was intercepted at the 37-yard line by Kansas' Chris Harris. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>interception,</b> Kansas had the ball at the Virginia Tech 31-yard line. Todd Reesing connected on a first-down pass to Derek Fine, and running back Brandon McAnderson contributed several short rushes. The Kansas offense failed to gain a second first down <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>interception,</b> however, and kicker Scott Webb was again called upon to attempt a field goal, this time from 32yards away. Unlike his first kick, the second sailed through the uprights for three points. With 12minutes remaining in {{the second quarter}}, Kansas extended its lead to 100.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} Tide {{play of the}} drive, Alabama was penalized 15 yards for {{holding on to the}} {{facemask}} of a Virginia Tech player. A running play by Alexander was stopped after a loss of a yard, then Zow threw an interception directly to Virginia Tech's Phillip Summers, who returned the ball to the two-yard line. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>interception,</b> it took Tech two plays for Pegues to push the football across the goal line for Tech's second touchdown of the game. The extra point was good, and Tech extended its lead to 177 with 8:15 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} play <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>interception,</b> Pegues gained one yard on a rushing play to the right. Clark then {{completed}} a pass to Jarrett Ferguson at the Alabama 36-yard line for a first down. During the play, Alabama was called for a five-yard penalty for grabbing Ferguson's facemask during the tackle. After the penalty, Angelo Harrison gained nine yards on a reverse run. Ferguson then was tackled for a loss of two yards, and Clark threw an incomplete pass on third down. Tech head coach Frank Beamer sent in Graham to attempt a 42-yard field goal. The kick sailed right of the goal, however. With 4:10 remaining in the first quarter, Tech led Alabama 70.|$|E
25|$|On the Bengals' {{first play}} <b>after</b> {{receiving}} <b>the</b> ensuing kickoff, Eric Wright intercepted a pass from Anderson. <b>After</b> returning <b>the</b> <b>interception</b> 25 yards, Wright fumbled while being tackled by Bengals guard Max Montoya, but San Francisco linebacker Willie Harper recovered {{the ball at}} the Bengals' 22-yard line.|$|R
50|$|The attack came {{three weeks}} <b>after</b> <b>the</b> {{reported}} <b>interception</b> of a vessel carrying anti-aircraft missiles and munitions for Hezbollah by the Israeli Navy. The vessel was reportedly {{stopped in the}} Red Sea, and its crew of four was arrested.|$|R
5000|$|Use {{of nuclear}} warheads on antimissile interceptors would degrade {{capability}} of defensive radar, thus possibly rendering defense ineffective <b>after</b> <b>the</b> first few <b>interceptions</b> ...|$|R
5|$|Thanks to the {{interception}} {{in the end}} zone, Alabama's offense {{returned to}} the field at its 20-yard line, the regulation starting point after a ball is downed in the end zone. A deep pass by Zow fell incomplete, then Alexander ran for a one-yard gain. On third down, Zow completed a first-down pass to wide receiver Michael Vaughn at the Alabama 32-yard line. Zow then completed another first-down pass, this time to Freddy Milons at Alabama 45-yard line. Alexander rushed ahead for a one-yard gain, then Zow threw an interception to Tech defender Ryan Smith, who returned {{the ball to the}} Alabama 36-yard line. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>interception,</b> Virginia Tech committed a 15-yard personal foul penalty, which pushed the Hokies back to their 49-yard line.|$|E
5|$|The Trojans next {{traveled}} to face rivals, the California Golden Bears, led by fourth–year head coach Jeff Tedford and quarterback Joe Ayoob. Although the Bears handed the Trojans their last loss in 2003, they were struggling in the season, having lost {{three out of}} the last four games and dropping out of the rankings {{for the first time since}} 2003. The Trojans scored first after Ayoob's first of four interceptions in the game, on a LenDale White rush. Ayoob recovered <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>interception,</b> and led the Bears to a field goal to cut their deficit to four at the end of the first quarter. In the second quarter, Leinart rushed for a pair of touchdowns to give the Trojans a 21–3 lead at half-time. After a pair of White rushing touchdowns, the Bears scored again on a Chris Manerino rush that ended scoring in the game, with the Trojans winning 35–10. With the win, the Trojans clinched at least a share of the Pac-10 title and increased their winning streak to 32games, tied for the sixthlongest in history.|$|E
5|$|The {{first few}} plays {{of the fourth}} quarter {{failed to live up}} to the promise that had been shown in the third for the Hokies. Two {{incomplete}} passes and one that gained just twoyards forced Virginia Tech to punt the ball away with 13:49 remaining in the quarter. After taking over at its 33-yard line, Kansas had no more success on offense than did Virginia Tech. After three straight plays with no gain, Kansas was forced to punt the ball away as well. A 58-yard kick by Kyle Tucker pinned Virginia Tech inside its 10-yard line, and the Hokies were unable to advance the ball much beyond the ten-yard line. An incomplete pass and a two-yard run by Branden Ore were all the offense managed before Sean Glennon threw a 20-yard interception to the Jayhawks' Justin Thornton. Thornton returned the ball 30yards to the Virginia Tech two-yard line, and on Kansas' first play <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>interception,</b> Todd Reesing ran twoyards for the touchdown. The score gave the Jayhawks a 2414 lead with just 10:57 remaining.|$|E
50|$|<b>After</b> an <b>interception,</b> <b>the</b> Bruins {{scored on}} a pass {{touchdown}} from Kevin Prince to Taylor Embree on their first offensive play.|$|R
500|$|Ball State took {{advantage}} of a pass interference penalty on Arkansas State on their drive – Secor kicked a 37-yard field goal to pull the Cardinals within three points. The Red Wolves then went three-and-out. After that, each team's quarterback (Wenning and Knighten respectively) threw interceptions; <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>interceptions,</b> Ball State had the ball at their own 4-yard line (Wenning's interception was returned to the 8-yard line). They scored after executing a demoralizing 16-play, 80-yard drive that encapsulated 6:51 – it culminated when Edwards rushed for a 1-yard touchdown. Arkansas State efficiently responded, scoring on a 13-yard pass from Knighten to Allen Muse, a , [...] senior wide receiver. The touchdown gave Arkansas State a 23–20 lead {{that they would not}} relinquish – Secor attempted a 38-yard field goal as time expired to try to tie the game, however the kick was blocked, and the Red Wolves held on to win.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the third}} quarter, Pittsburgh {{increased}} their lead with Davenport getting a 1-yard TD run. [...] St. Louis would reply with Bulger completing a 23-yard TD pass to WR Drew Bennett. [...] However, {{in the fourth}} quarter, the Steelers sealed the win with Reed nailing a 29-yard field goal and CB Ike Taylor returning an interception 51yards for a touchdown. Cameras caught Torry Holt lash out an obscenity-laced tirade at Scott Linehan <b>after</b> <b>the</b> [...] <b>interception.</b>|$|R
5|$|Two running plays gained 11 {{yards and}} a first down, then Tennessee quarterback Jonathan Crompton began {{throwing}} the ball. His first pass the game fell incomplete, and his second was intercepted by Virginia Tech defender Rashad Carmichael, who ran {{it back to the}} Tennessee 44-yard line. Tech's second drive of the game thus began in Tennessee's defensive half. The first play of the drive was a 20-yard throw from Taylor to wide receiver Jarrett Boykin. That completed pass was the longest play of the drive, which continued through short rushes and passes. On the seventh play <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>interception,</b> Williams ran the ball forward one yard, crossing the goal line for the game's first touchdown. Tech placekicker Matt Waldron successfully converted the extra point, and with 6:56 remaining in the first quarter, Tech led 7-0.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech {{returned}} the post-touchdown kickoff to its 26-yard line. The Hokie offense picked up short gains on {{first and second}} down before Tech quarterback Erik Chapman threw his second interception of the game, a pass that was tipped {{into the air and}} caught by NC State defender Derrick Taylor. The Wolfpack offense took over at the 46-yard line of Virginia Tech. On its first play <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>interception,</b> Kramer completed a 19-yard pass to Haywood Jeffires. After a short run, Kramer completed a 13-yard pass to Jeffries for another first down. Deep inside the Tech red zone, it took the Wolfpack two more plays before Kramer connected on a pass to tight end Ralph Britt for a touchdown. NC State now led 2110 with just over four minutes remaining before halftime.|$|E
5|$|Following Virginia Tech's kickoff, Cincinnati {{began its}} first drive {{of the second}} half at its 36-yard line. Pike was stopped for no gain on a rushing attempt, then {{attempted}} a long pass downfield. The ball was intercepted by Virginia Tech defender Kam Chancellor, and the Hokies' offense returned to the field after just two Cincinnati plays. Tech's first play <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>interception</b> resulted in Taylor being sacked by Cincinnati defender Brandon Underwood for a loss of three yards, but Darren Evans made up the lost yardage by rushing 14 yards to the Tech 43-yard line for a first down. Taylor and Evans alternated short rushes, then Taylor completed a five-yard pass to Coale for another first down, this one at the Cincinnati 47-yard line. Once in Cincinnati territory, however, the Hokies' offense faltered. Evans was tackled for a two-yard loss, then Taylor was sacked again, this time by John Hughes. A long pass attempt fell incomplete, and Tech punted {{for the first time in}} the second half. Returner Danny Milligan fumbled the ball, but he recovered the loose ball and returned it to the Cincinnati 20-yard line.|$|E
50|$|Over one {{and half}} year after Super Bowl XLIX, the Seahawks {{were trying to}} get their revenge against <b>the</b> Patriots <b>after</b> <b>the</b> heartbreaking <b>interception.</b> They {{successfully}} got their revenge by stopping the Patriots from getting into the end zone, and won the game 31-24. The Seahawks were the only team to defeat the Patriots under Tom Brady during this season. This also marks Pete Carrolls first return to Boston since 1999 after he got fired from the Patriots organization.|$|R
50|$|In 1991, 28 years <b>after</b> its <b>interception,</b> <b>the</b> Bundesliga finally {{became a}} league {{for all of}} Germany. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> German reunion, two clubs from the east, F.C. Hansa Rostock and Dynamo Dresden joined the league for the 1991-92 season and caused a one-off {{expansion}} of the league to 20 teams.|$|R
50|$|The Winnipeg {{fans who}} were booing earlier at Brink were now yelling {{to disrupt the}} Lions' play calling. With the Lions down 41-35 in the 2nd {{overtime}} period, Printers attempted a pass to O'Neil Wilson on 2nd and long. However, it was intercepted by Deon Beasley and returned for a touchdown. Shortly <b>after</b> throwing <b>the</b> game-ending <b>interception,</b> Printers was seen throwing his helmet {{to the ground in}} disgust and yelling at Wilson.|$|R
25|$|This time, the Colts {{were unable}} to get any points. Three plays <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>interception,</b> Broncos linebacker Reggie Hayward {{recovered}} a fumble from James on the Broncos 38-yard line. After that, the Broncos drove 62 yards in 12 plays and scored with Plummer's 7-yard touchdown pass to Smith, cutting their deficit to 41–10. But by then, there was only seven {{minutes left in the}} game.|$|E
25|$|The Patriots {{took the}} opening kickoff and scored {{on their first}} drive, {{advancing}} the ball 65 yards in 13 plays. Tom Brady completed four passes to receiver David Givens for 40 yards on the drive, including a 7-yard touchdown pass, and converted a fourth down on his own 44-yard line with a 2-yard run. Manning seemed ready to counter, driving the Colts 68 yards to the New England 5-yard line, but on third down and 3, his pass was intercepted by Rodney Harrison in the end zone. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>interception,</b> the Patriots drove 67 yards to the Colts 13-yard line where Vinatieri's 31-yard field goal increased their lead to 10–0.|$|E
25|$|<b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>interception,</b> Kosar {{completed}} five {{of seven}} passes for 65 yards while Byner rushed six times for 20 and capped off the drive with a 2-yard touchdown run, putting the Browns {{back in the}} lead, 21–14. Then after forcing a punt, Matt Bahr's 22-yard field goal gave the Browns a 10-point lead with just over 11 {{minutes left in the}} game. Following another punt, Byner fumbled the ball on a 25-yard run, but running back Herman Fontenot recovered the ball at the Colts 6-yard line, turning the play into a 41-yard gain. Three plays later, Kosar's 2-yard touchdown pass to receiver Brian Brennan made the score 31–14 with 3:44 left.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>interception</b> of photosynthetically active {{radiation}} (PAR) by maize crops {{cultivated in}} different soil tillage systems and water availability was evaluated in a field experiment carried out in Eldorado do Sul, Brazil. Crops were sown to no-tillage and conventional tillage systems, with full irrigation no irrigation. Continuing measurements of transmitted PAR to the soil surface and incoming PAR were taken through the crop cycle. On average, the intercepted PAR in conventional tillage system was 40 % {{higher than in the}} no-tillage system. Early in plant growth the intercepted PAR in conventional tillage was twice that in no-tillage. This tendency was maintained up to maximum leaf area index. <b>After</b> tasseling <b>the</b> lowest <b>interception</b> of PAR occurred in the conventional tillage due to a higher rate of leaf senescence. Considering the entire crop cycle <b>the</b> <b>interception</b> of PAR by non-irrigated plants was 30 % lower than by irrigated plants. It was attributed to reductions on the leaf area and to rolling up of wilted leaves due to water deficits...|$|R
50|$|Neither {{team made}} much headway scoring {{in the first}} quarter with Blake Brewer missing his first field goal of the season from 37 yards out with two minutes left in the quarter. On their next possession, <b>after</b> an <b>interception,</b> <b>the</b> 49ers found the endzone on a Matt Johnson 6-yard pass to Trent Bostick. The score {{at the end of the}} quarter was 49ers up 7 to 0.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the third}} period, Colts {{defensive}} back Ashley Ambrose intercepted a pass from Bono at midfield, setting up Blanchard's 30-yard field goal {{to give his}} team the lead. [...] Early in the fourth quarter, the Chiefs reached the Indianapolis 22-yard line, but all they got was another missed field goal, this one from 39 yards with 10:36 left to play. [...] Indianapolis failed to gain a first down with their next two drives, while Bono threw consecutive interceptions, one to linebacker Quentin Coryatt and another to cornerback Eugene Daniel. [...] <b>After</b> <b>the</b> Coryatt <b>interception,</b> <b>the</b> Colts {{had a chance to}} increase their lead, but Blanchard missed a field goal attempt from 49 yards out. [...] With 4:12 left in the game, Rich Gannon replaced Bono and led the Chiefs from their own 18 to the Colts 25-yard line. [...] But with 42 seconds left, Elliot missed his third field goal of the day, a 42-yard attempt, and Indianapolis escaped with a win.|$|R
25|$|<b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>interception,</b> Jeff George led the Vikings 96 {{yards in}} eight plays, {{completing}} passes to Randy Moss and Jake Reed for gains of 24 and 41 yards and finishing the drive with a 22-yard touchdown completion to Cris Carter, cutting the score to 14–10 5:07 {{into the second}} quarter. Later on, Rams defensive back Dexter McCleon intercepted a pass from George on the Vikings 41-yard line. But on the next play, Faulk fumbled a handoff and safety Robert Griffith recovered {{the ball on the}} 47. After that, Minnesota took the lead by driving 53 yards and scoring on a 4-yard touchdown run from fullback Leroy Hoard with 2:40 left in the half. Aided by Bruce's 22-yard reception, the Rams responded with a drive to the Minnesota 37-yard line, but a 9-yard sack by defensive lineman John Randle pushed St. Louis out of field goal range and the score remained 17–14 by halftime.|$|E
25|$|Miami {{continued}} {{to turn the}} ball over through the second quarter. Beasley recorded his second interception from Marino on the Dolphins next possession. Then after a punt, running back Autry Denson fumbled a pitch from Marino, and safety Donovin Darius recovered the ball at the Dolphins 7-yard line. This time, the Jaguars could {{not take advantage of}} the turnover. Two plays later, Dolphins defensive back Calvin Jackson intercepted a pass from Fiedler in the end zone. But several plays <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>interception,</b> Jacksonville safety Carnell Lake forced and recovered a fumble from J. J. Johnson on the Dolphins 30-yard line, setting up a 30-yard field goal from Hollis with 1:47 left in the second quarter. Marino, who completed only three of 11 passes for 12 yards up to this point, finally managed to respond, completing seven of 12 passes for 79 yards on an 80-yard scoring drive and finishing it off with a 20-yard touchdown pass to Oronde Gadsden with less than 20 seconds left before halftime.|$|E
25|$|Trying to halt a six-game losing streak, the Lions {{returned}} home to Ford Field for an interconference matchup with the Kansas City Chiefs, losers of seven games in a row. Detroit got on the board early with an 11-yard TD run from T. J. Duckett and a safety off a blocked Dustin Colquitt punt. In the second quarter, the Lions opened up a 19–0 lead with a Jason Hanson field goal and a Paris Lenon interception return for a touchdown. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>interception,</b> Chiefs quarterback Brodie Croyle tried to stop Lenon in his return, but injured his wrist and sat out {{the remainder of the}} game. Damon Huard filled in, and nearly brought Kansas City back with its first win since October. A 3-yard run from RB Jackie Battle and a 1-yard pass from Huard to Jared Allen, whom made his second touchdown catch on offense this season, made the game 19–14. The Lions' Jason Hanson added two more field goals in the second half and the Chiefs could not convert a two-point conversion to Tony Gonzalez in the 3rd after a Dwayne Bowe receiving TD. Detroit held KC off, 25–20, ending their long skid. However, this would be the Lions' last win until week three of the 2009 season.|$|E

25|$|Wisconsin {{would start}} {{the game with}} the ball. The Badgers put {{together}} a nice 11–play drive that would end with Wisconsin striking first with a 4-yard touchdown run by RB James White. The next two drives (one by each team) would all result in three–and–outs. The Badgers would get the ball back after an interception by quarterback turned safety Tanner McEvoy. BYU would take over after a catch and fumble by WR Kenzel Doe. BYU then put together their own nice 13–play drive but {{they would have to}} settle for a field goal. A Wisconsin three–and–out would give the ball back to BYU and the first quarter came to a close with Wisconsin leading 7–3. The Cougars would get the ball to the Badgers 32-yard line but they would put the ball rather than attempt a long field goal into the wind. Two plays later, the Badgers would again turn the ball over after an interception by QB Joel Stave. The Couguars would have very good field possession <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>interception</b> at their own 40-yard line but the Badgers defense would force a punt. Wisconsin would get down to the BYU 20-yard line but stalled there and settle for a 38-yard field goal by K Jack Russell, the first field goal of his career. The Badgers defense forced BYU to a three–and–out and Wisconsin would score just before halftime on a 5-yard touchdown pass to James White from Joel Stave. Wisconsin led 17–3 at the half.|$|E
