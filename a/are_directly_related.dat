5|$|Several {{relativistic}} effects <b>are</b> <b>directly</b> <b>related</b> to the relativity of direction. One is geodetic precession: {{the axis}} {{direction of a}} gyroscope in free fall in curved spacetime will change when compared, for instance, with the direction of light received from distant stars—even though such a gyroscope represents the way of keeping a direction as stable as possible ("parallel transport"). For the Moon–Earth system, this effect has been measured {{with the help of}} lunar laser ranging. More recently, it has been measured for test masses aboard the satellite Gravity Probe B to a precision of better than 0.3%.|$|E
5|$|This trend {{continued}} {{and increases in}} the production of hydroelectric power <b>are</b> <b>directly</b> <b>related</b> to industrial development. In 2005, Landsvirkjun produced 7,143 GWh of electricity total of which 6,676 GWh or 93% was produced via hydroelectric power plants. Additionally 5,193 GWh or 72% was used for power-intensive industries like aluminum smelting. In 2009 Iceland built its biggest hydroelectric project to date, a 690 MW hydroelectric plant to provide energy for another aluminum smelter — the Kárahnjúkar Hydropower Plant. This project was opposed strongly by environmentalists.|$|E
5|$|In special relativity, {{energy is}} closely {{connected}} to momentum. Just as {{space and time}} are, in that theory, different aspects of a more comprehensive entity called spacetime, energy and momentum are merely different aspects of a unified, four-dimensional quantity that physicists call four-momentum. In consequence, if energy {{is a source of}} gravity, momentum must be a source as well. The same is true for quantities that <b>are</b> <b>directly</b> <b>related</b> to energy and momentum, namely internal pressure and tension. Taken together, in general relativity it is mass, energy, momentum, pressure and tension that serve as sources of gravity: they are how matter tells spacetime how to curve. In the theory's mathematical formulation, all these quantities are but aspects of a more general physical quantity called the energy–momentum tensor.|$|E
