60|$|But {{there is}} one of these strange {{openings}} in the earth which has a special interest, for it is the handiwork, not of nature, but of man. I had never heard of Blue John when I came to these parts. It is the name given to a peculiar mineral of a beautiful purple shade, which is only found at one or two places in the world. It is so rare that an ordinary vase of Blue John would be valued at a great price. The Romans, with that extraordinary instinct of theirs, discovered that it was to be found in this valley, and sank a horizontal shaft deep into the mountain side. The opening of their mine has been called Blue John Gap, a clean-cut arch in the rock, the mouth all overgrown with bushes. It is a goodly passage which the Roman miners have cut, and it intersects some of the great water-worn caves, so that if you enter Blue John Gap you would do well to mark your steps and to have a good store of candles, or you may never make your way back to the daylight again. I have not yet gone deeply into it, but this very day I stood {{at the mouth of the}} <b>arched</b> <b>tunnel,</b> and peering down into the black recesses beyond, I vowed that when my health returned I would devote some holiday to exploring those mysterious depths and finding out for myself how far the Roman had penetrated into the Derbyshire hills.|$|E

50|$|The Parpaillon Tunnel {{is located}} below the pass at an {{elevation}} of 2637 m.

The station's tiles are colored burgundy to help riders identify their station more easily, part of a tiles scheme conceived for the entire Independent Subway System. As a passenger heads away from downtown Manhattan, {{the colors of the}} tiles change each time an express station is reached. As a result, all of the stations on the Eighth Avenue Line north of 168th Street, the northernmost express station, all share the same burgundy tile colors.|$|E
25|$|There were {{plans to}} run an {{underground}} tram line between South Kensington and the Albert Hall but it was withdrawn in 1891 and a pedestrian only route, the South Kensington subway, was built instead. The Kingsway tramway subway did go ahead - this started in 1902 going from Theobalds Road to the Victoria Embankment. In the 1930s, the <b>arched</b> <b>tunnels</b> were removed to accommodate double decker trams. The last tram using the subway system was 5 April 1952.|$|R

It {{is the key}} {{to success}} or failure of the {{construction}} that we control the ground surface settlement, vault sink and supporting force by the choice of the reasonable construction method in the subway construction process. Based on the project profiles of the tunnel in Nanjing orbit traffic line 1 from South Yan'an road to NingDan road, the article mainly carries on the numerical simulation to construction program by using ANSYS finite element software according to the joint <b>arch</b> <b>tunnel</b> construction of the double and triple arch in the entry end. The article mainly has an analysis from the ground surface settlement, the strata, axial force of supporting structure, bending moment and other aspects. The results show that the program is feasible. The article provids guidance to the future construction of similar projects.

50|$|Pennsylvania Railroad District, {{also known}} as Conrail: Little Juniata River Bridges and Tunnels or Bridges and Tunnels (Spruce Creek to Birmingham Section, Little Juniata River), is a {{national}} historic district located in Spruce Creek Township, Morris Township, and Warriors Mark Township in Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania and Tyrone Township in Blair County, Pennsylvania. It consists of 10 stone arch bridges, two parallel tunnels, and the right-of-way that links them. This 5.15 mile section had the most bridges and tunnels per mile to carry the Pennsylvania Railroad right-of-way. The bridges were built between 1886 and 1902, and are multiple semi-circular arch bridges built of stone ashlar. An original tunnel was built in 1850, and is a 1,151-foot long brick <b>arched</b> <b>tunnel.</b> The parallel tunnel was built in 1900, and is a 1,075-foot long brick-arched tunnel.|$|E
50|$|Other eusocial creatures, such as termites, use pheromones {{to build}} their complex nests by {{following}} a simple decentralized rule set. Each insect scoops up a 'mudball' or similar material from its environment, invests the ball with pheromones, and deposits it on the ground, initially in a random spot. However, termites are attracted to their nestmates' pheromones {{and are therefore more}} likely to drop their own mudballs on top of their neighbors'. The larger the heap of mud becomes, the more attractive it is, and therefore the more mud will be added to it (positive feedback). Over time this leads to the construction of pillars, <b>arches,</b> <b>tunnels</b> and chambers.|$|R

50|$|The {{building}} had a grand entrance with extensive {{windows and a}} glazed roof that could be withdrawn to let the cigar and pipe smoke out. The bar was installed on a balcony over the hall, reached by ascending a grand staircase. The fittings were luxurious, with chandeliers and painted walls. At {{the end of the}} main hall there was a simple stage with a grand piano and harmonium to provide entertainment between the acts. The 'chairman' sat on the stage, introduced the acts, provided his own 'patter' and exhorted the patrons to drink. The entrance fee was 6 pence downstairs, and 9 pence upstairs. Customers sat at small tables, and waiters brought food and drink to them. The 1859 expansion of the viaducts carrying trains to Waterloo railway station separated the theatre entrance from the auditorium, and patrons entered through a long <b>arched</b> <b>tunnel</b> under the railway, entertained by an aquarium. In 1861, Blondin walked a tightrope fixed between the balconies of the hall.|$|E
50|$|James Prinsep {{continued}} {{to take an}} interest in architecture at Benares. With his eyesight restored, he studied and illustrated temple architecture, designed the new mint building at Benares as well as a church. In 1822 he conducted a survey of Benares and produced an accurate map at the scale of 8 inches to a mile. This map was lithographed in England. He also painted a series of watercolours of monuments and festivities in Benares which were sent to London in 1829 and published between 1830 and 1834 as Benares Illustrated, in a Series of Drawings. He helped design an <b>arched</b> <b>tunnel</b> to drain stagnant lakes and improve the sanitation of the densely populated areas of Benares and built a stone bridge over the Karamansa river. He helped restore the minarets of Aurangzeb which were in a state of collapse. When he moved to Calcutta, he offered to help complete a canal that had been planned by his brother Thomas but left incomplete by the latter's death in 1830. Thomas's canal linked the River Hooghly with branches of the Ganges further to the east.|$|E

At that time, an ornate brick-faced train shed abutted its western side where the parking lot is today. Trains entered the shed through four <b>arched</b> <b>tunnels</b> at the curvilinear-gabled ends. A tower capped with a tent spire supported the southwest corner opposite the tower on the station. The building has two square towers, one at each of its southern corners, each with two double windows {{on both sides of}} the first two floors and four on the third floor. The towers rise above the mass of the building, capped with mansard roofs, at one time having both chimneys and round ornamented skylights.|$|R
