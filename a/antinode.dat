25|$|This {{relationship}} {{means that}} certain key features {{can be observed}} in both drum membrane modes and atomic orbitals. For example, in all of the modes analogous to sorbitals (the top row in the animated illustration below), {{it can be seen that}} the very center of the drum membrane vibrates most strongly, corresponding to the <b>antinode</b> in all sorbitals in an atom. This <b>antinode</b> means the electron is most likely to be at the physical position of the nucleus (which it passes straight through without scattering or striking it), since it is moving (on average) most rapidly at that point, giving it maximal momentum.|$|E
25|$|None of {{the other}} sets of modes in a drum {{membrane}} have a central <b>antinode,</b> and {{in all of them}} the center of the drum does not move. These correspond to a node at the nucleus for all non-s orbitals in an atom. These orbitals all have some angular momentum, and in the planetary model, they correspond to particles in orbit with eccentricity less than 1.0, so that they do not pass straight {{through the center of the}} primary body, but keep somewhat away from it.|$|E

If the end of the spring is oscillated at the resonant frequency of one of the standing wave modes of the Slinky, a standing wave will be created, as shown in Figure 1. Pressure nodes and <b>antinodes</b> are marked on the standing wave. The pressure nodes shown are displacement <b>antinodes,</b> and the pressure <b>antinodes</b> are displacement nodes...|$|R

2500|$|The sum of two counter-propagating waves (of equal {{amplitude}} and frequency) {{creates a}} standing wave. [...] Standing waves commonly arise when a boundary blocks further propagation of the wave, thus causing wave reflection, and therefore introducing a counter-propagating wave. [...] For example, when a violin string is displaced, transverse waves propagate {{out to where}} the string is held {{in place at the}} bridge and the nut, where the waves are reflected back. [...] At the bridge and nut, the two opposed waves are in antiphase and cancel each other, producing a node. Halfway between two nodes there is an <b>antinode,</b> where the two counter-propagating waves enhance each other maximally. There is no net propagation of energy over time.|$|E

40|$|Bubbles stabilised by {{colloidal}} particles can find applications in advanced materials, catalysis and drug delivery. For applications in controlled release, {{it is desirable}} to remove the particles from the interface in a programmable fashion. We have previously shown that ultrasound waves excite volumetric oscillations of particle-coated bubbles, resulting in precisely timed particle expulsion due to interface compression on a ultrafast timescale [Poulichet et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 2015, 112, 5932]. We also observed shape oscillations, which were found to drive directional particle expulsion from the <b>antinodes</b> of the non-spherical deformation. In this paper we investigate the mechanisms leading to directional particle expulsion during shape oscillations of particle-coated bubbles driven by ultrasound at 40 kHz. We perform high-speed visualisation of the interface shape and of the particle distribution during ultrafast deformation {{at a rate of}} up to 105 s ??? 1. The mode of shape oscillations is found to not depend on the bubble size, in contrast with what has been reported for uncoated bubbles. A decomposition of the non-spherical shape in spatial Fourier modes reveals that the interplay of different modes determines the locations of particle expulsion. The n-fold symmetry of the dominant mode does not always lead to desorption from all 2 n <b>antinodes,</b> but only those where there is favourable alignment with the sub-dominant modes. Desorption from the <b>antinodes</b> of the shape oscillations is due to different, concurrent mechanisms. The radial acceleration of the interface at the <b>antinodes</b> can be up to 105 ??? 106 ms??? 2, hence there is a contribution from the inertia of the particles localised at the <b>antinodes.</b> In addition, we found that particles migrate to the <b>antinodes</b> of the shape oscillation, thereby enhancing the contribution from the surface pressure in the monolayer...|$|R

50|$|This {{relationship}} {{means that}} certain key features {{can be observed}} in both drum membrane modes and atomic orbitals. For example, in all of the modes analogous to s orbitals (the top row in the animated illustration below), {{it can be seen that}} the very center of the drum membrane vibrates most strongly, corresponding to the <b>antinode</b> in all s orbitals in an atom. This <b>antinode</b> means the electron is most likely to be at the physical position of the nucleus (which it passes straight through without scattering or striking it), since it is moving (on average) most rapidly at that point, giving it maximal momentum.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} an experimentally efficient {{procedure that}} allows {{the determination of the}} location of the nodes and <b>antinodes</b> of a complicated structure. The approach is based on attaching a virtual element, either a virtual lumped mass or a virtual grounded spring, to the system of interest and analyzing the free vibration of the assembled system {{as a function of the}} location or co-ordinate of the virtual element. When the frequency curves of the assembled system are plotted against the constraint location of the virtual element, the nodes and <b>antinodes</b> of the structure of interest can be extracted by examining the minima or maxima of the curves. For the virtual lumped mass, the nodes and <b>antinodes</b> correspond to the maxima and minima of the frequency curves, respectively, while for the virtual spring, they correspond instead to the minima and maxima of the frequency curves...|$|R

40|$|Inverse Chladni patterns, i. e., grains {{collecting}} at the <b>antinodes</b> of a resonating plate, {{are traditionally}} believed to occur {{only when the}} particles are small enough to be carried along by the ambient air. We now show—theoretically and numerically—that air currents {{are not the only}} mechanism leading to inverse patterns: When the acceleration of the resonating plate does not exceed g, particles will always roll to the <b>antinodes,</b> irrespective of their size, {{even in the absence of}} air. We also explain why this effect has hitherto escaped detection in standard Chladni experiment...|$|R

50|$|The {{collapsed}} bubble expands {{due to high}} {{internal pressure}} and experiences a diminishing effect until the high pressure <b>antinode</b> returns {{to the center of}} the vessel. The bubble continues to occupy more or less the same space due to the acoustic radiation force, the Bjerknes force, and the buoyancy force of the bubble.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Working {{mechanism}} of a valveless pulse jet engine. The basic {{idea is that}} the column of air in the long exhaust pipe functions like the piston of a reciprocating engine. From another point of view, the engine is an acoustic resonator internally excited by resonating combustions in the chamber. The chamber acts as a pressure <b>antinode</b> which is compressed by the returning wave. The intake pipe acts as a kinematic <b>antinode</b> which sucks and exhausts gas. Note the longer length of the exhaust pipe—this is important as it prevents oxygen from entering the wrong way and igniting the system the wrong way. It does this because when the pulse ignites, there is still some exhaust gas in the exhaust pipe. That is sucked in before any additional oxygen is sucked in. Of course, the air intake pipe has already supplied the oxygen by that point and the pulse reignites.|$|E
40|$|A noisy {{disc brake}} vibrates in a wavelike manner with a {{diametral}} mode of vibration. The mode shape exhibits <b>antinodes</b> with angular spacing {{of a specific}} size related to the noise frequency and mode order. The sizes of the <b>antinodes</b> vary slightly with brake pressure which causes a slight change in noise frequency. If the angular spacing of the callipers is arranged such that an integer of <b>antinodes</b> between the callipers is not possible then the disc is inhibited from vibrating in a given mode and noise at that frequency is prevented. The paper demonstrates that at particular angular settings of the callipers certain frequencies exist yet as the angular settings are changed the disc mode order and related frequency changes. It is shown that the frequencies {{can be related to}} the angular spacing between the callipers and the free mode angular spacing of the disc waveform <b>antinodes.</b> An analysis of the geometry allowed the brake noise frequency to be predicted for a certain angular setting of the callipers and specific angular settings to be predicted when the brake would be quiet. It is shown that this analysis was successfully applied in practice on the test rig and on the problematic vehicle. It is shown that the theory may be extended to single calliper brakes and adjustment of the pad/disc interface geometry...|$|R

Due to the spatial homogeneity of the exciting field along the used microstrip antenna, quantized spin-wave modes with an even number n of <b>antinodes</b> across the stripe's width cannot be directly excited. We show that a break in translational symmetry {{may result in a}} partial conversion of even spin-wave waveguide mode...|$|R
50|$|The angle {{between two}} {{adjacent}} <b>antinode</b> - nodes is 45 degrees. One of the elliptical resonant modes is excited to a prescribed amplitude. When the device rotates about its sensitive axis (along its inner stem), the resulting Coriolis forces {{acting on the}} resonator’s vibrating mass elements excite the second resonant mode. The angle between major axes of the two modes is also 45 degrees.|$|E
50|$|In radio {{engineering}} and telecommunications, {{standing wave ratio}} (SWR) {{is a measure of}} impedance matching of loads to the characteristic impedance of a transmission line or waveguide. Impedance mismatches result in standing waves along the transmission line, and SWR is defined as the ratio of the partial standing wave's amplitude at an <b>antinode</b> (maximum) to the amplitude at a node (minimum) along the line.|$|E

When used to eliminate standing waves, the ferrite sheath current filter must be placed at a current <b>antinode,</b> but not at standing wave nodes.|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the issue of the aeroacoustic source location within corrugated pipes. A configuration with a short pipe and well defined boundary conditions has been chosen, in order to have a precise knowledge of the distribution of the acoustic velocity and pressure within the pipe. The source locations have been investigated methodologically by using straight pipe segments to replace the corrugated section near the acoustic velocity nodes or near the acoustic velocity <b>antinodes.</b> The main locations of the sound sources have been identified to be the sections of the corrugated pipe near the acoustic velocity <b>antinodes.</b> Copyright © 2010 by ASME...|$|R
50|$|When {{the ends}} of the pipe are sealed and a {{flammable}} gas is pumped into the device, the escaping gas can be lit to form a row of flames of roughly equal size. When sound is applied from one end by means of a loudspeaker, internal pressure will change {{along the length of the}} tube. If the sound is of a frequency that produces standing waves, the wavelength will be visible in the series of flames, with the tallest flames occurring at pressure nodes, and the lowest flames occurring at pressure <b>antinodes.</b> The pressure <b>antinodes</b> correspond to the locations with the highest amount of compression and rarefaction.|$|R
50|$|The {{resonator}} {{is operated}} in its second-order resonant mode. The Q-factor is usually about 20,000; that pre-determines its noise and angular random walks. Standing waves are elliptically-shaped oscillations with four <b>antinodes</b> and four nodes located circumferentially along the rim.|$|R
50|$|In {{cases where}} the two {{opposite}} wave trains {{are not the same}} amplitude, they do not cancel perfectly, so the amplitude of the standing wave at the nodes is not zero but merely a minimum. This occurs when the reflection at the boundary is imperfect. This is indicated by a finite standing wave ratio (SWR), the ratio of the amplitude of the wave at the <b>antinode</b> to the amplitude at the node.|$|E
50|$|Overtones with a {{frequency}} of {{a multiple of}} the intended overtone (i.e. its own harmonics) will share the nodes of the lower overtone, so they won't be muted. They will, however, be {{at a much lower}} volume, and since they form the selected overtone's own harmonic series, they don't detract from the sound of the note. If the string is pinched at the <b>antinode</b> of the intended overtone, no higher overtones will sound.|$|E
50|$|Once {{a single}} bubble is {{stabilized}} in the pressure <b>antinode</b> of the standing wave, {{it can be}} made to emit pulses of light by driving the bubble into highly nonlinear oscillations. This is done by the increasing pressure of the acoustic wave to disrupt the steady, linear growth of the bubble which cause the bubble to collapse in a runaway reaction that only reverts due to the high pressures inside the bubble at its minimum radius.|$|E

Structured light patterns are projected at an angle onto the vibrating surface using a 35 mm slide projector. The vibrating surface and the projected images are captured in a time averaged photograph which is subsequently digitized. The inherent fringe patterns are filtered to determine amplitudes of vibration, and computer programs are used to compare the time averaged images to images recorded prior to excitation to locate nodes and <b>antinodes.</b> Some of the influences of pattern regularity on digital correlation are demonstrated, and a speckle-based method for determining the mode shapes and the amplitudes of vibration with variable sensitivity is suggested...|$|R
40|$|The {{renormalization}} of quasiparticle (QP) dispersion in bilayer high-T_c cuprates is investigated theoretically {{by examining}} respectively {{the interactions of}} the QP with spin fluctuations (SF) and phonons. It is illustrated that both interactions are able to {{give rise to a}} kink in the dispersion around the <b>antinodes</b> (near (π, 0)). However, remarkable differences between the two cases are found for the peak/dip/hump structure in the lineshape, the QP weight, and the interlayer coupling effect on the kink, which are suggested to serve as a discriminance to single out the dominant interaction in the superconducting state. A comparison to recent photoemission experiments shows clearly that the coupling to the spin resonance is dominant for the QP around <b>antinodes</b> in bilayer systems.
