Ambient air is typically compressed in stages, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> temperature rises during each stage. Intercoolers and water cooling heat exchangers can remove this heat between stages.|$|E

5|$|This formula neglects the {{cracking}} pressure required to open both {{first and second}} stages of the regulator, and pressure drop due to flow restrictions in the regulator, {{both of which are}} variable depending on the design and adjustment of the regulator, and flow rate, which depends on the breathing pattern of the diver <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> in use. These factors are not easily estimated, so the calculated value for breathing duration will be more than the real value.|$|E
5|$|Few inmates {{remained}} in the camp after the gassings stopped, mostly non-Jewish {{women who had been}} married to Jews. They were released several days later, after being sworn to secrecy. Apart from Sajmište inmates, the 500 patients and staff of the Belgrade Jewish Hospital, as well as Jewish prisoners from the nearby Banjica concentration camp, were also killed in the gas van. The last Jewish prisoner in Sajmište was killed on 8 May 1942, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> van used at the camp was returned to Berlin on 9 June 1942. It received a technical upgrade there, and was then transferred to Belarus where it was used to gas Jews in Minsk. Shortly after leading the extermination of the Jewish inmates in Sajmište, Andorfer and Enge were assigned different Security Police roles. Andorfer later received an Iron Cross 2nd Class for running the camp, and won a promotion.|$|E
5|$|Holocaust deniers {{claim that}} Zyklon B gas {{was not used}} in the gas chambers, relying for {{evidence}} on the research of Fred A. Leuchter, who found low levels of Prussian blue in samples of the gas chamber walls and ceilings. Leuchter attributed its presence to general delousing of the buildings. Leuchter's negative control, a sample of gasket material taken from a different camp building, had no cyanide residue. In 1999, James Roth, the chemist who had analyzed Leuchter's samples, stated that the test was flawed because the material that was sent for testing included large chunks, and the chemical would only be within 10 microns of the surface. The surface that {{had been exposed to}} the chemical was not identified, and the large size of the specimens meant that any chemical present was diluted by an undeterminable amount. In 1994, the Institute for Forensic Research in Kraków re-examined Leuchter's claim, stating that formation of Prussian blue by exposure of bricks to cyanide is not a highly probable reaction. Using microdiffusion techniques, they tested 22 samples from the gas chambers and delousing chambers (as positive controls) and living quarters (as negative controls). They found cyanide residue in both the delousing chambers <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> chambers but none in the living quarters.|$|E

25|$|The {{disadvantage}} of hermetic compressors {{is that the}} motor drive cannot be repaired or maintained, and the entire compressor must be replaced if a motor fails.
