In the early 19th century, Uxbridge had an unsavoury reputation; the jurist William Arabin said of its residents [...] "They will steal the very teeth {{out of your mouth}} <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> through the streets. I know it from experience." [...] For about 200 years most of London's flour was produced in the Uxbridge area.|$|E

[...] The other, in the Parham chapel, is of Thomas Bishop (d. 1559), the first of the family to lease the rectory. [...] Also in the Parham chapel is a monument to Thomas's grandson Henry Bishop, the Postmaster General.

Except at the entrance, it is surrounded by water: for two canals branch off from the river, and run {{as far as the}} entrance to the temple: yet neither canal mingles with the other, but one runs on this side, and the other on that. Each canal is a hundred feet wide, and its banks are lined with trees. The propylaea are sixty feet in height, and are adorned with sculptures (probably intaglios in relief) nine feet high, and of excellent workmanship. The Temple being {{in the middle of the}} city is looked down upon from all sides <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> around; and this comes from the city having been raised, whereas the temple itself has not been moved, but remains in its original place. Quite round the temple there goes a wall, adorned with sculptures. Within the inclosure is a grove of fair tall trees, planted around a large building in which is the effigy (of Bast). The form of that temple is square, each side being a stadium in length. In a line with the entrance is a road built of stone about three stadia long, leading eastwards through the public market. The road is about [...] broad, and is flanked by exceeding tall trees. It leads to the temple of Hermes." ...|$|E

Here, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>walked</b> along a path which led through a thicket, you fell into a cunningly-laid ambush, and became a target for a body of musketeers, whose tattooed limbs you could just see peeping into view through the foliage.
