500|$|During the 2007 San Diego Comic-Con International, 42 Entertainment {{launched}} WhySoSerious.com, sending fans on a scavenger hunt {{to unlock}} a teaser trailer {{and a new}} photo of the Joker. On October 31, 2007, the film's website morphed into another scavenger hunt with hidden messages, instructing fans to uncover clues at certain locations in major cities throughout the United States, and to take photographs of their discoveries. The clues combined to reveal a new photograph of the Joker and an <b>audio</b> <b>clip</b> of him from the film saying [...] "And tonight, you're gonna break your one rule." [...] Completing the scavenger hunt also led to another website called Rory's Death Kiss (referencing the false working title of Rory's First Kiss), where fans could submit photographs of themselves costumed as the Joker. Those who sent photos were mailed {{a copy of a}} fictional newspaper called The Gotham Times, whose electronic version led to the discovery of numerous other websites.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by John Swartzwelder and {{directed}} by David Silverman. When the episode was originally planned, it called for Albert Brooks to voice [...] "Björn", a Swedish tennis instructor, but Brooks {{thought it would be}} funnier to make the character French and so the change was made. The title was originally to be [...] "Bjorn to Be Wild", thus accounting for the episode's alternate title [...] "Jacques to Be Wild". Brooks improvised almost all of his dialogue, producing over three hours of material. Marge's laugh during her bowling lesson was an ad-libbed, natural laugh by Julie Kavner, who was laughing at something Albert Brooks had just said. The line [...] "four onion rings!" [...] was one of the many lines that Brooks ad-libbed and when saying it, Jacques loses his French accent. An extended <b>audio</b> <b>clip</b> of Albert Brooks' unused dialogue was made available on Disc Three of The Simpsons The Complete First Season DVD.|$|E
500|$|The song {{begins with}} a short call-and-response <b>audio</b> <b>clip</b> from The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour as Beyoncé asks the crowd [...] "Lemme hear you say 'Hayyy Ms. Carter!'". It then {{transitions}} into what Andrew Hampp of Billboard magazine called the [...] "lady thug anthem" [...] of [...] "Yoncé". Beyoncé delivers half-rapped verses on {{the first half of}} the song, in which the female protagonist teases male subjects in a club as she turns heads. In the first verse, she warns the other women in the club, [...] "Every girl on here gotta look me up and down / All on Instagram cake by the pound". The singer adds on the second verse, [...] "I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker." [...] "Yoncé" [...] closes with the bridge as Beyoncé sings repeatedly, [...] "Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor", while an ascending siren echoes over a staccato bass that hits heavily and uniformly in the background.|$|E

500|$|Savage sued CAIR for {{copyright}} infringement {{for using}} excerpts from his show on CAIR's website. The suit alleged that CAIR's repackaging of Savage's comments was [...] "deliberately designed {{to obscure the}} specific message conveyed by Michael Savage". The excerpts included Savage's characterization of the Qur'an as [...] "a throwback document" [...] and a [...] "book of hate". CAIR called the suit [...] "bizarre, sloppy and baseless". On July 25, 2008, the United States district court dismissed Savage's suit against CAIR, holding that the posting of the <b>audio</b> <b>clip</b> was protected under the First Amendment doctrine of fair use, as {{it was used to}} [...] "comment on and rebut derogatory statements regarding their organization and their religious affiliations." [...] The court gave Savage the opportunity to file an amended complaint if he wanted to try to cure the defects in his suit. That amended complaint alleged that CAIR was a RICO conspirator in support of terror, including the 9/11 terror attack on the World Trade Center. Permission was granted to allow that filing but on August 14, 2008, however, Savage's lawyer, Daniel Horowitz, announced that Savage would not file an amended complaint and would drop the case. CAIR then sought attorneys fees against Savage but U.S. District Court judge Susan Illston denied that request.|$|E
