40|$|This study {{presents}} an autocorrelation function-based program of dynamic image recognition and <b>automatic</b> <b>alarm.</b> Lighting effect analysis, binarization {{of the dynamic}} image and other methods were used to enhance the image; a dynamic image autocorrelation function was established to determine the threshold of <b>automatic</b> <b>alarm</b> system; and using Matlab software a simulation experiment {{was conducted on the}} autocorrelation function. The experiment showed that the correlation function value is inversely proportional to the amount of change of the video surveillance image; the autocorrelation function value can be used to determine when to trigger the <b>automatic</b> <b>alarm</b> system. This dynamic image recognition program, characterized by strong stability and little impact from the outside, can be used for <b>automatic</b> <b>alarm</b> of monitoring system...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Fire {{disaster}} {{is a great}} threat to lives and property. <b>Automatic</b> fire <b>alarm</b> system provides real-time surveillance, monitoring and <b>automatic</b> <b>alarm.</b> It sends early alarm when the fire occurs and helps to reduce the fire damage. Wireless sensor network {{has become the most}} important technology in environmental monitoring and home or factory automation in recent years. In this paper, an <b>automatic</b> fire <b>alarm</b> system based on wireless sensor networks is developed, which is designed for high-rise buildings. In order to provide early extinguishing of a fire disaster, large numbers of detectors which periodically measure smoke concentration or temperature are deployed in buildings. Those scattered detectors report their monitoring information to the surveillance center via the self-organizing hierarchical wireless sensor networks. Test results from the prototype system show that the <b>automatic</b> fire <b>alarm</b> system achieves the design requirements.
