5|$|<b>At</b> <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>in</b> Paris in 1914, Piłsudski presciently {{declared}} {{that in the}} impending war, for Poland to regain independence, Russia must be beaten by the Central Powers (the Austro-Hungarian and German Empires), and the latter powers must in their turn be beaten by France, Britain and the United States. By contrast, Roman Dmowski, Piłsudski's rival, believed {{that the best way}} to achieve a unified and independent Poland was to support the Triple Entente against the Central Powers.|$|E

Reshen advised Jennings to keep the beard that he had grown in the hospital, to match the image of Outlaw Country.|$|E

5|$|When Æthelred made a {{grant to}} Berkeley Abbey in 883, {{he did it with}} the {{approval}} of King Alfred, thus acknowledging Alfred's lordship. Thereafter he usually acted with Alfred's permission, but issued some charters in his own name without reference to Alfred, such as <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>in</b> Risborough in Buckinghamshire in 884, showing that English Mercia extended quite far south-east towards London.|$|E
5|$|After {{the cathedral}} in Gamla Uppsala was damaged by fire in 1204, the Chapter sought {{permission}} from the Holy See to move the building to a larger site. Pope Alexander IV granted this request in 1258 on condition that the name of Uppsala be maintained. <b>At</b> <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>in</b> Söderköping in September 1270, Archbishop Fulco Angelus and the cathedral chapter decided the site should be in Östra Aros. Formal authorization of the move was issued in 1271 by Bishop Carolus of Västerås whom the Pope had appointed to oversee the case.|$|E

5|$|Applewhite and Nettles sent {{advertisements}} {{to groups}} in California and {{were invited to}} speak to New Age devotees there in April 1975. At this meeting, they persuaded {{about half of the}} 50 attendees to follow them. They also focused on college campuses, speaking at Cañada College in August. <b>At</b> <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>in</b> Oregon in September 1975, they saw further recruitment success—about 30 people left their homes to follow the pair, prompting interest from media outlets. The coverage was negative: commentators and some former members mocked the group and leveled accusations of brainwashing against Applewhite and Nettles. Balch and Taylor state that Applewhite and Nettles eschewed pressure tactics, seeking only devoted followers.|$|E
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>in</b> Saigon on 13 March President Thiệu {{was briefed}} on the {{military}} situation by Trưởng and the new III Corps commander, Lieutenant General Nguyễn Văn Toàn.

Trưởng was shocked to discover, however, that the Airborne Division was to be removed to III Corps (unknown to Trưởng at the time, the Marine Division was also already slated for redeployment with both units then forming a new national reserve).|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1992 Parry favoured a deal with ITV, but thought the network {{should be prepared to}} pay up towards £30 million for live football. <b>At</b> <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>in</b> January 1992, Dyke made it clear ITV would not be positioned as they were already paying too much for football. He and executive director Trevor East commented on BSkyB's debt and felt the company would be forced to increase their borrowing if they were awarded a contract. This did not dissuade Quinton, who urged Murdoch to bid. Quinton even informed Chisholm that there were no bidding rules.|$|E

5|$|IUPAC and UNESCO {{were the}} lead {{organizations}} coordinating events for the International Year of Chemistry, {{which took place}} in 2011. The International Year of Chemistry was originally proposed by IUPAC at the general assembly in Turin, Italy. This motion was adopted by UNESCO <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>in</b> 2008. The main objectives of the International Year of Chemistry were to increase public appreciation of chemistry and gain more interest in the world of chemistry. This event is also being held to encourage young people to get involved and contribute to chemistry. A further reason for this event being held is to honour how chemistry has made improvements to everyone's way of life.|$|E
5|$|In mid-July, Dragan Vasiljković was {{deployed}} {{from the}} Croatian Serb capital Knin to Banovina to coordinate rebel forces there. By 21 July, {{his work was}} commended by local commanders, and two days later, a regional command of Croatian Serb forces was announced <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>in</b> Dvor attended by Milan Martić, {{one of the most}} prominent SAO Krajina leaders. On 24 July, one day after the regional command was established, the Serb rebels adopted a military plan, presented by Vasiljković, aimed at removing Croatian forces from Banovina. On 25 July, 14 mortar rounds were fired at the Kozibrod police station. Nobody was injured in the attack, and in its aftermath, SAO Krajina authorities requested a ceasefire until 10 August because of the harvest.|$|E
5|$|The Liverpool Women's Suffrage Society {{was set up}} in 1894 <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>in</b> January at the temperance hall in Hardman Street.

5|$|The {{position}} that the general strike could be used, but {{only as a last}} resort, became dominant in the party during the mass strike debate. This caused much concern among the conservatives in the party, especially among many trade unionists. <b>At</b> <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>in</b> February 1906, the trade unionists were placated by party leaders, who said they would attempt to prevent a general strike at all costs. The FVdG reacted by publishing the secret protocols from the meeting in Die Einigkeit, greatly angering the party leadership.|$|E
5|$|As summer approached, Đujić's Chetniks {{captured}} Drvar {{from the}} Ustaše. By early summer, he and Chetnik commander Stevo Rađenović had contacted the Italians {{and asked them}} to put a halt to the Ustaše mistreatment of Serbs, enable the return of Serb refugees, and repeal a decree that enabled the confiscation of Serb-owned property in the NDH. The Italians obliged in the hope that doing so would win the Chetniks over to collaboration and seriously weaken any future uprising in the area, which would have further disrupted rail traffic along the Split–Karlovac line. On 13 August, <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>in</b> the village of Pađene, Đujić and several other Serb nationalists agreed to collaborate with the Italians. They secretly signed a pact of non-aggression with the Italian military, and in exchange, the Italians acquiesced to Đujić's 3,000 Chetniks operating in and around Knin. On 31 August, at a Drvar assembly, Đujić was given the task of stopping the Italian advance on the town. Immediately afterwards, he made an agreement with the Italians granting them free passage.|$|E
5|$|Breathitt did not fare as well {{in state}} politics. He ardently {{supported}} Jacksonian principles, and wielded his veto against bills critical of President Jackson's land policy. He supported Jackson's desire to dissolve the Second Bank of the United States. Instead, he favored opening a number of state banks, but faced with a Whig majority in the legislature, he succeeded only in chartering the Louisville Bank of Kentucky. He also favored completion of the Lexington and Ohio Railroad, and supported a $300,000 loan from the state Board of Internal Improvements for that purpose. In 1833, a loan for half the amount was approved, and the railroad was not completed until 1851. Breathitt was {{also part of the}} temperance movement in Kentucky. In an 1832 address, he blamed consumption of alcohol for the high murder rate in the state. When the Kentucky Legislative Temperance Society was formed <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>in</b> the state house on January 13, 1834, Breathitt was chosen as its president and Lieutenant Governor Morehead served as one of five vice-presidents.|$|E

5|$|Bush {{soon became}} {{dissatisfied}} with the dilatory way the project was run, with its indecisiveness over the selection of sites for the pilot plants. He was particularly disturbed at the allocation of an AA-3 priority, which would delay completion of the pilot plants by three months. Bush complained about these problems to Bundy and Under Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson. Major General Brehon B. Somervell, {{the commander of the}} army's Services of Supply, appointed Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves as project director in September. Within days of taking over, Groves approved the proposed site at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and obtained a AAA priority. <b>At</b> <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>in</b> Stimson's office on September 23 attended by Bundy, Bush, Conant, Groves, Marshall Somervell and Stimson, Bush put forward his proposal for steering the project by a small committee answerable to the Top Policy Group. The meeting agreed with Bush, and created a Military Policy Committee chaired by him, with Somervell's chief of staff, Brigadier General Wilhelm D. Styer, representing the army, and Rear Admiral William R. Purnell representing the navy.|$|E
5|$|Efforts {{to amend}} the Official Languages Act {{according}} to Shastri's assurances given in February 1965 faced stiff resistance from the pro-Hindi lobby. On 16 February 55 MPs from 8 different states publicly expressed their disapproval of {{any change in the}} Language policy. On 19 February 19 MPs from Maharashtra and Gujarat voiced their opposition for change and on 25 February 106 Congress MPs met the Prime Minister to request him not {{to amend the}} Act. However, Congress MPs from Madras did not debate the issue on the Parliament floor but met the Prime Minister on 12 March. Congress and opposition parties hesitated to debate the issue in Parliament as they did not wish to make their bitter divisions in public. On 22 February <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>in</b> Congress Working Committee, K. Kamaraj pressed for the amendment to Official Languages Act, but received instant opposition from Morarji Desai, Jagjivan Ram and Ram Subhag. The Congress working committee finally agreed to a resolution which amounted to slowing down of Hindi-isation, strong implementation of the three language formula in Hindi and non-Hindi speaking states, and conduct of the public services exam in all regional languages. These decisions were agreed upon during the Chief Ministers' meeting which was held on 24 February.|$|E
5|$|In France, the {{unilateral}} British {{decision to}} evacuate through Dunkirk rather than counter-attack to the south, {{and the perceived}} preference of the Royal Navy for evacuating British forces {{at the expense of}} the French, led to some bitter resentment. According to Churchill, French Admiral François Darlan originally ordered that the British forces should receive preference, but on 31 May, he intervened <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>in</b> Paris to order that the evacuation should proceed on equal terms and that the British would form the rearguard. In fact, the 35,000 men who finally surrendered after covering the final evacuations were mostly French soldiers of 2nd Light Mechanized Division and the 68th Infantry Division. Their resistance allowed the evacuation effort to be extended to 4 June, on which date another 26,175 Frenchmen were transported to England.|$|E
