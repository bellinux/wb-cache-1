50|$|An {{alternating}} {{cycle of}} fumarolic activity, {{an accumulation of}} fumarolic gases in the conduit and lava dome, explosive activity followed by renewed fumarolic activity has characterized Lascar's activity since 1984. Explosive activity presumably occurs when gases can no longer escape. This occurs because as the magma loses its gas content, the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>pores</b> <b>in</b> it and thus the permeability to gas decrease. Further, fractures permitting gas passage are obstructed when the magma contracts. During most of the time, numerous fumaroles within the crater form a plume that reaches an altitude of 1000 m. During minor explosive eruptions, eruption columns reach heights {{of no more than}} 5000 m. The temperatures of the lava dome can reach 148 - 367 C. This cycle ended after 1993, probably because the April 1993 eruption modified the conditions in the volcanic system. Alternatively, the cycle may have continued, to reach another lava dome collapse stage in early 2003. While eruptions before 1993 had always been preceded by a reduction in heat radiated from the volcano, such a reduction in 1999-2000 did not lead to an eruption, and when an eruption took place in July 2000, it was preceded by only a brief drop in heat radiation.|$|E
40|$|Porous NiTi {{samples were}} {{produced}} by two different techniques, Mechanical Alloying & Hot Pressing (MA&HP) and Reaction Synthesis (RS), followed by secondary Pulse Electric Current (PEC) treatment. The samples {{were analyzed by}} Ultra Small Angle Neutron Scattering and Computed Microtomography {{before and after the}} secondary treatment in order to investigate porosity of the samples. For the samples produced by MA&HP, PEC treatment does not cause any changes in pore size distribution for smaller pores (i. e. < 10 ??m). For bigger pores, however, treatment leads to a decrease of the pore volume along with the reduction of the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>pores.</b> <b>In</b> samples processed by RS, PEC treatment led to a decrease in pore dimensions of smaller pores (up to 10 ??m), while for larger pores PEC treatment resulted in an increase in pore dimensions. Thus, the influence of secondary PEC treatment on the porosity of NiTi samples produced by the two different techniques could be confirmed and compared. Due to the pioneering character of the present work, further studies are required before using PEC treatment in future for porosity modification in a controlled manner...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with a micro-analysis {{of the use of}} rare-earth (RE) and TiH 2 in the fabrication of iron-based diamond segments. Together with the measurements of the wear resistance of diamond impregnated segments on a specially designed device, an optical microscope, a scanning electronic microscope and an X-ray spectrometer were used to evaluate the sintering with RE and/or TiH 2. It was found that the size and the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>pores</b> <b>in</b> the iron-based metal bond decreased due to an addition of 0. 8 % RE rich with Ce. A metallic layer was formed on the surfaces of diamond particles embedded in the RE containing matrix, indicating a good bonding between the diamond particles and the bond matrix. The wear resistance of the diamond impregnated segments were consequently increased due to the addition of RE. However, it was surprisingly found that more pores were formed in the iron-based bond and more serious graphitization was generated on diamond particles due to an addition of 2 %TiH 2, which might be attributed to the formation of TiO 2 prior to the formation of TiC...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} {{research}} work, {{attempts were made to}} develop and evaluate Sustained release formulation of Metoprolol succinate based on osmotic technology. As Metoprolol is a short acting drug, developed formulation provides the advantages of controlled release formulations. The developed formulation provides advantages of less steps of manufacturing procedure, no need of laser drilling, and economical. All of these made the procedure easily amenable to mass production using conventional tablet machines. Metoprolol 50 mg core formulation was prepared using osmogents and coated with different coating formulae to optimize film former (cellulose acetate) : pore former (sorbitol) ratio. The effect of different formulation variables namely, membrane weight gain, and <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>pore</b> former <b>in</b> the membrane, were studied. Metoprolol release was inversely proportional to the membrane weight (coating thickness) but directly related to the initial <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>pore</b> former (sorbitol) <b>in</b> the membrane. All polymers and excipients used in optimized formula were found to be compatible with the drug and it was confirmed by FT-IR studies. Drug release from the developed formulations was independent of pH and agitational intensity. The drug release from formulation was proved as dependent on osmotic pressure only. The number <b>of</b> <b>pores</b> was directly proportional to the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>pore</b> former <b>in</b> the membrane.

These films were then annealed at 170 A degrees C above glass transition (T-g) temperature of PS. Fluorescence quenching measurements were performed for each film separately to evaluate the effect of MWNT content on oxygen diffusion. The Stern-Volmer equation for fluorescence quenching is combined with Fick's law for diffusion to derive the mathematical expressions. Diffusion coefficients (D) were produced and found to be increased from 1. 1 x 10 (- 12) to 41 x 10 (- 12) cm(2) s(- 1) with increasing MWNT content.

40|$|In {{consideration}} of the insolubility in water, sensitivity to heat and wide application in {{the oil and gas}} industry as a degradable additive, this paper introduces polylactic acid (PLA) to a self-degradable temporary sealing material (SDTSM) to investigate its effect on the SDTSM performance and evaluate its potential to improve the rheological properties and further promote the self-degradation of the material. The thermal degradation of PLA, the rheological properties, compressive strength, hydrated products and water absorption of SDTSMs with different PLA dosages were tested. The analysis showed that the addition of 2 % PLA increased the fluidity by 13. 18 % and reduced the plastic viscosity by 38. 04 %, when compared to those of the SDTSM without PLA. PLA increased the water absorption of 200 °C-heated SDTSM and had small effect on the types but decreased the hydrate products of 85 °C-cured SDTSM, and created plenty of pores in 200 °C-heated SDTSM. PLA enhanced the self-degradation level of SDTSM by generating a large <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>pores</b> <b>in</b> cement. These pores worked in two ways: one was such a large amount of pores led to a looser microstructure; the other was these pores made the water impregnate the cement more easily, and then made the dissolution of substances in the 200 °C-heated SDTSM progress faster to generate heat and to destruct the microstructure. self-degradable temporary sealing material; geothermal wells; polylactic acid; rheological properties; self-degradatio...|$|E
40|$|Porosity may {{be harmful}} for the {{properties}} of thin films. Depositing dense films is often {{the aim of the}} technological development, although there are also applications requiring adjusting a special <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>pores</b> <b>in</b> the film. In thin films, the pore dimension is in the sub-micrometer range so that detecting the pores is difficult. The laser-acoustic technique is shown to be able to indicate an enhanced porosity in thin films. It is based on surface acoustic waves and yields Young's modulus of the film. The elastic modulus of the material is distinctly influenced by porosity. It reduces with increasing porosity and depends also on the shape of the pores. Test series of titanium films (approx. 2 m thick) with different porosity were deposited on silicon. The laser-acoustic tests yielded elastic moduli for the films that were up to 40 % lower compared to the value of the bulk material. Carefully prepared cross-sections of the films were investigated by scanning electron microscopy. The reducing Young's modulus was found to cor relate with increasing porosity. A pore volume fraction up to approximately 20 % was estimated. A theory for Young's modulus depending on porosity, also taking into account the pore shape, was employed to deduce information on the pore structure from the laser-acoustic results and the scanning electron micrographs. The laser-acoustic method was applied to an extended batch of films deposited with different technologies combining electron evaporation, DC-vacuum arc discharge and pulsed high current arc. It has proved a quick test method to evaluate the deposition of dense films...|$|E
40|$|In serial {{production}} of components for automotive {{applications such as}} cooling and air-conditioning systems, aluminium die-cast material is frequently used due to its excellent castability. The aim of providing light weight components can be approached with thin walled cross sections even for complex structural parts. However, cast components are usually connected to semi-finished products, such as profiles or tubes. The connections have to be mostly pressure tight. The joining technique for those applications has to be highly productive to obtain high component outcome as well as cost-efficient. Laser beam welding techniques are especially suitable for those tasks. Die-cast components have limited or no weldability due to their manufacturing process. Reasons for that are entrapped gases within pores or cavities under high pressure conditions. Furthermore, the mold release agents forthe die-cast process are inappropriate for obtaining homogeneous and sound weld seams. Consequently, a high <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>pores</b> <b>in</b> the weld seam and stochastic melt pool blow-outs occur, which prohibit mostly {{the use of the}} component. To solve these issues a new welding technique, remoweld®T, has been developed at Fraunhofer IWS. The unique method has been extensively tested and transferred to serial-production. The decisive step was to use laser sources with brilliant beam quality in combination with a high frequency beam oscillation within the melt pool. In this paper the technological approach will be presented. With the remoweld®T method it was possible to obtain homogeneous weld seams with low porosity and a strongly reduced distortion for the first time.

Previous investigators have extensively studied the elution of antibiotics from bone cement and corresponding changes in biomechanical properties, but hardness tests are not well investigated. Past researchers have primarily tested the effects of vacuum mixing versus hand-mixing (Zivic et al. [2012]). Hand-mixing increases the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>pores</b> present <b>in</b> PMMA; consequently, deformation/hardness tests provided evidence that hardness increased as the PMMA cement was vacuumed for longer periods of time.

The effects were evaluated by measuring the pressure difference over the samples in relation to the flow through the sample, by the ball on ring method and by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in air at temperatures between 300 and 450 °C. The resulting structures were also evaluated with scanning electron microscopy. The work showed a dependence on the pore former composition and electrode powder pre-treatment resulting in variations in porosity, strength and flow resistance.

The influence of the environment on the phenotype, however, was not tested so far. This study analyses differences in phenotypical variations within three populations of Micraster (Gibbaster) brevis from the early Coniacian, two from the Münsterland Cretaceous Basin (Germany) and one from the North Cantabrian Basin (Spain). The environments of the Spanish and the German sites differed by their sedimentary characteristics, which are generally a crucial factor for morphological adaptations in echinoids. Most of the major phenotypical variations (position of the ambitus, periproct and development of the subanal fasciole) among the populations can be linked to differences in their host sediments. These phenotypic variations are presumed to be an expression of phenotpic plasticiy, which has not been considered in Micraster in previous studies.

As atmospheric CO 2 increases a process called ocean acidification begins to take place. Ocean acidification causes {{major changes in the}} carbonate chemistry of the ocean as well as the vital biological and geochemical processes of the sea. Oceanic uptake of CO 2 drives seawater pH to become more acidic as well as decreasing the saturation state of calcite and aragonite, both of which are critical minerals in the coral reef ecosystem. CaCO 3 minerals can either be produced by calcifying reefal organisms such as coral, or can be inorganically precipitated out of seawater as cements. Both processes help to bind reef framework and protect reefs against erosion. Ocean acidification is thought to decrease calcification rates in coral reefs and increase susceptibility to erosion. Numerous researchers have studied the effects of low pH on calcifying organisms as well as the effects of changing nutrient and saturation state levels on calcifying organisms. What has been over looked is the affect of ocean acidification on the relative abundance of carbonate cements that help bind reefs.

In the frame of this study, Portland cement paste samples were produced by adding CS in the concentration range from 0 to 40 volume %. Water uptake of hardened samples was checked and pore size distribution by using the mercury porosimetry was determined. In a cold climate where the temperature often falls below 0 °C, {{it is important to}} avoid the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> micrometer sized <b>pores</b> <b>in</b> the final structure and to decrease water absorption capacity of material. In winter conditions, water fills such pores and causes additional stresses to their walls by expansion while freezing. It was found that generally water uptake capacity for cement paste samples decreased up to 20 % by increasing the concentration of CS up to 40 volume %, at the same time, the volume of micrometer sized opened pores increases...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Biological hard tissues show {{preferential}} {{alignment of}} the c-axis of biological apatite (BAp) crystallites depending on the shape and stress distribution in vivo, but apatite-base bioceramics developed for bone grafting have no preferential BAp orientation. Thus, the crystal orientation was controlled for developing novel bioceramics with apatite (Ap) texture similar to biological hard tissues. Since cortical portion in a bovine femur shows a one-dimensional orientation along the longitudinal direction of long bone, the effect of heat treatment on Ap orientation was investigated in the femur bone as a starting material. Heat treatment was performed first at 600 °C for 1 h to remove organic constituents and subsequently at each temperature between 700 °C and 1300 °C. Crystal orientation and texture of BAp were measured by the micro-beam X-ray diffractometer. Size of BAp crystallites increased remarkably after a heat treatment even at 600 °C for 1 h and a great <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>pore</b> remained <b>in</b> the Ap ceramics {{in exchange for the}} organic constituents. Several Ap grains were surrounded as a group by the pores, but additional heat treatment in a temperature range up to 900 °C reduced the number of Ap grains in the group, and finally became a single grain region at 1000 °C. Pore density decreased with increasing annealing temperature, especially above 1000 °C. One-dimensional preferential {{alignment of the}} c-axis in Ap maintained during all the heat treatment and the degree increased with increasing annealing temperature because a lot of low-energy low angle boundaries against the c-axis existed in the starting material and preferentially remained in the synthesized Ap ceramics. It was therefore concluded that adequate heat treatment of bovine femur can give the preferential crystal orientation in Ap ceramics...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{beam bending}} (BB) {{experiments}} of microporous t 31 rns with very small pores {{have shown that}} the fluid confined <b>in</b> these <b>pores</b> exhibits monotonic compressive stresses as the relative pressure is varied from vacuum to saturation (relative vapor pressure, p/p. = 1). The variation of the stress near saturation is found to be linear in hz(p) and given by the saturated liquid density to within 20 %. Capillary condensed fluids are traditionally described by the Laplace-Kelvin (LK) theory. LK theory correctly predicts the slope of the stress near saturation to be pl, but also predicts that the stress should be zero at saturation and tensile between saturation aud the capillary transition pressure. Hence LK theory does not capture the monotonic compressive stress observed in BB experiments. This report describes the results of density functional theory calculations for a simple fluid continued to a slit pore network. We show how the presence of even a small <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> polydispersity <b>in</b> <b>pore</b> size leads to both a monotonic compressive stress as well as the observed LK slope...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Anti-reflective (AR) {{coatings}} are optical coatings {{that increase}} the light transmission and therefore, reduce the theoretical reflection of an ordinary soda-lime-silica (SLS) float glass {{at the level of}} 8 %. For an anti-reflective glass, the surface of glass should be coated with a film that has smaller refractive index than the glass. There is no inorganic material that would satisfy the low refractive requirements of a single-layer anti-reflective coating for commercial SLS glasses. Most SLS glasses used in windows and various containers have an index of refraction ∼ 1. 52. This means ∼ 4. 3 % of the incident light is reflected from each glass surface. Generally, single layer anti-reflective coatings are based on SiO 2 and on these single layer films, low refractive index is controlled by the <b>amount</b> and size <b>of</b> <b>pores.</b> <b>In</b> the present study, the effects of solution composition and withdrawing speeds on AR properties of single layer films were investigated. Three different solution compositions namely, colloidal, basic and acidic SiO 2 solutions were used in sol-gel dip coatings. The results showed that, highest AR properties were achieved with a film produced using base silica solution, on the other hand highest mechanical stability was achieved with a film produced using acidic silica solution...|$|R
40|$|Scania uses powder plasma spray {{technology}} to coat their cylinder linings. The powder used contains stainless steel and ceramics. In {{order for the}} properties of the coating to reach the quality demands, it has to have a certain <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>pores</b> and ceramics <b>in</b> it. Despite the process being strictly controlled the coating has proven to exhibit differences in composition. Process parameters for each coated lining are logged and as part of Scania’s quality control, samples of the coating are frequently tested. For the purpose of this work, three process parameters were mapped in search for correlations to the composition of the coating – electric current, voltage and power output. To investigate the homogeneity of the powder it was analyzed using Scanning Electron Microscopy. The main findings were that there are no correlations found between the three process parameters and the composition of the coating. Moreover, in the powder analysis {{it was found that the}} composition of the powder itself varies to an extent that elements differ as much as twice the amount in between different batches and sites in the production. The results imply that it is difficult to prevent irregularities by managing process parameters. The variations in powder composition need to be further investigated in order to determine its impact on the quality of the coating...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to evaluate the mechanical properties, chemical and corrosion resistance of four types of metallic coatings: FeCr, FeCoCr, and FeCoCrNi, FeCrNi sprayed through thermal spraying in electric arc on an anchor substrate type 95 Ni 5 Al or 78. 3 Ni 20 Cr 1. 4 Si 0. 3 Fe. The five layers tested were deposited on carbon steel support low alloyed and the obtained results have provided a picture regarding the possibilities of using of the deposits. Because these types of alloys are used to increase the wear resistance of tools, it is very important to know their behaviour is saline environment, because the contributions brought by this paper would increase the applicability domain of these materials (could be used to recondition by thermal spraying the tools used in naval and petroleum industry). The researches of the obtained deposits have been carried out through several methods to screen their performance. Therefore, there have been done investigations on the microstructural morphology of the deposit, by optical microscopy (OM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The OM and SEM results have sought to determine the degree of uniformity of the deposits and the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>pores</b> and oxides <b>in</b> layer. The physical properties of coatings were also evaluated by adhesion and porosity quantification. The corrosion resistance was evaluated by exposing samples in saline fog chamber.

40|$|Zeolites are {{crystalline}} aluminosilicates with molecular sieving {{properties and}} {{are widely used}} in industrial applications such as catalysis, sorption and ion-exchange. Zeolite membranes are highly interesting due to their capability to continuously separate molecules under severe conditions. The MFI zeolite structure has suitable pore diameter for many applications, and its thermal and chemical stability is high. In order to obtain high performance MFI membranes, a thin and defect free film is needed for high flux and high selectivity. In this thesis, parameters affecting quality of zeolite membranes have been investigated. Different MFI-zeolite membranes were prepared using seed crystals and hydrothermal synthesis. Thereafter, membranes were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, single gas permeation measurements, porosimetry and separation experiments. The effect of grain boundaries was investigated by preparing membranes with small crystal size. It was found that a high <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> grain boundaries reduced {{the quality of the}} membranes. In another study, the effect of exposure to aqueous solutions was found to increase the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> non-zeolitic <b>pores</b> <b>in</b> the membrane, and thus it decreased the quality of the membrane. However, no such effect was found for ethanol that was identified as a safe rinsing media. Membranes with different Si/Al ratio were also prepared and evaluated. It was observed that the Si/Al ratio of a MFI membrane influences the performance of the membrane. It was found that an increase of aluminium makes the membrane more polar which leads to an improved adsorption of, and selectivity for polar molecules. The effect of support invasion was also evaluated and the regularity and extension of the support invasion was observed to affect membrane quality. The effect of heating rate during calcination was investigated and no correlation between heating rate and membrane quality was observed. Calcination of membranes was studied in-situ by high temperature synchrotron radiation and a model for crack formation was postulated. In summary, this work has shown that in order to obtain high quality membranes, the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> grain boundaries, the film thickness and support invasion should be controlled. To obtain the best performance of the membranes the Si/Al ratio should be chosen with respect to the application. Finally, water exposure affects the lifetime of the MFI membranes in certain applications. Godkänd; 2007; 20071012 (ysko...|$|R
40|$|Hydrocarbon gases (methane, ethane, propane, isobutane, n-butane, ethene, and propene) {{are present}} in Tertiary and Quaternary shelf, upper-slope, and lower-slope {{deposits}} of the Peruvian continental margin. Methane dominates {{the composition of the}} hydrocarbon gas at all 10 sites examined during Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 112. Generation of methane is regulated by the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> sulfate <b>in</b> <b>pore</b> water. Wherever sulfate concentrations approach or equal zero, methane concentrations increase rapidly, reaching values near 100, 000 µL/L of wet sediment at eight of the 10 sites. Methane at all 10 sites results from methanogenesis, which is inhibited where sulfate is present and microbial reduction of sulfate occurs. Hydrocarbon gases heavier than methane also are present, but at much lower concentrations than methane. These hydrocarbons are thought to result from early thermal and microbial diagenesis, based on relative gas compositions and trends of concentrations with depth. With few exceptions, the results obtained in the shipboard and shore-based laboratories are comparable for methane and ethane in sediments of Leg 112. Reanalyses of canned sediments from ODP Leg 104 and from Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) Legs 76 and 84 show that gas samples can be stored for as long as 8 yr, but the <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> individual hydrocarbon gases retained vary.
