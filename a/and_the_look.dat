5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} Mumbai on 6 December 2008. The art direction was handled by Nitin Chandrakant Desai, Piyush Shah did the cinematography, and Ballu Saluja edited the film. Before the filming began, several rehearsals were done {{to choose the}} right look for the characters. Neeta Lulla {{was brought in to}} design Chopra's clothes, while a non-film hair stylist named Asha Harirahan was chosen to design twelve different hair styles <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>look</b> of each character. It had a single start-to-finish schedule and was filmed at 65 different locations across Mumbai.|$|E
5|$|Aoki {{ultimately}} produced Chrono Trigger, while director credits were {{attributed to}} Akihiko Matsui, Yoshinori Kitase and Takashi Tokita. Toriyama designed the game's aesthetic, including characters, monsters, vehicles, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>look</b> of each era. Masato Kato also contributed character ideas and designs. Kato planned to feature Gaspar as a playable character and Toriyama sketched him, but he was cut early in development. The development staff studied the drawings of Toriyama to approximate his style. Sakaguchi and Horii supervised; Sakaguchi {{was responsible for the}} game's overall system and contributed several monster ideas. Other notable designers include Tetsuya Takahashi, the graphic director, and Yasuyuki Honne, Tetsuya Nomura, and Yusuke Naora, who worked as field graphic artists. Yasuhika Kamata programmed graphics, and cited Ridley Scott's visual work in the film Alien as an inspiration for the game's lighting. Kamata made the game's luminosity and color choice lay between that of Secret of Mana and the Final Fantasy series. Features originally intended to be used in Secret of Mana or Final Fantasy IV, also under development at the same time, were appropriated by the Chrono Trigger team.|$|E
25|$|The Solaris Urbino 12 Hybrid uses a {{parallel}} hybrid system HDU {{made by the}} American company Eaton. It comprises inter alia with a 6-speed Eaton automatic gearbox and one electric motor with maximum power of 44kW (60hp). In normal traffic movement the power is on about 28kW (38hp). It operates with a Cummins ISB6.7EV 225B diesel engine, meeting {{the requirements of the}} EEV standard, with a maximum power of 165kW (225hp) and the volume of 6.7 dm. The Eaton gearbox transmits power to the rear axle. All batteries are lithium-ion (Li-Ion) made by the Japanese company Hitachi which have been placed under the platforms inside the vehicle. By this the appearance of the bus has changed <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>look</b> is different when compared with the traditional diesel engine powered buses. The cost of this system is about 70 thousand Euros.|$|E

The shoot took place in various outdoor locations throughout Tokyo, {{as well as on}} a soundstage. Madonna and hairstylist Andy LeCompte decided to try a new look for her, a platinum blonde bob wig. She wore this wig in the last two nights of the Confessions Tour, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>look</b> received compliments. Madonna also wore a black leather garment, which an Entertainment Weekly writer wrote accentuated her [...] "toned body".|$|E
500|$|Reptile's {{appearance}} in [...] used {{an amalgam of}} his three previous designs, intended by character designer Mark Lappin to portray a classic yet fresh feel for the character. The design incorporated the appearance of his body from Mortal Kombat 4, his clothing from the original Mortal Kombat, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>look</b> of his feet, hands, and armor from Deadly Alliance. In addition, black strips of cloth wrapped around his forearms, hands, and head, leaving his eyes and mouth exposed. The design was later reused as his primary outfit in , with his appearance from Deadly Alliance serving as his secondary outfit.|$|E

500|$|FuseFX {{also worked}} on Lola, Coulson's [...] "vintage 1962 Corvette" [...] which was {{described}} as [...] "a classic car and beautiful in its own right, but through digital effects, Fuse has added hovercraft capabilities. When Coulson needs it, the wheel's rotate into a horizontal position, exposing hidden jet engine ducts that create lifting thrust through the rims of the tires, which double as turbo-fan blades. We worked closely with production to help design the mechanism <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>look</b> of the hovercraft engines. It's Stark technology designed {{to be consistent with}} the period aspect of the car." [...] When the real Corvette is shown transitioning to its hover mode, volumetric dust, exhaust, and particle effects are added. Occasionally, FuseFX was required to use a fully digital model of the car, which matches the real vehicle precisely.|$|E
500|$|Development and {{production}} for Tucker: The Man and His Dream included {{the involvement of}} Tucker's children and grandchildren. Jeff Bridges was cast {{in the title role}} and, for research, studied Preston Tucker's mannerisms and movements through home movies. Tucker's descendants also granted Bridges the opportunity to sport the man's black pearl ring and cuff links for his wardrobe. Preston's son, John Tucker, said that Bridges has [...] "got it all in the mannerisms <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>look.</b> My father was very positive, always thinking of what came next. Jeff captures that." [...] Martin Landau was enthusiastic about accepting the pivotal role of Abe Karatz as a means to avoid typecasting. The construct of family values {{played a crucial role in}} the Tuckers' life and Coppola studiously selected Joan Allen for the part of Vera, Tucker's devoted wife while Christian Slater and Elias Koteas fill in the other central roles of eldest son and Tucker's friend and confederate, Alex Tremulis. Coppola's family was undergoing a stressful time during the production and he dedicated the film to Gio, his eldest son, who died before filming began.|$|E
500|$|Where possible, the {{developers}} drew on or adapted assets from Halo 3 and Reach. For elements {{that had no}} analogues, Microsoft sent art director Ben Cammarano to Saber's offices in St. Petersburg, Russia, to oversee the redesign of the game's visuals. Cammarano established four tenets of Halo—what Iones termed [...] "heroic vistas, iconic imagery and characters, clean and vibrant aesthetics, and visceral action"—to guide Saber's artists. Since the original assets already existed, concept artists took screenshots from the original game and painted over new looks to show how environmental effects, improved lighting, and new textures could change {{the look of the}} levels. Some of Saber's visual designs were considered too much of a departure from the original game—while the artists had changed the position of the Halo ringworld and nearby planets to make a more pleasing skybox, Microsoft insisted maintaining continuity with the universe was more important and vetoed the changes. Vocal fans pointed out other inconsistencies with the game's visuals in prerelease trailers and pictures that Saber ultimately changed. Iones pointed to the floor designs of the Forerunner structures, the assault rifle, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>look</b> of the Chief as places fans had an impact. The Chief's armor was redesigned from scratch instead of porting existing assets.|$|E

500|$|In 1962, Bond Girl Ursula Andress {{emerged from}} the sea wearing a white bikini in Dr. No. The [...] scene has been {{named one of the}} most memorable of the series. Channel 4 {{declared}} it the top bikini moment in film history, Virgin Media puts it ninth in its top ten, and top in the Bond girls. The Herald (Glasgow) put the scene as best ever on the basis of a poll. It also helped shape the career of Ursula Andress, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>look</b> of the quintessential Bond movie. Andress said that she owed her career to that white bikini, remarking, [...] "This bikini made me into a success. As a result of starring in Dr. No as the first Bond girl, I was given the freedom to take my pick of future roles and to become financially independent." [...] In 2001, the Dr. No bikini worn by Andress in the film sold at auction for US$61,500. That white bikini has been described as a [...] "defining moment in the sixties liberalization of screen eroticism". [...] Because of the shocking effect from how revealing it was at the time, she got referred to by the joke nickname [...] "Ursula Undress". According to the British Broadcasting Corporation, [...] "So iconic was the look that it was repeated 40 years later by Halle Berry in the Bond movie Die Another Day." ...|$|E
500|$|Tammareddy Bharadwaja said [...] "Ever since Arundhati and Magadheera {{did well}} at the box office, {{the rest of the}} {{industry}} started following their footsteps. Also, since there is an irrational craze to make high budget films right now, producers are turning towards mythological films. It is the only genre where you can boast of spending crores for creating the sets <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>look</b> of the film. But what they don't realize is that if these films flop, the blow to the producer will be severe." [...] Films like Anaganaga O Dheerudu (2011) and Shakti (2011) were commercial failures and Badrinath (2012) was an average grosser; all being fantasy films in which the protagonist is a warrior. The promos of Badrinath looked similar to Magadheera and the former's director V. V. Vinayak along with its male lead Allu Arjun kept insisting that Badrinath is dissimilar to Magadheera. Producer Natti Kumar said [...] "If a hero delivers a hit, producers run after him for five years and burn their fingers only after six or eight flops. It's the same story with movies. Since Magadheera became a hit, every other hero and director wants to do period film where there is scope to spend crores. They don't work on the script, story or relevance. It is a pure display of graphics, heroes' abs and grandeur. The plot is lost. Magadheera worked because it was a novel genre then, but why will people want to see the same things again?".|$|E
500|$|Executive {{producer}} Maurice Hurley {{was pleased}} with the outcome of the episode, saying [...] "The sets, the design of it <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>look</b> of that show was brilliant, I thought {{that might have been the}} best-looking show of the first season". However, he felt that the characterisations weren't quite right. This was the same opinion as that put forward by actor Brent Spiner, who portrayed both Data and Lore, who thought that Data's actions were not in line with his expectations of the character. This episode was the second and last appearance of Biff Yeager as Chief Engineer Argyle. He was the only one of the Chief Engineers introduced during the first season to appear twice, with Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton) gaining the role in season two. Wil Wheaton later recalled that the stand-in actor used in this episode really irritated Spiner, and was never used again. He described the stand-in as looking like [...] "a break dancer doing the Robot" [...] whenever he had to portray Data or Lore, and said that [...] "I think the guy was really into playing an android, and his enthusiasm got cranked up to eleven, but by the end of the week, pretty much everyone wanted to deactivate him and sell him to the nearest Jawa." [...] The events of the episode would be followed up in later seasons, with the crystalline entity returning in the fifth-season episode [...] "Silicon Avatar". Brent Spiner reprised the role of Lore in the episodes [...] "" [...] and [...] "".|$|E

500|$|Chickasha, Oklahoma {{gave birth}} to avant garde, glam-punk bands Victoria Vein and the Thunderpunks in 1974 and Debris' in 1975 whose self-released {{underground}} classic Static Disposal was released in 1976. The album has been touted as an inspiration by numerous bands including Scream, Nurse With Wound, the Melvins and Sonic Youth. In 1975, the Suicide Commandos formed in Minneapolis. They {{were one of the}} first U.S. bands outside of New York to play in the Ramones-style harder-louder-faster mode that would define punk rock. Detroit's Death self-released one of their 1974 recordings, [...] "Politicians in My Eyes", in 1976. As the punk movement expanded rapidly in the United Kingdom that year, a few bands with similar tastes and attitude appeared around the United States. The first West Coast punk scenes emerged in San Francisco, with the bands Crime and the Nuns, and Seattle, where the Telepaths, Meyce, and the Tupperwares played a groundbreaking show on May 1. Rock critic Richard Meltzer cofounded VOM (short for [...] "vomit") in Los Angeles. Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, performer Alice Bag formed the punk music group the Bags in 1977. Alice influenced the Hollywood punk scene by incorporating Mexican and Chicano musical culture into her music through canción ranchera—which translates to [...] "country song" [...] and is associated with mariachi ensembles—as well as estilo bravío, a wild style of performance often seen in punk. In Washington, D.C., raucous roots-rockers the Razz helped along a nascent punk scene featuring Overkill, the Slickee Boys, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Look.</b> Around the turn of the year, White Boy began giving notoriously crazed performances. In Boston, the scene at the Rathskeller—affectionately known as the Rat—was also turning toward punk, though the defining sound retained a distinct garage rock orientation. Among the city's first new acts to be identified with punk rock was DMZ. In Bloomington, Indiana, the Gizmos played in a jokey, raunchy, Dictators-inspired style later referred to as [...] "frat punk".|$|E
500|$|In the United States, shock-rock pioneer Alice Cooper {{achieved}} mainstream {{success with}} the top five album School's Out (1972), which {{was followed by the}} #1 album Billion Dollar Babies in 1973. Also in 1973, blues rockers ZZ Top released their classic album Tres Hombres and Aerosmith produced their eponymous début, as did Southern rockers Lynyrd Skynyrd and proto-punk outfit New York Dolls, demonstrating the diverse directions being pursued in the genre. Montrose, including the instrumental talent of Ronnie Montrose and vocals of Sammy Hagar and arguably the first all American hard rock band to challenge the British dominance of the genre, released their first album in 1973. Former bubblegum-pop family act the Osmonds recorded two hard rock albums in 1972 and had their breakthrough in the UK with the hard-rock hit [...] "Crazy Horses." [...] Kiss built on the theatrics of Alice Cooper <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>look</b> of the New York Dolls to produce a unique band persona, achieving their commercial breakthrough with the double live album Alive! in 1975 and helping to take hard rock into the stadium rock era. In the mid-1970s Aerosmith achieved their commercial and artistic breakthrough with Toys in the Attic (1975), which reached number 11 in the American album chart, and Rocks (1976), which peaked at number three. Blue Öyster Cult, formed in the late 60s, picked up on some of the elements introduced by Black Sabbath with their breakthrough live gold album On Your Feet or on Your Knees (1975), followed by their first platinum album, Agents of Fortune (1976), containing the hit single [...] "(Don't Fear) The Reaper", which reached number 12 on the Billboard charts. Journey released their eponymous debut in 1975 and the next year Boston released their highly successful début album. In the same year, hard rock bands featuring women saw commercial success as Heart released Dreamboat Annie and the Runaways débuted with their self-titled album. While Heart had a more folk-oriented hard rock sound, the Runaways leaned more towards a mix of punk-influenced music and hard rock. The Amboy Dukes, having emerged from the Detroit garage rock scene and most famous for their Top 20 psychedelic hit [...] "Journey to the Center of the Mind" [...] (1968), were dissolved by their guitarist Ted Nugent, who embarked on a solo career that resulted in four successive multi-platinum albums between Ted Nugent (1975) and his best selling Double Live Gonzo!
