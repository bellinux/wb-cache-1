5|$|In Acapulco, {{the storm}} {{produced}} strong waves and heavy rain, leaving coastal streets {{with up to}} 16inches (405mm) of water. The heavy rainfall flooded 200houses and caused a mudslide, resulting {{in the death of}} a seven-year-old boy. Flooding also occurred <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>airport</b> <b>in</b> Acapulco, though service was not interrupted. Offshore, strong waves capsized a boat, leaving one person missing. Heavy rainfall in the port of Lázaro Cárdenas, Michoacán, overflowed a canal, forcing over 500people to evacuate their homes. 500acres (2km2) of crops were destroyed by Lane in Michoacán. Road and airport damage in Colima totaled to about $30million (2006MXN, $2.7million 2006USD). In Cajón de Peña, Jalisco, rainfall totaled to 7.36inches (187mm).

Olajuwon was not highly recruited and was merely offered {{a visit to the}} university to work out for the coaching staff, based on a recommendation from a friend of Lewis who had seen Olajuwon play.

5|$|The {{effects of}} Emilia reached the southwestern United States. In {{southern}} Arizona, {{a surge of}} moisture from the storm produced scattered thunderstorms, including one severe thunderstorm in Santa Cruz County. The cell dropped heavy rainfall and large hailstones in {{a short amount of}} time; one location reported hail of 1.75inches (44.5mm) in diameter. The rainfall, which totaled several inches in some areas, caused flash flooding, with 8inches (205mm) of floodwater reported at one location along Interstate 19. Thunderstorms in Graham County produced a wind gust of 64mph (103km/h) <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>airport</b> <b>in</b> Safford. Unsettled conditions persisted across Arizona for about a week. In southern California, the storm dropped light rainfall, which assisted firefighters in containing a wildfire.|$|E
5|$|Production {{began in}} 1979, when Deodato was {{contacted}} by German film producers {{to make a}} film similar to Last Cannibal World, which was also directed by Deodato. He accepted the project and immediately went in search of a producer, choosing his friend Francesco Palaggi. The two first flew to Colombia to scout for filming locations. Leticia was chosen as the principal filming location after Deodato met a Colombian documentary filmmaker <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>airport</b> <b>in</b> Bogotá, who suggested the town as a location ideal for filming. Other locations had been considered, specifically the locations where the film Burn!, directed by Gillo Pontecorvo, had been shot, but Deodato rejected these locations due to lack of suitable rainforest. Leticia was only accessible by aircraft, and from there, the cast and crew had to travel by boat to reach the set. The locale presented many problems for the production, in particular the heat and sudden rain storms, which sporadically delayed filming.|$|E
